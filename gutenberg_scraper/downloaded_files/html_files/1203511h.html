  <small><small>BEING THE ACCOUNT OF DR. NEBOGIPFEL'S SOJOURN IN
  LLYDDWDD</small></small></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Science Schools Journal</i>, The Royal College
  of Science, 1888</h3>

  <p>About half-a-mile outside the village of Llyddwdd by the road that goes up
  over the eastern flank of the mountain called Pen-y-pwll to Rwstog is a large
  farm-building known as the Manse. It derives this title from the fact that it
  was at one time the residence of the minister of the Calvinistic Methodists.
  It is a quaint, low, irregular erection, lying back some hundred yards from
  the railway, and now fast passing into a ruinous state.</p>

  <p>Since its construction in the latter half of the last century this house
  has undergone many changes of fortune, having been abandoned long since by
  the farmer of the surrounding acres for less pretentious and more commodious
  headquarters. Among others Miss Carnot, "the Gallic Sappho" at one time made
  it her home, and later on an old man named Williams became its occupier. The
  foul murder of this tenant by his two sons was the cause of its remaining for
  some considerable period uninhabited; with the inevitable consequence of its
  undergoing very extensive dilapidation.</p>

  <p>The house had got a bad name, and adolescent man and Nature combined to
  bring swift desolation upon it. The fear of the Williamses which kept the
  Llyddwdd lads from gratifying their propensity to invade its deserted
  interior, manifested itself in unusually destructive resentment against its
  external breakables. The missiles with which they at once confessed and
  defied their spiritual dread, left scarcely a splinter of glass, and only
  battered relics of the old-fashioned leaden frames, in its narrow windows,
  while numberless shattered tiles about the house, and four or five black
  apertures yawning behind the naked rafters in the roof, also witnessed
  vividly to the energy of their rejection. Rain and wind thus had free way to
  enter the empty rooms and work their will there, old Time aiding and
  abetting. Alternately soaked and desiccated, the planks of flooring and
  wainscot warped apart strangely, split here and there, and tore themselves
  away in paroxysms of rheumatic pain from the rust-devoured nails that had
  once held them firm. The plaster of walls and ceiling, growing green-black
  with a rain-fed crust of lowly life, parted slowly from the fermenting laths;
  and large fragments thereof falling down inexplicably in tranquil hours, with
  loud concussion and clatter, gave strength to the popular superstition that
  old Williams and his sons were fated to re-enact their fearful tragedy until
  the final judgment. White roses and daedal creepers, that Miss Carnot had
  first adorned the walls with, spread now luxuriantly over the lichen-filmed
  tiles of the roof, and in slender graceful sprays timidly invaded the ghostly
  cobweb-draped apartments. Fungi, sickly pale, began to displace and uplift
  the bricks in the cellar floor; while on the rotting wood everywhere they
  clustered, in all the glory of the purple and mottled crimson, yellow-brown
  and hepatite. Woodlice and ants, beetles and moths, winged and creeping
  things innumerable, found each day a more congenial home among the ruins; and
  after them in ever-increasing multitudes swarmed the blotchy toads. Swallows
  and martins built every year more thickly in the silent, airy, upper
  chambers. Bats and owls struggled for the crepuscular corners of the lower
  rooms. Thus, in the Spring of the year eighteen hundred and eighty-seven, was
  Nature taking over, gradually but certainly, the tenancy of the old Manse.
  "The house was falling into decay," as men who do not appreciate the
  application of human derelicts to other beings' use would say, "surely and
  swiftly." But it was destined nevertheless to shelter another human tenant
  before its final dissolution.</p>

  <p>There was no intelligence of the advent of a new inhabitant in quiet
  Llyddwdd. He came without a solitary premonition out of the vast unknown into
  the sphere of minute village observation and gossip. He fell into the
  Llyddwdd world, as it were, like a thunderbolt falling in the daytime.
  Suddenly, out of nothingness, he was. Rumour, indeed, vaguely averred that he
  was seen to arrive by a certain train from London, and to walk straight
  without hesitation to the old Manse, giving neither explanatory word nor sign
  to mortal as to his purpose there: but then the same fertile source of
  information also hinted that he was first beheld skimming down the slopes of
  steep Pen-y-pwll with exceeding swiftness, riding, as it appeared to the
  intelligent observer, upon an instrument not unlike a sieve and that he
  entered the house by the chimney. Of these conflicting reports, the former
  was the first to be generally circulated, but the latter, in view of the
  bizarre presence and eccentric ways of the newest inhabitant, obtained wider
  credence. By whatever means he arrived, there can be no doubt that he was in,
  and in possession of the Manse, on the first of May; because on the morning
  of that day he was inspected by Mrs. Morgan ap Lloyd Jones, and subsequently
  by the numerous persons her report brought up the mountain slope, engaged in
  the curious occupation of nailing sheet-tin across the void window sockets of
  his new domicile&mdash;"blinding his house", as Mrs. Morgan ap Lloyd Jones
  not inaptly termed it.</p>

  <p>He was a small-bodied, sallow faced little man, clad in a close-fitting
  garment of some stiff, dark material, which Mr. Parry Davies the Llyddwdd
  shoemaker, opined was leather. His aquiline nose, thin lips, high
  cheek-ridges, and pointed chin, were all small and mutually well
  proportioned; but the bones and muscles of his face were rendered excessively
  prominent and distinct by his extreme leanness. The same cause contributed to
  the sunken appearance of the large eager-looking grey eyes, that gazed forth
  from under his phenomenally wide and high forehead. It was this latter
  feature that most powerfully attracted the attention of an observer. It
  seemed to be great beyond all preconceived ratio to the rest of his
  countenance. Dimensions, corrugations, wrinkles, venation, were alike
  abnormally exaggerated. Below it his eyes glowed like lights in some cave at
  a cliff's foot. It so over-powered and suppressed the rest of his face as to
  give an unhuman appearance almost, to what would otherwise have been an
  unquestionably handsome profile. The lank black hair that hung unkempt before
  his eyes served to increase rather than conceal this effect, by adding to
  unnatural altitude a suggestion of hydrocephalic projection: and the idea of
  something ultra human was furthermore accentuated by the temporal arteries
  that pulsated visibly through his transparent yellow skin. No wonder, in view
  even of these things, that among the highly and over-poetical Cymric of
  Llyddwdd the sieve theory of arrival found considerable favour.</p>

  <p>It was his bearing and actions, however, much more than his personality,
  that won over believers to the warlock notion of matters. In almost every
  circumstance of life the observant villagers soon found his ways were not
  only not their ways, but altogether inexplicable upon any theory of motives
  they could conceive. Thus, in a small matter at the beginning, when Arthur
  Price Williams, eminent and famous in every tavern in Caernarvonshire for his
  social gifts, endeavoured, in choicest Welsh and even choicer English, to
  inveigle the stranger into conversation over the sheet-tin performance, he
  failed utterly. Inquisitional supposition, straightforward enquiry, offer of
  assistance, suggestion of method, sarcasm, irony, abuse, and at last, gage of
  battle, though shouted with much effort from the road hedge, went unanswered
  and apparently unheard. Missile weapons, Arthur Price Williams found, were
  equally unavailing for the purpose of introduction, and the gathered crowd
  dispersed with unappeased curiosity and suspicion. Later in the day, the
  swarth apparition was seen striding down the mountain road towards the
  village, hatless, and with such swift width of step and set resolution of
  countenance, that Arthur Price Williams, beholding him from afar from the Pig
  and Whistle doorway was seized with dire consternation, and hid behind the
  Dutch oven in the kitchen till he was past. Wild panic also smote the
  school-house as the children were coming out, and drove them indoors like
  leaves before a gale. He was merely seeking the provision shop, however, and
  erupted thencefrom after a prolonged stay, loaded with a various armful of
  blue parcels, a loaf, herrings, pigs' trotters, salt pork, and a black
  bottle, with which he returned in the same swift projectile gait to the
  Manse. His way of shopping was to name, and to name simply, without solitary
  other word of explanation, civility or request, the article he required.</p>

  <p>The shopkeeper's crude meteorological superstitions and inquisitive
  commonplaces, he seemed not to hear, and he might have been esteemed deaf if
  he had not evinced the promptest attention to the faintest relevant remark.
  Consequently it was speedily rumoured that he was determined to avoid all but
  the most necessary human intercourse. He lived altogether mysteriously, in
  the decaying manse, without mortal service or companionship, presumably
  sleeping on planks or litter, and either preparing his own food or eating it
  raw. This, coupled with the popular conception of the haunting patricides,
  did much to strengthen the popular supposition of some vast gulf between the
  newcomer and common humanity. The only thing that was inharmonious with this
  idea of severance from mankind was a constant flux of crates filled with
  grotesquely contorted glassware, cases of brazen and steel instruments, huge
  coils of wire, vast iron and fire-clay implements, of inconceivable purpose,
  jars and phials labelled in black and scarlet&mdash;POISON, huge packages of
  books, and gargantuan rolls of cartridge paper, which set in towards his
  Llyddwdd quarters from the outer world. The apparently hieroglyphic
  inscriptions on these various consignments revealed at the profound scrutiny
  of Pugh Jones that the style and title of the new inhabitant was Dr. Moses
  Nebogipfel, Ph.D., F.R.S., N.W.R., PAID: at which discovery much edification
  was felt, especially among the purely Welsh-speaking community. Further than
  this, these arrivals, by their evident unfitness for any allowable mortal
  use, and inferential diabolicalness, filled the neighbourhood with a vague
  horror and lively curiosity, which were greatly augmented by the
  extraordinary phenomena, and still more extraordinary accounts thereof, that
  followed their reception in the Manse.</p>

  <p>The first of these was on Wednesday, the fifteenth of May, when the
  Calvinistic Methodists of Llyddwdd had their annual commemoration festival;
  on which occasion, in accordance with custom, dwellers in the surrounding
  parishes of Rwstog, Pen-y-garn, Caergyllwdd, Llanrdd, and even distant
  Llanrwst flocked into the village. Popular thanks to Providence were
  materialised in the usual way, by means of plum-bread and butter, mixed tea,
  terza, consecrated flirtations, kiss-in-the-ring, rough-and-tumble football,
  and vituperative political speechmaking. About half-past eight the fun began
  to tarnish, and the assembly to break up; and by nine numerous couples and
  occasional groups were wending their way in the darkling along the hilly
  Llyddwdd and Rwstog road. It was a calm warm night; one of those nights when
  lamps, gas and heavy sleep seem stupid ingratitude to the Creator. The zenith
  sky was an ineffable deep lucent blue, and the evening star hung golden in
  the liquid darkness of the west. In the north-north-west, a faint
  phosphorescence marked the sunken day. The moon was just rising, pallid and
  gibbous over the huge haze-dimmed shoulder of Pen-y-pwll. Against the wan
  eastern sky, from the vague outline of the mountain slope, the Manse stood
  out black, clear and solitary. The stillness of the twilight had hushed the
  myriad murmurs of the day. Only the sounds of footsteps and voices and
  laughter, that came fitfully rising and falling from the roadway, and an
  intermittent hammering in the darkened dwelling, broke the silence. Suddenly
  a strange whizzing, buzzing whirr filled the night air, and a bright flicker
  glanced across the dim path of the wayfarers. All eyes were turned in
  astonishment to the old Manse. The house no longer loomed a black featureless
  block but was filled to overflowing with light. From the gaping holes in the
  roof, from chinks and fissures amid tiles and brickwork, from every gap which
  Nature or man had pierced in the crumbling old shell, a blinding blue-white
  glare was streaming, beside which the rising moon seemed a disc of opaque
  sulphur. The thin mist of the dewy night had caught the violet glow and hung,
  unearthly smoke, over the colourless blaze. A strange turmoil and outcrying
  in the old Manse now began, and grew ever more audible to the clustering
  spectators, and therewith came clanging loud impacts against the
  window-guarding tin. Then from the gleaming roof-gaps of the house suddenly
  vomited forth a wonderous swarm of heteromerous living things&mdash;swallows,
  sparrows, martins, owls, bats, insects in visible multitudes, to hang for
  many minutes a noisy, gyring, spreading cloud over the black gables and
  chimneys...and then slowly to thin out and vanish away in the night.</p>

  <p>As this tumult died away the throbbing humming that had first arrested
  attention grew once more in the listener's hearing, until at last it was the
  only sound in the long stillness. Presently, however, the road gradually
  awoke again to the beating and shuffling of feet, as the knots of Rwstog
  people, one by one, turned their blinking eyes from the dazzling whiteness
  and, pondering deeply, continued their homeward way.</p>

  <p>The cultivated reader will have already discerned that this phenomenon,
  which sowed a whole crop of uncanny thoughts in the minds of these worthy
  folk, was simply the installation of the electric light in the Manse. Truly,
  this last vicissitude of the old house was its strangest one. Its revival to
  mortal life was like the raising of Lazarus. From that hour forth, by night
  and day, behind the tin-blinded windows, the tamed lightning illuminated
  every corner of its quickly changing interior. The almost frenzied energy of
  the lank-haired, leather-clad little doctor swept away into obscure holes and
  corners and common destruction, creeper sprays, toadstools, rose leaves,
  birds' nests, birds' eggs, cobwebs, and all the coatings and lovingly
  fanciful trimmings with which that maternal old dotard, Dame Nature, had
  tricked out the decaying house for its lying in state. The magneto-electric
  apparatus whirred incessantly amid the vestiges of the wainscoted
  dining-room, where once the eighteenth-century tenant had piously read
  morning prayer and eaten his Sunday dinner; and in the place of his sacred
  symbolical sideboard was a nasty heap of coke. The oven of the bakehouse
  supplied substratum and material for a forge, whose snorting, panting
  bellows, and intermittent, ruddy spark-laden blast made the benighted, but
  Bible-lit Welsh women murmur in liquid Cymric, as they hurried by: "Whose
  breath kindleth coals, and out of his mouth is a flame of fire." For the idea
  these good people formed of it was that a tame, but occasionally restive,
  leviathan had been added to the terrors of the haunted house. The constantly
  increasing accumulation of pieces of machinery, big brass castings, block
  tin, casks, crates, and packages of innumerable articles, by their demands
  for space, necessitated the sacrifice of most of the slighter partitions of
  the house, and the beams and flooring of the upper chambers were also
  mercilessly sawn away by the tireless scientist in such a way as to convert
  them into mere shelves and corner brackets of the atrial space between
  cellars and rafters. Some of the sounder planking was utilised in the making
  of a rude broad table, upon which files and heaps of geometrical diagrams
  speedily accumulated. The production of these latter seemed to be the object
  upon which the mind of Dr. Nebogipfel was so inflexibly set. All other
  circumstances of his life were made entirely subsidiary to this one
  occupation. Strangely complicated traceries of lines they were&mdash;plans,
  elevations, sections by surfaces and solids, that, with the help of
  logarithmic mechanical apparatus and involved curvigraphical machines, spread
  swiftly under his expert hands over yard after yard of paper. Some of these
  symbolised shapes he despatched to London, and they presently returned,
  realised, in forms of brass and ivory, and nickel and mahogany. Some of them
  he himself translated into solid models of metal and wood; occasionally
  casting the metallic ones in moulds of sand, but often laboriously hewing
  them out of the block for greater precision of dimension. In this second
  process, among other appliances, he employed a steel circular saw set with
  diamond powder and made to rotate with extraordinary swiftness, by means of
  steam and multiplying gear. It was this latter thing, more than all else,
  that filled Llyddwdd with a sickly loathing of the Doctor as a man of blood
  and darkness. Often in the silence of midnight&mdash;for the newest
  inhabitant heeded the sun but little in his incessant research&mdash;the
  awakened dwellers around Pen-y-pwll would hear, what was at first a
  complaining murmur, like the groaning of a wounded man, "gurr-urrurr-URR ",
  rising by slow gradations in pitch and intensity to the likeness of a voice
  in despairing passionate protest, and at last ending abruptly in a sharp
  piercing shriek that rang in the ears for hours afterwards and begot
  numberless gruesome dreams.</p>

  <p>The mystery of all these unearthly noises and inexplicable phenomena, the
  Doctor's inhumanly brusque bearing and evident uneasiness when away from his
  absorbing occupation, his entire and jealous seclusion, and his terrifying
  behaviour to certain officious intruders, roused popular resentment and
  curiously to the highest, and a plot was already on foot to make some sort of
  popular inquisition (probably accompanied by an experimental ducking) into
  his proceedings, when the sudden death of the hunchback Hughes in a fit,
  brought matters to an unexpected crisis. It happened in broad daylight, in
  the roadway just opposite the Manse. Half a dozen people witnessed it. The
  unfortunate creature was seen to fall suddenly and roll about on the pathway,
  struggling violently, as it appeared to the spectators, with some invisible
  assailant. When assistance reached him he was purple in the face and his blue
  lips were covered with a glairy foam. He died almost as soon as they laid
  hands on him.</p>

  <p>Owen Thomas, the general practitioner, vainly assured the excited crowd
  which speedily gathered outside the Pig and Whistle, whither the body had
  been carried, that death was unquestionably natural. A horrible zymotic
  suspicion had gone forth that the deceased was the victim of Dr. Nebogipfel's
  imputed aerial powers. The contagion was with the news that passed like a
  flash through the village and set all Llyddwdd seething with a fierce desire
  for action against the worker of this iniquity. Downright superstition, which
  had previously walked somewhat modestly about the village, in the fear of
  ridicule and the Doctor, now appeared boldly before the sight of all men,
  clad in the terrible majesty of truth. People who had hitherto kept entire
  silence as to their fears of the imp-like philosopher suddenly discovered a
  fearsome pleasure in whispering dread possibilities to kindred souls, and
  from whispers of possibilities their sympathy-fostered utterances soon
  developed into unhesitating asserverations in laud and even high-pitched
  tones. The fancy of a captive leviathan, already alluded to, which had up to
  now been the horrid but secret joy of a certain conclave of ignorant old
  women, was published to all the world as indisputable fact; it being stated,
  on her own authority, that the animal had, on one occasion, chased Mrs.
  Morgan ap Lloyd Jones almost into Rwstog. The story that Nebogipfel had been
  heard within the Manse chanting, in conjunction with the Williamses, horrible
  blasphemy, and that a "black flapping thing, of the size of a young calf",
  had thereupon entered the gap in the roof, was universally believed in. A
  grisly anecdote, that owed its origination to a stumble in the churchyard,
  was circulated, to the effect that the Doctor had been caught ghoulishly
  tearing with his long white fingers at a new-made grave. The numerously
  attested declaration that Nebogipfel and the murdered Williams had been seen
  hanging the sons on a ghostly gibbet, at the back of the house, was due to
  the electric illumination of a fitfully wind-shaken tree. A hundred like
  stories hurtled thickly about the village and darkened the moral atmosphere.
  The Reverend Elijah Ulysses Cook, hearing of the tumult, sallied forth to
  allay it, and narrowly escaped drawing on himself the gathering
  lightning.</p>

  <p>By eight o'clock (it was Monday the twenty-second of July) a grand
  demonstration had organised itself against the "necromancer". A number of
  bolder hearts among the men formed the nucleus of the gathering, and at
  nightfall Arthur Price Williams, John Peters, and others brought torches and
  raised their spark-raining flames aloft with curt ominous suggestions. The
  less adventurous village manhood came straggling late to the rendezvous, and
  with them the married women came in groups of four or five, greatly
  increasing the excitement of the assembly with their shrill hysterical talk
  and active imaginations. After these the children and young girls, overcome
  by undefinable dread, crept quietly out of the too silent and shadowy houses
  into the yellow glare of the pine knots, and the tumultuary noise of the
  thickening people. By nine, nearly half the Llyddwdd population was massed
  before the Pig and Whistle. There was a confused murmur of many tongues, but
  above all the stir and chatter of the growing crowd could be heard the
  coarse, cracked voice of the blood-thirsty old fanatic, Pritchard, drawing a
  congenial lesson from the fate of the four hundred and fifty idolators of
  Carmel.</p>

  <p>Just as the church clock was beating out the hour, an occultly originated
  movement up hill began, and soon the whole assembly, men, women, and
  children, was moving in a fear-compacted mass, towards the ill-fated doctor's
  abode. As they left the brightly-lit public house behind them, a quavering
  female voice began singing one of those grim-sounding canticles that so
  satisfy the Calvinistic ear. In a wonderfully short time, the tune had been
  caught up, first by two or three, and then by the whole procession, and the
  manifold shuffling of heavy shoon grew swiftly into rhythm with the beats of
  the hymn. When, however, their goal rose, like a blazing star, over the
  undulation of the road, the volume of the chanting suddenly died away,
  leaving only the voices of the ringleaders, shouting indeed now somewhat out
  of tune, but, if anything, more vigorously than before. Their persistence and
  example nevertheless failed to prevent a perceptible breaking and slackening
  of the pace, as the Manse was neared, and when the gate was reached, the
  whole crowd came to a dead halt. Vague fear for the future had begotten the
  courage that had brought the villagers thus far: fear for the present now
  smothered its kindred birth. The intense blaze from the gaps in the
  death-like silent pile lit up rows of livid, hesitating faces: and a
  smothered, frightened sobbing broke out among the children. "Well," said
  Arthur Price Williams, addressing Jack Peters, with an expert assumption of
  the modest discipleship, "what do we do now, Jack?" But Peters was regarding
  the Manse with manifest dubiety, and ignored the question. The Llyddwdd
  witch-find seemed to be suddenly aborting.</p>

  <p>At this juncture old Pritchard suddenly pushed his way forward,
  gesticulating weirdly with his bony hands and long arms. "What!" he shouted,
  in broken notes, "fear ye to smite when the Lord hateth? Burn the warlock!"
  And seizing a flambeau from Peters, he flung open the rickety gate and strode
  on down the drive, his torch leaving a coiling trail of scintillant sparks on
  the night wind. "Burn the warlock," screamed a shrill voice from the wavering
  crowd, and in a moment the gregarious human instinct had prevailed. With an
  outburst of incoherent, threatening voice, the mob poured after the
  fanatic.</p>

  <p>Woe betide the Philosopher now! They expected barricaded doors; but with a
  groan of a conscious insufficiency, the hinge-rusted portals swung at the
  push of Pritchard. Blinded by the light, he hesitated for a second on the
  threshold, while his followers came crowding up behind him.</p>

  <p>Those who were there say that they saw Dr. Nebogipfel, standing in the
  toneless electric glare, on a peculiar erection of brass and ebony and ivory;
  and that he seemed to be smiling at them, half pityingly and half scornfully,
  as it is said martyrs are wont to smile. Some assert, moreover, that by his
  side was sitting a tall man, clad in ravenswing, and some even aver that this
  second man&mdash;whom others deny&mdash;bore on his face the likeness of the
  Reverend Elijah Ulysses Cook, while others declare that he resembled the
  description of the murdered Williams. Be that as it may, it must now go
  unproven for ever, for suddenly a wonderous thing smote the crowd as it
  swarmed in through the entrance. Pritchard pitched headlong on the floor
  senseless. While shouts and shrieks of anger, changed in mid utterance to
  yells of agonising fear, or to the mute gasp of heart-stopping horror: and
  then a frantic rush was made for the doorway.</p>

  <p>For the calm, smiling doctor, and his quiet, black-clad companion, and the
  polished platform which upbore them, had vanished before their eyes!</p>

  <h3>HOW AN ESOTERIC STORY BECAME POSSIBLE</h3>

  <p>A silvery-foliaged willow by the side of a mere. Out of the cress-
  spangled waters below, rise clumps of sedge-blades, and among them glows the
  purple fleur-de-lys, and sapphire vapour of forget-me-nots. Beyond is a
  sluggish stream of water reflecting the intense blue of the moist Fenland
  sky; and beyond that a low osier-fringed eyot. This limits all the visible
  universe, save some scattered pollards and spear-like poplars showing against
  the violet distance. At the foot of the willow reclines the Author watching a
  copper butterfly fluttering from iris to iris.</p>

  <p>Who can fix the colours of the sunset? Who can take a cast of flame? Let
  him essay to register the mutations of mortal thought as it wanders from a
  copper butterfly to the disembodied soul, and thence passes to spiritual
  motions and the vanishing of Dr. Moses Nebogipfel and the Rev. Elijah Ulysses
  Cook from the world of sense.</p>

  <p>As the author lay basking there and speculating, as another once did under
  the Budh tree, on mystic transmutations, a presence became apparent. There
  was a somewhat on the eyot between him and the purple horizon&mdash;an opaque
  reflecting entity, making itself dimly perceptible by reflection in the water
  to his averted eyes. He raised them in curious surprise.</p>

  <p>What was it?</p>

  <p>He stared in stupefied astonishment at the apparition, doubted, blinked,
  rubbed his eyes, stared again, and believed. It was solid, it cast a shadow,
  and it upbore two men. There was white metal in it that blazed in the
  noontide sun like incandescent magnesium, ebony bars that drank in the light,
  and white parts that gleamed like polished ivory. Yet withal it seemed
  unreal. The thing was not square as a machine ought to be, but all awry: it
  was twisted and seemed falling over, hanging in two directions, as those
  queer crystals called triclinic hang; it seemed like a machine that had been
  crushed or warped; it was suggestive and not confirmatory, like the machine
  of a disordered dream. The men, too, were dreamlike. One was short, intensely
  sallow, with a strangely-shaped head, and clad in a garment of dark olive
  green, the other was, grotesquely out of place, evidently a clergyman of the
  Established Church, a fair-haired, pale-faced respectable-looking man.</p>

  <p>Once more doubt came rushing in on the author. He sprawled back and stared
  at the sky, rubbed his eyes, stared at the willow wands that hung between him
  and the blue, closely examined his hands to see if his eyes had any new
  things to relate about them, and then sat up again and stared at the eyot. A
  gentle breeze stirred the osiers; a white bird was flapping its way through
  the lower sky. The machine of the vision had vanished! It was an illusion
  &mdash;a projection of the subjective&mdash;an assertion of the immateriality
  of mind. "Yes," interpolated the sceptic faculty, "but how comes it that the
  clergyman is still there?"</p>

  <p>The clergyman had not vanished. In intense perplexity the author examined
  this black-coated phenomenon as he stood regarding the world with hand-shaded
  eyes. The author knew the periphery of that eyot by heart, and the question
  that troubled him was, "Whence?" The clergyman looked as Frenchmen look when
  they land at Newhaven&mdash;intensely travel-worn; his clothes showed rubbed
  and seamy in the bright day. When he came to the edge of the island and
  shouted a question to the author, his voice was broken and trembled. "Yes,"
  answered the author, "it is an island. How did you get there?"</p>

  <p>But the clergyman, instead of replying to this asked a very strange
  question.</p>

  <p>He said "Are you in the nineteenth century?" The author made him repeat
  that question before he replied. "Thank heaven," cried the clergyman
  rapturously. Then he asked very eagerly for the exact date.</p>

  <p>"August the ninth, eighteen hundred and eighty-seven," he repeated after
  the author. "Heaven be praised!" and sinking down on the eyot so that the
  sedges hid him, he audibly burst into tears.</p>

  <p>Now the author was mightily surprised at all this, and going a certain
  distance along the mere, he obtained a punt, and getting into it he hastily
  poled to the eyot where he had last seen the clergyman. He found him lying
  insensible among the reeds, and carried him in his punt to the house where he
  lived, and the clergyman lay there insensible for ten days.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, it became known that he was the Rev. Elijah Cook, who had
  disappeared from Llyddwdd with Dr. Moses Nebogipfel three weeks before.</p>

  <p>On August 19th, the nurse called the author out of his study to speak to
  the invalid. He found him perfectly sensible, but his eyes were strangely
  bright, and his face was deadly pale. "Have you found out who I am?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"You are the Rev. Elijah Ulysses Cook, Master of Arts, of Pembroke
  College, Oxford, and Rector of Llyddwdd, near Rwstog, in Caernarvon."</p>

  <p>He bowed his head. "Have you been told anything of how I came here?"</p>

  <p>"I found you among the reeds," I said. He was silent and thoughtful for a
  while. "I have a deposition to make. Will you take it? It concerns the murder
  of an old man named Williams, which occurred in 1862, this disappearance of
  Dr. Moses Nebogipfel, the abduction of a ward in the year 4003&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>The author stared.</p>

  <p>"The year of our Lord 4003," he corrected. "She would come. Also several
  assaults on public officials in the years 17,901 and 2."</p>

  <p>The author coughed.</p>

  <p>"The years 17,901 and 2, and valuable medical, social, and physiographical
  data for all time."</p>

  <p>After a consultation with the doctor, it was decided to have the
  deposition taken down, and this is which constitutes the remainder of the
  story of the Chronic Argonauts.</p>

  <p>On August 28th, 1887, the Rev Elijah Cook died. His body was conveyed to
  Llyddwdd, and buried in the churchyard there.</p>

  <h3>THE ESOTERIC STORY BASED ON THE CLERGYMAN'S DEPOSITIONS</h3>

  <h3>THE ANACHRONIC MAN</h3>

  <p>Incidentally it has been remarked in the first part, how the Reverend
  Elijah Ulysses Cook attempted and failed to quiet the superstitious
  excitement of the villagers on the afternoon of the memorable twenty-second
  of July. His next proceeding was to try and warn the unsocial philosopher of
  the dangers which impended. With this intent he made his way from the
  rumour-pelted village, through the silent, slumbrous heat of the July
  afternoon, up the slopes of Pen-y-pwll, to the old Manse. His loud knocking
  at the heavy door called forth dull resonance from the interior, and produced
  a shower of lumps of plaster and fragments of decaying touchwood from the
  rickety porch, but beyond this the dreamy stillness of the summer mid-day
  remained unbroken. Everything was so quiet as he stood there expectant, that
  the occasional speech of the haymakers a mile away in the fields, over
  towards Rwstog, could be distinctly heard. The reverend gentleman waited,
  then knocked again, and waited again, and listened, until the echoes and the
  patter of rubbish had melted away into the deep silence, and the creeping in
  the blood-vessels of his ears had become oppressively audible, swelling and
  sinking with sounds like the confused murmuring of a distant crowd, and
  causing a suggestion of anxious discomfort to spread slowly over his
  mind.</p>

  <p>Again he knocked, this time loud, quick blows with his stick, and almost
  immediately afterwards, leaning his hand against the door, he kicked the
  panels vigorously. There was a shouting of echoes, a protesting jarring of
  hinges, and then the oaken door yawned and displayed, in the blue blaze of
  the electric light, vestiges of partitions, piles of planking and straw,
  masses of metal, heaps of papers and overthrown apparatus, to the rector's
  astonished eyes. "Doctor Nebogipfel, excuse my intruding," he called out, but
  the only response was a reverberation among the black beams and shadows that
  hung dimly above. For almost a minute he stood there, leaning forward over
  the threshold, staring at the glittering mechanisms, diagrams, books,
  scattered indiscriminately with broken food, packing cases, heaps of coke,
  hay, and microcosmic lumber, about the undivided house cavity; and then,
  removing his hat and treading stealthily, as if the silence were a sacred
  thing, he stepped into the apparently deserted shelter of the Doctor.</p>

  <p>His eyes sought everywhere, as he cautiously made his way through the
  confusion, with a strange anticipation of finding Nebogipfel hidden somewhere
  in the sharp black shadows among the litter, so strong in him was an
  indescribable sense of perceiving presence. This feeling was so vivid that,
  when, after an abortive exploration, he seated himself upon Nebogipfel's
  diagram-covered bench, it made him explain in a forced hoarse voice to the
  stillness&mdash;"He is not here. I have something to say to him. I must wait
  for him." It was so vivid, too, that the trickling of some grit down the wall
  in the vacant corner behind him made him start round in a sudden
  perspiration. There was nothing visible there, but turning his head back, he
  was stricken rigid with horror by the swift, noiseless apparition of
  Nebogipfel, ghastly pale, and with red stained hands, crouching upon a
  strange-looking metallic platform, and with his deep grey eyes looking
  intently into the visitor's face.</p>

  <p>Cook's first impulse was to yell out his fear, but his throat was
  paralysed, and he could only stare fascinated at the bizarre countenance that
  had thus clashed suddenly into visibility. The lips were quivering and the
  breath came in short convulsive sobs. The un-human forehead was wet with
  perspiration, while the veins were swollen, knotted and purple. The Doctor's
  red hands, too, he noticed, were trembling, as the hands of slight people
  tremble after intense muscular exertion, and his lips closed and opened as if
  he, too, had a difficulty in speaking as he gasped, "Who&mdash;what do you do
  here?"</p>

  <p>Cook answered not a word, but stared with hair erect, open mouth, and
  dilated eyes, at the dark red unmistakeable smear that streaked the pure
  ivory and gleaming nickel and shining ebony of the platform.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" repeated the doctor, raising himself. "What do
  you want?"</p>

  <p>Cook gave a convulsive effort. "In Heaven's name, what are you?" he
  gasped; and then black curtains came closing in from every side, sweeping the
  squatting dwarfish phantasm that reeled before him into rayless, voiceless
  night.</p>

  <p>The Reverend Elijah Ulysses Cook recovered his perceptions to find himself
  lying on the floor of the old Manse, and Doctor Nebogipfel, no longer
  blood-stained and with all trace of his agitation gone, kneeling by his side
  and bending over him with a glass of brandy in his hand. "Do not be alarmed,
  sir," said the philosopher with a faint smile, as the clergyman opened his
  eyes. "I have not treated you to a disembodied spirit, or anything nearly so
  extraordinary...may I offer you this?"</p>

  <p>The clergyman submitted quietly to the brandy, and then stared perplexed
  into Nebogipfel's face, vainly searching his memory for what occurrences had
  preceded his insensibility. Raising himself at last, into a sitting posture,
  he saw the oblique mass of metals that had appeared with the doctor, and
  immediately all that happened flashed back upon his mind. He looked from this
  structure to the recluse, and from the recluse to the structure.</p>

  <p>"There is absolutely no deception, sir," said Nebogipfel with the
  slightest trace of mockery in his voice. "I lay no claim to work in matters
  spiritual. It is a bona fide mechanical contrivance, a thing emphatically of
  this sordid world. Excuse me&mdash;just one minute." He rose from his knees,
  stepped upon the mahogany platform, took a curiously curved lever in his hand
  and pulled it over. Cook rubbed his eyes. There certainly was no deception.
  The doctor and the machine had vanished.</p>

  <p>The reverend gentleman felt no horror this time, only a slight nervous
  shock, to see the doctor presently re-appear "in the twinkling of an eye" and
  get down from the machine. From that he walked in a straight line with his
  hands behind his back and his face downcast, until his progress was stopped
  by the intervention of a circular saw; then, turning round sharply on his
  heel, he said:</p>

  <p>"I was thinking while I was...away...Would you like to come? I should
  greatly value a companion."</p>

  <p>The clergyman was still sitting, hatless, on the floor. "I am afraid," he
  said slowly, "you will think me stupid&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," interrupted the doctor. "The stupidity is mine. You desire
  to have all this explained...wish to know where I am going first. I have
  spoken so little with men of this age for the last ten years or more that I
  have ceased to make due allowances and concessions for other minds. I will do
  my best, but that I fear will be very unsatisfactory. It is a long story...do
  you find that floor comfortable to sit on? If not, there is a nice packing
  case over there, or some straw behind you, or this bench&mdash;the diagrams
  are done with now, but I am afraid of the drawing pins. You may sit on the
  Chronic Argo!"</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," slowly replied the clergyman, eyeing that deformed
  structure thus indicated, suspiciously; "I am quite comfortable here."</p>

  <p>"Then I will begin. Do you read fables? Modern ones?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I must confess to a good deal of fiction," said the clergyman
  deprecatingly. "In Wales the ordained ministers of the sacraments of the
  Church have perhaps too large a share of leisure&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>"Have you read the Ugly Duckling?"</p>

  <p>"Hans Christian Andersen's&mdash;yes&mdash;in my childhood."</p>

  <p>"A wonderful story&mdash;a story that has ever been full of tears and
  heart swelling hopes for me, since first it came to me in my lonely boyhood
  and saved me from unspeakable things. That story, if you understand it well,
  will tell you almost all that you should know of me to comprehend how that
  machine came to be thought of in a mortal brain...Even when I read that
  simple narrative for the first time, a thousand bitter experiences had begun
  the teaching of my isolation among the people of my birth&mdash;I knew the
  story was for me. The ugly duckling that proved to be a swan, that lived
  through all contempt and bitterness, to float at last sublime. From that hour
  forth, I dreamt of meeting with my kind, dreamt of encountering that sympathy
  I knew was my profoundest need. Twenty years I lived in that hope, lived and
  worked, lived and wandered, loved even, and at last, despaired. Only once
  among all those millions of wondering, astonished, indifferent, contemptuous,
  and insidious faces that I met with in that passionate wandering, looked one
  upon me as I desired...looked&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>He paused. The Reverend Cook glanced up into his face, expecting some
  indication of the deep feeling that had sounded in his last words. It was
  downcast, clouded, and thoughtful, but the mouth was rigidly firm.</p>

  <p>"In short, Mr. Cook, I discovered that I was one of those superior Cagots
  called a genius&mdash;a man born out of my time&mdash;a man thinking the
  thoughts of a wiser age, doing things and believing things that men now
  cannot understand, and that in the years ordained to me there was nothing but
  silence and suffering for my soul&mdash;unbroken solitude, man's bitterest
  pain. I knew I was an Anachronic Man; my age was still to come. One filmy
  hope alone held me to life, a hope to which I clung until it had become a
  certain thing. Thirty years of unremitting toil and deepest thought among the
  hidden things of matter and form and life, and then that, the Chronic Argo,
  the ship that sails through time, and now I go to join my generation, to
  journey through the ages till my time has come."</p>

  <h3>THE CHRONIC ARGO</h3>

  <p>Dr. Nebogipfel paused, looked in sudden doubt at the clergyman's perplexed
  face. "You think that sounds mad," he said, "to travel through time?"</p>

  <p>"It certainly jars with accepted opinions," said the clergyman, allowing
  the faintest suggestion of controversy to appear in his intonation, and
  speaking apparently to the Chronic Argo. Even a clergyman of the Church of
  England you see can have a suspicion of illusions at times.</p>

  <p>"It certainly does jar with accepted opinions," agreed the philosopher
  cordially. "It does more than that&mdash;it defies accepted opinions to
  mortal combat. Opinions of all sorts, Mr. Cook&mdash;Scientific Theories,
  Laws, Articles of Belief, or, to come to elements, Logical Premises, Ideas,
  or whatever you like to call them&mdash;all are, from the infinite nature of
  things, so many diagrammatic caricatures of the ineffable&mdash;caricatures
  altogether to be avoided save where they are necessary in the shaping of
  results&mdash;as chalk outlines are necessary to the painter and plans and
  sections to the engineer. Men, from the exigencies of their being, find this
  hard to believe."</p>

  <p>The Rev. Elijah Ulysses Cook nodded his head with the quiet smile of one
  whose opponent has unwittingly given a point.</p>

  <p>"It is as easy to come to regard ideas as complete reproductions of
  entities as it is to roll off a log. Hence it is that almost all civilised
  men believe in the reality of the Greek geometrical conceptions."</p>

  <p>"Oh! pardon me, sir," interrupted Cook. "Most men know that a geometrical
  point has no existence in matter, and the same with a geometrical line. I
  think you underrate..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, those things are recognised," said Nebogipfel calmly; "but
  now...a cube. Does that exist in the material universe?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"An instantaneous cube?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you intend by that expression."</p>

  <p>"Without any other sort of extension; a body having length, breadth, and
  thickness, exists?"</p>

  <p>"What other sort of extension can there be?" asked Cook, with raised
  eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Has it never occurred to you that no form can exist in the material
  universe that has no extension in time?...Has it never glimmered upon your
  consciousness that nothing stood between men and a geometry of four
  dimensions&mdash;length, breadth, thickness, and duration&mdash;but the
  inertia of opinion, the impulse from the Levantine philosophers of the bronze
  age?"</p>

  <p>"Putting it that way," said the clergyman, "it does look as though there
  was a flaw somewhere in the notion of tridimensional being; but" ...He became
  silent, leaving that sufficiently eloquent "but" to convey all the prejudice
  and distrust that filled his mind.</p>

  <p>"When we take up this new light of a fourth dimension and reexamine our
  physical science in its illumination," continued Nebogipfel, after a pause,
  "we find ourselves no longer limited by hopeless restriction to a certain
  beat of time&mdash;to our own generation. Locomotion along lines of
  duration&mdash;chronic navigation comes within the range, first, of
  geometrical theory, and then of practical mechanics. There was a time when
  men could only move horizontally and in their appointed country. The clouds
  floated above them, unattainable things, mysterious chariots of those fearful
  gods who dwelt among the mountain summits. Speaking practically, men in those
  days were restricted to motion in two dimensions; and even there
  circumambient ocean and hypoborean fear bound him in. But those times were to
  pass away. First, the keel of Jason cut its way between the Symplegades, and
  then in the fulness of time, Columbus dropped anchor in a bay of Atlantis.
  Then man burst his bidimensional limits, and invaded the third dimension,
  soaring with Montgolfier into the clouds, and sinking with a diving bell into
  the purple treasure-caves of the waters. And now another step, and the hidden
  past and unknown future are before us. We stand upon a mountain summit with
  the plains of the ages spread below."</p>

  <p>Nebogipfel paused and looked down at his hearer.</p>

  <p>The Reverend Elijah Cook was sitting with an expression of strong distrust
  on his face. Preaching much had brought home certain truths to him very
  vividly, and he always suspected rhetoric. "Are those things figures of
  speech," he asked; "or am I to take them as precise statements? Do you speak
  of travelling through time in the same way as one might speak of Omnipotence
  making His pathway on the storm, or do you&mdash;a&mdash;mean what you
  say?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Nebogipfel smiled quietly. "Come and look at these diagrams," he said,
  and then with elaborate simplicity he commenced to explain again to the
  clergyman the new quadridimensional geometry. Insensibly Cook's aversion
  passed away, and seeming impossibility grew possible, now that such tangible
  things as diagrams and models could be brought forward in evidence. Presently
  he found himself asking questions, and his interest grew deeper and deeper as
  Nebogipfel slowly and with precise clearness unfolded the beautiful order of
  his strange invention. The moments slipped away unchecked, as the Doctor
  passed on to the narrative of his research, and it was with a start of
  surprise that the clergyman noticed the deep blue of the dying twilight
  through the open doorway.</p>

  <p>"The voyage," said Nebogipfel concluding his history, "will be full of
  undreamt-of dangers&mdash;already in one brief essay I have stood in the very
  jaws of death&mdash;but it is also full of the divines' promise of undreamt-
  of joy. Will you come? Will you walk among the people of the Golden
  Years?..."</p>

  <p>But the mention of death by the philosopher had brought flooding back to
  the mind of Cook, all the horrible sensations of that first apparition.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Nebogipfel...one question?" He hesitated. "On your hands...Was it
  blood?"</p>

  <p>Nebogipfel's countenance fell. He spoke slowly.</p>

  <p>"When I had stopped my machine, I found myself in this room as it used to
  be. Hark!"</p>

  <p>"It is the wind in the trees towards Rwstog."</p>

  <p>"It sounded like the voices of a multitude of people singing... when I had
  stopped I found myself in this room as it used to be. An old man, a young
  man, and a lad were sitting at a table&mdash;reading some book together. I
  stood behind them unsuspected. 'Evil spirits assailed him,' read the old man;
  'but it is written, to him that overcometh shall be given life eternal'. They
  came as entreating friends, but he endured through all their snares. They
  came as principalities and powers, but he defied them in the name of the King
  of Kings. Once even it is told that in his study, while he was translating
  the New Testament into German, the Evil One himself appeared before him...'
  Just then the lad glanced timorously round, and with a fearful wail fainted
  away..."</p>

  <p>"The others sprang at me...It was a fearful grapple...The old man clung to
  my throat, screaming 'Man or Devil, I defy thee...'</p>

  <p>"I could not help it. We rolled together on the floor...the knife his
  trembling son had dropped came to my hand...Hark!"</p>

  <p>He paused and listened, but Cook remained staring at him in the same
  horror-stricken attitude he had assumed when the memory of the blood-stained
  hands had rushed back over his mind.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear what they are crying? Hark!"</p>

  <p>Burn the warlock! Burn the murderer!</p>

  <p>"Do you hear? There is no time to be lost."</p>

  <p>Slay the murderer of cripples. Kill the devil's claw!</p>

  <p>"Come! Come!"</p>

  <p>Cook, with a convulsive effort, made a gesture of repugnance and strode to
  the doorway. A crowd of black figures roaring towards him in the red
  torchlight made him recoil. He shut the door and faced Nebogipfel.</p>

  <p>The thin lips of the Doctor curled with a contemptuous sneer. "They will
  kill you if you stay," he said; and seizing his unresisting vistor by the
  wrist, he forced him towards the glittering machine. Cook sat down and
  covered his face with his hands.</p>

  <p>In another moment the door was flung open, and old Pritchard stood
  blinking on the threshold.</p>

  <p>A pause. A hoarse shout changing suddenly into a sharp shrill shriek.</p>

  <p>A thunderous roar like the bursting forth of a great fountain of
  water.</p>

  <p>The voyage of the Chronic Argonauts had begun.</p>

  <small>AN UNSYMPATHETIC LOVE STORY</small></a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Truth</i> magazine, March 8, 1894<br>
  Also published as "A Bardlet's Romance"</h3>

  <p>Of course the cultivated reader has heard of Aubrey Vair. He has published
  on three separate occasions, volumes of delicate verses&mdash;some, indeed,
  border on indelicacy&mdash;and his column, "Of Things Literary" in the
  Climax, is well known. His Byronic visage and an interview have appeared in
  the Perfect Lady. It was Aubrey Vair, I believe, who demonstrated that the
  humour of Dickens was worse than his sentiment, and who detected "a subtle
  bourgeois flavour" in Shakespeare. However, it is not generally known that
  Aubrey Vair has had erotic experiences as well as erotic inspirations. He
  adopted Goethe some little time since as his literary prototype, and that may
  have had something to do with his temporary lapse from sexual integrity.</p>

  <p>For it is one of the commonest things that undermine literary men, giving
  us landslips and picturesque effects along the otherwise even cliff of their
  respectable life, ranking next to avarice, and certainly above drink, this
  instability called genius, or more fully, the consciousness of genius, such
  as Aubrey Vair possessed. Since Shelley set the fashion, your man of gifts
  has been assured that his duty to himself and his duty to his wife are
  incompatible, and his renunciation of the Philistine has been marked by such
  infidelity as his means and courage warranted. Most virtue is lack of
  imagination. At any rate, a minor genius without his affections twisted into
  an inextricable muddle, and who did not occasionally shed sonnets over his
  troubles, I have never met.</p>

  <p>Even Aubrey Vair did this, weeping the sonnets overnight into his
  blotting-book, and pretending to write literary causerie when his wife came
  down in her bath slippers to see what kept him up. She did not understand
  him, of course. He did this before the other woman appeared, so ingrained is
  conjugal treachery in the talented mind. Indeed, he wrote more sonnets before
  the other woman came than after that event, because thereafter he spent much
  of his leisure in cutting down the old productions, retrimming them, and
  generally altering this ready-made clothing of his passion to suit her
  particular height and complexion.</p>

  <p>Aubrey Vair lived in a little red villa with a lawn at the back and a view
  of the Downs behind Reigate. He lived upon discreet investment eked out by
  literary work. His wife handsome, sweet, and gentle, and&mdash;such is the
  tender humility of good married women&mdash;she found her life's happiness in
  seeing that little Aubrey Vair had well cooked variety for dinner, and that
  their house was the neatest and brightest of all the houses they entered.
  Aubrey Vair enjoyed the dinners, and was proud of the house, yet nevertheless
  he mourned because his genius dwindled. Moreover, he grew plump, and
  corpulence threatened him.</p>

  <p>We learn in suffering what we teach in song, and Aubrey Vair knew
  certainly that his soul could give no creditable crops unless his affections
  were harrowed. And how to harrow them was the trouble, for Reigate is a moral
  neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>So Aubrey Vair's romantic longings blew loose for a time, much as a
  seedling creeper might, planted in the midst of a flower-bed. But at last, in
  the fulness of time, the other woman came to the embrace of Aubrey Vair's
  yearning heart-tendrils, and his romantic episode proceeded as is here
  faithfully written down.</p>

  <p>The other woman was really a girl, and Aubrey Vair met her first at a
  tennis party at Redhill. Aubrey Vair did not play tennis after the accident
  to Miss Morton's eye, and because latterly it made him pant and get warmer
  and moister than even a poet should be; and this young lady had only recently
  arrived in England, and could not play. So they gravitated into the two
  vacant basket chairs beside Mrs. Bayne's deaf aunt, in front of the
  hollyhocks, and were presently talking at their ease together.</p>

  <p>The other woman's name was unpropitious&mdash;, Miss Smith&mdash;, but you
  would never have suspected it from her face and costume. Her parentage was
  promising, she was an orphan, her mother was a Hindoo, and her father an
  Indian civil servant; and Aubrey Vair&mdash;himself a happy mixture of Kelt
  and Teuton, as indeed, all literary men have to be nowadays&mdash;naturally
  believed in the literary consequences of a mixture of races. She was dressed
  in white. She had finely moulded pale features, great depth of expression,
  and a cloud of delicately frise black hair over her dark eyes, and she looked
  at Aubrey Vair with a look half curious and half shy, that contrasted
  admirably with the stereotyped frankness of your common Reigate girl.</p>

  <p>"This is a splendid lawn&mdash;the best in Redhill," said Aubrey Vair in
  the course of the conversation; "and I like it all the better because the
  daisies are spared." He indicated the daisies with a graceful sweep of his
  rather elegant hand.</p>

  <p>"They are sweet little flowers," said the lady in white, "and I have
  always associated them with England, chiefly perhaps, through a picture I saw
  'over there' when I was very little, of children making daisy chains. I
  promised myself that pleasure when I came home. But, alas! I feel now rather
  too large for such delights."</p>

  <p>"I do not see why we should not be able to enjoy these simple pleasures as
  we grow older&mdash;why our growth should have in it so much forgetting. For
  my own part&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Has your wife got Jane's recipe for stuffing trout?" asked Mrs. Bayne's
  deaf aunt abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I really don't know," said Aubrey Vair.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said Mrs. Bayne's deaf aunt. "It ought to please even
  you."</p>

  <p>"Anything will please me," said Aubrey Vair; "I care very
  little&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's a lovely dish," said Mrs. Bayne's deaf aunt, and relapsed into
  contemplation.</p>

  <p>"I was saying," said Aubrey Vair, "that I think I still find my keenest
  pleasures in childish pastimes. I have a little nephew that I see a great
  deal of, and when we fly kites together, I am sure it would be hard to tell
  which of us is the happier. By the bye, you should get at your daisy chains
  in that way. Beguile some little girl."</p>

  <p>"But I did. I took that Morton mite for a walk in the meadows, and timidly
  broached the subject. And she reproached me suggesting 'frivolous pursuits.'
  It was a horrible disappointment."</p>

  <p>"The governess here," said Aubrey Vair, "is robbing that child of its
  youth in a terrible way. What will a life be that has no childhood at the
  beginning?"</p>

  <p>"Some human beings are never young," he continued, "and they never grow
  up. They lead absolutely colourless lives. They are&mdash;they are etiolated.
  They never love, and never feel the loss of it. They are&mdash;for the moment
  I can think of no better image&mdash;they are human flower-pots, in which no
  soul has been planted. But a human soul properly growing must begin in a
  fresh childishness."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the dark lady thoughtfully, "a careless childhood, running
  wild almost. That should be the beginning."</p>

  <p>"Then we pass through the wonder and diffidence of youth."</p>

  <p>"To strength and action," said the dark lady. Her dreamy eyes were fixed
  on the Downs, and her fingers tightened on her knees as she spoke. "Ah, it is
  a grand thing to live&mdash;as a man does&mdash;self-reliant and free."</p>

  <p>"And so at last," said Aubrey Vair, "come to the culmination and crown of
  life." He paused and glanced hastily at her. Then he dropped his voice almost
  to a whisper&mdash;"And the culmination of life is love."</p>

  <p>Their eyes met for a moment, but she looked away at once. Aubrey Vair felt
  a peculiar thrill and a catching in his breath, but his emotions were too
  complex for analysis. He had a certain sense of surprise also, at the way his
  conversation had developed.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bayne's deaf aunt suddenly dug him in the chest with her ear-
  trumpet, and someone at tennis bawled, "Love all!"</p>

  <p>"Did I tell you Jane's girls have had scarlet fever?" asked Mrs. Bayne's
  deaf aunt.</p>

  <p>"No," said Aubrey Vair.</p>

  <p>"Yes; and they are peeling now," said Mrs. Bayne's deaf aunt, shutting her
  lips tightly, and nodding in a slow, significant manner at both of them.</p>

  <p>There was a pause. All three seemed lost in thought, too deep for
  words.</p>

  <p>"Love," began Aubrey Vair presently, in a severely philosophical tone,
  leaning back in his chair, holding his hands like a praying saint's in front
  of him, and staring at the toe of his shoe&mdash;, "love is, I believe, the
  one true and real thing in life. It rises above reason, interest, or
  explanation. Yet I never read of an age when it was so much forgotten as it
  is now. Never was love expected to run so much in appointed channels, never
  was it so despised, checked, ordered, and obstructed. Policeman say, 'This
  way, Eros!' As a result, we relieve our emotional possibilities in the hunt
  for gold and notoriety. And after all, with the best fortune in these, we
  only hold up the glided images of our success, and are weary slaves, with
  unsatisfied hearts, in the pageant of life."</p>

  <p>Aubrey Vair sighed, and there was a pause. The girl looked at him out of
  the mysterious darkness of her eyes. She had read many books, but Aubrey Vair
  was her first literary man, and she took this kind of thing for
  genius&mdash;as girls have done before.</p>

  <p>"We are," continued Aubrey Vair, conscious of a favourable impression
  &mdash;, "we are like fireworks, mere dead, inert things until the appointed
  spark comes; and then&mdash;if it is not damp&mdash;the dormant soul blazes
  forth in all its warmth and beauty. That is living. I sometimes think, do you
  know, that we should be happier if we could die soon after that golden time,
  like the Ephemerides. There is a decay sets in."</p>

  <p>"Eigh?" said Mrs. Bayne's deaf aunt startlingly. "I didn't hear you."</p>

  <p>"I was on the point of remarking," shouted Aubrey Vair, wheeling the array
  of his thoughts&mdash;, "I was on the point of remarking that few people in
  Redhill could match Mrs. Morton's fine broad green."</p>

  <p>"Others have noticed it." Mrs. Bayne's deaf aunt shouted back. "It is
  since she has had in her new false teeth."</p>

  <p>This interruption dislocated the conversation a little. However&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I must thank you, Mr. Vair," said the dark girl, when they parted that
  afternoon, "for having given me very much to think about."</p>

  <p>And from her manner, Aubrey Vair perceived clearly he had not wasted his
  time.</p>

  <p>It would require a subtler pen than mine to tell how from that day a
  passion for Miss Smith grew like Jonah's gourd in the heart of Aubrey Vair.
  He became pensive, and in the prolonged absence of Miss Smith, irritable.
  Mrs. Aubrey Vair felt the change in him, and put it down to vitriolic
  Saturday Reviewer. Indisputably the Saturday does at times go a little far.
  He re-read Elective Affinities, and lent it to Miss Smith. Incredible as it
  may appear to members of the Areopagus Club, where we know Aubrey Vair, he
  did also beyond all question inspire a sort of passion in that sombre-eyed,
  rather clever, and really very beautiful girl.</p>

  <p>He talked to her a lot about love and destiny, and all that bric-a-brac of
  the minor poet. And they talked together about his genius. He elaborately,
  though discreetly, sought her society, and presented and read to her the
  milder of his unpublished sonnets. We consider his Byronic features pasty,
  but the feminine mind has its own laws. I suppose, also where a girl is not a
  fool, a literary man has an enormous advantage over anyone but a preacher, in
  the show he can make of his heart's wares.</p>

  <p>At last a day in that summer came when he met her alone, possibly by
  chance, in a quiet lane towards Horley. There were ample hedges on either
  side, rich with honeysuckle, vetch, and mullein.</p>

  <p>They conversed intimately of his poetic ambitions, and then he read her
  those verses of his subsequently published in 'Hobson's Magazine': "Tenderly
  ever, since I have met thee." He had written these the day before; and though
  I think the sentiment is uncommonly trite, there is a redeeming note of
  sincerity about the lines not conspicuous in all Aubrey Vair's poetry.</p>

  <p>He read rather well, and a swell of genuine emotion crept into his voice
  as he read, with one white hand thrown out to point the rhythm of the lines.
  "Ever, my sweet, for thee," he concluded, looking up into her face.</p>

  <p>Before he looked up, he had been thinking chiefly of his poem and its
  effect. Straightway he forgot it. Her arms hung limply before her, and her
  hands were clasped together. Her eyes were very tender.</p>

  <p>"Your verses go to the heart," she said softly.</p>

  <p>Her mobile features were capable of wonderful shades of expression. He
  suddenly forgot his wife and his position as a minor poet as he looked at
  her. It is possible that his classical features may themselves have undergone
  a certain transfiguration. For one brief moment&mdash;and it was always to
  linger in his memory&mdash;destiny lifted him out of his vain little self to
  a nobler level of simplicity. The copy of "Tenderly ever" fluttered from his
  hand. Considerations vanished. Only one thing seemed of importance.</p>

  <p>"I love you," he said abruptly.</p>

  <p>An expression of fear came into her eyes. The grip of her hands upon one
  another tightened convulsively. She became very pale.</p>

  <p>Then she moved her lips as if to speak, bringing her face slightly nearer
  to his. There was nothing in the world at that moment for either of them but
  one another. They were both trembling exceedingly. In a whisper she said,
  "You love me?"</p>

  <p>Aubrey Vair stood quivering and speechless, looking into her eyes. He
  never seen such a light as he saw there before. He was in a wild tumult of
  emotion. He was dreadfully scared at what he had done. He could not say
  another word. He nodded.</p>

  <p>"And this has come to me?" she said presently, in the same awe-stricken
  whisper, and then, "Oh, my love, my love!"</p>

  <p>And thereupon Aubrey Vair had her clasped to himself, her cheek upon his
  shoulder and his lips to hers.</p>

  <p>Thus it was that Aubrey Vair came by the cardinal memory of his life. To
  this day it recurs in his works.</p>

  <p>A little boy clambering in the hedge some way down the lane saw this group
  with surprise, and then with scorn and contempt. Reckoning nothing of his
  destiny, he turned away feeling that he at least could never come to the
  unspeakable unmanliness of hugging girls. Unhappily for Reigate scandal, his
  shame for his sex was altogether too deep for words.</p>

  <p>An hour after, Aubrey Vair returned home in a hushed mood. There were
  muffins after his own heart for his tea&mdash;Mrs. Aubrey Vair had, had hers.
  And there were chrysanthemums, chiefly white ones&mdash;, flowers he loved
  &mdash;, set out in the china bowl he was wont to praise. And his wife came
  behind him to kiss him as he sat eating.</p>

  <p>"De lill Jummuns," she remarked, kissing him under the ear.</p>

  <p>Then it came into the mind of Aubrey Vair with startling clearness, while
  his ear was being kissed, and with his mouth full of muffin, that life is a
  singularly complex thing.</p>

  <p>The summer passed at last into the harvest-time, and the leaves began
  falling. It was evening, the warm sunset light still touched the Downs, but
  up the valley a blue haze was creeping. One or two lamps in Reigate were
  already alight.</p>

  <p>About halfway up the slanting road that scales the Downs, there is a
  wooden seat where one may obtain a fine view of the red villas scattered
  below, and of the succession of blue hills beyond. Here the girl with the
  shadowy face was sitting.</p>

  <p>She had a book on her knees, but it lay neglected. She was leaning
  forward, her chin resting upon her hand, She was looking across the valley
  into the darkening sky, with troubled eyes.</p>

  <p>Aubrey Vair appeared through the hazel-bushes, and sat down beside her. He
  held half a dozen dead leaves in his hand.</p>

  <p>She did not alter her attitude. "Well?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Is it to be flight?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Aubrey Vair was rather pale. He had been having bad nights latterly, with
  dreams of the Continental Express, Mrs. Aubrey Vair possibly even in pursuit
  &mdash;, he always fancied her making the tragedy, ridiculous by tearfully
  bringing additional pairs of socks, and any such trifles he had forgotten,
  with her&mdash;, all Reigate and Redhill in commotion. He had never eloped
  before, and he had visions of difficulties with hotel proprietors. Mrs.
  Aubrey Vair might telegraph ahead. Even he had, had a prophetic vision of a
  headline in a halfpenny evening newspaper: "Young Lady abducts a Minor Poet."
  So there was a quaver in his voice as he asked, "Is it to be flight?"</p>

  <p>"As you will," she answered, still not looking at him.</p>

  <p>"I want you to consider particularly how this will affect you. A man,"
  said Aubrey Vair, slowly, and staring hard at the leaves in his hand, "even
  gains a certain eclat in these affairs. But to a woman it is
  ruin&mdash;social, moral."</p>

  <p>"This is not love," said the girl in white.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my dearest! Think of yourself."</p>

  <p>"Stupid!" she said, under her breath.</p>

  <p>"You spoke?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"But cannot we go on, meeting one another, loving one another, without any
  great scandal or misery? Could we not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That," interrupted Miss Smith, "would be unspeakably horrible."</p>

  <p>"This is a dreadful conversation to me. Life is so intricate, such a web
  of subtle strands binds us this way and that. I cannot tell what is right.
  You must consider&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A man would break such strands."</p>

  <p>"There is no manliness," said Aubrey Vair, with a sudden glow of moral
  exaltation, "in doing wrong. My love&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We could at least die together, dearest," she said.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" said Aubrey Vair. "I mean&mdash;consider my wife."</p>

  <p>"You have not considered her hitherto."</p>

  <p>"There is a flavour&mdash;of cowardice, of desertion, about suicide," said
  Aubrey Vair. "Frankly, I have the English prejudice, and do not like any kind
  of running away."</p>

  <p>Miss Smith smiled very faintly. "I see clearly now what I did not see. My
  love and yours are very different things."</p>

  <p>"Possibly it is a sexual difference," said Aubrey Vair; and then, feeling
  the remark inadequate, he relapsed into silence.</p>

  <p>They sat for some time without a word. The two lights in Reigate below
  multiplied to a score of bright points, and above, one star had become
  visible. She began laughing, an almost noiseless, hysterical laugh that
  jarred unaccountably upon Aubrey Vair.</p>

  <p>Presently she stood up. "They will wonder where I am," she said. "I think
  I must be going."</p>

  <p>He followed her to the road. "Then this is the end?" he said, with a
  curious mixture of relief and poignant regret.</p>

  <p>"Yes, this is the end," she answered, and turned away.</p>

  <p>There straightway dropped into the soul of Aubrey Vair a sense of infinite
  loss. It was an altogether new sensation. She was perhaps twenty yards away,
  when he groaned aloud with the weight of it, and suddenly began running after
  her with his arms extended.</p>

  <p>"Annie," he cried&mdash;, "Annie! I have been talking rot. Annie, now I
  know I love you! I cannot spare you. This must not be. I did not
  understand."</p>

  <p>The weight was horrible.</p>

  <p>"Oh, stop, Annie!" he cried, with a breaking voice, and there were tears
  on his face.</p>

  <p>She turned upon him suddenly, and his arms fell by his side. His
  expression changed at the sight of her pale face.</p>

  <p>"You do not understand," she said. "I have said good-bye."</p>

  <p>She looked at him; he was evidently greatly distressed, a little out of
  breath, and he had just stopped blubbering. His contemptible quality reached
  the pathetic. She came up close to him, and taking his damp Byronic visage
  between her hands, she kissed him again and again. "Good-bye, little man that
  I loved," she said; "and good-bye to this folly of love."</p>

  <p>Then, with something that may have been a laugh or a sob&mdash;, she
  herself, when she came to write it all in her novel, did not know
  which&mdash;, she turned and hurried away again, and went out of the path
  that Aubrey Vair must pursue, at the cross-roads.</p>

  <p>Aubrey Vair stood, where she had kissed him, with a mind as inactive as
  his body, until her white dress had disappeared. Then he gave an involuntary
  sigh, a large exhaustive expiration, and so awoke himself, and began walking,
  pensively dragging his feet through the dead leaves, home. Emotions are
  terrible things.</p>

  <p>"Do you like the potatoes, dear?" asked Mrs. Aubrey Vair at dinner. "I
  cooked them myself."</p>

  <p>Aubrey Vair descended slowly from cloudy, impalpable meditations to the
  level of fried potatoes. "These potatoes&mdash;" he remarked, after a pause
  during which he was struggling with recollection. "Yes. These potatoes have
  exactly the tints of the dead leaves of the hazel."</p>

  <p>"What a fanciful poet it is!" said Mrs. Aubrey Vair. "Taste them. They are
  very nice potatoes indeed."</p>

     name="story03">THE TRIUMPHS OF A TAXIDERMIST</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, March 3, 1894</h3>

  <p>Here are some of the secrets of taxidermy. They were told me by the
  taxidermist in a mood of elation. He told me them in the time between the
  first glass of whisky and the fourth, when a man is no longer cautious and
  yet not drunk. We sat in his den together; his library it was, his sitting
  and his eating-room&mdash;separated by a bead curtain, so far as the sense of
  sight went, from the noisome den where he plied his trade.</p>

  <p>He sat on a deck chair, and when he was not tapping refractory bits of
  coal with them, he kept his feet&mdash;on which he wore, after the manner of
  sandals, the holy relics of a pair of carpet slippers&mdash;out of the way
  upon the mantel-piece, among the glass eyes. And his trousers, by-the-by
  &mdash;though they have nothing to do with his triumphs&mdash;were a most
  horrible yellow plaid, such as they made when our fathers wore side-whiskers
  and there were crinolines in the land. Further, his hair was black, his face
  rosy, and his eye a fiery brown; and his coat was chiefly of grease upon a
  basis of velveteen. And his pipe had a bowl of china showing the Graces, and
  his spectacles were always askew, the left eye glaring nakedly at you, small
  and penetrating; the right, seen through a glass darkly, magnified and mild.
  Thus his discourse ran: "There never was a man who could stuff like me,
  Bellows, never. I have stuffed elephants and I have stuffed moths, and the
  things have looked all the livelier and better for it. And I have stuffed
  human beings&mdash;chiefly amateur ornithologists. But I stuffed a nigger
  once.</p>

  <p>"No, there is no law against it. I made him with all his fingers out and
  used him as a hat-rack, but that fool Homersby got up a quarrel with him late
  one night and spoilt him. That was before your time. It is hard to get skins,
  or I would have another.</p>

  <p>"Unpleasant? I don't see it. Seems to me taxidermy is a promising third
  course to burial or cremation. You could keep all your dear ones by you.
  Bric-a-brac of that sort stuck about the house would be as good as most
  company, and much less expensive. You might have them fitted up with
  clockwork to do things.</p>

  <p>"Of course they would have to be varnished, but they need not shine more
  than lots of people do naturally. Old Manningtree's bald head... Anyhow, you
  could talk to them without interruption. Even aunts. There is a great future
  before taxidermy, depend upon it. There is fossils again..."</p>

  <p>He suddenly became silent.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think I ought to tell you that." He sucked at his pipe
  thoughtfully. "Thanks, yes. Not too much water.</p>

  <p>"Of course, what I tell you now will go no further. You know I have made
  some dodos and a great auk? No! Evidently you are an amateur at taxidermy. My
  dear fellow, half the great auks in the world are about as genuine as the
  handkerchief of Saint Veronica, as the Holy Coat of Treves. We make 'em of
  grebes' feathers and the like. And the great auk's eggs too!"</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, we make them out of fine porcelain. I tell you it is worth while.
  They fetch&mdash;one fetched L300 only the other day. That one was really
  genuine, I believe, but of course one is never certain. It is very fine work,
  and afterwards you have to get them dusty, for no one who owns one of these
  precious eggs has ever the temerity to clean the thing. That's the beauty of
  the business. Even if they suspect an egg they do not like to examine it too
  closely. It's such brittle capital at the best.</p>

  <p>"You did not know that taxidermy rose to heights like that. My boy, it has
  risen higher. I have rivalled the hands of Nature herself. One of the
  <i>genuine</i> great auks"&mdash;his voice fell to a whisper&mdash;one of the
  <i>genuine</i> great auks <i>was made by me</i>."</p>

  <p>"No. You must study ornithology, and find out which it is yourself. And
  what is more, I have been approached by a syndicate of dealers to stock one
  of the unexplored skerries to the north of Iceland with specimens. I
  may&mdash;some day. But I have another little thing in hand just now. Ever
  heard of the dinornis?</p>

  <p>"It is one of those big birds recently extinct in New Zealand. 'Moa' is
  its common name, so called because extinct: there is no moa now. See? Well,
  they have got bones of it, and from some of the marshes even feathers and
  dried bits of skin. Now, I am going to&mdash;well, there is no need to make
  any bones about it&mdash;going to <i>forge</i> a complete stuffed moa. I know
  a chap out there who will pretend to make the find in a kind of antiseptic
  swamp, and say he stuffed it at once, as it threatened to fall to pieces. The
  feathers are peculiar, but I have got a simply lovely way of dodging up
  singed bits of ostrich plume. Yes, that is the new smell you noticed. They
  can only discover the fraud with a microscope, and they will hardly care to
  pull a nice specimen to bits for that.</p>

  <p>"In this way, you see, I give my little push in the advancement of
  science.</p>

  <p>"But all this is merely imitating Nature. I have done more than that in my
  time. I have&mdash;beaten her."</p>

  <p>He took his feet down from the mantel-board, and leant over confidentially
  towards me. "I have <i>created</i> birds," he said in a low voice.
  "<i>New</i> birds. Improvements. Like no birds that was ever seen
  before."</p>

  <p>He resumed his attitude during an impressive silence.</p>

  <p>"Enrich the universe; <i>rath</i>-er. Some of the birds I made were new
  kinds of humming birds, and very beautiful little things, but some of them
  were simply rum. The rummest, I think, was the <i>Anomalopteryx Jejuna.
  Jejunus-a-um</i>&mdash;empty&mdash;so called because there was really nothing
  in it; a thoroughly empty bird&mdash;except for stuffing. Old Javvers has the
  thing now, and I suppose he is almost as proud of it as I am. It is a
  masterpiece, Bellows. It has all the silly clumsiness of your pelican, all
  the solemn want of dignity of your parrot, all the gaunt ungainliness of a
  flamingo, with all the extravagant chromatic conflict of a mandarin duck.
  <i>Such</i> a bird. I made it out of the skeletons of a stork and a toucan
  and a job lot of feathers. Taxidermy of that kind is just pure joy, Bellows,
  to a real artist in the art.</p>

  <p>"How did I come to make it? Simple enough, as all great inventions are.
  One of those young genii who write us Science Notes in the papers got hold of
  a German pamphlet about the birds of New Zealand, and translated some of it
  by means of a dictionary and his mother-wit&mdash;he must have been one of a
  very large family with a small mother&mdash;and he got mixed between the
  living apteryx and the extinct anomalopteryx; talked about a bird five feet
  high, living in the jungles of the North Island, rare, shy, specimens
  difficult to obtain, and so on. Javvers, who even for a collector, is a
  miraculously ignorant man, read these paragraphs, and swore he would have the
  thing at any price. Raided the dealers with enquiries. It shows what a man
  can do by persistence&mdash;will-power. Here was a bird-collector swearing he
  would have a specimen of a bird that did not exist, that never had existed,
  and which for very shame of its own profane ungainliness, probably would not
  exist now if it could help itself. And he got it. <i>He got it</i>."</p>

  <p>"Have some more whisky, Bellows?" said the taxidermist, rousing himself
  from a transient contemplation of the mysteries of will-power and the
  collecting turn of mind. And, replenished, he proceeded to tell me of how he
  concocted a most attractive mermaid, and how an itinerant preacher, who could
  not get an audience because of it, smashed it because it was idolatry, or
  worse, at Burslem Wakes. But as the conversation of all the parties to this
  transaction, creator, would-be preserver, and destroyer, was uniformly unfit
  for publication, this cheerful incident must still remain unprinted.</p>

  <p>The reader unacquainted with the dark ways of the collector may perhaps be
  inclined to doubt my taxidermist, but so far as great auks' eggs, and the
  bogus stuffed birds are concerned, I find that he has the confirmation of
  distinguished ornithological writers. And the note about the New Zealand bird
  certainly appeared in a morning paper of unblemished reputation, for the
  Taxidermist keeps a copy and has shown it to me.</p>

     name="story04">THE STOLEN BACILLUS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, June 21, 1894</h3>

  <p>"This again," said the Bacteriologist, slipping a glass slide under the
  microscope, "is well,&mdash;a preparation of the Bacillus of
  cholera&mdash;the cholera germ."</p>

  <p>The pale-faced man peered down the microscope. He was evidently not
  accustomed to that kind of thing, and held a limp white hand over his
  disengaged eye. "I see very little," he said.</p>

  <p>"Touch this screw," said the Bacteriologist; "perhaps the microscope is
  out of focus for you. Eyes vary so much. Just the fraction of a turn this way
  or that."</p>

  <p>"Ah! now I see," said the visitor. "Not so very much to see after all.
  Little streaks and shreds of pink. And yet those little particles, those mere
  atomies, might multiply and devastate a city! Wonderful!"</p>

  <p>He stood up, and releasing the glass slip from the microscope, held it in
  his hand towards the window. "Scarcely visible," he said, scrutinising the
  preparation. He hesitated. "Are these&mdash;alive? Are they dangerous
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Those have been stained and killed," said the Bacteriologist. "I wish,
  for my own part, we could kill and stain every one of them in the
  universe."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," the pale man said, with a slight smile, 'that you scarcely
  care to have such things about you in the living&mdash;in the active
  state?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, we are obliged to," said the Bacteriologist. "Here, for
  instance&mdash;" He walked across the room and took up one of several sealed
  tubes. "Here is the living thing. This is a cultivation of the actual living
  disease bacteria." He hesitated. "Bottled cholera, so to speak."</p>

  <p>A slight gleam of satisfaction appeared momentarily in the face of the
  pale man. "It's a deadly thing to have in your possession," he said,
  devouring the little tube with his eyes. The Bacteriologist watched the
  morbid pleasure in his visitor's expression. This man, who had visited him
  that afternoon with a note of introduction from an old friend, interested him
  from the very contrast of their dispositions. The lank black hair and deep
  grey eyes, the haggard expression and nervous manner, the fitful yet keen
  interest of his visitor were a novel change from the phlegmatic deliberations
  of the ordinary scientific worker with whom the Bacteriologist chiefly
  associated. It was perhaps natural, with a hearer evidently so impressionable
  to the lethal nature of; his topic, to take the most effective aspect of the
  matter.</p>

  <p>He held the tube in his hand thoughtfully. "Yes, here is the pestilence
  imprisoned. Only break such a little tube as this into a supply of drinking-
  water, say to these minute particles of life that one must needs stain and
  examine with the highest powers of the microscope even to see, and that one
  can neither smell nor taste&mdash;say to them, 'Go forth, increase and
  multiply, and replenish the cisterns,' and death&mdash;mysterious,
  untraceable death, death swift and terrible, death full of pain and
  indignity&mdash;would be released upon this city, and go hither and thither
  seeking his victims. Here he would take the husband from the wife, here the
  child from its mother, here the statesman from his duty, and here the toiler
  from his trouble. He would follow the water-mains, creeping along streets,
  picking out and punishing a house here and a house there where they did not
  boil their drinking-water, creeping into the wells of the mineral water
  makers, getting washed into salad, and lying dormant in ices. He would wait
  ready to be drunk in the horse-troughs, and by unwary children in the public
  fountains. He would soak into the soil, to reappear in springs and wells at a
  thousand unexpected places. Once start him at the water supply, and before we
  could ring him in, and catch him again, he would have decimated the
  metropolis."</p>

  <p>He stopped abruptly. He had been told rhetoric was his weakness.</p>

  <p>"But he is quite safe here, you know&mdash;quite safe."</p>

  <p>The pale-faced man nodded. His eyes shone. He cleared his throat. "These
  Anarchist&mdash;rascals," said he, "are fools, blind fools&mdash;to use bombs
  when this kind of thing is attainable. I think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A gentle rap, a mere light touch of the finger-nails, was heard at the
  door. The Bacteriologist opened if. "Just a minute, dear," whispered his
  wife.</p>

  <p>When he re-entered the laboratory his visitor was looking at his watch. "I
  had no idea I had wasted an hour of your time," he said. "Twelve minutes to
  four. I ought to have left here by half-past three. But your things were
  really too interesting. No, positively I cannot stop a moment longer. I have
  an engagement at four."</p>

  <p>He passed out of the room reiterating his thanks, and the Bacteriologist
  accompanied him to the door, and then returned thoughtfully along the passage
  to his laboratory. He was musing on the ethnology of his visitor. Certainly
  the man was not a Teutonic type nor a common Latin one. "A morbid product,
  anyhow, I am afraid," said the Bacteriologist to himself. "How he gloated
  over those cultivations of disease germs!" A disturbing thought struck him.
  He turned to the bench by the vapour bath, and then very quickly to his
  writing-table. Then he felt hastily in his pockets and then rushed to the
  door. "I may have put it down on the hall table," he said.</p>

  <p>"Minnie!" he shouted hoarsely in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear," came a remote voice.</p>

  <p>"Had I anything in my hand when I spoke to you, dear, just now?"</p>

  <p>Pause.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, dear, because I remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Blue ruin!" cried the Bacteriologist, and incontinently ran to the front
  door and down the steps of his house to the street.</p>

  <p>Minnie, hearing the door slam violently, ran in alarm to the window. Down
  the street a slender man was getting into a cab. The Bacteriologist, hatless,
  and in his carpet slippers, was running and gesticulating wildly towards this
  group. One slipper came off, but he did not wait for it. "He has gone
  <i>mad</i>!" said Minnie; "it's that horrid science of his"; and, opening the
  window, would have called after him. The slender man, suddenly glancing
  round, seemed struck with the same idea of mental disorder. He pointed
  hastily to the Bacteriologist, said something to the cabman, the apron of the
  cab slammed, the whip swished, the horse's feet clattered, and in a moment
  cab and Bacteriologist hotly in pursuit, had receded up the vista of the
  roadway and disappeared round the corner.</p>

  <p>Minnie remained straining out of the window for a minute. Then she drew
  her head back into the room again. She was dumbfounded. "Of course he is
  eccentric," she meditated. "But running about London&mdash;in the height of
  the season, too&mdash;in his socks!" A happy thought struck her. She hastily
  put her bonnet on, seized his shoes, went into the hall, took down his hat
  and light overcoat from the pegs, emerged upon the doorstep, and hailed a cab
  that opportunely crawled by. "Drive me up the road and round Havelock
  Crescent, and see if we can find a gentleman running about in a velveteen
  coat and no hat."</p>

  <p>"Velveteen coat, ma'am, and no 'at. Very good, ma'am." And the cabman
  whipped up at once in the most matter-of-fact way, as if he drove to this
  address every day in his life.</p>

  <p>Some few minutes later the little group of cabmen and loafers that
  collects round the cabman's shelter at Haverstock Hill were startled by the
  passing of a cab with a ginger-coloured screw of a horse, driven
  furiously.</p>

  <p>They were silent as it went by, and then as it receded&mdash;"That's 'Arry
  'Icks. Wot's <i>he</i> got?" said the stout gentleman known as Old
  Tootles.</p>

  <p>"He's a-using his whip, he is, <i>to</i> rights," said the ostler boy.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" said poor old Tommy Byles; "here's another bloomin' loonatic.
  Blowed if there ain't."</p>

  <p>"It's old George," said Old Tootles, "and he's drivin' a loonatic,
  <i>as</i> you say. Ain't he a-clawin' out of the keb? Wonder if he's after
  'Arry 'Icks?"</p>

  <p>The group round the cabman's shelter became animated. Chorus: "Go it,
  George!" "It's a race." "You'll ketch 'em!" "Whip up!"</p>

  <p>"She's a goer, she is!" said the ostler boy.</p>

  <p>"Strike me giddy!" cried Old Tootles. "Here! <i>I'm</i> a-goin' to begin
  in a minute. Here's another comin'. If all the cabs in Hampstead ain't gone
  mad this morning!"</p>

  <p>"It's a fieldmale this time," said the ostler boy.</p>

  <p>"She's a-followin' <i>him</i>," said Old Tootles. "Usually the other way
  about."</p>

  <p>"What's she got in her 'and?"</p>

  <p>"Looks like a 'igh 'at."</p>

  <p>"What a bloomin' lark it is! Three to one on old George," said the ostler
  boy. "Nexst!"</p>

  <p>Minnie went by in a perfect roar of applause. She did not like it, but she
  felt that she was doing her duty, and whirled on down Haverstock Hill and
  Camden Town High Street with her eyes ever intent on the animated back view
  of old George, who was driving her vagrant husband so incomprehensibly away
  from her.</p>

  <p>The man in the foremost cab sat crouched in the corner, his arms tightly
  folded, and the little tube that contained such vast possibilities of
  destruction gripped in his hand. His mood was a singular mixture of fear and
  exultation. Chiefly he was afraid of being caught before he could accomplish
  his purpose, but behind this was a vaguer but larger fear of the awfulness of
  his crime. But his exultation far exceeded his fear. No Anarchist before him
  had ever approached this conception of his. Ravachol, Vaillant, all those
  distinguished persons whose fame he had envied dwindled into insignificance
  beside him. He had only to make sure of the water supply, and break the
  little tube into a reservoir. How brilliantly he had planned it, forged the
  letter of introduction and got into the laboratory, and how brilliantly he
  had seized his opportunity! The world should hear of him at last. All those
  people who had sneered at him, neglected him, preferred other people to him,
  found his company undesirable, should consider him at last. Death, death,
  death! They had always treated him as a man of no importance. All the world
  had been in a conspiracy to keep him under. He would teach them yet what it
  is to isolate a man. What was this familiar street? Great Saint Andrew's
  Street, of course! How fared the chase? He craned out of the cab. The
  Bacteriologist was scarcely fifty yards behind. That was bad. He would be
  caught and stopped yet. He felt in his pocket for money, and found half a
  sovereign. This he thrust up through the trap in the top of the cab into the
  man's face. "More," he shouted, "if only we get away."</p>

  <p>The money was snatched out of his hand. "Right you are," said the cabman,
  and the trap slammed, and the lash lay along the glistening side of the
  horse. The cab swayed, and the Anarchist, half-standing under the trap, put
  the hand containing the little glass tube upon the apron to preserve his
  balance. He felt the brittle thing crack, and the broken half of it rang upon
  the floor of the cab. He fell back into the seat with a curse, and stared
  dismally at the two or three drops of moisture on the apron.</p>

  <p>He shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose I shall be the first. <i>Phew!</i> Anyhow, I shall be a
  Martyr. That's something. But it is a filthy death, nevertheless. I wonder if
  it hurts as much as they say."</p>

  <p>Presently a thought occurred to him&mdash;he groped between his feet. A
  little drop was still in the broken end of the tube, and he drank that to
  make sure. It was better to make sure. At any rate, he would not fail.</p>

  <p>Then it dawned upon him that there was no further need to escape the
  Bacteriologist. In Wellington Street he told the cabman to stop, and got out.
  He slipped on the step, and his head felt queer. It was rapid stuff, this
  cholera poison. He waved his cabman out of existence, so to speak, and stood
  on the pavement with his arms folded upon his breast awaiting the arrival of
  the Bacteriologist. There was something tragic in his pose. The sense of
  imminent death gave him a certain dignity. He greeted his pursuer with a
  defiant laugh.</p>

  <p>"Vive l'Anarchie! You are too late, my friend, I have drunk it. The
  cholera is abroad!"</p>

  <p>The Bacteriologist from his cab beamed curiously at him through his
  spectacles. "You have drunk it! An Anarchist! I see now." He was about to say
  something more, and then checked himself. A smile hung in the corner of his
  mouth. He opened the apron of his cab as if to descend, at which the
  Anarchist waved him a dramatic farewell and strode off towards Waterloo
  Bridge, carefully jostling his infected body against as many people as
  possible. The Bacteriologist was so preoccupied with the vision of him that
  he scarcely manifested the slightest surprise at the appearance of Minnie
  upon the pavement with his hat and shoes and overcoat. "Very good of you to
  bring my things," he said, and remained lost in contemplation of the receding
  figure of the Anarchist.</p>

  <p>"You had better get in," he said, still staring. Minnie felt absolutely
  convinced now that he was mad, and directed the cabman home on her own
  responsibility. "Put on my shoes? Certainly, dear," said he, as the cab began
  to turn, and hid the strutting black figure, now small in the distance, from
  his eyes. Then suddenly something grotesque struck him, and he laughed. Then
  he remarked, "It is really very serious, though.</p>

  <p>"You see, that man came to my house to see me, and he is an Anarchist. No
  &mdash;don't faint, or I cannot possibly tell you the rest. And I wanted to
  astonish him, not knowing he was an Anarchist, and took up a cultivation of
  that new species of Bacterium I was telling you of that infest, and I think
  cause, the blue patches upon various monkeys; and, like a fool, I said it was
  Asiatic cholera. And he ran away with it to poison the water of London, and
  he certainly might have made things look blue for this civilised city. And
  now he has swallowed it. Of course, I cannot say what will happen, but you
  know it turned that kitten blue, and the three puppies&mdash;in patches, and
  the sparrow&mdash;bright blue. But the bother is, I shall have all the
  trouble and expense of preparing some more.</p>

  <p>"Put on my coat on this hot day! Why? Because we might meet Mrs. Jabber.
  My dear, Mrs. Jabber is not a draught. But why should I wear a coat on a hot
  day because of Mrs.&mdash;. Oh! <i>very</i> well."</p>

     name="story05">THE HAMMERPOND PARK BURGLARY</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, July 5, 1894</h3>

  <p>It is a moot point whether burglary is to be considered as a sport, a
  trade, or an art. For a trade, the technique is scarcely rigid enough, and
  its claims to be considered an art are vitiated by the mercenary element that
  qualifies its triumphs. On the whole it seems to be most justly ranked as
  sport, a sport for which no rules are at present formulated, and of which the
  prizes are distributed in an extremely informal manner. It was this
  informality of burglary that led to the regrettable extinction of two
  promising beginners at Hammerpond Park.</p>

  <p>The stakes offered in this affair consisted chiefly of diamonds and other
  personal <i>bric-a-brac</i> belonging to the newly married Lady Aveling. Lady
  Aveling, as the reader will remember, was the only daughter of Mrs Montague
  Pangs, the well-known hostess. Her marriage to Lord Aveling was extensively
  advertised in the papers, the quantity and quality of her wedding presents,
  and the fact that the honeymoon was to be spent at Hammerpond. The
  announcement of these valuable prizes created a considerable sensation in the
  small circle in which Mr Teddy Watkins was the undisputed leader, and it was
  decided that, accompanied by a duly qualified assistant, he should visit the
  village of Hammerpond in his professional capacity.</p>

  <p>Being a man of naturally retiring and modest disposition, Mr Watkins
  determined to make this visit <i>incog</i>., and after due consideration of
  the conditions of his enterprise, he selected the role of a landscape artist
  and the unassuming surname of Smith. He preceded his assistant, who, it was
  decided, should join him only on the last afternoon of his stay at
  Hammerpond. Now the village of Hammerpond is perhaps one of the prettiest
  little corners in Sussex; many thatched houses still survive, the flint-built
  church with its tall spire nestling under the down is one of the finest and
  least restored in the county, and the beech-woods and bracken jungles through
  which the road runs to the great house are singularly rich in what the vulgar
  artist and photographer call "bits." So that Mr Watkins, on his arrival with
  two virgin canvases, a brand-new easel, a paint-box, portmanteau, an
  ingenious little ladder made in sections (after the pattern of the late
  lamented master Charles Peace), crowbar, and wire coils, found himself
  welcomed with effusion and some curiosity by half-a-dozen other brethren of
  the brush. It rendered the disguise he had chosen unexpectedly plausible, but
  it inflicted upon him a considerable amount of aesthetic conversation for
  which he was very imperfectly prepared.</p>

  <p>"Have you exhibited very much?" said Young Person in the bar-parlour of
  the "Coach and Horses," where Mr Watkins was skilfully accumulating local
  information on the night of his arrival.</p>

  <p>"Very little," said Mr Watkins, "just a snack here and there."</p>

  <p>"Academy?"</p>

  <p>"In course. <i>And</i> the Crystal Palace."</p>

  <p>"Did they hang you well?" said Porson.</p>

  <p>"Don't rot," said Mr Watkins; "I don't like it."</p>

  <p>"I mean did they put you in a good place?"</p>

  <p>"Whadyer mean?" said Mr Watkins suspiciously. "One 'ud think you were
  trying to make out I'd been put away."</p>

  <p>Porson had been brought up by aunts, and was a gentlemanly young man even
  for an artist; he did not know what being "put away" meant, but he thought it
  best to explain that he intended nothing of the sort. As the question of
  hanging seemed a sore point with Mr Watkins, he tried to divert the
  conversation a little.</p>

  <p>"Do you do figure-work at all?"</p>

  <p>"No, never had a head for figures," said Mr Watkins, "my miss&mdash;Mrs
  Smith, I mean, does all that."</p>

  <p>"She paints too!" said Porson. "That's rather jolly."</p>

  <p>"Very," said Mr Watkins, though he really did not think so, and, feeling
  the conversation was drifting a little beyond his grasp, added, "I came down
  here to paint Hammerpond House by moonlight."</p>

  <p>"Really!" said Porson. "That's rather a novel idea."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr Watkins, "I thought it rather a good notion when it
  occurred to me. I expect to begin to-morrow night."</p>

  <p>"What! You don't mean to paint in the open, by night?"</p>

  <p>"I do, though."</p>

  <p>"But how will you see your canvas?"</p>

  <p>"Have a bloomin' cop's&mdash;" began Mr Watkins, rising too quickly to the
  question, and then realising this, bawled to Miss Durgan for another glass of
  beer. "I'm goin' to have a thing called a dark lantern," he said to
  Porson.</p>

  <p>"But it's about new moon now," objected Porson. "There won't be any
  moon."</p>

  <p>"There'll be the house," said Watkins, "at any rate. I'm goin', you see,
  to paint the house first and the moon afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Porson, too staggered to continue the conversation.</p>

  <p>"They doo say," said old Durgan, the landlord, who had maintained a
  respectful silence during the technical conversation, "as there's no less
  than three p'licemen from 'Azelworth on dewty every night in the
  house&mdash;'count of this Lady Aveling 'n her jewellery. One'm won
  fower-and-six last night, off second footman&mdash;tossin'."</p>

  <p>Towards sunset next day Mr Watkins, virgin canvas, easel, and a very
  considerable case of other appliances in hand, strolled up the pleasant
  pathway through the beech-woods to Hammerpond Park, and pitched his apparatus
  in a strategic position commanding the house. Here he was observed by Mr
  Raphael Sant, who was returning across the park from a study of the
  chalk-pits. His curiosity having been fired by Person's account of the new
  arrival, he turned aside with the idea of discussing nocturnal art.</p>

  <p>Mr Watkins was apparently unaware of his approach. A friendly conversation
  with Lady Hammerpond's butler had just terminated, and that individual,
  surrounded by the three pet dogs which it was his duty to take for an airing
  after dinner had been served, was receding in the distance. Mr Watkins was
  mixing colour with an air of great industry. Sant, approaching more nearly,
  was surprised to see the colour in question was as harsh and brilliant an
  emerald green as it is possible to imagine. Having cultivated an extreme
  sensibility to colour from his earliest years, he drew the air in sharply
  between his teeth at the very first glimpse of this brew. Mr Watkins turned
  round. He looked annoyed.</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you going to do with that <i>beastly</i> green?" said
  Sant.</p>

  <p>Mr Watkins realised that his zeal to appear busy in the eyes of the butler
  had evidently betrayed him into some technical error. He looked at Sant and
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Pardon my rudeness," said Sant; "but really, that green is altogether too
  amazing. It came as a shock. What <i>do</i> you mean to do with it?"</p>

  <p>Mr Watkins was collecting his resources. Nothing could save the situation
  but decision. "If you come here interrupting my work," he said, "I'm a-goin'
  to paint your face with it."</p>

  <p>Sant retired, for he was a humourist and a peaceful man. Going down the
  hill he met Porson and Wainwright. "Either that man is a genius or he is a
  dangerous lunatic," said he. "Just go up and look at his green." And he
  continued his way, his countenance brightened by a pleasant anticipation of a
  cheerful affray round an easel in the gloaming, and the shedding of much
  green paint.</p>

  <p>But to Person and Wainwright Mr Watkins was less aggressive, and explained
  that the green was intended to be the first coating of his picture. It was,
  he admitted in response to a remark, an absolutely new method, invented by
  himself. But subsequently he became more reticent; he explained he was not
  going to tell every passer-by the secret of his own particular style, and
  added some scathing remarks upon the meanness of people "hanging about" to
  pick up such tricks of the masters as they could, which immediately relieved
  him of their company.</p>

  <p>Twilight deepened, first one then another star appeared. The rooks amid
  the tall trees to the left of the house had long since lapsed into slumbrous
  silence, the house itself lost all the details of its architecture and became
  a dark grey outline, and then the windows of the salon shone out brilliantly,
  the conservatory was lighted up, and here and there a bedroom window burnt
  yellow. Had anyone approached the easel in the park it would have been found
  deserted. One brief uncivil word in brilliant green sullied the purity of its
  canvas. Mr Watkins was busy in the shrubbery with his assistant, who had
  discreetly joined him from the carriage-drive.</p>

  <p>Mr Watkins was inclined to be self-congratulatory upon the ingenious
  device by which he had carried all his apparatus boldly, and in the sight of
  all men, right up to the scene of operations. "That's the dressing-room," he
  said to his assistant, "and, as soon as the maid takes the candle away and
  goes down to supper, we'll call in. My! how nice the house do look, to be
  sure, against the starlight, and with all its windows and lights! Swopme,
  Jim, I almost wish I <i>was</i> a painter-chap. Have you fixed that there
  wire across the path from the laundry?"</p>

  <p>He cautiously approached the house until he stood below the dressing-room
  window, and began to put together his folding ladder. He was much too
  experienced a practitioner to feel any unusual excitement. Jim was
  reconnoitring the smoking-room. Suddenly, close beside Mr Watkins in the
  bushes, there was a violent crash and a stifled curse. Someone had tumbled
  over the wire which his assistant had just arranged. He heard feet running on
  the gravel pathway beyond. Mr Watkins, like all true artists, was a
  singularly shy man, and he incontinently dropped his folding ladder and began
  running circumspectly through the shrubbery. He was indistinctly aware of two
  people hot upon his heels, and he fancied that he distinguished the outline
  of his assistant in front of him. In another moment he had vaulted the low
  stone wall bounding the shrubbery, and was in the open park. Two thuds on the
  turf followed his own leap.</p>

  <p>It was a close chase in the darkness through the trees. Mr Watkins was a
  loosely-built man and in good training, and he gained hand-over-hand upon the
  hoarsely panting figure in front. Neither spoke, but, as Mr Watkins pulled up
  alongside, a qualm of awful doubt came over him. The other man turned his
  head at the same moment and gave an exclamation of surprise. "It's not Jim,"
  thought Mr Watkins, and simultaneously the stranger flung himself, as it
  were, at Watkin's knees, and they were forthwith grappling on the ground
  together. "Lend a hand, Bill," cried the stranger as the third man came up.
  And Bill did&mdash;two hands in fact, and some accentuated feet. The fourth
  man, presumably Jim, had apparently turned aside and made off in a different
  direction. At any rate, he did not join the trio.</p>

  <p>Mr Watkins' memory of the incidents of the next two minutes is extremely
  vague. He has a dim recollection of having his thumb in the corner of the
  mouth of the first man, and feeling anxious about its safety, and for some
  seconds at least he held the head of the gentleman answering to the name of
  Bill, to the ground by the hair. He was also kicked in a great number of
  different places, apparently by a vast multitude of people. Then the
  gentleman who was not Bill got his knee below Mr Watkins' diaphragm, and
  tried to curl him up upon it.</p>

  <p>When his sensations became less entangled he was sitting upon the turf,
  and eight or ten men&mdash;the night was dark, and he was rather too confused
  to count&mdash;standing round him, apparently waiting for him to recover. He
  mournfully assumed that he was captured, and would probably have made some
  philosophical reflections on the fickleness of fortune, had not his internal
  sensations disinclined him for speech.</p>

  <p>He noticed very quickly that his wrists were not handcuffed, and then a
  flask of brandy was put in his hands. This touched him a little&mdash;it was
  such unexpected kindness.</p>

  <p>"He's a-comin' round," said a voice which he fancied he recognised as
  belonging to the Hammerpond second footman.</p>

  <p>"We've got 'em, sir, both of 'em," said the Hammerpond butler, the man who
  had handed him the flask. "Thanks to <i>you</i>."</p>

  <p>No one answered this remark. Yet he failed to see how it applied to
  him.</p>

  <p>"He's fair dazed," said a strange voice; "the villains half-murdered
  him."</p>

  <p>Mr Teddy Watkins decided to remain fair dazed until he had a better grasp
  of the situation. He perceived that two of the black figures round him stood
  side-by-side with a dejected air, and there was something in the carriage of
  their shoulders that suggested to his experienced eye hands that were bound
  together. Two! In a flash he rose to his position. He emptied the little
  flask and staggered&mdash;obsequious hands assisting him&mdash;to his feet.
  There was a sympathetic murmur.</p>

  <p>"Shake hands, sir, shake hands," said one of the figures near him. "Permit
  me to introduce myself. I am very greatly indebted to you. It was the jewels
  of my wife, Lady Aveling, which attracted these scoundrels to the house."</p>

  <p>"Very glad to make your lordship's acquaintance," said Teddy Watkins.</p>

  <p>"I presume you saw the rascals making for the shrubbery, and dropped down
  on them?"</p>

  <p>"That's exactly how it happened," said Mr Watkins.</p>

  <p>"You should have waited till they got in at the window," said Lord
  Aveling; "they would get it hotter if they had actually committed the
  burglary. And it was lucky for you two of the policemen were out by the
  gates, and followed up the three of you. I doubt if you could have secured
  the two of them&mdash;though it was confoundedly plucky of you, all the
  same."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I ought to have thought of all that," said Mr Watkins; "but one
  can't think of everythink."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," said Lord Aveling. "I am afraid they have mauled you a
  little," he added. The party was now moving towards the house. "You walk
  rather lame. May I offer you my arm?"</p>

  <p>And instead of entering Hammerpond House by the dressing-room window, Mr
  Watkins entered it&mdash;slightly intoxicated, and inclined now to
  cheerfulness again&mdash;on the arm of a real live peer, and by the front
  door. "This," thought Mr Watkins, "is burgling in style!" The "scoundrels,"
  seen by the gaslight, proved to be mere local amateurs unknown to Mr Watkins,
  and they were taken down into the pantry and there watched over by the three
  policemen, two gamekeepers with loaded guns, the butler, an ostler, and a
  carman, until the dawn allowed of their removal to Hazelhurst police-station.
  Mr Watkins was made much of in the saloon. They devoted a sofa to him, and
  would not hear of a return to the village that night. Lady Aveling was sure
  he was brilliantly original, and said her idea of Turner was just such
  another rough, half-inebriated, deep-eyed, brave, and clever man. Some one
  brought up a remarkable little folding-ladder that had been picked up in the
  shrubbery, and showed him how it was put together. They also described how
  wires had been found in the shrubbery, evidently placed there to trip-up
  unwary pursuers. It was lucky he had escaped these snares. And they showed
  him the jewels.</p>

  <p>Mr Watkins had the sense not to talk too much, and in any conversational
  difficulty fell back on his internal pains. At last he was seized with
  stiffness in the back, and yawning. Everyone suddenly awoke to the fact that
  it was a shame to keep him talking after his affray, so he retired early to
  his room, the little red room next to Lord Aveling's suite.</p>

  <p>The dawn found a deserted easel bearing a canvas with a green inscription,
  in the Hammerpond Park, and it found Hammerpond House in commotion. But if
  the dawn found Mr Teddy Watkins and the Aveling diamonds, it did not
  communicate the information to the police.</p>

     name="story06">THE JILTING OF JANE</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, July 12, 1894</h3>

  <p>As I sit writing in my study, I can hear our Jane bumping her way
  downstairs with a brush and dust-pan. She used in the old days to sing hymn
  tunes, or the British national song for the time being, to these instruments,
  but latterly she has been silent and even careful over her work. Time was
  when I prayed with fervour for such silence, and my wife with sighs for such
  care, but now they have come we are not so glad as we might have anticipated
  we should be. Indeed, I would rejoice secretly, though it may be unmanly
  weakness to admit it, even to hear Jane sing "Daisy," or, by the fracture of
  any plate but one of Euphemia's best green ones, to learn that the period of
  brooding has come to an end.</p>

  <p>Yet how we longed to hear the last of Jane's young man before we heard the
  last of him! Jane was always very free with her conversation to my wife, and
  discoursed admirably in the kitchen on a variety of topics&mdash;so well,
  indeed, that I sometimes left my study door open&mdash;our house is a small
  one&mdash;to partake of it. But after William came, it was always William,
  nothing but William; William this and William that; and when we thought
  William was worked out and exhausted altogether, then William all over again.
  The engagement lasted altogether three years; yet how she got introduced to
  William, and so became thus saturated with him, was always a secret. For my
  part, I believe it was at the street corner where the Rev. Barnabas Baux used
  to hold an open-air service after evensong on Sundays. Young Cupids were wont
  to flit like moths round the paraffin flare of that centre of High Church
  hymn-singing. I fancy she stood singing hymns there, out of memory and her
  imagination, instead of coming home to get supper, and William came up beside
  her and said, "Hello!" "Hello yourself!" she said; and etiquette being
  satisfied, they proceeded to talk together.</p>

  <p>As Euphemia has a reprehensible way of letting her servants talk to her,
  she soon heard of him. "He is <i>such</i> a respectable young man, ma'am,"
  said Jane, "you don't know." Ignoring the slur cast on her acquaintance, my
  wife inquired further about this William.</p>

  <p>"He is second porter at Maynard's, the draper's," said Jane, "and gets
  eighteen shillings&mdash;nearly a pound&mdash;a week, m'm; and when the head
  porter leaves he will be head porter. His relatives are quite superior
  people, m'm. Not labouring people at all. His father was a greengrosher, m'm,
  and had a churnor, and he was bankrup' twice. And one of his sisters is in a
  Home for the Dying. It will be a very good match for me, m'm," said Jane, "me
  being an orphan girl."</p>

  <p>"Then you are engaged to him?" asked my wife.</p>

  <p>"Not engaged, ma'am; but he is saving money to buy a
  ring&mdash;hammyfist."</p>

  <p>"Well, Jane, when you are properly engaged to him you may ask him round
  here on Sunday afternoons, and have tea with him in the kitchen;" for my
  Euphemia has a motherly conception of her duty towards her maid-servants. And
  presently the amethystine ring was being worn about the house, even with
  ostentation, and Jane developed a new way of bringing in the joint so that
  this gage was evident. The elder Miss Maitland was aggrieved by it, and told
  my wife that servants ought not to wear rings. But my wife looked it up in
  <i>Enquire Within</i> and <i>Mrs. Motherly's Book of Household
  Management</i>, and found no prohibition. So Jane remained with this
  happiness added to her love.</p>

  <p>The treasure of Jane's heart appeared to me to be what respectable people
  call a very deserving young man. "William, ma'am," said Jane one day
  suddenly, with ill-concealed complacency, as she counted out the beer
  bottles, "William, ma'am, is a teetotaller. Yes, m'm; and he don't smoke.
  Smoking, ma'am," said Jane, as one who reads the heart, "<i>do</i> make such
  a dust about. Beside the waste of money. <i>And</i> the smell. However, I
  suppose they got to do it&mdash;some of them..."</p>

  <p>William was at first a rather shabby young man of the ready-made black
  coat school of costume. He had watery gray eyes, and a complexion appropriate
  to the brother of one in a Home for the Dying. Euphemia did not fancy him
  very much, even at the beginning. His eminent respectability was vouched for
  by an alpaca umbrella, from which he never allowed himself to be parted.</p>

  <p>"He goes to chapel," said Jane. "His papa, ma'am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"His <i>what</i>, Jane?"</p>

  <p>"His papa, ma'am, was Church: but Mr. Maynard is a Plymouth Brother, and
  William thinks it Policy, ma'am, to go there too. Mr. Maynard comes and talks
  to him quite friendly when they ain't busy, about using up all the ends of
  string, and about his soul. He takes a lot of notice, do Mr. Maynard, of
  William, and the way he saves his soul, ma'am."</p>

  <p>Presently we heard that the head porter at Maynard's had left, and that
  William was head porter at twenty-three shillings a week. "He is really kind
  of over the man who drives the van," said Jane, "and him married, with three
  children." And she promised in the pride of her heart to make interest for us
  with William to favour us so that we might get our parcels of drapery from
  Maynard's with exceptional promptitude.</p>

  <p>After this promotion a rapidly-increasing prosperity came upon Jane's
  young man. One day we learned that Mr. Maynard had given William a book.
  "'Smiles' 'Elp Yourself,' it's called," said Jane; "but it ain't comic. It
  tells you how to get on in the world, and some what William read to me was
  <i>lovely</i>, ma'am."</p>

  <p>Euphemia told me of this, laughing, and then she became suddenly grave.
  "Do you know, dear," she said, "Jane said one thing I did not like. She had
  been quiet for a minute, and then she suddenly remarked, 'William is a lot
  above me, ma'am, ain't he?'"</p>

  <p>"I don't see anything in that," I said, though later my eyes were to be
  opened.</p>

  <p>One Sunday afternoon about that time I was sitting at my writing-desk
  &mdash;possibly I was reading a good book&mdash;when a something went by the
  window. I heard a startled exclamation behind me, and saw Euphemia with her
  hands clasped together and her eyes dilated. "George," she said in an awe-
  stricken whisper, "did you see?"</p>

  <p>Then we both spoke to one another at the same moment, slowly and solemnly:
  "<i>A silk hat! Yellow gloves! A new umbrella!</i>"</p>

  <p>"It may be my fancy, dear," said Euphemia; "but his tie was very like
  yours. I believe Jane keeps him in ties. She told me a little while ago, in a
  way that implied volumes about the rest of your costume, 'The master
  <i>do</i> wear pretty ties, ma'am.' And he echoes all your novelties."</p>

  <p>The young couple passed our window again on their way to their customary
  walk. They were arm in arm. Jane looked exquisitely proud, happy, and
  uncomfortable, with new white cotton gloves, and William, in the silk hat,
  singularly genteel!</p>

  <p>That was the culmination of Jane's happiness. When she returned, "Mr.
  Maynard has been talking to William, ma'am," she said, "and he is to serve
  customers, just like the young shop gentlemen, during the next sale. And if
  he gets on, he is to be made an assistant, ma'am, at the first opportunity.
  He has got to be as gentlemanly as he can, ma'am; and if he ain't, ma'am, he
  says it won't be for want of trying. Mr. Maynard has took a great fancy to
  him."</p>

  <p>"He <i>is</i> getting on, Jane," said my wife.</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am," said Jane thoughtfully; "he <i>is</i> getting on."</p>

  <p>And she sighed.</p>

  <p>That next Sunday as I drank my tea I interrogated my wife. "How is this
  Sunday different from all other Sundays, little woman? What has happened?
  Have you altered the curtains, or re-arranged the furniture, or where is the
  indefinable difference of it? Are you wearing your hair in a new way without
  warning me? I perceive a change clearly, and I cannot for the life of me say
  what it is."</p>

  <p>Then my wife answered in her most tragic voice, "George," she said, "that
  William has not come near the place to-day! And Jane is crying her heart out
  upstairs."</p>

  <p>There followed a period of silence. Jane, as I have said, stopped singing
  about the house, and began to care for our brittle possessions, which struck
  my wife as being a very sad sign indeed. The next Sunday, and the next, Jane
  asked to go out, "to walk with William," and my wife, who never attempts to
  extort confidences, gave her permission, and asked no questions. On each
  occasion Jane came back looking flushed and very determined. At last one day
  she became communicative.</p>

  <p>"William is being led away," she remarked abruptly, with a catching of the
  breath, apropos of tablecloths. "Yes, m'm. She is a milliner, and she can
  play on the piano."</p>

  <p>"I thought," said my wife, "that you went out with him on Sunday."</p>

  <p>"Not out with him, m'm&mdash;after him. I walked along by the side of
  them, and told her he was engaged to me."</p>

  <p>"Dear me, Jane, did you? What did they do?"</p>

  <p>"Took no more notice of me than if I was dirt. So I told her she should
  suffer for it."</p>

  <p>"It could not have been a very agreeable walk, Jane."</p>

  <p>"Not for no parties, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"I wish," said Jane, "I could play the piano, ma'am. But anyhow, I don't
  mean to let <i>her</i> get him away from me. She's older than him, and her
  hair ain't gold to the roots, ma'am."</p>

  <p>It was on the August Bank Holiday that the crisis came. We do not clearly
  know the details of the fray, but only such fragments as poor Jane let fall.
  She came home dusty, excited, and with her heart hot within her.</p>

  <p>The milliner's mother, the milliner, and William had made a party to the
  Art Museum at South Kensington, I think. Anyhow, Jane had calmly but firmly
  accosted them somewhere in the streets, and asserted her right to what, in
  spite of the consensus of literature, she held to be her inalienable
  property. She did, I think, go so far as to lay hands on him. They dealt with
  her in a crushingly superior way. They "called a cab." There was a "scene,"
  William being pulled away into the four-wheeler by his future wife and
  mother-in-law from the reluctant hands of our discarded Jane. There were
  threats of giving her "in charge."</p>

  <p>"My poor Jane!" said my wife, mincing veal as though she was mincing
  William. "It's a shame of them. I would think no more of him. He is not
  worthy of you."</p>

  <p>"No, m'm," said Jane. "He <i>is</i> weak.</p>

  <p>"But it's that woman has done it," said Jane. She was never known to bring
  herself to pronounce "that woman's" name or to admit her girlishness. "I
  can't think what minds some women must have&mdash;to try and get a girl's
  young man away from her. But there, it only hurts to talk about it," said
  Jane.</p>

  <p>Thereafter our house rested from William. But there was something in the
  manner of Jane's scrubbing the front doorstep or sweeping out the rooms, a
  certain viciousness, that persuaded me that the story had not yet ended.</p>

  <p>"Please, m'm, may I go and see a wedding tomorrow?" said Jane one day.</p>

  <p>My wife knew by instinct whose wedding. "Do you think it is wise, Jane?"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"I would like to see the last of him," said Jane.</p>

  <p>"My dear," said my wife, fluttering into my room about twenty minutes
  after Jane had started, "Jane has been to the boot-hole and taken all the
  left-off boots and shoes, and gone off to the wedding with them in a bag.
  Surely she cannot mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jane," I said, "is developing character. Let us hope for the best."</p>

  <p>Jane came back with a pale, hard face. All the boots seemed to be still in
  her bag, at which my wife heaved a premature sigh of relief. We heard her go
  upstairs and replace the boots with considerable emphasis.</p>

  <p>"Quite a crowd at the wedding, ma'am," she said presently, in a purely
  conversational style, sitting in our little kitchen, and scrubbing the
  potatoes; "and such a lovely day for them." She proceeded to numerous other
  details, clearly avoiding some cardinal incident.</p>

  <p>"It was all extremely respectable and nice, ma'am; but <i>her</i> father
  didn't wear a black coat, and looked quite out of place, ma'am. Mr.
  Piddingquirk&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Who</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Piddingquirk&mdash;William that was, ma'am&mdash;had white gloves,
  and a coat like a clergyman, and a lovely chrysanthemum. He looked so nice,
  ma'am. And there was red carpet down, just like for gentlefolks. And they say
  he gave the clerk four shillings, ma'am. It was a real kerridge they had
  &mdash;not a fly. When they came out of church there was rice-throwing, and
  her two little sisters dropping dead flowers. And someone threw a slipper,
  and then I threw a boot&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Threw a <i>boot</i>, Jane!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am. Aimed at her. But it hit <i>him</i>. Yes, ma'am, hard. Gev
  him a black eye, I should think. I only threw that one. I hadn't the heart to
  try again. All the little boys cheered when it hit him."</p>

  <p>After an interval&mdash;"I am sorry the boot hit <i>him</i>."</p>

  <p>Another pause. The potatoes were being scrubbed violently. "He always
  <i>was</i> a bit above me, you know, ma'am. And he was led away."</p>

  <p>The potatoes were more than finished. Jane rose sharply with a sigh, and
  rapped the basin down on the table.</p>

  <p>"I don't care," she said. "I don't care a rap. He will find out his
  mistake yet. It serves me right. I was stuck up about him. I ought not to
  have looked so high. And I am glad things are as things are."</p>

  <p>My wife was in the kitchen, seeing to the higher cookery. After the
  confession of the boot-throwing, she must have watched poor Jane fuming with
  a certain dismay in those brown eyes of hers. But I imagine they softened
  again very quickly, and then Jane's must have met them.</p>

  <p>"Oh, ma'am," said Jane, with an astonishing change of note, "think of all
  that <i>might</i> have been! Oh, ma'am, I <i>could</i> have been so happy! I
  ought to have known, but I didn't know... You're very kind to let me talk to
  you, ma'am... for it's hard on me, ma'am... it's har-r-r-r-d&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And I gather that Euphemia so far forgot herself as to let Jane sob out
  some of the fullness of her heart on a sympathetic shoulder. My Euphemia,
  thank Heaven, has never properly grasped the importance of "keeping up her
  position." And since that fit of weeping, much of the accent of bitterness
  has gone out of Jane's scrubbing and brush work.</p>

  <p>Indeed, something passed the other day with the butcher-boy&mdash;but that
  scarcely belongs to this story. However, Jane is young still, and time and
  change are at work with her. We all have our sorrows, but I do not believe
  very much in the existence of sorrows that never heal.</p>

     name="story07">THE DIAMOND MAKER</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, August 16, 1894</h3>

  <p>Some business had detained me in Chancery Lane nine in the evening, and
  thereafter, having some inkling of a headache, I was disinclined either for
  entertainment or further work. So much of the sky as the high cliffs of that
  narrow canon of traffic left visible spoke of a serene night, and I
  determined to make my way down to the Embankment, and rest my eyes and cool
  my head by watching the variegated lights upon the river. Beyond comparison
  the night is the best time for this place; a merciful darkness hides the dirt
  of the waters, and the lights of this transitional age, red glaring orange,
  gas-yellow, and electric white, are set in shadowy outlines of every possible
  shade between grey and deep purple. Through the arches of Waterloo Bridge a
  hundred points of light mark the sweep of the Embankment, and above its
  parapet rise the towers of Westminster,warm grey against the starlight. The
  black river goes by with only a rare ripple breaking its silence, and
  disturbing the reflections of the lights that swim upon its surface.</p>

  <p>"A warm night," said a voice at my side.</p>

  <p>I turned my head, and saw the profile of a man who was leaning over the
  parapet beside me. It was a refined face, not unhandsome, though pinched and
  pale enough, and the coat collar turned up and pinned round the throat marked
  his status in life as sharply as a uniform. I felt I was committed to the
  price of a bed and breakfast if I answered him.</p>

  <p>I looked at him curiously. Would he have anything to tell me worth the
  money, or was he the common incapable&mdash;incapable even of telling his own
  story? There was a quality of intelligence in his forehead and eyes, and a
  certain tremulousness in his nether lip that decided me.</p>

  <p>"Very warm," said I; "but not too warm for us here."</p>

  <p>"No," he said, still looking across the water, "it is pleasant enough here
  ...just now."</p>

  <p>"It is good," he continued after a pause, "to find anything so restful as
  this in London. After one has been fretting about business all day, about
  getting on, meeting obligations, and parrying dangers, I do not know what one
  would do if it were not for such pacific corners." He spoke with long pauses
  between the sentences. "You must know a little of the irksome labour of the
  world, or you would not be here. But I doubt if you can be so brain-weary and
  footsore as I am...Bah! Sometimes I doubt if the game is worth the candle. I
  feel inclined to throw the whole thing over&mdash;name, wealth and position
  &mdash;and take to some modest trade. But I know if I abandoned my ambition
  &mdash;hardly as she uses me&mdash;I should have nothing but remorse left for
  the rest of my days."</p>

  <p>He became silent. I looked at him in astonishment. If ever I saw a man
  hopelessly hard-up it was the man in front of me. He was ragged and he was
  dirty, unshaven and unkempt; he looked as though he had been left in a
  dust-bin for a week. And he was talking to ME of the irksome worries of a
  large business. I almost laughed outright. Either he was mad or playing a
  sorry jest on his own poverty.</p>

  <p>"If high aims and high positions," said I, "have their drawbacks of hard
  work and anxiety, they have their compensations. Influence, the power of
  doing good, of assisting those weaker and poorer than ourselves; and there is
  even a certain gratification in display..."</p>

  <p>My banter under the circumstances was in very vile taste. I spoke on the
  spur of the contrast of his appearance and speech. I was sorry even while I
  was speaking.</p>

  <p>He turned a haggard but very composed face upon me. Said he: "I forgot
  myself. Of course you would not understand."</p>

  <p>He measured me for a moment. "No doubt it is very absurd. You will not
  believe me even when I tell you, so that it is fairly safe to tell you. And
  it will be a comfort to tell someone. I really have a big business in hand, a
  very big business. But there are troubles just now. The fact is...I make
  diamonds."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said I, "you are out of work just at present?"</p>

  <p>"I am sick of being disbelieved," he said impatiently, and suddenly
  unbuttoning his wretched coat he pulled out a little canvas bag that was
  hanging by a cord round his neck. From this he produced a brown pebble. "I
  wonder if you know enough to know what that is?" He handed it to me.</p>

  <p>Now, a year or so ago, I had occupied my leisure in taking a London
  science degree, so that I have a smattering of physics and mineralogy. The
  thing was not unlike an uncut diamond of the darker sort, though far too
  large, being almost as big as the top of my thumb. I took it, and saw it had
  the form of a regular octahedron, with the curved faces peculiar to the most
  precious of minerals. I took out my penknife and tried to scratch
  it&mdash;vainly. Leaning forward towards the gas-lamp, I tried the thing on
  my watch-glass, and scored a white line across that with the greatest
  ease.</p>

  <p>I looked at my interlocutor with rising curiosity. "It certainly is rather
  like a diamond. But, if so, it is a Behemoth of diamonds. Where did you get
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you I made it," he said. "Give it back to me."</p>

  <p>He replaced it hastily and buttoned his jacket. "I will sell it you for
  one hundred pounds," he suddenly whispered eagerly. With that my suspicions
  returned. The thing might, after all, be merely a lump of that almost equally
  hard substance, corundum, with an accidental resemblance in shape to the
  diamond. Or if it was a diamond, how came he by it, and why should he offer
  it at a hundred pounds?</p>

  <p>We looked into one another's eyes. He seemed eager, but honestly eager. At
  that moment I believed it was a diamond he was trying to sell. Yet I am a
  poor man, a hundred pounds would leave a visible gap in my fortunes and no
  sane man would buy a diamond by gaslight from a ragged tramp on his personal
  warranty only. Still, a diamond that size conjured up a vision of many
  thousands of pounds. Then, thought I, such a stone could scarcely exist
  without being mentioned in every book on gems, and again I called to mind the
  stories of contraband and light-fingered Kaffirs at the Cape. I put the
  question of purchase on one side.</p>

  <p>"How did you get it?" said I.</p>

  <p>"I made it."</p>

  <p>I had heard something of Moissan, but I knew his artificial diamonds were
  very small. I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"You seem to know something of this kind of thing. I will tell you a
  little about myself. Perhaps then you may think better of the purchase." He
  turned round with his back to the river, and put his hands in his pockets. He
  sighed. "I know you will not believe me."</p>

  <p>"Diamonds," he began&mdash;and as he spoke his voice lost its faint
  flavour of the tramp and assumed something of the easy tone of an educated
  man&mdash;are to be made by throwing carbon out of combination in a suitable
  flux and under a suitable pressure; the carbon crystallises out, not as
  black-lead or charcoal-powder, but as small diamonds. So much has been known
  to chemists for years, but no one yet had hit upon exactly the right flux in
  which to melt up the carbon, or exactly the right pressure for the best
  results. Consequently the diamonds made by chemists are small and dark, and
  worthless as jewels. Now I, you know, have given up my life to this
  problem&mdash;given my life to it.</p>

  <p>"I began to work at the conditions of diamond making when I was seventeen,
  and now I am thirty-two. It seemed to me that it might take all the thought
  and energies of a man for ten years, or twenty years, but, even if it did,
  the game was still worth the candle. Suppose one to have at last just hit the
  right trick before the secret got out and diamonds became as common as coal,
  one might realize millions. Millions!"</p>

  <p>He paused and looked for my sympathy. His eyes shone hungrily. "To think,"
  said he, "that I am on the verge of it all, and here!</p>

  <p>"I had," he proceeded, "about a thousand pounds when I was twenty-one, and
  this, I thought, eked out by a little teaching, would keep my researches
  going. A year or two was spent in study, at Berlin chiefly, and then I
  continued on my own account. The trouble was the secrecy. You see, if once I
  had let out what I was doing, other men might have been spurred on by my
  belief in the practicability of the idea; and I do not pretend to be such a
  genius as to have been sure of coming in first, in the case of a race for the
  discovery. And you see it was important that if I really meant to make a
  pile, people should not know it was an artificial process and capable of
  turning out diamonds by the ton. So I had to work all alone. At first I had a
  little laboratory, but as my resources began to run out I had to conduct my
  experiments in a wretched unfurnished room in Kentish Town, where I slept at
  last on a straw mattress on the floor among all my apparatus. The money
  simply flowed away. I grudged myself everything except scientific appliances.
  I tried to keep things going by a little teaching, but I am not a very good
  teacher, and I have no university degree, nor very much education except in
  chemistry, and I found I had to give a lot of time and labour for precious
  little money. But I got nearer and nearer the thing. Three years ago I
  settled the problem of the composition of the flux, and got near the pressure
  by putting this flux of mine and a certain carbon composition into a
  closed-up gun-barrel, filling up with water, sealing tightly, and
  heating."</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"Rather risky," said I.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It burst, and smashed all my windows and a lot of my apparatus; but
  I got a kind of diamond powder nevertheless. Following out the problem of
  getting a big pressure upon the molten mixture from which the things were to
  crystallise, I hit upon some researches of Daubree's at the Paris Laboratorie
  des Poudres et Salpetres. He exploded dynamite in a tightly screwed steel
  cylinder, too strong to burst, and I found he could crush rocks into a muck
  not unlike the South African bed in which diamonds are found. It was a
  tremendous strain on my resources, but I got a steel cylinder made for my
  purpose after his pattern. I put in all my stuff and my explosives, built up
  a fire in my furnace, put the whole concern in, and&mdash;went out for a
  walk."</p>

  <p>I could not help laughing at his matter-of-fact manner. "Did you not think
  it would blow up the house? Were there other people in the place?"</p>

  <p>"It was in the interest of science," he said, ultimately. "There was a
  costermonger family on the floor below, a begging-letter writer in the room
  behind mine, and two flower-women were upstairs. Perhaps it was a bit
  thoughtless. But possibly some of them were out.</p>

  <p>"When I came back the thing was just where I left it, among the white-hot
  coals. The explosive hadn't burst the case. And then I had a problem to face.
  You know time is an important element in crystallisation. If you hurry the
  process the crystals are small&mdash;it is only by prolonged standing that
  they grow to any size. I resolved to let this apparatus cool for two years,
  letting the temperature go down slowly during the time. And I was now quite
  out of money; and with a big fire and the rent of my room, as well as my
  hunger to satisfy, I had scarcely a penny in the world.</p>

  <p>"I can hardly tell you all the shifts I was put to while I was making the
  diamonds. I have sold newspapers, held horses, opened cab-doors. For many
  weeks I addressed envelopes. I had a place as assistant to a man who owned a
  barrow, and used to call down one side of the road while he called down the
  other.</p>

  <p>"Once for a week I had absolutely nothing to do, and I begged. What a week
  that was! One day the fire was going out and I had eaten nothing all day, and
  a little chap taking his girl out, gave me sixpence&mdash;to show off. Thank
  heaven for vanity! How the fish-shops smelt! But I went and spent it all on
  coals, and had the furnace bright red again, and then&mdash;Well, hunger
  makes a fool of a man.</p>

  <p>"At last, three weeks ago, I let the fire out. I took my cylinder and
  unscrewed it while it was still so hot that it punished my hands, and I
  scraped out the crumbling lava-like mass with a chisel, and hammered it into
  a powder upon an iron plate. And I found three big diamonds and five small
  ones. As I sat on the floor hammering, my door opened, and my neighbour, the
  begging-letter writer came in. He was drunk&mdash;as he usually is.
  "'Nerchist,' said he. 'You're drunk,' said I. ''Structive scoundrel,' said
  he. 'Go to your father,' said I, meaning the Father of Lies. 'Never you
  mind,' said he, and gave me a cunning wink, and hiccuped, and leaning up
  against the door, with his other eye against the door-post, began to babble
  of how he had been prying in my room, and how he had gone to the police that
  morning, and how they had taken down everything he had to
  say&mdash;''siffiwas a ge'm,' said he. Then I suddenly realised I was in a
  hole. Either I should have to tell these police my little secret, and get the
  whole thing blown upon, or be lagged as an Anarchist. So I went up to my
  neighbour and took him by the collar, and rolled him about a bit, and then I
  gathered up my diamonds and cleared out. The evening newspapers called my den
  the Kentish Town Bomb Factory. And now I cannot part with the things for love
  or money.</p>

  <p>"If I go in to respectable jewellers they ask me to wait, and go and
  whisper to a clerk to fetch a policeman, and then I say I cannot wait. And I
  found out a receiver of stolen goods, and he simply stuck to the one I gave
  him and told me to prosecute if I wanted it back. I am going about now with
  several hundred thousand pounds-worth of diamonds round my neck, and without
  either food or shelter. You are the first person I have taken into my
  confidence. But I like your face and I am hard-driven."</p>

  <p>He looked into my eyes.</p>

  <p>"It would be madness," said I, "for me to buy a diamond under the
  circumstances. Besides, I do not carry hundreds of pounds about in my pocket.
  Yet I more than half believe your story. I will, if you like, do this: come
  to my office to-morrow..."</p>

  <p>"You think I am a thief!" said he keenly. "You will tell the police. I am
  not coming into a trap."</p>

  <p>"Somehow I am assured you are no thief. Here is my card. Take that,
  anyhow. You need not come to any appointment. Come when you will."</p>

  <p>He took the card, and an earnest of my good-will.</p>

  <p>"Think better of it and come," said I.</p>

  <p>He shook his head doubtfully. "I will pay back your half-crown with
  interest some day&mdash;such interest as will amaze you," said he. "Anyhow,
  you will keep the secret?...Don't follow me."</p>

  <p>He crossed the road and went into the darkness towards the little steps
  under the archway leading into Essex Street, and I let him go. And that was
  the last I ever saw of him.</p>

  <p>Afterwards I had two letters from him asking me to send bank-notes
  &mdash;not cheques&mdash;to certain addresses. I weighed the matter over and
  took what I conceived to be the wisest course. Once he called upon me when I
  was out. My urchin described him as a very thin, dirty, and ragged man, with
  a dreadful cough. He left no message. That was the finish of him so far as my
  story goes. I wonder sometimes what has become of him. Was he an ingenious
  monomaniac, or a fraudulent dealer in pebbles, or has he really made diamonds
  as he asserted? The latter is just sufficiently credible to make me think at
  times that I have missed the most brilliant opportunity of my life. He may of
  course be dead, and his diamonds carelessly thrown aside&mdash;one, I repeat,
  was almost as big as my thumb. Or he may be still wandering about trying to
  sell the things. It is just possible he may yet emerge upon society, and,
  passing athwart my heavens in the serene altitude sacred to the wealthy and
  the well-advertised, reproach me silently for my want of enterprise. I
  sometimes think I might at least have risked five pounds.</p>

     name="story08">THE FLOWERING OF THE STRANGE ORCHID</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, August 2, 1894</h3>

  <p>The buying of orchids always has in it a certain speculative flavour. You
  have before you the brown shrivelled lump of tissue, and for the rest you
  must trust your judgment, or the auctioneer, or your good-luck, as your taste
  may incline. The plant may be moribund or dead, or it may be just a
  respectable purchase, fair value for your money, or perhaps&mdash;for the
  thing has happened again and again&mdash;there slowly unfolds before the
  delighted eyes of the happy purchaser, day after day, some new variety, some
  novel richness, a strange twist of the labellum, or some subtler colouration
  or unexpected mimicry. Pride, beauty, and profit blossom together on one
  delicate green spike, and, it may be, even immortality. For the new miracle
  of Nature may stand in need of a new specific name, and what so convenient as
  that of its discoverer? "Johnsmithia"! There have been worse names.</p>

  <p>It was perhaps the hope of some such happy discovery that made Winter-
  Wedderburn such a frequent attendant at these sales&mdash;that hope, and
  also, maybe, the fact that he had nothing else of the slightest interest to
  do in the world. He was a shy, lonely, rather ineffectual man, provided with
  just enough income to keep off the spur of necessity, and not enough nervous
  energy to make him seek any exacting employments. He might have collected
  stamps or coins, or translated Horace, or bound books, or invented new
  species of diatoms. But, as it happened, he grew orchids, and had one
  ambitious little hothouse.</p>

  <p>"I have a fancy," he said over his coffee, "that something is going to
  happen to me to-day." He spoke&mdash;as he moved and
  thought&mdash;slowly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't say <i>that</i>!" said his housekeeper&mdash;who was also his
  remote cousin. For "something happening" was a euphemism that meant only one
  thing to her.</p>

  <p>"You misunderstand me. I mean nothing unpleasant...though what I do mean I
  scarcely know.</p>

  <p>"To-day," he continued, after a pause, "Peters' are going to sell a batch
  of plants from the Andamans and the Indies. I shall go up and see what they
  have. It may be I shall buy something good, unawares. That may be it."</p>

  <p>He passed his cup for his second cupful of coffee.</p>

  <p>"Are these the things collected by that poor young fellow you told me of
  the other day?" asked his cousin as she filled his cup.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, and became meditative over a piece of toast.</p>

  <p>"Nothing ever does happen to me," he remarked presently, beginning to
  think aloud. "I wonder why? Things enough happen to other people. There is
  Harvey. Only the other week; on Monday he picked up sixpence, on Wednesday
  his chicks all had the staggers, on Friday his cousin came home from
  Australia, and on Saturday he broke his ankle. What a whirl of
  excitement!&mdash;compared to me."</p>

  <p>"I think I would rather be without so much excitement," said his
  housekeeper. "It can't be good for you."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's troublesome. Still...you see, nothing ever happens to me.
  When I was a little boy I never had accidents. I never fell in love as I grew
  up. Never married... I wonder how it feels to have something happen to you,
  something really remarkable.</p>

  <p>"That orchid-collector was only thirty-six&mdash;twenty years younger than
  myself&mdash;when he died. And he had been married twice and divorced once;
  he had had malarial fever four times, and once he broke his thigh. He killed
  a Malay once, and once he was wounded by a poisoned dart And in the end he
  was killed by jungle-leeches. It must have all been very troublesome, but
  then it must have been very interesting, you know&mdash;except, perhaps, the
  leeches."</p>

  <p>"I am sure it was not good for him," said the lady, with conviction.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not." And then Wedderburn looked at his watch. "Twenty-three
  minutes past eight I am going up by the quarter to twelve train, so that
  there is plenty of time. I think I shall wear my alpaca jacket&mdash;it is
  quite warm enough&mdash;and my grey felt hat and brown shoes. I
  suppose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He glanced out of the window at the serene sky and sunlit garden, and then
  nervously at his cousin's face.</p>

  <p>"I think you had better take an umbrella if you are going to London," she
  said in a voice that admitted of no denial. "There's all between here and the
  station coming back."</p>

  <p>When he returned he was in a state of mild excitement. He had made a
  purchase. It was rare that he could make up his mind quickly enough to buy,
  but this time he had done so.</p>

  <p>"There are Vandas," he said, "and a Dendrobe and some Palaeonophis." He
  surveyed his purchases lovingly as he consumed his soup. They were laid out
  on the spotless tablecloth before him, and he was telling his cousin all
  about them as he slowly meandered through his dinner. It was his custom to
  live all his visits to London over again in the evening for her and his own
  entertainment.</p>

  <p>"I knew something would happen to-day. And I have bought all these. Some
  of them&mdash;some of them&mdash;I feel sure, do you know, that some of them
  will be remarkable. I don't know how it is, but I feel just as sure as if
  someone had told me that some of these will turn out remarkable.</p>

  <p>"That one"&mdash;he pointed to a shrivelled rhizome&mdash;"was not
  identified. It may be a Palaeonophis&mdash;or it may not. It may be a new
  species, or even a new genus. And it was the last that poor Batten ever
  collected."</p>

  <p>"I don't like the look of it," said his housekeeper. "It's such an ugly
  shape."</p>

  <p>"To me it scarcely seems to have a shape."</p>

  <p>"I don't like those things that stick out," said his housekeeper.</p>

  <p>"It shall be put away in a pot to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"It looks," said the housekeeper, "like a spider shamming dead."</p>

  <p>Wedderburn smiled and surveyed the root with his head on one side. "It is
  certainly not a pretty lump of stuff. But you can never judge of these things
  from their dry appearance. It may turn out to be a very beautiful orchid
  indeed. How busy I shall be to-morrow! I must see to-night just exactly what
  to do with these things, and to-morrow I shall set to work."</p>

  <p>"They found poor Batten lying dead, or dying, in a mangrove swamp&mdash;I
  forget which," he began again presently, "with one of these very orchids
  crushed up under his body. He had been unwell for some days with some kind of
  native fever, and I suppose he fainted. These mangrove swamps are very
  unwholesome. Every drop of blood, they say, was taken out of him by the
  jungle-leeches. It may be that very plant that cost him his life to
  obtain."</p>

  <p>"I think none the better of it for that."</p>

  <p>"Men must work though women may weep," said Wedderburn with profound
  gravity.</p>

  <p>"Fancy dying away from every comfort in a nasty swamp! Fancy being ill of
  fever with nothing to take but chlorodyne and quinine&mdash;if men were left
  to themselves they would live on chlorodyne and quinine&mdash;and no one
  round you but horrible natives! They say the Andaman islanders are most
  disgusting wretches&mdash;and, anyhow, they can scarcely make good nurses,
  not having the necessary training. And just for people in England to have
  orchids!"</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose it was comfortable, but some men seem to enjoy that kind
  of thing," said Wedderburn. "Anyhow, the natives of his party were
  sufficiently civilised to take care of all his collection until his
  colleague, who was an ornithologist, came back again from the interior;
  though they could not tell the species of the orchid and had let it wither.
  And it makes these things more interesting."</p>

  <p>"It makes them disgusting. I should be afraid of some of the malaria
  clinging to them. And just think, there has been a dead body lying across
  that ugly thing! I never thought of that before. There! I declare I cannot
  eat another mouthful of dinner."</p>

  <p>"I will take them off the table if you like, and put them in the window-
  seat. I can see them just as well there."</p>

  <p>The next few days he was indeed singularly busy in his steamy little
  hothouse, fussing about with charcoal, lumps of teak, moss, and all the other
  mysteries of the orchid cultivator. He considered he was having a wonderfully
  eventful time. In the evening he would talk about these new orchids to his
  friends, and over and over again he reverted to his expectation of something
  strange.</p>

  <p>Several of the Vandas and the Dendrobium died under his care, but
  presently the strange orchid began to show signs of life. He was delighted
  and took his housekeeper right away from jam-making to see it at once,
  directly he made the discovery.</p>

  <p>"That is a bud," he said, "and presently there will be a lot of leaves
  there, and those little things coming out here are aerial rootlets."</p>

  <p>"They look to me like little white fingers poking out of the brown," said
  his housekeeper. "I don't like them."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. They look like fingers trying to get at you. I can't help
  my likes and dislikes."</p>

  <p>"I don't know for certain, but I don't <i>think</i> there are any orchids
  I know that have aerial rootlets quite like that. It may be my fancy, of
  course. You see they are a little flattened at the ends."</p>

  <p>"I don't like 'em," said his housekeeper, suddenly shivering and turning
  away. "I know it's very silly of me&mdash;and I'm very sorry, particularly as
  you like the thing so much. But I can't help thinking of that corpse."</p>

  <p>"But it may not be that particular plant. That was merely a guess of
  mine."</p>

  <p>His housekeeper shrugged her shoulders. "Anyhow I don't like it," she
  said.</p>

  <p>Wedderburn felt a little hurt at her dislike to the plant. But that did
  not prevent his talking to her about orchids generally, and this orchid in
  particular, whenever he felt inclined.</p>

  <p>"There are such queer things about orchids," he said one day; "such
  possibilities of surprises. You know, Darwin studied their fertilisation, and
  showed that the whole structure of an ordinary orchid-flower was contrived in
  order that moths might carry the pollen from plant to plant. Well, it seems
  that there are lots of orchids known the flower of which cannot possibly be
  used for fertilisation in that way. Some of the Cypripediums, for instance;
  there are no insects known that can possibly fertilise them, and some of them
  have never be found with seed."</p>

  <p>"But how do they form new plants?"</p>

  <p>"By runners and tubers, and that kind of outgrowth. That is easily
  explained. The puzzle is, what are the flowers for?</p>

  <p>"Very likely," he added, "<i>my</i> orchid may be something extraordinary
  in that way. If so I shall study it. I have often thought of making
  researches as Darwin did. But hitherto I have not found the time, or
  something else has happened to prevent it. The leaves are beginning to unfold
  now. I do wish you would come and see them!"</p>

  <p>But she said that the orchid-house was so hot it gave her the headache.
  She had seen the plant once again, and the aerial rootlets, which were now
  some of them more than a foot long, had unfortunately reminded her of
  tentacles reaching out after something; and they got into her dreams, growing
  after her with incredible rapidity. So that she had settled to her entire
  satisfaction that she would not see that plant again, and Wedderburn had to
  admire its leaves alone. They were of the ordinary broad form, and a deep
  glossy green, with splashes and dots of deep red towards the base. He knew of
  no other leaves quite like them. The plant was placed on a low bench near the
  thermometer, and close by was a simple arrangement by which a tap dripped on
  the hot-water pipes and kept the air steamy. And he spent his afternoons now
  with some regularity meditating on the approaching flowering of this strange
  plant.</p>

  <p>And at last the great thing happened. Directly he entered the little glass
  house he knew that the spike had burst out, although his great
  <i>Palaeonophis Lowii</i> hid the corner where his new darling stood. There
  was a new odour in the air, a rich, intensely sweet scent, that overpowered
  every other in that crowded, steaming little greenhouse.</p>

  <p>Directly he noticed this he hurried down to the strange orchid. And,
  behold! the trailing green spikes bore now three great splashes of blossom,
  from which this overpowering sweetness proceeded. He stopped before them in
  an ecstasy of admiration.</p>

  <p>The flowers were white, with streaks of golden orange upon the petals; the
  heavy labellum was coiled into an intricate projection, and a wonderful
  bluish purple mingled there with the gold. He could see at once that the
  genus was altogether a new one. And the insufferable scent! How hot the place
  was! The blossoms swam before his eyes.</p>

  <p>He would see if the temperature was right. He made a step towards the
  thermometer. Suddenly everything appeared unsteady. The bricks on the floor
  were dancing up and down. Then the white blossoms, the green leaves behind
  them, the whole greenhouse, seemed to sweep sideways, and then in a curve
  upward.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>At half-past four his cousin made the tea, according to their invariable
  custom. But Wedderburn did not come in for his tea.</p>

  <p>"He is worshipping that horrid orchid," she told herself, and waited ten
  minutes. "His watch must have stopped. I will go and call him."</p>

  <p>She went straight to the hothouse, and, opening the door, called his name.
  There was no reply. She noticed that the air was very close, and loaded with
  an intense perfume. Then she saw something lying on the bricks between the
  hot-water pipes.</p>

  <p>For a minute, perhaps, she stood motionless.</p>

  <p>He was lying, face upward, at the foot of the strange orchid. The
  tentacle-like aerial rootlets no longer swayed freely in the air, but were
  crowded together, a tangle of grey ropes, and stretched tight with their ends
  closely applied to his chin and neck and hands.</p>

  <p>She did not understand. Then she saw from under one of the exultant
  tentacles upon his cheek there trickled a little thread of blood.</p>

  <p>With an inarticulate cry she ran towards him, and tried to pull him away
  from the leech-like suckers. She snapped two of these tentacles, and their
  sap dripped red.</p>

  <p>Then the overpowering scent of the blossom began to make her head reel.
  How they clung to him! She tore at the tough ropes, and he and the white
  inflorescence swam about her. She felt she was fainting, knew she must not.
  She left him and hastily opened the nearest door, and, after she had panted
  for a moment in the fresh air, she had a brilliant inspiration. She caught up
  a flower-pot and smashed in the windows at the end of the green-house. Then
  she re-entered. She tugged now with renewed strength at Wedderburn's
  motionless body, and brought the strange orchid crashing to the floor. It
  still clung with the grimmest tenacity to its victim. In a frenzy, she lugged
  it and him into the open air.</p>

  <p>Then she thought of tearing through the sucker rootlets one by one, and in
  another minute she had released him and was dragging him away from the
  horror.</p>

  <p>He was white and bleeding from a dozen circular patches.</p>

  <p>The odd-job man was coming up the garden, amazed at the smashing of glass,
  and saw her emerge, hauling the inanimate body with red-stained hands. For a
  moment he thought impossible things.</p>

  <p>"Bring some water!" she cried, and her voice dispelled his fancies. When,
  with unnatural alacrity, he returned with the water, he found her weeping
  with excitement, and with Wedderburn's head upon her knee, wiping the blood
  from his face.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" said Wedderburn, opening his eyes feebly, and closing
  them again at once.</p>

  <p>"Go and tell Annie to come out here to me, and then go for Doctor Haddon
  at once," she said to the odd-job man so soon as he brought the water; and
  added, seeing he hesitated, "I will tell you all about it when you come
  back."</p>

  <p>Presently Wedderburn opened his eyes again, and, seeing that he was
  troubled by the puzzle of his position, she explained to him, "You fainted in
  the hothouse."</p>

  <p>"And the orchid?"</p>

  <p>"I will see to that," she said.</p>

  <p>Wedderburn had lost a good deal of blood, but beyond that he had suffered
  no very great injury. They gave him brandy mixed with some pink extract of
  meat, and carried him upstairs to bed. His housekeeper told her incredible
  story in fragments to Dr Haddon. "Come to the orchid-house and see," she
  said.</p>

  <p>The cold outer air was blowing in through the open door, and the sickly
  perfume was almost dispelled. Most of the torn aerial rootlets lay already
  withered amidst a number of dark stains upon the bricks. The stem of the
  inflorescence was broken by the fall of the plant, and the flowers were
  growing limp and brown at the edges of the petals. The doctor stooped towards
  it, then saw that one of the aerial rootlets still stirred feebly, and
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>The next morning the strange orchid still lay there, black now and
  putrescent. The door banged intermittently in the morning breeze, and all the
  array of Wedderburn's orchids was shrivelled and prostrate. But Wedderburn
  himself was bright and garrulous upstairs in the glory of his strange
  adventure.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="story09"
     name="story09">IN THE AVU OBSERVATORY</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, August 9, 1894</h3>

  <p>The observatory at Avu, in Borneo, stands on the spur of the mountain. To
  the north rises the old crater, black at night against the unfathomable blue
  of the sky. From the little circular building, with its mushroom dome, the
  slopes plunge steeply downward into the black mysteries of the tropical
  forest beneath. The little house in which the observer and his assistant live
  is about fifty yards from the observatory, and beyond this are the huts of
  their native attendants.</p>

  <p>Thaddy, the chief observer, was down with a slight fever. His assistant,
  Woodhouse, paused for a moment in silent contemplation of the tropical night
  before commencing his solitary vigil. The night was very still. Now and then
  voices and laughter came from the native huts, or the cry of some strange
  animal was heard from the midst of the mystery of the forest. Nocturnal
  insects appeared in ghostly fashion out of the darkness, and fluttered round
  his light. He thought, perhaps, of all the possibilities of discovery that
  still lay in the black tangle beneath him; for to the naturalist the virgin
  forests of Borneo are still a wonderland full of strange questions and
  half-suspected discoveries. Woodhouse carried a small lantern in his hand,
  and its yellow glow contrasted vividly with the infinite series of tints
  between lavender-blue and black in which the landscape was painted. His hands
  and face were smeared with ointment against the attacks of the
  mosquitoes.</p>

  <p>Even in these days of celestial photography, work done in a purely
  temporary erection, and with only the most primitive appliances in addition
  to the telescope, still involves a very large amount of cramped and
  motionless watching. He sighed as he thought of the physical fatigues before
  him, stretched himself, and entered the observatory.</p>

  <p>The reader is probably familiar with the structure of an ordinary
  astronomical observatory. The building is usually cylindrical in shape, with
  a very light hemispherical roof capable of being turned round from the
  interior. The telescope is supported upon a stone pillar in the centre, and a
  clockwork arrangement compensates for the earth's rotation, and allows a star
  once found to be continuously observed. Besides this, there is a compact
  tracery of wheels and screws about its point of support, by which the
  astronomer adjusts it. There is, of course, a slit in the movable roof which
  follows the eye of the telescope in its survey of the heavens. The observer
  sits or lies on a sloping wooden arrangement, which he can wheel to any part
  of the observatory as the position of the telescope may require. Within it is
  advisable to have things as dark as possible, in order to enhance the
  brilliance of the stars observed.</p>

  <p>The lantern flared as Woodhouse entered his circular den, and the general
  darkness fled into black shadows behind the big machine, from which it
  presently seemed to creep back over the whole place again as the light waned.
  The slit was a profound transparent blue, in which six stars shone with
  tropical brilliance, and their light lay, a pallid gleam, along the black
  tube of the instrument. Woodhouse shifted the roof, and then proceeding to
  the telescope, turned first one wheel and then another, the great cylinder
  slowly swinging into a new position. Then he glanced through the finder, the
  little companion telescope, moved the roof a little more, made some further
  adjustments, and set the clockwork in motion. He took off his jacket, for the
  night was very hot, and pushed into position the uncomfortable seat to which
  he was condemned for the next four hours. Then with a sigh he resigned
  himself to his watch upon the mysteries of space.</p>

  <p>There was no sound now in the observatory, and the lantern waned steadily.
  Outside there was the occasional cry of some animal in alarm or pain, or
  calling to its mate, and the intermittent sounds of the Malay and Dyak
  servants. Presently one of the men began a queer chanting song, in which the
  others joined at intervals. After this it would seem that they turned in for
  the night, for no further sound came from their direction, and the whispering
  stillness became more and more profound.</p>

  <p>The clockwork ticked steadily. The shrill hum of a mosquito explored the
  place and grew shriller in indignation at Woodhouse's ointment. Then the
  lantern went out and all the observatory was black.</p>

  <p>Woodhouse shifted his position presently, when the slow movement of the
  telescope had carried it beyond the limits of his comfort.</p>

  <p>He was watching a little group of stars in the Milky Way, in one of which
  his chief had seen or fancied a remarkable colour variability. It was not a
  part of the regular work for which the establishment existed, and for that
  reason perhaps Woodhouse was deeply interested. He must have forgotten things
  terrestrial. All his attention was concentrated upon the great blue circle of
  the telescope field&mdash;a circle powdered, so it seemed, with an
  innumerable multitude of stars, and all luminous against the blackness of its
  setting. As he watched he seemed to himself to become incorporeal, as if he
  too were floating in the ether of space. Infinitely remote was the faint red
  spot he was observing.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the stars were blotted out. A flash of blackness passed, and they
  were visible again.</p>

  <p>"Queer," said Woodhouse. "Must have been a bird."</p>

  <p>The thing happened again, and immediately after the great tube shivered as
  though it had been struck. Then the dome of the observatory resounded with a
  series of thundering blows. The stars seemed to sweep aside as the telescope
  &mdash;which had been undamped&mdash;swung round and away from the slit in
  the roof.</p>

  <p>"Great Scott!" cried Woodhouse. "What's this?"</p>

  <p>Some huge vague black shape, with a flapping something like a wing, seemed
  to be struggling in the aperture of the roof. In another moment the slit was
  clear again, and the luminous haze of the Milky Way shone warm and
  bright.</p>

  <p>The interior of the roof was perfectly black, and only a scraping sound
  marked the whereabouts of the unknown creature.</p>

  <p>Woodhouse had scrambled from the seat to his feet. He was trembling
  violently and in a perspiration with the suddenness of the occurrence. Was
  the thing, whatever it was, inside or out? It was big, whatever else it might
  be. Something shot across the skylight, and the telescope swayed. He started
  violently and put his arm up. It was in the observatory, then, with him. It
  was clinging to the roof, apparently. What the devil was it? Could it see
  him?</p>

  <p>He stood for perhaps a minute in a state of stupefaction. The beast,
  whatever it was, clawed at the interior of the dome, and then something
  flapped almost into his face, and he saw the momentary gleam of starlight on
  a skin like oiled leather. His water-bottle was knocked off his little table
  with a smash.</p>

  <p>The sense of some strange bird-creature hovering a few yards from his face
  in the darkness was indescribably unpleasant to Woodhouse. As his thought
  returned he concluded that it must be some night-bird or large bat. At any
  risk he would see what it was, and pulling a match from his pocket, he tried
  to strike it on the telescope seat. There was a smoking streak of
  phosphorescent light, the match flared for a moment, and he saw a vast wing
  sweeping towards him, a gleam of grey-brown fur, and then he was struck in
  the face and the match knocked out of his hand. The blow was aimed at his
  temple, and a claw tore sideways down to his cheek. He reeled and fell, and
  he heard the extinguished lantern smash. Another blow followed as he fell. He
  was partly stunned, he felt his own warm blood stream out upon his face.
  Instinctively he felt his eyes had been struck at, and, turning over on his
  face to protect them, tried to crawl under the protection of the telescope.
  He was struck again upon the back, and he heard his jacket rip, and then the
  thing hit the roof of the observatory. He edged as far as he could between
  the wooden seat and the eyepiece of the instrument, and turned his body round
  so that it was chiefly his feet that were exposed. With these he could at
  least kick. He was still in a mystified state. The strange beast banged about
  in the darkness, and presently clung to the telescope, making it sway and the
  gear rattle. Once it flapped near him, and he kicked out madly and felt a
  soft body with his feet. He was horribly scared now. It must be a big thing
  to swing the telescope like that. He saw for a moment the outline of a head
  black against the starlight, with sharply-pointed upstanding ears and a crest
  between them. It seemed to him to be as big as a mastiffs. Then he began to
  bawl out as loudly as he could for help.</p>

  <p>At that the thing came down upon him again. As it did so his hand touched
  something beside him on the floor. He kicked out, and the next moment his
  ankle was gripped and held by a row of keen teeth. He yelled again, and tried
  to free his leg by kicking with the other. Then he realised he had the broken
  water-bottle at his hand, and, snatching it, he struggled into a sitting
  posture, and feeling in the darkness towards his foot, gripped a velvety ear,
  like the ear of a big cat. He had seized the water-bottle by its neck and
  brought it down with a shivering crash upon the head of the strange beast. He
  repeated the blow, and then stabbed and jobbed with the jagged end of it, in
  the darkness, where he judged the face might be.</p>

  <p>The small teeth relaxed their hold, and at once Woodhouse pulled his leg
  free and kicked hard. He felt the sickening feel of fur and bone giving under
  his boot. There was a tearing bite at his arm, and he struck over it at the
  face, as he judged, and hit damp fur.</p>

  <p>There was a pause; then he heard the sound of claws and the dragging of a
  heavy body away from him over the observatory floor. Then there was silence,
  broken only by his own sobbing breathing, and a sound like licking.
  Everything was black except the parallelogram of the blue skylight with the
  luminous dust of stars, against which the end of the telescope now appeared
  in silhouette. He waited, as it seemed, an interminable time. Was the thing
  coming on again? He felt in his trouser-pocket for some matches, and found
  one remaining. He tried to strike this, but the floor was wet, and it spat
  and went out. He cursed. He could not see where the door was situated. In his
  struggle he had quite lost his bearings. The strange beast, disturbed by the
  splutter of the match, began to move again. "Time!" called Woodhouse, with a
  sudden gleam of mirth, but the thing was not coming at him again. He must
  have hurt it, he thought, with the broken bottle. He felt a dull pain in his
  ankle. Probably he was bleeding there. He wondered if it would support him if
  he tried to stand up. The night outside was very still. There was no sound of
  any one moving. The sleepy fools had not heard those wings battering upon the
  dome, nor his shouts. It was no good wasting strength in shouting. The
  monster flapped its wings and startled him into a defensive attitude. He hit
  his elbow against the seat, and it fell over with a crash. He cursed this,
  and then he cursed the darkness.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the oblong patch of starlight seemed to sway to and fro. Was he
  going to faint? It would never do to faint. He clenched his fists and set his
  teeth to hold himself together. Where had the door got to? It occurred to him
  he could get his bearings by the stars visible through the skylight. The
  patch of stars he saw was in Sagittarius and south-eastward; the door was
  north&mdash;or was it north by west? He tried to think. If he could get the
  door open he might retreat. It might be the thing was wounded. The suspense
  was beastly. "Look here!" he said, "if you don't come on, I shall come at
  you."</p>

  <p>Then the thing began clambering up the side of the observatory, and he saw
  its black outline gradually blot out the skylight. Was it in retreat? He
  forgot about the door, and watched as the dome shifted and creaked. Somehow
  he did not feel very frightened or excited now. He felt a curious sinking
  sensation inside him. The sharply-defined patch of light, with the black form
  moving across it, seemed to be growing smaller and smaller. That was curious.
  He began to feel very thirsty, and yet he did not feel inclined to get
  anything to drink. He seemed to be sliding down a long funnel.</p>

  <p>He felt a burning sensation in his throat, and then he perceived it was
  broad daylight, and that one of the Dyak servants was looking at him with a
  curious expression. Then there was the top of Thaddy's face upside down.
  Funny fellow, Thaddy, to go about like that! Then he grasped the situation
  better, and perceived that his head was on Thaddy's knee, and Thaddy was
  giving him brandy. And then he saw the eyepiece of the telescope with a lot
  of red smears on it. He began to remember.</p>

  <p>"You've made this observatory in a pretty mess," said Thaddy.</p>

  <p>The Dyak boy was beating up an egg in brandy. Woodhouse took this and sat
  up. He felt a sharp twinge of pain. His ankle was tied up, so were his arm
  and the side of his face. The smashed glass, red-stained, lay about the
  floor, the telescope seat was overturned, and by the opposite wall was a dark
  pool. The door was open, and he saw the grey summit of the mountain against a
  brilliant background of blue sky.</p>

  <p>"Pah!" said Woodhouse. "Who's been killing calves here? Take me out of
  it."</p>

  <p>Then he remembered the Thing, and the fight he had had with it.</p>

  <p>"What <i>was</i> it?" he said to Thaddy&mdash;"The Thing I fought
  with?"</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> know that best," said Thaddy. "But, anyhow, don't worry
  yourself now about it. Have some more to drink."</p>

  <p>Thaddy, however, was curious enough, and it was a hard struggle between
  duty and inclination to keep Woodhouse quiet until he was decently put away
  in bed, and had slept upon the copious dose of meat-extract Thaddy considered
  advisable. They then talked it over together.</p>

  <p>"It was," said Woodhouse, "more like a big bat than anything else in the
  world. It had sharp, short ears, and soft fur, and its wings were leathery.
  Its teeth were little, but devilish sharp, and its jaw could not have been
  very strong or else it would have bitten through my ankle."</p>

  <p>"It has pretty nearly," said Thaddy.</p>

  <p>"It seemed to me to hit out with its claws pretty freely. That is about as
  much as I know about the beast. Our conversation was intimate, so to speak,
  and yet not confidential."</p>

  <p>"The Dyak chaps talk about a Big Colugo, a Klang-utang&mdash;whatever that
  may be. It does not often attack man, but I suppose you made it nervous. They
  say there is a Big Colugo and a Little Colugo, and a something else that
  sounds like gobble. They all fly about at night. For my own part I know there
  are flying foxes and flying lemurs about here, but they are none of them very
  big beasts."</p>

  <p>"There are more things in heaven and earth," said Woodhouse&mdash;and
  Thaddy groaned at the quotation&mdash;"and more particularly in the forests
  of Borneo, than are dreamt of in our philosophies. On the whole, if the
  Borneo fauna is going to disgorge any more of its novelties upon me, I should
  prefer that it did so when I was not occupied in the observatory at night and
  alone."</p>

     name="story10">THROUGH A WINDOW</a></h2>

  <h3>First published as "At A Window" in <i>Black &amp; White</i>, August 25,
  1894</h3>

  <p>After his legs were set, they carried Bailey into the study and put him on
  a couch before the open window. There he lay, a live&mdash;even a feverish
  man down to the loins, and below that a double-barrelled mummy swathed in
  white wrappings. He tried to read, even tried to write a little, but most of
  the time he looked out of the window.</p>

  <p>He had thought the window cheerful to begin with, but now he thanked God
  for it many times a day. Within, the room was dim and grey, and in the
  reflected light the wear of the furniture showed plainly. His medicine and
  drink stood on the little table, with such litter as the bare branches of a
  bunch of grapes or the ashes of a cigar upon a green plate, or a day old
  evening paper. The view outside was flooded with light, and across the corner
  of it came the head of the acacia, and at the foot the top of the balcony-
  railing of hammered iron. In the foreground was the weltering silver of the
  river, never quiet and yet never tiresome. Beyond was the reedy bank, a broad
  stretch of meadow land, and then a dark line of trees ending in a group of
  poplars at the distant bend of the river, and, upstanding behind them, a
  square church tower.</p>

  <p>Up and down the river, all day long, things were passing. Now a string of
  barges drifting down to London, piled with lime or barrels of beer; then a
  steam-launch, disengaging heavy masses of black smoke, and disturbing the
  whole width of the river with long rolling waves; then an impetuous electric
  launch, and then a boatload of pleasure-seekers, a solitary sculler, or a
  four from some rowing club. Perhaps the river was quietest of a morning or
  late at night. One moonlight night some people drifted down singing, and with
  a zither playing&mdash;it sounded very pleasantly across the water.</p>

  <p>In a few days Bailey began to recognise some of the craft; in a week he
  knew the intimate history of half-a-dozen. The launch <i>Luzon</i>, from
  Fitzgibbon's, two miles up, would go fretting by, sometimes three or four
  times a day, conspicuous with its colouring of Indian-red and yellow, and its
  two Oriental attendants; and one day, to Bailey's vast amusement, the
  house-boat <i>Purple Emperor</i> came to a stop outside, and breakfasted in
  the most shameless domesticity. Then one afternoon, the captain of a
  slow-moving barge began a quarrel with his wife as they came into sight from
  the left, and had carried it to personal violence before he vanished behind
  the window-frame to the right. Bailey regarded all this as an entertainment
  got up to while away his illness, and applauded all the more moving
  incidents. Mrs Green, coming in at rare intervals with his meals, would catch
  him clapping his hands or softly crying, "Encore!" But the river players had
  other engagements, and his encore went unheeded.</p>

  <p>"I should never have thought I could take such an interest in things that
  did not concern me," said Bailey to Wilderspin, who used to come in in his
  nervous, friendly way and try to comfort the sufferer by being talked to. "I
  thought this idle capacity was distinctive of little children and old maids.
  But it's just circumstances. I simply can't work, and things have to drift;
  it's no good to fret and struggle. And so I lie here and am as amused as a
  baby with a rattle, at this river and its affairs.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes, of course, it gets a bit dull, but not often.</p>

  <p>"I would give anything, Wilderspin, for a swamp&mdash;just one swamp
  &mdash;once. Heads swimming and a steam launch to the rescue, and a chap or
  so hauled out with a boat-hook... There goes Fitzgibbon's launch! They have a
  new boat-hook, I see, and the little blackie is still in the dumps. I don't
  think he's very well, Wilderspin. He's been like that for two or three days,
  squatting sulky-fashion and meditating over the churning of the water.
  Unwholesome for him to be always staring at the frothy water running away
  from the stern."</p>

  <p>They watched the little steamer fuss across the patch of sunlit river,
  suffer momentary occultation from the acacia, and glide out of sight behind
  the dark window-frame.</p>

  <p>"I'm getting a wonderful eye for details," said Bailey: "I spotted that
  new boat-hook at once. The other nigger is a funny little chap. He never used
  to swagger with the old boat-hook like that."</p>

  <p>"Malays, aren't they?" said Wilderspin.</p>

  <p>"Don't know," said Bailey. "I thought one called all that sort of manner
  Lascar."</p>

  <p>Then he began to tell Wilderspin what he knew of the private affairs of
  the houseboat, <i>Purple Emperor</i>. "Funny," he said, "how these people
  come from all points of the compass&mdash;from Oxford and Windsor, from Asia
  and Africa&mdash;and gather and pass opposite the window just to entertain
  me. One man floated out of the infinite the day before yesterday, caught one
  perfect crab opposite, lost and recovered a scull, and passed on again.
  Probably he will never come into my life again. So far as I am concerned, he
  has lived and had his little troubles, perhaps thirty&mdash;perhaps forty
  &mdash;years on the earth, merely to make an ass of himself for three minutes
  in front of my window. Wonderful thing, Wilderspin, if you come to think of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Wilderspin; "<i>isn't</i> it?"</p>

  <p>A day or two after this Bailey had a brilliant morning. Indeed, towards
  the end of the affair, it became almost as exciting as any window show very
  well could be. We will, however, begin at the beginning.</p>

  <p>Bailey was all alone in the house, for his housekeeper had gone into the
  town three miles away to pay bills, and the servant had her holiday. The
  morning began dull. A canoe went up about half-past nine, and later a
  boat-load of camping men came down. But this was mere margin. Things became
  cheerful about ten o'clock.</p>

  <p>It began with something white fluttering in the remote distance where the
  three poplars marked the river bend. "Pocket-handkerchief," said Bailey, when
  he saw it "No. Too big! Flag perhaps."</p>

  <p>However, it was not a flag, for it jumped about. "Man in whites running
  fast, and this way," said Bailey. "That's luck! But his whites are precious
  loose!"</p>

  <p>Then a singular thing happened. There was a minute pink gleam among the
  dark trees in the distance, and a little puff of pale grey that began to
  drift and vanish eastward. The man in white jumped and continued running.
  Presently the report of the shot arrived.</p>

  <p>"What the devil!" said Bailey. "Looks as if someone was shooting at
  him."</p>

  <p>He sat up stiffly and stared hard. The white figure was coming along the
  pathway through the corn. "It's one of those niggers from the Fitzgibbon's,"
  said Bailey; "or may I be hanged! I wonder why he keeps sawing with his
  arm."</p>

  <p>Then three other figures became indistinctly visible against the dark
  background of the trees.</p>

  <p>Abruptly on the opposite bank a man walked into the picture. He was black-
  bearded, dressed in flannels, had a red belt, and a vast grey felt hat. He
  walked, leaning very much forward and with his hands swinging before him.
  Behind him one could see the grass swept by the towing-rope of the boat he
  was dragging. He was steadfastly regarding the white figure that was hurrying
  through the corn. Suddenly he stopped. Then, with a peculiar gesture, Bailey
  could see that he began pulling in the tow-rope hand over hand. Over the
  water could be heard the voices of the people in the still invisible
  boat.</p>

  <p>"What are you after, Hagshot?" said someone.</p>

  <p>The individual with the red belt shouted something that was inaudible, and
  went on lugging in the rope, looking over his shoulder at the advancing white
  figure as he did so. He came down the bank, and the rope bent a lane among
  the reeds and lashed the water between his pulls.</p>

  <p>Then just the bows of the boat came into view, with the towing-mast and a
  tall, fair-haired man standing up and trying to see over the bank. The boat
  bumped unexpectedly among the reeds, and the tall, fair-haired man
  disappeared suddenly, having apparently fallen back into the invisible part
  of the boat. There was a curse and some indistinct laughter. Hagshot did not
  laugh, but hastily clambered into the boat and pushed off. Abruptly the boat
  passed out of Bailey's sight.</p>

  <p>But it was still audible. The melody of voices suggested that its
  occupants were busy telling each other what to do.</p>

  <p>The running figure was drawing near the bank. Bailey could now see clearly
  that it was one of Fitzgibbon's Orientals, and began to realise what the
  sinuous thing the man carried in his hand might be. Three other men followed
  one another through the corn, and the foremost carried what was probably the
  gun. They were perhaps two hundred yards or more behind the Malay.</p>

  <p>"It's a man hunt, by all that's holy!" said Bailey.</p>

  <p>The Malay stopped for a moment and surveyed the bank to the right. Then he
  left the path, and, breaking through the corn, vanished in that direction.
  The three pursuers followed suit, and their heads and gesticulating arms
  above the corn, after a brief interval, also went out of Bailey's field of
  vision.</p>

  <p>Bailey so far forgot himself as to swear. "Just as things were getting
  lively!" he said. Something like a woman's shriek came through the air. Then
  shouts, a howl, a dull whack upon the balcony outside that made Bailey jump,
  and then the report of a gun.</p>

  <p>"This is precious hard on an invalid," said Bailey.</p>

  <p>But more was to happen yet in his picture. In fact, a great deal more. The
  Malay appeared again, running now along the bank up stream. His stride had
  more swing and less pace in it than before. He was threatening someone ahead
  with the ugly krees he carried. The blade, Bailey noticed, was dull&mdash;it
  did not shine as steel should.</p>

  <p>Then came the tall, fair man, brandishing a boat-hook, and after him three
  other men in boating costume, running clumsily with oars. The man with the
  grey hat and red belt was not with them. After an interval the three men with
  the gun reappeared, still in the corn, but now near the river bank. They
  emerged upon the towing-path, and hurried after the others. The opposite bank
  was left blank and desolate again.</p>

  <p>The sick-room was disgraced by more profanity. "I would give my life to
  see the end of this," said Bailey. There were indistinct shouts up stream.
  Once they seemed to be coming nearer, but they disappointed him.</p>

  <p>Bailey sat and grumbled. He was still grumbling when his eye caught
  something black and round among the waves. "Hullo!" he said. He looked
  narrowly and saw two triangular black bodies frothing every now and then
  about a yard in front of this.</p>

  <p>He was still doubtful when the little band of pursuers came into sight
  again, and began to point to this floating object. They were talking eagerly.
  Then the man with the gun took aim.</p>

  <p>"He's swimming the river, by George!" said Bailey.</p>

  <p>The Malay looked round, saw the gun, and went under. He came up so close
  to Bailey's bank of the river that one of the bars of the balcony hid him for
  a moment. As he emerged the man with the gun fired. The Malay kept steadily
  onward&mdash;Bailey could see the wet hair on his forehead now and the krees
  between his teeth&mdash;and was presently hidden by the balcony.</p>

  <p>This seemed to Bailey an unendurable wrong. The man was lost to him for
  ever now, so he thought. Why couldn't the brute have got himself decently
  caught on the opposite bank, or shot in the water?</p>

  <p>"It's worse than Edwin Drood," said Bailey.</p>

  <p>Over the river, too, things had become an absolute blank. All seven men
  had gone down stream again, probably to get the boat and follow across.
  Bailey listened and waited. There was silence. "Surely it's not over like
  this," said Bailey.</p>

  <p>Five minutes passed&mdash;ten minutes. Then a tug with two barges went up
  stream. The attitudes of the men upon these were the attitudes of those who
  see nothing remarkable in earth, water, or sky. Clearly the whole affair had
  passed out of sight of the river. Probably the hunt had gone into the beech
  woods behind the house.</p>

  <p>"Confound it!" said Bailey. "To be continued again, and no chance this
  time of the sequel. But this is hard on a sick man."</p>

  <p>He heard a step on the staircase behind him and looking round saw the door
  open. Mrs Green came in and sat down, panting. She still had her bonnet on,
  her purse in her hand, and her little brown basket upon her arm. "Oh, there!"
  she said, and left Bailey to imagine the rest.</p>

  <p>"Have a little whisky and water, Mrs Green, and tell me about it," said
  Bailey.</p>

  <p>Sipping a little, the lady began to recover her powers of explanation.</p>

  <p>One of those black creatures at the Fitzgibbon's had gone mad, and was
  running about with a big knife, stabbing people. He had killed a groom, and
  stabbed the under-butler, and almost cut the arm off a boating gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Running amuck with a krees," said Bailey. "I thought that was it."</p>

  <p>And he was hiding in the wood when she came through it from the town.</p>

  <p>"What! Did he run after you?" asked Bailey, with a certain touch of glee
  in his voice.</p>

  <p>"No, that was the horrible part of it," Mrs Green explained. She had been
  right through the woods and had <i>never known he was there</i>. It was only
  when she met young Mr Fitzgibbon carrying his gun in the shrubbery that she
  heard anything about it. Apparently, what upset Mrs Green was the lost
  opportunity for emotion. She was determined, however, to make the most of
  what was left her.</p>

  <p>"To think he was there all the time!" she said, over and over again.</p>

  <p>Bailey endured this patiently enough for perhaps ten minutes. At last he
  thought it advisable to assert himself. "It's twenty past one, Mrs Green," he
  said. "Don't you think it time you got me something to eat?"</p>

  <p>This brought Mrs Green suddenly to her knees.</p>

  <p>"Oh Lord, sir!" she said. "Oh! don't go making me go out of this room,
  sir, till I know he's caught. He might have got into the house, sir. He might
  be creeping, creeping, with that knife of his, along the passage this
  very&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off suddenly and glared over him at the window. Her lower jaw
  dropped. Bailey turned his head sharply.</p>

  <p>For the space of half a second things seemed just as they were. There was
  the tree, the balcony, the shining river, the distant church tower. Then he
  noticed that the acacia was displaced about a foot to the right, and that it
  was quivering, and the leaves were rustling. The tree was shaken violently,
  and a heavy panting was audible.</p>

  <p>In another moment a hairy brown hand had appeared and clutched the balcony
  railings, and in another the face of the Malay was peering through these at
  the man on the couch. His expression was an unpleasant grin, by reason of the
  krees he held between his teeth, and he was bleeding from an ugly wound in
  his cheek. His hair wet to drying stuck out like horns from his head. His
  body was bare save for the wet trousers that clung to him. Bailey's first
  impulse was to spring from the couch, but his legs reminded him that this was
  impossible.</p>

  <p>By means of the balcony and tree the man slowly raised himself until he
  was visible to Mrs Green. With a choking cry she made for the door and
  fumbled with the handle.</p>

  <p>Bailey thought swiftly and clutched a medicine bottle in either hand. One
  he flung, and it smashed against the acacia. Silently and deliberately, and
  keeping his bright eyes fixed on Bailey, the Malay clambered into the
  balcony. Bailey, still clutching his second bottle, but with a sickening,
  sinking feeling about his heart, watched first one leg come over the railing
  and then the other.</p>

  <p>It was Bailey's impression that the Malay took about an hour to get his
  second leg over the rail. The period that elapsed before the sitting position
  was changed to a standing one seemed enormous&mdash;days, weeks, possibly a
  year or so. Yet Bailey had no clear impression of anything going on in his
  mind during that vast period, except a vague wonder at his inability to throw
  the second medicine bottle. Suddenly the Malay glanced over his shoulder.
  There was the crack of a rifle. He flung up his arms and came down upon the
  couch. Mrs Green began a dismal shriek that seemed likely to last until
  Doomsday. Bailey stared at the brown body with its shoulder blade driven in,
  that writhed painfully across his legs and rapidly staining and soaking the
  spotless bandages. Then he looked at the long krees, with the reddish streaks
  upon its blade, that lay an inch beyond the trembling brown fingers upon the
  floor. Then at Mrs Green, who had backed hard against the door and was
  staring at the body and shrieking in gusty outbursts as if she would wake the
  dead. And then the body was shaken by one last convulsive effort.</p>

  <p>The Malay gripped the krees, tried to raise himself with his left hand,
  and collapsed. Then he raised his head, stared for a moment at Mrs Green, and
  twisting his face round looked at Bailey. With a gasping groan the dying man
  succeeded in clutching the bed clothes with his disabled hand, and by a
  violent effort, which hurt Bailey's legs exceedingly, writhed sideways
  towards what must be his last victim. Then something seemed released in
  Bailey's mind and he brought down the second bottle with all his strength on
  to the Malay's face. The krees fell heavily upon the floor.</p>

  <p>"Easy with those legs," said Bailey, as young Fitzgibbon and one of the
  boating party lifted the body off him.</p>

  <p>Young Fitzgibbon was very white in the face. "I didn't mean to kill him,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"It's just as well," said Bailey.</p>

     name="story11">THE TREASURE IN THE FOREST</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, August 23, 1894</h3>

  <p>The canoe was now approaching the land. The bay opened out, and a gap in
  the white surf of the reef marked where the little river ran out to the sea;
  the thicker and deeper green of the virgin forest showed its course down the
  distant hill slope. The forest here came close to the beach. Far beyond, dim
  and almost cloudlike in texture, rose the mountains, like suddenly frozen
  waves. The sea was still save for an almost imperceptible swell. The sky
  blazed.</p>

  <p>The man with the carved paddle stopped. "It should be somewhere here," he
  said. He shipped the paddle and held his arms out straight before him.</p>

  <p>The other man had been in the fore part of the canoe, closely scrutinising
  the land. He had a sheet of yellow paper on his knee.</p>

  <p>"Come and look at this, Evans," he said.</p>

  <p>Both men spoke in low tones, and their lips were hard and dry.</p>

  <p>The man called Evans came swaying along the canoe until he could look over
  his companion's shoulder.</p>

  <p>The paper had the appearance of a rough map. By much folding it was
  creased and worn to the pitch of separation, and the second man held the
  discoloured fragments together where they had parted. On it one could dimly
  make out, in almost obliterated pencil, the outline of the bay.</p>

  <p>"Here," said Evans, "is the reef and here is the gap." He ran his thumb-
  nail over the chart.</p>

  <p>"This curved and twisting line is the river&mdash;I could do with a drink
  now!&mdash;and this star is the place."</p>

  <p>"You see this dotted line," said the man with the map; "it is a straight
  line, and runs from the opening of the reef to a clump of palm-trees. The
  star comes just where it cuts the river. We must mark the place as we go into
  the lagoon."</p>

  <p>"It's queer," said Evans, after a pause, "what these little marks down
  here are for. It looks like the plan of a house or something; but what all
  these little dashes, pointing this way and that, may mean I can't get a
  notion. And what's the writing?"</p>

  <p>"Chinese," said the man with the map.</p>

  <p>"Of course! <i>He</i> was a Chinee," said Evans.</p>

  <p>"They all were," said the man with the map.</p>

  <p>They both sat for some minutes staring at the land, while the canoe
  drifted slowly. Then Evans looked towards the paddle.</p>

  <p>"Your turn with the paddle now, Hooker," said he.</p>

  <p>And his companion quietly folded up his map, put it in his pocket, passed
  Evans carefully, and began to paddle. His movements were languid, like those
  of a man whose strength was nearly exhausted. Evans sat with his eyes half
  closed, watching the frothy breakwater of the coral creep nearer and nearer.
  The sky was like a furnace now, for the sun was near the zenith. Though they
  were so near the Treasure he did not feel the exaltation he had anticipated.
  The intense excitement of the struggle for the plan, and the long night
  voyage from the mainland in the unprovisioned canoe had, to use his own
  expression, "taken it out of him." He tried to arouse himself by directing
  his mind to the ingots the Chinamen had spoken of, but it would not rest
  there; it came back headlong to the thought of sweet water rippling in the
  river, and to the almost unendurable dryness of his lips and throat. The
  rhythmic wash of the sea upon the reef was becoming audible now, and it had a
  pleasant sound in his ears; the water washed along the side of the canoe, and
  the paddle dripped between each stroke. Presently he began to doze.</p>

  <p>He was still dimly conscious of the island, but a queer dream texture
  interwove with his sensations. Once again it was the night when he and Hooker
  had hit upon the Chinamen's secret; he saw the moonlit trees, the little fire
  burning, and the black figures of the three Chinamen&mdash;silvered on one
  side by moonlight, and on the other glowing from the firelight&mdash;and
  heard them talking together in pigeon-English&mdash;for they came from
  different provinces. Hooker had caught the drift of their talk first, and had
  motioned to him to listen. Fragments of the conversation were inaudible and
  fragments incomprehensible. A Spanish galleon from the Philippines hopelessly
  aground, and its treasure buried against the day of return, lay in the
  background of the story; a shipwrecked crew thinned by disease, a quarrel or
  so, and the needs of discipline, and at last taking to their boats never to
  be heard of again. Then Chang-hi, only a year since, wandering ashore, had
  happened upon the ingots hidden for two hundred years, had deserted his junk,
  and reburied them with infinite toil, single-handed but very safe. He laid
  great stress on the safety&mdash;it was a secret of his. Now he wanted help
  to return and exhume them. Presently the little map fluttered and the voices
  sank. A fine story for two stranded British wastrels to hear! Evans' dream
  shifted to the moment when he had Chang-hi's pigtail in his hand. The life of
  a Chinaman is scarcely sacred like a European's. The cunning little face of
  Chang-hi, first keen and furious like a startled snake, and then fearful,
  treacherous and pitiful, became overwhelmingly prominent in the dream. At the
  end Chang-hi had grinned, a most incomprehensible and startling grin.
  Abruptly things became very unpleasant, as they will do at times in dreams.
  Chang-hi gibbered and threatened him. He saw in his dream heaps and heaps, of
  gold, and Chang-hi intervening and struggling to hold him back from it. He
  took Chang-hi by the pigtail&mdash;how big the yellow brute was, and how he
  struggled and grinned! He kept growing bigger, too. Then the bright heaps of
  gold turned to a roaring furnace, and a vast devil, surprisingly like
  Chang-hi, but with a huge black tail, began to feed him with coals. They
  burnt his mouth horribly. Another devil was shouting his name: "Evans, Evans,
  you sleepy fool!"&mdash;or was it Hooker?</p>

  <p>He woke up. They were in the mouth of the lagoon.</p>

  <p>"There are the three palm-trees. It must be in a line with that clump of
  bushes," said his companion. "Mark that. If we go to those bushes and then
  strike into the bush in a straight line from here, we shall come to it when
  we come to the stream."</p>

  <p>They could see now where the mouth of the stream opened out. At the sight
  of it Evans revived. "Hurry up, man," he said, "Or by heaven I shall have to
  drink sea water!" He gnawed his hand and stared at the gleam of silver among
  the rocks and green tangle.</p>

  <p>Presently he turned almost fiercely upon Hooker. "Give <i>me</i> the
  paddle," he said.</p>

  <p>So they reached the river mouth. A little way up Hooker took some water in
  the hollow of his hand, tasted it, and spat it out. A little further he tried
  again. "This will do," he said, and they began drinking eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Curse this!" said Evans, suddenly. "It's too slow." And, leaning
  dangerously over the fore part of the canoe, he began to suck up the water
  with his lips.</p>

  <p>Presently they made an end of drinking, and, running the canoe into a
  little creek, were about to land among the thick growth that overhung the
  water.</p>

  <p>"We shall have to scramble through this to the beach to find our bushes
  and get the line to the place," said Evans.</p>

  <p>"We had better paddle round," said Hooker.</p>

  <p>So they pushed out again into the river and paddled back down it to the
  sea, and along the shore to the place where the clump of bushes grew. Here
  they landed, pulled the light canoe far up the beach, and then went up
  towards the edge of the jungle until they could see the opening of the reef
  and the bushes in a straight line. Evans had taken a native implement out of
  the canoe. It was L-shaped, and the transverse piece was armed with polished
  stone. Hooker carried the paddle. "It is straight now in this direction,"
  said he; "we must push through this till we strike the stream. Then we must
  prospect."</p>

  <p>They pushed through a close tangle of reeds, broad fronds, and young
  trees, and at first it was toilsome going, but very speedily the trees became
  larger and the ground beneath them opened out. The blaze of the sunlight was
  replaced by insensible degrees by cool shadow. The trees became at last vast
  pillars that rose up to a canopy of greenery far overhead. Dim white flowers
  hung from their stems, and ropy creepers swung from tree to tree. The shadow
  deepened. On the ground, blotched fungi and a red-brown incrustation became
  frequent.</p>

  <p>Evans shivered. "It seems almost cold here after the blaze outside."</p>

  <p>"I hope we are keeping to the straight," said Hooker.</p>

  <p>Presently they saw, far ahead, a gap in the sombre darkness where white
  shafts of hot sunlight smote into the forest. There also was brilliant green
  undergrowth, and coloured flowers. Then they heard the rush of water.</p>

  <p>"Here is the river. We should be close to it now," said Hooker.</p>

  <p>The vegetation was thick by the river bank. Great plants, as yet unnamed,
  grew among the roots of the big trees, and spread rosettes of huge green fans
  towards the strip of sky. Many flowers and a creeper with shiny foliage clung
  to the exposed stems. On the water of the broad, quiet pool which the
  treasure seekers now overlooked there floated big oval leaves and a waxen,
  pinkish-white flower not unlike a water-lily. Further, as the river bent away
  from them, the water suddenly frothed and became noisy in a rapid.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Evans.</p>

  <p>"We have swerved a little from the straight," said Hooker. "That was to be
  expected."</p>

  <p>He turned and looked into the dim cool shadows of the silent forest behind
  them. "If we beat a little way up and down the stream we should come to
  something."</p>

  <p>"You said&mdash;" began Evans.</p>

  <p>"<i>He</i> said there was a heap of stones," said Hooker.</p>

  <p>The two men looked at each other for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Let us try a little down-stream first," said Evans.</p>

  <p>They advanced slowly, looking curiously about them. Suddenly Evans
  stopped. "What the devil's that?" he said.</p>

  <p>Hooker followed his finger. "Something blue," he said. It had come into
  view as they topped a gentle swell of the ground. Then he began to
  distinguish what it was.</p>

  <p>He advanced suddenly with hasty steps, until the body that belonged to the
  limp hand and arm had become visible. His grip tightened on the implement he
  carried. The thing was the figure of a Chinaman lying on his face. The
  <i>abandon</i> of the pose was unmistakable.</p>

  <p>The two men drew closer together, and stood staring silently at this
  ominous dead body. It lay in a clear space among the trees. Near by was a
  spade after the Chinese pattern, and further off lay a scattered heap of
  stones, close to a freshly dug hole.</p>

  <p>"Somebody has been here before," said Hooker, clearing his throat.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly Evans began to swear and rave, and stamp upon the
  ground.</p>

  <p>Hooker turned white but said nothing. He advanced towards the prostrate
  body. He saw the neck was puffed and purple, and the hands and ankles
  swollen. "Pah!" he said, and suddenly turned away and went towards the
  excavation. He gave a cry of surprise. He shouted to Evans, who was following
  him slowly.</p>

  <p>"You fool! It's all right It's here still." Then he turned again and
  looked at the dead Chinaman, and then again at the hole.</p>

  <p>Evans hurried to the hole. Already half exposed by the ill-fated wretch
  beside them lay a number of dull yellow bars. He bent down in the hole, and,
  clearing off the soil with his bare hands, hastily pulled one of the heavy
  masses out. As he did so a little thorn pricked his hand. He pulled the
  delicate spike out with his fingers and lifted the ingot.</p>

  <p>"Only gold or lead could weigh like this," he said exultantly.</p>

  <p>Hooker was still looking at the dead Chinaman. He was puzzled.</p>

  <p>"He stole a march on his friends," he said at last. "He came here alone,
  and some poisonous snake has killed him...I wonder how he found the
  place."</p>

  <p>Evans stood with the ingot in his hands. What did a dead Chinaman signify?
  "We shall have to take this stuff to the mainland piecemeal, and bury it
  there for a while. How shall we get it to the canoe?"</p>

  <p>He took his jacket off and spread it on the ground, and flung two or three
  ingots into it. Presently he found that another little thorn had punctured
  his skin.</p>

  <p>"This is as much as we can carry," said he. Then suddenly, with a queer
  rush of irritation, "What are you staring at?"</p>

  <p>Hooker turned to him. "I can't stand...him." He nodded towards the corpse.
  "It's so like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" said Evans. "All Chinamen are alike."</p>

  <p>Hooker looked into his face. "I'm going to bury <i>that</i>, anyhow,
  before I lend a hand with this stuff."</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Hooker," said Evans. "Let that mass of corruption
  bide."</p>

  <p>Hooker hesitated, and then his eye went carefully over the brown soil
  about them. "It scares me somehow," he said.</p>

  <p>"The thing is," said Evans, "what to do with these ingots. Shall we re-
  bury them over here, or take them across the strait in the canoe?"</p>

  <p>Hooker thought. His puzzled gaze wandered among the tall tree-trunks, and
  up into the remote sunlit greenery overhead. He shivered again as his eye
  rested upon the blue figure of the Chinaman. He stared searchingly among the
  grey depths between the trees.</p>

  <p>"What's come to you, Hooker?" said Evans. "Have you lost your wits?"</p>

  <p>"Let's get the gold out of this place, anyhow," said Hooker.</p>

  <p>He took the ends of the collar of the coat in his hands, and Evans took
  the opposite corners, and they lifted the mass. "Which way?" said Evans. "To
  the canoe?"</p>

  <p>"It's queer," said Evans, when they had advanced only a few steps, "but my
  arms ache still with that paddling."</p>

  <p>"Curse it!" he said. "But they ache! I must rest."</p>

  <p>They let the coat down. Evans' face was white, and little drops of sweat
  stood out upon his forehead. "It's stuffy, somehow, in this forest."</p>

  <p>Then with an abrupt transition to unreasonable anger: "What is the good of
  waiting here all the day? Lend a hand, I say! You have done nothing but moon
  since we saw the dead Chinaman."</p>

  <p>Hooker was looking steadfastly at his companion's face. He helped raise
  the coat bearing the ingots, and they went forward perhaps a hundred yards in
  silence. Evans began to breathe heavily. "Can't you speak?" he said.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you?" said Hooker.</p>

  <p>Evans stumbled, and then with a sudden curse flung the coat from him. He
  stood for a moment staring at Hooker, and then with a groan clutched at his
  own throat.</p>

  <p>"Don't come near me," he said, and went and leant against a tree. Then in
  a steadier voice, "I'll be better in a minute."</p>

  <p>Presently his grip upon the trunk loosened, and he slipped slowly down the
  stem of the tree until he was a crumpled heap at its foot. His hands were
  clenched convulsively. His face became distorted with pain. Hooker approached
  him.</p>

  <p>"Don't touch me! Don't touch me!" said Evans in a stifled voice. "Put the
  gold back on the coat."</p>

  <p>"Can't I do anything for you?" said Hooker.</p>

  <p>"Put the gold back on the coat."</p>

  <p>As Hooker handled the ingots he felt a little prick on the ball of his
  thumb. He looked at his hand and saw a slender thorn, perhaps two inches in
  length.</p>

  <p>Evans gave an inarticulate cry and rolled over.</p>

  <p>Hooker's jaw dropped. He stared at the thorn for a moment with dilated
  eyes. Then he looked at Evans, who was now crumpled together on the ground,
  his back bending and straitening spasmodically. Then he looked through the
  pillars of the trees and net-work of creeper stems, to where in the dim grey
  shadow the blue-clad body of the Chinaman was still indistinctly visible. He
  thought of the little dashes in the corner of the plan, and in a moment he
  understood.</p>

  <p>"God help me!" he said. For the thorns were similar to those the Dyaks
  poison and use in their blowing-tubes. He understood now what Chang-hi's
  assurance of the safety of his treasure meant. He understood that grin
  now.</p>

  <p>"Evans!" he cried.</p>

  <p>But Evans was silent and motionless now, save for a horrible spasmodic
  twitching of his limbs. A profound silence brooded over the forest.</p>

  <p>Then Hooker began to suck furiously at the little pink spot on the ball of
  his thumb&mdash;sucking for dear life. Presently he felt a strange aching
  pain in his arms and shoulders, and his fingers seemed difficult to bend.
  Then he knew that sucking was no good.</p>

  <p>Abruptly he stopped, and sitting down by the pile of ingots, and resting
  his chin upon his hands and his elbows upon his knees, stared at the
  distorted but still stirring body of his companion. Chang-hi's grin came in
  his mind again. The dull pain spread towards his throat and grew slowly in
  intensity. Far above him a faint breeze stirred the greenery, and the white
  petals of some unknown flower came floating down through the gloom.</p>

     name="story12">THE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, September 6, 1894</h3>

  <p>The chief attendant of the three dynamos that buzzed and rattled at
  Camberwell, and kept the electric railway going, came out of Yorkshire, and
  his name was James Holroyd. He was a practical electrician, but fond of
  whisky, a heavy red-haired brute with irregular teeth. He doubted the
  existence of the deity, but accepted Carnot's cycle, and he had read
  Shakespeare and found him weak in chemistry. His helper came out of the
  mysterious East, and his name was Azuma-zi. But Holroyd called him Pooh-bah.
  Holroyd liked a nigger because he would stand kicking&mdash;a habit with
  Holroyd&mdash;and did not pry into the machinery and try to learn the ways of
  it. Certain odd possibilities of the negro mind brought into abrupt contact
  with the crown of our civilisation Holroyd never fully realised, though just
  at the end he got some inkling of them.</p>

  <p>To define Azuma-zi was beyond ethnology. He was, perhaps, more negroid
  than anything else, though his hair was curly rather than frizzy, and his
  nose had a bridge. Moreover, his skin was brown rather than black, and the
  whites of his eyes were yellow. His broad cheekbones and narrow chin gave his
  face something of the viperine V. His head, too, was broad behind, and low
  and narrow at the forehead, as if his brain had been twisted round in the
  reverse way to a European's. He was short of stature and still shorter of
  English. In conversation he made numerous odd noises of no known marketable
  value, and his infrequent words were carved and wrought into heraldic
  grotesqueness. Holroyd tried to elucidate his religious beliefs,
  and&mdash;especially after whisky&mdash;lectured to him against superstition
  and missionaries. Azuma-zi, however, shirked the discussion of his gods, even
  though he was kicked for it.</p>

  <p>Azuma-zi had come, clad in white but insufficient raiment, out of the
  stokehole of the Lord Clive, from the Straits Settlements, and beyond, into
  London. He had heard even in his youth of the greatness and riches of London,
  where all the women are white and fair, and even the beggars in the streets
  are white, and he arrived, with newly earned gold coins in his pocket, to
  worship at the shrine of civilisation. The day of his landing was a dismal
  one; the sky was dun, and a wind-worried drizzle filtered down to the greasy
  streets, but he plunged boldly into the delights of Shadwell, and was
  presently cast up, shattered in health, civilised in costume, penniless and,
  except in matters of the direst necessity, practically a dumb animal, to toil
  for James Holroyd and to be bullied by him in the dynamo shed at Camberwell.
  And to James Holroyd bullying was a labour of love.</p>

  <p>There were three dynamos with their engines at Camberwell. The two that
  had been there since the beginning were small machines; the larger one was
  new. The smaller machines made a reasonable noise; their straps hummed over
  the drums, every now and then the brushes buzzed and fizzled, and the air
  churned steadily, whoo! whoo! whoo! between their poles. One was loose in its
  foundations and kept the shed vibrating. But the big dynamo drowned these
  little noises altogether with the sustained drone of its iron core, which
  somehow set part of the ironwork humming. The place made the visitor's head
  reel with the throb, throb, throb of the engines, the rotation of the big
  wheels, the spinning ball-valves, the occasional spittings of the steam, and
  over all the deep, unceasing, surging note of the big dynamo. This last noise
  was from an engineering point of view a defect, but Azuma-zi accounted it
  unto the monster for mightiness and pride.</p>

  <p>If it were possible we would have the noises of that shed always about the
  reader as he reads, we would tell all our story to such an accompaniment. It
  was a steady stream of din, from which the ear picked out first one thread
  and then another; there was the intermittent snorting, panting, and seething
  of the steam engines, the suck and thud of their pistons, the dull beat on
  the air as the spokes of the great driving-wheels came round, a note the
  leather straps made as they ran tighter and looser, and a fretful tumult from
  the dynamos; and over all, sometimes inaudible, as the ear tired of it, and
  then creeping back upon the senses again, was this trombone note of the big
  machine. The floor never felt steady and quiet beneath one's feet, but
  quivered and jarred. It was a confusing, unsteady place, and enough to send
  anyone's thoughts jerking into odd zigzags. And for three months, while the
  big strike of the engineers was in progress, Holroyd, who was a blackleg, and
  Azuma-zi, who was a mere black, were never out of the stir and eddy of it,
  but slept and fed in the little wooden shanty between the shed and the
  gates.</p>

  <p>Holroyd delivered a theological lecture on the text of his big machine
  soon after Azuma-zi came. He had to shout to be heard in the din. "Look at
  that," said Holroyd; "where's your 'eathen idol to match 'im?" And Azuma-zi
  looked. For a moment Holroyd was inaudible, and then Azuma-zi heard: "Kill a
  hundred men. Twelve per cent. on the ordinary shares," said Holroyd, "and
  that's something like a Gord!"</p>

  <p>Holroyd was proud of his big dynamo, and expatiated upon its size and
  power to Azuma-zi until heaven knows what odd currents of thought that and
  the incessant whirling and shindy set up within the curly black cranium. He
  would explain in the most graphic manner the dozen or so ways in which a man
  might be killed by it, and once he gave Azuma-zi a shock as a sample of its
  quality. After that, in the breathing-times of his labour&mdash;it was heavy
  labour, being not only his own, but most of Holroyd's&mdash;Azuma-zi would
  sit and watch the big machine. Now and then the brushes would sparkle and
  spit blue flashes, at which Holroyd would swear, but all the rest was as
  smooth and rhythmic as breathing. The band ran shouting over the shaft, and
  ever behind one as one watched was the complacent thud of the piston. So it
  lived all day in this big airy shed, with him and Holroyd to wait upon it;
  not prisoned up and slaving to drive a ship as the other engines he
  knew&mdash;mere captive devils of the British Solomon&mdash;had been, but a
  machine enthroned. Those two smaller dynamos, Azuma-zi by force of contrast
  despised; the large one he privately christened the Lord of the Dynamos. They
  were fretful and irregular, but the big dynamo was steady. How great it was!
  How serene and easy in its working! Greater and calmer even than the Buddhas
  he had seen at Rangoon, and yet not motionless, but living! The great black
  coils spun, spun, spun, the rings ran round under the brushes, and the deep
  note of its coil steadied the whole. It affected Azuma-zi queerly.</p>

  <p>Azuma-zi was not fond of labour. He would sit about and watch the Lord of
  the Dynamos while Holroyd went away to persuade the yard porter to get
  whisky, although his proper place was not in the dynamo shed but behind the
  engines, and, moreover, if Holroyd caught him skulking he got hit for it with
  a rod of stout copper wire. He would go and stand close to the colossus and
  look up at the great leather band running overhead. There was a black patch
  on the band that came round, and it pleased him somehow among all the clatter
  to watch this return again and again. Odd thoughts spun with the whirl of it.
  Scientific people tell us that savages give souls to rocks and
  trees&mdash;and a machine is a thousand times more alive than a rock or a
  tree. And Azuma-zi was practically a savage still; the veneer of civilisation
  lay no deeper than his slop suit, his bruises, and the coal grime on his face
  and hands. His father before him had worshipped a meteoric stone, kindred
  blood it may be had splashed the broad wheels of Juggernaut.</p>

  <p>He took every opportunity Holroyd gave him of touching and hand, ling the
  great dynamo that was fascinating him. He polished and cleaned it until the
  metal parts were blinding in the sun. He felt a mysterious sense of service
  in doing this. He would go up to it and touch its spinning coils gently. The
  gods he had worshipped were all far away. The people in London hid their
  gods.</p>

  <p>At last his dim feelings grew more distinct, and took shape in thoughts
  and at last in acts. When he came into the roaring shed one morning he
  salaamed to the Lord of the Dynamos, and then when Holroyd was away, he went
  and whispered to the thundering machine that he was its servant, and prayed
  it to have pity on him and save him from Holroyd. As he did so a rare gleam
  of light came in through the open archway of the throbbing machine-shed, and
  the Lord of the Dynamos, as he whirled and roared, was radiant with pale
  gold. Then Azuma-zi knew that his service was acceptable to his Lord. After
  that he did not feel so lonely as he had done, and he had indeed been very
  much alone in London. And even when his work time was over, which was rare,
  he loitered about the shed.</p>

  <p>Then, the next time Holroyd maltreated him, Azuma-zi went presently to the
  Lord of the Dynamos and whispered, "Thou seest, O my Lord!" and the angry
  whir of the machinery seemed to answer him. Thereafter it appeared to him
  that whenever Holroyd came into the shed a different note came into the
  sounds of the dynamo. "My Lord bides his time," said Azuma-zi to himself.
  "The iniquity of the fool is not yet ripe." And he waited and watched for the
  day of reckoning. One day there was evidence of short circuiting, and
  Holroyd, making an unwary examination&mdash;it was in the afternoon&mdash;got
  a rather severe shock. Azuma-zi from behind the engine saw him jump off and
  curse at the peccant coil.</p>

  <p>"He is warned," said Azuma-zi to himself. "Surely my Lord is very
  patient."</p>

  <p>Holroyd had at first initiated his "nigger" into such elementary
  conceptions of the dynamo's working as would enable him to take temporary
  charge of the shed in his absence. But when he noticed the manner in which
  Azuma-zi hung about the monster he became suspicious. He dimly perceived his
  assistant was "up to something," and connecting him with the anointing of the
  coils with oil that had rotted the varnish in one place, he issued an edict,
  shouted above the confusion of the machinery, "Don't 'ee go nigh that big
  dynamo any more, Pooh-bah, or a'll take thy skin off!" Besides, if it pleased
  Azuma-zi to be near the big machine, it was plain sense and decency to keep
  him away from it.</p>

  <p>Azuma-zi obeyed at the time, but later he was caught bowing before the
  Lord of the Dynamos. At which Holroyd twisted his arm and kicked him as he
  turned to go away. As Azuma-zi presently stood behind the engine and glared
  at the back of the hated Holroyd, the noises of the machinery took a new
  rhythm, and sounded like four words in his native tongue.</p>

  <p>It is hard to say exactly what madness is. I fancy Azuma-zi was mad. The
  incessant din and whirl of the dynamo shed may have churned up his little
  store of knowledge and his big store of superstitious fancy, at last, into
  something akin to frenzy. At any rate, when the idea of making Holroyd a
  sacrifice to the Dynamo Fetich was thus suggested to him, it filled him with
  a strange tumult of exultant emotion.</p>

  <p>That night the two men and their black shadows were alone in the shed
  together. The shed was lit with one big arc light that winked and flickered
  purple. The shadows lay black behind the dynamos, the ball governors of the
  engines whirled from light to darkness, and their pistons beat loud and
  steady. The world outside seen through the open end of the shed seemed
  incredibly dim and remote. It seemed absolutely silent, too, since the riot
  of the machinery drowned every external sound. Far away was the black fence
  of the yard with grey shadowy houses behind, and above was the deep blue sky
  and the pale little stars. Azuma-zi suddenly walked across the centre of the
  shed above which the leather bands were running, and went into the shadow by
  the big dynamo. Holroyd heard a click, and the spin of the armature
  changed.</p>

  <p>"What are you dewin' with that switch?" he bawled in surprise. "Han't I
  told you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then he saw the set expression of Azuma-zi's eyes as the Asiatic came out
  of the shadow towards him.</p>

  <p>In another moment the two men were grappling fiercely in front of the
  great dynamo.</p>

  <p>"You coffee-headed fool!" gasped Holroyd, with a brown hand at his throat.
  "Keep off those contact rings." In another moment he was tripped and reeling
  back upon the Lord of the Dynamos. He instinctively loosened his grip upon
  his antagonist to save himself from the machine.</p>

  <p>The messenger, sent in furious haste from the station to find out what had
  happened in the dynamo shed, met Azuma-zi at the porter's lodge by the gate.
  Azuma-zi tried to explain something, but the messenger could make nothing of
  the black's incoherent English, and hurried on to the shed. The machines were
  all noisily at work, and nothing seemed to be disarranged. There was,
  however, a queer smell of singed hair. Then he saw an odd-looking crumpled
  mass clinging to the front of the big dynamo, and, approaching, recognised
  the distorted remains of Holroyd.</p>

  <p>The man stared and hesitated a moment. Then he saw the face, and shut his
  eyes convulsively. He turned on his heel before he opened them, so that he
  should not see Holroyd again, and went out of the shed to get advice and
  help.</p>

  <p>When Azuma-zi saw Holroyd die in the grip of the Great Dynamo he had been
  a little scared about the consequences of his act. Yet he felt strangely
  elated, and knew that the favour of the Lord Dynamo was upon him. His plan
  was already settled when he met the man coming from the station, and the
  scientific manager who speedily arrived on the scene jumped at the obvious
  conclusion of suicide. This expert scarcely noticed Azuma-zi, except to ask a
  few questions. Did he see Holroyd kill himself? Azuma-zi explained that he
  had been out of sight at the engine furnace until he heard a difference in
  the noise from the dynamo. It was not a difficult examination, being
  untinctured by suspicion.</p>

  <p>The distorted remains of Holroyd, which the electrician removed from the
  machine, were hastily covered by the porter with a coffee-stained tablecloth.
  Somebody, by a happy inspiration, fetched a medical man. The expert was
  chiefly anxious to get the machine at work again, for seven or eight trains
  had stopped midway in the stuffy tunnels of the electric railway. Azuma-zi,
  answering or misunderstanding the questions of the people who had by
  authority or impudence come into the shed, was presently sent back to the
  stoke-hole by the scientific manager. Of course a crowd collected outside the
  gates of the yard&mdash;a crowd, for no known reason, always hovers for a day
  or two near the scene of a sudden death in London; two or three reporters
  percolated somehow into the engine-shed, and one even got to Azuma-zi; but
  the scientific expert cleared them out again, being himself an amateur
  journalist.</p>

  <p>Presently the body was carried away, and public interest departed with it.
  Azuma-zi remained very quietly at his furnace, seeing over and over again in
  the coals a figure that wriggled violently and became still. An hour after
  the murder, to anyone coming into the shed it would have looked exactly as if
  nothing had ever happened there. Peeping presently from his engine-room the
  black saw the Lord Dynamo spin and whirl beside his little brothers, and the
  driving wheels were beating round, and the steam in the pistons went thud,
  thud, exactly as it had been earlier in the evening. After all, from the
  mechanical point of view, it had been a most insignificant incident&mdash;the
  mere temporary deflection of a current. But now the slender form and slender
  shadow of the scientific manager replaced the sturdy outline of Holroyd
  travelling up and down the lane of light upon the vibrating floor under the
  straps between the engines and the dynamos.</p>

  <p>"Have I not served my Lord?" said Azuma-zi inaudibly, from his shadow, and
  the note of the great dynamo rang out full and clear. As he looked at the big
  whirling mechanism the strange fascination of it that had been a little in
  abeyance since Holroyd's death, resumed its sway.</p>

  <p>Never had Azuma-zi seen a man killed so swiftly and pitilessly. The big
  humming machine had slain its victim without wavering for a second from its
  steady beating. It was indeed a mighty god.</p>

  <p>The unconscious scientific manager stood with his back to him, scribbling
  on a piece of paper. His shadow lay at the foot of the monster.</p>

  <p>"Was the Lord Dynamo still hungry? His servant was ready."</p>

  <p>Azuma-zi made a stealthy step forward; then stopped. The scientific
  manager suddenly stopped writing, and walked down the shed to the endmost of
  the dynamos, and began to examine the brushes.</p>

  <p>Azuma-zi hesitated, and then slipped across noiselessly into shadow by the
  switch. There he waited. Presently the manager's footsteps could be heard
  returning. He stopped in his old position, unconscious of the stoker
  crouching ten feet away from him. Then the big dynamo suddenly fizzled, and
  in another moment Azuma-zi had sprung out of the darkness upon him.</p>

  <p>First, the scientific manager was gripped round the body and swung towards
  the big dynamo, then, kicking with his knee and forcing his antagonist's head
  down with his hands, he loosened the grip on his waist and swung round away
  from the machine. Then the black grasped him again, putting a curly head
  against his chest, and they swayed and panted as it seemed for an age or so.
  Then the scientific manager was impelled to catch a black ear in his teeth
  and bite furiously. The black yelled hideously.</p>

  <p>They rolled over on the floor, and the black, who had apparently slipped
  from the vice of the teeth or parted with some ear&mdash;the scientific
  manager wondered which at the time&mdash;tried to throttle him. The
  scientific manager was making some ineffectual attempts to claw something
  with his hands and to kick, when the welcome sound of quick footsteps sounded
  on the floor. The next moment Azuma-zi had left him and darted towards the
  big dynamo. There was a splutter amid the roar.</p>

  <p>The officer of the company who had entered, stood staring as Azuma-zi
  caught the naked terminals in his hands, gave one horrible convulsion, and
  then hung motionless from the machine, his face violently distorted.</p>

  <p>"I'm jolly glad you came in when you did," said the scientific manager,
  still sitting on the floor.</p>

  <p>He looked at the still quivering figure.</p>

  <p>"It's not a nice death to die, apparently&mdash;but it is quick."</p>

  <p>The official was still staring at the body. He was a man of slow
  apprehension.</p>

  <p>There was a pause.</p>

  <p>The scientific manager got up on his feet rather awkwardly. He ran his
  fingers along his collar thoughtfully, and moved his head to and fro several
  times.</p>

  <p>"Poor Holroyd! I see now." Then almost mechanically he went towards the
  switch in the shadow and turned the current into the railway circuit again.
  As he did so the singed body loosened its grip upon the machine and fell
  forward on its face. The core of the dynamo roared out loud and clear, and
  the armature beat the air.</p>

  <p>So ended prematurely the Worship of the Dynamo Deity, perhaps the most
  short-lived of all religions. Yet withal it could at least boast a Martyrdom
  and a Human Sacrifice.</p>

     name="story13">AEPYORNIS ISLAND</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, December 27, 1894</h3>

  <p>The man with the scarred face leant over the table and looked at my
  bundle.</p>

  <p>"Orchids?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"A few," I said.</p>

  <p>"Cypripediums," he said.</p>

  <p>"Chiefly," said I.</p>

  <p>"Anything new? I thought not. <i>I</i> did these islands twenty-five
  &mdash;twenty-seven years ago. If you find anything new here&mdash;well it's
  brand new. I didn't leave much."</p>

  <p>"I'm not a collector," said I.</p>

  <p>"I was young then," he went on. "Lord! how I used to fly round." He seemed
  to take my measure. "I was in the East Indies two years, and in Brazil seven.
  Then I went to Madagascar."</p>

  <p>"I know a few explorers by name," I Said, anticipating a yarn. "Whom did
  you collect for?"</p>

  <p>"Dawsons. I wonder if you've heard the name of Butcher ever?"</p>

  <p>"Butcher&mdash;Butcher?" The name seemed vaguely present in my memory;
  then I recalled <i>Butcher</i> v. <i>Dawson</i>. "Why!" said I, "you are the
  man who sued them for four years' salary&mdash;got cast away on a desert
  island ..."</p>

  <p>"Your servant," said the man with the scar, bowing. "Funny case, wasn't
  it? Here was me, making a little fortune on that island, doing nothing for it
  neither, and them quite unable to give me notice. It often used to amuse me
  thinking over it while I was there. I did calculations of it&mdash;big
  &mdash;all over the blessed atoll in ornamental figuring."</p>

  <p>"How did it happen?" said I. "I don't rightly remember the case."</p>

  <p>"Well... You've heard of the Aepyornis?"</p>

  <p>"Rather. Andrews was telling me of a new species he was working on only a
  month or so ago. Just before I sailed. They've got a thigh bone, it seems,
  nearly a yard long. Monster the thing must have been!"</p>

  <p>"I believe you," said the man with the scar. "It <i>was</i> a monster.
  Sinbad's roc was just a legend of 'em. But when did they find these
  bones?"</p>

  <p>"Three or four years ago&mdash;'91, I fancy. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Why? Because <i>I</i> found 'em&mdash;Lord!&mdash;it's nearly twenty
  years ago. If Dawsons hadn't been silly about that salary they might have
  made a perfect ring in 'em... <i>I</i> couldn't help the infernal boat going
  adrift."</p>

  <p>He paused, "I suppose it's the same place. A kind of swamp about ninety
  miles north of Antananarivo. Do you happen to know? You have to go to it
  along the coast by boats. You don't happen to remember, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"I don't. I fancy Andrews said something about a swamp."</p>

  <p>"It must be the same. It's on the east coast. And somehow there's
  something in the water that keeps things from decaying. Like creosote it
  smells. It reminded me of Trinidad. Did they get any more eggs? Some of the
  eggs I found were a foot-and-a-half long. The swamp goes circling round, you
  know, and cuts off this bit. It's mostly salt, too. Well... What a time I had
  of it! I found the things quite by accident. We went for eggs, me and two
  native chaps, in one of those rum canoes all tied together, and found the
  bones at the same time. We had a tent and provisions for four days, and we
  pitched on one of the firmer places. To think of it brings that odd tarry
  smell back even now. It's funny work. You go probing into the mud with iron
  rods, you know. Usually the egg gets smashed. I wonder how long it is since
  these Aepyornises really lived. The missionaries say the natives have legends
  about when they were alive, but I never heard any such stories myself.[A] But
  certainly those eggs we got were as fresh as if they had been new laid.
  Fresh! Carrying them down to the boat one of my nigger chaps dropped one on a
  rock and it smashed. How I lammed into the beggar! But sweet it was, as if it
  was new laid, not even smelly, and its mother dead these four hundred years,
  perhaps. Said a centipede had bit him. However, I'm getting off the straight
  with the story. It had taken us all day to dig into the slush and get these
  eggs out unbroken, and we were all covered with beastly black mud, and
  naturally I was cross. So far as I knew they were the only eggs that have
  ever been got out not even cracked. I went afterwards to see the ones they
  have at the Natural History Museum in London; all of them were cracked and
  just stuck together like a mosaic, and bits missing. Mine were perfect, and I
  meant to blow them when I got back. Naturally I was annoyed at the silly
  duffer dropping three hours' work just on account of a centipede. I hit him
  about rather."</p>

  Aepyornis, with the doubtful exception of MacAndrew, who visited Madagascar
  in 1745.&mdash;H.G.W.]</p>

  <p>The man with the scar took out a clay pipe. I placed my pouch before him.
  He filled up absent-mindedly.</p>

  <p>"How about the others? Did you get those home? I don't
  remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's the queer part of the story. I had three others. Perfectly fresh
  eggs. Well, we put 'em in the boat, and then I went up to the tent to make
  some coffee, leaving my two heathens down by the beach&mdash;the one fooling
  about with his sting and the other helping him. It never occurred to me that
  the beggars would take advantage of the peculiar position I was in to pick a
  quarrel. But I suppose the centipede poison and the kicking I had given him
  had upset the one&mdash;he was always a cantankerous sort&mdash;and he
  persuaded the other.</p>

  <p>"I remember I was sitting and smoking and boiling up the water over a
  spirit-lamp business I used to take on these expeditions. Incidentally I was
  admiring the swamp under the sunset. All black and blood-red it was, in
  streaks&mdash;a beautiful sight. And up beyond the land rose grey and hazy to
  the hills, and the sky behind them red, like a furnace mouth. And fifty yards
  behind the back of me was these blessed heathen&mdash;quite regardless of the
  tranquil air of things&mdash;plotting to cut off with the boat and leave me
  all alone with three days' provisions and a canvas tent, and nothing to drink
  whatsoever, beyond a little keg of water. I heard a kind of yelp behind me,
  and there they were in this canoe affair&mdash;it wasn't properly a
  boat&mdash;and, perhaps, twenty yards from land. I realised what was up in a
  moment. My gun was in the tent, and, besides, I had no bullets&mdash;only
  duck shot. They knew that. But I had a little revolver in my pocket, and I
  pulled that out as I ran down to the beach.</p>

  <p>"'Come back!' says I, flourishing it.</p>

  <p>"They jabbered something at me, and the man that broke the egg jeered. I
  aimed at the other&mdash;because he was unwounded and had the paddle, and I
  missed. They laughed. However, I wasn't beat. I knew I had to keep cool, and
  I tried him again and made him jump with the whang of it. He didn't laugh
  that time. The third time I got his head, and over he went, and the paddle
  with him. It was a precious lucky shot for a revolver. I reckon it was fifty
  yards. He went right under. I don't know if he was shot, or simply stunned
  and drowned. Then I began to shout to the other chap to come back, but he
  huddled up in the canoe and refused to answer. So I fired out my revolver at
  him and never got near him.</p>

  <p>"I felt a precious fool, I can tell you. There I was on this rotten, black
  beach, flat swamp all behind me, and the flat sea, cold after the sunset, and
  just this black canoe drifting steadily out to sea. I tell you I damned
  Dawsons and Jamrachs and Museums and all the rest of it just to rights. I
  bawled to this nigger to come back, until my voice went up into a scream.</p>

  <p>"There was nothing for it but to swim after him and take my luck with the
  sharks. So I opened my clasp-knife and put it in my mouth, and took off my
  clothes and waded in. As soon as I was in the water I lost sight of the
  canoe, but I aimed, as I judged, to head it off. I hoped the man in it was
  too bad to navigate it, and that it would keep on drifting in the same
  direction. Presently it came up over the horizon again to the south-westward
  about. The afterglow of sunset was well over now and the dim of night
  creeping up. The stars were coming through the blue. I swum like a champion,
  though my legs and arms were soon aching.</p>

  <p>"However, I came up to him by the time the stars were fairly out. As it
  got darker I began to see all manner of glowing things in the
  water&mdash;phosphorescence, you know. At times it made me giddy. I hardly
  knew which was stars and which was phosphorescence, and whether I was
  swimming on my head or my heels. The canoe was as black as sin, and the
  ripple under the bows like liquid fire. I was naturally chary of clambering
  up into it. I was anxious to see what he was up to first. He seemed to be
  lying cuddled up in a lump in the bows, and the stern was all out of water.
  The thing kept turning round slowly as it drifted&mdash;kind of waltzing,
  don't you know. I went to the stern, and pulled it down, expecting him to
  wake up. Then I began to clamber in with my knife in my hand, and ready for a
  rush. But he never stirred. So there I sat in the stern of the little canoe,
  drifting away over the calm phosphorescent sea, and with all the host of the
  stars above me, waiting for something to happen.</p>

  <p>"After a long time I called him by name, but he never answered. I was too
  tired to take any risks by going along to him. So we sat there. I fancy I
  dozed once or twice. When the dawn came I saw he was as dead as a doornail
  and all puffed up and purple. My three eggs and the bones were lying in the
  middle of the canoe, and the keg of water and some coffee and biscuits
  wrapped in a Cape <i>Argus</i> by his feet, and a tin of methylated spirit
  underneath him. There was no paddle, nor, in fact, anything except the
  spirit-tin that one could use as one, so I settled to drift until I was
  picked up. I held an inquest on him, brought in a verdict against some snake,
  scorpion, or centipede unknown, and sent him overboard.</p>

  <p>"After that I had a drink of water and a few biscuits, and took a look
  round. I suppose a man low down as I was don't see very far; leastways,
  Madagascar was clean out of sight, and any trace of land at all. I saw a sail
  going south-westward&mdash;looked like a schooner, but her hull never came
  up. Presently the sun got high in the sky and began to beat down upon me.
  Lord! It pretty near made my brains boil. I tried dipping my head in the sea,
  but after a while my eye fell on the Cape <i>Argus</i>, and I lay down flat
  in the canoe and spread this over me. Wonderful things these newspapers! I
  never read one through thoroughly before, but it's odd what you get up to
  when you're alone, as I was. I suppose I read that blessed old Cape
  <i>Argus</i> twenty times. The pitch in the canoe simply reeked with the heat
  and rose up into big blisters.</p>

  <p>"I drifted ten days," said the man with the scar. "It's a little thing in
  the telling, isn't it? Every day was like the last. Except in the morning and
  the evening I never kept a look-out even&mdash;the blaze was so infernal. I
  didn't see a sail after the first three days, and those I saw took no notice
  of me. About the sixth night a ship went by scarcely half a mile away from
  me, with all its lights ablaze and its ports open, looking like a big
  firefly. There was music aboard. I stood up and shouted and screamed at it.
  The second day I broached one of the Aepyornis eggs, scraped the shell away
  at the end bit by bit, and tried it, and I was glad to find it was good
  enough to eat. A bit flavoury&mdash;not bad, I mean&mdash;but with something
  of the taste of a duck's egg. There was a kind of circular patch, about six
  inches across, on one side of the yolk, and with streaks of blood and a white
  mark like a ladder in it that I thought queer, but I did not understand what
  this meant at the time, and I wasn't inclined to be particular. The egg
  lasted me three days, with biscuits and a drink of water. I chewed coffee
  berries too&mdash;invigorating stuff. The second egg I opened about the
  eighth day, and it scared me."</p>

  <p>The man with the scar paused. "Yes," he said, "developing."</p>

  <p>"I dare say you find it hard to believe. <i>I</i> did, with the thing
  before me. There the egg had been, sunk in that cold black mud, perhaps three
  hundred years. But there was no mistaking it. There was the&mdash;what is it?
  &mdash;embryo, with its big head and curved back, and its heart beating under
  its throat, and the yolk shrivelled up and great membranes spreading inside
  of the shell and all over the yolk. Here was I hatching out the eggs of the
  biggest of all extinct birds, in a little canoe in the midst of the Indian
  Ocean. If old Dawson had known that! It was worth four years' salary. What do
  <i>you</i> think?</p>

  <p>"However, I had to eat that precious thing up, every bit of it, before I
  sighted the reef, and some of the mouthfuls were beastly unpleasant. I left
  the third one alone. I held it up to the light, but the shell was too thick
  for me to get any notion of what might be happening inside; and though I
  fancied I heard blood pulsing, it might have been the rustle in my own ears,
  like what you listen to in a seashell.</p>

  <p>"Then came the atoll. Came out of the sunrise, as it were, suddenly, close
  up to me. I drifted straight towards it until I was about half a mile from
  shore, not more, and then the current took a turn, and I had to paddle as
  hard as I could with my hands and bits of the Aepyornis shell to make the
  place. However, I got there. It was just a common atoll about four miles
  round, with a few trees growing and a spring in one place, and the lagoon
  full of parrot-fish. I took the egg ashore and put it in a good place well
  above the tide lines and in the sun, to give it all the chance I could, and
  pulled the canoe up safe, and loafed about prospecting. It's rum how dull an
  atoll is. As soon as I had found a spring all the interest seemed to vanish.
  When I was a kid I thought nothing could be finer or more adventurous than
  the Robinson Crusoe business, but that place was as monotonous as a book of
  sermons. I went round finding eatable things and generally thinking; but I
  tell you I was bored to death before the first day was out. It shows my
  luck&mdash;the very day I landed the weather changed. A thunderstorm went by
  to the north and flicked its wing over the island, and in the night there
  came a drencher and a howling wind slap over us. It wouldn't have taken much,
  you know, to upset that canoe.</p>

  <p>"I was sleeping under the canoe, and the egg was luckily among the sand
  higher up the beach, and the first thing I remember was a sound like a
  hundred pebbles hitting the boat at once, and a rush of water over my body.
  I'd been dreaming of Antananarivo, and I sat up and holloaed to Intoshi to
  ask her what the devil was up, and clawed out at the chair where the matches
  used to be. Then I remembered where I was. There were phosphorescent waves
  rolling up as if they meant to eat me, and all the rest of the night as black
  as pitch. The air was simply yelling. The clouds seemed down on your head
  almost, and the rain fell as if heaven was sinking and they were baling out
  the waters above the firmament. One great roller came writhing at me, like a
  fiery serpent, and I bolted. Then I thought of the canoe, and ran down to it
  as the water went hissing back again; but the thing had gone. I wondered
  about the egg then, and felt my way to it. It was all right and well out of
  reach of the maddest waves, so I sat down beside it and cuddled it for
  company. Lord! what a night that was!</p>

  <p>"The storm was over before the morning. There wasn't a rag of cloud left
  in the sky when the dawn came, and all along the beach there were bits of
  plank scattered&mdash;which was the disarticulated skeleton, so to speak, of
  my canoe. However, that gave me something to do, for, taking advantage of two
  of the trees being together, I rigged up a kind of storm-shelter with these
  vestiges. And that day the egg hatched.</p>

  <p>"Hatched, sir, when my head was pillowed on it and I was asleep. I heard a
  whack and felt a jar and sat up, and there was the end of the egg pecked out
  and a rum little brown head looking out at me. 'Lord!' I said, 'you're
  welcome'; and with a little difficulty he came out.</p>

  <p>"He was a nice friendly little chap, at first, about the size of a small
  hen&mdash;very much like most other young birds, only bigger. His plumage was
  a dirty brown to begin with, with a sort of grey scab that fell off it very
  soon, and scarcely feathers&mdash;a kind of downy hair. I can hardly express
  how pleased I was to see him. I tell you, Robinson Crusoe don't make near
  enough of his loneliness. But here was interesting company. He looked at me
  and winked his eye from the front backwards, like a hen, and gave a chirp and
  began to peck about at once, as though being hatched three hundred years too
  late was just nothing. 'Glad to see you, Man Friday!' says I, for I had
  naturally settled he was to be called Man Friday if ever he was hatched, as
  soon as ever I found the egg in the canoe had developed. I was a bit anxious
  about his feed, so I gave him a lump of raw parrot-fish at once. He took it,
  and opened his beak for more. I was glad of that, for, under the
  circumstances, if he'd been at all fanciful, I should have had to eat him
  after all. You'd be surprised what an interesting bird that Aepyornis chick
  was. He followed me about from the very beginning. He used to stand by me and
  watch while I fished in the lagoon, and go shares in anything I caught. And
  he was sensible, too. There were nasty green warty things, like pickled
  gherkins, used to lie about on the beach, and he tried one of these and it
  upset him. He never even looked at any of them again.</p>

  <p>"And he grew. You could almost see him grow. And as I was never much of a
  society man his quiet, friendly ways suited me to a T. For nearly two years
  we were as happy as we could be on that island. I had no business worries,
  for I knew my salary was mounting up at Dawsons'. We would see a sail now and
  then, but nothing ever came near us. I amused myself, too, by decorating the
  island with designs worked in sea-urchins and fancy shells of various kinds.
  I put "AEPYORNIS ISLAND" all round the place very nearly, in big letters,
  like what you see done with coloured stones at railway stations in the old
  country, and mathematical calculations and drawings of various sorts. And I
  used to lie watching the blessed bird stalking round and growing, growing;
  and think how I could make a living out of him by showing him about if I ever
  got taken off. After his first moult he began to get handsome, with a crest
  and a blue wattle, and a lot of green feathers at the behind of him. And then
  I used to puzzle whether Dawsons had any right to claim him or not. Stormy
  weather and in the rainy season we lay snug under the shelter I had made out
  of the old canoe, and I used to tell him lies about my friends at home. And
  after a storm we would go round the island together to see if there was any
  drift. It was a kind of idyll, you might say. If only I had had some tobacco
  it would have been simply just like Heaven.</p>

  <p>"It was about the end of the second year our little paradise went wrong.
  Friday was then about fourteen feet high to the bill of him, with a big,
  broad head like the end of a pickaxe, and two huge brown eyes with yellow
  rims, set together like a man's&mdash;not out of sight of each other like a
  hen's. His plumage was fine&mdash;none of the half-mourning style of your
  ostrich&mdash;more like a cassowary as far as colour and texture go. And then
  it was he began to cock his comb at me and give himself airs, and show signs
  of a nasty temper...</p>

  <p>"At last came a time when my fishing had been rather unlucky, and he began
  to hang about me in a queer, meditative way. I thought he might have been
  eating sea-cucumbers or something, but it was really just discontent on his
  part. I was hungry too, and when at last I landed a fish I wanted it for
  myself. Tempers were short that morning on both sides. He pecked at it and
  grabbed it, and I gave him a whack on the head to make him leave go. And at
  that he went for me. Lord!...</p>

  <p>"He gave me this in the face." The man indicated his scar. "Then he kicked
  me. It was like a cart-horse. I got up, and seeing he hadn't finished, I
  started off full tilt with my arms doubled up over my face. But he ran on
  those gawky legs of his faster than a racehorse, and kept landing out at me
  with sledge hammer kicks, and bringing his pickaxe down on the back of my
  head. I made for the lagoon, and went in up to my neck. He stopped at the
  water, for he hated getting his feet wet, and began to make a shindy,
  something like a peacock's, only hoarser. He started strutting up and down
  the beach. I'll admit I felt small to see this blessed fossil lording it
  there. And my head and face were all bleeding, and&mdash;well, my body just
  one jelly of bruises.</p>

  <p>"I decided to swim across the lagoon and leave him alone for a bit, until
  the affair blew over. I shinned up the tallest palm-tree, and sat there
  thinking of it all. I don't suppose I ever felt so hurt by anything before or
  since. It was the brutal ingratitude of the creature. I'd been more than a
  brother to him. I'd hatched him, educated him. A great gawky, out-of-date
  bird! And me a human being&mdash;heir of the ages and all that.</p>

  <p>"I thought after a time he'd begin to see things in that light himself,
  and feel a little sorry for his behaviour. I thought if I was to catch some
  nice little bits of fish, perhaps, and go to him presently in a casual kind
  of way, and offer them to him, he might do the sensible thing. It took me
  some time to learn how unforgiving and cantankerous an extinct bird can be.
  Malice!</p>

  <p>"I won't tell you all the little devices I tried to get that bird round
  again. I simply can't. It makes my cheek burn with shame even now to think of
  the snubs and buffets I had from this infernal curiosity. I tried violence. I
  chucked lumps of coral at him from a safe distance, but he only swallowed
  them. I shied my open knife at him and almost lost it, though it was too big
  for him to swallow. I tried starving him out and struck fishing, but he took
  to picking along the beach at low water after worms, and rubbed along on
  that. Half my time I spent up to my neck in the lagoon, and the rest up the
  palm-trees. One of them was scarcely high enough, and when he caught me up it
  he had a regular Bank Holiday with the calves of my legs. It got unbearable.
  I don't know if you have ever tried sleeping up a palm-tree. It gave me the
  most horrible nightmares. Think of the shame of it, too! Here was this
  extinct animal mooning about my island like a sulky duke, and me not allowed
  to rest the sole of my foot on the place. I used to cry with weariness and
  vexation. I told him straight that I didn't mean to be chased about a desert
  island by any damned anachronisms. I told him to go and peck a navigator of
  his own age. But he only snapped his beak at me. Great ugly bird&mdash;all
  legs and neck!</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't like to say how long that went on altogether. I'd have killed
  him sooner if I'd known how. However, I hit on a way of settling him at last.
  It is a South American dodge. I joined all my fishing-lines together with
  stems of seaweed and things and made a stoutish string, perhaps twelve yards
  in length or more, and I fastened two lumps of coral rock to the ends of
  this. It took me some time to do, because every now and then I had to go into
  the lagoon or up a tree as the fancy took me. This I whirled rapidly round my
  head, and then let it go at him. The first time I missed, but the next time
  the string caught his legs beautifully, and wrapped round them again and
  again. Over he went. I threw it standing waist-deep in the lagoon, and as
  soon as he went down I was out of the water and sawing at his neck with my
  knife...</p>

  <p>"I don't like to think of that even now. I felt like a murderer while I
  did it, though my anger was hot against him. When I stood over him and saw
  him bleeding on the white sand, and his beautiful great legs and neck
  writhing in his last agony...Pah!</p>

  <p>"With that tragedy loneliness came upon me like a curse. Good Lord! you
  can't imagine how I missed that bird. I sat by his corpse and sorrowed over
  him, and shivered as I looked round the desolate, silent reef. I thought of
  what a jolly little bird he had been when he was hatched, and of a thousand
  pleasant tricks he had played before he went wrong. I thought if I'd only
  wounded him I might have nursed him round into a better understanding. If I'd
  had any means of digging into the coral rock I'd have buried him. I felt
  exactly as if he was human. As it was, I couldn't think of eating him, so I
  put him in the lagoon, and the little fishes picked him clean. I didn't even
  save the feathers. Then one day a chap cruising about in a yacht had a fancy
  to see if my atoll still existed.</p>

  <p>"He didn't come a moment too soon, for I was about sick enough of the
  desolation of it, and only hesitating whether I should walk out into the sea
  and finish up the business that way, or fall back on the green things...</p>

  <p>"I sold the bones to a man named Winslow&mdash;a dealer near the British
  Museum, and he says he sold them to old Havers. It seems Havers didn't
  understand they were extra large, and it was only after his death they
  attracted attention. They called 'em Aepyornis&mdash;what was it?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Aepyornis vastus</i>," said I. "It's funny, the very thing was
  mentioned to me by a friend of mine. When they found an Aepyornis, with a
  thigh a yard long, they thought they had reached the top of the scale, and
  called him <i>Aepyornis maximus</i>. Then someone turned up another thighbone
  four feet six or more, and that they called <i>Aepyornis Titan</i>. Then your
  <i>vastus</i> was found after old Havers died, in his collection, and then a
  <i>vastissimus</i> turned up."</p>

  <p>"Winslow was telling me as much," said the man with the scar. "If they get
  any more Aepyornises, he reckons some scientific swell will go and burst a
  bloodvessel. But it was a queer thing to happen to a man; wasn't
  it&mdash;altogether?"</p>

     name="story14">A DEAL IN OSTRICHES</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, December 20, 1894</h3>

  <p>"Talking of the prices of birds, I've seen an ostrich that cost three
  hundred pounds," said the Taxidermist, recalling his youth of travel. "Three
  hundred pounds!"</p>

  <p>He looked at me over his spectacles. "I've seen another that was refused
  at four."</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "it wasn't any fancy points. They was just plain ostriches.
  A little off colour, too&mdash;owing to dietary. And there wasn't any
  particular restriction of the demand either. You'd have thought five
  ostriches would have ruled cheap on an East Indiaman. But the point was, one
  of 'em had swallowed a diamond.</p>

  <p>"The chap it got it off was Sir Mohini Padishah, a tremendous swell, a
  Piccadilly swell you might say up to the neck of him, and then an ugly black
  head and a whopping turban, with this diamond in it. The blessed bird pecked
  suddenly and had it, and when the chap made a fuss it realised it had done
  wrong, I suppose, and went and mixed itself with the others to preserve its
  <i>incog</i>. It all happened in a minute. I was among the first to arrive,
  and there was this heathen going over his gods, and two sailors and the man
  who had charge of the birds laughing fit to split. It was a rummy way of
  losing a jewel, come to think of it. The man in charge hadn't been about just
  at the moment, so that he didn't know which bird it was. Clean lost, you see.
  I didn't feel half sorry, to tell you the truth. The beggar had been
  swaggering over his blessed diamond ever since he came aboard.</p>

  <p>"A thing like that goes from stem to stern of a ship in no time. Every one
  was talking about it. Padishah went below to hide his feelings. At dinner
  &mdash;he pigged at a table by himself, him and two other Hindoos&mdash;the
  captain kind of jeered at him about it, and he got very excited. He turned
  round and talked into my ear. He would not buy the birds; he would have his
  diamond. He demanded his rights as a British subject. His diamond must be
  found. He was firm upon that. He would appeal to the House of Lords. The man
  in charge of the birds was one of those wooden-headed chaps you can't get a
  new idea into anyhow. He refused any proposal to interfere with the birds by
  way of medicine. His instructions were to feed them so-and-so and treat them
  so-and-so, and it was as much as his place was worth not to feed them
  so-and-so and treat them so-and-so. Padishah had wanted a
  stomach-pump&mdash;though you can't do that to a bird, you know. This
  Padishah was full of bad law, like most of these blessed Bengalis, and talked
  of having a lien on the birds, and so forth. But an old boy, who said his son
  was a London barrister, argued that what a bird swallowed became <i>ipso
  facto</i> part of the bird, and that Padishah's only remedy lay in an action
  for damages, and even then it might be possible to show contributory
  negligence. He hadn't any right of way about an ostrich that didn't belong to
  him. That upset Padishah extremely, the more so as most of us expressed an
  opinion that that was the reasonable view. There wasn't any lawyer aboard to
  settle the matter, so we all talked pretty free. At last, after Aden, it
  appears that he came round to the general opinion, and went privately to the
  man in charge and made an offer for all five ostriches.</p>

  <p>"The next morning there was a fine shindy at breakfast. The man hadn't any
  authority to deal with the birds, and nothing on earth would induce him to
  sell; but it seems he told Padishah that a Eurasian named Potter had already
  made him an offer, and on that Padishah denounced Potter before us all. But I
  think the most of us thought it rather smart of Potter, and I know that when
  Potter said that he'd wired at Aden to London to buy the birds, and would
  have an answer at Suez, I cursed pretty richly at a lost opportunity.</p>

  <p>"At Suez, Padishah gave way to tears&mdash;actual wet tears&mdash;when
  Potter became the owner of the birds, and offered him two hundred and fifty
  right off for the five, being more than two hundred per cent. on what Potter
  had given. Potter said he'd be hanged if he parted with a feather of
  them&mdash;that he meant to kill them off one by one and find the diamond;
  but afterwards, thinking it over, he relented a little. He was a gambling
  hound, was this Potter, a little queer at cards, and this kind of
  prize-packet business must have suited him down to the ground. Anyhow, he
  offered, for a lark, to sell the birds separately to separate people by
  auction at a starting price of L80 for a bird. But one of them, he said, he
  meant to keep for luck.</p>

  <p>"You must understand this diamond was a valuable one&mdash;a little Jew
  chap, a diamond merchant, who was with us, had put it at three or four
  thousand when Padishah had shown it to him&mdash;and this idea of an ostrich
  gamble caught on. Now it happened that I'd been having a few talks on general
  subjects with the man who looked after these ostriches, and quite
  incidentally he'd said one of the birds was ailing, and he fancied it had
  indigestion. It had one feather in its tail almost all white, by which I knew
  it, and so when, next day, the auction started with it, I capped Padishah's
  eighty-five by ninety. I fancy I was a bit too sure and eager with my bid,
  and some of the others spotted the fact that I was in the know. And Padishah
  went for that particular bird like an irresponsible lunatic. At last the Jew
  diamond merchant got it for L175, and Padishah said L180 just after the
  hammer came down&mdash;so Potter declared. At any rate the Jew merchant
  secured it, and there and then he got a gun and shot it. Potter made a Hades
  of a fuss because he said it would injure the sale of the other three, and
  Padishah, of course, behaved like an idiot; but all of us were very much
  excited. I can tell you I was precious glad when that dissection was over,
  and no diamond had turned up&mdash;precious glad. I'd gone to one-forty on
  that particular bird myself.</p>

  <p>"The little Jew was like most Jews&mdash;he didn't make any great fuss
  over bad luck; but Potter declined to go on with the auction until it was
  understood that the goods could not be delivered until the sale was over. The
  little Jew wanted to argue that the case was exceptional, and as the
  discussion ran pretty even, the thing was postponed until the next morning.
  We had a lively dinner-table that evening, I can tell you, but in the end
  Potter got his way, since it would stand to reason he would be safer if he
  stuck to all the birds, and that we owed him some consideration for his
  sportsmanlike behaviour. And the old gentleman whose son was a lawyer said
  he'd been thinking the thing over and that it was very doubtful if, when a
  bird had been opened and the diamond recovered, it ought not to be handed
  back to the proper owner. I remember I suggested it came under the laws of
  treasure-trove&mdash;which was really the truth of the matter. There was a
  hot argument, and we settled it was certainly foolish to kill the bird on
  board the ship. Then the old gentleman, going at large through his legal
  talk, tried to make out the sale was a lottery and illegal, and appealed to
  the captain; but Potter said he sold the birds <i>as</i>ostriches. He didn't
  want to sell any diamonds, he said, and didn't offer that as an inducement.
  The three birds he put up, to the best of his knowledge and belief, did
  <i>not</i> contain a diamond. It was in the one he kept&mdash;so he
  hoped.</p>

  <p>"Prices ruled high next day all the same. The fact that now there were
  four chances instead of five of course caused a rise. The blessed birds
  averaged 227, and, oddly enough, this Padishah didn't secure one of
  'em&mdash;not one. He made too much shindy, and when he ought to have been
  bidding he was talking about liens, and, besides, Potter was a bit down on
  him. One fell to a quiet little officer chap, another to the little Jew, and
  the third was syndicated by the engineers. And then Potter seemed suddenly
  sorry for having sold them, and said he'd flung away a clear thousand pounds,
  and that very likely he'd draw a blank and that he always had been a fool,
  but when I went and had a bit of a talk to him, with the idea of getting him
  to hedge on his last chance, I found he'd already sold the bird he'd reserved
  to a political chap that was on board, a chap who'd been studying Indian
  morals and social questions in his vacation. That last was the three hundred
  pounds bird. Well, they landed three of the blessed creatures at
  Brindisi&mdash;though the old gentleman said it was a breach of the Customs
  regulations&mdash;and Potter and Padishah landed too. The Hindoo seemed half
  mad as he saw his blessed diamond going this way and that, so to speak. He
  kept on saying he'd get an injunction&mdash;he had injunction on the
  brain&mdash;and giving his name and address to the chaps who'd bought the
  birds, so that they'd know where to send the diamond. None of them wanted his
  name and address, and none of them would give their own. It was a fine row I
  can tell you&mdash;on the platform. They all went off by different trains. I
  came on to Southampton, and there I saw the last of the birds, as I came
  ashore; it was the one the engineers bought, and it was standing up near the
  bridge, in a kind of crate, and looking as leggy and silly a setting for a
  valuable diamond as ever you saw&mdash;if it <i>was</i> a setting for a
  valuable diamond.</p>

  <p>"<i>How did it end</i>? Oh! like that. Well&mdash;perhaps. Yes, there's
  one more thing that may throw light on it. A week or so after landing I was
  down Regent-street doing a bit of shopping, and who should I see arm-in-arm
  and having a purple time of it but Padishah and Potter. If you come to think
  of it&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Yes. <i>I've</i> thought that. Only, you see, there's no doubt the
  diamond was real. And Padishah was an eminent Hindoo. I've seen his name in
  the papers&mdash;often. But whether the bird swallowed the diamond certainly
  is another matter, as you say."</p>

     name="story15">THE FLYING MAN</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, January 4, 1895</h3>

  <p>The Ethnologist looked at the <i>bhimraj</i> feather thoughtfully. "They
  seemed loth to part with it," he said.</p>

  <p>"It is sacred to the Chiefs," said the lieutenant; "just as yellow silk,
  you know, is sacred to the Chinese Emperor."</p>

  <p>The Ethnologist did not answer. He hesitated. Then opening the topic
  abruptly, "What on earth is this cock-and-bull story they have of a flying
  man?"</p>

  <p>The lieutenant smiled faintly. "What did they tell you?"</p>

  <p>"I see," said the Ethnologist, "that you know of your fame."</p>

  <p>The lieutenant rolled himself a cigarette. "I don't mind hearing about it
  once more. How does it stand at present?"</p>

  <p>"It's so confoundedly childish," said the Ethnologist, becoming irritated.
  "How did you play it off upon them?"</p>

  <p>The lieutenant made no answer, but lounged back in his folding-chair,
  still smiling.</p>

  <p>"Here am I, come four hundred miles out of my way to get what is left of
  the folk-lore of these people, before they are utterly demoralised by
  missionaries and the military, and all I find are a lot of impossible legends
  about a sandy-haired scrub of an infantry lieutenant. How he is invulnerable
  &mdash;how he can jump over elephants&mdash;how he can fly. That's the
  toughest nut. One old gentleman described your wings, said they had black
  plumage and were not quite as long as a mule. Said he often saw you by
  moonlight hovering over the crests out towards the Shendu
  country.&mdash;Confound it, man!"</p>

  <p>The lieutenant laughed cheerfully. "Go on," he said. "Go on."</p>

  <p>The Ethnologist did. At last he wearied. "To trade so," he said, "on these
  unsophisticated children of the mountains. How could you bring yourself to do
  it, man?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said the lieutenant, "but truly the thing was forced upon me.
  I can assure you I was driven to it. And at the time I had not the faintest
  idea of how the Chin imagination would take it. Or curiosity. I can only
  plead it was an indiscretion and not malice that made me replace the
  folk-lore by a new legend. But as you seem aggrieved, I will try and explain
  the business to you.</p>

  <p>"It was in the time of the last Lushai expedition but one, and Walters
  thought these people you have been visiting were friendly. So, with an airy
  confidence in my capacity for taking care of myself, he sent me up the gorge
  &mdash;fourteen miles of it&mdash;with three of the Derbyshire men and half a
  dozen Sepoys, two mules, and his blessing, to see what popular feeling was
  like at that village you visited. A force of ten&mdash;not counting the mules
  &mdash;fourteen miles, and during a war! You saw the road?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Road</i>!" said the Ethnologist.</p>

  <p>"It's better now than it was. When we went up we had to wade in the river
  for a mile where the valley narrows, with a smart stream frothing round our
  knees and the stones as slippery as ice. There it was I dropped my rifle.
  Afterwards the Sappers blasted the cliff with dynamite and made the
  convenient way you came by. Then below, where those very high cliffs come, we
  had to keep on dodging across the river&mdash;I should say we crossed it a
  dozen times in a couple of miles.</p>

  <p>"We got in sight of the place early the next morning. You know how it
  lies, on a spur halfway between the big hills, and as we began to appreciate
  how wickedly quiet the village lay under the sunlight, we came to a stop to
  consider.</p>

  <p>"At that they fired a lump of filed brass idol at us, just by way of a
  welcome. It came twanging down the slope to the right of us where the
  boulders are, missed my shoulder by an inch or so, and plugged the mule that
  carried all the provisions and utensils. I never heard such a death-rattle
  before or since. And at that we became aware of a number of gentlemen
  carrying matchlocks, and dressed in things like plaid dusters, dodging about
  along the neck between the village and the crest to the east.</p>

  <p>"'Right about face,' I said. 'Not too close together.'</p>

  <p>"And with that encouragement my expedition of ten men came round and set
  off at a smart trot down the valley again hitherward. We did not wait to save
  anything our dead had carried, but we kept the second mule with us&mdash;he
  carried my tent and some other rubbish&mdash;out of a feeling of
  friendship.</p>

  <p>"So ended the battle&mdash;ingloriously. Glancing back, I saw the valley
  dotted with the victors, shouting and firing at us. But no one was hit. These
  Chins and their guns are very little good except at a sitting shot. They will
  sit and finick over a boulder for hours taking aim, and when they fire
  running it is chiefly for stage effect. Hooker, one of the Derbyshire men,
  fancied himself rather with the rifle, and stopped behind for half a minute
  to try his luck as we turned the bend. But he got nothing.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a Xenophon to spin much of a yarn about my retreating army. We
  had to pull the enemy up twice in the next two miles when he became a bit
  pressing, by exchanging shots with him, but it was a fairly monotonous affair
  &mdash;hard breathing chiefly&mdash;until we got near the place where the
  hills run in towards the river and pinch the valley into a gorge. And there
  we very luckily caught a glimpse of half a dozen round black heads coming
  slanting-ways over the hill to the left of us&mdash;the east that
  is&mdash;and almost parallel with us.</p>

  <p>"At that I called a halt. 'Look here,' says I to Hooker and the other
  Englishmen; 'what are we to do now?' and I pointed to the heads.</p>

  <p>"'Headed orf, or I'm a nigger,' said one of the men.</p>

  <p>"'We shall be,' said another. 'You know the Chin way, George?'</p>

  <p>"'They can pot every one of us at fifty yards,' says Hooker, 'in the place
  where the river is narrow. It's just suicide to go on down.'</p>

  <p>"I looked at the hill to the right of us. It grew steeper lower down the
  valley, but it still seemed climbable. And all the Chins we had seen hitherto
  had been on the other side of the stream.</p>

  <p>"'It's that or stopping,' says one of the Sepoys.</p>

  <p>"So we started slanting up the hill. There was something faintly
  suggestive of a road running obliquely up the face of it, and that we
  followed. Some Chins presently came into view up the valley, and I heard some
  shots. Then I saw one of the Sepoys was sitting down about thirty yards below
  us. He had simply sat down without a word, apparently not wishing to give
  trouble. At that I called a halt again; I told Hooker to try another shot,
  and went back and found the man was hit in the leg. I took him up, carried
  him along to put him on the mule&mdash;already pretty well laden with the
  tent and other things which we had no time to take off. When I got up to the
  rest with him, Hooker had his empty Martini in his hand, and was grinning and
  pointing to a motionless black spot up the valley. All the rest of the Chins
  were behind boulders or back round the bend. 'Five hundred yards,' says
  Hooker, 'if an inch. And I'll swear I hit him in the head.'</p>

  <p>"I told him to go and do it again, and with that we went on again.</p>

  <p>"Now the hillside kept getting steeper as we pushed on, and the road we
  were following more and more of a shelf. At last it was mere cliff above and
  below us. 'It's the best road I have seen yet in Chin Lushai land,' said I to
  encourage the men, though I had a fear of what was coming.</p>

  <p>"And in a few minutes the way bent round a corner of the cliff. Then,
  finis! the ledge came to an end.</p>

  <p>"As soon as he grasped the position one of the Derbyshire men fell a-
  swearing at the trap we had fallen into. The Sepoys halted quietly. Hooker
  grunted and reloaded, and went back to the bend.</p>

  <p>"Then two of the Sepoy chaps helped their comrade down and began to unload
  the mule.</p>

  <p>"Now, when I came to look about me, I began to think we had not been so
  very unfortunate after all. We were on a shelf perhaps ten yards across it at
  widest. Above it the cliff projected so that we could not be shot down upon,
  and below was an almost sheer precipice of perhaps two or three hundred feet.
  Lying down we were invisible to anyone across the ravine. The only approach
  was along the ledge, and on that one man was as good as a host. We were in a
  natural stronghold, with only one disadvantage, our sole provision against
  hunger and thirst was one live mule. Still we were at most eight or nine
  miles from the main expedition, and no doubt, after a day or so, they would
  send up after us if we did not return.</p>

  <p>"After a day or so ..."</p>

  <p>The lieutenant paused. "Ever been thirsty, Graham?"</p>

  <p>"Not that kind," said the Ethnologist.</p>

  <p>"H'm. We had the whole of that day, the night, and the next day of it, and
  only a trifle of dew we wrung out of our clothes and the tent. And below us
  was the river going giggle, giggle, round a rock in mid stream. I never knew
  such a barrenness of incident, or such a quantity of sensation. The sun might
  have had Joshua's command still upon it for all the motion one could see; and
  it blazed like a near furnace. Towards the evening of the first day one of
  the Derbyshire men said something&mdash;nobody heard what&mdash;and went off
  round the bend of the cliff. We heard shots, and when Hooker looked round the
  corner he was gone. And in the morning the Sepoy whose leg was shot was in
  delirium, and jumped or fell over the cliff. Then we took the mule and shot
  it, and that must needs go over the cliff too in its last struggles, leaving
  eight of us.</p>

  <p>"We could see the body of the Sepoy down below, with the head in the
  water. He was lying face downwards, and so far as I could make out was
  scarcely smashed at all. Badly as the Chins might covet his head, they had
  the sense to leave it alone until the darkness came.</p>

  <p>"At first we talked of all the chances there were of the main body hearing
  the firing, and reckoned whether they would begin to miss us, and all that
  kind of thing, but we dried up as the evening came on. The Sepoys played
  games with bits of stone among themselves, and afterwards told stories. The
  night was rather chilly. The second day nobody spoke. Our lips were black and
  our throats afire, and we lay about on the ledge and glared at one another.
  Perhaps it's as well we kept our thoughts to ourselves. One of the British
  soldiers began writing some blasphemous rot on the rock with a bit of
  pipeclay, about his last dying will, until I stopped it. As I looked over the
  edge down into the valley and saw the river rippling I was nearly tempted to
  go after the Sepoy. It seemed a pleasant and desirable thing to go rushing
  down through the air with something to drink&mdash;or no more thirst at any
  rate&mdash;at the bottom. I remembered in time, though, that I was the
  officer in command, and my duty to set a good example, and that kept me from
  any such foolishness.</p>

  <p>"Yet, thinking of that, put an idea into my head. I got up and looked at
  the tent and tent ropes, and wondered why I had not thought of it before.
  Then I came and peered over the cliff again. This time the height seemed
  greater and the pose of the Sepoy rather more painful. But it was that or
  nothing. And to cut it short, I parachuted.</p>

  <p>"I got a big circle of canvas out of the tent, about three times the size
  of that table-cover, and plugged the hole in the centre, and I tied eight
  ropes round it to meet in the middle and make a parachute. The other chaps
  lay about and watched me as though they thought it was a new kind of
  delirium. Then I explained my notion to the two British soldiers and how I
  meant to do it, and as soon as the short dusk had darkened into night, I
  risked it. They held the thing high up, and I took a run the whole length of
  the ledge. The thing filled with air like a sail, but at the edge I will
  confess I funked and pulled up.</p>

  <p>"As soon as I stopped I was ashamed of myself&mdash;as well I might be in
  front of privates&mdash;and went back and started again. Off I jumped this
  time&mdash;with a kind of sob, I remember&mdash;clean into the air, with the
  big white sail bellying out above me.</p>

  <p>"I must have thought at a frightful pace. It seemed a long time before I
  was sure that the thing meant to keep steady. At first it heeled sideways.
  Then I noticed the face of the rock which seemed to be streaming up past me,
  and me motionless. Then I looked down and saw in the darkness the river and
  the dead Sepoy rushing up towards me. But in the indistinct light I also saw
  three Chins, seemingly aghast at the sight of me, and that the Sepoy was
  decapitated. At that I wanted to go back again.</p>

  <p>"Then my boot was in the mouth of one, and in a moment he and I were in a
  heap with the canvas fluttering down on the top of us. I fancy I dashed out
  his brains with my foot. I expected nothing more than to be brained myself by
  the other two, but the poor heathen had never heard of Baldwin, and
  incontinently bolted.</p>

  <p>"I struggled out of the tangle of dead Chin and canvas, and looked round.
  About ten paces off lay the head of the Sepoy staring in the moonlight. Then
  I saw the water and went and drank. There wasn't a sound in the world but the
  footsteps of the departing Chins, a faint shout from above, and the gluck of
  the water. So soon as I had drunk my full I started off down the river.</p>

  <p>"That about ends the explanation of the flying man story. I never met a
  soul the whole eight miles of the way. I got to Walters' camp by ten o'clock,
  and a born idiot of a sentinel had the cheek to fire at me as I came trotting
  out of the darkness. So soon as I had hammered my story into Winter's thick
  skull, about fifty men started up the valley to clear the Chins out and get
  our men down. But for my own part I had too good a thirst to provoke it by
  going with them.</p>

  <p>"You have heard what kind of a yarn the Chins made of it. Wings as long as
  a mule, eh?&mdash;And black feathers! The gay lieutenant bird! Well,
  well."</p>

  <p>The lieutenant meditated cheerfully for a moment. Then he added, "You
  would scarcely credit it, but when they got to the ridge at last, they found
  two more of the Sepoys had jumped over."</p>

  <p>"The rest were all right?" asked the Ethnologist.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the lieutenant; "the rest were all right, barring a certain
  thirst, you know."</p>

  <p>And at the memory he helped himself to soda and whisky again.</p>

     name="story16">THE TEMPTATION OF HARRINGAY</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>St. James's Gazette</i>, February 9, 1895</h3>

  <p>It is quite impossible to say whether this thing really happened. It
  depends entirely on the word of R.M. Harringay, who is an artist.</p>

  <p>Following his version of the affair, the narrative deposes that Harringay
  went into his studio about ten o'clock to see what he could make of the head
  that he had been working at the day before. The head in question was that of
  an Italian organ-grinder, and Harringay thought&mdash;but was not quite sure
  &mdash;that the title would be the "Vigil." So far he is frank, and his
  narrative bears the stamp of truth. He had seen the man expectant for
  pennies, and with a promptness that suggested genius, had had him in at
  once.</p>

  <p>"Kneel. Look up at that bracket," said Harringay. "As if you expected
  pennies."</p>

  <p>"Don't <i>grin</i>!" said Harringay. "I don't want to paint your gums.
  Look as though you were unhappy."</p>

  <p>Now, after a night's rest, the picture proved decidedly unsatisfactory.
  "It's good work," said Harringay. "That little bit in the neck...But."</p>

  <p>He walked about the studio and looked at the thing from this point and
  from that. Then he said a wicked word. In the original the word is given.</p>

  <p>"Painting," he says he said. "Just a painting of an organ-grinder&mdash;a
  mere portrait. If it was a live organ-grinder I wouldn't mind. But somehow I
  never make things alive. I wonder if my imagination is wrong." This, too, has
  a truthful air. His imagination <i>is</i> wrong.</p>

  <p>"That creative touch! To take canvas and pigment and make a man&mdash;as
  Adam was made of red ochre! But this thing! If you met it walking about the
  streets you would know it was only a studio production. The little boys would
  tell it to 'Garnome and git frimed.' Some little touch...Well&mdash;it won't
  do as it is."</p>

  <p>He went to the blinds and began to pull them down. They were made of blue
  holland with the rollers at the bottom of the window, so that you pull them
  down to get more light. He gathered his palette, brushes, and mahl stick from
  his table. Then he turned to the picture and put a speck of brown in the
  corner of the mouth; and shifted his attention thence to the pupil of the
  eye. Then he decided that the chin was a trifle too impassive for a
  vigil.</p>

  <p>Presently he put down his impedimenta, and lighting a pipe surveyed the
  progress of his work. "I'm hanged if the thing isn't sneering at me," said
  Harringay, and he still believes it sneered.</p>

  <p>The animation of the figure had certainly increased, but scarcely in the
  direction he wished. There was no mistake about the sneer. "Vigil of the
  Unbeliever," said Harringay. "Rather subtle and clever that! But the left
  eyebrow isn't cynical enough."</p>

  <p>He went and dabbed at the eyebrow, and added a little to the lobe of the
  ear to suggest materialism. Further consideration ensued. "Vigil's off, I'm
  afraid," said Harringay. "Why not Mephistopheles? But that's a bit <i>too</i>
  common. 'A Friend of the Doge,'&mdash;not so seedy. The armour won't do,
  though. Too Camelot. How about a scarlet robe and call him 'One of the Sacred
  College'? Humour in that, and an appreciation of Middle Italian History."</p>

  <p>"There's always Benvenuto Cellini," said Harringay; "with a clever
  suggestion of a gold cup in one corner. But that would scarcely suit the
  complexion."</p>

  <p>He describes himself as babbling in this way in order to keep down an
  unaccountably unpleasant sensation of fear. The thing was certainly acquiring
  anything but a pleasing expression. Yet it was as certainly becoming far more
  of a living thing than it had been&mdash;if a sinister one&mdash;far more
  alive than anything he had ever painted before. "Call it 'Portrait of a
  Gentleman,'" said Harringay;&mdash;"A Certain Gentleman."</p>

  <p>"Won't do," said Harringay, still keeping up his courage. "Kind of thing
  they call Bad Taste. That sneer will have to come out. That gone, and a
  little more fire in the eye&mdash;never noticed how warm his eye was
  before&mdash;and he might do for&mdash;? What price Passionate Pilgrim? But
  that devilish face won't do&mdash;<i>this</i> side of the Channel.</p>

  <p>"Some little inaccuracy does it," he said; "eyebrows probably too
  oblique,"&mdash;therewith pulling the blind lower to get a better light, and
  resuming palette and brushes.</p>

  <p>The face on the canvas seemed animated by a spirit of its own. Where the
  expression of diablerie came in he found impossible to discover. Experiment
  was necessary. The eyebrows&mdash;it could scarcely be the eyebrows? But he
  altered them. No, that was no better; in fact, if anything, a trifle more
  satanic. The corner of the mouth? Pah! more than ever a leer&mdash;and now,
  retouched, it was ominously grim. The eye, then? Catastrophe! he had filled
  his brush with vermilion instead of brown, and yet he had felt sure it was
  brown! The eye seemed now to have rolled in its socket, and was glaring at
  him an eye of fire. In a flash of passion, possibly with something of the
  courage of panic, he struck the brush full of bright red athwart the picture;
  and then a very curious thing, a very strange thing indeed, occurred&mdash;if
  it <i>did</i> occur.</p>

  <p><i>The diabolified Italian before him shut both his eyes, pursed his
  mouth, and wiped the colour off his face with his hand</i>.</p>

  <p>Then the <i>red eye</i> opened again, with a sound like the opening of
  lips, and the face smiled. "That was rather hasty of you," said the
  picture.</p>

  <p>Harringay states that, now that the worst had happened, his self-
  possession returned. He had a saving persuasion that devils were reasonable
  creatures.</p>

  <p>"Why do you keep moving about then," he said, "making faces and all that
  &mdash;sneering and squinting, while I am painting you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't," said the picture.</p>

  <p>"You <i>do</i>," said Harringay.</p>

  <p>"It's yourself," said the picture.</p>

  <p>"It's <i>not</i> myself," said Harringay.</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> yourself," said the picture. "No! don't go hitting me with
  paint again, because it's true. You have been trying to fluke an expression
  on my face all the morning. Really, you haven't an idea what your picture
  ought to look like."</p>

  <p>"I have," said Harringay.</p>

  <p>"You have <i>not</i>," said the picture: "You <i>never</i> have with your
  pictures. You always start with the vaguest presentiment of what you are
  going to do; it is to be something beautiful&mdash;you are sure of
  that&mdash;and devout, perhaps, or tragic; but beyond that it is all
  experiment and chance. My dear fellow! you don't think you can paint a
  picture like that?"</p>

  <p>Now it must be remembered that for what follows we have only Harringay's
  word.</p>

  <p>"I shall paint a picture exactly as I like," said Harringay, calmly.</p>

  <p>This seemed to disconcert the picture a little. "You can't paint a picture
  without an inspiration," it remarked.</p>

  <p>"But I <i>had</i> an inspiration&mdash;for this."</p>

  <p>"Inspiration!" sneered the sardonic figure; "a fancy that came from your
  seeing an organ-grinder looking up at a window! Vigil! Ha, ha! You just
  started painting on the chance of something coming&mdash;that's what you did.
  And when I saw you at it I came. I want a talk with you!"</p>

  <p>"Art, with you," said the picture,&mdash;"it's a poor business. You
  potter. I don't know how it is, but you don't seem able to throw your soul
  into it. You know too much. It hampers you. In the midst of your enthusiasms
  you ask yourself whether something like this has not been done before. And
  ..."</p>

  <p>"Look here," said Harringay, who had expected something better than
  criticism from the devil. "Are you going to talk studio to me?" He filled his
  number twelve hoghair with red paint.</p>

  <p>"The true artist," said the picture, "is always an ignorant man. An artist
  who theorises about his work is no longer artist but critic. Wagner...I
  say!&mdash;What's that red paint for?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to paint you out," said Harringay. "I don't want to hear all
  that Tommy Rot. If you think just because I'm an artist by trade I'm going to
  talk studio to you, you make a precious mistake."</p>

  <p>"One minute," said the picture, evidently alarmed. "I want to make you an
  offer&mdash;a genuine offer. It's right what I'm saying. You lack
  inspirations. Well. No doubt you've heard of the Cathedral of Cologne, and
  the Devil's Bridge, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rubbish," said Harringay. "Do you think I want to go to perdition simply
  for the pleasure of painting a good picture, and getting it slated. Take
  that."</p>

  <p>His blood was up. His danger only nerved him to action, so he says. So he
  planted a dab of vermilion in his creature's mouth. The Italian spluttered
  and tried to wipe it off&mdash;evidently horribly surprised. And
  then&mdash;according to Harringay&mdash;there began a very remarkable
  struggle, Harringay splashing away with the red paint, and the picture
  wriggling about and wiping it off as fast as he put it on. "<i>Two</i>
  masterpieces," said the demon. "Two indubitable masterpieces for a Chelsea
  artist's soul. It's a bargain?" Harringay replied with the paint brush.</p>

  <p>For a few minutes nothing could be heard but the brush going and the
  spluttering and ejaculations of the Italian. A lot of the strokes he caught
  on his arm and hand, though Harringay got over his guard often enough.
  Presently the paint on the palette gave out and the two antagonists stood
  breathless, regarding each other. The picture was so smeared with red that it
  looked as if it had been rolling about a slaughterhouse, and it was painfully
  out of breath and very uncomfortable with the wet paint trickling down its
  neck. Still, the first round was in its favour on the whole. "Think," it
  said, sticking pluckily to its point, "two supreme masterpieces&mdash;in
  different styles. Each equivalent to the Cathedral..."</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> know," said Harringay, and rushed out of the studio and along
  the passage towards his wife's boudoir.</p>

  <p>In another minute he was back with a large tin of enamel&mdash;Hedge
  Sparrow's Egg Tint, it was, and a brush. At the sight of that the artistic
  devil with the red eye began to scream. "<i>Three</i>
  masterpieces&mdash;culminating masterpieces."</p>

  <p>Harringay delivered cut two across the demon, and followed with a thrust
  in the eye. There was an indistinct rumbling. "<i>Four</i> masterpieces," and
  a spitting sound.</p>

  <p>But Harringay had the upper hand now and meant to keep it. With rapid,
  bold strokes he continued to paint over the writhing canvas, until at last it
  was a uniform field of shining Hedge Sparrow tint. Once the mouth reappeared
  and got as far as "Five master&mdash;" before he filled it with enamel; and
  near the end the red eye opened and glared at him indignantly. But at last
  nothing remained save a gleaming panel of drying enamel. For a little while a
  faint stirring beneath the surface puckered it slightly here and there, but
  presently even that died away and the thing was perfectly still.</p>

  <p>Then Harringay&mdash;according to Harringay's account&mdash;lit his pipe
  and sat down and stared at the enamelled canvas, and tried to make out
  clearly what had happened. Then he walked round behind it, to see if the back
  of it was at all remarkable. Then it was he began to regret he had not
  photographed the Devil before he painted him out.</p>

  <p>This is Harringay's story&mdash;not mine. He supports it by a small canvas
  (24 by 20) enamelled a pale green, and by violent asseverations. It is also
  true that he never has produced a masterpiece, and in the opinion of his
  intimate friends probably never will.</p>

     name="story17">THE MOTH</a></h2>

  <h3>First published as "A Moth--Genus Unknown" in <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>,
  March 28, 1895</h3>

  <p>Probably you have heard of Hapley&mdash;not W.T. Hapley, the son, but the
  celebrated Hapley, the Hapley of <i>Periplaneta Hapliia</i>, Hapley the
  entomologist. If so you know at least of the great feud between Hapley and
  Professor Pawkins. Though certain of its consequences may be new to you. For
  those who have not, a word or two of explanation is necessary, which the idle
  reader may go over with a glancing eye, if his indolence so incline him.</p>

  <p>It is amazing how very widely diffused is the ignorance of such really
  important matters as this Hapley-Pawkins feud. Those epoch-making
  controversies, again, that have convulsed the Geological Society, are, I
  verily believe, almost entirely unknown outside the fellowship of that body.
  I have heard men of fair general education even refer to the great scenes at
  these meetings as vestry-meeting squabbles. Yet the great Hate of the English
  and Scotch geologists has lasted now half a century, and has "left deep and
  abundant marks upon the body of the science." And this Hapley-Pawkins
  business, though perhaps a more personal affair, stirred passions as
  profound, if not profounder. Your common man has no conception of the zeal
  that animates a scientific investigator, the fury of contradiction you can
  arouse in him. It is the <i>odium theologicum</i> in a new form. There are
  men, for instance, who would gladly burn Professor Ray Lankester at
  Smithfield for his treatment of the Mollusca in the Encyclopaedia. That
  fantastic extension of the Cephalopods to cover the Pteropods...But I wander
  from Hapley and Pawkins.</p>

  <p>It began years and years ago, with a revision of the Microlepidoptera
  (whatever these may be) by Pawkins, in which he extinguished a new species
  created by Hapley. Hapley, who was always quarrelsome, replied by a stinging
  impeachment of the entire classification of Pawkins[A]. Pawkins, in his
  "Rejoinder[B]," suggested that Hapley's microscope was as defective as his
  powers of observation, and called him an "irresponsible meddler"&mdash;Hapley
  was not a professor at that time. Hapley, in his retort[C], spoke of
  "blundering collectors," and described, as if inadvertently, Pawkins'
  revision as a "miracle of ineptitude." It was war to the knife. However, it
  would scarcely interest the reader to detail how these two great men
  quarrelled, and how the split between them widened until from the
  Microlepidoptera they were at war upon every open question in entomology.
  There were memorable occasions. At times the Royal Entomological Society
  meetings resembled nothing so much as the Chamber of Deputies. On the whole,
  I fancy Pawkins was nearer the truth than Hapley. But Hapley was skilful with
  his rhetoric, had a turn for ridicule rare in a scientific man, was endowed
  with vast energy, and had a fine sense of injury in the matter of the
  extinguished species; while Pawkins was a man of dull presence, prosy of
  speech, in shape not unlike a water-barrel, over-conscientious with
  testimonials, and suspected of jobbing museum appointments. So the young men
  gathered round Hapley and applauded him. It was a long struggle, vicious from
  the beginning, and growing at last to pitiless antagonism. The successive
  turns of fortune, now an advantage to one side and now to another&mdash;now
  Hapley tormented by some success of Pawkins, and now Pawkins outshone by
  Hapley, belong rather to the history of entomology than to this story.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[Footnote A: "Remarks on a Recent Revision of
  Microlepidoptera." <i>Quart, Journ. Entomological Soc</i>. 1863.]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[Footnote B: "Rejoinder to certain Remarks," &amp;c.
  <i>Ibid</i>. 1864.]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[Footnote C: "Further Remarks," &amp;c. <i>Ibid</i>.]</p>

  <p>But in 1891 Pawkins, whose health had been bad for some time, published
  some work upon the "mesoblast" of the Death's Head Moth. What the mesoblast
  of the Death's Head Moth may be, does not matter a rap in this story. But the
  work was far below his usual standard, and gave Hapley an opening he had
  coveted for years. He must have worked night and day to make the most of his
  advantage.</p>

  <p>In an elaborate critique he rent Pawkins to tatters&mdash;one can fancy
  the man's disordered black hair, and his queer dark eyes flashing as he went
  for his antagonist&mdash;and Pawkins made a reply, halting, ineffectual, with
  painful gaps of silence, and yet malignant. There was no mistaking his will
  to wound Hapley, nor his incapacity to do it. But few of those who heard him
  &mdash;I was absent from that meeting&mdash;realised how ill the man was.</p>

  <p>Hapley had got his opponent down, and meant to finish him. He followed
  with a simply brutal attack upon Pawkins, in the form of a paper upon the
  development of moths in general, a paper showing evidence of a most
  extraordinary amount of mental labour, and yet couched in a violently
  controversial tone. Violent as it was, an editorial note witnesses that it
  was modified. It must have covered Pawkins with shame and confusion of face.
  It left no loophole; it was murderous in argument, and utterly contemptuous
  in tone; an awful thing for the declining years of a man's career.</p>

  <p>The world of entomologists waited breathlessly for the rejoinder from
  Pawkins. He would try one, for Pawkins had always been game. But when it came
  it surprised them. For the rejoinder of Pawkins was to catch the influenza,
  to proceed to pneumonia, and to die.</p>

  <p>It was perhaps as effectual a reply as he could make under the
  circumstances, and largely turned the current of feeling against Hapley. The
  very people who had most gleefully cheered on those gladiators became serious
  at the consequence. There could be no reasonable doubt the fret of the defeat
  had contributed to the death of Pawkins. There was a limit even to scientific
  controversy, said serious people. Another crushing attack was already in the
  press and appeared on the day before the funeral. I don't think Hapley
  exerted himself to stop it. People remembered how Hapley had hounded down his
  rival, and forgot that rival's defects. Scathing satire reads ill over fresh
  mould. The thing provoked comment in the daily papers. This it was that made
  me think that you had probably heard of Hapley and this controversy. But, as
  I have already remarked, scientific workers live very much in a world of
  their own; half the people, I dare say, who go along Piccadilly to the
  Academy every year, could not tell you where the learned societies abide.
  Many even think that Research is a kind of happy-family cage in which all
  kinds of men lie down together in peace.</p>

  <p>In his private thoughts Hapley could not forgive Pawkins for dying. In the
  first place, it was a mean dodge to escape the absolute pulverisation Hapley
  had in hand for him, and in the second, it left Hapley's mind with a queer
  gap in it. For twenty years he had worked hard, sometimes far into the night,
  and seven days a week, with microscope, scalpel, collecting-net, and pen, and
  almost entirely with reference to Pawkins. The European reputation he had won
  had come as an incident in that great antipathy. He had gradually worked up
  to a climax in this last controversy. It had killed Pawkins, but it had also
  thrown Hapley out of gear, so to speak, and his doctor advised him to give up
  work for a time, and rest. So Hapley went down into a quiet village in Kent,
  and thought day and night of Pawkins, and good things it was now impossible
  to say about him.</p>

  <p>At last Hapley began to realise in what direction the pre-occupation
  tended. He determined to make a fight for it, and started by trying to read
  novels. But he could not get his mind off Pawkins, white in the face, and
  making his last speech&mdash;every sentence a beautiful opening for Hapley.
  He turned to fiction&mdash;and found it had no grip on him. He read the
  "Island Nights' Entertainments" until his "sense of causation" was shocked
  beyond endurance by the Bottle Imp. Then he went to Kipling, and found he
  "proved nothing," besides being irreverent and vulgar. These scientific
  people have their limitations. Then unhappily, he tried Besant's "Inner
  House," and the opening chapter set his mind upon learned societies and
  Pawkins at once.</p>

  <p>So Hapley turned to chess, and found it a little more soothing. He soon
  mastered the moves and the chief gambits and commoner closing positions, and
  began to beat the Vicar. But then the cylindrical contours of the opposite
  king began to resemble Pawkins standing up and gasping ineffectually against
  Check-mate, and Hapley decided to give up chess.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the study of some new branch of science would after all be better
  diversion. The best rest is change of occupation. Hapley determined to plunge
  at diatoms, and had one of his smaller microscopes and Halibut's monograph
  sent down from London. He thought that perhaps if he could get up a vigorous
  quarrel with Halibut, he might be able to begin life afresh and forget
  Pawkins. And very soon he was hard at work, in his habitual strenuous
  fashion, at these microscopic denizens of the way-side pool.</p>

  <p>It was on the third day of the diatoms that Hapley became aware of a novel
  addition to the local fauna. He was working late at the microscope, and the
  only light in the room was the brilliant little lamp with the special form of
  green shade. Like all experienced microscopists, he kept both eyes open. It
  is the only way to avoid excessive fatigue. One eye was over the instrument,
  and bright and distinct before that was the circular field of the microscope,
  across which a brown diatom was slowly moving. With the other eye Hapley saw,
  as it were, without seeing[A]. He was only dimly conscious of the brass side
  of the instrument, the illuminated part of the table-cloth, a sheet of
  note-paper, the foot of the lamp, and the darkened room beyond.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[Footnote A: The reader unaccustomed to microscopes may
  easily understand this by rolling a newspaper in the form of a tube and
  looking through it at a book, keeping the other eye open.]</p>

  <p>Suddenly his attention drifted from one eye to the other. The table-cloth
  was of the material called tapestry by shopmen, and rather brightly coloured.
  The pattern was in gold, with a small amount of crimson and pale blue upon a
  greyish ground. At one point the pattern seemed displaced, and there was a
  vibrating movement of the colours at this point.</p>

  <p>Hapley suddenly moved his head back and looked with both eyes. His mouth
  fell open with astonishment.</p>

  <p>It was a large moth or butterfly; its wings spread in butterfly
  fashion!</p>

  <p>It was strange it should be in the room at all, for the windows were
  closed. Strange that it should not have attracted his attention when
  fluttering to its present position. Strange that it should match the
  table-cloth. Stranger far that to him, Hapley, the great entomologist, it was
  altogether unknown. There was no delusion. It was crawling slowly towards the
  foot of the lamp.</p>

  <p>"<i>Genus novo</i>, by heavens! And in England!" said Hapley, staring.</p>

  <p>Then he suddenly thought of Pawkins. Nothing would have maddened Pawkins
  more... And Pawkins was dead!</p>

  <p>Something about the head and body of the insect became singularly
  suggestive of Pawkins, just as the chess king had been.</p>

  <p>"Confound Pawkins!" said Hapley. "But I must catch this." And, looking
  round him for some means of capturing the moth, he rose slowly out of his
  chair. Suddenly the insect rose, struck the edge of the
  lampshade&mdash;Hapley heard the "ping"&mdash;and vanished into the
  shadow.</p>

  <p>In a moment Hapley had whipped off the shade, so that the whole room was
  illuminated. The thing had disappeared, but soon his practised eye detected
  it upon the wall paper near the door. He went towards it, poising the
  lamp-shade for capture. Before he was within striking distance, however, it
  had risen and was fluttering round the room. After the fashion of its kind,
  it flew with sudden starts and turns, seeming to vanish here and reappear
  there. Once Hapley struck, and missed; then again.</p>

  <p>The third time he hit his microscope. The instrument swayed, struck and
  overturned the lamp, and fell noisily upon the floor. The lamp turned over on
  the table and, very luckily, went out. Hapley was left in the dark. With a
  start he felt the strange moth blunder into his face.</p>

  <p>It was maddening. He had no lights. If he opened the door of the room the
  thing would get away. In the darkness he saw Pawkins quite distinctly
  laughing at him. Pawkins had ever an oily laugh. He swore furiously and
  stamped his foot on the floor.</p>

  <p>There was a timid rapping at the door.</p>

  <p>Then it opened, perhaps a foot, and very slowly. The alarmed face of the
  landlady appeared behind a pink candle flame; she wore a night-cap over her
  grey hair and had some purple garment over her shoulders. "What <i>was</i>
  that fearful smash?" she said. "Has anything&mdash;" The strange moth
  appeared fluttering about the chink of the door. "Shut that door!" said
  Hapley, and suddenly rushed at her.</p>

  <p>The door slammed hastily. Hapley was left alone in the dark. Then in the
  pause he heard his landlady scuttle upstairs, lock her door and drag
  something heavy across the room and put against it.</p>

  <p>It became evident to Hapley that his conduct and appearance had been
  strange and alarming. Confound the moth! and Pawkins! However, it was a pity
  to lose the moth now. He felt his way into the hall and found the matches,
  after sending his hat down upon the floor with a noise like a drum. With the
  lighted candle he returned to the sitting-room. No moth was to be seen. Yet
  once for a moment it seemed that the thing was fluttering round his head.
  Hapley very suddenly decided to give up the moth and go to bed. But he was
  excited. All night long his sleep was broken by dreams of the moth, Pawkins,
  and his landlady. Twice in the night he turned out and soused his head in
  cold water.</p>

  <p>One thing was very clear to him. His landlady could not possibly
  understand about the strange moth, especially as he had failed to catch it.
  No one but an entomologist would understand quite how he felt. She was
  probably frightened at his behaviour, and yet he failed to see how he could
  explain it. He decided to say nothing further about the events of last night.
  After breakfast he saw her in her garden, and decided to go out to talk to
  her to reassure her. He talked to her about beans and potatoes, bees,
  caterpillars, and the price of fruit. She replied in her usual manner, but
  she looked at him a little suspiciously, and kept walking as he walked, so
  that there was always a bed of flowers, or a row of beans, or something of
  the sort, between them. After a while he began to feel singularly irritated
  at this, and to conceal his vexation went indoors and presently went out for
  a walk.</p>

  <p>The moth, or butterfly, trailing an odd flavour of Pawkins with it, kept
  coming into that walk, though he did his best to keep his mind off it. Once
  he saw it quite distinctly, with its wings flattened out, upon the old stone
  wall that runs along the west edge of the park, but going up to it he found
  it was only two lumps of grey and yellow lichen. "This," said Hapley, "is the
  reverse of mimicry. Instead of a butterfly looking like a stone, here is a
  stone looking like a butterfly!" Once something hovered and fluttered round
  his head, but by an effort of will he drove that impression out of his mind
  again.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon Hapley called upon the Vicar, and argued with him upon
  theological questions. They sat in the little arbour covered with briar, and
  smoked as they wrangled. "Look at that moth!" said Hapley, suddenly, pointing
  to the edge of the wooden table.</p>

  <p>"Where?" said the Vicar.</p>

  <p>"You don't see a moth on the edge of the table there?" said Hapley.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," said the Vicar.</p>

  <p>Hapley was thunderstruck. He gasped. The Vicar was staring at him. Clearly
  the man saw nothing. "The eye of faith is no better than the eye of science,"
  said Hapley, awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"I don't see your point," said the Vicar, thinking it was part of the
  argument.</p>

  <p>That night Hapley found the moth crawling over his counterpane. He sat on
  the edge of the bed in his shirt-sleeves and reasoned with himself. Was it
  pure hallucination? He knew he was slipping, and he battled for his sanity
  with the same silent energy he had formerly displayed against Pawkins. So
  persistent is mental habit, that he felt as if it were still a struggle with
  Pawkins. He was well versed in psychology. He knew that such visual illusions
  do come as a result of mental strain. But the point was, he did not only
  <i>see</i> the moth, he had heard it when it touched the edge of the
  lampshade, and afterwards when it hit against the wall, and he had felt it
  strike his face in the dark.</p>

  <p>He looked at it. It was not at all dreamlike, but perfectly clear and
  solid-looking in the candle-light. He saw the hairy body, and the short
  feathery antennae, the jointed legs, even a place where the down was rubbed
  from the wing. He suddenly felt angry with himself for being afraid of a
  little insect.</p>

  <p>His landlady had got the servant to sleep with her that night, because she
  was afraid to be alone. In addition she had locked the door, and put the
  chest of drawers against it. They listened and talked in whispers after they
  had gone to bed, but nothing occurred to alarm them. About eleven they had
  ventured to put the candle out, and had both dozed off to sleep. They woke up
  with a start, and sat up in bed, listening in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Then they heard slippered feet going to and fro in Hapley's room. A chair
  was overturned, and there was a violent dab at the wall. Then a china mantel
  ornament smashed upon the fender. Suddenly the door of the room opened, and
  they heard him upon the landing. They clung to one another, listening. He
  seemed to be dancing upon the staircase. Now he would go down three or four
  steps quickly, then up again, then hurry down into the hall. They heard the
  umbrella stand go over, and the fanlight break. Then the bolt shot and the
  chain rattled. He was opening the door.</p>

  <p>They hurried to the window. It was a dim grey night; an almost unbroken
  sheet of watery cloud was sweeping across the moon, and the hedge and trees
  in front of the house were black against the pale roadway. They saw Hapley,
  looking like a ghost in his shirt and white trousers, running to and fro in
  the road, and beating the air. Now he would stop, now he would dart very
  rapidly at something invisible, now he would move upon it with stealthy
  strides. At last he went out of sight up the road towards the down. Then,
  while they argued who should go down and lock the door, he returned. He was
  walking very fast, and he came straight into the house, closed the door
  carefully, and went quietly up to his bedroom. Then everything was
  silent.</p>

  <p>"Mrs Colville," said Hapley, calling down the staircase next morning. "I
  hope I did not alarm you last night."</p>

  <p>"You may well ask that!" said Mrs Colville.</p>

  <p>"The fact is, I am a sleep-walker, and the last two nights I have been
  without my sleeping mixture. There is nothing to be alarmed about, really. I
  am sorry I made such an ass of myself. I will go over the down to Shoreham,
  and get some stuff to make me sleep soundly. I ought to have done that
  yesterday."</p>

  <p>But half-way over the down, by the chalk pits, the moth came upon Hapley
  again. He went on, trying to keep his mind upon chess problems, but it was no
  good. The thing fluttered into his face, and he struck at it with his hat in
  self-defence. Then rage, the old rage&mdash;the rage he had so often felt
  against Pawkins&mdash;came upon him again. He went on, leaping and striking
  at the eddying insect. Suddenly he trod on nothing, and fell headlong.</p>

  <p>There was a gap in his sensations, and Hapley found himself sitting on the
  heap of flints in front of the opening of the chalkpits, with a leg twisted
  back under him. The strange moth was still fluttering round his head. He
  struck at it with his hand, and turning his head saw two men approaching him.
  One was the village doctor. It occurred to Hapley that this was lucky. Then
  it came into his mind, with extraordinary vividness, that no one would ever
  be able to see the strange moth except himself, and that it behoved him to
  keep silent about it.</p>

  <p>Late that night, however, after his broken leg was set, he was feverish
  and forgot his self-restraint. He was lying flat on his bed, and he began to
  run his eyes round the room to see if the moth was still about. He tried not
  to do this, but it was no good. He soon caught sight of the thing resting
  close to his hand, by the night-light, on the green table-cloth. The wings
  quivered. With a sudden wave of anger he smote at it with his fist, and the
  nurse woke up with a shriek. He had missed it.</p>

  <p>"That moth!" he said; and then, "It was fancy. Nothing!"</p>

  <p>All the time he could see quite clearly the insect going round the cornice
  and darting across the room, and he could also see that the nurse saw nothing
  of it and looked at him strangely. He must keep himself in hand. He knew he
  was a lost man if he did not keep himself in hand. But as the night waned the
  fever grew upon him, and the very dread he had of seeing the moth made him
  see it. About five, just as the dawn was grey, he tried to get out of bed and
  catch it, though his leg was afire with pain. The nurse had to struggle with
  him.</p>

  <p>On account of this, they tied him down to the bed. At this the moth grew
  bolder, and once he felt it settle in his hair. Then, because he struck out
  violently with his arms, they tied these also. At this the moth came and
  crawled over his face, and Hapley wept, swore, screamed, prayed for them to
  take it off him, unavailingly.</p>

  <p>The doctor was a blockhead, a half-qualified general practitioner, and
  quite ignorant of mental science. He simply said there was no moth. Had he
  possessed the wit, he might still, perhaps, have saved Hapley from his fate
  by entering into his delusion and covering his face with gauze, as he prayed
  might be done. But, as I say, the doctor was a blockhead, and until the leg
  was healed Hapley was kept tied to his bed, and with the imaginary moth
  crawling over him. It never left him while he was awake and it grew to a
  monster in his dreams. While he was awake he longed for sleep, and from sleep
  he awoke screaming.</p>

  <p>So now Hapley is spending the remainder of his days in a padded room,
  worried by a moth that no one else can see. The asylum doctor calls it
  hallucination; but Hapley, when he is in his easier mood, and can talk, says
  it is the ghost of Pawkins, and consequently a unique specimen and well worth
  the trouble of catching.</p>

     name="story18">THE REMARKABLE CASE OF DAVIDSON'S EYES</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, March 28, 1895</h3>

  <h2>I</h2>

  <p>The transitory mental aberration of Sidney Davidson, remarkable enough in
  itself, is still more remarkable if Wade's explanation is to be credited. It
  sets one dreaming of the oddest possibilities of intercommunication in the
  future, of spending an intercalary five minutes on the other side of the
  world, or being watched in our most secret operations by unsuspected eyes. It
  happened that I was the immediate witness of Davidson's seizure, and so it
  falls naturally to me to put the story upon paper.</p>

  <p>When I say that I was the immediate witness of his seizure, I mean that I
  was the first on the scene. The thing happened at the Harlow Technical
  College, just beyond the Highgate Archway. He was alone in the larger
  laboratory when the thing happened. I was in a smaller room, where the
  balances are, writing up some notes. The thunderstorm had completely upset my
  work, of course. It was just after one of the louder peals that I thought I
  heard some glass smash in the other room. I stopped writing, and turned round
  to listen. For a moment I heard nothing; the hail was playing the devil's
  tattoo on the corrugated zinc of the roof. Then came another sound, a
  smash&mdash;no doubt of it this time. Something heavy had been knocked off
  the bench. I jumped up at once and went and opened the door leading into the
  big laboratory.</p>

  <p>I was surprised to hear a queer sort of laugh, and saw Davidson standing
  unsteadily in the middle of the room, with a dazzled look on his face. My
  first impression was that he was drunk. He did not notice me. He was clawing
  out at something invisible a yard in front of his face. He put out his hand,
  slowly, rather hesitatingly, and then clutched nothing. "What's come to it?"
  he said. He held up his hands to his face, fingers spread out. "Great Scot!"
  he said. The thing happened three or four years ago, when everyone swore by
  that personage. Then he began raising his feet clumsily, as though he had
  expected to find them glued to the floor.</p>

  <p>"Davidson!" cried I. "What's the matter with you?" He turned round in my
  direction and looked about for me. He looked over me and at me and on either
  side of me, without the slightest sign of seeing me. "Waves," he said; "and a
  remarkably neat schooner. I'd swear that was Bellows' voice. <i>Hullo</i>!"
  He shouted suddenly at the top of his voice.</p>

  <p>I thought he was up to some foolery. Then I saw littered about his feet
  the shattered remains of the best of our electrometers. "What's up, man?"
  said I. "You've smashed the electrometer!"</p>

  <p>"Bellows again!" said he. "Friends left, if my hands are gone. Something
  about electrometers. Which way <i>are</i> you, Bellows?" He suddenly came
  staggering towards me. "The damned stuff cuts like butter," he said. He
  walked straight into the bench and recoiled. "None so buttery that!" he said,
  and stood swaying.</p>

  <p>I felt scared. "Davidson," said I, "what on earth's come over you?"</p>

  <p>He looked round him in every direction. "I could swear that was Bellows.
  Why don't you show yourself like a man, Bellows?"</p>

  <p>It occurred to me that he must be suddenly struck blind. I walked round
  the table and laid my hand upon his arm. I never saw a man more startled in
  my life. He jumped away from me, and came round into an attitude of
  self-defence, his face fairly distorted with terror. "Good God!" he cried.
  "What was that?"</p>

  <p>"It's I&mdash;Bellows. Confound it, Davidson!"</p>

  <p>He jumped when I answered him and stared&mdash;how can I express it?
  &mdash;right through me. He began talking, not to me, but to himself. "Here
  in broad daylight on a clear beach. Not a place to hide in." He looked about
  him wildly. "Here! I'm <i>off</i>." He suddenly turned and ran headlong into
  the big electro-magnet&mdash;so violently that, as we found afterwards, he
  bruised his shoulder and jawbone cruelly. At that he stepped back a pace, and
  cried out with almost a whimper, "What, in heaven's name, has come over me?"
  He stood, blanched with terror and trembling violently, with his right arm
  clutching his left, where that had collided with the magnet.</p>

  <p>By that time I was excited and fairly scared. "Davidson," said I, "don't
  be afraid."</p>

  <p>He was startled at my voice, but not so excessively as before. I repeated
  my words in as clear and firm a tone as I could assume. "Bellows," he said,
  "is that you?"</p>

  <p>"Can't you see it's me?"</p>

  <p>He laughed. "I can't even see it's myself. Where the devil are we?"</p>

  <p>"Here," said I, "in the laboratory."</p>

  <p>"The laboratory!" he answered, in a puzzled tone, and put his hand to his
  forehead. "I <i>was</i> in the laboratory&mdash;till that flash came, but I'm
  hanged if I'm there now. What ship is that?"</p>

  <p>"There's no ship," said I. "Do be sensible, old chap."</p>

  <p>"No ship!" he repeated, and seemed to forget my denial forthwith. "I
  suppose," said he, slowly, "we're both dead. But the rummy part is I feel
  just as though I still had a body. Don't get used to it all at once, I
  suppose. The old shop was struck by lightning, I suppose. Jolly quick thing,
  Bellows&mdash;eigh?"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense. You're very much alive. You are in the laboratory,
  blundering about. You've just smashed a new electrometer. I don't envy you
  when Boyce arrives."</p>

  <p>He stared away from me towards the diagrams of cryohydrates. "I must be
  deaf," said he. "They've fired a gun, for there goes the puff of smoke, and I
  never heard a sound."</p>

  <p>I put my hand on his arm again, and this time he was less alarmed. "We
  seem to have a sort of invisible bodies," said he. "By Jove! there's a boat
  coming round the headland. It's very much like the old life after
  all&mdash;in a different climate."</p>

  <p>I shook his arm. "Davidson," I cried, "wake up!"</p><br>

  <h2>II</h2>

  <p>It was just then that Boyce came in. So soon as he spoke Davidson
  exclaimed: "Old Boyce! Dead too! What a lark!" I hastened to explain that
  Davidson was in a kind of somnambulistic trance. Boyce was interested at
  once. We both did all we could to rouse the fellow out of his extraordinary
  state. He answered our questions, and asked us some of his own, but his
  attention seemed distracted by his hallucination about a beach and a ship. He
  kept interpolating observations concerning some boat and the davits and sails
  filling with the wind. It made one feel queer, in the dusky laboratory, to
  hear him saying such things.</p>

  <p>He was blind and helpless. We had to walk him down the passage, one at
  each elbow, to Boyce's private room, and while Boyce talked to him there, and
  humoured him about this ship idea, I went along the corridor and asked old
  Wade to come and look at him. The voice of our Dean sobered him a little, but
  not very much. He asked where his hands were, and why he had to walk about up
  to his waist in the ground. Wade thought over him a long time&mdash;you know
  how he knits his brows&mdash;and then made him feel the couch, guiding his
  hands to it. "That's a couch," said Wade. "The couch in the private room of
  Professor Boyce. Horsehair stuffing."</p>

  <p>Davidson felt about, and puzzled over it, and answered presently that he
  could feel it all right, but he couldn't see it.</p>

  <p>"What <i>do</i> you see?" asked Wade. Davidson said he could see nothing
  but a lot of sand and broken-up shells. Wade gave him some other things to
  feel, telling him what they were, and watching him keenly.</p>

  <p>"The ship is almost hull down," said Davidson, presently, <i>apropos</i>
  of nothing.</p>

  <p>"Never mind the ship," said Wade. "Listen to me, Davidson. Do you know
  what hallucination means?"</p>

  <p>"Rather," said Davidson.</p>

  <p>"Well, everything you see is hallucinatory."</p>

  <p>"Bishop Berkeley," said Davidson.</p>

  <p>"Don't mistake me," said Wade. "You are alive and in this room of Boyce's.
  But something has happened to your eyes. You cannot see; you can feel and
  hear, but not see. Do you follow me?"</p>

  <p>"It seems to me that I see too much." Davidson rubbed his knuckles into
  his eyes. "Well?" he said.</p>

  <p>"That's all. Don't let it perplex you. Bellows, here, and I will take you
  home in a cab."</p>

  <p>"Wait a bit." Davidson thought. "Help me to sit down," said he, presently;
  "and now&mdash;I'm sorry to trouble you&mdash;but will you tell me all that
  over again?"</p>

  <p>Wade repeated it very patiently. Davidson shut his eyes, and pressed his
  hands upon his forehead. "Yes," said he. "It's quite right. Now my eyes are
  shut I know you're right. That's you, Bellows, sitting by me on the couch.
  I'm in England again. And we're in the dark."</p>

  <p>Then he opened his eyes, "And there," said he, "is the sun just rising,
  and the yards of the ship, and a tumbled sea, and a couple of birds flying. I
  never saw anything so real. And I'm sitting up to my neck in a bank of
  sand."</p>

  <p>He bent forward and covered his face with his hands. Then he opened his
  eyes again. "Dark sea and sunrise! And yet I'm sitting on a sofa in old
  Boyce's room!...God help me!"</p><br>

  <h2>III</h2>

  <p>That was the beginning. For three weeks this strange affection of
  Davidson's eyes continued unabated. It was far worse than being blind. He was
  absolutely helpless, and had to be fed like a newly-hatched bird, and led
  about and undressed. If he attempted to move he fell over things or stuck
  himself against walls or doors. After a day or so he got used to hearing our
  voices without seeing us, and willingly admitted he was at home, and that
  Wade was right in what he told him. My sister, to whom he was engaged,
  insisted on coming to see him, and would sit for hours every day while he
  talked about this beach of his. Holding her hand seemed to comfort him
  immensely. He explained that when we left the College and drove home&mdash;he
  lived in Hampstead village&mdash;it appeared to him as if we drove right
  through a sandhill&mdash;it was perfectly black until he emerged
  again&mdash;and through rocks and trees and solid obstacles, and when he was
  taken to his own room it made him giddy and almost frantic with the fear of
  falling, because going upstairs seemed to lift him thirty or forty feet above
  the rocks of his imaginary island. He kept saying he should smash all the
  eggs. The end was that he had to be taken down into his father's consulting
  room and laid upon a couch that stood there.</p>

  <p>He described the island as being a bleak kind of place on the whole, with
  very little vegetation, except some peaty stuff, and a lot of bare rock.
  There were multitudes of penguins, and they made the rocks white and
  disagreeable to see. The sea was often rough, and once there was a
  thunderstorm, and he lay and shouted at the silent flashes. Once or twice
  seals pulled up on the beach, but only on the first two or three days. He
  said it was very funny the way in which the penguins used to waddle right
  through him, and how he seemed to lie among them without disturbing them.</p>

  <p>I remember one odd thing, and that was when he wanted very badly to smoke.
  We put a pipe in his hands&mdash;he almost poked his eye out with it
  &mdash;and lit it. But he couldn't taste anything. I've since found it's the
  same with me&mdash;I don't know if it's the usual case&mdash;that I cannot
  enjoy tobacco at all unless I can see the smoke.</p>

  <p>But the queerest part of his vision came when Wade sent him out in a bath-
  chair to get fresh air. The Davidsons hired a chair, and got that deaf and
  obstinate dependent of theirs, Widgery, to attend to it. Widgery's ideas of
  healthy expeditions were peculiar. My sister, who had been to the Dogs' Home,
  met them in Camden Town, towards King's Cross, Widgery trotting along
  complacently, and Davidson evidently most distressed, trying in his feeble,
  blind way to attract Widgery's attention.</p>

  <p>He positively wept when my sister spoke to him. "Oh, get me out of this
  horrible darkness!" he said, feeling for her hand. "I must get out of it, or
  I shall die." He was quite incapable of explaining what was the matter, but
  my sister decided he must go home, and presently, as they went up hill
  towards Hampstead, the horror seemed to drop from him. He said it was good to
  see the stars again, though it was then about noon and a blazing day.</p>

  <p>"It seemed," he told me afterwards, "as if I was being carried
  irresistibly towards the water. I was not very much alarmed at first. Of
  course it was night there&mdash;a lovely night."</p>

  <p>"Of course?" I asked, for that struck me as odd.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said he. "It's always night there when it is day here...
  Well, we went right into the water, which was calm and shining under the
  moonlight&mdash;just a broad swell that seemed to grow broader and flatter as
  I came down into it. The surface glistened just like a skin&mdash;it might
  have been empty space underneath for all I could tell to the contrary. Very
  slowly, for I rode slanting into it, the water crept up to my eyes. Then I
  went under and the skin seemed to break and heal again about my eyes. The
  moon gave a jump up in the sky and grew green and dim, and fish, faintly
  glowing, came darting round me&mdash;and things that seemed made of luminous
  glass, and I passed through a tangle of seaweeds that shone with an oily
  lustre. And so I drove down into the sea, and the stars went out one by one,
  and the moon grew greener and darker, and the seaweed became a luminous
  purple-red. It was all very faint and mysterious, and everything seemed to
  quiver. And all the while I could hear the wheels of the bath-chair creaking,
  and the footsteps of people going by, and a man in the distance selling the
  special <i>Pall Mall</i>.</p>

  <p>"I kept sinking down deeper and deeper into the water. It became inky
  black about me, not a ray from above came down into that darkness, and the
  phosphorescent things grew brighter and brighter. The snaky branches of the
  deeper weeds flickered like the flames of spirit lamps; but, after a time,
  there were no more weeds. The fishes came staring and gaping towards me, and
  into me and through me. I never imagined such fishes before. They had lines
  of fire along the sides of them as though they had been outlined with a
  luminous pencil. And there was a ghastly thing swimming backwards with a lot
  of twining arms. And then I saw, coming very slowly towards me through the
  gloom, a hazy mass of light that resolved itself as it drew nearer into
  multitudes of fishes, struggling and darting round something that drifted. I
  drove on straight towards it, and presently I saw in the midst of the tumult,
  and by the light of the fish, a bit of splintered spar looming over me, and a
  dark hull tilting over, and some glowing phosphorescent forms that were
  shaken and writhed as the fish bit at them. Then it was I began to try to
  attract Widgery's attention. A horror came upon me. Ugh! I should have driven
  right into those half-eaten&mdash;things. If your sister had not come! They
  had great holes in them, Bellows, and...Never mind. But it was
  ghastly!"</p><br>

  <h2>IV</h2>

  <p>For three weeks Davidson remained in this singular state, seeing what at
  the time we imagined was an altogether phantasmal world, and stone blind to
  the world around him. Then, one Tuesday, when I called I met old Davidson in
  the passage. "He can see his thumb!" the old gentleman said, in a perfect
  transport. He was struggling into his overcoat. "He can see his thumb,
  Bellows!" he said, with the tears in his eyes. "The lad will be all right
  yet."</p>

  <p>I rushed in to Davidson. He was holding up a little book before his face,
  and looking at it and laughing in a weak kind of way.</p>

  <p>"It's amazing," said he. "There's a kind of patch come there." He pointed
  with his finger. "I'm on the rocks as usual, and the penguins are staggering
  and flapping about as usual, and there's been a whale showing every now and
  then, but it's got too dark now to make him out. But put something
  <i>there</i>, and I see it&mdash;I do see it. It's very dim and broken in
  places, but I see it all the same, like a faint spectre of itself. I found it
  out this morning while they were dressing me. It's like a hole in this
  infernal phantom world. Just put your hand by mine. No&mdash;not there. Ah!
  Yes! I see it. The base of your thumb and a bit of cuff! It looks like the
  ghost of a bit of your hand sticking out of the darkling sky. Just by it
  there's a group of stars like a cross coming out."</p>

  <p>From that time Davidson began to mend. His account of the change, like his
  account of the vision, was oddly convincing. Over patches of his field of
  vision, the phantom world grew fainter, grew transparent, as it were, and
  through these translucent gaps he began to see dimly the real world about
  him. The patches grew in size and number, ran together and spread until only
  here and there were blind spots left upon his eyes. He was able to get up and
  steer himself about, feed himself once more, read, smoke, and behave like an
  ordinary citizen again. At first it was very confusing to him to have these
  two pictures overlapping each other like the changing views of a lantern, but
  in a little while he began to distinguish the real from the illusory.</p>

  <p>At first he was unfeignedly glad, and seemed only too anxious to complete
  his cure by taking exercise and tonics. But as that odd island of his began
  to fade away from him, he became queerly interested in it. He wanted
  particularly to go down into the deep sea again, and would spend half his
  time wandering about the low lying parts of London, trying to find the
  water-logged wreck he had seen drifting. The glare of real daylight very soon
  impressed him so vividly as to blot out everything of his shadowy world, but
  of a night time, in a darkened room, he could still see the white-splashed
  rocks of the island, and the clumsy penguins staggering to and fro. But even
  these grew fainter and fainter, and, at last, soon after he married my
  sister, he saw them for the last time.</p><br>

  <h2>V</h2>

  <p>And now to tell of the queerest thing of all. About two years after his
  cure I dined with the Davidsons, and after dinner a man named Atkins called
  in. He is a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and a pleasant, talkative man. He
  was on friendly terms with my brother-in-law, and was soon on friendly terms
  with me. It came out that he was engaged to Davidson's cousin, and
  incidentally he took out a kind of pocket photograph case to show us a new
  rendering of <i>fiancee</i>. "And, by-the-by," said he, "here's the old
  <i>Fulmar</i>."</p>

  <p>Davidson looked at it casually. Then suddenly his face lit up. "Good
  heavens!" said he. "I could almost swear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What?" said Atkins.</p>

  <p>"That I had seen that ship before."</p>

  <p>"Don't see how you can have. She hasn't been out of the South Seas for six
  years, and before then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But," began Davidson, and then, "Yes&mdash;that's the ship I dreamt of,
  I'm sure that's the ship I dreamt of. She was standing off an island that
  swarmed with penguins, and she fired a gun."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" said Atkins, who had now heard the particulars of the
  seizure. "How the deuce could you dream that?"</p>

  <p>And then, bit by bit, it came out that on the very day Davidson was
  seized, H.M.S. <i>Fulmar</i> had actually been off a little rock to the south
  of Antipodes Island. A boat had landed overnight to get penguins' eggs, had
  been delayed, and a thunderstorm drifting up, the boat's crew had waited
  until the morning before rejoining the ship. Atkins had been one of them, and
  he corroborated, word for word, the descriptions Davidson had given of the
  island and the boat. There is not the slightest doubt in any of our minds
  that Davidson has really seen the place. In some unaccountable way, while he
  moved hither and thither in London, his sight moved hither and thither in a
  manner that corresponded, about this distant island. <i>How</i> is absolutely
  a mystery.</p>

  <p>That completes the remarkable story of Davidson's eyes. It's perhaps the
  best authenticated case in existence of a real vision at a distance.
  Explanation there is none forthcoming, except what Professor Wade has thrown
  out. But his explanation invokes the Fourth Dimension, and a dissertation on
  theoretical kinds of space. To talk of there being "a kink in space" seems
  mere nonsense to me; it may be because I am no mathematician. When I said
  that nothing would alter the fact that the place is eight thousand miles
  away, he answered that two points might be a yard away on a sheet of paper
  and yet be brought together by bending the paper round. The reader may grasp
  his argument, but I certainly do not. His idea seems to be that Davidson,
  stooping between the poles of the big electro-magnet, had some extraordinary
  twist given to his retinal elements through the sudden change in the field of
  force due to the lightning.</p>

  <p>He thinks, as a consequence of this, that it may be possible to live
  visually in one part of the world, while one lives bodily in another. He has
  even made some experiments in support of his views; but, so far, he has
  simply succeeded in blinding a few dogs. I believe that is the net result of
  his work, though I have not seen him for some weeks. Latterly I have been so
  busy with my work in connection with the Saint Pancras installation that I
  have had little opportunity of calling to see him. But the whole of his
  theory seems fantastic to me. The facts concerning Davidson stand on an
  altogether different footing, and I can testify personally to the accuracy of
  every detail I have given.</p>

     name="story19">A CATASTROPHE</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The New Budget</i>, April 4, 1895</h3>

  <p>The little shop was not paying. The realisation came insensibly. Winslow
  was not the man for definite addition and subtraction and sudden discovery.
  He became aware of the truth in his mind gradually, as though it had always
  been there. A lot of facts had converged and led him there. There was that
  line of cretonnes-four half-pieces&mdash;untouched, save for half a yard sold
  to cover a stool. There were those shirting at 4 3/4d.&mdash;Bandersnatch, in
  the Broadway, was selling them at 2 3/4d.&mdash;under cost, in fact. (Surely
  Bandersnatch might let a man live!) Those servants' caps, a selling line,
  needed replenishing, and that brought back the memory of Winslow's sole
  wholesale dealers, Helter, Skelter, and Grab. Why! How about their
  account?</p>

  <p>Winslow stood with a big green box on the counter before him when he
  thought of it. His pale grey eyes grew a little rounder; his pale, straggling
  moustache twitched. He had been drifting along, day after day. He went round
  to the ramshackle cash-desk in the corner&mdash;it was Winslow's weakness to
  sell his goods over the counter, give his customers a duplicate bill, and
  then dodge into the desk to receive the money, as though he doubted his own
  honesty. His lank forefinger, with the prominent joints, ran down the bright
  little calendar ("Clack's Cottons last for All Time").
  "One&mdash;two&mdash;three; three weeks an' a day!" said Winslow, staring.
  "March! Only three weeks and a day. It can't be."</p>

  <p>"Tea dear," said Mrs. Winslow, opening the door with the glass window and
  the white blind that communicated with the parlour.</p>

  <p>"One minute," said Winslow, and began unlocking the desk.</p>

  <p>An irritable old gentleman, very hot and red about the face, and in a
  heavy fur-lined coat, came in noisily. Mrs. Winslow vanished.</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" said the old gentleman. "Pocket-handkerchief."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Winslow. "About what price&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" said the old gentleman. "Poggit-handkerchief, quig!"</p>

  <p>Winslow began to feel flustered. He produced two boxes.</p>

  <p>"These sir&mdash;" began Winslow.</p>

  <p>"Sheed tin!" said the old gentleman, clutching the stiffness of the linen.
  "Wad to blow my nose&mdash;not haggit about."</p>

  <p>"A cotton one, p'raps, sir?" said Winslow.</p>

  <p>"How much?" said the old gentleman over the handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Sevenpence, sir. There's nothing more I can show you? No ties,
  braces&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Damn!" said the old gentleman, fumbling in his ticket-pocket, and finally
  producing half a crown. Winslow looked round for his metallic duplicate-book
  which he kept in various fixtures, according to circumstances, and then he
  caught the old gentleman's eye. He went straight to the desk at once and got
  the change, with an entire disregard of routine of the shop.</p>

  <p>Winslow was always more or less excited by a customer. But the open desk
  reminded him of his trouble. It did not come back to him all at once. He
  heard a finger-nail softly tapping on the glass, and looking up saw Minnie's
  eyes over the blind. It seemed like retreat opening. He shut and locked the
  desk, and went into the back room to tea.</p>

  <p>But he was preoccupied. Three weeks and a day! He took unusually large
  bites of his bread and butter, and stared hard at the little pot of jam. He
  answered Minnie's conversational advances distractedly. The shadow of Helter,
  Skelter, and Grab lay upon the tea-table. He was struggling with this new
  idea of failure, the tangible realisation that was taking shape and
  substance, condensing, as it were, out of the misty uneasiness of many days.
  At present it was simply one concrete fact; there were thirty-nine pounds
  left in the bank, and that day three weeks Messrs. Helter, Skelter, and Grab,
  those enterprising outfitters of young men, would demand their eighty
  pounds.</p>

  <p>After tea there was a customer or so&mdash;small purchases: some muslin
  and buckram, dress-protectors, tape, and a pair of Lisle hose. Then, knowing
  that Black Care was lurking in the dusky corners of the shop, he lit the
  three lamps early and set to, refolding his cotton prints, the most vigorous
  and least meditative proceeding of which he could think. He could see
  Minnie's shadow in the other room as she moved about the table. She was busy
  turning an old dress. He had a walk after supper, looked in at the Y.M.C.A.,
  but found no one to talk to, and finally went to bed. Minnie was already
  there. And there too, waiting for him, nudging him gently, until about
  midnight he was hopelessly awake, sat Black Care.</p>

  <p>He had, had one or two nights lately in that company, but this was much
  worse. First came Messrs. Helter, Skelter, and Garb, and their demand for
  eighty pounds&mdash;an enormous sum when your original capital was only a
  hundred and seventy. They camped, as it were, before him, sat down and
  beleaguered him. He clutched feebly at the circumambient darkness for
  expedients. Suppose he had a sale, sold things for almost anything? He tried
  to imagine a sale miraculously successful in some unexpected manner, and
  mildly profitable, in spite of reductions below cost. Then Bandersnatch
  Limited, 101, 102, 103, 105, 106, 107 Broadway, joined the siege, a long
  caterpillar of frontage, a battery of shop fronts, wherein things were sold
  at a farthing above cost. How could he fight such an establishment? Besides,
  what had he to sell? He began to review his resources. What taking line was
  there to bait the sale? Then straightway came those pieces of cretonne,
  yellow and black, with a bluish-green flower; those discredited skirtings,
  prints without buoyancy, skirmishing haberdashery, some despairful
  four-button gloves by an inferior maker&mdash;a hopeless crew. And that was
  his force against Bandersnatch, Helter, Skelter, and Garb, and the pitiless
  world behind them. Whatever had made him think a mortal would buy such
  things? Why had he bought this and neglected that? He suddenly realised the
  intensity of his hatred for Helter, Skelter, and Garb's salesman. Then he
  drove towards an agony of self-reproach. He had spent too much on that
  cash-desk. What real need was there of a desk? He saw his vanity of that desk
  in a lurid glow of self-discovery. And the lamps? Five pounds! Then suddenly,
  with what was almost physical pain, he remembered the rent.</p>

  <p>He groaned and turned over. And there, dim in the darkness, was the
  hummock of Mrs. Winslow's shoulder. That set him off in another direction. He
  became acutely sensible of Minnie's want of feeling. Here he was, worried to
  death about business, and she sleeping like a little child. He regretted
  having married, with that infinite bitterness that only comes to the human
  heart in the small hours of the morning. That hummock of white seemed
  absolutely without helpfulness, a burden, a responsibility. What fools men
  were to marry! Minnie's inert repose irritated his so much that he was almost
  provoked to wake her up and tell her that they were "Ruined." She would have
  to go back to her uncle; her uncle had always been against him: and as for
  his own future, Winslow was exceedingly uncertain. A shop assistant who has
  once set up for himself finds the utmost difficulty in getting into a
  situation again. He began to figure himself "crib-hunting" once more, going
  from this wholesale house to that, writing innumerable letters. How he hated
  writing letters! "Sir&mdash;, Referring to your advertisement in the
  Christian World." He beheld an infinite vista of discomfort and
  disappointment, ending&mdash;in a gulf.</p>

  <p>He dressed, yawning, and went down to open the shop. He felt tired before
  the day began. As he carried the shutters in, he kept asking himself what
  good he was doing. The end was inevitable, whether he bothered or not. The
  clear daylight smote into the place, and showed how old and rough and
  splintered was the floor, how shabby the second-hand counter, how hopeless
  the whole enterprise. He had been dreaming these past six months of a bright
  shop, of a happy couple, of a modest but comely profit flowing in. He had
  suddenly awakened from his dream. The braid that bound his decent black
  coat-it was a trifle loose-caught against the catch of the shop door, and was
  torn away. This suddenly turned his wretchedness to wrath. He stood quivering
  for a moment, then with a spiteful clutch, tore the braid looser, and went in
  to Minnie.</p>

  <p>"Here," he said, with infinite reproach; "look here! You might look after
  a chap a bit."</p>

  <p>"I didn't see it torn," said Minnie.</p>

  <p>"You never do," said Winslow, with gross injustice, "until things are too
  late."</p>

  <p>Minnie looked suddenly at his face. "I'll sew it now, Sid, if you
  like."</p>

  <p>"Let's have breakfast first," said Winslow, and do things at their proper
  time.</p>

  <p>He was preoccupied at breakfast, and Minnie watched him anxiously. His
  only remark was to declare his egg a bad one. It wasn't; it was flavoury
  &mdash;, being one of those at fifteen a shilling&mdash;, but quite nice. He
  pushed it away from him, and then, having eaten a slice of bread and butter,
  admitted himself in the wrong by resuming the egg.</p>

  <p>"Sid," said Minnie, as he stood up to go into the shop again, "you're not
  well."</p>

  <p>"I'm well enough." He looked at her as though he hated her.</p>

  <p>"Then there's something else the matter. You aren't angry with me, Sid,
  are you, about that braid? Do tell me what's the matter. You were just like
  this at tea yesterday, and at supper-time. It wasn't the braid then."</p>

  <p>"And I'm likely to be."</p>

  <p>She looked interrogation. "Oh, what is the matter?" she said.</p>

  <p>It was too good a chance to miss, and he brought the evil news out with
  dramatic force. "Matter?" he said. "I done my best, and here we are. That's
  the matter! If I can't pay Helter, Skelter, and Garb eighty pounds, this day
  three weeks&mdash;" Pause. "We shall be sold up! Sold up! That's the matter,
  Min! Sold Up!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sid!" began Minnie.</p>

  <p>He slammed the door. For the moment he felt relieved of at least half his
  misery. He began dusting boxes that did not require dusting, and then
  reblocked a cretonne already faultlessly blocked. He was in a state of grim
  wretchedness; a martyr under the harrow of fate. At anyrate, it should not be
  said he failed for want of industry. And how he had planned and contrived and
  worked! All to this end! He felt horrible doubts. Providence and
  Bandersnatch&mdash;surely they were incompatible! Perhaps he was being
  "tried"? That sent him off upon a new tack, a very comforting one. The martyr
  pose, the gold-in-the-furnace attitude, lasted all the morning.</p>

  <p>At dinner&mdash;"potato pie&mdash;" he looked up suddenly, and saw
  Minnie's face regarding him. Pale she looked, and a little red about the
  eyes. Something caught him suddenly with a queer effect upon his throat. All
  his thoughts seemed to wheel round into quite a new direction.</p>

  <p>He pushed back his plate and stared at her blankly. Then he got up, went
  round the table to her&mdash;she staring at him. He dropped on his knees
  beside her without a word. "Oh, Minnie!" he said, and suddenly she knew it
  was peace, and put her arms about him, as he began to sob and weep.</p>

  <p>He cried like a little boy, slobbering on her shoulder that he was a knave
  to have married her and brought her to this, that he hadn't the wits to be
  trusted with a penny, that it was all his fault; that he "had hoped
  so&mdash;" ending in a howl. And she, crying gently herself, patting his
  shoulders, said "Ssh!" softly to his noisy weeping, and so soothed the
  outbreak. Then suddenly the crazy bell upon the shop door began, and Winslow
  had to jump to his feet, and be a man again.</p>

  <p>After that scene they "talked it over" at tea, at supper, in bed, at every
  possible interval in between, solemnly&mdash;quite inconclusively&mdash;with
  set faces and eyes for the most part staring in front of them&mdash;and yet
  with a certain mutual comfort. "What to do I don't know," was Winslow's main
  proposition. Minnie tried to take a cheerful view of service&mdash;with a
  probable baby. But she found she needed all her courage. And her uncle would
  help her again, perhaps just at the critical time. It didn't do for folks to
  be too proud. Besides, "something might happen," a favourite formula with
  her.</p>

  <p>One hopeful line was to anticipate a sudden afflux of customers.
  "Perhaps," said Minnie, "you might get together fifty. They know you well
  enough to trust you a bit." They debated that point. Once the possibility of
  Helter, Skelter, and Garb giving credit was admitted, it was pleasant to
  begin sweating the acceptable minimum. For some half-hour over tea the second
  day after Winslow's discoveries they were quite cheerful again, laughing even
  at their terrific fears. Even twenty pounds to go on with might be considered
  enough. Then in some mysterious way the pleasant prospect of Messrs. Helter,
  Skelter, and Garb tempering the wind to the shorn retailer
  vanished&mdash;vanished absolutely, and Winslow found himself again in the
  pit of despair.</p>

  <p>He began looking about at the furniture, and wondering idly what it would
  fetch. The chiffonier was good, anyhow, and there were Minnie's old plates
  that her mother used to have. Then he began to think of desperate expedients
  for putting off the evil day. He had heard somewhere of Bills of
  Sale&mdash;there was to his ears something comfortingly substantial in the
  phrase. Then, why not "Go to the Money-Lenders"?</p>

  <p>One cheering thing happened on Thursday afternoon a little girl came in
  with a pattern of "print," and he was able to match it. He had not been able
  to match anything out of his meagre stock before. He went in and told Minnie.
  The incident is mentioned lest the reader should imagine it was uniform
  despair with him.</p>

  <p>The next morning, and the next, after the discovery, Winslow opened shop
  late. When one has been awake most of the night, and has no hope, what is the
  good of getting up punctually? But as he went into the dark shop on Friday he
  saw something lying on the floor, something lit by the bright light that came
  under the ill-fitting door&mdash;a black oblong. He stooped and picked up an
  envelope with a deep mourning edge. It was addressed to his wife. Clearly a
  death in her family&mdash;perhaps her uncle. He knew the man too well to have
  expectations. And they would have to get mourning and go to the funeral. The
  brutal cruelty of people dying! He saw it all in a flash&mdash;he always
  visualised his thoughts. Black trousers to get, black crape, black gloves
  &mdash;none in stock&mdash;the railway fares, the shop closed for the
  day.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid there's bad news, Minnie," he said.</p>

  <p>She was kneeling before the fireplace, blowing the fire. She had her
  housemaid's gloves on and the old country sun-bonnet she wore of a morning,
  to keep the dust out of her hair. She turned, saw the envelope, gave a gasp,
  and pressed two bloodless lips together.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it's uncle," she said, holding the letter and staring with
  eyes wide open into Winslow's face. "It's a strange hand!"</p>

  <p>"The postmark's Hull," said Winslow.</p>

  <p>"The postmark's Hull."</p>

  <p>Minnie opened the letter slowly, drew it out, hesitated, turned it over,
  saw the signature. "It's Mr. Speight!"</p>

  <p>"What does he say?" said Winslow.</p>

  <p>Minnie began to read. "Oh!" she screamed. She dropped the letter,
  collapsed into a crouching heap, her hands covering her eyes. Winslow
  snatched at it. "A most terrible accident has occurred," he read; "Melchior's
  chimney fell down yesterday evening right on the top of your uncle's house,
  and every living soul was killed&mdash;your uncle, your cousin Mary, Will and
  Ned, and the girl&mdash;every one of them, and smashed&mdash;you would hardly
  know them. I'm writing to you to break the news before you see it in the
  papers&mdash;" The letter fluttered from Winslow's fingers. He put out his
  hand against the mantel to steady himself.</p>

  <p>All of them dead! Then he saw, as in a vision, a row of seven cottages,
  each let at seven shillings a week, a timber yard, two villas, and the ruins
  &mdash;still marketable&mdash;of the avuncular residence. He tried to feel a
  sense of loss and could not. They were sure to have been left to Minnie's
  aunt. All dead! 7x7x52&divide;20 began insensibly to work itself out in his
  mind, but discipline was ever weak in his mental arithmetic; figures kept
  moving from one line to another, like children playing at Widdy, Widdy Way.
  Was it two hundred pounds about&mdash;or one hundred pounds? Presently he
  picked up the letter again, and finished reading it. "You being the next of
  kin," said Mr. Speight.</p>

  <p>"How awful!" said Minnie in horror-struck whisper, and looking up at last.
  Winslow stared back at her, shaking his head solemnly. There were a thousand
  things running through his mind, but none that, even to his dull sense,
  seemed appropriate as a remark. "It was the Lord's will," he said at
  last.</p>

  <p>"It seems so very, very terrible," said Minnie; "auntie, dear auntie
  &mdash;Ted&mdash;poor, dear uncle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was the Lord's will, Minnie," said Winslow, with infinite feeling. A
  long silence.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Minnie, very slowly, staring thoughtfully at the crackling
  black paper in the grate. The fire had gone out. "Yes, perhaps it was the
  Lord's will."</p>

  <p>They looked gravely at one another. Each would have been terribly shocked
  at any mention of the property by the other. She turned to the dark fireplace
  and began tearing up an old newspaper slowly. Whatever our losses may be, the
  world's work still waits for us. Winslow gave a deep sigh and walked in a
  hushed manner towards the front door. As he opened it, a flood of sunlight
  came streaming into the dark shadows of the closed shop. Bandersnatch,
  Helter, Skelter, and Garb, had vanished out of his mind like the mists before
  the rising sun.</p>

  <p>Presently he was carrying in the shutters, and in the briskest way, the
  fire in the kitchen was crackling exhilaratingly, with a little saucepan
  walloping above it, for Minnie was boiling two eggs&mdash;, one for herself
  this morning, as well as one for him&mdash;, and Minnie herself was audible,
  laying breakfast with the great eclat. The blow was a sudden and terrible one
  &mdash;but it behoves us to face such things bravely in this sad,
  unaccountable world. It was quite midday before either of them mentioned the
  cottages.</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The New Budget</i>, May 23, 1895</h3>

  <p>"You are always so sympathetic," she said; and added, reflectively, "and
  one can talk of one's troubles to you without any nonsense."</p>

  <p>I wondered dimly if she meant that as a challenge. I helped myself to a
  biscuit thing that looked neither poisonous nor sandy. "You are one of the
  most puzzling human beings I ever met," I said,&mdash;a perfectly safe remark
  to any woman under any circumstances.</p>

  <p>"Do you find me so hard to understand?" she said.</p>

  <p>"You are dreadfully complex." I bit at the biscuit thing, and found it
  full of a kind of creamy bird-lime. (I wonder why women will arrange these
  unpleasant surprises for me&mdash;I sickened of sweets twenty years ago.)</p>

  <p>"How so?" she was saying, and smiling her most brilliant smile.</p>

  <p>I have no doubt she thought we were talking rather nicely. "Oh!" said I,
  and waved the cream biscuit thing. "You challenge me to dissect you."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"And that is precisely what I cannot do."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you are very satirical," she said, with a touch of
  disappointment. She is always saying that when pur conversation has become
  absolutely idiotic&mdash;as it invariably does. I felt an inevitable desire
  to quote bogus Latin to her. It seemed the very language for her.</p>

  <p>"Malorum fiducia pars quosque libet," I said, in a low voice, looking
  meaningly into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she said, colouring a little, and turned to pour hot water into the
  teapot, looking prettily at me over her arm as she did so.</p>

  <p>"That is one of the truest things that has ever been said of sympathy," I
  remarked. "Don't you think so?"</p>

  <p>"Sympathy," she said, "is a very wonderful thing, and a very precious
  thing."</p>

  <p>"You speak," said I (with a cough behind my hand), "as though you knew
  what it was to be lonely."</p>

  <p>"There is solitude even in a crowd," she said, and looked round at the six
  other people&mdash;three discreet pairs&mdash;who were in the room.</p>

  <p>"I, too," I was beginning, but Hopdangle came with a teacup, and seemed
  inclined to linger. He belongs to the "Nice Boy" class, and gives himself
  ridiculous airs of familiarity with grown-up people.</p>

  <p>Then the Giffens went.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, I always take such an interest in your work," she was saying
  to me, when her husband (confound him!) came into the room.</p>

  <p>He was a violent discord. He wore a short brown jacket and carpet
  slippers, and three of his waistcoat buttons were (as usual) undone. "Got any
  tea left, Millie?" he said, and came and sat down in the arm-chair beside the
  table.</p>

  <p>"How do, Delalune?" he said to the man in the comer. "Damned ho, Bellows,"
  he remarked to me, subsiding creakily.</p>

  <p>She poured some more hot water into the teapot. (Why must charming married
  women always have these husbands?)</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> very hot," I said.</p>

  <p>There was a perceptible pause. He is one of those rather adipose people,
  who are not disconcerted by conversational gaps. "Are you, too, working at
  Argon?" I said. He is some kind of chemical investigator, I know.</p>

  <p>He began at once to explain the most horribly complex things about
  elements to me. She gave him his tea, and rose and went and talked to the
  other people about autotypes. "Yes," I said, not hearing what he was
  saying.</p>

  <p>"'No' would be more appropriate," he said. "You are absent-minded,
  Bellows. Not in love, I hope&mdash;at your age ? "</p>

  <p>Really, I am not thirty, but a certain perceptible thinness in my hair may
  account for his invariably regarding me as a contemporary. But he should
  understand that nowadays the beginnings of baldness merely mark the virile
  epoch.</p>

  <p>"I say, Millie," he said, out loud and across the roo, "you haven't been
  collecting Bellows here, have you?"</p>

  <p>She looked round startled, and I saw a paied look come into her eyes. "For
  the bazaar?" she said " Not yet, dear." It seemed to me that she shot a
  glance of entreaty at him. Then she turned to the others again.</p>

  <p>"My wife," he said, "has two distinctive traits. She is a born poetess and
  a born collector. I ought to warn you."</p>

  <p>"I did not know," said I, "that she rhymed."</p>

  <p>"I was speaking more of the imaginative quality, the temperament that
  finds a splendour in the grass, a glory in the flower, that clothes the whole
  world in a vestiture of interpretation."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" I said I felt she was watching us anxiously. He could not, of
  course, suspect. But I was relieved to fancy he was simply talking
  nonsense.</p>

  <p>"The magnificent figures of heroic, worshipful, and mysterious womanhood
  naturally appeal to her&mdash;Cleopatra, Messalina, Beatrice, the Madonna,
  and so forth."</p>

  <p>"And she is writing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, she is acting. That is the real poetry of women and children. A
  platonic Cleopatra of infinite variety, spotless reputation, and a large
  following. Her make-believe is wonderful. She would use FalstafF for Romeo
  without a twinge, if no one else was at hand. She could exert her self to
  break the heart of a soldier. I assure you, Bellows&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I heard her dress rustle behind me.</p>

  <p>"I want some more tea," he said to her. "You misunderstood me about the
  collecting Millie."</p>

  <p>"What were you saying about Cleopatra?" she said, trying, I think, to look
  sternly at him.</p>

  <p>"Scandal," he said. "But about the collecting, Bellows&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You must come to this bazaar," she interrupted.</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted," I said, boldly. "Where is it, and when?"</p>

  <p>"About this collecting," he began.</p>

  <p>"It is in aid of that delightful orphanage at Wimblingham," she explained,
  and gave me an animated account of the charity. He emptied his second cup of
  tea. "May I have a third cup?" he said.</p>

  <p>The two girls signalled departure, and her attention was distracted. "She
  collects&mdash;and I will confess she does it with extraordinary
  skill&mdash;the surreptitious addresses&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"John," she said over her shoulder, "I wish you would tell Miss Smithers
  all those interesting things about Argon." He gulped down his third cup, and
  rose with the easy obedience of the trained husband. Presently she returned
  to the tea-things. "Cannot I fill your cup?" she asked</p>

  <p>"I really hope John was not telling you his queer notions about me. He
  says the most remarkable things. Quite lately he has got it into his head
  that he has a formula for my character."</p>

  <p>"I wish <i>I</i> had," I said with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"And he goes about explaining me to people as if I was a mechanism. 'Scalp
  collector,' I think is the favourite phrase. Did he tell you? Don't you think
  it perfectly horrid of him?"</p>

  <p>"But he doesn't understand you," I said, not grasping his meaning quite at
  the minute.</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"You have," I said with infinite meaning, "my sincere sympathy&mdash;" I
  hesistated&mdash;"my whole sympathy."</p>

  <p>"Thank you <i>so much</i>," she said quite as meaningly. I rose forthwith,
  and we clasped hands, like souls who strike a compact.</p>

  <p>Yet, thinking over what he said afterwards, I was troublcd by a fancy that
  there was the faintest suggestion of a smile of triumph aboat her lips and
  mouth. Possibly it was only an honourable pride. I suppose he has poisoned my
  mind a little. Of course, I should not like to think of myself as one of a
  fortuitously selected multitude strung neatly together (if one may use the
  vulgarism) on a pece of string,&mdash;a stringful like a boy's string of
  chestnuts,&mdash;nice old gentlemen, nice boys, sympathetic and humorous men
  of thirty, kind fellows, gifted dreamers, and dashing blades, all trailing
  after her. It is confoundedly bad form of him, anyhow, to guy her visitors.
  She certainly took it like a saint. Of course, I shall see her again soon,
  and we shall talk to one another about one another. Something or other
  cropped up and prevented my going there on her last Tuesday.</p>

     name="story21">POLLOCK AND THE PORROH MAN</a></h2>

  <h3>Fist published in <i>The New Budget</i>, May 23, 1895</h3>

  <p>It was in a swampy village on the lagoon river behind the Turner Peninsula
  that Pollock's first encounter with the Porroh man occurred. The women of
  that country are famous for their good looks&mdash;they are Gallinas with a
  dash of European blood that dates from the days of Vasco de Gama and the
  English slave-traders, and the Porroh man too, was possibly inspired by a
  faint Caucasian taint in his composition. (It's a curious thing to think that
  some of us may have distant cousins eating men on Sherboro Island or raiding
  with the Sofas.) At anyrate, the Porroh man stabbed the woman to the heart as
  though he had been a mere low-class Italian, and very narrowly missed
  Pollock. But Pollock, using his revolver to parry the lightning stab which
  was aimed at his deltoid muscle, sent the iron dagger flying, and firing, hit
  the man in the hand.</p>

  <p>He fired again and missed, knocking a sudden window out of the wall of the
  hut. The Porroh man stooped in the doorway, glancing under his arm at
  Pollock. Pollock caught a glimpse of his inverted face in the sunlight, and
  then the Englishman was alone, sick and trembling with the excitement of the
  affair, in the twilight of the place. It had all happened in less time than
  it takes to read about it.</p>

  <p>The woman was quite dead, and having ascertained this, Pollock went to the
  entrance of the hut and looked out. Things outside were dazzling bright. Half
  a dozen of the porters of the expedition were standing up in a group near the
  green huts they occupied, and staring towards him, wondering what the shots
  might signify. Behind the little group of men was the broad stretch of black
  fetid mud by the river, a green carpet of rafts of papyrus and water-grass,
  and then the leaden water. The mangroves beyond the stream loomed
  indistinctly through the blue haze. There were no signs of excitement in the
  squat village, whose fence was just visible above the cane-grass.</p>

  <p>Pollock came out of the hut cautiously and walked towards the river,
  looking over his shoulder at intervals. But the Porroh man had vanished
  Pollock clutched his revolver nervously in his hand.</p>

  <p>One of his men came to meet him, and as he came, pointed to the bushes
  behind the hut in which the Porroh man had disappeared. Pollock had an
  irritating persuasion of having made an absolute fool of himself; he felt
  bitter, savage, at the turn things had taken. At the same time, he would have
  to tell Waterhouse&mdash;the moral, exemplary, cautious Waterhouse&mdash;who
  would inevitably take the matter seriously. Pollock cursed bitterly at his
  luck, at Waterhouse, and especially at the West Coast of Africa. He felt
  consummately sick of the expedition. And in the back of his mind all the time
  was a speculative doubt where precisely within the visible horizon the Porroh
  man might be.</p>

  <p>It is perhaps rather shocking, but he was not at all upset by the murder
  that had just happened. He had seen so much brutality during the last three
  months, so many dead women, burnt huts, drying skeletons, up the Kittam River
  in the wake of the Sofa cavalry, that his senses were blunted. What disturbed
  him was the persuasion that this business was only beginning.</p>

  <p>He swore savagely at the black, who ventured to ask a question, and went
  on into the tent under the orange-trees where Waterhouse was lying, feeling
  exasperatingly like a boy going into the headmaster's study.</p>

  <p>Waterhouse was still sleeping off the effects of his last dose of
  chlorodyne, and Pollock sat down on a packing-case beside him, and lighting
  his pipe, waited for him to awake. About him were scattered the pots and
  weapons Waterhouse had collected from the Mendi people, and which he had been
  repacking for the canoe voyage to Sulyma.</p>

  <p>Presently Waterhouse woke up, and after judicial stretching, decided he
  was all right again. Pollock got him some tea. Over the tea, the incidents of
  the afternoon were described by Pollock, after some preliminary beating about
  the bush. Waterhouse took the matter even more seriously than Pollock had
  anticipated. He did not simply disapprove, he scolded, he insulted.</p>

  <p>"You're one of those infernal fools who think a black man isn't a human
  being," he said. "I can't be ill a day without you must get into some dirty
  scrape or other. This is the third time in a month that you have come
  crossways-on with a native, and this time you're in for it with a vengance.
  Porroh, too! They're down upon you enough as it is, about that idol you wrote
  your silly name on. And they're the most vindictive devils on earth! You make
  a man ashamed of civilisation. To think you come of a decent family! If ever
  I cumber myself up with a vicious, stupid young lout like you
  again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Steady on, now," snarled Pollock, in the tone that always exasperated
  Waterhouse; "steady on."</p>

  <p>At that Waterhouse became speechless. He jumped to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Pollock," he said, after a struggle to control his breath.
  "You must go home. I won't have you any longer. I'm ill enough as it is,
  through you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Keep your hair on," said Pollock, staring in front of him. "I'm ready
  enough to go."</p>

  <p>Waterhouse became calmer again. He sat down on the camp-stool. "Very
  well," he said. "I don't want a row, Pollock you know, but it's confoundedly
  annoying to have one's plans put out by this kind of thing. I'll come to
  Sulyma with you, and see you safe aboard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You needn't," said Pollock. "I can go alone. From here."</p>

  <p>"Not far," said Waterhouse. "You don't understand this Porroh
  business."</p>

  <p>"How should I know she belonged to a Porroh man?" said Pollock
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Well, she did," said Waterhouse; "and you can't undo the thing. Go alone,
  indeed! I wonder what they'd do to you. You don't seem to understand that
  this Porroh hokey-pokey rules this country, is its law, religion,
  constitution, medicine, magic... They appoint the chiefs. The Inquisition, at
  its best, couldn't hold a candle to these chaps. He will probably set
  Awajale, the chief here, on to us. It's lucky our porters are Mendis. We
  shall have to shift this little settlement of ours... Confound you, Pollock!
  And, of course, you must go and miss him."</p>

  <p>He thought, and his thoughts seemed disagreeable. Presently he stood up
  and took his rifle. "I'd keep close for a bit, if I were you," he said, over
  his shoulder, as he went out. "I'm going out to see what I can find out about
  it."</p>

  <p>Pollock remained sitting in the tent, meditating. "I was meant for a
  civilised life," he said to himself, regretfully, as he filled his pipe. "The
  sooner I get back to London or Paris the better for me."</p>

  <p>His eye fell on the sealed case in which Waterhouse had put the
  featherless poisoned arrows they had bought in the Mendi country. "I wish I
  had hit the beggar somewhere vital," said Pollock viciously.</p>

  <p>Waterhouse came back after a long interval. He was not communicative,
  though Pollock asked him questions enough. The Porroh man, it seems was a
  prominent member of that mystical society. The village was interested, but
  not threatening. No doubt the witch-doctor had gone into the bush. He was a
  great witch-doctor. "Of course, he's up to something," said Waterhouse, and
  became silent.</p>

  <p>"But what can he do?" asked Pollock, unheeded.</p>

  <p>"I must get you out of this. There's something brewing, or things would
  not be so quiet," said Waterhouse, after a gap of silence. Pollock wanted to
  know what the brew might be. "Dancing in a circle of skulls", said
  Waterhouse; "brewing a stink in a copper pot." Pollock wanted particulars.
  Waterhouse was vague, Pollock pressing. At last Waterhouse lost his temper.
  "How the devil should I know?" he said to Pollock's twentieth inquiry what
  the Porroh man would do. "He tried to kill you off-hand in the hut. Now, I
  fancy he will try something more elaborate. But you'll see fast enough. I
  don't want to help unnerve you. It's probably all nonsense."</p>

  <p>That night, as they were sitting at their fire, Pollock again tried to
  draw Waterhouse out on the subject of Porroh methods. "Better get to sleep,"
  said Waterhouse, when Pollock's bent became apparent; "we start early to-
  morrow. You may want all your nerve about you."</p>

  <p>"But what line will he take?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say. They're versatile people. They know a lot of rum dodges. You'd
  better get that copper-devil, Shakespear, to talk."</p>

  <p>There was a flash and a heavy bang, out of the darkness behind the huts,
  and a clay bullet came whistling close to Pollock's head. This, at least, was
  crude enough. The blacks and half-breeds sitting and yarning round their own
  fire jumped up, and someone fired into the dark.</p>

  <p>"Better go into one of the huts," said Waterhouse quietly, still sitting
  unmoved.</p>

  <p>Pollock stood up by the fire and drew his revolver. Fighting, at least, he
  was not afraid of. But a man in the dark is in the best of armour. Realising
  the wisdom of Waterhouse's advice, Pollock went into the tent and lay down
  there.</p>

  <p>What little sleep he had was disturbed by dreams, variegated dreams, but
  chiefly of the Porroh man's face, upside down, as he went out of the hut, and
  looked up under his arm. It was odd that this transitory impression should
  have stuck so firmly in Pollock's memory. Moreover, he was troubled by queer
  pains in his limbs.</p>

  <p>In the white haze of the early morning, as they were loading the canoes, a
  barbed arrow suddenly appeared quivering in the ground close to Pollock's
  foot. The boys made a perfunctory effort to clear out the thicket, but it led
  to no capture.</p>

  <p>After these two occurrences, there was a disposition on the part of the
  expedition to leave Pollock to himself, and Pollock became, for the first
  time in his life, anxious to mingle with blacks. Waterhouse took one canoe,
  and Pollock, in spite of a friendly desire to chat with Waterhouse, had to
  take the other. He was left all alone in the front part of the canoe, and he
  had the greatest trouble to make the men&mdash;who did not love
  him&mdash;keep to the middle of the river, a clear hundred yards or more from
  either shore. However, he made Shakespear, the Freetown half-breed, come up
  to his own end of the canoe and tell him about Porroh, which Shakespear,
  failing in his attempts to leave Pollock alone, presently did with
  considerable freedom and gusto.</p>

  <p>The day passed. The canoe glided swiftly along the ribbon of lagoon water,
  between the drift of water-figs, fallen trees, papyrus, and palm-wine palms,
  and with the dark mangrove swamp to the left, through which one could hear
  now and then the roar of the Atlantic surf. Shakespear told in his soft,
  blurred English of how the Porroh could cast spells; how men withered up
  under their malice; how they could send dreams and devils; how they tormented
  and killed the sons of Ijibu; how they kidnapped a white trader from Sulyma
  who had maltreated one of the sect, and how his body looked when it was
  found. And Pollock after each narrative cursed under his breath at the want
  of missionary enterprise that allowed such things to be, and at the inert
  British Government that ruled over this dark heathendom of Sierra Leone. In
  the evening they came to the Kasi Lake, and sent a score of crocodiles
  lumbering off the island on which the expedition camped for the night.</p>

  <p>The next day they reached Sulyma, and smelt the sea breeze, but Pollock
  had to put up there for five days before he could get on to Freetown.
  Waterhouse, considering him to be comparatively safe here, and within the
  pale of Freetown influence, left him and went back with the expedition to
  Gbemma, and Pollock became very friendly with Perera, the only resident white
  trader at Sulyma&mdash;so friendly, indeed, that he went about with him
  everywhere. Perera was a little Portuguese Jew, who had lived in England, and
  he appreciated the Englishman's friendliness as a great compliment.</p>

  <p>For two days nothing happened out of the ordinary; for the most part
  Pollock and Perera played Nap&mdash;the only game they had in
  common&mdash;and Pollock got into debt. Then, on the second evening, Pollock
  had a disagreeable intimation of the arrival of the Porroh man in Sulyma by
  getting a flesh-wound in the shoulder from a lump of filed iron. It was a
  long shot, and the missile had nearly spent its force when it hit him. Still
  it conveyed its message plainly enough. Pollock sat up in his hammock,
  revolver in hand, all that night, and next morning confided, to some extent,
  in the Anglo-Portuguese.</p>

  <p>Perera took the matter seriously. He knew the local customs pretty
  thoroughly. "It is a personal question, you must know. It is revenge. And of
  course he is hurried by your leaving de country. None of de natives or half-
  breeds will interfere wid him very much&mdash;unless you make it wort deir
  while. If you come upon him suddenly, you might shoot him. But den he might
  shoot you."</p>

  <p>"Den dere's dis&mdash;infernal magic," said Perera. "Of course, I don't
  believe in it&mdash;superstition&mdash;but still it's not nice to tink dat
  wherever you are, dere is a black man, who spends a moonlight night now and
  den a-dancing about a fire to send you bad dreams... Had any bad dreams?"</p>

  <p>"Rather," said Pollock. "I keep on seeing the beggar's head upside down
  grinning at me and showing all his teeth as he did in the hut, and coming
  close up to me, and then going ever so far off, and coming back. It's nothing
  to be afraid of, but somehow it simply paralyses me with terror in my sleep.
  Queer things&mdash;dreams. I know it's a dream all the time, and I can't wake
  up from it."</p>

  <p>"It's probably only fancy," said Perera. "Den my niggers say Porroh men
  can send snakes. Seen any snakes lately?"</p>

  <p>"Only one. I killed him this morning, on the floor near my hammock. Almost
  trod on him as I got up."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Perera, and then, reassuringly, "Of course it is
  a&mdash;coincidence. Still I would keep my eyes open. Den dere's pains in de
  bones."</p>

  <p>"I thought they were due to miasma," said Pollock.</p>

  <p>"Probably dey are. When did dey begin?"</p>

  <p>Then Pollock remembered that he first noticed them the night after the
  fight in the hut. "It's my opinion he don't want to kill you," said Perera
  &mdash;"at least not yet. I've heard deir idea is to scare and worry a man
  wid deir spells, and narrow misses, and rheumatic pains, and bad dreams, and
  all dat, until he's sick of life. Of course, it's all talk, you know. You
  mustn't worry about it... But I wonder what he'll be up to next."</p>

  <p>"I shall have to be up to something first," said Pollock, staring gloomily
  at the greasy cards that Perera was putting on the table. "It don't suit my
  dignity to be followed about, and shot at, and blighted in this way. I wonder
  if Porroh hokey-pokey upsets your luck at cards."</p>

  <p>He looked at Perera suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Very likely it does," said Perera warmly, shuffling. "Dey are wonderful
  people."</p>

  <p>That afternoon Pollock killed two snakes in his hammock, and there was
  also an extraordinary increase in the number of red ants that swarmed over
  the place; and these annoyances put him in a fit temper to talk over business
  with a certain Mendi rough he had interviewed before. The Mendi rough showed
  Pollock a little iron dagger, and demonstrated where one struck in the neck,
  in a way that made Pollock shiver, and in return for certain considerations
  Pollock promised him a double-barrelled gun with an ornamental lock.</p>

  <p>In the evening, as Pollock and Perera were playing cards, the Mendi rough
  came in through the doorway, carrying something in a blood-soaked piece of
  native cloth.</p>

  <p>"Not here!" said Pollock very hurriedly. "Not here!"</p>

  <p>But he was not quick enough to prevent the man, who was anxious to get to
  Pollock's side of the bargain, from opening the cloth and throwing the head
  of the Porroh man upon the table. It bounded from there on to the floor,
  leaving a red trail on the cards, and rolled into the corner, where it came
  to rest upside down, but glaring hard at Pollock.</p>

  <p>Perera jumped up as the thing fell among the cards, and began in his
  excitement to gabble in Portuguese. The Mendi was bowing, with the red cloth
  in his hand. "De gun!" he cried. Pollock stared back at the head in the
  corner. It bore exactly the expression it had in his dreams. Something seemed
  to snap in his own brain as he looked at it.</p>

  <p>Then Perera found his English again.</p>

  <p>"You got him killed?" he said. "You did not kill him yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" said Pollock.</p>

  <p>"But he will not be able to take it off now!"</p>

  <p>"Take what off?" said Pollock.</p>

  <p>"And all dese cards are spoiled!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by taking off?" said Pollock.</p>

  <p>"You must send me a new pack from Freetown. You can buy dem dere.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;'take it off'?"</p>

  <p>"It is only superstition. I forgot. De niggers say dat if de witches
  &mdash;he was a witch&mdash;But it is rubbish... You must make de Porroh man
  take it off, or kill him yourself... It is very silly."</p>

  <p>Pollock swore under his breath, still staring hard at the head in the
  corner.</p>

  <p>"I can't stand that glare," he said. Then suddenly he rushed at the thing
  and kicked it. It rolled some yards or so, and came to rest in the same
  position as before, upside down, and looking at him.</p>

  <p>"He is ugly," said the Anglo-Portuguese. "Very ugly. Dey do it on deir
  faces with little knives."</p>

  <p>Pollock would have kicked the head again, but the Mendi man touched him on
  the arm. "De gun?" he said, looking nervously at the head.</p>

  <p>"Two&mdash;if you will take that beastly thing away," said Pollock.</p>

  <p>The Mendi shook his head, and intimated that he only wanted one gun now
  due to him, and for which he would be obliged. Pollock found neither cajolery
  nor bullying any good with him. Perera had a gun to sell (at a profit of
  three hundred per cent), and with that the man presently departed. Then
  Pollock's eyes, against his will, were recalled to the thing on the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"It is funny dat his head keeps upside down," said Perera, with an uneasy
  laugh. "His brains must be heavy, like de weight in de little images one sees
  dat keep always upright wid lead in dem. You will take him wiv you when you
  go presently. You might take him now. De cards are all spoilt. Dere is a man
  sell dem in Freetown. De room is in a filthy mess as it is. You should have
  killed him yourself."</p>

  <p>Pollock pulled himself together, and went and picked up the head. He would
  hang it up by the lamp-hook in the middle of the ceiling of his room, and dig
  a grave for it at once. He was under the impression that he hung it up by the
  hair, but that must have been wrong, for when he returned for it, it was
  hanging by the neck upside down.</p>

  <p>He buried it before sunset on the north side of the shed he occupied, so
  that he should not have to pass the grave after dark when he was returning
  from Perera's. He killed two snakes before he went to sleep. In the darkest
  part of the night he awoke with a start, and heard a pattering sound and
  something scraping on the floor. He sat up noiselessly, and felt under his
  pillow for his revolver. A mumbling growl followed, and Pollock fired at the
  sound. There was a yelp, and something dark passed for a moment across the
  hazy blue of the doorway. "A dog!" said Pollock, lying down again.</p>

  <p>In the early dawn he awoke again with a peculiar sense of unrest. The
  vague pain in his bones had returned. For some time he lay watching the red
  ants that were swarming over the ceiling, and then, as the light grew
  brighter, he looked over the edge of his hammock and saw something dark on
  the floor. He gave such a violent start that the hammock overset and flung
  him out.</p>

  <p>He found himself lying, perhaps, a yard away from the head of the Porroh
  man. It had been disinterred by the dog, and the nose was grievously
  battered. Ants and flies swarmed over it. By an odd coincidence, it was still
  upside down, and with the same diabolical expression in the inverted
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Pollock sat paralysed, and stared at the horror for some time. Then he got
  up and walked round it&mdash;giving it a wide berth&mdash;and out of the
  shed. The clear light of the sunrise, the living stir of vegetation before
  the breath of the dying land-breeze, and the empty grave with the marks of
  the dog's paws, lightened the weight upon his mind a little.</p>

  <p>He told Perera of the business as though it was a jest&mdash;a jest to be
  told with white lips. "You should not have frighten de dog," said Perera,
  with poorly simulated hilarity.</p>

  <p>The next two days, until the steamer came, were spent by Pollock in making
  a more effectual disposition of his possession. Overcoming his aversion to
  handling the thing, he went down to the river mouth and threw it into the
  sea-water, but by some miracle it escaped the crocodiles, and was cast up by
  the tide on the mud a little way up the river, to be found by an intelligent
  Arab half-breed, and offered for sale to Pollock and Perera as a curiosity,
  just on the edge of night. The native hung about in the brief twilight,
  making lower and lower offers, and at last, getting scared in some way by the
  evident dread, these wise white men had for the thing, went off, and passing
  Pollock's shed, threw his burden in there for Pollock to discover in the
  morning.</p>

  <p>At this Pollock got into a kind of frenzy. He would burn the thing. He
  went out straightway into the dawn, and had constructed a big pyre of
  brushwood before the heat of the day. He was interrupted by the hooter of the
  little paddle steamer from Monrovia to Bathurst, which was coming through the
  gap in the bar. "Thank Heaven!" said Pollock, with infinite piety, when the
  meaning of the sound dawned upon him. With trembling hands he lit his pile of
  wood hastily, threw the head upon it, and went away to pack his portmanteau
  and make his adieux to Perera.</p>

  <p>That afternoon, with a sense of infinite relief, Pollock watched the flat
  swampy foreshore of Sulyma grow small in the distance. The gap in the long
  line of white surge became narrower and narrower. It seemed to be closing in
  and cutting him off from his trouble. The feeling of dread and worry began to
  slip from him bit by bit. At Sulyma belief in Porroh malignity and Porroh
  magic had been in the air, his sense of Porroh had been vast, pervading,
  threatening, dreadful. Now manifestly the domain of Porroh was only a little
  place, a little black band between the sea and the blue cloudy Mendi
  uplands.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Porroh!" said Pollock. "Good-bye&mdash;certainly not au
  revoir."</p>

  <p>The captain of the steamer came and leant over the rail beside him, and
  wished him good-evening, and spat at the froth of the wake in token of
  friendly ease.</p>

  <p>"I picked up a rummy curio on the beach this go," said the captain. "It's
  a thing I never saw done this side of Indy before."</p>

  <p>"What might that be?" said Pollock.</p>

  <p>"Pickled 'ed," said the captain.</p>

  <p>"What!" said Pollock.</p>

  <p>"'Ed&mdash;smoked. 'Ed of one of those Porroh chaps, all ornamented with
  knife-cuts. Why! What's up? Nothing? I shouldn't have took you for a nervous
  chap. Green in the face. By gosh! You're a bad sailor. All right, eh? Lord,
  how funny you went...! Well, this 'ed I was telling you of is a bit rum in a
  way. I've got it, along with some snakes, in a jar of spirit in my cabin what
  I keeps for such curios, and I'm hanged if it don't float upsy down.
  Hullo!"</p>

  <p>Pollock had given an incoherent cry, and had his hands in his hair. He ran
  towards the paddle-boxes with a half-formed idea of jumping into the sea, and
  then he realised his position and turned back towards the captain.</p>

  <p>"Here!" said the captain. "Jack Philips, just keep him off me! Stand off!
  No nearer, mister! What's the matter with you? Are you mad?"</p>

  <p>Pollock put his hand to his head. It was no good explaining. "I believe I
  am pretty nearly mad at times," he said. "It's a pain I have here. Comes
  suddenly. You'll excuse me, I hope."</p>

  <p>He was white and in a perspiration. He saw suddenly very clearly all the
  danger he ran of having his sanity doubted. He forced himself to restore the
  captain's confidence, by answering his sympathetic inquiries, noting his
  suggestions, even trying a spoonful of neat brandy in his cheek, and that
  matter settled, asking a number of questions about the captain's private
  trade in curiosities. The captain described the head in detail. All the while
  Pollock was struggling to keep under a preposterous persuasion that the ship
  was as transparent as glass, and that he could distinctly see the inverted
  face looking at him from the cabin beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>Pollock had a worse time almost on the steamer than he had at Sulyma. All
  day he had to control himself in spite of his intense perception of the
  imminent presence of that horrible head that was overshadowing his mind. At
  night his old nightmare returned, until, with a violent effort, he would
  force himself awake, rigid with the horror of it, and with the ghost of a
  hoarse scream in his throat.</p>

  <p>He left the actual head behind at Bathurst, where he changed ship for
  Teneriffe, but not his dreams nor the dull ache in his bones. At Teneriffe,
  Pollock transferred to a Cape liner, but the head followed him. He gambled,
  he tried chess, he even read books, but he knew the danger of drink. Yet
  whenever a round black shadow, a round black object came into his range,
  there he looked for the head, and&mdash;saw it. He knew clearly enough that
  his imagination was growing traitor to him, and yet at times it seemed the
  ship he sailed in, his fellow-passengers, the sailors, the wide sea, was all
  part of a filmy phantasmagoria that hung, scarcely veiling it, between him
  and a horrible real world. Then the Porroh man, thrusting his diabolical face
  through that curtain, was the one real and undeniable thing. At that he would
  get up and touch things, taste something, gnaw something, burn his hand with
  a match, or run a needle into himself.</p>

  <p>So, struggling grimly and silently with his excited imagination, Pollock
  reached England. He landed at Southampton, and went on straight from Waterloo
  to his banker's in Cornhill in a cab. There he transacted some business with
  the manager in a private room, and all the while the head hung like an
  ornament under the black marble mantel and dripped upon the fender. He could
  hear the drops fall, and see the red on the fender.</p>

  <p>"A pretty fern," said the manager, following his eyes. "But it makes the
  fender rusty."</p>

  <p>"Very," said Pollock; "a very pretty fern. And that reminds me. Can you
  recommend me a physician for mind troubles? I've got a little&mdash;what is
  it&mdash;? Hallucination."</p>

  <p>The head laughed savagely, wildly. Pollock was surprised the manager did
  not notice it. But the manager only stared at his face.</p>

  <p>With the address of a doctor, Pollock presently emerged in Cornhill. There
  was no cab in sight, and so he went on down to the western end of the street,
  and essayed the crossing opposite the Mansion House. The crossing is hardly
  easy even for the expert Londoner; cabs, vans, carriages, mail-carts,
  omnibuses go by in one incessant stream; to anyone fresh from the malarious
  solitudes of Sierra Leone it is a boiling, maddening confusion. But when an
  inverted head suddenly comes bouncing, like an indiarubber ball, between your
  legs, leaving distinct smears of blood every time it touches the ground, you
  can scarcely hope to avoid an accident. Pollock lifted his feet convulsively
  to avoid it, and then kicked at the thing furiously. Then something hit him
  violently in the back, and a hot pain ran up his arm.</p>

  <p>He had been hit by the pole of an omnibus, and three of the fingers of his
  left hand smashed by the hoof of one of the horses&mdash;the very fingers, as
  it happened, that he shot from the Porroh man. They pulled him out from
  between the horse's legs, and found the address of the physician, in his
  crushed hand.</p>

  <p>For a couple of days Pollock's sensations were full of the sweet, pungent
  smell of chloroform, of painful operations that caused him no pain, of lying
  still and being given food and drink. Then he had a slight fever, and was
  very thirsty, and his old nightmare came back. It was only when it returned
  that he noticed it had left him for a day.</p>

  <p>"If my skull had been smashed instead of my fingers, it might have gone
  altogether," said Pollock, staring thoughtfully at the dark cushion that had
  taken on for the time the shape of the head.</p>

  <p>Pollock at the first opportunity told the physician of his mind trouble.
  He knew clearly that he must go mad unless something should intervene to save
  him. He explained that he had witnessed a decapitation in Dahomey, and was
  haunted by one of the heads. Naturally, he did not care to state the actual
  facts. The physician looked grave.</p>

  <p>Presently he spoke hesitatingly. "As a child, did you get very much
  religious training?"</p>

  <p>"Very little," said Pollock.</p>

  <p>A shade passed over the physician's face. "I don't know if you have heard
  of the miraculous cures&mdash;it may be, of course, they are not miraculous
  &mdash;at Lourdes."</p>

  <p>"Faith-healing will hardly suit me, I am afraid," said Pollock, with his
  eye on the dark cushion.</p>

  <p>The head distorted its scarred features in an abominable grimace. The
  physician went upon a new track. "It's all imagination," he said, speaking
  with sudden briskness. "A fair case for faith-healing, anyhow. Your nervous
  system has run down, you're in that twilight state of health when the bogles
  come easiest. The strong impression was too much for you. I must make you up
  a little mixture that will strengthen your nervous system&mdash;especially
  your brain. And you must take exercise."</p>

  <p>"I'm no good for faith-healing," said Pollock.</p>

  <p>"And therefore we must restore tone. Go in search of stimulating air
  &mdash;Scotland, Norway, the Alps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jericho, if you like," said Pollock&mdash;"where Naaman went."</p>

  <p>However, so soon as his fingers would let him, Pollock made a gallant
  attempt to follow out the doctor's suggestion. It was now November. He tried
  football, but to Pollock the game consisted in kicking a furious inverted
  head about a field. He was no good at the game. He kicked blindly, with a
  kind of horror, and when they put him back into goal, and the ball came
  swooping down upon him, he suddenly yelled and got out of its way. The
  discreditable stories that had driven him from England to wander in the
  tropics shut him off from any but men's society, and now his increasingly
  strange behaviour made even his man friends avoid him. The thing was no
  longer a thing of the eye merely; it gibbered at him, spoke to him. A
  horrible fear came upon him that presently, when he took hold of the
  apparition, it would no longer become some mere article of furniture, but
  would feel like a real dissevered head. Alone, he would curse at the thing,
  defy it, entreat it; once or twice, in spite of his grim self-control, he
  addressed it in the presence of others. He felt the growing suspicion in the
  eyes of the people that watched him&mdash;his landlady, the servant, his
  man.</p>

  <p>One day early in December his cousin Arnold&mdash;his next of kin
  &mdash;came to see him and draw him out, and watch his sunken yellow face
  with narrow eager eyes. And it seemed to Pollock that the hat his cousin
  carried in his hand was no hat at all, but a Gorgon head that glared at him
  upside down, and fought with its eyes against his reason. However, he was
  still resolute to see the matter out. He got a bicycle, and, riding over the
  frosty road from Wandsworth to Kingston, found the thing rolling along at his
  side, and leaving a dark trail behind it. He set his teeth and rode faster.
  Then suddenly, as he came down the hill towards Richmond Park, the apparition
  rolled in front of him and under his wheel, so quickly that he had no time
  for thought, and, turning quickly to avoid it, was flung violently against a
  heap of stones and broke his left wrist.</p>

  <p>The end came on Christmas morning. All night he had been in a fever, the
  bandages encircling his wrist like a band of fire, his dreams more vivid and
  terrible than ever. In the cold, colourless, uncertain light that came before
  the sunrise, he sat up in his bed, and saw the head upon the bracket in the
  place of the bronze jar that had stood there overnight.</p>

  <p>"I know that is a bronze jar," he said, with a chill doubt at his heart.
  Presently the doubt was irresistible. He got out of bed slowly, shivering,
  and advanced to the jar with his hand raised. Surely he would see now his
  imagination had deceived him, recognise the distinctive sheen of bronze. At
  last, after an age of hesitation, his fingers came down on the patterned
  cheek of the head. He withdrew them spasmodically. The last stage was
  reached. His sense of touch had betrayed him.</p>

  <p>Trembling, stumbling against the bed, kicking against his shoes with his
  bare feet, a dark confusion eddying round him, he groped his way to the
  dressing-table, took his razor from the drawer, and sat down on the bed with
  this in his hand. In the looking-glass he saw his own face, colourless,
  haggard, full of the ultimate bitterness of despair.</p>

  <p>He beheld in swift succession the incidents in the brief tale of his
  experience. His wretched home, his still more wretched schooldays, the years
  of vicious life he had led since then, one act of selfish dishonour leading
  to another; it was all clear and pitiless now, all its squalid folly, in the
  cold light of the dawn. He came to the hut, to the fight with the Porroh man,
  to the retreat down the river to Sulyma, to the Mendi assassin and his red
  parcel, to his frantic endeavours to destroy the head, to the growth of his
  hallucination. It was a hallucination! He knew it was. A hallucination
  merely. For a moment he snatched at hope. He looked away from the glass, and
  on the bracket, the inverted head grinned and grimaced at him... With the
  stiff fingers of his bandaged hand he felt at his neck for the throb of his
  arteries. The morning was very cold, the steel blade felt like ice.</p>

     name="story22">THE OBLITERATED MAN</a></h2>

  <h3>First published as "The Sad Story Of A Dramatic Critic" in <i>The New
  Budget</i>, August 15, 1895</h3>

  <p>I was&mdash;you shall hear immediately why I am not now&mdash;Egbert
  Craddock Cummins. The name remains. I am still (Heaven help me!) Dramatic
  Critic to the 'Fiery Cross'. What I shall be in a little while I do not know.
  I write in great trouble and confusion of mind. I will do what I can to make
  myself clear in the face of terrible difficulties. You must bear with me a
  little. When a man is rapidly losing his own identity, he naturally finds a
  difficulty in expressing himself. I will make it perfectly plain in a minute,
  when once I get my grip upon the story. Let me see&mdash;where am I? I wish I
  knew. Ah, I have it! Dead self! Egbert Craddock Cummins!</p>

  <p>In the past I should have disliked writing anything quite so full of "I"
  as this story must be. It is full of "I's" before and behind, like the beast
  in Revelation&mdash;the one with a head like a calf, I am afraid. But my
  tastes have changed since I became a Dramatic Critic and studied the
  masters&mdash;G.R.S., G.B.S., G.A.S., and others. Everything has changed
  since then. At least the story is about myself&mdash;so that there is some
  excuse for me. And it is really not egotism, because as I say, since those
  days my identity has undergone an entire alteration.</p>

  <p>That past...! I was&mdash;in those days&mdash;rather a nice fellow, rather
  shy&mdash;taste for grey in my clothes, weedy little moustache, face
  "interesting," slight stutter which I had caught in early life from a
  schoolfellow. Engaged to a very nice girl, named Delia. Fairly new, she was
  &mdash;cigarettes&mdash;liked me because I was human and original. Considered
  I was like Lamb&mdash;on the strength of the stutter, I believe. Father, an
  eminent authority on postage stamps. She read a great deal in the British
  Museum. (A perfect pairing ground for literary people, that British
  Museum&mdash;you should read George Egerton and Justin Huntly M'Carthy and
  Gissing and the rest of them.) We loved in our intellectual way, and shared
  the brightest hopes. (All gone now.) And her father liked me because I seemed
  honestly eager to hear about stamps. She had no mother. Indeed, I had the
  happiest prospects a young man could have. I never went to theatres in those
  days. My Aunt Charlotte before she died had told me not to.</p>

  <p>Then Barnaby, the editor of the 'Fiery Cross', made me&mdash;in spite of
  my spasmodic efforts to escape&mdash;Dramatic Critic. He is a fine, healthy
  man, Barnaby, with an enormous head of frizzy black hair and a convincing
  manner, and he caught me on the staircase going to see Wembly. He had been
  dining, and was more than usually buoyant. "Hullo, Cummins!" he said. "The
  very man I want!" He caught me by the shoulder or collar or something, ran me
  up the little passage, and flung me over the waste-paper basket into the
  armchair in his office. "Pray be seated," he said, as he did so. Then he ran
  across the room and came back with some pink and yellow tickets and pushed
  them into my hand. "Opera Comique," he said, "Thursday; Friday, the Surrey;
  Saturday, the Frivolity. That's all, I think."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" I began.</p>

  <p>"Glad you're free," he said, snatching some proofs off the desk and
  beginning to read.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand," I said.</p>

  <p>"Eigh?" he said, at the top of his voice, as though he thought I had gone,
  and was startled at my remark.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to criticise these plays?"</p>

  <p>"Do something with 'em... Did you think it was a treat?"</p>

  <p>"But I can't."</p>

  <p>"Did you call me a fool?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I've never been to a theatre in my life."</p>

  <p>"Virgin soil."</p>

  <p>"But I don't know anything about it, you know."</p>

  <p>"That's just it. New view. No habits. No cliches in stock. Ours is a live
  paper, not a bag of tricks. None of your clockwork professional journalism in
  this office. And I can rely on your integrity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I've conscientious scruples&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He caught me up suddenly and put me outside his door. "Go and talk to
  Wembly about that," he said. "He'll explain."</p>

  <p>As I stood perplexed, he opened the door again, said, "I forgot this,"
  thrust a fourth ticket into my hand (it was for that night&mdash;in twenty
  minutes' time) and slammed the door upon me. His expression was quite calm,
  but I caught his eye.</p>

  <p>I hate arguments. I decided that I would take his hint and become (to my
  own destruction) a Dramatic Critic. I walked slowly down the passage to
  Wembly. That Barnaby has a remarkably persuasive way. He has made few
  suggestions during our very pleasant intercourse of four years that he has
  not ultimately won me round to adopting. It may be, of course, that I am of a
  yielding disposition; certainly I am too apt to take my colour from my
  circumstances. It is, indeed, to my unfortunate susceptibility to vivid
  impressions that all my misfortunes are due. I have already alluded to the
  slight stammer I had acquired from a schoolfellow in my youth. However, this
  is a digression... I went home in a cab to dress.</p>

  <p>I will not trouble the reader with my thoughts about the first-night
  audience, strange assembly as it is&mdash;, those I reserve for my Memoirs,
  nor the humiliating story of how I got lost during the entr'acte in a lot of
  red plush passages, and saw the third act from the gallery. The only point
  upon which I wish to lay stress was the remarkable effect of the acting upon
  me. You must remember I had lived a quite and retired life, and had never
  been to the theatre before, and that I am extremely sensitive to vivid
  impressions. At the risk of repetition I must insist upon these points.</p>

  <p>The first effect was a profound amazement, not untinctured by alarm. The
  phenomenal unnaturalness of acting is a thing discounted in the minds of most
  people by early visits to the theatre. They get used to the fantastic
  gestures, the flamboyant emotions, the weird mouthings, melodious snortings,
  agonising yelps, lip-gnawings, glaring horrors, and other emotional symbolism
  of the stage. It becomes at least a mere deaf-and-dumb language to them,
  which they read intelligently pari passu with the hearing of the dialogue.
  But all this was new to me. The thing was called a modern comedy, the people
  were supposed to be English and were dressed like fashionable Americans of
  the current epoch, and I fell into the natural error of supposing that the
  actors were trying to represent human beings. I looked round on my
  first-night audience with a kind of wonder, discovered&mdash;as all new
  Dramatic Critics do&mdash;that it rested with me to reform the Drama, and
  after a supper choked with emotion, went off to the office to write a column,
  piebald with "new paragraphs" (as all my stuff is&mdash;it fills out so) and
  purple with indignation. Barnaby was delighted.</p>

  <p>But I could not sleep that night. I dreamt of actors&mdash;actors glaring,
  actors smiting their chests, actors flinging out a handful of extended
  fingers, actors smiling bitterly, laughing despairingly, falling hopelessly,
  dying idiotically. I got up at eleven with a slight headache, read my notice
  in the 'Fiery Cross', breakfasted, and went back to my room to shave. (It's
  my habit to do so.) Then an odd thing happened. I could not find my razor.
  Suddenly it occurred to me that I had not unpacked it the day before.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said I, in front of the looking-glass. Then "Hullo!"</p>

  <p>Quite involuntarily, when I had thought of my portmanteau, I had flung up
  the left arm (fingers fully extended) and clutched at my diaphragm with my
  right hand. I am an acutely self-conscious man at all times. The gesture
  struck me as absolutely novel for me. I repeated it, for my own satisfaction.
  "Odd!" Then (rather puzzled) I turned to my portmanteau.</p>

  <p>After shaving, my mind reverted to the acting I had seen, and I
  entertained myself before the cheval glass with some imitations of Jafferay's
  more exaggerated gestures. "Really, one might think it a disease." I said
  &mdash;, "Stage-Walkitis!" (There's many a truth spoken in jest.) Then, if I
  remember rightly, I went off to see Wembly, and afterwards lunched at the
  British Museum with Delia. We actually spoke about our prospects, in the
  light of my new appointment.</p>

  <p>But that appointment was the beginning of my downfall. From that day I
  necessarily became a persistent theatre-goer, and almost insensibly I began
  to change. The next thing I noticed after the gesture about the razor, was to
  catch myself bowing ineffably when I met Delia, and stooping in an old-
  fashioned, courtly way over her hand. Directly I caught myself, I
  straightened myself up and became very uncomfortable. I remember she looked
  at me curiously. Then, in the office, I found myself doing "nervous
  business," fingers on teeth, when Barnaby asked me a question I could not
  very well answer. Then, in some trifling difference with Delia, I clasped my
  hand to my brow. And I pranced through my social transactions at times
  singularly like an actor! I tried not to&mdash;no one could be more keenly
  alive to the arrant absurdity of the histrionic bearing. And I did!</p>

  <p>It began to dawn on me what it all meant. The acting, I saw, was too much
  for my delicately-strung nervous system. I have always, I know, been too
  amenable to the suggestions of my circumstances. Night after night of
  concentrated attention to the conventional attitudes and intonation of the
  English stage was gradually affecting my speech and carriage. I was giving
  way to the infection of sympathetic imitation. Night after night my plastic
  nervous system took the print of some new amazing gesture, some new emotional
  exaggeration&mdash;and retained it. A kind of theatrical veneer threatened to
  plate over and obliterate my private individuality altogether. I saw myself
  in a kind of vision. Sitting by myself one night, my new self seemed to me to
  glide, posing and gesticulating, across the room. He clutched his throat, he
  opened his fingers, he opened his legs in walking like a high-class
  marionette. He went from attitude to attitude. He might have been clockwork.
  Directly after this I made an ineffectual attempt to resign my theatrical
  work. But Barnaby persisted in talking about the Polywhiddle Divorce all the
  time I was with him, and I could get no opportunity of saying what I
  wished.</p>

  <p>And then Delia's manner began to change towards me. The ease of our
  intercourse vanished. I felt she was learning to dislike me. I grinned, and
  capered, and scowled, and posed at her in a thousand ways, and
  knew&mdash;with what a voiceless agony&mdash;! That I did it all the time. I
  tried to resign again, and Barnaby talked about "X" and "Z" and "Y" in the
  New Review, and gave me a strong cigar to smoke, and so routed me. And then I
  walked up the Assyrian Gallery in the manner of Irving to meet Delia, and so
  precipitated the crisis.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;! Dear!" I said, with more sprightliness and emotion in my voice
  than had ever been in all my life before I became (to my own undoing) a
  Dramatic Critic.</p>

  <p>She held out her hand rather coldly, scrutinising my face as she did so. I
  prepared, with a new-won grace, to walk by her side.</p>

  <p>"Egbert," she said, standing still, and thought. Then she looked at
  me.</p>

  <p>I said nothing. I felt what was coming. I tried to be the old Egbert
  Craddock Cummins of shambling gait and stammering sincerity, whom she loved,
  but I felt even as I did so that I was a new thing, a thing of surging
  emotions and mysterious fixity&mdash;like no human being that ever lived,
  except upon the stage. "Egbert," she said, "you are not yourself."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Involuntarily I clutched my diaphragm and averted my head (as is the
  way with them).</p>

  <p>"There!" she said.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" I said, whispering in vocal italics&mdash;you know how
  they do it&mdash;turning on her, perplexity on face, right hand down, left on
  brow. I knew quite well what she meant. I knew quite well the dramatic
  unreality of my behaviour. But I struggled against it in vain. "What do you
  mean?" I said, and in a kind of hoarse whisper, "I don't understand!"</p>

  <p>She really looked as though she disliked me. "What do you keep on posing
  for?" she said. "I don't like it. You didn't used to."</p>

  <p>"Didn't used to!" I said slowly, repeating this twice. I glared up and
  down the gallery, with short, sharp glances. "We are alone," I said swiftly.
  "Listen!" I poked my forefinger towards her, and glared at her. "I'm under a
  curse."</p>

  <p>I saw her hands tighten upon her sunshade. "You are under some bad
  influence or other," said Delia. "You should give it up. I never knew anyone
  change as you have done."</p>

  <p>"Delia!" I said, lapsing into the pathetic. "Pity me. Augh! Delia! Pit
  &mdash;y me!"</p>

  <p>She eyed me critically. "Why you keep playing the fool like this I don't
  know," she said. "Anyhow, I really cannot go about with a man who behaves as
  you do. You made us both ridiculous on Wednesday. Frankly, I dislike you, as
  you are now. I met you here to tell you so&mdash;as it's about the only place
  where we can be sure of being alone together&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Delia!" said I, with intensity, knuckles of clenched hands white. "You
  don't mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do," said Delia. "A woman's lot is sad enough at the best of times. But
  with you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I clapped my hand on my brow.</p>

  <p>"So, good-bye," said Delia, without emotion.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Delia!" I said. "Not this?"</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Mr. Cummins," she said.</p>

  <p>By a violent effort I controlled myself and touched her hand. I tried to
  say some word of explanation to her. She looked into my working face and
  winced. "I must do it," she said hopelessly. Then she turned from me and
  began walking rapidly down the gallery.</p>

  <p>Heavens! How the human agony cried within me! I loved Delia. But nothing
  found expression&mdash;I was already too deeply crusted with my acquired
  self.</p>

  <p>"Good-baye!" I said at last, watching her retreating figure. How I hated
  myself for doing it! After she had vanished, I repeated in a dreamy way,
  "Good-baye!" looking hopelessly round me. Then, with a kind of heart-broken
  cry, I shook my clenched fists in the air, staggered to the pedestal of a
  winged figure, buried my face in my arms, and made my shoulders heave.
  Something within me said "Ass!" as I did so. (I had the greatest difficulty
  in persuading the Museum policeman, who was attracted by my cry of agony,
  that I was not intoxicated, but merely suffering from a transient
  indisposition.)</p>

  <p>But even this great sorrow has not availed to save me from my fate. I see
  it, everyone sees it; I grow more "theatrical" every day. And no one could be
  more painfully aware of the pungent silliness of theatrical ways. The quite,
  nervous, but pleasing, E.C. Cummins vanishes. I cannot save him. I am driven
  like a dead leaf before the winds of March. My tailor even enters into the
  spirit of my disorder. He has a peculiar sense of what is fitting. I tried to
  get a dull grey suit from him this spring, and he foisted a brilliant blue
  upon me, and I see he has put braid down the sides of my new dress trousers.
  My hairdresser insists upon giving me a "wave."</p>

  <p>I am beginning to associate with actors. I detest them, but it is only in
  their company that I feel I am not glaringly conspicuous. Their talk infects
  me. I notice a growing tendency to dramatic brevity, to dashes and pauses in
  my style, to a punctuation of bows and attitudes. Barnaby has remarked it
  too. I offended Wembly by calling him "Dear Boy" yesterday. I dread the end,
  but cannot escape from it.</p>

  <p>The fact is, I am being obliterated. Living a grey, retired life all my
  youth, I came to the theatre a delicate sketch of a man, a thing of tints and
  faint lines. Their gorgeous colouring has effaced me altogether. People
  forget how much mode of expression, method of movement, are a matter of
  contagion. I have heard of stage-struck people before, and thought it a
  figure of speech. I spoke of it jestingly, as a disease. It is no jest. It is
  a disease. And I have got it bad! Deep down within me I protest against the
  wrong done to my personality&mdash;unavailingly. For three hours or more a
  week I have to go and concentrate my attention on some fresh play, and the
  suggestions of the drama strengthen their awful hold upon me. My manners grow
  so flamboyant, my passions so professional, that I doubt, as I said at the
  outset, whether it is really myself that behaves in such a manner. I feel
  merely the core of this dramatic casing, that grows thicker and presses upon
  me&mdash;me and mine. I feel like King John's abbot in his cope of lead.</p>

  <p>I doubt, indeed, whether I should not abandon the struggle altogether
  &mdash;leave this sad world of ordinary life for which I am so ill-fitted,
  abandon the name of Cummins for some professional pseudonym, complete my
  self-effacement, and&mdash;a thing of tricks and tatters, of posing and
  pretence&mdash;go upon the stage. It seems my only resort&mdash;" to hold
  mirror up to Nature." For in the ordinary life, I will confess, no one now
  seems to regard me as both sane and sober. Only upon the stage, I feel
  convinced, will people take me seriously. That will be the end of it. I know
  that will be the end of it. And yet... I will frankly confess... all that
  marks off your actor from your common man... I detest. I am still largely of
  my Aunt Charlotte's opinion, that playacting is unworthy of a pure-minded
  man's attention, much more participation. Even now I would resign my dramatic
  criticism and try a rest. Only I can't get hold of Barnaby. Letters of
  resignation he never notices. He says it is against the etiquette of
  journalism to write to your Editor. And when I go to see him, he gives me
  another big cigar and some strong whisky and soda, and then something always
  turns up to prevent my explanation.</p>

     name="story23">THE CONE</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Unicorn</i> magazine, September 18, 1895</h3>

  <p>The night was hot and overcast, the sky red-rimmed with the lingering
  sunset of midsummer. They sat at the open window, trying to fancy the air was
  fresher there. The trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff and dark;
  beyond in the roadway a gas-lamp burnt, bright orange against the hazy blue
  of the evening. Farther were the three lights of the railway signal against
  the lowering sky. The man and woman spoke to one another in low tones.</p>

  <p>"He does not suspect?" said the man, a little nervously.</p>

  <p>"Not he," she said peevishly, as though that too irritated her. "He thinks
  of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel. He has no imagination, no
  poetry."</p>

  <p>"None of these men of iron have," he said sententiously. "They have no
  hearts."</p>

  <p>"<i>He</i> has not," she said. She turned her discontented face towards
  the window. The distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and grew
  in volume; the house quivered; one heard the metallic rattle of the tender.
  As the train passed, there was a glare of light above the cutting and a
  driving tumult of smoke; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight black
  oblongs&mdash;eight trucks&mdash;passed across the dim grey of the
  embankment, and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the throat of the
  tunnel, which, with the last, seemed to swallow down train, smoke, and sound
  in one abrupt gulp.</p>

  <p>"This country was all fresh and beautiful once," he said; "and now
  &mdash;it is Gehenna. Down that way&mdash;nothing but pot-banks and chimneys
  belching fire and dust into the face of heaven...But what does it matter? An
  end comes, an end to all this cruelty...<i>To-morrow."</i> He spoke the last
  word in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"<i>To-morrow,"</i> she said, speaking in a whisper too, and still staring
  out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Dear!" he said, putting his hand on hers.</p>

  <p>She turned with a start, and their eyes searched one another's. Hers
  softened to his gaze. "My dear one!" she said, and then: "It seems so strange
  &mdash;that you should have come into my life like this&mdash;to open&mdash;"
  She paused.</p>

  <p>"To open?" he said.</p>

  <p>"All this wonderful world"&mdash;she hesitated, and spoke still more
  softly&mdash;"this world of <i>love</i> to me."</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the door clicked and closed. They turned their heads, and he
  started violently back. In the shadow of the room stood a great shadowy
  figure-silent. They saw the face dimly in the half-light, with unexpressive
  dark patches under the pent-house brows. Every muscle in Raut's body suddenly
  became tense. When could the door have opened? What had he heard? Had he
  heard all? What had he seen? A tumult of questions.</p>

  <p>The new-comer's voice came at last, after a pause that seemed
  interminable. "Well?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid I had missed you, Horrocks," said the man at the window,
  gripping the window-ledge with his hand. His voice was unsteady.</p>

  <p>The clumsy figure of Horrocks came forward out of the shadow. He made no
  answer to Raut's remark. For a moment he stood above them.</p>

  <p>The woman's heart was cold within her. "I told Mr. Raut it was just
  possible you might come back," she said in a voice that never quivered.</p>

  <p>Horrocks, still silent, sat down abruptly in the chair by her little work-
  table. His big hands were clenched; one saw now the fire of his eyes under
  the shadow of his brows. He was trying to get his breath. His eyes went from
  the woman he had trusted to the friend he had trusted, and then back to the
  woman.</p>

  <p>By this time and for the moment all three half understood one another. Yet
  none dared say a word to ease the pent-up things that choked them.</p>

  <p>It was the husband's voice that broke the silence at last.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to see me?" he said to Raut.</p>

  <p>Raut started as he spoke. "I came to see you," he said, resolved to lie to
  the last.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Horrocks.</p>

  <p>"You promised," said Raut, "to show me some fine effects of moonlight and
  smoke."</p>

  <p>"I promised to show you some fine effects of moonlight and smoke,"
  repeated Horrocks in a colourless voice.</p>

  <p>"And I thought I might catch you to-night before you went down to the
  works," proceeded Raut, "and come with you."</p>

  <p>There was another pause. Did the man mean to take the thing coolly? Did
  he, after all, know? How long had he been in the room? Yet even at the moment
  when they heard the door, their attitudes...Horrocks glanced at the profile
  of the woman, shadowy pallid in the half-light. Then he glanced at Raut, and
  seemed to recover himself suddenly. "Of course," he said, "I promised to show
  you the works under their proper dramatic conditions. It's odd how I could
  have forgotten."</p>

  <p>"If I am troubling you&mdash;" began Raut.</p>

  <p>Horrocks started again. A new light had suddenly come into the sultry
  gloom of his eyes. "Not in the least." he said.</p>

  <p>"Have you been telling Mr. Raut of all these contrasts of flame and shadow
  you think so splendid?" said the woman, turning now to her husband for the
  first time, her confidence creeping back again, her voice just one half-note
  too high&mdash;"that dreadful theory of yours that machinery is beautiful,
  and everything else in the world ugly. I thought he would not spare you, Mr.
  Raut. It's his great theory, his one discovery in art."</p>

  <p>"I am slow to make discoveries," said Horrocks grimly, damping her
  suddenly. "But what I discover ..." He stopped.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Nothing;" and suddenly he rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I promised to show you the works," he said to Raut, and put his big,
  clumsy hand on his friend's shoulder. "And you are ready to go?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Raut, and stood up also.</p>

  <p>There was another pause. Each of them peered through the indistinctness of
  the dusk at the other two.</p>

  <p>Horrocks' hand still rested on Raut's shoulder. Raut half fancied still
  that the incident was trivial after all. But Mrs. Horrocks knew her husband
  better, knew that grim quiet in his voice, and the confusion in her mind took
  a vague shape of physical evil. "Very well," said Horrocks, and, dropping his
  hand, turned towards the door.</p>

  <p>"My hat?" Raut looked round in the half-light.</p>

  <p>"That's my work-basket," said Mrs. Horrocks with a gust of hysterical
  laughter. Their hands came together on the back of the chair. "Here it is!"
  he said. She had an impulse to warn him in an undertone, but she could not
  frame a word. "Don't go!" and "Beware of him!" struggled in her mind, and the
  swift moment passed.</p>

  <p>"Got it?" said Horrocks, standing with the door half open.</p>

  <p>Raut stepped towards him. "Better say goodbye to Mrs. Horrocks," said the
  ironmaster, even more grimly quiet in his tone than before.</p>

  <p>Raut started and turned. "Good-evening, Mrs. Horrocks," he said, and their
  hands touched.</p>

  <p>Horrocks held the door open with a ceremonial politeness unusual in him
  towards men. Raut went out, and then, after a wordless look at her, her
  husband followed. She stood motionless while Raut's light footfall and her
  husband's heavy tread, like bass and treble, passed down the passage
  together. The front door slammed heavily. She went to the window, moving
  slowly, and stood watching, leaning forward. The two men appeared for a
  moment at the gateway in the road, passed under the street lamp, and were
  hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery. The lamplight fell for a moment
  on their faces, showing only unmeaning pale patches, telling nothing of what
  she still feared, and doubted, and craved vainly to know. Then she sank down
  into a crouching attitude in the big arm-chair, her eyes-wide open and
  staring out at the red lights from the furnaces that flickered in the sky. An
  hour after she was still there, her attitude scarcely changed.</p>

  <p>The oppressive stillness of the evening weighed heavily upon Raut. They
  went side by side down the road in silence, and in silence turned into the
  cinder-made byway that presently opened out the prospect of the valley.</p>

  <p>A blue haze, half dust, half mist, touched the long valley with mystery.
  Beyond were Hanley and Etruria, grey and dark masses, outlined thinly by the
  rare golden dots of the street lamps, and here and there a gas-lit window, or
  the yellow glare of some late-working factory or crowded public-house. Out of
  the masses, clear and slender against the evening sky, rose a multitude of
  tall chimneys, many of them reeking, a few smokeless during a season of
  "play." Here and there a pallid patch and ghostly stunted beehive shapes
  showed the position of a pot-bank or a wheel, black and sharp against the hot
  lower sky, marked some colliery where they raise the iridescent coal of the
  place. Nearer at hand was the broad stretch of railway, and half-invisible
  trains shunted&mdash;a steady puffing and rumbling, with every run a ringing
  concussion and a rhymthic series of impacts, and a passage of intermittent
  puffs of white steam across the further view. And to the left, between the
  railway and the dark mass of the low hill beyond, dominating the whole view,
  colossal, inky-black, and crowned with smoke and fitful flames, stood the
  great cylinders of the Jeddah Company Blast Furnaces, the central edifices of
  the big ironworks of which Horrocks was the manager. They stood heavy and
  threatening, full of an incessant turmoil of flames and seething molten iron,
  and about the feet of them rattled the rolling-mills, and the steam-hammer
  beat heavily and splashed the white iron sparks hither and thither. Even as
  they looked, a truckful of fuel was shot into one of the giants, and the red
  flames gleamed out, and a confusion of smoke and black dust came boiling
  upwards towards the sky.</p>

  <p>"Certainly you get some colour with your furnaces," said Raut, breaking a
  silence that had become apprehensive.</p>

  <p>Horrocks grunted. He stood with his hands in his pockets, frowning down at
  the dim steaming railway and the busy ironworks beyond, frowning as if he
  were thinking out some knotty problem.</p>

  <p>Raut glanced at him and away again. "At present your moonlight effect is
  hardly ripe," he continued, looking upward; "the moon is still smothered by
  the vestiges of daylight."</p>

  <p>Horrocks stared at him with the expression of a man who has suddenly
  awakened. "Vestiges of daylight?...Of course, of course." He too looked up at
  the moon, pale still in the midsummer sky. "Come along," he said suddenly,
  and gripping Raut's arm in his hand, made a move towards the path that
  dropped from them to the railway.</p>

  <p>Raut hung back. Their eyes met and saw a thousand things in a moment that
  their lips came near to say. Horrocks's hand tightened and then relaxed. He
  let go, and before Raut was aware of it, they were arm in arm, and walking,
  one unwillingly enough, down the path.</p>

  <p>"You see the fine effect of the railway signals towards Burslem," said
  Horrocks, suddenly breaking into loquacity, striding fast and tightening the
  grip of his elbow the while&mdash;"little green lights and red and white
  lights, all against the haze. You have an eye for effect, Raut. It's fine.
  And look at those furnaces of mine, how they rise upon us as we come down the
  hill. That to the right is my pet&mdash;seventy feet of him. I packed him
  myself, and he's boiled away cheerfully with iron in his guts for five long
  years. I've a particular fancy for <i>him</i>. That line of red there&mdash;a
  lovely bit of warm orange you'd call it, Raut&mdash;that's the puddlers'
  furnaces, and there, in the hot light, three black figures&mdash;did you see
  the white splash of the steam-hammer then?&mdash;that's the rolling mills.
  Come along! Clang, clatter, how it goes rattling across the floor! Sheet tin,
  Raut,&mdash;amazing stuff. Glass mirrors are not in it when that stuff comes
  from the mill. And, squelch! there goes the hammer again. Come along!"</p>

  <p>He had to stop talking to catch at his breath. His arm twisted into Raut's
  with benumbing tightness. He had come striding down the black path towards
  the railway as though he was possessed. Raut had not spoken a word, had
  simply hung back against Horrocks's pull with all his strength.</p>

  <p>"I say," he said now, laughing nervously, but with an undertone of snarl
  in his voice, "why on earth are you nipping my arm off, Horrocks, and
  dragging me along like this?"</p>

  <p>At length Horrocks released him. His manner changed again. "Nipping your
  arm off?" he said. "Sorry. But it's you taught me the trick of walking in
  that friendly way."</p>

  <p>"You haven't learnt the refinements of it yet then," said Raut, laughing
  artificially again. "By Jove! I'm black and blue." Horrocks offered no
  apology. They stood now near the bottom of the hill, close to the fence that
  bordered the railway. The ironworks had grown larger and spread out with
  their approach. They looked up to the blast furnaces now instead of down; the
  further view of Etruria and Hanley had dropped out of sight with their
  descent. Before them, by the stile, rose a notice-board, bearing, still dimly
  visible, the words, "BEWARE OF THE TRAINS," half hidden by splashes of coaly
  mud.</p>

  <p>"Fine effects," said Horrocks, waving his arm. "Here comes a train. The
  puffs of smoke, the orange glare, the round eye of light in front of it, the
  melodious rattle. Fine effects! But these furnaces of mine used to be finer,
  before we shoved cones in their throats, and saved the gas."</p>

  <p>"How?" said Raut. "Cones?"</p>

  <p>"Cones, my man, cones. I'll show you one nearer. The flames used to flare
  out of the open throats, great&mdash;what is it?&mdash;pillars of cloud by
  day, red and black smoke, and pillars of fire by night. Now we run it off
  &mdash;in pipes, and burn it to heat the blast, and the top is shut by a
  cone. You'll be interested in that cone."</p>

  <p>"But every now and then," said Raut, "you get a burst of fire and smoke up
  there."</p>

  <p>"The cone's not fixed, it's hung by a chain from a lever, and balanced by
  an equipoise. You shall see it nearer. Else, of course, there'd be no way of
  getting fuel into the thing. Every now and then the cone dips, and out comes
  the flare."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Raut. He looked over his shoulder. "The moon gets brighter,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"Come along," said Horrocks abruptly, gripping his shoulder again, and
  moving him suddenly towards the railway crossing. And then came one of those
  swift incidents, vivid, but so rapid that they leave one doubtful and
  reeling. Half-way across, Horrocks's hand suddenly clenched upon him like a
  vice, and swung him backward and through a half-turn, so that he looked up
  the line. And there a chain of lamp-lit carriage windows telescoped swiftly
  as it came towards them, and the red and yellow lights of an engine grew
  larger and larger, rushing down upon them. As he grasped what this meant, he
  turned his face to Horrocks, and pushed with all his strength against the arm
  that held him back between the rails. The struggle did not last a moment.
  Just as certain as it was that Horrocks held him there, so certain was it
  that he had been violently lugged out of danger.</p>

  <p>"Out of the way," said Horrocks with a gasp, as the train came rattling
  by, and they stood panting by the gate into the ironworks.</p>

  <p>"I did not see it coming," said Raut, still, even in spite of his own
  apprehensions, trying to keep up an appearance of ordinary intercourse.</p>

  <p>Horrocks answered with a grunt. "The cone," he said, and then, as one who
  recovers himself, "I thought you did not hear."</p>

  <p>"I didn't," said Raut.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't have had you run over then for the world," said Horrocks.</p>

  <p>"For a moment I lost my nerve," said Raut.</p>

  <p>Horrocks stood for half a minute, then turned abruptly towards the
  ironworks again. "See how fine these great mounds of mine, these
  clinker-heaps, look in the night! That truck yonder, up above there! Up it
  goes, and out-tilts the slag. See the palpitating red stuff go sliding down
  the slope. As we get nearer, the heap rises up and cuts the blast furnaces.
  See the quiver up above the big one. Not that way! This way, between the
  heaps. That goes to the puddling furnaces, but I want to show you the canal
  first." He came and took Raut by the elbow, and so they went along side by
  side. Raut answered Horrocks vaguely. What, he asked himself, had really
  happened on the line? Was he deluding himself with his own fancies, or had
  Horrocks actually held him back in the way of the train? Had he just been
  within an ace of being murdered?</p>

  <p>Suppose this slouching, scowling monster <i>did</i> know anything? For a
  minute or two then Raut was really afraid for his life, but the mood passed
  as he reasoned with himself. After all, Horrocks might have heard nothing. At
  any rate, he had pulled him out of the way in time. His odd manner might be
  due to the mere vague jealousy he had shown once before. He was talking now
  of the ash-heaps and the canal. "Eigh?" said Horrocks.</p>

  <p>"What?" said Raut. "Rather! The haze in the moonlight. Fine!"</p>

  <p>"Our canal," said Horrocks, stopping suddenly. "Our canal by moonlight and
  firelight is immense. You've never seen it? Fancy that! You've spent too many
  of your evenings philandering up in Newcastle there. I tell you, for real
  florid quality&mdash;But you shall see. Boiling water..."</p>

  <p>As they came out of the labyrinth of clinker-heaps and mounds of coal and
  ore, the noises of the rolling-mill sprang upon them suddenly, loud, near,
  and distinct. Three shadowy workmen went by and touched their caps to
  Horrocks. Their faces were vague in the darkness. Raut felt a futile impulse
  to address them, and before he could frame his words they passed into the
  shadows. Horrocks pointed to the canal close before them now: a weird-looking
  place it seemed, in the blood-red reflections of the furnaces. The hot water
  that cooled the tuy&egrave;res came into it, some fifty yards up&mdash;a
  tumultuous, almost boiling affluent, and the steam rose up from the water in
  silent white wisps and streaks, wrapping damply about them, an incessant
  succession of ghosts coming up from the black and red eddies, a white
  uprising that made the head swim. The shining black tower of the larger
  blast-furnace rose overhead out of the mist, and its tumultuous riot filled
  their ears. Raut kept away from the edge of the water, and watched
  Horrocks.</p>

  <p>"Here it is red," said Horrocks, "blood-red vapour as red and hot as sin;
  but yonder there, where the moonlight falls on it, and it drives across the
  clinker-heaps, it is as white as death."</p>

  <p>Raut turned his head for a moment, and then came back hastily to his watch
  on Horrocks. "Come along to the rolling-mills," said Horrocks. The
  threatening hold was not so evident that time, and Raut felt a little
  reassured. But all the same, what on earth did Horrocks mean about "white as
  death" and "red as sin"? Coincidence, perhaps?</p>

  <p>They went and stood behind the puddlers for a little while, and then
  through the rolling-mills, where amidst an incessant din the deliberate
  steam-hammer beat the juice out of the succulent iron, and black, half-naked
  Titans rushed the plastic bars, like hot sealing-wax, between the wheels,
  "Come on," said Horrocks in Raut's ear; and they went and peeped through the
  little glass hole behind the tuy&egrave;res, and saw the tumbled fire
  writhing in the pit of the blast-furnace. It left one eye blinded for a
  while. Then, with green and blue patches dancing across the dark, they went
  to the lift by which the trucks of ore and fuel and lime were raised to the
  top of the big cylinder.</p>

  <p>And out upon the narrow rail that overhung the furnace Raut's doubts came
  upon him again. Was it wise to be here? If Horrocks did
  know&mdash;everything! Do what he would, he could not resist a violent
  trembling. Right under foot was a sheer depth of seventy feet. It was a
  dangerous place. They pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing that
  crowned the thing. The reek of the furnace, a sulphurous vapour streaked with
  pungent bitterness, seemed to make the distant hillside of Hanley quiver. The
  moon was riding out now from among a drift of clouds, half-way up the sky
  above the undulating wooded outlines of Newcastle. The steaming canal ran
  away from below them under an indistinct bridge, and vanished into the dim
  haze of the flat fields towards Burslem.</p>

  <p>"That's the cone I've been telling you of," shouted Horrocks; "and, below
  that, sixty feet of fire and molten metal, with the air of the blast frothing
  through it like gas in soda-water."</p>

  <p>Raut gripped the hand-rail tightly, and stared down at the cone. The heat
  was intense. The boiling of the iron and the tumult of the blast made a
  thunderous accompaniment to Horrocks's voice. But the thing had to be gone
  through now. Perhaps, after all...</p>

  <p>"In the middle," bawled Horrocks, "temperature near a thousand degrees. If
  <i>you</i> were dropped into it...flash into flame like a pinch of gunpowder
  in a candle. Put your hand out and feel the heat of his breath. Why, even up
  here I've seen the rain-water boiling off the trucks. And that cone there.
  It's a damned sight too hot for roasting cakes. The top side of it's three
  hundred degrees."</p>

  <p>"Three hundred degrees!" said Raut.</p>

  <p>"Three hundred centigrade, mind!" said Horrocks. "It will boil the blood
  out of you in no time."</p>

  <p>"Eigh?" said Raut, and turned.</p>

  <p>"Boil the blood out of you in...No, you don't!"</p>

  <p>"Let me go!" screamed Raut. "Let go my arm!"</p>

  <p>With one hand he clutched at the hand-rail, then with both. For a moment
  the two men stood swaying. Then suddenly, with a violent jerk, Horrocks had
  twisted him from his hold. He clutched at Horrocks and missed, his foot went
  back into empty air; in mid-air he twisted himself, and then cheek and
  shoulder and knee struck the hot cone together.</p>

  <p>He clutched the chain by which the cone hung, and the thing sank an
  infinitesimal amount as he struck it. A circle of glowing red appeared about
  him, and a tongue of flame, released from the chaos within, flickered up
  towards him. An intense pain assailed him at the knees, and he could smell
  the singeing of his hands. He raised himself to his feet, and tried to climb
  up the chain, and then something struck his head. Black and shining with the
  moonlight, the throat of the furnace rose about him.</p>

  <p>Horrocks, he saw, stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel on the
  rail. The gesticulating figure was bright and white in the moonlight, and
  shouting, "Fizzle, you fool! Fizzle, you hunter of women! You hot-blooded
  hound! Boil! boil! boil!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck, and flung it
  deliberately, lump after lump, at Raut.</p>

  <p>"Horrocks!" cried Raut. "Horrocks!"</p>

  <p>He clung, crying, to the chain, pulling himself up from the burning of the
  cone. Each missile Horrocks flung hit him. His clothes charred and glowed,
  and as he struggled the cone dropped, and a rush of hot, suffocating gas
  whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of flame.</p>

  <p>His human likeness departed from him. When the momentary red had passed,
  Horrocks saw a charred, blackened figure, its head streaked with blood, still
  clutching and fumbling with the chain, and writhing in agony&mdash;a cindery
  animal, an inhuman, monstrous creature that began a sobbing, intermittent
  shriek.</p>

  <p>Abruptly at the sight the ironmaster's anger passed. A deadly sickness
  came upon him. The heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting up to his
  nostrils. His sanity returned to him.</p>

  <p>"God have mercy upon me!" he cried. "O God! what have I done?"</p>

  <p>He knew the thing below him, save that it still moved and felt, was
  already a dead man&mdash;that the blood of the poor wretch must be boiling in
  his veins. An intense realisation of that agony came to his mind, and
  overcame every other feeling. For a moment he stood irresolute, and then,
  turning to the truck, he hastily tilted its contents upon the struggling
  thing that had once been a man. The mass fell with a thud, and went radiating
  over the cone. With the thud the shriek ended, and a boiling confusion of
  smoke, dust, and flame came rushing up towards him. As it passed, he saw the
  cone clear again.</p>

  <p>Then he staggered back, and stood trembling, clinging to the rail with
  both hands. His lips moved, but no words came to them.</p>

  <p>Down below was the sound of voices and running steps. The clangour of
  rolling in the shed ceased abruptly.</p>

     name="story24">THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Phil May's Annual</i>, December 1895</h3>

  <p>One saw Monson's Flying Machine from the windows of the trains passing
  either along the South-Western main line or along the line between Wimbledon
  and Worcester Park&mdash;to be more exact, one saw the huge scaffolding which
  limited the flight of the apparatus. They rose over the tree-tops, a massive
  alley of interlacing iron and timber, and an enormous web of ropes and
  tackle, extending the best part of two miles. From the Leatherhead branch
  this alley was foreshortened and in part hidden by hill with villas; but from
  the main line one had it in profile, a complex tangle of girders and curving
  bars, very impressive to the excursionists from Portsmouth and Southampton
  and the West. Monson had taken up the work where Maxim had left it, had gone
  on at first with an utter contempt for the journalistic wit and ignorance
  that had irritated and hampered his predecessor, and had spent (it was said)
  rather more than half his immense fortune upon his experiments. The results,
  to an impatient generation, seemed inconsiderable. When some five years had
  passed after the growth of the colossal iron groves at Worcester Park, and
  Monson still failed to put in a fluttering appearance over Trafalgar Square,
  even the Isle of Wight trippers felt their liberty to smile. And such
  intelligent people as did not consider Monson a fool stricken with the mania
  for invention, denounced him as being (for no particular reason) a
  self-advertising quack.</p>

  <p>Yet now and again a morning trainload of season-ticket holders would see a
  white monster rush headlong through the airy tracery of guides and bars, and
  hear the further stays, nettings and buffers snap, creak, and groan with the
  impact of the blow. Then there would be an efflorescence of black-set white-
  rimmed faces along the sides of the train, and the morning papers would be
  neglected for a vigorous discussion of the possibility of flying (in which
  nothing new was ever said by any chance), until the train reached Waterloo,
  and its cargo of season-ticket holders dispersed themselves over London. Or
  the fathers and mothers in some multitudinous train of weary excursionists
  returning exhausted from a day of rest by the sea, would find the dark
  fabric, standing out against the evening sky, useful in diverting some
  bilious child from its introspection, and be suddenly startled by the swift
  transit of a huge black flapping shape that strained upward against the
  guides. It was a great and forcible thing beyond dispute, and excellent for
  conversation; yet all the same, it was but flying in leading-strings, and
  most of those who witnessed it scarcely counted its flight as flying. More of
  a switchback it seemed to the run of the folk.</p>

  <p>Monson, I say, did not trouble himself very keenly about the opinions of
  the press at first. But possibly he, even had formed but a poor idea of the
  time it would take before the tactics of flying were mastered, the swift
  assured adjustment of the big soaring shape to every gust and chance movement
  of the air; nor had he clearly reckoned the money this prolonged struggle
  against gravitation would cost him. And he was not so pachydermatous as he
  seemed. Secretly he had his periodical bundles of cuttings sent him by
  Romeike, he had his periodical reminders from his banker; and if he did not
  mind the initial ridicule and scepticism, he felt the growing neglect as the
  months went by and the money dribbled away. Time was when Monson had sent the
  enterprising journalist, keen after readable matter, empty from his gates.
  But when the enterprising journalist ceased from troubling, Monson was
  anything but satisfied in his heart of hearts. Still day by day the work went
  on, and the multitudinous subtle difficulties of steering diminished in
  number. Day by day, too the money trickled away, until his balance was no
  longer a matter of hundreds of thousands, but of tens. And at last came an
  anniversary.</p>

  <p>Monson, sitting in the little drawing-shed, suddenly noticed the date on
  Woodhouse's calendar.</p>

  <p>"It was five years ago to-day that we began," he said to Woodhouse
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Is it?" said Woodhouse.</p>

  <p>"It's the alterations play the devil with us," said Monson, biting a
  paper-fastener.</p>

  <p>The drawings for the new vans to the hinder screw lay on the table before
  him as he spoke. He pitched the mutilated brass paper-fastener into the
  waste-paper basket and drummed with his fingers. "These alterations! Will the
  mathematicians ever be clever enough to save us all this patching and
  experimenting? Five years&mdash;learning by rule of thumb, when one might
  think that it was possible to calculate the whole thing out beforehand. The
  cost of it! I might have hired three senior wranglers for life. But they'd
  only have developed some beautifully useless theorems in pneumatics. What a
  time it has been, Woodhouse!"</p>

  <p>"These mouldings will take three weeks," said Woodhouse. "At special
  prices."</p>

  <p>"Three weeks!" said Monson, and sat drumming.</p>

  <p>"Three weeks certain," said Woodhouse, an excellent engineer, but no good
  as a comforter. He drew the sheets towards him and began shading a bar.</p>

  <p>Monson stopped drumming, and began to bite his finger-nails, staring the
  while at Woodhouse's head.</p>

  <p>"How long have they been calling this Monson's Folly?" he said
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Oh! Year or so," said Woodhouse carelessly, without looking up.</p>

  <p>Monson sucked the air in between his teeth, and went to the window. The
  stout iron columns carrying the elevated rails upon which the start of the
  machine was made rose up close by, and the machine was hidden by the upper
  edge of the window. Through the grove of iron pillars, red painted and ornate
  with rows of bolts, one had a glimpse of the pretty scenery towards Esher. A
  train went gliding noiselessly across the middle distance, its rattle drowned
  by the hammering of the workmen overhead. Monson could imagine the grinning
  faces at the windows of the carriages. He swore savagely under his breath,
  and dabbed viciously at a blowfly that suddenly became noisy on the
  window-pane.</p>

  <p>"What's up?" said Woodhouse, staring in surprise at his employer.</p>

  <p>"I'm about sick of this."</p>

  <p>Woodhouse scratched his cheek. "Oh!" he said, after an assimilating pause.
  He pushed the drawing away from him.</p>

  <p>"Here these fools... I'm trying to conquer a new element&mdash;trying to
  do a thing that will revolutionise life. And instead of taking an intelligent
  interest, they grin and make their stupid jokes, and call me and my
  appliances names."</p>

  <p>"Asses!" said Woodhouse, letting his eye fall again on the drawing.</p>

  <p>The epithet, curiously enough, made Monson wince. "I'm about sick of it,
  Woodhouse, anyhow," he said, after a pause.</p>

  <p>Woodhouse shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing for it but patience, I suppose," said Monson, sticking
  his hands in his pockets. "I've started. I've made my bed, and I've got to
  lie on it. I can't go back. I'll see it through, and spend every penny I have
  and every penny I can borrow. But I tell you, Woodhouse, I'm infernally sick
  of it, all the same. If I'd paid a tenth part of the money towards some
  political greaser's expenses&mdash;I'd have been a baronet before this."</p>

  <p>Monson paused. Woodhouse stared in front of him with a blank expression he
  always employed to indicate sympathy, and tapped his pencil-case on the
  table. Monson stared at him for a minute.</p>

  <p>"Oh, damn!" said Monson suddenly, and abruptly rushed out of the room.</p>

  <p>Woodhouse continued his sympathetic rigour for perhaps half a minute. Then
  he sighed and resumed the shading of the drawings. Something had evidently
  upset Monson. Nice chap, and generous, but difficult to get on with. It was
  the way with every amateur who had anything to do with
  engineering&mdash;wanted everything finished at once. But Monson had usually
  the patience of the expert. Odd he was so irritable. Nice and round that
  aluminium rod did look now! Woodhouse threw back his head, and put it, first
  this side and then that, to appreciate his bit of shading better.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Woodhouse," said Hooper, the foreman of the labourers, putting his
  head in at the door.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" said Woodhouse, without turning round.</p>

  <p>"Nothing happened, sir?" said Hooper.</p>

  <p>"Happened?" said Woodhouse.</p>

  <p>"The governor just been up the rails swearing like a tornader."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Woodhouse.</p>

  <p>"It ain't like him, sir."</p>

  <p>"No?"</p>

  <p>"And I was thinking perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't think," said Woodhouse, still admiring the drawings.</p>

  <p>Hooper knew Woodhouse, and shut the door suddenly with a vicious slam.
  Woodhouse stared stonily before him for some further minutes, and then made
  an ineffectual effort to pick his teeth with his pencil. Abruptly he
  desisted, pitched that old, tried, and stumpy servitor across the room, got
  up, stretched himself, and followed Hooper.</p>

  <p>He looked ruffled&mdash;it was visible to every workman he met. When a
  millionaire who has been spending thousands on experiments that employ quite
  a little army of people suddenly indicates that he is sick of the
  undertaking, there is almost invariably a certain amount of mental friction
  in the ranks of the little army he employs. And even before he indicates his
  intentions there are speculations and murmurs, a watching of faces and a
  study of straws. Hundreds of people knew before the day was out that Monson
  was ruffled, Woodhouse ruffled, Hooper ruffled. A workman's wife, for
  instance (whom Monson had never seen), decided to keep her money in the
  savings-bank instead of buying a velveteen dress. So far-reaching are even
  the casual curses of a millionaire.</p>

  <p>Monson found a certain satisfaction in going on the works and behaving
  disagreeably to as many people as possible. After a time even that palled
  upon him, and he rode off the grounds, to every one's relief there, and
  through the lanes south-eastward, to the infinite tribulation of his house
  steward at Cheam.</p>

  <p>And the immediate cause of it all, the little grain of annoyance that had
  suddenly precipitated all this discontent with his life-work was&mdash;these
  trivial things that direct all our great decisions&mdash;! Half a dozen ill-
  considered remarks made by a pretty girl, prettily dressed, with a beautiful
  voice and something more than prettiness in her soft grey eyes. And of these
  half-dozen remarks, two words especially&mdash;"Monson's Folly." She had felt
  she was behaving charmingly to Monson; she reflected the next day how
  exceptionally effective she had been, and no one would have been more amazed
  than she, had she learned the effect she had left on Monson's mind. I hope,
  considering everything, that she never knew.</p>

  <p>"How are you getting on with your flying-machine?" she asked. ("I wonder
  if I shall ever meet any one with the sense not to ask that," thought
  Monson.) "It will be very dangerous at first, will it not?" ("Thinks I'm
  afraid.") "Jorgon is going to play presently; have you heard him before?"
  ("My mania being attended to, we turn to rational conversation.") Gush about
  Jorgon; gradual decline of conversation, ending with&mdash;"You must let me
  know when your flying-machine is finished, Mr. Monson, and then I will
  consider the advisability of taking a ticket." ("One would think I was still
  playing inventions in the nursery.") But the bitterest thing she said was not
  meant for Monson's ears. To Phlox, the novelist, she was always
  conscientiously brilliant. "I have been talking to Mr. Monson, and he can
  think of nothing, positively nothing, but that flying-machine of his. Do you
  know, all his workmen call that place of his 'Monson's Folly'? He is quite
  impossible. It is really very, very sad. I always regard him myself in the
  light of sunken treasure&mdash;the Lost Millionaire, you know."</p>

  <p>She was pretty and well educated&mdash;, indeed, she had written an
  epigrammatic novelette; but the bitterness was that she was typical. She
  summarised what the world thought of the man who was working sanely,
  steadily, and surely towards a more tremendous revolution in the appliances
  of civilisation, a more far-reaching alteration in the ways of humanity than
  has ever been effected since history began. They did not even take his
  seriously. In a little while he would be proverbial. "I must fly now," he
  said on his way home, smarting with a sense of absolute social failure. "I
  must fly soon. If it doesn't come off soon, by God! I shall run amuck."</p>

  <p>He said that before he had gone through his pass-book and his litter of
  papers. Inadequate as the cause seems, it was that girl's voice and the
  expression of her eyes that precipitated his discontent. But certainly the
  discovery that he had no longer even one hundred thousand pounds' worth of
  realisable property behind him was the poison that made the wound deadly.</p>

  <p>It was the next day after this that he exploded upon Woodhouse and his
  workmen, and thereafter his bearing was consistently grim for three weeks,
  and anxiety dwelt in Cheam and Ewell, Maldon, Morden, and Worcester Park,
  places that had thriven mightily on his experiments.</p>

  <p>Four weeks after that first swearing of his, he stood with Woodhouse by
  the reconstructed machine as it lay across the elevated railway, by means of
  which it gained its initial impetus. The new propeller glittered a brighter
  white than the rest of the machine, and a gilder, obedient to a whim of
  Monson's was picking out the aluminium bars with gold. And looking down the
  long avenue between the ropes (gilded now with the sunset), one saw red
  signals, and two miles away an ant-hill of workmen busy altering the last
  falls of the run into a rising slope.</p>

  <p>"I'll come," said Woodhouse. "I'll come right enough. But I tell you it's
  infernally foolhardy. If only you would give another year&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I tell you I won't. I tell you the thing works. I've given years
  enough&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's not that," said Woodhouse. "We're all right with the machine. But
  it's the steering&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Haven't I been rushing, night and morning, backwards and forwards,
  through the squirrel's cage? If the thing steers true here, it will steer
  true all across England. It's just funk, I tell you, Woodhouse. We could have
  gone a year ago. And besides&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Woodhouse.</p>

  <p>"The money!" snapped Monson over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Hang it! I never thought of the money," said Woodhouse, and then,
  speaking now in a very different tone to that with which he said the words
  before, he repeated, "I'll come. Trust me."</p>

  <p>Monson turned suddenly, and saw all that Woodhouse had not the dexterity
  to say, shining on his sunset-lit face. He looked for a moment, then
  impulsively extended his hand. "Thanks," he said.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Woodhouse, gripping the hand, and with a queer softening
  of his features. "Trust me."</p>

  <p>Then both men turned to the big apparatus that lay with its flat wings
  extended upon the carrier, and stared at it meditatively. Monson, guided
  perhaps by a photographic study of flight of birds, and by Lilienthal's
  methods, had gradually drifted from Maxim's shapes towards the bird form
  again. The thing, however, was driven by a huge screw behind in the place of
  the tail; and so hovering, which needs an almost vertical adjustment of a
  flat tail, was rendered impossible. The body of the machine was small, almost
  cylindrical, and pointed. Forward and aft on the pointed ends were two small
  petroleum engines for the screw, and the navigators sat deep in a canoe-like
  recess, the foremost one steering, and being protected by a low screen, with
  two plate-glass windows, from the blinding rush of air. On either side a
  monstrous flat framework with a curved front border could be adjusted so as
  either to lie horizontally, or to be tilted upward or down. These wings
  worked rigidly together, or by releasing a pin, one could be tilted through a
  small angle independently of its fellow. The front edge of either wing could
  also be shifted back so as to diminish the wing-area about one-sixth. The
  machine was not only not designed to hover, but it was also incapable of
  fluttering. Monson's idea was to get into the air with the initial rush of
  the apparatus, and then to skim, much as a playing-card may be skimmed,
  keeping up the rush by means of the screw at the stern. Rooks and gulls fly
  enormous distances in that way with scarcely a perceptible movement of the
  wings. The bird really drives along on an aerial switchback. It glides
  slanting downward for a space, until it has gained considerable momentum, and
  then altering the inclination of its wings, glides up again almost to its
  original altitude. Even a Londoner who has watched the birds in the aviary in
  Regent's Park knows that.</p>

  <p>But the bird is practising this art from the moment it leaves its nest. It
  has not only the perfect apparatus, but the perfect instinct to use it. A man
  off his feet has the poorest skill in balancing. Even the simple trick of the
  bicycle costs him some hours of labour. The instantaneous adjustments of the
  wings, the quick response to a passing breeze, the swift recovery of
  equilibrium, the giddy, eddying movements that require such absolute
  precision&mdash;all that he must learn, learn with infinite labour and
  infinite danger, if ever he is to conquer flying. The flying-machine that
  will start off some fine day, driven by neat "little levers," with a nice
  open deck like a liner, and all loaded up with bombshells and guns, is the
  easy dreaming of a literary man. In lives and in treasure the cost of the
  conquest of the empire of air may even exceed all that has been spent in
  man's great conquest of the sea. Certainly it will be costlier than the
  greatest war that has ever devastated the world.</p>

  <p>No one knew these things better than these two practical men. And they
  knew they were in the front rank of the coming army. Yet there is hope even
  in a forlorn hope. Men are killed outright in the reserves sometimes, while
  others who have been left for dead in the thickest corner crawl out and
  survive.</p>

  <p>"If we miss these meadows&mdash;" said Woodhouse presently in his slow
  way.</p>

  <p>"My dear chap," said Monson, whose spirits had been rising fitfully during
  the last few days, "we mustn't miss these meadows. There's a quarter of a
  square mile for us to hit, fences removed, ditches levelled. We shall come
  down all right&mdash;rest assured. And if we don't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Woodhouse. "If we don't!"</p>

  <p>Before the day of the start, the newspaper people got wind of the
  alterations at northward end of the framework, and Monson was cheered by a
  decided change in the comments Romeike forwarded him. "He will be off some
  day," said the papers. "He will be off some day," said the South-Western
  season-ticket holders one to another; the seaside excursionists, the
  Saturday-to-Monday trippers from Sussex and Hampshire and Dorset and Devon,
  the eminent literary people from Haslemere, all remarked eagerly one to
  another, "He will be off some day," as the familiar scaffolding came in
  sight. And actually, one bright morning, in full view of the ten-past-ten
  train from Basingstoke, Monson's flying-machine started on its journey.</p>

  <p>They saw the carrier running swiftly along its rail, and the white and
  gold screw spinning in the air. They heard the rapid rumble of wheels, and
  thud as the carrier reached the buffers at the end of its run. Then a whirr
  as the Flying-Machine was shot forward into the networks. All that the
  majority of them had seen and heard before. The thing went with a dropping
  flight through the framework and rose again, and then every beholder shouted,
  or screamed, or yelled, or shrieked after his kind. For instead of the
  customary concussion and stoppage, the Flying-Machine flew out of its five
  years' cage like a bolt from a crossbow, and drove slantingly upward into the
  air, curved round a little, so as to cross the line, and soared in the
  direction of Wimbledon Common.</p>

  <p>It seemed to hang momentarily in the air and grow smaller, then it ducked
  and vanished over the clustering blue tree-tops to the east of Coombe Hill,
  and no one stopped staring and gasping until long after it had
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>That was what the people in the train from Basingstoke saw. If you had
  drawn a line down the middle of that train, from engine to guard's van, you
  would not have found a living soul on the opposite side to the
  flying-machine. It was a mad rush from window to window as the thing crossed
  the line. And the engine-driver and stoker never took their eyes off the low
  hills about Wimbledon, and never noticed that they had run clean through
  Coombe and Malden and Raynes Park, until with returning animation, they found
  themselves pelting, at the most indecent pace, into Wimbledon station.</p>

  <p>From the moment when Monson had started the carrier with a "Now!" neither
  he nor Woodhouse said a word. Both men sat with clenched teeth. Monson had
  crossed the line with a curve that was too sharp, and Woodhouse had opened
  and shut his white lips; but neither spoke. Woodhouse simply gripped his
  seat, and breathed sharply through his teeth, watching the blue country to
  the west rushing past, and down, and away from him. Monson knelt at his post
  forward, and his hands trembled on the spoked wheel that moved the wings. He
  could see nothing before him but a mass of white clouds in the sky.</p>

  <p>The machine went slanting upward, travelling with an enormous speed still,
  but losing momentum every moment. The land ran away underneath with
  diminishing speed.</p>

  <p>"Now!" said Woodhouse at last, and with a violent effort Monson wrenched
  over the wheel and altered the angle of the wings. The machine seemed to hang
  for half a minute motionless in mid-air, and then he saw the hazy blue house-
  covered hills of Kilburn and Hampstead jump up before his eyes and rise
  steadily, until the little sunlit dome of the Albert Hall appeared through
  his windows. For a moment he scarcely understood the meaning of this upward
  rush of the horizon, but as the nearer and nearer houses came into view, he
  realised what he had done. He had turned the wings over too far, and they
  were swooping steeply downward towards the Thames.</p>

  <p>The thought, the question, the realisation were all the business of a
  second of time. "Too much!" gasped Woodhouse. Monson brought the wheel
  halfway back with a jerk, and forthwith the Kilburn and Hampstead ridge
  dropped again to the lower edge of his windows. They had been a thousand feet
  above Coombe and Malden station; fifty seconds after they whizzed, at a
  frightful pace, not eighty feet above the East Putney station, on the
  Metropolitan District line, to the screaming astonishment of a platformful of
  people. Monson flung up the vans against the air, and over Fulham they rushed
  up their atmospheric switchback again, steeply&mdash;too steeply. The 'buses
  went floundering across the Fulham Road, the people yelled.</p>

  <p>Then down again, too steeply still, and the distant trees and houses about
  Primrose Hill leapt up across Monson's window, and then suddenly he saw
  straight before him the greenery of Kensington Gardens and the towers of the
  Imperial Institute. They were driving straight down upon South Kensington.
  The pinnacles of the Natural History Museum rushed up into view. There came
  one fatal second of swift thought, a moment of hesitation. Should he try and
  clear the towers, or swerve eastward?</p>

  <p>He made a hesitating attempt to release the right wing, left the catch
  half released, and gave a frantic clutch at the wheel.</p>

  <p>The nose of the machine seemed to leap up before him. The wheel pressed
  his hand with irresistible force, and jerked itself out of his control.</p>

  <p>Woodhouse, sitting crouched together, gave a hoarse cry, and sprang up
  towards Monson. "Too far!" he cried, and then he was clinging to the gunwale
  for dear life, and Monson had been jerked clean overhead, and was falling
  backwards upon him.</p>

  <p>So swiftly had the thing happened that barely a quarter of the people
  going to and fro in Hyde Park, and Brompton Road, and the Exhibition Road saw
  anything of the aerial catastrophe. A distant winged shape had appeared above
  the clustering houses to the south, had fallen and risen, growing larger as
  it did so; had swooped swiftly down towards the Imperial Institute, a broad
  spread of flying wings, had swept round in a quarter circle, dashed eastward,
  and then suddenly sprang vertically into the air. A black object shot out of
  it, and came spinning downward. A man! Two men clutching each other! They
  came whirling down, separated as they struck the roof of Students' Club, and
  bounded off into the green bushes on its southward side.</p>

  <p>For perhaps half a minute, the pointed stem of the big machine still
  pierced vertically upward, the screw spinning desperately. For one brief
  instant, that yet seemed an age to all who watched, it had hung motionless in
  mid-air. Then a spout of yellow flame licked up its length from the stern
  engine, and swift, swifter, swifter, and flaring like a rocket, it rushed
  down upon the solid mass of masonry which was formerly the Royal College of
  Science. The big screw of white and gold touched the parapet, and crumpled up
  like wet linen. Then the blazing spindle-shaped body smashed and splintered,
  smashing and splintering in its fall, upon the north-westward angle of the
  building.</p>

  <p>But the crash, the flame of blazing paraffin that shot heavenward from the
  shattered engines of the machine, the crushed horrors that were found in the
  garden beyond the Students' Club, the masses of yellow parapet and red brick
  that fell headlong into the roadway, the running to and fro of people like
  ants in a broken ant-hill, the galloping of fire-engines, the gathering of
  crowds-all these things do not belong to this story, which was written only
  to tell how the first of all successful flying-machines was launched and
  flew. Though he failed, and failed disastrously, the record of Monson's work
  remains a sufficient monument&mdash;to guide the next of that band of gallant
  experimentalists who will sooner or later master this great problem of
  flying. And between Worcester Park and Malden there still stands that
  portentous avenue of iron-work, rusting now, and dangerous here and there, to
  witness to the first desperate struggle for man's right of way through the
  air.</p>

     name="story25">THE BULLA</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Sun Literary Supplement</i>, December 1,
  1895<br>
  Also published as "The Reconciliation"</h3>

  <p>Temple had scarcely been with Findlay five minutes before he felt his old
  resentments, and the memory of that unforgettable wrong growing vivid again.
  But with the infatuation of his good resolution still upon him, he maintained
  the air of sham reconciliation that Findlay had welcomed so eagerly. They
  talked of this and that, carefully avoiding the matter of separation. Temple
  at first spoke chiefly of his travels. He stood between the cabinet of
  minerals and the fireplace, his whisky on the mantel-board, while Findlay sat
  with his chair pushed back from his writing-desk, on which were scattered the
  dozen little skulls of hedgehogs and shrew mice upon which he had been
  working.</p>

  <p>Temple's eye fell upon them, and abruptly brought his mind round from the
  topic of West Africa. "And you," said Temple. "While I have been wandering I
  suppose you have been going on steadily."</p>

  <p>"Drumming along," said Findlay.</p>

  <p>"To the Royal Society and fame and all the things we used to dream about
  &mdash;how long is it?"</p>

  <p>"Five years&mdash;since our student days."</p>

  <p>Temple glanced round the room, and his eye rested for a moment on a round
  greyish-drab object that lay in a corner near the door. "The same fat books
  and folios, only more of them, the same smell of old bones, and
  dissection&mdash;is it the same one&mdash;? In the window. Fame is your
  mistress?"</p>

  <p>"Fame," said Findlay. "But it's hardly fame. The herd outside say,
  'Eminence in comparative anatomy.'"</p>

  <p>"Eminence in comparative anatomy. No marrying&mdash;no avarice."</p>

  <p>"None," said Findlay, glancing askance at him.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's the happiest way of living. But it wouldn't be the thing
  for me. Excitement&mdash;but, I say&mdash;!" his eye had fallen again on that
  fungoid shape of drabbish-grey&mdash;, "there's a limit to scientific
  inhumanity. You really mustn't keep your door open with a human
  brainpan."</p>

  <p>He went across the room as he spoke and picked the thing up. "Brainpan!"
  said Findlay. "Oh, that! Man alive, that's not a brainpan. Where's your
  science?"</p>

  <p>"No. I see it's not," said Temple, carrying the object in his hand as he
  came back to his former position and scrutinising it curiously. "But what the
  devil is it?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you know?" said Findlay.</p>

  <p>The thing was about thrice the size of a man's hand, like a rough watch-
  pocket of thick bone.</p>

  <p>Findlay laughed almost naturally. "You have a bad memory&mdash;it's a
  whale's ear-bone."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Temple, his appearance of interest vanishing. "The bulla
  of a whale. I've forgotten a lot of these things."</p>

  <p>He half turned, and put the thing on top of the cabinet beside Findlay's
  dumb-bells.</p>

  <p>"If you are serious in your music-hall proposal," he said, reverting to a
  jovial suggestion of Findlay's, "I am at your service. I'm afraid&mdash;I may
  find myself a little old for that sort of thing&mdash;I haven't tried one for
  ages."</p>

  <p>"But we are meeting to commemorate youth," said Findlay.</p>

  <p>"And bury our early manhood," said Temple. "Well, well&mdash;yes, let us
  go to the music-hall, by all means, if you desire it. It is trivial&mdash;and
  appropriate. We want no tragic issues."</p>

  <p>When the men returned to Findlay's study the little clock in the dimness
  on the mantel-shelf was pointing to half-past one. After the departure the
  little brown room, with its books and bones, was undisturbed, save for the
  two visits Findlay's attentive servant paid, to see to the fire and to pull
  down the blinds and draw the curtains. The ticking of the clock was the only
  sound in the quiet. Now and then the fire flickered and stirred, sending
  blood-red reflections chasing the shadows across the ceiling, and bringing
  into ghostly transitory prominence some grotesque grouping of animals' bones
  or skulls upon the shelves. At last the stillness was broken by the
  unlatching and slamming of the heavy street door and the sound of unsteady
  footsteps approaching along the passage. Then the door opened, and the two
  men came into the warm firelight.</p>

  <p>Temple came in first, his brown face flushed with drink, his coat
  unbuttoned, his hands deep in his trousers' pockets. His Christmas resolution
  had long since dissolved in alcohol. He was a little puzzled to find himself
  in Findlay's company. And his fuddled brain insisted upon inopportune
  reminiscence. He walked straight to the fire and stood before it, an
  exaggerated black figure, staring down into the red glow. "After all," he
  said, "we are fools to quarrel&mdash;fools to quarrel about a little thing
  like that. Damned fools!"</p>

  <p>Findaly went to the writing-table and felt about for the matches with
  quivering hands.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't my doing," he said.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't your doing," said Temple. "Nothing ever was your doing. You are
  always in the right&mdash;Findlay the all-right."</p>

  <p>Findlay's attention was concentrated upon the lamp. His hand was unsteady,
  and he had some difficulty in turning up the wicks; one got jammed down and
  the other flared furiously. When at last it was lit and turned up, he came up
  to Temple. "Take your coat off, old man, and have some more whisky," he said.
  "That was a ripping little girl in the skirt dance."</p>

  <p>"Fools to quarrel," said Temple slowly, and then woke up to Findlay's
  words. "Heigh?"</p>

  <p>"Take off your coat and sit down," said Findlay, moving up the little
  metal table and producing cigars and a siphon and whisky. "That lamp gives an
  infernally bad light, but it is all I have. Something wrong with the oil. Did
  you notice the dodge of that stone-smashing trick?"</p>

  <p>Temple remained erect and gloomy, staring into the fire. "Fools to
  quarrel," he said. Findlay was now half drunk, and his finesse began to leave
  him. Temple had been drinking heavily, and was now in a curious rambling
  stage. And Findlay's one idea now was to close this curious reunion.</p>

  <p>"There's no woman worth a man's friendship," said Temple abruptly.</p>

  <p>He sat down in an easy chair, poured out and drank a dose of whisky and
  lithia. The idea of friendship took possession of him, and he became
  reminiscent of student days and student adventures. For some time it was, "Do
  you remember" this, and "Do you remember" that. And Findlay grew cheerful
  again.</p>

  <p>"They were glorious times," said Findlay, pouring whisky into Temple's
  glass.</p>

  <p>Then Temple startled him by abruptly reverting to that bitter quarrel. "No
  woman in the world," he said. "Curse them!"</p>

  <p>He began to laugh stupidly. "After all," he said, "in the end."</p>

  <p>"Oh, damn!" said Findlay.</p>

  <p>"All very well for you to swear," said Temple, "but you forget about me.
  'Tain't your place to swear. If only you'd left things alone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I thought the password was forget," said Findlay.</p>

  <p>Temple stared into the fire for a space. "Forget," he said, and then with
  a curious return to a clarity of speech, "Findlay, I'm getting drunk."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, man, take some more."</p>

  <p>Temple rose out of his chair with a look of one awakening. "There's no
  reason why I should get drunk, because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Drink," said Findlay, "and forget it."</p>

  <p>"Faugh! I want to stick my head in water. I want to think. What the deuce
  am I doing here, with you of all people?"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! Talk and forget it, if you won't drink. Do you remember old
  Jason and the boxing-gloves? I wonder whether you could put up your fives
  now."</p>

  <p>Temple stood with his back to the fire, his brain spinning with drink, and
  the old hatred of Findlay came back in flood. He sought in his mind for some
  offensive thing to say, and his face grew dark. Findlay saw that a crisis was
  upon him and he cursed under his breath. His air of conviviality, his pose of
  hearty comforter, grew more and more difficult. But what else was there to
  do?</p>

  <p>"Old Jason&mdash;full of science and as slow as an elephant&mdash;! But he
  made boxers of us. Do you remember our little set-to&mdash;at that place in
  Gower Street?"</p>

  <p>To show his innocent liveliness, his freedom from preoccupation, Findlay
  pushed his chair aside, and stepped out into the middle of the room. There he
  began to pose in imitation of Jason, and to give a colourable travesty of the
  old prize-fighter's instructions. He picked up his boxing-gloves from the
  shelf in the recess, and slipped them on. Temple, lowering there on the brink
  of an explosion, was almost too much for his nerves. He felt his display of
  high spirits was a mistake, but he must go through with it now.</p>

  <p>"Don't stand glooming there, man. You're in just that state when the world
  looks black as ink. Drink yourself merry again. There's no woman in the world
  worth a man's friendship&mdash;that's agreed upon. Come and have a bout with
  these gloves of mine&mdash;four-ounce gloves. There's nothing sets the blood
  and spirits stirring like that."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Temple, quite mechanically. And then, waking up to what
  he was doing, "Were are the other gloves?"</p>

  <p>"Over there in the corner. On the top of the mineral cabinet. By Jove!
  Temple, this is like old times!"</p>

  <p>Temple, quivering strangely, went to the corner. He meant to thrash
  Findlay, and knew that in spite of his lighter weight he would do it. Yet it
  seemed puerile and inadequate to the pitch of absurdity, for the wrong
  Findlay had done him was great. And putting his hand on something pale in the
  shadow, he touched the bulla of the whale. The temptation was like a
  lightning flash. He slipped one glove on his left hand, and thrust the
  fingers of his right into the cavity of the bulla. It took all his fingers,
  and covered his knuckles and the back of his hand. And it was so oddly like a
  thumbless boxing glove! Just the very shape of the padded part. His spirits
  rose abruptly at the sudden prospect of a savage joke&mdash;how savage it
  would be, he did not know. Meanwhile Findlay, with a nervous alacrity, moved
  the lamp into the corner behind the armchair, and thrust his writing-desk
  into the window bay.</p>

  <p>"Come on," said Findlay, behind him, and abruptly he turned.</p>

  <p>Findlay looked straight into his eyes, on guard, his hands half open. He
  did not see the strange substitute for a glove that covered Temple's right
  hand. Both men were gone so far towards drunkenness that their power of
  observation was obscured. For a moment they stood squaring at one another,
  the host smiling, and his guest smiling also, but with his teeth set; two
  dark figures swaying in the firelight and the dim lamplight. Then Findlay
  struck at his opponent's face with his left hand. As he did so Temple ducked
  slightly to the left, and struck savagely over Findlay's shoulder at his
  temple with the bone-covered fist. The blow was given with such tremendous
  force that it sent Findlay reeling sideways, half stunned, and overcome with
  astonishment. The thing struck his ear, and the side of his face went white
  at the blow. He struggled to keep his footing, and as he did so Temple's
  gloved left hand took him in the chest and sent him spinning to the foot of
  the cigar cabinet.</p>

  <p>Findlay's eyes were wide open with astonishment. Temple was a lighter man
  by a stone or more than himself, and he did not understand how he had been
  felled. He was not stunned, although he was so dulled by the blow as not to
  notice the blood running down his cheek from his ear. He laughed insincerely,
  and almost pulling the cigar cabinet over, scrambled to his feet, made as if
  he would speak, and put up his hand instinctively as Temple struck out at him
  again, a feint with the left hand. Findlay was an expert boxer, and
  anticipating another right-hand blow over the ear, struck sharply at once
  with his own left hand in Temple's face, throwing his full weight into the
  blow, and dodging Temple's reply.</p>

  <p>Temple's upper lip was cut against his teeth, and the taste of blood and
  the sight of it trickling down Findlay's cheek destroyed the last vestiges of
  restraint that drink had left him, stripped of all that education had ever
  done for him. There remained now only the savage man-animal, the creature
  that thirsts for blood. With a half-bestial cry, he flung himself upon
  Findlay as he jumped back, and with a sudden sweep of his right arm cut down
  the defence, breaking Findlay's arm just above the wrist, and following with
  three rapid blows of the bulla upon the face. Findlay gave an inarticulate
  cry of astonishment, countered weakly once, and then went down like a felled
  ox. As he fell, Temple fell upon the top of him. There was a smash as the
  lamp went down.</p>

  <p>The lamp was extinguished as it fell, and left the room red and black.
  Findlay struck heavily at Temple's ribs, and Temple, with his left elbow at
  Findlay's neck, swung up his right arm and struck down a sledge-hammer blow
  upon the face, and again and yet again, until the body beneath his knees had
  ceased to writhe.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly his frenzy left him at the voice of a woman shrieking so
  that it filled the room. He looked up and crouched motionless as he heard and
  saw the study door closing and heard the patter of feet retreating in panic.
  Then he looked down and saw the thing that had once been the face of Findlay.
  For an awful minute he remained kneeling agape.</p>

  <p>Then he staggered to his feet and stood over Findlay's body in the glow of
  the dying fire, like a man awakening from a nightmare. Suddenly he perceived
  the bulla on his hand, covered with blood and hair, and began to understand
  what had happened. In a sudden horror he flung the diabolical thing from him.
  It struck the floor near the cigar cabinet, rolled for a yard or so on its
  edge, and came to rest in almost the position it had occupied when he had
  first set eyes on it. To Temple's excited imagination it seemed to be lying
  at exactly the same spot, the sole and sufficient cause of Findlay's death
  and his own.</p>

     name="story26">A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Yellow Book</i>, January 1896</h3>

  <p>Outside the laboratory windows was a watery-grey fog, and within a close
  warmth and the yellow light of the green-shaded gas lamps that stood two to
  each table down its narrow length. On each table stood a couple of glass jars
  containing the mangled vestiges of the crayfish, mussels, frogs, and
  guineapigs upon which the students had been working, and down the side of the
  room, facing the windows, were shelves bearing bleached dissections in
  spirits, surmounted by a row of beautifully executed anatomical drawings in
  whitewood frames and overhanging a row of cubical lockers. All the doors of
  the laboratory were panelled with blackboard, and on these were the
  half-erased diagrams of the previous day's work. The laboratory was empty,
  save for the demonstrator, who sat near the preparation-room door, and
  silent, save for a low, continuous murmur and the clicking of the rocker
  microtome at which he was working. But scattered about the room were traces
  of numerous students: hand-bags, polished boxes of instruments, in one place
  a large drawing covered by newspaper, and in another a prettily bound copy of
  'News from Nowhere', a book oddly at variance with its surroundings. These
  things had been put down hastily as the students had arrived and hurried at
  once to secure their seats in the adjacent lecture theatre. Deadened by the
  closed door, the measured accents of the professor sounded as a featureless
  muttering.</p>

  <p>Presently, faint through the closed windows came the sound of the Oratory
  clock striking the hour of eleven. The clicking of the microtome ceased, and
  the demonstrator looked at his watch, rose, thrust his hands into his
  pockets, and walked slowly down the laboratory towards the lecture theatre
  door. He stood listening for a moment, and then his eye fell on the little
  volume by William Morris. He picked it up, glanced at the title, smiled,
  opened it, looked at the name on the fly-leaf, ran the leaves through with
  his hand, and put it down. Almost immediately the even murmur of the lecturer
  ceased, there was a sudden burst of pencils rattling on the desks in the
  lecture theatre, a stirring, a scraping of feet, and a number of voices
  speaking together. Then a firm footfall approached the door, which began to
  open, and stood ajar, as some indistinctly heard question arrested the
  new-comer.</p>

  <p>The demonstrator turned, walked slowly back past the microtome, and left
  the laboratory by the preparation-room door. As he did so, first one, and
  then several students carrying notebooks entered the laboratory from the
  lecture theatre, and distributed themselves among the little tables, or stood
  in a group about the doorway. They were an exceptionally heterogeneous
  assembly, for while Oxford and Cambridge still recoil from the blushing
  prospect of mixed classes, the College of Science anticipated America in the
  matter years ago&mdash;mixed socially, too, for the prestige of the College
  is high, and its scholarships, free of any age limit, dredge deeper even than
  do those of the Scotch universities. The class numbered one-and-twenty, but
  some remained in the theatre questioning the professor, copying the
  blackboard diagrams before they were washed off, or examining the special
  specimens he had produced to illustrate the day's teaching. Of the nine who
  had come into the laboratory three were girls, one of whom, a little fair
  woman, wearing spectacles and dressed in greyish-green, was peering out of
  the window at the fog, while the other two, both wholesome-looking,
  plain-faced schoolgirls, unrolled and put on the brown holland aprons they
  wore while dissecting. Of the men, two went down the laboratory to their
  places, one a pallid, dark-bearded man, who had once been a tailor; the other
  a pleasant-featured, ruddy young man of twenty, dressed in a well-fitting
  brown suit; young Wedderburn, the son of Wedderburn, the eye specialist. The
  others formed a little knot near the theatre door. One of these, a dwarfed,
  spectacled figure, with a hunchback, sat on a bent wood stool; two others,
  one a short, dark youngster, and the other a flaxen-haired,
  reddish-complexioned young man, stood leaning side by side against the slate
  sink, while the fourth stood facing them, and maintained the larger share of
  the conversation.</p>

  <p>This last person was named Hill. He was a sturdily built young fellow, of
  the same age as Wedderburn; he had a white face, dark grey eyes, hair of an
  indeterminate colour, and prominent, irregular features. He talked rather
  louder than was needful, and thrust his hands deeply into his pockets. His
  collar was frayed and blue with the starch of a careless laundress, his
  clothes were evidently ready-made, and there was a patch on the side of his
  boot near the toe. And as he talked or listened to the others, he glanced now
  and again towards the lecture theatre door. They were discussing the
  depressing peroration of the lecture they had just heard, the last lecture it
  was in the introductory course in zoology. "From ovum to ovum is the goal of
  the higher vertebrata," the lecturer had said in his melancholy tones, and so
  had neatly rounded off the sketch of comparative anatomy he had been
  developing. The spectacled hunchback had repeated it, with noisy
  appreciation, had tossed it towards the fair-haired student with an evident
  provocation, and had started one of these vague, rambling discussions on
  generalities, so unaccountably dear to the student mind all the world
  over.</p>

  <p>"That is our goal, perhaps&mdash;I admit it, as far as science goes," said
  the fair-haired student, rising to the challenge. "But there are things above
  science."</p>

  <p>"Science," said Hill confidently, "is systematic knowledge. Ideas that
  don't come into the system&mdash;must anyhow&mdash;be loose ideas." He was
  not quite sure whether that was a clever saying or a fatuity until his
  hearers took it seriously.</p>

  <p>"The thing I cannot understand," said the hunchback, at large, "is whether
  Hill is a materialist or not."</p>

  <p>"There is one thing above matter," said Hill promptly, feeling he had a
  better thing this time; aware too, of someone in the doorway behind him, and
  raising his voice a trifle for her benefit, "and that is, the delusion that
  there is something above matter."</p>

  <p>"So we have your gospel at last," said the fair student. "It's all a
  delusion, is it? All our aspirations to lead something more than dogs' lives,
  all our work for anything beyond ourselves. But see how inconsistent you are.
  Your socialism, for instance. Why do you trouble about the interests of the
  race? Why do you concern yourself about the beggar in the gutter? Why are you
  bothering yourself to lend that book&mdash;" he indicated William Morris by a
  movement of the head&mdash;"to everyone in the lab.?"</p>

  <p>"Girl," said the hunchback indistinctly, and glanced guiltily over his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>The girl in brown, with the brown eyes, had come into the laboratory, and
  stood on the other side of the table behind him, with her rolled-up apron in
  one hand, looking over her shoulder, listening to the discussion. She did not
  notice the hunchback, because she was glancing from Hill to his interlocutor.
  Hill's consciousness of her presence betrayed itself to her only in his
  studious ignorance of the fact; but she understood that, and it pleased her.
  "I see no reason," said he, "why a man should live like a brute because he
  knows of nothing beyond matter, and does not expect to exist a hundred years
  hence."</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't he?" said the fair-haired student.</p>

  <p>"Why should he?" said Hill.</p>

  <p>"What inducement has he?"</p>

  <p>"That's the way with all you religious people. It's all a business of
  inducements. Cannot a man seek after righteousness for righteousness'
  sake?"</p>

  <p>There was a pause. The fair man answered, with a kind of vocal padding,
  "But&mdash;you see&mdash;inducement&mdash;when I said inducement," to gain
  time. And then the hunchback came to his rescue and inserted a question. He
  was a terrible person in the debating society with his questions, and they
  invariably took one form&mdash;a demand for a definition, "What's your
  definition of righteousness?" said the hunchback at this stage.</p>

  <p>Hill experienced a sudden loss of complacency at this question, but even
  as it was asked, relief came in the person of Brooks, the laboratory
  attendant, who entered by the preparation-room door, carrying a number of
  freshly killed guineapigs by their hind legs. "This is the last batch of
  material this session," said the youngster who had not previously spoken.</p>

  <p>Brooks advanced up the laboratory, smacking down a couple of guineapigs at
  each table. The rest of the class, scenting the prey from afar, came crowding
  in by the lecture theatre door, and the discussion perished abruptly as the
  students who were not already in their places hurried to them to secure the
  choice of a specimen. There was a noise of keys rattling on split rings as
  lockers were opened and dissecting instruments taken out. Hill was already
  standing by his table, and his box of scalpels was sticking out of his
  pocket. The girl in brown came a step towards him, and leaning over his
  table, said softly, "Did you see that I returned your book, Mr. Hill?"</p>

  <p>During the whole scene she and the book had been vividly present in his
  consciousness; but he made a clumsy pretence of looking at the book and
  seeing it for the first time. "Oh, yes," he said, taking it up. "I see. Did
  you like it?"</p>

  <p>"I want to ask you some questions about it&mdash;some time."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Hill. "I shall be glad." He stopped awkwardly. "You
  liked it?" he said.</p>

  <p>"It's a wonderful book. Only some things I don't understand."</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the laboratory was hushed by a curious, braying noise. It
  was the demonstrator. He was at the blackboard ready to begin the day's
  instruction, and it was his custom to demand silence by a sound midway
  between the "Er" of common intercourse and the blast of a trumpet. The girl
  in brown slipped back to her place: it was immediately in front of Hill's,
  and Hill, forgetting her forthwith, took a notebook out of the drawer of his
  table, turned over its leaves hastily, drew a stumpy pencil from his pocket,
  and prepared to make a copious note of the coming demonstration. For
  demonstrations and lectures are the sacred text of the College students.
  Books, saving only the Professor's own, you may&mdash;it is even expedient
  to&mdash;ignore.</p>

  <p>Hill was the son of a Landport cobbler, and had been hooked by a chance
  blue paper the authorities had thrown out to the Landport Technical College.
  He kept himself in London on his allowance of a guinea a week, and found
  that, with proper care, this also covered his clothing allowance, an
  occasional waterproof collar, that is; and ink and needles and cotton, and
  suchlike necessaries for a man about town. This was his first year and his
  first session, but the brown old man in Landport had already got himself
  detested in many public-houses by boasting of his son, "the Professor." Hill
  was a vigorous youngster, with a serene contempt for the clergy of all
  denominations, and a fine ambition to reconstruct the world. He regarded his
  scholarship as a brilliant opportunity. He had begun to read at seven, and
  had read steadily whatever came in his way, good or bad, since then. His
  worldly experience had been limited to the island of Portsea, and acquired
  chiefly in the wholesale boot factory in which he had worked by day, after
  passing the seventh standard of the Board school. He had a considerable gift
  of speech, as the College Debating Society, which met amidst the crushing
  machines and mine models in the metallurgical theatre downstairs, already
  recognised&mdash;recognised by a violent battering of desks whenever he rose.
  And he was just at that fine emotional age when life opens at the end of a
  narrow pass like a broad valley at one's feet, full of the promise of
  wonderful discoveries and tremendous achievements. And his own limitations,
  save that he knew, that he knew, neither Latin nor French, were all unknown
  to him.</p>

  <p>At first his interest had been divided pretty equally between his
  biological work at the College and social and theological theorising, an
  employment which he took in deadly earnest. Of a night, when the big museum
  library was not open, he would sit on the bed of his room in Chelsea with his
  coat and a muffler on, and write out the lecture notes and revise his
  dissection memoranda, until Thorpe called him out by a whistle&mdash;the
  landlady objected to open the door to attic visitors&mdash;and then the two
  would go prowling about the shadowy, shiny, gas-lit streets, talking, very
  much in the fashion of the sample just given, of the God idea, and
  Righteousness, and Carlyle, and the Reorganisation of Society. And in the
  midst of it all Hill, arguing not only for Thorpe, but for the casual
  passer-by, would lose the thread of his argument glancing at some pretty
  painted face that looked meaningly at him as he passed. Science and
  Righteousness! But once or twice lately there had been signs that a third
  interest was creeping into his life, and he had found his attention wandering
  from the fate of the mesoblastic somites or the probable meaning of the
  blastopore, to the thought of the girl with the brown eyes who sat at the
  table before him.</p>

  <p>She was a paying student; she descended inconceivable social altitudes to
  speak to him. At the thought of the education she must have had, and the
  accomplishments she must possess, the soul of Hill became abject within him.
  She had spoken to him first over a difficulty about the alisphenoid of a
  rabbit's skull, and he had found that, in biology at least, he had no reason
  for self-abasement. And from that, after the manner of young people starting
  from any starting-point, they got to generalities, and while Hill attacked
  her upon the question of socialism&mdash;, some instinct told him to spare
  her a direct assault upon her religion&mdash;she was gathering resolution to
  undertake what she told herself was his aesthetic education. She was a year
  or two older than he, though the thought never occurred to him. The loan of
  'News from Nowhere' was the beginning of a series of cross loans. Upon some
  absurd first principle of his, Hill had never "wasted time" Upon poetry, and
  it seemed an appalling deficiency to her. One day in the lunch hour, when she
  chanced upon him alone in the little museum where the skeletons were
  arranged, shamefully eating the bun that constituted his midday meal, she
  retreated, and returned to lend him, with a slightly furtive air, a volume of
  Browning. He stood sideways towards her and took the book rather clumsily,
  because he was holding the bun in the other hand. And in the retrospect his
  voice lacked the cheerful clearness he could have wished.</p>

  <p>That occurred after the examination in comparative anatomy, on the day
  before the College turned out its students, and was carefully locked up by
  the officials, for the Christmas holidays. The excitement of cramming for the
  first trial of strength had for a little while dominated Hill, to the
  exclusion of his other interests. In the forecasts of the result in which
  everyone indulged he was surprised to find that no one regarded him as a
  possible competitor for the Harvey Commemoration Medal, of which this and the
  two subsequent examinations disposed. It was about this time that Wedderburn,
  who so far had lived inconspicuously on the uttermost margin of Hill's
  perceptions, began to take on the appearance of an obstacle. By a mutual
  agreement, the nocturnal prowlings with Thorpe ceased for the three weeks
  before the examination, and his landlady pointed out that she really could
  not supply so much lamp oil at the price. He walked to and fro from the
  College with little slips of mnemonics in his hand, lists of crayfish
  appendages, rabbits' skull-bones, and vertebrate nerves, for example, and
  became a positive nuisance to foot passengers in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>But by a natural reaction, Poetry and the girl with the brown eyes ruled
  the Christmas holiday. The pending results of the examination became such a
  secondary consideration that Hill marvelled at his father's excitement. Even
  had he wished it, there was no comparative anatomy to read in Landport, and
  he was too poor to buy books, but the stock of poets in the library was
  extensive, and Hill's attack was magnificently sustained. He saturated
  himself with the fluent numbers of Longfellow and Tennyson, and fortified
  himself with Shakespeare; found a kindred soul in Pope, and a master in
  Shelley, and heard and fled the siren voices of Eliza Cook and Mrs. Hemans.
  But he read no more Browning, because he hoped for the loan of other volumes
  from Miss Haysman when he returned to London.</p>

  <p>He walked from his lodgings to the College with that volume of Browning in
  his shiny black bag, and his mind teeming with the finest general
  propositions about poetry. Indeed, he framed first this little speech and
  then that with which to grace the return. The morning was an exceptionally
  pleasant one for London; there was a clear, hard frost and undeniable blue in
  the sky, a thin haze softened every outline, and warm shafts of sunlight
  struck between the house blocks and turned the sunny side of the street to
  amber and gold. In the hall of the College he pulled off his glove and signed
  his name with fingers so stiff with cold that the characteristic dash under
  the signature he cultivated became a quivering line. He imagined Miss Haysman
  about him everywhere. He turned at the staircase, and there, below he saw a
  crowd struggling at the foot of the notice-board. This possibly, was the
  biology list. He forgot Browning and Miss Haysman for the moment, and joined
  the scrimmage. And at last, with his cheek flattened against the sleeve of
  the man on the step above him, he read the list&mdash;</p>

  <p>CLASS 1 H. J. Somers Wedderburn William Hill</p>

  <p>and thereafter followed a second class that is outside our present
  sympathies. It was characteristic that he did not trouble to look for Thorpe
  on the physics list, but backed out of the struggle at once, and in a curious
  emotional state between pride over common second-class humanity and acute
  disappointment at Wedderburn's success, went on his way upstairs. At the top,
  as he was hanging up his coat in the passage, the zoological demonstrator, a
  young man from Oxford, who secretly regarded him as a blatant "mugger" of the
  very worst type, offered his heartiest congratulations.</p>

  <p>At the laboratory door Hill stopped for a second to get his breath, and
  then entered. He looked straight up the laboratory and saw all five girl
  students grouped in their places, and Wedderburn, the once retiring
  Wedderburn, leaning rather gracefully against the window, playing with the
  blind tassel and talking, apparently, to the five of them. Now, Hill could
  talk bravely enough and even overbearingly to one girl, and he could have
  made a speech to a roomful of girls, but this business of standing at ease
  and appreciating, fencing, and returning quick remarks round a group was, he
  knew, altogether beyond him. Coming up the staircase his feelings for
  Wedderburn had been generous, a certain admiration perhaps, a willingness to
  shake his hand conspicuously and heartily as one who had fought but the first
  round. But before Christmas Wedderburn had never gone up to that end of the
  room to talk. In a flash Hill's mist of vague excitement condensed abruptly
  to a vivid dislike of Wedderburn. Possibly his expression changed. As he came
  up to his place, Wedderburn nodded carelessly to him, and the others glanced
  round. Miss Haysman looked at him and away again, the faintest touch of her
  eyes. "I can't agree with you, Mr. Wedderburn," she said.</p>

  <p>"I must congratulate you on your first-class, Mr. Hill," said the
  spectacled girl in green, turning round and beaming at him.</p>

  <p>"It's nothing," said Hill, staring at Wedderburn and Miss Haysman talking
  together, and eager to hear what they talked about.</p>

  <p>"We poor folks in the second class don't think so," said the girl in
  spectacles.</p>

  <p>What was it Wedderburn was saying? Something about William Morris! Hill
  did not answer the girl in spectacles, and the smile died out of his face. He
  could not hear, and failed to see how he could "cut in." Confound Wedderburn!
  He sat down, opened his bag, hesitated whether to return the volume of
  Browning forthwith, in the sight of all, and instead drew out his new
  notebooks for the short course in elementary botany that was now beginning,
  and which would terminate in February. As he did so, a fat, heavy man, with a
  white face and pale grey eyes&mdash;Bindon, the professor of botany, who came
  up from Kew for January and February&mdash;came in by the lecture theatre
  door, and passed, rubbing his hands together and smiling, in silent
  affability down the laboratory.</p>

  <p>In the subsequent six weeks Hill experienced some very rapid and curiously
  complex emotional developments. For the most part he had Wedderburn in
  focus&mdash;a fact that Miss Haysman never suspected. She told Hill (for in
  the comparative privacy of the museum she talked a good deal to him of
  socialism and Browning and general propositions) that she had met Wedderburn
  at the house of some people she knew, and "he's inherited his cleverness; for
  his father, you know, is the great eye specialist."</p>

  <p>"My father is a cobbler," said Hill, quite irrelevantly, and perceived the
  want of dignity even as he said it. But the gleam of jealousy did not offend
  her. She conceived herself the fundamental source of it. He suffered bitterly
  from a sense of Wedderburn's unfairness, and a realisation of his own
  handicap. Here was this Wedderburn had picked up a prominent man for a
  father, and instead of his losing so many marks on the score of that
  advantage, it was counted to him for righteousness! And while Hill had to
  introduce himself and talk to Miss Haysman clumsily over mangled guineapigs
  in the laboratory, this Wedderburn, in some backstairs way, had access to her
  social altitudes, and could converse in a polished argot that Hill understood
  perhaps, but felt incapable of speaking. Not of course, that he wanted to.
  Then it seemed to Hill that for Wedderburn to come there day after day with
  cuffs unfrayed, neatly tailored, precisely barbered, quietly perfect, was in
  itself an ill-bred, sneering sort of proceeding. Moreover, it was a stealthy
  thing for Wedderburn to behave insignificantly for a space, to mock modesty,
  to lead Hill to fancy that he himself was beyond dispute the man of the year,
  and then suddenly to dart in front of him, and incontinently to swell up in
  this fashion. In addition to these things, Wedderburn displayed an increasing
  disposition to join in any conversational grouping that included Miss
  Haysman, and would venture, and indeed seek occasion, to pass opinions
  derogatory to socialism and atheism. He goaded Hill to incivilities by neat,
  shallow, and exceedingly effective personalities about the socialist leaders,
  until Hill hated Bernard Shaw's graceful egotisms, William Morris's limited
  editions and luxurious wall-papers, and Walter Crane's charmingly absurd
  ideal working men, about as much as he hated Wedderburn. The dissertations in
  the laboratory, that had been his glory in the previous term, became a
  danger, degenerated into inglorious tussles with Wedderburn, and Hill kept to
  them only out of an obscure perception that his honour was involved. In the
  debating society Hill knew quite clearly that, to a thunderous accompaniment
  of banged desks, he could have pulverised Wedderburn. Only Wedderburn never
  attended the debating society to be pulverised, because&mdash;nauseous
  affectation&mdash;! He "dined late."</p>

  <p>You must not imagine that these things presented themselves in quite such
  a crude form to Hill's perception. Hill was a born generaliser. Wedderburn to
  him was not so much an individual obstacle as a type, the salient angle of a
  class. The economic theories that, after infinite ferment, had shaped
  themselves in Hill's mind, became abruptly concrete at the contact. The world
  became full of easy-mannered, graceful, gracefully-dressed, conversationally
  dexterous, finally shallow Wedderburn's, Bishops Wedderburn, Wedderburn
  M.P.'s, Professors Wedderburn, Wedderburn landlords, all with finger-bowl
  shibboleths and epigrammatic cities of refuge from a sturdy debater. And
  everyone ill-clothed or ill-dressed, from the cobbler to the cab-runner, was
  a man and a brother, a fellow-sufferer, to Hill's imagination. So that he
  became, as it were, a champion of the fallen and oppressed, albeit to outward
  seeming only a self-assertive, ill-mannered young man, and an unsuccessful
  champion at that. Again and again a skirmish over the afternoon tea that the
  girl students had inaugurated left Hill with flushed cheeks and a tattered
  temper, and the debating society noticed a new quality of sarcastic
  bitterness in his speeches.</p>

  <p>You will understand now how it was necessary, if only in the interests of
  humanity, that Hill should demolish Wedderburn in the forthcoming examination
  and outshine him in the eyes of Miss Haysman; and you will perceive too, how
  Miss Haysman fell into some common feminine misconceptions. The
  Hill-Wedderburn quarrel, for in his unostentatious way Wedderburn
  reciprocated Hill's ill-veiled rivalry, became a tribute to her indefinable
  charm; she was the Queen of Beauty in a tournament of scalpels and stumpy
  pencils. To her confidential friend's secret annoyance, it even troubled her
  conscience, for she was a good girl, and painfully aware, from Ruskin and
  contemporary fiction, how entirely men's activities are determined by women's
  attitudes. And if Hill never by any chance mentioned the topic of love to
  her, she only credited him with the finer modesty for that omission.</p>

  <p>So the time came on for the second examination, and Hill's increasing
  pallor confirmed the general rumour that he was working hard. In the aerated
  bread shop near South Kensington Station you would see him, breaking his bun
  and sipping his milk, with his eyes intent upon a paper of closely written
  notes. In his bedroom there were propositions about buds and stems round his
  looking-glass, a diagram to catch his eye, if soap should chance to spare it,
  above his washing basin. He missed several meetings of the debating society,
  but he found the chance encounters with Miss Haysman in the spacious ways of
  the adjacent art museum, or in the little museum at the top of the College,
  or in the College corridors, more frequent and very restful. In particular,
  they used to meet in a little gallery full of wrought-iron chests and gates,
  near the art library, and there Hill used to talk, under the gentle stimulus
  of her flattering attention, of Browning and his personal ambitions. A
  characteristic she found remarkable in him was his freedom from avarice. He
  contemplated quite calmly the prospect of living all his life on an income
  below a hundred pounds a year. But he was determined to be famous, to make,
  recognisably in his own proper person, the world a better place to live in.
  He took Bradlaugh and John Burns for his leaders and models, poor, even
  impecunious, great men. But Miss Haysman thought that such lives were
  deficient on the aesthetic side, by which, though she did not know it, she
  meant good wall-paper and upholstery, pretty books, tasteful clothes,
  concerts, and meals nicely cooked and respectfully served.</p>

  <p>At last came the day of the second examination, and the professor of
  botany, a fussy, conscientious man, rearranged all the tables in a long
  narrow laboratory to prevent copying, and put his demonstrator on a chair on
  a table (where he felt, he said, like a Hindoo god), to see all the cheating,
  and stuck a notice outside the door, "Door closed," for no earthly reason
  that any human being could discover. And all the morning from ten till one
  the quill of Wedderburn shrieked defiance at Hill's, and the quills of the
  others chased their leaders in a tireless pack, and so also it was in the
  afternoon. Wedderburn was a little quieter than usual, and Hill's face was
  hot all day, and his overcoat bulged with textbooks and notebooks against the
  last moment's revision. And the next day, in the morning and in the
  afternoon, was the practical examination, when sections had to be cut and
  slides identified. In the morning Hill was depressed because he knew he had
  cut a thick section, and in the afternoon came the mysterious slip.</p>

  <p>It was just the kind of thing that the botanical professor was always
  doing. Like the income tax, it offered a premium to the cheat. It was a
  preparation under the microscope, a little glass slip, held in its place on
  the stage of the instrument by light steel clips, and the inscription set
  forth that the slip was not to be moved. Each student was to go in turn to
  it, sketch it, write in his book of answers what he considered it to be, and
  return to his place. Now, to move such a slip is a thing one can do by a
  chance movement of the finger, and in a fraction of a second.</p>

  <p>The professor's reason for decreeing that the slip should not be moved
  depended on the fact that the object he wanted identified was characteristic
  of a certain tree stem. In the position in which it was placed it was a
  difficult thing to recognise, but once the slip was moved so as to bring
  other parts of the preparation into view, its nature was obvious enough.</p>

  <p>Hill came to this, flushed from a contest with staining re-agents, sat
  down on the little stool before the microscope, turned the mirror to get the
  best light, and then, out of sheer habit, shifted the slips. At once he
  remembered the prohibition, and with an almost continuous motion of his
  hands, moved it back, and sat paralysed with astonishment at his action.</p>

  <p>Then slowly, he turned his head. The professor was out of the room; the
  demonstrator sat aloft on his impromptu rostrum, reading the Quarterly
  Journal Microbiology Science; the rest of the examinees were busy, and with
  their backs to him. Should he own up to the accident now? He knew quite
  clearly what the thing was. It was a lenticel, a characteristic preparation
  from the elder-tree. His eyes roved over his intent fellow-students, and
  Wedderburn suddenly glanced over his shoulder at him with a queer expression
  in his eyes. The mental excitement that had kept Hill at an abnormal pitch of
  vigour these two days gave way to a curious nervous tension. His book of
  answers was beside him. He did not write down what the thing was, but with
  one eye at the microscope he began making a hasty sketch of it. His mind was
  full of this grotesque puzzle in ethics that had suddenly been sprung upon
  him. Should he identify it? Or should he leave this question unanswered? In
  that case Wedderburn would probably come out first in the second result. How
  could he tell now whether he might not have identified the thing without
  shifting it? It was possible that Wedderburn had failed to recognise it, of
  course. Suppose Wedderburn too had shifted the slide?</p>

  <p>He looked up at the clock. There were fifteen minutes in which to make up
  his mind. He gathered up his book of answers and the coloured pencils he used
  in illustrating his replies and walked back to his seat.</p>

  <p>He read through his manuscript, and then sat thinking and gnawing his
  knuckle. It would look queer now if he owned up. He must beat Wedderburn. He
  forgot the examples of those starry gentlemen, John Burns and Bradlaugh.
  Besides, he reflected, the glimpse of the rest of the slip he had, had was,
  after all, quite accidental, forced upon him by chance, a kind of
  providential revelation rather than an unfair advantage. It was not nearly so
  dishonest to avail himself of that as it was of Broome, who believed in the
  efficacy of prayer, to pray daily for a first-class. "Five minutes more,"
  said the demonstrator, folding up his paper and becoming observant. Hill
  watched the clock hands until two minutes remained; then he opened the book
  of answers, and, with hot ears and an affectation of ease, gave his drawing
  of the lenticel its name.</p>

  <p>When the second pass list appeared, the previous positions of Wedderburn
  and Hill were reversed, and the spectacled girl in green, who knew the
  demonstrator in private life (where he was practically human), said that in
  the result of the two examinations taken together Hill had the advantage of a
  mark&mdash;167 to 166 out of a possible 200. Everyone admired Hill in a way,
  though the suspicion of "mugging" clung to him. But Hill was to find
  congratulations and Miss Haysman's enhanced opinion of him, and even the
  decided decline in the crest of Wedderburn, tainted by an unhappy memory. He
  felt a remarkable access of energy at first, and the note of a democracy
  marching to triumph returned to his debating society speeches; he worked at
  his comparative anatomy with tremendous zeal and effect, and he went on with
  his aesthetic education. But through it all, a vivid little picture was
  continually coming before his mind's eye&mdash;of a sneakish person
  manipulating a slide.</p>

  <p>No human being had witnessed the act, and he was cocksure that no higher
  power existed to see, it; but for all that it worried him. Memories are not
  dead things but alive; they dwindle in disuse, but they harden and develop in
  all sorts of queer ways if they are being continually fretted. Curiously
  enough, though at the time he perceived clearly that the shifting was
  accidental, as the days wore on, his memory became confused about it, until
  at last he was not sure&mdash;although he assured himself that he was sure
  &mdash;whether the movement had been absolutely involuntary. Then it is
  possible that Hill's dietary was conducive to morbid conscientiousness; a
  breakfast frequently eaten in a hurry, a midday bun, and at such hours after
  five as chanced to be convenient, such meat as his means determined, usually
  in a chop-house in a back street off the Brompton Road. Occasionally he
  treated himself to threepenny or ninepenny classics, and they usually
  represented a suppression of potatoes or chops. It is indisputable that
  outbreaks of self-abasement and emotional revival have a distinct relation to
  periods of scarcity. But apart from this influence on the feelings, there was
  in Hill a distinct aversion to falsity that the blasphemous Landport cobbler
  had inculcated by strap and tongue from his earliest years. Of one fact about
  professed atheists I am convinced; they may be&mdash;they usually
  are&mdash;fools, void of subtlety, revilers of holy institutions, brutal
  speakers, and mischievous knaves, but they lie with difficulty. If it were
  not so, if they had the faintest grasp of the idea of compromise, they would
  simply be liberal churchmen. And moreover, this memory poisoned his regard
  for Miss Haysman. For she now so evidently preferred him to Wedderburn that
  he felt sure he cared for her, and began reciprocating her attentions by
  timid marks of personal regard; at one time he even bought a bunch of
  violets, carried it about in his pocket, and produced it, with a stumbling
  explanation, withered and dead, in the gallery of old iron. It poisoned too,
  the denunciation of capitalist dishonesty that had been one of his life's
  pleasures. And lastly, it poisoned his triumph in Wedderburn. Previously he
  had been Wedderburn's superior in his own eyes, and had raged simply at a
  want of recognition. Now he began to fret at the darker suspicion of positive
  inferiority. He fancied he found justifications for his position in Browning,
  but they vanished on analysis. At last&mdash;moved, curiously enough, by
  exactly the same motive forces that had resulted in his dishonesty&mdash;he
  went to Professor Bindon, and made a clean breast of the whole affair. As
  Hill was a paid student, Professor Bindon did not ask him to sit down, and he
  stood before the professor's desk as he made his confession.</p>

  <p>"It's a curious story," said Professor Bindon, slowly realising how the
  thing reflected on himself, and then letting his anger rise&mdash;, "a most
  remarkable story. I can't understand your doing it, and I can't understand
  this avowal. You're a type of student&mdash;Cambridge men would never dream
  &mdash;I suppose I ought to have thought&mdash;why did you cheat?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't cheat," said Hill.</p>

  <p>"But you have just been telling me you did."</p>

  <p>"I thought I explained&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Either you cheated or you did not cheat&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I said my motion was involuntary."</p>

  <p>"I am not a metaphysician, I am a servant of science&mdash;of fact. You
  were told not to move the slip. You did move the slip. If that is not
  cheating&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If I was a cheat," said Hill, with the note of hysterics in his voice,
  "should I come here and tell you?"</p>

  <p>"Your repentance, of course, does you credit," said Professor Bindon, "but
  it does not alter the original facts."</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Hill, giving in, in utter self-abasement.</p>

  <p>"Even now you cause an enormous amount of trouble. The examination list
  will have to be revised."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so, sir."</p>

  <p>"Suppose so? Of course it must be revised. And I don't see how I can
  conscientiously pass you."</p>

  <p>"Not pass me?" said Hill. "Fail me?"</p>

  <p>"It's the rule in all examinations. Or where should we be? What else did
  you expect? You don't want to shirk the consequences of your own acts?"</p>

  <p>"I thought, perhaps&mdash;" said Hill. And then, "Fail me? I thought, as I
  told you, you would simply deduct the marks given for that slip."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" said Bindon. "Besides, it would still leave you above
  Wedderburn. Deduct only the marks! Preposterous! The Departmental Regulations
  distinctly say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But it's my own admission, sir."</p>

  <p>"The Regulations say nothing whatever of the manner in which the matter
  comes to light. They simply provide&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It will ruin me. If I fail this examination, they won't renew my
  scholarship."</p>

  <p>"You should have thought of that before."</p>

  <p>"But, sir, consider all my circumstances&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I cannot consider anything. Professors in this College are machines. The
  Regulations will not even let us recommend our students for appointments. I
  am a machine, and you have worked me. I have to do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's very hard, sir."</p>

  <p>"Possibly it is."</p>

  <p>"If I am to be failed this examination, I might as well go home at
  once."</p>

  <p>"That is as you think proper." Bindon's voice softened a little; he
  perceived he had been unjust, and provided he did not contradict himself, he
  was disposed to amelioration. "As a private person," he said, "I think this
  confession of yours goes far to mitigate your offence. But you have set the
  machinery in motion, and now it must take its course. I&mdash;I am really
  sorry you gave way."</p>

  <p>A wave of emotion prevented Hill from answering. Suddenly, very vividly,
  he saw the heavily-lined face of the old Landport cobbler, his father. "Good
  God! What a fool I have been!" he said hotly and abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I hope," said Bindon, "that it will be a lesson to you."</p>

  <p>But, curiously enough, they were not thinking of quite the same
  indiscretion.</p>

  <p>There was a pause.</p>

  <p>"I would like a day to think, sir, and then I will let you
  know&mdash;about going home, I mean," said Hill, moving towards the door.</p>

  <p>The next day Hill's place was vacant. The spectacled girl in green was, as
  usual, first with the news. Wedderburn and Miss Haysman were talking of a
  performance of 'The Meistersingers' when she came up to them.</p>

  <p>"Have you heard?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Heard what?"</p>

  <p>"There was cheating in the examination."</p>

  <p>"Cheating!" said Wedderburn, with his face suddenly hot. "How?"</p>

  <p>"That slide&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Moved? Never!"</p>

  <p>"It was. That slide that we weren't to move&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" said Wedderburn. "Why! How could they find out? Who do they
  say&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"It was Mr. Hill."</p>

  <p>"Hill!"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hill!"</p>

  <p>"Not&mdash;surely not the immaculate Hill?" said Wedderburn,
  recovering.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it," said Miss Haysman. "How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't," said the girl in spectacles. "But I know it now for a fact.
  Mr. Hill went and confessed to Professor Bindon himself."</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" said Wedderburn. "Hill of all people. But I am always inclined
  to distrust these philanthropists-on-principle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are you quite sure?" said Miss Haysman, with a catch in her breath.</p>

  <p>"Quite. It's dreadful, isn't it? But, you know, what can you expect? His
  father is a cobbler."</p>

  <p>Then Miss Haysman astonished the girl in spectacles.</p>

  <p>"I don't care. I will not believe it," she said, flushing darkly under her
  warm-tinted skin. "I will not believe it until he has told me so himself
  &mdash;face to face. I would scarcely believe it then," and abruptly she
  turned her back on the girl in spectacles, and walked to her own place.</p>

  <p>"It's true, all the same," said the girl in spectacles, peering and
  smiling at Wedderburn.</p>

  <p>But Wedderburn did not answer her. She was indeed one of those people who
  seemed destined to make unanswered remarks.</p>

  <h3>First published as "A Slip Under The Knife" in <i>The New Review</i>,
  January 1896</h3>

  <p>"What if I die under it?" The thought recurred again and again, as I
  walked home from Haddon's. It was a purely personal question. I was spared
  the deep anxieties of a married man, and I knew there were few of my intimate
  friends but would find my death troublesome chiefly on account of their duty
  of regret. I was surprised indeed, and perhaps a little humiliated, as I
  turned the matter over, to think how few could possibly exceed the
  conventional requirement. Things came before me stripped of glamour, in a
  clear dry light, during that walk from Haddon's house over Primrose Hill.
  There were the friends of my youth: I perceived now that our affection was a
  tradition, which we foregathered rather laboriously to maintain. There were
  the rivals and helpers of my later career: I suppose I had been cold-blooded
  or undemonstrative&mdash;one perhaps implies the other. It may be that even
  the capacity for friendship is a question of physique. There had been a time
  in my own life when I had grieved bitterly enough at the loss of a friend;
  but as I walked home that afternoon the emotional side of my imagination was
  dormant. I could not pity myself, nor feel sorry for my friends, nor conceive
  of them as grieving for me.</p>

  <p>I was interested in this deadness of my emotional nature&mdash;no doubt a
  concomitant of my stagnating physiology; and my thoughts wandered off along
  the line it suggested. Once before, in my hot youth, I had suffered a sudden
  loss of blood, and had been within an ace of death. I remembered now that my
  affections as well as my passions had drained out of me, leaving scarce
  anything but a tranquil resignation, a dreg of self-pity. It had been weeks
  before the old ambitions and tendernesses, and all the complex moral
  interplay of a man had reasserted themselves. It occurred to me that the real
  meaning of this numbness might be a gradual slipping away from the
  pleasure-pain guidance of the animal man. It has been proven, I take it, as
  thoroughly as anything can be proven in this world, that the higher emotions,
  the moral feelings, even the subtle unselfishness of love, are evolved from
  the elemental desires and fears of the simple animal: they are the harness in
  which man's mental freedom goes. And it may be that as death overshadows us,
  as our possibility of acting diminishes, this complex growth of balanced
  impulse, propensity and aversion, whose interplay inspires our acts, goes
  with it. Leaving what?</p>

  <p>I was suddenly brought back to reality by an imminent collision with the
  butcher-boy's tray. I found that I was crossing the bridge over the Regent's
  Park Canal, which runs parallel with that in the Zoological Gardens. The boy
  in blue had been looking over his shoulder at a black barge advancing slowly,
  towed by a gaunt white horse. In the Gardens a nurse was leading three happy
  little children over the bridge. The trees were bright green; the spring
  hopefulness was still unstained by the dusts of summer; the sky in the water
  was bright and clear, but broken by long waves, by quivering bands of black,
  as the barge drove through. The breeze was stirring; but it did not stir me
  as the spring breeze used to do.</p>

  <p>Was this dulness of feeling in itself an anticipation? It was curious that
  I could reason and follow out a network of suggestion as clearly as ever: so
  at least, it seemed to me. It was calmness rather than dulness that was
  coming upon me. Was there any ground for the relief in the presentiment of
  death? Did a man near to death begin instinctively to withdraw himself from
  the meshes of matter and sense, even before the cold hand was laid upon his?
  I felt strangely isolated&mdash;isolated without regret&mdash;from the life
  and existence about me. The children playing in the sun and gathering
  strength and experience for the business of life, the park-keeper gossiping
  with a nursemaid, the nursing mother, the young couple intent upon each other
  as they passed me, the trees by the wayside spreading new pleading leaves to
  the sunlight, the stir in their branches&mdash;I had been part of it all, but
  I had nearly done with it now.</p>

  <p>Some way down the Broad Walk I perceived that I was tired, and that my
  feet were heavy. It was hot that afternoon, and I turned aside and sat down
  on one of the green chairs that line the way. In a minute I had dozed into a
  dream, and the tide of my thoughts washed up a vision of the resurrection. I
  was still sitting in the chair, but I thought myself actually dead, withered,
  tattered, dried, one eye (I saw) pecked out by birds. "Awake!" cried a voice;
  and incontinently the dust of the path and the mould under the grass became
  insurgent. I had never before thought of Regent's Park as a cemetery, but
  now, through the trees, stretching as far as eye could see, I beheld a flat
  plain of writhing graves and heeling tombstones. There seemed to be some
  trouble: the rising dead appeared to stifle as they struggled upward, they
  bled in their struggles, the red flesh was torn away from the white bones.
  "Awake!" cried a voice; but I determined I would not rise to such horrors.
  "Awake!" They would not let me alone. "Wake up!" said an angry voice. A
  cockney angel! The man who sells the tickets was shaking me, demanding my
  penny.</p>

  <p>I paid my penny, pocketed my ticket, yawned, stretched my legs, and
  feeling now rather less torpid, got up and walked on towards Langham Place. I
  speedily lost myself again in a shifting maze of thoughts about death. Going
  across Marylebone Road into that crescent at the end of Langham Place, I had
  the narrowest escape from the shaft of a cab, and went on my way with a
  palpitating heart and a bruised shoulder. It struck me that it would have
  been curious if my meditations on my death on the morrow had led to my death
  that day.</p>

  <p>But I will not weary you with more of my experiences that day and the
  next. I knew more and more certainly that I should die under the operation;
  at times I think I was inclined to pose to myself. At home I found everything
  prepared; my room cleared of needless objects and hung with white sheets; a
  nurse installed and already at loggerheads with my housekeeper. They wanted
  me to go to bed early, and after a little resistance I obeyed.</p>

  <p>In the morning I was very indolent, and though I read my newspapers and
  the letters that came by the first post, I did not find them very
  interesting. There was a friendly note from Addison, my old school friend,
  calling my attention to two discrepancies and a printer's error in my new
  book, with one from Langridge venting some vexation over Minton. The rest
  were business communications. I breakfasted in bed. The glow of pain at my
  side seemed more massive. I knew it was pain, and yet, if you can understand,
  I did not find it very painful. I had been awake and hot and thirsty in the
  night, but in the morning bed felt comfortable. In the night-time I had lain
  thinking of things that were past; in the morning I dozed over the question
  of immortality. Haddon came, punctual to the minute, with a neat black bag;
  and Mowbray soon followed. Their arrival stirred me up a little. I began to
  take a more personal interest in the proceedings. Haddon moved the little
  octagonal table close to the bedside, and with his broad back to me, began
  taking things out of his bag. I heard the light click of steel upon steel. My
  imagination, I found, was not altogether stagnant. "Will you hurt me much?" I
  said in an off-hand tone.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," Haddon answered over his shoulder. "We shall chloroform you.
  Your heart's as sound as a bell." And as he spoke, I had a whiff of the
  pungent sweetness of the anaesthetic.</p>

  <p>They stretched me out, with a convenient exposure of my side, and, almost
  before I realised what was happening, the chloroform was being administered.
  It stings the nostrils, and there is a suffocating sensation at first. I knew
  I should die&mdash;that this was the end of consciousness for me. And
  suddenly I felt that I was not prepared for death: I had a vague sense of a
  duty overlooked&mdash;I knew not what. What was it I had not done? I could
  think of nothing more to do, nothing desirable left in life; and yet I had
  the strangest disinclination to death. And the physical sensation was
  painfully oppressive. Of course the doctors did not know they were going to
  kill me. Possibly I struggled. Then I fell motionless, and a great silence, a
  monstrous silence, and an impenetrable blackness came upon me.</p>

  <p>There must have been an interval of absolute unconsciousness, seconds or
  minutes. Then with a chilly, unemotional clearness, I perceived that I was
  not yet dead. I was still in my body; but all the multitudinous sensations
  that come sweeping from it to make up the background of consciousness had
  gone, leaving me free of it all. No, not free of it all; for as yet something
  still held me to the poor stark flesh upon the bed&mdash;held me, yet not so
  closely that I did not feel myself external to it, independent of it,
  straining away from it. I do not think I saw, I do not think I heard; but I
  perceived all that was going on, and it was as if I both heard and saw.
  Haddon was bending over me, Mowbray behind me; the scalpel&mdash;it was a
  large scalpel&mdash;was cutting my flesh at the side under the flying ribs.
  It was interesting to see myself cut like cheese, without a pang, without
  even a qualm. The interest was much of a quality with that one might feel in
  a game of chess between strangers. Haddon's face was firm and his hand
  steady; but I was surprised to perceive (how I know not) that he was feeling
  the gravest doubt as to his own wisdom in the conduct of the operation.</p>

  <p>Mowbray's thoughts too, I could see. He was thinking that Haddon's manner
  showed too much of the specialist. New suggestions came up like bubbles
  through a stream of frothing meditation, and burst one after another in the
  little bright spot of his consciousness. He could not help noticing and
  admiring Haddon's swift dexterity, in spite of his envious quality and his
  disposition to detract. I saw my liver exposed. I was puzzled at my own
  condition. I did not feel that I was dead, but I was different in some way
  from my living self. The grey depression, that had weighed on me for a year
  or more and coloured all my thoughts, was gone. I perceived and thought
  without any emotional tint at all. I wondered if everyone perceived things in
  this way under chloroform, and forgot it again when he came out of it. It
  would be inconvenient to look into some heads, and not forget.</p>

  <p>Although I did not think that I was dead, I still perceived quite clearly
  that I was soon to die. This brought me back to the consideration of Haddon's
  proceedings. I looked into his mind, and saw that he was afraid of cutting a
  branch of the portal vein. My attention was distracted from details by the
  curious changes going on in his mind. His consciousness was like the
  quivering little spot of light which is thrown by the mirror of a
  galvanometer. His thoughts ran under it like a stream, some through the focus
  bright and distinct, some shadowy in the half-light of the edge. Just now the
  little glow was steady; but the least movement on Mowbray's part, the
  slightest sound from outside, even a faint difference in the slow movement of
  the living flesh he was cutting, set the light-spot shivering and spinning. A
  new sense-impression came rushing up through the flow of thoughts; and lo!
  The light-spot jerked away towards it, swifter than a frightened fish. It was
  wonderful to think that upon that unstable, fitful thing depended all the
  complex motions of the man; that for the next five minutes, therefore, my
  life hung upon its movements. And he was growing more and more nervous in his
  work. It was as if a little picture of a cut vein grew brighter, and
  struggled to oust from his brain another picture of a cut falling short of
  the mark. He was afraid: his dread of cutting too little was battling with
  his dread of cutting too far.</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly, like an escape of water from under a lock-gate, a great
  uprush of horrible realisation set all his thoughts swirling, and
  simultaneously I perceived that the vein was cut. He started back with a
  hoarse exclamation, and I saw the brown-purple blood gather in a swift bead,
  and run trickling. He was horrified. He pitched the red-stained scalpel on to
  the octagonal table; and instantly both doctors flung themselves upon me,
  making hasty and ill-conceived efforts to remedy the disaster. "Ice!" said
  Mowbray, gasping. But I knew that I was killed, though my body still clung to
  me.</p>

  <p>I will not describe their belated endeavours to save me, though I
  perceived every detail. My perceptions were sharper and swifter than they had
  ever been in life; my thoughts rushed through my mind with incredible
  swiftness, but with perfect definition. I can only compare their crowded
  clarity to the effects of a reasonable dose of opium. In a moment it would
  all be over, and I should be free. I knew I was immortal, but what would
  happen I did not know. Should I drift off presently, like a puff of smoke
  from a gun, in some kind of half-material body, an attenuated version of my
  material self? Should I find myself suddenly among the innumerable hosts of
  the dead, and know the world about me for the phantasmagoria it had always
  seemed? Should I drift to some spiritualistic seance, and there make foolish,
  incomprehensible attempts to affect a purblind medium? It was a state of
  unemotional curiosity, of colourless expectation. And then I realised a
  growing stress upon me, a feeling as though some huge human magnet was
  drawing me upward out of my body. The stress grew and grew. I seemed an atom
  for which monstrous forces were fighting. For one brief, terrible moment
  sensation came back to me. That feeling of falling headlong which comes in
  nightmares, that feeling a thousand times intensified, that and a black
  horror swept across my thoughts in a torrent. Then the two doctors, the naked
  body with its cut side, the little room, swept away from under me and
  vanished, as a speck of foam vanishes down an eddy.</p>

  <p>I was in mid-air. Far below was the West End of London, receding rapidly
  &mdash;, for I seemed to be flying swiftly upward&mdash;, and as it receded,
  passing westward like a panorama. I could see, through the faint haze of
  smoke, the innumerable roofs chimney-set, the narrow roadways, stippled with
  people and conveyances, the little specks of squares, and the church steeples
  like thorns sticking out of the fabric. But it spun away as the earth rotated
  on its axis, and in a few seconds (as it seemed) I was over the scattered
  clumps of town about Ealing, the little Thames a thread of blue to the south,
  and the Chiltern Hills and the North Downs coming up like the rim of a basin,
  far away and faint with haze. Up I rushed. And at first I had not the
  faintest conception what this headlong rush upward could mean.</p>

  <p>Every moment the circle of scenery beneath me grew wider and wider, and
  the details of town and field, of hill and valley, got more and more hazy and
  pale and indistinct, a luminous grey was mingled more and more with the blue
  of the hills and the green of the open meadows; and a little patch of cloud,
  low and far to the west, shone ever more dazzlingly white. Above, as the veil
  of atmosphere between myself and outer space grew thinner, the sky, which had
  been a fair springtime blue at first, grew deeper and richer in colour,
  passing steadily through the intervening shades, until presently it was as
  dark as the blue sky of midnight, and presently as black as the blackness of
  a frosty starlight, and at last as black as no blackness I had ever beheld.
  And first one star, and then many, and at last an innumerable host broke out
  upon the sky: more stars than anyone has ever seen from the face of the
  earth. For the blueness of the sky in the light of the sun and stars sifted
  and spread abroad blindingly: there is diffused light even in the darkest
  skies of winter, and we do not see the stars by day only because of the
  dazzling irradiation of the sun. But now I saw things&mdash;I know not how;
  assuredly with no mortal eyes&mdash;and that defect of bedazzlement blinded
  me no longer. The sun was incredibly strange and wonderful. The body of it
  was a disc of blinding white light: not yellowish, as it seems to those who
  live upon the earth, but livid white, all streaked with scarlet streaks and
  rimmed about with a fringe of writhing tongues of red fire. And shooting
  halfway across the heavens from either side of it and brighter than the Milky
  Way, were two pinions of silver-white, making it look more like those winged
  globes I have seen in Egyptian sculpture than anything else I can remember
  upon earth. These I knew for the solar corona, though I had never seen
  anything of it but a picture during the days of my earthly life.</p>

  <p>When my attention came back to the earth again, I saw that it had fallen
  very far away from me. Field and town were long since indistinguishable, and
  all the varied hues of the country were merging into a uniform bright grey,
  broken only by the brilliant white of the clouds that lay scattered in
  flocculent masses over Ireland and the west of England. For now I could see
  the outlines of the north of France and Ireland, and all this Island of
  Britain, save where Scotland passed over the horizon to the north, or where
  the coast was blurred or obliterated by cloud. The sea was a dull grey, and
  darker than the land; and the whole panorama was rotating slowly towards the
  east.</p>

  <p>All this had happened so swiftly that until I was some thousand miles or
  so from the earth I had no thought for myself. But now I perceived I had
  neither hands nor feet, neither parts nor organs, and that I felt neither
  alarm nor pain. All about me I perceived that the vacancy (for I had already
  left the air behind) was cold beyond the imagination of man; but it troubled
  me not. The sun's rays shot through the void, powerless to light or heat
  until they should strike on matter in their course. I saw things with a
  serene self-forgetfulness, even as if I were God. And down below there,
  rushing away from me&mdash;, countless miles in a second&mdash;, where a
  little dark spot on the grey marked the position of London, two doctors were
  struggling to restore life to the poor hacked and outworn shell I had
  abandoned. I felt then such release, such serenity as I can compare to no
  mortal delight I have ever known.</p>

  <p>It was only after I had perceived all these things that the meaning of
  that headlong rush of the earth grew into comprehension. Yet it was so
  simple, so obvious, that I was amazed at my never anticipating the thing that
  was happening to me. I had suddenly been cut adrift from matter: all that was
  material of me was there upon earth, whirling away through space, held to the
  earth by gravitation, partaking of the earth's inertia, moving in its wreath
  of epicycles round the sun, and with the sun and the planets on their vast
  march through space. But the immaterial has no inertia, feels nothing of the
  pull of matter for matter: where it parts from its garment of flesh, there it
  remains (so far as space concerns it any longer) immovable in space. I was
  not leaving the earth: the earth was leaving me, and not only the earth but
  the whole solar system was streaming past. And about me in space, invisible
  to me, scattered in the wake of the earth upon its journey, there must be an
  innumerable multitude of souls, stripped like myself of the material,
  stripped like myself of the passions of the individual and the generous
  emotions of the gregarious brute, naked intelligences, things of newborn
  wonder and thought, marvelling at the strange release that had suddenly come
  on them!</p>

  <p>As I receded faster and faster from the strange white sun in the black
  heavens, and from the broad and shining earth upon which my being had begun,
  I seemed to grow in some incredible manner vast: vast as regards this world I
  had left, vast as regards the moments and periods of a human life. Very soon
  I saw the full circle of the earth, slightly gibbous, like the moon when she
  nears her full, but very large; and the silvery shape of America was now in
  the noonday blaze wherein (as it seemed) little England had been basking but
  a few minutes ago. At first the earth was large, and shone in the heavens,
  filling a great part of them; but every moment she grew smaller and more
  distant. As she shrank, the broad moon in its third quarter crept into view
  over the rim of her disc. I looked for the constellations. Only that part of
  Aries directly behind the sun and the Lion, which the earth covered, were
  hidden. I recognised the tortuous, tattered band of the Milky Way with Vega
  very bright between sun and earth; and Sirius and Orion shone splendid
  against the unfathomable blackness in the opposite quarter of the heavens.
  The Pole Star was overhead, and the Great Bear hung over the circle of the
  earth. And away beneath and beyond the shining corona of the sun were strange
  groupings of stars I had never seen in my life&mdash;notably a dagger-shaped
  group that I knew for the Southern Cross. All these were no larger than when
  they had shone on earth, but the little stars that one scarce sees shone now
  against the setting of black vacancy as brightly as the first-magnitudes had
  done, while the larger worlds were points of indescribable glory and colour.
  Aldebaran was a spot of blood-red fire, and Sirius condensed to one point the
  light of innumerable sapphires. And they shone steadily: they did not
  scintillate, they were calmly glorious. My impressions had an adamantine
  hardness and brightness: there was no blurring softness, no atmosphere,
  nothing but infinite darkness set with the myriads of these acute and
  brilliant points and specks of light. Presently, when I looked again, the
  little earth seemed no bigger than the sun, and it dwindled and turned as I
  looked, until in a second's space (as it seemed to me), it was halved; and so
  it went on swiftly dwindling. Far away in the opposite direction, a little
  pinkish pin's head of light, shining steadily, was the planet Mars. I swam
  motionless in vacancy, and without a trace of terror or astonishment, watched
  the speck of cosmic dust, we call the world fall away from me.</p>

  <p>Presently it dawned upon me that my sense of duration had changed; that my
  mind was moving not faster but infinitely slower, that between each separate
  impression there was a period of many days. The moon spun once round the
  earth as I noted this; and I perceived clearly the motion of Mars in his
  orbit. Moreover, it appeared as if the time between thought and thought grew
  steadily greater, until at last a thousand years was but a moment in my
  perception.</p>

  <p>At first the constellations had shone motionless against the black
  background of infinite space; but presently it seemed as though the group of
  stars about Hercules and the Scorpion was contracting, while Orion and
  Aldebaran and their neighbours were scattering apart. Flashing suddenly out
  of the darkness there came a flying multitude of particles of rock,
  glittering like dust-specks in a sunbeam, and encompassed in a faintly
  luminous cloud. They swirled all about me, and vanished again in a twinkling
  far behind. And then I saw that a bright spot of light, that shone a little
  to one side of my path, was growing very rapidly larger, and perceived that
  it was the planet Saturn rushing towards me. Larger and larger it grew,
  swallowing up the heavens behind it, and hiding every moment a fresh
  multitude, of stars. I perceived its flattened, whirling body, its disc-like
  belt, and seven of its little satellites. It grew and grew, till it towered
  enormous; and then I plunged amid a streaming multitude of clashing stones
  and dancing dust-particles and gas-eddies, and saw for a moment the mighty
  triple belt like three concentric arches of moonlight above me, its shadow
  black on the boiling tumult below. These things happened in one-tenth of the
  time it takes to tell them. The planet went by like a flash of lightning; for
  a few seconds it blotted out the sun, and there and then became a mere black,
  dwindling, winged patch against the light. The earth, the mother mote of my
  being, I could no longer see.</p>

  <p>So with a stately swiftness, in the profoundest silence, the solar system
  fell from me as it had been a garment, until the sun was a mere star amid the
  multitude of stars, with its eddy of planet-specks lost in the confused
  glittering of the remoter light. I was no longer a denizen of the solar
  system: I had come to the outer Universe, I seemed to grasp and comprehend
  the whole world of matter. Ever more swiftly the stars closed in about the
  spot where Antares and Vega had vanished in a phosphorescent haze, until that
  part of the sky had the semblance of a whirling mass of nebulae, and ever
  before me yawned vaster gaps of vacant blackness, and the stars shone fewer
  and fewer. It seemed as if I moved towards a point between Orion's belt and
  sword; and the void about that region opened vaster and vaster every second,
  an incredible gulf of nothingness into which I was falling. Faster and ever
  faster the universe rushed by, a hurry of whirling motes at last, speeding
  silently into the void. Stars glowing brighter and brighter, with their
  circling planets catching the light in a ghostly fashion as I neared them,
  shone out and vanished again into inexistence; faint comets, clusters of
  meteorites, winking specks of matter, eddying light-points, whizzed past,
  some perhaps a hundred millions of miles or so from me at most, few nearer,
  travelling with unimaginable rapidity, shooting constellations, momentary
  darts of fire, through that black, enormous night. More than anything else it
  was like a dusty draught, sunbeam-lit. Broader and wider and deeper grew the
  starless space, the vacant Beyond, into which I was being drawn. At last a
  quarter of the heavens was black and blank, and the whole headlong rush of
  stellar universe closed in behind me like a veil of light that is gathered
  together. It drove away from me like a monstrous jack-o'-lantern driven by
  the wind. I had come out into the wilderness of space. Ever the vacant
  blackness grew broader, until the hosts of the stars seemed only like a swarm
  of fiery specks hurrying away from me, inconceivably remote, and the
  darkness, the nothingness and emptiness, was about me on every side. Soon the
  little universe of matter, the cage of points in which I had begun to be, was
  dwindling, now to a whirling disc of luminous glittering, and now to one
  minute disc of hazy light. In a little while it would shrink to a point, and
  at last would vanish altogether.</p>

  <p>Suddenly feeling came back to me&mdash;feeling in the shape of
  overwhelming terror; such a dread of those dark vastitudes as no words can
  describe, a passionate resurgence of sympathy and social desire. Were there
  other souls, invisible to me as I to them, about me in the blackness? Or was
  I indeed, even as I felt, alone? Had I passed out of being into something
  that was neither being nor not-being? The covering of the body, the covering
  of matter, had been torn from me, and the hallucinations of companionship and
  security. Everything was black and silent. I had ceased to be. I was nothing.
  There was nothing, save only that infinitesimal dot of light that dwindled in
  the gulf. I strained myself to hear and see, and for a while there was naught
  but infinite silence, intolerable darkness, horror, and despair.</p>

  <p>Then I saw that about the spot of light into which the whole world of
  matter had shrunk there was a faint glow. And in a band on either side of
  that the darkness was not absolute. I watched it for ages, as it seemed to
  me, and through the long waiting the haze grew imperceptibly more distinct.
  And then about the band appeared an irregular cloud of the faintest, palest
  brown. I felt a passionate impatience; but the things grew brighter so slowly
  that they scarce seemed to change. What was unfolding itself? What was this
  strange reddish dawn in the interminable night of space?</p>

  <p>The cloud's shape was grotesque. It seemed to be looped along its lower
  side into four projecting masses, and above, it ended in a straight line.
  What phantom was it? I felt assured I had seen that figure before; but I
  could not think what, nor where, nor when it was. Then the realisation rushed
  upon me. It was a clenched Hand. I was alone in space, alone with this huge,
  shadowy Hand, upon which the whole Universe of Matter lay like an
  unconsidered speck of dust. It seemed as though I watched it through vast
  periods of time. On the forefinger glittered a ring; and the universe from
  which I had come was but a spot of light upon the ring's curvature. And the
  thing that the hand gripped had the likeness of a black rod. Through a long
  eternity I watched this Hand, with the ring and the rod, marvelling and
  fearing and waiting helplessly on what might follow. It seemed as though
  nothing could follow: that I should watch for ever, seeing only the Hand and
  the thing it held, and understanding nothing of its import. Was the whole
  universe but a refracting speck upon some greater Being? Were our worlds but
  the atoms of another universe, and those again of another, and so on through
  an endless progression? And what was I? Was I indeed immaterial? A vague
  persuasion of a body gathering about me came into my suspense. The abysmal
  darkness about the Hand filled with impalpable suggestions, with uncertain,
  fluctuating shapes.</p>

  <p>Came a sound, like the sound of a tolling bell: faint, as if infinitely
  far; muffled, as though heard through thick swathings of darkness: a deep,
  vibrating resonance, with vast gulfs of silence between each stroke. And the
  Hand appeared to tighten on the rod. And I saw far above the Hand, towards
  the apex of the darkness, a circle of dim phosphorescence, a ghostly sphere
  whence these sounds came throbbing; and at the last stroke the Hand vanished,
  for the hour had come, and I heard a noise of many waters. But the black rod
  remained as a great band across the sky. And then a voice, which seemed to
  run to the uttermost parts of space, spoke, saying, "There will be no more
  pain."</p>

  <p>At that an almost intolerable gladness and radiance rushed in upon me, and
  I saw the circle shining white and bright, and the rod black and shining, and
  many things else distinct and clear. And the circle was the face of the
  clock, and the rod the rail of my bed. Haddon was standing at the foot,
  against the rail, with a small pair of scissors on his fingers; and the hands
  of my clock on the mantel over his shoulder were clasped together over the
  hour of twelve. Mowbray was washing something in a basin at the octagonal
  table, and at my side I felt a subdued feeling that could scarce be spoken of
  as pain.</p>

  <p>The operation had not killed me. And I perceived, suddenly, that the dull
  melancholy of half a year was lifted from my mind.</p>

     name="story28">THE RED ROOM</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Idler</i>, March 1896<br>
  Also published as "The Ghost of Fear"</h3>

  <p>"I can assure you," said I, "that it will take a very tangible ghost to
  frighten me." And I stood up before the fire with my glass in my hand.</p>

  <p>"It is your own choosing," said the man with the withered arm, and glanced
  at me askance.</p>

  <p>"Eight-and-twenty years," said I, "I have lived, and never a ghost have I
  seen as yet."</p>

  <p>The old woman sat staring hard into the fire, her pale ayes wide open.
  "Ay," she broke in; "and eight-and-twenty years you have lived and never seen
  the likes of this house, I reckon. There's a many things to see, when one's
  still but eight-and-twenty." She swayed her head slowly from side to side. "A
  many things to see and sorrow for."</p>

  <p>I half suspected the old people were trying to enhance the spiritual
  terrors of their house by their droning insistence. I put down my empty glass
  on the table and looked about the room, and caught a glimpse of myself,
  abbreviated and broadened to an impossible sturdiness, in the queer old
  mirror at the end of the room. "Well," I said, "if I see anything tonight, I
  shall be so much the wiser. For I come to the business with an open
  mind."</p>

  <p>"It's your own choosing," said the man, with the withered arm, once
  more.</p>

  <p>I heard the sound of a stick and a shambling step on the flags in the
  passage outside, and the door creaked on its hinges as a second old man
  entered, more bent, more wrinkled, more aged even than the first. He
  supported himself by a single crutch, his eyes were covered by a shade, and
  his lower lip, half averted, hung pale and pink from his decaying yellow
  teeth. He made straight for an armchair on the opposite side of the table,
  sat down clumsily, and began to cough. The man with the withered arm gave
  this new-comer a short glance of positive dislike; the old woman took no
  notice of his arrival, but remained with her eyes fixed steadily on the
  fire.</p>

  <p>"I said&mdash;it's your own choosing," said the man with the withered arm,
  when the coughing had ceased for a while.</p>

  <p>"It's my own choosing," I answered.</p>

  <p>The man with the shade became aware of my presence for the first time, and
  threw his head back for a moment and sideways, to see me. I caught a
  momentary glimpse of his eyes, small and bright and inflamed. Then he began
  to cough and splutter again.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you drink?" said the man with the withered arm, pushing the
  beer towards him. The man with the shade, poured out a glassful with a shaky
  arm that splashed half as much again on the deal table. A monstrous shadow of
  him crouched upon the wall and mocked his action as he poured and drank. I
  must confess I had scarce expected these grotesque custodians. There is to my
  mind something inhuman in senility, something crouching and atavistic; the
  human qualities seem to drop from old people insensibly day by day. The three
  of them made me feel uncomfortable, with their gaunt silences, their bent
  carriage, their evident unfriendliness to me and to one another.</p>

  <p>"If," said I, "you will show me to this haunted room of yours, I will make
  myself comfortable there."</p>

  <p>The old man with the cough jerked his head back so suddenly that it
  startled me, and shot another glance of his red eyes at me from under the
  shade; but no one answered me. I waited a minute, glancing from one to the
  other.</p>

  <p>"If," I said a little louder, "if you will show me to this haunted room of
  yours, I will relieve you from the task of entertaining me."</p>

  <p>"There's a candle on the slab outside the door," said the man with the
  withered arm, looking at my feet as he addressed me. "But if you go to the
  red room to-night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>("This night of all nights!" said the old woman.)</p>

  <p>"You go alone."</p>

  <p>"Very well," I answered. "And which way do I go?"</p>

  <p>"You go along the passage for a bit," said he, "until you come to a door,
  and through that is a spiral staircase, and halfway up that is a landing and
  another door covered with baize. Go through that and down the long corridor
  to the end, and the red room is on your left up the steps."</p>

  <p>"Have I got that right?" I said, and repeated his directions. He corrected
  me in one particular.</p>

  <p>"And are you really going?" said the man with the shade, looking at me
  again for the third time, with that queer, unnatural tilting of the face.</p>

  <p>("This night of all nights!" said the old woman.)</p>

  <p>"It is what I came for," I said, and moved towards the door. As I did so,
  the old man with the shade rose and staggered round the table, so as to be
  closer to the others and to the fire. At the door I turned and looked at
  them, and saw they were all close together, dark against the firelight,
  staring at me over their shoulders, with an intent expression on their
  ancient faces.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," I said, setting the door open.</p>

  <p>"It's your own choosing," said the man with the withered arm.</p>

  <p>I left the door wide open until the candle was well alight, and then I
  shut them in and walked down the chilly, echoing passage.</p>

  <p>I must confess that the oddness of these three old pensioners in whose
  charge her ladyship had left the castle, and the deep-toned, old-fashioned
  furniture of the housekeeper's room in which they foregathered, affected me
  in spite of my efforts to keep myself at a matter-of-fact phase. They seemed
  to belong to another age, an older age, an age when things spiritual were
  different from this of ours, less certain; an age when omens and witches were
  credible, and ghosts beyond denying. Their very existence was spectral; the
  cut of their clothing, fashions born in dead brains. The ornaments and
  conveniences of the room about them were ghostly&mdash;the thoughts of
  vanished men, which still haunted, rather than participated in the world of
  to-day. But with an effort I sent such thoughts to the right-about. The long,
  draughty subterranean passage was chilly and dusty, and my candle flared and
  made the shadows cower and quiver. The echoes rang up and down the spiral
  staircase, and a shadow came sweeping up after me, and one fled before me
  into the darkness overhead. I came to the landing and stopped there for a
  moment, listening to a rustling that I fancied I heard; then, satisfied of
  the absolute silence, I pushed open the baize-covered door and stood in the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>The effect was scarcely what I expected, for the moonlight, coming in by
  the great window on the grand staircase, picked out everything in vivid black
  shadow or silvery illumination. Everything was in its place: the house might
  have been deserted on the yesterday instead of eighteen months ago. There
  were candles in the sockets of the sconces, and whatever dust had gathered on
  the carpets or upon the polished flooring was distributed so evenly as to be
  invisible in the moonlight. I was about to advance, and stopped abruptly. A
  bronze group stood upon the landing, hidden from me by the corner of the
  wall, but its shadow fell with marvellous distinctness upon the white
  panelling, and gave me the impression of someone crouching to waylay me. I
  stood rigid for half a minute perhaps. Then, with my hand in the pocket that
  held my revolver, I advanced, only to discover a Ganymede and Eagle
  glistening in the moonlight. That incident for at time restored my nerve, and
  a procelain Chinaman on a buhl table, whose head rocked silently as I passed
  him, scarcely startled me.</p>

  <p>The door to the red room and the steps up to it were in a shadowy corner.
  I moved my candle from side to side, in order to see clearly the nature of
  the recess in which I stood before opening the door. Here it was, thought I,
  that my predecessor was found, and the memory of that story gave me a sudden
  twinge of apprehension. I glanced over my shoulder at the Ganymede in the
  moonlight, and opened the door of the red room rather hastily, with my face
  half turned to the pallid silence of the landing.</p>

  <p>I entered, closed the door behind me at once, turned the key I found in
  the lock within, and stood with the candle held aloft, surveying the scene of
  my vigil, the great red room of Lorraine Castle, in which the young duke had
  died. Or rather, in which he had begun his dying, for he had opened the door
  and fallen headlong down the steps I had just ascended. That had been the end
  of his vigil, of his gallant attempt to conquer the ghostly tradition of the
  place; and never, I thought, had apoplexy better served the ends of
  superstition. And there were other and older stories that clung to the room,
  back to the half-credible beginning of it all, the tale of a timid wife and
  the tragic end that came to her husband's jest of frightening her. And
  looking around that large shadowy room, with its shadowy window bays, its
  recesses and alcoves, one could well understand the legends that had sprouted
  in its black corners, its germinating darkness. My candle was a little tongue
  of flame in its vastness, that failed to pierce the opposite end of the room,
  and left an ocean of mystery and suggestion beyond its island of light.</p>

  <p>I resolved to make a systematic examination of the place at once, and
  dispel the fanciful suggestions of its obscurity before they obtained a hold
  upon me. After satisfying myself of the fastening of the door, I began to
  walk about the room, peering round each article of furniture, tucking up the
  valances of the bed, and opening its curtains wide. I pulled up the blinds
  and examined the fastenings of the several windows before closing the
  shutters, leant forward and looked up the blackness of the wide chimney, and
  tapped the dark oak panelling for any secret opening. There were two big
  mirrors in the room, each with a pair of sconces bearing candles, and on the
  mantelshelf too, were more candles in china candlesticks. All these I lit one
  after the other. The fire was laid&mdash;, an unexpected consideration from
  the old housekeeper&mdash;, and I lit it, to keep down any disposition to
  shiver, and when it was burning well, I stood round with my back to it and
  regarded the room again. I had pulled up a chintz-covered armchair and a
  table, to form a kind of barricade before me, and on this lay my revolver
  ready to hand. My precise examination had done me good, but I still found the
  remoter darkness of the place, and its perfect stillness, too stimulating for
  the imagination. The echoing of the stir and crackling of the fire was no
  sort of comfort to me. The shadow in the alcove at the end in particular had
  that undefinable quality of a presence, that odd suggestion of a lurking,
  living thing, that comes so easily in silence and solitude. At last, to
  reassure myself, I walked with a candle into it, and satisfied myself that
  there was nothing tangible there. I stood that candle upon the floor of the
  alcove, and left it in that position.</p>

  <p>By this time I was in a state of considerable nervous tension, although to
  my reason there was no adequate cause for the condition. My mind, however,
  was perfectly clear. I postulated quite unreservedly that nothing
  supernatural could happen, and to pass the time I began to string some rhymes
  together, Ingoldsby fashion, of the original legend of the place. A few I
  spoke aloud, but the echoes were not pleasant. For the same reason I also
  abandoned, after a time, a conversation with myself upon the impossibility of
  ghosts and haunting. My mind reverted to the three old and distorted people
  downstairs, and I tried to keep it upon that topic. The sombre reds and
  blacks of the room troubled me; even with seven candles the place was merely
  dim. The one in the alcove flared in a draught, and the fire-flickering kept
  the shadows and penumbra perpetually shifting and stirring. Casting about for
  a remedy, I recalled the candles I had seen in the passage, and, with a
  slight effort, walked out into the moonlight, carrying a candle and leaving
  the door open, and presently returned with as many as ten. These I put in
  various knick-knacks of china with which the room was sparsely adorned, lit
  and placed where the shadows had lain deepest, some on the floor, some in the
  window recesses, until at last my seventeen candles were so arranged that not
  an inch of the room darkened, but had the direct light of at least one of
  them. It occurred to me that when the ghost came, I could warn him not to
  trip over them. The room was now quite brightly illuminated. There was
  something very cheery and reassuring in these little streaming flames, and
  snuffing them gave me an occupation, and afforded a helpful sense of the
  passage of time. Even with that however, the brooding expectation of the
  vigil weighed heavily upon me. It was after midnight that the candle in the
  alcove suddenly went out, and the black shadow sprang back to its place. I
  did not see the candle go out; I simply turned and saw that the darkness was
  there, as one might start and see the unexpected presence of a stranger. "By
  Jove!" said I aloud; "That draught's a strong one!" and taking the matches
  from the table, I walked across the room in a leisurely manner to relight the
  corner again. My first match would not strike, and as I succeeded with the
  second, something seemed to blink on the wall before me. I turned my head
  involuntarily, and saw that the two candles on the little table by the
  fireplace were extinguished. I rose at once to my feet.</p>

  <p>"Odd!" I said. "Did I do that myself in a flash of absent-mindedness?"</p>

  <p>I walked back, relit one, and as I did so, I saw the candle in the right
  sconce of one of the mirrors wink and go right out, and almost immediately
  its companion followed it. There was no mistake about it. The flame vanished,
  as if the wicks had been suddenly nipped between a finger and thumb, leaving
  the wick neither glowing nor smoking, but black. While I stood gaping, the
  candle at the foot of the bed went out, and the shadows seemed to take
  another step towards me.</p>

  <p>"This won't do!" said I, and first one and then another candle on the
  mantelshelf followed. "What's up?" I cried, with a queer high note getting
  into my voice somehow. At that the candle on the wardrobe went out, and the
  one I had relit in the alcove followed.</p>

  <p>"Steady on!" I said. "These candles are wanted," speaking with a half-
  hysterical facetiousness, and scratching away at a match, all the while, for
  the mantel candlesticks. My hands trembled so much that twice I missed the
  rough paper of the matchbox. As the mantel emerged from darkness again, two
  candles in the remoter end of the window were eclipsed. But with the same
  match I also relit the larger mirror candles, and those on the floor near the
  doorway, so that for the moment I seemed to gain on the extinctions. But then
  in a volley there vanished four lights at once in different corners of the
  room, and I struck another match in quivering haste, and stood hesitating
  whither to take it.</p>

  <p>As I stood undecided, an invisible hand seemed to sweep out the two
  candles on the table. With a cry of terror, I dashed at the alcove, then into
  the corner, and then into the window, relighting three, as two more vanished
  by the fireplace; then, perceiving a better way, I dropped the matches on the
  iron-bound deed-box in the corner, and caught up the bedroom candlestick.
  With this I avoided the delay of striking matches; but for all that the
  steady process of extinction went on, and the shadows I feared and fought
  against returned, and crept in upon me, first a step gained on this side of
  me and then on that. It was like a ragged storm-cloud sweeping out of the
  stars. Now and then one returned for a minute, and was lost again. I was now
  almost frantic with the horror of the coming darkness, and my self-possession
  deserted me. I leaped panting and dishevelled from candle to candle in a vain
  struggle against that remorseless advance.</p>

  <p>I bruised myself on the thigh against the table, I sent a chair headlong,
  I stumbled and fell and whisked the cloth from the table in my fall. My
  candle rolled away from me, and I snatched another as I rose. Abruptly this
  was blown out, as I swung it off the table, by the wind of my sudden
  movement, and immediately the two remaining candles followed. But there was
  light still in the room, a red light that stayed off the shadows from me. The
  fire! Of course I could still thrust my candle between the bars and relight
  it!</p>

  <p>I turned to where the flames were still dancing between the glowing coals,
  and splashing red reflections upon the furniture, made two steps towards the
  grate, and incontinently the flames dwindled and vanished, the glow vanished,
  the reflections rushed together and vanished, and as I thrust the candle
  between the bars darkness closed upon me like the shutting of an eye, wrapped
  about me in a stifling embrace, sealed my vision, and crushed the last
  vestiges of reason from my brain. The candle fell from my hand. I flung out
  my arms in a vain effort to thrust that ponderous blackness away from me,
  and, lifting up my voice, screamed with all my might&mdash;once, twice,
  thrice. Then I think I must have staggered to my feet. I know I thought
  suddenly of the moonlit corridor and, with my head bowed and my arms over my
  face, made a run for the door.</p>

  <p>But I had forgotten the exact position of the door, and struck myself
  heavily against the corner of the bed. I staggered back, turned, and was
  either struck or struck myself against some other bulky furniture. I have a
  vague memory of battering myself thus, to and fro in the darkness, of a
  cramped struggle, and of my own wild crying as I darted to and fro, of a
  heavy blow at last upon my forehead, a horrible sensation of falling that
  lasted an age, of my last frantic effort to keep my footing, and then I
  remember no more.</p>

  <p>I opened my eyes in daylight. My head was roughly bandaged, and the man
  with the withered arm was watching my face. I looked about me, trying to
  remember what had happened, and for a space I could not recollect. I turned
  to the corner, and saw the old woman, no longer abstracted, pouring out some
  drops of medicine from a little blue phial into a glass. "Where am I?" I
  asked; "I seem to remember you, and yet I cannot remember who you are."</p>

  <p>They told me then, and I heard of the haunted red room as one who hears a
  tale. "We found you at dawn," said he, "and there was blood on your forehead
  and lips."</p>

  <p>It was very slowly I recovered my memory of my experience. "You believe
  now," said the old man, "that the room is haunted?" He spoke no longer as one
  who greets an intruder, but as one who grieves for a broken friend.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I; "the room is haunted."</p>

  <p>"And you have seen it. And we, who have lived here all our lives, have
  never set eyes upon it. Because we have never dared... Tell us, is it truly
  the old earl who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No," said I; "it is not."</p>

  <p>"I told you so," said the old lady, with the glass in her hand. "It is his
  poor young countess who was frightened&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is not," I said. "There is neither ghost of earl nor ghost of countess
  in that room, there is no ghost there at all; but worse, far
  worse&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?" they said.</p>

  <p>"The worst of all the things that haunt poor mortal man," said I; "and
  that is, in all its nakedness&mdash;Fear! Fear that will not have light nor
  sound, that will not bear with reason, that deafens and darkens and
  overwhelms. It followed me through the corridor, it fought against me in the
  room&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I stopped abruptly. There was an interval of silence. My hand went up to
  my bandages.</p>

  <p>Then the man with the shade sighed and spoke. "That is it," said he. "I
  knew that was it. A power of darkness. To put such a curse upon a woman! It
  lurks there always. You can feel it even in the daytime, even of a bright
  summer's day, in the hangings, in the curtains, keeping behind you however
  you face about. In the dusk it creeps along the corridor and follows you, so
  that you dare not turn. There is Fear in that room of hers&mdash;black Fear,
  and there will be&mdash;so long as this house of sin endures."</p>

     name="story29">THE PLATTNER STORY</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The New Review</i>, April 1896</h3>

  <p>Whether the story of Gottfried Plattner is to be credited or not, is a
  pretty question in the value of evidence. On the one hand, we have seven
  witnesses&mdash;to be perfectly exact, we have six and a half pairs of eyes,
  and one undeniable fact; and on the other we have&mdash;what is it&mdash;?
  Prejudice, common sense, the inerore part of the story is the worthy
  Gottfried's contribution (for I count him as one of the seven). Heaven forbid
  that I should be led into giving countenance to superstition by a passion for
  impartiality, and so come to share the fate of Eusapia's patrons! Frankly, I
  believe there is something crooked about this business of Gottfried Plattner;
  but what that crooked factor is, I will admit as frankly, I do not know. I
  have been surprised at the credit accorded to the story in the most
  unexpected and authoritative quarters. The fairest way to the reader, however
  will be for me to tell it without further comment.</p>

  <p>Gottfried Plattner is, in spite of his name, a free-born Englishman. His
  father was an Alsatian who came to England in the Sixties, married a
  respectable English girl of unexceptionable antecedents, and died, after a
  wholesome and uneventful life (devoted, I understand, chiefly to the laying
  of parquet flooring), in 1887. Gottfried's age is seven-and-twenty. He is, by
  virtue of his heritage of three languages, Modern Languages Master in a small
  private school in the South of England. To the casual observer he is
  singularly like any other Modern Languages Master in any other small private
  school. His costume is neither very costly nor very fashionable, but on the
  other hand it is not markedly cheap or shabby; his complexion, like his
  height and his bearing, is inconspicuous. You would notice, perhaps that,
  like the majority of people, his face was not absolutely symmetrical, his
  right eye a little larger than the left, and his jaw a trifle heavier on the
  right side. If you, as an ordinary careless person, were to bare his chest
  and feel his heart beating, you would probably find it quite like the heart
  of any one else. But here you and the trained observer would part company. If
  you found his heart quite ordinary, the trained observer would find it quite
  otherwise. And once the thing was pointed out to you, you too would perceive
  the peculiarity easily enough. It is that Gottfried's heart beats on the
  right side of his body.</p>

  <p>Now, that is not the only singularity of Gottfried's structure, although
  it is the only one that would appeal to the untrained mind. Careful sounding
  of Gottfried's internal arrangements, by a well-known surgeon, seems to point
  to the fact that all the other unsymmetrical parts of his body are similarly
  misplaced. The right lobe of his liver is on the left side, the left on his
  right; while his lungs too, are similarly contraposed. What is still more
  singular, unless Gottfried is a consummate actor, we must believe that his
  right hand has recently become his left. Since the occurrences we are about
  to consider (as impartially as possible), he has found the utmost difficulty
  in writing, except from right to left across the paper with his left hand. He
  cannot throw with his right hand, he is perplexed at meal times between knife
  and fork, and his ideas of the rule of the road&mdash;he is a
  cyclist&mdash;are still a dangerous confusion. And there is not a scrap of
  evidence to show that before these occurrences Gottfried was at all
  left-handed. There is yet another wonderful fact in this preposterous
  business. Gottfried produces three photographs of himself. You have him at
  the age of five or six, thrusting fat legs at you from under a plaid frock,
  and scowling. In that photograph his left eye is a little larger than his
  right, and his jaw is a trifle heavier on the left side. This is the reverse
  of his present living conditions: The photograph of Gottfried at fourteen
  seems to contradict these facts, but that is because it is one of those cheap
  "Gem" photographs that were then in vogue, taken direct upon metal, and
  therefore reversing things just as a looking-glass would. A third photograph
  represents him at one-and-twenty and confirms the record of the others. There
  seems here evidence of the strongest confirmatory character that Gottfried
  has exchanged his left side for his right. Yet how a human being can be so
  changed, short of a fantastic and pointless miracle, it is exceedingly hard
  to suggest.</p>

  <p>In one way, of course, these facts might be explicable on the supposition
  that Plattner has undertaken an elaborate mystification, on the strength of
  his heart's displacement. Photographs may be fudged, and left-handedness
  imitated. But the character of the man does not lend itself to any such
  theory. He is quiet, practical, unobtrusive and thoroughly sane, from the
  Nordau standpoint. He likes beer, and smokes moderately, takes walking
  exercise daily, and has a healthily high estimate of the value of his
  teaching. He has a good but untrained tenor voice, and takes a pleasure in
  singing airs of a popular and cheerful character. He is fond, but not
  morbidly fond, of reading&mdash;, chiefly fiction pervaded with a vaguely
  pious optimism&mdash;, sleeps well, and rarely dreams. He is in fact, the
  very last person to evolve a fantastic fable. Indeed, so far from forcing
  this story upon the world, he has been singularly reticent on the matter. He
  meets enquirers with a certain engaging&mdash;bashfulness is almost the word,
  that disarms the most suspicious. He seems genuinely ashamed that anything so
  unusual has occurred to him.</p>

  <p>It is to be regretted that Plattner's aversion to the idea of post-mortem
  dissection may postpone, perhaps for ever, the positive proof that his entire
  body has had its left and right sides transposed. Upon that fact mainly the
  credibility of his story hangs. There is no way of taking a man and moving
  him about in space, as ordinary people understand space, that will result in
  our changing his sides. Whatever you do, his right is still his right, his
  left his left. You can do that with a perfectly thin and flat thing, of
  course. If you were to cut a figure out of paper, any figure with a right and
  left side, you could change its sides simply by lifting it up and turning it
  over. But with a solid it is different. Mathematical theorists tell us that
  the only way in which the right and left sides of a solid body can be changed
  is by taking that body clean out of space as we know it&mdash;, taking it out
  of ordinary existence, that is, and turning it somewhere outside space. This
  is a little abstruse, no doubt, but any one with any knowledge of
  mathematical theory will assure the reader of its truth. To put the thing in
  technical language, the curious inversion of Plattner's right and left sides
  is proof that he has moved out of our space into what is called the Fourth
  Dimension, and that he has returned again to our world. Unless we choose to
  consider ourselves the victims of an elaborate and motiveless fabrication, we
  are almost bound to believe that this has occurred.</p>

  <p>So much for the tangible facts. We come now to the account of the
  phenomena that attended his temporary disappearance from the world. It
  appears that in the Sussexville Proprietary School Plattner not only
  discharged the duties of Modern Languages Master, but also taught chemistry,
  commercial geography, book-keeping, shorthand, drawing, and any other
  additional subject to which the changing fancies of the boys' parents might
  direct attention. He knew little or nothing of these various subjects, but in
  secondary as distinguished from Board or elementary schools, knowledge in the
  teacher is, very properly, by no means so necessary as high moral character
  and gentlemanly tone. In chemistry he was particularly deficient, knowing he
  says, nothing beyond the Three Gases (whatever the three gases may be). As
  however, his pupils began by knowing nothing, and derived all their
  information from him, this caused him (or any one) but little inconvenience
  for several terms. Then a little boy named Whibble joined the school, who had
  been educated (it seems) by some mischievous relative into an enquiring habit
  of mind. This little boy followed Plattner's lessons with marked and
  sustained interest, and in order to exhibit his zeal on the subject, brought
  at various times, substances for Plattner to analyse. Plattner, flattered by
  this evidence of his power of awakening interest, and trusting to the boy's
  ignorance, analysed these, and even made general statements as to their
  composition. Indeed he was so far stimulated by his pupil as to obtain a work
  upon analytical chemistry and study it during his supervision of the
  evening's preparation. He was surprised to find chemistry quite an
  interesting subject.</p>

  <p>So far the story is absolutely commonplace. But now the greenish powder
  comes upon the scene. The source of that greenish powder seems, unfortunately
  lost. Master Whibble tells a tortuous story of finding it done up in a packet
  in a disused limekiln near the Downs. It would have been an excellent thing
  for Plattner, and possibly for Master Whibble's family, if a match could have
  been applied to that powder there and then. The young gentleman certainly did
  not bring it to school in a packet, but in a common eight-ounce graduated
  medicine bottle, plugged with masticated newspaper. He gave it to Plattner at
  the end of the afternoon school. Four boys had been detained after school
  prayers in order to complete some neglected tasks, and Plattner was
  supervising these in the small classroom in which the chemical teaching was
  conducted. The appliances for the practical teaching of chemistry in the
  Sussexville Proprietary School, as in most small schools in this country, are
  characterised by a severe simplicity. They are kept in a small cupboard
  standing in a recess, and having about the same capacity as a common
  travelling trunk. Plattner, being bored with his passive superintendence,
  seems to have welcomed the intervention of Whibble with his green powder as
  an agreeable diversion, and unlocking this cupboard, proceeded at once with
  his analytical experiments. Whibble sat, luckily for himself, at a safe
  distance, regarding him. The four malefactors, feigning a profound absorption
  in their work, watched him furtively with the keenest interest. For even
  within the limits of the Three Gases, Plattner's practical chemistry was, I
  understand, temerarious.</p>

  <p>They are practically unanimous in their account of Plattner's proceedings.
  He poured a little of the green powder into a test-tube, and tried the
  substance with water, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and sulphuric acid in
  succession. Getting no result, he emptied out a little heap&mdash;nearly half
  the bottleful, in fact&mdash;upon a slate and tried a match. He held the
  medicine bottle in his left hand. The stuff began to smoke and melt, and then
  &mdash;exploded with deafening violence and a blinding flash.</p>

  <p>The five boys, seeing the flash and being prepared for catastrophes,
  ducked below their desks, and were none of them seriously hurt. The window
  was blown out into the playground, and the blackboard on its easel was upset.
  The slate was smashed to atoms. Some plaster fell from the ceiling. No other
  damage was done to the school edifice or appliances, and the boys at first,
  seeing nothing of Plattner, fancied he was knocked down and lying out of
  their sight below the desks. They jumped out of their places to go to his
  assistance, and were amazed to find the space empty. Being still confused by
  the sudden violence of the report, they hurried to the open door, under the
  impression that he must have been hurt, and have rushed out of the room. But
  Carson, the foremost, nearly collided in the doorway with the principal, Mr.
  Lidgett.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lidgett is a corpulent, excitable man with one eye. The boys describe
  him as stumbling into the room mouthing some of those tempered expletives
  irritable schoolmasters accustom themselves to use&mdash;lest worse befall.
  "Wretched mumchancer!" he said. "Where's Mr. Plattner?" The boys are agreed
  on the very words. ("Wobbler," "snivelling puppy," and "mumchancer" are, it
  seems, among the ordinary small change of Mr. Lidgett's scholastic
  commerce.)</p>

  <p>Where's Mr. Plattner? That was a question that was to be repeated many
  times in the next few days. It really seemed as though that frantic
  hyperbole, "blown to atoms," had for once realise itself. There was not a
  visible particle of Plattner to be seen; not a drop of blood nor a stitch of
  clothing to be found. Apparently he had been blown clean out of existence and
  left not a wrack behind. Not so much as would cover a sixpenny piece, to
  quote a proverbial expression! The evidence of his absolute disappearance, as
  a consequence of that explosion, is indubitable.</p>

  <p>It is not necessary to enlarge here upon the commotion excited in the
  Sussexville Proprietary School, and in Sussexville and elsewhere, by this
  event. It is quite possible indeed, that some of the readers of these pages
  may recall the hearing of some remote and dying version of that excitement
  during the last summer holidays. Lidgett, it would seem, did everything in
  his power to suppress and minimise the story. He instituted a penalty of
  twenty-five lines for any mention of Plattner's name among the boys, and
  stated in the schoolroom that he was clearly aware of his assistant's
  whereabouts. He was afraid, he explains, that the possibility of an explosion
  happening, in spite of the elaborate precautions taken to minimise the
  practical teaching of chemistry, might injure the reputation of the school;
  and so might any mysterious quality in Plattner's departure. Indeed, he did
  everything in his power to make the occurrence seem as ordinary as possible.
  In particular, he cross-examined the five eye-witnesses of the occurrence so
  searchingly that they began to doubt the plain evidence of their senses. But
  in spite of these efforts, the tale, in a magnified and distorted state, made
  a nine days' wonder in the district, and several parents withdrew their sons
  on colourable pretexts. Not the least remarkable point in the matter is the
  fact that a large number of people in the neighbourhood dreamed singularly
  vivid dreams of Plattner during the period of excitement before his return,
  and that these dreams had a curious uniformity. In almost all of them
  Plattner was seen, sometimes singly, sometimes in company, wandering about
  through a coruscating iridescence. In all cases his face was pale and
  distressed, and in some he gesticulated towards the dreamer. One or two of
  the boys, evidently under the influence of nightmare, fancied that Plattner
  approached them with remarkable swiftness, and seemed to look closely into
  their very eyes. Others fled with Plattner from the pursuit of vague and
  extraordinary creatures of a globular shape. But all these fancies were
  forgotten in enquiries and speculations when, on the Wednesday next, but one
  after the Monday of the explosion, Plattner returned.</p>

  <p>The circumstances of his return were as singular as those of his
  departure. So far as Mr. Lidgett's somewhat choleric outline can be filled in
  from Plattner's hesitating statements, it would appear that on Wednesday
  evening, towards the hour of sunset, the former gentleman, having dismissed
  evening preparation, was engaged in his garden, picking and eating
  strawberries, a fruit of which he is inordinately fond. It is a large old-
  fashioned garden, secured from observation fortunately, by a high and ivy-
  covered red-brick wall. Just as he was stooping over a particularly prolific
  plant, there was a flash in the air and a heavy thud, and before he could
  look round, some heavy body struck him violently from behind. He was pitched
  forward, crushing the strawberries he held in his hand, and that so roughly,
  that his silk hat&mdash;Mr. Lidgett adheres to the older ideas of scholastic
  costume&mdash;was driven violently down upon his forehead, and almost over
  one eye. This heavy missile, which slid over him sideways and collapsed into
  a sitting posture among the strawberry plants, proved to be our long-lost Mr.
  Gottfried Plattner, in an extremely dishevelled condition. He was collarless
  and hatless, his linen was dirty, and there was blood upon his hands. Mr.
  Lidgett was so indignant and surprised that he remained on all-fours, and
  with his hat jammed down on his eye, while he expostulated vehemently with
  Plattner for his disrespectful and unaccountable conduct.</p>

  <p>This scarcely idyllic scene completes what I may call the exterior version
  of the Plattner story&mdash;its exoteric aspect. It is quite unnecessary to
  enter here into all the details of his dismissal by Mr. Lidgett. Such
  details, with the full names and dates and references, will be found in the
  larger report of these occurrences that was laid before the Society for the
  Investigation of Abnormal Phenomena. The singular transposition of Plattner's
  right and left sides was scarcely observed for the first day or so, and then
  first in connection with his disposition to write from right to left across
  the blackboard. He concealed rather than ostended this curious confirmatory
  circumstance, as he considered it would unfavourably affect his prospects in
  a new situation. The displacement of his heart was discovered some months
  after, when he was having a tooth extracted under anaesthetics. He then, very
  unwillingly, allowed a cursory surgical examination to be made of himself,
  with a view to a brief account in the "Journal of Anatomy." That exhausts the
  statement of the material facts; and we may now go on to consider Plattner's
  account of the matter.</p>

  <p>But first let us clearly differentiate between the preceding portion of
  this story and what is to follow. All I have told thus far is established by
  such evidence as even a criminal lawyer would approve. Every one of the
  witnesses is still alive; the reader, if he have the leisure, may hunt the
  lads out to-morrow, or even brave the terrors of the redoubtable Lidgett, and
  cross-examine and trap and test to his heart's content; Gottfried Plattner
  himself, and his twisted heart and his three photographs are producible. It
  may be taken as proved that he did disappear for nine days as the consequence
  of an explosion; that he returned almost as violently, under circumstances in
  their nature annoying to Mr. Lidgett, whatever the details of those
  circumstances may be; and that he returned inverted, just as a reflection
  returns from a mirror. From the last fact, as I have already stated, it
  follows almost inevitably that Plattner, during those nine days, must have
  been in some state of existence altogether out of space. The evidence to
  these statements is indeed, far stronger than that upon which most murderers
  are hanged. But for his own particular account of where he had been, with its
  confused explanations and well-nigh self-contradictory details, we have only
  Mr. Gottfried Plattner's word. I do not wish to discredit that, but I must
  point out&mdash;what so many writers upon obscure psychic phenomena fail to
  do&mdash;that we are passing here from the practically undeniable to that
  kind of matter which any reasonable man is entitled to believe or reject as
  he thinks proper. The previous statements render it plausible; its
  discordance with common experience tilts it towards the incredible. I would
  prefer not to sway the beam of the reader's judgment either way, but simply
  to tell the story as Plattner told it me. He gave me his narrative, I may
  state, at my house at Chislehurst, and so soon as he had left me that
  evening, I went into my study and wrote down everything as I remembered it.
  Subsequently he was good enough to read over a type-written copy, so that its
  substantial correctness is undeniable.</p>

  <p>He states that at the moment of the explosion he distinctly thought he was
  killed. He felt lifted off his feet and driven forcibly backward. It is a
  curious fact for psychologists that he thought clearly during his backward
  flight, and wondered whether he should hit the chemistry cupboard or the
  blackboard easel. His heels struck ground, and he staggered and fell heavily
  into a sitting position on something soft and firm. For a moment the
  concussion stunned him. He became aware at once of a vivid scent of singed
  hair, and he seemed to hear the voice of Lidgett asking for him. You will
  understand that for a time his mind was greatly confused.</p>

  <p>At first he was distinctly under the impression that he was still in the
  classroom. He perceived quite distinctly the surprise of the boys and the
  entry of Mr. Lidgett. He is quite positive upon that score. He did not hear
  their remarks; but that he ascribed to the deafening effect of the
  experiment. Things about him seemed curiously dark and faint, but his mind
  explained that on the obvious but mistaken idea that the explosion had
  engendered a huge volume of dark smoke.</p>

  <p>Through the dimness the figures of Lidgett and the boys moved, as faint
  and silent as ghosts Plattner's face still tingled with the stinging heat of
  the flash. He was, he says, "all muddled." His first definite thoughts seem
  to have been of his personal safety. He thought he was perhaps blinded and
  deafened. He felt his limbs and face in a gingerly manner. Then his
  perceptions grew clearer, and he was astonished to miss the old familiar
  desks and other schoolroom furniture about him. Only dim, uncertain, grey
  shapes stood in the place of these. Then came a thing that made him shout
  aloud, and awoke his stunned faculties to instant activity. Two of the boys,
  gesticulating, walked one after the other clean through him! Neither
  manifested the slightest consciousness of his presence. It is difficult to
  imagine the sensation he felt. They came against him, he says, with no more
  force than a wisp of mist.</p>

  <p>Plattner's first thought after that was that he was dead. Having been
  brought up with thoroughly sound views in these matters, however he was a
  little surprised to find his body still about him. His second conclusion was
  that he was not dead, but that the others were: that the explosion had
  destroyed the Sussexville Proprietary School and every soul in it except
  himself. But that too, was scarcely satisfactory. He was thrown back upon
  astonished observation.</p>

  <p>Everything about him was extraordinarily dark: at first it seemed to have
  an altogether ebony blackness. Overhead was a black firmament. The only touch
  of light in the scene was a faint greenish glow at the edge of the sky in one
  direction, which threw into prominence a horizon of undulating black hills.
  This I say, was his impression at first. As his eye grew accustomed to the
  darkness, he began to distinguish a faint quality of differentiating greenish
  colour in the circumambient night. Against this background the furniture and
  occupants of the classroom, it seems, stood out like phosphorescent spectres,
  faint and impalpable. He extended his hand, and thrust it without an effort
  through the wall of the room by the fireplace.</p>

  <p>He describes himself as making a strenuous effort to attract attention. He
  shouted to Lidgett, and tried to seize the boys as they went to and fro. He
  only desisted from these attempts when Mrs. Lidgett, whom he (as an Assistant
  Master) naturally disliked, entered the room. He says the sensation of being
  in the world, and yet not a part of it, was an extraordinarily disagreeable
  one. He compared his feelings, not inaptly, to those of a cat watching a
  mouse through a window. Whenever he made a motion to communicate with the
  dim, familiar world about him, he found an invisible, incomprehensible
  barrier preventing intercourse. He then turned his attention to his solid
  environment. He found the medicine bottle still unbroken in his hand, with
  the remainder of the green powder therein. He put this in his pocket, and
  began to feel about him. Apparently, he was sitting on a boulder of rock
  covered with a velvety moss. The dark country about him, he was unable to
  see, the faint, misty picture of the schoolroom blotting it out, but he had a
  feeling (due perhaps to a cold wind) that he was near the crest of a hill,
  and that a steep valley fell away beneath his feet. The green glow along the
  edge of the sky seemed to be growing in extent and intensity. He stood up,
  rubbing his eyes.</p>

  <p>It would seem that he made a few steps, going steeply downhill, and then
  stumbled, nearly fell, and sat down again upon a jagged mass of rock to watch
  the dawn. He became aware that the world about him was absolutely silent. It
  was as still as it was dark, and though there was a cold wind blowing up the
  hill-face, the rustle of grass, the soughing of the boughs that should have
  accompanied it, were absent. He could hear, therefore, if he could not see,
  that the hillside upon which he stood was rocky and desolate. The green grew
  brighter every moment, and as it did so, a faint, transparent blood-red
  mingled with, but did not mitigate, the blackness of the sky overhead and the
  rocky desolations about him. Having regard to what follows, I am inclined to
  think that, that redness may have been an optical effect due to contrast.
  Something black fluttered momentarily against the livid yellow-green of the
  lower sky, and then the thin and penetrating voice of a bell rose out of the
  black gulf below him. An oppressive expectation grew with the growing
  light.</p>

  <p>It is probable that an hour or more elapsed while he sat there, the
  strange green light growing brighter every moment, and spreading slowly, in
  flamboyant fingers, upward towards the zenith. As it grew, the spectral
  vision of our world became relatively or absolutely fainter. Probably both,
  for the time must have been about that of our earthly sunset. So far as his
  vision of our world went, Plattner, by his few steps downhill, had passed
  through the floor of the classroom, and was now, it seemed, sitting in
  mid-air in the larger schoolroom downstairs. He saw the boarders distinctly,
  but much more faintly than he had seen Lidgett. They were preparing their
  evening tasks, and he noticed with interest that several were cheating with
  their Euclid riders by means of a crib, a compilation whose existence he had
  hitherto never suspected. As the time passed, they faded steadily, as
  steadily as the light of the green dawn increased.</p>

  <p>Looking down into the valley, he saw that the light had crept far down its
  rocky sides, and that the profound blackness of the abyss was now broken by a
  minute green glow, like the light of a glow-worm. And almost immediately the
  limb of a huge heavenly body of blazing green rose over the basaltic
  undulations of the distant hills, and the monstrous hill-masses about him
  came out gaunt and desolate, in green light and deep, ruddy black shadows. He
  became aware of a vast number of ball-shaped objects drifting as thistledown
  drifts over the high ground. There were none of these nearer to him than the
  opposite side of the gorge. The bell below twanged quicker and quicker, with
  something like impatient insistence, and several lights moved hither and
  thither. The boys at work at their desks were now almost imperceptibly
  faint.</p>

  <p>This extinction of our world, when the green sun of this other universe
  rose, is a curious point upon which Plattner insists. During the Other-World
  night, it is difficult to move about, on account of the vividness with which
  the things of this world are visible. It becomes a riddle to explain why, if
  this is the case, we in this world catch no glimpse of the Other-World. It is
  due, perhaps, to the comparatively vivid illumination of this world of ours.
  Plattner describes the midday of the Other-World, at its brightest as not
  being nearly so bright as this world at full moon, while its night is
  profoundly black. Consequently, the amount of light, even in an ordinary dark
  room, is sufficient to render the things of the Other-World invisible, on the
  same principle that faint phosphorescence is only visible in the profoundest
  darkness. I have tried, since he told me his story, to see something of the
  Other-World by sitting for a long space in a photographer's dark room at
  night. I have certainly seen indistinctly the form of greenish slopes and
  rocks, but only, I must admit, very indistinctly indeed. The reader may
  possibly be more successful. Plattner tells me that since his return he has
  dreamt and seen and recognised places in the Other-World, but this is
  probably due to his memory of these scenes. It seems quite possible that
  people with unusually keen eyesight may occasionally catch a glimpse of this
  strange Other-World about us.</p>

  <p>However, this is a digression. As the green sun rose, a long street of
  black buildings became perceptible, though only darkly and indistinctly, in
  the gorge, and after some hesitation, Plattner began to clamber down the
  precipitous descent towards them. The descent was long and exceedingly
  tedious, being so not only by the extraordinary steepness, but also by reason
  of the looseness of the boulders with which the whole face of the hill was
  strewn. The noise of his descent&mdash;now and then his heels struck fire
  from the rocks&mdash;seemed now the only sound in the universe, for the
  beating of the bell had ceased. As he drew nearer, he perceived that the
  various edifices had a singular resemblance to tombs and mausoleums and
  monuments, saving only that they were all uniformly black instead of being
  white, as most sepulchres are. And then he saw, crowding out of the largest
  building, very much as people disperse from church, a number of pallid,
  rounded, pale-green figures. These dispersed in several directions about the
  broad street of the place, some going through side alleys and reappearing
  upon the steepness of the hill, others entering some of the small black
  buildings which lined the way.</p>

  <p>At the sight of these things drifting up towards him, Plattner stopped
  staring. They were not walking, they were indeed limbless, and they had the
  appearance of human heads, beneath which a tadpole-like body swung. He was
  too astonished at their strangeness, too full, indeed of strangeness, to be
  seriously alarmed by them. They drove towards him, in front of the chill wind
  that was blowing uphill, much as soap-bubbles drive before a draught. And as
  he looked at the nearest of those approaching, he saw it was indeed a human
  head, albeit with singularly large eyes, and wearing such an expression of
  distress and anguish as he had never seen before upon mortal countenance. He
  was surprised to find that it did not turn to regard him, but seemed to be
  watching and following some unseen moving thing. For a moment he was puzzled,
  and then it occurred to him that this creature was watching with its enormous
  eyes something that was happening in the world he had just left. Nearer it
  came, and nearer, and he was too astonished to cry out. It made a very faint
  fretting sound as it came close to him. Then it struck his face with a gentle
  pat&mdash;, its touch was very cold&mdash;, and drove past him, and upward
  towards the crest of the hill.</p>

  <p>An extraordinary conviction flashed across Plattner's mind that this head
  had a strong likeness to Lidgett. Then he turned his attention to the other
  heads that were now swarming thickly up the hillside. None made the slightest
  sign of recognition. One or two, indeed, came close to his head and almost
  followed the example of the first, but he dodged convulsively out of the way.
  Upon most of them he saw the same expression of unavailing regret he had seen
  upon the first, and heard the same faint sounds of wretchedness from them.
  One or two wept, and one rolling swiftly uphill wore an expression of
  diabolical rage. But others were cold, and several had a look of gratified
  interest in their eyes. One at least, was almost in an ecstasy of happiness.
  Plattner does not remember that he recognised any more likenesses in those he
  saw at this time.</p>

  <p>For several hours, perhaps Plattner watched these strange things
  dispersing themselves over the hills, and not till long after they had ceased
  to issue from the clustering black buildings in the gorge, did he resume his
  downward climb. The darkness about him increased so much that he had a
  difficulty in stepping true. Overhead the sky was now a bright, pale green.
  He felt neither hunger nor thirst. Later, when he did, he found a chilly
  stream running down the centre of the gorge, and the rare moss upon the
  boulders, when he tried it at last in desperation, was good to eat.</p>

  <p>He groped about among the tombs that ran down the gorge, seeking vaguely
  for some clue to these inexplicable things. After a long time he came to the
  entrance of the big mausoleum-like building from which the heads had issued.
  In this he found a group of green lights burning upon a kind of basaltic
  altar, and a bell-rope from a belfry overhead hanging down into the centre of
  the place. Round the wall ran a lettering of fire in a character unknown to
  him. While he was still wondering at the purport of these things, he heard
  the receding tramp of heavy feet echoing far down the street. He ran out into
  the darkness again, but he could see nothing. He had a mind to pull the
  bell-rope, and finally decided to follow the footsteps. But, although he ran
  far, he never overtook them; and his shouting was of no avail. The gorge
  seemed to extend an interminable distance. It was as dark as earthly
  starlight throughout its length, while the ghastly green day lay along the
  upper edge of its precipices. There were none of the heads, now, below. They
  were all, it seemed, busily occupied along the upper slopes. Looking up, he
  saw them drifting hither and thither, some hovering stationary, some flying
  swiftly through the air. It reminded him, he said, of "big snowflakes;" only
  these were black and pale green.</p>

  <p>In pursuing the firm, undeviating footsteps that he never overtook, in
  groping into new regions of this endless devil's dyke, in clambering up and
  down the pitiless heights, in wandering about the summits, and in watching
  the drifting faces, Plattner states that he spent the better part of seven or
  eight days. He did not keep count, he says. Though once or twice he found
  eyes watching him, he had word with no living soul. He slept among the rocks
  on the hillside. In the gorge things earthly were invisible, because from the
  earthly standpoint, it was far underground. On the altitudes, so soon as the
  earthly day began, the world became visible to him. He found himself
  sometimes stumbling over the dark green rocks, or arresting himself on a
  precipitous brink, while all about him the green branches of the Sussexville
  lanes were swaying; or again, he seemed to be walking through the Sussexville
  streets, or watching unseen the private business of some household. And then
  it was he discovered, that to almost every human being in our world there
  pertained some of these drifting heads: that every one in the world is
  watched intermittently by these helpless disembodiments.</p>

  <p>What are they&mdash;these Watchers of the Living? Plattner never learned.
  But two, that presently found and followed him, were like his childhood's
  memory of his father and mother. Now and then other faces turned their eyes
  upon him: eyes like those of dead people who had swayed him, or injured him,
  or helped him in his youth and manhood. Whenever they looked at him, Plattner
  was overcome with a strange sense of responsibility. To his mother he
  ventured to speak; but she made no answer. She looked sadly, steadfastly, and
  tenderly&mdash;a little reproachfully too, it seemed&mdash;into his eyes.</p>

  <p>He simply tells this story: he does not endeavour to explain. We are left
  to surmise who these Watchers of the Living may be, or if they are indeed the
  Dead, why they should so closely and passionately watch a world they have
  left for ever. It may be&mdash;indeed to my mind it seems just&mdash;that,
  when our life has closed, when evil or good is no longer a choice for us, we
  may still have to witness the working out of the train of consequences we
  have laid. If human souls continue after death, then surely human interests
  continue after death. But that is merely my own guess at the meaning of the
  things seen. Plattner offers no interpretation, for none was given him. It is
  well the reader should understand this clearly. Day after day, with his head
  reeling, he wandered about this green-lit world outside the world, weary and,
  towards the end, weak and hungry. By day&mdash;by our earthly day, that
  is&mdash;the ghostly vision of the old familiar scenery of Sussexville, all
  about him, irked and worried him. He could not see where to put his feet, and
  ever and again with a chilly touch one of these Watching Souls would come
  against his face. And after dark the multitude of these Watchers about him,
  and their intent distress, confused his mind beyond describing. A great
  longing to return to the earthly life that was so near and yet so remote
  consume him. The unearthliness of things about him produced a positively
  painful mental distress. He was worried beyond describing by his own
  particular followers. He would shout at them to desist from staring at him,
  scold at them, hurry away from them. They were always mute and intent. Run as
  he might over the uneven ground, they followed his destinies.</p>

  <p>On the ninth day, towards evening, Plattner heard the invisible footsteps
  approaching, far away down the gorge. He was then wandering over the broad
  crest of the same hill upon which he had fallen in his entry into this
  strange Other-World of his. He turned to hurry down into the gorge, feeling
  his way hastily, and was arrested by the sight of the thing that was
  happening in a room in a back street near the school. Both of the people in
  the room he knew by sight. The windows were open, the blinds up, and the
  setting sun shone clearly into it, so that it came out quite brightly at
  first, a vivid oblong of room, lying like a magic-lantern picture upon the
  black landscape and the livid green dawn. In addition to the sunlight, a
  candle had just been lit in the room.</p>

  <p>On the bed lay a lank man, his ghastly white face terrible upon the
  tumbled pillow. His clenched hands were raised above his head. A little table
  beside the bed carried a few medicine bottles, some toast and water, and an
  empty glass. Every now and then the lank man's lips fell apart, to indicate a
  word he could not articulate. But the woman did not notice that he wanted
  anything, because she was busy turning out papers from an old-fashioned
  bureau in the opposite corner of the room. At first the picture was very
  vivid indeed, but as the green dawn behind it grew brighter and brighter, so
  it became fainter and more and more transparent.</p>

  <p>As the echoing footsteps paced nearer and nearer, those footsteps that
  sound so loud in that Other-World and come so silently in this, Plattner
  perceived about him a great multitude of dim faces gathering together out of
  the darkness and watching the two people in the room. Never before had he
  seen so many of the Watchers of the Living. A multitude had eyes only for the
  sufferer in the room, another multitude, in infinite anguish, watched the
  woman as she hunted with greedy eyes for something she could not find. They
  crowded about Plattner, they came across his sight and buffeted his face, the
  noise of their unavailing regrets was all about him. He saw clearly only now
  and then. At other times the picture quivered dimly, through the veil of
  green reflections upon their movements. In the room it must have been very
  still, and Plattner says the candle flame streamed up into a perfectly
  vertical line of smoke, but in his ears each footfall and its echoes beat
  like a clap of thunder. And the faces! Two, more particularly near the
  woman's: one a woman's also, white and clear-featured, a face which might
  have once been cold and hard, but which was now softened by the touch of a
  wisdom strange to earth. The other might have been the woman's father. Both
  were evidently absorbed in the contemplation of some act of hateful meanness,
  so it seemed, which they could no longer guard against and prevent. Behind
  were others, teachers, it may be, who had taught ill, friends whose influence
  had failed. And over the man, too&mdash;a multitude, but none that seemed to
  be parents or teachers! Faces that might once have been coarse, now purged to
  strength by sorrow! And in the forefront one face, a girlish one, neither
  angry nor remorseful, but merely patient and weary, and as it seemed to
  Plattner, waiting for relief. His powers of description fail him at the
  memory of this multitude of ghastly countenances. They gathered on the stroke
  of the bell He saw them all in the space of a second. It would seem that he
  was so worked on by his excitement that, quite involuntarily, his restless
  fingers took the bottle of green powder out of his pocket and held it before
  him. But he does not remember that.</p>

  <p>Abruptly the footsteps ceased. He waited for the next, and there was
  silence, and then suddenly cutting through the unexpected stillness like a
  keen, thin blade, came the first stroke of the bell. At that the
  multitudinous faces swayed to and fro and a louder crying began all about
  him. The woman did not hear; she was burning something now in the candle
  flame. At the second stroke everything grew dim, and a breath of wind, icy
  cold, blew through the host of watchers. They swirled about him like an eddy
  of dead leaves in the spring, and at the third stroke something was extended
  through them to the bed. You have heard of a beam of light. This was like a
  beam of darkness, and looking again at it, Plattner saw that it was a shadowy
  arm and hand.</p>

  <p>The green sun was now topping the black desolations of the horizon, and
  the vision of the room was very faint. Plattner could see that the white of
  the bed struggled, and was convulsed; and that the woman looked round over
  her shoulder at it, startled.</p>

  <p>The cloud of watchers lifted high like a puff of green dust before the
  wind, and swept swiftly downward towards the temple in the gorge. Then
  suddenly Plattner understood the meaning of the shadowy black arm that
  stretched across his shoulder and clutched its prey. He did not dare turn his
  head to see the Shadow behind the arm. With a violent effort, and covering
  his eyes, he set himself to run, made perhaps twenty strides, then slipped on
  a boulder, and fell. He fell forward on his hands; and the bottle smashed and
  exploded as he touched the ground.</p>

  <p>In another moment he found himself, stunned and bleeding, sitting face to
  face with Lidgett in the old walled garden behind the school.</p>

  <p>There the story of Plattner's experiences ends. I have resisted, I believe
  successfully, the natural disposition of a writer of fiction to dress up
  incidents of this sort. I have told the thing as far as possible in the order
  in which Plattner told it to me. I have carefully avoided any attempt at
  style, effect, or construction. It would have been easy, for instance, to
  have worked the scene of the death-bed into a kind of plot in which Plattner
  might have been involved. But, quite apart from the objectionableness of
  falsifying a most extraordinary true story, any such trite devices would
  spoil to my mind, the peculiar effect of this dark world, with its livid
  green illumination and its drifting Watchers of the Living, which, unseen and
  unapproachable to us, is yet lying all about us.</p>

  <p>It remains to add, that a death did actually occur in Vincent Terrace,
  just beyond the school garden, and so far as can be proved, at the moment of
  Plattner's return. Deceased was a rate-collector and insurance agent. His
  widow, who was much younger than himself, married last month a Mr. Whymper, a
  veterinary surgeon of Allbeeding. As the portion of this story given here has
  in various forms circulated orally in Sussexville, she has consented to my
  use of her name, on condition that I make it distinctly known that she
  emphatically contradicts every detail of Plattner's account of her husband's
  last moments. She burnt no will, she says, although Plattner never accused
  her of doing so; her husband made but one will, and that just after their
  marriage. Certainly, from a man who had never seen it, Plattner's account of
  the furniture of the room was curiously accurate.</p>

  <p>One other thing, even at the risk of an irksome repetition, I must insist
  upon, lest I seem to favour the credulous, superstitious view. Plattner's
  absence from the world for nine days is, I think, proved. But that does not
  prove his story. It is quite conceivable that even outside space
  hallucinations may be possible. That at least, the reader must bear
  distinctly in mind.</p>

     name="story30">THE STORY OF THE LATE MR. ELVESHAM</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Idler</i>, May 1896</h3>

  <p>I set this story down, not expecting it will be believed, but if possible,
  to prepare a way of escape for the next victim. He perhaps, may profit by my
  misfortune. My own case, I know is hopeless, and I am now in some measure
  prepared to meet my fate.</p>

  <p>My name is Edward George Eden. I was born at Trentham, in Staffordshire,
  my father being employed in the gardens there. I lost my mother when I was
  three years old, and my father when I was five, my uncle, George Eden, then
  adopting me as his own son. He was a single man, self-educated, and
  well-known in Birmingham as an enterprising journalist; he educated me
  generously, fired my ambition to succeed in the world, and at his death,
  which happened four years ago, left me his entire fortune, a matter of about
  five hundred pounds after all outgoing charges were paid. I was then
  eighteen. He advised me in his will to expend the money in completing my
  education. I had already chosen the profession of medicine, and through his
  posthumous generosity and my good fortune in a scholarship competition, I
  became a medical student at University College, London. At the time of the
  beginning of my story I lodged at 11A University Street in a little upper
  room, very shabbily furnished and draughty, overlooking the back of
  Shoolbred's premises. I used this little room both to live in and sleep in,
  because I was anxious to eke out my means to the very last
  shillingsworth.</p>

  <p>I was taking a pair of shoes to be mended at a shop in the Tottenham Court
  Road when I first encountered the little old man with the yellow face, with
  whom my life has now become so inextricably entangled. He was standing on the
  kerb, and staring at the number on the door in a doubtful way, as I opened
  it. His eyes&mdash;they were dull grey eyes, and reddish under the rims
  &mdash;fell to my face, and his countenance immediately assumed an expression
  of corrugated amiability.</p>

  <p>"You come," he said, "apt to the moment. I had forgotten the number of
  your house. How do you do, Mr. Eden?"</p>

  <p>I was a little astonished at his familiar address, for I had never set
  eyes on the man before. I was a little annoyed too, at his catching me with
  my boots under my arm. He noticed my lack of cordiality.</p>

  <p>"Wonder who the deuce I am, eh? A friend, let me assure you. I have seen
  you before, though you haven't seen me. Is there anywhere where I can talk to
  you?"</p>

  <p>I hesitated. The shabbiness of my room upstairs was not a matter for every
  stranger. "Perhaps," said I, "we might walk down the street. I'm
  unfortunately prevented&mdash;" My gesture explained the sentence before I
  had spoken it.</p>

  <p>"The very thing," he said, and faced this way, and then that. "The street?
  Which way shall we go?" I slipped my boots down in the passage. "Look here!"
  he said abruptly; "this business of mine is a rigmarole. Come and lunch with
  me, Mr. Eden. I'm an old man, a very old man, and not good at explanations,
  and what with my piping voice and the clatter of the traffic&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He laid a persuasive skinny hand that trembled a little upon my arm.</p>

  <p>I was not so old that an old man might not treat me to a lunch. Yet at the
  same time I was not altogether pleased by this abrupt invitation. "I had
  rather&mdash;" I began. "But I had rather," he said, catching me up, "and a
  certain civility is surely due to my grey hairs."</p>

  <p>And so I consented, and went with him.</p>

  <p>He took me to Blavitiski's; I had to walk slowly to accommodate myself to
  his paces; and over such a lunch as I had never tasted before, he fended off
  my leading question, and I took a better note of his appearance. His
  clean-shaven face was lean and wrinkled, his shrivelled, lips fell over a set
  of false teeth, and his white hair was thin and rather long; he seemed small
  to me&mdash;though, indeed, most people seemed small to me&mdash;and his
  shoulders were rounded and bent. And watching him, I could not help but
  observe that he too was taking note of me, running his eyes, with a curious
  touch of greed in them, over me, from my broad shoulders to my sun-tanned
  hands, and up to my freckled face again. "And now," said he, as we lit our
  cigarettes, "I must tell you of the business in hand.</p>

  <p>"I must tell you then, that I am an old man, a very old man." He paused
  momentarily. "And it happens that I have money that I must presently be
  leaving, and never a child have I to leave it to." I thought of the
  confidence trick, and resolved I would be on the alert for the vestiges of my
  five hundred pounds. He proceeded to enlarge on his loneliness, and the
  trouble he had to find a proper disposition of his money. "I have weighed
  this plan and that plan, charities, institutions, and scholarships, and
  libraries, and I have come to this conclusion at last&mdash;," he fixed his
  eyes on my face&mdash;, "that I will find some young fellow, ambitious,
  pure-minded, and poor, healthy in body and healthy in mind, and in short,
  make him my heir, give him all that I have." He repeated, "Give him all that
  I have. So that he will suddenly be lifted out of all the trouble and
  struggle in which his sympathies have been educated, to freedom and
  influence."</p>

  <p>I tried to seem disinterested. With a transparent hypocrisy I said, "And
  you want my help, my professional services maybe, to find that person."</p>

  <p>He smiled, and looked at me over his cigarette, and I laughed at his quiet
  exposure of my modest pretence.</p>

  <p>"What a career such a man might have!" he said. "It fills me with envy to
  think how I have accumulated that another man may spend&mdash;</p>

  <p>"But there are conditions, of course, burdens to be imposed. He must, for
  instance, take my name. You cannot expect everything without some return. And
  I must go into all the circumstances of his life before I can accept him. He
  must be sound. I must know his heredity, how his parents and grandparents
  died, have the strictest inquiries made into his private morals&mdash;"</p>

  <p>This modified my secret congratulations a little.</p>

  <p>"And do I understand," said I, "that I&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, almost fiercely. "You. You."</p>

  <p>I answered never a word. My imagination was dancing wildly, my innate
  scepticism was useless to modify its transports. There was not a particle of
  gratitude in my mind&mdash;I did not know what to say nor how to say it. "But
  why me in particular?" I said at last.</p>

  <p>He had chanced to hear of me from Professor Haslar, he said, as a
  typically sound and sane young man, and he wished, as far as possible, to
  leave his money where health and integrity were assured.</p>

  <p>That was my first meeting with the little old man. He was mysterious about
  himself; he would not give his name yet, he said, and after I had answered
  some questions of his, he left me at the Blavitski portal. I noticed that he
  drew a handful of gold coins from his pocket when it came to paying for the
  lunch. His insistence upon bodily health was curious. In accordance with an
  arrangement we had made I applied that day for a life policy in the Loyal
  Insurance Company for a large sum, and I was exhaustively overhauled by the
  medical advisers of that company in the subsequent week. Even that did not
  satisfy him, and he insisted I must be re-examined by the great Doctor
  Henderson. It was Friday in Whitsun week before he came to a decision. He
  called me down, quite late in the evening&mdash;, nearly nine it was &mdash;,
  from cramming chemical equations for my Preliminary Scientific examination.
  He was standing in the passage under the feeble gas-lamp, and his face was a
  grotesque interplay of shadows. He seemed more bowed than when I had first
  seen him, and his cheeks had sunk in a little.</p>

  <p>His voice shook with emotion. "Everything is satisfactory, Mr. Eden," he
  said. "Everything is quite, quite satisfactory. And this night of all nights,
  you must dine with me and celebrate your&mdash;accession." He was interrupted
  by a cough. "You won't have long to wait, either," he said, wiping his
  handkerchief across his lips, and gripping my hand with his long bony claw
  that was disengaged. "Certainly not very long to wait."</p>

  <p>We went into the street and called a cab. I remember every incident of
  that drive vividly, the swift, easy motion, the vivid contrast of gas and oil
  and electric light, the crowds of people in the streets, the place in Regent
  Street to which we went, and the sumptuous dinner we were served with there.
  I was disconcerted at first by the well-dressed waiter's glances at my rough
  clothes, bothered by the stones of the olives, but as the champagne warmed my
  blood, my confidence revived. At first the old man talked of himself. He had
  already told me his name in the cab; he was Egbert Elvesham, the great
  philosopher, whose name I had known since I was a lad at school. It seemed
  incredible to me that this man, whose intelligence had so early dominated
  mine, this great abstraction, should suddenly realise itself as this
  decrepit, familiar figure. I dare say every young fellow who has suddenly
  fallen among celebrities has felt something of my disappointment. He told me
  now of the future that the feeble streams of his life would presently leave
  dry for me, houses, copyrights, investments; I had never suspected that
  philosophers were so rich. He watched me drink and eat with a touch of envy.
  "What a capacity for living you have!" he said; and then with a sigh, a sigh
  of relief I could have thought it, "It will not be long."</p>

  <p>"Ay," said I, my head swimming now with champagne; "I have a future
  perhaps&mdash;of a fairly agreeable sort, thanks to you. I shall now have the
  honour of your name. But you have a past. Such a past as is worth all my
  future."</p>

  <p>He shook his head and smiled, as I thought, with half-sad appreciation of
  my flattering admiration. "That future," he said, "would you in truth change
  it?" The waiter came with liqueurs. "You will not perhaps mind taking my
  name, taking my position, but would you indeed&mdash;willingly&mdash;take my
  years?"</p>

  <p>"With your achievements," said I gallantly.</p>

  <p>He smiled again. "Kummel&mdash;both," he said to the waiter, and turned
  his attention to a little paper packet he had taken from his pocket. "This
  hour," said he, "this after-dinner hour is the hour of small things. Here is
  a scrap of my unpublished wisdom." He opened the packet with his shaking
  yellow fingers, and showed a little pinkish powder on the paper. "This," said
  he&mdash;"well, you must guess what it is. But Kummel&mdash;put but a dash of
  this powder in it&mdash;is Himmel." His large greyish eyes watched mine with
  an inscrutable expression.</p>

  <p>It was a bit of a shock to me to find this great teacher gave his mind to
  the flavour of liqueurs. However, I feigned an interest in his weakness, for
  I was drunk enough for such small sycophancy.</p>

  <p>He parted the powder between the little glasses, and rising suddenly, with
  a strange unexpected dignity, held out his hand towards me. I imitated his
  action, and the glasses rang. "To a quick succession," said he, and raised
  his glass towards his lips.</p>

  <p>"Not that," I said hastily. "Not that."</p>

  <p>He paused with the liqueur at the level of his chin, and his eyes blazing
  into mine.</p>

  <p>"To a long life," said I.</p>

  <p>He hesitated. "To a long life," said he, with a sudden bark of laughter,
  and with eyes fixed on one another we tilted the little glasses. His eyes
  looked straight into mine, and as I drained the stuff off, I felt a curiously
  intense sensation. The first touch of it set my brain in a furious tumult; I
  seemed to feel an actual physical stirring in my skull, and a seething
  humming filled my ears. I did not notice the flavour in my mouth, the aroma
  that filled my throat; I saw only the grey intensity of his gaze that burnt
  into mine. The draught, the mental confusion, the noise and stirring in my
  head, seemed to last an interminable time. Curious vague impressions of
  half-forgotten things danced and vanished on the edge of my consciousness. At
  last he broke the spell. With a sudden explosive sigh he put down his
  glass.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said.</p>

  <p>"It's glorious," said I, though I had not tasted the stuff.</p>

  <p>My head was spinning. I sat down. My brain was chaos. Then my perception
  grew clear and minute as though I saw things in a concave mirror. His manner
  seemed to have changed into something nervous and hasty. He pulled out his
  watch and grimaced at it. "Eleven-seven! And to-night I must&mdash;Seven-
  twenty-five. Waterloo! I must go at once." He called for the bill, and
  struggled with his coat. Officious waiters came to our assistance. In another
  moment I was wishing him good-bye, over the apron of a cab, and still with an
  absurd feeling of minute distinctness, as though&mdash;how can I express
  it&mdash;? I not only saw but felt through an inverted opera-glass.</p>

  <p>"That stuff," he said. He put his hand to his forehead. "I ought not to
  have given it to you. It will make your head split to-morrow. Wait a minute.
  Here." He handed me out a little flat thing like a seidlitz-powder. "Take
  that in water as you are going to bed. The other thing was a drug. Not till
  you're ready to go to bed, mind. It will clear your head. That's all. One
  more shake&mdash;Futurus!"</p>

  <p>I gripped his shrivelled claw. "Good-bye," he said, and by the droop of
  his eyelids I judged he too was a little under the influence of that brain-
  twisting cordial.</p>

  <p>He recollected something else with a start, felt in his breast-pocket, and
  produced another packet, this time a cylinder the size and shape of a
  shaving-stick. "Here," said he. "I'd almost forgotten. Don't open this until
  I come to-morrow&mdash;but take it now."</p>

  <p>It was so heavy that I well-nigh dropped it. "All ri'!" said I, and he
  grinned at me through the cab window as the cabman flicked his horse into
  wakefulness. It was a white packet he had given me, with red seals at either
  end and along its edge. "If this isn't money," said I, "it's platinum or
  lead."</p>

  <p>I stuck it with elaborate care into my pocket, and with a whirling brain
  walked home through the Regent Street loiterers and the dark back streets
  beyond Portland Road. I remember the sensations of that walk very vividly,
  strange as they were. I was still so far myself that I could notice my
  strange mental state, and wonder whether this stuff I had, had was opium
  &mdash;a drug beyond my experience. It is hard now to describe the
  peculiarity of my mental strangeness&mdash;mental doubling vaguely expresses
  it. As I was walking up Regent Street I found in my mind a queer persuasion
  that it was Waterloo Station, and had an odd impulse to get into the
  Polytechnic as a man might get into a train. I put a knuckle in my eye, and
  it was Regent Street. How can I express it? You see a skilful actor looking
  quietly at you, he pulls a grimace, and lo&mdash;! Another person. Is it too
  extravagant if I tell you that it seemed to me as if Regent Street had, for
  the moment, done that? Then, being persuaded it was Regent Street again, I
  was oddly muddled about some fantastic reminiscences that cropped up. "Thirty
  years ago," thought I, "it was here that I quarrelled with my brother." Then
  I burst out laughing, to the astonishment and encouragement of a group of
  night prowlers. Thirty years ago I did not exist, and never in my life had I
  boasted a brother. The stuff was surely liquid folly, for the poignant regret
  for that lost brother still clung to me. Along Portland Road the madness took
  another turn. I began to recall vanished shops, and to compare the street
  with what it used to be. Confused, troubled thinking is comprehensible enough
  after the drink I had taken, but what puzzled me were these curiously vivid
  phantasm memories that had crept into my mind, and not only the memories that
  had crept in, but also the memories that had slipped out. I stopped opposite
  Stevens', the natural history dealer's, and cudgelled my brains to think what
  he had to do with me. A 'bus went by, and sounded exactly like the rumbling
  of a train. I seemed to be dipping into some dark, remote pit for the
  recollection. "Of course," said I, at last, "he has promised me three frogs
  to-morrow. Odd I should have forgotten."</p>

  <p>Do they still show children dissolving views? In those I remember one view
  would begin like a faint ghost, and grow and oust another. In just that way
  it seemed to me that a ghostly set of new sensations was struggling with
  those of my ordinary self.</p>

  <p>I went on through Euston Road to Tottenham Court Road, puzzled, and a
  little frightened, and scarcely noticed the unusual way I was taking, for
  commonly I used to cut through the intervening network of back streets. I
  turned into University Street, to discover that I had forgotten my number.
  Only by a strong effort did I recall 11A, and even then it seemed to me that
  it was a thing some forgotten person had told me. I tried to steady my mind
  by recalling the incidents of the dinner, and for the life of me I could
  conjure up no picture of my host's face; I saw him only as a shadowy outline,
  as one might see oneself reflected in a window through which one was looking.
  In his place however, I had a curious exterior vision of myself, sitting at a
  table, flushed, bright-eyed, and talkative.</p>

  <p>"I must take this other powder," said I. "This is getting impossible."</p>

  <p>I tried the wrong side of the hall for my candle and the matches, and had
  a doubt of which landing my room might be on. "I'm drunk," I said, "that's
  certain," and blundered needlessly on the staircase to sustain the
  proposition.</p>

  <p>At the first glance my room seemed unfamiliar. "What rot!" I said, and
  stared about me. I seemed to bring myself back by the effort, and the odd
  phantasmal quality passed into the concrete familiar. There was the old
  looking-glass, with my notes on the albumens stuck in the corner of the
  frame, my old everyday suit of clothes pitched about the floor. And yet it
  was not so real after all. I felt an idiotic persuasion trying to creep into
  my mind, as it were, that I was in a railway carriage in a train just
  stopping, that I was peering out of the window at some unknown station. I
  gripped the bed-rail firmly to reassure myself. "It's clairvoyance, perhaps,"
  I said. "I must write to the Psychical Research Society."</p>

  <p>I put the rouleau on my dressing-table, sat on my bed, and began to take
  off my boots. It was as if the picture of my present sensations was painted
  over some other picture that was trying to show through. "Curse it!" Said I;
  "My wits are going, or am I in two places at once?" Half-undressed, I tossed
  the powder into a glass and drank it off. It effervesced, and became a
  fluorescent amber colour. Before I was in bed my mind was already
  tranquillised. I felt the pillow at my cheek, and thereupon I must have
  fallen asleep.</p>

  <p>I awoke abruptly out of a dream of strange beasts, and found myself lying
  on my back. Probably every one knows that dismal, emotional dream from which
  one escapes, awake indeed, but strangely cowed. There was a curious taste in
  my mouth, a tired feeling in my limbs, a sense of cutaneous discomfort. I lay
  with my head motionless on my pillow, expecting that my feeling of
  strangeness and terror would pass away, and that I should then doze off again
  to sleep. But instead of that, my uncanny sensations increased. At first I
  could perceive nothing wrong about me. There was a faint light in the room,
  so faint that it was the very next thing to darkness, and the furniture stood
  out in it as vague blots of absolute darkness. I stared with my eyes just
  over the bedclothes.</p>

  <p>It came into my mind that some one had entered the room to rob me of my
  rouleau of money, but after lying for some moments, breathing regularly to
  simulate sleep, I realised this was mere fancy. Nevertheless, the uneasy
  assurance of something wrong kept fast hold of me. With an effort I raised my
  head from the pillow, and peered about me at the dark. What it was I could
  not conceive. I looked at the dim shapes around me, the greater and lesser
  darknesses that indicated curtains, table, fireplace, bookshelves, and so
  forth. Then I began to perceive something unfamiliar in the forms of the
  darkness. Had the bed turned round? Yonder should be the bookshelves, and
  something shrouded and pallid rose there, something that would not answer to
  the bookshelves, however I looked at it. It was far too big to be my shirt
  thrown on a chair.</p>

  <p>Overcoming a childish terror, I threw back the bedclothes and thrust my
  leg out of bed. Instead of coming out of my truckle-bed upon the floor, I
  found my foot scarcely reached the edge of the mattress. I made another step,
  as it were, and sat up on the edge of the bed. By the side of my bed should
  be the candle, and the matches upon the broken chair. I put out my hand and
  touched&mdash;nothing. I waved my hand in the darkness, and it came against
  some heavy hanging, soft and thick in texture, which gave a rustling noise at
  my touch. I grasped this and pulled it; it appeared to be a curtain suspended
  over the head of my bed.</p>

  <p>I was now thoroughly awake, and beginning to realise that I was in a
  strange room. I was puzzled. I tried to recall the overnight circumstances,
  and I found them now, curiously enough, vivid in my memory: the supper, my
  reception of the little packages, my wonder whether I was intoxicated, my
  slow undressing, the coolness to my flushed face of my pillow. I felt a
  sudden distrust. Was that last night, or the night before? At any rate, this
  room was strange to me, and I could not imagine how I had got into it. The
  dim, pallid outline was growing paler, and I perceived it was a window, with
  the dark shape of an oval toilet-glass against the weak intimation of the
  dawn that filtered through the blind. I stood up, and was surprised by a
  curious feeling of weakness and unsteadiness. With trembling hands
  outstretched, I walked slowly towards the window, getting, nevertheless, a
  bruise on the knee from a chair by the way. I fumbled round the glass, which
  was large, with handsome brass sconces, to find the blind-cord. I could not
  find any. By chance I took hold of the tassel, and with the click of a spring
  the blind ran up.</p>

  <p>I found myself looking out upon a scene that was altogether strange to me.
  The night was overcast, and through the flocculent grey of the heaped clouds
  there filtered a faint half-light of dawn. Just at the edge of the sky the
  cloud-canopy had a blood-red rim. Below everything was dark and indistinct,
  dim hills in the distance, a vague mass of buildings running up into
  pinnacles, trees like spilt ink, and below the window a tracery of black
  bushes and pale grey paths. It was so unfamiliar that for the moment I
  thought myself still dreaming. I felt the toilet-table; it appeared to be
  made of some polished wood, and was rather elaborately furnished&mdash; there
  were little cut-glass bottles and a brush upon it. There was also a queer
  little object, horse-shoe-shaped it felt, with smooth, hard projections,
  lying in a saucer. I could find no matches nor candlestick.</p>

  <p>I turned my eyes to the room again. Now the blind was up, faint spectres
  of its furnishing came out of the darkness. There was a huge curtained bed,
  and the fireplace at its foot had a large white mantel with something of the
  shimmer of marble.</p>

  <p>I leant against the toilet-table, shut my eyes and opened them again, and
  tried to think. The whole thing was far too real for dreaming. I was inclined
  to imagine there was still some hiatus in my memory, as a consequence of my
  draught of that strange liqueur; that I had come into my inheritance perhaps,
  and suddenly lost my recollection of everything since my good fortune had
  been announced. Perhaps if I waited a little, things would be clearer to me
  again. Yet my dinner with old Elvesham was now singularly vivid and recent.
  The champagne, the observant waiters, the powder, and the liqueurs&mdash;I
  could have staked my soul it all happened a few hours ago.</p>

  <p>And then occurred a thing so trivial and yet so terrible to me that I
  shiver now to think of that moment. I spoke aloud. I said, "How the devil did
  I get here...?" And the voice was not my own.</p>

  <p>It was not my own, it was thin, the articulation was slurred, the
  resonance of my facial bones was different. Then to reassure myself, I ran
  one hand over the other, and felt loose folds of skin, the bony laxity of
  age. "Surely," I said, in that horrible voice that had somehow established
  itself in my throat, "surely this thing is a dream!" Almost as quickly as if
  I did it involuntarily, I thrust my fingers into my mouth. My teeth had gone.
  My finger-tips ran on the flaccid surface of an even row of shrivelled gums.
  I was sick with dismay and disgust.</p>

  <p>I felt then a passionate desire to see myself, to realise at once in its
  full horror the ghastly change that had come upon me. I tottered to the
  mantel, and felt along it for matches. As I did so, a barking cough sprang up
  in my throat, and I clutched the thick flannel nightdress I found about me.
  There were no matches there, and I suddenly realised that my extremities were
  cold. Sniffing and coughing, whimpering a little, perhaps, I fumbled back to
  bed. "It is surely a dream," I whispered to myself as I clambered back,
  "surely a dream." It was a senile repetition. I pulled the bedclothes over my
  shoulders, over my ears, I thrust my withered hand under the pillow, and
  determined to compose myself to sleep. Of course it was a dream. In the
  morning the dream would be over, and I should wake up strong and vigorous
  again to my youth and studies. I shut my eyes, breathed regularly, and
  finding myself wakeful, began to count slowly through the powers of
  three.</p>

  <p>But the thing I desired would not come. I could not get to sleep. And the
  persuasion of the inexorable reality of the change that had happened to me
  grew steadily. Presently I found myself with my eyes wide open, the powers of
  three forgotten, and my skinny fingers upon my shrivelled gums, I was indeed,
  suddenly and abruptly, an old man. I had in some unaccountable manner fallen
  through my life and come to old age, in some way I had been cheated of all
  the best of my life, of love, of struggle, of strength, and hope. I grovelled
  into the pillow and tried to persuade myself that such hallucination was
  possible. Imperceptibly, steadily, the dawn grew clearer.</p>

  <p>At last, despairing of further sleep, I sat up in bed and looked about me.
  A chill twilight rendered the whole chamber visible. It was spacious and
  well-furnished, better furnished than any room I had ever slept in before. A
  candle and matches became dimly visible upon a little pedestal in a recess. I
  threw back the bedclothes, and shivering with the rawness of the early
  morning, albeit it was summer-time, I got out and lit the candle. Then
  trembling horribly, so that the extinguisher rattled on its spike, I tottered
  to the glass and saw&mdash;Elvesham's face! It was none the less horrible
  because I had already dimly feared as much. He had already seemed physically
  weak and pitiful to me, but seen now, dressed only in a coarse flannel
  nightdress, that fell apart and showed the stringy neck, seen now as my own
  body, I cannot describe its desolate decrepitude. The hollow cheeks, the
  straggling tail of dirty grey hair, the rheumy bleared eyes, the quivering,
  shrivelled lips, the lower displaying a gleam of the pink interior lining,
  and those horrible dark gums showing. You who are mind and body together, at
  your natural years, cannot imagine what this fiendish imprisonment meant to
  me. To be young and full of the desire and energy of youth, and to be caught,
  and presently to be crushed in this tottering ruin of a body...</p>

  <p>But I wander from the course of my story. For some time I must have been
  stunned at this change that had come upon me. It was daylight when I did so
  far gather myself together as to think. In some inexplicable way I had been
  changed, though how short of magic, the thing had been done, I could not say.
  And as I thought, the diabolical ingenuity of Elvesham came home to me. It
  seemed plain to me that as I found myself in his, so he must be in possession
  of my body, of my strength, that is, and my future. But how to prove it?
  Then, as I thought, the thing became so incredible, even to me, that my mind
  reeled, and I had to pinch myself, to feel my toothless gums, to see myself
  in the glass, and touch the things about me, before I could steady myself to
  face the facts again. Was all life hallucination? Was I indeed Elvesham, and
  he me? Had I been dreaming of Eden overnight? Was there any Eden? But if I
  was Elvesham, I should remember where I was on the previous morning, the name
  of the town in which I lived, what happened before the dream began. I
  struggled with my thoughts. I recalled the queer doubleness of my memories
  overnight. But now my mind was clear. Not the ghost of any memories but those
  proper to Eden could I raise.</p>

  <p>"This way lies insanity!" I cried in my piping voice. I staggered to my
  feet, dragged my feeble, heavy limbs to the washhand-stand, and plunged my
  grey head into a basin of cold water. Then, towelling myself, I tried again.
  It was no good. I felt beyond all question that I was indeed Eden, not
  Elvesham. But Eden in Elvesham's body!</p>

  <p>Had I been a man of any other age, I might have given myself up to my fate
  as one enchanted. But in these sceptical days miracles do not pass current.
  Here was some trick of psychology. What a drug and a steady stare could do, a
  drug and a steady stare, or some similar treatment, could surely undo. Men
  have lost their memories before. But to exchange memories as one does
  umbrellas! I laughed. Alas! Not a healthy laugh, but a wheezing, senile
  titter. I could have fancied old Elvesham laughing at my plight, and a gust
  of petulant anger, unusual to me, swept across my feelings. I began dressing
  eagerly in the clothes I found lying about on the floor, and only realised
  when I was dressed that it was an evening suit I had assumed. I opened the
  wardrobe and found some more ordinary clothes, a pair of plaid trousers, and
  an old-fashioned dressing-gown. I put a venerable smoking-cap on my venerable
  head, and coughing a little from my exertions, tottered out upon the
  landing.</p>

  <p>It was then, perhaps a quarter to six, and the blinds were closely drawn
  and the house quite silent. The landing was a spacious one, a broad, richly-
  carpeted staircase went down into the darkness of the hall below, and before
  me a door ajar showed me a writing-desk, a revolving bookcase, the back of a
  study chair, and a fine array of bound books, shelf upon shelf.</p>

  <p>"My study," I mumbled, and walked across the landing. Then at the sound of
  my voice a thought struck me, and I went back to the bedroom and put in the
  set of false teeth. They slipped in with the ease of old, habit. "That's
  better," said I, gnashing them, and so returned to the study.</p>

  <p>The drawers of the writing-desk were locked. Its revolving top was also
  locked. I could see no indications of the keys, and there were none in the
  pockets of my trousers. I shuffled back at once to the bedroom, and went
  through the dress suit, and afterwards the pockets of all the garments I
  could find. I was very eager, and one might have imagined that burglars had
  been at work, to see my room when I had done. Not only were there no keys to
  be found, but not a coin, nor a scrap of paper&mdash;save only the receipted
  bill of the overnight dinner.</p>

  <p>A curious weariness asserted itself. I sat down and stared at the garments
  flung here and there, their pockets turned inside out. My first frenzy had
  already flickered out. Every moment I was beginning to realise the immense
  intelligence of the plans of my enemy, to see more and more clearly the
  hopelessness of my position. With an effort I rose and hurried hobbling into
  the study again. On the staircase was a housemaid pulling up the blinds. She
  stared, I think, at the expression of my face. I shut the door of the study
  behind me, and seizing a poker, began an attack upon the desk. That is how
  they found me. The cover of the desk was split, the lock smashed, the letters
  torn out of the pigeon-holes, and tossed about the room. In my senile rage I
  had flung about the pens and other such light stationery, and overturned the
  ink. Moreover, a large vase upon the mantel had got broken&mdash;I do not
  know how. I could find no cheque-book, no money, no indications of the
  slightest use for the recovery of my body. I was battering madly at the
  drawers, when the butler, backed by two women-servants, intruded upon me.</p>

  <p>That simply is the story of my change. No one will believe my frantic
  assertions. I am treated as one demented, and even at this moment I am under
  restraint. But I am sane, absolutely sane, and to prove it I have sat down to
  write this story minutely as the things happened to me. I appeal to the
  reader, whether there is any trace of insanity in the style or method, of the
  story he has been reading. I am a young man locked away in an old man's body.
  But the clear fact is incredible to everyone. Naturally I appear demented to
  those who will not believe this, naturally I do not know the names of my
  secretaries, of the doctors who come to see me, of my servants and
  neighbours, of this town (wherever it is) where I find myself. Naturally I
  lose myself in my own house, and suffer inconveniences of every sort.
  Naturally I ask the oddest questions. Naturally I weep and cry out, and have
  paroxysms of despair. I have no money and no cheque-book. The bank will not
  recognise my signature, for I suppose that, allowing for the feeble muscles I
  now have, my handwriting is still Eden's. These people about me will not let
  me go to the bank personally. It seems, indeed, that there is no bank in this
  town, and that I have an account in some part of London. It seems that
  Elvesham kept the name of his solicitor secret from all his household&mdash;
  I can ascertain nothing. Elvesham was, of course, a profound student of
  mental science, and all my declarations of the facts of the case merely
  confirm the theory that my insanity is the outcome of overmuch brooding upon
  psychology. Dreams of the personal identity indeed! Two days ago I was a
  healthy youngster, with all life before me; now I am a furious old man,
  unkempt, and desperate, and miserable, prowling about a great, luxurious,
  strange house, watched, feared, and avoided as a lunatic by everyone about
  me. And in London, there is Elvesham beginning life again in a vigorous body,
  and with all the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of threescore and ten. He
  has stolen my life.</p>

  <p>What has happened I do not clearly know. In the study are volumes of
  manuscript notes referring chiefly to the psychology of memory, and parts of
  what may be either calculations or ciphers in symbols absolutely strange to
  me. In some passages there are indications that he was also occupied with the
  philosophy of mathematics. I take it he has transferred the whole of his
  memories, the accumulation that makes up his personality, from this old
  withered brain of his to mine, and similarly, that he has transferred mine to
  his discarded tenement. Practically, that is, he has changed bodies. But how
  such a change may be possible is without the range of my philosophy. I have
  been a materialist for all my thinking life, but here suddenly, is a clear
  case of man's detachability from matter.</p>

  <p>One desperate experiment I am about to try. I sit writing here before
  putting the matter to issue. This morning, with the help of a table-knife
  that I had secreted at breakfast, I succeeded in breaking open a fairly
  obvious secret drawer in this wrecked writing-desk. I discovered nothing save
  a little green glass phial containing a white powder. Round the neck of the
  phial was a label, and thereon was written this one word, "Release." This may
  be&mdash;is most probably, poison. I can understand Elvesham placing poison
  in my way, and I should be sure that it was his intention so to get rid of
  the only living witness against him, were it not for this careful
  concealment. The man has practically solved the problem of immortality. Save
  for the spite of chance, he will live in my body until it has aged, and then,
  again throwing that aside, he will assume some other victim's youth and
  strength. When one remembers his heartlessness, it is terrible to think of
  the ever-growing experience that... How long has he been leaping from body to
  body...? But I tire of writing. The powder appears to be soluble in water.
  The taste is not unpleasant.</p>

  <p>There the narrative found upon Mr. Elvesham's desk ends. His dead body lay
  between the desk and the chair. The latter had been pushed back, probably by
  his last convulsions. The story was written in pencil and in a crazy hand,
  quite unlike his usual minute characters. There remain only two curious facts
  to record. Indisputably there was some connection between Eden and Elvesham,
  since the whole of Elvesham's property was bequeathed to the young man. But
  he never inherited. When Elvesham ommitted suicide, Eden was, strangely
  enough, already dead. Twenty-four hours before, he had been knocked down by a
  cab and killed instantly, at the crowded crossing at the intersection of
  Gower Street and Euston Road. So that the only human being who could have
  thrown light upon this fantastic narrative is beyond the reach of
  questions.</p>

     name="story31">THE RAJAH'S TREASURE</a></h2>

  <h3>First published <i>Pearson's Magazine</i>, July 1896</h3>

  <p>Between Jehun and Bimabur on the Himalayan slopes, and between the jungles
  and the higher country where the pines and deodars are gathered together,
  ruled the petty Rajah, of whose wonderful treasure I am telling. Very great
  was the treasure, people said, for the Rajah had prospered all his days. He
  had found Mindapore a village, and, behold! it was a city. Below his fort of
  unhewn stone the flat-roofed huts of mud had multiplied; and now there sprang
  up houses with upstairs rooms, and the place which had once boasted no more
  than one buniah man, engendered a bazaar in the midst of it, as a fat oyster
  secretes a pearl. And the Holy Place up the river prospered, and the road up
  the passes was made safe. Merchants and fakirs multiplied about the wells,
  men came and went, twice even white men from the plain on missions to the
  people over beyond the deodars, and the streets of the town were ever denser
  with poultry and children, and little dogs dyed yellow, and with all the
  multitudinous rich odours of human increase. As at last, at the crown of his
  prosperity, this legend of his treasures began.</p>

  <p>He was a portly, yellow-faced man, with a long black beard, now steadily
  growing grey, thick lips, and shifty eyes. He was pious, very pious in his
  daily routine, and swift and unaccountable in his actions. None dared
  withstand him to his face, even in little things. Golam Shah, his vizier, was
  but a servant, a carrier of orders; and Samud Singh, his master of horse, but
  a driller of soldiers. They were tools, he would tell them outright in his
  pride of power, staves in his hand that he could break at his will. He was
  childless. And his cousin, the youth Azim Khan, feared him, and only in the
  remotest recesses of his heart dared to wish the Rajah would presently die
  and make a way for the cyons.</p>

  <p>It would be hard to say when first the rumour spread that the Rajah of
  little Mindapore was making a hoard. None knew how it began or where. Perhaps
  from merchants of whom he had bought. It began long before the days of the
  safe. It was said that rubies had been bought and hidden away; and then not
  only rubies, but ornaments of gold, and then pearls, and diamonds from
  Golconda, and all manner of precious stones. Even the Deputy-Commissioner at
  Allapore heard of it. At last the story re-entered the palace at Mindapore
  itself, and Azim Khan, who was the Rajah's cousin and his heir, and nominally
  his commander-in-chief, and Golam Shah, the chief minister, talked it over
  one with another in a tentative way.</p>

  <p>"He has something new," said Golam Shah, querulously; "he has something
  new, and he is keeping it from me."</p>

  <p>Azim Khan watched him cunningly, "I have told you what I have heard," he
  said. "For my own part I know nothing."</p>

  <p>"He goes to and fro musing and humming to himself," said Golam,
  meditatively, "as one who thinks of a pleasure."</p>

  <p>"More rubies, they are saying," said Azim, dreamily, and repeated, as if
  for his own pleasure, "Rubies." For Azim was the heir.</p>

  <p>"Especially is it since that Englishman came," said Golam, "three months
  ago. A big old man, not wrinkled as an old man should be, but red, and with
  red hair streaking his grey, and with a tight skin and a big body sticking
  out before. So. An elephant of a man, a great quivering mud-bank of a man,
  who laughed mightily, so that the people stopped.and listened in the street.
  He came, he laughed, and as he went away we heard them laugh
  together&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Azim.</p>

  <p>"He was a diamond merchant, perhaps&mdash;or a dealer in rubies. Do
  Englishmen deal in such things?"</p>

  <p>"Would I had seen him!" said Azim. "He took gold away," said Golam.</p>

  <p>Botli were silent for a space, and the purring noise of the wheel of the
  upper well, and the chatter of voices about it rising and falling, made a
  pleasant sound in the air. "Since the Englishman went," said Golam, "he has
  been different. He hides something from me&mdash;something in his robe.
  Rubies! What else can it be?"</p>

  <p>"He has not buried it?" said Azim.</p>

  <p>"He will. Then he will want to dig it up again and look at it," said
  Golam, for he was a man of experience. "I go softly. Sometimes almost I come
  upon him. Then he starts&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He grows old and nervous," said Azim, and there was a pause.</p>

  <p>"Before the English came," said Golam, looking at the rings upon his
  fingers, as he recurred to his constant preoccupation; "there were no Rajahs
  nervous and old."</p>

  <p>That, I say, was even before the corning of the safe. It came in a packing
  case. Such a case it was as had never been seen before on all the slopes of
  the Himalayan mountains, it was an elephant's burden even on the plain. It
  was days drawing nearer and nearer. At Allapore crowds went to see it pass
  upon the railway. Afterwards elephants and then a great multitude of men
  dragged it up the hills. And this great case being opened in the Hall of
  Audience revealed within itself a monstrous iron box, like no other box that
  had ever come to the city. It had been made, so the story went, by
  necromancers in England, expressly to the order of the Rajah, that he might
  keep his treasure therein and sleep in peace. It was so hard that the hardest
  files powdered upon its corners, and so strong that cannon fired point-blank
  at it would have produced no effect upon it. And it locked with a magic lock.
  There was a word, and none knew the word but the Rajah. With that word, and a
  little key that hung about his neck, one could open the lock; but without it
  none could do so.</p>

  <p>The Rajah caused this safe to be built into the wall of his palace in a
  little room beyond the Hall of Audience. He superintended the building up of
  it with jealous eyes. And thereafter he would go thither day by day, once at
  least every day, coming back with brighter eyes. "He goes to count his
  treasure," said Golam Shah, standing beside the empty dais.</p>

  <p>And in those days it was that the Rajah began to change. He who had been
  cunning and subtle became choleric and outspoken. His judgment grew harsh,
  and a taint that seemed to all about him to be assuredly the taint of avarice
  crept into his acts. Moreover, which inclined Golam Shah to hopefulness, he
  seemed to take a dislike to Azim Khan. Once indeed he made a kind of speech
  in the Hall of Audience. Therein he declared many times over in a peculiarly
  husky voice, husky yet full of conviction, that Azim Khan was not worth a
  half anna, not worth a half anna to any human soul.</p>

  <p>In these latter days of the Rajah's decline, moreover, when merchants
  came, he would go aside with them secretly into the little room, and speak
  low, so that those in the Hall of Audience, howsoever they strained their
  ears, could hear nothing of his speech. These things Golam Shah and Azim Khan
  and Samud Singh, who had joined their councils, treasured in their
  hearts.</p>

  <p>"It is true about the treasure," said Azim; "they talked of it round the
  well of the travellers, even the merchants from Tibet had heard the tale, and
  had come this way with jewels of price, and afterwards they went secretly
  telling no one." And ever and again, it was said, came a negro mute from the
  plains, with secret parcels for the Rajah. "Another stone," was the rumour
  that went the round of the city.</p>

  <p>"The bee makes hoards," said Azim Khan, the Rajah's heir, sitting in the
  upper chamber of Golam Shah. "Therefore, we will wait awhile." For Azim was
  more coward than traitor.</p>

  <p>At last there were men in the Deccan even who could tell you particulars
  of the rubies and precious stones that the Rajah had gathered together. But
  so circumspect was the Rajah that Azim Khan and Golam Shah had never even set
  eyes on the glittering heaps that they knew were accumulating in the
  safe.</p>

  <p>The Rajah always went into the little room alone, and even then he locked
  the door of the little room&mdash;it had a couple of locks&mdash;.before he
  went to the safe and used the magic word. How all the ministers and officers
  and guards listened and looked at one another as the door of the room behind
  the curtain closed!</p>

  <p>The Rajah changed indeed, in these days, not only in the particulars of
  his rule, but in his appearance. "He is growing old. How fast he grows old!
  The time is almost ripe," whispered Samud Singh. The Rajah's hand became
  tremulous, his step was now sometimes unsteady, and his memory curiously
  defective. He would come back out from the treasure-room, and his hand would
  tighten fiercely on the curtain, and he would stumble on the steps of the
  dais. "His eyesight fails," said Golam. "See!&mdash;His turban is askew. He
  is sleepy even in the forenoon, before the heat of the day. His judgments are
  those of a child."</p>

  <p>It was a painful sight to see a man so suddenly old and enfeebled still
  ruling men.</p>

  <p>"He may go on yet, a score of years," said Golam Shah.</p>

  <p>"Should a ruler hoard riches," said Shere Ali, in the guardroom, "and
  leave his soldiers unpaid?" That was the beginning of the end.</p>

  <p>It was the thought of the treasure won over the soldiers, even as it did
  the mollahs and the eunuchs. Why had the Rajah not buried it in some
  unthinkable place, as his father had done before him, and killed the diggers
  with his hand? "He has hoarded," said Samud, with a chuckle,&mdash;for the
  old Rajah had once pulled his beard,&mdash;"only to pay for his own undoing."
  And in order to insure confidence, Golam Shah went beyond the truth perhaps,
  and gave a sketchy account of the treasures to this man and that, even as a
  casual eye-witness might do.</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly and swiftly, the palace revolution was accomplished. When
  the lonely old Rajah was killed, a shot was to be fired from the harem
  lattice, bugles were to be blown, and the sepoys were to turn out in the
  square before the palace, and fire a volley in the air. The murder was done
  in the dark save for a little red lamp that burnt in the corner. Azim knelt
  on the body and held up the wet beard, and cut the throat wide and deep to
  make sure. It was so easy! Why had he waited so long? And then, with his
  hands covered with warm blood, he sprang up eagerly&mdash;Rajah at
  last!&mdash;and followed Golam and Samud and the eunuchs down the long,
  faintly moonlit passage, towards the Hall of Audience.</p>

  <p>As they did so, the crack of a rifle sounded far away, and after a pause
  came the first awakening noises of the town. One of the eunuchs had an iron
  bar, and Samud carried a pistol in his hand. He fired into the locks of the
  treasure-room, and wrecked them, and the eunuch smashed the door in. Then
  they all rushed in together, none standing aside for Azim. It was dark, and
  the second eunuch went reluctantly to get a torch, in fear lest his fellow
  murderers should open the safe in his absence.</p>

  <p>But he need have had no fear. The cardinal event of that night is the
  triumphant vindication of the advertised merits of Chobbs' unrivalled safes.
  The tumult that occurred between the Mindapore sepoys and the people need not
  concern us. The people loved not the new Rajah&mdash;let that suffice. The
  conspirators got the key from round the dead Rajah's neck, and tried a
  multitude of the magic words of the English that Samud Singh knew, even such
  words as "Kemup" and "Gorblimey"&mdash;in vain.</p>

  <p>In the morning, the safe in the treasure-room remained intact and defiant,
  the woodwork about it smashed to splinters, and great chunks of stone knocked
  out of the wall, dents abundantly scattered over its impregnable door, and a
  dust of files below. And the shifty Golam had to explain the matter to the
  soldiers and mollahs as best he could. This was an extremely difficult thing
  to do, because in no kind of business is prompt cash so necessary as in the
  revolutionary line.</p>

  <p>The state of affairs for the next few days in Mindapore was exceedingly
  strained. One fact stands out prominently, that Azim Khan was hopelessly
  feeble. The soldiers would not at first believe in the exemplary integrity of
  the safe, and a deputation insisted in the most occidental manner in
  verifying the new Rajah's statements. Moreover, the populace clamoured, and
  then by a naked man running, came the alarming intelligence that the new
  Deputy-Commissioner at Allapore was coming headlong and with soldiers to
  verify the account of the revolution Golam Shah and Samud Singh had sent him
  in the name of Azim.</p>

  <p>The new Deputy-Commissioner was a raw young man, partly obscured by a pith
  helmet, and chock full of zeal and the desire for distinction; and he had
  heard of the treasure. He was going, he said, to sift the matter thoroughly.
  On the arrival of this distressing intelligence there was a hasty and
  informal council of state (at which Azim was not present), a
  counter-revolution was arranged, and all that Azim ever learnt of it was the
  sound of a footfall behind him, and the cold touch of a pistol barrel on the
  neck.</p>

  <p>When the Commissioner arrived, that dexterous statesman, Golam Shah, and
  that honest soldier, Samud Singh, were ready to receive him, and they had two
  corpses, several witnesses, and a neat little story. In addition to Azim they
  had shot an unpopular officer of the Mindapore sepoys. They told the
  Commissioner how Azim had plotted against the Rajah and raised a military
  revolt, and how the people, who loved the old Rajah, even as Golam Shah and
  Samud Singh loved him, had quelled the revolt, and how peace was restored
  again. And Golam explained how Azim had fought for life even in the Hall of
  Audience, and how he, Golam, had been wounded in the struggle, and how Samud
  had shot Azim with his own hand.</p>

  <p>And the Deputy-Commissioner, being weak in his dialect, had swallowed it
  all. All round the Deputy-Commissioner, in the minds of the people, the
  palace, and the city, hung the true story of the case, as it seemed to Golam
  Shah, like an avalanche ready to fall; and yet the Deputy-Commissioner did
  not learn of it for four days. And Golam and Samud went to and fro,
  whispering and pacifying, promising to get at the treasure as soon as the
  Deputy-Commissioner could be got out of the way. And as they went to and fro
  so also the report went to and fro&mdash;that Golam and Samud had opened the
  safe and hidden the treasure, and closed and locked it again; and bright eyes
  watched them curiously and hungrily even as they had watched the Rajah in the
  days that were gone.</p>

  <p>"This city is no longer an abiding place for you and me," said Golam Shah,
  in a moment of clear insight. "They are mad about this treasure. Golconda
  would not satisfy them."</p>

  <p>The Deputy-Commissioner, when he heard their story, did indeed make
  knowing inquiries (as knowing as the knowingness of the English goes) in
  order to show himself not too credulous; but he elicited nothing. He had
  heard tales of treasure. had the "Commissioner, and of a great box? So had
  Golam and Samud, but where it was they could not tell. They too had certainly
  heard tales of treasure&mdash;many tales indeed. Perhaps there was
  treasure.</p>

  <p>Had the Deputy-Commissioner had the scientific turn of mind, he would have
  observed that a strong smell of gunpowder still hung about the Audience
  Chamber, more than was explained by the narrative told him; and had he
  explored the adjacent apartments, he would presently have discovered the
  small treasure-room with its smashed locks, and the ceiling now dependent
  ruins, and amid the ruins the safe, bulging perilously from the partly
  collapsed walls, but still unconquered, and with its treasures unexplored.
  Also it is a fact that Golam Shah's bandaged hand was not the consequence of
  heroism in combat, but of certain private blasting operations too
  amateurishly prosecuted.</p>

  <p>So you have the situation: Deputy-Commissioner installed in the palace,
  sending incorrect information to headquarters and awaiting instructions, the
  safe as safe as ever; assistant conspirators grumbling louder and louder; and
  Golam and Samud getting more and more desperate lest this voice should reach
  the Deputy's ears.</p>

  <p>Then came the night when the Commissioner heard a filing and a tapping,
  and being a brave man, rose and went forthwith, alone and very quietly,
  across the Hall of Audience, pistol in hand, in search of the sound. Across
  the hall a light came from an open door that had been hidden in the day by a
  curtain. Stopping silently in the darkness of the outer apartment, he looked
  into the treasure-room. And there stood Golam with his arm in a sling,
  holding a lantern, while Samud fumbled with pieces of wire and some little
  keys. They were without boots, but otherwise they were dressed ready for a
  journey.</p>

  <p>The Deputy-Commissioner was, for a Government official, an exceedingly
  quick-witted man. He slipped back in the darkness again, and within five
  minutes, Golam and Samud, still fumbling, heard footsteps hurrying across the
  Hall of Audience, and saw a flicker of light. Out went their lantern, with a
  groan because of a bandaged arm, but it was too late. In another moment
  Lieutenant Earl, in pyjamas and boots, but with a brace of revolvers and a
  couple of rifles behind him, stood in the doorway of the treasure-room, and
  Golam and Samud were caught. Samud clicked his pistol and then threw it down,
  for it was three to one&mdash;Golam being not only a bandaged man, but
  fundamentally a man of peace.</p>

  <p>When the intelligence of this treachery filtered from the palace into the
  town, there was an outbreak of popular feeling, and a dozen officious persons
  set out to tell the Deputy-Commissioner the true connection between Golam,
  Samud, and the death of the Rajah. The first to penetrate to the Deputy-
  Commissioner's presence was an angry fakir, from the colony that dwelt about
  the Holy place. And after a patient hearing the Deputy-Commissioner extracted
  the thread of the narrative from the fabric of curses in which the holy man
  presented it.</p>

  <p>"This is most singular," said the Deputy-Commissioner to the Lieutenant,
  standing in the treasure-room (which looked as though the palace had been
  bombarded), and regarding the battered but still inviolable safe. "Here we
  seem to have the key of the whole position."</p>

  <p>"Key!" said the Lieutenant. "It's the key they haven't got."</p>

  <p>"Curious mingling of the new and the old," said the Deputy-Commissioner.
  "Patent safe&mdash;and a hoard."</p>

  <p>"Send to Allapore and wire Chobbs, I suppose?" said the Lieutenant.</p>

  <p>The Deputy-Commissioner signified that was his intention, and they set
  guards before and behind and all about the treasure-room, until the proper
  instructions about the lock should come.</p>

  <p>So it was that the <i>Pax Britannica</i> solemnly took possession of the
  Rajah's hoard, and men in Simla heard the news, and envied that Deputy-
  Commissioner his adventure with all their hearts. For his promptitude and
  decision was a matter of praise, and they said that Mindapore would certainly
  be annexed and added to the district over which he ruled. Only a fat old man
  named MacTurk, living in Allapore, a big man with a noisy quivering laugh,
  and a secret trade with certain native potentates, did not hear the news,
  excepting only the news of the murder of the Rajah and the departure of the
  Deputy-Commissioner, for several days. He heard nothing of the disposition of
  the treasure&mdash;an unfortunate thing, since, among other things, he had
  sold the Rajah his safe, and may even have known the word by which the lock
  was opened.</p>

  <p>The Deputy-Commissioner had theatrical tastes. These he gratified under
  the excuse that display was above all things necessary in dealing with
  Orientals. He imprisoned his four malefactors theatrically, and when the
  instructions came from Chobbs he had the safe lugged into the Hall of
  Audience, in order to open it with more effect. The Commissioner sat on the
  dais, while the engineer worked at the safe on the crimson steps.</p>

  <p>In the central space was stretched a large white cloth. It reminded the
  Deputy-Commissioner of a picture he had seen of Alexander at Damascus
  receiving the treasures of Darius.</p>

  <p>"It is gold," said one bystander to another. "There was a sound of
  chinking as they brought the safe in. My brother was among those who
  hauled."</p>

  <p>The engineer clicked the lock. Every eye in the Hall of Audience grew
  brighter and keener, excepting the eyes of the Deputy-Commissioner.</p>

  <p>He felt the dignity of his responsibilities, and sat upon the dais looking
  as much like the Pax Britannica as possible.</p>

  <p>"Holy Smoke!" said the engineer, and slammed the safe again. A murmur of
  exclamations ran round the hall. Every one was asking every one else what
  they had seen.</p>

  <p>"An asp!" said some one.</p>

  <p>The Deputy-Commissioner lost? his imperturbability. "What is it?" he said,
  springing to his feet. The engineer leant across the safe and whispered two
  words, something indistinct and with a blasphemous adjective in front.</p>

  <p><i>"What?"</i> said the Deputy-Commissioner, sharply.</p>

  <p>"Glass!" said the engineer, in a bitter whisper. "Broken bottles.
  'Undreds!"</p>

  <p>"Let me see!" said the Deputy-Commissioner, losing all his dignity.</p>

  <p>"Scotch, if I'm not mistaken," said the engineer, sniffing curiously.</p>

  <p>"Curse it 1" said the Deputy-Commissioner, and looked up to meet a
  multitude of ironical eyes. "Er&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The assembly is dismissed," said the Deputy-Commissioner.</p>

  <p>"What a <i>fool</i> he must have looked!" wheezed MacTurk, who did not
  like the Deputy-Commissioner. "What a <i>fool</i> he must have looked!
  "Simple enough," said MacTurk, "when you know how it came about."</p>

  <p>"But how did it come about?" asked the station-master.</p>

  <p>"Secret drinking," said MacTurk. "Bourbon whiskey. I taught him how to
  take it myself. But he didn't dare let on that he was doing it, poor old
  chap! Mindapore's one of the most fanatically Mahometan states in the hills
  you see. And he always was a secretive kind of chap, and given to doing
  things by himself. So he got that safe to hide it in, and keep the bottles.
  Broke 'em up to pack, I s'pose, when it got too full. Lord! I might ha'
  known. When people spoke of his treasure&mdash;I never thought of putting
  that and the safe and the Bourbon together! But how plain it is! And
  <i>what</i> a sell for Parkinson. Pounded glass! The accumulation of years!
  Lord!&mdash;I'd 'a' given a couple of stone off my weight to see him open
  that safe!"</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i>, August 1, 1896</h3>

  <p>The lieutenant stood in front of the steel sphere and gnawed a piece of
  pine splinter. "What do you think of it, Steevens?" he said.</p>

  <p>"It's an idea," said Steevens, in the tone of one who keeps an open
  mind.</p>

  <p>"I believe it will smash&mdash;flat," said the lieutenant.</p>

  <p>"He seems to have calculated it all out pretty well," said Steevens, still
  impartial.</p>

  <p>"But think of the pressure," said the lieutenant. "At the surface of the
  water it's fourteen pounds to the inch, thirty feet down it's double that;
  sixty, treble; ninety, four times; nine hundred, forty times; five thousand,
  three hundred&mdash;that's a mile&mdash;it's two hundred and forty times
  fourteen pounds; that's&mdash;let's see&mdash;thirty hundredweight&mdash;a
  ton and a half, Steevens; a ton and a half to the square inch. And the ocean
  where he's going is five miles deep. That's seven and a half&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sounds a lot," said Steevens, "but it's jolly thick steel."</p>

  <p>The lieutenant made no answer, but resumed his pine splinter. The object
  of their conversation was a huge ball of steel, having an exterior diameter
  of perhaps nine feet. It looked like the shot for some Titanic piece of
  artillery. It was elaborately nested in a monstrous scaffolding built into
  the framework of the vessel, and the gigantic spars that were presently to
  sling it overboard gave the stern of the ship an appearance that had raised
  the curiosity of every decent sailor who had sighted it, from the Pool of
  London to the Tropic of Capricorn. In two places, one above the other, the
  steel gave place to a couple of circular windows of enormously thick glass,
  and one of these, set in steel frame of great solidity, was now partially
  unscrewed. Both the men had seen the interior of this globe for the first
  time that morning. It was elaborately padded with air cushions, with little
  studs sunk between bulging pillows to work the simple mechanism of the
  affair. Everything was elaborately padded, even the Myers apparatus which was
  to absorb carbonic acid and replace the oxygen inspired by its tenant, when
  he had crept in by the glass manhole, and had been screwed in. It was so
  elaborately padded that a man might have been fired from a gun in it with
  perfect safety. And it had need to be, for presently a man was to crawl in
  through that glass manhole, to be screwed up tightly, and to be flung
  overboard, and to sink down&mdash;down&mdash;down, for five miles, even as
  the lieutenant said. It had taken the strongest hold of his imagination; it
  made him a bore at mess; and he found Steevens the new arrival aboard, a
  godsend to talk to about it, over and over again.</p>

  <p>"It's my opinion," said the lieutenant, "that, that glass will simply bend
  in and bulge and smash, under a pressure of that sort. Daubree has made rocks
  run like water under big pressures&mdash;and you mark my words&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If the glass did break in," said Steevens, "what then?"</p>

  <p>"The water would shoot in like a jet of iron. Have you ever felt a
  straight jet of high pressure water? It would hit as hard as a bullet. It
  would simply smash him and flatten him. It would tear down his throat, and
  into his lungs; it would blow in his ears&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What a detailed imagination you have!" protested Steevens, who saw things
  vividly.</p>

  <p>"It's a simple statement of the inevitable," said the lieutenant.</p>

  <p>"And the globe?"</p>

  <p>"Would just give out a few little bubbles, and it would settle down
  comfortably against the Day of Judgment, among the oozes and the bottom clay
  &mdash;with poor Elstead spread over his own smashed cushions like butter
  over bread."</p>

  <p>He repeated this sentence as though he liked it very much. "Like butter
  over bread," he said.</p>

  <p>"Having a look at the jigger?" said a voice, and Elstead stood behind
  them, spick and span in white, with a cigarette between his teeth, and his
  eyes smiling out of the shadow of his ample hat-brim. "What's that about
  bread and butter, Weybridge? Grumbling as usual about the insufficient pay of
  naval officers? It won't be more than a day now before I start. We are to get
  the slings ready to-day. This clean sky and gentle swell is just the kind of
  thing for swinging off a dozen tons of lead and iron, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It won't affect you much," said Weybridge.</p>

  <p>"No. Seventy or eighty feet down, and I shall be there in a dozen seconds,
  there's not a particle moving, though the wind shriek itself hoarse up above,
  and the water lifts halfway to the clouds. No. Down there&mdash;" He moved to
  the side of the ship and the other two followed him. All three leant forward
  on their elbows and stared down into the yellow-green water.</p>

  <p>"Peace," said Elstead, finishing his thought aloud.</p>

  <p>"Are you dead certain that clockwork will act?" asked Weybridge
  presently.</p>

  <p>"It has worked thirty-five times," said Elstead. "It's bound to work."</p>

  <p>"But if it doesn't?"</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't go down in that confounded thing," said Weybridge, "for twenty
  thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"Cheerful chap you are," said Elstead, and spat sociably at a bubble
  below.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand yet how you mean to work the thing," said
  Steevens.</p>

  <p>"In the first place, I'm screwed into the sphere," said Elstead, "and when
  I've turned the electric light off on three times to show I'm cheerful, I'm
  swung out over the stern by that crane, with all those big lead sinkers slung
  below me. The top lead weight has a roller carrying a hundred fathoms of
  strong cord rolled up, and that's all that joins the sinkers to the sphere,
  except the slings that will be cut when the affair is dropped. We use cord
  rather than wire rope because it's easier to cut and more
  buoyant&mdash;necessary points, as you will see.</p>

  <p>"Through each of these lead weights you notice there is a hole, and an
  iron rod will be run through that and will project six feet on the lower
  side. If that rod is rammed up from below, it knocks up a lever and sets the
  clockwork in motion at the side of the cylinder on which the cord winds.</p>

  <p>"Very well. The whole affair is lowered gently into the water, and the
  slings are cut. The sphere floats&mdash;, with the air in it, it's lighter
  than water&mdash;, but the lead weights go down straight and the cord runs
  out. When the cord is all paid out, the sphere will go down too, pulled down
  by the cord."</p>

  <p>"But why the cord?" asked Steevens. "Why not fasten the weights directly
  to the sphere?"</p>

  <p>"Because of the smash down below. The whole affair will go rushing down,
  mile after mile, at a headlong pace at last. It would be knocked to pieces on
  the bottom if it wasn't for that cord. But the weights will hit the bottom,
  and directly they do, the buoyancy of the sphere will come into play. It will
  go on sinking slower and slower; come to stop at last, and then begin to
  float upward again.</p>

  <p>"That's where the clockwork comes in. Directly the weights smash against
  the sea bottom, the rod will be knocked through and will kick up the
  clockwork, and the cord will be rewound on the reel. I shall be lugged down
  to the sea bottom. There I shall stay for half an hour, with the electric
  light on, looking about me. Then the clockwork will release a spring knife,
  the cord will be cut, and up I shall rush again, like a soda-water bubble.
  The cord itself will help the flotation."</p>

  <p>"And if you should chance to hit a ship?" said Weybridge.</p>

  <p>"I should come up at such a pace, I should go clean through it," said
  Elstead, "like a cannon ball. You needn't worry about that."</p>

  <p>"And suppose some nimble crustacean should wriggle into your
  clockwork&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It would be a pressing sort of invitation for me to stop," said Elstead,
  turning his back on the water and staring at the sphere.</p>

  <p>They had swung Elstead overboard by eleven o'clock. The day was serenely
  bright and calm, with the horizon lost in haze. The electric glare in the
  little upper compartment beamed cheerfully three times. Then they let him
  down slowly to the surface of the water, and a sailor in the stern chains
  hung ready to cut the tackle that held the lead weights and the sphere
  together. The globe, which had looked so large on deck, looked the smallest
  thing conceivable under the stern of the ship. It rolled a little, and its
  two dark windows, which floated uppermost, seemed like eyes turned up in
  round wonderment at the people who crowded the rail. A voice wondered how
  Elstead liked the rolling. "Are you ready?" sang out the commander. "Ay, ay,
  sir!" "Then let her go!"</p>

  <p>The rope of the tackle tightened against the blade and was cut, and an
  eddy rolled over the globe in a grotesquely helpless fashion. Someone waved a
  handkerchief, someone else tried an ineffectual cheer, a middy was counting
  slowly, "Eight, nine, ten!" Another roll, then a jerk and a splash the thing
  righted itself.</p>

  <p>It seemed to be stationary for a moment, to grow rapidly smaller, and then
  the water closed over it, and it became visible, enlarged by refraction and
  dimmer, below the surface. Before one could count three it had disappeared.
  There was a flicker of white light far down in the water, that diminished to
  a speck and vanished. Then there was nothing but a depth of water going down
  into blackness, through which a shark was swimming.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the screw of the cruiser began to rotate, the water was
  crickled, the shark disappeared in a wrinkled confusion, and a torrent of
  foam rushed across the crystalline clearness that had swallowed up Elstead.
  "What's the idea?" said one A.B. to another.</p>

  <p>"We're going to lay off about a couple of miles, 'fear he should hit us
  when he comes up," said his mate.</p>

  <p>The ship steamed slowly to her new position. Aboard her almost everyone
  who was unoccupied remained watching the breathing swell into which the
  sphere had sunk. For the next half-hour it is doubtful if a word was spoken
  that did not bear directly or indirectly on Elstead. The December sun was now
  high in the sky, and the heat very considerable.</p>

  <p>"He'll be cold enough down there," said Weybridge. "They say that below a
  certain depth sea water's always just about freezing."</p>

  <p>"Where'll he come up?" asked Steevens. "I've lost my bearings."</p>

  <p>"That's the spot," said the commander, who prided himself on his
  omniscience. He extended a precise finger south-eastward. "And this, I
  reckon, is pretty nearly the moment," he said. "He's been thirty-five
  minutes."</p>

  <p>"How long dose it take to reach the bottom of the ocean?" asked
  Steevens.</p>

  <p>"For a depth of five miles, and reckoning&mdash;as we did&mdash;an
  acceleration of two feet per second, both ways, is just about three-quarters
  of a minute."</p>

  <p>"Then he's overdue," said Weybridge.</p>

  <p>"Pretty nearly," said the commander. "I suppose it takes a few minutes for
  that cord of his to wind in."</p>

  <p>"I forgot that," said Weybridge, evidently relieved.</p>

  <p>And then began the suspense. A minute slowly dragged itself out, and no
  sphere shot out of the water. Another followed, and nothing broke the low
  oily swell. The sailors explained to one another that little point about the
  winding-in of the cord. The rigging was dotted with expectant faces. "Come
  up, Elstead!" called one hairy-chested salt impatiently, and the others
  caught it up, and shouted as though they were waiting for the curtain of a
  theatre to rise.</p>

  <p>The commander glanced irritably at them.</p>

  <p>"Of course, if the acceleration's less than two," he said, "he'll be all
  the longer. We aren't absolutely certain that was the proper figure. I'm no
  slavish believer in calculations."</p>

  <p>Steevens agreed concisely. No one on the quarter-deck spoke for a couple
  of minutes. Then Steevens' watchcase clicked.</p>

  <p>When, twenty-one minutes after the sun reached the zenith, they were still
  waiting for the globe to reappear, and not a man aboard had dared to whisper
  that hope was dead. It was Weybridge who first gave expression to that
  realisation. He spoke while the sound of eight bells still hung in the air.
  "I always distrusted that window," he said quite suddenly to Steevens.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Steevens; "you don't think&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Well!" said Weybridge, and left the rest to his imagination.</p>

  <p>"I'm no great believer in calculations myself," said the commander
  dubiously, "so that I'm not altogether hopeless yet." And at midnight the
  gunboat was steaming slowly in a spiral round the spot where the globe had
  sunk, and the white beam of the electric light fled and halted and swept
  discontentedly onward again over the waste of phosphorescent waters under the
  little stars.</p>

  <p>"If his window hasn't burst and smashed him," said Weybridge, "then it's a
  cursed sight worse, for his clockwork has gone wrong, and he's alive now,
  five miles under our feet, down there in the cold and dark, anchored in that
  little bubble of his, where never a ray of light has shone or a human being
  lived, since the waters were gathered together. He's there without food,
  feeling hungry and thirsty and scared, wondering whether he'll starve or
  stifle. Which will it be? The Myers apparatus is running out, I suppose. How
  long do they last?"</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" he exclaimed; "What little things we are! What daring
  little devils! Down there, miles and miles of water&mdash;all water, and all
  this empty water about us and this sky. Gulfs!" He threw his hands out, and
  as he did so, a little white streak swept noiselessly up the sky, travelled
  more slowly, stopped, became a motionless dot, as though a new star had
  fallen up into the sky. Then it went sliding back again and lost itself
  amidst the reflections of the stars and the white haze of the sea's
  phosphorescence.</p>

  <p>At the sight he stopped, arm extended and mouth open. He shut his mouth,
  opened it again, and waved his arms with an impatient gesture. Then he
  turned, shouted "El-stead ahoy!" to the first watch, and went at a run to
  Lindley and the search-light. "I saw him," he said "Starboard there! His
  light's on, and he's just shot out of the water. Bring the light round. We
  ought to see him drifting, when he lifts on the swell."</p>

  <p>But they never picked up the explorer until dawn. Then they almost ran him
  down. The crane was swung out and a boat's crew hooked the chain to the
  sphere. When they had shipped the sphere, they unscrewed the manhole and
  peered into the darkness of the interior (for the electric light chamber was
  intended to illuminate the water about the sphere, and was shut off entirely
  from its general cavity).</p>

  <p>The air was very hot within the cavity, and the indiarubber at the lip of
  the manhole was soft. There was no answer to their eager questions and no
  sound of movement within. Elstead seemed to be lying motionless, crumpled in
  the bottom of the globe. The ship's doctor crawled in and lifted him out to
  the men outside. For a moment or so they did not know whether Elstead was
  alive or dead. His face, in the yellow light of the ship's lamps, glistened
  with perspiration. They carried him down to his own cabin.</p>

  <p>He was not dead, they found, but in a state of absolute nervous collapse,
  and besides cruelly bruised. For some days he had to lie perfectly still. It
  was a week before he could tell his experiences.</p>

  <p>Almost his first words were that he was going down again. The sphere would
  have to be altered, he said, in order to allow him to throw off the cord if
  need be, and that was all. He had, had the most marvellous experience. "You
  thought I should find nothing but ooze," he said. "You laughed at my
  explorations, and I've discovered a new world!" He told his story in
  disconnected fragments, and chiefly from the wrong end, so that it is
  impossible to re-tell it in his words. But what follows is the narrative of
  his experience.</p>

  <p>It began atrociously, he said. Before the cord ran out, the thing kept
  rolling over. He felt like a frog in a football. He could see nothing but the
  crane and the sky overhead, with an occasional glimpse of people on the ships
  rail. He couldn't tell a bit which way the thing would roll next. Suddenly he
  would find his footing going up, and try to step, and over he went rolling,
  head over heels, and just anyhow, on the padding. Any other shape would have
  been more comfortable, but no other shape was to be relied upon under the
  huge pressure of the nethermost abyss.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the swaying ceased; the globe righted, and when he had picked
  himself up, he saw the water all about him greeny-blue, with an attenuated
  light filtering down from above, and a shoal of little floating things went
  rushing up past him, as it seemed to him, towards the light. And even as he
  looked, it grew darker and darker, until the water above was as dark as the
  midnight sky, albeit of greener shade, and the water below black. And little
  transparent things in the water developed a faint glint of luminosity, and
  shot past him in faint greenish streaks.</p>

  <p>And the feeling of falling! It was just like the start of a lift, he said,
  only it kept on. One has to imagine what that means, that keeping on. It was
  then of all times that Elstead repented of his adventure. He saw the chances
  against him in an altogether new light. He thought of the big cuttle-fish
  people knew to exist in the middle waters, the kind of things they find half
  digested in whales at times, or floating dead and rotten and half eaten by
  fish. Suppose one caught hold and wouldn't let go. And had the clockwork
  really been sufficiently tested? But whether he wanted to go on or go back
  mattered not the slightest now.</p>

  <p>In fifty seconds everything was as black as night outside, except where
  the beam from his light struck through the waters, and picked out every now
  and then some fish or scrap of sinking matter. They flashed by too fast for
  him to see what they were. Once he thinks he passed a shark. And then the
  sphere began to get hot by friction against the water. They had
  underestimated this, it seems.</p>

  <p>The first thing he noticed was that he was perspiring, and then he heard a
  hissing growing louder under his feet, and saw a lot of little bubbles
  &mdash;very little bubbles they were&mdash;rushing upward like a fan through
  the water outside. Steam! He felt the window, and it was hot. He turned on
  the minute glow-lamp that lit his own cavity, looked at the padded watch by
  the studs, and saw he had been travelling now for two minutes. It came into
  his head that the window would crack through the conflict of temperatures,
  for he knew the bottom water is very near freezing.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the floor of the sphere seemed to press against his feet,
  the rush of bubbles outside grew slower and slower, and the hissing
  diminished. The sphere rolled a little. The window had not cracked, nothing
  had given, and he knew that the dangers of sinking, at any rate, were
  over.</p>

  <p>In another minute or so he would be on the floor of the abyss. He thought,
  he said, of Steevens and Weybridge and the rest of them five miles overhead,
  higher to him than the highest clouds that ever floated over land are to us,
  steaming slowly and staring down and wondering what had happened to him.</p>

  <p>He peered out of the window. There were no more bubbles now, and the
  hissing had stopped. Outside there was a heavy blackness&mdash;as black as
  black velvet&mdash;except where the electric light pierced the empty water
  and showed the colour of it&mdash;a yellow-green. Then three things like
  shapes of fire swam into sight, following each other through the water.
  Whether they were little and near or big and far off he could not tell.</p>

  <p>Each was outlined in a bluish light almost as bright as the lights of a
  fishing smack, a light which seemed to be smoking greatly, and all along the
  sides of them were specks of this, like the lighter portholes of a ship.
  Their phosphorescence seemed to go out as they came into the radiance of his
  lamp, and he saw then that they were little fish of some strange sort, with
  huge heads, vast eyes, and dwindling bodies and tails. Their eyes were turned
  towards him, and he judged they were following him down. He supposed they
  were attracted by his glare.</p>

  <p>Presently others of the same sort joined them. As he went on down, he
  noticed that the water became of a pallid colour, and that little specks
  twinkled in his ray like motes in a sunbeam. This was probably due to the
  clouds of ooze and mud that the impact of his leaden sinkers had
  disturbed.</p>

  <p>By the time he was drawn down to the lead weights he was in a dense fog of
  white that his electric light failed altogether to pierce for more than a few
  yards, and many minutes elapsed before the hanging sheets of sediment
  subsided to any extent. Then, lit by his light and by the transient
  phosphorescence of a distant shoal of fishes, he was able to see under the
  huge blackness of the super-incumbent water an undulting expanse of
  greyish-white ooze, broken here and there by tangled thickets of a growth of
  sea lilies, waving hungry tentacles in the air.</p>

  <p>Farther away were the graceful, translucent outlines of a group of
  gigantic sponges. About this floor there were scattered a number of bristling
  flattish tufts of rich purple and black, which he decided must be some sort
  of sea-urchin, and small, large-eyed or blind things having a curious
  resemblance, some to woodlice, and others to lobsters, crawled sluggishly
  across the track of the light and vanished into the obscurity again, leaving
  furrowed trails behind them.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the hovering swarm of little fishes veered about and came
  towards him as a flight of starlings might do. They passed over him like a
  phosphorescent snow, and then he saw behind them some larger creature
  advancing towards the sphere.</p>

  <p>At first he could see it only dimly, a faintly moving figure remotely
  suggestive of a walking man, and then it came into the spray of light that
  the lamp shot out. As the glare struck it, it shut its eyes, dazzled. He
  stared in rigid astonishment.</p>

  <p>It was a strange vertebrated animal. Its dark purple head was dimly
  suggestive of a chameleon, but it had such a high forehead and such a
  braincase as no reptile ever displayed before; the vertical pitch of its face
  gave it a most extraordinary resemblance to a human being.</p>

  <p>Two large and protruding eyes projected from sockets in chameleon fashion,
  and it had a broad reptilian mouth with horny lips beneath its little
  nostrils. In the position of the ears were two huge gill-covers, and out of
  these floated a branching tree of coralline filaments, almost like the tree-
  like gills that very young rays and sharks possess.</p>

  <p>But the humanity of the face was not the most extraordinary thing about
  the creature. It was a biped; its almost globular body was poised on a tripod
  of two frog-like legs and a long thick tail, and its fore limbs, which
  grotesquely caricatured the human hand, much as a frog's do, carried a long
  shaft of bone, tipped with copper. The colour of the creature was variegated;
  its head, hands and legs were purple; but its skin, which hung loosely upon
  it, even as clothes might do, was a phosphorescent grey. And it stood there
  blinded by the light.</p>

  <p>At last this unknown creature of the abyss blinked its eyes open, and
  shading them with its disengaged hand, opened its mouth and gave vent to a
  shouting noise, articulate almost as speech might be, that penetrated even
  the steel case and padded jacket of the sphere. How a shouting may be
  accomplished without lungs Elstead dose not profess to explain. It then moved
  sideways out of the glare into the mystery of shadow that bordered it on
  either side, and Elstead felt rather than saw that it was coming towards him.
  Fancying the light had attracted it, he turned the switch that cut off the
  current. In another moment something soft dabbed upon the steel, and the
  globe swayed.</p>

  <p>Then the shouting was repeated, and it seemed to him that a distant echo
  answered it. The dabbing recurred, and the whole globe swayed and ground
  against the spindle over which the wire was rolled. He stood in the blackness
  and peered out into the everlasting night of the abyss. And presently he saw,
  very faint and remote, other phosphorescent quasi-human forms hurrying
  towards him.</p>

  <p>Hardly knowing what he did, he felt about in his swaying prison for the
  stud of the exterior electric light, and came by accident against his own
  small glow-lamp in its padded recess. The sphere twisted, and then threw him
  down; he heard shouts like shouts of surprise, and when he rose to his feet,
  he saw two pairs of stalked eyes peering into the lower window and reflecting
  his light.</p>

  <p>In another moment hands were dabbing vigorously at his steel casing, and
  there was a sound, horrible enough in his position, of the metal protection
  of the clockwork being vigorously hammered. That indeed sent his heart into
  his mouth, for if these strange creatures succeeded in stopping that, his
  release would never occur. Scarcely had he thought as much when he felt the
  sphere sway violently, and the floor of it press hard against his feet. He
  turned off the small glow-lamp that lit the interior, and sent the ray of the
  large light in the separate compartment, out into the water. The sea-floor
  and the man-like creatures had disappeared, and a couple of fish chasing each
  other dropped suddenly by the window.</p>

  <p>He thought at once that these strange denizens of the deep sea had broke
  the rope, and that he had escaped. He drove up faster and faster, and then
  stopped with a jerk that sent him flying against the padded roof of his
  prison. For half a minute perhaps, he was too astonished to think.</p>

  <p>Then he felt that the sphere was spinning slowly, and rocking, and it
  seemed to him that it was also being drawn through the water. By crouching
  close to the window, he managed to make his weight effective and roll that
  part of the sphere downward, but he could see nothing save the pale ray of
  his light striking down ineffectively into the darkness. It occurred to him
  that he would see more if he turned the lamp off, and allowed his eyes to
  grow accustomed to the profound obscurity.</p>

  <p>In this he was wise. After some minutes the velvety blackness became a
  translucent blackness, and then, far away, and as faint as zodiacal light of
  an English summer evening, he saw shapes moving below. He judged these
  creatures had detached his cable, and were towing him along the sea
  bottom.</p>

  <p>And then he saw something faint and remote across the undulations of the
  submarine plain, a broad horizon of pale luminosity that extended this way
  and that way as far as the range of his little window permitted him to see.
  To this he was being towed, as a balloon might be towed by men out of the
  open country into a town. He approached it very slowly, and very slowly the
  dim irradiation was gathered together into more definite shapes.</p>

  <p>It was nearly five o'clock before he came over this luminous area, and by
  that time he could make out an arrangement suggestive of streets and houses
  grouped about a vast roofless erection that was grotesquely suggestive of a
  ruined abbey. It was spread out like a map below him. The houses were all
  roofless enclosures of walls, and their substance being, as he afterwards
  saw, of phosphorescent bones, gave the place an appearance as if it were
  built of drowned moonshine.</p>

  <p>Among the inner caves of the place waving trees of crinoid stretched their
  tentacles, and tall, slender, glassy sponges shot like shining minarets and
  lilies of filmy light out of the general glow of the city. In the open spaces
  of the place he could see a stirring movement as of crowds of people, but he
  was too many fathoms above them to distinguish the individuals in those
  crowds.</p>

  <p>Then slowly they pulled him down, and as they did so, the details of the
  place crept slowly upon his apprehension. He saw that the courses of the
  cloudy buildings were marked out with beaded lines of round objects, and then
  he perceived that at several points below him, in broad open spaces, were
  forms like the encrusted shapes of ships.</p>

  <p>Slowly and surely he was drawn down, and the forms below him became
  brighter, clearer, more distinct. He was being pulled down, he perceived,
  towards the large building in the centre of the town, and he could catch a
  glimpse ever and again of the multitudinous forms that were lugging at his
  cord. He was astonished to see that the rigging of one of the ships, which
  formed such a prominent feature of the place, was crowded with a host of
  gesticulating figures regarding him, and then the walls of the great building
  rose about him silently, and hid the city from his eyes.</p>

  <p>And such walls they were, of water-logged wood, and twisted wire-rope, and
  iron spars, and copper, and the bones and skulls of dead men. The skulls ran
  in zigzag lines and spirals and fantastic curves over the building; and in
  and out of their eye-sockets, and over the whole surface of the place, lurked
  and played a multitude of silvery little fishes.</p>

  <p>Suddenly his ears were filled with a low shouting and a noise like the
  violent blowing of horns, and this gave place to a fantastic chant. Down the
  sphere sank, past the huge pointed windows, through which he saw vaguely a
  great number of these strange, ghostlike people regarding him, and at last he
  came to rest, as it seemed, on a kind of altar that stood in the centre of
  the place.</p>

  <p>And now he was at such a level that he could see these strange people of
  the abyss plainly once more. To his astonishment, he perceived that they were
  prostrating themselves before him, all save one, dressed as it seemed in a
  robe of placoid scales, and crowned with a luminous diadem, who stood with
  his reptilian mouth opening and shutting, as though he led the chanting of
  the worshippers.</p>

  <p>A curious impulse made Elstead turn on his small glow-lamp again, so that
  he became visible to these creatures of the abyss, albeit the glare made them
  disappear forthwith into night. At this sudden sight of him, the chanting
  gave place to a tumult of exultant shouts; and Elstead, being anxious to
  watch them, turned his light off again, and vanished from before their eyes.
  But for a time he was too blind to make out what they were doing, and when at
  last he could distinguish them, they were kneeling again. And thus they
  continued worshipping him, without rest or intermission, for a space of three
  hours.</p>

  <p>Most circumstantial was Elstead's account of this astounding city and its
  people, these people of perpetual night, who have never seen sun or moon or
  stars, green vegetation, nor any living, air-breathing creatures, who know
  nothing of fire, nor any light but the phosphorescent light of living
  things.</p>

  <p>Startling as is his story, it is yet more startling to find that
  scientific men, of such eminence as Adams and Jenkins, find nothing
  incredible in it. They tell me they see no reason why intelligent,
  water-breathing, vertebrated creatures, inured to a low temperature and
  enormous pressure, and of such a heavy structure, that neither alive nor dead
  would they float, might not live upon the bottom of the deep sea, and quite
  unsuspected by us, descendants like ourselves of the great Theriomorpha of
  the New Red Sandstone age.</p>

  <p>We should be known to them however, as strange, meteoric creatures, wont
  to fall catastrophically dead out of the mysterious blackness of their watery
  sky. And not only we ourselves, but our ships, our metals, our appliances,
  would come raining down out of the night. Sometimes sinking things would
  smite down and crush them, as if it were the judgment of some unseen power
  above, and sometimes would come things of utmost rarity or utility, or shapes
  of inspiring suggestion. One can understand, perhaps, something of their
  behaviour at the descent of a living man, if one thinks what a barbaric
  people might do, to whom an enhaloed, shining creature came suddenly out of
  the sky.</p>

  <p>At one time or another Elstead probably told the officers of the
  'Ptarmigan' every detail of his strange twelve hours in the abyss. That he
  also intended to write them down is certain, but he never did, and so
  unhappily we have to piece together the discrepant fragments of his story
  from the reminiscences of Commander Simmons, Weybridge, Steevens, Lindley,
  and the others.</p>

  <p>We see the thing darkly in fragmentary glimpses&mdash;the huge ghostly
  building, the bowing, chanting people, with their dark chameleon-like heads
  and faintly luminous clothing, and Elstead, with his light turned on again,
  vainly trying to convey to their minds that the cord by which the sphere was
  held was to be severed. Minute after minute slipped away, and Elstead,
  looking at his watch, was horrified to find that he had oxygen only for four
  hours more. But the chant in his honour kept on as remorselessly as if it was
  the marching song of his approaching death.</p>

  <p>The manner of his release he does not understand, but to judge by the end
  of cord that hung from the sphere, it had been cut through by rubbing against
  the edge of the altar. Abruptly the sphere rolled over, and he swept up, out
  of their world, as an ethereal creature clothed in a vacuum would sweep
  through our own atmosphere back to its native ether again. He must have torn
  out of their sight as a hydrogen bubble hastens upwards from our air. A
  strange ascension it must have seemed to them.</p>

  <p>The sphere rushed up with even greater velocity than, when weighted with
  the lead sinkers, it had rushed down. It became exceedingly hot. It drove up
  with the windows uppermost, and he remembers the torrent of bubbles frothing
  against the glass. Every moment he expected this to fly. Then suddenly
  something like a huge wheel seemed to be released in his head, the padded
  compartment began spinning about him, and he fainted. His next recollection
  was of his cabin, and of the doctor's voice.</p>

  <p>But that is the substance of the extraordinary story that Elstead related
  in fragments to the officers of the 'Ptarmigan'. He promised to write it all
  down at a later date. His mind was chiefly occupied with the improvement of
  his apparatus, which was effected at Rio.</p>

  <p>It remains only to tell that on February 2, 1896, he made his second
  descent into the ocean abyss, with the improvements his first experience
  suggested. What happened we shall probably never knew. He never returned. The
  'Ptarmigan' beat about over the point of his submersion, seeking him in vain
  for thirteen days. Then she returned to Rio, and the news was telegraphed to
  his friends. So the matter remains for the present. But it is hardly probable
  that no further attempt will be made to verify his strange story of these
  hitherto unsuspected cities of the deep sea.</p>

     name="story33">THE LOST INHERITANCE</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Pocket Magazine</i>, September 1896</h3>

  <p>"My uncle," said the man with the glass eye, "was what you might call a
  hemi-semi-demi millionaire. He was worth about a hundred and twenty thousand.
  Quite. And he left me all his money."</p>

  <p>I glanced at the shiny sleeve of his coat, and my eye travelled up to the
  frayed collar.</p>

  <p>"Every penny," said the man with the glass eye, and I caught the active
  pupil looking at me with a touch of offence.</p>

  <p>"I've never had any windfalls like that," I said, trying to speak
  enviously and propitiate him.</p>

  <p>"Even a legacy isn't always a blessing," he remarked with a sigh, and with
  an air of philosophical resignation he put the red nose and the wiry
  moustache into his tankard for a space.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," I said.</p>

  <p>"He was an author, you see, and he wrote a lot of books."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!"</p>

  <p>"That was the trouble of it all." He stared at me with the available eye
  to see if I grasped his statement, then averted his face a little and
  produced a toothpick.</p>

  <p>"You see," he said, smacking his lips after a pause, "it was like this. He
  was my uncle&mdash;my maternal uncle. And he had&mdash;what shall I call
  it&mdash;? A weakness for writing, edifying literature. Weakness is hardly
  the word&mdash;downright mania is nearer the mark. He's been librarian in a
  Polytechnic, and as soon as the money came to him he began to indulge his
  ambition. It's a simply extraordinary and incomprehensible thing to me. Here
  was a man of thirty-seven suddenly dropped into a perfect pile of gold, and
  he didn't go&mdash;not a day's bust on it. One would think a chap would go
  and get himself dressed a bit decent&mdash;say a couple of dozen pair of
  trousers at a West End tailor's; but he never did. You'd hardly believe it,
  but when he died he hadn't even a gold watch. It seems wrong for people like
  that to have money. All he did was just to take a house, and order in pretty
  nearly five tons of books and ink and paper, and set to writing, edifying
  literature as hard as ever he could write. I can't understand it! But he did.
  The money came to him, curiously enough, through a maternal uncle of his,
  unexpected like, when he was seven-and-thirty. My mother, it happened, was
  his only relation in the wide, wide world, except some second cousins of his.
  And I was her only son. You follow all that? The second cousins had one only
  son too, but they brought him to see the old man too soon. He was rather a
  spoilt youngster, was this son of theirs, and directly he set eyes on my
  uncle, he began bawling out as hard as he could. 'Take 'im away&mdash;er,' he
  says, 'take 'im away,' and so did for himself entirely. It was pretty
  straight sailing, you'd think, for me, eh? And my mother, being a sensible,
  careful woman, settled the business in her own mind long before he did."</p>

  <p>"He was a curious little chap, was my uncle, as I remember him. I don't
  wonder at the kid being scared. Hair just like these Japanese dolls they
  sell, black and straight and stiff all round the brim and none in the middle,
  and below, a whitish kind of face and rather large dark grey eyes moving
  about behind his spectacles. He used to attach a great deal of importance to
  dress, and always wore a flapping overcoat and a big-brimmed felt hat of a
  most extraordinary size. He looked a rummy little beggar, I can tell you.
  Indoors it was, as a rule, a dirty red flannel dressing-gown and a black
  skull-cap he had. That black skull-cap made him look like the portraits of
  all kinds of celebrated people. He was always moving about from house to
  house, was my uncle, with his chair which had belonged to Savage Landor, and
  his two writing-tables, one of Carlyle's and the other of Shelley's, so the
  dealer told him, and the completest portable reference library in England, he
  said he had&mdash;and he lugged the whole caravan, now to a house at Down,
  near Darwin's old place, then to Reigate, near Meredith, then off to
  Haslemere, then back to Chelsea for a bit, and then up to Hampstead. He knew
  there was something wrong with his stuff, but he never knew there was
  anything wrong with his brains. It was always the air, or the water, or the
  altitude, or some tommy-rot like that. 'So much depends on environment,' he
  used to say, and stare at you hard, as if he half suspected you were hiding a
  grin at him somewhere under your face. 'So much depends on environment to a
  sensitive mind like mine.'"</p>

  <p>"What was his name? You wouldn't know it if I told you. He wrote nothing
  that anyone has ever read&mdash;nothing. No one could read it. He wanted to
  be a great teacher, he said, and he didn't know what he wanted to teach any
  more than a child. So he just blethered at large about Truth and
  Righteousness, and the Spirit of History, and all that. Book after book he
  wrote and published at his own expense. He wasn't quite right in his head,
  you know really; and to hear him go on at the critics&mdash;not because they
  slated him, mind you&mdash;he liked that&mdash;but because they didn't take
  any notice of him at all. 'What do the nations want?' he would ask, holding
  out his brown old claw. 'Why, teaching&mdash;guidance! They are scattered
  upon the hills like sheep without a shepherd. There is War and Rumours of
  War, the unlaid Spirit of Discord abroad in the land, Nihilism, Vivisection,
  Vaccination, Drunkenness, Penury, Want, Socialistic Error, Selfish Capital!
  Do you see the clouds, Ted&mdash;?' My name, you know&mdash;'Do you see the
  clouds lowering over the land? and behind it all&mdash;the Mongol waits!' He
  was always very great on Mongols, and the Spectre of Socialism, and suchlike
  things."</p>

  <p>"Then out would come his finger at me, and with his eyes all afire and his
  skull-cap askew, he would whisper: 'And here am I. What did I want? Nations
  to teach. Nations! I say it with all modesty, Ted, I could. I would guide
  them; nay! But I will guide them to a safe haven, to the land of
  Righteousness, flowing with milk and honey.'"</p>

  <p>"That's how he used to go on. Ramble, rave about the nations, and
  righteousness, and that kind of thing. Kind of mincemeat of Bible and
  blethers. From fourteen up to three-and-twenty, when I might have been
  improving my mind, my mother used to wash me and brush my hair (at least in
  the earlier years of it), with a nice parting down the middle, and take me,
  once or twice a week, to hear this old lunatic jabber about things he had
  read of in the morning papers, trying to do it as much like Carlyle as he
  could, and I used to sit according to instructions, and look intelligent and
  nice, and pretend to be taking it all in. Afterwards I used to go of my own
  free will, out of a regard for the legacy. I was the only person that used to
  go see him. He wrote, I believe, to every man who made the slightest stir in
  the world, sending him a copy or so of his books, and inviting him to come
  and talk about the nations to him; but half of them didn't answer, and none
  ever came. And when the girl let you in&mdash;she was an artful bit of goods,
  that girl&mdash;there were heaps of letters on the hall-seat waiting to go
  off, addressed to Prince Bismarck, the President of the United States, and
  such-like people. And one went up the staircase and along the cobwebby
  passage&mdash;, the housekeeper drank like fury, and his passages were always
  cobwebby&mdash;, and found him at last, with books turned down all over the
  room, and heaps of torn paper on the floor, and telegrams and newspapers
  littered about, and empty coffee-cups and half-eaten bits of toast on the
  desk and the mantel. You'd see his back humped up, and his hair would be
  sticking out quite straight between the collar of that dressing-gown thing
  and the edge of his skull-cap."</p>

  <p>"'A moment!' he would say. 'A moment!' over his shoulder. 'The mot juste,
  you know, Ted, le mot juste. Righteous thought righteously
  expressed&mdash;Aah&mdash;! Concatenation. And now, Ted,' he'd say, spinning
  round in his study chair, 'how's Young England?' That was his silly name for
  me."</p>

  <p>"Well, that was my uncle, and that was how he talked&mdash;to me, at any
  rate. With others about he seemed a bit shy. And he not only talked to me,
  but he gave me his books, books of six hundred pages or so, with cock-eyed
  headings, 'The Shrieking Sisterhood,' 'The Behemoth of Bigotry,' 'Crucibles
  and Cullenders,' and so on. All very strong, and none of them original. The
  very last time, but one that I saw him, he gave me a book. He was feeling ill
  even then, and his hand shook and he was despondent. I noticed it because I
  was naturally on the look-out for those little symptoms. 'My last book, Ted,'
  he said. 'My last book, my boy; my last word to the deaf and hardened
  nations;' and I'm hanged if a tear didn't go rolling down his yellow old
  cheek. He was regular crying because it was so nearly over, and he hadn't
  only written about fifty-three books of rubbish. 'I've sometimes thought,
  Ted&mdash;' he said, and stopped."</p>

  <p>"'Perhaps I've been a bit hasty and angry with this stiff-necked
  generation. A little more sweetness, perhaps, and a little less blinding
  light. I've sometimes thought&mdash;I might have swayed them. But I've done
  my best, Ted.'"</p>

  <p>"And then, with a burst, for the first and last time in his life he owned
  himself a failure. It showed he was really ill. He seemed to think for a
  minute, and then he spoke quietly and low, as sane and sober as I am now.
  'I've been a fool, Ted,' he said. 'I've been flapping nonsense all my life.
  Only He who readeth the heart knows whether this is anything more than
  vanity. Ted, I don't. But He knows, He knows, and if I have done foolishly
  and vainly, in my heart&mdash;in my heart&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"Just like that he spoke, repeating himself, and he stopped quite short
  and handed the book to me, trembling. Then the old shine came back into his
  eye. I remember it all fairly well, because I repeated it and acted it to my
  old mother when I got home, to cheer her up a bit. 'Take this book and read
  it,' he said. 'It's my last word, my very last word. I've left all my
  property to you, Ted, and may you use it better than I have done.' And then
  he fell a-coughing."</p>

  <p>"I remember that quite well even now, and how I went home cock-a-hoop, and
  how he was in bed the next time I called. The housekeeper was downstairs
  drunk, and I fooled about&mdash;as a young man will&mdash;with the girl in
  the passage before I went to him. He was sinking fast. But even then his
  vanity clung to him.</p>

  <p>"'Have you read it?' he whispered."</p>

  <p>"'Sat, up all night reading it,' I said in his ear to cheer him. 'It's the
  last,' said I, and then, with a memory of some poetry or other in my head,
  'but it's the bravest and best.'"</p>

  <p>"He smiled a little and tried to squeeze my hand as a woman might do, and
  left off squeezing in the middle, and lay still. 'The bravest and the best,'
  said I again, seeing it pleased him. But he didn't answer. I heard the girl
  giggle outside the door, for occasionally we'd had just a bit of innocent
  laughter, you know, at his ways. I looked at his face, and his eyes were
  closed, and it was just as if somebody had punched in his nose on either
  side. But he was still smiling. It's queer to think of&mdash;he lay dead, lay
  dead there, an utter failure, with the smile of success on his face.</p>

  <p>"That was the end of my uncle. You can imagine me and my mother saw that
  he had a decent funeral. Then, of course, came the hunt for the will. We
  began decent and respectful at first, and before the day was out we were
  ripping chairs, and smashing bureau panels, and sounding walls. Every hour we
  expected those others to come in. We asked the housekeeper, and found she'd
  actually witnessed a will&mdash;on an ordinary half-sheet of notepaper it was
  written, and very short, she said&mdash;not a month ago. The other witness
  was the gardener, and he bore her out word for word. But I'm hanged if there
  was that or any other will to be found. The way my mother talked must have
  made him turn in his grave. At last a lawyer at Reigate sprang one on us that
  had been made years ago during some temporary quarrel with my mother. I'm
  blest if that wasn't the only will to be discovered anywhere, and it left
  every penny he possessed to that 'Take 'im away' youngster of his second
  cousin's&mdash;a chap who'd never had to stand his talking, not for one
  afternoon of his life."</p>

  <p>The man with the glass eye stopped.</p>

  <p>"I thought you said&mdash;" I began.</p>

  <p>"Half a minute," said the man with the glass eye. "I had to wait for the
  end of the story till this very morning, and I was a blessed sight more
  interested than you are. You just wait a bit too. They executed the will, and
  the other chap inherited, and directly he was one-and-twenty he began to blew
  it. How he did blew it, to be sure! He bet, he drank, he got in the papers
  for this and that. I tell you, it makes me wiggle to think of the times he
  had. He blewed every ha'penny of it before he was thirty, and the last I
  heard of him was&mdash;Holloway! Three years ago."</p>

  <p>"Well, I naturally fell on hard times, because as you see, the only trade
  I knew was legacy-cadging. All my plans were waiting over to begin, so to
  speak, when the old chap died. I've had my ups and downs since then. Just now
  it's a period of depression. I tell you frankly, I'm on the look-out for
  help. I was hunting round my room to find something to raise a bit on for
  immediate necessities, and the sight of all those presentation
  volumes&mdash;no one will buy them, not to wrap butter in, even&mdash;well,
  they annoyed me. I promised him not to part with them, and I never kept a
  promise easier. I let out at them with my boot, and sent them shooting across
  the room. One lifted at the kick, and spun through the air. And out of it
  flapped&mdash;You guess?</p>

  <p>"It was the will. He'd given it to me himself in that very last volume of
  all."</p>

  <p>He folded his arms on the table, and looked sadly with the active eye at
  his empty tankard. He shook his head slowly, and said softly, "I'd never
  opened the book, much more cut a page!" Then he looked up, with a bitter
  laugh, for sympathy. "Fancy hiding it there! Eigh? Of all places."</p>

  <p>He began to fish absently for a dead fly with a finger. "It just shows you
  the vanity of authors," he said, looking up at me. "It wasn't no trick of
  his. He'd meant perfectly fair. He'd really thought I was really going home
  to read that blessed book of his through. But it shows you, don't it&mdash;?"
  his eye went down to the tankard again&mdash;, "It shows you too, how we poor
  human beings fail to understand one another."</p>

  <p>But there was no misunderstanding the eloquent thirst of his eye. He
  accepted with ill-feigned surprise. He said, in the usual subtle formula,
  that he didn't mind if he did.</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Idler</i>, October 1896</h3>

  <p>"I must get rid of it," said the man in the corner of the carriage,
  abruptly breaking the silence.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hinchcliff looked up, hearing imperfectly. He had been lost in the
  rapt contemplation of the college cap tied by a string to his portmanteau
  handles&mdash;the outward and visible sign of his newly-gained pedagogic
  position&mdash;in the rapt appreciation of the college cap and the pleasant
  anticipations it excited. For Mr. Hinchcliff had just matriculated at London
  University, and was going to be junior assistant at the Holmwood Grammar
  School&mdash;a very enviable position. He stared across the carriage at his
  fellow-traveller.</p>

  <p>"Why not give it away?" said this person. "Give it away! Why not?"</p>

  <p>He was a tall, dark sunburnt man with a pale face. His arms were folded
  tightly, and his feet were on the seat in front of him. He was pulling at a
  lank black moustache. He stared hard at his toes.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hinchcliff coughed.</p>

  <p>The stranger lifted his eyes&mdash;they were curious, dark-grey eyes
  &mdash;and stared blankly at Mr. Hinchcliff for the best part of a minute,
  perhaps. His expression grew to interest.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said slowly. "Why not? And end it."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow you, I'm afraid," said Mr. Hinchcliff, with another
  cough.</p>

  <p>"You don't quite follow me?" said the stranger quite mechanically, his
  singular eyes wandering from Mr. Hinchcliff to the bag with its
  ostentatiously displayed cap, and back to Mr. Hinchcliff's downy face.</p>

  <p>"You're so abrupt, you know," apologised Mr. Hinchcliff.</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I?" said the stranger, following his thoughts. "You are a
  student?" he said, addressing Mr. Hinchcliff.</p>

  <p>"I am&mdash;by Correspondence&mdash;of the London University," said Mr.
  Hinchcliff, with irrepressible pride, and feeling nervously at his tie.</p>

  <p>"In pursuit of knowledge," said the stranger, and suddenly took his feet
  off the seat, put his fist on his knees, and stared at Mr. Hinchcliff as
  though he had never seen a student before. "Yes," he said, and flung out an
  index finger. Then he rose, took a bag from the hat-rack, and unlocked it.
  Quite silently he drew out something round and wrapped in a quantity of
  silver-paper, and unfolded this carefully. He held it out towards Mr.
  Hinchcliff&mdash;a small, very smooth, golden-yellow fruit.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hinchcliff's eyes and mouth were open. He did not offer to take this
  object&mdash;if he was intended to take it.</p>

  <p>"That," said this fantastic stranger, speaking very slowly, "is the Apple
  of the Tree of Knowledge. Look at it&mdash;small, and bright, and wonderful
  &mdash;Knowledge&mdash;and I am going to give it to you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hinchcliff's mind worked painfully for a minute, and then the
  sufficient explanation, "Mad!" flashed across his brain, and illuminated the
  whole situation. One humoured madmen. He put his head a little on one
  side.</p>

  <p>"The Apple of the Tree of Knowledge, eigh!" said Mr. Hinchcliff, regarding
  it with a finely assumed air of interest, and then looking at the
  interlocutor. "But don't you want to eat it yourself? And besides&mdash;how
  did you come by it?"</p>

  <p>"It never fades. I have had it now for three months. And it is ever bright
  and smooth and ripe and desirable, as you see it." He laid his hand on his
  knee and regarded the fruit musingly. Then he began to wrap it again in the
  papers, as though he had abandoned his intention of giving it away.</p>

  <p>"But how did you come by it?" said Mr. Hinchcliff, who had his
  argumentative side. "And how do you know that it is the Fruit of the
  Tree?"</p>

  <p>"I bought this fruit," said the stranger, "three months ago&mdash;for a
  drink of water and a crust of bread. The man who gave it to me&mdash;because
  I kept the life in him&mdash;was an Armenian. Armenia! That wonderful
  country, the first of all countries, where the ark of the Flood remains to
  this day, buried in the glaciers of Mount Ararat. This man I say, fleeing
  with others from Kurds who had come upon them, went up into desolate places
  among the mountains&mdash;places beyond the common knowledge of men. And
  fleeing from imminent pursuit, they came to a slope, high among the
  mountain-peaks, green with a grass like knife-blades, that cut and slashed
  most pitilessly at anyone who went into it. The Kurds were close behind, and
  there was nothing for it but to plunge in, and the worst of it was that the
  paths they made through it, at the price of their blood, served for the Kurds
  to follow. Every one of the fugitives was killed save this Armenian and
  another. He heard the screams and cries of his friends, and the swish of the
  grass about those who were pursuing them&mdash;it was tall grass rising
  overhead. And then a shouting and answers, and when presently he paused,
  everything was still. He pushed out again, not understanding, cut and
  bleeding, until he came out on a steep slope of rocks below a precipice, and
  then he saw the grass was all on fire, and the smoke of it rose like a veil
  between him and his enemies."</p>

  <p>The stranger paused. "Yes?" said Mr. Hinchcliff. "Yes?"</p>

  <p>"There he was, all torn and bloody from the knife-blades of the grass, the
  rocks blazing under the afternoon sun&mdash;the sky molten brass&mdash;and
  the smoke of the fire driving towards him. He dared not stay there. Death he
  did not mind, but torture! Far away beyond the smoke he heard shouts and
  cries. Women screaming. So he went clambering up a gorge in the
  rocks&mdash;everywhere were bushes with dry branches that stuck like thorns
  among the leaves&mdash;until he clambered over the brow of a ridge that hid
  him. And then he met his companion, a shepherd, who had also escaped. And
  counting cold and famine and thirst as nothing against the Kurds, they went
  on into the heights, and among the snow and ice. They wandered three whole
  days.</p>

  <p>"The third day came the vision. I suppose hungry men often do see visions,
  but then there is this fruit." He lifted the wrapped globe in his hand. "And
  I have heard it too, from other mountaineers who have known something of the
  legend. It was in the evening time, when the stars were increasing, that they
  came down a slope of polished rock into a huge dark valley all set about with
  strange, contorted trees and in these hung little globes like glow-worm
  spheres, strange round yellow lights.</p>

  <p>"Suddenly this valley was lit far away, many miles away, far down it, with
  a golden flame marching slowly athwart it, that made the stunted trees
  against it black as night, and turned the slopes all about them and their
  figures to the likeness of fiery gold. And at the vision they, knowing the
  legends of mountains, instantly knew that it was Eden they saw, or the
  sentinel of Eden, and they fell upon their faces like men struck dead.</p>

  <p>"When they dared to look again the valley was dark for a space, and then
  the light came again&mdash;returning, a burning amber.</p>

  <p>"At that the shepherd sprang to his feet, and with a shout began to run
  down towards the light, but the other man was too fearful to follow him. He
  stood stunned, amazed, and terrified, watching his companion recede towards
  the marching glare. And hardly had the shepherd set out when there came a
  noise like thunder, the beating of invisible wings hurrying up the valley,
  and a great and terrible fear; and at that the man who gave me the fruit
  turned&mdash;if he might still escape. And hurrying headlong up the slope
  again, with that tumult sweeping after him, he stumbled against one of these
  stunted bushes, and a ripe fruit came off it into his hand. This fruit.
  Forthwith, the wings and thunder rolled all about him. He fell and fainted,
  and when he came to his senses, he was back among the blackened ruins of his
  own village, and I and the others were attending to the wounded. A vision?
  But the golden fruit of the tree was still clutched in his hand. There were
  others there who knew the legend, knew what that strange fruit might be." He
  paused. "And this is it," he said.</p>

  <p>It was a most extraordinary story to be told in a third-class carriage on
  a Sussex railway. It was as if the real was a mere veil to the fantastic, and
  here was the fantastic poking through. "Is it?" was all Mr. Hinchcliff could
  say.</p>

  <p>"The legend," said the stranger, "tells that those thickets of dwarfed
  trees growing about the garden sprang from the apple that Adam carried in his
  hand when he and Eve were driven forth. He felt something in his hand, saw
  the half-eaten apple, and flung it petulantly aside. And there they grow, in
  that desolate valley, girdled round with the everlasting snows, and there the
  fiery swords keep ward against the Judgment Day."</p>

  <p>"But I thought these things were&mdash;" Mr Hinchcliff
  paused&mdash;"fables&mdash;parables rather. Do you mean to tell me that there
  in Armenia&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The stranger answered the unfinished question with the fruit in his open
  hand.</p>

  <p>"But you don't know," said Mr. Hinchcliff, "that, that is the fruit of the
  Tree of Knowledge. The man may have had&mdash;a sort of mirage, say.
  Suppose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look at it," said the stranger.</p>

  <p>It was certainly a strange-looking globe, not really an apple, Mr.
  Hinchcliff saw and a curious glowing golden colour, almost as though light
  itself was wrought into its substance. As he looked at it, he began to see
  more vividly the desolate valley among the mountains, the guarding swords of
  fire, the strange antiquities of the story he had just heard. He rubbed a
  knuckle into his eye. "But&mdash;" said he.</p>

  <p>"It has kept like that, smooth and full, three months. Longer than that it
  is now by some days. No drying, withering, no decay."</p>

  <p>"And you yourself," said Mr. Hinchcliff, "really believe that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is the Forbidden Fruit."</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking the earnestness of the man's manner and his perfect
  sanity. "The Fruit of Knowledge," he said.</p>

  <p>"Suppose it was?" said Mr. Hinchcliff, after a pause, still staring at it.
  "But after all," said Mr. Hinchcliff, "it's not my kind of knowledge
  &mdash;not the sort of knowledge. I mean, Adam and Eve have eaten it
  already."</p>

  <p>"We inherit their sins&mdash;not their knowledge," said the stranger.
  "That would make it clear and bright again. We should see into everything,
  through everything, into the deepest meaning of everything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why don't you eat it then?" said Mr. Hinchcliff, with an inspiration.</p>

  <p>"I took in intending to eat it," said the stranger. "Man has fallen.
  Merely to eat again could scarcely&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Knowledge is power," said Mr. Hinchcliff.</p>

  <p>"But is it happiness? I am older than you&mdash;more than twice as old.
  Time after time I have held this in my hand, and my heart has failed me at
  the thought of all that one might know, that terrible lucidity&mdash;Suppose
  suddenly all the world became pitilessly clear?"</p>

  <p>"That, I think, would be a great advantage," said Mr. Hinchcliff, "on the
  whole."</p>

  <p>"Suppose you saw into the hearts and minds of everyone about you, into
  their most secret recesses&mdash;people you loved, whose love you
  valued?"</p>

  <p>"You'd soon find out the humbugs," said Mr. Hinchcliff, greatly struck by
  the idea.</p>

  <p>"And worse&mdash;to know yourself, bare of your most intimate illusions.
  To see yourself in your place. All that your lusts and weaknesses prevented
  your doing. No merciful perspective."</p>

  <p>"That might be an excellent thing too. 'Know thyself,' you know."</p>

  <p>"You are young," said the stranger.</p>

  <p>"If you don't care to eat it, and it bothers you, why don't you throw it
  away?"</p>

  <p>"There again, perhaps, you will not understand me. To me, how could one
  throw away a thing like that, glowing, wonderful? Once one has it, one is
  bound. But, on the other hand, to give it away! To give it away to someone
  who thirsted after knowledge, who found no terror in the thought of that
  clear perception&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Mr. Hinchcliff thoughtfully, "it might be sort of
  poisonous fruit."</p>

  <p>And then his eye caught something motionless, the end of a white board
  black-lettered outside the carriage window. "&mdash;mwood," he saw. He
  started convulsively. "Gracious!" said Mr. Hinchcliff. "Holmwood&mdash;!" And
  the practical present blotted out the mystic realisations that had been
  stealing upon him.</p>

  <p>In another moment he was opening the carriage-door, portmanteau in hand.
  The guard was already fluttering his green flag. Mr. Hinchcliff jumped out.
  "Here!" said a voice behind him, and he saw the dark eyes of the stranger
  shining and the golden fruit, bright and bare, held out of the open carriage-
  door. He took it instinctively, the train was already moving.</p>

  <p>"No!" shouted the stranger, and made a snatch at it as if to take it
  back.</p>

  <p>"Stand away," cried a country porter, thrusting forward to close the door.
  The stranger shouted something Mr. Hinchcliff did not catch, head and arm
  thrust excitedly out of the window, and then the shadow of the bridge fell on
  him, and in a trice he was hidden. Mr. Hinchcliff stood astonished, staring
  at the end of the last waggon receding round the bend, and with the wonderful
  fruit in his hand. For the fraction of a minute his mind was confused, and
  then he became aware that two or three people on the platform were regarding
  him with interest. Was he not the new Grammar School master making his debut?
  It occurred to him that, so far as they could tell, the fruit might very well
  be the naive refreshment of an orange. He flushed at the thought, and thrust
  the fruit into his side pocket, where it bulged undesirably. But there was no
  help for it, so he went towards them, awkwardly concealing his sense of
  awkwardness, to ask the way to the Grammar School, and the means of getting
  his portmanteau and the two tin boxes which lay up the platform thither. Of
  all the odd and fantastic yarns to tell a fellow!</p>

  <p>His luggage could be taken on a truck for sixpence, he found, and he could
  precede it on foot. He fancied an ironical note in the voices. He was
  painfully aware of his contour.</p>

  <p>The curious earnestness of the man in the train, and the glamour of the
  story he told, had for a time, diverted the current of Mr. Hinchcliff's
  thoughts. It drove like a mist before his immediate concerns. Fires that went
  to and fro! But the preoccupation of his new position, and the impression he
  was to produce upon Holmwood generally, and the school people in particular,
  returned upon him with reinvigorating power before he left the station and
  cleared his mental atmosphere. But it is extraordinary what an inconvenient
  thing the addition of a soft and rather brightly-golden fruit, not three
  inches in diameter, may prove to a sensitive youth on his best appearance. In
  the pocket of his black jacket it bulged dreadfully, spoilt the lines
  altogether. He passed a little old lady in black, and he felt her eye drop
  upon the excrescence at once. He was wearing one glove and carrying the
  other, together with his stick, so that to bear the fruit openly was
  impossible. In one place, were the road into the town seemed suitably
  secluded, he took his encumbrance out of his pocket and tried it in his hat.
  It was just too large, the hat wobbled ludicrously, and just as he was taking
  it out again, a butcher's boy came driving round the corner.</p>

  <p>"Confound it!" said Mr. Hinchcliff.</p>

  <p>He would have eaten the thing, and attained omniscience there and then,
  but it would seem so silly to go into town sucking a juicy fruit&mdash;and it
  certainly felt juicy. If one of the boys should come by, it might do him a
  serious injury with his discipline so to be seen. And the juice might make
  his face sticky and get upon his cuffs&mdash;or it might be an acid juice as
  potent as lemon, and take all the colour out of his clothes.</p>

  <p>Then round a bend in the lane came two pleasant sunlit girlish figures.
  They were walking slowly towards the town and chattering&mdash;at any moment
  they might look round and see a hot-faced young man behind them carrying a
  kind of phosphorescent yellow tomato! They would be sure to laugh.</p>

  <p>"Hang!" said Mr. Hinchcliff, and with a swift jerk sent the encumbrance
  flying over the stone wall of an orchard that there abutted on the road. As
  it vanished, he felt a faint twinge of loss that lasted scarcely a moment. He
  adjusted the stick and glove in his hand, and walked on, erect and self-
  conscious, to pass the girls.</p>

  <p>But in the darkness of the night Mr. Hinchcliff had a dream, and saw the
  valley, and the flaming swords, and the contorted trees, and knew that it
  really was the Apple of the Tree of Knowledge that he had thrown regardlessly
  away. And he awoke very unhappy.</p>

  <p>In the morning his regret had passed, but afterwards it returned and
  troubled him; never however when he was happy or busily occupied. At last,
  one moonlight night about eleven, when all Holmwood was quite, his regrets
  returned with redoubled force, and therewith an impulse to adventure. He
  slipped out of the house and over the playground wall, went through the
  silent town to Station Lane, and climbed into the orchard where he had thrown
  the fruit. But nothing was to be found of it there among the dewy grass and
  the faint intangible globes of dandelion down.</p>

     name="story35">THE PURPLE PILEUS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Black &amp; White</i> magazine, December 1896</h3>

  <p>Mr. Coombes was sick of life. He walked away from his unhappy home, and
  sick not only of his own existence but of everybody else's, turned aside down
  Gaswork Lane to avoid the town, and, crossing the wooden bridge that goes
  over the canal to Starling's Cottages, was presently alone in the damp pine
  woods and out of sight and sound of human habitation. He would stand it no
  longer. He repeated aloud with blasphemies unusual to him that he would stand
  it no longer.</p>

  <p>He was a pale-faced little man, with dark eyes and a fine and very black
  moustache. He had a very stiff, upright collar slightly frayed, that gave him
  an illusory double chin, and his overcoat (albeit shabby) was trimmed with
  astrachan. His gloves were a bright brown with black stripes over the
  knuckles, and split at the finger ends. His appearance, his wife had said
  once in the dear, dead days beyond recall&mdash;, before he married her, that
  is&mdash;, was military. But now she called him&mdash;It seems a dreadful
  thing to tell of between husband and wife, but she called him "a little
  grub." It wasn't the only thing she had called him, either.</p>

  <p>The row had arisen about that beastly Jennie again. Jennie was his wife's
  friend, and by no invitation of Mr. Coombes, she came in every blessed Sunday
  to dinner, and made a shindy all the afternoon. She was a big, noisy girl,
  with a taste for loud colours and a strident laugh; and this Sunday she had
  outdone all her previous intrusions by bringing in a fellow with her, a chap
  as showy as herself. And Mr. Coombes, in a starchy, clean collar and his
  Sunday frock-coat, had sat dumb and wrathful at his own table, while his wife
  and her guests talked foolishly and undesirably, and laughed aloud. Well, he
  stood that, and after dinner (which, "as usual," was late), what must Miss
  Jennie do but go to the piano and play banjo tunes, for all the world as if
  it were a week-day! Flesh and blood could not endure such goings on. They
  would hear next door, they would hear in the road, it was a public
  announcement of their disrepute. He had to speak.</p>

  <p>He had felt himself go pale, and a kind of rigour had affected his
  respiration as he delivered himself. He had been sitting on one of the chairs
  by the window&mdash;the new guest had taken possession of the armchair. He
  turned his head. "Sun Day!" he said over the collar, in the voice of one who
  warns. "Sun Day!" What people call a "nasty" tone, it was.</p>

  <p>Jennie had kept on playing, but his wife, who was looking through some
  music that was piled on the top of the piano, had stared at him. "What's
  wrong now?" she said; "Can't people enjoy themselves?"</p>

  <p>"I don't mind rational 'njoyment, at all," said little Coombes, "but I
  ain't a-going to have week-day tunes playing on a Sunday in this house."</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with my playing now?" said Jennie, stopping and twirling
  round on the music-stool with a monstrous rustle of flounces.</p>

  <p>Coombes saw it was going to be a row, and opened too vigorously, as is
  common with your timid, nervous men all the world over. "Steady on with that
  music-stool!" said he; "It ain't made for 'eavy-weights."</p>

  <p>"Never you mind about weights," said Jennie, incensed. "What was you
  saying behind my back about my playing?"</p>

  <p>"Surely you don't 'old with not having a bit of music on a Sunday, Mr.
  Coombes?" said the new guest, leaning back in the armchair, blowing a cloud
  of cigarette smoke and smiling in a kind of pitying way. And simultaneously
  his wife said something to Jennie about "Never mind 'im. You go on,
  Jinny."</p>

  <p>"I do," said Mr. Coombes, addressing the new guest.</p>

  <p>"May I arst why?" said the new guest, evidently enjoying both his
  cigarette and the prospect of an argument. He was, by the bye, a lank young
  man, very stylishly dressed in bright drab, with a white cravat and a pearl
  and silver pin. It had been better taste to come in a black coat, Mr. Coombes
  thought.</p>

  <p>"Because," began Mr. Coombes, "it don't suit me. I'm a business man. I
  'ave to study my connection. Rational 'njoyment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"His connection!" said Mrs. Coombes scornfully. "That's what he's always
  a-saying. We got to do this, and we got to do that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you don't mean to study my connection," said Mr. Coombes, "what did
  you marry me for?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Jennie, and turned back to the piano.</p>

  <p>"I never saw such a man as you," said Mrs. Coombes.</p>

  <p>"You've altered all round since we were married. Before&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then Jennie began at the tum, tum, tum again.</p>

  <p>"Look here!" said Mr. Coombes, driven at last to revolt, standing up and
  raising his voice. "I tell you I won't have that." The frock-coat heaved with
  his indignation.</p>

  <p>"No vi'lence, now," said the long young man in drab, sitting up.</p>

  <p>"Who the juice are you?" said Mr. Coombes fiercely.</p>

  <p>Whereupon they all began talking at once. The new guest said he was
  Jennie's "intended," and meant to protect her, and Mr. Coombes said he was
  welcome to do so anywhere but in his (Mr. Coombes') house; and Mrs. Coombes
  said he ought to be ashamed of insulting his guests, and (as I have already
  mentioned) that he was getting a regular little grub; and the end was, that
  Mr. Coombes ordered his visitors out of the house, and they wouldn't go, and
  so he said he would go himself. With his face burning and tears of excitement
  in his eyes, he went into the passage, and as he struggled with his
  overcoat&mdash;his frock-coat sleeves got concertinaed up his arm&mdash;and
  gave a brush at his silk hat, Jennie began again at the piano, and strummed
  him insultingly out of the house. Tum, tum, tum. He slammed the shop door so
  that the house quivered. That briefly, was the immediate making of his mood.
  You will perhaps begin to understand his disgust with existence.</p>

  <p>As he walked along the muddy path under the firs&mdash;, it was late
  October, and the ditches and heaps of fir needles were gorgeous with clumps
  of fungi&mdash;, he recapitulated the melancholy history of his marriage. It
  was brief and commonplace enough. He now perceived with sufficient clearness
  that his wife had married him out of a natural curiosity and in order to
  escape from her worrying, laborious, and uncertain life in the workroom; and,
  like the majority of her class, she was far too stupid to realise that it was
  her duty to co-operate with him in his business. She was greedy of enjoyment,
  loquacious, and socially-minded, and evidently disappointed to find the
  restraints of poverty still hanging about her. His worries exasperated her,
  and the slightest attempt to control her proceedings resulted in a charge of
  "grumbling." Why couldn't he be nice&mdash;as he used to be? And Coombes was
  such a harmless little man too, nourished mentally on Self-Help, and with a
  meagre ambition of self-denial and competition, that was to end in a
  "sufficiency." Then Jennie came in as a female Mephistopheles, a gabbling
  chronicle of "fellers," and was always wanting his wife to go to theatres,
  and "all that." And in addition were aunts of his wife, and cousins (male and
  female) to eat up capital, insult him personally, upset business
  arrangements, annoy good customers, and generally blight his life. It was not
  the first occasion by many that Mr. Coombes had fled his home in wrath and
  indignation, and something like fear, vowing furiously and even aloud that he
  wouldn't stand it, and so frothing away his energy along the line of least
  resistance. But never before had he been quite so sick of life as on this
  particular Sunday afternoon. The Sunday dinner may have had its share in his
  despair&mdash;and the greyness of the sky. Perhaps too, he was beginning to
  realise his unendurable frustration as a business man as the consequence of
  his marriage. Presently bankruptcy, and after that&mdash;Perhaps she might
  have reason to repent when it was too late. And destiny, as I have already
  intimated, had planted the path through the wood with evil-smelling fungi,
  thickly and variously planted it, not only on the right side, but on the
  left.</p>

  <p>A small shopman is in such a melancholy position, if his wife turns out a
  disloyal partner. His capital is all tied up in his business, and to leave
  her means to join the unemployed in some strange part of the earth. The
  luxuries of divorce are beyond him altogether. So that the good old tradition
  of marriage for better or worse holds inexorably for him, and things work up
  to tragic culminations. Bricklayers kick their wives to death, and dukes
  betray theirs; but it is among the small clerks and shopkeepers nowadays that
  it comes most often to a cutting of throats. Under the circumstances it is
  not so very remarkable&mdash;and you must take it as charitably as you
  can&mdash;that the mind of Mr. Coombes ran for a while on some such glorious
  close to his disappointed hopes, and that he thought of razors, pistols,
  bread-knives, and touching letters to the coroner denouncing his enemies by
  name, and praying piously for forgiveness. After a time his fierceness gave
  way to melancholia. He had been married in this very overcoat, in his first
  and only frock-coat that was buttoned up beneath it. He began to recall their
  courting along this very walk, his years of penurious saving to get capital,
  and the bright hopefulness of his marrying days. For it all to work out like
  this! Was there no sympathetic ruler anywhere in the world? He reverted to
  death as a topic.</p>

  <p>He thought of the canal he had just crossed, and doubted whether he
  shouldn't stand with his head out, even in the middle, and it was while
  drowning, was in his mind that the purple pileus caught his eye. He looked at
  it mechanically for a moment, and stopped and stooped towards it to pick it
  up, under the impression that it was some such small leather object as a
  purse. Then he saw that it was the purple top of a fungus, a peculiarly
  poisonous-looking purple: slimy, shiny, and emitting a sour odour. He
  hesitated with his hand an inch or so from it, and the thought of poison
  crossed his mind. With that he picked the thing, and stood up again with it
  in his hand.</p>

  <p>The odour was certainly strong&mdash;acrid, but by no means disgusting. He
  broke off a piece, and the fresh surface was a creamy white, that changed
  like magic in the space of ten seconds to a yellowish-green colour. It was
  even an inviting-looking change. He broke off two other pieces to see it
  repeated. They were wonderful things these fungi, thought Mr. Coombes, and
  all of them the deadliest poisons, as his father had often told him. Deadly
  poisons!</p>

  <p>There is no time like the present for a rash resolve. Why not here and
  now? Thought Mr. Coombes. He tasted a little piece, a very little piece
  indeed&mdash;a mere crumb. It was so pungent that he almost spat it out
  again, then merely hot and full-flavoured. A kind of German mustard with a
  touch of horse-radish and&mdash;well, mushroom. He swallowed it in the
  excitement of the moment. Did he like it or did he not? His mind was
  curiously careless. He would try another bit. It really wasn't bad&mdash;it
  was good. He forgot his troubles in the interest of the immediate moment.
  Playing with death it was. He took another bite, and then deliberately
  finished a mouthful. A curious, tingling sensation began in his finger-tips
  and toes. His pulse began to move faster. The blood in his ears sounded like
  a mill-race. "Try bi' more," said Mr. Coombes. He turned and looked about
  him, and found his feet unsteady. He saw, and struggled towards, a little
  patch of purple a dozen yards away. "Jol' goo' stuff," said Mr. Coombes.
  "E&mdash;lomore ye'." He pitched forward and fell on his face, his hands
  outstretched towards the cluster of pilei. But he did not eat any more of
  them. He forgot forthwith.</p>

  <p>He rolled over and sat up with a look of astonishment on his face. His
  carefully brushed silk hat had rolled away towards the ditch. He pressed his
  hand to his brow. Something had happened, but he could not rightly determine
  what it was. Anyhow, he was no longer dull&mdash;he felt bright, cheerful.
  And his throat was afire. He laughed in the sudden gaiety of his heart. Had
  he been dull? He did not know; but at any rate he would be dull no longer. He
  got up and stood unsteadily, regarding the universe with an agreeable smile.
  He began to remember. He could not remember very well, because of a steam
  roundabout that was beginning in his head. And he knew he had been
  disagreeable at home, just because they wanted to be happy. They were quite
  right; life should be as gay as possible. He would go home and make it up,
  and reassure them. And why not take some of this delightful toadstool with
  him, for them to eat? A hatful, no less. Some of those red ones with white
  spots as well, and a few yellow. He had been a dull dog, an enemy to
  merriment; he would make up for it. It would be gay to turn his coat-sleeves
  inside out, and stick some yellow gorse into his waistcoat pockets. Then
  home&mdash;singing&mdash;for a jolly evening.</p>

  <p>After the departure of Mr. Coombes, Jennie discontinued playing, and
  turned round on the music-stool again. "What a fuss about nothing!" said
  Jennie.</p>

  <p>"You see, Mr. Clarence, what I've got to put up with," said Mrs.
  Coombes.</p>

  <p>"He is a bit hasty," said Mr. Clarence judicially.</p>

  <p>"He ain't got the slightest sense of our position," said Mrs. Coombes;
  "that's what I complain of. He cares for nothing but his old shop; and if I
  have a bit of company, or buy anything to keep myself decent, or get any
  little thing I want out of the housekeeping money, there's disagreeables.
  'Economy' he says; 'struggle for life,' and all that. He lies awake of nights
  about it, worrying how he can screw me out of a shilling. He wanted us to eat
  Dorset butter once. If once I was to give in to him&mdash;there!"</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Jennie.</p>

  <p>"If a man values a woman," said Mr. Clarence, lounging back in the
  armchair, "he must be prepared to make sacrifices for her. For my own part,"
  said Mr. Clarence, with his eye on Jennie, "I shouldn't think of marrying
  till I was in a position to do the thing in style. It's downright
  selfishness. A man ought to go through the rough-and-tumble by himself, and
  not drag her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't agree altogether with that," said Jennie. "I don't see why a man
  shouldn't have a woman's help, provided he doesn't treat her meanly, you
  know. It's meanness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't believe," said Mrs. Coombes. "But I was a fool to 'ave 'im.
  I might 'ave known. If it 'adn't been for my father, we shouldn't 'ave 'ad
  not a carriage to our wedding."</p>

  <p>"Lord! He didn't stick out at that?" said Mr. Clarence, quite shocked.</p>

  <p>"Said he wanted the money for his stock, or some such rubbish. Why, he
  wouldn't have a woman in to help me once a week if it wasn't for my standing
  out plucky. And the fusses he makes about money&mdash;comes to me well,
  pretty near crying, with sheets of paper and figgers. 'If only we can tide
  over this year,' he says, 'the business is bound to go.' 'If only we can tide
  over this year,' I says; 'then it'll be, if only we can tide over next year.
  I know you,' I says. 'And you don't catch me screwing myself lean and ugly.
  Why didn't you marry a slavey?' I says, 'if you wanted one&mdash;instead of a
  respectable girl,' I says."</p>

  <p>So Mrs. Coombes. But we will not follow this unedifying conversation
  further. Suffice it that Mr. Coombes was very satisfactorily disposed of, and
  they had a snug little time round the fire. Then Mrs. Coombes went to get the
  tea, and Jennie sat coquettishly on the arm of Mr. Clarence's chair until the
  tea-things clattered outside. "What was that I heard?" asked Mrs. Coombes
  playfully, as she entered, and there was badinage about kissing. They were
  just sitting down to the little circular table when the first intimation of
  Mr. Coombes' return was heard.</p>

  <p>This was a fumbling at the latch of the front door.</p>

  <p>"'Ere's my lord," said Mrs. Coombes. "Went out like a lion and comes back
  like a lamb, I'll lay."</p>

  <p>Something fell over in the shop: a chair, it sounded like. Then there was
  a sound as of some complicated step exercise in the passage. Then the door
  opened and Coombes appeared. But it was Coombes transfigured. The immaculate
  collar had been torn carelessly from his throat. His carefully-brushed silk
  hat, half-full of a crush of fungi, was under one arm; his coat was inside
  out, and his waistcoat adorned with bunches of yellow-blossomed furze. These
  little eccentricities of Sunday costume however, were quite overshadowed by
  the change in his face; it was livid white, his eyes were unnaturally large
  and bright, and his pale blue lips were drawn back in a cheerless grin.
  "Merry!" he said. He had stopped dancing to open the door. "Rational
  'njoyment. Dance." He made three fantastic steps into the room, and stood
  bowing.</p>

  <p>"Jim!" shrieked Mrs. Coombes, and Mr. Clarence sat petrified, with a
  dropping lower jaw.</p>

  <p>"Tea," said Mr. Coombes. "Jol' thing, tea. Tose-stools, too. Brosher."</p>

  <p>"He's drunk," said Jennie in a weak voice. Never before had she seen this
  intense pallor in a drunken man, or such shining, dilated eyes.</p>

  <p>Mr. Coombes held out a handful of scarlet agaric to Mr. Clarence. "Jo'
  stuff," said he; "ta' some."</p>

  <p>At that moment he was genial. Then at the sight of their startled faces he
  changed, with the swift transition of insanity, into overbearing fury. And it
  seemed as if he had suddenly recalled the quarrel of his departure. In such a
  huge voice as Mrs. Coombes had never heard before, he shouted, "My house. I'm
  master 'ere. Eat what I give yer!" He bawled this, as it seemed, without an
  effort, without a violent gesture, standing there as motionless as one who
  whispers, holding out a handful of fungus.</p>

  <p>Clarence approved himself a coward. He could not meet the mad fury in
  Coombes' eyes; he rose to his feet, pushing back his chair, and turned,
  stooping. At that Coombes rushed at him. Jennie saw her opportunity and, with
  the ghost of a shriek, made for the door.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Coombes followed her. Clarence tried to dodge. Over went the tea-
  table with a smash as Coombes clutched him by the collar and tried to thrust
  the fungus into his mouth. Clarence was content to leave his collar behind
  him, and shot out into the passage with red patches of fly agaric still
  adherent to his face. "Shut 'im in!" cried Mrs. Coombes, and would have
  closed the door, but her supports deserted her; Jennie saw the shop door
  open, and vanished thereby, locking it behind her, while Clarence went on
  hastily into the kitchen. Mr. Coombes came heavily against the door, and Mrs.
  Coombes, finding the key was inside, fled upstairs and locked herself in the
  spare bedroom.</p>

  <p>So the new convert to joie de vivre emerged upon the passage, his
  decorations a little scattered, but that respectable hatful of fungi still
  under his arm. He hesitated at the three ways, and decided on the kitchen.
  Whereupon Clarence, who was fumbling with the key, gave up the attempt to
  imprison his host, and fled into the scullery, only to be captured before he
  could open the door into the yard. Mr. Clarence is singularly reticent of the
  details of what occurred. It seems that Mr. Coombes' transitory irritation
  had vanished again, and he was once more a genial playfellow. And as there
  were knives and meat choppers about, Clarence very generously resolved to
  humour him and so avoid anything tragic. It is beyond dispute that Mr.
  Coombes played with Mr. Clarence to his heart's content; they could not have
  been more playful and familiar if they had known each other for years. He
  insisted gaily on Clarence trying the fungi and, after a friendly tussle, was
  smitten with remorse at the mess he was making of his guest's face. It also
  appears that Clarence was dragged under the sink and his face scrubbed with
  the blacking brush&mdash;, he being still resolved to humour the lunatic at
  any cost&mdash;, and that finally, in a somewhat dishevelled, chipped, and
  discoloured condition, he was assisted to his coat and shown out by the back
  door, the shopway being barred by Jennie. Mr. Coombes' wandering thoughts
  then turned to Jennie. Jennie had been unable to unfasten the shop door, but
  she shot the bolts against Mr. Coombes' latchkey, and remained in possession
  of the shop for the rest of the evening.</p>

  <p>It would appear that Mr. Coombes then returned to the kitchen, still in
  pursuit of gaiety, and, albeit a strict Good Templar, drank (or spilt down
  the front of the first and only frock-coat) no less than five bottles of the
  stout Mrs. Coombes insisted upon having for her health's sake. He made
  cheerful noises by breaking off the necks of the bottles with several of his
  wife's wedding-present dinner-plates, and during the earlier part of this
  great drunk he sang divers merry ballads. He cut his finger rather badly with
  one of the bottles&mdash;, the only bloodshed in this story&mdash;, and what
  with that, and the systematic convulsion of his inexperienced physiology by
  the liquorish brand of Mrs. Coombes' stout, it may be the evil of the fungus
  poison was somehow allayed. But we prefer to draw a veil over the concluding
  incidents of this Sunday afternoon. They ended in the coal cellar, in a deep
  and healing sleep.</p>

  <p>An interval of five years elapsed. Again it was a Sunday afternoon in
  October, and again Mr. Coombes walked through the pine wood beyond the canal.
  He was still the same dark-eyed, black-moustached little man that he was at
  the outset of the story, but his double chin was now scarcely so illusory as
  it had been. His overcoat was new, with a velvet lapel, and a stylish collar
  with turn-down corners, free of any coarse starchiness, had replaced the
  original all-round article. His hat was glossy, his gloves
  newish&mdash;though one finger had split and been carefully mended. And a
  casual observer would have noticed about him a certain rectitude of bearing,
  a certain erectness of head that marks the man who thinks well of himself. He
  was a master now, with three assistants. Beside him walked a larger sunburnt
  parody of himself, his brother Tom, just back from Australia. They were
  recapitulating their early struggles, and Mr. Coombes had just been making a
  financial statement.</p>

  <p>"It's a very nice little business, Jim," said brother Tom. "In these days
  of competition you're jolly lucky to have worked it up so. And you're jolly
  lucky too, to have a wife who's willing to help like yours does."</p>

  <p>"Between ourselves," said Mr. Coombes, "it wasn't always so. It wasn't
  always like this. To begin with, the missus was a bit giddy. Girls are funny
  creatures."</p>

  <p>"Dear me!</p>

  <p>"Yes. You'd hardly think it, but she was downright extravagant, and always
  having slaps at me. I was a bit too easy and loving, and all that, and she
  thought the whole blessed show was run for her. Turned the 'ouse into a
  regular caravansery, always having her relations and girls from business in,
  and their chaps. Comic songs a' Sunday, it was getting to, and driving trade
  away. And she was making eyes at the chaps, too! I tell you Tom, the place
  wasn't my own."</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't 'a' thought it."</p>

  <p>"It was so. Well&mdash;I reasoned with her. I said, 'I ain't a duke, to
  keep a wife like a pet animal. I married you for 'elp and company.' I said,
  'You got to 'elp and pull the business through.' She wouldn't 'ear of it.
  'Very well,' I says; 'I'm a mild man till I'm roused,' I says, 'and it's
  getting to that.' But she wouldn't 'ear of no warnings."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"It's the way with women. She didn't think I 'ad it in me to be roused.
  Women of her sort (between ourselves, Tom) don't respect a man until they're
  a bit afraid of him. So I just broke out to show her. In comes a girl named
  Jennie, that used to work with her, and her chap. We 'ad a bit of a row, and
  I came out 'ere&mdash;it was just such another day as this&mdash;and I
  thought it all out. Then I went back and pitched into them."</p>

  <p>"You did?"</p>

  <p>"I did. I was mad, I can tell you. I wasn't going to 'it 'er if I could
  'elp it, so I went back and licked into this chap, just to show 'er what I
  could do. 'E was a big chap, too. Well, I chucked him, and smashed things
  about, and gave 'er a scaring, and she ran up and locked 'erself into the
  spare room."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"That's all. I says to 'er the next morning, 'Now you know,' I says, 'what
  I'm like when I'm roused.' And I didn't have to say anything more."</p>

  <p>"And you've been happy ever after, eh?"</p>

  <p>"So to speak. There's nothing like putting your foot down with them. If it
  'adn't been for that afternoon I should 'a' been tramping the roads now, and
  she'd 'a' been grumbling at me, and all her family grumbling for bringing her
  to poverty&mdash;I know their little ways. But we're all right now. And it's
  a very decent little business, as you say."</p>

  <p>They proceeded on their way meditatively. "Women are funny creatures,"
  said Brother Tom. "They want a firm hand," says Coombes.</p>

  <p>"What a lot of these funguses there are about here!" remarked Brother Tom
  presently. "I can't see what use they are in the world."</p>

  <p>Mr. Coombes looked. "I dessay they're sent for some wise purpose," said
  Mr. Coombes.</p>

  <p>And that was as much thanks as the purple pileus ever got for maddening
  this absurd little man to the pitch of decisive action, and so altering the
  whole course of his life.</p>

     name="story36">THE SEA RAIDERS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Sun Literary Supplement</i>, December 6,
  1896</h3>

  <h2>I</h2>

  <p>Until the extraordinary affair at Sidmouth, the peculiar species
  <i>Haploteuthis ferox</i> was known to science only generically, on the
  strength of a half-digested tentacle obtained near the Azores, and a decaying
  body pecked by birds and nibbled by fish, found early in 1896 by Mr.
  Jennings, near Land's End.</p>

  <p>In no department of zoological science, indeed are we quite so much in the
  dark as with regard to the deep-sea cephalopods. A mere accident, for
  instance, it was that led to the Prince of Monaco's discovery of nearly a
  dozen new forms in the summer of 1895, a discovery in which the
  before-mentioned tentacle was included. It chanced that a cachalot was killed
  off Terceira by some sperm whalers, and in its last struggles charged almost
  to the Prince's yacht, missed it, rolled under, and died within twenty yards
  of his rudder. And in its agony it threw up a number of large objects, which
  the Prince, dimly perceiving they were strange and important, was by a happy
  expedient, able to secure before they sank. He set his screws in motion, and
  kept them circling in the vortices thus created until a boat could be
  lowered. And these specimens were whole cephalopods and fragments of
  cephalopods, some of gigantic proportions, and almost all of them unknown to
  science!</p>

  <p>It would seem, indeed, that these large and agile creatures, living in the
  middle depths of the sea, must to a large extent, for ever remain unknown to
  us, since under water they are too nimble for nets, and it is only by such
  rare, unlooked-for accidents that specimens can be obtained. In the case of
  Haploteuthis ferox, for instance, we are still altogether ignorant of its
  habitat, as ignorant as we are of the breeding-ground of the herring or the
  sea-ways of the salmon. And zoologists are altogether at a loss to account
  for its sudden appearance on our coast. Possibly it was the stress of a
  hunger migration that drove it hither out of the deep. But it will be,
  perhaps, better to avoid necessarily inconclusive discussion, and to proceed
  at once with our narrative.</p>

  <p>The first human being to set eyes upon a living Haploteuthis&mdash;the
  first human being to survive, that is, for there can be little doubt now that
  the wave of bathing fatalities and boating accidents that travelled along the
  coast of Cornwall and Devon in early May was due to this cause&mdash;was a
  retired tea-dealer of the name of Fison, who was stopping at a Sidmouth
  boarding-house. It was in the afternoon, and he was walking along the cliff
  path between Sidmouth and Ladram Bay. The cliffs in this direction are very
  high, but down the red face of them in one place a kind of ladder staircase
  has been made. He was near this when his attention was attracted by what at
  first he thought to be a cluster of birds struggling over a fragment of food
  that caught the sunlight, and glistened pinkish-white. The tide was right
  out, and this object was not only far below him, but remote across a broad
  waste of rock reefs covered with dark seaweed and interspersed with silvery
  shining tidal pools. And he was, moreover dazzled by the brightness of the
  further water.</p>

  <p>In a minute, regarding this again, he perceived that his judgment was in
  fault, for over this struggle circled a number of birds, jackdaws and gulls
  for the most part, the latter gleaming blindingly when the sunlight smote
  their wings, and they seemed minute in comparison with it. And his curiosity
  was, perhaps aroused all the more strongly because of his first insufficient
  explanations.</p>

  <p>As he had nothing better to do than amuse himself, he decided to make this
  object, whatever it was, the goal of his afternoon walk, instead of Ladram
  Bay, conceiving it might perhaps be a great fish of some sort, stranded by
  some chance, and flapping about in its distress. And so he hurried down the
  long steep ladder, stopping at intervals of thirty feet or so to take breath
  and scan the mysterious movement.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the cliff he was, of course, nearer his object than he had
  been; but, on the other hand, it now came up against the incandescent sky,
  beneath the sun, so as to seem dark and indistinct. Whatever was pinkish of
  it was now hidden by a skerry of weedy boulders. But he perceived that it was
  made up of seven rounded bodies distinct or connected, and that the birds
  kept up a constant croaking and screaming, but seemed afraid to approach it
  too closely.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fison, torn by curiosity, began picking his way across the wave-worn
  rocks, and finding the wet seaweed that covered them thickly rendered them
  extremely slippery, he stopped, removed his shoes and socks, and rolled his
  trousers above his knees. His object was, of course, merely to avoid
  stumbling into the rocky pools about him, and perhaps he was rather glad, as
  all men are, of an excuse to resume, even for a moment, the sensations of his
  boyhood. At any rate, it is to this, no doubt, that he owes his life.</p>

  <p>He approached his mark with all the assurance which the absolute security
  of this country against all forms of animal life gives its inhabitants. The
  round bodies moved to and fro, but it was only when he surmounted the skerry
  of boulders, I have mentioned, that he realised the horrible nature of the
  discovery. It came upon him with some suddenness.</p>

  <p>The rounded bodies fell apart as he came into sight over the ridge, and
  displayed the pinkish object to be the partially devoured body of a human
  being, but whether of a man or woman he was unable to say. And the rounded
  bodies were new and ghastly-looking creatures, in shape somewhat resembling
  an octopus, with huge and very long and flexible tentacles, coiled copiously
  on the ground. The skin had a glistening texture, unpleasant to see, like
  shiny leather. The downward bend of the tentacle-surrounded mouth, the
  curious excrescence at the bend, the tentacles, and the large intelligent
  eyes, gave the creatures a grotesque suggestion of a face. They were the size
  of a fair-sized swine about the body, and the tentacles seemed to him to be
  many feet in length. There were, he thinks, seven or eight at least of the
  creatures. Twenty yards beyond them, amid the surf of the now returning tide,
  two others were emerging from the sea.</p>

  <p>Their bodies lay flatly on the rocks, and their eyes regarded him with
  evil interest; but it does not appear that Mr. Fison was afraid, or that he
  realised that he was in any danger. Possibly his confidence is to be ascribed
  to the limpness of their attitudes. But he was horrified, of course, and
  intensely excited and indignant, at such revolting creatures preying upon
  human flesh. He thought they had chanced upon a drowned body. He shouted to
  them, with the idea of driving them off, and finding they did not budge, cast
  about him, picked up a big rounded lump of rock, and flung it at one.</p>

  <p>And then, slowly uncoiling their tentacles, they all began moving towards
  him&mdash;creeping at first deliberately, and making a soft purring sound to
  each other.</p>

  <p>In a moment Mr. Fison realised that he was in danger. He shouted again,
  threw both his boots, and started off, with a leap, forthwith. Twenty yards
  off he stopped and faced about, judging them slow, and behold! The tentacles
  of their leader were already pouring over the rocky ridge on which he had
  just been standing!</p>

  <p>At that he shouted again, but this time not threatening, but a cry of
  dismay, and began jumping, striding, slipping, wading across the uneven
  expanse between him and the beach. The tall red cliffs seemed suddenly at a
  vast distance, and he saw, as though they were creatures in another world,
  two minute workmen engaged in the repair of the ladder-way, and little
  suspecting the race for life that was beginning below them. At one time he
  could hear the creatures splashing in the pools not a dozen feet behind him,
  and once he slipped and almost fell.</p>

  <p>They chased him to the very foot of the cliffs, and desisted only when he
  had been joined by the workmen at the foot of the ladder-way up the cliff.
  All three of the men pelted them with stones for a time, and then hurried to
  the cliff top and along the path towards Sidmouth, to secure assistance and a
  boat, and to rescue the desecrated body from the clutches of these abominable
  creatures.</p><br>

  <h2>II</h2>

  <p>And as if he had not already been in sufficient peril that day, Mr. Fison
  went with the boat to point out the exact spot of his adventure.</p>

  <p>As the tide was down, it required a considerable detour to reach the spot,
  and when at last they came off the ladder-way, the mangled body had
  disappeared. The water was now running in, submerging first one slab of slimy
  rock and then another, and the four men in the boat&mdash;the workmen, that
  is, the boatman, and Mr. Fison&mdash;now turned their attention from the
  bearings off shore to the water beneath the keel.</p>

  <p>At first they could see little below them, save a dark jungle of
  laminaria, with an occasional darting fish. Their minds were set on
  adventure, and they expressed their disappointment freely. But presently they
  saw one of the monsters swimming through the water seaward, with a curious
  rolling motion that suggested to Mr. Fison the spinning roll of a captive
  balloon. Almost immediately after, the waving streamers of laminaria were
  extraordinarily perturbed, parted for a moment, and three of these beasts
  became darkly visible, struggling for what was probably some fragment of the
  drowned man. In a moment the copious olive-green ribbons had poured again
  over this writhing group.</p>

  <p>At that all four men, greatly excited, began beating the water with oars
  and shouting, and immediately they saw a tumultuous movement among the weeds.
  They desisted to see more clearly, and as soon as the water was smooth, they
  saw, as it seemed to them, the whole sea bottom among the weeds set with
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ugly swine!" cried one of the men. "Why, there's dozens!"</p>

  <p>And forthwith the things began to rise through the water about them. Mr.
  Fison has since described to the writer this startling eruption out of the
  waving laminaria meadows. To him it seemed to occupy a considerable time, but
  it is probable that really it was an affair of a few seconds only. For a time
  nothing but eyes, and then he speaks of tentacles streaming out and parting
  the weed fronds this way and that. Then these things, growing larger, until
  at last the bottom was hidden by their intercoiling forms, and the tips of
  tentacles rose darkly here and there into the air above the swell of the
  waters.</p>

  <p>One came up boldly to the side of the boat, and clinging to this with
  three of its sucker-set tentacles, threw four others over the gunwale, as if
  with an intention either of oversetting the boat or of clambering into it.
  Mr. Fison at once caught up the boathook, and jabbing furiously at the soft
  tentacles, forced it to desist. He was struck in the back and almost pitched
  overboard by the boatman, who was using his oar to resist a similar attack on
  the other side of the boat. But the tentacles on either side at once relaxed
  their hold, slid out of sight, and splashed into the water.</p>

  <p>"We'd better get out of this," said Mr. Fison, who was trembling
  violently. He went to the tiller, while the boatman and one of the workmen
  seated themselves and began rowing. The other workman stood up in the fore
  part of the boat, with the boathook, ready to strike any more tentacles that
  might appear. Nothing else seems to have been said. Mr. Fison had expressed
  the common feeling beyond amendment. In a hushed, scared mood, with faces
  white and drawn, they set about escaping from the position into which they
  had so recklessly blundered.</p>

  <p>But the oars had scarcely dropped into the water before dark, tapering,
  serpentine ropes had bound them, and were about the rudder; and creeping up
  the sides of the boat with a looping motion came the suckers again. The men
  gripped their oars and pulled, but it was like trying to move a boat in a
  floating raft of weeds. "Help here!" cried the boatman, and Mr. Fison and the
  second workman rushed to help lug at the oar.</p>

  <p>Then the man with the boathook&mdash;his name was Ewan, or
  Ewen&mdash;sprang up with a curse and began striking downward over the side,
  as far as he could reach, at the bank of tentacles that now clustered along
  the boat's bottom. And, at the same time, the two rowers stood up to get a
  better purchase for the recovery of their oars. The boatman handed his to Mr.
  Fison, who lugged desperately, and meanwhile, the boatman opened a big
  clasp-knife, and leaning over the side of the boat, began hacking at the
  spiring arms upon the oar shaft.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fison, staggering with the quivering rocking of the boat, his teeth
  set, his breath coming short, and the veins starting on his hands as he
  pulled at his oar, suddenly cast his eyes seaward. And there, not fifty yards
  off, across the long rollers of the incoming tide, was a large boat standing
  in towards them, with three women and a little child in it. A boatman was
  rowing, and a little man in a pink-ribboned straw hat and whites stood in the
  stern hailing them. For a moment, of course, Mr. Fison thought of help, and
  then he thought of the child. He abandoned his oar forthwith, threw up his
  arms in a frantic gesture, and screamed to the party in the boat to keep away
  "for God's sake!" It says much for the modesty and courage of Mr. Fison that
  he does not seem to be aware that there was any quality of heroism in his
  action at this juncture. The oar he had abandoned was at once drawn under,
  and presently reappeared floating about twenty yards away.</p>

  <p>At the same moment Mr. Fison felt the boat under him lurch violently, and
  a hoarse scream, a prolonged cry of terror from Hill, the boatman, caused him
  to forget the party of excursionists altogether. He turned, and saw Hill
  crouching by the forward rowlock, his face convulsed with terror, and his
  right arm over the side and drawn tightly down. He gave now a succession of
  short, sharp cries, "Oh! Oh! Oh&mdash;! Oh!" Mr. Fison believes that he must
  have been hacking at the tentacles below the water-line, and have been
  grasped by them, but of course, it is quite impossible to say now certainly
  what had happened. The boat was heeling over, so that the gunwale was within
  ten inches of the water, and both Ewan and the other labourer were striking
  down into the water, with oar and boathook, on either side of Hill's arm. Mr.
  Fison instinctively placed himself to counterpoise them.</p>

  <p>Then Hill, who was a burly, powerful man, made a strenuous effort, and
  rose almost to a standing position. He lifted his arm, indeed, clean out of
  the water. Hanging to it was a complicated tangle of brown ropes, and the
  eyes of one of the brutes that had hold of him, glaring straight and
  resolute, showed momentarily above the surface. The boat heeled more and
  more, and the green-brown water came pouring in a cascade over the side. Then
  Hill slipped and fell with his ribs across the side, and his arm and the mass
  of tentacles about it splashed back into the water. He rolled over; his boot
  kicked Mr. Fison's knee as that gentleman rushed forward to seize him, and in
  another moment fresh tentacles had whipped about his waist and neck, and
  after a brief, convulsive struggle, in which the boat was nearly capsized,
  Hill was lugged overboard. The boat righted with a violent jerk that all but
  sent Mr. Fison over the other side, and hid the struggle in the water from
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>He stood staggering to recover his balance for a moment, and as he did so
  he became aware that the struggle and the inflowing tide had carried them
  close upon the weedy rocks again. Not four yards off a table of rock still
  rose in rhythmic movements above the in-wash of the tide. In a moment Mr.
  Fison seized the oar from Ewan, gave one vigorous stroke, then dropping it,
  ran to the bows and leapt. He felt his feet slide over the rock, and by a
  frantic effort, leapt again towards a further mass. He stumbled over this,
  came to his knees, and rose again.</p>

  <p>"Look out!" cried someone, and a large drab body struck him. He was
  knocked flat into a tidal pool by one of the workmen, and as he went down he
  heard smothered, choking cries, that he believed at the time came from Hill.
  Then he found himself marvelling at the shrillness and variety of Hill's
  voice. Someone jumped over him, and a curving rush of foamy water poured over
  him, and passed. He scrambled to his feet dripping, and without looking
  seaward, ran as fast as his terror would let him shoreward. Before him, over
  the flat space of scattered rocks, stumbled the two workmen&mdash;one a dozen
  yards in front of the other.</p>

  <p>He looked over his shoulder at last, and seeing that he was not pursued,
  faced about. He was astonished. From the moment of the rising of the
  cephalopods out of the water he had been acting too swiftly to fully
  comprehend his actions. Now it seemed to him as if he had suddenly jumped out
  of an evil dream.</p>

  <p>For there were the sky, cloudless and blazing with the afternoon sun, the
  sea weltering under its pitiless brightness, the soft creamy foam of the
  breaking water, and the low, long, dark ridges of rock. The righted boat
  floated, rising and falling gently on the swell about a dozen yards from
  shore. Hill and the monsters, all the stress and tumult of that fierce fight
  for life, had vanished as though they had never been.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fison's heart was beating violently; he was throbbing to the finger-
  tips, and his breath came deep.</p>

  <p>There was something missing. For some seconds he could not think clearly
  enough what this might be. Sun, sky, sea, rocks&mdash;what was it? Then he
  remembered the boatload of excursionists. It had vanished. He wondered
  whether he had imagined it. He turned, and saw the two workmen standing side
  by side under the projecting masses of the tall pink cliffs. He hesitated
  whether he should make one last attempt to save the man Hill. His physical
  excitement seemed to desert him suddenly, and leave him aimless and helpless.
  He turned shoreward, stumbling and wading towards his two companions.</p>

  <p>He looked back again, and there were now two boats floating, and the one
  farthest out at sea pitched clumsily, bottom upward.</p><br>

  <h2>III</h2>

  <p>So it was Haploteuthis ferox made its appearance upon the Devonshire
  coast. So far, this has been its most serious aggression. Mr. Fison's
  account, taken together with the wave of boating and bathing casualties to
  which I have already alluded, and the absence of fish from the Cornish coasts
  that year, points clearly to a shoal of these voracious deep-sea monsters
  prowling slowly along the sub-tidal coastline. Hunger migration has, I know,
  been suggested as the force that drove them hither; but, for my own part, I
  prefer to believe the alternative theory of Hemsley. Hemsley holds that a
  pack or shoal of these creatures may have become enamoured of human flesh by
  the accident of a foundered ship sinking among them, and have wandered in
  search of it out of their accustomed zone; first way-laying and following
  ships, and so coming to our shores in the wake of the Atlantic traffic. But
  to discuss Hemsley's cogent and admirably-stated arguments would be out of
  place here.</p>

  <p>It would seem that the appetites of the shoal were satisfied by the catch
  of eleven people&mdash;for, so far as can be ascertained, there were ten
  people in the second boat, and certainly these creatures gave no further
  signs of their presence off Sidmouth that day. The coast between Seaton and
  Budleigh Salterton was patrolled all that evening and night by four
  Preventive Service boats, the men in which were armed with harpoons and
  cutlasses, and as the evening advanced, a number of more or less similarly
  equipped expeditions, organised by private individuals, joined them. Mr.
  Fison took no part in any of these expeditions.</p>

  <p>About midnight excited hails were heard from a boat about a couple of
  miles out at sea to the south-east of Sidmouth, and a lantern was seen waving
  in a strange manner to and fro and up and down. The nearer boats at once
  hurried towards the alarm. The venturesome occupants of the boat, a seaman, a
  curate, and two schoolboys, had actually seen the monsters passing under
  their boat. The creatures, it seems, like most deep-sea organisms, were
  phosphorescent, and they had been floating, five fathoms deep or so, like
  creatures of moonshine through the blackness of the water, their tentacles
  retracted and as if asleep, rolling over and over, and moving slowly in a
  wedge-like formation towards the south-east.</p>

  <p>These people told their story in gesticulated fragments, as first one boat
  drew alongside and then another. At last there was a little fleet of eight or
  nine boats collected together, and from them a tumult, like the chatter of a
  marketplace, rose into the stillness of the night. There was little or no
  disposition to pursue the shoal, the people had neither weapons nor
  experience for such a dubious chase, and presently&mdash;even with a certain
  relief, it may be&mdash;the boats turned shoreward.</p>

  <p>And now to tell what is perhaps the most astonishing fact in this whole
  astonishing raid. We have not the slightest knowledge of the subsequent
  movements of the shoal, although the whole south-west coast was now alert for
  it. But it may, perhaps, be significant that a cachalot was stranded off Sark
  on June 3. Two weeks and three days after this Sidmouth affair, a living
  Haploteuthis came ashore on Calais sands. It was alive, because several
  witnesses saw its tentacles moving in a convulsive way. But it is probable
  that it was dying. A gentleman named Pouchet obtained a rifle and shot
  it.</p>

  <p>That was the last appearance of a living Haploteuthis. No others were seen
  on the French coast. On the 15th of June a dead carcass, almost complete, was
  washed ashore near Torquay, and a few days later a boat from the Marine
  Biological station, engaged in dredging off Plymouth, picked up a rotting
  specimen, slashed deeply with a cutlass wound. How the former had come by its
  death it is impossible to say. And on the last day of June, Mr. Egbert Caine,
  an artist, bathing near Newlyn, threw up his arms, shrieked, and was drawn
  under. A friend bathing with him made no attempt to save him, but swam at
  once for the shore. This is the last fact to tell of this extraordinary raid
  from the deeper sea. Whether it is really the last of these horrible
  creatures it is, as yet, premature to say. But it is believed, and certainly
  it is to be hoped, that they have returned now, and returned for good, to the
  sunless depths of the middle seas, out of which they have so strangely and so
  mysteriously arisen.</p>

     name="story37">THE CRYSTAL EGG</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The New Review</i>, May 1897</h3>

  <p>There was, until a year ago, a little and very grimy-looking shop near
  Seven Dials over which, in weather-worn yellow lettering, the name of "C.
  Cave, Naturalist and Dealer in Antiquities," was inscribed. The contents of
  its window were curiously variegated. They comprised some elephant tusks and
  an imperfect set of chessmen, beads and weapons, a box of eyes, two skulls of
  tigers and one human, several moth-eaten stuffed monkeys (one holding a
  lamp), an old-fashioned cabinet, a fly-blown ostrich egg or so, some
  fishing-tackle, and an extraordinarily dirty, empty glass fish-tank. There
  was also, at the moment the story begins, a mass of crystal, worked into the
  shape of an egg and brilliantly polished. And at that two people, who stood
  outside the window, were looking, one of them a tall, thin clergyman, the
  other a black-bearded young man of dusky complexion and unobtrusive costume.
  The dusky young man spoke with eager gesticulation, and seemed anxious for
  his companion to purchase the article.</p>

  <p>While they were there, Mr. Cave came into his shop, his beard still
  wagging with the bread and butter of his tea. When he saw these men and the
  object of their regard, his countenance fell. He glanced guiltily over his
  shoulder, and softly shut the door. He was a little old man, with pale face
  and peculiar watery blue eyes; his hair was a dirty grey, and he wore a
  shabby blue frock-coat, an ancient silk hat, and carpet slippers very much
  down at heel. He remained watching the two men as they talked. The clergyman
  went deep into his trouser pocket, examined a handful of money, and showed
  his teeth in an agreeable smile. Mr. Cave seemed still more depressed when
  they came into the shop.</p>

  <p>The clergyman, without any ceremony, asked the price of the crystal egg.
  Mr. Cave glanced nervously towards the door leading into the parlour, and
  said five pounds. The clergyman protested that the price was high, to his
  companion as well as to Mr. Cave&mdash;it was, indeed, very much more than
  Mr. Cave had intended to ask, when he had stocked the article&mdash;and an
  attempt at bargaining ensued. Mr. Cave stepped to the shop-door, and held it
  open. "Five pounds is my price," he said, as though he wished to save himself
  the trouble of unprofitable discussion. As he did so, the upper portion of a
  woman's face appeared above the blind in the glass upper panel of the door
  leading into the parlour, and stared curiously at the two customers. "Five
  pounds is my price," said Mr. Cave, with a quiver in his voice.</p>

  <p>The swarthy young man had so far remained a spectator, watching Cave
  keenly. Now he spoke. "Give him five pounds," he said. The clergyman glanced
  at him to see if he were in earnest, and, when he looked at Mr. Cave again,
  he saw that the latter's face was white. "It's a lot of money," said the
  clergyman, and diving into his pocket, began counting his resources. He had
  little more than thirty shillings, and he appealed to his companion, with
  whom he seemed to be on terms of considerable intimacy. This gave Mr. Cave an
  opportunity of collecting his thoughts, and he began to explain in an
  agitated manner that the crystal was not, as a matter of fact, entirely free
  for sale. His two customers were naturally surprised at this, and inquired
  why he had not thought of that before he began to bargain. Mr. Cave became
  confused, but he stuck to his story, that the crystal was not in the market
  that afternoon, that a probable purchaser of it had already appeared. The
  two, treating this as an attempt to raise the price still further, made as if
  they would leave the shop. But at this point the parlour door opened, and the
  owner of the dark fringe and the little eyes appeared.</p>

  <p>She was a coarse-featured, corpulent woman, younger and very much larger
  than Mr. Cave; she walked heavily, and her face was flushed. "That crystal is
  for sale," she said. "And five pounds is a good enough price for it. I can't
  think what you're about Cave, not to take the gentleman's offer!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Cave, greatly perturbed by the irruption, looked angrily at her over
  the rims of his spectacles, and without excessive assurance, asserted his
  right to manage his business in his own way. An altercation began. The two
  customers watched the scene with interest and some amusement, occasionally
  assisting Mrs. Cave with suggestions. Mr. Cave, hard driven, persisted in a
  confused and impossible story of an enquiry for the crystal that morning, and
  his agitation became painful. But he stuck to his point with extraordinary
  persistence. It was the young Oriental who ended this curious controversy. He
  proposed that they should call again in the course of two days&mdash;so as to
  give the alleged enquirer a fair chance. "And then we must insist," said the
  clergyman. "Five pounds." Mrs. Cave took it on herself to apologise for her
  husband, explaining that he was sometimes "a little odd," and as the two
  customers left, the couple prepared for a free discussion of the incident in
  all its bearings.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Cave talked to her husband with singular directness. The poor little
  man, quivering with emotion, muddled himself between his stories, maintaining
  on the one hand that he had another customer in view, and on the other
  asserting that the crystal was honestly worth ten guineas. "Why did you ask
  five pounds?" said his wife. "Do let me manage my business my own way!" said
  Mr. Cave.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cave had living with him a step-daughter and a step-son, and at supper
  that night the transaction was re-discussed. None of them had a high opinion
  of Mr. Cave's business methods, and this action seemed a culminating
  folly.</p>

  <p>"It's my opinion he's refused that crystal before," said the step-son, a
  loose-limbed lout of eighteen.</p>

  <p>"But Five Pounds!" said the step-daughter, an argumentative young woman of
  six-and-twenty.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cave's answers were wretched; he could only mumble weak assertions
  that he knew his own business best. They drove him from his half-eaten supper
  into the shop, to close it for the night, his ears aflame and tears of
  vexation behind his spectacles. "Why had he left the crystal in the window so
  long? The folly of it!" That was the trouble closest in his mind. For a time
  he could see no way of evading sale.</p>

  <p>After supper his step-daughter and step-son smartened themselves up and
  went out and his wife retired upstairs to reflect upon the business aspects
  of the crystal, over a little sugar and lemon and so forth in hot water. Mr.
  Cave went into the shop, and stayed there until late, ostensibly to make
  ornamental rockeries for gold-fish cases but really for a private purpose
  that will be better explained later. The next day Mrs. Cave found that the
  crystal had been removed from the window, and was lying behind some
  second-hand books on angling. She replaced it in a conspicuous position. But
  she did not argue further about it, as a nervous headache disinclined her
  from debate. Mr. Cave was always disinclined. The day passed disagreeably.
  Mr. Cave was, if anything, more absent-minded than usual, and uncommonly
  irritable withal. In the afternoon, when his wife was taking her customary
  sleep, he removed the crystal from the window again.</p>

  <p>The next day Mr. Cave had to deliver a consignment of dog-fish at one of
  the hospital schools, where they were needed for dissection. In his absence
  Mrs. Cave's mind reverted to the topic of the crystal, and the methods of
  expenditure suitable to a windfall of five pounds. She had already devised
  some very agreeable expedients, among others a dress of green silk for
  herself and a trip to Richmond, when a jangling of the front door bell
  summoned her into the shop. The customer was an examination coach who came to
  complain of the non-delivery of certain frogs asked for the previous day.
  Mrs. Cave did not approve of this particular branch of Mr. Cave's business,
  and the gentleman, who had called in a somewhat aggressive mood, retired
  after a brief exchange of words&mdash;entirely civil so far as he was
  concerned. Mrs. Cave's eye then naturally turned to the window; for the sight
  of the crystal was an assurance of the five pounds and of her dreams. What
  was her surprise to find it gone!</p>

  <p>She went to the place behind the locker on the counter, where she had
  discovered it the day before. It was not there; and she immediately began an
  eager search about the shop.</p>

  <p>When Mr. Cave returned from his business with the dog-fish, about a
  quarter to, two in the afternoon, he found the shop in some confusion, and
  his wife, extremely exasperated and on her knees behind the counter, routing
  among his taxidermic material. Her face came up hot and angry over the
  counter, as the jangling bell announced his return, and she forthwith accused
  him of "hiding it."</p>

  <p>"Hid what?" asked Mr. Cave.</p>

  <p>"The crystal!"</p>

  <p>At that Mr. Cave, apparently much surprised, rushed to the window. "Isn't
  it here?" he said. "Great Heavens! What has become of it?"</p>

  <p>Just then, Mr. Cave's step-son re-entered the shop from the inner room
  &mdash;he had come home a minute or so before Mr. Cave&mdash;and he was
  blaspheming freely. He was apprenticed to a second-hand furniture dealer down
  the road, but he had his meals at home, and he was naturally annoyed to find
  no dinner ready.</p>

  <p>But when he heard of the loss of the crystal, he forgot his meal, and his
  anger was diverted from his mother to his step-father. Their first idea, of
  course, was that he had hidden it. But Mr. Cave stoutly denied all knowledge
  of its fate&mdash;freely offering his bedabbled affidavit in the
  matter&mdash;and at last was worked up to the point of accusing, first, his
  wife and then his step-son of having taken it with a view to a private sale.
  So began an exceedingly acrimonious and emotional discussion, which ended for
  Mrs. Cave in a peculiar nervous condition midway between hysterics and amuck,
  and caused the step-son to be half-an-hour late at the furniture
  establishment in the afternoon. Mr. Cave took refuge from his wife's emotions
  in the shop.</p>

  <p>In the evening the matter was resumed, with less passion and in a judicial
  spirit, under the presidency of the step-daughter. The supper passed
  unhappily and culminated in a painful scene. Mr. Cave gave way at last to
  extreme exasperation, and went out banging the front door violently. The rest
  of the family, having discussed him with the freedom his absence warranted,
  hunted the house from garret to cellar, hoping to light upon the crystal.</p>

  <p>The next day the two customers called again. They were received by Mrs.
  Cave almost in tears. It transpired that no one could imagine all that she
  had stood from Cave at various times in her married pilgrimage... She also
  gave a garbled account of the disappearance. The clergyman and the Oriental
  laughed silently at one another, and said it was very extraordinary. As Mrs.
  Cave seemed disposed to give them the complete history of her life they made
  to leave the shop. Thereupon Mrs. Cave, still clinging to hope, asked for the
  clergyman's address, so that, if she could get anything out of Cave, she
  might communicate it. The address was duly given, but apparently was
  afterwards mislaid. Mrs. Cave can remember nothing about it.</p>

  <p>In the evening of that day, the Caves seem to have exhausted their
  emotions, and Mr. Cave, who had been out in the afternoon, supped in a gloomy
  isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the impassioned controversy of the
  previous days. For some time matters were very badly strained in the Cave
  household, but neither crystal nor customer reappeared.</p>

  <p>Now without mincing the matter, we must admit that Mr. Cave was a liar. He
  knew perfectly well where the crystal was. It was in the rooms of Mr. Jacoby
  Wace, Assistant Demonstrator at St. Catherine's Hospital, Westbourne Street.
  It stood on the sideboard partially covered by a black velvet cloth, and
  beside a decanter of American whisky. It is from Mr. Wace, indeed, that the
  particulars upon which this narrative is based were derived. Cave had taken
  off the thing to the hospital hidden in the dog-fish sack, and there had
  pressed the young investigator to keep it for him. Mr. Wace was a little
  dubious at first. His relationship to Cave was peculiar. He had a taste for
  singular characters, and he had more than once invited the old man to smoke
  and drink in his rooms, and to unfold his rather amusing views of life in
  general and of his wife in particular. Mr. Wace had encountered Mrs. Cave
  too, on occasions when Mr. Cave was not at home to attend to him. He knew the
  constant interference to which Cave was subjected, and having weighed the
  story judicially, he decided to give the crystal a refuge. Mr. Cave promised
  to explain the reasons for his remarkable affection for the crystal more
  fully on a later occasion, but he spoke distinctly of seeing visions therein.
  He called on Mr. Wace the same evening.</p>

  <p>He told a complicated story. The crystal he said had come into his
  possession with other oddments at the forced sale of another curiosity
  dealer's effects, and not knowing what its value might be, he had ticketed it
  at ten shillings. It had hung upon his hands at that price for some months,
  and he was thinking of "reducing the figure," when he made a singular
  discovery.</p>

  <p>At that time his health was very bad&mdash;and it must be borne in mind
  that, throughout all this experience, his physical condition was one of ebb
  &mdash;and he was in considerable distress by reason of the negligence, the
  positive ill-treatment even, he received from his wife and step-children. His
  wife was vain, extravagant, unfeeling and had a growing taste for private
  drinking; his step-daughter was mean and over-reaching; and his step-son had
  conceived a violent dislike for him, and lost no chance of showing it. The
  requirements of his business pressed heavily upon him, and Mr. Wace does not
  think that he was altogether free from occasional intemperance. He had begun
  life in a comfortable position, he was a man of fair education, and he
  suffered, for weeks at a stretch, from melancholia and insomnia. Afraid to
  disturb his family, he would slip quietly from his wife's side, when his
  thoughts became intolerable, and wander about the house. And about three
  o'clock one morning, late in August, chance directed him into the shop.</p>

  <p>The dirty little place was impenetrably black except in one spot, where he
  perceived an unusual glow of light. Approaching this, he discovered it to be
  the crystal egg, which was standing on the corner of the counter towards the
  window. A thin ray smote through a crack in the shutters, impinged upon the
  object, and seemed as it were to fill its entire interior.</p>

  <p>It occurred to Mr. Cave that this was not in accordance with the laws of
  optics as he had known them in his younger days. He could understand the rays
  being refracted by the crystal and coming to a focus in its interior, but
  this diffusion jarred with his physical conceptions. He approached the
  crystal nearly, peering into it and round it, with a transient revival of the
  scientific curiosity that in his youth had determined his choice of a
  calling. He was surprised to find the light not steady, but writhing within
  the substance of the egg, as though that object was a hollow sphere of some
  luminous vapour. In moving about to get different points of view, he suddenly
  found that he had come between it and the ray, and that the crystal none the
  less remained luminous. Greatly astonished, he lifted it out of the light ray
  and carried it to the darkest part of the shop. It remained bright for some
  four or five minutes, when it slowly faded and went out. He placed it in the
  thin streak of daylight, and its luminousness was almost immediately
  restored.</p>

  <p>So far, at least, Mr. Wace was able to verify the remarkable story of Mr.
  Cave. He has himself repeatedly held this crystal in a ray of light (which
  had to be of a less diameter than one millimetre). And in a perfect darkness,
  such as could be produced by velvet wrapping, the crystal did undoubtedly
  appear very faintly phosphorescent. It would seem, however, that the
  luminousness was of some exceptional sort, and not equally visible to all
  eyes; for Mr. Harbinger&mdash;whose name will be familiar to the scientific
  reader in connection with the Pasteur Institute&mdash;was quite unable to see
  any light whatever. And Mr. Wace's own capacity for its appreciation was out
  of comparison inferior to that of Mr. Cave's. Even with Mr. Cave the power
  varied very considerably: his vision was most vivid during states of extreme
  weakness and fatigue.</p>

  <p>Now, from the outset this light in the crystal exercised a curious
  fascination upon Mr. Cave. And it says more for his loneliness of soul than a
  volume of pathetic writing could do, that he told no human being of his
  curious observations. He seems to have been living in such an atmosphere of
  petty spite that to admit the existence of a pleasure would have been to risk
  the loss of it. He found that as the dawn advanced, and the amount of
  diffused light increased, the crystal became to all appearance non-luminous.
  And for some time he was unable to see anything in it, except at night-time,
  in dark corners of the shop.</p>

  <p>But the use of an old velvet cloth, which he used as a background for a
  collection of minerals, occurred to him, and by doubling this, and putting it
  over his head and hands, he was able to get a sight of the luminous movement
  within the crystal even in the day-time. He was very cautious lest he should
  be thus discovered by his wife, and he practised this occupation only in the
  afternoons, while she was asleep upstairs, and then circumspectly in a hollow
  under the counter. And one day, turning the crystal about in his hands, he
  saw something. It came and went like a flash, but it gave him the impression
  that the object had for a moment opened to him the view of a wide and
  spacious and strange country; and turning it about, he did, just as the light
  faded, see the same vision again.</p>

  <p>Now, it would be tedious and unnecessary to state all the phases of Mr.
  Cave's discovery from this point. Suffice that the effect was this: the
  crystal, being peered into at an angle of about 137 degrees from the
  direction of the illuminating ray, gave a clear and consistent picture of a
  wide and peculiar countryside. It was not dream-like at all: it produced a
  definite impression of reality, and the better the light the more real and
  solid it seemed. It was a moving picture: that is to say, certain objects
  moved in it, but slowly in an orderly manner like real things, and according
  as the direction of the lighting and vision changed, the picture changed
  also. It must, indeed, have been like looking through an oval glass at a
  view, and turning the glass about to get at different aspects.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cave's statements, Mr. Wace assures me, were extremely circumstantial,
  and entirely free from any of that emotional quality that taints
  hallucinatory impressions. But it must be remembered that all the efforts of
  Mr. Wace to see any similar clarity in the faint opalescence of the crystal
  were wholly unsuccessful, try as he would. The difference in intensity of the
  impressions received by the two men was very great, and it is quite
  conceivable that what was a view to Mr. Cave was a mere blurred nebulosity to
  Mr. Wace.</p>

  <p>The view, as Mr. Cave described it, was invariably of an extensive plain,
  and he seemed always to be looking at it from a considerable height, as if
  from a tower or a mast. To the east and to the west the plain was bounded at
  a remote distance by vast reddish cliffs, which reminded him of those he had
  seen in some picture; but what the picture was Mr. Wace was unable to
  ascertain. These cliffs passed north and south&mdash;he could tell the points
  of the compass by the stars that were visible of a night&mdash;receding in an
  almost illimitable perspective and fading into the mists of the distance
  before they met. He was nearer the eastern set of cliffs, on the occasion of
  his first vision the sun was rising over them, and black against the sunlight
  and pale against their shadow appeared a multitude of soaring forms that Mr.
  Cave regarded as birds. A vast range of buildings spread below him; he seemed
  to be looking down upon them; and as they approached the blurred and
  refracted edge of the picture, they became indistinct. There were also trees
  curious in shape, and in colouring, a deep mossy green and an exquisite grey,
  beside a wide and shining canal. And something great and brilliantly coloured
  flew across the picture. But the first time Mr. Cave saw these pictures he
  saw only in flashes, his hands shook, his head moved, the vision came and
  went, and grew foggy and indistinct. And at first he had the greatest
  difficulty in finding the picture again once the direction of it was
  lost.</p>

  <p>His next clear vision, which came about a week after the first, the
  interval having yielded nothing but tantalising glimpses and some useful
  experience, showed him the view down the length of the valley. The view was
  different, but he had a curious persuasion, which his subsequent observations
  abundantly confirmed, that he was regarding this strange world from exactly
  the same spot, although he was looking in a different direction. The long
  facade of the great building, whose roof he had looked down upon before, was
  now receding in perspective. He recognised the roof. In the front of the
  facade was a terrace of massive proportions and extraordinary length, and
  down the middle of the terrace, at certain intervals, stood huge but very
  graceful masts, bearing small shiny objects which reflected the setting sun.
  The import of these small objects did not occur to Mr. Cave until some time
  after, as he was describing the scene to Mr. Wace. The terrace overhung a
  thicket of the most luxuriant and graceful vegetation, and beyond this was a
  wide grassy lawn on which certain broad creatures, in form like beetles but
  enormously larger, reposed. Beyond this again was a richly decorated causeway
  of pinkish stone; and beyond that, and lined with dense red weeds, and
  passing up the valley exactly parallel with the distant cliffs, was a broad
  and mirror-like expanse of water. The air seemed full of squadrons of great
  birds, manoeuvring in stately curves; and across the river was a multitude of
  splendid buildings, richly coloured and glittering with metallic tracery and
  facets, among a forest of moss-like and lichenous trees. And suddenly
  something flapped repeatedly across the vision, like the fluttering of a
  jewelled fan or the beating of a wing, and a face, or rather the upper part
  of a face with very large eyes, came as it were close to his own and as if on
  the other side of the crystal. Mr. Cave was so startled and so impressed by
  the absolute reality of these eyes, that he drew his head back from the
  crystal to look behind it. He had become so absorbed in watching that he was
  quite surprised to find himself in the cool darkness of his little shop, with
  its familiar odour of methyl, mustiness, and decay. And as he blinked about
  him, the glowing crystal faded, and went out.</p>

  <p>Such were the first general impressions of Mr. Cave. The story is
  curiously direct and circumstantial. From the outset, when the valley first
  flashed momentarily on his senses, his imagination was strangely affected,
  and as he began to appreciate the details of the scene he saw, his wonder
  rose to the point of a passion. He went about his business listless and
  distraught, thinking only of the time when he should be able to return to his
  watching. And then a few weeks after his first sight of the valley came the
  two customers, the stress and excitement of their offer, and the narrow
  escape of the crystal from sale, as I have already told.</p>

  <p>Now, while the thing was Mr. Cave's secret, it remained a mere wonder, a
  thing to creep to covertly and peep at, as a child might peep upon a
  forbidden garden. But Mr. Wace has, for a young scientific investigator, a
  particularly lucid and consecutive habit of mind. Directly the crystal and
  its story came to him, and he had satisfied himself, by seeing the
  phosphorescence with his own eyes, that there really was a certain evidence
  for Mr. Cave's statements, he proceeded to develop the matter systematically.
  Mr. Cave was only too eager to come and feast his eyes on this wonderland he
  saw, and he came every night from half-past eight until half-past ten, and
  sometimes, in Mr. Wace's absence, during the day. On Sunday afternoons, also
  he came. From the outset Mr. Wace made copious notes, and it was due to his
  scientific method that the relation between the direction from which the
  initiating ray entered the crystal and the orientation of the picture were
  proved. And by covering the crystal in a box perforated only with a small
  aperture to admit the exciting ray, and by substituting black holland for his
  buff blinds, he greatly improved the conditions of the observations; so that
  in a little while they were able to survey the valley in any direction they
  desired.</p>

  <p>So having cleared the way, we may give a brief account of this visionary
  world within the crystal. The things were in all cases seen by Mr. Cave, and
  the method of working was invariably for him to watch the crystal and report
  what he saw, while Mr. Wace (who as a science student had learnt the trick of
  writing in the dark) wrote a brief note of his report. When the crystal
  faded, it was put into its box in the proper position and the electric light
  turned on. Mr. Wace asked questions, and suggested observations to clear up
  difficult points. Nothing, indeed, could have been less visionary and more
  matter-of-fact.</p>

  <p>The attention of Mr. Cave had been speedily directed to the bird-like
  creatures he had seen so abundantly present in each of his earlier visions.
  His first impression was soon corrected, and he considered for a time that
  they might represent a diurnal species of bat. Then he thought, grotesquely
  enough, that they might be cherubs. Their heads were round, and curiously
  human, and it was the eyes of one of them that had so startled him on his
  second observation. They had broad, silvery wings, not feathered, but
  glistening almost as brilliantly as new-killed fish and with the same subtle
  play of colour, and these wings were not built on the plan of a bird-wing or
  bat, Mr. Wace learned, but supported by curved ribs radiating from the body.
  (A sort of butterfly wing with curved ribs seems best to express their
  appearance.) The body was small, but fitted with two bunches of prehensile
  organs, like long tentacles, immediately under the mouth. Incredible as it
  appeared to Mr. Wace, the persuasion at last became irresistible, that it was
  these creatures which owned the great quasi-human buildings and the
  magnificent garden that made the broad valley so splendid. And Mr. Cave
  perceived that the buildings, with other peculiarities, had no doors, but
  that the great circular windows, which opened freely, gave the creatures
  egress and entrance. They would alight upon their tentacles, fold their wings
  to a smallness almost rod-like, and hop into the interior. But among them was
  a multitude of smaller-winged creatures, like great dragon-flies and moths
  and flying beetles, and across the greensward brilliantly-coloured gigantic
  ground-beetles crawled lazily to and fro. Moreover, on the causeways and
  terraces, large-headed creatures similar to the greater winged flies, but
  wingless, were visible, hopping busily upon their hand-like tangle of
  tentacles.</p>

  <p>Allusion has already been made to the glittering objects upon masts that
  stood upon the terrace of the nearer building. It dawned upon Mr. Cave, after
  regarding one of these masts very fixedly on one particularly vivid day, that
  the glittering object there was a crystal exactly like that into which he
  peered. And a still more careful scrutiny convinced him that each one in a
  vista of nearly twenty carried a similar object.</p>

  <p>Occasionally one of the large flying creatures would flutter up to one,
  and folding its wings and coiling a number of its tentacles about the mast,
  would regard the crystal fixedly for a space&mdash;, sometimes for as long as
  fifteen minutes. And a series of observations, made at the suggestion of Mr.
  Wace, convinced both watchers that, so far as this visionary world was
  concerned, the crystal into which they peered actually stood at the summit of
  the end-most mast on the terrace, and that on one occasion at least one of
  these inhabitants of this other world had looked into Mr. Cave's face while
  he was making these observations.</p>

  <p>So much for the essential facts of this very singular story. Unless we
  dismiss it all as the ingenious fabrication of Mr. Wace, we have to believe
  one of two things: either that Mr. Cave's crystal was in two worlds at once,
  and that, while it was carried about in one, it remained stationary in the
  other, which seems altogether absurd; or else that it had some peculiar
  relation of sympathy with another and exactly similar crystal in this other
  world, so that what was seen in the interior of the one in this world, was
  under suitable conditions, visible to an observer in the corresponding
  crystal in the other world; and vice versa. At present indeed, we do not know
  of any way in which two crystals could so come en rapport, but nowadays we
  know enough to understand that the thing is not altogether impossible. This
  view of the crystals as en rapport was the supposition that occurred to Mr.
  Wace, and to me at least it seems extremely plausible...</p>

  <p>And where was this other world? On this also, the alert intelligence of
  Mr. Wace speedily threw light. After sunset, the sky darkened
  rapidly&mdash;there was a very brief twilight interval indeed&mdash;and the
  stars shone out. They were recognisably the same as those we see, arranged in
  the same constellations. Mr. Cave recognised the Bear, the Pleiades,
  Aldebaran, and Sirius: so that the other world must be somewhere in the solar
  system, and at the utmost, only a few hundreds of millions of miles from our
  own. Following up this clue, Mr. Wace learned that the midnight sky was a
  darker blue even than our midwinter sky, and that the sun seemed a little
  smaller. And there were two small moons! "Like our moon but smaller, and
  quite differently marked" one of which moved so rapidly that its motion was
  clearly visible as one regarded it. These moons were never high in the sky,
  but vanished as they rose: that is, every time they revolved they were
  eclipsed because they were so near their primary planet. And all this answers
  quite completely although, Mr. Cave did not know it, to what must be the
  condition of things on Mars.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it seems an exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering into
  this crystal Mr. Cave did actually see the planet Mars and its inhabitants.
  And if that be the case, then the evening star that shone so brilliantly in
  the sky of that distant vision, was neither more nor less than our own
  familiar earth.</p>

  <p>For a time the Martians&mdash;if they were Martians&mdash;do not seem to
  have known of Mr. Cave's inspection. Once or twice one would come to peer,
  and go away very shortly to some other mast, as though the vision was
  unsatisfactory. During this time Mr. Cave was able to watch the proceedings
  of these winged people without being disturbed by their attentions, and
  although his report is necessarily vague and fragmentary, it is nevertheless
  very suggestive. Imagine the impression of humanity a Martian observer would
  get who, after a difficult process of preparation and with considerable
  fatigue to the eyes, was able to peer at London from the steeple of St.
  Martin's Church for stretches, at longest, of four minutes at a time. Mr.
  Cave was unable to ascertain if the winged Martians were the same as the
  Martians who hopped about the causeways and terraces, and if the latter could
  put on wings at will. He several times saw certain clumsy bipeds, dimly
  suggestive of apes, white and partially translucent, feeding among certain of
  the lichenous trees, and once some of these fled before one of the hopping,
  round-headed Martians. The latter caught one in its tentacles, and then the
  picture faded suddenly and left Mr. Cave most tantalisingly in the dark. On
  another occasion a vast thing, that Mr. Cave thought at first was some
  gigantic insect, appeared advancing along the causeway beside the canal with
  extraordinary rapidity. As this drew nearer Mr. Cave perceived that it was a
  mechanism of shining metals and of extraordinary complexity. And then, when
  he looked again, it had passed out of sight.</p>

  <p>After a time Mr. Wace aspired to attract the attention of the Martians,
  and the next time that the strange eyes of one of them appeared close to the
  crystal Mr. Cave cried out and sprang away, and they immediately turned on
  the light and began to gesticulate in a manner suggestive of signalling. But
  when at last Mr. Cave examined the crystal again the Martian had
  departed.</p>

  <p>Thus far these observations had progressed in early November, and then Mr.
  Cave, feeling that the suspicions of his family about the crystal were
  allayed, began to take it to and fro with him in order that, as occasion
  arose in the daytime or night, he might comfort himself with what was fast
  becoming the most real thing in his existence.</p>

  <p>In December Mr. Wace's work in connection with a forthcoming examination
  became heavy, the sittings were reluctantly suspended for a week, and for ten
  or eleven days&mdash;he is not quite sure which&mdash;he saw nothing of Cave.
  He then grew anxious to resume these investigations, and the stress of his
  seasonal labours being abated, he went down to Seven Dials. At the corner he
  noticed a shutter before a bird fancier's window, and then another at a
  cobbler's. Mr. Cave's shop was closed.</p>

  <p>He rapped and the door was opened by the step-son in black. He at once
  called Mrs. Cave, who was, Mr. Wace could not but observe, in cheap but ample
  widow's weeds of the most imposing pattern. Without any very great surprise
  Mr. Wace learnt that Cave was dead and already buried. She was in tears, and
  her voice was a little thick. She had just returned from Highgate. Her mind
  seemed occupied with her own prospects and the honourable details of the
  obsequies, but Mr. Wace was at last able to learn the particulars of Cave's
  death. He had been found dead in his shop in the early morning, the day after
  his last visit to Mr. Wace, and the crystal had been clasped in his
  stone-cold hands. His face was smiling, said Mrs. Cave, and the velvet cloth
  from the minerals lay on the floor at his feet. He must have been dead five
  or six hours when he was found.</p>

  <p>This came as a great shock to Wace, and he began to reproach himself
  bitterly for having neglected the plain symptoms of the old man's ill-health.
  But his chief thought was of the crystal. He approached that topic in a
  gingerly manner, because he knew Mrs. Cave's peculiarities. He was
  dumbfounded to learn that it was sold.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Cave's first impulse, directly Cave's body had been taken upstairs,
  had been to write to the mad clergyman who had offered five pounds for the
  crystal, informing him of its recovery; but after a violent hunt in which her
  daughter joined her, they were convinced of the loss of his address. As they
  were without the means required to mourn and bury Cave in the elaborate style
  the dignity of an old Seven Dials inhabitant demands, they had appealed to a
  friendly fellow-tradesman in Great Portland Street. He had very kindly taken
  over a portion of the stock at a valuation. The valuation was his own and the
  crystal egg was included in one of the lots. Mr. Wace, after a few suitable
  consolatory observations, a little off-handedly proffered perhaps, hurried at
  once to Great Portland Street. But there he learned that the crystal egg had
  already been sold to a tall, dark man in grey. And there the material facts
  in this curious, and to me at least very suggestive, story come abruptly to
  an end. The Great Portland Street dealer did not know who the tall dark man
  in grey was, nor had he observed him with sufficient attention to describe
  him minutely. He did not even know which way this person had gone after
  leaving the shop. For a time Mr. Wace remained in the shop, trying the
  dealer's patience with hopeless questions, venting his own exasperation. And
  at last, realising abruptly that the whole thing had passed out of his hands,
  had vanished like a vision of the night, he returned to his own rooms, a
  little astonished to find the notes he had made still tangible and visible
  upon his untidy table.</p>

  <p>His annoyance and disappointment were naturally very great. He made a
  second call (equally ineffectual) upon the Great Portland Street dealer, and
  he resorted to advertisements in such periodicals as were likely to come into
  the hands of a bric-a-brac collector. He also wrote letters to 'The Daily
  Chronicle' and 'Nature', but both those periodicals, suspecting a hoax, asked
  him to reconsider his action before they printed, and he was advised that
  such a strange story, unfortunately so bare of supporting evidence, might
  imperil his reputation as an investigator. Moreover, the calls of his proper
  work were urgent. So that after a month or so, save for an occasional
  reminder to certain dealers, he had reluctantly to abandon the quest for the
  crystal egg, and from that day to this it remains undiscovered. Occasionally
  however, he tells me, and I can quite believe him, he has bursts of zeal, in
  which he abandons his more urgent occupation and resumes the search.</p>

  <p>Whether or not it will remain lost for ever, with the material and origin
  of it, are things equally speculative at the present time. If the present
  purchaser is a collector, one would have expected the enquiries of Mr. Wace
  to have readied him through the dealers. He has been able to discover Mr.
  Cave's clergyman and "Oriental&mdash;" no other than the Rev. James Parker
  and the young Prince of Bosso-Kuni in Java. I am obliged to them for certain
  particulars. The object of the Prince was simply curiosity&mdash;and
  extravagance. He was so eager to buy, because Cave was so oddly reluctant to
  sell. It is just as possible that the buyer in the second instance was simply
  a casual purchaser and not a collector at all, and the crystal egg, for all I
  know, may at the present moment be within a mile of me, decorating a drawing-
  room or serving as a paper-weight&mdash;its remarkable functions all unknown.
  Indeed, it is partly with the idea of such a possibility that I have thrown
  this narrative into a form that will give it a chance of being read by the
  ordinary consumer of fiction.</p>

  <p>My own ideas in the matter are practically identical with those of Mr.
  Wace. I believe the crystal on the mast in Mars and the crystal egg of Mr.
  Cave's to be in some physical, but at present quite inexplicable, way en
  rapport, and we both believe further that the terrestrial crystal must have
  been&mdash;possibly at some remote date&mdash;sent hither from that planet,
  in order to give the Martians a near view of our affairs. Possibly the
  fellows to the crystals in the other masts are also on our globe. No theory
  of hallucination suffices for the facts.</p>

     name="story38">A STORY OF THE STONE AGE&mdash;<br>
  1. UGH-LOMI AND UYA</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Idler</i>, May 1897</h3>

  <p>This story is of a time beyond the memory of man, before the beginning of
  history, before the beginning of speech almost, when men still eked out their
  scarce words by gestures, and talked together as the animals do, by the
  passing of simple thoughts from mind to mind&mdash;being themselves indeed
  still of the brotherhood of the beasts. Of a time when one might have walked
  dryshod from France (as we call it now) to England, and when a broad and
  sluggish Thames flowed through its marshes to meet its father Rhine, flowing
  through a wide and level country that is under water in these latter days,
  and which we know by the name of the North Sea. In that remote age the valley
  which runs along the foot of the Downs did not exist, and the south of Surrey
  was a range of hills, fir-clad on the middle slopes, and snow-capped the
  better part of the year. The cores its summits still remain as Leith Hill,
  and Pitch Hill, and Hindhead. On the lower slopes of the range below the
  grassy spaces where the wild horses grazed were forests of yew and
  sweet-chestnut and elm, and the thickets and dark places hid the grizzly bear
  and the hy&aelig;na, and the grey apes clambered through the branches. And
  still lower amidst the woodland and marsh and open grass along the Wey did
  this little drama play itself out to the end that I have to tell. Fifty
  thousand years ago it was, fifty thousand years&mdash;if the estimates of the
  geologists are correct.</p>

  <p>And in those days the spring-time was as joyful as it is now, and sent the
  blood coursing in just the same fashion. The afternoon sky was blue with
  piled white clouds sailing through it, and the south-west wind came like a
  soft caress. The new-come swallows drove to and fro. The reaches of the river
  were spangled with white ranunculus, the marshy places were starred with
  lady's-smock and lit with marsh-mallow wherever the regiments of the sedges
  lowered their swords, and the northward moving hippopotami, shiny black
  monsters, sporting clumsily, came floundering and blundering through it all,
  rejoicing dimly and possessed with one clear idea, to splash the river
  muddy.</p>

  <p>Farther up the river and well in sight of the hippopotami, a number of
  little buff-coloured animals dabbled in the water. There was no fear, no
  rivalry, and no enmity between them and the hippopotami. As the great bulks
  came crashing through the reeds and smashed the mirror of the water into
  silvery splashes, these little creatures shouted and gesticulated with glee.
  It was the surest sign of high spring. "Boloo!" they cried. "Baayah. Boloo!"
  They were the children of the men folk, the smoke of whose encampment rose
  from the knoll at the river's bend. Wild-eyed youngsters they were, with
  matted hair and little broad-nosed impish faces, covered (as some children
  are covered even nowadays) with a delicate down of hair. They were narrow in
  the loins and long in the arms. And their ears had no lobes, and had little
  pointed tips, a thing that still, in rare instances, survives. Stark-naked
  vivid little gipsies, as active as monkeys and as full of chatter, though a
  little wanting in words.</p>

  <p>Their elders were hidden from the wallowing hippopotami by the crest of
  the knoll. The human squatting-place was a trampled area among the dead brown
  fronds of Royal Fern, through which the crosiers of this year's growth were
  unrolling to tie light and warmth. The fire was a smouldering heap of char,
  light grey and black, replenished by the old women from time to time with
  brown leaves. Most of the men were asleep&mdash;they slept sitting with their
  foreheads on their knees. They had killed that morning a good quarry, enough
  for all, a deer that had been wounded in a rutting fight; so that there had
  been no quarrelling among them, and some of the women were still gnawing the
  bones that lay scattered about. Others were making a heap of leaves and
  sticks to feed Brother Fire when the darkness came again, that he might grow
  strong and tall therewith, and guard them against the beasts. And two were
  piling flints that they brought, an armful at a time, from the bend of the
  river where the children were at play.</p>

  <p>None of these buff-skinned savages were clothed, but some wore about their
  hips rude girdles of adder-skin or crackling undressed hide, from which
  depended little bags, not made, but torn from the paws of beasts, and
  carrying the rudely-dressed flints that were men's chief weapons and tools.
  And one woman, the mate of Uya the Cunning Man, wore a wonderful necklace of
  perforated fossils&mdash;that others had worn before her. Beside some of the
  sleeping men lay the big antlers of the elk, with the tines chipped to sharp
  edges, and long sticks, hacked at the ends with flints into sharp points.
  There was little else save these things and the smouldering fire to mark
  these human beings off from the wild animals that ranged the country. But Uya
  the Cunning did not sleep, but sat with a bone in his hand and scraped busily
  thereon with a flint, a thing no animal would do. He was the oldest man in
  the tribe, beetle-browed, prognathous, lank-armed; he had a beard and his
  cheeks were hairy, and his chest and arms were black with thick hair. And by
  virtue both of his strength and cunning he was master of the tribe, and his
  share was always the most and the best.</p>

  <p>Eudena had hidden herself among the alders, because she was afraid of Uya.
  She was still a girl, and her eyes were bright and her smile pleasant to see.
  He had given her a piece of the liver, a man's piece, and a wonderful treat
  for a girl to get; but as she took it the other woman with the necklace had
  looked at her, an evil glance, and Ugh-lomi had made a noise in his throat.
  At that, Uya had looked at him long and steadfastly, and Ugh-lomi's face had
  fallen. And then Uya had looked at her. She was frightened and she had stolen
  away, while the feeding was still going on, and Uya was busy with the marrow
  of a bone. Afterwards he had wandered about as if looking for her. And now
  she crouched among the alders, wondering mightily what Uya might be doing
  with the flint and the bone. And Ugh-lomi was not to be seen.</p>

  <p>Presently a squirrel came leaping through the alders, and she lay so quiet
  the little man was within six feet of her before he saw her. Whereupon he
  dashed up a stem in a hurry and began to chatter and scold her. "What are you
  doing here," he asked, "away from the other men beasts?" "Peace," said
  Eudena, but he only chattered more, and then she began to break off the
  little black cones to throw at him. He dodged and defied her, and she grew
  excited and rose up to throw better, and then she saw Uya coming down the
  knoll. He had seen the movement of her pale arm amidst the thicket&mdash;he
  was very keen-eyed.</p>

  <p>At that she forgot the squirrel and set off through the alders and reeds
  as fast as she could go. She did not care where she went so long as she
  escaped Uya. She splashed nearly knee-deep through a swampy place, and saw in
  front of her a slope of ferns&mdash;growing more slender and greener as they
  passed up out of the light into the shade of the young chestnut trees. She
  was soon amidst the trees&mdash;she was very fleet of foot, and she ran on
  and on, until the forest was old and the trees great, and the vines about
  their stems where the light came were thick as young trees, and the ropes of
  ivy stout and tight. On she went, and she doubled and doubled again, and then
  at last lay down amidst some ferns in a hollow place near a thicket, and
  listened with her heart beating in her ears.</p>

  <p>She heard footsteps presently rustling among the dead leaves, far off, and
  they died away and everything was still again, except the scandalising of the
  midges&mdash;for the evening was drawing on&mdash;and the incessant whisper
  of the leaves. She laughed silently to think the cunning Uya should go by
  her. She was not frightened. Sometimes, playing with the other girls and
  lads, she had fled into the wood, though never so far as this. It was
  pleasant to be hidden and alone.</p>

  <p>She lay a long time there, glad of her escape, and then she sat up
  listening.</p>

  <p>It was a rapid pattering growing louder and coming towards her, and in a
  little while she could hear grunting noises and the snapping of twigs. It was
  a drove of the lean grisly wild swine. She turned about her, for a boar is an
  ill fellow to pass too closely, on account of the sideway slash of his tusks,
  and she made off slantingly through the trees. But the patter came nearer,
  they were not feeding as they wandered, but going fast&mdash;or else they
  would not overtake her&mdash;and she caught the limb of a tree, swung on to
  it, and ran up the stem with something of the agility of a monkey.</p>

  <p>Down below the sharp bristling backs of the swine were already passing
  when she looked down. And she knew the short, sharp grunts they made meant
  fear. What were they afraid of? A man? They were in a great hurry for just a
  man.</p>

  <p>And then, so suddenly it made her grip on the branch tighten
  involuntarily, a fawn started in the brake and rushed after the swine.
  Something else went by, low and grey, with a long body; she did not know what
  it was, indeed she saw it only momentarily through the interstices of the
  young leaves; and then there came a pause.</p>

  <p>She remained stiff and expectant, rigid almost as though she was a part of
  the tree she clung to, peering down.</p>

  <p>Then, far away among the trees, clear for a moment, then hidden, then
  visible knee-deep in ferns, then gone again, ran a man. She knew it was young
  Ugh-lomi by the fair colour of his hair, and there was red upon his face.
  Somehow his frantic flight and that scarlet mark made her feel sick. And then
  nearer, running heavily and breathing hard, came another man also running. At
  first she could not see, and then she saw, foreshortened and clear to her,
  Uya, running with great strides and his eyes staring. He was not going after
  Ugh-lomi. His face was white. It was Uya&mdash;afraid! He passed, and was
  still loud hearing, when something else, something large and with grizzled
  fur, swinging along with soft swift strides, came rushing in pursuit of
  him.</p>

  <p>Eudena suddenly became rigid, ceased to breathe, her clutch convulsive,
  and her eyes starting.</p>

  <p>She had never seen the thing before she did not even see him clearly now,
  but, she knew at once it was the Terror of the Woodshade. His name was a
  legend, the children would frighten one another, frighten even themselves
  with his name and run screaming to the squatting place. No man had ever
  killed any of his kind. Even the mighty mammoth feared his Anger. It was the
  grizzly bear, the lord of world as the world went then.</p>

  <p>As he ran he made a continuous growling rumble. "Men in my very lair!
  Fighting and blood. At the very mouth of my lair. Men, men, men. Fighting and
  blood." For he was the lord of the wood and of the caves.</p>

  <p>Long after he had passed she remained, a girl of stone, staring down
  through the branches. All her power of action had gone from her. She gripped
  by instinct with hands and knees and feet. It was some time before she could
  think, and then only one thing was clear in her mind, that the Terror was
  between her and the tribe&mdash;that it would be impossible to descend.</p>

  <p>Presently when her fear was a little abated she clambered into a more
  comfortable position, where a great branch forked. The trees rose about her,
  so that she could see nothing of Brother Fire, who is black by day. Birds
  began to stir about her, and things that had gone into hiding for fear of her
  movements crept out...</p>

  <p>After a time the blue overhead deepened, and the taller branches flamed
  out at the touch of the sunset. High overhead the rooks, who were wiser than
  men, went cawing home to their squatting-places among the elms. Looking down,
  things were clearer and darker. Eudena thought of going back to the
  squatting-place; she let herself down some way, and then the fear of the
  Terror of the Woodshade came again. While she hesitated a rabbit squealed
  dismally, and she dared not descend farther.</p>

  <p>The shadows gathered, and the deeps of the forest began stirring. Eudena
  went up the tree again to be nearer the light. Down below the shadows came
  out of their hiding-places and walked abroad. Overhead the blue deepened. A
  dreadful stillness came, and then the leaves began whispering. Eudena
  shivered and thought of Brother Fire.</p>

  <p>The shadows now were gathering in the trees, they sat on the branches and
  watched her. Branches and leaves were turned to ominous, quiet black shapes
  that would spring on her if she stirred. Then the white owl, flitting
  silently, came ghostly through the shades. Darker grew the world and darker,
  until the leaves and twigs against the sky were black, and the ground was
  hidden.</p>

  <p>She remained there all night, an age-long vigil, straining her ears for
  the things that went on below in the darkness, and keeping motionless lest
  some stealthy beast should discover her. Man in those days was never alone in
  the dark, save for such rare accidents as this. Age after age he had learnt
  the lesson of its terror&mdash;a lesson we poor children of his have nowadays
  painfully to unlearn. Eudena, though in age a woman, was in heart like a
  little child. She kept as still, poor little animal, as a hare before it is
  started.</p>

  <p>The stars gathered and watched her&mdash;her one grain of comfort. In one
  bright one she fancied there was something like Ugh-lomi. Then she fancied it
  was Ugh-lomi. And near him, red and duller, was Uya, and as the night passed
  Ugh-lomi fled before him up the sky.</p>

  <p>She tried to see Brother Fire, who guarded the squatting-place from
  beasts, but he was not in sight. And far away she heard the mammoths
  trumpeting as they went down to the drinking-place, and once some huge bulk
  with heavy paces hurried along, making a noise like a calf, but what it was
  she could not see. But she thought from the voice it was Yaaa the rhinoceros,
  who stabs with his nose, goes always alone, and rages without cause.</p>

  <p>At last the little stars began to hide, and then the larger ones. It was
  like all the animals vanishing before the Terror. The Sun was coming, lord of
  the sky, as the grizzly was lord of the forest. Eudena wondered what would
  happen if one star stayed behind. And then the sky paled to the dawn.</p>

  <p>When the daylight came the fear of lurking things passed, and she could
  descend. She was stiff, but not so stiff as you would have been, dear young
  lady (by virtue of your upbringing), and as she had not been trained to eat
  at least once in three hours, but instead had often fasted three days, she
  did not feel uncomfortably hungry. She crept down the tree very cautiously,
  and went her way stealthily through the wood, and not a squirrel sprang or
  deer started but the terror of the grizzly bear froze her marrow.</p>

  <p>Her desire was now to find her people again. Her dread of Uya the Cunning
  was consumed by a greater dread of loneliness. But she had lost her
  direction. She had run heedlessly overnight, and she could not tell whether
  the squatting-place was sunward or where it lay. Ever and again she stopped
  and listened, and at last, very far away, she heard a measured chinking. It
  was so faint even in the morning stillness that she could tell it must be far
  away. But she knew the sound was that of a man sharpening a flint.</p>

  <p>Presently the trees began to thin out, and then came a regiment of nettles
  barring the way. She turned aside, and then she came to a fallen tree that
  she knew, with a noise of bees about it. And so presently she was in sight of
  the knoll, very far off, and the river under it, and the children and the
  hippopotami just as they had been yesterday, and the thin spire of smoke
  swaying in the morning breeze. Far away by the river was the cluster of
  alders where she had hidden. And at the sight of that the fear of Uya
  returned, and she crept into a thicket of bracken, out of which a rabbit
  scuttled, and lay awhile to watch the squatting-place.</p>

  <p>The men were mostly out of sight, saving Wau, the flint-chipper; and at
  that she felt safer. They were away hunting&mdash;food, no doubt. Some of the
  women, too, were down in the stream, stooping intent, seeking mussels,
  crayfish, and water-snails, and at the sight of their occupation Eudena felt
  hungry. She rose, and ran through the fern, designing to join them. As she
  went she heard a voice among the bracken calling softly. She stopped. Then
  suddenly she heard a rustle behind her, and turning, saw Ugh-lomi rising out
  of the fern. There were streaks of brown blood and dirt on his face, and his
  eyes were fierce, and the white stone of Uya, the white Fire Stone, that none
  but Uya dared to touch, was in his hand. In a stride he was beside her and
  gripped her arm. He swung her about, and thrust her before him towards the
  woods. "Uya," he said, and waved his arms about. She heard a cry, looked
  back, and saw all the women standing up, and two wading out of the stream.
  Then came a nearer howling, and the old woman with the beard, who watched the
  fire on the knoll, was waving her arms, and Wau, the man who had been
  chipping the flint, was getting to his feet. The little children too were
  hurrying and shouting.</p>

  <p>"Come!" said Ugh-lomi, and dragged her by the arm.</p>

  <p>She still did not understand.</p>

  <p>"Uya," said Ugh-lomi, and she glanced back again at the screaming curve of
  figures, and dimly understood.</p>

  <p>Wau and all the women and children were coming towards them, a scattered
  array of buff shock-headed figures, howling, leaping, and crying. Over the
  knoll two youths hurried. Down among the ferns to the right came a man,
  heading them off from the wood. Ugh-lomi left her arm, and the two began
  running side by side, leaping the bracken and stepping clear and wide.
  Eudena, knowing her fleetness and the fleetness of Ugh-lomi, laughed aloud at
  the unequal chase. They were an exceptionally straight-limbed couple for
  those days.</p>

  <p>They soon cleared the open, and drew near the wood of chestnut trees
  again&mdash;neither afraid now because neither was alone. They slackened
  their pace, already not excessive. And suddenly Eudena cried and swerved
  aside, pointing, and looking up through the tree-stems. Ugh-lomi saw the feet
  and legs of men running towards him. Eudena was already running off at a
  tangent. And as he too turned to follow her they heard the voice of Uya
  coming through the trees, and roaring out his rage at them.</p>

  <p>Then terror came in their hearts, not the terror that numbs, but the
  terror that makes one silent and swift. They were cut off now on two sides.
  They were in a sort of corner of pursuit. On the right hand, and near by
  them, came the men swift and heavy, with bearded Uya, antler in hand, leading
  them; and on the left, scattered as one scatters corn, yellow dashes among
  the fern and grass, ran Wau and the women; and even the little children from
  the shallow had joined the chase. The two parties converged upon them. Off
  they went, with Eudena ahead.</p>

  <p>They knew there was no mercy for them. There was no hunting so sweet to
  these ancient men as the hunting of men. Once the fierce passion of the chase
  was lit, the feeble beginnings of humanity in them were thrown to the winds.
  And Uya in the night had marked Ugh-lomi with the death word. Ugh-lomi was
  the day's quarry.</p>

  <p>They ran straight&mdash;it was their only chance&mdash;taking whatever
  ground came in the way&mdash;a spread of stinging nettles, an open glade, a
  clump of grass out of which a hy&aelig;na fled snarling. Then woods again,
  long stretches of shady leaf-mould and moss under the green trunks. Then a
  stiff slope, tree-clad, and long vistas of trees, a glade, a succulent green
  area of black mud, a wide open space again, and then a clump of lacerating
  brambles, with beast tracks through it. Behind them the chase trailed out and
  scattered, with Uya ever at their heels. Eudena kept the first place, running
  light and with her breath easy, for Ugh-lomi carried the Fire Stone in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>It told on his pace&mdash;not at first, but after a time. His footsteps
  behind her suddenly grew remote. Glancing over her shoulder as they crossed
  another open space, Eudena saw that Ugh-lomi was many yards behind her, and
  Uya close upon him, with antler already raised in the air to strike him down.
  Wau and the others were but just emerging from the shadow of the woods.</p>

  <p>Seeing Ugh-lomi in peril, Eudena ran sideways, looking back, threw up her
  arms and cried aloud, just as the antler flew. And young Ugh-lomi, expecting
  this and understanding her cry, ducked his head, so that the missile merely
  struck his scalp lightly, making but a trivial wound, and flew over him. He
  turned forthwith, the quartzite Fire Stone in both hands, and hurled it
  straight at Uya's body as he ran loose from the throw. Uya shouted, but could
  not dodge it. It took him under the ribs, heavy and flat, and he reeled and
  went down without a cry. Ugh-lomi caught up the antler&mdash;one tine of, it
  was tipped with his own blood&mdash;and came running on again with a red
  trickle just coming out of his hair.</p>

  <p>Uya rolled over twice, and lay a moment before he got up, and then he did
  not run fast. The colour of his face was changed. Wau overtook him, and then
  others, and he coughed and laboured in his breath. But he kept on.</p>

  <p>At last the two fugitives gained the bank of the river, where the stream
  ran deep and narrow, and they still had fifty yards in hand of Wau, the
  foremost pursuer, the man who made the smiting stones. He carried one, a
  large flint, the shape of an oyster and double the size, chipped to a chisel
  edge, in either hand.</p>

  <p>They sprang down the steep bank into the stream, rushed through the water,
  swam the deep current in two or three strokes, and came out wading again,
  dripping and refreshed, to clamber up the farther bank. It was undermined,
  and with willows growing thickly therefrom, so that it needed clambering. And
  while Eudena was still among the silvery branches and Ugh-lomi still in the
  water&mdash;for the antler had encumbered him&mdash;Wau came up against the
  sky on the opposite bank, and the smiting stone, thrown cunningly, took the
  side of Eudena's knee. She struggled to the top and fell.</p>

  <p>They heard the pursuers shout to one another, and Ugh-lomi, climbing to
  her and moving jerkily to mar Wau's aim, felt the second smiting stone graze
  his ear, and heard the water splashing below him.</p>

  <p>Then it was Ugh-lomi, the stripling, proved himself to have come to man's
  estate. For running on, he found Eudena fell behind, limping, and at that he
  turned, and crying savagely and with a face terrible with sudden wrath and
  trickling blood, ran swiftly past her back to the bank, whirling the antler
  round his head. And Eudena kept on, running stoutly still, though she must
  needs limp at every step, and the pain was already sharp.</p>

  <p>So that Wau, rising over the edge and clutching the straight willow
  branches, saw Ugh-lomi towering over him, gigantic against the blue; saw his
  whole body swing round, and the grip of his hands upon the antler. The edge
  of the antler came sweeping through the air, and he saw no more. The water
  under the osiers whirled and eddied and went crimson six feet down the
  stream. Uya following, stopped knee-high across the stream, and the man who
  was swimming turned about.</p>

  <p>The other men who trailed after&mdash;they were none of them very mighty
  men (for Uya was more cunning than strong, brooking no sturdy rivals)
  &mdash;slackened momentarily at the sight of Ugh-lomi standing there above
  the willows, bloody and terrible, between them and the halting girl, with the
  huge antler waving in his hand. It seemed as though he had gone into the
  water a youth, and come out of it a man full grown.</p>

  <p>He knew what there was behind him. A broad stretch of grass, and then a
  thicket, and in that Eudena could hide. That was clear in his mind, though
  his thinking powers were too feeble to see what should happen thereafter. Uya
  stood knee-deep, undecided and unarmed. His heavy mouth hung open, showing
  his canine teeth, and he panted heavily. His side was flushed and bruised
  under the hair. The other man beside him carried a sharpened stick. The rest
  of the hunters came up one by one to the top of the bank, hairy, long-armed
  men clutching flints and sticks. Two ran off along the bank down stream, and
  then clambered down to the water, where Wau had come to the surface
  struggling weakly. They gibbered at him without any sane attempt to help, and
  presently he went under again. Two others threatened Ugh-lomi from the
  bank.</p>

  <p>He answered back, shouts, vague insults, gestures. Then Uya, who had been
  standing hesitating, roared with rage, and whirling his fists came plunging
  through the water. His followers came splashing after him.</p>

  <p>Ugh-lomi glanced over his shoulder and found Eudena already vanished into
  the thicket. He would perhaps have waited for Uya, but Uya preferred to spar
  in the water below him until the others were beside him. Human tactics in
  those days, in all serious fighting, were the tactics of the pack. Prey that
  turned at bay they gathered around and rushed. Ugh-lomi felt the rush coming,
  and hurling the antler at Uya, turned about and fled.</p>

  <p>When he halted to look back from the shadow of the thicket, he found only
  three of his pursuers had followed him across the river, and they were going
  back again. Uya, with a bleeding mouth, was on the farther side of the stream
  again, but lower down, and he held his hand to his side. The others were in
  the river dragging something to shore. For a time at least the chase was
  intermitted.</p>

  <p>Ugh-lomi stood watching for a space, and snarled at the sight of Uya. Then
  he turned and plunged into the thicket.</p>

  <p>In a minute, Eudena came hastening to join him, and they went on hand in
  hand. He dimly perceived the pain she suffered from the cut and bruised knee,
  and chose the easier ways. But they went on all that day, mile after mile,
  through wood and thicket, until at last they came to the chalk land, open
  grass with rare woods of beech, and the birch growing near water, and they
  saw the Wealden mountains nearer, and groups of horses grazing together. They
  went circumspectly, keeping always near thicket and cover, for this was a
  strange region&mdash;even its ways were strange. Steadily the ground rose,
  until the chestnut forests spread wide and blue below them, and the Thames
  marshes shone silvery, high and far. They saw no men, for in those days men
  were still only just come into this part of the world, and were moving but
  slowly along the river-ways. Towards evening they came on the river again,
  but now it ran in a gorge, between high cliffs of white chalk that sometimes
  overhung it. Down the cliffs was a scrub of birches and there were many birds
  there. And high up the cliff was a little shelf by a tree, whereon they
  clambered to pass the night.</p>

  <p>They had had scarcely any food; it was not the time of year for berries,
  and they had no time to go aside to snare or waylay. They tramped in a hungry
  weary silence, gnawing at twigs and leaves. But over the surface of the
  cliffs were a multitude of snails, and in a bush were the freshly laid eggs
  of a little bird, and then Ugh-lomi threw at and killed a squirrel in a beech
  tree, so that at last they fed well. Ugh-lomi watched during the night, his
  chin on his knees; and he heard young foxes crying hard by, and the noise of
  mammoths down the gorge, and the hy&aelig;nas yelling and laughing far away.
  It was chilly, but they dared not light a fire. Whenever he dozed, his spirit
  went abroad, and straightway met with the spirit of Uya, and they fought. And
  always Ugh-lomi was paralysed so that he could not smite nor run, and then he
  would awake suddenly. Eudena, too, dreamt evil things of Uya, so that they
  both awoke with the fear of him in their hearts, and by the light of the dawn
  they saw a woolly rhinoceros go blundering down the valley.</p>

  <p>During the day they caressed one another and were glad of the sunshine,
  and Euderia's leg was so stiff she sat on the ledge all day. Ugh-lomi found
  great flints sticking out of the cliff face, greater than any he had seen,
  and he dragged some to the ledge and began chipping, so as to be armed
  against Uya when he came again. And at one he laughed heartily, and Eudena
  laughed, and they threw it about in derision. It had a hole in it. They stuck
  their fingers through it, it was very funny indeed. Then they peeped at one
  another through it. Afterwards, Ugh-lomi got himself a stick, and thrusting
  by chance at this foolish flint, the stick went in and stuck there. He had
  rammed it in too tightly to withdraw it. That was still
  stranger&mdash;scarcely funny, terrible almost, and for a time Ugh-lomi did
  not greatly care to touch the thing. It was as if the flint had bit and held
  with its teeth. But then he got familiar with the odd combination. He swung
  it about, and perceived dimly that the stick with the heavy stone on the end
  struck a better blow than anything he knew. He went to and fro swinging it,
  and striking with it; but later he tired of it and threw it aside. In the
  afternoon he went up over the brow of the white cliff, and lay watching by a
  rabbit-warren until the rabbits came out to play. There were no men
  thereabouts, and the rabbits were heedless. He threw a smiting stone he had
  made and got a kill.</p>

  <p>That night they made a fire from flint sparks and bracken fronds, and
  talked and caressed by it. And in their sleep Uya's spirit came again, and
  suddenly, while Ugh-lomi was trying to fight vainly, the foolish flint on the
  stick came into his hand, and struck Uya with it, and behold! it killed him.
  But afterwards came other dreams of Uya&mdash;for spirits take a lot of
  killing, and he had to be killed again' Then after that the stone would not
  keep on the stick. He awoke tired and rather gloomy, and was sulky all the
  forenoon, in spite of Eudena's kindliness, and instead of hunting he sat
  chipping a sharp edge to the singular flint, and looking strangely at her.
  Then he bound the perforated flint on to the stick with strips of rabbit And
  afterwards he walked up and down the ledge, striking with it, and muttering
  to himself, and thinking of Uya. It felt very fine and heavy in the hand.</p>

  <p>Several days, more than there was any counting in those days, five days,
  it may be, or six, did Ugh-lomi and Eudena stay on that shelf in the gorge of
  the river, and they lost all fear of men, and their fire burnt redly of a
  night. And they were very merry together; there was food every day, sweet
  water, and no enemies. Eudena's knee was well in a couple of days, for those
  ancient savages had quick-healing flesh. Indeed, they were very happy. On one
  of those days, although it has little to do with this story, Ugh-lomi dropped
  a chunk of flint on the cliff. He saw it fall, and go bounding across the
  river bank into the river, and after laughing and thinking it over a little
  he tried another. This smashed a bush of hazel in the most interesting way.
  They spent all the morning dropping stones from the ledge and in the
  afternoon they discovered this new and interesting pastime was also possible
  from the cliff brow. The next day they had forgotten this delight. Or at
  least, it seemed they had forgotten.</p>

  <p>But Uya came in dreams to spoil the paradise. Three nights he came
  fighting Ugh-lomi. In the morning after these dreams Ugh-lomi would walk up
  and down, threatening him and swinging the axe, and at last came the night
  after Ugh-lomi brained the otter, and they had feasted. Uya went too far.
  Ugh-lomi awoke, scowling under his heavy brows, and he took his axe, and
  extending his hand towards Eudena he bade her wait for him upon the ledge.
  Then he clambered down the white declivity, glanced up once from the foot of
  it and flourished his axe, and without looking back again went striding along
  the river bank until the overhanging cliff at the bend hid him.</p>

  <p>Two days and nights did Eudena sit alone by the fire on the ledge waiting,
  and in the night the beasts howled over the cliffs and down the valley, and
  on the cliff over against her the hunched hy&aelig;nas prowled black against
  the sky. But no evil thing came near her save fear. Once, far away, she heard
  the roaring of a lion, following the horses as they came northward over the
  grass lands with the spring. All that time she waited&mdash;the waiting that
  is pain.</p>

  <p>And the third day Ugh-lomi came back, up the river. The plumes of a raven
  were in his hair. The axe was red&mdash;stained, and had long dark hairs upon
  it, and he carried the necklace that had marked the favourite of Uya in his
  hand. He walked in the soft places, giving no heed to his trail. Save a raw
  cut below his jaw there was not a wound upon him. "Uya!" cried Ugh-lomi
  exultant, and Eudena saw it was well. He put the necklace on Eudena, and they
  ate and drank together. And after eating he began to rehearse the whole story
  from the beginning, when Uya had cast his eyes on Eudena, and Uya and
  Ugh-lomi, fighting in the forest, had been chased by the bear, eking out his
  scanty words with abundant pantomime, springing to his feet and whirling the
  stone axe round when it came to the fighting. The last fight was a mighty
  one, stamping and shouting, and once a blow at the fire that sent a torrent
  of sparks up into the night. And Eudena sat red in the light of the fire,
  gloating on him, her face flushed and her eyes shining, and the necklace Uya
  had made about her neck. It was a splendid time, and the stars that look down
  on us looked down on her, our ancestor&mdash;who has been dead now these
  fifty thousand years.</p>

  2. UGH-LOMI AND THE CAVE BEAR</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Idler</i>, June 1897</h3>

  <p>In the days when Eudena and Ugh-lomi fled from the people of Uya towards
  the fir-clad mountains of the Weald, across the forests of sweet chestnutand
  the grass-clad chalkland, and hid themselves at last in the gorge of the
  river between the chalk cliffs, men were few and their squatting-places far
  between. The nearest men to them were those of the tribe, a full day's
  journey down the river, and up the mountains there were none. Man was indeed
  a newcomer to this part of the world in that ancient time, coming slowly
  along the rivers, generation after generation, from one squatting-place to
  another, from the south-westward. And the animals that held the the
  hippopotami and rhinoceri of the river valleys, the horses of the grass
  plains, the deer and swine of the woods, the grey apes in the branches, the
  the uplands, feared him but little&mdash;let alone the mammoths in the
  mountains and the elephants that came through the land in the summer-time out
  of the south. For why should they fear him, with but the rough, chipped
  flints that he had not learnt to haft and which he threw but ill, and the
  poor spear of sharpened wood, as all his weapons against hoof and horn, tooth
  and claw?</p>

  <p>Andoo, the huge cave bear, who lived in the cave up the gorge, had never
  even seen a man in all his wise and respectable life, until midway through
  one night, as he was prowling down the gorge along the cliff edge, he saw the
  glare of Eudena's fire upon the ledge, and Eudena red and shining, and
  Ugh-lomi, with a gigantic shadow mocking him upon the white cliff, going to
  and fro, shaking his mane of hair, and waving the axe of stone&mdash;the
  first axe of stone&mdash;while he chanted of the killing of Uya. The cave
  bear was far up the gorge, and he saw the thing slanting-ways and far off. He
  was so surprised he stood quite still upon the edge, sniffing the novel odour
  of burning bracken, and wondering whether the dawn was coming up in the wrong
  place.</p>

  <p>He was the lord of the rocks and caves, was the cave bear, as his slighter
  brother, the grizzly, was lord of the thick woods below, and as the dappled
  lion&mdash;the lion of those days was dappled&mdash;was lord of the
  thorn-thickets, reed-beds, and open plains. He was the greatest of all meat-
  eaters; he knew no fear, none preyed on him, and none gave him battle; only
  the rhinoceros was beyond his strength. Even the mammoth shunned his country.
  This invasion perplexed him. He noticed these new beasts were shaped like
  monkeys, and sparsely hairy like young pigs. "Monkey and young pig," said the
  cave bear. "It might not be so bad. But that red thing that jumps, and the
  black thing jumping with it yonder! Never in my life have I seen such things
  before."</p>

  <p>He came slowly along the brow of the cliff towards them, stopping thrice
  to sniff and peer, and the reek of the fire grew stronger. A couple of
  hy&aelig;nas also were so intent upon the thing below that Andoo, coming soft
  and easy, was close upon them before they knew of him or he of them. They
  started guiltily and went lurching off. Coming round in a wheel, a hundred
  yards off, they began yelling and calling him names for the start they had
  had. "Ya-ha!" they cried. "Who can't grub his own burrow? Who eats roots like
  a pig?...Ya-ha!" For even in those days the hy&aelig;na's manners were just
  as offensive as they are now.</p>

  <p>"Who answers the hy&aelig;na?" growled Andoo, peering through the midnight
  dimness at them, and then going to look at the cliff edge.</p>

  <p>There was Ugh-lomi still telling his story, and the fire getting low, and
  the scent of the burning hot and strong.</p>

  <p>Andoo stood on the edge of the chalk cliff for some time, shifting his
  vast weight from foot to foot, and swaying his head to and fro, with his
  mouth open, his ears erect and twitching, and the nostrils of his big, black
  muzzle sniffing. He was very curious, was the cave bear, more curious than
  any of the bears that live now, and the flickering fire and the
  incomprehensible movements of the man, let alone the intrusion into his
  indisputable province, stirred him with a sense of strange new happenings. He
  had been after red deer fawn that night, for the cave bear was a
  miscellaneous hunter, but this quite turned him from that enterprise.</p>

  <p>"Ya-ha!" yelled the hy&aelig;nas behind. "Ya-ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Peering through the starlight, Andoo saw there were now three or four
  going to and fro against the grey hillside. "They will hang about me now all
  the night until I kill," said Andoo. "Filth of the world!" And mainly to
  annoy them, he resolved to watch the red flicker in the gorge until the dawn
  came to drive the hy&aelig;na scum home. And after a time they vanished, and
  he heard their voices, like a party of Cockney beanfeasters, away in the
  beech-woods. Then they came slinking near again. Andoo yawned and went on
  along the cliff, and they followed. Then he stopped and went back.</p>

  <p>It was a splendid night, beset with shining constellations, the same
  stars, but not the same constellations we know, for since those days all the
  stars have had time to move into new places. Far away across the open space
  beyond where the heavy-shouldered, lean-bodied hy&aelig;nas blundered and
  howled, was a beech-wood, and the mountain slopes rose beyond, a dim mystery,
  until their snow-capped summits came out white and cold and clear, touched by
  the first rays of the yet unseen moon. It was a vast silence, save when the
  yell of the hy&aelig;nas flung a vanishing discordance across its peace, or
  when from down the hills the trumpeting of the new-come elephants came
  faintly on the faint breeze. And below now, the red flicker had dwindled and
  was steady, and shone a deeper red, and Ugh-lomi had finished his story and
  was preparing to sleep, and Eudena sat and listened to the strange voices of
  unknown beasts, and watched the dark eastern sky growing deeply luminous at
  the advent of the moon. Down below, the river talked to itself, and things
  unseen went to and fro.</p>

  <p>After a time the bear went away, but in an hour he was back again. Then,
  as if struck by a thought, he turned, and went up the gorge... .</p>

  <p>The night passed, and Ugh-lomi slept on. The waning moon rose and lit the
  gaunt white cliff overhead with a light that was pale and vague. The gorge
  remained in a deeper shadow, and seemed all the darker. Then by imperceptible
  degrees the day came stealing in the wake of the moonlight. Eudena's eyes
  wandered to the cliff brow overhead once, and then again. Each time the line
  was sharp and clear against the sky, and yet she had a dim perception of
  something lurking there. The red of the fire grew deeper and deeper, grey
  scales spread upon it, its vertical column of smoke became more and more
  visible, and up and down the gorge things that had been unseen grew clear in
  a colourless illumination. She may have dozed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she started up from her squatting position, erect and alert,
  scrutinising the cliff up and down.</p>

  <p>She made the faintest sound, and Ugh-lomi too, light sleeping like an
  animal, was instantly awake. He caught up his axe and came noiselessly to her
  side.</p>

  <p>The light was still dim, the world now all in black and dark grey, and one
  sickly star still lingered overhead. The ledge they were on was a little
  grassy space, six feet wide, perhaps, and twenty feet long, sloping
  outwardly, and with a handful of St. John's wort growing near the edge. Below
  it the soft, white rock fell away in a steep slope of nearly fifty feet to
  the thick bush of hazel that fringed the river. Down the river this slope
  increased, until some way off a thin grass held its own right up to the crest
  of the cliff. Overhead, forty or fifty feet of rock bulged into the great
  masses characteristic of chalk, but at the end of the ledge a gully, a
  precipitous groove of discoloured chalk, slashed the face of the cliff, and
  gave a footing to a scrubby growth, by which Eudena and Ugh-lomi went up and
  down.</p>

  <p>They stood as noiseless as startled deer, with every sense expectant. For
  a minute they heard nothing, and then came a faint rattling of dust down the
  gully, and the creaking of twigs.</p>

  <p>Ugh-lomi gripped his axe, and went to the edge of the ledge, for the bulge
  of the chalk overhead had hidden the upper part of the gully. And forthwith,
  with a sudden contraction of the heart, he saw the cave bear half-way down
  from the brow, and making a gingerly backward step with his flat hind-foot.
  His hind-quarters were towards Ugh-lomi, and he clawed at the rocks and
  bushes so that he seemed flattened against the cliff. He looked none the less
  for that. From his shining snout to his stumpy tail he was a lion and a half,
  the length of two tall men. He looked over his shoulder, and his huge mouth
  was open with the exertion of holding up his great carcase, and his tongue
  lay out... .</p>

  <p>He got his footing, and came down slowly, a yard nearer.</p>

  <p>"Bear," said Ugh-lomi, looking round with his face white.</p>

  <p>But Eudena, with terror in her eyes, was pointing down the cliff.</p>

  <p>Ugh-lomi's mouth fell open. For down below, with her big fore-feet against
  the rock, stood another big brown-grey bulk&mdash;the she-bear. She was not
  so big as Andoo, but she was big enough for all that.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly Ugh-lomi gave a cry, and catching up a handful of the litter
  of ferns that lay scattered on the ledge, he thrust it into the pallid ash of
  the fire. "Brother Fire!" he cried, "Brother Fire!" And Eudena, starting into
  activity, did likewise. "Brother Fire! Help, help! Brother Fire!"</p>

  <p>Brother Fire was still red in his heart, but he turned to grey as they
  scattered him. "Brother Fire!" they screamed. But he whispered and passed,
  and there was nothing but ashes. Then Ugh-lomi danced with anger and struck
  the ashes with his fist. But Eudena began to hammer the firestone against a
  flint. And the eyes of each were turning ever and again towards the gully by
  which Andoo was climbing down. Brother Fire! Suddenly the huge furry
  hind-quarters of the bear came into view, beneath the bulge of the chalk that
  had hidden him. He was still clambering gingerly down the nearly vertical
  surface. His head was yet out of sight, but they could hear him talking to
  himself. "Pig and monkey," said the cave bear. "It ought to be good."</p>

  <p>Eudena struck a spark and blew at it; it twinkled brighter and then
  &mdash;went out. At that she cast down flint and firestone and began wringing
  her hands. Her face was wet with tears. Then she sprang to her feet and
  scrambled a dozen feet up the cliff above the ledge. How she hung on even for
  a moment I do not know, for the chalk was vertical and without grip for a
  monkey. In a couple of seconds she had slid back to the ledge again with
  bleeding hands.</p>

  <p>Ugh-lomi was making frantic rushes about the ledge-now he would go to the
  edge, now to the gully. He did not know what to do, he could not think. The
  she-bear looked smaller than her mate&mdash;much. If they rushed down on her
  together, one might live. "Eigh?" said the cave bear, and Ugh-lomi turned
  again and saw his little eyes peering under the bulge of the chalk. "Stand
  away!" said the bear; "I'm going to jump down."</p>

  <p>Eudena, cowering at the end of the ledge, began to scream like a gripped
  rabbit.</p>

  <p>At that a sort of madness came upon Ugh-lomi. With a mighty cry, he caught
  up his axe and began to clamber up the gully to the bear. He uttered neither
  word nor cry. The monster gave a grunt of surprise. In a moment Ugh-lomi was
  clinging to a bush right underneath the bear, and in another he was hanging
  to its back half buried in fur, with one fist clutched in the hair under its
  jaw. The bear was too astonished at this fantastic attack to do more than
  cling passive. And then the axe, the first of all axes, rang in its
  skull.</p>

  <p>The bear's head twisted from side to side, and he began a petulant
  scolding growl. The axe bit within an inch of the left eye, and the hot blood
  blinded that side. At that the brute roared with surprise and anger, and his
  teeth gnashed six inches from Ugh-lomi's face. Then the axe, clubbed close,
  came down heavily on the corner of the jaw.</p>

  <p>The next blow blinded the right side and called forth a roar, this time of
  pain. Eudena saw the huge, flat feet slipping and sliding, and suddenly the
  bear gave a clumsy leap sideways, as if for the ledge. Then everything
  vanished, and the hazels smashed, and a roar of pain and a tumult of shouts
  and growls came up from far below.</p>

  <p>Eudena screamed and ran to the edge and peered over. For a moment, man and
  bears were a heap together, Ugh-lomi uppermost; and then he had sprung clear
  and was scaling the gully again, with the bears rolling and striking at one
  another among the hazels. But he had left his axe below, and three knob-
  ended streaks of carmine were shooting down his thigh. "Up!" he cried, and in
  a moment Eudena was preceding him to the top of the cliff.</p>

  <p>In half a minute they were at the crest, their hearts pumping noisily,
  with Andoo and his wife far and safe below them. Andoo was sitting on his
  haunches, both paws at work, trying with quick exasperated movements to wipe
  the blindness out of his eyes, and the she-bear stood on all-fours a little
  way off, ruffled in appearance and growling angrily. Ugh-lomi flung himself
  flat on the grass, and lay panting and bleeding with his face on his
  arms.</p>

  <p>For a second Eudena regarded the bears, then she came and sat beside him,
  looking at him...</p>

  <p>Presently she put forth her hand timidly and touched him, and made the
  guttural sound that was his name. He turned over and raised himself on his
  arm. His face was pale, like the face of one who is afraid. He looked at her
  steadfastly for a moment, and then suddenly he laughed. "Waugh!" he said
  exultantly.</p>

  <p>"Waugh!" said she&mdash;a simple but expressive conversation.</p>

  <p>Then Ugh-lomi came and knelt beside her, and on hands and knees peered
  over the brow and examined the gorge. His breath was steady now, and the
  blood on his leg had ceased to flow, though the scratches the she-bear had
  made were open and wide. He squatted up and sat staring at the footmarks of
  the great bear as they came to the gully&mdash;they were as wide as his head
  and twice as long. Then he jumped up and went along the cliff face until the
  ledge was visible. Here he sat down for some time thinking, while Eudena
  watched him.</p>

  <p>Presently Ugh-lomi rose, as one whose mind is made up. He returned towards
  the gully, Eudena keeping close by him, and together they clambered to the
  ledge. They took the firestone and a flint, and then Ugh-lomi went down to
  the foot of the cliff very cautiously, and found his axe. They returned to
  the cliff now as quietly as they could, and turning their faces resolutely
  up-stream set off at a brisk walk. The ledge was a home no longer, with such
  callers in the neighbourhood. Ugh-lomi carried the axe and Eudena the fire-
  stone. So simple was a Pal&aelig;olithic removal.</p>

  <p>They went up-stream, although it might lead to the very lair of the cave
  bear, because there was no other way to go. Down the stream was the tribe,
  and had not Ugh-lomi killed Uya and Wau? By the stream they had to
  keep&mdash;because of drinking.</p>

  <p>So they marched, through beech trees, with the gorge deepening until the
  river flowed, a frothing rapid, five hundred feet below them. And of all the
  changeful things in this world of change, the courses of rivers, in deep
  valleys change least. It was the river Wey, the river we know to-day, and
  they marched over the very spots where nowadays stand little Guildford and
  Godalming&mdash;the first human beings to come into the land. Once a grey ape
  chattered and vanished, and all along the cliff edge, vast and even, ran the
  spoor of the great cave bear.</p>

  <p>And then the spoor of the bear fell away from the cliff, showing, Ugh-
  lomi thought, that he came from some place to the left, and keeping to the
  cliff's edge, they presently came to an end. They found themselves looking
  down on a great semi-circular space caused by the collapse of the cliff. It
  had smashed right across the gorge, banking the up-stream water back in a
  pool which overflowed in a rapid. The slip had happened long ago. It was
  grassed over, but the face of the cliffs that stood about the semicircle was
  still almost fresh-looking and white as on the day when the rock must have
  broken and slid down. Starkly exposed and black under the foot of these
  cliffs were the mouths of several caves. And as they stood there, looking at
  the space, and disinclined to skirt it, because they thought the bears' lair
  lay somewhere on the left in the direction they must needs take, they saw
  suddenly first one bear and then two coming up the grass slope to the right
  and going across the amphitheatre towards the caves. Andoo was first, and he
  dropped a little on his fore-foot, and his mien was despondent, and the
  she-bear came shuffling behind.</p>

  <p>Eudena and Ugh-lomi stepped quite noiselessly back from the cliff until
  they could just see the bears over the verge. Then Ugh-lomi stopped. Eudena
  pulled his arm, but he turned with a forbidding gesture, and her hand
  dropped. Ugh-lomi stood watching the bears, with his axe in his hand, until
  they had vanished into the cave. He growled softly, and shook the axe at the
  she-bear's receding quarters. Then to Euderia's terror, instead of creeping
  off with her, he lay flat down and crawled forward into such a position that
  he could just see the cave. It was bears&mdash;and he did it as calmly as if
  it had been rabbits he was watching!</p>

  <p>He lay still, like a barked log, sun-dappled, in the shadow of the trees.
  He was thinking. And Eudena had learnt, even when a little girl, that when
  Ugh-lomi became still like that, jawbone on fist, novel things presently
  began to happen.</p>

  <p>It was an hour before the thinking was over; it was noon when the two
  little savages had found their way to the cliff brow that overhung the bears'
  cave. And all the long afternoon they fought desperately with a great boulder
  of chalk; trundling it, with nothing but their unaided sturdy muscles, from
  the gully where it had hung like a loose tooth, towards the cliff top. It was
  full two yards about, it stood as high as Eudena's waist, it was
  obtuse-angled and toothed with flints. And when the sun set it was poised,
  three inches from the edge, above the cave of the great cave bear.</p>

  <p>In the cave, conversation languished during the afternoon. The she-bear
  snoozed sulkily in her corner&mdash;for she was fond of pig and monkey
  &mdash;and Andoo was busy licking the side of his paw and smearing his face
  to cool the smart and inflammation of his wounds. Afterwards he went and sat
  just within the mouth of the cave, blinking out at the afternoon sun with his
  uninjured eye, and thinking.</p>

  <p>"I never was so startled in my life," he said at last. "They are the most
  extraordinary beasts. Attacking me!"</p>

  <p>"I don't like them," said the she-bear, out of the darkness behind.</p>

  <p>"A feebler sort of beast I never saw. I can't think what the world is
  coming to. Scraggy, weedy legs...Wonder how they keep warm in winter?"</p>

  <p>"Very likely they don't," said the she&mdash;bear.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's a sort of monkey gone wrong."</p>

  <p>"It's a change," said the she-bear.</p>

  <p>A pause.</p>

  <p>"The advantage he had was merely accidental," said Andoo. "These things
  will happen at times."</p>

  <p>"I can't understand why you let go," said the she-bear.</p>

  <p>That matter had been discussed before, and settled. So Andoo, being a bear
  of experience, remained silent for a space. Then he resumed upon a different
  aspect of the matter. "He has a sort of claw&mdash;a long claw that he seemed
  to have first on one paw and then on the other. Just one claw. They're very
  odd things. The bright thing, too, they seemed to have&mdash;like that glare
  that comes in the sky in daytime&mdash;only it jumps about&mdash;it's really
  worth seeing. It's a thing with a root, too&mdash;like grass when it is
  windy."</p>

  <p>"Does it bite?" asked the she-bear. "If it bites it can't be a plant."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I don't know," said Andoo. "But it's curious, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if they are good eating?" said the she-bear.</p>

  <p>"They look it," said Andoo, with appetite&mdash;for the cave bear, like
  the polar bear, was an incurable carnivore&mdash;no roots or honey for
  him.</p>

  <p>The two bears fell into a meditation for a space. Then Andoo resumed his
  simple attentions to his eye. The sunlight up the green slope before the cave
  mouth grew warmer in tone and warmer, until it was a ruddy amber.</p>

  <p>"Curious sort of thing&mdash;day," said the cave bear. "Lot too much of
  it, I think. Quite unsuitable for hunting. Dazzles me always. I can't smell
  nearly so well by day."</p>

  <p>The she-bear did not answer, but there came a measured crunching sound out
  of the darkness. She had turned up a bone. Andoo yawned. "Well," he said. He
  strolled to the cave mouth and stood with his head projecting, surveying the
  amphitheatre. He found he had to turn his head completely round to see
  objects on his right-hand side. No doubt that eye would be all right
  to-morrow.</p>

  <p>He yawned again. There was a tap overhead, and a big mass of chalk flew
  out from the cliff face, dropped a yard in front of his nose, and starred
  into a dozen unequal fragments. It startled him extremely. When he had
  recovered a little from his shock, he went and sniffed curiously at the
  representative pieces of the fallen projectile. They had a distinctive
  flavour, oddly reminiscent of the two drab animals of the ledge. He sat up
  and pawed the larger lump, and walked round it several times trying to find a
  man about it somewhere...</p>

  <p>When night had come he went off down the river gorge to see if he could
  cut off either of the ledge's occupants. The ledge was empty, there were no
  signs of the red thing, but as he was rather hungry he did not loiter long
  that night, but pushed on to pick up a red deer fawn. He forgot about the
  drab animals. He found a fawn, but the doe was close by and made an ugly
  fight for her young. Andoo had to leave the fawn, but as her blood was up she
  stuck to the attack, and at last he got in a blow of his paw at her nose, and
  so got hold of her. More meat but less delicacy, and the she-bear, following,
  had her share. The next afternoon, curiously enough, the very fellow of the
  first white rock fell, and smashed precisely according to precedent.</p>

  <p>The aim of the third, that fell the night after, however, was better. It
  hit Andoo's unspeculative skull with a crack that echoed up the cliff, and
  the white fragments went dancing to all the points of the compass. The
  she-bear coming after him and sniffing curiously at him, found him lying in
  an odd sort of attitude, with his head wet and all out of shape. She was a
  young she-bear, and inexperienced, and having sniffed about him for some time
  and licked him a little, and so forth, she decided to leave him until the odd
  mood had passed, and went on her hunting alone.</p>

  <p>She looked up the fawn of the red doe they had killed two nights ago, and
  found it. But it was lonely hunting without Andoo, and she returned caveward
  before dawn. The sky was grey and overcast, the trees up the gorge were black
  and unfamiliar, and into her ursine mind came a dim sense of strange and
  dreary happenings. She lifted up her voice and called Andoo by name. The
  sides of the gorge re-echoed her.</p>

  <p>As she approached the caves she saw in the half light, and heard, a couple
  of jackals scuttle off, and immediately after a hy&aelig;na howled and a
  dozen clumsy bulks went lumbering up the slope, and stopped and yelled
  derision. "Lord of the rocks and caves&mdash;ya-ha!" came down the wind. The
  dismal feeling in the she-bear's mind became suddenly acute. She shuffled
  across the amphitheatre.</p>

  <p>"Ya-ha!" said the hy&aelig;nas, retreating.</p>

  <p>"Ya-ha!"</p>

  <p>The cave bear was not lying quite in the same attitude, because the
  hy&aelig;nas had been busy, and in one place his ribs showed white. Dotted
  over the turf about him lay the smashed fragments of the three great lumps of
  chalk. And the air was full of the scent of death.</p>

  <p>The she-bear stopped dead. Even now, that the great and wonderful Andoo
  was killed was beyond her believing. Then she heard far overhead a sound, a
  queer sound, a little like the shout of a hy&aelig;na but fuller and lower in
  pitch. She looked up, with her little dawn-blinded eyes, seeing little, her
  nostrils quivering. And there, on the cliff edge, far above her against the
  bright pink of dawn, were two little shaggy round dark things, the heads of
  Eudena and Ugh-lomi, as they shouted derision at her. But though she could
  not see them very distinctly she could hear, and dimly she began to
  apprehend. A novel feeling as of imminent strange evils came into her
  heart.</p>

  <p>She began to examine the smashed fragments of chalk that lay about Andoo.
  For a space she stood still, looking about her and making a low continuous
  sound that was almost a moan. Then she went back incredulously to Andoo to
  make one last effort to rouse him.</p>

  <p>Thus it was in the dawn of time that the Great Bears, who were the Lords
  of the Rocks and Caves, began their acquaintance with Man.</p>

  3. THE FIRST HORSEMAN</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Idler</i>, July 1897</h3>

  <p>Now, in the days when Ugh-lomi killed the great cave bear there was little
  trouble between the horses and men. Indeed, they lived apart&mdash;the men in
  the river swamps and thickets, the horses on the wide grassy uplands between
  the chestnuts and the pines. Sometimes a pony would come straying into the
  clogging marshes to make a flint-hacked meal, and sometimes the tribe would
  find one, the kill of a lion, and drive off the jackals, and feast heartily
  while the sun was high. These horses of the old time were clumsy at the
  fetlock and dun-coloured, with a rough tail and big head. They came every
  spring-time north-westward into the country, after the swallows and before
  the hippopotami, as the grass on the wide downland stretches grew long. They
  came only in small bodies thus far, each herd, a stallion and two or three
  mares and a foal or so, having its own stretch of country, and they went
  again when the chestnut trees were yellow and the wolves came down the
  Wealden mountains.</p>

  <p>It was their custom to graze right out in the open, going into cover only
  in the heat of the day. They avoided the long stretches of thorn and
  beechwood, preferring an isolated group of trees, void of ambuscade, so that
  it was hard to come upon them. They were never fighters; their heels and
  teeth were for one another, but in the clear country, once they were started,
  no living thing came near them, though perhaps the elephant might have done
  so, had he felt the need. And in those days man seemed a harmless thing
  enough. No whisper of prophetic intelligence told the species of the terrible
  slavery that was to come, of the whip and spur and bearing-rein, the clumsy
  load and the slippery street, the insufficient food, and the knacker's yard,
  that was to replace the wide grass-land and the freedom of the earth.</p>

  <p>Down in the Wey marshes Ugh-lomi and Eudena had never seen the horses
  closely, but now they saw them every day as the two of them raided out from
  their lair on the ledge in the gorge, raiding together in search of food.
  They had returned to the ledge after the killing of Andoo; for of the
  she-bear they were not afraid. The she-bear had become afraid of them, and
  when she winded them she went aside. The two went together everywhere; for
  since they had left the tribe Eudena was not so much Ugh-lomi's woman as his
  mate; she learnt to hunt even&mdash;as much, that is, as any woman could. She
  was indeed a marvellous woman. He would lie for hours watching a beast, or
  planning catches in that shock head of his, and she would stay beside him,
  with her bright eyes upon him, offering no irritating suggestions&mdash;as
  still as any man. A wonderful woman!</p>

  <p>At the top of the cliff was an open grassy lawn and then beechwoods, and
  going through the beechwoods one came to the edge of the rolling grassy
  expanse, and in sight of the horses. Here, on the edge of the wood and
  bracken, were the rabbit-burrows, and here among the fronds Eudena and
  Ugh-lomi would lie with their throwing-stones ready, until the little people
  came out to nibble and play in the sunset. And while Eudena would sit, a
  silent figure of watchfulness, regarding the burrows, Ugh-lomi's eyes were
  ever away across the greensward at those wonderful grazing strangers.</p>

  <p>In a dim way he appreciated their grace and their supple nimbleness. As
  the sun declined in the evening-time, and the heat of the day passed, they
  would become active, would start chasing one another, neighing, dodging,
  shaking their manes, coming round in great curves, sometimes so close that
  the pounding of the turf sounded like hurried thunder. It looked so fine that
  Ugh-lomi wanted to join in badly. And sometimes one would roll over on the
  turf, kicking four hoofs heavenward, which seemed formidable and was
  certainly much less alluring.</p>

  <p>Dim imaginings ran through Ugh-lomi's mind as he watched&mdash;by virtue
  of which two rabbits lived the longer. And sleeping, his brains were clearer
  and bolder&mdash;for that was the way in those days. He came near the horses,
  he dreamt, and fought, smiting stone against hoof, but then the horses
  changed to men, or, at least, to men with horses' heads, and he awoke in a
  cold sweat of terror.</p>

  <p>Yet the next day in the morning, as the horses were grazing, one of the
  mares whinnied, and they saw Ugh-lomi coming up the wind. They all stopped
  their eating and watched him. Ugh-lomi was not coming towards them, but
  strolling obliquely across the open, looking at anything in the world but
  horses. He had stuck three fern-fronds into the mat of his hair, giving him a
  remarkable appearance, and he walked very slowly. "What's up now?" said the
  Master Horse, who was capable, but inexperienced.</p>

  <p>"It looks more like the first half of an animal than anything else in the
  world," he said. "Fore-legs and no hind."</p>

  <p>"It's only one of those pink monkey things," said the Eldest Mare.
  "They're a sort of river monkey. They're quite common on the plains."</p>

  <p>Ugh-lomi continued his oblique advance. The Eldest Mare was struck with
  the want of motive in his proceedings.</p>

  <p>"Fool!" said the Eldest Mare, in a quick conclusive way she had. She
  resumed her grazing. The Master Horse and the Second Mare followed suit.</p>

  <p>"Look! he's nearer," said the Foal with a stripe.</p>

  <p>One of the younger foals made uneasy movements. Ugh-lomi squatted down and
  sat regarding the horses fixedly. In a little while he was satisfied that
  they meant neither flight nor hostilities. He began to consider his next
  procedure. He did not feel anxious to kill, but he had his axe with him, and
  the spirit of sport was upon him. How would one kill one of these creatures?
  &mdash;these great beautiful creatures!</p>

  <p>Eudena, watching him with a fearful admiration from the cover of the
  bracken, saw him presently go on all fours, and so proceed again. But the
  horses preferred him a biped to a quadruped, and the Master Horse threw up
  his head and gave the word to move. Ugh-lomi thought they were off for good,
  but after a minute's gallop they came round in a wide curve, and stood
  winding him. Then, as a rise in the ground hid him they tailed out, the
  Master Horse leading and approached him spirally.</p>

  <p>He was as ignorant of the possibilities of a horse as they were of his.
  And at this stage it would seem he funked. He knew this kind of stalking
  would make red deer or buffalo charge, if it was persisted in. At any rate
  Eudena saw him jump up and come walking towards her with the fern plumes held
  in his hand.</p>

  <p>She stood up, and he grinned to show that the whole thing was an immense
  lark, and that what he had done was just what he had planned to do from the
  very beginning. So that incident ended. But he was very thoughtful all that
  day.</p>

  <p>The next day this foolish drab creature with the leonine mane, instead of
  going about the grazing or hunting he was made for, was prowling round the
  horses again. The Eldest Mare was all for silent contempt. "I suppose he
  wants to learn something from us," she said, and "Let him." The next day he
  was at it again. The Master Horse decided he meant absolutely nothing. But as
  a matter of fact, Ugh-lomi, the first of men to feel that curious spell of
  the horse that binds us even to this day, meant a great deal. He admired them
  unreservedly. There was a rudiment of the snob in him, I am afraid, and he
  wanted to be near these beautifully-curved animals. Then here were vague
  conceptions of a kill. If only they would let him come near them! But they
  drew the line, he found, at fifty yards. If he came nearer than that they
  moved off&mdash;with dignity. I suppose it was the way he had blinded Andoo
  that made him think of leaping on the back of one of them. But though Eudena
  after a time came out in the open too, and they did some unobtrusive
  stalking, things stopped there.</p>

  <p>Then one memorable day a new idea came to Ugh-lomi. The horse looks down
  and level, but he does not look up. No animals look up&mdash;they have too
  much common-sense. It was only that fantastic creature, man, could waste his
  wits sky-ward. Ugh-lomi made no philosophical deductions, but he perceived
  the thing was so. So he spent a weary day in a beech that stood in the open,
  while Eudena stalked. Usually the horses went into the shade in the heat of
  the afternoon, but that day the sky was overcast, and they would not, in
  spite of Eudena's solicitude.</p>

  <p>It was two days after that that Ugh-lomi had his desire. The day was
  blazing hot, and the multiplying flies asserted themselves. The horses
  stopped grazing before mid-day, and came into the shadow below him, and stood
  in couples nose to tail, flapping.</p>

  <p>The Master Horse, by virtue of his heels, came closest to the tree. And
  suddenly there was a rustle and a creak, a thud... Then a sharp chipped flint
  bit him on the cheek. The Master Horse stumbled, came on one knee, rose to
  his feet, and was off like the wind. The air was full of the whirl of limbs,
  the prance of hoofs, and snorts of alarm. Ugh-lomi was pitched a foot in the
  air, came down again, up again, his stomach was hit violently, and then his
  knees got a grip of something between them. He found himself clutching with
  knees, feet, and hands, careering violently with extraordinary oscillation
  through the air&mdash;his axe gone heaven knows whither. "Hold tight," said
  Mother Instinct, and he did.</p>

  <p>He was aware of a lot of coarse hair in his face, some of it between his
  teeth, and of green turf streaming past in front of his eyes. He saw the
  shoulder of the Master Horse, vast and sleek, with the muscles flowing
  swiftly under the skin. He perceived that his arms were round the neck, and
  that the violent jerkings he experienced had a sort of rhythm.</p>

  <p>Then he was in the midst of a wild rush of tree-stems, and then there were
  fronds of bracken about, and then more open turf. Then a stream of pebbles
  rushing past, little pebbles flying side-ways athwart the stream from the
  blow of the swift hoofs. Ugh-lomi began to feel frightfully sick and giddy,
  but he was not the stuff to leave go simply because he was uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>He dared not leave his grip, but he tried to make himself more
  comfortable. He released his hug on the neck, gripping the mane instead. He
  slipped his knees forward, and pushing back, came into a sitting position
  where the quarters broaden.</p>

  <p>It was nervous work, but he managed it, and at last he was fairly seated
  astride, breathless indeed, and uncertain, but with that frightful pounding
  of his body at any rate relieved.</p>

  <p>Slowly the fragments of Ugh-lomi's mind got into order again. The pace
  seemed to him terrific, but a kind of exultation was beginning to oust his
  first frantic terror. The air rushed by, sweet and wonderful, the rhythm of
  the hoofs changed and broke up and returned into itself again. They were on
  turf now, a wide glade&mdash;the beech-trees a hundred yards away on either
  side, and a succulent band of green starred with pink blossom and shot with
  silver water here and there, meandered down the middle. Far off was a glimpse
  of blue valley&mdash;far away. The exultation grew. It was man's first taste
  of pace.</p>

  <p>Then came a wide space dappled with flying fallow deer scattering this way
  and that, and then a couple of jackals, mistaking Ugh-lomi for a lion, came
  hurrying after him. And when they saw it was not a lion they still came on
  out of curiosity. On galloped the horse, with his one idea of escape, and
  after him the jackals, with pricked ears and quickly barked remarks. "Which
  kills which?" said the first jackal. "It's the horse being killed," said the
  second. They gave the howl of following, and the horse answered to it as a
  horse answers nowadays to the spur.</p>

  <p>On they rushed, a little tornado through the quiet day, putting up
  startled birds, sending a dozen unexpected things darting to cover, raising a
  myriad of indignant dung-flies, smashing little blossoms, flowering
  complacently, back into their parental turf. Trees again, and then splash,
  splash across a torrent; then a hare shot out of a tuft of grass under the
  very hoofs of the Master Horse, and the jackals left them incontinently. So
  presently they broke into the open again, a wide expanse of turfy hillside
  &mdash;the very fellow of the grassy downs that fall northward nowadays from
  the Epsom Stand.</p>

  <p>The first hot bolt of the Master Horse was long since over. He was falling
  into a measured trot, and Ugh-lomi, albeit bruised exceedingly and quite
  uncertain of the future, was in a state of glorious enjoyment. And now came a
  new development. The pace broke again, the Master Horse came round on a short
  curve, and stopped dead...</p>

  <p>Ugh-lomi became alert. He wished he had a flint, but the throwing flint he
  had carried in a thong about his waist was&mdash;like the axe&mdash;heaven
  knows where. The Master Horse turned his head, and Ugh-lomi became aware of
  an eye and teeth. He whipped his leg into a position of security, and hit at
  the cheek with his fist. Then the head went down somewhere out of existence
  apparently, and the back he was sitting on flew up into a dome. Ugh-lomi
  became a thing of instinct again&mdash;strictly prehensile; he held by knees
  and feet, and his head seemed sliding towards the turf. His fingers were
  twisted into the shock of mane, and the rough hair of the horse saved him.
  The gradient he was on lowered again, and then&mdash;"Whup!" said Ugh-lomi
  astonished, and the slant was the other way up. But Ugh-lomi was a thousand
  generations nearer the primordial than man: no monkey could have held on
  better. And the lion had been training the horse for countless generations
  against the tactics of rolling and rearing back. But he kicked like a master,
  and buck-jumped rather neatly. In five minutes Ugh-lomi lived a lifetime. If
  he came off the horse would kill him, he felt assured.</p>

  <p>Then the Master Horse decided to stick to his old tactics again, and
  suddenly went off at a gallop. He headed down the slope, taking the steep
  places at a rush, swerving neither to the right nor to the left, and, as they
  rode down, the wide expanse of valley sank out of sight behind the
  approaching skirmishers of oak and Hawthorn. They skirted a sudden hollow
  with the pool of a spring, rank weeds and silver bushes. The ground grew
  softer and the grass taller, and on the right-hand side and the left came
  scattered bushes of May&mdash;still splashed with belated blossom. Presently
  the bushes thickened until they lashed the passing rider, and little flashes
  and gouts of blood came out on horse and man. Then the way opened again.</p>

  <p>And then came a wonderful adventure. A sudden squeal of unreasonable anger
  rose amidst the bushes, the squeal of some creature bitterly wronged. And
  crashing after them appeared a big, grey-blue shape. It was Yaaa the
  big-horned rhinoceros, in one of those fits of fury of his, charging full
  tilt, after the manner of his kind. He had been startled at his feeding, and
  someone, it did not matter who, was to be ripped and trampled therefore. He
  was bearing down on them from the left, with his wicked little eye red, and
  his great horn down, and his little tail like a jury-mast behind him. For a
  minute Ugh-lomi was minded to slip off and dodge, and then behold! the
  staccato of the hoofs grew swifter, and the rhinoceros and his stumpy
  hurrying little legs seemed to slide out at the back corner of Ugh-lomi's
  eye. In two minutes they were through the bushes of May, and out in the open,
  going fast. For a space he could hear the ponderous paces in pursuit receding
  behind him, and then it was just as if Yaaa had not lost his temper, as if
  Yaaa had never existed.</p>

  <p>The pace never faltered, on they rode land on.</p>

  <p>Ugh-lomi was now all exultation. To exult in those days was to insult.
  "Ya-ha! big nose," he said, trying to crane back and see some remote speck of
  a pursuer. "Why don't you carry your smiting-stone in your fist?" he ended
  with a frantic whoop.</p>

  <p>But that whoop was unfortunate, for coming close to the ear of the horse,
  and being quite unexpected, it startled the stallion extremely. He shied
  violently. Ugh-lomi suddenly found himself uncomfortable again. He was
  hanging on to the horse, he found, by one arm and one knee.</p>

  <p>The rest of the ride was honourable but unpleasant. The view was chiefly
  of blue sky, and that was combined with the most unpleasant physical
  sensations. Finally, a bush of thorn lashed him and he let go. He hit the
  ground with his cheek and shoulder, and then, after a complicated and
  extraordinarily rapid movement, hit it again with the end of his backbone. He
  saw splashes and sparks of light and colour. The ground seemed bouncing about
  just like the horse had done. Then he found he was sitting on turf, six yards
  beyond the bush. In front of him was a space of grass, growing greener and
  greener, and a number of human beings in the distance, and the horse was
  going round at a smart gallop quite a long way off to the right.</p>

  <p>The human beings were on the opposite side of the river, some still in the
  water, but they were all running away as hard as they could go. The advent of
  a monster that took to pieces was not the sort of novelty they cared for. For
  quite a minute Ugh-lomi sat regarding them in a purely spectacular spirit.
  The bend of the river, the knoll among the reeds and royal ferns, the thin
  streams of smoke going up to Heaven, were all perfectly familiar to him. It
  was the squatting-place of the Sons of Uya, of Uya from whom he had fled with
  Eudena, and whom he had waylaid in the chestnut woods and killed with the
  First Axe.</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet, still dazed from his fall, and as he did so the
  scattering fugitives turned and regarded him. Some pointed to the receding
  horse and chattered. He walked slowly towards them, staring. He forgot the
  horse, he forgot his own bruises, in the growing interest of this encounter.
  There were fewer of them than there had been&mdash;he supposed the others
  must have hid&mdash;the heap of fern or the night fire was not so high. By
  the flint heaps should have sat Wau&mdash;but then he remembered he had
  killed Wau. Suddenly brought back to this familiar scene, the gorge and the
  bears and Eudena seemed things remote, things dreamt of.</p>

  <p>He stopped at the bank and stood regarding the tribe. His mathematical
  abilities were of the slightest, but it was certain there were fewer. The men
  might be away, but there were fewer women and children. He gave the shout of
  homecoming. His quarrel had been with Uya and Wau&mdash;not with the others.
  They answered with his name, a little fearfully because of the strange way he
  had come.</p>

  <p>"Children of Uya!" he cried.</p>

  <p>For a space they spoke together. Then an old woman lifted a shrill voice
  and answered him. "Our Lord is a Lion."</p>

  <p>Ugh-lomi did not understand that saying. They answered him again several
  together, "Uya comes again. He comes as a Lion. Our Lord is a Lion. He comes
  at night. He slays whom he will. But none other may slay us, Ugh-lomi. None
  other may slay us."</p>

  <p>Still Ugh-lomi did not understand.</p>

  <p>"Our Lord is a Lion. He speaks no more to men."</p>

  <p>Ugh-lomi stood regarding them. He had had dreams&mdash;he knew that though
  he had killed Uya, Uya still existed. And now they told him Uya was a
  Lion.</p>

  <p>The shrivelled old woman, the mistress of the fire-minders, suddenly
  turned and spoke softly to those next to her. She was a very old woman
  indeed, she had been the first of Uya's wives, and he had let her live beyond
  the age to which it is seemly a woman should live. She had been cunning from
  the first, cunning to please Uya and to get food. And now she was great in
  counsel. She spoke softly, and Ugh-lomi watched her shrivelled form across
  the river with a curious distaste. Then she called aloud, "Come over to us,
  Ugh-lomi."</p>

  <p>A girl suddenly lifted up her voice. "Come over to us, Ugh-lomi," she
  said. And they all began crying, "Come over to us, Ugh-lomi."</p>

  <p>It was strange how their manner changed after the old woman called. He
  stood quite still watching them all. It was pleasant to be called, and the
  girl who had called first was a pretty one. But she made him think of
  Eudena.</p>

  <p>"Come over to us, Ugh-lomi," they cried, and the voice of the shrivelled
  old woman rose above them all. At the sound of her voice his hesitation
  returned. He stood on the river bank, Ugh-lomi&mdash;Ugh the
  Thinker&mdash;with his thoughts slowly taking shape. Presently one and then
  another paused to see what he would do. He was minded to go back, he was
  minded not to. Suddenly his fear or his caution got the upper hand. Without
  answering them he turned, and walked back towards the distant thorn-trees,
  the way he had come. Forthwith the whole tribe started crying to him again
  very eagerly. He hesitated and turned, then he went on, then he turned again,
  and then once again, regarding them with troubled eyes as they called. The
  last time he took two paces back, before his fear stopped him. They saw him
  stop once more, and suddenly shake his head and vanish among the
  hawthorn-trees.</p>

  <p>Then all the women and children lifted up their voices together, and
  called to him in one last vain effort.</p>

  <p>Far down the river the reeds were stirring in the breeze, where,
  convenient for his new sort of feeding, the old lion, who had taken to man-
  eating, had made his lair.</p>

  <p>The old woman turned her face that way, and pointed to the hawthorn
  thickets. "Uya," she screamed, "there goes thine enemy! There goes thine
  enemy, Uya! Why do you devour us nightly? We have tried to snare him There
  goes thine enemy, Uya!"</p>

  <p>But the lion who preyed upon the tribe was taking his siesta. The cry went
  unheard. That day he had dined on one of the plumper girls, and his mood was
  a comfortable placidity. He really did not understand that he was Uya or that
  Ugh-lomi was his enemy.</p>

  <p>So it was that Ugh-lomi rode the horse, and heard first of Uya the lion,
  who had taken the place of Uya the Master, and was eating up the tribe. And
  as he hurried back to the gorge his mind was no longer full of the horse, but
  of the thought that Uya was still alive, to slay or be slain. Over and over
  again he saw the shrunken band of women and children crying that Uya was a
  lion. Uya was a lion!</p>

  <p>And presently, fearing the twilight might come upon him, Ugh-lomi began
  running.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="story41"
     name="story41">A STORY OF THE STONE AGE&mdash;<br>
  4. THE REIGN OF UYA THE LION</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Idler</i>, August 1897</h3>

  <p>The old lion was in luck. The tribe had a certain pride in their ruler,
  but that was all the satisfaction the got out of it. He came the very night
  that Ugh-lomi killed Uya the Cunning, and so it was they named him Uya. It
  was the old woman, the fire-minder, who first named him Uya. A shower had
  lowered the fires to a glow, and made the night dark. And as they conversed
  together, and peered at one another in the darkness, and wondered fearfully
  what Uya would do to them in their dreams now that he was dead, they heard
  the mounting reverberations of the lion's roar close at hand. Then everything
  was still.</p>

  <p>They held their breath, so that almost the only sounds were the patter of
  the rain and the hiss of the raindrops in the ashes. And then, after an
  interminable time, a crash, and a shriek of fear, and a growling. They sprang
  to their feet, shouting, screaming, running this way and that, but brands
  would not burn, and in a minute the victim was being dragged away through the
  ferns. It was Irk, the brother of Wau. So the lion came.</p>

  <p>The ferns were still wet from the rain the next night, and he came and
  took Click with the red hair. That sufficed for two nights. And then in the
  dark between the moons he came three nights, night after night, and that
  though they had good fires. He was an old lion with stumpy teeth, but very
  silent and very cool; he knew of fires before; these were not the first of
  mankind that had ministered to his old age. The third night he came between
  the outer fire and the inner, and he leapt the flint heap, and pulled down
  Irm the son of Irk, who had seemed like to be the leader. That was a dreadful
  night, because they lit great flares of fern and ran screaming, and the lion
  missed his hold of Irm. By the glare of the fire they saw Irm struggle up,
  and run a little way towards them, and then the lion in two bounds had him
  down again. That was the last of Irm.</p>

  <p>So fear came, and all the delight of spring passed out of their lives.
  Already there were five gone out of the tribe, and four nights added three
  more to the number. Food-seeking became spiritless, none knew who might go
  next, and all day the women toiled, even the favourite women, gathering
  litter and sticks for the night fires. And the hunters hunted ill: in the
  warm spring-time hunger came again as though it was still winter. The tribe
  might have moved, had they had a leader, but they had no leader, and none
  knew where to go that the lion could not follow them. So the old lion waxed
  fat and thanked heaven for the race of men. Two of the children and a youth
  died while the moon was still new, and then it was the shrivelled old
  fire-minder first bethought herself in a dream of Eudena and Ugh-lomi, and of
  the way Uya, had been slain. She had lived in fear of Uya all her days, and
  now she lived in fear of the lion. That Ugh-lomi could kill Uya for
  good&mdash;Ugh-lomi whom she had seen born-was impossible. It was Uya still
  seeking his enemy!</p>

  <p>And then came the strange return of Ugh-lomi, a wonderful animal seen
  galloping far across the river, that suddenly changed into two animals, a
  horse and a man. Following this portent, the vision of Ugh-lomi on the
  farther bank of the river...Yes, it was all plain to her. Uya was punishing
  them, because they had not hunted down Ugh-lomi and Eudena.</p>

  <p>The men came straggling back to the chances of the night while the sun was
  still golden in the sky. They were received with the story of Ugh-lomi. She
  went across the river with them and showed them his spoor hesitating on the
  farther bank. Siss the Tracker knew the feet for Ugh-lomi's. "Uya needs Ugh-
  lomi," cried the old woman, standing on the left of the bend, a gesticulating
  figure of flaring bronze in the sunset. Her cries were strange sounds,
  flitting to and fro on the borderland of speech, but this was the sense they
  carried: "The lion needs Eudena. He comes night after night seeking Eudena
  and Ugh-lomi. When he cannot find Eudena and Ugh-lomi, he grows angry and he
  kills.</p>

  <p>Hunt Eudena and Ugh-lomi, Eudena whom he pursued, and Ugh-lomi for whom he
  gave the death-word! Hunt Eudena and Ugh-lomi!"</p>

  <p>She turned to the distant reed-bed, as sometimes she had turned to Uya in
  his life. "Is it not so, my lord?" she cried. And, as if in answer, the tall
  reeds bowed before a breath of wind.</p>

  <p>Far into the twilight the sound of hacking was heard from the squatting-
  places. It was the men sharpening their ashen spears against the hunting of
  the morrow. And in the night, early before the moon rose, the lion came and
  took the girl of Siss the Tracker.</p>

  <p>In the morning before the sun had risen, Siss the Tracker, and the lad
  Wau-hau, who now chipped flints, and One Eye, and Bo, and the snail-eater,
  the two red-haired men, and Cat's-skin and Snake, all the men that were left
  alive of the Sons of Uya, taking their ash spears and their smiting-stones,
  and with throwing stones in the beast-paw bags, started forth upon the trail
  of Ugh-lomi through the hawthorn thickets where Yaaa the Rhinoceros and his
  brothers were feeding, and up the bare downland towards the beechwoods.</p>

  <p>That night the fires burnt high and fierce, as the waxing moon set, and
  the lion left the crouching women and children in peace.</p>

  <p>And the next day, while the sun was still high, the hunters returned
  &mdash;all save One Eye, who lay dead with a smashed skull at the foot of the
  ledge. (When Ugh-lomi came back that evening from stalking the horses, he
  found the vultures already busy over him.) And with them the hunters brought
  Eudena bruised and wounded, but alive. That had been the strange order of the
  shrivelled old woman, that she was to be brought alive&mdash;"She is no kill
  for us. She is for Uya the Lion." Her hands were tied with thongs, as though
  she had been a man, and she came weary and drooping&mdash;her hair over her
  eyes and matted with blood. They walked about her, and ever and again the
  Snail-Eater, whose name she had given, would laugh and strike her with his
  ashen spear. And after he had struck her with his spear, he would look over
  his shoulder like one who had done an over-bold deed. The others, too, looked
  over their shoulders ever and again, and all were in a hurry save Eudena.
  When the old woman saw them coming, she cried aloud with joy.</p>

  <p>They made Eudena cross the river with her hands tied, although the current
  was strong, and when she slipped the old woman screamed, first with joy and
  then for fear she might be drowned. And when they had dragged Eudena to
  shore, she could not stand for a time, albeit they beat her sore. So they let
  her sit with her feet touching the water, and her eyes staring before her,
  and her face set, whatever they might do or say. All the tribe came down to
  the squatting-place, even curly little Haha, who as yet could scarcely
  toddle, and stood staring at Eudena and the old woman, as now we should stare
  at some strange wounded beast and its captor.</p>

  <p>The old woman tore off the necklace of Uya that was about Eudena's neck,
  and put it on herself&mdash;she had been the first to wear it. Then she tore
  at Eudena's hair, and took a spear from Siss and beat her with all her might.
  And when she had vented the warmth of her heart on the girl she looked
  closely into her face. Eudena's eyes were closed and her features were set,
  and she lay so still that for a moment the old woman feared she was dead
  until her nostrils quivered. At that the old woman slapped her face and
  laughed and gave the spear to Siss again, and went a little way off from her
  and began to talk and jeer at her after her manner.</p>

  <p>The old woman had more words than any in the tribe. And her talk was a
  terrible thing to hear. Sometimes she screamed and moaned incoherently, and
  sometimes the shape of her guttural cries was the mere phantom of thoughts.
  But she conveyed to Eudena, nevertheless, much of the things that were yet to
  come, of the Lion and of the torment he would do her. "And Ugh&mdash;lomi!
  Ha, ha! Ugh-lomi was slain?"</p>

  <p>And suddenly Eudena's eyes opened and she sat up again, and her look met
  the old woman's fair and level. "No," she said slowly, like one trying to
  remember, "I did not see my Ugh-lomi slain. I did not see my Ugh-lomi
  slain."</p>

  <p>"Tell her," cried the old woman. "Tell her&mdash;he that killed him. Tell
  her how Ugh-lomi was slain."</p>

  <p>She looked, and all the women and children there looked, from man to
  man.</p>

  <p>None answered her. They stood shamefaced.</p>

  <p>"Tell her," said the old woman. The men looked at one another.</p>

  <p>Eudena's face suddenly lit.</p>

  <p>"Tell her," she said. "Tell her mighty men! Tell her the killing of Ugh-
  lomi."</p>

  <p>The old woman rose and struck her sharply across her mouth.</p>

  <p>"We could not find Ugh-lomi," said Siss the Tracker, slowly. "Who hunts
  two, kills none."</p>

  <p>Then Eudena's heart leapt, but she kept her face hard. It was well, for
  the old woman looked at her sharply, with murder in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Then the old woman turned her tongue upon the men because they had feared
  to go on after Ugh-lomi. She dreaded no one now Uya was slain. She scolded
  them as one scolds children. And they scowled at her, and began to accuse one
  another. Until suddenly Siss the Tracker raised his voice and bade her hold
  her peace.</p>

  <p>And so when the sun was setting they took Eudena and went&mdash;though
  their hearts sank within them&mdash;along the trail the old lion had made in
  the reeds. All the men went together. At one place was a group of alders, and
  here they hastily bound Eudena where the lion might find her when he came
  abroad in the twilight, and having done so they hurried back until they were
  near the squatting-place. Then they stopped. Siss stopped first and looked
  back again at the alders. They could see her head even from the
  squatting-place, a little black shock under the limb of the larger tree. That
  was as well.</p>

  <p>All the women and children stood watching upon the crest of the mound. And
  the old woman stood and screamed for the lion to take her whom he sought, and
  counselled him on the torments he might do her.</p>

  <p>Eudena was very weary now, stunned by beatings and fatigue and sorrow, and
  only the fear of the thing that was still to come upheld her. The sun was
  broad and blood-red between the stems of the distant chestnuts, and the west
  was all on fire; the evening breeze had died to a warm tranquillity. The air
  was full of midge swarms, the fish in the river hard by would leap at times,
  and now and again a cockchafer would drone through the air. Out of the corner
  of her eye Eudena could see a part of the squatting-knoll, and little figures
  standing and staring at her. And&mdash;a very little sound but very clear
  &mdash;she could hear the beating of the firestone. Dark and near to her and
  very still was the reed-fringed thicket of the lair.</p>

  <p>She began to weep silently, for this and the gorge was all the life she
  had known, and life had been a pleasant thing to her. Presently the firestone
  ceased. She looked for the sun and found he had gone, and overhead and
  growing brighter was the waxing moon. She looked towards the thicket of the
  lair, seeking shapes in the reeds, and then suddenly she began to wriggle and
  wriggle, weeping and calling upon Ugh-lomi.</p>

  <p>But Ugh-lomi was far away. When they saw her head moving with her
  struggles, they shouted together on the knoll, and then she desisted and was
  still. And then came the bats, and the star that was like Ugh-lomi crept out
  of its blue hiding-place in the west. She called to it, but softly, because
  she feared the lion. And all through the coming of the twilight the thicket
  was still.</p>

  <p>So the dark crept upon Eudena, and the moon grew bright, and the shadows
  of things that had fled up the hillside and vanished with the evening came
  back to them short and black, And the dark shapes in the thicket of reeds and
  alders where the lion lay, gathered, and a faint stir began there. But
  nothing came out therefrom all through the gathering of the darkness.</p>

  <p>She looked at the squatting-place and saw the fires glowing smoky-red, and
  the men and women going to and fro. The other way, over the river, a white
  mist was rising. Then far away came the whimpering of young foxes and the
  yell of a hy&aelig;na.</p>

  <p>There were long gaps of aching waiting. After a long time some animal
  splashed in the water, and seemed to cross the river at the ford beyond the
  lair, but what animal it was she could not see. From the distant
  drinking-pools she could hear the sound of splashing, and the noise of
  elephants&mdash;so still was the night.</p>

  <p>The earth was now a colourless arrangement of white reflections and
  impenetrable shadows, under the blue sky. The silvery moon was already
  spotted with the filigree crests of the chestnut woods, and over the shadowy
  eastward bills the stars were multiplying. The knoll fires were bright red
  now, and black figures stood waiting against them. They were waiting for a
  scream...Surely it would be soon.</p>

  <p>The night suddenly seemed full of movement. She held her breath. Things
  were passing&mdash;one, two, three&mdash;subtly sneaking shadows...
  Jackals.</p>

  <p>Then a long waiting again.</p>

  <p>Then, asserting itself as real at once over all the sounds her mind had
  imagined, came a stir in the thicket, then a vigorous movement. There was a
  snap. The reeds crashed heavily, once, twice, thrice, and then everything was
  still save a measured swishing. She heard a low tremulous growl, and then
  everything was still again. The stillness lengthened&mdash;would it never
  end? She held her breath; she bit her lips to stop screaming. Then something
  scuttled through tile undergrowth. Her scream was involuntary.</p>

  <p>She did not hear the answering yell from the mound.</p>

  <p>Immediately the thicket woke up to vigorous movement again. She saw the
  grass stems waving in the light of the setting moon, the alders swaying. She
  struggled violently&mdash;her last struggle. But nothing came towards her. A
  dozen monsters seemed rushing about in that little place for a couple of
  minutes, and then again came silence. The moon sank behind the distant
  chestnuts and the night was dark.</p>

  <p>Then an odd sound, a sobbing panting, that grew faster and fainter. Yet
  another silence, and then dim sounds and the grunting of some animal.</p>

  <p>Everything was still again. Far away eastwards an elephant trumpeted, and
  from the woods came a snarling and yelping that died away.</p>

  <p>In the long interval the moon shone out again, between the stems of the
  trees on the ridge, sending two great bars of light and a bar of darkness
  across the reedy waste. Then came a steady rustling, a splash, and the reeds
  swayed wider and wider apart. And at last they broke open, cleft from root to
  crest...The end had come.</p>

  <p>She looked to see the thing that had come out of the reeds. For a moment
  it seemed certainly the great head and jaw she expected, and then it dwindled
  and changed. It was a dark low thing, that remained silent, but it was not
  the lion. It became still&mdash;everything became still. She peered. It was
  like some gigantic frog, two limbs and a slanting body. Its head moved about
  searching the shadows...</p>

  <p>A rustle, and it moved clumsily, with a sort of hopping. And as it moved
  it gave a low groan.</p>

  <p>The blood rushing through her veins was suddenly joy. "Ugh-lomi!" she
  whispered.</p>

  <p>The thing stopped. "Eudena," he answered softly with pain in his voice,
  and peering into the alders.</p>

  <p>He moved again, and came out of the shadow beyond the reeds into the
  moonlight. All his body was covered with dark smears. She saw he was dragging
  his legs, and that he gripped his axe, the first axe, in one hand. In another
  moment he had struggled into the position of all fours, and had staggered
  over to her. "The lion," he said in a strange mingling of exultation and
  anguish. "Wau!&mdash;I have slain a lion. With my own hand. Even as I slew
  the great bear." He moved to emphasise his words, and suddenly broke off with
  a faint cry. For a space he did not move.</p>

  <p>"Let me free," whispered Eudena...</p>

  <p>He answered her no words but pulled himself up from his crawling attitude
  by means of the alder stem, and hacked at her thongs with the sharp edge of
  his axe. She heard him sob at each blow. He cut away the thongs about her
  chest and arms, and then his hand dropped. His chest struck against her
  shoulder and he slipped down beside her and lay still.</p>

  <p>But the rest of her release was easy. Very hastily she freed herself. She
  made one step from the tree, and her head was spinning, Her last conscious
  movement was towards him. She reeled, and suddenly fell headlong beside him.
  Her hand fell upon his thigh. It was soft and wet, and gave way under her
  pressure; he cried out at her touch, and writhed and lay still again, with
  her hand upon him.</p>

  <p>Presently a dark dog-like shape came very softly through the reeds. This
  stopped dead and stood sniffing, hesitated, and at last turned and slunk back
  into the shadows.</p>

  <p>Long was the time they remained there motionless, with the light of the
  setting moon shining on their limbs. Very slowly, as slowly as the setting of
  the moon, did the shadow of the reeds towards the mound flow over them.
  Presently their legs were hidden, and Ugh-lomi was but a bust of silver. The
  shadow crept to his neck, crept over his face, and so at last the darkness of
  the night swallowed them up.</p>

  <p>The shadow became full of instinctive stirrings. There was a patter of
  feet, and a faint snarling&mdash;the sound of a blow.</p>

  <p>There was little sleep that night for the women and children at the
  squatting-place until they heard Eudena scream. But the men were weary and
  sat dozing. When Eudena screamed they felt assured of their safety, and
  hurried to get the nearest places to the fires. The old woman laughed at the
  scream, and laughed again because Si, the little sister of Eudena, whimpered.
  Directly the dawn came they were all alert and looking towards the alders.
  They could see that Eudena had been taken. They could not help feeling glad
  to think that Uya was appeased. But across the minds of the men the thought
  of Ugh-lomi fell like a shadow. They could understand revenge, for the world
  was old in revenge, but they did not think of rescue. Suddenly a hy&aelig;na
  fled out of the thicket, and came galloping across the reed space. His muzzle
  and paws were dark-stained. At that sight all the men shouted and clutched at
  throwing-stones and ran towards him, for no animal is so pitiful a coward as
  the hy&aelig;na by day. All men hated the hy&aelig;na because he preyed on
  children, and would come and bite when one was sleeping on the edge of the
  squatting-place. And Cat's-skin, throwing fair and straight, hit the brute
  shrewdly on the flank, whereat the whole tribe yelled with delight.</p>

  <p>At the noise they made there came a flapping of wings from the lair of the
  lion, and three white-headed vultures rose slowly and circled and came to
  rest amidst the branches of an alder, overlooking the lair. "Our lord is
  abroad," said the old woman, pointing. "The vultures have their share of
  Eudena." For a space they remained there, and then first one and then another
  dropped back into the thicket.</p>

  <p>Then over the eastern woods, and touching the whole world to life and
  colour, poured, with the exaltation of a trumpet blast, the light of the
  rising sun. At the sight of him the children shouted together, and clapped
  their hands and began to race off towards the water. Only little Si lagged
  behind and looked wonderingly at the alders where she had seen the head of
  Eudena overnight.</p>

  <p>But Uya, the old lion, was not abroad but at home, and he lay very still,
  and a little on one side. He was not in his lair, but a little way from it in
  a place of trampled grass. Under one eye was a little wound, the feeble
  little bite of the first axe. But all the ground beneath his chest was ruddy
  brown with a vivid streak, and in his chest was a little hole that had been
  made by Ugh-lomi's stabbing-spear. Along his side and at his neck the
  vultures had marked their claims. For so Ugh-lomi had slain him, lying
  stricken under his paw and thrusting haphazard at his chest. He had driven
  the spear in with all his strength and stabbed the giant to the heart. So it
  was the reign of the lion, of the second incarnation of Uya the Master, came
  to an end.</p>

  <p>From the knoll the bustle of preparation grew, the hacking of spears and
  throwing-stones. None spake the name of Ugh-lomi for fear that it might bring
  him. The men were going to keep together, close together, in the hunting for
  a day or so. And, their hunting was to be Ugh-lomi, lest instead he should
  come a-hunting them.</p>

  <p>But Ugh-lomi was lying very still and silent, outside the lion's lair, and
  Eudena squatted beside him, with the ash spear, all smeared with lion's
  blood, gripped in her hand.</p>

  5. THE FIGHT IN THE LION'S THICKET</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Idler</i>, September 1897</h3>

  <p>Ugh-Lomi lay still, his back against an alder, and his thigh was a red
  mass terrible to see. No civilised man could have lived who had been so
  sorely wounded, but Eudena got him thorns to close his wounds, and squatted
  beside him day and night, smiting the flies from him with a fan of reeds by
  day, and in the night threatening the hy&aelig;nas who came too near with the
  first axe in her hand; and in a little while he began to heal. It was high
  summer, and there was no rain. Little food they had during the first two days
  his wounds were open. In the low place where they hid were no roots nor
  little beasts, and the stream, with its water-snails and fish, was, in the
  open a hundred yards away. She could not go abroad by day for fear of the
  tribe, her brothers and sisters, nor by night for fear of the beasts, both on
  his account and hers. So they shared the lion with the vultures. But there
  was a trickle of water near by, and Eudena brought him plenty in her
  hands.</p>

  <p>Where Ugh-lomi lay was well hidden from the tribe by a thicket of alders,
  and all fenced about with bulrushes and tall reeds. The dead lion he had
  killed lay near his old lair on a place of trampled reeds fifty yards away,
  in sight through the reed-stems, and the vultures fought each other for the
  choicest pieces and kept the jackals off him. Very soon a cloud of flies that
  looked like bees hung over him, and Ugh-lomi could hear their humming. And
  when Ugh-lomi's flesh was already healing&mdash;and it was not many days
  before that began&mdash;only a few bones of the lion remained scattered and
  shining white.</p>

  <p>For the most part Ugh-lomi sat still during the day, looking before him at
  nothing, sometimes he would mutter of the horses and bears and lions, and
  sometimes he would beat the ground with the first axe and say the names of
  the tribe&mdash;he seemed to have no fear of bringing the tribe&mdash;for
  hours together. But chiefly he slept, dreaming little because of his loss of
  blood and the slightness of his food. During the short summer night both kept
  awake. All the while the darkness lasted things moved about them, things they
  never saw by day. For some nights the hy&aelig;nas did not come, and then one
  moonless night near a dozen came and fought for what was left of the lion.
  The night was a tumult of growling, and Ugh-lomi and Eudena could hear the
  bones snap in their teeth. But they knew the hy&aelig;na dare not attack any
  creature alive and awake, and so they were not greatly afraid.</p>

  <p>Of a daytime Eudena would go along the narrow path the old lion had made
  in the reeds until she was beyond the bend, and then she would creep into the
  thicket and watch the tribe. She would lie close by the alders where they had
  bound her to offer her up to the lion, and thence she could see them on the
  knoll by the fire, little and clear, as she had seen them that night. But she
  told Ugh-lomi little of what she saw, because she feared to bring them by
  their names. For so they believed in those days, that naming called.</p>

  <p>She saw the men prepare stabbing-spears and throwing-stones on the morning
  after Ugh-lomi had slain the lion, and go out to hunt him, leaving the women
  and children on the knoll. Little they knew how near he was as they tracked
  off in single file towards the hills, with Siss the Tracker leading them. And
  she watched the women and children, after the men had gone, gathering
  fern-fronds and twigs for the night fire, and the boys and girls running and
  playing together. But the very old woman made her feel afraid. After a long
  space towards noon, when most of the others were down at the stream by the
  bend, she came and stood on the hither side of the knoll, a gnarled brown
  figure, and gesticulated so that Eudena could scarce believe she was not
  seen. Eudena lay like a hare in its form, with shining eyes fixed on the bent
  witch away there, and presently she dimly understood it was the lion the old
  woman was worshipping&mdash;the lion Ugh-lomi had slain.</p>

  <p>And the next day the hunters came back weary, carrying a fawn, and Eudena
  watched the feast enviously. And then came a strange thing. She
  saw&mdash;distinctly she heard&mdash;the old woman shrieking and
  gesticulating and pointing towards her. She was afraid, and crept like a
  snake out of sight again. But presently curiosity overcame her and she was
  back at her spying-place, and as she peered her heart stopped, for there were
  all the men, with their weapons in their hands, walking together towards her
  from the knoll.</p>

  <p>She dared not move lest her movement should be seen, but she pressed
  herself close to the ground. The sun was low and the golden light was in the
  faces of the men. She saw they carried a piece of rich red meat thrust
  through by an ashen stake. Presently they stopped. "Go on!" screamed the old
  woman. Cat's-skin grumbled, and they came on, searching the thicket with
  sun-dazzled eyes. "Here!" said Siss. And they took the ashen stake with the
  meat upon it and thrust it into the ground. "Uya!" cried Siss, "behold thy
  portion. And Ugh-lomi we have slain. Of a truth we have slain Ugh-lomi. This
  day we slew Ugh-lomi, and to-morrow we will bring his body to you." And the
  others repeated the words.</p>

  <p>They looked at each other and behind them, and partly turned and began
  going back. At first they walked half turned to the thicket, then facing the
  mound they walked faster, looking over their shoulders, then faster; soon
  they ran, it was a race at last, until they were near the knoll. Then Siss
  who was hindmost was first to slacken his pace.</p>

  <p>The sunset passed and the twilight came, the fires glowed red against the
  hazy blue of the distant chestnut trees, and the voices over the mound were
  merry. Eudena lay scarcely stirring, looking from the mound to the meat and
  then to the mound. She was hungry, but she was afraid. At last she crept back
  to Ugh-lomi.</p>

  <p>He looked round at the little rustle of her approach. His face was in
  shadow. "Have you got me some food?" he said.</p>

  <p>She said she could find nothing, but that she would seek further, and went
  back along the lion's path until she could see the mound again, but she could
  not bring herself to take the meat; she had the brute's instinct of a snare.
  She felt very miserable.</p>

  <p>She crept back at last towards Ugh-lomi and heard him stirring and
  moaning. She turned back to the mound again; then she saw something in the
  darkness near the stake, and peering distinguished a jackal. In a flash she
  was brave and angry; she sprang up, cried out, and ran towards the offering.
  She stumbled and fell, and heard the growling of the jackal going off.</p>

  <p>When she arose only the ashen stake lay on the ground, the meat was gone.
  So she went back, to fast through the night with Ugh-lomi; and Ugh-lomi was
  angry with her, because she had no food for him; but she told him nothing of
  the things she had seen.</p>

  <p>Two days passed and they were near starving, when the tribe slew a horse.
  Then came the same ceremony, and a haunch was left on the ashen stake; but
  this time Eudena did not hesitate.</p>

  <p>By acting and words she made Ugh-lomi understand, but he ate most of the
  food before he understood; and then he grew merry with his food. "I am Uya,"
  he said; "I am the Lion. I am the Great Cave Bear, I who was only Ugh-lomi. I
  am Wau the Cunning. It is well that they should feed me, for presently I will
  kill them all."</p>

  <p>Then Eudena's heart was light, and she laughed with him; and afterwards
  she ate what he had left of the horseflesh with gladness.</p>

  <p>After that it was he had a dream, and the next day he made Eudena bring
  him the lion's teeth and claws&mdash;so much of them as she could find
  &mdash;and hack him a club of alder, and he put the teeth and claws very
  cunningly into the wood so that the points were outward. Very long it took
  him, and he blunted two of the teeth hammering them in, and was very angry
  and threw the thing away; but afterwards he dragged himself to where he had
  thrown it and finished it&mdash;a club of a new sort set with teeth. That day
  there was more meat for them both, an offering to the lion from the
  tribe.</p>

  <p>It was one day&mdash;more than a hand's fingers of days, more than anyone
  has skill to count&mdash;after Ugh-lomi had made the club, that Eudena while
  he was asleep was lying in the thicket watching the squatting-place. There
  had been no meat for three days. And the old woman came and worshipped after
  her manner. Now while she worshipped, Eudena's little sister Si and another,
  the child of the first girl Siss had loved, came over the knoll and stood
  regarding her skinny figure, and presently they began to mock her. Eudena
  found this entertaining, but suddenly the old woman turned on them quickly
  and saw them. For a moment she stood and they stood motionless, and then with
  a shriek of rage she rushed towards them, and all three disappeared over the
  crest of the knoll.</p>

  <p>Presently the children reappeared among the ferns over the shoulder of the
  hill. Little Si ran first, for she was an active girl, and the other child
  ran squealing with the old woman close upon her. And over the knoll came Siss
  with a bone in his hand, and Ba and Cat's-skin obsequiously behind him, each
  holding a piece of food, and they laughed aloud and shouted to see the old
  woman so angry. And with a shriek the child was caught and the old woman set
  to work slapping and the child screaming, and it was very good after-dinner
  fun for them. Little Si ran on a little way and stopped at last between fear
  and curiosity.</p>

  <p>And suddenly came the mother of the child, with hair streaming, panting,
  and with a stone in her hand, and the old woman turned about like a wild cat.
  She was the equal of any woman, was the old chief of the fire-minders, in
  spite of her years; but before she could do anything Siss shouted to her and
  the clamour rose loud. Other shock heads came into sight. It seemed the whole
  tribe was at home and feasting. But the old woman dared not go on wreaking
  herself on the child Siss befriended. Nevertheless it was a fine row.</p>

  <p>Everyone made noises and called names, even little Si. Abruptly the old
  woman let go of the child she had caught and made a swift run at Si who had
  no friends; and Si, realising her danger when it was almost upon her, with a
  faint cry of terror made off headlong, not heeding whither she ran, straight
  to the lair of the lion. She swerved aside into the reeds presently, not
  realising whither she went.</p>

  <p>But the old woman was a wonderful old woman, as active as she was
  spiteful, and she caught Si by the streaming hair within thirty yards of
  Eudena. All the tribe now was running down the knoll and shouting, ready to
  see the fun.</p>

  <p>Then something stirred in Eudena and, thinking all of little Si and
  nothing of her fear, she sprang up from her ambush and ran swiftly forward.
  The old woman did not see her, for she was busy beating little Si's face with
  her hand, beating with all her heart, and suddenly something hard and heavy
  struck her cheek. She went reeling, and saw Eudena with flaming eyes and
  cheeks between her and little Si. She shrieked with astonishment and terror,
  and little Si, not understanding, set off towards the gaping tribe. They were
  quite close now, for the sight of Eudena had driven their fading fear of the
  lion out of their heads.</p>

  <p>In a moment Eudena had turned from the cowering old woman and overtaken
  Si. "Si!" she cried, "Si!" She caught the child up in her arms as it stopped,
  pressed the nail-lined face to hers, and turned about to run towards her
  lair, the lair of the old lion. The old woman stood waist high in the reeds,
  and screamed foul things and inarticulate rage, but did not dare to intercept
  her; and at the bend of the path Eudena looked back and saw all the men of
  the tribe crying to one another and Siss coming at a trot along the lion's
  trail.</p>

  <p>She ran straight along the narrow way through the reeds to the shady place
  where Ugh-lomi sat with his healing thigh, just awakened by the shouting and
  rubbing his eyes. She came to him, a woman, with little Si in her arms. Her
  heart throbbed in her throat. "Ugh-lomi!" she cried, "Ugh-lomi, the tribe
  comes!"</p>

  <p>Ugh-lomi sat staring in stupid astonishment at her and Si.</p>

  <p>She pointed with Si in one arm. She sought among her feeble store of words
  to explain. She could hear the men calling. Apparently they had stopped
  outside. She put down Si and caught up the new club with the lion's teeth,
  and put it into Ugh-lomi's hand, and ran three yards and picked up the first
  axe.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Ugh-lomi, waving the new club, and suddenly he perceived the
  occasion and, rolling over, began to struggle to his feet.</p>

  <p>He stood, but clumsily. He supported himself by one hand against the tree,
  and just touched the ground gingerly with the toe of his wounded leg. In the
  other hand he gripped the new club. He looked at his healing thigh; and
  suddenly the reeds began whispering, and ceased and whispered again, and
  coming cautiously along the track among the reeds, bending down and holding
  his fire-hardened stabbing-stick of ash in his hand, appeared Siss. He
  stopped dead, and his eyes met Ugh-lomi's.</p>

  <p>Ugh-lomi forgot he had a wounded leg. He stood firmly on both feet.
  Something trickled. He glanced down and saw a little gout of blood had oozed
  out along the edge of the healing wound. He rubbed his hand there to give him
  the grip of his club, and fixed his eyes again on Siss. The fighting spirit
  now swiftly and suddenly overflowed.</p>

  <p>"Wau!" he cried, and sprang forward, and Siss, still stooping and
  watchful, drove his stabbing-stick up very quickly in an ugly thrust. It
  ripped Ugh-lomi's guarding arm and the club came down in a counter that Siss
  was never to understand. He fell, as an ox falls to the pole-axe, at
  Ugh-lomi's feet.</p>

  <p>To Bo it seemed the strangest thing. He had a comforting sense of tall
  reeds on either side, and an impregnable rampart, Siss, between him and any
  danger. Snail-eater was close behind and there was no danger there. He was
  prepared to shove behind and send Siss to death or victory. That was his
  place as second man. He saw the butt of the spear Siss carried leap away from
  him, and suddenly a dull whack and the broad back fell away forward, and he
  looked Ugh-lomi in the face over his prostrate leader. It felt to Bo as if
  his heart had fallen down a well. He had a throwing-stone in one hand and an
  ashen stabbing-stick in the other. He did not live to the end of his
  momentary hesitation which to use.</p>

  <p>Snail-eater was a readier man, and besides Bo did not fall forward as Siss
  had done, but gave at his knees and hips, crumpling up with the toothed club
  upon his head, smiting him down. The Snail-eater drove his spear forward
  swift and straight, and took Ugh-lomi in the muscle of the shoulder, and then
  he drove him hard with the smiting-stone in his other and, shouting out as he
  did so. The new club swished ineffectually through the reeds. Eudena saw Ugh-
  lomi come staggering back from the narrow path into the open space, tripping
  over Siss and with a foot of ashen stake sticking out of him over his arm,
  and then the Snail-eater, whose name she had given, had his final injury from
  her, as his exultant face came out of the reeds after his spear. For she
  swung the first axe swift and high, and hit him fair and square on the
  temple; and down he went on Siss at prostrate Ugh-lomi's feet.</p>

  <p>But before Ugh-lomi could get to his feet, the two red-haired men were
  tumbling out of the reeds, spears and smiting-stones ready, and Snake hard
  behind them. One she struck on the neck, but not to fell him, and he
  blundered aside and spoilt his brother's blow at Ugh-lomi's head. In a moment
  Ugh-lomi dropped his club and had his assailant by the waist, and had pitched
  him sideways sprawling. He snatched at his club again and recovered it. The
  man Eudena had hit stabbed at her with his spear as he stumbled from her
  blow, and involuntarily she gave ground to avoid him. He hesitated between
  her and Ugh-lomi, half turned, gave a vague cry at finding Ugh-lomi so near,
  and in a moment Ugh-lomi had him by the throat, and the club had its third
  victim. As he went down Ugh-lomi shouted&mdash;no words, but an exultant
  cry.</p>

  <p>The other red-haired man was six feet from her with his back to her, and a
  darker red streaking his head. He was struggling to his feet. She had an
  irrational impulse to stop his rising. She flung the axe at him, missed, saw
  his face in profile, and he had swerved beyond little Si, and was running
  through the reeds. She had a transitory vision of Snake standing in the
  throat of the path, half turned away from her, and then she saw his back. She
  saw the club whirling through the air, and the shock head of Ugh-lomi, with
  blood in the hair and blood upon the shoulder, vanishing below the reeds in
  pursuit. Then she heard Snake scream like a woman.</p>

  <p>She ran past Si to where the handle of the axe stuck out of a clump of
  fern, and turning, found herself panting and alone with three motionless
  bodies. The air was full of shouts and screams. For a space she was sick and
  giddy, and then it came into her head that Ugh-lomi was being killed along
  the reed-path, and with an inarticulate cry she leapt over the body of Bo and
  hurried after him. Snake's feet lay across the path, and his head was among
  the reeds. She followed the path until it bent round and opened out by the
  alders, and thence she saw all that was left of the tribe in the open,
  scattering like dead leaves before a gale, and going back over the knoll.
  Ugh-lomi was hard upon Cat's-skin.</p>

  <p>But Cat's-skin was fleet of foot and got away, and so did young Wau-Hau
  when Ugh-lomi turned upon him, and Ugh-lomi pursued Wau-Hau far beyond the
  knoll before he desisted. He had the rage of battle on him now, and the wood
  thrust through his shoulder stung him like a spear. When she saw he was in no
  danger she stopped running and stood panting, watching the distant active
  figures run up and vanish one by one over the knoll. In a little time she was
  alone again. Everything had happened very swiftly. The smoke of Brother Fire
  rose straight and steady from the squatting-place, just as it had done ten
  minutes ago, when the old woman had stood yonder worshipping the lion.</p>

  <p>And after a long time, as it seemed, Ugh-lomi re-appeared over the knoll,
  and came back to Eudena, triumphant and breathing heavily. She stood, her
  hair about her eyes and hot-faced, with the blood-stained axe in her hand, at
  the place where the tribe had offered her as a sacrifice to the lion. "Wau!"
  cried Ugh-lomi at the sight of her, his face alight with the fellowship of
  battle, and he waved his new club, red now and hairy; and at the sight of his
  glowing face her tense pose relaxed somewhat, and she stood weeping and
  rejoicing.</p>

  <p>Ugh-lomi had a queer unaccountable pang at the sight of her tears; but he
  only shouted "Wau!" the louder and shook the axe east and west. He called to
  her to follow him and turned back, striding, with the club swinging in his
  hand, towards the squatting-place, as if he had never left the tribe; and she
  stopped weeping and followed as a woman should.</p>

  <p>So Ugh-lomi and Eudena came back to the squatting-place from which they
  had fled many days before from the face of Uya; and by the squatting-place
  lay a deer half eaten, just as there had been before Ugh-lomi was man or
  Eudena woman. So Ugh-lomi sat down to eat, and Eudena beside him like a man,
  and the rest of the tribe watched them from safe hiding-places. And after a
  time one of the elder girls came back timorously and carrying little Si in
  her arms, and Eudena called to them by name, and offered them food. But the
  elder girl was afraid and would not come, though Si struggled to come to
  Eudena. Afterwards, when Ugh-lomi had eaten, he sat dozing, and at last he
  slept, and slowly the others came out of the hiding-places and drew near. And
  when Ugh-lomi woke, save that there were no men to be seen, it seemed as
  though he had never left the tribe.</p>

  <p>Cat's-skin and the second red-haired man and Wau-Hau, who chipped flints
  cunningly, as his father had done before him, fled from the face of Ugh-lomi,
  and none knew where they hid. But two days after they came and squatted among
  the bracken under the chestnuts a good way off from the knoll and watched.
  Ugh-lomi's rage had gone, he moved to go against them and did not, and at
  sundown they went away. That day, too, they found the old woman among the
  ferns, where Ugh-lomi had blundered upon her when he had pursued Wau-Hau. She
  was dead and more ugly than ever, but whole. The jackals and vultures had
  tried her and left her; she was ever a wonderful old woman.</p>

  <p>The next day the three men came again and squatted nearer, and Wau-Hau had
  two rabbits to hold up, and the red-haired man a wood-pigeon, and Ugh-Lomi
  stood before their women and mocked them.</p>

  <p>The next day they sat again nearer&mdash;without stones or sticks, and
  with the same offerings, and Cat's-skin had a trout.</p>

  <p>It was rare men caught fish in those days but Cat's-skin would stand
  silently in the water for hours and catch them with his hand. And the fourth
  day Ugh-lomi suffered these three to come to the squatting-place in peace,
  with the food they had with them.</p>

  <p>Now, there is a thing strange but true: that all through this fight Ugh-
  lomi forgot that he was lame, and was not lame, and after he had rested
  behold! he was a lame man; and he remained a lame man to the end of his
  days.</p>

  <p>So it was Ugh-lomi became Uya and the Lion, and had his will in all things
  among the children of Uya.</p>

  <p>And of his rule among them and of the changing of the squatting-place
  there is a story still to come.</p>

  1. THE CURE FOR LOVE</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>, June 1897</h3>

  <p>The excellent Mr. Morris was an Englishman, and he lived in the days of
  Queen Victoria the Good. He was a prosperous and very sensible man; he read
  The Times and went to church, and as he grew towards middle age an expression
  of quiet contented contempt for all who were not as himself settled on his
  face. He was one of those people who do everything that is right and proper
  and sensible with inevitable regularity. He always wore just the right and
  proper clothes, steering the narrow way between the smart and the shabby,
  always subscribed to the right charities, just the judicious compromise
  between ostentation and meanness, and never failed to have his hair cut to
  exactly the proper length.</p>

  <p>Everything that it was right and proper for a man in his position to
  possess, he possessed; and everything that it was not right and proper for a
  man in his position to possess, he did not possess.</p>

  <p>And among other right and proper possessions, this Mr. Morris had a wife
  and children. They were the right sort of wife, and the right sort and number
  of children, of course; nothing imaginative or highty-flighty about any of
  them, so far as Mr. Morris could see; they wore perfectly correct clothing,
  neither smart nor hygienic nor faddy in any way, but just sensible; and they
  lived in a nice sensible house in the later Victorian sham Queen Anne style
  of architecture, with sham half-timbering of chocolate-painted plaster in the
  gables, Lincrusta Walton sham carved oak panels, a terrace of terra cotta to
  imitate stone, and cathedral glass in the front door. His boys went to good
  solid schools, and were put to respectable professions; his girls, in spite
  of a fantastic protest or so, were all married to suitable, steady, oldish
  young men with good prospects. And when it was a fit and proper thing for him
  to do so, Mr. Morris died. His tomb was of marble and, without any art
  nonsense or laudatory inscription, quietly imposing&mdash;such being the
  fashion of his time.</p>

  <p>He underwent various changes according to the accepted custom in these
  cases, and long before this story begins his bones even had become dust, and
  were scattered to the four quarters of heaven. And his sons and his grandsons
  and his great-grandsons and his great-great-grandsons, they too were dust and
  ashes, and were scattered likewise. It was a thing he could not have
  imagined, that a day would come when even his great-great-grandsons would be
  scattered to the four winds of heaven. If any one had suggested it to him he
  would have resented it. He was one of those worthy people who take no
  interest in the future of mankind at all. He had grave doubts indeed, if
  there was any future for mankind after he was dead.</p>

  <p>It seemed quite impossible and quite uninteresting to imagine anything
  happening after he was dead. Yet the thing was so, and when even his great-
  great-grandson was dead and decayed and forgotten, when the sham
  half-timbered house had gone the way of all shams, and The Times was extinct,
  and the silk hat a ridiculous antiquity, and the modestly imposing stone that
  had been sacred to Mr. Morris had been burnt to make lime for mortar, and all
  that Mr. Morris had found real and important was sere and dead, the world was
  still going on, and people were still going about it, just as heedless and
  impatient of the Future or, indeed, of anything but their own selves and
  property, as Mr. Morris had been.</p>

  <p>And, strange to tell, and much as Mr. Morris would have been angered if
  any one had foreshadowed it to him, all over the world there scattered a
  multitude of people, filled with the breath of life, in whose veins the blood
  of Mr. Morris flowed. Just as some day the life which is gathered now in the
  reader of this very story may also be scattered far and wide about this
  world, and mingled with a thousand alien strains, beyond all thought and
  tracing.</p>

  <p>And among the descendants of this Mr. Morris was one almost as sensible
  and clear-headed as his ancestor. He had just the same stout, short frame as
  that ancient man of the nineteenth century, from whom his name of Morris
  &mdash;he spelt it Mwres&mdash;came; he had the same half-contemptuous
  expression of face. He was a prosperous person too, as times went, and he
  disliked the "new-fangled," and bothers about the future and the lower
  classes, just as much as the ancestral Morris had done. He did not read The
  Times: indeed, he did not know there ever had been a Times&mdash;that
  institution had foundered somewhere in the intervening gulf of years; but the
  phonograph machine, that talked to him as he made his toilet of a morning,
  might have been the voice of a reincarnated Blowitz when it dealt with the
  world's affairs. This phonographic machine was the size and shape of a Dutch
  clock, and down the front of it were electric barometric indicators, and an
  electric clock and calendar, and automatic engagement reminders, and where
  the clock would have been was the mouth of a trumpet. When it had news the
  trumpet gobbled like a turkey, "Galloop, galloop," and then brayed out its
  message as, let us say, a trumpet might bray. It would tell Mwres in full,
  rich, throaty tones about the overnight accidents to the omnibus
  flying-machines that plied around the world, the latest arrivals at the
  fashionable resorts in Tibet, and of all the great monopolist company
  meetings of the day before, while he was dressing. If Mwres did not like
  hearing what it said, he had only to touch a stud, and it would choke a
  little and talk about something else.</p>

  <p>Of course his toilet differed very much from that of his ancestor. It is
  doubtful which would have been the more shocked and pained to find himself in
  the clothing of the other. Mwres would certainly have sooner gone forth to
  the world stark naked than in the silk hat, frock coat, grey trousers and
  watch-chain that had filled Mr. Morris with sombre self-respect in the past.
  For Mwres there was no shaving to do; a skilful operator had long ago removed
  every hair-root from his face. His legs he encased in pleasant pink and amber
  garments of an air-tight material, which with the help of an ingenious little
  pump he distended so as to suggest enormous muscles. Above this he also wore
  pneumatic garments beneath an amber silk tunic, so that he was clothed in air
  and admirably protected against sudden extremes of heat or cold. Over this he
  flung a scarlet cloak with its edge fantastically curved. On his head, which
  had been skilfully deprived of every scrap of hair, he adjusted a pleasant
  little cap of bright scarlet, held on by suction and inflated with hydrogen,
  and curiously like the comb of a cock. So his toilet was complete and,
  conscious of being soberly and becomingly attired, he was ready to face his
  fellow-beings with a tranquil eye.</p>

  <p>This Mwres&mdash;the civility of "Mr." had vanished ages ago&mdash;was one
  of the officials under the Wind Vane and Waterfall Trust, the great company
  that owned every wind wheel and waterfall in the world, and which pumped all
  the water and supplied all the electric energy that people in these latter
  days required. He lived in a vast hotel near that part of London called
  Seventh Way, and had very large and comfortable apartments on the seventeenth
  floor. Households and family life had long since disappeared with the
  progressive refinements of manners; and indeed the steady rise in rents and
  land values, the disappearance of domestic servants, the elaboration of
  cookery, had rendered the separate domicile of Victorian times impossible,
  even had any one desired such a savage seclusion. When his toilet was
  completed he went towards one of the two doors of his apartment&mdash;there
  were doors at opposite ends, each marked with a huge arrow pointing one way
  and one the other&mdash;touched a stud to open it, and emerged on a wide
  passage, the centre of which bore chairs and was moving at a steady pace to
  the left. On some of these chairs were seated gaily-dressed men and women. He
  nodded to an acquaintance&mdash;it was not in those days etiquette to talk
  before breakfast&mdash;and seated himself on one of these chairs, and in a
  few seconds he had been carried to the doors of a lift, by which he descended
  to the great and splendid hall in which his breakfast would be automatically
  served.</p>

  <p>It was a very different meal from a Victorian breakfast. The rude masses
  of bread needing to be carved and smeared over with animal fat before they
  could be made palatable, the still recognisable fragments of recently killed
  animals, hideously charred and hacked, the eggs torn ruthlessly from beneath
  some protesting hen&mdash;, such things as these, though they constituted the
  ordinary fare of Victorian times, would have awakened only horror and disgust
  in the refined minds of the people of these latter days. Instead were pastes
  and cakes of agreeable and variegated design, without any suggestion in
  colour or form of the unfortunate animals from which their substance and
  juices were derived. They appeared on little dishes sliding out upon a rail
  from a little box at one side of the table. The surface of the table, to
  judge by touch and eye, would have appeared to a nineteenth-century person to
  be covered with fine white damask, but this was really an oxidised metallic
  surface, and could be cleaned instantly after a meal. There were hundreds of
  such little tables in the hall, and at most of them were other latter-day
  citizen singly or in groups. And as Mwres seated himself before his elegant
  repast, the invisible orchestra, which had been resting during an interval,
  resumed and filled the air with music.</p>

  <p>But Mwres did not display any great interest either in his breakfast or
  the music; his eye wandered incessantly about the hall, as though he expected
  a belated guest. At last he rose eagerly and waved his hand, and
  simultaneously across the hall appeared a tall dark figure in a costume of
  yellow and olive green. As this person, walking amidst the tables with
  measured steps drew near, the pallid earnestness of his face and the unusual
  intensity of his eyes became apparent. Mwres reseated himself and pointed to
  a chair beside him.</p>

  <p>"I feared you would never come," he said. In spite of the intervening
  space of time, the English language was still almost exactly the same as it
  had been in England under Victoria the Good. The invention of the phonograph
  and suchlike means of recording sound, and the gradual replacement of books
  by such contrivances, had not only saved the human eyesight from decay, but
  had also by the establishment of a sure standard arrested the process of
  change in accent that had hitherto been so inevitable.</p>

  <p>"I was delayed by an interesting case," said the man in green and yellow.
  "A prominent politician&mdash;ahem&mdash;! Suffering from overwork." He
  glanced at the breakfast and seated himself. "I have been awake for forty
  hours."</p>

  <p>"Eh dear!" said Mwres; "Fancy that! You hypnotist have your work to
  do."</p>

  <p>The hypnotist helped himself to some attractive amber-coloured jelly. "I
  happen to be a good deal in request," he said modestly.</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows what we should do without you."</p>

  <p>"Oh! We're not so indispensable as all that," said the hypnotist,
  ruminating the flavour of the jelly. "The world did very well without us for
  some thousands of years. Two hundred years ago even&mdash;not one! In
  practice, that is... Physicians by the thousand, of course&mdash;frightfully
  clumsy brutes for the most part, and following one another like
  sheep&mdash;but doctors of the mind, except a few empirical flounderers there
  were none."</p>

  <p>He concentrated his mind on the jelly.</p>

  <p>"But were people so sane&mdash;?" began Mwres.</p>

  <p>The hypnotist shook his head. "It didn't matter then if they were a bit
  silly or faddy. Life was so easy-going then. No competition worth speaking of
  &mdash;no pressure. A human being had to be very lopsided before anything
  happened. Then, you know, they clapped 'em away in what they called a lunatic
  asylum."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Mwres. "In these confounded historical romances that every
  one is listening to, they always rescue a beautiful girl from an asylum or
  something of the sort. I don't know if you attend to that rubbish."</p>

  <p>"I must confess I do," said the hypnotist. "It carries one out of oneself
  to hear of those quaint, adventurous, half-civilised days of the nineteenth
  century, when men were stout and women simple. I like a good swaggering story
  before all things. Curious times they were, with their smutty railways and
  puffing old iron trains, their rum little houses and their horse vehicles. I
  suppose you don't read books?"</p>

  <p>"Dear, no!" said Mwres. "I went to a modern school and we had none of that
  old-fashioned nonsense. Phonographs are good enough for me."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said the hypnotist, "of course," and surveyed the table for
  his next choice. "You know," he said, helping himself to a dark blue
  confection that promised well, "in those days our business was scarcely
  thought of. I daresay if any one had told them that in two hundred years'
  time a class of men would be entirely occupied in impressing things upon the
  memory, effacing unpleasant ideas, controlling and overcoming instinctive but
  undesirable impulses, and so forth, by means of hypnotism, they would have
  refused to believe the thing possible. Few people knew that an order made
  during a mesmeric trance, even an order to forget or an order to desire,
  could be given so as to be obeyed after the trance was over. Yet there were
  men alive then who could have told them the thing was as absolutely certain
  to come about as&mdash;well, the transit of Venus."</p>

  <p>"They knew of hypnotism, then?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, yes! They used it&mdash;for painless dentistry and things like
  that! This blue stuff is confoundedly good: what is it?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't the faintest idea," said Mwres, "but I admit it's very good. Take
  some more."</p>

  <p>The hypnotist repeated his praises, and there was an appreciative
  pause.</p>

  <p>"Speaking of these historical romances," said Mwres, with an attempt at an
  easy, off-hand manner, "brings me&mdash;ah&mdash;to the matter
  I&mdash;ah&mdash;had in mind when I asked you&mdash;when I expressed a wish
  to see you." He paused and took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>The hypnotist turned an attentive eye upon him, and continued eating.</p>

  <p>"The fact is," said Mwres, "I have a&mdash;in fact a&mdash;daughter. Well,
  you know I have given her&mdash;ah&mdash;every educational advantage.
  Lectures&mdash;not a solitary lecturer of ability in the world but she has
  had a telephone direct, dancing, deportment, conversation, philosophy, art
  criticism..." He indicated catholic culture by a gesture of his hand. "I had
  intended her to marry a very good friend of mine&mdash;Bindon of the Lighting
  Commission&mdash;plain little man, you know, and a bit unpleasant in some of
  his ways, but an excellent fellow really&mdash;an excellent fellow."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the hypnotist, "go on. How old is she?"</p>

  <p>"Eighteen."</p>

  <p>"A dangerous age. Well?"</p>

  <p>"Well: it seems she has been indulging in these historical romances
  &mdash;excessively. Excessively. Even to the neglect of her philosophy.
  Filled her mind with unutterable nonsense about soldiers who fight&mdash;what
  is it&mdash;? Etruscans?"</p>

  <p>"Egyptians."</p>

  <p>Egyptians&mdash;very probably. Hack about with swords and revolvers and
  things&mdash;blood-shed galore&mdash;horrible&mdash;! And about young men on
  torpedo catchers who blow up&mdash;Spaniards, I fancy&mdash;and all sorts of
  irregular adventurers. And she has got it into her head that she must marry
  for Love, and that poor little Bindon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've met similar cases," said the hypnotist. "Who is the other young
  man?"</p>

  <p>Mwres maintained an appearance of resigned calm. "You may well ask," he
  said. "He is&mdash;," and his voice sank with shame&mdash;"a mere attendant
  upon the stage on which the flying-machines from Paris alight. He
  has&mdash;as they say in the romances&mdash;good looks. He is quite young and
  very eccentric. Affects the antique&mdash;he can read and write! So can she.
  And instead of communicating by telephone, like sensible people, they write
  and deliver&mdash;what is it?"</p>

  <p>"Notes?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not notes... Ah&mdash;poems."</p>

  <p>The hypnotist raised his eyebrows. "How did she meet him?"</p>

  <p>"Tripped coming down from the flying-machine from Paris&mdash;and fell
  into his arms. The mischief was done in a moment!"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;that's all. Things must be stopped. That is what I want to
  consult you about. What must be done? What can be done? Of course I'm not a
  hypnotist; my knowledge is limited. But you&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Hypnotism is not magic," said the man in green, putting both arms on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Oh, precisely! But still&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>"People cannot be hypnotised without their consent. If she is able to
  stand out against marrying Bindon, she will probably stand out against being
  hypnotised. But if once she can be hypnotised&mdash;even by somebody else
  &mdash;the thing is done."</p>

  <p>"You can&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly! Once we get her amenable, then we can suggest that she
  must marry Bindon&mdash;that, that is her fate; or that the young man is
  repulsive, and that when she sees him, she will be giddy and faint, or any
  little thing of that sort. Or if we can get her into a sufficiently profound
  trance we can suggest that she should forget him altogether&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Precisely."</p>

  <p>"But the problem is to get her hypnotised. Of course no sort of proposal
  or suggestion must come from you&mdash;because no doubt she already distrusts
  you in the matter."</p>

  <p>The hypnotist leant his head upon his arm and thought.</p>

  <p>"It's hard a man cannot dispose of his own daughter," said Mwres
  irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>"You must give me the name and address of the young lady," said the
  hypnotist, "and any information bearing upon the matter. And, by the bye, is
  there any money in the affair?"</p>

  <p>Mwres hesitated.</p>

  <p>"There's a sum&mdash;in fact, a considerable sum&mdash;invested in the
  Patent Road Company. From her mother. That's what makes the thing so
  exasperating."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said the hypnotist. And he proceeded to cross-examine Mwres on
  the entire affair.</p>

  <p>It was a lengthy interview.</p>

  <p>And meanwhile "Elizebe8 Mwres," as she spelt her name, or "Elizabeth
  Morris," as a nineteenth-century person would have put it, was sitting in a
  quite waiting-place beneath the great stage upon which the flying-machine
  from Paris descended. And beside her sat her slender, handsome lover reading
  her the poem he had written that morning while on duty upon the stage. When
  he had finished they sat for a time in silence; and then, as if for their
  special entertainment, the great machine that had come flying through the air
  from America that morning rushed down out of the sky.</p>

  <p>At first it was a little oblong, faint and blue amidst the distant fleecy
  clouds; and then it grew swiftly large and white, and larger and whiter,
  until they could see the separate tiers of sails, each hundreds of feet wide,
  and the lank body they supported, and at last even the swinging seats of the
  passengers in a dotted row. Although it was falling it seemed to them to be
  rushing up the sky, and over the roof-spaces of the city below its shadow
  leapt towards them. They heard the whistling rush of the air about it and its
  yelling siren, shrill and swelling, to warn those who were on its
  landing-stage of its arrival. And abruptly the note fell down a couple of
  octaves, and it had passed, and the sky was clear and void, and she could
  turn her sweet eyes again to Denton at her side.</p>

  <p>Their silence ended; and Denton, speaking in a little language of broken
  English that was, they fancied, their private possession&mdash;though lovers
  have used such little languages since the world began&mdash;told her how they
  too would leap into the air one morning out of all the obstacles and
  difficulties about them, and fly to a sunlit city of delight he knew of in
  japan, halfway about the world.</p>

  <p>She loved the dream, but she feared the leap; and she put him off with
  "Some day, dearest one, some day," to all his pleading that it might be soon;
  and at last came a shrilling of whistles, and it was time for him to go back
  to his duties on the stage. They parted&mdash;as lovers have been wont to
  part for thousands of years. She walked down a passage to a lift, and so came
  to one of the streets of that latter&mdash;day London, all glazed in with
  glass from the weather, and with incessant moving platforms that went to all
  parts of the city. And by one of these she returned to her apartments in the
  Hotel for Women where she lived, the apartments that were in telephonic
  communication with all the best lecturers in the world. But the sunlight of
  the flying stage was in her heart, and the wisdom of all the best lecturers
  in the world seemed folly in that light.</p>

  <p>She spent the middle part of the day in the gymnasium, and took her midday
  meal with two other girls and their common chaperone&mdash;for it was still
  the custom to have a chaperone in the case of motherless girls of the more
  prosperous classes. The chaperone had a visitor that day, a man in green and
  yellow, with a white face and vivid eyes, who talked amazingly. Among other
  things, he fell to praising a new historical romance that one of the great
  popular story-tellers of the day had just put forth. It was, of course, about
  the spacious times of Queen Victoria; and the author, among other pleasing
  novelties, made a little argument before each section of the story, in
  imitation of the chapter headings of the old-fashioned books: as for example,
  "How the Cabmen of Pimlico stopped the Victoria Omnibuses, and of the Great
  Fight in Palace Yard," and "How the Piccadilly Policeman was slain in the
  midst of his Duty." The man in green and yellow praised this innovation.
  "These pithy sentences," he said, "are admirable. They show at a glance those
  headlong, tumultuous times, when men and animals jostled in the filthy
  streets, and death might wait for one at every corner. Life was life then!
  How great the world must have seemed then! How marvellous! There were still
  parts of the world absolutely unexplored. Nowadays we have almost abolished
  wonder, we lead lives so trim and orderly that courage, endurance, faith, all
  the noble virtues seem fading from mankind."</p>

  <p>And so on, taking the girls' thoughts with him, until the life they led,
  life in the vast and intricate London of the twenty-second century, a life
  interspersed with soaring excursions to every part of the globe, seemed to
  them a monotonous misery compared with daedal past.</p>

  <p>At first Elizabeth did not join in the conversation, but after a time the
  subject became so interesting that she made a few shy interpolations. But he
  scarcely seemed to notice her as he talked. He went on to describe a new
  method of entertaining people. They were hypnotised, and then suggestions
  were made to them so skilfully that they seemed to be living in ancient times
  again. They played out a little romance in the past as vivid as reality, and
  when at last they awakened they remembered all they had been through as
  though it were a real thing.</p>

  <p>"It is a thing we have sought to do for years and years," said the
  hypnotist. "It is practically an artificial dream. And we know the way at
  last. Think of all it opens out to us&mdash;the enrichment of our experience,
  the recovery of adventure, the refuge it offers from this sordid, competitive
  life in which we live! Think!"</p>

  <p>"And you can do that!" said the chaperone eagerly.</p>

  <p>"The thing is possible at last," the hypnotist said. "You may order a
  dream as you wish."</p>

  <p>The chaperone was the first to be hypnotised, and the dream, she said, was
  wonderful, when she came to again.</p>

  <p>The other two girls, encouraged by her enthusiasm, also placed themselves
  in the hands of the hypnotist and had plunges into the romantic past. No one
  suggested that Elizabeth should try this novel entertainment; it was at her
  own request at last that she was taken into that land of dreams where there
  is neither any freedom of choice nor will...</p>

  <p>And so the mischief was done.</p>

  <p>One day, when Denton went down to that quiet seat beneath the flying
  stage, Elizabeth was not in her wonted place. He was disappointed, and a
  little angry. The next day she did not come, and the next also. He was
  afraid. To hide his fears from himself, he set to work to write sonnets for
  her when she should come again...</p>

  <p>For three days he fought against his dread by such distraction, and then
  the truth was before him clear and cold, and would not be denied. She might
  be ill, she might be dead; but he would not believe that he had been
  betrayed. There followed a week of misery. And then he knew she was the only
  thing on earth worth having, and that he must seek her, however hopeless the
  search, until she was found once more.</p>

  <p>He had some small private means of his own, and so he threw over his
  appointment on the flying stage, and set himself to find this girl who had
  become at last all the world to him. He did not know where she lived, and
  little of her circumstances; for it had been part of the delight of her
  girlish romance that he should know nothing of her, nothing of the difference
  of their station. The ways of the city opened before him east and west, north
  and south. Even in Victorian days London was a maze, that little London with
  its poor four millions of people; but the London he explored, the London of
  the twenty-second century, was a London of thirty million souls. At first he
  was energetic and headlong, taking time neither to eat nor sleep. He sought
  for weeks and months, he went through every imaginable phase of fatigue and
  despair, over-excitement and anger. Long after hope was dead, by the sheer
  inertia of his desire he still went to and fro, peering into faces and
  looking this way and that, in the incessant ways and lifts and passages of
  that interminable hive of men.</p>

  <p>At last chance was kind to him, and he saw her.</p>

  <p>It was in a time of festivity. He was hungry; he had paid the inclusive
  fee and had gone into one of the gigantic dining-places of the city; he was
  pushing his way among the tables and scrutinising by mere force of habit
  every group he passed.</p>

  <p>He stood still, robbed of all power of motion, his eyes wide, his lips
  apart. Elizabeth sat scarcely twenty yards away from him, looking straight at
  him. Her eyes were as hard to him, as hard and expressionless and void of
  recognition, as the eyes of a statue.</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment, and then her gaze passed beyond him.</p>

  <p>Had he had only her eyes to judge by, he might have doubted if it was
  indeed Elizabeth, but he knew her by the gesture of her hand, by the grace of
  a wanton little curl that floated over her ear as she moved her head.
  Something was said to her, and she turned smiling tolerantly to the man
  beside her, a little man in foolish raiment knobbed and spiked like some odd
  reptile with pneumatic horns&mdash;the Bindon of her father's choice.</p>

  <p>For a moment Denton stood white and wild-eyed; then came a terrible
  faintness, and he sat before one of the little tables. He sat down with his
  back to her, and for a time he did not dare to look at her again. When at
  last he did, she and Bindon and two other people were standing up to go. The
  others were her father and her chaperone.</p>

  <p>He sat as if incapable of action until the four figures were remote and
  small, and then he rose up possessed with the idea of pursuit. For a space he
  feared he had lost them, and then he came upon Elizabeth and her chaperone
  again in one of the streets of moving platforms that intersected the city.
  Bindon and Mwres had disappeared.</p>

  <p>He could not control himself to patience. He felt he must speak to her
  forthwith, or die. He pushed forward to where they were seated, and sat down
  beside them. His white face was convulsed with half-hysterical
  excitement.</p>

  <p>He laid his hand on her wrist. "Elizabeth?" he said.</p>

  <p>She turned in unfeigned astonishment. Nothing but the fear of a strange
  man showed in her face.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth," he cried, and his voice was strange to him:
  "dearest&mdash;you know me?"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth's face showed nothing but alarm and perplexity. She drew herself
  away from him. The chaperone, a little grey-headed woman with mobile
  features, lent forward to intervene. Her resolute bright eyes examined
  Denton. "What do you say?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"This young lady," said Denton&mdash;, "she knows me."</p>

  <p>"Do you know him, dear?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Elizabeth in a strange voice, and with a hand to her forehead,
  speaking almost as one who repeats a lesson. "No, I do not know him. I know
  &mdash;I do not know him."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but... Not know me! It is I&mdash;Denton. Denton! To whom you
  used to talk. Don't you remember the flying stages? The little seat in the
  open air? The verses&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No" cried Elizabeth&mdash;, "no. I do not know him. I do not know him.
  There is something... But I don't know. All I know is that I do not know
  him." Her face was a face of infinite distress.</p>

  <p>The sharp eyes of the chaperone flitted to and fro from the girl to the
  man. "You see?" she said, with the faint shadow of a smile. "She does not
  know you."</p>

  <p>"I do not know you," said Elizabeth. "Of that I am sure."</p>

  <p>"But, dear&mdash;the songs&mdash;the little verses&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She dose not know you," said the chaperone. "You must not... You have
  made a mistake. You must not go on talking to us after that. You must not
  annoy us on the public ways."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" said Denton, and for a moment his miserably haggard face
  appealed against fate.</p>

  <p>"You must not persist, young man," protested the chaperone.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth!" he cried.</p>

  <p>Her face was the face of one who is tormented. "I do not know you," she
  cried, hand to brow. "Oh, I do not know you!"</p>

  <p>For an instant Denton sat stunned. Then he stood up and groaned aloud.</p>

  <p>He made a strange gesture of appeal towards the remote glass roof of the
  public way, then turned and went plunging recklessly from one moving platform
  to another, and vanished amidst the swarms of people going to and fro
  thereon. The chaperone's eyes followed him, and then she looked at the
  curious faces about her.</p>

  <p>"Dear," asked Elizabeth, clasping her hand, and too deeply moved to heed
  observation, "who was that man? Who was that man?"</p>

  <p>The chaperone raised her eyebrows. She spoke in a clear, audible voice.
  "Some half-witted creature. I have never set eyes on him before."</p>

  <p>"Never?"</p>

  <p>"Never, dear. Do not trouble your mind about a thing like this."</p>

  <p>And soon after this the celebrated hypnotist who dressed in green and
  yellow had another client. The young man paced his consulting-room, pale and
  disordered. "I want to forget," he cried. "I must forget."</p>

  <p>The hypnotist watched him with quiet eyes, studied his face and clothes
  and bearing. "To forget anything&mdash;pleasure or pain&mdash;is to be, by so
  much&mdash;less. However, you know your own concern. My fee is high."</p>

  <p>"If only I can forget&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's easy enough with you. You wish it. I've done much harder things.
  Quite recently. I hardly expected to do it: the thing was done against the
  will of the hypnotised person. A love affair too&mdash;like yours. A girl. So
  rest assured."</p>

  <p>The young man came and sat beside the hypnotist. His manner was a forced
  calm. He looked into the hypnotist's eyes. "I will tell you. Of course you
  will want to know what it is. There was a girl. Her name was Elizabeth Mwres.
  Well..."</p>

  <p>He stopped. He had seen the instant surprise on the hypnotist's face. In
  that instant he knew. He stood up. He seemed to dominate the seated figure by
  his side. He gripped the shoulder of green and gold. For a time he could not
  find words.</p>

  <p>"Give her me back!" he said at last. "Give her me back!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" gasped the hypnotist.</p>

  <p>"Give her me back."</p>

  <p>"Give whom?"</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth Mwres&mdash;the girl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The hypnotist tried to free himself; he rose to his feet. Denton's grip
  tightened.</p>

  <p>"Let go!" cried the hypnotist, thrusting an arm against Denton's
  chest.</p>

  <p>In a moment the two men were locked in a clumsy wrestle. Neither had the
  slightest training&mdash;for athleticism, except for exhibition and to afford
  opportunity for betting, had faded out the earth&mdash;but Denton was not
  only the younger but the stronger of the two. They swayed across the room,
  and then the hypnotist had gone down under his antagonist. They fell
  together...</p>

  <p>Denton leaped to his feet, dismayed at his own fury; but the hypnotist lay
  still, and suddenly from a little white mark where his forehead had struck a
  stool, shot a hurrying band of red. For a space Denton stood over him
  irresolute, trembling.</p>

  <p>A fear of the consequences entered his gently nurtured mind. He turned
  towards the door. "No," he said aloud, and came back to the middle of the
  room. Overcoming the instinctive repugnance of one who had seen no act of
  violence in all his life before, he knelt down beside his antagonist and felt
  his heart. Then he peered at the wound. He rose quickly and looked about him.
  He began to see more of the situation.</p>

  <p>When presently the hypnotist recovered his senses, his head ached
  severely, his back was against Denton's knees and Denton was sponging his
  face.</p>

  <p>The hypnotist did not speak. But presently he indicated by a gesture that
  in his opinion he had been sponged enough. "Let me get up," he said.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," said Denton.</p>

  <p>"You have assaulted me, you scoundrel!"</p>

  <p>"We are alone," said Denton, "and the door is secure."</p>

  <p>There was an interval of thought.</p>

  <p>"Unless I sponge," said Denton, "your forehead will develop a tremendous
  bruise."</p>

  <p>"You can go on sponging," said the hypnotist sulkily.</p>

  <p>There was another pause.</p>

  <p>"We might be in the Stone Age," said the Hypnotist. "Violence!
  Struggle!"</p>

  <p>"In the Stone Age no man dared to come between man and woman," said
  Denton.</p>

  <p>The hypnotist thought again.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"While you were insensible I found the girl's address on your tablets. I
  did not know it before. I telephoned. She will be here soon. Then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She will bring her chaperone."</p>

  <p>"That is all right."</p>

  <p>"But what&mdash;? I don't see. What do you mean to do?"</p>

  <p>"I looked about for a weapon also. It is an astonishing thing how few
  weapons there are nowadays. If you consider that in the Stone Age men owned
  scarcely anything but weapons. I hit at last upon this lamp. I have wrenched
  off the wires and things, and I hold it so." He extended it over the
  hypnotist's shoulders. "With that I can quite easily smash your skull. I will
  &mdash;unless you do as I tell you."</p>

  <p>"Violence is no remedy," said the hypnotist, quoting from the "Modern
  Man's Book of Moral Maxims."</p>

  <p>"It's an undesirable disease," said Denton.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"You will tell that chaperone you are going to order the girl to marry
  that knobby little brute with the red hair and ferrety eyes. I believe that's
  how things stand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;that's how things stand."</p>

  <p>"And, pretending to do that, you will restore her memory of me."</p>

  <p>"It's unprofessional."</p>

  <p>"Look here! If I cannot have that girl I would rather die than not. I
  don't propose to respect your little fancies. If anything goes wrong you
  shall not live five minutes. This is a rude makeshift of a weapon, and it may
  quite conceivably be painful to kill you. But I will. It is unusual, I know,
  nowadays to do things like this&mdash;mainly because there is so little in
  life that is worth being violent about."</p>

  <p>"The chaperone will see you directly she comes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shall stand in that recess. Behind you."</p>

  <p>The hypnotist thought. "You are a determined young man," he said, "and
  only half civilised. I have tried to do my duty to my client, but in this
  affair you seem likely to get your own way..."</p>

  <p>"You mean to deal straightly."</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to risk having my brains scattered in a petty affair like
  this."</p>

  <p>"And afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing a hypnotist or doctor hates so much as a scandal. I at
  least am no savage. I am annoyed... But in a day or so I shall bear no
  malice..."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. And that we understand each other, there is no necessity to
  keep you sitting any longer on the floor."</p>

  2. THE VACANT COUNTRY</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>, July 1897</h3>

  <p>The world, they say changed more between the year 1800 and the year 1900
  than it had done in the previous five hundred years. That century, the
  nineteenth century, was the dawn of a new epoch in the history of mankind
  &mdash;the epoch of the great citied, the end of the old order of country
  life.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of the nineteenth century the majority of mankind still
  lived upon the countryside, as their way of life had been for countless
  generations. All over the world they dwelt in little towns and villages then,
  and engaged either directly in agriculture, or in occupations that were of
  service to the agriculturist. They travelled rarely, and dwelt close to their
  work, because swift means of transit had not yet come. The few who travelled
  went either on foot, or in slow sailing-ships, or by means of jogging horses
  incapable of more than sixty miles a day. Think of it&mdash;! Sixty miles a
  day. Here and there, in those sluggish times, a town grew a little larger
  than its neighbours, as a port or as a centre of government; but all the
  towns in the world with more than a hundred thousand inhabitants could be
  counted on a man's fingers. So it was in the beginning of the nineteenth
  century. By the end, the invention of railways, telegraphs, steamships, and
  complex agricultural machinery, had changed all these things: changed them
  beyond all hope of return. The vast shops, the varied pleasures, the
  countless conveniences of the larger towns were suddenly possible, and no
  sooner existed than they were brought into competition with the homely
  resources of the rural centres. Mankind were drawn to the cities by an
  overwhelming attraction. The demand for labour fell with the increase of
  machinery, the local markets were entirely superseded, and there was a rapid
  growth of the larger centres at the expense of the open country.</p>

  <p>The flow of population townward was the constant preoccupation of
  Victorian writers. In Great Britain and New England, in India and China, the
  same thing was remarked: everywhere a few swollen towns were visibly
  replacing the ancient order. That this was an inevitable result of improved
  means of travel and transport&mdash;that, given swift means of transit, these
  things must be&mdash;was realised by few; and the most puerile schemes were
  devised to overcome the mysterious magnetism of the urban centres, and keep
  the people on the land.</p>

  <p>Yet the developments of the nineteenth century were only the dawning of
  the new order. The first great cities of the new time were horribly
  inconvenient, darkened by smoky fogs, insanitary and noisy; but the discovery
  of new methods of building, new methods of heating, changed all this. Between
  1900 and 2000 the march of change was still more rapid; and between 2000 and
  2100 the continually accelerated progress of human invention made the reign
  of Victoria the Good seem at last an almost incredible vision of idyllic
  tranquil days.</p>

  <p>The introduction of railways was only the first step in that development
  of those means of locomotion which finally revolutionised human life. By the
  year 2000 railways and roads had vanished together. The railways, robbed of
  their rails, had become weedy ridges and ditches upon the face of the world;
  the old roads, strange barbaric tracks of flint and soil, hammered by hand or
  rolled by rough iron rollers, strewn with miscellaneous filth, and cut by
  iron hoofs and wheels into ruts and puddles often many inches deep, had been
  replaced by patent tracks made of a substance called Eadhamite. This
  Eadhamite&mdash;it was named after its patentee&mdash;ranks with the
  invention of printing and steam as one of the epoch-making discoveries of the
  world's history.</p>

  <p>When Eadham discovered the substance, he probably thought of it as a mere
  cheap substitute for indiarubber; it cost a few shilling a ton. But you can
  never tell all an invention will do. It was the genius of a man named Warming
  that pointed to the possibility of using it, not only for the tires of
  wheels, but as a road substance, and who organised the enormous network of
  public ways that speedily covered the world.</p>

  <p>These public ways were made with longitudinal divisions. On the outer on
  either side went feet cyclists and conveyances travelling at a less speed
  than twenty-five miles an hour; in the middle, motors capable of speed up to
  a hundred; and the inner, Warming (in the face of enormous ridicule) reserved
  for vehicles travelling at speeds of a hundred miles an hour and upward.</p>

  <p>For ten years his inner ways were vacant. Before he died they were the
  most crowded of all, and vast light frameworks with wheels of twenty and
  thirty feet in diameter, hurled along them at paces that year after year rose
  steadily towards two hundred miles an hour. And by the time this revolution
  was accomplished, a parallel revolution had transformed the ever-growing
  cities. Before the development of practical science the fogs and filth of
  Victorian times vanished. Electric heating replaced fires (in 2013 the
  lighting of a fire that did not absolutely consume its own smoke was made an
  indictable nuisance), and all the city ways, all public squares and places,
  were covered in with a recently invented glass-like substance. The roofing of
  London became practically continuous. Certain short-sighted and foolish
  legislation against tall buildings was abolished, and London, from a squat
  expanse of petty houses&mdash;feebly archaic in design&mdash;rose steadily
  towards the sky. To the municipal responsibility for water, light, and
  drainage, was added another, and that was ventilation.</p>

  <p>But to tell of all the changes in human convenience that these two hundred
  years brought about, to tell of the long foreseen invention of flying, to
  describe how life in households was steadily supplanted by life in
  interminable hotels, how at last even those who were still concerned in
  agricultural work came to live in the towns and to go to and fro to their
  work every day, to describe how at last in all England only four towns
  remained, each with many millions of people, and how there were left no
  inhabited houses in all the countryside: to tell all this would take us far
  from our story of Denton and his Elizabeth. They had been separated and
  reunited, and still they could not marry. For Denton&mdash;it was his only
  fault&mdash;had no money. Neither had Elizabeth until she was twenty-one, and
  as yet she was only eighteen. At twenty-one all the property of her mother
  would come to her, for that was the custom of the time. She did not know that
  it was possible to anticipate her fortune, and Denton was far too delicate a
  lover to suggest such a thing. So things stuck hopelessly between them.
  Elizabeth said that she was very unhappy, and that nobody understood her but
  Denton, and that when she was away from him she was wretched; and Denton said
  that his heart longed for her day and night. And they met as often as they
  could to enjoy the discussion of their sorrows.</p>

  <p>They met one day at their little seat upon the flying stage. The precise
  site of this meeting was where in Victorian times the road from Wimbledon
  came out upon the common. They were, however, five hundred feet above that
  point. Their seat looked far over London. To convey the appearance of it all
  to a nineteenth-century reader would have been difficult. One would have had
  to tell him to think of the Crystal Palace, of the newly built "mammoth"
  hotels&mdash;as those little affairs were called&mdash;of the larger railway
  stations of his time, and to imagine such buildings enlarged to vast
  proportions and run together and continuous over the whole metropolitan area.
  If then he was told that this continuous roof-space bore a huge forest of
  rotating wind-wheels, he would have begun very dimly to appreciate what to
  these young people was the commonest sight in their lives.</p>

  <p>To their eyes it had something of the quality of a prison, and they were
  talking, as they had talked a hundred times before, of how they might escape
  from it and be at last happy together: escape from it, that is before the
  appointed three years were at an end. It was, they both agreed, not only
  impossible but almost wicked, to wait three years. "Before that," said Denton
  &mdash;and the notes of his voice told of a splendid chest&mdash;"we might
  both be dead!"</p>

  <p>Their vigorous young hands had to grip at this, and then Elizabeth had a
  still more poignant thought that brought the tears from her wholesome eyes
  and down her healthy cheeks. "One of us," she said, "one of us might
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She choked; she could not say the word that is so terrible to the young
  and happy.</p>

  <p>Yet to marry and be very poor in the cities of that time was&mdash;for any
  one who lived pleasantly&mdash;a very dreadful thing. In the old agricultural
  days that had drawn to an end in the eighteenth century there had been a
  pretty proverb of love in a cottage, and indeed in those days the poor of the
  countryside had dwelt in flower-covered, diamond-windowed cottages of thatch
  and plaster, with the sweet air and earth about them, amidst tangled hedges
  and the song of birds, and with the ever-changing sky overhead. But all this
  had changed (the change was already beginning in the nineteenth century), and
  a new sort of life was opening for the poor&mdash;in the lower quarters of
  the city.</p>

  <p>In the nineteenth century the lower quarters were still beneath the sky;
  they were areas of land on clay or other unsuitable soil, liable to floods or
  exposed to the smoke of more fortunate districts, insufficiently supplied
  with water, and as insanitary as the great fear of infectious diseases felt
  by the wealthier classes permitted. In the twenty-second century, however,
  the growth of the city storey above storey, and the coalescence of buildings,
  had led to a different arrangement. The prosperous people lived in a vast
  series of sumptuous hotels in the upper storeys and halls of the city fabric;
  the industrial population dwelt beneath in the tremendous ground-floor and
  basement, so to speak, of the place.</p>

  <p>In the refinement of life and manners these lower classes differed little
  from their ancestors, the Eastenders of Queen Victoria's time; but they had
  developed a distinct dialect of their own. In these under ways they lived and
  died, rarely ascending to the surface except when work took them there. Since
  for most of them this was the sort of life to which they had been born, they
  found no great misery in such circumstances; but for people like Denton and
  Elizabeth, such a plunge would have seemed more terrible than death.</p>

  <p>"And yet what else is there?" asked Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>Denton professed not to know. Apart from his own feeling of delicacy, he
  was not sure how Elizabeth would like the idea of borrowing on the strength
  of her expectations.</p>

  <p>The passage from London to Paris even, said Elizabeth, was beyond their
  means; and in Paris, as in any other city in the world, life would be just as
  costly and impossible as in London.</p>

  <p>Well might Denton cry aloud: "If only we had lived in those days, dearest!
  If only we had lived in the past! For to their eyes even nineteenth-century
  Whitechapel was seen through a mist of romance.</p>

  <p>"Is there nothing?" cried Elizabeth, suddenly weeping. "Must we really
  wait for those three long years? Fancy three years&mdash;six-and-thirty
  months!" The human capacity for patience had not grown with the ages.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly Denton was moved to speak of something that had already
  flickered across his mind. He had hit upon it at last. It seemed to him so
  wild a suggestion that he made it only half seriously. But to put a thing
  into words has ever a way of making it seem more real and possible than it
  seemed before. And so it was with him.</p>

  <p>"Suppose," he said, "we went into the country?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him to see if he was serious in proposing such an
  adventure.</p>

  <p>"The country?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;beyond there. Beyond the hills."</p>

  <p>"How could we live?" she said. "Where could we live?"</p>

  <p>"It is not impossible," he said. "People used to live in the country."</p>

  <p>"But then there were houses."</p>

  <p>"There are the ruins of villages and towns now. On the clay lands they are
  gone, of course. But they are still left on the grazing land, because it does
  not pay the Food Company to remove them. I know that&mdash;for certain.
  Besides, one sees them from the flying machines, you know. Well, we might
  shelter in some one of these, and repair it with our hands. Do you know, the
  thing is not so wild as it seems. Some of the men who go out every day to
  look after the crops and herds might be paid to bring us food..."</p>

  <p>She stood in front of him. "How strange it would be if one really
  could..."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"But no one dares."</p>

  <p>"That is no reason."</p>

  <p>"It would be&mdash;oh! It would be so romantic and strange. If only it
  were possible."</p>

  <p>"Why not possible?"</p>

  <p>"There are so many things. Think of all the things we have, things that we
  should miss."</p>

  <p>"Should we miss them? After all, the life we lead is very
  unreal&mdash;very artificial." He began to expand his idea, and as he warmed
  to his exposition the fantastic quality of his first proposal faded away.</p>

  <p>She thought. "But I have heard of prowlers&mdash;escaped criminals."</p>

  <p>He nodded. He hesitated over his answer because he thought it sounded
  boyish. He blushed. "I could get some one I know to make me a sword."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with enthusiasm growing in her eyes. She had heard of
  swords, had seen one in a museum; she thought of those ancient days when men
  wore them as a common thing. His suggestion seemed an impossible dream to
  her, and perhaps for that reason she was eager for more detail. And inventing
  for the most part as he went along, he told her they might live in the
  country as the old-world people had done. With every detail her interest
  grew, for she was one of those girls for whom romance and adventure have a
  fascination.</p>

  <p>His suggestion seemed, I say, an impossible dream to her on that day, but
  the next day they talked about it again, and it was strangely less
  impossible.</p>

  <p>"At first we should take food," said Denton. "We could carry food for ten
  or twelve days." It was an age of compact artificial nourishment, and such a
  provision had none of the unwieldy suggestion it would have had in the
  nineteenth century.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;until our house," she asked&mdash;"until it was ready, where
  should we sleep?"</p>

  <p>"It is summer."</p>

  <p>"But... What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"There was a time when there were no houses in the world; when all mankind
  slept always in the open air."</p>

  <p>"But for us! The emptiness! No walls&mdash;no ceiling!"</p>

  <p>"Dear," he said "in London you have many beautiful ceilings. Artists paint
  them and stud them with lights. But I have seen a ceiling more beautiful than
  any in London..."</p>

  <p>"But where?"</p>

  <p>"It is the ceiling under which we two would be alone..."</p>

  <p>"You mean...?"</p>

  <p>"Dear," he said, "it is something the world has forgotten. It is Heaven
  and all the host of stars."</p>

  <p>Each time they talked the thing seemed more possible and more desirable to
  them. In a week or so it was quite possible. Another week, and it was the
  inevitable thing they had to do. A great enthusiasm for the country seized
  hold of them and possessed them. The sordid tumult of the town, they said,
  overwhelmed them. They marvelled that this simple way of their troubles had
  never come upon them before.</p>

  <p>One morning near Midsummer-day, there was a new minor official upon the
  flying stage, and Denton's place was to know him no more.</p>

  <p>Our two young people had secretly married, and were going forth manfully
  out of the city in which they and their ancestors before them had lived all
  their days. She wore a new dress of white cut in an old-fashioned pattern,
  and he had a bundle of provisions strapped athwart his back, and in his hand
  he carried&mdash;rather shamefacedly it is true, and under his purple cloak
  &mdash;an implement of archaic form, a cross-hilted thing of tempered
  steel.</p>

  <p>Imagine that going forth! In their days the sprawling suburbs of Victorian
  times with their vile roads, petty houses, foolish little gardens of shrub
  and geranium, and all their futile, pretentious privacies, had disappeared:
  the towering buildings of the new age, the mechanical ways, the electric and
  water mains, all came to an end together, like a wall, like a cliff, near
  four hundred feet in height, abrupt and sheer. All about the city spread the
  carrot, swede, and turnip fields of the Food Company, vegetables that were
  the basis of a thousand varied foods, and weeds and hedgerow tangles had been
  utterly extirpated. The incessant expense of weeding that went on year after
  year in the petty, wasteful and barbaric farming of the ancient days, the
  Food Company had economised for ever more by a campaign of extermination.
  Here and there, however, neat rows of bramble standards and apple trees with
  whitewashed stems, intersected the fields, and at places groups of gigantic
  teazles reared their favoured spikes. Here and there huge agricultural
  machines hunched under waterproof covers. The mingled waters of the Wey and
  Mole and Wandle ran in rectangular channels; and wherever a gentle elevation
  of the ground permitted a fountain of deodorised sewage distributed its
  benefits athwart the land and made a rainbow of the sunlight.</p>

  <p>By a great archway in that enormous city wall emerged the Eadhamite road
  to Portsmouth, swarming in the morning sunshine with an enormous traffic
  bearing the blue-clad servants of the Food Company to their toil. A rushing
  traffic, beside which they seemed two scarce-moving dots. Along the outer
  tracks hummed and rattled the tardy little old-fashioned motors of such as
  had duties within twenty miles or so of the city; the inner ways were filled
  with vaster mechanisms&mdash;swift monocycles bearing a score of men, lank
  multicycles, quadricycles sagging with heavy loads, empty gigantic produce
  carts that would come back again filled before the sun was setting, all with
  throbbing engines and noiseless wheels and a perpetual wild melody of horns
  and gongs.</p>

  <p>Along the very verge of the outermost way our young people went in
  silence, newly wed and oddly shy of one another's company. Many were the
  things shouted to them as they tramped along, for in 2100 a foot-passenger on
  an English road was almost as strange a sight as a motor car would have been
  in 1800. But they went on with steadfast eyes into the country, paying no
  heed to such cries.</p>

  <p>Before them in the south rose the Downs, blue at first, and as they came
  nearer changing to green, surmounted by the row of gigantic wind-wheels that
  supplemented the wind-wheels upon the roof-spaces of the city, and broken and
  restless with the long morning shadows of those whirling vanes. By midday
  they had come so near that they could see here and there little patches of
  pallid dots&mdash;the sheep the Meat Department of the Food Company owned. In
  another hour they had passed the clay and root crops and the single fence
  that hedged them in, and the prohibition against trespass no longer held: the
  levelled roadway plunged into a cutting with all its traffic, and they could
  leave it and walk over the greensward and up the open hillside.</p>

  <p>Never had these children of the latter days been together in such a lonely
  place.</p>

  <p>They were both very hungry and footsore&mdash;for walking was a rare
  exercise&mdash;and presently they sat down on the weedless, close-cropped
  grass, and looked back for the first time at the city from which they had
  come, shining wide and splendid in the blue haze of the valley of the
  Thames.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth was a little afraid of the unenclosed sheep away up the slope
  &mdash;she had never been near big unrestrained animals before&mdash;but
  Denton reassured her. And overhead a white-winged bird circled in the
  blue.</p>

  <p>They talked but little until they had eaten, and then their tongues were
  loosened. He spoke of the happiness that was now certainly theirs, of the
  folly of not breaking sooner out of that magnificent prison of latter-day
  life, of the romantic days that had passed from the world forever. And then
  he became boastful. He took up the sword that lay on the ground beside him,
  and she took it from his hand and ran a tremulous finger along the blade.</p>

  <p>"And you could," she said, "you&mdash;could raise this and strike a
  man?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? If there were need."</p>

  <p>"But," she said, "it seems so horrible. It would slash... There would
  be&mdash;" her voice sank&mdash;, "blood."</p>

  <p>"In the old romances you have read often enough..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know: in those&mdash;yes. But that is different. One knows it is
  not blood, but just a sort of red ink... And you&mdash;killing!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him doubtfully, and then handed him back the sword.</p>

  <p>After they had rested and eaten, they rose up and went on their way
  towards the hills. They passed quite close to a huge flock of sheep, who
  stared and bleated at their unaccustomed figures. She had never seen sheep
  before, and she shivered to think such gentle things must needs be slain for
  food. A sheep-dog barked from a distance, and then a shepherd appeared amidst
  the supports of the wind-wheels, and came down towards them.</p>

  <p>When he drew near he called out asking whither they were going.</p>

  <p>Denton hesitated, and told him briefly that they sought some ruined house
  among the Downs, in which they might live together. He tried to speak in an
  off-hand manner, as though it was a usual thing to do. The man stared
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Have you done anything?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Denton. "Only we don't want to live in a city any longer.
  Why should we live in cities?"</p>

  <p>The shepherd stared more incredulously than ever. "You can't live here,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"We mean to try."</p>

  <p>The shepherd stared from one to the other. "You'll go back to-morrow," he
  said. "It looks pleasant enough in the sunlight... Are you sure you've done
  nothing? We shepherds are not such great friends of the police."</p>

  <p>Denton looked at him steadfastly. "No," he said. "But we are too poor to
  live in the city, and we can't bear the thought of wearing clothes of blue
  canvas and doing drudgery. We are going to live a simple life here, like the
  people of old."</p>

  <p>The shepherd was a bearded man with a thoughtful face. He glanced at
  Elizabeth's fragile beauty.</p>

  <p>"They had simple minds," he said.</p>

  <p>"So have we," said Denton.</p>

  <p>The shepherd smiled.</p>

  <p>"If you go along here," he said, "along the crest beneath the wind-
  wheels, you will see a heap of mounds and ruins on your right-hand side. That
  was once a town called Epsom. There are no houses there, and bricks have been
  used for a sheep pen. Go on, and another heap on the edge of the root-land is
  Leatherhead; and then the hill turns away along the border of a valley, and
  there are woods of beech. Keep along the crest. You will come to quite wild
  places. In some parts, in spite of all the weeding that is done, ferns and
  bluebells and other such useless plants are growing still. And through it
  all, underneath the wind-wheels, runs a straight lane paved with stones, a
  roadway of the Romans two thousand years old. Go to the right of that, down
  into the valley and follow it along by the banks of the river. You come
  presently to a street of houses, many with roofs still sound upon them. There
  you may find shelter."</p>

  <p>They thanked him.</p>

  <p>"But it's a quite place. There is no light after dark there, and I have
  heard tell of robbers. It is lonely. Nothing happens there. The phonographs
  of the story-tellers, the kinematograph entertainments, the news
  machines&mdash;none of them are to be found there. If you are hungry there is
  no food, if you are ill no doctor..." He stopped.</p>

  <p>"We shall try it," said Denton, moving to go on. Then a thought struck
  him, and he made an agreement with the shepherd, and learnt where they might
  find him, to buy and bring them anything of which they stood in need, out of
  the city.</p>

  <p>And in the evening they came to the deserted village, with its houses that
  seemed so small and odd to them: they found it golden in glory of sunset, and
  desolate and still. They went from one deserted house to another, marvelling
  at their quint simplicity, and debating which they should choose. And at
  last, in a sunlit corner of a room that had lost its outer wall, they came
  upon a wild flower, a little flower of blue that the weeders of the Food
  Company had overlooked.</p>

  <p>That house they decided upon; but they did not remain in it long that
  night, because they were resolved to feast upon nature. And moreover the
  houses became very gaunt and shadowy after the sunlight had faded out of the
  sky. So after they had rested a little time they went to the crest of the
  hill again to see with their own eyes the silence of heaven set with stars,
  about which the old poets had, had so many things to tell. It was a wonderful
  sight, and Denton talked like the stars, and when they went down the hill at
  last the sky was pale with dawn. They slept but little, and in the morning
  when they woke a thrush was singing in a tree.</p>

  <p>So these young people of the twenty-second century began their exile. That
  morning they were busy exploring the resources of this new home in which they
  were going to live the simple life. They did not explore very fast or very
  far, because they went everywhere hand-in-hand; but they found the beginnings
  of some furniture. Beyond the village was a store of winter fodder for the
  sheep of the Food Company, and Denton dragged great armfuls to the house to
  make a bed; and in several of the houses were old fungus-eaten chairs and
  tables&mdash;rough, barbaric, clumsy furniture, it seemed to them, and made
  of wood. They repeated many of the things they had said on the previous day,
  and towards evening they found another flower, a harebell. In the late
  afternoon some Company shepherds went down the river valley riding on a big
  multicycle; they hid from them, because their presence, Elizabeth said,
  seemed to spoil the romance of this old-world place altogether.</p>

  <p>In this fashion they lived a week. For all that week the days were
  cloudless, and the nights, nights of starry glory, that were invaded each a
  little more by a crescent moon.</p>

  <p>Yet something of the first splendour of their coming faded&mdash;faded
  imperceptibly day after day; Denton's eloquence became fitful, and lacked
  fresh topics of inspiration; the fatigue of their long march from London told
  in a certain stiffness of the limbs, and each suffered from slight
  unaccountable cold. Moreover, Denton became aware of unoccupied time. In one
  place among the carelessly heaped lumber of the old times he found a
  rust-eaten spade, and with this he made a fitful attack on the razed and
  grass-grown garden&mdash;though he had nothing to plant or sow. He returned
  to Elizabeth with a sweat-streaming face, after half an hour of such
  work.</p>

  <p>"There were giants in those days," he said, not understanding what wont
  and training will do. And their walk that led them along the hills until they
  could see the city shimmering far away in the valley. "I wonder how things
  are going on there," he said.</p>

  <p>And then came a change in the weather. "Come out and see the clouds," she
  cried; and behold! They were a sombre purple in the north and east, streaming
  up to the zenith. And they went up the hill, these hurrying steamers blotted
  out the sunset. Suddenly the wind set the beech-trees swaying and whispering,
  and Elizabeth shivered. And then far away the lightning flashed, flashed like
  a sword that is drawn suddenly, and the distant thunder marched about the
  sky, and even as they stood astonished, pattering upon them came the first
  headlong raindrops of the storm. In an instant the last streak of sunset was
  hidden by a falling curtain of hail, and the lightning flashed again, and the
  voice of thunder roared louder, and all about them the world scowled dark and
  strange.</p>

  <p>Seizing hands, these children of the city ran down the hill to their home,
  in infinite astonishment. And ere they reached it, Elizabeth was weeping with
  dismay, and the darkling ground about them was white and brittle and active
  with the pelting hail.</p>

  <p>Then began a strange and terrible night for them. For the first time in
  their civilised lives they were in absolute darkness; they were wet and cold
  and shivering, all about them hissed the hail, and through the long neglected
  ceilings of the derelict home came noisy spouts of water and formed pools and
  rivulets on the creaking floors. As the gusts of the storm struck the
  worn-out building, it groaned and shuddered, and now a mass of plaster from
  the wall would slide and smash, and now some loosened tile would rattle down
  the roof and crash into the empty greenhouse below. Elizabeth shuddered, and
  still; Denton wrapped his gay and flimsy city cloak about her, and so they
  crouched in the darkness. And ever the thunder broke louder and nearer, and
  ever more lurid flashed the lightning, jerking into a momentary gaunt
  clearness the steaming, dripping room in which they sheltered.</p>

  <p>Never before had they been in the open air save when the sun was shining.
  All their time had been spent in the warm and airy ways and halls and rooms
  of the latter-day city. It was to them that night as if they were in some
  other world, some disordered chaos of stress and tumult, and almost beyond
  hoping that they should ever see the city ways again.</p>

  <p>The storm seemed to last interminably, until at last they dozed between
  the thunderclaps, and then very swiftly it fell and ceased. And as the last
  patter of rain died away they heard an unfamiliar sound.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" cried Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>It came again. It was the barking of dogs. It drove down the desert lane
  and passed; and through the window, whitening the wall before them and
  throwing upon it the shadow of the window-frame and of a tree in black
  silhouette, shone the light of the waxing moon.</p>

  <p>Just as the pale dawn was drawing the things about them into sight, the
  fitful barking of dogs came near again, and stopped. They listened. After a
  pause they heard the quick pattering of feet seeking round the house, and
  short, half-smothered barks. Then again everything was still.</p>

  <p>"Ssh!" whispered Elizabeth, and pointed to the door of their room.</p>

  <p>Denton went halfway towards the door, and stood listening. He came back
  with a face of affected unconcern. "They must be the sheep-dogs of the Food
  Company," he said. "They will do us no harm."</p>

  <p>He sat down again beside her. "What a night it has been!" he said, to hide
  how keenly he was listening.</p>

  <p>"I don't like dogs," answered Elizabeth, after a long silence.</p>

  <p>"Dogs never hurt any one," said Denton. "In the old days&mdash;in the
  nineteenth century&mdash;everybody had a dog."</p>

  <p>"There was a romance I heard once. A dog killed a man."</p>

  <p>"Not this sort of dog," said Denton confidently. "Some of those romances
  &mdash;are exaggerated."</p>

  <p>Suddenly a half bark and a pattering up the staircase; the sound of
  panting. Denton sprang to his feet and drew the sword out of the damp straw
  upon which they had been lying. Then in the doorway appeared a gaunt
  sheep-dog, and halted there. Behind it stared another. For an instant man and
  brute faced each other, hesitating.</p>

  <p>Then Denton, being ignorant of dogs, made a sharp step forward. "Go away,"
  he said, with a clumsy motion of his sword.</p>

  <p>The dog started and growled. Denton stopped sharply. "Good dog!" he
  said.</p>

  <p>The growling jerked into a bark.</p>

  <p>"Good dog!" said Denton. The second dog growled and barked. A third out of
  sight down the staircase took up the barking also. Outside others gave
  tongue&mdash;a large number it seemed to Denton.</p>

  <p>"This is annoying," said Denton, without taking his eyes off the brutes
  before him. "Of course the shepherds won't come out of the city for hours
  yet. Naturally these dogs don't quite make us out."</p>

  <p>"I can't hear," shouted Elizabeth. She stood and came to him.</p>

  <p>Denton tried again, but the barking still drowned his voice. The sound had
  a curious effect upon his blood. Odd disused emotions began to stir; his face
  changed as he shouted. He tried again; the barking seemed to mock him, and
  one dog danced a pace forward, bristling. Suddenly he turned, and uttering
  certain words in the dialect of the underways, words incomprehensible to
  Elizabeth, he made for the dogs. There was a sudden cessation of the barking,
  a growl and a snapping. Elizabeth saw the snarling head of the foremost dog,
  its white teeth and retracted ears, and the flash of the thrust blade. The
  brute leapt into the air and was flung back.</p>

  <p>Then Denton, with a shout, was driving the dogs before him. The sword
  flashed above his head with a sudden new freedom of gesture, and then he
  vanished down the staircase. She made six steps to follow him, and on the
  landing there was blood. She stopped, and hearing the tumult of dogs and
  Denton's shouts pass out of the house, ran to the window. Nine wolfish sheep-
  dogs were scattering, one writhed before the porch; and Denton, tasting that
  strange delight of combat that slumbers still in the blood of even the most
  civilised man, was shouting and running across the garden space. And then she
  saw something that for a moment he did not see. The dogs circled round this
  way and that, and came again. They had him in the open.</p>

  <p>In an instant she divined the situation. She would have called to him. For
  a moment she felt sick and helpless, and then, obeying a strange impulse, she
  gathered up her white skirt and ran downstairs. In the hall was the rusting
  spade. That was it! She seized it and ran out.</p>

  <p>She came none too soon. One dog rolled before him, well-nigh slashed in
  half; but a second had him by the thigh, a third gripped his collar behind,
  and a fourth had the blade of the sword between his teeth, tasting its own
  blood. He parried the leap of a fifth with his left arm.</p>

  <p>It might have been the first century instead of the twenty-second, so far
  as she was concerned. All the gentleness of her eighteen years of city life
  vanished before this primordial need. The spade smote hard and sure, and
  cleft a dog's skull. Another, crouching for a spring, yelped with dismay at
  this unexpected antagonist, and rushed aside. Two wasted precious moments on
  the binding of a feminine skirt.</p>

  <p>The collar of Denton's cloak tore and parted as he staggered back; and
  that dog too felt the spade, and ceased to trouble him. He sheathed his sword
  in the brute at his thigh.</p>

  <p>"To the wall!" cried Elizabeth; and in three seconds the fight was at an
  end, and our young people stood side by side, while a remnant of five dogs,
  with ears and tails of disaster, fled shamefully from the stricken field.</p>

  <p>For a moment they stood panting and victorious, and then Elizabeth,
  dropping her spade, covered her face, and sank to the ground in a paroxysm of
  weeping. Denton looked about him, thrust the point of his sword into the
  ground so that it was at hand, and stooped to comfort her.</p>

  <p>At last their more tumultuous emotions subsided, and they could talk
  again. She leant upon the wall, and he sat upon it so he could keep an eye
  open for any returning dogs. Two, at any rate, were up on the hillside and
  keeping up a vexatious barking.</p>

  <p>She was tear-stained, but not very wretched now, because for half an hour
  he had been repeating that she was brave and had saved his life. But a new
  fear was growing in her mind.</p>

  <p>"They are the dogs of the Food Company," she said. "There will be
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid so. Very likely they will prosecute us for trespass."</p>

  <p>A pause.</p>

  <p>"In the old times," he said, "this sort of thing happened day after
  day."</p>

  <p>"Last night!" she said. "I could not live through another such night."</p>

  <p>He looked at her. Her face was pale for want of sleep, and drawn and
  haggard. He came to a sudden resolution. "We must go back," he said.</p>

  <p>She looked at the dead dogs, and shivered. "We cannot stay here," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"We must go back," he repeated, glancing over his shoulder to see if the
  enemy kept their distance. "We have been happy for a time... But the world is
  too civilised. Ours is the age of cities. More of this will kill us."</p>

  <p>"But what are we to do? How can we live there?"</p>

  <p>Denton hesitated. His heel kicked against the wall on which he sat, "It's
  a thing I haven't mentioned before," he said, and coughed; "but..."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"You could raise money on your expectations," he said.</p>

  <p>"Could I?" she said eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Of course you could. What a child you are!"</p>

  <p>She stood up, and her face was bright. "Why did you not tell me before?"
  she asked. "And all this time we have been here!"</p>

  <p>He looked at her for a moment, and smiled. Then the smile vanished. "I
  thought it ought to come from you," he said. "I didn't like to ask for your
  money. And besides&mdash;at first I thought this would be rather fine."</p>

  <p>There was a pause.</p>

  <p>"It has been fine," he said; and glanced once more over his shoulder.
  "Until all this began."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "those first days. The first three days."</p>

  <p>They looked for a space into one another's faces, and then Denton slid
  down from the wall and took her hand.</p>

  <p>"To each generation," he said, "the life of its time. I see it all plainly
  now. In the city&mdash;that is the life to which we were born. To live in any
  other fashion... Coming here was a dream, and this&mdash;is the
  awakening."</p>

  <p>"It was a pleasant dream," she said&mdash;, "in the beginning."</p>

  <p>For a long space neither spoke.</p>

  <p>"If we would reach the city before the shepherds come here, we must
  start," said Denton. "We must get our food out of the house and eat as we
  go."</p>

  <p>Denton glanced about him again, and giving the dead dogs a wide berth,
  they walked across the garden space and into the house together. They found
  the wallet with their food, and descended the blood-stained stairs again. In
  the hall Elizabeth stopped. "One minute," she said. "There is something
  here."</p>

  <p>She led the way into the room in which that one little blue flower was
  blooming. She stooped to it, she touched it with her hand.</p>

  <p>"I want it," she said; and then, "I cannot take it..."</p>

  <p>Impulsively she stooped and kissed its petals.</p>

  <p>Then silently, side by side, they went across the empty garden-space into
  the old high road, and set their faces resolutely towards the distant city
  &mdash;towards the complex mechanical city of those latter days, the city
  that had swallowed up mankind.</p>

  3. THE WAYS OF THE CITY</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>, August 1897</h3>

  <p>Prominent if not paramount among world-changing inventions in the history
  of man is that series of contrivances in locomotion that began with the
  railway and ended for a century or more with the motor and the patent road.
  That these contrivances, together with the device of limited liability joint
  stock companies and the supersession of agricultural labourers by skilled men
  with ingenious machinery, would necessarily concentrate mankind in cities of
  unparalleled magnitude and work an entire revolution in human life, became
  after the event, a thing so obvious that it is a matter of astonishment it
  was not more clearly anticipated. Yet that any steps should be taken to
  anticipate the miseries such a revolution might entail does not appear even
  to have been suggested; and the idea that moral prohibitions and sanctions,
  the privileges and concessions, the conception of property and
  responsibility, of comfort and beauty, that had rendered the mainly
  agricultural states of the past prosperous and happy, would fail in the
  rising torrent of novel opportunities and novel stimulations, never seems to
  have entered the nineteenth-century mind. That a citizen, kindly and fair in
  his ordinary life, could as a shareholder become almost murderously greedy;
  that commercial methods that were reasonable and honourable on the
  old-fashioned countryside, should on an enlarged scale be deadly and
  overwhelming; that ancient charity was modern pauperisation, and ancient
  employment modern sweating; that in fact, a revision and enlargement of the
  duties and rights of man had become urgently necessary, were things it could
  not entertain, nourished as it was on an archaic system of education and
  profoundly retrospective and legal in all its habits of thought. It was known
  that the accumulation of men in cities involved unprecedented dangers of
  pestilence; there was an energetic development of sanitation; but that the
  diseases of gambling and usury, of luxury and tyranny should become endemic,
  and produce horrible consequences was beyond the scope of nineteenth-century
  thought. And so, as if it were some inorganic process, practically unhindered
  by the creative will of man, the growth of the swarming unhappy cities that
  mark the twenty-first century accomplished itself.</p>

  <p>The new society was divided into three main classes. At the summit
  slumbered the property owner, enormously rich by accident rather than design,
  potent save for the will and aim, the last avatar of Hamlet in the world.
  Below was the enormous multitude of workers employed by the gigantic
  companies that monopolised control; and between these two the dwindling
  middle class, officials of innumerable sorts, foreman, managers, the medical,
  legal, artistic, and scholastic classes, and the minor rich, a middle class
  whose members led a life of insecure luxury and precarious speculation amidst
  the movements of the great managers.</p>

  <p>Already the love story and the marrying of two persons of middle class
  have been told: how they overcame the obstacles between them, and how they
  tried the simple old-fashioned way of living on the countryside and came back
  speedily enough into the city of London. Denton had no means, so Elizabeth
  borrowed money on the securities that her father Mwres held in trust for her
  until she was one-and-twenty.</p>

  <p>The rate of interest she paid was of course high, because of the
  uncertainty of her security, and the arithmetic of lovers is often sketchy
  and optimistic. Yet they had very glorious times after that return. They
  determined they would not go to a Pleasure city nor waste their days rushing
  through the air from one part of the world to the other, for in spite of one
  disillusionment, their tastes were still old-fashioned. They furnished their
  little room with quaint old Victorian furniture, and found a shop on the
  forty-second floor in Seventh Way where printed books of the old sort were
  still to be bought. It was their pet affectation to read print instead of
  hearing phonographs. And when presently there came a sweet little girl, to
  unite them further if it were possible, Elizabeth would not send it to a
  Creche, as the custom was, but insisted on nursing it at home. The rent of
  their apartments was raised on account of this singular proceeding, but that
  they did not mind. It only meant borrowing a little more.</p>

  <p>Presently Elizabeth was of age, and Denton had a business interview with
  her father that was not agreeable. An exceedingly disagreeable interview with
  their money-lender followed, from which he brought home a white face. On his
  return Elizabeth had to tell of a new and marvellous intonation of "Goo" that
  their daughter had devised, but Denton was inattentive. In the midst, just as
  she was at the cream of her description, he interrupted. "How much money do
  you think we have left, now that everything is settled?"</p>

  <p>She stared and stopped her appreciative swaying of the Goo genius that had
  accompanied her description.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean...?</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered. "Ever so much. We have been wild. It's the interest.
  Or something. And the shares you had, slumped. Your father did not mind. Said
  it was not his business, after what had happened. He's going to marry
  again... Well&mdash;we have scarcely a thousand left!"</p>

  <p>"Only a thousand?"</p>

  <p>"Only a thousand."</p>

  <p>And Elizabeth sat down. For a moment she regarded him with a white face,
  then her eyes went about the quaint, old-fashioned room, with its middle
  Victorian furniture and genuine oleographs, and rested at last on the little
  lump of humanity within her arms.</p>

  <p>Denton glanced at her and stood downcast. Then he swung round on his heel
  and walked up and down very rapidly.</p>

  <p>"I must get something to do," he broke out presently. "I am an idle
  scoundrel. I ought to have thought of this before. I have been a selfish
  fool. I wanted to be with you all day..."</p>

  <p>He stopped, looking at her white face. Suddenly he came and kissed her and
  the little face that nestled against her breast.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, dear," he said, standing over her; "you won't be lonely
  now&mdash;now Dings is beginning to talk to you. And I can soon get something
  to do, you know. Soon... Easily... It's only a shock at first. But it will
  come all right. It's only to come right. I will go out again as soon as I
  have rested, and find what can be done. For the present it's hard to think of
  anything..."</p>

  <p>"It would be hard to leave these rooms," said Elizabeth; "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There won't be any need of that&mdash;trust me."</p>

  <p>"They are expensive."</p>

  <p>Denton waved that aside. He began talking of the work he could do. He was
  not very explicit what it would be; but he was quite sure that there was
  something to keep them comfortably in the happy middle class, whose way of
  life was the only one they knew.</p>

  <p>"There are three-and-thirty million people in London," he said; "some of
  them must have need of me."</p>

  <p>"Some must."</p>

  <p>"The trouble is... Well&mdash;Bindon, that brown little old man your
  father wanted you to marry. He's an important person... I can't go back to my
  flying-stage work, because he is now a Commissioner of the Flying Stage
  Clerks."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know that," said Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"He was made that in the last few weeks... or things would be easy enough,
  for they liked me on the flying stage. But there's dozens of other things to
  be done&mdash;dozens. Don't you worry dear. I'll rest a little while, and
  then we'll dine, and then I'll start on my rounds. I know lots of
  people&mdash;lots."</p>

  <p>So they rested, and then they went to the public dining-room and dined,
  and then he started on his search for employment. But they soon realised that
  in the matter of one convenience the world was just as badly off as it had
  ever been, and that was a nice, secure, honourable, remunerative employment,
  leaving ample leisure for the private life, and demanding no special ability,
  no violent exertion nor risk, and no sacrifice of any sort for its
  attainment. He evolved a number of brilliant projects, and spent many days
  hurrying from one part of the enormous city to another in search of
  influential friends; and all his influential friends were glad to see him,
  and very sanguine until it came to definite proposals, and then they became
  guarded and vague. He would part with them coldly, and think over their
  behaviour, and get irritated on his way back, and stop at some telephone
  office and spend money on an animated but unprofitable quarrel. And as the
  days passed, he got so worried and irritated, that even to seem kind and
  careless before Elizabeth cost him an effort&mdash;as she, being a loving
  woman, perceived very clearly.</p>

  <p>After an extremely complex preface one day, she helped him out with a
  painful suggestion. He had expected her to weep and give way to despair when
  it came to selling all their joyfully bought early Victorian treasures, their
  quaint objects of art, their antimacassars, bead mats, repp curtains,
  veneered furniture, gold-framed steel engravings and pencil drawings, wax
  flowers under shades, stuffed birds, and all sorts of choice old things; but
  it was she who made the proposal. The sacrifice seemed to fill her with
  pleasure, and so did the idea of shifting to apartments ten or twelve floors
  lower in another hotel. "So long as Dings is with us, nothing matters," she
  said. "It's all experience." So he kissed her, said she was braver than when
  she fought the sheep-dogs, called her Boadicea, and abstained very carefully
  from reminding her that they would have to pay a considerably higher rent on
  account of the little voice with which Dings greeted the perpetual uproar of
  the city.</p>

  <p>His idea had been to get Elizabeth out of the way when it came to selling
  the absurd furniture about which their affections were twined and tangled;
  but when it came to the sale it was Elizabeth who haggled with the dealer
  while Denton went about the running ways of the city, white and sick with
  sorrow and fear of what was still to come. When they moved into their
  sparsely furnished pink-and-white apartments in a cheap hotel, there came an
  outbreak of furious energy on his part, and then nearly a week of lethargy
  during which he sulked at home. Through those days Elizabeth shone like a
  star, and at the end Denton's misery found a vent in tears. And then he went
  out into the city ways again, and&mdash;to his utter amazement&mdash;found
  some work to do.</p>

  <p>His standard of employment had fallen steadily until at last it had
  reached the lowest level of independent workers. At first he had aspired to
  some high official position in great Flying or Windvane or Water Companies,
  or to an appointment on one of the General Intelligence Organisations that
  had replaced newspapers, or to some professional partnership, but those were
  the dreams of the beginning. From that he had passed to speculation, and
  three hundred gold "lions" out of Elizabeth's thousand had vanished one
  evening in the share market. Now he was glad his good looks secured him a
  trial in the position of salesman to the Suzannah Hat Syndicate, a Syndicate
  dealing in ladies' caps, hair decorations, and hats&mdash;for though the city
  was completely covered in, ladies still wore extremely elaborate and
  beautiful hats at the theatres and places of public worship.</p>

  <p>It would have been amusing if one could have confronted a Regent Street
  shopkeeper of the nineteenth century with the development of his
  establishment in which Denton's duties lay. Nineteenth Way was still
  sometimes called Regent Street, but it was now a street of moving platforms
  and nearly eight hundred feet wide. The middle space was immovable and gave
  access by staircases descending into subterranean ways to the houses on
  either side. Right and left were an ascending series of continuous platforms
  each of which travelled about five miles an hour faster than the one internal
  to it, so that one could step from platform to platform until one reached the
  swiftest outer way and so go about the city. The establishment of the
  Suzannah Hat Syndicate projected a vast facade upon the outer way, sending
  out overhead at either end an overlapping series of huge white glass screens,
  on which gigantic animated pictures of the faces of well-known beautiful
  living women wearing novelties in hats were thrown. A dense crowd was always
  collected in the stationary central way watching a vast kinematograph which
  displayed the changing fashion. The whole front of the building was in
  perpetual chromatic change, and all down the facade&mdash;four hundred feet
  it measured&mdash;and all across the street of moving ways, laced and winked
  and glittered in a thousand varieties of colour and lettering the
  inscription&mdash;</p>

  <p>Suzanna! 'Ets! Suzanna! 'Ets!</p>

  <p>A Broadside of gigantic phonographs drowned all conversation in the moving
  way and roared "hats" at the passer-by, while far down the street and up,
  other batteries counselled the public to "walk down for Suzannah," and
  queried, "Why don't you buy the girl a hat?"</p>

  <p>For the benefit of those who chanced to be deaf&mdash;and deafness was not
  uncommon in London of that age, inscriptions of all sizes were thrown from
  the roof above upon the moving platforms themselves, and on one's hand or on
  the bald head of the man before one, or on a lady's shoulders, or in a sudden
  jet of flame before one's feet, the moving fingers wrote in unanticipated
  letters of fire "'ets r chip t'de," or simply "ets." And spite of all these
  efforts so high was the pitch at which the city lived, so trained became
  one's eyes and ears to ignore all sorts of advertisement, that many a citizen
  had passed that place thousands of times and was still unaware of the
  existence of the Suzannah Hat Syndicate.</p>

  <p>To enter the building one descended the staircase in the middle way and
  walked through a public passage in which pretty girls promenaded, girls who
  were willing to wear a ticked hat for a small fee. The entrance chamber was a
  large hall, in wax heads fashionably adorned rotated gracefully upon
  pedestals, and from this one passed through a cash office to an interminable
  series of little rooms, each room with its salesman, its three or four hats
  and pins, its mirrors, its kinematographs, telephones and hat slides in
  communication with the central depot, its comfortable lounge and tempting
  refreshments. A salesman in such an apartment did Denton now become. It was
  his business to attend to any of the incessant stream of ladies who chose to
  stop with him, to behave as winningly as possible, to offer refreshment, to
  converse on any topic the possible customer chose, and to guide the
  conversation dexterously but not insistently towards hats. He was to suggest
  trying on various types of hat and to show by his manner and bearing, but
  without any coarse flattery, the enhanced impression made by the hats he
  wished to sell. He had several mirrors, adapted by various subtleties of
  curvature and tint to different types of face and complexion, and much
  depended on the proper use of these.</p>

  <p>Denton flung himself at these curious and not very congenial duties with a
  good will and energy that would have amazed him a year before; but all to no
  purpose. The Senior Manageress, who had selected him for appointment and
  conferred various small marks of favour upon him, suddenly changed in her
  manner, declared for no assignable cause that he was stupid, and dismissed
  him at the end of six weeks of salesmanship. So Denton had to resume his
  ineffectual search for employment.</p>

  <p>This second search did not last very long. Their money was at the ebb. To
  eke it out a little longer they resolved to part with their darling Dings,
  and took that small person to one of the public creches that abounded in the
  city. That was the common use of the time. The industrial emancipation of
  women, the correlated disorganisation of the secluded "home," had rendered
  creches a necessity for all but very rich and exceptionally-minded people.
  Therein children encountered hygienic and educational advantages impossible
  without such organisation. Creches were of all classes and types of luxury,
  down to those of Labour Company, were children were taken on credit, to be
  redeemed in labour as they grew up.</p>

  <p>But both Denton and Elizabeth being, as I have explained, strange old-
  fashioned young people, full of nineteenth-century ideas, hated these
  convenient creches exceedingly and at last took their little daughter to one
  with extreme reluctance. They were received by a motherly person in a uniform
  who was very brisk and prompt in her manner until Elizabeth wept at the
  mention of parting from her child. The motherly person, after a brief
  astonishment at this unusual emotion, changed suddenly into a creature of
  hope and comfort, and so won Elizabeth's gratitude for life. They were
  conducted into a vast room presided over by several nurses and with hundreds
  of two-year-old girls grouped about the toy-covered floor. This was the
  Two-year-old Room. Two nurses came forward, and Elizabeth watched their
  bearing towards Dings with jealous eyes. They were kind&mdash;it was clear
  they felt kind, and yet...</p>

  <p>Presently it was time to go. By that time Dings was happily established in
  a corner, sitting on the floor with her arms filled, and herself, indeed, for
  the most part hidden by an unaccustomed wealth of toys. She seemed careless
  of all human relationships as her parents receded.</p>

  <p>They were forbidden to upset her by saying good-bye.</p>

  <p>At the door Elizabeth glanced back for the last time, and behold! Dings
  had dropped her new wealth and was standing with a dubious face. Suddenly
  Elizabeth gasped, and the motherly nurse pushed her forward and closed the
  door.</p>

  <p>"You can come again soon, dear," she said, with unexpected tenderness in
  her eyes. For a moment Elizabeth stared at her with a blank face. "You can
  come again soon," repeated the nurse. Then with a swift transition Elizabeth
  was weeping in the nurse's arms. So it was that Denton's heart was won
  also.</p>

  <p>And three weeks after our young people were absolutely penniless, and only
  one way lay open. They must go to the Labour Company. So soon as the rent was
  a week overdue their few remaining possessions were seized, and with scant
  courtesy they were shown the way out of the hotel. Elizabeth walked along the
  passage towards the staircase that ascended to the motionless middle way, too
  dulled by misery to think. Denton stopped behind to finish a stinging and
  unsatisfactory argument with the hotel porter, and then came hurrying after
  her, flushed and hot. He slackened his pace as he overtook her, and together
  they ascended to the middle way in silence. There they found two seats vacant
  and sat down.</p>

  <p>"We need not go there&mdash;yet?" said Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not till we are hungry," said Denton.</p>

  <p>They said no more.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth's eyes sought a resting-place and found none. To the right
  roared the eastward ways, to the left the ways in the opposite direction,
  swarming with people. Backwards and forwards along a cable overhead rushed a
  string of gesticulating men, dressed like clowns, each marked on back and
  crest with one gigantic letter, so that altogether they spelt out:</p>

  <p>"Purkinje's Digestive Pills."</p>

  <p>An anaemic little woman in horrible coarse blue canvas pointed a little
  girl to one of this string hurrying advertisements.</p>

  <p>"Look!" said the anaemic women: "There's yer father."</p>

  <p>"Which?" said the little girl.</p>

  <p>"'Im wiv his nose coloured red," said the anaemic woman.</p>

  <p>The little girl began to cry, and even Elizabeth could have cried too.</p>

  <p>"Ain't 'e kickin' 'is legs&mdash;! Just!" said the anaemic woman in the
  blue, trying to make things bright again. "Looky&mdash;now!"</p>

  <p>On the facade to the right a huge intensely bright disc of weird colour
  span incessantly, and letters of fire that came and went spelt out&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Does This Make You Giddy?"</p>

  <p>Then a pause, followed by&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Take A Purkinje's Digestive Pill."</p>

  <p>A vast and desolating braying began. "If you love Swagger Literature, put
  your telephone on to Bruggles, the Greatest Author of All Time. The Greatest
  Thinker of all time. Teaches you Morals up to your Scalp! The very image of
  Socrates, except the back of his head, which is like Shakespeare. He has six
  toes, dresses in red, and never cleans his teeth. Hear Him!"</p>

  <p>Denton's voice became audible in a gap in the uproar. "I never ought to
  have married you," he was saying. "I have wasted your money, ruined you,
  brought you to misery. I am a scoundrel... Oh, this accursed world!"</p>

  <p>She tried to speak, and for some moments could not. She grasped his hand.
  "No," she said at last. A half-formed desire suddenly became determination.
  She stood up. "Will you come?"</p>

  <p>He rose also. "We need not go there yet."</p>

  <p>"Not that. But I want you to come to the flying stages&mdash;where we met.
  You know? The little seat."</p>

  <p>He hesitated. "Can you?" he said, doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Must," she answered.</p>

  <p>He hesitated still for a moment, then moved to obey her will.</p>

  <p>And so it was they spent their last half-day of freedom out under the open
  air in the little seat under the flying stages where they had been wont to
  meet five short years ago. There she told him, what she could not tell him in
  the tumultuous public ways, that she did not repent even now of their
  marriage&mdash;that whatever discomfort and misery life still had for them,
  she was content with things that had been. The weather was kind to them, the
  seat was sunlit and warm, and overhead the shining aeroplanes went and
  came.</p>

  <p>At last towards sunsetting their time was at an end, and they made their
  vows to one another and clasped hands, and then rose up and went back into
  the ways of the city, a shabby-looking, heavy-hearted pair, tired and hungry.
  Soon they came to one of the pale blue signs that marked a Labour Company
  Bureau. For a space they stood in the middle way regarding this and at last
  descended, and entered the waiting-room.</p>

  <p>The Labour Company had originally been a charitable organisation; its aim
  was to supply food, shelter, and work to all comers. This it was bound to do
  by the conditions of its incorporation, and it was also bound to supply food
  and shelter and medical attendance to all incapable of work who chose to
  demand its aid. In exchange these incapables paid labour notes, which they
  had to redeem upon recovery. They signed these labour notes with thumb-marks,
  which were photographed and indexed in such a way that this world-wide Labour
  Company could identify any one of its two or three hundred million clients at
  the cost of an hour's inquiry. The day's labour was defined as two spells in
  a treadmill used in generating electrical force, or its equivalent, and its
  due performance could be enforced by law. In practice the Labour Company
  found it advisable to add to its statutory obligations of food and shelter a
  few pence a day as an inducement to effort; and its enterprise had not only
  abolished pauperisation altogether, but supplied practically all but the very
  highest and most responsible labour throughout the world. Nearly a third of
  the population of the world were its serfs and debtors from the cradle to the
  grave.</p>

  <p>In this practical, unsentimental way the problem of the unemployed had
  been most satisfactorily met and overcome. No one starved in the public ways,
  and no rags, no costume less sanitary and sufficient than the Labour
  Company's hygienic but inelegant blue canvas, pained the eye throughout the
  whole world. It was the constant theme of the phonographic newspapers how
  much the world had progressed since nineteenth-century days, when the bodies
  of those killed by the vehicular traffic or dead of starvation were, they
  alleged, a common feature in all the busier streets.</p>

  <p>Denton and Elizabeth sat apart in the waiting-room until their turn came.
  Most of the others collected there seemed limp and taciturn, but three or
  four young people gaudily dressed made up for the quietude of their
  companions. They were life clients of the Company, born in the Company's
  creche and destined to die in its hospital, and they had been out for a spree
  with some shillings or so, of extra pay. They talked vociferously in a later
  development of the Cockney dialect, manifestly very proud of themselves.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth's eyes went from these to the less assertive figures. One seemed
  exceptionally pitiful to her. It was a women of perhaps forty-five, with
  gold-stained hair and a painted face, down which abundant tears had trickled;
  she had a pinched nose, hungry eyes, lean hands and shoulders, and her dusty
  worn-out finery told the story of her life. Another was a grey-bearded old
  man in the costume of a bishop of one of the high episcopal sects&mdash;for
  religion was now also a business, and had its ups and downs. And besides him
  a sickly, dissipated-looking boy of perhaps two-and-twenty glared at
  Fate.</p>

  <p>Presently Elizabeth and then Denton interviewed the manageress&mdash;for
  the Company preferred women in this capacity&mdash;and found she possessed an
  energetic face, a contemptuous manner, and a particularly unpleasant voice.
  They were given various cheques, including one to certify that they need not
  have their heads cropped; and when they had given their thumb-marks, learnt
  the number corresponding thereunto, and exchanged their shabby middle-class
  clothes for duly numbered canvas suits, they repaired to the huge plain
  dining-room for their first meal under these new conditions. Afterwards they
  were to return to her for instructions about their work.</p>

  <p>When they had made the exchange of their clothing Elizabeth did not seem
  able to look at Denton at first; but he looked at her, and saw with
  astonishment that even in blue canvas she was still beautiful. And then their
  soup and bread came sliding on its little rail down the long table towards
  them and stopped with a jerk, and he forgot the matter. For they had, had no
  proper meal for three days.</p>

  <p>After they had dined they rested for a time. Neither talked&mdash;there
  was nothing to say; and presently they got up and went back to the manageress
  to learn what they had to do.</p>

  <p>The manageress referred to a tablet. "Y'r rooms won't be here; it'll be in
  the Highbury Ward, ninety-seventh way, number two thousand and seventeen.
  Better make a note of it on y'r card. You, nought nought nought, type seven,
  sixty-four, b.c.d., gamma forty-one, female; you 'ave to go to the Metal-
  beating Company, and try that for a day&mdash;fourpence bonus if ye're
  satisfactory; and you, nought seven one, type four, seven hundred and nine,
  g.f.b., pi five and ninety, male; you 'ave to go to the Photographic Company
  on Eighty-first way, and learn something or other&mdash;I don't
  know&mdash;thrippence. 'Ere's y'r cards. That's all. Next! What? Didn't catch
  it all? Lor! So, suppose I must go over it all again. Why don't you listen?
  Keerless, unprovident people! One'd think these things didn't matter."</p>

  <p>Their ways to their work lay together for a time. And now they found they
  could talk. Curiously enough, the worst of their depression seemed over now
  that they had actually donned the blue. Denton could talk with interest even
  of the work that lay before them. "Whatever it is," he said, "it can't be so
  hateful as that hat shop. And after we have paid for Dings, we shall still
  have a whole penny a day between us even now. Afterwards&mdash;we may improve
  &mdash;, get more money."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth was less inclined to speech. "I wonder why work should seem so
  hateful," she said.</p>

  <p>"It's odd," said Denton. "I suppose it wouldn't be if it were not the
  thought of being ordered about... I hope we shall have decent managers."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth did not answer. She was not thinking of that. She was tracing
  out some thoughts of her own.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she said presently, "we have been using up work all our
  lives. It's only fair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped. It was too intricate.</p>

  <p>"We paid for it," said Denton, for at that time he had not troubled
  himself about these complicated things. "We did nothing&mdash;and yet we paid
  for it. That's what I cannot understand."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we are paying," said Elizabeth presently&mdash;for her theology
  was old-fashioned and simple.</p>

  <p>Presently it was time for them to part, and each went to the appointed
  work. Denton's was to mind a complicated hydraulic press that seemed almost
  an intelligent thing. This press worked by the sea-water that was destined
  finally to flush the city drains&mdash;for the world had long since abandoned
  the folly of pouring drinkable water into its sewers. This water was brought
  close to the eastward edge of the city by a huge canal, and then raised by an
  enormous battery of pumps into reservoirs at a level of four hundred feet
  above the sea, from which it spread by a billion arterial branches over the
  city. Thence it poured down, cleansing, sluicing, working machinery of all
  sorts, through an infinite variety of capillary channels into the great
  drains, the cloacae maximae, and so carried the sewage out to the
  agricultural areas that surrounded London on every side.</p>

  <p>The press was employed in one of the processes of the photographic
  manufacture, but the nature of the process it did not concern Denton to
  understand. The most salient fact to his mind was that it had to be conducted
  in ruby light, and as a consequence the room in which he worked was lit by
  one coloured globe that poured a lurid and painful illumination about the
  room. In the darkest corner stood the press whose servant Denton had now
  become; it was a huge, dim, glittering thing with a projecting hood that had
  a remote resemblance to a bowed head, and squatting like some metal Buddha in
  this weird light that ministered to its needs, it seemed to Denton in certain
  moods almost as if this must needs be the obscure idol to which humanity in
  some strange aberration had offered up his life. His duties had a varied
  monotony. Such items as the following will convey an idea of the service of
  the press. The thing worked with a busy clicking so long as things went well;
  but if the paste that came pouring through a feeder from another room and
  which it was perpetually compressing into thin plates, changed in quality the
  rhythm of its click altered and Denton hastened to make certain adjustments.
  The slightest delay involved a waste of paste and the docking of one or more
  of his daily pence. If the supply of paste waned&mdash;there were hand
  processes of a peculiar sort involved in its preparation, and sometimes the
  workers had convulsions which deranged their output&mdash;Denton had to throw
  the press out of gear. In the painful vigilance a multitude of such trivial
  attentions entailed, painful because of the incessant effort its absence of
  natural interest required, Denton had now to pass one-third of his days. Save
  for an occasional visit from the manager, a kindly but singularly
  foul-mouthed man, Denton passed his working hours in solitude.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth's work was of a more social sort. There was a fashion for
  covering the apartments of the very wealthy with metal plates beautifully
  embossed with repeated patterns. The taste of the time demanded, however,
  that the repetition of the patterns should not be exact&mdash;not mechanical,
  but "natural&mdash;" and it was found that the most pleasing arrangement of
  pattern irregularity was obtained by employing women of refinement and
  natural taste to punch out the patterns with small dites. So many square feet
  of plates was exacted from Elizabeth as a minimum, and for whatever square
  feet she did in excess she received a small payment. The room, like most
  rooms of women workers, was under a manageress: men had been found by the
  Labour Company not only less exacting but extremely liable to excuse favoured
  ladies from a proper share of their duties. The manageress was a not
  unkindly, taciturn person, with the hardened remains of beauty of the
  brunette type; and the other women workers, who of course hated her,
  associated her name scandalously with one of the metal-work directors in
  order to explain her position.</p>

  <p>Only two or three of Elizabeth's fellow-workers were born labour serfs;
  plain, morose girls, but most of them corresponded to what the nineteenth
  century would have called a "reduced" gentlewoman. But the ideal of what
  constituted a gentlewoman had altered: the faint, faded, negative virtue, the
  modulated voice and restrained gesture of the old-fashioned gentlewoman had
  vanished from the earth. Most of her companions showed in discoloured hair,
  ruined complexions, and the texture of their reminiscent conversations, the
  vanished glories of a conquering youth. All of these artistic workers were
  much older than Elizabeth, and two openly expressed their surprise that
  anyone so young and pleasant should come to share their toil. But Elizabeth
  did not trouble them with her old-world moral conceptions.</p>

  <p>They were permitted, and even encouraged to converse with each other, for
  the directors very properly judged that anything that conduced to variations
  of mood made for pleasing fluctuations in their patterning; and Elizabeth was
  almost forced to hear the stories of these lives with which her own
  interwove: garbled and distorted they were by vanity indeed and yet
  comprehensible enough. And soon she began to appreciate the small spites and
  cliques, the little misunderstandings and alliances that enmeshed about her.
  One woman was excessively garrulous and descriptive about a wonderful son of
  hers; another had cultivated a foolish coarseness of speech, that she seemed
  to regard as the wittiest expression of originality conceivable; a third
  mused for ever on dress, and whispered to Elizabeth how she saved her pence
  day after day, and would presently have a glorious day of freedom, wearing...
  and then followed hours of description; two others sat always together, and
  called one another pet names, until one day some little thing happened, and
  they sat apart, blind and deaf as it seemed to one another's being. And
  always from them all came an incessant tap, tap, tap, tap, and the manageress
  listened always to the rhythm to mark if one fell away. Tap, tap, tap, tap:
  so their days passed, so their lives must pass. Elizabeth sat among them,
  kindly and quiet, gray-hearted, marvelling at Fate: tap, tap, tap; tap, tap,
  tap; tap, tap, tap.</p>

  <p>So there came to Denton and Elizabeth a long succession of laborious days,
  that hardened their hands, wove strange threads of some new and sterner
  substance into the soft prettiness of their lives, and drew grave lines and
  shadows on their faces. The bright, convenient ways of the former life had
  receded to an inaccessible distance; slowly they learnt the lesson of the
  under-world&mdash;sombre and laborious, vast and pregnant. There were many
  little things that happened: things that would be tedious and miserable to
  tell, things that were bitter and grievous to bear&mdash;indignities,
  tyrannies, such as must ever season the bread of the poor in cities; and one
  thing that was not little, but seemed like the utter blackening of life to
  them, which was that the child they had given life to, sickened and died. But
  that story, that ancient perpetually recurring story, has been told so often,
  has been told so beautifully, that there is no need to tell it over again
  here. There was the same sharp fear, the same anxiety, the deferred
  inevitable blow, and the black silence. It has always been the same; it will
  always be the same. It is one of the things that must be.</p>

  <p>And it was Elizabeth who was first to speak, after an aching, dull
  interspace of days: not indeed, of the foolish little name that was a name no
  longer, but of the darkness that brooded over her soul. They had come through
  the shrieking, tumultuous ways of the city together; the clamour of trade, of
  yelling competitive religions, of political appeal, had beat upon deaf ears;
  the glare of focused lights, of dancing letters, and fiery advertisements,
  had fallen upon the set, miserable faces unheeded. They took their dinner in
  the dining-hall at a place apart. "I want," said Elizabeth clumsily, "to go
  out to the flying stages&mdash;to that seat. Here, one can say
  nothing..."</p>

  <p>Denton looked at her. "It will be night," he said.</p>

  <p>"I have asked&mdash;, it is a fine night." She stopped.</p>

  <p>He perceived she could find no words to explain herself. Suddenly he
  understood that she wished to see the stars once more, the stars they had
  watched together from the open downland in that wild honeymoon of theirs five
  years ago. Something caught at his throat. He looked away from her.</p>

  <p>"There will be plenty of time to go," he said, in a matter-of-fact
  tone.</p>

  <p>And at last they came out to their little seat on the flying stage, and
  sat there for a long time in silence. The little seat was in shadow, but the
  zenith was pale blue with the effulgence of the stage overhead, and all the
  city spread below them, squares and circles and patches of brilliance caught
  in a mesh-work of light. The little stars seemed very faint and small: near
  as they had been to the old-world watcher, they had become now infinitely
  remote. Yet one could see them in the darkened patches amidst the glare, and
  especially in the northward sky, the ancient constellations gliding steadfast
  and patient about the pole.</p>

  <p>Long our two people sat in silence, and at last Elizabeth sighed.</p>

  <p>"If I understood," she said, "if I could understand. When one is down
  there the city seems everything&mdash;the noise, the hurry, the voices
  &mdash;you must live, you must scramble. Here&mdash;it is nothing; a thing
  that passes. One can think in peace."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Denton. "How flimsy it all is! From here more than half of it
  is swallowed by the night... It will pass."</p>

  <p>"We shall pass first," said Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"I know," said Denton. "If life were not a moment, the whole of history
  would seem like the happening of a day... Yes&mdash;we shall pass. And the
  city will pass, and all the things that are to come. Man and the Overman and
  wonders unspeakable. And yet..."</p>

  <p>He paused, and then began afresh. "I know what you feel. At least I
  fancy... Down there one thinks of one's work, one's little vexations and
  pleasures, one's eating and drinking and ease and pain. One lives, and one
  must die. Down there and everyday&mdash;our sorrow seemed the end of life...
  Up here it is different. For instance, down there it would seem impossible
  almost to go on living if one were horribly disfigured, horribly crippled,
  disgraced. Up here&mdash;under these stars&mdash;none of those things would
  matter. They don't matter... They are part of something. One seems just to
  touch that something&mdash;under the stars..."</p>

  <p>He stopped. The vague, impalpable things in his mind, cloudy emotions half
  shaped towards ideas, vanished before the rough grasp of words. "It is hard
  to express," he said lamely.</p>

  <p>They sat through a long stillness.</p>

  <p>"It is well to come here," he said at last. "We stop&mdash;our minds are
  very finite. After all we are just poor animals rising out of the brute, each
  with a mind, the poor beginning of a mind. We are so stupid. So much hurts.
  And yet... I know, I know&mdash;and some day we shall see. All this frightful
  stress, all this discord will resolve to harmony, and we shall know it.
  Nothing is, but it makes for that. Nothing. All the failures&mdash;every
  little thing makes for that harmony. Everything is necessary to it, we shall
  find. We shall find. Nothing, not even the most dreadful thing, could be left
  out. Not even the most trivial. Every tap of your hammer on the brass, every
  moment of work, my idleness even... Dear one! Every movement of our poor
  little one... All these things go on for ever. And the faint impalpable
  things. We, sitting here together&mdash;Everything..."</p>

  <p>"The passion that joined us, and what has come since. It is not passion
  now. More than anything else it is sorrow. Dear..."</p>

  <p>He could say no more, could follow his thoughts no further.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth made no answer&mdash;she was very still; but presently her hand
  sought his and found it.</p>

  4. UNDERNEATH</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>, September 1897</h3>

  <p>Under the stars one may reach upward and touch resignation, whatever the
  evil thing may be, but in the heat and stress of the day's work we lapse
  again, come disgust and anger and intolerable moods. How little is all our
  magnanimity&mdash;an accident! A phase! The very Saints of old had first to
  flee their world. And Denton and his Elizabeth could not flee their world, no
  longer were there open roads to unclaimed lands where men might live
  freely&mdash;however hardly&mdash;and keep their souls in peace. The city had
  swallowed up mankind.</p>

  <p>For a time these two Labour Serfs were kept at their original occupations,
  she at her brass stamping and Denton at his press; and then came a move for
  him that brought with it fresh and still bitterer experiences of life in the
  underways of the great city. He was transferred to the care of a rather more
  elaborate press in the central factory of London Tile Trust.</p>

  <p>In this new situation he had to work in a long vaulted room with a number
  of other men, for the most part born Labour Serfs. He came to this
  intercourse reluctantly. His upbringing had been refined, and until his ill
  fortune had brought him to that costume, he had never spoken in his life,
  except by way of command or some immediate necessity, to the white-faced
  wearers of the blue canvas. Now at last came contact; he had to work beside
  them, share their tools, eat with them. To both Elizabeth and himself this
  seemed a further degradation.</p>

  <p>His taste would have seemed extreme to a man of the nineteenth century.
  But slowly and inevitably in the intervening years a gulf had opened between
  the wearers of the blue canvas and the classes above, a difference not simply
  of circumstance and habits of life, but of habits of thought&mdash;even of
  language. The underways had developed a dialect of their own: above too, had
  arisen a dialect, a code of thought, a language of "culture," which aimed by
  a sedulous search after fresh distinction, to widen perpetually the space
  between itself and "vulgarity." The bond of a common faith, moreover no
  longer held the race together. The last years of the nineteenth century were
  distinguished by the rapid development among the prosperous idle of esoteric
  perversions of the popular religion: glosses and interpretations that reduced
  the broad teachings of the carpenter of Nazareth to the exquisite narrowness
  of their lives. And spite of their inclination towards the ancient fashion of
  living, neither Elizabeth nor Denton had been sufficiently original to escape
  the suggestion of their surroundings. In matters of common behaviour they had
  followed the ways of their class, and so when they fell at last to be Labour
  Serfs it seemed to them almost as though they were falling among offensive
  inferior animals; they felt as a nineteenth-century duke and duchess might
  have felt, who were forced to take rooms in the Jago.</p>

  <p>Their natural impulse was to maintain a "distance." But Denton's first
  idea of a dignified isolation from his new surroundings was soon rudely
  dispelled. He had imagined that his fall to the position of a Labour Serf was
  the end of his lesson, that when their little daughter had died he had
  plumbed the deeps of life; but indeed these things were only the beginning.
  Life demands something more from us than acquiescence. And now in a roomful
  of machine minders he was to learn a wider lesson, to make the acquaintance
  of another factor in life, a factor as elemental as the loss of things dear
  to us, more elemental even than toil.</p>

  <p>His quite discouragement of conversation was an immediate cause of
  offence&mdash;was interpreted, rightly enough I fear, as disdain. His
  ignorance of the vulgar dialect, a thing upon which he had hitherto prided
  himself, suddenly took upon itself a new aspect. He failed to perceive at
  once that his reception of the coarse and stupid but genially intended
  remarks that greeted his appearance, must have stung the makers of these
  advances like blows in their faces. "Don't understand," he said rather
  coldly, and at hazard, "No, thank you."</p>

  <p>The man who had addressed him stared, scowled and turned away.</p>

  <p>A second, who also failed at Denton's unaccustomed ear, took the trouble
  to repeat his remark, and Denton discovered he was being offered the use of
  an oil can. He expressed polite thanks, and this second man embarked upon a
  penetrating conversation. Denton, he remarked had been a swell, and he wanted
  to know how he had come to wear the blue. He clearly expected an interesting
  record of vice and extravagance. Had Denton ever been at a Pleasure City?
  Denton was speedily to discover how existence of these wonderful places of
  delight permeated and defiled the thought and honour of these unwilling,
  hopeless workers of the underworld.</p>

  <p>His aristocratic temperament resented these questions. He answered "No"
  curtly. The man persisted with a still more personal question, and this time
  it was Denton who turned away.</p>

  <p>"Gorblimey!" said his interlocutor, much astonished.</p>

  <p>It presently forced itself upon Denton's mind that this remarkable
  conversation was being repeated in indignant tones to more sympathetic
  hearers, and that it gave rise to astonishment and ironical laughter. They
  looked at Denton with manifestly enhanced interest. A curious perception of
  isolation dawned upon him. He tried to think of his press and its unfamiliar
  peculiarities...</p>

  <p>The machines kept everybody pretty busy during the first spell, and then
  came a recess. It was only an interval for refreshment, to brief for any one
  to go out to a Labour Company dining-room. Denton followed his fellow-workers
  into a short gallery, in which were a number of bins and refuse from the
  presses.</p>

  <p>Each man produced a packet of food. Denton had no packet. The manager, a
  careless young man who held his position by influence, had omitted to warn
  Denton that it was necessary to apply for this provision. He stood apart,
  feeling hungry. The others drew together in a group and talked in undertones,
  glancing at him ever and again. He became uneasy. His appearance of disregard
  cost him an increasing effort. He tried to think of the levers of his new
  press.</p>

  <p>Presently one, a man shorter but much broader and stouter than Denton,
  came forward to him. Denton turned to him as unconcernedly as possible.
  "Here!" said the delegate&mdash;as Denton judged him to be&mdash;extending a
  cube of bread in a not too clean hand. He had a swart, broad-nosed face, and
  his mouth hung down towards one corner.</p>

  <p>Denton felt doubtful for the instant whether this was meant for civility
  or insult. His impulse was to decline. "No thanks," he said; and at the man's
  change of expression, "I'm not hungry."</p>

  <p>There came a laugh from the group behind. "Told you so," said the man who
  had offered Denton the loan of an oil can. "He's top side, he is. You ain't
  good enough for 'im."</p>

  <p>The swart face grew a shade darker.</p>

  <p>"Here," said its owner, still extending the bread, and speaking in a lower
  tone; "you got to eat this. See?"</p>

  <p>Denton looked into the threatening face before him, and odd little
  currents of energy seemed to be running through his limbs and body.</p>

  <p>"I don't want it," he said, trying a pleasant smile that twitched and
  failed.</p>

  <p>The thickset man advanced his face, and the bread became a physical threat
  in his hand. Denton's mind rushed together to the one problem of his
  antagonist's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Eat it," said the swart man.</p>

  <p>There came a pause, and then they both moved quickly. The cube of bread
  described a complicated path, a curve that would have ended in Denton's face;
  and then his fist hit the wrist of the hand that gripped it, and it flew
  upward, and out of the conflict&mdash;its part played.</p>

  <p>He stepped back quickly, fists clenched and arms tense. The hot, dark
  countenance receded, became an alert hostility, watching its chance. Denton
  for one instant felt confident, and strangely buoyant and serene. His heart
  beat quickly. He felt his body alive, and glowing to the tips.</p>

  <p>"Scrap, boys!" shouted some one, and then the dark figure had leapt
  forward, ducked back and sideways, and come in again. Denton struck out, and
  was hit. One of his eyes seemed to him to be demolished, and he felt a soft
  lip under his fist before he was hit again&mdash;this time under the chin. A
  huge fan of fiery needles shot open. He had a momentary persuasion that his
  head was knocked to pieces, and then something hit his head and back from
  behind, and the fight became an uninteresting, an impersonal thing.</p>

  <p>He was aware that time&mdash;seconds or minutes&mdash;had passed, abstract
  uneventful time. He was lying with his head in a heap of ashes, and something
  wet and warm ran swiftly into his neck. The first shock broke up into
  discrete sensations. All his head throbbed; his eye and chin throbbed
  exceedingly, and the taste of blood was in his mouth.</p>

  <p>"He's all right," said a voice. "He's opening his eyes."</p>

  <p>"Serve him&mdash;well right," said a second.</p>

  <p>His mates were standing about him. He made an effort and sat up. He put
  his hand to the back of his head, and his hair was wet and full of cinders. A
  laugh greeted the gesture. His eye was partially closed. He perceived what
  had happened. His momentary anticipation of a final victory had vanished.</p>

  <p>"Looks surprised," said some one.</p>

  <p>"'Ave any more?" said a wit; and then, imitating Denton's refined accent:
  "No, Thank you."</p>

  <p>Denton perceived the swart man with a blood-stained handkerchief before
  his face, and somewhat in the background.</p>

  <p>"Where's that bit of bread he's got to eat?" said a little ferret-faced
  creature; and sought with his foot in the ashes of the adjacent bin.</p>

  <p>Denton had a moment of internal debate. He knew the code of honour
  required a man to pursue a fight he has begun, to the bitter end; but this
  was his first taste of the bitterness. He was resolved to rise again, but he
  felt no passionate impulse. It occurred to him&mdash;and the thought was no
  very violent spur&mdash;that he was perhaps after all a coward. For a moment
  his will was heavy, a lump of lead.</p>

  <p>"'Ere it is," said the little ferret-faced man, and stooped to pick up a
  cindery cube. He looked at Denton, then at the others.</p>

  <p>Slowly, unwillingly, Denton stood up.</p>

  <p>A dirty-faced albino extended a hand to the ferret-faced man.</p>

  <p>"Gimme that toke," he said. He advanced threateningly, bread in hand, to
  Denton. "So you ain't 'ad your bellyful yet," he said. "Eh?"</p>

  <p>Now it was coming. "No, I haven't," said Denton, with a catching of the
  breath, and resolved to try this brute behind the ear before he himself got
  stunned again. He knew he would be stunned again. He was astonished how ill
  he had judged himself beforehand. A few ridiculous lunges, and down he would
  go again. He watched the albino's eyes. The albino was grinning confidently,
  like a man who plans an agreeable trick. A sudden perception of impending
  indignities stung Denton.</p>

  <p>"You leave 'im alone, Jim," said the swart man suddenly over the blood-
  stained rag. "He ain't done nothing to you."</p>

  <p>The albino's grin vanished. He stopped. He looked from one to the other.
  It seemed to Denton that the swart man demanded the privilege of his
  destruction. The albino would have been better.</p>

  <p>"You leave 'im alone," said the swart man. "See? 'E's 'ad 'is licks."</p>

  <p>A clattering bell lifted up its voice and solved the situation. The albino
  hesitated. "Lucky for you," he said, adding a foul metaphor, and turned with
  the others towards the press-room again. "Wait for the end of the spell,
  mate," said the albino over his shoulder&mdash;an afterthought. The swart man
  waited for the albino to precede him. Denton realised that he had a
  reprieve.</p>

  <p>The men passed towards an open door, Denton became aware of his duties,
  and hurried to join the tail of the queue. At the doorway of the vaulted
  gallery of presses a yellow-uniformed labour policeman stood ticking a card.
  He had ignored the swart man's haemorrhage.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up there!" he said to Denton.</p>

  <p>"Hello!" he said, at the sight of his facial disarry. "Who's been hitting
  you?"</p>

  <p>"That's my affair," said Denton.</p>

  <p>"Not if it spiles your work, it ain't," said the man in yellow. "You mind
  that."</p>

  <p>Denton made no answer. He was a rough&mdash;a labourer. He wore the blue
  canvas. The laws of assault and battery, he knew, were not for the likes of
  him. He went to his press.</p>

  <p>He could feel the skin of his brow and chin and head lifting themselves to
  noble bruises, felt the throb and pain of each aspiring contusion. His
  nervous system slid down to lethargy; at each movement in his press
  adjustment he felt he lifted a weight. And as for his honour&mdash;that too
  throbbed and puffed. How did he stand? What precisely had happened in the
  last ten minutes? What would happen next? He knew that there was enormous
  matter for thought, he could not think save, in disordered snatches.</p>

  <p>His mood was a sort of stagnant astonishment. All his conceptions were
  overthrown. He had regarded his security from physical violence as inherent,
  as one of the conditions of life. So indeed, it had been while he wore his
  middle-class costume, had his middle-class property to serve for his defence.
  But who would interfere among Labour roughs fighting together? And indeed in
  those days no man would. In Underworld there was no law between man and man;
  the law and machinery of the state had become for them something that held
  men down, fended them off from much desirable property and pleasure, and that
  was all. Violence, that ocean in which the brutes live for ever, and from
  which a thousand dykes and contrivances have won our hazardous civilised
  life, had flowed in again upon the sinking underways and submerged them. The
  fist ruled. Denton had come right down at last to the elemental&mdash;fist
  and trick and the stubborn heart and fellowship&mdash;even as it was in the
  beginning.</p>

  <p>The rhythm of his machine changed, and his thoughts were interrupted.</p>

  <p>Presently he could think again. Strange how quickly things had happened!
  He bore these men who had thrashed him no very vivid ill-will. He was bruised
  and enlightened. He saw with absolute fairness, now the reasonableness of his
  unpopularity. He had behaved like a fool. Disdain, seclusion, are the
  privilege of the strong. The fallen aristocrat still clinging to his
  pointless distinction is surely the most pitiful creature of pretence in all
  this clamant universe. Good heavens! What was there for him to despise in
  these men?</p>

  <p>What a pity he had not appreciated all this better five hours ago!</p>

  <p>What would happen at the end of the spell? He could not tell. He could not
  imagine. He could not imagine the thoughts of these men. He was sensible only
  of their hostility and utter want of sympathy. Vague possibilities of shame
  and violence chased one another, across his mind. Could he devise some
  weapon? He recalled his assault upon the hypnotist, but there were no
  detachable lamps here. He could see nothing that he could catch up in his
  defence.</p>

  <p>For a space he thought of a headlong bolt for the security of the public
  ways directly when the spell was over. Apart from the trivial consideration
  of his self-respect, he perceived that this would be only a foolish
  postponement and aggravation of his trouble. He perceived the ferret-faced
  man and the albino talking together with their eyes towards him. Presently
  they were talking to the swart man, who stood with his broad back studiously
  towards Denton.</p>

  <p>At last the end of the second spell. The lender of oil cans stopped his
  press sharply and turned round, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
  His eyes had the quite expectation of one who seats himself in a theatre.</p>

  <p>Now was the crisis, and all the little nerves of Denton's being seemed
  leaping and dancing. He had decided to show fight if any fresh indignity was
  offered him. He stopped his press and turned. With an enormous affectation of
  ease he walked down the vault and entered the passage of the ash pits, only
  to discover he had left his jacket&mdash;which he had taken off because of
  the heat of the vault&mdash;beside his press. He walked back. He met the
  albino eye to eye.</p>

  <p>He heard the ferret-faced man in expostulation. "'E reely ought, eat it,"
  said the ferret-faced man. "'E did reely."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;you leave 'im alone," said the swart man.</p>

  <p>Apparently nothing further was to happen to him that day. He passed out to
  the passage and staircase that led up to the moving platforms of the
  city.</p>

  <p>He emerged on the livid brilliance and streaming movement of the public
  street. He became acutely aware of his disfigured face, and felt his swelling
  bruises with a limp, investigatory hand. He went up to the swiftest platform,
  and seated himself on a Labour Company bench.</p>

  <p>He lapsed into a pensive torpor. The immediate dangers and stresses of his
  position he saw with a sort of static clearness. What would they do to-
  morrow? He could not tell. What would Elizabeth think of his brutalisation?
  He could not tell. He was exhausted. He was aroused presently by a hand upon
  his arm.</p>

  <p>He looked up, and saw the swart man seated beside him. He started. Surely
  he was safe from violence in the public way!</p>

  <p>The swart man's face retained no traces of his share in the fight; his
  expression was free from hostility&mdash;seemed almost deferential. "'Scuse
  me," he said, with a total absence of truculence. Denton realised that no
  assault was intended. He stared, awaiting the next development.</p>

  <p>It was evident the next sentence was premeditated. "Whad&mdash;I
  &mdash;was&mdash;going&mdash;to say&mdash;was this," said the swart man, and
  sought through a silence for further words.</p>

  <p>"Whad&mdash;I&mdash;was&mdash;going&mdash;to say&mdash;was this," he
  repeated.</p>

  <p>Finally he abandoned that gambit. "You're aw right," he cried, laying a
  grimy hand on Denton's grimy sleeve. "You're aw right. You're a ge'man. Sorry
  &mdash;very sorry. Wanted to tell you that."</p>

  <p>Denton realised that there must exist motives beyond a mere impulse to
  abominable proceedings in the man. He meditated, and swallowed an unworthy
  pride.</p>

  <p>"I did not mean to be offensive to you," he said, "in refusing that bit of
  bread."</p>

  <p>"Meant it friendly," said the swart man, recalling the scene; "but
  &mdash;in front of that blarsted Whitey and his snigger&mdash;well&mdash;I
  'ad to scrap."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Denton with sudden fervour: "I was a fool."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said the swart man, with great satisfaction. "That's aw right.
  Shake!"</p>

  <p>And Denton shook.</p>

  <p>The moving platform was rushing by the establishment of a face moulder,
  and its lower front was a huge display of mirror, designed to stimulate the
  thirst for more symmetrical features. Denton caught the reflection of himself
  and his new friend, enormously twisted and broadened. His own face was
  puffed, one-sided, and blood-stained; a grin of idiotic and insincere
  amiability distorted its latitude. A wisp of hair occluded one eye. The trick
  of the mirror presented the swart man as a gross expansion of lip and
  nostril. They were linked by shaking hands. Then abruptly this vision
  passed&mdash;to return to memory in the anaemic meditations of a waking
  dawn.</p>

  <p>As he shook, the swart man made some muddled remark, to the effect that he
  had always known he could get on with a gentleman if one came his way. He
  prolonged the shaking until Denton, under the influence of the mirror,
  withdrew his hand. The swart man became pensive, spat impressively on the
  platform, and resumed his theme.</p>

  <p>"Whad I was going to say was this," he said; he gravelled, and shook his
  head at his foot.</p>

  <p>Denton became curious. "Go on," he said, attentive.</p>

  <p>The swart man took the plunge. He grasped Denton's arm, became intimate in
  his attitude. "'Scuse me," he said. "Fact is, you done know 'ow to scrap.
  Done know 'ow to. Why&mdash;you done know 'ow to begin. You'll get killed if
  you don't mind. Ouldin' your 'ands&mdash;There!"</p>

  <p>He reinforced his statement by objurgation, watching the effect of each
  oath with a wary eye.</p>

  <p>"F'r instance. You're tall. Long arms. You got a longer reach than any one
  in the brasted vault. Gobblimey, but I thought I'd got a Tough on. 'Stead of
  which... 'Scuse me. I wouldn't have 'it you if I'd known. It's like fighting
  sacks. 'Tisn' right. Y'r arms seemed 'ung on 'ooks. Reg'lar&mdash;'ung on
  'ooks. There!"</p>

  <p>Denton stared, and then surprised and hurt his battered chin by a sudden
  laugh. Bitter tears came into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said.</p>

  <p>The swart man reverted to his formula. He was good enough to say he liked
  the look of Denton, thought he had stood up "amazing plucky. On'y pluck ain't
  no good&mdash;ain't no brasted good&mdash;if you don't 'old your 'ands.</p>

  <p>"Whad I was going to say was this," he said. "Lemme show you 'ow to scrap.
  Just lemme. You're ig'nant, you ain't no class; but you might be a very
  decent scrapper&mdash;very decent. Shown. That's what I meant to say."</p>

  <p>Denton hesitated. "But&mdash;" he said, "I can't give you
  anything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's the ge'man all over," said the swart man. "Who arst you to?"</p>

  <p>"But your time?"</p>

  <p>"If you don't get learnt scrapping you'll get killed&mdash;, don't you
  make no bones of that."</p>

  <p>Denton thought. "I don't know," he said.</p>

  <p>He looked at the face beside him, and all its native coarseness shouted at
  him. He felt a quick revulsion from his transient friendliness. It seemed to
  him incredible that it should be necessary for him to be indebted to such a
  creature.</p>

  <p>"The chaps are always scrapping," said the swart man. "Always. And of
  course&mdash;if one gets waxy and 'its you vital..."</p>

  <p>"By God!" cried Denton; "I wish one would."</p>

  <p>"Of course, if you feel like that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't understand."</p>

  <p>"P'raps I don't," said the swart man; and lapsed into a fuming
  silence.</p>

  <p>When he spoke again his voice was less friendly, and he prodded Denton by
  way of address. "Look see!" he said: "Are you going to let me show you 'ow to
  scrap?"</p>

  <p>"It's tremendously kind of you," said Denton; "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a pause. The swart man rose and bent over Denton.</p>

  <p>"Too much ge'man," he said&mdash;"eh? I got a red face... By gosh! You are
  a brasted fool!" He turned away, and instantly Denton realised the truth of
  this remark.</p>

  <p>The swart man descended with dignity to a cross way, and Denton, after a
  momentary impulse to pursuit, remained on the platform. For a time the things
  that had happened filled his mind. In one day his graceful system of
  resignation had been shattered beyond hope. Brute force, the final, the
  fundamental, had thrust its face through all his explanations and glosses and
  consolations and grinned enigmatically. Though he was hungry and tired, he
  did not go on directly to the Labour Hotel, where he would meet Elizabeth. He
  found he was beginning to think, he wanted very greatly to think; and so,
  wrapped in a monstrous cloud of meditation, he went the circuit of the city
  on his moving platform twice. You figure him, tearing through the glaring,
  thunder-voiced city at a pace of fifty miles an hour, the city upon the
  planet that spins along its chartless path through space many thousands of
  miles an hour, funking most terribly, and trying to understand why the heart
  and will in him should suffer and keep alive.</p>

  <p>When at last he came to Elizabeth, she was white and anxious. He might
  have noted she was in trouble, had it not been for his own preoccupation. He
  feared most that she would desire to know every detail of his indignities,
  that she would be sympathetic or indignant. He saw her eyebrows rise at the
  sight of him.</p>

  <p>"I've had rough handling," he said, and gasped. "It's too fresh&mdash;too
  hot. I don't want to talk about it." He sat down with an unavoidable air of
  sullenness.</p>

  <p>She stared at him in astonishment, and as she read something of
  significant hieroglyphic of his battered face, her lips whitened. Her hand
  &mdash;it was thinner now, than in the days of their prosperity, and her
  first finger was a little altered by the metal punching she
  did&mdash;clenched convulsively. "This horrible world!" she said, and said no
  more.</p>

  <p>In these latter days they had become a very silent couple; they said
  scarcely a word to each other that night, but each followed a private train
  of thought. In the small hours, as Elizabeth lay awake, Denton started up
  beside her suddenly&mdash;he had been lying as still as a dead man.</p>

  <p>"I cannot stand it!" cried Denton. "I will not stand it!"</p>

  <p>She saw him dimly, sitting up; saw his arm lunge as if in a furious blow
  at the enshrouding night. Then for a space he was still. "It is too much
  &mdash;it is more than one can bear!"</p>

  <p>She could say nothing. To her also, it seemed that this was as far as one
  could go. She waited through a long stillness. She could see that Denton sat
  with his arms about his knees, his chin almost touching them.</p>

  <p>Then he laughed.</p>

  <p>"No," he said at last, "I'm going to stand it. That's the peculiar thing.
  There isn't a grain of suicide in us&mdash;not a grain. I suppose all people
  with a turn that way have gone. We're going through with it&mdash;to the
  end."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth thought grayly, and realised that this also was true.</p>

  <p>"We're going through with it. To think of all who have gone through with
  it: all the generations&mdash;endless&mdash;endless. Little beasts that
  snapped and snarled, snapping and snarling, snapping and snarling, generation
  after generation."</p>

  <p>His monotone, ended abruptly, resumed after a vast interval.</p>

  <p>"There were ninety thousand years of stone age. A Denton somewhere in all
  those years. Apostolic succession. The grace of going through. Let me see!
  Ninety&mdash;nine hundred&mdash;three nines, twenty-seven&mdash;three
  thousand generations of men&mdash;! Men more or less. And each fought, and
  was bruised, and shamed, and somehow held his own&mdash;going through with it
  &mdash;passing it on... And thousands more to come perhaps&mdash;thousands!
  Passing it on. I wonder if they will thank us."</p>

  <p>His voice assumed an argumentative note. "If one could find something
  definite... If one could say, 'This is why&mdash;this is why it goes
  on...'"</p>

  <p>He became still, and Elizabeth's eyes slowly separated him from the
  darkness until at last she could see how he sat with his head resting on his
  hand. A sense of the enormous remoteness of their minds came to her; that dim
  suggestion of another being seemed to her a figure of their mutual
  understanding. What could he be thinking now? What might he not say next?
  Another age seemed to elapse before he sighed and whispered: "No, I don't
  understand it. No!" Then a long interval, and he repeated this. But the
  second time it had the tone almost of a solution.</p>

  <p>She became aware that he was preparing to lie down. She marked his
  movements, perceived with astonishment how he adjusted his pillow with a
  careful regard to comfort. He lay down with a sigh of contentment almost. His
  passion had passed. He lay still, and presently his breathing became regular
  and deep.</p>

  <p>But Elizabeth remained with eyes wide open in the darkness, until the
  clamour of a bell and sudden brilliance of the electric light warned them
  that the Labour Company had need of them for yet another day.</p>

  <p>That day came a scuffle with the albino Whitey and the little ferret-
  faced man. Blunt, the swart artist in scrapping, having first let Denton
  grasp the bearing of his lesson, intervened, not without a certain quality of
  patronage. "Drop 'is 'air, Whitey, and let the man be," said his gross voice
  through a shower of indignities. "Can't you see 'e don't know 'ow to scrap?"
  And Denton, lying shamefully in the dust, realised that he must accept that
  course of instruction after all.</p>

  <p>He made his apology straight and clean. He scrambled up and walked to
  Blunt. "I was a fool, and you are right," he said. "If it isn't too
  late..."</p>

  <p>That night, after the second spell, Denton went with Blunt to certain
  waste and slime-soaked vaults under the Port of London, to learn the first
  beginnings of the high art of scrapping as it had been perfected in the great
  world of the underways: how to hit or kick a man so as to hurt him
  excruciatingly or make him violently sick, how to hit or kick "vital," how to
  use glass in one's garments as a club and to spread red ruin with various
  domestic implements, how to anticipate and demolish your adversary's
  intentions in other directions; all the pleasant devices, in fact, that had
  grown up among the disinherited of the great cities of the twentieth and
  twenty-first centuries, were spread out by a gifted exponent for Denton's
  learning. Blunt's bashfulness fell from him as the instruction proceeded, and
  he developed a certain expert dignity, a quality of fatherly consideration.
  He treated Denton with the utmost consideration, only "flicking him up a bit"
  now and then, to keep the interest hot, and roaring with laughter at a happy
  fluke of Denton's that covered his mouth with blood.</p>

  <p>"I'm always keerless of my mouth," said Blunt, admitting a weakness.
  "Always. It don't seem to matter, like just getting bashed in the
  mouth&mdash;not if your chin's all right. Tastin' blood does me good. Always.
  But I better not 'it you again."</p>

  <p>Denton went home, to fall asleep exhausted and wake in the small hours
  with aching limbs and all his bruises tingling. Was it worth while that he
  should go on living? He listened to Elizabeth's breathing, and remembering
  that he must have awaked her the previous night, he lay very still. He was
  sick with infinite disgust at the new conditions of his life. He hated it
  all, hated even the genial savage who had protected him so generously. The
  monstrous fraud of civilisation glared stark before his eyes: he saw it as a
  vast lunatic growth, producing a deepening torrent of savagery below, and
  above ever more flimsy gentility and silly wastefulness. He could see no
  redeeming reason, no touch of honour, either in the life he had led or in
  this life to which he had fallen. Civilisation presented itself as some
  catastrophic project as little concerned with men&mdash;save as
  victims&mdash;as a cyclone or a planetary collision. He and therefore all
  mankind, seemed living utterly in vain. His mind sought some strange
  expedients of escape, if not for himself then at least for Elizabeth. But he
  meant them for himself. What if he hunted up Mwres and told him of their
  disaster? It came to him as an astonishing thing how utterly Mwres and Bindon
  had passed out of his range. Where were they? What were they doing? From that
  he passed to thoughts of utter dishonour. And finally, not arising in any way
  out of this mental tumult, but ending it as dawn ends the night, came the
  clear and obvious conclusion of the night before: the conviction that he had
  to go through with things; that apart from any remoter view and quite
  sufficient for all his thought and energy, he had to stand up and fight among
  his fellows and quit himself like a man.</p>

  <p>The second night's instruction was perhaps less dreadful than the first;
  and the third was even endurable, for Blunt dealt out some praise. The fourth
  day Denton chanced upon the fact that the ferret-faced man was a coward.
  There passed a fortnight of smouldering days and feverish instruction at
  night; Blunt, with many blasphemies, testified that never had he met so apt a
  pupil; and all night long Denton dreamt of kicks and counters and gouges and
  cunning tricks. For all that time no further outrages were attempted, for
  fear of Blunt; and then came the second crisis. Blunt did not come one
  day&mdash;afterwards he admitted his deliberate intention&mdash;and through
  the tedious morning Whitey awaited the interval between the spells with an
  ostentatious impatience. He knew nothing of the scrapping lessons, and he
  spent the time in telling Denton and the vault generally of certain
  disagreeable proceedings he had in mind.</p>

  <p>Whitey was not popular, and the vault disgorged to see him haze the new
  man with only a languid interest. But matters changed when Whitey's attempt
  to open the proceedings by kicking Denton in the face was met by an
  excellently executed duck, catch and throw, and completed the flight of
  Whitey's foot in its orbit and brought Whitey's head into the ash-heap that
  had once received Denton's. Whitey arose a shade whiter, and now
  blasphemously bent upon vital injuries. There were indecisive passages,
  foiled enterprises that deepened Whitey's evidently growing perplexity; and
  then things developed into a grouping of Denton uppermost with Whitey's
  throat in his hand, his knee on Whitey's chest, and a tearful Whitey with a
  black face, protruding tongue and broken finger endeavouring to explain the
  misunderstanding by means of hoarse sounds. Moreover, it was evident that
  among the bystanders there had never been a more popular person than
  Denton.</p>

  <p>Denton, with proper precaution, released his antagonist and stood up. His
  blood seemed changed to some sort of fluid fire, his limbs felt light and
  supernaturally strong. The idea that he was a martyr in the civilisation
  machine had vanished from his mind. He was a man in a world of men.</p>

  <p>The little ferret-faced man was the first in the competition to pat him on
  the back. The lender of oil cans was a radiant sun of genial
  congratulation... It seemed incredible to Denton that he had ever thought of
  despair.</p>

  <p>Denton was convinced that not only had he to go through with things, but
  that he could. He sat on the canvas pallet expounding this new aspect to
  Elizabeth. One side of his face was bruised. She had not recently fought, she
  had not been patted on the back, there were not hot bruises upon her face,
  only a pallor and a new line or so about the mouth. She was taking the
  woman's share. She looked steadfastly at Denton in his new mood of prophecy.
  "I feel that there is something," he was saying, "something that goes on, a
  Being of Life in which we live and move and have our being, something that
  began fifty&mdash;a hundred million years ago, perhaps, that goes
  on&mdash;on: growing, spreading to things beyond us&mdash;things that will
  justify us all... That will explain and justify my fighting&mdash;these
  bruises, and all the pain of it. It's the chisel&mdash;yes, the chisel of the
  Maker. If only I could make you feel as I feel, if I could make you! You will
  dear, I know you will."</p>

  <p>"No," she said in a low voice. "No, I shall not."</p>

  <p>"So I might have thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "No," she said, "I have thought as well. What you say
  &mdash;doesn't convince me."</p>

  <p>She looked at his face resolutely. "I hate it," she said, and caught at
  her breath. "You do not understand, you do not think. There was a time when
  you said things and I believed them. I am growing wiser. You are a man, you
  can fight, force your way. You do not mind bruises. You can be coarse and
  ugly, and still a man. Yes&mdash;it makes you. It makes you. You are right.
  Only a woman is not like that. We are different. We let ourselves get
  civilised too soon. This underworld is not for us."</p>

  <p>She paused and began again.</p>

  <p>"I hate it! I hate this horrible canvas! I hate it more than&mdash;more
  than the worst that happened. It hurts my fingers to touch it. It is horrible
  to the skin. And the women I work with day after day! I lie awake at nights
  and think how I may be growing like them..."</p>

  <p>She stopped. "I am growing like them!" she cried passionately.</p>

  <p>Denton stared at her distress. "But&mdash;" he said and stopped.</p>

  <p>"You don't understand. What have I? What have I to save me? You can fight.
  Fighting is man's work. But women&mdash;women are different... I have thought
  it all out, I have done nothing but think night and day. Look at the colour
  of my face! I cannot go on. I cannot endure this life... I cannot endure
  it."</p>

  <p>She stopped. She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"You do not know all," she said abruptly, and for an instant her lips had
  a bitter smile. "I have been asked to leave you."</p>

  <p>"Leave me!"</p>

  <p>She made no answer save an affirmative movement of the head.</p>

  <p>Denton stood up sharply. They stared at one another through a long
  silence.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she turned herself about, and flung face downward upon their
  canvas bed. She did not sob, she made no sound. She lay still upon her face.
  After a vast, distressful void her shoulders heaved and she began to weep
  silently.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth!" he whispered&mdash;"Elizabeth!"</p>

  <p>Very softly he sat down beside her, bent down, put his arm across her in a
  doubtful caress, seeking vainly for some clue to this intolerable
  situation.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth," he whispered in her ear.</p>

  <p>She thrust him from her with her hand. "I cannot bear a child to be a
  slave!" and broke out into loud and bitter weeping.</p>

  <p>Denton's face changed&mdash;became blank dismay. Presently he slipped from
  the bed and stood on his feet. All the complacency had vanished from his
  face, had given place to impotent rage. He began to rave and curse at the
  intolerable forces which pressed upon him, at all the accidents and hot
  desires and heedlessness that mock the life of man. His little voice rose in
  that little room, and he shook his fist, this animalcule of the earth, at all
  that environed him about, at the millions about him, at this past and future
  and all the insensate vastness of the overwhelming city.</p>

     name="story47">A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME&mdash;<br>
  5. BINDON INTERVENES</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>, October 1897</h3>

  <p>In Bindon's younger days he had dabbled in speculation and made three
  brilliant flukes. For the rest of his life he had the wisdom to let gambling
  alone, and the conceit to believe himself a very clever man. A certain desire
  for influence and reputation, interested him in the business intrigues of the
  giant city in which his flukes were made. He became at last one of the most
  influential shareholders in the company that owned the London flying-stages
  to which the aeroplanes came from all parts of the world. This much for his
  public activities. In his private life he was a man of pleasure. And this is
  the story of his heart.</p>

  <p>But before proceeding to such depths, one must devote a little time to the
  exterior of this person. Its physical basis was slender, and short, and dark;
  and the face, which was fine-featured and assisted by pigments, varied from
  an insecure self-complacency to an intelligent uneasiness. His face and head
  had been depilated, according to the cleanly and hygienic fashion of the
  time, so that the colour and contour of his hair varied with his costume.
  This he was constantly changing.</p>

  <p>At times he would distend himself with pneumatic vestments in the rococo
  vein. From among the billowy developments of this style, and beneath a
  translucent and illuminated head-dress, his eyes watched jealously for the
  respect of the less fashionable world. At other times he emphasised his
  elegant slenderness in close-fitting garments of black satin. For effects of
  dignity he would assume broad pneumatic shoulders, from which hung a robe of
  carefully arranged folds of China silk, and a classical Bindon in pink tights
  was also a transient phenomenon in the eternal pageant of Destiny. In the
  days when he hoped to marry Elizabeth, he sought to impress and charm her,
  and at the same time to take off something of his burthen of forty years, by
  wearing the last fancy of the contemporary buck, a costume of elastic
  material with distensible warts and horns, changing in colour as he walked,
  by an ingenious arrangement of versatile chromatophores. And no doubt, if
  Elizabeth's affection had not been already engaged by the worthless Denton,
  and if her tastes had not had that odd bias for old-fashioned ways, this
  extremely chic conception would have ravished her. Bindon had consulted
  Elizabeth's father before presenting himself in this grab&mdash;he was one of
  those men who always invite criticism of their costume&mdash;and Mwres had
  pronounced him all that the heart of woman could desire. But the affair of
  the hypnotist proved that his knowledge of the heart of woman was
  incomplete.</p>

  <p>Bindon's idea of marrying had been formed some little time before Mwres
  threw Elizabeth's budding womanhood in his way. It was one of Bindon's most
  cherished secrets that he had a considerable capacity for a pure and simple
  life of a grossly sentimental type. The thought imparted a sort of pathetic
  seriousness to the offensive and quite inconsequent and unmeaning excesses,
  which he was pleased to regard as dashing wickedness, and which a number of
  good people also were so unwise as to treat in that desirable manner. As a
  consequence of these excesses, and perhaps by reason also of an inherited
  tendency to early decay, his liver became seriously affected, and he suffered
  increasing inconvenience, when travelling by aeroplane. It was during his
  convalescence from a protracted bilious attack that it occurred to him that
  in spite of all the terrible fascinations of Vice, if he found a beautiful,
  gentle, good young women of a not too violently intellectual type to devote
  her life to him, he might yet be saved to Goodness, and even rear a spirited
  family in his likeness to solace his declining years. But like so many
  experienced men of the world, he doubted if there were any good women. Of
  course as he had heard tell he was outwardly sceptical and privately much
  afraid.</p>

  <p>When the aspiring Mwres effected his introduction to Elizabeth, it seemed
  to him that his good fortune was complete. He fell in love with her at once.
  Of course, he had always been falling in love since he was sixteen, in
  accordance with the extremely varied recipes to be found in the accumulated
  literature of many centuries. But this was different. This was real love. It
  seemed to him to call forth all the lurking goodness in his nature. He felt
  that for her sake he could give up a way of life that had already produced
  the gravest lesions on his liver and nervous system. His imagination
  presented him with idyllic pictures of the life of the reformed rake. He
  would never be sentimental with her, or silly; but always a little cynical
  and bitter, as became the past. Yet he was sure she would have an intuition
  of his real greatness and goodness. And in due course he would confess things
  to her, pour his version of what he regarded as his wickedness&mdash;showing
  what a complex of Goethe, and Benvenuto Cellini, and Shelley, and all those
  other chaps he really was&mdash;into her shocked, very beautiful, and no
  doubt sympathetic ear. And preparatory to these things he wooed her with
  infinite subtlety and respect. And the reserve with which Elizabeth treated
  him seemed nothing more nor less than an exquisite modesty touched and
  enhanced by an equally exquisite lack of ideas.</p>

  <p>Bindon knew nothing of her wandering affections, nor of the attempt made
  by Mwres to utilise hypnotism as a corrective to this digression of her
  heart; he conceived he was on the best of terms with Elizabeth, and had made
  her quite successfully various significant presents of jewellery and the more
  virtuous cosmetics, when her elopement with Denton threw the world out of
  gear for him. His first aspect of the matter was rage begotten of wounded
  vanity, and as Mwres was the most convenient person, he vented the first
  brunt of it upon him.</p>

  <p>He went immediately, and insulted the desolate father grossly, and then
  spent an active and determined day going to and fro about the city and
  interviewing people in a consistent and partly-successful attempt to ruin
  that matrimonial speculator. The effectual nature of these activities gave
  him a temporary exhilaration, and he went to the dining-place he had
  frequented in his wicked days in a devil-may-care frame of mind, and dined
  altogether too amply and cheerfully with two other golden youths in the early
  forties. He threw up the game; no woman was worth being good for, and he
  astonished himself by the strain of witty cynicism he developed. One of the
  other desperate blades, warmed with wine, made a facetious allusion to his
  disappointment, but at the time this did not seem unpleasant.</p>

  <p>The next morning found his liver and temper inflamed. He kicked his
  phonographic-news machine to pieces, dismissed his valet, and resolved that
  he would perpetrate a terrible revenge upon Elizabeth. Or Denton. Or
  somebody. But anyhow, it was to be a terrible revenge; and the friend who had
  made fun at him should no longer see him in the light of a foolish girl's
  victim. He knew something of the little property that was due to her, and
  that this would be the only support of the young couple until Mwres should
  relent. If Mwres did not relent, and if unpropitious things should happen to
  the affair in which Elizabeth's expectations lay, they would come upon evil
  times and be sufficiently amenable to temptation of a sinister sort. Bindon's
  imagination, abandoning its beautiful idealism altogether, expanded the idea
  of temptation of a sinister sort. He figured himself as the implacable, the
  intricate and powerful man of wealth pursuing this maiden who had scorned
  him. And suddenly her image came upon his mind vivid and dominant, and for
  the first time in his life Bindon realised something of the real power of
  passion.</p>

  <p>His imagination stood aside like a respectful footman who has done his
  work in ushering in the emotion.</p>

  <p>"My God!" cried Bindon: "I will have her! If I have to kill myself to get
  her! And that other fellow&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>After an interview with his medical man and a penance for his overnight
  excesses in the form of bitter drugs, a mitigated absolutely resolute Bindon
  sought out Mwres. Mwres he found properly smashed, and impoverished and
  humble, in a mood of frantic self-preservation, ready to sell himself body
  and soul, much more any interest in a disobedient daughter, to recover his
  lost position in the world. In the reasonable discussion that followed, it
  was agreed that these misguided young people should be left to sink into
  distress, or possibly even assisted towards that improving discipline by
  Bindon's financial influence.</p>

  <p>"And then?" said Mwres.</p>

  <p>"They will come to the Labour Company," said Bindon. "They will wear the
  blue canvas."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"She will divorce him," he said, and sat for a moment intent upon that
  prospect. For in those days the austere limitations of divorce of Victorian
  times were extraordinarily relaxed, and a couple might separate on a hundred
  different scores.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly Bindon astonished himself and Mwres by jumping to his feet.
  "She shall divorce him!" he cried. "I will have it so&mdash;I will work it
  so. By God! It shall be so. He shall be disgraced, so that she must. He shall
  be smashed and pulverised."</p>

  <p>The idea of smashing and pulverising inflamed him further. He began a
  Jovian pacing up and down the little office. "I will have her," he cried. "I
  will have her! Heaven and Hell shall not save her from me!" His passion
  evaporated in its expression, and left him at the end simply histrionic. He
  struck an attitude and ignored with heroic determination a sharp twinge of
  pain about the diaphragm. And Mwres sat with his pneumatic cap deflated and
  himself very visibly impressed.</p>

  <p>And so, with a fair persistence, Bindon set himself to the work of being
  Elizabeth's malignant providence, using with ingenious dexterity every
  particle of advantage wealth in those days gave a man over his
  fellow-creatures. A resort to the consolations of religion hindered these
  operations not at all. He would go talk with an interesting, experienced and
  sympathetic Father of the Huysmanite sect of the Isis cult, about all the
  irrational little proceedings he was pleased to regard as his
  Heaven-dismaying wickedness, and the interesting, experienced and sympathetic
  Father representing Heaven dismayed, would with a pleasing affectation of
  horror, suggest simple and easy penances, and recommended a monastic
  foundation that was airy, cool, hygienic, and not vulgarised, for viscerally
  disordered penitent sinners of the refined and wealthy type. And after these
  excursions, Bindon would come back to London quite active and passionate
  again. He would machinate with really considerable energy, and repair to a
  certain gallery high above the street of moving ways, from which he could
  view the entrance to the barrack of the Labour Company in the ward which
  sheltered Denton and Elizabeth. And at last one day he saw Elizabeth go in,
  and thereby his passion was renewed.</p>

  <p>So in the fullness of time the complicated devices of Bindon ripened, and
  he could go to Mwres and tell him that the young people were near
  despair.</p>

  <p>"It's time for you," he said, "to let your parental affections have play.
  She's been in blue canvas some months, and they've been cooped together in
  one of those Labour dens, and the little girl is dead. She knows now what his
  manhood is worth to her, by way of protection, poor girl. She'll see things
  now in a clearer light. You go to her&mdash;I don't want to appear in this
  affair yet&mdash;and point out to her how necessary it is she should get a
  divorce from him..."</p>

  <p>"She's obstinate," said Mwres doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Spirit!" said Bindon. She's a wonderful girl&mdash;a wonderful girl!"</p>

  <p>"She'll refuse."</p>

  <p>"Of course she will. But leave it open to her. Leave it open to her. And
  some day&mdash;in that stuffy den, in that irksome, toilsome life they can't
  help it&mdash;they'll have a quarrel. And then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mwres meditated over the matter, and did as he was told.</p>

  <p>Then Bindon, as he had arranged with his spiritual adviser, went into
  retreat. The retreat of the Huysmanite sect was a beautiful place, with the
  sweetest air in London, lit by natural sunlight, and with restful quadrangles
  of real grass open to the sky, where at the same times the penitent man of
  pleasure might enjoy all the pleasures of loafing and all the satisfaction of
  distinguished austerity. And save for participation in simple and wholesome
  dietary of the place and in certain magnificent chants, Bindon spent all his
  time in meditation upon the theme of Elizabeth, and the extreme purification
  his soul had undergone since he first saw her, and whether he would be able
  to get a dispensation to marry her from the experienced and sympathetic
  Father in spite of the approaching "sin" of her divorce; and then... Bindon
  would lean against a pillar of the quadrangle and lapse into reveries on the
  superiority of virtuous love to any other of indulgence. A curious feeling in
  his back and chest that was trying to attract his attention, a disposition to
  be hot or shiver, a general sense of ill-health and cutaneous discomfort he
  did his best to ignore. All that of course belonged to the old life that he
  was shaking off.</p>

  <p>When he came out of retreat he went at once to Mwres to ask for news of
  Elizabeth. Mwres was clearly under the impression that he was an exemplary
  father, profoundly touched about the heart by his child's unhappiness. "She
  was pale," he said greatly moved; "She was pale. When I asked her to come
  away and leave him&mdash;and be happy&mdash;she put her head down upon the
  table&mdash;" Mwres sniffed&mdash;"and cried."</p>

  <p>His agitation was so great that he could say no more.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Bindon, respecting this manly grief. "Oh!" said Bindon quite
  suddenly, with his hand to his side.</p>

  <p>Mwres looked up sharply out of the pit of his sorrows, startled. "What's
  the matter?" he asked, visibly concerned.</p>

  <p>"A most violent pain. Excuse me! You were telling me about Elizabeth."</p>

  <p>And Mwres, after a decent solicitude for Bindon's pain, proceeded with his
  report. It was even unexpectedly hopeful. Elizabeth, in her first emotion at
  discovering her father had not absolutely deserted her, had been frank with
  him about her sorrows and disgusts.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Bindon, magnificently, "I shall have her yet." And yet then
  that novel pain twitched him for the second time.</p>

  <p>For these lower pains the priest was comparatively ineffectual, inclining
  rather to regard the body and them as mental illusions amenable to
  contemplation; so Bindon took it to a man of class he loathed, a medical man
  of extraordinary repute and incivility. "We must go all over you," said the
  medical man, and did so with the most disgusting frankness. "Did you ever
  bring any children into the world?" asked this gross materialist among other
  impertinent questions.</p>

  <p>"Not that I know of," said Bindon, too amazed to stand upon his
  dignity.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the medical man, and proceeded with his punching and sounding.
  Medical science in those days was just reaching the beginning of precision.
  "You'd better go right away," said the medical man, "and make the Euthanasia.
  The sooner the better."</p>

  <p>Bindon gasped. He had been trying not to understand the technical
  explanations and anticipations in which the medical man had indulged.</p>

  <p>"I say!" he said. "But do you mean to say... Your science..."</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said the medical man. "A few opiates. The thing is your own
  doing, you know, to a certain extent."</p>

  <p>"I was sorely tempted in my youth."</p>

  <p>"It's not that so much. But you come of a bad stock. Even if you'd have
  taken precautions you'd have had bad times to wind up with. The mistake was
  getting born. The indiscretions of the parents. And you've shirked exercise,
  and so forth."</p>

  <p>"I had no one to advise me."</p>

  <p>"Medical men are always willing."</p>

  <p>"I was a spirited young fellow."</p>

  <p>"We won't argue; the mischief's done now. You've lived. We can't start you
  again. You ought never to have started at all. Frankly&mdash;the
  Euthanasia!"</p>

  <p>Bindon hated him in silence for a space. Every word of this brutal expert
  jarred upon his refinements. He was so gross, so impermeable to all the
  subtler issues of being. But it is no good picking a quarrel with a doctor.
  "My religious beliefs," he said. "I don't approve of suicide."</p>

  <p>"You've been doing it all your life."</p>

  <p>"Well, anyway I've come to take a serious view of life now."</p>

  <p>"You're bound to, if you go on living. You'll hurt. But for practical
  purposes it's late. However, if you mean to do that&mdash;perhaps I'd better
  mix you a little something. You'll hurt a great deal. These little
  twinges..."</p>

  <p>"Twinges!"</p>

  <p>"Mere preliminary notices."</p>

  <p>"How long can I go on? I mean, before I hurt&mdash;really."</p>

  <p>"You'll get it hot soon. Perhaps three days."</p>

  <p>Bindon tried to argue for an extension of time, and in the midst of his
  pleading gasped, put his hand to his side. Suddenly the extraordinary pathos
  of his life came to him clear and vivid. "It's hard," he said. "It's
  infernally hard! I've been no man's enemy but my own. I've always treated
  everybody quite fairly."</p>

  <p>The medical man stared at him without any sympathy for some seconds. He
  was reflecting how excellent it was that there were no more Bindons to carry
  on that line of pathos. He felt quite optimistic. Then he turned to his
  telephone and ordered up a prescription from the Central Pharmacy.</p>

  <p>He was interrupted by a voice behind him. "By God!" cried Bindon; "I'll
  have her yet."</p>

  <p>The physician stared over his shoulder at Bindon's expression, and then
  altered the prescription.</p>

  <p>So soon as this painful interview was over, Bindon gave way to rage. He
  settled that the medical man was not only an unsympathetic brute and wanting
  in the first beginnings of a gentleman, but also highly incompetent; and he
  went off to four other practitioners in succession, with a view to the
  establishment of this intuition. But to guard against surprises he kept that
  little prescription in his pocket. With each he began by expressing his grave
  doubts of the first doctor's intelligence, honesty and professional
  knowledge, and then stated his symptoms, suppressing only a few more material
  facts in each case. These were always subsequently elicited by the doctor. In
  spite of the welcome depreciation of another practitioner, none of these
  eminent specialists would give Bindon any hope of eluding the anguish and
  helplessness that loomed now close upon him. To the last of them he
  unburthened his mind of an accumulated disgust with medical science. "After
  centuries and centuries," he exclaimed hotly; "and you can do
  nothing&mdash;except admit your helplessness. I say, 'save me&mdash;' and
  what do you do?"</p>

  <p>"No doubt it's hard on you," said the doctor. "But you should have taken
  precautions."</p>

  <p>"How was I to know?"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't our place to run after you," said the medical man, picking a
  thread of cotton from his purple sleeve. "Why should we save you in
  particular? You see&mdash;from one point of view&mdash;people with
  imagination and passion like yours have to go&mdash;they have to go."</p>

  <p>"Go?"</p>

  <p>"Die out. It's an eddy."</p>

  <p>He was a young man with a serene face. He smiled at Bindon. "We get on
  with research, you know; we give advice when people have the sense to ask for
  it. And we bide our time."</p>

  <p>Bide your time?"</p>

  <p>"We hardly know enough yet to take over the management, you know."</p>

  <p>"The management?"</p>

  <p>"You needn't be anxious. Science is young yet. It's got to keep on growing
  for a few generations. We know enough now to know we don't know enough yet...
  But the time is coming, all the same. You won't see the time. But, between
  ourselves, you rich men and party bosses, with your natural play of passions
  and patriotism and religion and so forth, have made rather a mess of things;
  haven't you? These underways! And all sort of thing. Some of us have sort of
  fancy that in time we may know enough to take over a little more than the
  ventilation and drains. Knowledge keeps on piling up, you know. It keeps on
  growing. And there's not the slightest hurry for a generation or so. Some day
  &mdash;some day, men will live in a different way." He looked at Bindon and
  meditated. "There'll be a lot of dying out before that day can come."</p>

  <p>Bindon attempted to point out to this young man how silly and irrelevant
  such talk was to a sick man like himself, how impertinent and uncivil it was
  to him, an older man occupying a position in the official world of
  extraordinary power and influence. He insisted that a doctor was paid to cure
  people&mdash;he laid great stress on "paid&mdash;" and had no business to
  glance even for a moment at "those other questions." "But we do," said the
  young man, insisting upon facts, and Bindon lost his temper.</p>

  <p>His indignation carried him home. That these incompetent impostors, who
  were unable to save the life of a really influential man like himself, should
  dream of some day robbing the legitimate property owners of social control,
  of inflicting one knew not, what tyranny upon the world. Curse science! He
  fumed over the intolerable prospect for some time, and then the pain
  returned, and he recalled the made-up prescription of the first doctor, still
  happily in his pocket. He took a dose forthwith.</p>

  <p>It calmed and soothed him greatly, and he could sit down in his most
  comfortable chair beside his library (of phonographic records), and think
  over the altered aspect of affairs. His indignation passed, his anger and his
  passion crumbled under the subtle attack of that prescription, pathos became
  his sole ruler. He stared about him, at his magnificent and voluptuously
  appointed apartment, at his statuary and discreetly veiled pictures, and all
  the evidences of a cultivated and elegant wickedness; he touched a stud and
  the sad piping of Tristan's shepherd filled the air. His eye wandered from
  one object to another. They were costly and gross and florid&mdash;but they
  were his. They presented in concrete form his ideals, his conceptions of
  beauty and desire, his idea of all that is precious in life. And now&mdash;he
  must leave it all like a common man. He was, he felt, a slender and delicate
  flame, burning out. So must all life flame up and pass, he thought. His eyes
  filled with tears.</p>

  <p>Then it came into his head that he was alone. Nobody cared for him, nobody
  needed him! At any moment he might begin to hurt vividly. He might even howl.
  Nobody would mind. According to all the doctors he would have excellent
  reason for howling in a day or so. It recalled what his spiritual adviser had
  said of the decline of faith and fidelity, the degeneration of the age. He
  beheld himself as a pathetic proof of this; he, the subtle, able important,
  voluptuous, cynical, complex Bindon, possibly howling, and not one faithful
  simple creature in all the world to howl in sympathy. Not one faithful simple
  soul was there&mdash;no shepherd to pipe to him! Had all such faithful simple
  creatures vanished from this harsh and urgent earth? He wondered whether the
  horrid vulgar crowd that perpetually went about the city could possibly know
  what he thought of them. If they did he felt sure some would try to earn a
  better opinion. Surely the world went from bad to worse. It was becoming
  impossible for Bindons. Perhaps some day... He was quite sure that the one
  thing he had needed in life was sympathy. For a time he regretted that he
  left no sonnets&mdash;no enigmatical pictures or something of that sort
  behind him to carry on his being until at last the sympathetic mind should
  come...</p>

  <p>It seemed incredible to him that, this that came was extinction. Yet his
  sympathetic spiritual guide was in this matter annoyingly figurative and
  vague. Curse science! It had undermined all faith&mdash;all hope. To go out,
  to vanish from theatre and street, from office and dining-place, from the
  dear eyes of womankind. And not to be missed! On the whole to leave the world
  happier!</p>

  <p>He reflected that he had never worn his heart upon his sleeve. Had he
  after all been too unsympathetic? Few people could suspect how subtly
  profound he really was beneath the mask of that cynical gaiety of his. They
  would not understand the loss they had suffered. Elizabeth, for example, had
  not suspected...</p>

  <p>He had reserved that. His thoughts having come to Elizabeth gravitated
  about her for some time. How little Elizabeth understood him!</p>

  <p>That thought became intolerable. Before all other things he must set that
  right. He realised that there was still something for him to do in life, his
  struggle against Elizabeth was even yet not over. He could never overcome her
  now, as he had hoped and prayed. But he might still impress her!</p>

  <p>From that idea he expanded. He might impress her profoundly&mdash;he might
  impress her so that she should for evermore regret her treatment of him. The
  thing that she must realise before everything else was his magnanimity. His
  magnanimity! Yes! He had loved her with amazing greatness of heart. He had
  not seen it so clearly before&mdash;but of course he was going to leave her
  all his property. He saw it instantly, as a thing determined and inevitable.
  She would think how good he was, how spaciously generous; surrounded by all
  that makes life tolerable from his hand, she would recall with infinite
  regret her scorn and coldness. And when she sought expression for that
  regret, she would find that occasion gone forever, she should be met by a
  locked door, by a disdainful stillness, by a white dead face. He closed his
  eyes and remained for a space imagining himself that white dead face.</p>

  <p>From that he passed to the other aspect of the matter, but his
  determination was assured. He meditated elaborately before he took action,
  for the drug he had taken inclined him to a lethargic and dignified
  melancholy. In certain respects he modified details. If he left all his
  property to Elizabeth it would include the voluptuously appointed room he
  occupied, and for many reasons he did not care to leave that to her. On the
  other hand, it had to be left to some one. In his clogged condition this
  worried him extremely.</p>

  <p>In the end he decided to leave it to the sympathetic exponent of the
  fashionable religious cult whose conversation had been so pleasing in the
  past. "He will understand," said Bindon with a sentimental sigh. "He knows
  what Evil means&mdash;he understands something of the Stupendous Fascination
  of the Sphinx of Sin. Yes&mdash;he will understand." By that phrase it was
  that Bindon was pleased to dignify certain unhealthy and undignified
  departures from sane conduct to which a misguided vanity and an
  ill-controlled curiosity had led him. He sat for a space thinking how very
  Hellenic and Italian and Neronic, and all those things, he had been. Even
  now&mdash;might one not try a sonnet? A penetrating voice to echo down the
  ages; sensuous, sinister, and sad. For a space he forgot Elizabeth. In the
  course of half an hour he spoilt three phonographic coils, got a headache,
  took a second dose to calm himself, and reverted to magnanimity and his
  former design.</p>

  <p>At last he faced the unpalatable problem of Denton. It needed all his
  newborn magnanimity before he could swallow the thought of Denton; but at
  last this greatly misunderstood man, assisted by his sedative and the near
  approach of death, effected even that. If he was at all exclusive about
  Denton, if he should display the slightest distrust, if he attempted any
  specific exclusion of that young man, she might&mdash;misunderstand.
  Yes&mdash;she should have her Denton still. His magnanimity must go even to
  that. He tried to think only of Elizabeth in the matter.</p>

  <p>He rose with a sigh, and limped across to the telephonic apparatus that
  communicated with his solicitor. In ten minutes a will duly attested and with
  its proper thumb-mark signature lay in the solicitor's office three miles
  away. And then for a space Bindon sat very still.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he started out of a vague reverie and pressed an investigatory
  hand to his side.</p>

  <p>Then he jumped eagerly to his feet and rushed to the telephone. The
  Euthanasia Company had rarely been called by a client in a greater hurry.</p>

  <p>So it came at last that Denton and his Elizabeth, against all hope,
  returned unseparated from the labour servitude to which they had fallen.
  Elizabeth came out from her cramped subterranean den of metal-beaters and all
  the sordid circumstances of blue canvas, as one comes out of a nightmare.
  Back towards the sunlight their fortune took them; once the bequest was known
  to them, the bare thought of another day's hammering became intolerable. They
  went up long lifts and stairs to levels that they had not seen since the days
  of their disaster. At first she was full of this sensation of escape; even to
  think of the underways was intolerable; only after many months could she
  begin to recall with sympathy the faded women who were still below there,
  murmuring scandals and reminiscences and folly, and tapping away their
  lives.</p>

  <p>Her choice of apartments they presently took expressed the vehemence of
  her release. They were rooms upon the very verge of the city; they had a roof
  space and a balcony upon the city wall, wide open to the sun and wind, the
  country and the sky.</p>

  <p>And in that balcony comes the last scene in this story. It was summer
  sunsetting, and the hills of Surrey were very blue and clear. Denton leant
  upon the balcony regarding them, and Elizabeth sat by his side. Very wide and
  spacious was the view, from their balcony hung five hundred feet above the
  ancient level of the ground. The oblong of the Food Company, broken here and
  there by the ruins&mdash;grotesque little holes and sheds&mdash;of the
  ancient suburbs, and intersected by shinning streams of sewage, passed at
  last into a remote diapering at the foot of the distant hills. There once had
  been the squatting-place of the children of Uya. On those further slopes
  gaunt machines of unknown import worked slackly at the end of their spell,
  and the hill crest was set with stagnant wind vanes. Along the great south
  road the Labour Company's field workers in huge wheeled mechanical vehicles
  were hurrying back to their meals, their last spell finished. And through the
  air a dozen little private aeropiles sailed down towards the city. Familiar
  scene as it was to the eyes of Denton and Elizabeth, it would have filled the
  minds of their ancestors with incredulous amazement. Denton's thoughts
  fluttered towards the future in a vain attempt at what that scene might be in
  another two hundred years, and recoiling turned, towards the past.</p>

  <p>He shared something of the growing knowledge of the time; he could picture
  the quaint smoke-grimed Victorian city with its narrow little roads of beaten
  earth, it's wide common-land, ill-organised, ill-built suburbs, and irregular
  enclosures; the old countryside of the Stuart times, with its little villages
  and its petty London; the England of the monasteries, the far older England
  of the Roman dominion, and then before that a wild country; with here and
  there the huts of some warring tribe. These huts must have come and gone and
  come again through a space of years that made the Roman camp and villa seem
  but yesterday; and before those years, before even the huts, there had been
  men in the valley. Even then&mdash;so recent had it all been when one judged
  it by the standards of geological time&mdash;this valley had been here; and
  those hills yonder, higher perhaps, and snow-tipped, had still been yonder
  hills, and the Thames had flowed down from the Cotswolds to the sea. But the
  men had been but the shapes of men, creatures of darkness and ignorance,
  victims of beast and floods, storms and pestilence and incessant hunger. They
  had held a precarious foothold amidst bears and lions and all the monstrous
  violence of the past. Already some at least of these enemies were
  overcome...</p>

  <p>For a time Denton pursued the thoughts of this spacious vision, trying in
  obedience to his instinct to find his place and proportion in the scheme.</p>

  <p>"It has been chance," he said, "it has been luck. We have come through. It
  happens we have come through. Not by any strength of our own... And yet...
  No. I don't know."</p>

  <p>He was silent for a long time before he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"After all&mdash;there is a long time yet. There have scarcely been men
  for twenty thousand years&mdash;and there has been life for twenty millions.
  And what are generations? What are generations? It is enormous, and we are so
  little. Yet we know&mdash;we feel. We are not dumb atoms, we are part of it
  &mdash;part of it&mdash;to the limits of our strength and will. Even to die
  is part of it. Whether we die or live, we are in the making... As time goes
  on perhaps&mdash;men will be wiser... Wiser... Will they ever
  understand?"</p>

  <p>He became silent again. Elizabeth said nothing to these things, but she
  regarded his dreaming face with infinite affection. Her mind was not very
  active that evening. A great contentment possessed her. After a time she laid
  a gentle hand on his beside her. He fondled it softly, still looking out upon
  the spacious gold-woven view. So they sat as the sun went down. Until
  presently Elizabeth shivered. Denton recalled himself abruptly from these
  spacious issues of his leisure, and went in to fetch her shawl.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="story48"
     name="story48">THE STAR</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Graphic</i>, December 1897</h3>

  <p>It was on the first day of the New Year that the announcement was made,
  almost simultaneously from three observatories, that the motion of the planet
  Neptune, the outermost of all the planets that wheel about the sun, had
  become very erratic. Ogilvy had already called attention to a suspected
  retardation in its velocity in December. Such a piece of news was scarcely
  calculated to interest a world the greater portion of whose inhabitants were
  unaware of the existence of the planet Neptune, nor outside the astronomical
  profession did the subsequent discovery of a faint remote speck of light in
  the region of the perturbed planet cause any very great excitement.
  Scientific people, however, found the intelligence remarkable enough, even
  before it became known that the new body was rapidly growing larger and
  brighter, that its motion was quite different from the orderly progress of
  the planets, and that the deflection of Neptune and its satellite was
  becoming now of an unprecedented kind.</p>

  <p>Few people without a training in science can realise the huge isolation of
  the solar system. The sun with its specks of planets, its dust of planetoids,
  and its impalpable comets, swims in a vacant immensity that almost defeats
  the imagination. Beyond the orbit of Neptune there is space, vacant so far as
  human observation has penetrated, without warmth or light or sound, blank
  emptiness, for twenty million times a million miles. That is the smallest
  estimate of the distance to be traversed before the very nearest of the stars
  is attained. And saving a few comets more unsubstantial than the thinnest
  flame, no matter had ever to human knowledge crossed this gulf of space,
  until early in the twentieth century this strange wanderer appeared. A vast
  mass of matter it was, bulky, heavy, rushing without warning out of the black
  mystery of the sky into the radiance of the sun. By the second day it was
  clearly visible to any decent instrument, as a speck with a barely sensible
  diameter, in the constellation Leo near Regulus. In a little while an opera
  glass could attain it.</p>

  <p>On the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two hemispheres
  were made aware for the first time of the real importance of this unusual
  apparition in the heavens. "A Planetary Collision," one London paper headed
  the news, and proclaimed Duchaine's opinion that this strange new planet
  would probably collide with Neptune. The leader writers enlarged upon the
  topic; so that in most of the capitals of the world, on January 3rd, there
  was an expectation, however vague of some imminent phenomenon in the sky; and
  as the night followed the sunset round the globe, thousands of men turned
  their eyes skyward to see&mdash;the old familiar stars just as they had
  always been.</p>

  <p>Until it was dawn in London and Pollux setting and the stars overhead
  grown pale. The Winter's dawn it was, a sickly filtering accumulation of
  daylight, and the light of gas and candles shone yellow in the windows to
  show where people were astir. But the yawning policeman saw the thing, the
  busy crowds in the markets stopped agape, workmen going to their work
  betimes, milkmen, the drivers of news-carts, dissipation going home jaded and
  pale, homeless wanderers, sentinels on their beats, and in the country,
  labourers trudging afield, poachers slinking home, all over the dusky
  quickening country it could be seen&mdash;and out at sea by seamen watching
  for the day&mdash;a great white star, come suddenly into the westward
  sky!</p>

  <p>Brighter it was than any star in our skies; brighter than the evening star
  at its brightest. It still glowed out white and large, no mere twinkling spot
  of light, but a small round clear shining disc, an hour after the day had
  come. And where science has not reached, men stared and feared, telling one
  another of the wars and pestilences that are foreshadowed by these fiery
  signs in the Heavens. Sturdy Boers, dusky Hottentots, Gold Coast negroes,
  Frenchmen, Spaniards, Portuguese, stood in the warmth of the sunrise watching
  the setting of this strange new star.</p>

  <p>And in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed excitement,
  rising almost to shouting pitch, as the two remote bodies had rushed
  together; and a hurrying to and fro, to gather photographic apparatus and
  spectroscope, and this appliance and that, to record this novel astonishing
  sight, the destruction of a world. For it was a world, a sister planet of our
  earth, far greater than our earth indeed, that had so suddenly flashed into
  flaming death. Neptune it was, had been struck, fairly and squarely, by the
  strange planet from outer space and the heat of the concussion had
  incontinently turned two solid globes into one vast mass of incandescence.
  Round the world that day, two hours before the dawn, went the pallid great
  white star, fading only as it sank westward and the sun mounted above it.
  Everywhere men marvelled at it, but of all those who saw it none could have
  marvelled more than those sailors, habitual watchers of the stars, who far
  away at sea had heard nothing of its advent and saw it now rise like a pigmy
  moon and climb zenithward and hang overhead and sink westward with the
  passing of the night.</p>

  <p>And when next it rose over Europe everywhere were crowds of watchers on
  hilly slopes, on house-roofs, in open spaces, staring eastward for the rising
  of the great new star. It rose with a white glow in front of it, like the
  glare of a white fire, and those who had seen it come into existence the
  night before cried out at the sight of it. "It is larger," they cried. "It is
  brighter!" And, indeed the moon a quarter full and sinking in the west was in
  its apparent size beyond comparison, but scarcely in all its breadth had it
  as much brightness now as the little circle of the strange new star.</p>

  <p>"It is brighter!" cried the people clustering in the streets. But in the
  dim observatories the watchers held their breath and peered at one another.
  "It is nearer." They said. "Nearer!"</p>

  <p>And voice after voice repeated, "It is nearer," and the clicking telegraph
  took that up, and it trembled along telephone wires, and in a thousand cities
  grimy compositors fingered the type. "It is nearer." Men writing in offices,
  struck with a strange realisation, flung down their pens, men talking in a
  thousand places suddenly came upon a grotesque possibility in those words,
  "It is nearer." It hurried along wakening streets, it was shouted down the
  frost-stilled ways of quiet villages; men who had read these things from the
  throbbing tape stood in yellow-lit doorways shouting the news to the
  passers-by. "It is nearer." Pretty women, flushed and glittering, heard the
  news told jestingly between the dances, and feigned an intelligent interest
  they did not feel. "Nearer! Indeed. How curious! How very, very clever people
  must be to find out things like that!"</p>

  <p>Lonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those words to
  comfort themselves&mdash;looking skyward. "It has need to be nearer, for the
  night's as cold as charity. Don't seem much warmth from it, if it is nearer,
  all the same."</p>

  <p>"What is a new star to me?" cried the weeping woman kneeling beside her
  dead.</p>

  <p>The schoolboy, rising early for his examination work, puzzled it out for
  himself&mdash;with the great white star shining broad and bright through the
  frost-flowers of his window. "Centrifugal, centripetal." He said, with his
  chin on his fist. "Stop a planet in its flight, rob it of its centrifugal
  force, what then? Centripetal has it, and down it falls into the sun! And
  this&mdash;!</p>

  <p>"Do we come in the way? I wonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The light of that day went the way of its brethren, and with the later
  watches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star again. And it was now so
  bright that the waxing moon seemed but a pale yellow ghost of itself, hanging
  huge in the sunset. In a South African city a great man had married, and the
  streets were alight to welcome his return with his bride. "Even the skies
  have illuminated." Said the flatterer. Under Capricorn, two negro lovers,
  daring the wild beasts and evil spirits, for love of one another, crouched
  together in a cane brake where the fire-flies hovered. "That is our star."
  They whispered, and felt strangely comforted by the sweet brilliance of its
  light.</p>

  <p>The master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the papers
  from him. His calculations were already finished. In a small white phial
  there still remained a little of the drug that had kept him awake and active
  for four long nights. Each day, serene, explicit, patient as ever, he had
  given his lecture to his students, and then had come back at once to this
  momentous calculation. His face was grave, a little drawn and hectic from his
  drugged activity. For some time he seemed lost in thought. Then he went to
  the window, and the blind went up with a click. Half way up the sky, over the
  clustering roofs, chimneys and steeples of the city, hung the star.</p>

  <p>He looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave enemy. "You may
  kill me," he said after a silence. "But I can hold you&mdash;and all the
  universe for that matter&mdash;in the grip of this little brain. I would not
  change. Even now."</p>

  <p>He looked at the little phial. "There will be no need of sleep again," he
  said. The next day at noon, punctual to the minute, he entered his lecture
  theatre, put his hat on the end of the table as his habit was, and carefully
  selected a large piece of chalk. It was a joke among his students that he
  could not lecture without that piece of chalk to fumble in his fingers, and
  once he had been stricken to impotence by their hiding his supply. He came
  and looked under his grey eyebrows at the rising tiers of young fresh faces,
  and spoke with his accustomed studied commonness of phrasing. "Circumstances
  have arisen&mdash;circumstances beyond my control," he said and paused,
  "which will debar me from completing the course I had designed. It would
  seem, gentlemen, if I may put the thing clearly and briefly, that&mdash;Man
  has lived in vain."</p>

  <p>The students glanced at one another. Had they heard aright? Mad? Raised
  eyebrows and grinning lips there were, but one or two faces remained intent
  upon his calm grey-fringed face. "It will be interesting," he was saying, "to
  devote this morning to an exposition, so far as I can make it clear to you,
  of the calculations that have led me to this conclusion. Let us
  assume&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He turned towards the blackboard, meditating a diagram in the way that was
  usual to him. "What was that about 'lived in vain?'" whispered one student to
  another. "Listen," said the other, nodding towards the lecturer.</p>

  <p>And presently they began to understand.</p>

  <p>That night the star rose later, for its proper eastward motion had carried
  it some way across Leo towards Virgo, and its brightness was so great that
  the sky became a luminous blue as it rose, and every star was hidden in its
  turn, save only Jupiter near the zenith, Capella, Aldebaran, Sirius and the
  pointers of the Bear. It was very white and beautiful. In many parts of the
  world that night a pallid halo encircled it about. It was perceptibly larger;
  in the clear refractive sky of the tropics it seemed as if it were nearly a
  quarter the size of the moon. The frost was still on the ground in England,
  but the world was as brightly lit as if it were midsummer moonlight. One
  could see to read quite ordinary print by that cold clear light, and in the
  cities the lamps burnt yellow and wan.</p>

  <p>And everywhere the world was awake that night, and throughout Christendom
  a sombre murmur hung in the keen air over the country side like the belling
  of bees in the heather, and this murmurous tumult grew to a clangour in the
  cities. It was the tolling of the bells in a million belfry towers and
  steeples, summoning the people to sleep no more, to sin no more, but to
  gather in their churches and pray. And overhead, growing larger and brighter
  as the earth rolled on its way and the night passed, rose the dazzling
  star.</p>

  <p>And the streets and houses were alight in all the cities, the shipyards
  glared, and whatever roads led to high country were lit and crowded all night
  long. And in all the seas about the civilised lands, ships with throbbing
  engines, and ships with bellying sails, crowded with men and living
  creatures, were standing out to ocean and the north. For already the warning
  of the master mathematician had been telegraphed all over the world, and
  translated into a hundred tongues. The new planet and Neptune, locked in a
  fiery embrace, were whirling headlong, ever faster and faster towards the
  sun. Already every second this blazing mass flew a hundred miles, and every
  second its terrific velocity increased. As it flew now, indeed, it must pass
  a hundred million of miles wide of the earth and scarcely affect it. But near
  its destined path, as yet only slightly perturbed, spun the mighty planet
  Jupiter and his moons sweeping splendid round the sun. Every moment now the
  attraction between the fiery star and the greatest of the planets grew
  stronger. And the result of that attraction? Inevitably Jupiter would be
  deflected from its orbit into an elliptical path, and the burning star, swung
  by his attraction wide of its sunward rush, would "describe a curved path"
  and perhaps collide with, and certainly pass very close to, our earth.
  "Earthquakes, volcanic outbreaks, cyclones, sea waves, floods, and a steady
  rise in temperature to I know not what limit&mdash;" so prophesied the master
  mathematician.</p>

  <p>And overhead, to carry out his words, lonely and cold and livid, blazed
  the star of the coming doom.</p>

  <p>To many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached, it seemed that
  it was visibly approaching. And that night, too the weather changed, and the
  frost that had gripped all Central Europe and France and England softened
  towards a thaw.</p>

  <p>But you must not imagine because I have spoken of people praying through
  the night and people going aboard ships and people fleeing toward mountainous
  country that the whole world was already in a terror because of the star. As
  a matter of fact, use and wont still ruled the world, and save for the talk
  of idle moments and the splendour of the night, nine human beings out of ten
  were still busy at their common occupations. In all the cities the shops,
  save one here and there, opened and closed at their proper hours, the doctor
  and the undertaker plied their trades, the workers gathered in the factories,
  soldiers drilled, scholars studied, lovers sought one another, thieves lurked
  and fled, politicians planned their schemes. The presses of the newspapers
  roared through the night, and many a priest of this church and that would not
  open his holy building to further what he considered a foolish panic. The
  newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year 1000&mdash;for then too, people
  had anticipated the end. The star was no star&mdash;mere gas&mdash;a comet;
  and were it a star it could not possibly strike the earth. There was no
  precedent for such a thing. Common sense was sturdy everywhere, scornful,
  jesting, a little inclined to persecute the obdurate fearful. That night, at
  seven-fifteen by Greenwich time, the star would be at its nearest to Jupiter.
  Then the world would see the turn things would take. The master
  mathematician's grim warnings were treated by many as so much mere elaborate
  self-advertisement. Common sense at last, a little heated by argument,
  signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed. So too, barbarism and
  savagery, already tired of the novelty, went about their nightly business,
  and save for a howling dog here and there, the beast world left the star
  unheeded.</p>

  <p>And yet, when at last the watchers in the European States saw the star
  rise, an hour later it is true, but no larger than it had been the night
  before, there were still plenty awake to laugh at the master mathematician
  &mdash;to take the danger as if it had passed.</p>

  <p>But hereafter the laughter ceased. The star grew&mdash;it grew with a
  terrible steadiness hour after hour, a little larger each hour, a little
  nearer the midnight zenith, and brighter and brighter, until it had turned
  night into a second day. Had it come straight to the earth instead of in a
  curved path, had it lost no velocity to Jupiter, it must have leapt the
  intervening gulf in a day, but as it was it took five days altogether to come
  by our planet. The next night it had become a third the size of the moon
  before it set to English eyes, and the thaw was assured. It rose over America
  near the size of the moon, but blinding white to look at, and hot; and a
  breath of hot wind blew now with its rising and gathering strength, and in
  Virginia, and Brazil, and down the St. Lawrence valley, it shone
  intermittently through a driving reek of thunder-clouds, flickering violet
  lightning, and hail unprecedented. In Manitoba was a thaw and devastating
  floods. And upon all the mountains of the earth the snow and ice began to
  melt that night, and all the rivers coming out of high country flowed thick
  and turbid, and soon&mdash;in their upper reaches&mdash;with swirling trees
  and the bodies of beasts and men. They rose steadily, steadily in the ghostly
  brilliance, and came trickling over their banks at last, behind the fleeing
  population of their valleys.</p>

  <p>And along the coast of Argentina and up the South Atlantic the tides were
  higher than had ever been in the memory of man, and the storms drove the
  waters in many cases scores of miles inland, drowning whole cities. And so
  great grew the heat during the night that the rising of the sun was like the
  coming of a shadow. The earthquakes began and grew until all down America
  from the Arctic Circle to Cape Horn, hillsides were sliding, fissures were
  opening, and houses and walls crumbling to destruction. The whole side of
  Cotopaxi slipped out in one vast convulsion, and a tumult of lava poured out
  so high and broad and swift and liquid that in one day it reached the
  sea.</p>

  <p>So the star, with the wan moon in its wake, marched across the Pacific,
  trailed the thunderstorms like the hem of a robe, and the growing tidal wave
  that toiled behind it, frothing and eager, poured over island and island and
  swept them clear of men. Until that wave came at last&mdash;in a blinding
  light and with the breath of a furnace, swift and terrible it came&mdash;a
  wall of water, fifty feet high, roaring hungrily, upon the long coasts of
  Asia, and swept inland across the plains of China. For a space the star,
  hotter now and larger and brighter than the sun in its strength, showed with
  pitiless brilliance the wide and populous country; towns and villages with
  their pagodas and trees, roads, wide cultivated fields, millions of sleepless
  people staring in helpless terror at the incandescent sky; and then, low and
  growing, came the murmur of the flood. And thus it was with millions of men
  that night&mdash;a flight no-whither, with limbs heavy with heat and breath
  fierce and scant, and the flood like a wall swift and white behind. And then
  death.</p>

  <p>China was lit glowing white, but over Japan and Java and all the islands
  of Eastern Asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire because of the
  steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were spouting forth to salute its
  coming. Above was the lava, hot gases and ash, and below the seething floods,
  and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with the earthquake shocks. Soon the
  immemorial snows of Thibet and the Himalaya were melting and pouring down by
  ten million deepening converging channels upon the plains of Burmah and
  Hindostan. The tangled summits of the Indian jungles were aflame in a
  thousand places, and below the hurrying waters around the stems were dark
  objects that still struggled feebly and reflected the blood-red tongues of
  fire. And in a rudderless confusion a multitude of men and women fled down
  the broad river-ways to that one last hope of men&mdash;the open sea.</p>

  <p>Larger grew the star, and larger, hotter, and brighter with a terrible
  swiftness now. The tropical ocean had lost its phosphorescence, and the
  whirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that plunged
  incessantly, speckled with storm-tossed ships.</p>

  <p>And then came a wonder. It seemed to those who in Europe watched for the
  rising of the star that the world must have ceased its rotation. In a
  thousand open spaces of down and upland the people who had fled thither from
  the floods and the falling houses and sliding slopes of hill watched for that
  rising in vain. Hour followed hour through a terrible suspense, and the star
  rose not. Once again men set their eyes upon the old constellations they had
  counted lost to them forever. In England it was hot and clear overhead,
  though the ground quivered perpetually, but in the tropics, Sirius and
  Capella and Aldebaran showed through a veil of steam. And when at last the
  great star rose near ten hours late, the sun rose close upon it, and in the
  centre of its white heart was a disc of black.</p>

  <p>Over Asia it was the star had begun to fall behind the movement of the
  sky, and then suddenly, as it hung over India, its light had been veiled. All
  the plain of India from the mouth of the Indus to the mouths of the Ganges
  was a shallow waste of shining water that night, out of which rose temples
  and palaces, mounds and hills, black with people. Every minaret was a
  clustering mass of people, who fell one by one into the turbid waters, as
  heat and terror overcame them. The whole land seemed a-wailing and suddenly
  there swept a shadow across that furnace of despair, and a breath of cold
  wind, and a gathering of clouds, out of the cooling air. Men looking up, near
  blinded, at the star, saw that a black disc was creeping across the light. It
  was the moon, coming between the star and the earth. And even as men cried to
  God at this respite, out of the East with a strange inexplicable swiftness
  sprang the sun. And then star, sun and moon rushed together across the
  heavens.</p>

  <p>So it was that presently, to the European watchers, star and sun rose
  close upon each other, drove headlong for a space and then slower, and at
  last came to rest, star and sun merged into one glare of flame at the zenith
  of the sky. The moon no longer eclipsed the star but was lost to sight in the
  brilliance of the sky. And though those who were still alive regarded it for
  the most part with that dull stupidity that hunger, fatigue, heat and despair
  engender, there were still men who could perceive the meaning of these signs.
  Star and earth had been at their nearest, had swung about one another, and
  the star had passed. Already it was receding, swifter and swifter, in the
  last stage of its headlong journey downward into the sun.</p>

  <p>And then the clouds gathered, blotting out the vision of the sky, the
  thunder and lightning wove a garment round the world; all over the earth was
  such a downpour of rain as men had never before seen, and where the volcanoes
  flared red against the cloud canopy there descended torrents of mud.
  Everywhere the waters were pouring off the land, leaving mud-silted ruins,
  and the earth littered like a storm-worn beach with all that had floated, and
  the dead bodies of the men and brutes, its children. For days the water
  streamed off the land, sweeping away soil and trees and houses in the way,
  and piling huge dykes and scooping out Titanic gullies over the country side.
  Those were the days of darkness that followed the star and the heat. All
  through them, and for many weeks and months, the earthquakes continued.</p>

  <p>But the star had passed, and men, hunger-driven and gathering courage only
  slowly, might creep back to their ruined cities, buried granaries, and sodden
  fields. Such few ships as had escaped the storms of that time came stunned
  and shattered and sounding their way cautiously through the new marks and
  shoals of once familiar ports. And as the storms subsided men perceived that
  everywhere the days were hotter than of yore, and the sun larger, and the
  moon, shrunk to a third of its former size, took now fourscore days between
  its new, and next new moon.</p>

  <p>But of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men, of the saving of
  laws and books and machines, of the strange change that had come over Iceland
  and Greenland and the shores of Baffin's Bay, so that the sailors coming
  there presently found them green and gracious, and could scarce believe their
  eyes, this story does not tell. Nor of the movement of mankind now that the
  earth was hotter, northward and southward towards the poles of the earth. It
  concerns itself only with the coming and the passing of the Star.</p>

  <p>The Martian astronomers&mdash;for there are astronomers on Mars, although
  they are very different beings from men&mdash;were naturally profoundly
  interested by these things. They saw them from their own standpoint of
  course. "Considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was flung
  through our solar system into the sun," one wrote, "it is astonishing what a
  little damage the Earth, which it missed so narrowly, has sustained. All the
  familiar continental markings and the masses of the seas remain intact, and
  indeed the only difference seems to be a shrinkage of the white discoloration
  (supposed to be frozen water) round either pole." Which only shows how small
  the vastest of human catastrophes may seem, at a distance of a few million
  miles.</p>

     name="story49">THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Illustrated London News</i>, July 1898<br>
  Also published as "The Miracle Maker"</h3>

  <p>It is doubtful whether the gift was innate. For my own part, I think it
  came to him suddenly. Indeed, until he was thirty he was a sceptic, and did
  not believe in miraculous powers. And here, since it is the most convenient
  place, I must mention that he was a little man, and had eyes of a hot brown,
  very erect red hair, a moustache with ends that he twisted up, and freckles.
  His name was George McWhirter Fotheringay&mdash;not the sort of name by any
  means to lead to any expectation of miracles&mdash;and he was clerk at
  Gomshott's. He was greatly addicted to assertive argument. It was while he
  was asserting the impossibility of miracles that he had his first intimation
  of his extraordinary powers. This particular argument was being held in the
  bar of the Long Dragon, and Toddy Beamish was conducting the opposition by a
  monotonous but effective "So you say," that drove Mr. Fotheringay to the very
  limit of his patience.</p>

  <p>There were present, besides these two, a very dusty cyclist, landlord Cox,
  and Miss Maybridge, the perfectly respectable and rather portly barmaid of
  the Dragon. Miss Maybridge was standing with her back to Mr. Fotheringay,
  washing glasses; the others were watching him, more or less amused by the
  present ineffectiveness of the assertive method. Goaded by the Torres Vedras
  tactics of Mr. Beamish, Mr. Fotheringay determined to make an unusual
  rhetorical effort. "Looky here, Mr. Beamish," said Mr. Fotheringay. "Let us
  clearly understand what a miracle is. It's something contrariwise to the
  course of nature, done by power of Will, something what couldn't happen
  without being specially willed."</p>

  <p>"So you say," said Mr. Beamish, repulsing him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fotheringay appealed to the cyclist, who had hitherto been a silent
  auditor, and received his assent&mdash;given with a hesitating cough and a
  glance at Mr. Beamish. The landlord would express no opinion, and Mr.
  Fotheringay, returning to Mr. Beamish, received the unexpected concession of
  a qualified assent to his definition of a miracle.</p>

  <p>"For instance," said Mr. Fotheringay, greatly encouraged. "Here would be a
  miracle. That lamp, in the natural course of nature, couldn't burn like that
  upsy-down, could it, Beamish?"</p>

  <p>"You say it couldn't," said Beamish.</p>

  <p>"And you?" said Fotheringay. "You don't mean to say&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Beamish reluctantly. "No, it couldn't."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Mr. Fotheringay. "Then here comes someone, as it might
  be me, along here, and stands as it might be here, and says to that lamp, as
  I might do, collecting all my will&mdash;'Turn upsy-down without breaking,
  and go on burning steady', and&mdash;Hullo!"</p>

  <p>It was enough to make anyone say "Hullo!" The impossible, the incredible,
  was visible to them all. The lamp hung inverted in the air, burning quietly
  with its flame pointing down. It was as solid, as indisputable as ever a lamp
  was, the prosaic common lamp of the Long Dragon bar.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fotheringay stood with an extended forefinger and the knitted brows of
  one anticipating a catastrophic smash. The cyclist, who was sitting next the
  lamp, ducked and jumped across the bar. Everybody jumped, more or less. Miss
  Maybridge turned and screamed. For nearly three seconds the lamp remained
  still. A faint cry of mental distress came from Mr. Fotheringay. "I can't
  keep it up," he said, "any longer." He staggered back, and the inverted lamp
  suddenly flared, fell against the corner of the bar, bounced aside, smashed
  upon the floor, and went out.</p>

  <p>It was lucky it had a metal receiver, or the whole place would have been
  in a blaze. Mr. Cox was the first to speak, and his remark, shorn of needless
  excrescences, was to the effect that Fotheringay was a fool. Fotheringay was
  beyond disputing even so fundamental a proposition as that! He was astonished
  beyond measure at the thing that had occurred. The subsequent conversation
  threw absolutely no light on the matter so far as Fotheringay was concerned;
  the general opinion not only followed Mr. Cox very closely but very
  vehemently. Everyone accused Fotheringay of a silly trick, and presented him,
  to himself, as a foolish destroyer of comfort and security. His mind was in a
  tornado of perplexity, he was himself inclined to agree with them, and he
  made a remarkably ineffectual opposition to the proposal of his
  departure.</p>

  <p>He went home flushed and heated, coat-collar crumpled, eyes smarting and
  ears red. He watched each of the ten street lamps nervously as he passed it.
  It was only when he found himself alone in his little bedroom in Church Row
  that he was able to grapple seriously with his memories of the occurrence,
  and ask, "What on earth happened?"</p>

  <p>He had removed his coat and boots, and was sitting on the bed with his
  hands in his pockets repeating the text of his defence for the seventeenth
  time, "I didn't want the confounded thing to upset," when it occurred to him
  that at the precise moment he had said the commanding words he had
  inadvertently willed the thing he said, and that when he had seen the lamp in
  the air he had felt it depended on him to maintain it there without being
  clear how this was to be done. He had not a particularly complex mind, or he
  might have stuck for a time at that "inadvertently willed," embracing, as it
  does, the abstrusest problems of voluntary action; but as it was, the idea
  came to him with a quite acceptable haziness. And from that, following, as I
  must admit, no clear logical path, he came to the test of experiment.</p>

  <p>He pointed resolutely to his candle and collected his mind, though he felt
  he did a foolish thing. "Be raised up," he said. But in a second that feeling
  vanished. The candle was raised, hung in the air one giddy moment, and as Mr.
  Fotheringay gasped, fell with a smash on his toilet-table, leaving him in
  darkness save for the expiring glow of its wick.</p>

  <p>For a time Mr. Fotheringay sat in the darkness, perfectly still. "It did
  happen, after all," he said. "And 'ow I'm to explain it I don't know." He
  sighed heavily, and began feeling in his pockets for a match. He could find
  none, and he rose and groped about the toilet-table. "I wish I had a match,"
  he said. He resorted to his coat, and there was none there, and then it
  dawned upon him that miracles were possible even with matches. He extended a
  hand and scowled at it in the dark. "Let there be a match in that hand," he
  said. He felt some light object fall across his palm, and his fingers closed
  upon a match.</p>

  <p>After several ineffectual attempts to light this, he discovered it was a
  safety-match. He threw it down, and then it occurred to him that he might
  have willed it lit. He did, and perceived it burning in the midst of his
  toilet-table mat. He caught it up hastily, and it went out. His perception of
  possibilities enlarged, and he felt for and replaced the candle in its
  candlestick. "Here! You be lit," said Mr. Fotheringay, and forthwith the
  candle was flaring, and he saw a little black hole in the toilet-cover, with
  a wisp of smoke rising from it. For a time he stared from this to the little
  flame and back, and then looked up and met his own gaze in the looking glass.
  By this help he communed with himself in silence for a time.</p>

  <p>"How about miracles now?" said Mr. Fotheringay at last, addressing his
  reflection.</p>

  <p>The subsequent meditations of Mr. Fotheringay were of a severe but
  confused description. So far, he could see it was a case of pure willing with
  him. The nature of his experiences so far disinclined him for any further
  experiments, at least until he had reconsidered them. But he lifted a sheet
  of paper, and turned a glass of water pink and then green, and he created a
  snail, which he miraculously annihilated, and got himself a miraculous new
  tooth-brush. Somewhen in the small hours he had reached the fact that his
  will-power must be of a particularly rare and pungent quality, a fact of
  which he had certainly had inklings before, but no certain assurance. The
  scare and perplexity of his first discovery was now qualified by pride in
  this evidence of singularity and by vague intimations of advantage. He became
  aware that the church clock was striking one, and as it did not occur to him
  that his daily duties at Gomshott's might be miraculously dispensed with, he
  resumed undressing, in order to get to bed without further delay. As he
  struggled to get his shirt over his head, he was struck with a brilliant
  idea. "Let me be in bed," he said, and found himself so. "Undressed," he
  stipulated; and finding the sheets cold, added hastily, "and in my
  nightshirt&mdash;no, in a nice soft woollen nightshirt. Ah!" he said with
  immense enjoyment. "And now let me be comfortably asleep..."</p>

  <p>He awoke at his usual hour and was pensive all through breakfast-time,
  wondering whether his overnight experience might not be a particularly vivid
  dream. At length his mind turned again to cautious experiments. For instance,
  he had three eggs for breakfast; two his landlady had supplied, good but
  shoppy, and one was a delicious fresh goose-egg, laid, cooked, and served by
  his extraordinary will. He hurried off to Gomshott's in a state of profound
  but carefully concealed excitement, and only remembered the shell of the
  third egg when his landlady spoke of it that night. All day he could do no
  work because of this astonishingly new self-knowledge, but this caused him no
  inconvenience, because he made up for it miraculously in his last ten
  minutes.</p>

  <p>As the day wore on his state of mind passed from wonder to elation, albeit
  the circumstances of his dismissal from the Long Dragon were still
  disagreeable to recall, and a garbled account of the matter that had reached
  his colleagues led to some badinage. It was evident he must be careful how he
  lifted frangible articles, but in other ways his gift promised more and more
  as he turned it over in his mind. He intended among other things to increase
  his personal property by unostentatious acts of creation. He called into
  existence a pair of very splendid diamond studs, and hastily annihilated them
  again as young Gomshott came across the counting-house to his desk. He was
  afraid young Gomshott might wonder how he had come by them. He saw quite
  clearly the gift required caution and watchfulness in its exercise, but so
  far as he could judge the difficulties attending its mastery would be no
  greater than those he had already faced in the study of cycling. It was that
  analogy, perhaps, quite as much as the feeling that he would be unwelcome in
  the Long Dragon, that drove him out after supper into the lane beyond the
  gas-works, to rehearse a few miracles in private.</p>

  <p>There was possibly a certain want of originality in his attempts, for
  apart from his will-power Mr. Fotheringay was not a very exceptional man. The
  miracle of Moses' rod came to his mind, but the night was dark and
  unfavourable to the proper control of large miraculous snakes. Then he
  recollected the story of "Tannhauser" that he had read on the back of the
  Philharmonic programme. That seemed to him singularly attractive and
  harmless. He stuck his walking-stick&mdash;a very nice Poona-Penang
  lawyer&mdash;into the turf that edged the footpath, and commanded the dry
  wood to blossom. The air was immediately full of the scent of roses, and by
  means of a match he saw for himself that this beautiful miracle was indeed
  accomplished. His satisfaction was ended by advancing footsteps. Afraid of a
  premature discovery of his powers, he addressed the blossoming stick hastily:
  "Go back." What he meant was "Change back;" but of course he was confused.
  The stick receded at a considerable velocity, and incontinently came a cry of
  anger and a bad word from the approaching person. "Who are you throwing
  brambles at, you fool?" cried a voice. "That got me on the shin."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, old chap," said Mr. Fotheringay, and then realising the
  awkward nature of the explanation, caught nervously at his moustache. He saw
  Winch, one of the three Immering constables, advancing.</p>

  <p>"What d'yer mean by it?" asked the constable. "Hullo! It's you, is it? The
  gent that broke the lamp at the Long Dragon!"</p>

  <p>"I don't mean anything by it," said Mr. Fotheringay. "Nothing at all."</p>

  <p>"What d'yer do it for then?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, bother!" said Mr. Fotheringay.</p>

  <p>"Bother indeed! D'yer know that stick hurt? What d'yer do it for, eh?"</p>

  <p>For the moment Mr. Fotheringay could not think what he had done it for.
  His silence seemed to irritate Mr. Winch. "You've been assaulting the police,
  young man, this time. That's what you done."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mr. Winch," said Mr. Fotheringay, annoyed and confused, "I'm
  very sorry. The fact is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>He could think of no way but the truth. "I was working a miracle." He
  tried to speak in an off-hand way, but try as he would he couldn't.</p>

  <p>"Working a&mdash;! 'Ere, don't you talk rot. Working a miracle, indeed!
  Miracle! Well, that's downright funny! Why, you's the chap that don't believe
  in miracles... Fact is, this is another of your silly conjuring
  tricks&mdash;that's what this is. Now, I tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Mr. Fotheringay never heard what Mr. Winch was going to tell him. He
  realised he had given himself away, flung his valuable secret to all the
  winds of heaven. A violent gust of irritation swept him to action. He turned
  on the constable swiftly and fiercely. "Here," he said, "I've had enough of
  this, I have! I'll show you a silly conjuring trick, I will! Go to Hades! Go,
  now!"</p>

  <p>He was alone!</p>

  <p>Mr. Fotheringay performed no more miracles that night nor did he trouble
  to see what had become of his flowering stick. He returned to the town,
  scared and very quiet, and went to his bedroom. "Lord!" he said, "It's a
  powerful gift&mdash;an extremely powerful gift. I didn't hardly mean as much
  as that. Not really... I wonder what Hades is like!"</p>

  <p>He sat on the bed taking off his boots. Struck by a happy thought he
  transferred the constable to San Francisco, and without any more interference
  with normal causation went soberly to bed. In the night he dreamt of the
  anger of Winch.</p>

  <p>The next day Mr. Fotheringay heard two interesting items of news. Someone
  had planted a most beautiful climbing rose against the elder Mr. Gomshott's
  private house in the Lullaborough Road, and the river as far as Rawling's
  Mill was to be dragged for Constable Winch.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fotheringay was abstracted and thoughtful all that day, and performed
  no miracles except certain provisions for Winch, and the miracle of
  completing his day's work with punctual perfection in spite of all the
  bee-swarm of thoughts that hummed through his mind. And the extraordinary
  abstraction and meekness of his manner was remarked by several people, and
  made a matter for jesting. For the most part he was thinking of Winch.</p>

  <p>On Sunday evening he went to chapel and oddly enough, Mr. Maydig, who took
  a certain interest in occult matters, preached about "things that are not
  lawful." Mr. Fotheringay was not a regular chapel goer, but the system of
  assertive scepticism, to which I have already alluded, was now very much
  shaken. The tenor of the sermon threw an entirely new light on these novel
  gifts, and he suddenly decided to consult Mr. Maydig immediately after the
  service. So soon as that was determined, he found himself wondering why he
  had not done so before.</p>

  <p>Mr. Maydig, a lean, excitable man with quite remarkably long wrists and
  neck, was gratified at a request for a private conversation from a young man
  whose carelessness in religious matters was a subject for general remark in
  the town. After a few necessary delays, he conducted him to the study of the
  Manse, which was contiguous to the dispel, seated him comfortably, and
  standing in front of a cheerful fire&mdash;his legs threw a Rhodian arch of
  shadow on the opposite wall&mdash;requested Mr. Fotheringay to state his
  business.</p>

  <p>At first Mr. Fotheringay was a little abashed, and found some difficulty
  in opening the matter. "You will scarcely believe me, Mr. Maydig, I am
  afraid&mdash;" and so forth for some time. He tried a question at last, and
  asked Mr. Maydig his opinion of miracles.</p>

  <p>Mr. Maydig was still saying "Well" in an extremely judicial tone, when Mr.
  Fotheringay interrupted again: "You don't believe, I suppose, that some
  common sort of person&mdash;like myself, for instance&mdash;as it might be
  sitting here now, might have some sort of twist inside him that made him able
  to do things by his will."</p>

  <p>"It's possible," said Mr. Maydig. "Something of the sort, perhaps, is
  possible."</p>

  <p>"If I might make free with something here, I think I might show you by a
  sort of experiment," said Mr. Fotheringay. "Now, take that tobacco-jar on the
  table, for instance. What I want to know is whether what I am going to do
  with it is a miracle or not. Just half a minute, Mr. Maydig, please."</p>

  <p>He knitted his brows, pointed to the tobacco-jar and said: "Be a bowl of
  violets."</p>

  <p>The tobacco-jar did as it was ordered.</p>

  <p>Mr. Maydig started violently at the change, and stood looking from the
  thaumaturgist to the bowl of flowers. He said nothing. Presently he ventured
  to lean over the table and smell the violets; they were fresh-picked and very
  fine ones. Then he stared at Mr. Fotheringay again.</p>

  <p>"How did you do that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fotheringay pulled his moustache. "Just told it&mdash;and there you
  are. Is that a miracle, or is it black art, or what is it? And what do you
  think's the matter with me? That's what I want to ask."</p>

  <p>"It's a most extraordinary occurrence."</p>

  <p>"And this day last week I knew no more that I could do things like that
  than you did. It came quite sudden. It's something odd about my will, I
  suppose, and that's as far as I can see."</p>

  <p>"Is that&mdash;the only thing? Could you do other things besides
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, yes!" said Mr. Fotheringay. "Just anything." He thought, and
  suddenly recalled a conjuring entertainment he had seen. "Here!" He pointed.
  "Change into a bowl of fish&mdash;no, not that&mdash;change into a glass bowl
  full of water with goldfish swimming in it. That's better! You see that, Mr.
  Maydig?"</p>

  <p>"It's astonishing. It's incredible. You are either a most extraordinary...
  But no&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I could change it into anything," said Mr. Fotheringay. "Just anything.
  Here! Be a pigeon, will you?"</p>

  <p>In another moment a blue pigeon was fluttering round the room and making
  Mr. Maydig duck every time it came near him. "Stop there, will you," said Mr.
  Fotheringay; and the pigeon hung motionless in the air. "I could change it
  back to a bowl of flowers," he said, and after replacing the pigeon on the
  table worked that miracle. "I expect you will want your pipe in a bit," he
  said, and restored the tobacco-jar.</p>

  <p>Mr. Maydig had followed all these later changes in a sort of ejaculatory
  silence. He stared at Mr. Fotheringay and, in a very gingerly manner, picked
  up the tobacco-jar, examined it, replaced it on the table. "Well!" was the
  only expression of his feelings.</p>

  <p>"Now, after that it's easier to explain what I came about," said Mr.
  Fotheringay; and proceeded to a lengthy and involved narrative of his strange
  experiences, beginning with the affair of the lamp in the Long Dragon and
  complicated by persistent allusions to Winch. As he went on, the transient
  pride Mr. Maydig's consternation had caused passed away; he became the very
  ordinary Mr. Fotheringay of everyday intercourse again. Mr. Maydig listened
  intently, the tobacco-jar in his hand, and his bearing changed also with the
  course of the narrative. Presently, while Mr. Fotheringay was dealing with
  the miracle of the third egg, the minister interrupted with a fluttering
  extended hand&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It is possible," he said. "It is credible. It is amazing, of course, but
  it reconciles a number of amazing difficulties. The power to work miracles is
  a gift&mdash;a peculiar quality like genius or second sight&mdash;hitherto it
  has come very rarely and to exceptional people. But in this case... I have
  always wondered at the miracles of Mahomet, and at Yogi's miracles, and the
  miracles of Madame Blavatsky. But, of course! Yes, it is simply a gift! It
  carries out so beautifully the arguments of that great thinker&mdash;" Mr.
  Maydig's voice sank&mdash;"his Grace the Duke of Argyll. Here we plumb some
  profounder law&mdash;deeper than the ordinary laws of nature. Yes&mdash;yes.
  Go on. Go on!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Fotheringay proceeded to tell of his misadventure with Winch, and Mr.
  Maydig, no longer overawed or scared, began to jerk his limbs about and
  interject astonishment. "It's this what troubled me most," proceeded Mr.
  Fotheringay; "it's this I'm most mijitly in want of advice for; of course
  he's at San Francisco&mdash;wherever San Francisco may be&mdash;but of course
  it's awkward for both of us, as you'll see, Mr. Maydig. I don't see how he
  can understand what has happened, and I daresay he's scared and exasperated
  something tremendous, and trying to get at me. I daresay he keeps on starting
  off to come here. I send him back, by a miracle, every few hours, when I
  think of it. And of course, that's a thing he won't be able to understand,
  and it's bound to annoy him; and of course, if he takes a ticket every time
  it will cost him a lot of money. I done the best I could for him, but of
  course it's difficult for him to put himself in my place. I thought
  afterwards that his clothes might have got scorched, you know&mdash;if Hades
  is all it's supposed to be&mdash;before I shifted him. In that case I suppose
  they'd have locked him up in San Francisco. Of course I willed him a new suit
  of clothes on him directly I thought of it. But you see, I'm already in a
  deuce of a tangle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Maydig looked serious. "I see you are in a tangle. Yes, it's a
  difficult position. How you are to end it..." He became diffuse and
  inconclusive.</p>

  <p>"However, we'll leave Winch for a little and discuss the larger question.
  I don't think this is a case of the black art or anything of the sort. I
  don't think there is any taint of criminality about it at all, Mr.
  Fotheringay&mdash;none whatever, unless you are suppressing material facts.
  No, it's miracles&mdash;pure miracles&mdash;miracles, if I may say so, of the
  very highest class."</p>

  <p>He began to pace the hearthrug and gesticulate, while Mr. Fotheringay sat
  with his arm on the table and his head on his arm, looking worried. "I don't
  see how I'm to manage about Winch," he said.</p>

  <p>"A gift of working miracles&mdash;apparently a very powerful gift," said
  Mr. Maydig, "will find a way about Winch&mdash;never fear. My dear Sir, you
  are a most important man&mdash;a man of the most astonishing possibilities.
  As evidence, for example! And in other ways, the things you may do..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've thought of a thing or two," said Mr. Fotheringay.
  "But&mdash;some of the things came a bit twisty. You saw that fish at first?
  Wrong sort of bowl and wrong sort of fish. And I thought I'd ask
  someone."</p>

  <p>"A proper course," said Mr. Maydig, "a very proper course&mdash;altogether
  the proper course." He stopped and looked at Mr. Fotheringay. "It's
  practically an unlimited gift. Let us test your powers, for instance. If they
  really are... If they really are all they seem to be."</p>

  <p>And so, incredible as it may seem, in the study of the little house behind
  the Congregational Chapel, on the evening of Sunday, Nov. 10, 1896, Mr.
  Fotheringay, egged on and inspired by Mr. Maydig, began to work miracles. The
  reader's attention is specially and definitely called to the date. He will
  object, probably has already objected, that certain points in this story are
  improbable, that if any things of the sort already described had indeed
  occurred, they would have been in all the papers a year ago. The details
  immediately following he will find particularly hard to accept, because among
  other things they involve the conclusion that he or she, the reader in
  question, must have been killed in a violent and unprecedented manner more
  than a year ago. Now a miracle is nothing if not improbable, and as a matter
  of fact the reader was killed in a violent and unprecedented manner a year
  ago. In the subsequent course of this story that will become perfectly clear
  and credible, as every right-minded and reasonable reader will admit. But
  this is not the place for the end of the story, being but little beyond the
  hither side of the middle. And at first the miracles worked by Mr.
  Fotheringay were timid little miracles&mdash;little things with the cups and
  parlour fitments, as feeble as the miracles of Theosophists, and feeble as
  they were, they were received with awe by his collaborator. He would have
  preferred to settle the Winch business out of hand, but Mr. Maydig would not
  let him. But after they had worked a dozen of these domestic trivialities,
  their sense of power grew, their imagination began to show signs of
  stimulation, and their ambition enlarged. Their first larger enterprise was
  due to hunger and the negligence of Mrs. Minchin, Mr. Maydig's housekeeper.
  The meal to which the minister conducted Mr. Fotheringay was certainly
  ill-laid and uninviting as refreshment for two industrious miracle-workers;
  but they were seated, and Mr. Maydig was descanting in sorrow rather than in
  anger upon his housekeeper's shortcomings, before it occurred to Mr.
  Fotheringay that an opportunity lay before him. "Don't you think, Mr.
  Maydig," he said; "if it isn't a liberty, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Fotheringay! Of course! No&mdash;I didn't think."</p>

  <p>Mr. Fotheringay waved his hand. "What shall we have?" he said, in a large,
  inclusive spirit, and at Mr. Maydig's order, revised the supper very
  thoroughly. "As for me," he said, eyeing Mr. Maydig's selection, "I am always
  particularly fond of a tankard of stout and a nice Welsh rarebit, and I'll
  order that. I ain't much given to Burgundy," and forthwith stout and Welsh
  rarebit promptly appeared at his command. They sat long at their supper,
  talking like equals, as Mr. Fotheringay presently perceived, with a glow of
  surprise and gratification, of all the miracles they would presently do. "And
  by the bye, Mr. Maydig," said Mr. Fotheringay, "I might perhaps be able to
  help you&mdash;in a domestic way."</p>

  <p>"Don't quite follow," said Mr. Maydig pouring out a glass of miraculous
  old Burgundy.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fotheringay helped himself to a second Welsh rarebit out of vacancy,
  and took a mouthful. "I was thinking," he said, "I might be able (chum, chum)
  to work (chum, chum) a miracle with Mrs. Minchin (chum, chum)&mdash;make her
  a better woman."</p>

  <p>Mr. Maydig put down the glass and looked doubtful. "She's&mdash;She
  strongly objects to interference, you know, Mr. Fotheringay. And&mdash;as a
  matter of fact&mdash;it's well past eleven and she's probably in bed and
  asleep. Do you think, on the whole&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Fotheringay considered these objections. "I don't see that it
  shouldn't be done in her sleep."</p>

  <p>For a time Mr. Maydig opposed the idea, and then he yielded. Mr.
  Fotheringay issued his orders, and a little less at their ease perhaps, the
  two gentlemen proceeded with their repast. Mr. Maydig was enlarging on the
  changes he might expect in his housekeeper next day, with an optimism that
  seemed even to Mr. Fotheringay's super senses a little forced and hectic,
  when a series of confused noises from upstairs began. Their eyes exchanged
  interrogations, and Mr. Maydig left the room hastily. Mr. Fotheringay heard
  him calling up to his housekeeper and then his footsteps going softly up to
  her.</p>

  <p>In a minute or so the minister returned, his step light, his face radiant.
  "Wonderful!" he said, "and touching! Most touching!"</p>

  <p>He began pacing the hearthrug. "A repentance&mdash;a most touching
  repentance&mdash;through the crack of the door. Poor woman! A most wonderful
  change! She had got up. She must have got up at once. She had got up out of
  her sleep to smash a private bottle of brandy in her box. And to confess it
  tool... But this gives us&mdash;it opens&mdash;a most amazing vista of
  possibilities. If we can work this miraculous change in her..."</p>

  <p>"The thing's unlimited seemingly," said Mr. Fotheringay. "And about Mr.
  Winch&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Altogether unlimited." And from the hearthrug Mr. Maydig, waving the
  Winch difficulty aside, unfolded a series of wonderful
  proposals&mdash;proposals he invented as he went along.</p>

  <p>Now what those proposals were does not concern the essentials of this
  story. Suffice it that they were designed in a spirit of infinite
  benevolence, the sort of benevolence that used to be called post-prandial.
  Suffice it too, that the problem of Winch remained unsolved. Nor is it
  necessary to describe how far that series got to its fulfilment. There were
  astonishing changes. The small hours found Mr. Maydig and Mr. Fotheringay
  careering across the chilly market-square under the still moon, in a sort of
  ecstasy of thaumaturgy, Mr. Maydig all flap and gesture, Mr. Fotheringay
  short and bristling, and no longer abashed at his greatness. They had
  reformed every drunkard in the Parliamentary division, changed all the beer
  and alcohol to water (Mr. Maydig had overruled Mr. Fotheringay on this
  point); they had, further, greatly improved the railway communication of the
  place, drained Flinder's swamp, improved the soil of One Tree Hill, and cured
  the Vicar's wart. And they were going to see what could be done with the
  injured pier at South Bridge. "The place," gasped Mr. Maydig, "won't be the
  same place to-morrow. How surprised and thankful everyone will be!" And just
  at that moment the church clock struck three.</p>

  <p>"I say," said Mr. Fotheringay, "that's three o'clock! I must be getting
  back. I've got to be at business by eight. And besides, Mrs.
  Wimms&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We're only beginning," said Mr. Maydig, full of the sweetness of
  unlimited power. "We're only beginning. Think of all the good we're doing.
  When people wake&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;," said Mr. Fotheringay.</p>

  <p>Mr. Maydig gripped his arm suddenly. His eyes were bright and wild. "My
  dear chap," he said, "there's no hurry. Look"&mdash;he pointed to the moon at
  the zenith&mdash;"Joshua!"</p>

  <p>"Joshua?" said Mr. Fotheringay.</p>

  <p>"Joshua," said Mr. Maydig. "Why not? Stop it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Fotheringay looked at the moon.</p>

  <p>"That's a bit tall," he said after a pause.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" said Mr. Maydig. "Of course it doesn't stop. You stop the
  rotation of the earth, you know. Time stops. It isn't as if we were doing
  harm."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said Mr. Fotheringay. "Well." He sighed. "I'll try.
  Here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He buttoned up his jacket and addressed himself to the habitable globe,
  with as good an assumption of confidence as lay in his power. "Jest stop
  rotating, will you," said Mr. Fotheringay.</p>

  <p>Incontinently he was flying head over heels through the air at the rate of
  dozens of miles a minute. In spite of the innumerable circles he was
  describing per second, he thought; for thought is wonderful&mdash;sometimes
  as sluggish as flowing pitch, sometimes as instantaneous as light. He thought
  in a second, and willed. "Let me come down safe and sound. Whatever else
  happens, let me down safe and sound."</p>

  <p>He willed it only just in time, for his clothes, heated by his rapid
  flight through the air, were already beginning to singe. He came down with a
  forcible, but by no means injurious bump in what appeared to be a mound of
  fresh-turned earth. A large mass of metal and masonry, extraordinarily like
  the clock-tower in the middle of the market-square, hit the earth near him,
  ricochetted over him, and flew into stonework, bricks, and masonry, like a
  bursting bomb. A hurtling cow hit one of the larger blocks and smashed like
  an egg. There was a crash that made all the most violent crashes of his past
  life seem like the sound of falling dust, and this was followed by a
  descending series of lesser crashes. A vast wind roared throughout earth and
  heaven' so that he could scarcely lift his head to look. For a while he was
  too breathless and astonished even to see where he was or what had happened.
  And his first movement was to feel his head and reassure himself that his
  streaming hair was still his own.</p>

  <p>"Lord!" gasped Mr. Fotheringay, scarce able to speak for the gale, "I've
  had a squeak! What's gone wrong? Storms and thunder. And only a minute ago a
  fine night. It's Maydig set me on to this sort of thing. What a wind! If I go
  on fooling in this way I'm bound to have a thundering accident...!</p>

  <p>"Where's Maydig?</p>

  <p>"What a confounded mess everything's in!"</p>

  <p>He looked about him so far as his flapping jacket would permit. The
  appearance of things was really extremely strange. "The sky's all right
  anyhow," said Mr. Fotheringay. "And that's about all that is all right. And
  even there it looks like a terrific gale coming up. But there's the moon
  overhead, just as it was just now. Bright as midday. But as for the rest
  &mdash;Where's the village? Where's&mdash;where's anything? And what on earth
  set this wind a-blowing? I didn't order no wind."</p>

  <p>Mr. Fotheringay struggled to get to his feet in vain, and after one
  failure, remained on all fours, holding on. He surveyed the moonlit world to
  leeward, with the tails of his jacket streaming over his head. "There's
  something seriously wrong," said Mr. Fotheringay. "And what it
  is&mdash;goodness knows."</p>

  <p>Far and wide nothing was visible in the white glare through the haze of
  dust that drove before a screaming gale but tumbled masses of earth and heaps
  of inchoate ruins, no trees, no houses, no familiar shapes, only a wilderness
  of disorder vanishing at last into the darkness beneath the whirling columns
  and streamers, the lightnings and thunderings of a swiftly rising storm. Near
  him in the livid glare was something that might once have been an elm-tree, a
  smashed mass of splinters, shivered from boughs to base, and further a
  twisted mass of iron girders&mdash;only too evidently the viaduct&mdash;rose
  out of the piled confusion.</p>

  <p>You see when Mr. Fotheringay had arrested the rotation of the solid globe,
  he had made no stipulation concerning the trifling movables upon its surface.
  And the earth spins so fast that the surface at its equator is travelling at
  rather more than a thousand miles an hour, and in these latitudes at more
  than half that pace. So that the village, and Mr. Maydig, and Mr.
  Fotheringay, and everybody and everything had been jerked violently forward
  at about nine miles per second&mdash;that is to say, much more violently than
  if they had been fired out of a cannon. And every human being, every living
  creature, every house, and every tree&mdash;all the world as we know it
  &mdash;had been so jerked and smashed and utterly destroyed. That was
  all.</p>

  <p>These things Mr. Fotheringay did not, of course, fully appreciate. But he
  perceived that his miracle had miscarried, and with that a great disgust of
  miracles came upon him. He was in darkness now, for the clouds had swept
  together and blotted out his momentary glimpse of the moon, and the air was
  full of fitful struggling tortured wraiths of hail. A great roaring of wind
  and waters filled earth and sky, and peering under his hand through the dust
  and sleet to windward, he saw by the play of the lightnings a vast wall of
  water pouring towards him.</p>

  <p>"Maydig!" screamed Mr. Fotheringay's feeble voice amid the elemental
  uproar. "Here!&mdash;Maydig!"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" cried Mr. Fotheringay to the advancing water. "Oh, for goodness'
  sake, stop!"</p>

  <p>"Just a moment," said Mr. Fotheringay to the lightnings and thunder. "Stop
  jest a moment while I collect my thoughts... And now what shall I do?" he
  said. "What shall I do? Lord! I wish Maydig was about."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Mr. Fotheringay. "And for goodness' sake let's have it
  right this time."</p>

  <p>He remained on all fours, leaning against the wind, very intent to have
  everything right.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said. "Let nothing what I'm going to order happen until I say
  'Off...!' Lord! I wish I'd thought of that before!"</p>

  <p>He lifted his little voice against the whirlwind, shouting louder and
  louder in the vain desire to hear himself speak. "Now then!&mdash;Here goes!
  Mind about that what I said just now. In the first place, when all I've got
  to say is done, let me lose my miraculous power, let my will become just like
  anybody else's will, and all these dangerous miracles be stopped. I don't
  like them. I'd rather, I didn't work 'em. Ever so much. That's the first
  thing. And the second is&mdash;let me be back just before the miracles begin;
  let everything be just as it was before that blessed lamp turned up. It's a
  big job, but it's the last. Have you got it? No more miracles, everything as
  it was&mdash;me back in the Long Dragon just before I drank my half-pint.
  That's it! Yes."</p>

  <p>He dug his fingers into the mould, closed his eyes, and said "Off!"</p>

  <p>Everything became perfectly still. He perceived that he was standing
  erect.</p>

  <p>"So you say," said a voice.</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes. He was in the bar of the Long Dragon, arguing about
  miracles with Toddy Beamish. He had a vague sense of some great thing
  forgotten that instantaneously passed. You see, except for the loss of his
  miraculous powers, everything was back as it had been; his mind and memory
  therefore were now just as they had been at the time when this story began.
  So that he knew absolutely nothing of all that is told here, knows nothing of
  all that is told here to this day. And among other things, of course, he
  still did not believe in miracles.</p>

  <p>"I tell you that miracles, properly speaking, can't possibly happen," he
  said, "whatever you like to hold. And I'm prepared to prove it up to the
  hilt."</p>

  <p>"That's what you think," said Toddy Beamish, and "Prove it if you
  can."</p>

  <p>"Looky here, Mr. Beamish," said Mr. Fotheringay. "Let us clearly
  understand what a miracle is. It's something contrariwise to the course of
  nature done by power of Will..."</p>

     name="story50">MISS WINCHELSEA'S HEART</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Queen</i>, October 1898</h3>

  <p>Miss Winchelsea was going to Rome. The matter had filled her mind for a
  month or more, and had overflowed so abundantly into her conversation that
  quite a number of people who were not going to Rome, and who were not likely
  to go to Rome, had made it a personal grievance against her. Some indeed had
  attempted quite unavailingly to convince her that Rome was not nearly such a
  desirable place as it was reported to be, and others had gone so far as to
  suggest behind her back that she was dreadfully "stuck up" about "that Rome
  of hers." And little Lily Hardhurst had told her friend Mr. Binns that so far
  as she was concerned Miss Winchelsea might "go to her old Rome and stop
  there; <i>she</i> (Miss Lily Hardhurst) wouldn't grieve." And the way in
  which Miss Winchelsea put herself upon terms of personal tenderness with
  Horace and Benvenuto Cellini and Raphael and Shelley and Keats&mdash;if she
  had been Shelley's widow she could not have professed a keener interest in
  his grave&mdash;was a matter of universal astonishment. Her dress was a
  triumph of tactful discretion, sensible, but not too "touristy"&mdash;Miss
  Winchelsea, had a great dread of being "touristy"&mdash;and her Baedeker was
  carried in a cover of grey to hide its glaring red. She made a prim and
  pleasant little figure on the Charing Cross platform, in spite of her
  swelling pride, when at last the great day dawned, and she could start for
  Rome. The day was bright, the Channel passage would be pleasant, and all the
  omens promised well. There was the gayest sense of adventure in this
  unprecedented departure.</p>

  <p>She was going with two friends who had been fellow-students with her at
  the training college, nice honest girls both, though not so good at history
  and literature as Miss Winchelsea. They both looked up to her immensely,
  though physically they had to look down, and she anticipated some pleasant
  times to be spent in "stirring them up" to her own pitch of aesthetic and
  historical enthusiasm. They had secured seats already, and welcomed her
  effusively at the carriage door. In the instant criticism of the encounter
  she noted that Fanny had a slightly "touristy" leather strap, and that Helen
  had succumbed to a serge jacket with side pockets, into which her hands were
  thrust. But they were much too happy with themselves and the expedition for
  their friend to attempt any hint at the moment about these things. As soon as
  the first ecstasies were over&mdash;Fanny's enthusiasm was a little noisy and
  crude, and consisted mainly in emphatic repetitions of "Just <i>fancy</i>!
  we're going to Rome, my dear!&mdash;Rome!"&mdash;they gave their attention to
  their fellow-travellers. Helen was anxious to secure a compartment to
  themselves, and, in order to discourage intruders, got out and planted
  herself firmly on the step. Miss Winchelsea peeped out over her shoulder, and
  made sly little remarks about the accumulating people on the platform, at
  which Fanny laughed gleefully.</p>

  <p>They were travelling with one of Mr. Thomas Gunn's parties&mdash;fourteen
  days in Rome for fourteen pounds. They did not belong to the personally
  conducted party of course&mdash;Miss Winchelsea had seen to that&mdash;but
  they travelled with it because of the convenience of that arrangement. The
  people were the oddest mixture, and wonderfully amusing. There was a
  vociferous red-faced polyglot personal conductor in a pepper-and-salt suit,
  very long in the arms and legs and very active. He shouted proclamations.
  When he wanted to speak to people he stretched out an arm and held them until
  his purpose was accomplished. One hand was full of papers, tickets,
  counterfoils of tourists. The people of the personally conducted party were,
  it seemed, of two sorts; people the conductor wanted and could not find, and
  people he did not want and who followed him in a steadily growing tail up and
  down the platform. These people seemed, indeed, to think that their one
  chance of reaching Rome lay in keeping close to him. Three little old ladies
  were particularly energetic in his pursuit, and at last maddened him to the
  pitch of clapping them into a carriage and daring them to emerge again. For
  the rest of the time, one, two, or three of their heads protruded from the
  window wailing enquiries about "a little wickerwork box" whenever he drew
  near. There was a very stout man with a very stout wife in shiny black; there
  was a little old man like an aged hostler.</p>

  <p>"What <i>can</i> such people want in Rome?" asked Miss Winchelsea. "What
  can it mean to them?" There was a very tall curate in a very small straw hat,
  and a very short curate encumbered by a long camera stand. The contrast
  amused Fanny very much. Once they heard some one calling for "Snooks." "I
  always thought that name was invented by novelists," said Miss Winchelsea.
  "Fancy! Snooks. I wonder which <i>is</i> Mr. Snooks." Finally they picked out
  a very stout and resolute little man in a large check suit. "If he isn't
  Snooks, he ought to be," said Miss Winchelsea.</p>

  <p>Presently the conductor discovered Helen's attempt at a corner in
  carriages. "Room for five," he bawled with a parallel translation on his
  fingers. A party of four together&mdash;mother, father, and two daughters
  &mdash;blundered in, all greatly excited. "It's all right, Ma, you let me,"
  said one of the daughters, hitting her mother's bonnet with a handbag she
  struggled to put in the rack. Miss Winchelsea detested people who banged
  about and called their mother "Ma." A young man travelling alone followed. He
  was not at all "touristy" in his costume, Miss Winchelsea observed; his
  Gladstone bag was of good pleasant leather with labels reminiscent of
  Luxembourg and Ostend, and his boots, though brown, were not vulgar. He
  carried an overcoat on his arm. Before these people had properly settled in
  their places, came an inspection of tickets and a slamming of doors, and
  behold! they were gliding out of Charing Cross station on their way to
  Rome.</p>

  <p>"Fancy!" cried Fanny, "we are going to Rome, my dear! Rome! I don't seem
  to believe it, even now."</p>

  <p>Miss Winchelsea suppressed Fanny's emotions with a little smile, and the
  lady who was called "Ma" explained to people in general why they had "cut it
  so close" at the station. The two daughters called her "Ma" several times,
  toned her down in a tactless effective way, and drove her at last to the
  muttered inventory of a basket of travelling requisites. Presently she looked
  up. "Lor'!" she said, "I didn't bring <i>them</i>!" Both the daughters said
  "Oh, Ma!" but what "them" was did not appear. Presently Fanny produced Hare's
  Walks in Rome, a sort of mitigated guide-book very popular among Roman
  visitors; and the father of the two daughters began to examine his books of
  tickets minutely, apparently in a search after English words. When he had
  looked at the tickets for a long time right way up, he turned them upside
  down. Then he produced a fountain pen and dated them with considerable care.
  The young man, having completed an unostentatious survey of his fellow
  travellers, produced a book and fell to reading. When Helen and Fanny were
  looking out of the window at Chiselhurst&mdash;the place interested Fanny
  because the poor dear Empress of the French used to live there&mdash;Miss
  Winchelsea took the opportunity to observe the book the young man held. It
  was not a guide-book, but a little thin volume of poetry&mdash;<i>bound</i>.
  She glanced at his face&mdash;it seemed a refined pleasant face to her hasty
  glance. He wore a little gilt pince-nez. "Do you think she lives there now?"
  said Fanny, and Miss Winchelsea's inspection came to an end.</p>

  <p>For the rest of the journey Miss Winchelsea talked little, and what she
  said was as pleasant and as stamped with refinement as she could make it. Her
  voice was always low and clear and pleasant, and she took care that on this
  occasion it was particularly low and clear and pleasant. As they came under
  the white cliffs the young man put his book of poetry away, and when at last
  the train stopped beside the boat, he displayed a graceful alacrity with the
  impedimenta of Miss Winchelsea and her friends. Miss Winchelsea hated
  nonsense, but she was pleased to see the young man perceived at once that
  they were ladies, and helped them without any violent geniality; and how
  nicely he showed that his civilities were to be no excuse for further
  intrusions. None of her little party had been out of England before, and they
  were all excited and a little nervous at the Channel passage. They stood in a
  little group in a good place near the middle of the boat&mdash;the young man
  had taken Miss Winchelsea's carry-all there and had told her it was a good
  place&mdash;and they watched the white shores of Albion recede and quoted
  Shakespeare and made quiet fun of their fellow travellers in the English
  way.</p>

  <p>They were particularly amused at the precautions the bigger-sized people
  had taken against the little waves&mdash;cut lemons and flasks prevailed, one
  lady lay full-length in a deck chair with a handkerchief over her face, and a
  very broad resolute man in a bright brown "touristy" suit walked all the way
  from England to France along the deck, with his legs as widely apart as
  Providence permitted. These were all excellent precautions, and, nobody was
  ill. The personally conducted party pursued the conductor about the deck with
  enquiries in a manner that suggested to Helen's mind the rather vulgar image
  of hens with a piece of bacon peel, until at last he went into hiding below.
  And the young man with the thin volume of poetry stood at the stern watching
  England receding, looking rather lonely and sad to Miss Winchelsea's eye.</p>

  <p>And then came Calais and tumultuous novelties, and the young man had not
  forgotten Miss Winchelsea's hold-all and the other little things. All three
  girls, though they had passed government examinations in French to any
  extent, were stricken with a dumb shame of their accents, and the young man
  was very useful. And he did not intrude. He put them in a comfortable
  carriage and raised his hat and went away. Miss Winchelsea thanked him in her
  best manner&mdash;a pleasing, cultivated manner&mdash;and Fanny said he was
  "nice" almost before he was out of earshot. "I wonder what he can be," said
  Helen. "He's going to Italy, because I noticed green tickets in his book."
  Miss Winchelsea almost told them of the poetry, and decided not to do so. And
  presently the carriage windows seized hold upon them and the young man was
  forgotten. It made them feel that they were doing an educated sort of thing
  to travel through a country whose commonest advertisements were in idiomatic
  French, and Miss Winchelsea made unpatriotic comparisons because there were
  weedy little sign-board advertisements by the rail side instead of the broad
  hoardings that deface the landscape in our land. But the north of France is
  really uninteresting country, and after a time Fanny reverted to Hare's Walks
  and Helen initiated lunch. Miss Winchelsea awoke out of a happy reverie; she
  had been trying to realise, she said, that she was actually going to Rome,
  but she perceived at Helen's suggestion that she was hungry, and they lunched
  out of their baskets very cheerfully. In the afternoon they were tired and
  silent until Helen made tea. Miss Winchelsea might have dozed, only she knew
  Fanny slept with her mouth open; and as their fellow passengers were two
  rather nice critical-looking ladies of uncertain age&mdash;who knew French
  well enough to talk it&mdash;she employed herself in keeping Fanny awake. The
  rhythm of the train became insistent, and the streaming landscape outside
  became at last quite painful to the eye. They were already dreadfully tired
  of travelling before their night's stoppage came.</p>

  <p>The stoppage for the night was brightened by the appearance of the young
  man, and his manners were all that could be desired and his French quite
  serviceable. His coupons availed for the same hotel as theirs, and by chance
  as it seemed he sat next Miss Winchelsea at the table d'hote. In spite of her
  enthusiasm for Rome, she had thought out some such possibility very
  thoroughly, and when he ventured to make a remark upon the tediousness of
  travelling&mdash;he let the soup and fish go by before he did this&mdash;she
  did not simply assent to his proposition, but responded with another. They
  were soon comparing their journeys, and Helen and Fanny were cruelly
  overlooked in the conversation. It was to be the same journey, they found;
  one day for the galleries at Florence&mdash;"from what I hear," said the
  young man, "it is barely enough,"&mdash;and the rest at Rome. He talked of
  Rome very pleasantly; he was evidently quite well read, and he quoted Horace
  about Soracte. Miss Winchelsea had "done" that book of Horace for her
  matriculation, and was delighted to cap his quotation. It gave a sort of tone
  to things, this incident&mdash;a touch of refinement to mere chatting. Fanny
  expressed a few emotions, and Helen interpolated a few sensible remarks, but
  the bulk of the talk on the girls' side naturally fell to Miss
  Winchelsea.</p>

  <p>Before they reached Rome this young man was tacitly of their party. They
  did not know his name nor what he was, but it seemed he taught, and Miss
  Winchelsea had a shrewd idea he was an extension lecturer. At any rate he was
  something of that sort, something gentlemanly and refined without being
  opulent and impossible. She tried once or twice to ascertain whether he came
  from Oxford or Cambridge, but he missed her timid importunities. She tried to
  get him to make remarks about those places to see if he would say "come up"
  to them instead of "go down"&mdash;she knew that was how you told a 'Varsity
  man. He used the word "'Varsity"&mdash;not university&mdash;in quite the
  proper way.</p>

  <p>They saw as much of Mr. Ruskin's Florence as the brief time permitted; he
  met them in the Pitti Gallery and went round with them, chatting brightly,
  and evidently very grateful for their recognition. He knew a great deal about
  art, and all four enjoyed the morning immensely. It was fine to go round
  recognising old favourites and finding new beauties, especially while so many
  people fumbled helplessly with Baedeker. Nor was he a bit of a prig, Miss
  Winchelsea said, and indeed she detested prigs. He had a distinct undertone
  of humour, and was funny, for example, without being vulgar, at the expense
  of the quaint work of Beato Angelico. He had a grave seriousness beneath it
  all, and was quick to seize the moral lessons of the pictures. Fanny went
  softly among these masterpieces; she admitted "she knew so little about
  them," and she confessed that to her they were "all beautiful." Fanny's
  "beautiful" inclined to be a little monotonous, Miss Winchelsea thought. She
  had been quite glad when the last sunny Alp had vanished, because of the
  staccato of Fanny's admiration. Helen said little, but Miss Winchelsea had
  found her a little wanting on the aesthetic side in the old days and was not
  surprised; sometimes she laughed at the young man's hesitating delicate
  little jests and sometimes she didn't, and sometimes she seemed quite lost to
  the art about them in the contemplation of the dresses of the other
  visitors.</p>

  <p>At Rome the young man was with them intermittently. A rather "touristy"
  friend of his took him away at times. He complained comically to Miss
  Winchelsea. "I have only two short weeks in Rome," he said, "and my friend
  Leonard wants to spend a whole day at Tivoli, looking at a waterfall."</p>

  <p>"What is your friend Leonard?" asked Miss Winchelsea abruptly.</p>

  <p>"He's the most enthusiastic pedestrian I ever met," the young man replied,
  amusingly, but a little unsatisfactorily, Miss Winchelsea thought. They had
  some glorious times, and Fanny could not think what they would have done
  without him. Miss Winchelsea's interest and Fanny's enormous capacity for
  admiration were insatiable. They never flagged&mdash;through pictures and
  sculpture galleries, immense crowded churches, ruins and museums, Judas trees
  and prickly pears, wine carts and palaces, they admired their way
  unflinchingly. They never saw a stone pine or a eucalyptus but they named and
  admired it; they never glimpsed Soracte but they exclaimed. Their common ways
  were made wonderful by imaginative play. "Here Caesar may have walked," they
  would say. "Raphael may have seen Soracte from this very point." They
  happened on the tomb of Bibulus. "Old Bibulus," said the young man. "The
  oldest monument of Republican Rome!" said Miss Winchelsea.</p>

  <p>"I'm dreadfully stupid," said Fanny, "but who WAS Bibulus?"</p>

  <p>There was a curious little pause.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't he the person who built the wall?" said Helen.</p>

  <p>The young man glanced quickly at her and laughed. "That was Balbus," he
  said. Helen reddened, but neither he nor Miss Winchelsea threw any light upon
  Fanny's ignorance about Bibulus.</p>

  <p>Helen was more taciturn than the other three, but then she was always
  taciturn, and usually she took care of the tram tickets and things like that,
  or kept her eye on them if the young man took them, and told him where they
  were when he wanted them. Glorious times they had, these young people, in
  that pale brown cleanly city of memories that was once the world. Their only
  sorrow was the shortness of the time. They said indeed that the electric
  trams and the '70 buildings, and that criminal advertisement that glares upon
  the Forum, outraged their aesthetic feelings unspeakably; but that was only
  part of the fun. And indeed Rome is such a wonderful place that it made Miss
  Winchelsea forget some of her most carefully prepared enthusiasms at times,
  and Helen, taken unawares, would suddenly admit the beauty of unexpected
  things. Yet Fanny and Helen would have liked a shop window or so in the
  English quarter if Miss Winchelsea's uncompromising hostility to all other
  English visitors had not rendered that district impossible.</p>

  <p>The intellectual and aesthetic fellowship of Miss Winchelsea and the
  scholarly young man passed insensibly towards a deeper feeling. The exuberant
  Fanny did her best to keep pace with their recondite admiration by playing
  her "beautiful," with vigour, and saying "Oh! <i>let's</i> go," with enormous
  appetite whenever a new place of interest was mentioned. But Helen developed
  a certain want of sympathy towards the end, that disappointed Miss Winchelsea
  a little. She refused to "see anything" in the face of Beatrice
  Cenci&mdash;Shelley's Beatrice Cenci!&mdash;in the Barberini gallery; and one
  day, when they were deploring the electric trams, she said rather snappishly
  that "people must get about somehow, and it's better than torturing horses up
  these horrid little hills." She spoke of the Seven Hills of Rome as "horrid
  little hills!"</p>

  <p>And the day they went on the Palatine&mdash;though Miss Winchelsea did not
  know of this&mdash;she remarked suddenly to Fanny, "Don't hurry like that, my
  dear; <i>they</i> don't want us to overtake them. And we don't say the right
  things for them when we <i>do</i> get near."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't trying to overtake them," said Fanny, slackening her excessive
  pace; "I wasn't indeed." And for a minute she was short of breath.</p>

  <p>But Miss Winchelsea had come upon happiness. It was only when she came to
  look back across an intervening tragedy that she quite realised how happy she
  had been, pacing among the cypress-shadowed ruins, and exchanging the very
  highest class of information the human mind can possess, the most refined
  impressions it is possible to convey. Insensibly emotion crept into their
  intercourse, sunning itself openly and pleasantly at last when Helen's
  modernity was not too near. Insensibly their interest drifted from the
  wonderful associations about them to their more intimate and personal
  feelings. In a tentative way information was supplied; she spoke allusively
  of her school, of her examination successes, of her gladness that the days of
  "Cram" were over. He made it quite clear that he also was a teacher. They
  spoke of the greatness of their calling, of the necessity of sympathy to face
  its irksome details, of a certain loneliness they sometimes felt.</p>

  <p>That was in the Colosseum, and it was as far as they got that day, because
  Helen returned with Fanny&mdash;she had taken her into the upper galleries.
  Yet the private dreams of Miss Winchelsea, already vivid and concrete enough,
  became now realistic in the highest degree. She figured that pleasant young
  man, lecturing in the most edifying way to his students, herself modestly
  prominent as his intellectual mate and helper; she figured a refined little
  home, with two bureaus, with white shelves of high-class books, and autotypes
  of the pictures of Rossetti and Burne-Jones, with Morris's wall papers and
  flowers in pots of beaten copper. Indeed she figured many things. On the
  Pincio the two had a few precious moments together, while Helen marched Fanny
  off to see the muro Torto, and he spoke at once plainly. He said he hoped
  their friendship was only beginning, that he already found her company very
  precious to him, that indeed it was more than that.</p>

  <p>He became nervous, thrusting at his glasses with trembling fingers as
  though he fancied his emotions made them unstable. "I should of course," he
  said, "tell you things about myself. I know it is rather unusual my speaking
  to you like this. Only our meeting has been so accidental&mdash;or
  providential&mdash;and I am snatching at things. I came to Rome expecting a
  lonely tour...and I have been so very happy, so very happy. Quite recently I
  found myself in a position&mdash;I have dared to think&mdash;.
  And&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He glanced over his shoulder and stopped. He said "Damn!" quite
  distinctly&mdash;and she did not condemn him for that manly lapse into
  profanity. She looked and saw his friend Leonard advancing. He drew nearer;
  he raised his hat to Miss Winchelsea, and his smile was almost a grin. "I've
  been looking for you everywhere, Snooks," he said. "You promised to be on the
  Piazza steps half an hour ago."</p>

  <p>Snooks! The name struck Miss Winchelsea like a blow in the face. She did
  not hear his reply. She thought afterwards that Leonard must have considered
  her the vaguest-minded person. To this day she is not sure whether she was
  introduced to Leonard or not, nor what she said to him. A sort of mental
  paralysis was upon her. Of all offensive surnames&mdash;Snooks!</p>

  <p>Helen and Fanny were returning, there were civilities, and the young men
  were receding. By a great effort she controlled herself to face the enquiring
  eyes of her friends. All that afternoon she lived the life of a heroine under
  the indescribable outrage of that name, chatting, observing, with "Snooks"
  gnawing at her heart. From the moment that it first rang upon her ears, the
  dream of her happiness was prostrate in the dust. All the refinement she had
  figured was ruined and defaced by that cognomen's unavoidable vulgarity.</p>

  <p>What was that refined little home to her now, spite of autotypes, Morris
  papers, and bureaus? Athwart it in letters of fire ran an incredible
  inscription: "Mrs. Snooks." That may seem a little thing to the reader, but
  consider the delicate refinement of Miss Winchelsea's mind. Be as refined as
  you can and then think of writing yourself down:&mdash;"Snooks." She
  conceived herself being addressed as Mrs. Snooks by all the people she liked
  least, conceived the patronymic touched with a vague quality of insult. She
  figured a card of grey and silver bearing "Winchelsea," triumphantly effaced
  by an arrow, Cupid's arrow, in favour of "Snooks." Degrading confession of
  feminine weakness! She imagined the terrible rejoicings of certain girl
  friends, of certain grocer cousins from whom her growing refinement had long
  since estranged her. How they would make it sprawl across the envelope that
  would bring their sarcastic congratulations. Would even his pleasant company
  compensate her for that? "It is impossible," she muttered; "impossible!
  <i>Snooks</i>!"</p>

  <p>She was sorry for him, but not so sorry as she was for herself. For him
  she had a touch of indignation. To be so nice, so refined, while all the time
  he was "Snooks," to hide under a pretentious gentility of demeanour the badge
  sinister of his surname seemed a sort of treachery. To put it in the language
  of sentimental science she felt he had "led her on."</p>

  <p>There were of course moments of terrible vacillation, a period even when
  something almost like passion bid her throw refinement to the winds. And
  there was something in her, an unexpurgated vestige of vulgarity, that made a
  strenuous attempt at proving that Snooks was not so very bad a name after
  all. Any hovering hesitation flew before Fanny's manner, when Fanny came with
  an air of catastrophe to tell that she also knew the horror. Fanny's voice
  fell to a whisper when she said <i>Snooks</i>. Miss Winchelsea would not give
  him any answer when at last, in the Borghese, she could have a minute with
  him; but she promised him a note.</p>

  <p>She handed him that note in the little book of poetry he had lent her, the
  little book that had first drawn them together. Her refusal was ambiguous,
  allusive. She could no more tell him why she rejected him than she could have
  told a cripple of his hump. He too must feel something of the unspeakable
  quality of his name. Indeed he had avoided a dozen chances of telling it, she
  now perceived. So she spoke of "obstacles she could not
  reveal"&mdash;"reasons why the thing he spoke of was impossible." She
  addressed the note with a shiver, "E.K. Snooks."</p>

  <p>Things were worse than she had dreaded; he asked her to explain. How
  <i>could</i> she explain? Those last two days in Rome were dreadful. She was
  haunted by his air of astonished perplexity. She knew she had given him
  intimate hopes, she had not the courage to examine her mind thoroughly for
  the extent of her encouragement. She knew he must think her the most
  changeable of beings. Now that she was in full retreat, she would not even
  perceive his hints of a possible correspondence. But in that matter he did a
  thing that seemed to her at once delicate and romantic. He made a go-between
  of Fanny. Fanny could not keep the secret, and came and told her that night
  under a transparent pretext of needed advice. "Mr. Snooks," said Fanny,
  "wants to write to me. Fancy! I had no idea. But should I let him?" They
  talked it over long and earnestly, and Miss Winchelsea was careful to keep
  the veil over her heart. She was already repenting his disregarded hints. Why
  should she not hear of him sometimes&mdash;painful though his name must be to
  her? Miss Winchelsea decided it might be permitted, and Fanny kissed her
  good-night with unusual emotion. After she had gone Miss Winchelsea sat for a
  long time at the window of her little room. It was moonlight, and down the
  street a man sang "Santa Lucia" with almost heart-dissolving tenderness...
  She sat very still.</p>

  <p>She breathed a word very softly to herself. The word was <i>"Snooks."</i>
  Then she got up with a profound sigh, and went to bed. The next morning he
  said to her meaningly, "I shall hear of you through your friend."</p>

  <p>Mr. Snooks saw them off from Rome with that pathetic interrogative
  perplexity still on his face, and if it had not been for Helen he would have
  retained Miss Winchelsea's hold-all in his hand as a sort of encyclopaedic
  keepsake. On their way back to England Miss Winchelsea on six separate
  occasions made Fanny promise to write to her the longest of long letters.
  Fanny, it seemed, would be quite near Mr. Snooks. Her new school&mdash;she
  was always going to new schools&mdash;would be only five miles from Steely
  Bank, and it was in the Steely Bank Polytechnic, and one or two first-class
  schools, that Mr. Snooks did his teaching. He might even see her at times.
  They could not talk much of him&mdash;she and Fanny always spoke of "him,"
  never of Mr. Snooks,&mdash;because Helen was apt to say unsympathetic things
  about him. Her nature had coarsened very much, Miss Winchelsea perceived,
  since the old Training College days; she had become hard and cynical. She
  thought he had a weak face, mistaking refinement for weakness as people of
  her stamp are apt to do, and when she heard his name was Snooks, she said she
  had expected something of the sort. Miss Winchelsea was careful to spare her
  own feelings after that, but Fanny was less circumspect.</p>

  <p>The girls parted in London, and Miss Winchelsea returned, with a new
  interest in life, to the Girls' High School in which she had been an
  increasingly valuable assistant for the last three years. Her new interest in
  life was Fanny as a correspondent, and to give her a lead she wrote her a
  lengthy descriptive letter within a fortnight of her return. Fanny answered,
  very disappointingly. Fanny indeed had no literary gift, but it was new to
  Miss Winchelsea to find herself deploring the want of gifts in a friend. That
  letter was even criticised aloud in the safe solitude of Miss Winchelsea's
  study, and her criticism, spoken with great bitterness, was "Twaddle!" It was
  full of just the things Miss Winchelsea's letter had been full of,
  particulars of the school. And of Mr. Snooks, only this much: "I have had a
  letter from Mr. Snooks, and he has been over to see me on two Saturday
  afternoons running. He talked about Rome and you; we both talked about you.
  Your ears must have burnt, my dear..."</p>

  <p>Miss Winchelsea repressed a desire to demand more explicit information,
  and wrote the sweetest long letter again. "Tell me all about yourself, dear.
  That journey has quite refreshed our ancient friendship, and I do so want to
  keep in touch with you." About Mr. Snooks she simply wrote on the fifth page
  that she was glad Fanny had seen him, and that if he <i>should</i> ask after
  her, she was to be remembered to him <i><u>very kindly</u></i> (underlined).
  And Fanny replied most obtusely in the key of that "ancient friendship,"
  reminding Miss Winchelsea of a dozen foolish things of those old schoolgirl
  days at the training college, and saying not a word about Mr. Snooks!</p>

  <p>For nearly a week Miss Winchelsea was so angry at the failure of Fanny as
  a go-between that she could not write to her. And then she wrote less
  effusively, and in her letter she asked point-blank, "Have you seen Mr.
  Snooks?" Fanny's letter was unexpectedly satisfactory. "I HAVE seen Mr.
  Snooks," she wrote, and having once named him she kept on about him; it was
  all Snooks&mdash;Snooks this and Snooks that. He was to give a public
  lecture, said Fanny, among other things. Yet Miss Winchelsea, after the first
  glow of gratification, still found this letter a little unsatisfactory. Fanny
  did not report Mr. Snooks as saying anything about Miss Winchelsea, nor as
  looking a little white and worn, as he ought to have been doing. And behold!
  before she had replied, came a second letter from Fanny on the same theme,
  quite a gushing letter, and covering six sheets with her loose feminine
  hand.</p>

  <p>And about this second letter was a rather odd little thing that Miss
  Winchelsea only noticed as she re-read it the third time. Fanny's natural
  femininity had prevailed even against the round and clear traditions of the
  training college; she was one of those she-creatures born to make all her m's
  and n's and u's and r's and e's alike, and to leave her o's and a's open and
  her i's undotted. So that it was only after an elaborate comparison of word
  with word that Miss Winchelsea felt assured Mr. Snooks was not really "Mr.
  Snooks" at all! In Fanny's first letter of gush he was Mr. "Snooks," in her
  second the spelling was changed to Mr. "Senoks." Miss Winchelsea's hand
  positively trembled as she turned the sheet over&mdash;it meant so much to
  her. For it had already begun to seem to her that even the name of Mrs.
  Snooks might be avoided at too great a price, and suddenly&mdash;this
  possibility! She turned over the six sheets, all dappled with that critical
  name, and everywhere the first letter had the form of an E! For a time she
  walked the room with a hand pressed upon her heart.</p>

  <p>She spent a whole day pondering this change, weighing a letter of inquiry
  that should be at once discreet and effectual, weighing too what action she
  should take after the answer came. She was resolved that if this altered
  spelling was anything more than a quaint fancy of Fanny's, she would write
  forthwith to Mr. Snooks. She had now reached a stage when the minor
  refinements of behaviour disappear. Her excuse remained uninvented, but she
  had the subject of her letter clear in her mind, even to the hint that
  "circumstances in my life have changed very greatly since we talked
  together." But she never gave that hint. There came a third letter from that
  fitful correspondent Fanny. The first line proclaimed her "the happiest girl
  alive."</p>

  <p>Miss Winchelsea crushed the letter in her hand&mdash;the rest unread
  &mdash;and sat with her face suddenly very still. She had received it just
  before morning school, and had opened it when the junior mathematicians were
  well under way. Presently she resumed reading with an appearance of great
  calm. But after the first sheet she went on reading the third without
  discovering the error:&mdash;"told him frankly I did not like his name," the
  third sheet began. "He told me he did not like it himself&mdash;you know that
  sort of sudden frank way he has"&mdash;Miss Winchelsea did know. "So I said
  'Couldn't you change it?' He didn't see it at first. Well, you know, dear, he
  had told me what it really meant; it means Sevenoaks, only it has got down to
  Snooks&mdash;both Snooks and Noaks, dreadfully vulgar surnames though they
  be, are really worn forms of Sevenoaks. So I said&mdash;even I have my bright
  ideas at times&mdash;'if it got down from Sevenoaks to Snooks, why not get it
  back from Snooks to Sevenoaks?' And the long and the short of it is, dear, he
  couldn't refuse me, and he changed his spelling there and then to Senoks for
  the bills of the new lecture. And afterwards, when we are married, we shall
  put in the apostrophe and make it Se'noks. Wasn't it kind of him to mind that
  fancy of mine, when many men would have taken offence? But it is just like
  him all over; he is as kind as he is clever. Because he knew as well as I did
  that I would have had him in spite of it, had he been ten times Snooks. But
  he did it all the same."</p>

  <p>The class was startled by the sound of paper being viciously torn, and
  looked up to see Miss Winchelsea white in the face, and with some very small
  pieces of paper clenched in one hand. For a few seconds they stared at her
  stare, and then her expression changed back to a more familiar one. "Has any
  one finished number three?" she asked in an even tone. She remained calm
  after that. But impositions ruled high that day. And she spent two laborious
  evenings writing letters of various sorts to Fanny, before she found a decent
  congratulatory vein. Her reason struggled hopelessly against the persuasion
  that Fanny had behaved in an exceedingly treacherous manner.</p>

  <p>One may be extremely refined and still capable of a very sore heart.
  Certainly Miss Winchelsea's heart was very sore. She had moods of sexual
  hostility, in which she generalised uncharitably about mankind. "He forgot
  himself with me," she said. "But Fanny is pink and pretty and soft and a fool
  &mdash;a very excellent match for a Man." And by way of a wedding present she
  sent Fanny a gracefully bound volume of poetry by George Meredith, and Fanny
  wrote back a grossly happy letter to say that it was "<i>all</i> beautiful."
  Miss Winchelsea hoped that some day Mr. Senoks might take up that slim book
  and think for a moment of the donor. Fanny wrote several times before and
  about her marriage, pursuing that fond legend of their "ancient friendship,"
  and giving her happiness in the fullest detail. And Miss Winchelsea wrote to
  Helen for the first time after the Roman journey, saying nothing about the
  marriage, but expressing very cordial feelings.</p>

  <p>They had been in Rome at Easter, and Fanny was married in the August
  vacation. She wrote a garrulous letter to Miss Winchelsea, describing her
  home-coming, and the astonishing arrangements of their "teeny weeny" little
  house. Mr. Se'noks was now beginning to assume a refinement in Miss
  Winchelsea's memory out of all proportion to the facts of the case, and she
  tried in vain to imagine his cultured greatness in a "teeny weeny" little
  house. "Am busy enamelling a cosey corner," said Fanny, sprawling to the end
  of her third sheet, "so excuse more." Miss Winchelsea answered in her best
  style, gently poking fun at Fanny's arrangements and hoping intensely that
  Mr. Sen'oks might see the letter. Only this hope enabled her to write at all,
  answering not only that letter but one in November and one at Christmas.</p>

  <p>The two latter communications contained urgent invitations for her to come
  to Steely Bank on a Visit during the Christmas holidays. She tried to think
  that HE had told her to ask that, but it was too much like Fanny's opulent
  good-nature. She could not but believe that he must be sick of his blunder by
  this time; and she had more than a hope that he would presently write her a
  letter beginning "Dear Friend." Something subtly tragic in the separation was
  a great support to her, a sad misunderstanding. To have been jilted would
  have been intolerable. But he never wrote that letter beginning "Dear
  Friend."</p>

  <p>For two years Miss Winchelsea could not go to see her friends, in spite of
  the reiterated invitations of Mrs. Sevenoaks&mdash;it became full Sevenoaks
  in the second year. Then one day near the Easter rest she felt lonely and
  without a soul to understand her in the world, and her mind ran once more on
  what is called Platonic friendship. Fanny was clearly happy and busy in her
  new sphere of domesticity, but no doubt HE had his lonely hours. Did he ever
  think of those days in Rome&mdash;gone now beyond recalling? No one had
  understood her as he had done; no one in all the world. It would be a sort of
  melancholy pleasure to talk to him again, and what harm could it do? Why
  should she deny herself? That night she wrote a sonnet, all but the last two
  lines of the octave&mdash;which would not come, and the next day she composed
  a graceful little note to tell Fanny she was coming down.</p>

  <p>And so she saw him again.</p>

  <p>Even at the first encounter it was evident he had changed; he seemed
  stouter and less nervous, and it speedily appeared that his conversation had
  already lost much of its old delicacy. There even seemed a justification for
  Helen's description of weakness in his face&mdash;in certain lights it
  <i>was</i> weak. He seemed busy and preoccupied about his affairs, and almost
  under the impression that Miss Winchelsea had come for the sake of Fanny. He
  discussed his dinner with Fanny in an intelligent way. They only had one good
  long talk together, and that came to nothing. He did not refer to Rome, and
  spent some time abusing a man who had stolen an idea he had had for a text-
  book. It did not seem a very wonderful idea to Miss Winchelsea. She
  discovered he had forgotten the names of more than half the painters whose
  work they had rejoiced over in Florence.</p>

  <p>It was a sadly disappointing week, and Miss Winchelsea was glad when it
  came to an end. Under various excuses she avoided visiting them again. After
  a time the visitor's room was occupied by their two little boys, and Fanny's
  invitations ceased. The intimacy of her letters had long since faded
  away.</p>

     name="story51">MR. LEDBETTER'S VACATION</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, October 1898</h3>

  <p>My friend, Mr. Ledbetter, is a round-faced little man, whose natural
  mildness of eye is gigantically exaggerated when you catch the beam through
  his glasses, and whose deep, deliberate voice irritates irritable people. A
  certain elaborate clearness of enunciation has come with him to his present
  vicarage from his scholastic days, an elaborate clearness of enunciation and
  a certain nervous determination to be firm and correct upon all issues,
  important and unimportant alike. He is a sacerdotalist and a chess player,
  and suspected by many of the secret practice of the higher
  mathematics&mdash;creditable rather than interesting things. His conversation
  is copious and given much to needless detail. By many, indeed, his
  intercourse is condemned, to put it plainly, as "boring," and such have even
  done me the compliment to wonder why I countenance him. But, on the other
  hand, there is a large faction who marvel at his countenancing such a
  dishevelled, discreditable acquaintance as myself. Few appear to regard our
  friendship with equanimity. But that is because they do not know of the link
  that binds us, of my amiable connection via Jamaica with Mr. Ledbetter's
  past.</p>

  <p>About that past he displays an anxious modesty. "I do not <i>know</i> what
  I should do if it became known," he says; and repeats, impressively, "I do
  not know <i>what</i> I should do." As a matter of fact, I doubt if he would
  do anything except get very red about the ears. But that will appear later;
  nor will I tell here of our first encounter, since, as a general
  rule&mdash;though I am prone to break it&mdash;the end of a story should come
  after, rather than before, the beginning. And the beginning of the story goes
  a long way back; indeed, it is now nearly twenty years since Fate, by a
  series of complicated and startling manoeuvres, brought Mr. Ledbetter, so to
  speak, into my hands.</p>

  <p>In those days I was living in Jamaica, and Mr. Ledbetter was a
  schoolmaster in England. He was in orders, and already recognisably the same
  man that he is to-day: the same rotundity of visage, the same or similar
  glasses, and the same faint shadow of surprise in his resting expression. He
  was, of course, dishevelled when I saw him, and his collar less of a collar
  than a wet bandage, and that may have helped to bridge the natural gulf
  between us&mdash;but of that, as I say, later.</p>

  <p>The business began at Hithergate-on-Sea, and simultaneously with Mr.
  Ledbetter's summer vacation. Thither he came for a greatly needed rest, with
  a bright brown portmanteau marked "F. W. L.", a new white-and-black straw
  hat, and two pairs of white flannel trousers. He was naturally exhilarated at
  his release from school&mdash;for he was not very fond of the boys he taught.
  After dinner he fell into a discussion with a talkative person established in
  the boarding-house to which, acting on the advice of his aunt, he had
  resorted. This talkative person was the only other man in the house. Their
  discussion concerned the melancholy disappearance of wonder and adventure in
  these latter days, the prevalence of globe-trotting, the abolition of
  distance by steam and electricity, the vulgarity of advertisement, the
  degradation of men by civilisation, and many such things. Particularly was
  the talkative person eloquent on the decay of human courage through security,
  a security Mr. Ledbetter rather thoughtlessly joined him in deploring. Mr.
  Ledbetter, in the first delight of emancipation from "duty," and being
  anxious, perhaps, to establish a reputation for manly conviviality, partook,
  rather more freely than was advisable, of the excellent whisky the talkative
  person produced. But he did not become intoxicated, he insists.</p>

  <p>He was simply eloquent beyond his sober wont, and with the finer edge gone
  from his judgment. And after that long talk of the brave old days that were
  past forever, he went out into moonlit Hithergate&mdash;alone and up the
  cliff road where the villas cluster together.</p>

  <p>He had bewailed, and now as he walked up the silent road he still
  bewailed, the fate that had called him to such an uneventful life as a
  pedagogue's. What a prosaic existence he led, so stagnant, so colourless!
  Secure, methodical, year in year out, what call was there for bravery? He
  thought enviously of those roving, mediaeval days, so near and so remote, of
  quests and spies and condottieri and many a risky blade-drawing business. And
  suddenly came a doubt, a strange doubt, springing out of some chance thought
  of tortures, and destructive altogether of the position he had assumed that
  evening.</p>

  <p>Was he&mdash;Mr. Ledbetter&mdash;really, after all, so brave as he
  assumed? Would he really be so pleased to have railways, policemen, and
  security vanish suddenly from the earth?</p>

  <p>The talkative man had spoken enviously of crime. "The burglar," he said,
  "is the only true adventurer left on earth. Think of his single-handed fight
  against the whole civilised world!" And Mr. Ledbetter had echoed his envy.
  "They <i>do</i> have some fun out of life," Mr. Ledbetter had said. "And
  about the only people who do. Just think how it must feel to wire a lawn!"
  And he had laughed wickedly. Now, in this franker intimacy of self-communion
  he found himself instituting a comparison between his own brand of courage
  and that of the habitual criminal. He tried to meet these insidious
  questionings with blank assertion. "I could do all that," said Mr. Ledbetter.
  "I long to do all that. Only I do not give way to my criminal impulses. My
  moral courage restrains me." But he doubted even while he told himself these
  things.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ledbetter passed a large villa standing by itself. Conveniently
  situated above a quiet, practicable balcony was a window, gaping black, wide
  open. At the time he scarcely marked it, but the picture of it came with him,
  wove into his thoughts. He figured himself climbing up that balcony,
  crouching&mdash;plunging into that dark, mysterious interior. "Bah! You would
  not dare," said the Spirit of Doubt. "My duty to my fellow-men forbids," said
  Mr. Ledbetter's self-respect.</p>

  <p>It was nearly eleven, and the little seaside town was already very still.
  The whole world slumbered under the moonlight. Only one warm oblong of
  window-blind far down the road spoke of waking life. He turned and came back
  slowly towards the villa of the open window. He stood for a time outside the
  gate, a battlefield of motives. "Let us put things to the test," said Doubt.
  "For the satisfaction of these intolerable doubts, show that you dare go into
  that house. Commit a burglary in blank. That, at any rate, is no crime." Very
  softly he opened and shut the gate and slipped into the shadow of the
  shrubbery. "This is foolish," said Mr. Ledbetter's caution. "I expected
  that," said Doubt. His heart was beating fast, but he was certainly not
  afraid. He was <i>not</i> afraid. He remained in that shadow for some
  considerable time.</p>

  <p>The ascent of the balcony, it was evident, would have to be done in a
  rush, for it was all in clear moonlight, and visible from the gate into the
  avenue. A trellis thinly set with young, ambitious climbing roses made the
  ascent ridiculously easy. There, in that black shadow by the stone vase of
  flowers, one might crouch and take a closer view of this gaping breach in the
  domestic defences, the open window. For a while Mr. Ledbetter was as still as
  the night, and then that insidious whisky tipped the balance. He dashed
  forward. He went up the trellis with quick, convulsive movements, swung his
  legs over the parapet of the balcony, and dropped panting in the shadow even
  as he had designed. He was trembling violently, short of breath, and his
  heart pumped noisily, but his mood was exultation. He could have shouted to
  find he was so little afraid.</p>

  <p>A happy line that he had learnt from Wills's "Mephistopheles" came into
  his mind as he crouched there. "I feel like a cat on the tiles," he whispered
  to himself. It was far better than he had expected&mdash;this adventurous
  exhilaration. He was sorry for all poor men to whom burglary was unknown.
  Nothing happened. He was quite safe. And he was acting in the bravest
  manner!</p>

  <p>And now for the window, to make the burglary complete! Must he dare do
  that? Its position above the front door defined it as a landing or passage,
  and there were no looking-glasses or any bedroom signs about it, or any other
  window on the first floor, to suggest the possibility of a sleeper within.
  For a time he listened under the ledge, then raised his eyes above the sill
  and peered in. Close at hand, on a pedestal, and a little startling at first,
  was a nearly life-size gesticulating bronze. He ducked, and after some time
  he peered again. Beyond was a broad landing, faintly gleaming; a flimsy
  fabric of bead curtain, very black and sharp, against a further window; a
  broad staircase, plunging into a gulf of darkness below; and another
  ascending to the second floor. He glanced behind him, but the stillness of
  the night was unbroken. "Crime," he whispered, "crime," and scrambled softly
  and swiftly over the sill into the house. His feet fell noiselessly on a mat
  of skin. He was a burglar indeed!</p>

  <p>He crouched for a time, all ears and peering eyes. Outside was a
  scampering and rustling, and for a moment he repented of his enterprise. A
  short "miaow," a spitting, and a rush into silence, spoke reassuringly of
  cats. His courage grew. He stood up. Every one was abed, it seemed. So easy
  is it to commit a burglary, if one is so minded. He was glad he had put it to
  the test. He determined to take some petty trophy, just to prove his freedom
  from any abject fear of the law, and depart the way he had come.</p>

  <p>He peered about him, and suddenly the critical spirit arose again.
  Burglars did far more than such mere elementary entrance as this: they went
  into rooms, they forced safes. Well&mdash;he was not afraid. He could not
  force safes, because that would be a stupid want of consideration for his
  hosts. But he would go into rooms&mdash;he would go upstairs. More: he told
  himself that he was perfectly secure; an empty house could not be more
  reassuringly still. He had to clench his hands, nevertheless, and summon all
  his resolution before he began very softly to ascend the dim staircase,
  pausing for several seconds between each step. Above was a square landing
  with one open and several closed doors; and all the house was still. For a
  moment he stood wondering what would happen if some sleeper woke suddenly and
  emerged. The open door showed a moonlit bedroom, the coverlet white and
  undisturbed. Into this room he crept in three interminable minutes and took a
  piece of soap for his plunder&mdash;his trophy. He turned to descend even
  more softly than he had ascended. It was as easy as&mdash;</p>

  <p>Hist!...</p>

  <p>Footsteps! On the gravel outside the house&mdash;and then the noise of a
  latchkey, the yawn and bang of a door, and the spitting of a match in the
  hall below. Mr. Ledbetter stood petrified by the sudden discovery of the
  folly upon which he had come. "How on earth am I to get out of this?" said
  Mr. Ledbetter.</p>

  <p>The hall grew bright with a candle flame, some heavy object bumped against
  the umbrella-stand, and feet were ascending the staircase. In a flash Mr.
  Ledbetter realised that his retreat was closed. He stood for a moment, a
  pitiful figure of penitent confusion. "My goodness! What a <i>fool</i> I have
  been!" he whispered, and then darted swiftly across the shadowy landing into
  the empty bedroom from which he had just come. He stood
  listening&mdash;quivering. The footsteps reached the first-floor landing.</p>

  <p>Horrible thought! This was possibly the latecomer's room! Not a moment was
  to be lost! Mr. Ledbetter stooped beside the bed, thanked Heaven for a
  valance, and crawled within its protection not ten seconds too soon. He
  became motionless on hands and knees. The advancing candle-light appeared
  through the thinner stitches of the fabric, the shadows ran wildly about, and
  became rigid as the candle was put down.</p>

  <p>"Lord, what a day!" said the newcomer, blowing noisily, and it seemed he
  deposited some heavy burthen on what Mr. Ledbetter, judging by the feet,
  decided to be a writing-table. The unseen then went to the door and locked
  it, examined the fastenings of the windows carefully and pulled down the
  blinds, and returning sat down upon the bed with startling ponderosity.</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i> a day!" he said. "Good Lord!" and blew again, and Mr.
  Ledbetter inclined to believe that the person was mopping his face. His boots
  were good stout boots; the shadows of his legs upon the valance suggested a
  formidable stoutness of aspect. After a time he removed some upper
  garments&mdash;a coat and waistcoat, Mr. Ledbetter inferred&mdash;and casting
  them over the rail of the bed remained breathing less noisily, and as it
  seemed cooling from a considerable temperature. At intervals he muttered to
  himself, and once he laughed softly. And Mr. Ledbetter muttered to himself,
  but he did not laugh. "Of all the foolish things," said Mr. Ledbetter. "What
  on earth am I to do now?"</p>

  <p>His outlook was necessarily limited. The minute apertures between the
  stitches of the fabric of the valance admitted a certain amount of light, but
  permitted no peeping. The shadows upon this curtain, save for those sharply
  defined legs, were enigmatical, and intermingled confusingly with the florid
  patterning of the chintz. Beneath the edge of the valance a strip of carpet
  was visible, and, by cautiously depressing his eye, Mr. Ledbetter found that
  this strip broadened until the whole area of the floor came into view. The
  carpet was a luxurious one, the room spacious, and, to judge by the castors
  and so forth of the furniture, well equipped.</p>

  <p>What he should do he found it difficult to imagine. To wait until this
  person had gone to bed, and then, when he seemed to be sleeping, to creep to
  the door, unlock it, and bolt headlong for that balcony seemed the only
  possible thing to do. Would it be possible to jump from the balcony? The
  danger of it! When he thought of the chances against him, Mr. Ledbetter
  despaired. He was within an ace of thrusting forth his head beside the
  gentleman's legs, coughing if necessary to attract his attention, and then,
  smiling, apologising and explaining his unfortunate intrusion by a few
  well-chosen sentences. But he found these sentences hard to choose. "No
  doubt, sir, my appearance is peculiar," or, "I trust, sir, you will pardon my
  somewhat ambiguous appearance from beneath you," was about as much as he
  could get.</p>

  <p>Grave possibilities forced themselves on his attention. Suppose they did
  not believe him, what would they do to him? Would his unblemished high
  character count for nothing? Technically he was a burglar, beyond dispute.
  Following out this train of thought, he was composing a lucid apology for
  "this technical crime I have committed," to be delivered before sentence in
  the dock, when the stout gentleman got up and began walking about the room.
  He locked and unlocked drawers, and Mr. Ledbetter had a transient hope that
  he might be undressing. But, no! He seated himself at the writing-table, and
  began to write and then tear up documents. Presently the smell of burning
  cream-laid paper mingled with the odour of cigars in Mr. Ledbetter's
  nostrils.</p>

  <p>"The position I had assumed," said Mr. Ledbetter when he told me of these
  things, "was in many respects an ill-advised one. A transverse bar beneath
  the bed depressed my head unduly, and threw a disproportionate share of my
  weight upon my hands. After a time, I experienced what is called, I believe,
  a crick in the neck. The pressure of my hands on the coarsely-stitched carpet
  speedily became painful. My knees, too, were painful, my trousers being drawn
  tightly over them. At that time I wore rather higher collars than I do
  now&mdash;two and a half inches, in fact&mdash;and I discovered what I had
  not remarked before, that the edge of the one I wore was frayed slightly
  under the chin. But much worse than these things was an itching of my face,
  which I could only relieve by violent grimacing&mdash;I tried to raise my
  hand, but the rustle of the sleeve alarmed me. After a time I had to desist
  from this relief also, because&mdash;happily in time&mdash;I discovered that
  my facial contortions were shifting my glasses down my nose. Their fall
  would, of course, have exposed me, and as it was they came to rest in an
  oblique position of by no means stable equilibrium. In addition I had a
  slight cold, and an intermittent desire to sneeze or sniff caused me
  inconvenience. In fact, quite apart from the extreme anxiety of my position,
  my physical discomfort became in a short time very considerable indeed. But I
  had to stay there motionless, nevertheless."</p>

  <p>After an interminable time, there began a chinking sound. This deepened
  into a rhythm: chink, chink, chink&mdash;twenty-five chinks&mdash;a rap on
  the writing-table, and a grunt from the owner of the stout legs. It dawned
  upon Mr. Ledbetter that this chinking was the chinking of gold. He became
  incredulously curious as it went on. His curiosity grew. Already, if that was
  the case, this extraordinary man must have counted some hundreds of pounds.
  At last Mr. Ledbetter could resist it no longer, and he began very cautiously
  to fold his arms and lower his head to the level of the floor, in the hope of
  peeping under the valance. He moved his feet, and one made a slight scraping
  on the floor. Suddenly the chinking ceased. Mr. Ledbetter became rigid. After
  a while the chinking was resumed. Then it ceased again, and everything was
  still, except Mr. Ledbetter's heart&mdash;that organ seemed to him to be
  beating like a drum.</p>

  <p>The stillness continued. Mr. Ledbetter's head was now on the floor, and he
  could see the stout legs as far as the shins. They were quite still. The feet
  were resting on the toes and drawn back, as it seemed, under the chair of the
  owner. Everything was quite still, everything continued still. A wild hope
  came to Mr. Ledbetter that the unknown was in a fit or suddenly dead, with
  his head upon the writing-table...</p>

  <p>The stillness continued. What had happened? The desire to peep became
  irresistible. Very cautiously Mr. Ledbetter shifted his hand forward,
  projected a pioneer finger, and began to lift the valance immediately next
  his eye. Nothing broke the stillness. He saw now the stranger's knees, saw
  the back of the writing-table, and then&mdash;he was staring at the barrel of
  a heavy revolver pointed over the writing-table at his head.</p>

  <p>"Come out of that, you scoundrel!" said the voice of the stout gentleman
  in a tone of quiet concentration. "Come out. This side, and now. None of your
  hanky-panky&mdash;come right out, now."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ledbetter came right out, a little reluctantly perhaps, but without
  any hanky-panky, and at once, even as he was told.</p>

  <p>"Kneel," said the stout gentleman. "and hold up your hands."</p>

  <p>The valance dropped again behind Mr. Ledbetter, and he rose from all-
  fours and held up his hands. "Dressed like a parson," said the stout
  gentleman. "I'm blest if he isn't! A little chap, too! You <i>scoundrel</i>!
  What the deuce possessed you to come here to-night? What the deuce possessed
  you to get under my bed?"</p>

  <p>He did not appear to require an answer, but proceeded at once to several
  very objectionable remarks upon Mr. Ledbetter's personal appearance. He was
  not a very big man, but he looked strong to Mr. Ledbetter: he was as stout as
  his legs had promised, he had rather delicately-chiselled small features
  distributed over a considerable area of whitish face, and quite a number of
  chins. And the note of his voice had a sort of whispering undertone.</p>

  <p>"What the deuce, I say, possessed you to get under my bed?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Ledbetter, by an effort, smiled a wan propitiatory smile. He coughed.
  "I can quite understand&mdash;" he said.</p>

  <p>"Why! What on earth? It's <i>soap</i>! No!&mdash;you scoundrel. Don't you
  move that hand."</p>

  <p>"It's soap," said Mr. Ledbetter. "From your washstand. No doubt
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk," said the stout man. "I see it's soap. Of all incredible
  things."</p>

  <p>"If I might explain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't explain. It's sure to be a lie, and there's no time for
  explanations. What was I going to ask you? Ah! Have you any mates?"</p>

  <p>"In a few minutes, if you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Have you any mates? Curse you. If you start any soapy palaver I'll shoot.
  Have you any mates?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mr. Ledbetter.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's a lie," said the stout man. "But you'll pay for it if it
  is. Why the deuce didn't you floor me when I came upstairs? You won't get a
  chance to now, anyhow. Fancy getting under the bed! I reckon it's a fair cop,
  anyhow, so far as you are concerned."</p>

  <p>"I don't see how I could prove an alibi," remarked Mr. Ledbetter, trying
  to show by his conversation that he was an educated man. There was a pause.
  Mr. Ledbetter perceived that on a chair beside his captor was a large black
  bag on a heap of crumpled papers, and that there were torn and burnt papers
  on the table. And in front of these, and arranged methodically along the edge
  were rows and rows of little yellow rouleaux&mdash;a hundred times more gold
  than Mr. Ledbetter had seen in all his life before. The light of two candles,
  in silver candlesticks, fell upon these. The pause continued. "It is rather
  fatiguing holding up my hands like this," said Mr. Ledbetter, with a
  deprecatory smile.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said the fat man. "But what to do with you I don't
  exactly know."</p>

  <p>"I know my position is ambiguous."</p>

  <p>"Lord!" said the fat man, "ambiguous! And goes about with his own soap,
  and wears a thundering great clerical collar. You <i>are</i> a blooming
  burglar, you are&mdash;if ever there was one!"</p>

  <p>"To be strictly accurate," said Mr. Ledbetter, and suddenly his glasses
  slipped off and clattered against his vest buttons.</p>

  <p>The fat man changed countenance, a flash of savage resolution crossed his
  face, and something in the revolver clicked. He put his other hand to the
  weapon. And then he looked at Mr. Ledbetter, and his eye went down to the
  dropped pince-nez.</p>

  <p>"Full-cock now, anyhow," said the fat man, after a pause, and his breath
  seemed to catch. "But I'll tell you, you've never been so near death before.
  Lord! <i>I'm</i> almost glad. If it hadn't been that the revolver wasn't
  cocked you'd be lying dead there now."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ledbetter said nothing, but he felt that the room was swaying.</p>

  <p>"A miss is as good as a mile. It's lucky for both of us it wasn't. Lord!"
  He blew noisily. "There's no need for you to go pale-green for a little thing
  like that."</p>

  <p>"If I can assure you, sir&mdash;" said Mr. Ledbetter, with an effort.</p>

  <p>"There's only one thing to do. If I call in the police, I'm bust&mdash;a
  little game I've got on is bust. That won't do. If I tie you up and leave you
  again, the thing may be out to-morrow. Tomorrow's Sunday, and Monday's Bank
  Holiday&mdash;I've counted on three clear days. Shooting you's
  murder&mdash;and hanging; and besides, it will bust the whole blooming
  kernooze. I'm hanged if I can think what to do&mdash;I'm hanged if I
  can."</p>

  <p>"Will you permit me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You gas as much as if you were a real parson, I'm blessed if you don't.
  Of all the burglars you are the&mdash;Well! No!&mdash;I <i>won't</i> permit
  you. There isn't time. If you start off jawing again, I'll shoot right in
  your stomach. See? But I know now-I know now! What we're going to do first,
  my man, is an examination for concealed arms&mdash;an examination for
  concealed arms. And look here! When I tell you to do a thing, don't start off
  at a gabble&mdash;do it brisk."</p>

  <p>And with many elaborate precautions, and always pointing the pistol at Mr.
  Ledbetter's head, the stout man stood him up and searched him for weapons.
  "Why, you <i>are</i> a burglar!" he said "You're a perfect amateur. You
  haven't even a pistol-pocket in the back of your breeches. No, you don't!
  Shut up, now."</p>

  <p>So soon as the issue was decided, the stout man made Mr. Ledbetter take
  off his coat and roll up his shirt-sleeves, and, with the revolver at one
  ear, proceed with the packing his appearance had interrupted. From the stout
  man's point of view that was evidently the only possible arrangement, for if
  he had packed, he would have had to put down the revolver. So that even the
  gold on the table was handled by Mr. Ledbetter. This nocturnal packing was
  peculiar. The stout man's idea was evidently to distribute the weight of the
  gold as unostentatiously as possible through his luggage. It was by no means
  an inconsiderable weight. There was, Mr. Ledbetter says, altogether nearly
  &pound;18,000 in gold in the black bag and on the table. There were also many
  little rolls of &pound;5 bank-notes. Each rouleau of &pound;25 was wrapped by
  Mr. Ledbetter in paper. These rouleaux were then put neatly in cigar boxes
  and distributed between a travelling trunk, a Gladstone bag, and a hatbox.
  About L600 went in a tobacco tin in a dressing-bag. L10 in gold and a number
  of L5 notes the stout man pocketed. Occasionally he objurgated Mr.
  Ledbetter's clumsiness, and urged him to hurry, and several times he appealed
  to Mr. Ledbetter's watch for information.</p>

  <p>Mr. Ledbetter strapped the trunk and bag, and returned the stout man the
  keys. It was then ten minutes to twelve, and until the stroke of midnight the
  stout man made him sit on the Gladstone bag, while he sat at a reasonably
  safe distance on the trunk and held the revolver handy and waited. He
  appeared to be now in a less aggressive mood, and having watched Mr.
  Ledbetter for some time, he offered a few remarks.</p>

  <p>"From your accent I judge you are a man of some education," he said,
  lighting a cigar. "No&mdash;<i>don't</i> begin that explanation of yours. I
  know it will be long-winded from your face, and I am much too old a liar to
  be interested in other men's lying. You are, I say, a person of education.
  You do well to dress as a curate. Even among educated people you might pass
  as a curate."</p>

  <p>"I <i>am</i> a curate," said Mr. Ledbetter, "or, at least&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are trying to be. I know. But you didn't ought to burgle. You are not
  the man to burgle. You are, if I may say it&mdash;the thing will have been
  pointed out to you before&mdash;a coward."</p>

  <p>"Do you know," said Mr. Ledbetter, trying to get a final opening, "it was
  that very question&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The stout man waved him into silence.</p>

  <p>"You waste your education in burglary. You should do one of two things.
  Either you should forge or you should embezzle. For my own part, I embezzle.
  Yes; I embezzle. What do you think a man could be doing with all this gold
  but that? Ah! Listen! Midnight!...Ten. Eleven. Twelve. There is something
  very impressive to me in that slow beating of the hours. Time&mdash;space;
  what mysteries they are! What mysteries... It's time for us to be moving.
  Stand up!"</p>

  <p>And then kindly, but firmly, he induced Mr. Ledbetter to sling the
  dressing bag over his back by a string across his chest, to shoulder the
  trunk, and, overruling a gasping protest, to take the Gladstone bag in his
  disengaged hand. So encumbered, Mr. Ledbetter struggled perilously
  downstairs. The stout gentleman followed with an overcoat, the hatbox, and
  the revolver, making derogatory remarks about Mr. Ledbetter's strength, and
  assisting him at the turnings of the stairs.</p>

  <p>"The back door," he directed, and Mr. Ledbetter staggered through a
  conservatory, leaving a wake of smashed flower-pots behind him. "Never mind
  the crockery," said the stout man; "it's good for trade. We wait here until a
  quarter past. You can put those things down. You have!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Ledbetter collapsed panting on the trunk. "Last night," he gasped, "I
  was asleep in my little room, and I no more dreamt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's no need for you to incriminate yourself," said the stout
  gentleman, looking at the lock of the revolver. He began to hum. Mr.
  Ledbetter made to speak, and thought better of it.</p>

  <p>There presently came the sound of a bell, and Mr. Ledbetter was taken to
  the back door and instructed to open it. A fair-haired man in yachting
  costume entered. At the sight of Mr. Ledbetter he started violently and
  clapped his hand behind him. Then he saw the stout man. "Bingham!" he cried,
  "who's this?"</p>

  <p>"Only a little philanthropic do of mine&mdash;burglar I'm trying to
  reform. Caught him under my bed just now. He's all right. He's a frightful
  ass. He'll be useful to carry some of our things."</p>

  <p>The newcomer seemed inclined to resent Mr. Ledbetter's presence at first,
  but the stout man reassured him.</p>

  <p>"He's quite alone. There's not a gang in the world would own him. No!
  &mdash;don't start talking, for goodness' sake."</p>

  <p>They went out into the darkness of the garden with the trunk still bowing
  Mr. Ledbetter's shoulders. The man in the yachting costume walked in front
  with the Gladstone bag and a pistol; then came Mr. Ledbetter like Atlas; Mr.
  Bingham followed with the hat-box, coat, and revolver as before. The house
  was one of those that have their gardens right up to the cliff. At the cliff
  was a steep wooden stairway, descending to a bathing tent dimly visible on
  the beach. Below was a boat pulled up, and a silent little man with a black
  face stood beside it. "A few moments' explanation," said Mr. Ledbetter; "I
  can assure you&mdash;" Somebody kicked him, and he said no more.</p>

  <p>They made him wade to the boat, carrying the trunk, they pulled him aboard
  by the shoulders and hair, they called him no better name than "scoundrel"
  and "burglar" all that night. But they spoke in undertones so that the
  general public was happily unaware of his ignominy. They hauled him aboard a
  yacht manned by strange, unsympathetic Orientals, and partly they thrust him
  and partly he fell down a gangway into a noisome, dark place, where he was to
  remain many days&mdash;how many he does not know, because he lost count among
  other things when he was seasick. They fed him on biscuits and
  incomprehensible words; they gave him water to drink mixed with unwished-for
  rum. And there were cockroaches where they put him, night and day there were
  cockroaches, and in the night-time there were rats. The Orientals emptied his
  pockets and took his watch&mdash;but Mr. Bingham, being appealed to, took
  that himself. And five or six times the five Lascars&mdash;if they were
  Lascars&mdash;and the Chinaman and the negro who constituted the crew, fished
  him out and took him aft to Bingham and his friend to play cribbage and
  euchre and three-handed whist, and to listen to their stories and boastings
  in an interested manner.</p>

  <p>Then these principals would talk to him as men talk to those who have
  lived a life of crime. Explanations they would never permit, though they made
  it abundantly clear to him that he was the rummiest burglar they had ever set
  eyes on. They said as much again and again. The fair man was of a taciturn
  disposition and irascible at play; but Mr. Bingham, now that the evident
  anxiety of his departure from England was assuaged, displayed a vein of
  genial philosophy. He enlarged upon the mystery of space and time, and quoted
  Kant and Hegel&mdash;or, at least, he said he did. Several times Mr.
  Ledbetter got as far as: "My position under your bed, you know&mdash;," but
  then he always had to cut, or pass the whisky, or do some such intervening
  thing. After his third failure, the fair man got quite to look for this
  opening, and whenever Mr. Ledbetter began after that, he would roar with
  laughter and hit him violently on the back. "Same old start, same old story;
  good old burglar!" the fair-haired man would say.</p>

  <p>So Mr. Ledbetter suffered for many days, twenty perhaps; and one evening
  he was taken, together with some tinned provisions, over the side and put
  ashore on a rocky little island with a spring. Mr. Bingham came in the boat
  with him, giving him good advice all the way, and waving his last attempts at
  an explanation aside.</p>

  <p>"I am really <i>not</i> a burglar," said Mr. Ledbetter.</p>

  <p>"You never will be," said Mr. Bingham. "You'll never make a burglar. I'm
  glad you are beginning to see it. In choosing a profession a man must study
  his temperament. If you don't, sooner or later you will fail. Compare myself,
  for example. All my life I have been in banks&mdash;I have got on in banks. I
  have even been a bank manager. But was I happy? No. Why wasn't I happy?
  Because it did not suit my temperament. I am too adventurous&mdash;too
  versatile. Practically I have thrown it over. I do not suppose I shall ever
  manage a bank again. They would be glad to get me, no doubt; but I have
  learnt the lesson of my temperament&mdash;at last... No! I shall never manage
  a bank again.</p>

  <p>"Now, your temperament unfits you for crime&mdash;just as mine unfits me
  for respectability. I know you better than I did, and now I do not even
  recommend forgery. Go back to respectable courses, my man. <i>Your</i> lay is
  the philanthropic lay&mdash;that is your lay. With that voice&mdash;the
  Association for the Promotion of Snivelling among the Young&mdash;something
  in that line. You think it over.</p>

  <p>"The island we are approaching has no name apparently&mdash;at least,
  there is none on the chart. You might think out a name for it while you are
  there&mdash;while you are thinking about all these things. It has quite
  drinkable water, I understand. It is one of the Grenadines&mdash;one of the
  Windward Islands. Yonder, dim and blue, are others of the Grenadines. There
  are quantities of Grenadines, but the majority are out of sight. I have often
  wondered what these islands are for&mdash;now, you see, I am wiser. This one
  at least is for you. Sooner or later some simple native will come along and
  take you off. Say what you like about us then&mdash;abuse us, if you like
  &mdash;we shan't care a solitary Grenadine! And here&mdash;here is half a
  sovereign's worth of silver. Do not waste that in foolish dissipation when
  you return to civilisation. Properly used, it may give you a fresh start in
  life. And do not&mdash;Don't beach her, you beggars, he can wade!&mdash;Do
  not waste the precious solitude before you in foolish thoughts. Properly
  used, it may be a turning-point in your career. Waste neither money nor time.
  You will die rich. I'm sorry, but I must ask you to carry your tucker to land
  in your arms. No; it's not deep. Curse that explanation of yours! There's not
  time. No, no, no! I won't listen. Overboard you go!"</p>

  <p>And the falling night found Mr. Ledbetter&mdash;the Mr. Ledbetter who had
  complained that adventure was dead&mdash;sitting beside his cans of food, his
  chin resting upon his drawn-up knees, staring through his glasses in dismal
  mildness over the shining, vacant sea.</p>

  <p>He was picked up in the course of three days by a negro fisherman and
  taken to St. Vincent's, and from St. Vincent's he got, by the expenditure of
  his last coins, to Kingston, in Jamaica. And there he might have foundered.
  Even nowadays he is not a man of affairs, and then he was a singularly
  helpless person. He had not the remotest idea what he ought to do. The only
  thing he seems to have done was to visit all the ministers of religion he
  could find in the place to borrow a passage home. But he was much too dirty
  and incoherent&mdash;and his story far too incredible for them. I met him
  quite by chance. It was close upon sunset, and I was walking out after my
  siesta on the road to Dunn's Battery, when I met him&mdash;I was rather
  bored, and with a whole evening on my hands&mdash;luckily for him. He was
  trudging dismally towards the town. His woebegone face and the quasi-clerical
  cut of his dust-stained, filthy costume caught my humour. Our eyes met. He
  hesitated. "Sir," he said, with a catching of the breath, "could you spare a
  few minutes for what I fear will seem an incredible story?"</p>

  <p>"Incredible!" I said.</p>

  <p>"Quite," he answered eagerly. "No one will believe it, alter it though I
  may. Yet I can assure you, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped hopelessly. The man's tone tickled me. He seemed an odd
  character. "I am," he said, "one of the most unfortunate beings alive."</p>

  <p>"Among other things, you haven't dined?" I said, struck with an idea.</p>

  <p>"I have not," he said solemnly, "for many days."</p>

  <p>"You'll tell it better after that," I said; and without more ado led the
  way to a low place I knew, where such a costume as his was unlikely to give
  offence. And there&mdash;with certain omissions which he subsequently
  supplied&mdash;I got his story. At first I was incredulous, but as the wine
  warmed him, and the faint suggestion of cringing which his misfortunes had
  added to his manner disappeared, I began to believe. At last, I was so far
  convinced of his sincerity that I got him a bed for the night, and next day
  verified the banker's reference he gave me through my Jamaica banker. And
  that done, I took him shopping for underwear and such like equipments of a
  gentleman at large. Presently came the verified reference. His astonishing
  story was true. I will not amplify our subsequent proceedings. He started for
  England in three days' time.</p>

  <p>"I do not know how I can possibly thank you enough," began the letter he
  wrote me from England, "for all your kindness to a total stranger," and
  proceeded for some time in a similar strain. "Had it not been for your
  generous assistance, I could certainly never have returned in time for the
  resumption of my scholastic duties, and my few minutes of reckless folly
  would, perhaps, have proved my ruin. As it is, I am entangled in a tissue of
  lies and evasions, of the most complicated sort, to account for my sunburnt
  appearance and my whereabouts. I have rather carelessly told two or three
  different stories, not realising the trouble this would mean for me in the
  end. The truth I dare not tell. I have consulted a number of law-books in the
  British Museum, and there is not the slightest doubt that I have connived at
  and abetted and aided a felony. That scoundrel Bingham was the Hithergate
  bank manager, I find, and guilty of the most flagrant embezzlement. Please,
  please burn this letter when read&mdash;I trust you implicitly. The worst of
  it is, neither my aunt nor her friend who kept the boarding-house at which I
  was staying seem altogether to believe a guarded statement I have made them
  practically of what actually happened. They suspect me of some discreditable
  adventure, but what sort of discreditable adventure they suspect me of, I do
  not know. My aunt says she would forgive me if I told her everything. I
  have&mdash;I have told her <i>more</i> than everything, and still she is not
  satisfied. It would never do to let them know the truth of the case, of
  course, and so I represent myself as having been waylaid and gagged upon the
  beach. My aunt wants to know <i>why</i> they waylaid and gagged me, why they
  took me away in their yacht. I do not know. Can you suggest any reason? I can
  think of nothing. If, when you wrote, you could write on <i>two</i> sheets so
  that I could show her one, and on that one if you could show clearly that I
  really <i>was</i> in Jamaica this summer, and had come there by being removed
  from a ship, it would be of great service to me. It would certainly add to
  the load of my obligation to you&mdash;a load that I fear I can never fully
  repay. Although if gratitude ..." And so forth. At the end he repeated his
  request for me to burn the letter.</p>

  <p>So the remarkable story of Mr. Ledbetter's Vacation ends. That breach with
  his aunt was not of long duration. The old lady had forgiven him before she
  died.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="story52"
     name="story52">THE STOLEN BODY</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, November 1898</h3>

  <p>Mr. Bessel was the senior partner in the firm of Bessel, Hart, and Brown,
  of St. Paul's Churchyard, and for many years he was well known among those
  interested in psychical research as a liberal-minded and conscientious
  investigator. He was an unmarried man, and instead of living in the suburbs,
  after the fashion of his class, he occupied rooms in the Albany, near
  Piccadilly. He was particularly interested in the questions of thought
  transference and of apparitions of the living, and in November, 1896, he
  commenced a series of experiments in conjunction with Mr. Vincey, of Staple
  Inn, in order to test the alleged possibility of projecting an apparition of
  one's self by force of will through space.</p>

  <p>Their experiments were conducted in the following manner: At a pre-
  arranged hour Mr. Bessel shut himself in one of his rooms in the Albany and
  Mr. Vincey in his sitting-room in Staple Inn, and each then fixed his mind as
  resolutely as possible on the other. Mr. Bessel had acquired the art of self-
  hypnotism, and, so far as he could, he attempted first to hypnotise himself
  and then to project himself as a "phantom of the living" across the
  intervening space of nearly two miles into Mr. Vincey's apartment. On several
  evenings this was tried without any satisfactory result, but on the fifth or
  sixth occasion Mr. Vincey did actually see or imagine he saw an apparition of
  Mr. Bessel standing in his room. He states that the appearance, although
  brief, was very vivid and real. He noticed that Mr. Bessel's face was white
  and his expression anxious, and, moreover, that his hair was disordered. For
  a moment Mr. Vincey, in spite of his state of expectation, was too surprised
  to speak or move, and in that moment it seemed to him as though the figure
  glanced over its shoulder and incontinently vanished.</p>

  <p>It had been arranged that an attempt should be made to photograph any
  phantasm seen, but Mr. Vincey had not the instant presence of mind to snap
  the camera that lay ready on the table beside him, and when he did so he was
  too late. Greatly elated, however, even by this partial success, he made a
  note of the exact time, and at once took a cab to the Albany to inform Mr.
  Bessel of this result.</p>

  <p>He was surprised to find Mr. Bessel's outer door standing open to the
  night, and the inner apartments lit and in an extraordinary disorder. An
  empty champagne magnum lay smashed upon the floor; its neck had been broken
  off against the inkpot on the bureau and lay beside it. An octagonal
  occasional table, which carried a bronze statuette and a number of choice
  books, had been rudely overturned, and down the primrose paper of the wall
  inky fingers had been drawn, as it seemed for the mere pleasure of
  defilement. One of the delicate chintz curtains had been violently torn from
  its rings and thrust upon the fire, so that the smell of its smouldering
  filled the room. Indeed the whole place was disarranged in the strangest
  fashion. For a few minutes Mr. Vincey, who had entered sure of finding Mr.
  Bessel in his easy chair awaiting him, could scarcely believe his eyes, and
  stood staring helplessly at these unanticipated things.</p>

  <p>Then, full of a vague sense of calamity, he sought the porter at the
  entrance lodge. "Where is Mr. Bessel?" he asked. "Do you know that all the
  furniture is broken in Mr. Bessel's room?" The porter said nothing, but,
  obeying his gestures, came at once to Mr. Bessel's apartment to see the state
  of affairs. "This settles it," he said, surveying the lunatic confusion. "I
  didn't know of this. Mr. Bessel's gone off. He's mad!"</p>

  <p>He then proceeded to tell Mr. Vincey that about half an hour previously,
  that is to say, at about the time of Mr. Bessel's apparition in Mr. Vincey's
  rooms, the missing gentleman had rushed out of the gates of the Albany into
  Vigo Street, hatless and with disordered hair, and had vanished into the
  direction of Bond Street. "And as he went past me," said the porter, "he
  laughed&mdash;a sort of gasping laugh, with his mouth open and his eyes
  glaring&mdash;I tell you, sir, he fair scared me!&mdash;like this."</p>

  <p>According to his imitation it was anything but a pleasant laugh. "He waved
  his hand, with all his fingers crooked and clawing&mdash;like that. And he
  said, in a sort of fierce whisper, <i>'Life!'</i> Just that one word,
  <i>'Life!</i>'"</p>

  <p>"Dear me," said Mr. Vincey. "Tut, tut," and "Dear me!" He could think of
  nothing else to say. He was naturally very much surprised. He turned from the
  room to the porter and from the porter to the room in the gravest perplexity.
  Beyond his suggestion that probably Mr. Bessel would come back presently and
  explain what had happened, their conversation was unable to proceed. "It
  might be a sudden toothache," said the porter, "a very sudden and violent
  toothache, jumping on him suddenly-like and driving him wild. I've broken
  things myself before now in such a case ..." He thought. "If it was, why
  should he say <i>'Life'</i> to me as he went past?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Vincey did not know. Mr. Bessel did not return, and at last Mr.
  Vincey, having done some more helpless staring, and having addressed a note
  of brief inquiry and left it in a conspicuous position on the bureau,
  returned in a very perplexed frame of mind to his own premises in Staple Inn.
  This affair had given him a shock. He was at a loss to account for Mr.
  Bessel's conduct on any sane hypothesis. He tried to read, but he could not
  do so; he went for a short walk, and was so preoccupied that he narrowly
  escaped a cab at the top of Chancery Lane; and at last&mdash;a full hour
  before his usual time&mdash;he went to bed. For a considerable time he could
  not sleep because of his memory of the silent confusion of Mr. Bessel's
  apartment, and when at length he did attain an uneasy slumber it was at once
  disturbed by a very vivid and distressing dream of Mr. Bessel.</p>

  <p>He saw Mr. Bessel gesticulating wildly, and with his face white and
  contorted. And, inexplicably mingled with his appearance, suggested perhaps
  by his gestures, was an intense fear, an urgency to act. He even believes
  that he heard the voice of his fellow experimenter calling distressfully to
  him, though at the time he considered this to be an illusion. The vivid
  impression remained though Mr. Vincey awoke. For a space he lay awake and
  trembling in the darkness, possessed with that vague, unaccountable terror of
  unknown possibilities that comes out of dreams upon even the bravest men. But
  at last he roused himself, and turned over and went to sleep again, only for
  the dream to return with enhanced vividness.</p>

  <p>He awoke with such a strong conviction that Mr. Bessel was in overwhelming
  distress and need of help that sleep was no longer possible. He was persuaded
  that his friend had rushed out to some dire calamity. For a time he lay
  reasoning vainly against this belief, but at last he gave way to it. He
  arose, against all reason, lit his gas, and dressed, and set out through the
  deserted streets&mdash;deserted, save for a noiseless policeman or so and the
  early news carts&mdash;towards Vigo Street to inquire if Mr. Bessel had
  returned.</p>

  <p>But he never got there. As he was going down Long Acre some unaccountable
  impulse turned him aside out of that street towards Covent Garden, which was
  just waking to its nocturnal activities. He saw the market in front of him
  &mdash;a queer effect of glowing yellow lights and busy black figures. He
  became aware of a shouting, and perceived a figure turn the corner by the
  hotel and run swiftly towards him. He knew at once that it was Mr. Bessel.
  But it was Mr. Bessel transfigured. He was hatless and dishevelled, his
  collar was torn open, he grasped a bone-handled walking-cane near the ferrule
  end, and his mouth was pulled awry. And he ran, with agile strides, very
  rapidly. Their encounter was the affair of an instant. "Bessel!" cried
  Vincey.</p>

  <p>The running man gave no sign of recognition either of Mr. Vincey or of his
  own name. Instead, he cut at his friend savagely with the stick, hitting him
  in the face within an inch of the eye. Mr. Vincey, stunned and astonished,
  staggered back, lost his footing, and fell heavily on the pavement. It seemed
  to him that Mr. Bessel leapt over him as he fell. When he looked again Mr.
  Bessel had vanished, and a policeman and a number of garden porters and
  salesmen were rushing past towards Long Acre in hot pursuit.</p>

  <p>With the assistance of several passers-by&mdash;for the whole street was
  speedily alive with running people&mdash;Mr. Vincey struggled to his feet. He
  at once became the centre of a crowd greedy to see his injury. A multitude of
  voices competed to reassure him of his safety, and then to tell him of the
  behaviour of the madman, as they regarded Mr. Bessel. He had suddenly
  appeared in the middle of the market screaming <i>"Life! Life!"</i> striking
  left and right with a blood-stained walking-stick, and dancing and shouting
  with laughter at each successful blow. A lad and two women had broken heads,
  and he had smashed a man's wrist; a little child had been knocked insensible,
  and for a time he had driven every one before him, so furious and resolute
  had his behaviour been. Then he made a raid upon a coffee stall, hurled its
  paraffin flare through the window of the post office, and fled laughing,
  after stunning the foremost of the two policemen who had the pluck to charge
  him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Vincey's first impulse was naturally to join in the pursuit of his
  friend, in order if possible to save him from the violence of the indignant
  people. But his action was slow, the blow had half stunned him, and while
  this was still no more than a resolution came the news, shouted through the
  crowd, that Mr. Bessel had eluded his pursuers. At first Mr. Vincey could
  scarcely credit this, but the universality of the report, and presently the
  dignified return of two futile policemen, convinced him. After some aimless
  inquiries he returned towards Staple Inn, padding a handkerchief to a now
  very painful nose.</p>

  <p>He was angry and astonished and perplexed. It appeared to him indisputable
  that Mr. Bessel must have gone violently mad in the midst of his experiment
  in thought transference, but why that should make him appear with a sad white
  face in Mr. Vincey's dreams seemed a problem beyond solution. He racked his
  brains in vain to explain this. It seemed to him at last that not simply Mr.
  Bessel, but the order of things must be insane. But he could think of nothing
  to do. He shut himself carefully into his room, lit his fire&mdash;it was a
  gas fire with asbestos bricks&mdash;and, fearing fresh dreams if he went to
  bed, remained bathing his injured face, or holding up books in a vain attempt
  to read, until dawn. Throughout that vigil he had a curious persuasion that
  Mr. Bessel was endeavouring to speak to him, but he would not let himself
  attend to any such belief.</p>

  <p>About dawn, his physical fatigue asserted itself, and he went to bed and
  slept at last in spite of dreaming. He rose late, unrested and anxious, and
  in considerable facial pain. The morning papers had no news of Mr. Bessel's
  aberration&mdash;it had come too late for them. Mr. Vincey's perplexities, to
  which the fever of his bruise added fresh irritation, became at last
  intolerable, and, after a fruitless visit to the Albany, he went down to St.
  Paul's Churchyard to Mr. Hart, Mr. Bessel's partner, and, so far as Mr.
  Vincey knew, his nearest friend.</p>

  <p>He was surprised to learn that Mr. Hart, although he knew nothing of the
  outbreak, had also been disturbed by a vision, the very vision that Mr.
  Vincey had seen&mdash;Mr. Bessel, white and dishevelled, pleading earnestly
  by his gestures for help. That was his impression of the import of his signs.
  "I was just going to look him up in the Albany when you arrived," said Mr.
  Hart. "I was so sure of something being wrong with him."</p>

  <p>As the outcome of their consultation the two gentlemen decided to inquire
  at Scotland Yard for news of their missing friend. "He is bound to be laid by
  the heels," said Mr. Hart. "He can't go on at that pace for long." But the
  police authorities had not laid Mr. Bessel by the heels. They confirmed Mr.
  Vincey's overnight experiences and added fresh circumstances, some of an even
  graver character than those he knew&mdash;a list of smashed glass along the
  upper half of Tottenham Court Road, an attack upon a policeman in Hampstead
  Road, and an atrocious assault upon a woman. All these outrages were
  committed between half-past twelve and a quarter to two in the morning, and
  between those hours&mdash;and, indeed, from the very moment of Mr. Bessel's
  first rush from his rooms at half-past nine in the evening&mdash;they could
  trace the deepening violence of his fantastic career. For the last hour, at
  least from before one, that is, until a quarter to two, he had run amuck
  through London, eluding with amazing agility every effort to stop or capture
  him.</p>

  <p>But after a quarter to two he had vanished. Up to that hour witnesses were
  multitudinous. Dozens of people had seen him, fled from him or pursued him,
  and then things suddenly came to an end. At a quarter to two he had been seen
  running down the Euston Road towards Baker Street, flourishing a can of
  burning colza oil and jerking splashes of flame therefrom at the windows of
  the houses he passed. But none of the policemen on Euston Road beyond the
  Waxwork Exhibition, nor any of those in the side streets down which he must
  have passed had he left the Euston Road, had seen anything of him. Abruptly
  he disappeared. Nothing of his subsequent doings came to light in spite of
  the keenest inquiry.</p>

  <p>Here was a fresh astonishment for Mr. Vincey. He had found considerable
  comfort in Mr. Hart's conviction: "He is bound to be laid by the heels before
  long," and in that assurance he had been able to suspend his mental
  perplexities. But any fresh development seemed destined to add new
  impossibilities to a pile already heaped beyond the powers of his acceptance.
  He found himself doubting whether his memory might not have played him some
  grotesque trick, debating whether any of these things could possibly have
  happened; and in the afternoon he hunted up Mr. Hart again to share the
  intolerable weight on his mind. He found Mr. Hart engaged with a well-known
  private detective, but as that gentleman accomplished nothing in this case,
  we need not enlarge upon his proceedings.</p>

  <p>All that day Mr. Bessel's whereabouts eluded an unceasingly active
  inquiry, and all that night. And all that day there was a persuasion in the
  back of Vincey's mind that Mr. Bessel sought his attention, and all through
  the night Mr. Bessel with a tear-stained face of anguish pursued him through
  his dreams. And whenever he saw Mr. Bessel in his dreams he also saw a number
  of other faces, vague but malignant, that seemed to be pursuing Mr.
  Bessel.</p>

  <p>It was on the following day, Sunday, that Mr. Vincey recalled certain
  remarkable stories of Mrs. Bullock, the medium, who was then attracting
  attention for the first time in London. He determined to consult her. She was
  staying at the house of that well-known inquirer, Dr. Wilson Paget, and Mr.
  Vincey, although he had never met that gentleman before, repaired to him
  forthwith with the intention of invoking her help. But scarcely had he
  mentioned the name of Bessel when Doctor Paget interrupted him. "Last night
  &mdash;just at the end," he said, "we had a communication."</p>

  <p>He left the room, and returned with a slate on which were certain words
  written in a handwriting, shaky indeed, but indisputably the handwriting of
  Mr. Bessel!</p>

  <p>"How did you get this?" said Mr. Vincey. "Do you mean&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"We got it last night," said Doctor Paget. With numerous interruptions
  from Mr. Vincey, he proceeded to explain how the writing had been obtained.
  It appears that in her seances, Mrs. Bullock passes into a condition of
  trance, her eyes rolling up in a strange way under her eyelids, and her body
  becoming rigid. She then begins to talk very rapidly, usually in voices other
  than her own. At the same time one or both of her hands may become active,
  and if slates and pencils are provided they will then write messages
  simultaneously with and quite independently of the flow of words from her
  mouth. By many she is considered an even more remarkable medium than the
  celebrated Mrs. Piper. It was one of these messages, the one written by her
  left hand, that Mr. Vincey now had before him. It consisted of eight words
  written disconnectedly: "George Bessel...trial excavn... Baker Street ...
  help...starvation." Curiously enough, neither Doctor Paget nor the two other
  inquirers who were present had heard of the disappearance of Mr.
  Bessel&mdash;the news of it appeared only in the evening papers of
  Saturday&mdash;and they had put the message aside with many others of a vague
  and enigmatical sort that Mrs. Bullock has from time to time delivered.</p>

  <p>When Doctor Paget heard Mr. Vincey's story, he gave himself at once with
  great energy to the pursuit of this clue to the discovery of Mr. Bessel. It
  would serve no useful purpose here to describe the inquiries of Mr. Vincey
  and himself; suffice it that the clue was a genuine one, and that Mr. Bessel
  was actually discovered by its aid.</p>

  <p>He was found at the bottom of a detached shaft which had been sunk and
  abandoned at the commencement of the work for the new electric railway near
  Baker Street Station. His arm and leg and two ribs were broken. The shaft is
  protected by a hoarding nearly 20 feet high, and over this, incredible as it
  seems, Mr. Bessel, a stout, middle-aged gentleman, must have scrambled in
  order to fall down the shaft. He was saturated in colza oil, and the smashed
  tin lay beside him, but luckily the flame had been extinguished by his fall.
  And his madness had passed from him altogether. But he was, of course,
  terribly enfeebled, and at the sight of his rescuers he gave way to
  hysterical weeping.</p>

  <p>In view of the deplorable state of his flat, he was taken to the house of
  Dr. Hatton in Upper Baker Street. Here he was subjected to a sedative
  treatment, and anything that might recall the violent crisis through which he
  had passed was carefully avoided. But on the second day he volunteered a
  statement.</p>

  <p>Since that occasion Mr. Bessel has several times repeated this statement
  &mdash;to myself among other people&mdash;varying the details as the narrator
  of real experiences always does, but never by any chance contradicting
  himself in any particular. And the statement he makes is in substance as
  follows.</p>

  <p>In order to understand it clearly it is necessary to go back to his
  experiments with Mr. Vincey before his remarkable attack. Mr. Bessel's first
  attempts at self-projection, in his experiments with Mr. Vincey, were, as the
  reader will remember, unsuccessful. But through all of them he was
  concentrating all his power and will upon getting out of the
  body&mdash;"willing it with all my might," he says. At last, almost against
  expectation, came success. And Mr. Bessel asserts that he, being alive, did
  actually, by an effort of will, leave his body and pass into some place or
  state outside this world.</p>

  <p>The release was, he asserts, instantaneous. "At one moment I was seated in
  my chair, with my eyes tightly shut, my hands gripping the arms of the chair,
  doing all I could to concentrate my mind on Vincey, and then I perceived
  myself outside my body&mdash;saw my body near me, but certainly not
  containing me, with the hands relaxing and the head drooping forward on the
  breast."</p>

  <p>Nothing shakes him in his assurance of that release. He describes in a
  quiet, matter-of-fact way the new sensation he experienced. He felt he had
  become impalpable&mdash;so much he had expected, but he had not expected to
  find himself enormously large. So, however, it would seem he became. "I was a
  great cloud&mdash;if I may express it that way&mdash;anchored to my body. It
  appeared to me, at first, as if I had discovered a greater self of which the
  conscious being in my brain was only a little part. I saw the Albany and
  Piccadilly and Regent Street and all the rooms and places in the houses, very
  minute and very bright and distinct, spread out below me like a little city
  seen from a balloon. Every now and then vague shapes like drifting wreaths of
  smoke made the vision a little indistinct, but at first I paid little heed to
  them. The thing that astonished me most, and which astonishes me still, is
  that I saw quite distinctly the insides of the houses as well as the streets,
  saw little people dining and talking in the private houses, men and women
  dining, playing billiards, and drinking in restaurants and hotels, and
  several places of entertainment crammed with people. It was like watching the
  affairs of a glass hive."</p>

  <p>Such were Mr. Bessel's exact words as I took them down when he told me the
  story. Quite forgetful of Mr. Vincey, he remained for a space observing these
  things. Impelled by curiosity, he says, he stooped down, and, with the
  shadowy arm he found himself possessed of, attempted to touch a man walking
  along Vigo Street. But he could not do so, though his finger seemed to pass
  through the man. Something prevented his doing this, but what it was he finds
  it hard to describe. He compares the obstacle to a sheet of glass.</p>

  <p>"I felt as a kitten may feel," he said, "when it goes for the first time
  to pat its reflection in a mirror." Again and again, on the occasion when I
  heard him tell this story, Mr. Bessel returned to that comparison of the
  sheet of glass. Yet it was not altogether a precise comparison, because, as
  the reader will speedily see, there were interruptions of this generally
  impermeable resistance, means of getting through the barrier to the material
  world again. But, naturally, there is a very great difficulty in expressing
  these unprecedented impressions in the language of everyday experience.</p>

  <p>A thing that impressed him instantly, and which weighed upon him
  throughout all this experience, was the stillness of this place&mdash;he was
  in a world without sound.</p>

  <p>At first Mr. Bessel's mental state was an unemotional wonder. His thought
  chiefly concerned itself with where he might be. He was out of the
  body&mdash;out of his material body, at any rate&mdash;but that was not all.
  He believes, and I for one believe also, that he was somewhere out of space,
  as we understand it, altogether. By a strenuous effort of will he had passed
  out of his body into a world beyond this world, a world undreamt of, yet
  lying so close to it and so strangely situated with regard to it that all
  things on this earth are clearly visible both from without and from within in
  this other world about us. For a long time, as it seemed to him, this
  realisation occupied his mind to the exclusion of all other matters, and then
  he recalled the engagement with Mr. Vincey, to which this astonishing
  experience was, after all, but a prelude.</p>

  <p>He turned his mind to locomotion in this new body in which he found
  himself. For a time he was unable to shift himself from his attachment to his
  earthly carcass. For a time this new strange cloud body of his simply swayed,
  contracted, expanded, coiled, and writhed with his efforts to free himself,
  and then quite suddenly the link that bound him snapped. For a moment
  everything was hidden by what appeared to be whirling spheres of dark vapour,
  and then through a momentary gap he saw his drooping body collapse limply,
  saw his lifeless head drop sideways, and found he was driving along like a
  huge cloud in a strange place of shadowy clouds that had the luminous
  intricacy of London spread like a model below.</p>

  <p>But now he was aware that the fluctuating vapour about him was something
  more than vapour, and the temerarious excitement of his first essay was shot
  with fear. For he perceived, at first indistinctly, and then suddenly very
  clearly, that he was surrounded by FACES! that each roll and coil of the
  seeming cloud-stuff was a face. And such faces! Faces of thin shadow, faces
  of gaseous tenuity. Faces like those faces that glare with intolerable
  strangeness upon the sleeper in the evil hours of his dreams. Evil, greedy
  eyes that were full of a covetous curiosity, faces with knit brows and
  snarling, smiling lips; their vague hands clutched at Mr. Bessel as he
  passed, and the rest of their bodies was but an elusive streak of trailing
  darkness. Never a word they said, never a sound from the mouths that seemed
  to gibber. All about him they pressed in that dreamy silence, passing freely
  through the dim mistiness that was his body, gathering ever more numerously
  about him. And the shadowy Mr. Bessel, now suddenly fear-stricken, drove
  through the silent, active multitude of eyes and clutching hands.</p>

  <p>So inhuman were these faces, so malignant their staring eyes, and shadowy,
  clawing gestures, that it did not occur to Mr. Bessel to attempt intercourse
  with these drifting creatures. Idiot phantoms, they seemed, children of vain
  desire, beings unborn and forbidden the boon of being, whose only expressions
  and gestures told of the envy and craving for life that was their one link
  with existence.</p>

  <p>It says much for his resolution that, amidst the swarming cloud of these
  noiseless spirits of evil, he could still think of Mr. Vincey. He made a
  violent effort of will and found himself, he knew not how, stooping towards
  Staple Inn, saw Vincey sitting attentive and alert in his arm-chair by the
  fire.</p>

  <p>And clustering also about him, as they clustered ever about all that lives
  and breathes, was another multitude of these vain voiceless shadows, longing,
  desiring, seeking some loophole into life.</p>

  <p>For a space Mr. Bessel sought ineffectually to attract his friend's
  attention. He tried to get in front of his eyes, to move the objects in his
  room, to touch him. But Mr. Vincey remained unaffected, ignorant of the being
  that was so close to his own. The strange something that Mr. Bessel has
  compared to a sheet of glass separated them impermeably.</p>

  <p>And at last Mr. Bessel did a desperate thing. I have told how that in some
  strange way he could see not only the outside of a man as we see him, but
  within. He extended his shadowy hand and thrust his vague black fingers, as
  it seemed, through the heedless brain.</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly, Mr. Vincey started like a man who recalls his attention
  from wandering thoughts, and it seemed to Mr. Bessel that a little dark-red
  body situated in the middle of Mr. Vincey's brain swelled and glowed as he
  did so. Since that experience he has been shown anatomical figures of the
  brain, and he knows now that this is that useless structure, as doctors call
  it, the pineal eye. For, strange as it will seem to many, we have, deep in
  our brains&mdash;where it cannot possibly see any earthly light&mdash;an eye!
  At the time this, with the rest of the internal anatomy of the brain, was
  quite new to him. At the sight of its changed appearance, however, he thrust
  forth his finger, and, rather fearful still of the consequences, touched this
  little spot. And instantly Mr. Vincey started, and Mr. Bessel knew that he
  was seen.</p>

  <p>And at that instant it came to Mr. Bessel that evil had happened to his
  body, and behold! a great wind blew through all that world of shadows and
  tore him away. So strong was this persuasion that he thought no more of Mr.
  Vincey, but turned about forthwith, and all the countless faces drove back
  with him like leaves before a gale. But he returned too late. In an instant
  he saw the body that he had left inert and collapsed&mdash;lying, indeed,
  like the body of a man just dead&mdash;had arisen, had arisen by virtue of
  some strength and will beyond his own. It stood with staring eyes, stretching
  its limbs in dubious fashion.</p>

  <p>For a moment he watched it in wild dismay, and then he stooped towards it.
  But the pane of glass had closed against him again, and he was foiled. He
  beat himself passionately against this, and all about him the spirits of evil
  grinned and pointed and mocked. He gave way to furious anger. He compares
  himself to a bird that has fluttered heedlessly into a room and is beating at
  the window-pane that holds it back from freedom.</p>

  <p>And behold! the little body that had once been his was now dancing with
  delight. He saw it shouting, though he could not hear its shouts; he saw the
  violence of its movements grow. He watched it fling his cherished furniture
  about in the mad delight of existence, rend his books apart, smash bottles,
  drink heedlessly from the jagged fragments, leap and smite in a passionate
  acceptance of living. He watched these actions in paralysed astonishment.
  Then once more he hurled himself against the impassable barrier, and then
  with all that crew of mocking ghosts about him, hurried back in dire
  confusion to Vincey to tell him of the outrage that had come upon him.</p>

  <p>But the brain of Vincey was now closed against apparitions, and the
  disembodied Mr. Bessel pursued him in vain as he hurried out into Holborn to
  call a cab. Foiled and terror-stricken, Mr. Bessel swept back again, to find
  his desecrated body whooping in a glorious frenzy down the Burlington
  Arcade...</p>

  <p>And now the attentive reader begins to understand Mr. Bessel's
  interpretation of the first part of this strange story. The being whose
  frantic rush through London had inflicted so much injury and disaster had
  indeed Mr. Bessel's body, but it was not Mr. Bessel. It was an evil spirit
  out of that strange world beyond existence, into which Mr. Bessel had so
  rashly ventured. For twenty hours it held possession of him, and for all
  those twenty hours the dispossessed spirit-body of Mr. Bessel was going to
  and fro in that unheard-of middle world of shadows seeking help in vain. He
  spent many hours beating at the minds of Mr. Vincey and of his friend Mr.
  Hart. Each, as we know, he roused by his efforts. But the language that might
  convey his situation to these helpers across the gulf he did not know; his
  feeble fingers groped vainly and powerlessly in their brains. Once, indeed,
  as we have already told, he was able to turn Mr. Vincey aside from his path
  so that he encountered the stolen body in its career, but he could not make
  him understand the thing that had happened: he was unable to draw any help
  from that encounter...</p>

  <p>All through those hours the persuasion was overwhelming in Mr. Bessel's
  mind that presently his body would be killed by its furious tenant, and he
  would have to remain in this shadow-land for evermore. So that those long
  hours were a growing agony of fear. And ever as he hurried to and fro in his
  ineffectual excitement, innumerable spirits of that world about him mobbed
  him and confused his mind. And ever an envious applauding multitude poured
  after their successful fellow as he went upon his glorious career.</p>

  <p>For that, it would seem, must be the life of these bodiless things of this
  world that is the shadow of our world. Ever they watch, coveting a way into a
  mortal body, in order that they may descend, as furies and frenzies, as
  violent lusts and mad, strange impulses, rejoicing in the body they have won.
  For Mr. Bessel was not the only human soul in that place. Witness the fact
  that he met first one, and afterwards several shadows of men, men like
  himself, it seemed, who had lost their bodies even it may be as he had lost
  his, and wandered, despairingly, in that lost world that is neither life nor
  death. They could not speak because that world is silent, yet he knew them
  for men because of their dim human bodies, and because of the sadness of
  their faces.</p>

  <p>But how they had come into that world he could not tell, nor where the
  bodies they had lost might be, whether they still raved about the earth, or
  whether they were closed forever in death against return. That they were the
  spirits of the dead neither he nor I believe. But Doctor Wilson Paget thinks
  they are the rational souls of men who are lost in madness on the earth.</p>

  <p>At last Mr. Bessel chanced upon a place where a little crowd of such
  disembodied silent creatures was gathered, and thrusting through them he saw
  below a brightly-lit room, and four or five quiet gentlemen and a woman, a
  stoutish woman dressed in black bombazine and sitting awkwardly in a chair
  with her head thrown back. He knew her from her portraits to be Mrs. Bullock,
  the medium. And he perceived that tracts and structures in her brain glowed
  and stirred as he had seen the pineal eye in the brain of Mr. Vincey glow.
  The light was very fitful; sometimes it was a broad illumination, and
  sometimes merely a faint twilight spot, and it shifted slowly about her
  brain. She kept on talking and writing with one hand. And Mr. Bessel saw that
  the crowding shadows of men about him, and a great multitude of the shadow
  spirits of that shadowland, were all striving and thrusting to touch the
  lighted regions of her brain. As one gained her brain or another was thrust
  away, her voice and the writing of her hand changed. So that what she said
  was disorderly and confused for the most part; now a fragment of one soul's
  message, and now a fragment of another's, and now she babbled the insane
  fancies of the spirits of vain desire. Then Mr. Bessel understood that she
  spoke for the spirit that had touch of her, and he began to struggle very
  furiously towards her. But he was on the outside of the crowd and at that
  time he could not reach her, and at last, growing anxious, he went away to
  find what had happened meanwhile to his body. For a long time he went to and
  fro seeking it in vain and fearing that it must have been killed, and then he
  found it at the bottom of the shaft in Baker Street, writhing furiously and
  cursing with pain. Its leg and an arm and two ribs had been broken by its
  fall. Moreover, the evil spirit was angry because his time had been so short
  and because of the painmaking violent movements and casting his body
  about.</p>

  <p>And at that Mr. Bessel returned with redoubled earnestness to the room
  where the seance was going on, and so soon as he had thrust himself within
  sight of the place he saw one of the men who stood about the medium looking
  at his watch as if he meant that the seance should presently end. At that a
  great number of the shadows who had been striving turned away with gestures
  of despair. But the thought that the seance was almost over only made Mr.
  Bessel the more earnest, and he struggled so stoutly with his will against
  the others that presently he gained the woman's brain. It chanced that just
  at that moment it glowed very brightly, and in that instant she wrote the
  message that Doctor Wilson Paget preserved. And then the other shadows and
  the cloud of evil spirits about him had thrust Mr. Bessel away from her, and
  for all the rest of the seance he could regain her no more.</p>

  <p>So he went back and watched through the long hours at the bottom of the
  shaft where the evil spirit lay in the stolen body it had maimed, writhing
  and cursing, and weeping and groaning, and learning the lesson of pain. And
  towards dawn the thing he had waited for happened, the brain glowed brightly
  and the evil spirit came out, and Mr. Bessel entered the body he had feared
  he should never enter again. As he did so, the silence&mdash;the brooding
  silence&mdash;ended; he heard the tumult of traffic and the voices of people
  overhead, and that strange world that is the shadow of our world&mdash;the
  dark and silent shadows of ineffectual desire and the shadows of lost men
  &mdash;vanished clean away.</p>

  <p>He lay there for the space of about three hours before he was found. And
  in spite of the pain and suffering of his wounds, and of the dim damp place
  in which he lay; in spite of the tears&mdash;wrung from him by his physical
  distress&mdash;his heart was full of gladness to know that he was
  nevertheless back once more in the kindly world of men.</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Graphic</i>, December 1898</h3>

  <p>"It isn't every one who's been a god," said the sunburnt man. "But it's
  happened to me. Among other things."</p>

  <p>I intimated my sense of his condescension.</p>

  <p>"It don't leave much for ambition, does it?" said the sunburnt man.</p>

  <p>"I was one of those men who were saved from the Ocean Pioneer. Gummy! how
  time flies! It's twenty years ago. I doubt if you'll remember anything of the
  Ocean Pioneer?"</p>

  <p>The name was familiar, and I tried to recall when and where I had read it.
  The Ocean Pioneer? "Something about gold dust," I said vaguely, "but the
  precise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's it," he said. "In a beastly little channel she hadn't no business
  in&mdash;dodging pirates. It was before they'd put the kybosh on that
  business. And there'd been volcanoes or something and all the rocks was
  wrong. There's places about by Soona where you fair have to follow the rocks
  about to see where they're going next. Down she went in twenty fathoms before
  you could have dealt for whist, with fifty thousand pounds worth of gold
  aboard, it was said, in one form or another."</p>

  <p>"Survivors?"</p>

  <p>"Three."</p>

  <p>"I remember the case now," I said. "There was something about
  salvage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But at the word salvage the sunburnt man exploded into language so
  extraordinarily horrible that I stopped aghast. He came down to more ordinary
  swearing, and pulled himself up abruptly. "Excuse me," he said,
  "but&mdash;salvage!"</p>

  <p>He leant over towards me. "I was in that job," he said. "Tried to make
  myself a rich man, and got made a god instead. I've got my
  feelings&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It ain't all jam being a god," said the sunburnt man, and for some time
  conversed by means of such pithy but unprogressive axioms. At last he took up
  his tale again.</p>

  <p>"There was me," said the sunburnt man, "and a seaman named Jacobs, and
  Always, the mate of the Ocean Pioneer. And him it was that set the whole
  thing going. I remember him now, when we was in the jolly-boat, suggesting it
  all to our minds just by one sentence. He was a wonderful hand at suggesting
  things. 'There was forty thousand pounds,' he said, 'on that ship, and it's
  for me to say just where she went down.' It didn't need much brains to tumble
  to that. And he was the leader from the first to the last. He got hold of the
  Sanderses and their brig; they were brothers, and the brig was the Pride of
  Banya, and he it was bought the diving-dress&mdash;a second-hand one with a
  compressed air apparatus instead of pumping. He'd have done the diving too,
  if it hadn't made him sick going down. And the salvage people were mucking
  about with a chart he'd cooked up, as solemn as could be, at Starr Race, a
  hundred and twenty miles away.</p>

  <p>"I can tell you we was a happy lot aboard that brig, jokes and drink and
  bright hopes all the time. It all seemed so neat and clean and
  straightforward, and what rough chaps call a 'cert.' And we used to speculate
  how the other blessed lot, the proper salvagers, who'd started two days
  before us, were getting on, until our sides fairly ached. We all messed
  together in the Sanderses' cabin&mdash;it was a curious crew, all officers
  and no men&mdash;and there stood the diving-dress waiting its turn. Young
  Sanders was a humorous sort of chap, and there certainly was something funny
  in the confounded thing's great fat head and its stare, and he made us see it
  too. 'Jimmie Goggles,' he used to call it, and talk to it like a Christian.
  Asked if he was married, and how Mrs. Goggles was, and all the little
  Goggleses. Fit to make you split. And every blessed day all of us used to
  drink the health of Jimmy Goggles in rum, and unscrew his eye and pour a
  glass of rum in him, until, instead of that nasty mackintosheriness, he smelt
  as nice in his inside as a cask of rum. It was jolly times we had in those
  days, I can tell you&mdash;little suspecting, poor chaps! what was
  a-coming.</p>

  <p>"We weren't going to throw away our chances by any blessed hurry, you
  know, and we spent a whole day sounding our way towards where the Ocean
  Pioneer had gone down, right between two chunks of ropy grey rock&mdash;lava
  rocks that rose nearly out of the water. We had to lay off about half a mile
  to get a safe anchorage, and there was a thundering row who should stop on
  board. And there she lay just as she had gone down, so that you could see the
  top of the masts that was still standing perfectly distinctly. The row ending
  in all coming in the boat. I went down in the diving-dress on Friday morning
  directly it was light.</p>

  <p>"What a surprise it was! I can see it all now quite distinctly. It was a
  queer-looking place, and the light was just coming. People over here think
  every blessed place in the tropics is a flat shore and palm trees and surf,
  bless 'em! This place, for instance, wasn't a bit that way. Not common rocks
  they were, undermined by waves; but great curved banks like ironwork cinder
  heaps, with green slime below, and thorny shrubs and things just waving upon
  them here and there, and the water glassy calm and clear, and showing you a
  kind of dirty grey-black shine, with huge flaring red-brown weeds spreading
  motionless, and crawling and darting things going through it. And far away
  beyond the ditches and pools and the heaps was a forest on the mountain
  flank, growing again after the fires and cinder showers of the last eruption.
  And the other way forest, too, and a kind of broken&mdash;what is
  it?&mdash;ambytheatre of black and rusty cinders rising out of it all, and
  the sea in a kind of bay in the middle.</p>

  <p>"The dawn, I say, was just coming, and there wasn't much colour about
  things, and not a human being but ourselves anywhere in sight up or down the
  channel. Except the Pride of Banya, lying out beyond a lump of rocks towards
  the line of the sea.</p>

  <p>"Not a human being in sight," he repeated, and paused.</p>

  <p>"I don't know where they came from, not a bit. And we were feeling so safe
  that we were all alone that poor young Sanders was a-singing. I was in Jimmy
  Goggles, all except the helmet. 'Easy,' says Always, 'there's her mast.' And
  after I'd had just one squint over the gunwale, I caught up the bogey and
  almost tipped out as old Sanders brought the boat round. When the windows
  were screwed and everything was all right, I shut the valve from the air belt
  in order to help my sinking, and jumped overboard, feet foremost&mdash;for we
  hadn't a ladder. I left the boat pitching, and all of them staring down into
  the water after me, as my head sank down into the weeds and blackness that
  lay about the mast. I suppose nobody, not the most cautious chap in the
  world, would have bothered about a lookout at such a desolate place. It stunk
  of solitude.</p>

  <p>"Of course you must understand that I was a greenhorn at diving. None of
  us were divers. We'd had to muck about with the thing to get the way of it,
  and this was the first time I'd been deep. It feels damnable. Your ears hurt
  beastly. I don't know if you've ever hurt yourself yawning or sneezing, but
  it takes you like that, only ten times worse. And a pain over the eyebrows
  here&mdash;splitting&mdash;and a feeling like influenza in the head. And it
  isn't all heaven in your lungs and things. And going down feels like the
  beginning of a lift, only it keeps on. And you can't turn your head to see
  what's above you, and you can't get a fair squint at what's happening to your
  feet without bending down something painful. And being deep it was dark, let
  alone the blackness of the ashes and mud that formed the bottom. It was like
  going down out of the dawn back into the night, so to speak.</p>

  <p>"The mast came up like a ghost out of the black, and then a lot of fishes,
  and then a lot of flapping red seaweed, and then whack I came with a kind of
  dull bang on the deck of the Ocean Pioneer, and the fishes that had been
  feeding on the dead rose about me like a swarm of flies from road stuff in
  summer time. I turned on the compressed air again&mdash;for the suit was a
  bit thick and mackintoshery after all, in spite of the rum&mdash;and stood
  recovering myself. It struck coolish down there, and that helped take off the
  stuffiness a bit.</p>

  <p>"When I began to feel easier, I started looking about me. It was an
  extraordinary sight. Even the light was extraordinary, a kind of
  reddy-coloured twilight, on account of the streamers of seaweed that floated
  up on either side of the ship. And far overhead just a moony, deep
  green-blue. The deck of the ship, except for a slight list to starboard, was
  level, and lay all dark and long between the weeds, clear except where the
  masts had snapped when she rolled, and vanishing into black night towards the
  forecastle. There wasn't any dead on the decks, most were in the weeds
  alongside, I suppose; but afterwards I found two skeletons lying in the
  passengers' cabins, where death had come to them. It was curious to stand on
  that deck and recognise it all, bit by bit; a place against the rail where
  I'd been fond of smoking by starlight, and the corner where an old chap from
  Sydney used to flirt with a widow we had aboard. A comfortable couple they'd
  been, only a month ago, and now you couldn't have got a meal for a baby crab
  off either of them.</p>

  <p>"I've always had a bit of a philosophical turn, and I dare say I spent the
  best part of five minutes in such thoughts before I went below to find where
  the blessed dust was stored. It was slow work hunting, feeling it was for the
  most part, pitchy dark, with confusing blue gleams down the companion. And
  there were things moving about, a dab at my glass once, and once a pinch at
  my leg. Crabs, I expect. I kicked a lot of loose stuff that puzzled me, and
  stooped and picked up something all knobs and spikes. What do you think?
  Backbone! But I never had any particular feeling for bones. We had talked the
  affair over pretty thoroughly, and Always knew just where the stuff was
  stowed. I found it that trip. I lifted a box one end an inch or more."</p>

  <p>He broke off in his story. "I've lifted it," he said, "as near as that!
  Forty thousand pounds worth of pure gold! Gold! I shouted inside my helmet as
  a kind of cheer and hurt my ears. I was getting confounded stuffy and tired
  by this time&mdash;I must have been down twenty-five minutes or
  more&mdash;and I thought this was good enough. I went up the companion again,
  and as my eyes came up flush with the deck, a thundering great crab gave a
  kind of hysterical jump and went scuttling off sideways. Quite a start it
  gave me. I stood up clear on deck and shut the valve behind the helmet to let
  the air accumulate to carry me up again&mdash;I noticed a kind of whacking
  from above, as though they were hitting the water with an oar, but I didn't
  look up. I fancied they were signalling me to come up.</p>

  <p>"And then something shot down by me&mdash;something heavy, and stood a-
  quiver in the planks. I looked, and there was a long knife I'd seen young
  Sanders handling. Thinks I, he's dropped it, and I was still calling him this
  kind of fool and that&mdash;for it might have hurt me serious&mdash;when I
  began to lift and drive up towards the daylight. Just about the level of the
  top spars of the Ocean Pioneer, whack! I came against something sinking down,
  and a boot knocked in front of my helmet. Then something else, struggling
  frightful. It was a big weight atop of me, whatever it was, and moving and
  twisting about. I'd have thought it a big octopus, or some such thing, if it
  hadn't been for the boot. But octopuses don't wear boots. It was all in a
  moment, of course. I felt myself sinking down again, and I threw my arms
  about to keep steady, and the whole lot rolled free of me and shot down as I
  went up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"I saw young Sanders's face, over a naked black shoulder, and a spear
  driven clean through his neck, and out of his mouth and neck what looked like
  spirts of pink smoke in the water. And down they went clutching one another,
  and turning over, and both too far gone to leave go. And in another second my
  helmet came a whack, fit to split, against the niggers' canoe. It was
  niggers! Two canoes full.</p>

  <p>"It was lively times, I tell you! Overboard came Always with three spears
  in him. There was the legs of three or four black chaps kicking about me in
  the water. I couldn't see much, but I saw the game was up at a glance, gave
  my valve a tremendous twist, and went bubbling down again after poor Always,
  in as awful a state of scare and astonishment as you can well imagine. I
  passed young Sanders and the nigger going up again and struggling still a
  bit, and in another moment I was standing in the dim again on the deck of the
  Ocean Pioneer.</p>

  <p>"'Gummy,' thinks I, 'here's a fix!' Niggers? At first I couldn't see
  anything for it but Stifle below or Stabs above. I didn't properly understand
  how much air there was to last me, but I didn't feel like standing very much
  more of it down below. I was hot and frightfully heady&mdash;quite apart from
  the blue funk I was in. We'd never repined with these beastly natives, filthy
  Papuan beasts. It wasn't any good, coming up where I was, but I had to do
  something. On the spur of the moment, I clambered over the side of the brig
  and landed among the weeds, and set off through the darkness as fast as I
  could. I just stopped once and knelt, and twisted back my head in the helmet
  and had a look up. It was a most extraordinary bright green-blue above, and
  the two canoes and the boat floating there very small and distant like a kind
  of twisted H. And it made me feel sick to squint up at it, and think what the
  pitching and swaying of the three meant.</p>

  <p>"It was just about the most horrible ten minutes I ever had, blundering
  about in that darkness, pressure something awful, like being buried in sand,
  pain across the chest, sick with funk, and breathing nothing as it seemed but
  the smell of rum and mackintosh. Gummy! After a bit, I found myself going up
  a steepish sort of slope. I had another squint to see if anything was visible
  of the canoes and boats, and then kept on. I stopped with my head a foot from
  the surface, and tried to see where I was going, but, of course, nothing was
  to be seen but the reflection of the bottom. Then out I dashed like knocking
  my head through a mirror. Directly I got my eyes out of the water, I saw I'd
  come up a kind of beach near the forest. I had a look round, but the natives
  and the brig were both hidden by a big, hummucky heap of twisted lava, the
  born fool in me suggested a run for the woods. I didn't take the helmet off,
  but eased open one of the windows, and, after a bit of a pant, went on out of
  the water. You'd hardly imagine how clean and light the air tasted.</p>

  <p>"Of course, with four inches of lead in your boot soles, and your head in
  a copper knob the size of a football, and been thirty-five minutes under
  water, you don't break any records running. I ran like a ploughboy going to
  work. And half way to the trees I saw a dozen niggers or more, coming out in
  a gaping, astonished sort of way to meet me.</p>

  <p>"I just stopped dead, and cursed myself for all the fools out of London. I
  had about as much chance of cutting back to the water as a turned turtle. I
  just screwed up my window again to leave my hands free, and waited for them.
  There wasn't anything else for me to do.</p>

  <p>"But they didn't come on very much. I began to suspect why. 'Jimmy
  Goggles,' I says, 'it's your beauty does it.' I was inclined to be a little
  light-headed, I think, with all these dangers about and the change in the
  pressure of the blessed air. 'Who're ye staring at?' I said, as if the
  savages could hear me. 'What d'ye take me for? I'm hanged if I don't give you
  something to stare at,' I said, and with that I screwed up the escape valve
  and turned on the compressed air from the belt, until I was swelled out like
  a blown frog. Regular imposing it must have been. I'm blessed if they'd come
  on a step; and presently one and then another went down on their hands and
  knees. They didn't know what to make of me, and they was doing the extra
  polite, which was very wise and reasonable of them. I had half a mind to edge
  back seaward and cut and run, but it seemed too hopeless. A step back and
  they'd have been after me. And out of sheer desperation I began to march
  towards them up the beach, with slow, heavy steps, and waving my blown-out
  arms about, in a dignified manner. And inside of me I was singing as small as
  a tomtit.</p>

  <p>"But there's nothing like a striking appearance to help a man over a
  difficulty,&mdash;I've found that before and since. People like ourselves,
  who're up to diving-dresses by the time we're seven, can scarcely imagine the
  effect of one on a simple-minded savage. One or two of these niggers cut and
  run, the others started in a great hurry trying to knock their brains out on
  the ground. And on I went as slow and solemn and silly-looking and artful as
  a jobbing plumber. It was evident they took me for something immense.</p>

  <p>"Then up jumped one and began pointing, making extraordinary gestures to
  me as he did so, and all the others began sharing their attention between me
  and something out at sea. 'What's the matter now?' I said. I turned slowly on
  account of my dignity, and there I saw, coming round a point, the poor old
  Pride of Banya towed by a couple of canoes. The sight fairly made me sick.
  But they evidently expected some recognition, so I waved my arms in a
  striking sort of non-committal manner. And then I turned and stalked on
  towards the trees again. At that time I was praying like mad, I remember,
  over and over again: 'Lord help me through with it! Lord help me through with
  it!' It's only fools who know nothing of dangers can afford to laugh at
  praying.</p>

  <p>"But these niggers weren't going to let me walk through and away like
  that. They started a kind of bowing dance about me, and sort of pressed me to
  take a pathway that lay through the trees. It was clear to me they didn't
  take me for a British citizen, whatever else they thought of me, and for my
  own part I was never less anxious to own up to the old country.</p>

  <p>"You'd hardly believe it, perhaps, unless you're familiar with savages,
  but these poor misguided, ignorant creatures took me straight to their kind
  of joss place to present me to the blessed old black stone there. By this
  time I was beginning to sort of realise the depth of their ignorance, and
  directly I set eyes on this deity I took my cue. I started a baritone howl,
  'wow-wow,' very long on one note, and began waving my arms about a lot, and
  then very slowly and ceremoniously turned their image over on its side and
  sat down on it. I wanted to sit down badly, for diving-dresses ain't much
  wear in the tropics. Or, to put it different like, they're a sight too much.
  It took away their breath, I could see, my sitting on their joss, but in less
  time than a minute they made up their minds and were hard at work worshipping
  me. And I can tell you I felt a bit relieved to see things turning out so
  well, in spite of the weight on my shoulders and feet.</p>

  <p>"But what made me anxious was what the chaps in the canoes might think
  when they came back. If they'd seen me in the boat before I went down, and
  without the helmet on&mdash;for they might have been spying and hiding since
  over night&mdash;they would very likely take a different view from the
  others. I was in a deuce of a stew about that for hours, as it seemed, until
  the shindy of the arrival began.</p>

  <p>"But they took it down&mdash;the whole blessed village took it down. At
  the cost of sitting up stiff and stern, as much like those sitting Egyptian
  images one sees as I could manage, for pretty nearly twelve hours, I should
  guess at least, on end, I got over it. You'd hardly think what it meant in
  that heat and stink. I don't think any of them dreamt of the man inside. I
  was just a wonderful leathery great joss that had come up with luck out of
  the water. But the fatigue! the heat! the beastly closeness! the
  mackintosheriness and the rum! and the fuss! They lit a stinking fire on a
  kind of lava slab there was before me, and brought in a lot of gory
  muck&mdash;the worst parts of what they were feasting on outside, the
  Beasts&mdash;and burnt it all in my honour. I was getting a bit hungry, but I
  understand now how gods manage to do without eating, what with the smell of
  burnt offerings about them. And they brought in a lot of the stuff they'd got
  off the brig and, among other stuff, what I was a bit relieved to see, the
  kind of pneumatic pump that was used for the compressed air affair, and then
  a lot of chaps and girls came in and danced about me something disgraceful.
  It's extraordinary the different ways different people have of showing
  respect. If I'd had a hatchet handy I'd have gone for the lot of
  them&mdash;they made me feel that wild. All this time I sat as stiff as
  company, not knowing anything better to do. And at last, when nightfall came,
  and the wattle joss-house place got a bit too shadowy for their
  taste&mdash;all these here savages are afraid of the dark, you know&mdash;and
  I started a sort of 'Moo' noise, they built big bonfires outside and left me
  alone in peace in the darkness of my hut, free to unscrew my windows a bit
  and think things over, and feel just as bad as I liked. And, Lord! I was
  sick.</p>

  <p>"I was weak and hungry, and my mind kept on behaving like a beetle on a
  pin, tremendous activity and nothing done at the end of it. Come round just
  where it was before. There was sorrowing for the other chaps, beastly
  drunkards certainly, but not deserving such a fate, and young Sanders with
  the spear through his neck wouldn't go out of my mind. There was the treasure
  down there in the Ocean Pioneer, and how one might get it and hide it
  somewhere safer, and get away and come back for it. And there was the puzzle
  where to get anything to eat. I tell you I was fair rambling. I was afraid to
  ask by signs for food, for fear of behaving too human, and so there I sat and
  hungered until very near the dawn. Then the village got a bit quiet, and I
  couldn't stand it any longer, and I went out and got some stuff like
  artichokes in a bowl and some sour milk. What was left of these I put away
  among the other offerings, just to give them a hint of my tastes. And in the
  morning they came to worship, and found me sitting up stiff and respectable
  on their previous god, just as they'd left me overnight. I'd got my back
  against the central pillar of the hut, and, practically, I was asleep. And
  that's how I became a god among the heathen&mdash;a false god no doubt, and
  blasphemous, but one can't always pick and choose.</p>

  <p>"Now, I don't want to crack myself up as a god beyond my merits, but I
  must confess that while I was god to these people they was extraordinary
  successful. I don't say there's anything in it, mind you. They won a battle
  with another tribe&mdash;I got a lot of offerings I didn't want through it
  &mdash;they had wonderful fishing, and their crop of pourra was exceptional
  fine. And they counted the capture of the brig among the benefits I brought
  'em. I must say I don't think that was a poor record for a perfectly new
  hand. And, though perhaps you'd scarcely credit it, I was the tribal god of
  those beastly savages for pretty nearly four months...</p>

  <p>"What else could I do, man? But I didn't wear that diving-dress all the
  time. I made 'em rig me up a sort of holy of holies, and a deuce of a time I
  had too, making them understand what it was I wanted them to do. That indeed
  was the great difficulty&mdash;making them understand my wishes. I couldn't
  let myself down by talking their lingo badly&mdash;even if I'd been able to
  speak at all&mdash;and I couldn't go flapping a lot of gestures at them. So I
  drew pictures in sand and sat down beside them and hooted like one o'clock.
  Sometimes they did the things I wanted all right, and sometimes they did them
  all wrong. They was always very willing, certainly. All the while I was
  puzzling how I was to get the confounded business settled. Every night before
  the dawn I used to march out in full rig and go off to a place where I could
  see the channel in which the Ocean Pioneer lay sunk, and once even, one
  moonlight night, I tried to walk out to her, but the weeds and rocks and dark
  clean beat me. I didn't get back till full day, and then I found all those
  silly niggers out on the beach praying their sea-god to return to them. I was
  that vexed and tired, messing and tumbling about, and coming up and going
  down again, I could have punched their silly heads all round when they
  started rejoicing. I'm hanged if I like so much ceremony.</p>

  <p>"And then came the missionary. That missionary! It was in the afternoon,
  and I was sitting in state in my outer temple place, sitting on that old
  black stone of theirs when he came. I heard a row outside and jabbering, and
  then his voice speaking to an interpreter. 'They worship stocks and stones,'
  he said, and I knew what was up, in a flash. I had one of my windows out for
  comfort, and I sang out straight away on the spur of the moment. 'Stocks and
  stones!' I says. 'You come inside,' I says, 'and I'll punch your blooming
  head.' There was a kind of silence and more jabbering, and in he came, Bible
  in hand, after the manner of them&mdash;a little sandy chap in specks and a
  pith helmet. I flatter myself that me sitting there in the shadows, with my
  copper head and my big goggles, struck him a bit of a heap at first. 'Well,'
  I says, 'how's the trade in calico?' for I don't hold with missionaries.</p>

  <p>"I had a lark with that missionary. He was a raw hand, and quite
  outclassed with a man like me. He gasped out who was I, and I told him to
  read the inscription at my feet if he wanted to know. Down he goes to read,
  and his interpreter, being of course as superstitious as any of them, took it
  as an act of worship and plumped down like a shot. All my people gave a howl
  of triumph, and there wasn't any more business to be done in my village after
  that journey, not by the likes of him.</p>

  <p>"But, of course, I was a fool to choke him off like that. If I'd had any
  sense I should have told him straight away of the treasure and taken him into
  Co. I've no doubt he'd have come into Co. A child, with a few hours to think
  it over, could have seen the connection between my diving-dress and the loss
  of the Ocean Pioneer. A week after he left I went out one morning and saw the
  Motherhood, the salver's ship from Starr Race, towing up the channel and
  sounding. The whole blessed game was up, and all my trouble thrown away.
  Gummy! How wild I felt! And guying it in that stinking silly dress! Four
  months!"</p>

  <p>The sunburnt man's story degenerated again. "Think of it," he said, when
  he emerged to linguistic purity once more. "Forty thousand pounds worth of
  gold."</p>

  <p>"Did the little missionary come back?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes! Bless him! And he pledged his reputation there was a man inside
  the god, and started out to see as much with tremendous ceremony. But there
  wasn't&mdash;he got sold again. I always did hate scenes and explanations,
  and long before he came I was out of it all&mdash;going home to Banya along
  the coast, hiding in bushes by day, and thieving food from the villages by
  night. Only weapon, a spear. No clothes, no money. Nothing. My face was my
  fortune, as the saying is. And just a squeak of eight thousand pounds of gold
  &mdash;fifth share. But the natives cut up rusty, thank goodness, because
  they thought it was him had driven their luck away."</p>

     name="story54">MR. BRISHER'S TREASURE</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, April 1899</h3>

  <p>"You can't be <i>too</i> careful <i>who</i> you marry," said Mr. Brisher,
  and pulled thoughtfully with a fat-wristed hand at the lank moustache that
  hides his want of chin.</p>

  <p>"That's why&mdash;" I ventured.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Brisher, with a solemn light in his bleary, blue-grey
  eyes, moving his head expressively and breathing alcohol <i>intimately</i> at
  me. "There's lots as 'ave 'ad a try at me&mdash;many as I could name in this
  town &mdash;but none 'ave done it&mdash;none."</p>

  <p>I surveyed the flushed countenance, the equatorial expansion, the masterly
  carelessness of his attire, and heaved a sigh to think that by reason of the
  unworthiness of women he must needs be the last of his race.</p>

  <p>"I was a smart young chap when I was younger," said Mr. Brisher. "I 'ad my
  work cut out. But I was very careful&mdash;very. And I got through ..."</p>

  <p>He leant over the taproom table and thought visibly on the subject of my
  trustworthiness. I was relieved at last by his confidence.</p>

  <p>"I was engaged once," he said at last, with a reminiscent eye on the shuv-
  a'penny board.</p>

  <p>"So near as that?"</p>

  <p>He looked at me. "So near as that. Fact is&mdash;" He looked about him,
  brought his face close to mine, lowered his voice, and fenced off an
  unsympathetic world with a grimy hand. "If she ain't dead or married to some
  one else or anything&mdash;I'm engaged still. Now." He confirmed this
  statement with nods and facial contortions. <i>"Still,"</i> he said, ending
  the pantomime, and broke into a reckless smile at my surprise.
  <i>"Me!"</i></p>

  <p>"Run away," he explained further, with coruscating eyebrows. "Come
  'ome.</p>

  <p>"That ain't all.</p>

  <p>"You'd 'ardly believe it," he said, "but I found a treasure. Found a
  regular treasure."</p>

  <p>I fancied this was irony, and did not, perhaps, greet it with proper
  surprise. "Yes," he said, "I found a treasure. And come 'ome. I tell you I
  could surprise you with things that has happened to me." And for some time he
  was content to repeat that he had found a treasure&mdash;and left it.</p>

  <p>I made no vulgar clamour for a story, but I became attentive to Mr.
  Brisher's bodily needs, and presently I led him back to the deserted
  lady.</p>

  <p>"She was a nice girl," he said&mdash;a little sadly, I thought.
  "<i>And</i> respectable."</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows and tightened his mouth to express extreme
  respectability&mdash;beyond the likes of us elderly men.</p>

  <p>"It was a long way from 'ere. Essex, in fact. Near Colchester. It was when
  I was up in London&mdash;in the buildin' trade. I was a smart young chap
  then, I can tell you. Slim. 'Ad best clo'es 's good as anybody.
  'At&mdash;<i>silk</i> 'at, mind you." Mr. Brisher's hand shot above his head
  towards the infinite to indicate it silk hat of the highest.
  "Umbrella&mdash;nice umbrella with a 'orn 'andle. Savin's. Very careful I
  was..."</p>

  <p>He was pensive for a little while, thinking, as we must all come to think
  sooner or later, of the vanished brightness of youth. But he refrained, as
  one may do in taprooms, from the obvious moral.</p>

  <p>"I got to know 'er through a chap what was engaged to 'er sister. She was
  stopping in London for a bit with an aunt that 'ad a 'am an' beef shop. This
  aunt was very particular&mdash;they was all very particular people, all 'er
  people was&mdash;and wouldn't let 'er sister go out with this feller except
  'er other sister, <i>my</i> girl that is, went with them. So 'e brought me
  into it, sort of to ease the crowding. We used to go walks in Battersea Park
  of a Sunday afternoon. Me in my topper, and 'im in 'is; and the
  girl's&mdash;well&mdash;stylish. There wasn't many in Battersea Park 'ad the
  larf of us. She wasn't what you'd call pretty, but a nicer girl I never met.
  <i>I</i> liked 'er from the start, and, well&mdash;though I say it who
  shouldn't&mdash;she liked me. You know 'ow it is, I dessay?"</p>

  <p>I pretended I did.</p>

  <p>"And when this chap married 'er sister&mdash;'im and me was great
  friends&mdash;what must 'e do but arst me down to Colchester, close by where
  She lived. Naturally I was introjuced to 'er people, and well, very soon, her
  and me was engaged."</p>

  <p>He repeated "engaged."</p>

  <p>"She lived at 'ome with 'er father and mother, quite the lady, in a very
  nice little 'ouse with a garden&mdash;and remarkable respectable people they
  was. Rich you might call 'em a'most. They owned their own 'ouse&mdash;got it
  out of the Building Society, and cheap because the chap who had it before was
  a burglar and in prison&mdash;and they 'ad a bit of free'old land, and some
  cottages and money 'nvested&mdash;all nice and tight: they was what you'd
  call snug and warm. I tell you, I was On. Furniture too. Why! They 'ad a
  pianner. Jane&mdash;'er name was Jane&mdash;used to play it Sundays, and very
  nice she played too. There wasn't 'ardly a 'im toon in the book she
  <i>couldn't</i> play...</p>

  <p>"Many's the evenin' we've met and sung 'ims there, me and 'er and the
  family.</p>

  <p>"'Er father was quite a leadin' man in chapel. You should ha' seen him
  Sundays, interruptin' the minister and givin' out 'ims. He had gold
  spectacles, I remember, and used to look over 'em at you while he sang
  hearty&mdash;he was always great on singing 'earty to the Lord&mdash;and when
  HE got out o' toon 'arf the people went after 'im&mdash;always. 'E was that
  sort of man. And to walk be'ind 'im in 'is nice black clo'es&mdash;'is 'at
  was a brimmer&mdash;made one regular proud to be engaged to such a
  father-in-law. And when the summer came I went down there and stopped a
  fortnight.</p>

  <p>"Now, you know there was a sort of Itch," said Mr. Brisher. "We wanted to
  marry, me and Jane did, and get things settled. But '<i>e</i> said I 'ad to
  get a proper position first. Consequently there was a Itch. Consequently,
  when I went down there, I was anxious to show that I was a good useful sort
  of chap like. Show I could do pretty nearly everything like. See?"</p>

  <p>I made a sympathetic noise.</p>

  <p>"And down at the bottom of their garden was a bit of wild part like. So I
  says to 'im, 'Why don't you 'ave a rockery 'ere?' I says. 'It 'ud look
  nice.'</p>

  <p>"'Too much expense,' he says.</p>

  <p>"'Not a penny,' says I. 'I'm a dab at rockeries. Lemme make you one.' You
  see, I'd 'elped my brother make a rockery in the beer garden be'ind 'is tap,
  so I knew 'ow to do it to rights. 'Lemme make you one,' I says. 'It's
  'olidays, but I'm that sort of chap, I 'ate doing nothing,' I says. 'I'll
  make you one to rights.' And the long and the short of it was, he said I
  might.</p>

  <p>"And that's 'ow I come on the treasure."</p>

  <p>"What treasure?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Why!" said Mr. Brisher, "the treasure I'm telling you about, what's the
  reason why I never married."</p>

  <p>"What!&mdash;a treasure&mdash;dug up?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;buried wealth&mdash;treasure trove. Come out of the ground.
  What I kept on saying&mdash;regular treasure..." He looked at me with unusual
  disrespect.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't more than a foot deep, not the top of it," he said. "I'd 'ardly
  got thirsty like, before I come on the corner."</p>

  <p>"Go on," I said. "I didn't understand."</p>

  <p>"Why! Directly I 'it the box I knew it was treasure. A sort of instinct
  told me. Something seemed to shout inside of me&mdash;'Now's your chance
  &mdash;lie low.' It's lucky I knew the laws of treasure trove or I'd 'ave
  been shoutin' there and then. I daresay you know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Crown bags it," I said, "all but one per cent. Go on. It's a shame. What
  did you do?"</p>

  <p>"Uncovered the top of the box. There wasn't anybody in the garden or about
  like. Jane was 'elping 'er mother do the 'ouse. I <i>was</i> excited&mdash;I
  tell you. I tried the lock and then gave a whack at the hinges. Open it came.
  Silver coins&mdash;full! Shining. It made me tremble to see 'em. And jest
  then&mdash;I'm blessed if the dustman didn't come round the back of the
  'ouse. It pretty nearly gave me 'eart disease to think what a fool I was to
  'ave that money showing. And directly after I 'eard the chap next
  door&mdash;'e was 'olidaying, too&mdash;I 'eard him watering 'is beans. If
  only 'e'd looked over the fence!"</p>

  <p>"What did you do?"</p>

  <p>"Kicked the lid on again and covered it up like a shot, and went on
  digging about a yard away from it&mdash;like mad. And my face, so to speak,
  was laughing on its own account till I had it hid. I tell you I was regular
  scared like at my luck. I jest thought that it 'ad to be kep' close and that
  was all. 'Treasure,' I kep' whisperin' to myself, 'Treasure' and ''undreds of
  pounds, 'undreds, 'undreds of pounds.' Whispering to myself like, and digging
  like blazes. It seemed to me the box was regular sticking out and showing,
  like your legs do under the sheets in bed, and I went and put all the earth
  I'd got out of my 'ole for the rockery slap on top of it. I <i>was</i> in a
  sweat. And in the midst of it all out toddles 'er father. He didn't say
  anything to me, jest stood behind me and stared, but Jane tole me afterwards
  when he went indoors, 'e says, 'That there jackanapes of yours,
  Jane'&mdash;he always called me a jackanapes some'ow&mdash;'knows 'ow to put
  'is back into it after all.' Seemed quite impressed by it, 'e did."</p>

  <p>"How long was the box?" I asked, suddenly.</p>

  <p>"'Ow long?" said Mr. Brisher.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;in length?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! 'bout so-by-so." Mr. Brisher indicated a moderate-sized trunk.</p>

  <p><i>"Full?"</i> said I.</p>

  <p>"Full up of silver coins&mdash;'arf-crowns, I believe."</p>

  <p>"Why!" I cried, "that would mean&mdash;hundreds of pounds."</p>

  <p>"Thousands," said Mr. Brisher, in a sort of sad calm. "I calc'lated it
  out."</p>

  <p>"But how did they get there?"</p>

  <p>"All I know is what I found. What I thought at the time was this. The chap
  who'd owned the 'ouse before 'er father 'd been a regular slap-up burglar.
  What you'd call a 'igh-class criminal. Used to drive 'is trap&mdash;like
  Peace did." Mr. Brisher meditated on the difficulties of narration and
  embarked on a complicated parenthesis. "I don't know if I told you it'd been
  a burglar's 'ouse before it was my girl's father's, and I knew 'e'd robbed a
  mail train once, I did know that. It seemed to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's very likely," I said. "But what did you do?"</p>

  <p>"Sweated," said Mr. Brisher. "Regular run orf me. All that morning," said
  Mr. Brisher, "I was at it, pretending to make that rockery and wondering what
  I should do. I'd 'ave told 'er father p'r'aps, only I was doubtful of 'is
  honesty&mdash;I was afraid he might rob me of it like, and give it up to the
  authorities&mdash;and besides, considering I was marrying into the family, I
  thought it would be nicer like if it came through me. Put me on a better
  footing, so to speak. Well, I 'ad three days before me left of my 'olidays,
  so there wasn't no hurry, so I covered it up and went on digging, and tried
  to puzzle out 'ow I was to make sure of it. Only I couldn't.</p>

  <p>"I thought," said Mr. Brisher, "<i>and</i> I thought. Once I got regular
  doubtful whether I'd seen it or not, and went down to it and 'ad it uncovered
  again, just as her ma came out to 'ang up a bit of washin' she'd done. Jumps
  again! Afterwards I was just thinking I'd 'ave another go at it, when Jane
  comes to tell me dinner was ready. 'You'll want it,' she said, 'seeing all
  the 'ole you've dug.'</p>

  <p>"I was in a regular daze all dinner, wondering whether that chap next door
  wasn't over the fence and filling 'is pockets. But in the afternoon I got
  easier in my mind&mdash;it seemed to me it must 'ave been there so long it
  was pretty sure to stop a bit longer&mdash;and I tried to get up a bit of a
  discussion to dror out the old man and see what '<i>e</i> thought of treasure
  trove."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brisher paused, and affected amusement at the memory.</p>

  <p>"The old man was a scorcher," he said; "a regular scorcher."</p>

  <p>"What!" said I; "did he&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"It was like this," explained Mr. Brisher, laying a friendly hand on my
  arm and breathing into my face to calm me. "Just to dror 'im out, I told a
  story of a chap I said I knew&mdash;pretendin', you know&mdash;who'd found a
  sovring in a novercoat 'e'd borrowed. I said 'e stuck to it, but I said I
  wasn't sure whether that was right or not. And then the old man began. Lor'!
  'e <i>did</i> let me 'ave it!" Mr. Brisher affected an insincere amusement.
  "'E was, well&mdash;what you might call a rare 'and at Snacks. Said that was
  the sort of friend 'e'd naturally expect me to 'ave. Said 'e'd naturally
  expect that from the friend of a out-of-work loafer who took up with
  daughters who didn't belong to 'im. There! I couldn't tell you 'ARF 'e said.
  'E went on most outrageous. I stood up to 'im about it, just to dror 'im out.
  'Wouldn't you stick to a 'arf-sov', not if you found it in the street?' I
  says. 'Certainly not,' 'e says; 'certainly I wouldn't.' 'What! not if you
  found it as a sort of treasure?' 'Young man,' 'e says, 'there's 'i'er
  'thority than mine&mdash;Render unto Caesar'&mdash;what is it? Yes. Well, he
  fetched up that. A rare 'and at 'itting you over the 'ed with the Bible, was
  the old man. And so he went on. 'E got to such Snacks about me at last I
  couldn't stand it. I'd promised Jane not to answer 'im back, but it got a bit
  TOO thick. I&mdash;I give it 'im ..."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brisher, by means of enigmatical facework, tried to make me think he
  had had the best of that argument, but I knew better.</p>

  <p>"I went out in a 'uff at last. But not before I was pretty sure I 'ad to
  lift that treasure by myself. The only thing that kep' me up was thinking 'ow
  I'd take it out of 'im when I 'ad the cash."</p>

  <p>There was a lengthy pause.</p>

  <p>"Now, you'd 'ardly believe it, but all them three days I never 'ad a
  chance at the blessed treasure, never got out not even a 'arf-crown. There
  was always a Somethink&mdash;always.</p>

  <p>"'Stonishing thing it isn't thought of more," said Mr. Brisher. "Finding
  treasure's no great shakes. It's gettin' it. I don't suppose I slep' a wink
  any of those nights, thinking where I was to take it, what I was to do with
  it, 'ow I was to explain it. It made me regular ill. And days I was that
  dull, it made Jane regular 'uffy. 'You ain't the same chap you was in
  London,' she says, several times. I tried to lay it on 'er father and 'is
  Snacks, but bless you, she knew better. What must she 'ave but that I'd got
  another girl on my mind! Said I wasn't True. Well, we had a bit of a row. But
  I was that set on the Treasure, I didn't seem to mind a bit Anything she
  said.</p>

  <p>"Well, at last I got a sort of plan. I was always a bit good at planning,
  though carrying out isn't so much in my line. I thought it all out and
  settled on a plan. First, I was going to take all my pockets full of these
  'ere 'arf-crowns&mdash;see?&mdash;and afterwards as I shall tell.</p>

  <p>"Well, I got to that state I couldn't think of getting at the Treasure
  again in the daytime, so I waited until the night before I had to go, and
  then, when everything was still, up I gets and slips down to the back door,
  meaning to get my pockets full. What must I do in the scullery but fall over
  a pail! Up gets 'er father with a gun&mdash;'e was a light sleeper was 'er
  father, and very suspicious and there was me: 'ad to explain I'd come down to
  the pump for a drink because my water-bottle was bad. 'E didn't let me off a
  Snack or two over that bit, you lay a bob."</p>

  <p>"And you mean to say&mdash;" I began.</p>

  <p>"Wait a bit," said Mr. Brisher. "I say, I'd made my plan. That put the
  kybosh on one bit, but it didn't 'urt the general scheme not a bit. I went
  and I finished that rockery next day, as though there wasn't a Snack in the
  world; cemented over the stones, I did, dabbed it green and everythink. I put
  a dab of green just to show where the box was. They all came and looked at
  it, and sai 'ow nice it was&mdash;even 'e was a bit softer like to see it,
  and all he said was, "It's a pity you can't always work like that, then you
  might get something definite to do," he says.</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' I says&mdash;I couldn't 'elp it&mdash;'I put a lot in that
  rockery,' I says, like that. See? 'I put a lot in that
  rockery'&mdash;meaning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I see," said I&mdash;for Mr. Brisher is apt to overelaborate his
  jokes.</p>

  <p>"<i>'E</i> didn't," said Mr. Brisher. "Not then, anyhow.</p>

  <p>"Ar'ever&mdash;after all that was over, off I set for London... Orf I set
  for London."</p>

  <p>Pause.</p>

  <p>"On'y I wasn't going to no London," said Mr. Brisher, with sudden
  animation, and thrusting his face into mine. "No fear! What do <i>you</i>
  think?</p>

  <p>"I didn't go no further than Colchester&mdash;not a yard.</p>

  <p>"I'd left the spade just where I could find it. I'd got everything planned
  and right. I 'ired a little trap in Colchester, and pretended I wanted to go
  to Ipswich and stop the night, and come back next day, and the chap I 'ired
  it from made me leave two sovrings on it right away, and off I set.</p>

  <p>"I didn't go to no Ipswich neither.</p>

  <p>"Midnight the 'orse and trap was 'itched by the little road that ran by
  the cottage where 'e lived&mdash;not sixty yards off, it wasn't&mdash;and I
  was at it like a good 'un. It was jest the night for such
  games&mdash;overcast&mdash;but a trifle too 'ot, and all round the sky there
  was summer lightning and presently a thunderstorm. Down it came. First big
  drops in a sort of fizzle, then 'ail. I kep'on. I whacked at it&mdash;I
  didn't dream the old man would 'ear. I didn't even trouble to go quiet with
  the spade, and the thunder and lightning and 'ail seemed to excite me like. I
  shouldn't wonder if I was singing. I got so 'ard at it I clean forgot the
  thunder and the 'orse and trap. I precious soon got the box showing, and
  started to lift it ..."</p>

  <p>"Heavy?" I said.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't no more lift it than fly. I <i>was</i> sick. I'd never thought
  of that I got regular wild&mdash;I tell you, I cursed. I got sort of
  outrageous. I didn't think of dividing it like for the minute, and even then
  I couldn't 'ave took money about loose in a trap. I hoisted one end sort of
  wild like, and over the whole show went with a tremenjous noise. Perfeck
  smash of silver. And then right on the heels of that, Flash! Lightning like
  the day! and there was the back door open and the old man coming down the
  garden with 'is blooming old gun. He wasn't not a 'undred yards away!</p>

  <p>"I tell you I was that upset&mdash;I didn't think what I was doing. I
  never stopped-not even to fill my pockets. I went over the fence like a shot,
  and ran like one o'clock for the trap, cussing and swearing as I went. I WAS
  in a state...</p>

  <p>"And will you believe me, when I got to the place where I'd left the 'orse
  and trap, they'd gone. Orf! When I saw that I 'adn't a cuss left for it. I
  jest danced on the grass, and when I'd danced enough I started off to
  London... I was done."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brisher was pensive for an interval. "I was done," he repeated, very
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Well?" I said.</p>

  <p>"That's all," said Mr. Brisher.</p>

  <p>"You didn't go back?"</p>

  <p>"No fear. I'd 'ad enough of <i>that</i> blooming treasure, any'ow for a
  bit. Besides, I didn't know what was done to chaps who tried to collar a
  treasure trove. I started off for London there and then..."</p>

  <p>"And you never went back?"</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>"But about Jane? Did you write?"</p>

  <p>"Three times, fishing like. And no answer. We'd parted in a bit of a 'uff
  on account of 'er being jealous. So that I couldn't make out for certain what
  it meant.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know what to do. I didn't even know whether the old man knew it
  was me. I sort of kep' an eye open on papers to see when he'd give up that
  treasure to the Crown, as I hadn't a doubt 'e would, considering 'ow
  respectable he'd always been."</p>

  <p>"And did he?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Brisher pursed his mouth and moved his head slowly from side to side.
  "Not '<i>im</i>," he said.</p>

  <p>"Jane was a nice girl," he said, "a thorough nice girl mind you, if
  jealous, and there's no knowing I mightn't 'ave gone back to 'er after a bit.
  I thought if he didn't give up the treasure I might 'ave a sort of 'old on
  'im... Well, one day I looks as usual under Colchester&mdash;and there I saw
  'is name. What for, d'yer think?"</p>

  <p>I could not guess.</p>

  <p>Mr. Brisher's voice sank to a whisper, and once more he spoke behind his
  hand. His manner was suddenly suffused with a positive joy. "Issuing
  counterfeit coins," he said. "Counterfeit coins!"</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Yes-It. Bad. Quite a long case they made of it. But they got 'im, though
  he dodged tremenjous. Traced 'is 'aving passed, oh!&mdash;nearly a dozen bad
  'arf-crowns."</p>

  <p>"And you didn't&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"No fear. And it didn't do '<i>im</i> much good to say it was treasure
  trove."</p>

     name="story55">A VISION OF JUDGMENT</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Butterfly</i>, September 1899</h3>

  <h2>I</h2>

  <p>Bru-a-a-a.</p>

  <p>I listened, not understanding. Wa-ra-ra-ra.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" said I, still only half awake. "What an infernal shindy!" Ra-
  ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra Ta-ra-rra-ra.</p>

  <p>"It's enough," said I, "to wake&mdash;" and stopped short. Were was I? Ta-
  rra-rara&mdash;louder and louder.</p>

  <p>"It's either some new invention&mdash;" Toora-toora-toora! Deafening!</p>

  <p>"No," said I, speaking loud in order to hear myself. "That's the Last
  Trump." Tooo-rraa!</p>

  <h2>II</h2>

  <p>The last note jerked me out of my grave like a hooked minnow.</p>

  <p>I saw my monument (rather a mean little affair, and I wished I knew who'd
  done it), and the old elm tree and the sea view vanished like a puff of
  steam, and then all about me&mdash;a multitude no man could number, nations,
  tongues, kingdoms, peoples&mdash;children of all ages, in an amphitheatral
  space as vast as the sky. And over against us, seated on a throne of dazzling
  white cloud, the Lord God and all the host of his angels. I recognised Azreal
  by his darkness and Michael by his sword, and the great angel who had blown
  the trumpet stood with the trumpet still half raised.</p>

  <h2>III</h2>

  <p>"Prompt," said the little man beside me. "Very prompt. Do you see the
  angel with the book?"</p>

  <p>He was ducking and craning his head about to see over and under and
  between the souls that crowded round us. "Everybody's here," he said.
  "Everybody. And now we shall know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's Darwin," he said, going off at a tangent. "He'll catch it! And
  there&mdash;you see&mdash;? That tall, important-looking man trying to catch
  the eye of the Lord God, that's the Duke. But there's a lot of people one
  doesn't know.</p>

  <p>"Oh! There's Priggles, the publisher. I have always wondered about
  printers' overs. Priggles was a clever man... But we shall know
  now&mdash;even about him.</p>

  <p>"I shall hear all that. I shall get most of the fun before... My letter's
  S."</p>

  <p>He drew the air in between his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Historical characters, too. See? That's Henry the Eighth. There'll be a
  good bit of evidence. Oh, damn! He's Tudor."</p>

  <p>He lowered his voice. "Notice this chap, just in front of us, all covered
  with hair. Paleolithic, you know. And there again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But I did not heed him, because I was looking at the Lord God.</p>

  <h2>IV</h2>

  <p>"Is this all?" asked the Lord God.</p>

  <p>The angel at the book&mdash;it was one of countless volumes, like the
  British Museum Reading-room Catalogue, glanced at us and seemed to count us
  in the instant.</p>

  <p>"That's all," he said, and added: "It was, O God, a very little
  planet."</p>

  <p>The eyes of God surveyed us.</p>

  <p>"Let us begin," said the Lord God.</p>

  <h2>V</h2>

  <p>The angel opened the book and read a name. It was a name full of A's, and
  the echoes of it came back out of the uttermost parts of space. I did not
  catch it clearly, because the little man beside me said, in a sharp jerk,
  "What's that?" It sounded like "Ahab" to me; but it could not have been the
  Ahab of Scripture.</p>

  <p>Instantly a small black figure was lifted up to a puffy cloud at the very
  feet of God. It was a stiff little figure, dressed in rich outlandish robes
  and crowned, and it folded its arms and scowled.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said God, looking down at him.</p>

  <p>We were privileged to hear the reply, and indeed the acoustic properties
  of the place were marvellous.</p>

  <p>"I plead guilty," said the little figure.</p>

  <p>"Tell them what you have done," said the Lord God.</p>

  <p>"I was a king," said the little figure, "a great king, and I was lustful
  and proud and cruel. I made wars, I devastated countries, I built palaces,
  and the mortar was the blood of men. Hear, O God, the witnesses against me,
  calling to you for vengeance. Hundreds and thousands of witnesses." He waved
  his hands towards us. "And worse! I took a prophet&mdash;one of your
  prophets&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One of my prophets," said the Lord God.</p>

  <p>"And because he would not bow to me, I tortured him for four days and
  nights, and in the end he died. I did more, O God, I blasphemed. I robbed you
  of your honours&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Robbed me of my honours," said the Lord God.</p>

  <p>"And caused myself to be worshipped in your stead. No evil was there, but
  I practised it; no cruelty wherewith I did not stain my soul. And at last you
  smote me, O God!"</p>

  <p>God raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>"And I was slain in battle. And so I stand before you, meet for your
  nethermost Hell! Out of your greatness daring no lies, daring no pleas, but
  telling the truth of my iniquities before all mankind."</p>

  <p>He ceased. His face I saw distinctly, and it seemed to me white and
  terrible and proud and strangely noble. I thought of Milton's Satan.</p>

  <p>"Most of that is from the Obelisk," said the recording Angel, finger on
  page.</p>

  <p>"It is," said the Tyrannous Man, with a faint touch of surprise.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly God bent forward and took this man in his hand, and held him
  up on his palm as if to see him better. He was just a little dark stroke in
  the middle of God's palm.</p>

  <p>"Did he do all this?" said the Lord God.</p>

  <p>The recording Angel flattened his book with his hand.</p>

  <p>"In a way," said the Recording Angel, carelessly.</p>

  <p>Now when I looked again at the little man his face had changed in a very
  curious manner. He was looking at the Recording Angel with strange
  apprehension in his eyes, and one hand fluttered to his mouth. Just the
  movement of a muscle or so, and all that dignity of defiance was gone.</p>

  <p>"Read," said the Lord God.</p>

  <p>And the angel read, explaining very carefully and fully all the wickedness
  of the Wicked Man. It was quite a intellectual treat&mdash;A little "daring"
  in places, I thought, but of course Heaven has its privileges...</p>

  <h2>VI</h2>

  <p>Everybody was laughing. Even the prophet of the Lord whom the Wicked Man
  had tortured had a smile on his face. The Wicked Man was really such a
  preposterous little fellow.</p>

  <p>"And then," reading the Recording Angel, with a smile that set us all
  agog, "one day, when he was a little irascible from over-eating,
  he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not that," cried the Wicked Man, "nobody knew of that."</p>

  <p>"It didn't happen," screamed the Wicked Man. "I was bad&mdash;I was really
  bad. Frequently bad, but there was nothing so silly&mdash;so absolutely
  silly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The angel went on reading.</p>

  <p>"O God!" cried the Wicked Man. "Don't let them know that! I'll repent!
  I'll apologise..."</p>

  <p>The Wicked Man on God's hand began to dance and weep. Suddenly shame
  overcame him. He made a wild rush to jump off the ball of God's little
  finger, but God stopped him by a dexterous turn of the wrist. Then he made a
  rush for a gap between hand and thumb, but thumb closed. And all the while
  the angel went on reading&mdash;reading. The Wicked Man rushed to and fro
  across God's palm, and then suddenly turned about and fled up the sleeve of
  God.</p>

  <p>I expected God would turn him out, but the mercy of God is infinite.</p>

  <p>The Recording Angel paused.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" said the Recording Angel.</p>

  <p>"Next," said God, and before the Recording Angel could call upon the name,
  a hairy creature in filthy rags stood upon God's palm.</p>

  <h2>VII</h2>

  <p>"Has God got Hell up his sleeve then?" said the little man beside me.</p>

  <p>"Is there a Hell?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"If you notice," he said&mdash;he peered between the feet of the great
  angels&mdash;"there's no particular indication of the Celestial City."</p>

  <p>"Ssh!" said a little woman near us, scowling. "Hear this blessed
  Saint!"</p>

  <h2>VIII</h2>

  <p>"He was Lord of the Earth, but I was the prophet of the God of Heaven,"
  cried the Saint, "and all the people marvelled at the sign. For I, O God,
  knew of the glories of thy Paradise. No pain, no hardship, gashing with
  knives, splinters thrust under my nails, strips of flesh flayed off, all for
  the glory and honour of God."</p>

  <p>God smiled.</p>

  <p>"And at last I went, I in my rags and sores, smelling of my holy
  discomforts&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gabriel laughed abruptly.</p>

  <p>"And lay outside his gates, as a sign, as a wonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As a perfect nuisance," said the Recording Angel, and began to read,
  heedless of the fact that the Saint was still speaking of gloriously
  unpleasant things he had done that Paradise might be his.</p>

  <p>And behold, in that book the record of the Saint also was a revelation, a
  marvel.</p>

  <p>It seemed not ten seconds before the Saint, also, was rushing to and fro
  over the great palm of God. Not ten seconds! And at last he also shrieked
  beneath that pitiless and cynical exposition, and fled also, even as the
  Wicked Man had fled, into the shadow of the sleeve. And it was permitted us
  to see into the shadow of the sleeve. And the two sat side by side, stark of
  all delusions, in the shadow of the robe of God's charity, like brothers.</p>

  <p>And thither also I fled in my turn.</p>

  <h2>IX</h2>

  <p>"And now," said God, as he shook us out of his sleeve upon the planet he
  had given us to live upon, the planet that whirled about green Sirius for a
  sun, "now that you understand me and each other a little better... try
  again."</p>

  <p>Then he and his great angels turned themselves about and suddenly had
  vanished.</p>

  <p>The Throne had vanished.</p>

  <p>All about me was a beautiful land, more beautiful than any I had ever seen
  before-waste, austere, and wonderful; and all about me were the enlightened
  souls of men in new clean bodies...</p>

     name="story56">A DREAM OF ARMAGEDDON</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Black &amp; White</i>, May-June 1901</h3>

  <p>The man with the white face entered the carriage at Rugby. He moved slowly
  in spite of the urgency of his porter, and even while he was still on the
  platform I noted how ill he seemed. He dropped into the corner over against
  me with a sigh, made an incomplete attempt to arrange his travelling shawl,
  and became motionless, with his eyes staring vacantly. Presently he was moved
  by a sense of my observation, looked up at me, and put out a spiritless hand
  for his newspaper. Then he glanced again in my direction.</p>

  <p>I feigned to read. I feared I had unwittingly embarrassed him, and in a
  moment I was surprised to find him speaking.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon?" said I.</p>

  <p>"That book," he repeated, pointing a lean finger, "is about dreams."</p>

  <p>"Obviously," I answered, for it was Fortnum Roscoe's Dream States, and the
  title was on the cover.</p>

  <p>He hung silent for a space as if he sought words. "Yes," he said at last,
  "but they tell you nothing."</p>

  <p>I did not catch his meaning for a second.</p>

  <p>"They don't know," he added.</p>

  <p>I looked a little more attentively at his face.</p>

  <p>"There are dreams," he said, "and dreams."</p>

  <p>That sort of proposition I never dispute.</p>

  <p>"I suppose&mdash;" he hesitated. "Do you ever dream? I mean vividly."</p>

  <p>"I dream very little," I answered. "I doubt if I have three vivid dreams
  in a year."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said, and seemed for a moment to collect his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Your dreams don't mix with your memories?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"You don't find yourself in doubt; did this happen or did it not?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly ever. Except just for a momentary hesitation now and then. I
  suppose few people do."</p>

  <p>"Does he say&mdash;?" He indicated the book.</p>

  <p>"Says it happens at times and gives the usual explanation about intensity
  of impression and the like to account for its not happening as a rule. I
  suppose you know something of these theories&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Very little&mdash;except that they are wrong."</p>

  <p>His emaciated hand played with the strap of the window for a time. I
  prepared to resume reading, and that seemed to precipitate his next remark.
  He leant forward almost as though he would touch me.</p>

  <p>"Isn't there something called consecutive dreaming&mdash;that goes on
  night after night?"</p>

  <p>"I believe there is. There are cases given in most books on mental
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"Mental trouble! Yes. I daresay there are. It's the right place for them.
  But what I mean&mdash;" He looked at his bony knuckles. "Is that sort of
  thing always dreaming? Is it dreaming?</p>

  <p>Or is it something else? Mightn't it be something else?"</p>

  <p>I should have snubbed his persistent conversation but for the drawn
  anxiety of his face. I remember now the look of his faded eyes and the lids
  red stained&mdash;perhaps you know that look.</p>

  <p>"I'm not just arguing about a matter of opinion," he said. "The thing's
  killing me."</p>

  <p>"Dreams?"</p>

  <p>"If you call them dreams. Night after night. Vivid!&mdash;so vivid ...
  this&mdash;" (he indicated the landscape that went streaming by the window)
  "seems unreal in comparison! I can scarcely remember who I am, what business
  I am on ..."</p>

  <p>He paused. "Even now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The dream is always the same&mdash;do you mean?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It's over."</p>

  <p>"You mean?"</p>

  <p>"I died."</p>

  <p>"Died?"</p>

  <p>"Smashed and killed, and now, so much of me as that dream was, is dead.
  Dead forever. I dreamt I was another man, you know, living in a different
  part of the world and in a different time. I dreamt that night after night.
  Night after night I woke into that other life. Fresh scenes and fresh
  happenings&mdash;until I came upon the last&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"When you died?"</p>

  <p>"When I died."</p>

  <p>"And since then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "Thank God! That was the end of the dream . .. "</p>

  <p>It was clear I was in for this dream. And after all, I had an hour before
  me, the light was fading fast, and Fortnum Roscoe has a dreary way with him.
  "Living in a different time," I said: "do you mean in some different
  age?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Past?"</p>

  <p>"No, to come&mdash;to come."</p>

  <p>"The year three thousand, for example?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what year it was. I did when I was asleep, when I was
  dreaming, that is, but not now&mdash;not now that I am awake. There's a lot
  of things I have forgotten since I woke out of these dreams, though I knew
  them at the time when I was&mdash;I suppose it was dreaming. They called the
  year differently from our way of calling the year...What did they call it?"
  He put his hand to his forehead. "No," said he, "I forget."</p>

  <p>He sat smiling weakly. For a moment I feared he did not mean to tell me
  his dream. As a rule I hate people who tell their dreams, but this struck me
  differently. I proffered assistance even. "It began&mdash;" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"It was vivid from the first. I seemed to wake up in it suddenly. And it's
  curious that in these dreams I am speaking of I never remembered this life I
  am living now. It seemed as if the dream life was enough while it lasted.
  Perhaps&mdash;But I will tell you how I find myself when I do my best to
  recall it all. I don't remember anything clearly until I found myself sitting
  in a sort of loggia looking out over the sea. I had been dozing, and suddenly
  I woke up&mdash;fresh and vivid&mdash;not a bit dreamlike&mdash;because the
  girl had stopped fanning me."</p>

  <p>"The girl?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the girl. You must not interrupt or you will put me out."</p>

  <p>He stopped abruptly. "You won't think I'm mad?" he said.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "You've been dreaming. Tell me your dream."</p>

  <p>"I woke up, I say, because the girl had stopped fanning me. I was not
  surprised to find myself there or anything of that sort, you understand. I
  did not feel I had fallen into it suddenly. I simply took it up at that
  point. Whatever memory I had of this life, this nineteenth-century life,
  faded as I woke, vanished like a dream. I knew all about myself, knew that my
  name was no longer Cooper but Hedon, and all about my position in the world.
  I've forgotten a lot since I woke&mdash;there's a want of
  connection&mdash;but it was all quite clear and matter of fact then."</p>

  <p>He hesitated again, gripping the window strap, putting his face forward
  and looking up to me appealingly.</p>

  <p>"This seems bosh to you?"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" I cried. "Go on. Tell me what this loggia was like!"</p>

  <p>"It was not really a loggia&mdash;I don't know what to call it. It faced
  south. It was small. It was all in shadow except the semicircle above the
  balcony that showed the sky and sea and the corner where the girl stood. I
  was on a couch&mdash;it was a metal couch with light striped
  cushions&mdash;and the girl was leaning over the balcony with her back to me.
  The light of the sunrise fell on her ear and cheek. Her pretty white neck and
  the little curls that nestled there, and her white shoulder were in the sun,
  and all the grace of her body was in the cool blue shadow. She was
  dressed&mdash;how can I describe it? It was easy and flowing. And altogether
  there she stood, so that it came to me how beautiful and desirable she was,
  as though I had never seen her before. And when at last I sighed and raised
  myself upon my arm she turned her face to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped.</p>

  <p>"I have lived three-and-fifty years in this world. I have had mother,
  sisters, friends, wife and daughters&mdash;all their faces, the play of their
  faces, I know. But the face of this girl&mdash;it is much more real to me. I
  can bring it back into memory so that I see it again&mdash;I could draw it or
  paint it. And after all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped&mdash;but I said nothing.</p>

  <p>"The face of a dream&mdash;the face of a dream. She was beautiful.</p>

  <p>Not that beauty which is terrible, cold, and worshipful, like the beauty
  of a saint; nor that beauty that stirs fierce passions; but a sort of
  radiation, sweet lips that softened into smiles, and grave gray eyes. And she
  moved gracefully, she seemed to have part with all pleasant and gracious
  things&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped, and his face was downcast and hidden. Then he looked up at me
  and went on, making no further attempt to disguise his absolute belief in the
  reality of his story.</p>

  <p>"You see, I had thrown up my plans and ambitions, thrown up all I had ever
  worked for or desired for her sake. I had been a master man away there in the
  north, with influence and property and a great reputation, but none of it had
  seemed worth having beside her. I had come to the place, this city of sunny
  pleasures with her, and left all those things to wreck and ruin just to save
  a remnant at least of my life. While I had been in love with her before I
  knew that she had any care for me, before I had imagined that she would
  dare&mdash;that we should dare, all my life had seemed vain and hollow, dust
  and ashes. It was dust and ashes. Night after night and through the long days
  I had longed and desired&mdash;my soul had beaten against the thing
  forbidden!</p>

  <p>"But it is impossible for one man to tell another just these things. It's
  emotion, it's a tint, a light that comes and goes. Only while it's there,
  everything changes, everything. The thing is I came away and left them in
  their Crisis to do what they could."</p>

  <p>"Left whom?" I asked, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"The people up in the north there. You see&mdash;in this dream, anyhow
  &mdash;I had been a big man, the sort of man men come to trust in, to group
  themselves about. Millions of men who had never seen me were ready to do
  things and risk things because of their confidence in me. I had been playing
  that game for years, that big laborious game, that vague, monstrous political
  game amidst intrigues and betrayals, speech and agitation. It was a vast
  weltering world, and at last I had a sort of leadership against the
  Gang&mdash;you know it was called the Gang&mdash;a sort of compromise of
  scoundrelly projects and base ambitions and vast public emotional stupidities
  and catch-words&mdash;the Gang that kept the world noisy and blind year by
  year, and all the while that it was drifting, drifting towards infinite
  disaster. But I can't expect you to understand the shades and complications
  of the year&mdash;the year something or other ahead. I had it all&mdash;down
  to the smallest details&mdash;in my dream. I suppose I had been dreaming of
  it before I awoke, and the fading outline of some queer new development I had
  imagined still hung about me as I rubbed my eyes. It was some grubby affair
  that made me thank God for the sunlight. I sat up on the couch and remained
  looking at the woman and rejoicing&mdash;rejoicing that I had come away out
  of all that tumult and folly and violence before it was too late. After all,
  I thought, this is life&mdash;love and beauty, desire and delight, are they
  not worth all those dismal struggles for vague, gigantic ends? And I blamed
  myself for having ever sought to be a leader when I might have given my days
  to love. But then, thought I, if I had not spent my early days sternly and
  austerely, I might have wasted myself upon vain and worthless women, and at
  the thought all my being went out in love and tenderness to my dear mistress,
  my dear lady, who had come at last and compelled me&mdash;compelled me by her
  invincible charm for me&mdash;to lay that life aside.</p>

  <p>"'You are worth it,' I said, speaking without intending her to hear; 'you
  are worth it, my dearest one; worth pride and praise and all things. Love! to
  have you is worth them all together." And at the murmur of my voice she
  turned about.</p>

  <p>"'Come and see,' she cried&mdash;I can hear her now&mdash;'come and see
  the sunrise upon Monte Solaro.'</p>

  <p>"I remember how I sprang to my feet and joined her at the balcony. She put
  a white hand upon my shoulder and pointed towards great masses of limestone,
  flushing, as it were, into life. I looked. But first I noted the sunlight on
  her face caressing the lines of her cheeks and neck. How can I describe to
  you the scene we had before us? We were at Capri&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have been there," I said. "I have clambered up Monte Solaro and drunk
  vero Capri&mdash;muddy stuff like cider&mdash;at the summit."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the man with the white face; "then perhaps you can tell me
  &mdash;you will know if this is indeed Capri. For in this life I have never
  been there. Let me describe it. We were in a little room, one of a vast
  multitude of little rooms, very cool and sunny, hollowed out of the limestone
  of a sort of cape, very high above the sea. The whole island, you know, was
  one enormous hotel, complex beyond explaining, and on the other side there
  were miles of floating hotels, and huge floating stages to which the flying
  machines came. They called it a pleasure city. Of course, there was none of
  that in your time&mdash;rather, I should say, is none of that now. Of course.
  Now!&mdash;yes.</p>

  <p>"Well, this room of ours was at the extremity of the cape, so that one
  could see east and west. Eastward was a great cliff&mdash;a thousand feet
  high perhaps&mdash;coldly gray except for one bright edge of gold, and beyond
  it the Isle of the Sirens, and a falling coast that faded and passed into the
  hot sunrise. And when one turned to the west, distinct and near was a little
  bay, a little beach still in shadow. And out of that shadow rose Solaro
  straight and tall, flushed and golden crested, like a beauty throned, and the
  white moon was floating behind her in the sky. And before us from east to
  west stretched the many-tinted sea all dotted with little sailing boats.</p>

  <p>"To the eastward, of course, these little boats were gray and very minute
  and clear, but to the westward they were little boats of gold&mdash;shining
  gold&mdash;almost like little flames. And just below us was a rock with an
  arch worn through it. The blue sea-water broke to green and foam all round
  the rock, and a galley came gliding out of the arch."</p>

  <p>"I know that rock." I said. "I was nearly drowned there. It is called the
  Faraglioni."</p>

  <p>"I Faraglioni? Yes, she called it that," answered the man with the white
  face. "There was some story&mdash;but that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He put his hand to his forehead again. " No," he said, "I forget that
  story."</p>

  <p>"Well, that is the first thing I remember, the first dream I had, that
  little shaded room and the beautiful air and sky and that dear lady of mine,
  with her shining arms and her graceful robe, and how we sat and talked in
  half whispers to one another. We talked in whispers not because there was any
  one to hear, but because there was still such a freshness of mind between us
  that our thoughts were a little frightened, I think, to find themselves at
  last in words. And so they went softly.</p>

  <p>"Presently we were hungry and we went from our apartment, going by a
  strange passage with a moving floor, until we came to the great breakfast
  room&mdash;there was a fountain and music. A pleasant and joyful place it
  was, with its sunlight and splashing, and the murmur of plucked strings. And
  we sat and ate and smiled at one another, and I would not heed a man who was
  watching me from a table near by.</p>

  <p>"And afterwards we went on to the dancing-hall. But I cannot describe that
  hall. The place was enormous&mdash;larger than any building you have ever
  seen&mdash;and in one place there was the old gate of Capri, caught into the
  wall of a gallery high overhead. Light girders, stems and threads of gold,
  burst from the pillars like fountains, streamed like an Aurora across the
  roof and interlaced, like&mdash;like conjuring tricks. All about the great
  circle for the dancers there were beautiful figures, strange dragons, and
  intricate and wonderful grotesques bearing lights. The place was inundated
  with artificial light that shamed the newborn day. And as we went through the
  throng the people turned about and looked at us, for all through the world my
  name and face were known, and how I had suddenly thrown up pride and struggle
  to come to this place. And they looked also at the lady beside me, though
  half the story of how at last she had come to me was unknown or mistold. And
  few of the men who were there, I know, but judged me a happy man, in spite of
  all the shame and dishonour that had come upon my name.</p>

  <p>"The air was full of music, full of harmonious scents, full of the rhythm
  of beautiful motions. Thousands of beautiful people swarmed about the hall,
  crowded the galleries, sat in a myriad recesses; they were dressed in
  splendid colours and crowned with flowers; thousands danced about the great
  circle beneath the white images of the ancient gods, and glorious processions
  of youths and maidens came and went. We two danced, not the dreary monotonies
  of your days&mdash;of this time, I mean&mdash;but dances that were beautiful,
  intoxicating. And even now I can see my lady dancing&mdash;dancing joyously.
  She danced, you know, with a serious face; she danced with a serious dignity,
  and yet she was smiling at me and caressing me&mdash;smiling and caressing
  with her eyes.</p>

  <p>"The music was different," he murmured. "It went&mdash;I cannot describe
  it; but it was infinitely richer and more varied than any music that has ever
  come to me awake.</p>

  <p>"And then&mdash;it was when we had done dancing&mdash;a man came to speak
  to me. He was a lean, resolute man, very soberly clad for that place, and
  already I had marked his face watching me in the breakfasting hall, and
  afterwards as we went along the passage I had avoided his eye. But now, as we
  sat in a little alcove, smiling at the pleasure of all the people who went to
  and fro across the shining floor, he came and touched me, and spoke to me so
  that I was forced to listen. And he asked that he might speak to me for a
  little time apart.</p>

  <p>"'No,' I said. 'I have no secrets from this lady. What do you want to tell
  me?'</p>

  <p>"He said it was a trivial matter, or at least a dry matter, for a lady to
  hear.</p>

  <p>"'Perhaps for me to hear,' said I.</p>

  <p>"He glanced at her, as though almost he would appeal to her. Then he asked
  me suddenly if I had heard of a great and avenging declaration that Evesham
  had made? Now, Evesham had always before been the man next to myself in the
  leadership of that great party in the north. He was a forcible, hard, and
  tactless man, and only I had been able to control and soften him. It was on
  his account even more than my own, I think, that the others had been so
  dismayed at my retreat. So this question about what he had done reawakened my
  old interest in the life I had put aside just for a moment.</p>

  <p>"'I have taken no heed of any news for many days,' I said. 'What has
  Evesham been saying?'</p>

  <p>"And with that the man began, nothing loth, and I must confess even I was
  struck by Evesham's reckless folly in the wild and threatening words he had
  used. And this messenger they had sent to me not only told me of Evesham's
  speech, but went on to ask counsel and to point out what need they had of me.
  While he talked, my lady sat a little forward and watched his face and
  mine.</p>

  <p>"My old habits of scheming and organising reasserted themselves. I could
  even see myself suddenly returning to the north, and all the dramatic effect
  of it. All that this man said witnessed to the disorder of the party indeed,
  but not to its damage. I should go back stronger than I had come. And then I
  thought of my lady. You see&mdash;how can I tell you? There were certain
  peculiarities of our relationship&mdash;as things are I need not tell you
  about that&mdash;which would render her presence with me impossible. I should
  have had to leave her; indeed, I should have had to renounce her clearly and
  openly, if I was to do all that I could do in the north. And the man knew
  that, even as he talked to her and me, knew it as well as she did, that my
  steps to duty were&mdash;first, separation, then abandonment. At the touch of
  that thought my dream of a return was shattered. I turned on the man
  suddenly, as he was imagining his eloquence was gaining ground with me.</p>

  <p>"'What have I to do with these things now?' I said. 'I have done with
  them. Do you think I am coquetting with your people in coming here?'</p>

  <p>"'No,' he said. 'But&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Why cannot you leave me alone. I have done with these things. I have
  ceased to be anything but a private man.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' he answered. 'But have you thought?&mdash;this talk of war, these
  reckless challenges, these wild aggressions&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"I stood up.</p>

  <p>"'No,' I cried. 'I won't hear you. I took count of all those things, I
  weighed them&mdash;and I have come away.'</p>

  <p>"He seemed to consider the possibility of persistence. He looked from me
  to where the lady sat regarding us.</p>

  <p>"'War,' he said, as if he were speaking to himself, and then turned slowly
  from me and walked away.</p>

  <p>"I stood, caught in the whirl of thoughts his appeal had set going.</p>

  <p>"I heard my lady's voice.</p>

  <p>"'Dear,' she said; 'but if they had need of you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"She did not finish her sentence, she let it rest there. I turned to her
  sweet face, and the balance of my mood swayed and reeled.</p>

  <p>"'They want me only to do the thing they dare not do themselves,' I said.
  'If they distrust Evesham they must settle with him themselves.'</p>

  <p>"She looked at me doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"'But war&mdash;' she said.</p>

  <p>"I saw a doubt on her face that I had seen before, a doubt of herself and
  me, the first shadow of the discovery that, seen strongly and completely,
  must drive us apart for ever.</p>

  <p>"Now, I was an older mind than hers, and I could sway her to this belief
  or that.</p>

  <p>"'My dear one,' I said, 'you must not trouble over these things. There
  will be no war. Certainly there will be no war. The age of wars is past.
  Trust me to know the justice of this case. They have no right upon me,
  dearest, and no one has a right upon me. I have been free to choose my life,
  and I have chosen this.'</p>

  <p>"'But war&mdash;,' she said.</p>

  <p>"I sat down beside her. I put an arm behind her and took her hand in mine.
  I set myself to drive that doubt away&mdash;I set myself to fill her mind
  with pleasant things again. I lied to her, and in lying to her I lied also to
  myself. And she was only too ready to believe me, only too ready to
  forget.</p>

  <p>"Very soon the shadow had gone again, and we were hastening to our
  bathing-place in the Grotta del Bovo Marino, where it was our custom to bathe
  every day. We swam and splashed one another, and in that buoyant water I
  seemed to become something lighter and stronger than a man. And at last we
  came out dripping and rejoicing and raced among the rocks. And then I put on
  a dry bathing-dress, and we sat to bask in the sun, and presently I nodded,
  resting my head against her knee, and she put her hand upon my hair and
  stroked it softly and I dozed. And behold! as it were with the snapping of
  the string of a violin, I was awakening, and I was in my own bed in
  Liverpool, in the life of to-day.</p>

  <p>"Only for a time I could not believe that all these vivid moments had been
  no more than the substance of a dream.</p>

  <p>"In truth, I could not believe it a dream for all the sobering reality of
  things about me. I bathed and dressed as it were by habit, and as I shaved I
  argued why I of all men should leave the woman I loved to go back to
  fantastic politics in the hard and strenuous north. Even if Evesham did force
  the world back to war, what was that to me? I was a man with the heart of a
  man, and why should I feel the responsibility of a deity for the way the
  world might go?</p>

  <p>"You know that is not quite the way I think about affairs, about my real
  affairs. I am a solicitor, you know, with a point of view.</p>

  <p>"The vision was so real, you must understand, so utterly unlike a dream
  that I kept perpetually recalling little irrelevant details; even the
  ornament of the book-cover that lay on my wife's sewing-machine in the
  breakfast-room recalled with the utmost vividness the gilt line that ran
  about the seat in the alcove where I had talked with the messenger from my
  deserted party. Have you ever heard of a dream that had a quality like
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Like&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"So that afterwards you remembered little details you had forgotten."</p>

  <p>I thought. I had never noticed the point before, but he was right.</p>

  <p>"Never," I said. "That is what you never seem to do with dreams."</p>

  <p>"No," he answered. "But that is just what I did. I am a solicitor, you
  must understand, in Liverpool, and I could not help wondering what the
  clients and business people I found myself talking to in my office would
  think if I told them suddenly I was in love with a girl who would be born a
  couple of hundred years or so hence, and worried about the politics of my
  great-great-great-grandchildren. I was chiefly busy that day negotiating a
  ninety-nine-year building lease. It was a private builder in a hurry, and we
  wanted to tie him in every possible way. I had an interview with him, and he
  showed a certain want of temper that sent me to bed still irritated. That
  night I had no dream. Nor did I dream the next night, at least, to
  remember.</p>

  <p>"Something of that intense reality of conviction vanished. I began to feel
  sure it was a dream. And then it came again.</p>

  <p>"When the dream came again, nearly four days later, it was very different.
  I think it certain that four days had also elapsed in the dream. Many things
  had happened in the north, and the shadow of them was back again between us,
  and this time it was not so easily dispelled. I began I know with moody
  musings. Why, in spite of all, should I go back, go back for all the rest of
  my days to toil and stress, insults and perpetual dissatisfaction, simply to
  save hundreds of millions of common people, whom I did not love, whom too
  often I could do no other than despise, from the stress and anguish of war
  and infinite misrule? And after all I might fail. They all sought their own
  narrow ends, and why should not I&mdash;why should not I also live as a man?
  And out of such thoughts her voice summoned me, and I lifted my eyes.</p>

  <p>I found myself awake and walking. We had come out above the Pleasure City,
  we were near the summit of Monte Solaro and looking towards the bay. It was
  the late afternoon and very clear. Far away to the left Ischia hung in a
  golden haze between sea and sky, and Naples was coldly white against the
  hills, and before us was Vesuvius with a tall and slender streamer feathering
  at last towards the south, and the ruins of Torre dell' Annunziata and
  Castellammare glittering and near."</p>

  <p>I interrupted suddenly: "You have been to Capri, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Only in this dream," he said, "only in this dream. All across the bay
  beyond Sorrento were the floating palaces of the Pleasure City moored and
  chained. And northward were the broad floating stages that received the
  aeroplanes. Aeroplanes fell out of the sky every afternoon, each bringing its
  thousands of pleasure-seekers from the uttermost parts of the earth to Capri
  and its delights. All these things, I say, stretched below.</p>

  <p>"But we noticed them only incidentally because of an unusual sight that
  evening had to show. Five war aeroplanes that had long slumbered useless in
  the distant arsenals of the Rhinemouth were manoeuvring now in the eastward
  sky. Evesham had astonished the world by producing them and others, and
  sending them to circle here and there. It was the threat material in the
  great game of bluff he was playing, and it had taken even me by surprise. He
  was one of those incredibly stupid energetic people who seem sent by heaven
  to create disasters. His energy to the first glance seemed so wonderfully
  like capacity! But he had no imagination, no invention, only a stupid, vast,
  driving force of will, and a mad faith in his stupid idiot 'luck' to pull him
  through. I remember how we stood upon the headland watching the squadron
  circling far away, and how I weighed the full meaning of the sight, seeing
  clearly the way things must go. And then even it was not too late.</p>

  <p>I might have gone back, I think, and saved the world. The people of the
  north would follow me, I knew, granted only that in one thing I respected
  their moral standards. The east and south would trust me as they would trust
  no other northern man. And I knew I had only to put it to her and she would
  have let me go...Not because she did not love me!</p>

  <p>"Only I did not want to go; my will was all the other way about. I had so
  newly thrown off the incubus of responsibility: I was still so fresh a
  renegade from duty that the daylight clearness of what I ought to do had no
  power at all to touch my will. My will was to live, to gather pleasures and
  make my dear lady happy. But though this sense of vast neglected duties had
  no power to draw me, it could make me silent and preoccupied, it robbed the
  days I had spent of half their brightness and roused me into dark meditations
  in the silence of the night. And as I stood and watched Evesham's aeroplanes
  sweep to and fro&mdash;those birds of infinite ill omen&mdash;she stood
  beside me watching me, perceiving the trouble indeed, but not perceiving it
  clearly&mdash;her eyes questioning my face, her expression shaded with
  perplexity. Her face was gray because the sunset was fading out of the sky.
  It was no fault of hers that she held me. She had asked me to go from her,
  and again in the night time and with tears she had asked me to go.</p>

  <p>"At last it was the sense of her that roused me from my mood. I turned
  upon her suddenly and challenged her to race down the mountain slopes. 'No,'
  she said, as if I had jarred with her gravity, but I was resolved to end that
  gravity, and make her run&mdash;no one can be very gray and sad who is out of
  breath&mdash;and when she stumbled I ran with my hand beneath her arm. We ran
  down past a couple of men, who turned back staring in astonishment at my
  behaviour&mdash;they must have recognised my face. And half way down the
  slope came a tumult in the air, clang-clank, clang-clank, and we stopped, and
  presently over the hill-crest those war things came flying one behind the
  other."</p>

  <p>The man seemed hesitating on the verge of a description.</p>

  <p>"What were they like?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"They had never fought," he said. "They were just like our ironclads are
  nowadays; they had never fought. No one knew what they might do, with excited
  men inside them; few even cared to speculate. They were great driving things
  shaped like spear-heads without a shaft, with a propeller in the place of the
  shaft."</p>

  <p>"Steel?"</p>

  <p>"Not steel."</p>

  <p>"Aluminum?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, nothing of that sort. An alloy that was very common&mdash;as
  common as brass, for example. It was called&mdash;let me see&mdash;" He
  squeezed his forehead with the fingers of one hand. "I am forgetting
  everything," he said.</p>

  <p>"And they carried guns?"</p>

  <p>"Little guns, firing high explosive shells. They fired the guns backwards,
  out of the base of the leaf, so to speak, and rammed with the beak. That was
  the theory, you know, but they had never been fought. No one could tell
  exactly what was going to happen. And meanwhile I suppose it was very fine to
  go whirling through the air like a flight of young swallows, swift and easy.
  I guess the captains tried not to think too clearly what the real thing would
  be like. And these flying war machines, you know, were only one sort of the
  endless war contrivances that had been invented and had fallen into abeyance
  during the long peace. There were all sorts of these things that people were
  routing out and furbishing up; infernal things, silly things; things that had
  never been tried; big engines, terrible explosives, great guns. You know the
  silly way of these ingenious sort of men who make these things; they turn 'em
  out as beavers build dams, and with no more sense of the rivers they're going
  to divert and the lands they're going to flood!</p>

  <p>"As we went down the winding stepway to our hotel again, in the twilight,
  I foresaw it all: I saw how clearly and inevitably things were driving for
  war in Evesham's silly, violent hands, and I had some inkling of what war was
  bound to be under these new conditions. And even then, though I knew it was
  drawing near the limit of my opportunity, I could find no will to go
  back."</p>

  <p>He sighed.</p>

  <p>"That was my last chance.</p>

  <p>"We didn't go into the city until the sky was full of stars, so we walked
  out upon the high terrace, to and fro, and&mdash;she counselled me to go
  back.</p>

  <p>"'My dearest,' she said, and her sweet face looked up to me, 'this is
  Death. This life you lead is Death. Go back to them, go back to your duty
  &mdash;'</p>

  <p>"She began to weep, saying, between her sobs, and clinging to my arm as
  she said it, 'Go back&mdash;Go back.'</p>

  <p>"Then suddenly she fell mute, and, glancing down at her face, I read in an
  instant the thing she had thought to do. It was one of those moments when one
  sees.</p>

  <p>"'No!' I said.</p>

  <p>"'No?' she asked, in surprise and I think a little fearful at the answer
  to her thought.</p>

  <p>"'Nothing,' I said, 'shall send me back. Nothing! I have chosen. Love, I
  have chosen, and the world must go. Whatever happens I will live this life
  &mdash;I will live for you! It&mdash;nothing shall turn me aside; nothing, my
  dear one. Even if you died&mdash;even if you died&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Yes?' she murmured, softly.</p>

  <p>"'Then&mdash;I also would die.'</p>

  <p>"And before she could speak again I began to talk, talking eloquently
  &mdash;as I could do in that life&mdash;talking to exalt love, to make the
  life we were living seem heroic and glorious; and the thing I was deserting
  something hard and enormously ignoble that it was a fine thing to set aside.
  I bent all my mind to throw that glamour upon it, seeking not only to convert
  her but myself to that. We talked, and she clung to me, torn too between all
  that she deemed noble and all that she knew was sweet. And at last I did make
  it heroic, made all the thickening disaster of the world only a sort of
  glorious setting to our unparalleled love, and we two poor foolish souls
  strutted there at last, clad in that splendid delusion, drunken rather with
  that glorious delusion, under the still stars.</p>

  <p>"And so my moment passed.</p>

  <p>"It was my last chance. Even as we went to and fro there, the leaders of
  the south and east were gathering their resolve, and the hot answer that
  shattered Evesham's bluffing for ever, took shape and waited. And, all over
  Asia, and the ocean, and the South, the air and the wires were throbbing with
  their warnings to prepare&mdash;prepare.</p>

  <p>"No one living, you know, knew what war was; no one could imagine, with
  all these new inventions, what horror war might bring. I believe most people
  still believed it would be a matter of bright uniforms and shouting charges
  and triumphs and flags and bands&mdash;in a time when half the world drew its
  food supply from regions ten thousand miles away&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The man with the white face paused. I glanced at him, and his face was
  intent on the floor of the carriage. A little railway station, a string of
  loaded trucks, a signal-box, and the back of a cottage, shot by the carriage
  window, and a bridge passed with a clap of noise, echoing the tumult of the
  train.</p>

  <p>"After that," he said, "I dreamt often. For three weeks of nights that
  dream was my life. And the worst of it was there were nights when I could not
  dream, when I lay tossing on a bed in this accursed life; and
  there&mdash;somewhere lost to me&mdash;things were happening&mdash;momentous,
  terrible things...I lived at nights&mdash;my days, my waking days, this life
  I am living now, became a faded, far-away dream, a drab setting, the cover of
  the book."</p>

  <p>He thought.</p>

  <p>"I could tell you all, tell you every little thing in the dream, but as to
  what I did in the daytime&mdash;no. I could not tell&mdash;I do not remember.
  My memory&mdash;my memory has gone. The business of life slips from
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He leant forward, and pressed his hands upon his eyes. For a long time he
  said nothing.</p>

  <p>"And then?" said I.</p>

  <p>"The war burst like a hurricane."</p>

  <p>He stared before him at unspeakable things.</p>

  <p>"And then?" I urged again.</p>

  <p>"One touch of unreality," he said, in the low tone of a man who speaks to
  himself," and they would have been nightmares. But they were not nightmares
  &mdash;they were not nightmares. No!"</p>

  <p>He was silent for so long that it dawned upon me that there was a danger
  of losing the rest of the story. But he went on talking again in the same
  tone of questioning self-communion.</p>

  <p>"What was there to do but flight? I had not thought the war would touch
  Capri&mdash;I had seemed to see Capri as being out of it all, as the contrast
  to it all; but two nights after the whole place was shouting and bawling,
  every woman almost and every other man wore a badge&mdash;Evesham's
  badge&mdash;and there was no music but a jangling war-song over and over
  again, and everywhere men enlisting, and in the dancing halls they were
  drilling. The whole island was awhirl with rumours; it was said, again and
  again, that fighting had begun. I had not expected this. I had seen so little
  of the life of pleasure that I had failed to reckon with this violence of the
  amateurs. And as for me, I was out of it. I was like the man who might have
  prevented the firing of a magazine. The time had gone. I was no one; the
  vainest stripling with a badge counted for more than I. The crowd jostled us
  and bawled in our ears; that accursed song deafened us; a woman shrieked at
  my lady because no badge was on her, and we two went back to our own place
  again, ruffled and insulted&mdash;my lady white and silent, and I aquiver
  with rage. So furious was I, I could have quarrelled with her if I could have
  found one shade of accusation in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"All my magnificence had gone from me. I walked up and down our rock cell,
  and outside was the darkling sea and a light to the southward that flared and
  passed and came again.</p>

  <p>"'We must get out of this place,' I said over and over. 'I have made my
  choice, and I will have no hand in these troubles. I will have nothing of
  this war. We have taken our lives out of all these things. This is no refuge
  for us. Let us go.'</p>

  <p>"And the next day we were already in flight from the war that covered the
  world.</p>

  <p>"And all the rest was Flight&mdash;all the rest was Flight."</p>

  <p>He mused darkly.</p>

  <p>"How much was there of it?"</p>

  <p>He made no answer.</p>

  <p>"How many days?"</p>

  <p>His face was white and drawn and his hands were clenched. He took no heed
  of my curiosity.</p>

  <p>I tried to draw him back to his story with questions.</p>

  <p>"Where did you go?" I said.</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"When you left Capri."</p>

  <p>"South-west," he said, and glanced at me for a second. "We went in a
  boat."</p>

  <p>"But I should have thought an aeroplane?"</p>

  <p>"They had been seized."</p>

  <p>I questioned him no more. Presently I thought he was beginning again. He
  broke out in an argumentative monotone:</p>

  <p>"But why should it be? If, indeed, this battle, this slaughter and stress
  is life, why have we this craving for pleasure and beauty? If there is no
  refuge, if there is no place of peace, and if all our dreams of quiet places
  are a folly and a snare, why have we such dreams? Surely it was no ignoble
  cravings, no base intentions, had brought us to this; it was Love had
  isolated us. Love had come to me with her eyes and robed in her beauty, more
  glorious than all else in life, in the very shape and colour of life, and
  summoned me away. I had silenced all the voices, I had answered all the
  questions&mdash;I had come to her. And suddenly there was nothing but War and
  Death!"</p>

  <p>I had an inspiration. " After all," I said, "it could have been only a
  dream."</p>

  <p>"A dream!" he cried, flaming upon me, "a dream&mdash;when, even
  now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>For the first time he became animated. A faint flush crept into his cheek.
  He raised his open hand and clenched it, and dropped it to his knee. He
  spoke, looking away from me, and for all the rest of the time he looked away.
  "We are but phantoms!" he said, "and the phantoms of phantoms, desires like
  cloud-shadows and wills of straw that eddy in the wind; the days pass, use
  and wont carry us through as a train carries the shadow of its
  lights&mdash;so be it! But one thing is real and certain, one thing is no
  dream-stuff, but eternal and enduring. It is the centre of my life, and all
  other things about it are subordinate or altogether vain. I loved her, that
  woman of a dream. And she and I are dead together!</p>

  <p>"A dream! How can it be a dream, when it drenched a living life with
  unappeasable sorrow, when it makes all that I have lived for and cared for,
  worthless and unmeaning?</p>

  <p>"Until that very moment when she was killed I believed we had still a
  chance of getting away," he said. "All through the night and morning that we
  sailed across the sea from Capri to Salerno, we talked of escape. We were
  full of hope, and it clung about us to the end, hope for the life together we
  should lead, out of it all, out of the battle and struggle, the wild and
  empty passions, the empty arbitrary 'thou shalt' and 'thou shalt not' of the
  world. We were uplifted, as though our quest was a holy thing, as though love
  for another was a mission...</p>

  <p>"Even when from our boat we saw the fair face of that great rock Capri
  &mdash;already scarred and gashed by the gun emplacements and hiding-places
  that were to make it a fastness&mdash;we reckoned nothing of the imminent
  slaughter, though the fury of preparation hung about in the puffs and clouds
  of dust at a hundred points amidst the gray; but, indeed, I made a text of
  that and talked. There, you know, was the rock, still beautiful for all its
  scars, with its countless windows and arches and ways, tier upon tier, for a
  thousand feet, a vast carving of gray, broken by vine-clad terraces, and
  lemon and orange groves, and masses of agave and prickly pear, and puffs of
  almond blossom. And out under the archway that is built over the Piccola
  Marina other boats were coming; and as we came round the cape and within
  sight of the mainland, another little string of boats came into view, driving
  before the wind towards the south-west. In a little while a multitude had
  come out, the remoter just little specks of ultramarine in the shadow of the
  eastward cliff.</p>

  <p>"'It is love and reason,' I said, 'fleeing from all this madness of
  war.'</p>

  <p>"And though we presently saw a squadron of aeroplanes flying across the
  southern sky we did not heed it. There it was&mdash;a line of little dots in
  the sky&mdash;and then more, dotting the south-eastern horizon, and then
  still more, until all that quarter of the sky was stippled with blue specks.
  Now they were all thin little strokes of blue, and now one and now a
  multitude would heel and catch the sun and become short flashes of light.
  They came, rising and falling and growing larger, like some huge flight of
  gulls or rooks or such-like birds, moving with a marvellous uniformity, and
  ever as they drew nearer they spread over a greater width of sky. The
  southward wind flung itself in an arrow-headed cloud athwart the sun. And
  then suddenly they swept round to the eastward and streamed eastward, growing
  smaller and smaller and clearer and clearer again until they vanished from
  the sky. And after that we noted to the northward and very high Evesham's
  fighting machines hanging high over Naples like an evening swarm of
  gnats.</p>

  <p>"It seemed to have no more to do with us than a flight of birds.</p>

  <p>"Even the mutter of guns far away in the south-east seemed to us to
  signify nothing...</p>

  <p>"Each day, each dream after that, we were still exalted, still seeking
  that refuge where we might live and love. Fatigue had come upon us, pain and
  many distresses. For though we were dusty and stained by our toilsome
  tramping, and half starved and with the horror of the dead men we had seen
  and the flight of the peasants&mdash;for very soon a gust of fighting swept
  up the peninsula&mdash;with these things haunting our minds it still resulted
  only in a deepening resolution to escape. Oh, but she was brave and patient!
  She who had never faced hardship and exposure had courage for herself and me.
  We went to and fro seeking an outlet, over a country all commandeered and
  ransacked by the gathering hosts of war. Always we went on foot. At first
  there were other fugitives, but we did not mingle with them. Some escaped
  northward, some were caught in the torrent of peasantry that swept along the
  main roads; many gave themselves into the hands of the soldiery and were sent
  northward. Many of the men were impressed. But we kept away from these
  things; we had brought no money to bribe a passage north, and I feared for my
  lady at the hands of these conscript crowds. We had landed at Salerno, and we
  had been turned back from Cava, and we had tried to cross towards Taranto by
  a pass over Mount Alburno, but we had been driven back for want of food, and
  so we had come down among the marshes by Paestum, where those great temples
  stand alone. I had some vague idea that by Paestum it might be possible to
  find a boat or something, and take once more to sea. And there it was the
  battle overtook us.</p>

  <p>"A sort of soul-blindness had me. Plainly I could see that we were being
  hemmed in; that the great net of that giant Warfare had us in its toils. Many
  times we had seen the levies that had come down from the north going to and
  fro, and had come upon them in the distance amidst the mountains making ways
  for the ammunition and preparing the mounting of the guns. Once we fancied
  they had fired at us, taking us for spies&mdash;at any rate a shot had gone
  shuddering over us. Several times we had hidden in woods from hovering
  aeroplanes.</p>

  <p>"But all these things do not matter now, these nights of flight and pain
  ...We were in an open place near those great temples at Paestum, at last, on
  a blank stony place dotted with spiky bushes, empty and desolate and so flat
  that a grove of eucalyptus far away showed to the feet of its stems. How I
  can see it! My lady was sitting down under a bush resting a little, for she
  was very weak and weary, and I was standing up watching to see if I could
  tell the distance of the firing that came and went. They were still, you
  know, fighting far from each other, with those terrible new weapons that had
  never before been used: guns that would carry beyond sight, and aeroplanes
  that would do&mdash;What they would do no man could foretell.</p>

  <p>"I knew that we were between the two armies, and that they drew together.
  I knew we were in danger, and that we could not stop there and rest!</p>

  <p>"Though all these things were in my mind, they were in the background.
  They seemed to be affairs beyond our concern. Chiefly, I was thinking of my
  lady. An aching distress filled me. For the first time she had owned herself
  beaten and had fallen a-weeping. Behind me I could hear her sobbing, but I
  would not turn round to her because I knew she had need of weeping, and had
  held herself so far and so long for me. It was well, I thought, that she
  would weep and rest and then we would toil on again, for I had no inkling of
  the thing that hung so near. Even now I can see her as she sat there, her
  lovely hair upon her shoulder, can mark again the deepening hollow of her
  cheek.</p>

  <p>"'If we had parted,' she said, 'if I had let you go.'</p>

  <p>"'No,' said I.' Even now, I do not repent. I will not repent; I made my
  choice, and I will hold on to the end.'</p>

  <p>"And then&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Overhead in the sky flashed something and burst, and all about us I heard
  the bullets making a noise like a handful of peas suddenly thrown. They
  chipped the stones about us, and whirled fragments from the bricks and passed
  ..."</p>

  <p>He put his hand to his mouth, and then moistened his lips.</p>

  <p>"At the flash I had turned about...</p>

  <p>"You know&mdash;she stood up&mdash;</p>

  <p>"She stood up, you know, and moved a step towards me&mdash;as though she
  wanted to reach me&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And she had been shot through the heart."</p>

  <p>He stopped and stared at me. I felt all that foolish incapacity an
  Englishman feels on such occasions. I met his eyes for a moment, and then
  stared out of the window. For a long space we kept silence. When at last I
  looked at him he was sitting back in his corner, his arms folded, and his
  teeth gnawing at his knuckles.</p>

  <p>He bit his nail suddenly, and stared at it.</p>

  <p>"I carried her," he said, "towards the temples, in my arms&mdash;as though
  it mattered. I don't know why. They seemed a sort of sanctuary, you know,
  they had lasted so long, I suppose.</p>

  <p>"She must have died almost instantly. Only&mdash;I talked to her all the
  way."</p>

  <p>Silence again.</p>

  <p>"I have seen those temples," I said abruptly, and indeed he had brought
  those still, sunlit arcades of worn sandstone very vividly before me.</p>

  <p>"It was the brown one, the big brown one. I sat down on a fallen pillar
  and held her in my arms...Silent after the first babble was over. And after a
  little while the lizards came out and ran about again, as though nothing
  unusual was going on, as though nothing had changed...It was tremendously
  still there, the sun high and the shadows still; even the shadows of the
  weeds upon the entablature were still&mdash;in spite of the thudding and
  banging that went all about the sky.</p>

  <p>"I seem to remember that the aeroplanes came up out of the south, and that
  the battle went away to the west. One aeroplane was struck, and overset and
  fell. I remember that&mdash;though it didn't interest me in the least. It
  didn't seem to signify. It was like a wounded gull, you know&mdash;flapping
  for a time in the water. I could see it down the aisle of the temple&mdash;a
  black thing in the bright blue water.</p>

  <p>"Three or four times shells burst about the beach, and then that ceased.
  Each time that happened all the lizards scuttled in and hid for a space. That
  was all the mischief done, except that once a stray bullet gashed the stone
  hard by&mdash;made just a fresh bright surface.</p>

  <p>"As the shadows grew longer, the stillness seemed greater.</p>

  <p>"The curious thing," he remarked, with the manner of a man who makes a
  trivial conversation, "is that I didn't <i>think</i>&mdash;at all. I sat with
  her in my arms amidst the stones&mdash;in a sort of
  lethargy&mdash;stagnant.</p>

  <p>"And I don't remember waking up. I don't remember dressing that day. I
  know I found myself in my office, with my letters all slit open in front of
  me, and how I was struck by the absurdity of being there, seeing that in
  reality I was sitting, stunned, in that Paestum Temple with a dead woman in
  my arms. I read my letters like a machine. I have forgotten what they were
  about."</p>

  <p>He stopped, and there was a long silence.</p>

  <p>Suddenly I perceived that we were running down the incline from Chalk Farm
  to Euston. I started at this passing of time. I turned on him with a brutal
  question, with the tone of "Now or never."</p>

  <p>"And did you dream again?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He seemed to force himself to finish. His voice was very low.</p>

  <p>"Once more, and as it were only for a few instants. I seemed to have
  suddenly awakened out of a great apathy, to have risen into a sitting
  position, and the body lay there on the stones beside me.</p>

  <p>A gaunt body. Not her, you know. So soon&mdash;it was not her...</p>

  <p>"I may have heard voices. I do not know. Only I knew clearly that men were
  coming into the solitude and that that was a last outrage.</p>

  <p>"I stood up and walked through the temple, and then there came into sight
  &mdash;first one man with a yellow face, dressed in a uniform of dirty white,
  trimmed with blue, and then several, climbing to the crest of the old wall of
  the vanished city, and crouching there. They were little bright figures in
  the sunlight, and there they hung, weapon in hand, peering cautiously before
  them.</p>

  <p>"And further away I saw others and then more at another point in the wall.
  It was a long lax line of men in open order.</p>

  <p>"Presently the man I had first seen stood up and shouted a command, and
  his men came tumbling down the wall and into the high weeds towards the
  temple. He scrambled down with them and led them. He came facing towards me,
  and when he saw me he stopped.</p>

  <p>"At first I had watched these men with a mere curiosity, but when I had
  seen they meant to come to the temple I was moved to forbid them. I shouted
  to the officer.</p>

  <p>"'You must not come here,' I cried, '<i>I</i> am here. I am here with my
  dead.'</p>

  <p>"He stared, and then shouted a question back to me in some unknown
  tongue.</p>

  <p>"I repeated what I had said.</p>

  <p>"He shouted again, and I folded my arms and stood still. Presently he
  spoke to his men and came forward. He carried a drawn sword.</p>

  <p>"I signed to him to keep away, but he continued to advance. I told him
  again very patiently and clearly: 'You must not come here. These are old
  temples and I am here with my dead.'</p>

  <p>"Presently he was so close I could see his face clearly. It was a narrow
  face, with dull gray eyes, and a black moustache. He had a scar on his upper
  lip, and he was dirty and unshaven. He kept shouting unintelligible things,
  questions, perhaps, at me.</p>

  <p>"I know now that he was afraid of me, but at the time that did not occur
  to me. As I tried to explain to him, he interrupted me in imperious tones,
  bidding me, I suppose, stand aside.</p>

  <p>"He made to go past me, and I caught hold of him.</p>

  <p>"I saw his face change at my grip.</p>

  <p>"'You fool,' I cried. 'Don't you know? She is dead!'</p>

  <p>"He started back. He looked at me with cruel eyes. I saw a sort of
  exultant resolve leap into them&mdash;delight. Then, suddenly, with a scowl,
  he swept his sword back&mdash;<i>so</i>&mdash;and thrust."</p>

  <p>He stopped abruptly.</p>

  <p>I became aware of a change in the rhythm of the train. The brakes lifted
  their voices and the carriage jarred and jerked. This present world insisted
  upon itself, became clamourous. I saw through the steamy window huge electric
  fights glaring down from tall masts upon a fog, saw rows of stationary empty
  carriages passing by, and then a signal-box hoisting its constellation of
  green and red into the murky London twilight, marched after them. I looked
  again at his drawn features.</p>

  <p>"He ran me through the heart. It was with a sort of astonishment&mdash;no
  fear, no pain&mdash;but just amazement, that I felt it pierce me, felt the
  sword drive home into my body. It didn't hurt, you know. It didn't hurt at
  all."</p>

  <p>The yellow platform lights came into the field of view, passing first
  rapidly, then slowly, and at last stopping with a jerk. Dim shapes of men
  passed to and fro without.</p>

  <p>"Euston!" cried a voice.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"There was no pain, no sting or smart. Amazement and then darkness
  sweeping over everything. The hot, brutal face before me, the face of the man
  who had killed me, seemed to recede. It swept out of existence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Euston!" clamoured the voices outside; "Euston!"</p>

  <p>The carriage door opened admitting a flood of sound, and a porter stood
  regarding us. The sounds of doors slamming, and the hoof-clatter of
  cab-horses, and behind these things the featureless remote roar of the London
  cobble-stones, came to my ears. A truckload of lighted lamps blazed along the
  platform.</p>

  <p>"A darkness, a flood of darkness that opened and spread and blotted out
  all things."</p>

  <p>"Any luggage, sir?" said the porter.</p>

  <p>"And that was the end?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He seemed to hesitate. Then, almost inaudibly, he answered,
  <i>"No."</i></p>

  <p>"You mean?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't get to her. She was there on the other side of the temple
  &mdash;And then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I insisted. "Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Nightmares," he cried; "nightmares indeed! My God! Great birds that
  fought and tore."</p>

     name="story57">FILMER</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Graphic</i>, December 1901</h3>

  <p>In truth the mastery of flying was the work of thousands of men&mdash;this
  man a suggestion and that an experiment, until at last only one vigorous
  intellectual effort was needed to finish the work. But the inexorable
  injustice of the popular mind has decided that of all these thousands, one
  man, and that a man who never flew, should be chosen as the discoverer, just
  as it has chosen to honour Watt as the discoverer of steam and Stephenson of
  the steam-engine. And surely of all honoured names none is so grotesquely and
  tragically honoured as poor Filmer's, the timid, intellectual creature who
  solved the problem over which the world had hung perplexed and a little
  fearful for so many generations, the man who pressed the button that has
  changed peace and warfare and well-nigh every condition of human life and
  happiness. Never has that recurring wonder of the littleness of the
  scientific man in the face of the greatness of his science found such an
  amazing exemplification. Much concerning Filmer is, and must remain,
  profoundly obscure&mdash;Filmers attract no Boswells&mdash;but the essential
  facts and the concluding scene are clear enough, and there are letters, and
  notes, and casual allusions to piece the whole together. And this is the
  story one makes, putting this thing with that, of Filmer's life and
  death.</p>

  <p>The first authentic trace of Filmer on the page of history is a document
  in which he applies for admission as a paid student in physics to the
  Government laboratories at South Kensington, and therein he describes himself
  as the son of a "military bootmaker" ("cobbler" in the vulgar tongue) of
  Dover, and lists his various examination proofs of a high proficiency in
  chemistry and mathematics. With a certain want of dignity he seeks to enhance
  these attainments by a profession of poverty and disadvantages, and he writes
  of the laboratory as the "gaol" of his ambitions, a slip which reinforces his
  claim to have devoted himself exclusively to the exact sciences. The document
  is endorsed in a manner that shows Filmer was admitted to this coveted
  opportunity; but until quite recently no traces of his success in the
  Government institution could be found.</p>

  <p>It has now, however, been shown that in spite of his professed zeal for
  research, Filmer, before he had held this scholarship a year, was tempted, by
  the possibility of a small increase in his immediate income, to abandon it in
  order to become one of the nine-pence-an-hour computers employed by a well-
  known Professor in his vicarious conduct of those extensive researches of his
  in solar physics&mdash;researches which are still a matter of perplexity to
  astronomers. Afterwards, for the space of seven years, save for the pass
  lists of the London University, in which he is seen to climb slowly to a
  double first class B.Sc., in mathematics and chemistry, there is no evidence
  of how Filmer passed his life. No one knows how or where he lived, though it
  seems highly probable that he continued to support himself by teaching while
  he prosecuted the studies necessary for this distinction. And then, oddly
  enough, one finds him mentioned in the correspondence of Arthur Hicks, the
  poet.</p>

  <p>"You remember Filmer," Hicks writes to his friend Vance; "well, HE hasn't
  altered a bit, the same hostile mumble and the nasty chin&mdash;how CAN a man
  contrive to be always three days from shaving?&mdash;and a sort of furtive
  air of being engaged in sneaking in front of one; even his coat and that
  frayed collar of his show no further signs of the passing years. He was
  writing in the library and I sat down beside him in the name of God's
  charity, whereupon he deliberately insulted me by covering up his memoranda.
  It seems he has some brilliant research on hand that he suspects me of all
  people&mdash;with a Bodley Booklet a-printing!&mdash;of stealing. He has
  taken remarkable honours at the University&mdash;he went through them with a
  sort of hasty slobber, as though he feared I might interrupt him before he
  had told me all&mdash;and he spoke of taking his D.Sc. as one might speak of
  taking a cab. And he asked what I was doing&mdash;with a sort of comparative
  accent, and his arm was spread nervously, positively a protecting arm, over
  the paper that hid the precious idea&mdash;his one hopeful idea.</p>

  <p>"'Poetry,' he said, 'Poetry. And what do you profess to teach in it,
  Hicks?'</p>

  <p>"The thing's a Provincial professorling in the very act of budding, and I
  thank the Lord devoutly that but for the precious gift of indolence I also
  might have gone this way to D.Sc. and destruction ..."</p>

  <p>A curious little vignette that I am inclined to think caught Filmer in or
  near the very birth of his discovery. Hicks was wrong in anticipating a
  provincial professorship for Filmer. Our next glimpse of him is lecturing on
  "rubber and rubber substitutes," to the Society of Arts&mdash;he had become
  manager to a great plastic-substance manufactory&mdash;and at that time, it
  is now known, he was a member of the Aeronautical Society, albeit he
  contributed nothing to the discussions of that body, preferring no doubt to
  mature his great conception without external assistance. And within two years
  of that paper before the Society of Arts he was hastily taking out a number
  of patents and proclaiming in various undignified ways the completion of the
  divergent inquiries which made his flying machine possible. The first
  definite statement to that effect appeared in a halfpenny evening paper
  through the agency of a man who lodged in the same house with Filmer. His
  final haste after his long laborious secret patience seems to have been due
  to a needless panic, Bootle, the notorious American scientific quack, having
  made an announcement that Filmer interpreted wrongly as an anticipation of
  his idea.</p>

  <p>Now what precisely was Filmer's idea? Really a very simple one. Before his
  time the pursuit of aeronautics had taken two divergent lines, and had
  developed on the one hand balloons&mdash;large apparatus lighter than air,
  easy in ascent, and comparatively safe in descent, but floating helplessly
  before any breeze that took them; and on the other, flying machines that flew
  only in theory&mdash;vast flat structures heavier than air, propelled and
  kept up by heavy engines and for the most part smashing at the first descent.
  But, neglecting the fact that the inevitable final collapse rendered them
  impossible, the weight of the flying machines gave them this theoretical
  advantage, that they could go through the air against a wind, a necessary
  condition if aerial navigation was to have any practical value. It is
  Filmer's particular merit that he perceived the way in which the contrasted
  and hitherto incompatible merits of balloon and heavy flying machine might be
  combined in one apparatus, which should be at choice either heavier or
  lighter than air. He took hints from the contractile bladders of fish and the
  pneumatic cavities of birds. He devised an arrangement of contractile and
  absolutely closed balloons which when expanded could lift the actual flying
  apparatus with ease, and when retracted by the complicated "musculature" he
  wove about them, were withdrawn almost completely into the frame; and he
  built the large framework which these balloons sustained, of hollow, rigid
  tubes, the air in which, by an ingenious contrivance, was automatically
  pumped out as the apparatus fell, and which then remained exhausted so long
  as the aeronaut desired. There were no wings or propellers to his machine,
  such as there had been to all previous aeroplanes, and the only engine
  required was the compact and powerful little appliance needed to contract the
  balloons. He perceived that such an apparatus as he had devised might rise
  with frame exhausted and balloons expanded to a considerable height, might
  then contract its balloons and let the air into its frame, and by an
  adjustment of its weights slide down the air in any desired direction. As it
  fell it would accumulate velocity and at the same time lose weight, and the
  momentum accumulated by its down-rush could be utilised by means of a
  shifting of its weights to drive it up in the air again as the balloons
  expanded. This conception, which is still the structural conception of all
  successful flying machines, needed, however, a vast amount of toil upon its
  details before it could actually be realised, and such toil Filmer&mdash;as
  he was accustomed to tell the numerous interviewers who crowded upon him in
  the heyday of his fame&mdash;"ungrudgingly and unsparingly gave." His
  particular difficulty was the elastic lining of the contractile balloon. He
  found he needed a new substance, and in the discovery and manufacture of that
  new substance he had, as he never failed to impress upon the interviewers,
  "performed a far more arduous work than even in the actual achievement of my
  seemingly greater discovery."</p>

  <p>But it must not be imagined that these interviews followed hard upon
  Filmer's proclamation of his invention. An interval of nearly five years
  elapsed during which he timidly remained at his rubber factory&mdash;he seems
  to have been entirely dependent on his small income from this
  source&mdash;making misdirected attempts to assure a quite indifferent public
  that he really <i>had</i> invented what he had invented. He occupied the
  greater part of his leisure in the composition of letters to the scientific
  and daily press, and so forth, stating precisely the net result of his
  contrivances, and demanding financial aid. That alone would have sufficed for
  the suppression of his letters. He spent such holidays as he could arrange in
  unsatisfactory interviews with the door-keepers of leading London
  papers&mdash;he was singularly not adapted for inspiring hall-porters with
  confidence&mdash;and he positively attempted to induce the War Office to take
  up his work with him. There remains a confidential letter from Major-General
  Volleyfire to the Earl of Frogs. "The man's a crank and a bounder to boot,"
  says the Major-General in his bluff, sensible, army way, and so left it open
  for the Japanese to secure, as they subsequently did, the priority in this
  side of warfare&mdash;a priority they still to our great discomfort
  retain.</p>

  <p>And then by a stroke of luck the membrane Filmer had invented for his
  contractile balloon was discovered to be useful for the valves of a new oil-
  engine, and he obtained the means for making a trial model of his invention.
  He threw up his rubber factory appointment, desisted from all further
  writing, and, with a certain secrecy that seems to have been an inseparable
  characteristic of all his proceedings, set to work upon the apparatus. He
  seems to have directed the making of its parts and collected most of it in a
  room in Shoreditch, but its final putting together was done at Dymchurch, in
  Kent. He did not make the affair large enough to carry a man, but he made an
  extremely ingenious use of what were then called the Marconi rays to control
  its flight. The first flight of this first practicable flying machine took
  place over some fields near Burford Bridge, near Hythe, in Kent, and Filmer
  followed and controlled its flight upon a specially constructed motor
  tricycle.</p>

  <p>The flight was, considering all things, an amazing success. The apparatus
  was brought in a cart from Dymchurch to Burford Bridge, ascended there to a
  height of nearly three hundred feet, swooped thence very nearly back to
  Dymchurch, came about in its sweep, rose again, circled, and finally sank
  uninjured in a field behind the Burford Bridge Inn. At its descent a curious
  thing happened. Filmer got off his tricycle, scrambled over the intervening
  dyke, advanced perhaps twenty yards towards his triumph, threw out his arms
  in a strange gesticulation, and fell down in a dead faint. Every one could
  then recall the ghastliness of his features and all the evidences of extreme
  excitement they had observed throughout the trial, things they might
  otherwise have forgotten. Afterwards in the inn he had an unaccountable gust
  of hysterical weeping.</p>

  <p>Altogether there were not twenty witnesses of this affair, and those for
  the most part uneducated men. The New Romney doctor saw the ascent but not
  the descent, his horse being frightened by the electrical apparatus on
  Filmer's tricycle and giving him a nasty spill. Two members of the Kent
  constabulary watched the affair from a cart in an unofficial spirit, and a
  grocer calling round the Marsh for orders and two lady cyclists seem almost
  to complete the list of educated people. There were two reporters present,
  one representing a Folkestone paper and the other being a fourth-class
  interviewer and "symposium" journalist, whose expenses down, Filmer, anxious
  as ever for adequate advertisement&mdash;and now quite realising the way in
  which adequate advertisement may be obtained&mdash;had paid. The latter was
  one of those writers who can throw a convincing air of unreality over the
  most credible events, and his half-facetious account of the affair appeared
  in the magazine page of a popular journal. But, happily for Filmer, this
  person's colloquial methods were more convincing. He went to offer some
  further screed upon the subject to Banghurst, the proprietor of the <i>New
  Paper</i>, and one of the ablest and most unscrupulous men in London
  journalism, and Banghurst instantly seized upon the situation. The
  interviewer vanishes from the narrative, no doubt very doubtfully
  remunerated, and Banghurst, Banghurst himself, double chin, grey twill suit,
  abdomen, voice, gestures and all, appears at Dymchurch, following his large,
  unrivalled journalistic nose. He had seen the whole thing at a glance, just
  what it was and what it might be.</p>

  <p>At his touch, as it were, Filmer's long-pent investigations exploded into
  fame. He instantly and most magnificently was a Boom. One turns over the
  files of the journals of the year 1907 with a quite incredulous recognition
  of how swift and flaming the boom of those days could be. The July papers
  know nothing of flying, see nothing in flying, state by a most effective
  silence that men never would, could or should fly. In August flying and
  Filmer and flying and parachutes and aerial tactics and the Japanese
  Government and Filmer and again flying, shouldered the war in Yunnan and the
  gold mines of Upper Greenland off the leading page. And Banghurst had given
  ten thousand pounds, and, further, Banghurst was giving five thousand pounds,
  and Banghurst had devoted his well-known, magnificent (but hitherto sterile)
  private laboratories and several acres of land near his private residence on
  the Surrey hills to the strenuous and violent completion&mdash;Banghurst
  fashion&mdash;of the life-size practicable flying machine. Meanwhile, in the
  sight of privileged multitudes in the walled-garden of the Banghurst town
  residence in Fulham, Filmer was exhibited at weekly garden parties putting
  the working model through its paces. At enormous initial cost, but with a
  final profit, the <i>New Paper</i> presented its readers with a beautiful
  photographic souvenir of the first of these occasions.</p>

  <p>Here again the correspondence of Arthur Hicks and his friend Vance comes
  to our aid.</p>

  <p>"I saw Filmer in his glory," he writes, with just the touch of envy
  natural to his position as a poet passe. "The man is brushed and shaved,
  dressed in the fashion of a Royal-Institution-Afternoon Lecturer, the very
  newest shape in frock-coats and long patent shoes, and altogether in a state
  of extraordinary streakiness between an owlish great man and a scared abashed
  self-conscious bounder cruelly exposed. He hasn't a touch of colour in the
  skin of his face, his head juts forward, and those queer little dark amber
  eyes of his watch furtively round him for his fame. His clothes fit perfectly
  and yet sit upon him as though he had bought them ready-made. He speaks in a
  mumble still, but he says, you perceive indistinctly, enormous self-assertive
  things, he backs into the rear of groups by instinct if Banghurst drops the
  line for a minute, and when he walks across Banghurst's lawn one perceives
  him a little out of breath and going jerky, and that his weak white hands are
  clenched. His is a state of tension&mdash;horrible tension. And he is the
  Greatest Discoverer of This or Any Age&mdash;the Greatest Discoverer of This
  or Any Age! What strikes one so forcibly about him is that he didn't somehow
  quite expect it ever, at any rate, not at all like this. Banghurst is about
  everywhere, the energetic M.C. of his great little catch, and I swear he will
  have every one down on his lawn there before he has finished with the engine;
  he had bagged the prime minister yesterday, and he, bless his heart! didn't
  look particularly outsize, on the very first occasion. Conceive it! Filmer!
  Our obscure unwashed Filmer, the Glory of British science! Duchesses crowd
  upon him, beautiful, bold peeresses say in their beautiful, clear loud voices
  &mdash;have you noticed how penetrating the great lady is becoming nowadays?
  &mdash;'Oh, Mr. Filmer, how DID you do it?'</p>

  <p>"Common men on the edge of things are too remote for the answer. One
  imagines something in the way of that interview, 'toil ungrudgingly and
  unsparingly given, Madam, and, perhaps&mdash;I don't know&mdash;but perhaps a
  little special aptitude.'"</p>

  <p>So far Hicks, and the photographic supplement to the <i>New Paper</i> is
  in sufficient harmony with the description. In one picture the machine swings
  down towards the river, and the tower of Fulham church appears below it
  through a gap in the elms, and in another, Filmer sits at his guiding
  batteries, and the great and beautiful of the earth stand around him, with
  Banghurst massed modestly but resolutely in the rear. The grouping is oddly
  apposite. Occluding much of Banghurst, and looking with a pensive,
  speculative expression at Filmer, stands the Lady Mary Elkinghorn, still
  beautiful, in spite of the breath of scandal and her eight-and-thirty years,
  the only person whose face does not admit a perception of the camera that was
  in the act of snapping them all.</p>

  <p>So much for the exterior facts of the story, but, after all, they are very
  exterior facts. About the real interest of the business one is necessarily
  very much in the dark. How was Filmer feeling at the time? How much was a
  certain unpleasant anticipation present inside that very new and fashionable
  frock-coat? He was in the halfpenny, penny, six-penny, and more expensive
  papers alike, and acknowledged by the whole world as "the Greatest Discoverer
  of This or Any Age." He had invented a practicable flying machine, and every
  day down among the Surrey hills the life-sized model was getting ready. And
  when it was ready, it followed as a clear inevitable consequence of his
  having invented and made it&mdash;everybody in the world, indeed, seemed to
  take it for granted; there wasn't a gap anywhere in that serried front of
  anticipation&mdash;that he would proudly and cheerfully get aboard it, ascend
  with it, and fly.</p>

  <p>But we know now pretty clearly that simple pride and cheerfulness in such
  an act were singularly out of harmony with Filmer's private constitution. It
  occurred to no one at the time, but there the fact is. We can guess with some
  confidence now that it must have been drifting about in his mind a great deal
  during the day, and, from a little note to his physician complaining of
  persistent insomnia, we have the soundest reason for supposing it dominated
  his nights,&mdash;the idea that it would be after all, in spite of his
  theoretical security, an abominably sickening, uncomfortable, and dangerous
  thing for him to flap about in nothingness a thousand feet or so in the air.
  It must have dawned upon him quite early in the period of being the Greatest
  Discoverer of This or Any Age, the vision of doing this and that with an
  extensive void below. Perhaps somewhen in his youth he had looked down a
  great height or fallen down in some excessively uncomfortable way; perhaps
  some habit of sleeping on the wrong side had resulted in that disagreeable
  falling nightmare one knows, and given him his horror; of the strength of
  that horror there remains now not a particle of doubt.</p>

  <p>Apparently he had never weighed this duty of flying in his earlier days of
  research; the machine had been his end, but now things were opening out
  beyond his end, and particularly this giddy whirl up above there. He was a
  Discoverer and he had Discovered. But he was not a Flying Man, and it was
  only now that he was beginning to perceive clearly that he was expected to
  fly. Yet, however much the thing was present in his mind he gave no
  expression to it until the very end, and meanwhile he went to and fro from
  Banghurst's magnificent laboratories, and was interviewed and lionised, and
  wore good clothes, and ate good food, and lived in an elegant flat, enjoying
  a very abundant feast of such good, coarse, wholesome Fame and Success as a
  man, starved for all his years as he had been starved, might be reasonably
  expected to enjoy.</p>

  <p>After a time, the weekly gatherings in Fulham ceased. The model had failed
  one day just for a moment to respond to Filmer's guidance, or he had been
  distracted by the compliments of an archbishop. At any rate, it suddenly dug
  its nose into the air just a little too steeply as the archbishop was sailing
  through a Latin quotation for all the world like an archbishop in a book, and
  it came down in the Fulham Road within three yards of a 'bus horse. It stood
  for a second perhaps, astonishing and in its attitude astonished, then it
  crumpled, shivered into pieces, and the 'bus horse was incidentally
  killed.</p>

  <p>Filmer lost the end of the archiepiscopal compliment. He stood up and
  stared as his invention swooped out of sight and reach of him. His long,
  white hands still gripped his useless apparatus. The archbishop followed his
  skyward stare with an apprehension unbecoming in an archbishop.</p>

  <p>Then came the crash and the shouts and uproar from the road to relieve
  Filmer's tension. "My God!" he whispered, and sat down.</p>

  <p>Every one else almost was staring to see where the machine had vanished,
  or rushing into the house.</p>

  <p>The making of the big machine progressed all the more rapidly for this.
  Over its making presided Filmer, always a little slow and very careful in his
  manner, always with a growing preoccupation in his mind. His care over the
  strength and soundness of the apparatus was prodigious. The slightest doubt,
  and he delayed everything until the doubtful part could be replaced.
  Wilkinson, his senior assistant, fumed at some of these delays, which, he
  insisted, were for the most part unnecessary. Banghurst magnified the patient
  certitude of Filmer in the <i>New Paper</i>, and reviled it bitterly to his
  wife, and MacAndrew, the second assistant, approved Filmer's wisdom. "We're
  not wanting a fiasco, man," said MacAndrew. "He's perfectly well
  advised."</p>

  <p>And whenever an opportunity arose Filmer would expound to Wilkinson and
  MacAndrew just exactly how every part of the flying machine was to be
  controlled and worked, so that in effect they would be just as capable, and
  even more capable, when at last the time came, of guiding it through the
  skies.</p>

  <p>Now I should imagine that if Filmer had seen fit at this stage to define
  just what he was feeling, and to take a definite line in the matter of his
  ascent, he might have escaped that painful ordeal quite easily. If he had had
  it clearly in his mind he could have done endless things. He would surely
  have found no difficulty with a specialist to demonstrate a weak heart, or
  something gastric or pulmonary, to stand in his way&mdash;that is the line I
  am astonished he did not take,&mdash;or he might, had he been man enough,
  have declared simply and finally that he did not intend to do the thing. But
  the fact is, though the dread was hugely present in his mind, the thing was
  by no means sharp and clear. I fancy that all through this period he kept
  telling himself that when the occasion came he would find himself equal to
  it. He was like a man just gripped by a great illness, who says he feels a
  little out of sorts, and expects to be better presently. Meanwhile he delayed
  the completion of the machine, and let the assumption that he was going to
  fly it take root and flourish exceedingly about him. He even accepted
  anticipatory compliments on his courage. And, barring this secret
  squeamishness, there can be no doubt he found all the praise and distinction
  and fuss he got a delightful and even intoxicating draught.</p>

  <p>The Lady Mary Elkinghorn made things a little more complicated for
  him.</p>

  <p>How <i>that</i> began was a subject of inexhaustible speculation to Hicks.
  Probably in the beginning she was just a little "nice" to him with that
  impartial partiality of hers, and it may be that to her eyes, standing out
  conspicuously as he did ruling his monster in the upper air, he had a
  distinction that Hicks was not disposed to find. And somehow they must have
  had a moment of sufficient isolation, and the great Discoverer a moment of
  sufficient courage for something just a little personal to be mumbled or
  blurted. However it began, there is no doubt that it did begin, and presently
  became quite perceptible to a world accustomed to find in the proceedings of
  the Lady Mary Elkinghorn a matter of entertainment. It complicated things,
  because the state of love in such a virgin mind as Filmer's would brace his
  resolution, if not sufficiently, at any rate considerably towards facing a
  danger he feared, and hampered him in such attempts at evasion as would
  otherwise be natural and congenial.</p>

  <p>It remains a matter for speculation just how the Lady Mary felt for Filmer
  and just what she thought of him. At thirty-eight one may have gathered much
  wisdom and still be not altogether wise, and the imagination still functions
  actively enough in creating glamours and effecting the impossible. He came
  before her eyes as a very central man, and that always counts, and he had
  powers, unique powers as it seemed, at any rate in the air. The performance
  with the model had just a touch of the quality of a potent incantation, and
  women have ever displayed an unreasonable disposition to imagine that when a
  man has powers he must necessarily have Power. Given so much, and what was
  not good in Filmer's manner and appearance became an added merit. He was
  modest, he hated display, but given an occasion where TRUE qualities are
  needed, then&mdash;then one would see!</p>

  <p>The late Mrs. Bampton thought it wise to convey to Lady Mary her opinion
  that Filmer, all things considered, was rather a "grub." "He's certainly not
  a sort of man I have ever met before," said the Lady Mary, with a quite
  unruffled serenity. And Mrs. Bampton, after a swift, imperceptible glance at
  that serenity, decided that so far as saying anything to Lady Mary went, she
  had done as much as could be expected of her. But she said a great deal to
  other people.</p>

  <p>And at last, without any undue haste or unseemliness, the day dawned, the
  great day, when Banghurst had promised his public&mdash;the world in fact
  &mdash;that flying should be finally attained and overcome. Filmer saw it
  dawn, watched even in the darkness before it dawned, watched its stars fade
  and the grey and pearly pinks give place at last to the clear blue sky of a
  sunny, cloudless day. He watched it from the window of his bedroom in the
  new-built wing of Banghurst's Tudor house. And as the stars were overwhelmed
  and the shapes and substances of things grew into being out of the amorphous
  dark, he must have seen more and more distinctly the festive preparations
  beyond the beech clumps near the green pavilion in the outer park, the three
  stands for the privileged spectators, the raw, new fencing of the enclosure,
  the sheds and workshops, the Venetian masts and fluttering flags that
  Banghurst had considered essential, black and limp in the breezeless dawn,
  and amidst all these things a great shape covered with tarpauling. A strange
  and terrible portent for humanity was that shape, a beginning that must
  surely spread and widen and change and dominate all the affairs of men, but
  to Filmer it is very doubtful whether it appeared in anything but a narrow
  and personal light. Several people heard him pacing in the small
  hours&mdash;for the vast place was packed with guests by a proprietor editor
  who, before all understood compression. And about five o'clock, if not
  before, Filmer left his room and wandered out of the sleeping house into the
  park, alive by that time with sunlight and birds and squirrels and the fallow
  deer. MacAndrew, who was also an early riser, met him near the machine, and
  they went and had a look at it together.</p>

  <p>It is doubtful if Filmer took any breakfast, in spite of the urgency of
  Banghurst. So soon as the guests began to be about in some number he seems to
  have retreated to his room. Thence about ten he went into the shrubbery, very
  probably because he had seen the Lady Mary Elkinghorn there. She was walking
  up and down, engaged in conversation with her old school friend, Mrs. Brewis-
  Craven, and although Filmer had never met the latter lady before, he joined
  them and walked beside them for some time. There were several silences in
  spite of the Lady Mary's brilliance. The situation was a difficult one, and
  Mrs. Brewis-Craven did not master its difficulty. "He struck me," she said
  afterwards with a luminous self-contradiction, "as a very unhappy person who
  had something to say, and wanted before all things to be helped to say it.
  But how was one to help him when one didn't know what it was?"</p>

  <p>At half-past eleven the enclosures for the public in the outer park were
  crammed, there was an intermittent stream of equipages along the belt which
  circles the outer park, and the house party was dotted over the lawn and
  shrubbery and the corner of the inner park, in a series of brilliantly
  attired knots, all making for the flying machine. Filmer walked in a group of
  three with Banghurst, who was supremely and conspicuously happy, and Sir
  Theodore Hickle, the president of the Aeronautical Society. Mrs. Banghurst
  was close behind with the Lady Mary Elkinghorn, Georgina Hickle, and the Dean
  of Stays. Banghurst was large and copious in speech, and such interstices as
  he left were filled in by Hickle with complimentary remarks to Filmer. And
  Filmer walked between them saying not a word except by way of unavoidable
  reply. Behind, Mrs. Banghurst listened to the admirably suitable and shapely
  conversation of the Dean with that fluttered attention to the ampler clergy
  ten years of social ascent and ascendency had not cured in her; and the Lady
  Mary watched, no doubt with an entire confidence in the world's
  disillusionment, the drooping shoulders of the sort of man she had never met
  before.</p>

  <p>There was some cheering as the central party came into view of the
  enclosures, but it was not very unanimous nor invigorating cheering. They
  were within fifty yards of the apparatus when Filmer took a hasty glance over
  his shoulder to measure the distance of the ladies behind them, and decided
  to make the first remark he had initiated since the house had been left. His
  voice was just a little hoarse, and he cut in on Banghurst in mid-sentence on
  Progress.</p>

  <p>"I say, Banghurst," he said, and stopped.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Banghurst.</p>

  <p>"I wish&mdash;" He moistened his lips. "I'm not feeling well."</p>

  <p>Banghurst stopped dead. "Eh?" he shouted.</p>

  <p>"A queer feeling." Filmer made to move on, but Banghurst was immovable. "I
  don't know. I may be better in a minute. If not&mdash;perhaps ...
  MacAndrew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're not feeling <i>well</i>?" said Banghurst, and stared at his white
  face.</p>

  <p>"My dear!" he said, as Mrs. Banghurst came up with them, "Filmer says he
  isn't feeling <i>well</i>."</p>

  <p>"A little queer," exclaimed Filmer, avoiding the Lady Mary's eyes. "It may
  pass off&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a pause.</p>

  <p>It came to Filmer that he was the most isolated person in the world.</p>

  <p>"In any case," said Banghurst, "the ascent must be made. Perhaps if you
  were to sit down somewhere for a moment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's the crowd, I think," said Filmer.</p>

  <p>There was a second pause. Banghurst's eye rested in scrutiny on Filmer,
  and then swept the sample of public in the enclosure.</p>

  <p>"It's unfortunate," said Sir Theodore Hickle; but still&mdash;I suppose
  &mdash;Your assistants&mdash;Of course, if you feel out of condition and
  disinclined&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't think Mr. Filmer would permit <i>that</i> for a moment," said
  Lady Mary.</p>

  <p>"But if Mr. Filmer's nerve is run&mdash;It might even be dangerous for him
  to attempt&mdash;" Hickle coughed.</p>

  <p>"It's just because it's dangerous," began the Lady Mary, and felt she had
  made her point of view and Filmer's plain enough.</p>

  <p>Conflicting motives struggled for Filmer.</p>

  <p>"I feel I ought to go up," he said, regarding the ground. He looked up and
  met the Lady Mary's eyes. "I want to go up," he said, and smiled whitely at
  her. He turned towards Banghurst. "If I could just sit down somewhere for a
  moment out of the crowd and sun&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Banghurst, at least, was beginning to understand the case. "Come into my
  little room in the green pavilion," he said. "It's quite cool there." He took
  Filmer by the arm.</p>

  <p>Filmer turned his face to the Lady Mary Elkinghorn again. "I shall be all
  right in five minutes," he said. "I'm tremendously sorry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Lady Mary Elkinghorn smiled at him. "I couldn't think&mdash;" he said
  to Hickle, and obeyed the compulsion of Banghurst's pull.</p>

  <p>The rest remained watching the two recede.</p>

  <p>"He is so fragile," said the Lady Mary.</p>

  <p>"He's certainly a highly nervous type," said the Dean, whose weakness it
  was to regard the whole world, except married clergymen with enormous
  families, as "neurotic."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Hickle, "it isn't absolutely necessary for him to go up
  because he has invented&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How <i>could</i> he avoid it?" asked the Lady Mary, with the faintest
  shadow of scorn.</p>

  <p>"It's certainly most unfortunate if he's going to be ill now," said Mrs.
  Banghurst a little severely.</p>

  <p>"He's not going to be ill," said the Lady Mary, and certainly she had met
  Filmer's eye.</p>

  <p>"<i>You'll</i> be all right," said Banghurst, as they went towards the
  pavilion. "All you want is a nip of brandy. It ought to be you, you know.
  You'll be &mdash;you'd get it rough, you know, if you let another
  man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I want to go," said Filmer. "I shall be all right. As a matter of
  fact I'm almost inclined <i>now</i>&mdash;. No! I think I'll have that nip of
  brandy first."</p>

  <p>Banghurst took him into the little room and routed out an empty decanter.
  He departed in search of a supply. He was gone perhaps five minutes.</p>

  <p>The history of those five minutes cannot be written. At intervals Filmer's
  face could be seen by the people on the easternmost of the stands erected for
  spectators, against the window pane peering out, and then it would recede and
  fade. Banghurst vanished shouting behind the grand stand, and presently the
  butler appeared going pavilionward with a tray.</p>

  <p>The apartment in which Filmer came to his last solution was a pleasant
  little room very simply furnished with green furniture and an old bureau
  &mdash;for Banghurst was simple in all his private ways. It was hung with
  little engravings after Morland and it had a shelf of books. But as it
  happened, Banghurst had left a rook rifle he sometimes played with on the top
  of the desk, and on the corner of the mantelshelf was a tin with three or
  four cartridges remaining in it. As Filmer went up and down that room
  wrestling with his intolerable dilemma he went first towards the neat little
  rifle athwart the blotting-pad and then towards the neat little red label</p>

  <p class="sign">".22 LONG."</p>

  <p>The thing must have jumped into his mind in a moment.</p>

  <p>Nobody seems to have connected the report with him, though the gun, being
  fired in a confined space, must have sounded loud, and there were several
  people in the billiard-room, separated from him only by a lath-and-plaster
  partition. But directly Banghurst's butler opened the door and smelt the sour
  smell of the smoke, he knew, he says, what had happened. For the servants at
  least of Banghurst's household had guessed something of what was going on in
  Filmer's mind.</p>

  <p>All through that trying afternoon Banghurst behaved as he held a man
  should behave in the presence of hopeless disaster, and his guests for the
  most part succeeded in not insisting upon the fact&mdash;though to conceal
  their perception of it altogether was impossible&mdash;that Banghurst had
  been pretty elaborately and completely swindled by the deceased. The public
  in the enclosure, Hicks told me, dispersed "like a party that has been
  ducking a welsher," and there wasn't a soul in the train to London, it seems,
  who hadn't known all along that flying was a quite impossible thing for man.
  "But he might have tried it," said many, "after carrying the thing so
  far."</p>

  <p>In the evening, when he was comparatively alone, Banghurst broke down and
  went on like a man of clay. I have been told he wept, which must have made an
  imposing scene, and he certainly said Filmer had ruined his life, and offered
  and sold the whole apparatus to MacAndrew for half-a-crown. "I've been
  thinking&mdash;" said MacAndrew at the conclusion of the bargain, and
  stopped.</p>

  <p>The next morning the name of Filmer was, for the first time, less
  conspicuous in the <i>New Paper</i> than in any other daily paper in the
  world. The rest of the world's instructors, with varying emphasis, according
  to their dignity and the degree of competition between themselves and the
  <i>New Paper</i>, proclaimed the "Entire Failure of the New Flying Machine,"
  and "Suicide of the Impostor." But in the district of North Surrey the
  reception of the news was tempered by a perception of unusual aerial
  phenomena.</p>

  <p>Overnight Wilkinson and MacAndrew had fallen into violent argument on the
  exact motives of their principal's rash act.</p>

  <p>"The man was certainly a poor, cowardly body, but so far as his science
  went he was <i>no</i> impostor," said MacAndrew, "and I'm prepared to give
  that proposition a very practical demonstration, Mr. Wilkinson, so soon as
  we've got the place a little more to ourselves. For I've no faith in all this
  publicity for experimental trials."</p>

  <p>And to that end, while all the world was reading of the certain failure of
  the new flying machine, MacAndrew was soaring and curvetting with great
  amplitude and dignity over the Epsom and Wimbledon divisions; and Banghurst,
  restored once more to hope and energy, and regardless of public security and
  the Board of Trade, was pursuing his gyrations and trying to attract his
  attention, on a motor car and in his pyjamas&mdash;he had caught sight of the
  ascent when pulling up the blind of his bedroom window&mdash;equipped, among
  other things, with a film camera that was subsequently discovered to be
  jammed. And Filmer was lying on the billiard table in the green pavilion with
  a sheet about his body.</p>

     name="story58">THE NEW ACCELERATOR</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, December 1901</h3>

  <p>Certainly, if ever a man found a guinea when he was looking for a pin it
  is my good friend Professor Gibberne. I have heard before of investigators
  overshooting the mark, but never quite to the extent that he has done. He has
  really, this time at any rate, without any touch of exaggeration in the
  phrase, found something to revolutionise human life. And that when he was
  simply seeking an all-round nervous stimulant to bring languid people up to
  the stresses of these pushful days. I have tasted the stuff now several
  times, and I cannot do better than describe the effect the thing had on me.
  That there are astonishing experiences in store for all in search of new
  sensations will become apparent enough.</p>

  <p>Professor Gibberne, as many people know, is my neighbour in Folkestone.
  Unless my memory plays me a trick, his portrait at various ages has already
  appeared in The Strand Magazine&mdash;I think late in 1899; but I am unable
  to look it up because I have lent that volume to some one who has never sent
  it back. The reader may, perhaps, recall the high forehead and the singularly
  long black eyebrows that give such a Mephistophelian touch to his face. He
  occupies one of those pleasant little detached houses in the mixed style that
  make the western end of the Upper Sandgate Road so interesting. His is the
  one with the Flemish gables and the Moorish portico, and it is in the little
  room with the mullioned bay window that he works when he is down here, and in
  which of an evening we have so often smoked and talked together. He is a
  mighty jester, but, besides, he likes to talk to me about his work; he is one
  of those men who find a help and stimulus in talking, and so I have been able
  to follow the conception of the New Accelerator right up from a very early
  stage. Of course, the greater portion of his experimental work is not done in
  Folkestone, but in Gower Street, in the fine new laboratory next to the
  hospital that he has been the first to use.</p>

  <p>As every one knows, or at least as all intelligent people know, the
  special department in which Gibberne has gained so great and deserved a
  reputation among physiologists is the action of drugs upon the nervous
  system. Upon soporifics, sedatives, and anaesthetics he is, I am told,
  unequalled. He is also a chemist of considerable eminence, and I suppose in
  the subtle and complex jungle of riddles that centres about the ganglion cell
  and the axis fibre there are little cleared places of his making, little
  glades of illumination, that, until he sees fit to publish his results, are
  still inaccessible to every other living man. And in the last few years he
  has been particularly assiduous upon this question of nervous stimulants, and
  already, before the discovery of the New Accelerator, very successful with
  them. Medical science has to thank him for at least three distinct and
  absolutely safe invigorators of unrivalled value to practising men. In cases
  of exhaustion the preparation known as Gibberne's B Syrup has, I suppose,
  saved more lives already than any lifeboat round the coast.</p>

  <p>"But none of these little things begin to satisfy me yet," he told me
  nearly a year ago. "Either they increase the central energy without affecting
  the nerves or they simply increase the available energy by lowering the
  nervous conductivity; and all of them are unequal and local in their
  operation. One wakes up the heart and viscera and leaves the brain stupefied,
  one gets at the brain champagne fashion and does nothing good for the solar
  plexus, and what I want&mdash;and what, if it's an earthly possibility, I
  mean to have&mdash;is a stimulant that stimulates all round, that wakes you
  up for a time from the crown of your head to the tip of your great toe, and
  makes you go two&mdash;or even three&mdash;to everybody else's one. Eh?
  That's the thing I'm after."</p>

  <p>"It would tire a man," I said.</p>

  <p>"Not a doubt of it. And you'd eat double or treble&mdash;and all that. But
  just think what the thing would mean. Imagine yourself with a little phial
  like this"&mdash;he held up a little bottle of green glass and marked his
  points with it&mdash;"and in this precious phial is the power to think twice
  as fast, move twice as quickly, do twice as much work in a given time as you
  could otherwise do."</p>

  <p>"But is such a thing possible?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so. If it isn't, I've wasted my time for a year. These various
  preparations of the hypophosphites, for example, seem to show that something
  of the sort...Even if it was only one and a half times as fast it would
  do."</p>

  <p>"It <i>would</i> do," I said.</p>

  <p>"If you were a statesman in a corner, for example, time rushing up against
  you, something urgent to be done, eh?"</p>

  <p>"He could dose his private secretary," I said.</p>

  <p>"And gain&mdash;double time. And think if <i>you</i>, for example, wanted
  to finish a book."</p>

  <p>"Usually," I said, "I wish I'd never begun 'em."</p>

  <p>"Or a doctor, driven to death, wants to sit down and think out a case. Or
  a barrister&mdash;or a man cramming for an examination."</p>

  <p>"Worth a guinea a drop," said I, "and more to men like that."</p>

  <p>"And in a duel, again," said Gibberne, "where it all depends on your
  quickness in pulling the trigger."</p>

  <p>"Or in fencing," I echoed.</p>

  <p>"You see," said Gibberne, "if I get it as an all-round thing it will
  really do you no harm at all&mdash;except perhaps to an infinitesimal degree
  it brings you nearer old age. You will just have lived twice to other
  people's once&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I suppose," I meditated, "in a duel&mdash;it would be fair?"</p>

  <p>"That's a question for the seconds," said Gibberne.</p>

  <p>I harked back further. "And you really think such a thing <i>is</i>
  possible?" I said.</p>

  <p>"As possible," said Gibberne, and glanced at something that went throbbing
  by the window, "as a motor-bus. As a matter of fact&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused and smiled at me deeply, and tapped slowly on the edge of his
  desk with the green phial. "I think I know the stuff... Already I've got
  something coming." The nervous smile upon his face betrayed the gravity of
  his revelation. He rarely talked of his actual experimental work unless
  things were very near the end. "And it may be, it may be&mdash;I shouldn't be
  surprised&mdash;it may even do the thing at a greater rate than twice."</p>

  <p>"It will be rather a big thing," I hazarded.</p>

  <p>"It will be, I think, rather a big thing."</p>

  <p>But I don't think he quite knew what a big thing it was to be, for all
  that.</p>

  <p>I remember we had several talks about the stuff after that. "The New
  Accelerator" he called it, and his tone about it grew more confident on each
  occasion. Sometimes he talked nervously of unexpected physiological results
  its use might have, and then he would get a little unhappy; at others he was
  frankly mercenary, and we debated long and anxiously how the preparation
  might be turned to commercial account. "It's a good thing," said Gibberne, "a
  tremendous thing. I know I'm giving the world something, and I think it only
  reasonable we should expect the world to pay. The dignity of science is all
  very well, but I think somehow I must have the monopoly of the stuff for,
  say, ten years. I don't see why ALL the fun in life should go to the dealers
  in ham."</p>

  <p>My own interest in the coming drug certainly did not wane in the time. I
  have always had a queer little twist towards metaphysics in my mind. I have
  always been given to paradoxes about space and time, and it seemed to me that
  Gibberne was really preparing no less than the absolute acceleration of life.
  Suppose a man repeatedly dosed with such a preparation: he would live an
  active and record life indeed, but he would be an adult at eleven,
  middle-aged at twenty-five, and by thirty well on the road to senile decay.
  It seemed to me that so far Gibberne was only going to do for any one who
  took his drug exactly what Nature has done for the Jews and Orientals, who
  are men in their teens and aged by fifty, and quicker in thought and act than
  we are all the time. The marvel of drugs has always been great to my mind;
  you can madden a man, calm a man, make him incredibly strong and alert or a
  helpless log, quicken this passion and allay that, all by means of drugs, and
  here was a new miracle to be added to this strange armoury of phials the
  doctors use! But Gibberne was far too eager upon his technical points to
  enter very keenly into my aspect of the question.</p>

  <p>It was the 7th or 8th of August when he told me the distillation that
  would decide his failure or success for a time was going forward as we
  talked, and it was on the 10th that he told me the thing was done and the New
  Accelerator a tangible reality in the world. I met him as I was going up the
  Sandgate Hill towards Folkestone&mdash;I think I was going to get my hair
  cut, and he came hurrying down to meet me&mdash;I suppose he was coming to my
  house to tell me at once of his success. I remember that his eyes were
  unusually bright and his face flushed, and I noted even then the swift
  alacrity of his step.</p>

  <p>"It's done," he cried, and gripped my hand, speaking very fast; "it's more
  than done. Come up to my house and see."</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>"Really!" he shouted. "Incredibly! Come up and see."</p>

  <p>"And it does&mdash;twice?</p>

  <p>"It does more, much more. It scares me. Come up and see the stuff. Taste
  it! Try it! It's the most amazing stuff on earth." He gripped my arm and,
  walking at such a pace that he forced me into a trot, went shouting with me
  up the hill. A whole char-a-banc-ful of people turned and stared at us in
  unison after the manner of people in chars-a-banc. It was one of those hot,
  clear days that Folkestone sees so much of, every colour incredibly bright
  and every outline hard. There was a breeze, of course, but not so much breeze
  as sufficed under these conditions to keep me cool and dry. I panted for
  mercy.</p>

  <p>"I'm not walking fast, am I?" cried Gibberne, and slackened his pace to a
  quick march.</p>

  <p>"You've been taking some of this stuff," I puffed.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "At the utmost a drop of water that stood in a beaker from
  which I had washed out the last traces of the stuff. I took some last night,
  you know. But that is ancient history, now."</p>

  <p>"And it goes twice?" I said, nearing his doorway in a grateful
  perspiration.</p>

  <p>"It goes a thousand times, many thousand times!" cried Gibberne, with a
  dramatic gesture, flinging open his Early English carved oak gate.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" said I, and followed him to the door.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how many times it goes," he said, with his latch-key in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"And you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It throws all sorts of light on nervous physiology, it kicks the theory
  of vision into a perfectly new shape!...Heaven knows how many thousand times.
  We'll try all that after&mdash;The thing is to try the stuff now."</p>

  <p>"Try the stuff?" I said, as we went along the passage.</p>

  <p>"Rather," said Gibberne, turning on me in his study. "There it is in that
  little green phial there! Unless you happen to be afraid?"</p>

  <p>I am a careful man by nature, and only theoretically adventurous. I WAS
  afraid. But on the other hand there is pride.</p>

  <p>"Well," I haggled. "You say you've tried it?"</p>

  <p>"I've tried it," he said, "and I don't look hurt by it, do I? I don't even
  look livery and I <i>feel</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I sat down. "Give me the potion," I said. "If the worst comes to the worst
  it will save having my hair cut, and that I think is one of the most hateful
  duties of a civilised man. How do you take the mixture?"</p>

  <p>"With water," said Gibberne, whacking down a carafe.</p>

  <p>He stood up in front of his desk and regarded me in his easy chair; his
  manner was suddenly affected by a touch of the Harley Street specialist.
  "It's rum stuff, you know," he said.</p>

  <p>I made a gesture with my hand.</p>

  <p>"I must warn you in the first place as soon as you've got it down to shut
  your eyes, and open them very cautiously in a minute or so's time. One still
  sees. The sense of vision is a question of length of vibration, and not of
  multitude of impacts; but there's a kind of shock to the retina, a nasty
  giddy confusion just at the time, if the eyes are open. Keep 'em shut."</p>

  <p>"Shut," I said. "Good!"</p>

  <p>"And the next thing is, keep still. Don't begin to whack about. You may
  fetch something a nasty rap if you do. Remember you will be going several
  thousand times faster than you ever did before, heart, lungs, muscles, brain
  &mdash;everything&mdash;and you will hit hard without knowing it. You won't
  know it, you know. You'll feel just as you do now. Only everything in the
  world will seem to be going ever so many thousand times slower than it ever
  went before. That's what makes it so deuced queer."</p>

  <p>"Lor'," I said. "And you mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll see," said he, and took up a little measure. He glanced at the
  material on his desk. "Glasses," he said, "water. All here. Mustn't take too
  much for the first attempt."</p>

  <p>The little phial glucked out its precious contents.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget what I told you," he said, turning the contents of the
  measure into a glass in the manner of an Italian waiter measuring whisky.
  "Sit with the eyes tightly shut and in absolute stillness for two minutes,"
  he said. "Then you will hear me speak."</p>

  <p>He added an inch or so of water to the little dose in each glass.</p>

  <p>"By-the-by," he said, "don't put your glass down. Keep it in your hand and
  rest your hand on your knee. Yes&mdash;so. And now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He raised his glass.</p>

  <p>"The New Accelerator," I said.</p>

  <p>"The New Accelerator," he answered, and we touched glasses and drank, and
  instantly I closed my eyes.</p>

  <p>You know that blank non-existence into which one drops when one has taken
  "gas." For an indefinite interval it was like that. Then I heard Gibberne
  telling me to wake up, and I stirred and opened my eyes. There he stood as he
  had been standing, glass still in hand. It was empty, that was all the
  difference.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Nothing out of the way?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. A slight feeling of exhilaration, perhaps. Nothing more."</p>

  <p>"Sounds?"</p>

  <p>"Things are still," I said. "By Jove! yes! They ARE still. Except the sort
  of faint pat, patter, like rain falling on different things. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Analysed sounds," I think he said, but I am not sure. He glanced at the
  window. "Have you ever seen a curtain before a window fixed in that way
  before?"</p>

  <p>I followed his eyes, and there was the end of the curtain, frozen, as it
  were, corner high, in the act of flapping briskly in the breeze.</p>

  <p>"No," said I; "that's odd."</p>

  <p>"And here," he said, and opened the hand that held the glass. Naturally I
  winced, expecting the glass to smash. But so far from smashing it did not
  even seem to stir; it hung in mid-air&mdash;motionless.</p>

  <p>"Roughly speaking," said Gibberne, "an object in these latitudes falls 16
  feet in the first second. This glass is falling 16 feet in a second now.
  Only, you see, it hasn't been falling yet for the hundredth part of a second.
  That gives you some idea of the pace of my Accelerator." And he waved his
  hand round and round, over and under the slowly sinking glass. Finally, he
  took it by the bottom, pulled it down, and placed it very carefully on the
  table. "Eh?" he said to me, and laughed.</p>

  <p>"That seems all right," I said, and began very gingerly to raise myself
  from my chair. I felt perfectly well, very light and comfortable, and quite
  confident in my mind. I was going fast all over. My heart, for example, was
  beating a thousand times a second, but that caused me no discomfort at all. I
  looked out of the window. An immovable cyclist, head down and with a frozen
  puff of dust behind his driving-wheel, scorched to overtake a galloping
  char-a-banc that did not stir. I gaped in amazement at this incredible
  spectacle. "Gibberne," I cried, "how long will this confounded stuff
  last?"</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows!" he answered. "Last time I took it I went to bed and slept
  it off. I tell you, I was frightened. It must have lasted some minutes, I
  think&mdash;it seemed like hours. But after a bit it slows down rather
  suddenly, I believe."</p>

  <p>I was proud to observe that I did not feel frightened&mdash;I suppose
  because there were two of us. "Why shouldn't we go out?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"They'll see us."</p>

  <p>"Not they. Goodness, no! Why, we shall be going a thousand times faster
  than the quickest conjuring trick that was ever done. Come along! Which way
  shall we go? Window, or door?"</p>

  <p>And out by the window we went.</p>

  <p>Assuredly of all the strange experiences that I have ever had, or
  imagined, or read of other people having or imagining, that little raid I
  made with Gibberne on the Folkestone Leas, under the influence of the New
  Accelerator, was the strangest and maddest of all. We went out by his gate
  into the road, and there we made a minute examination of the statuesque
  passing traffic. The tops of the wheels and some of the legs of the horses of
  this char-a-banc, the end of the whip-lash and the lower jaw of the
  conductor&mdash;who was just beginning to yawn&mdash;were perceptibly in
  motion, but all the rest of the lumbering conveyance seemed still. And quite
  noiseless except for a faint rattling that came from one man's throat! And as
  parts of this frozen edifice there were a driver, you know, and a conductor,
  and eleven people! The effect as we walked about the thing began by being
  madly queer, and ended by being disagreeable. There they were, people like
  ourselves and yet not like ourselves, frozen in careless attitudes, caught in
  mid-gesture. A girl and a man smiled at one another, a leering smile that
  threatened to last for evermore; a woman in a floppy capelline rested her arm
  on the rail and stared at Gibberne's house with the unwinking stare of
  eternity; a man stroked his moustache like a figure of wax, and another
  stretched a tiresome stiff hand with extended fingers towards his loosened
  hat. We stared at them, we laughed at them, we made faces at them, and then a
  sort of disgust of them came upon us, and we turned away and walked round in
  front of the cyclist towards the Leas.</p>

  <p>"Goodness!" cried Gibberne, suddenly; "look there!"</p>

  <p>He pointed, and there at the tip of his finger and sliding down the air
  with wings flapping slowly and at the speed of an exceptionally languid snail
  &mdash;was a bee.</p>

  <p>And so we came out upon the Leas. There the thing seemed madder than ever.
  The band was playing in the upper stand, though all the sound it made for us
  was a low-pitched, wheezy rattle, a sort of prolonged last sigh that passed
  at times into a sound like the slow, muffled ticking of some monstrous clock.
  Frozen people stood erect, strange, silent, self-conscious-looking dummies
  hung unstably in mid-stride, promenading upon the grass. I passed close to a
  little poodle dog suspended in the act of leaping, and watched the slow
  movement of his legs as he sank to earth. "Lord, look here!" cried Gibberne,
  and we halted for a moment before a magnificent person in white faint-striped
  flannels, white shoes, and a Panama hat, who turned back to wink at two gaily
  dressed ladies he had passed. A wink, studied with such leisurely
  deliberation as we could afford, is an unattractive thing. It loses any
  quality of alert gaiety, and one remarks that the winking eye does not
  completely close, that under its drooping lid appears the lower edge of an
  eyeball and a little line of white. "Heaven give me memory," said I, "and I
  will never wink again."</p>

  <p>"Or smile," said Gibberne, with his eye on the lady's answering teeth.</p>

  <p>"It's infernally hot, somehow," said I. "Let's go slower."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come along!" said Gibberne.</p>

  <p>We picked our way among the bath-chairs in the path. Many of the people
  sitting in the chairs seemed almost natural in their passive poses, but the
  contorted scarlet of the bandsmen was not a restful thing to see. A purple-
  faced little gentleman was frozen in the midst of a violent struggle to
  refold his newspaper against the wind; there were many evidences that all
  these people in their sluggish way were exposed to a considerable breeze, a
  breeze that had no existence so far as our sensations went. We came out and
  walked a little way from the crowd, and turned and regarded it. To see all
  that multitude changed, to a picture, smitten rigid, as it were, into the
  semblance of realistic wax, was impossibly wonderful. It was absurd, of
  course; but it filled me with an irrational, an exultant sense of superior
  advantage. Consider the wonder of it! All that I had said, and thought, and
  done since the stuff had begun to work in my veins had happened, so far as
  those people, so far as the world in general went, in the twinkling of an
  eye. "The New Accelerator&mdash;" I began, but Gibberne interrupted me.</p>

  <p>"There's that infernal old woman!" he said.</p>

  <p>"What old woman?"</p>

  <p>"Lives next door to me," said Gibberne. "Has a lapdog that yaps. Gods! The
  temptation is strong!"</p>

  <p>There is something very boyish and impulsive about Gibberne at times.
  Before I could expostulate with him he had dashed forward, snatched the
  unfortunate animal out of visible existence, and was running violently with
  it towards the cliff of the Leas. It was most extraordinary. The little
  brute, you know, didn't bark or wriggle or make the slightest sign of
  vitality. It kept quite stiffly in an attitude of somnolent repose, and
  Gibberne held it by the neck. It was like running about with a dog of wood.
  "Gibberne," I cried, "put it down!" Then I said something else. "If you run
  like that, Gibberne," I cried, "you'll set your clothes on fire. Your linen
  trousers are going brown as it is!"</p>

  <p>He clapped his hand on his thigh and stood hesitating on the verge.
  "Gibberne," I cried, coming up, "put it down. This heat is too much! It's our
  running so! Two or three miles a second! Friction of the air!"</p>

  <p>"What?" he said, glancing at the dog.</p>

  <p>"Friction of the air," I shouted. "Friction of the air. Going too fast.
  Like meteorites and things. Too hot. And, Gibberne! Gibberne! I'm all over
  pricking and a sort of perspiration. You can see people stirring slightly. I
  believe the stuff's working off! Put that dog down."</p>

  <p>"Eh?" he said.</p>

  <p>"It's working off," I repeated. "We're too hot and the stuff's working
  off! I'm wet through."</p>

  <p>He stared at me. Then at the band, the wheezy rattle of whose performance
  was certainly going faster. Then with a tremendous sweep of the arm he hurled
  the dog away from him and it went spinning upward, still inanimate, and hung
  at last over the grouped parasols of a knot of chattering people. Gibberne
  was gripping my elbow. "By Jove!" he cried. "I believe&mdash;it is! A sort of
  hot pricking and&mdash;yes. That man's moving his pocket-handkerchief!
  Perceptibly. We must get out of this sharp."</p>

  <p>But we could not get out of it sharply enough. Luckily, perhaps! For we
  might have run, and if we had run we should, I believe, have burst into
  flames. Almost certainly we should have burst into flames! You know we had
  neither of us thought of that... But before we could even begin to run the
  action of the drug had ceased. It was the business of a minute fraction of a
  second. The effect of the New Accelerator passed like the drawing of a
  curtain, vanished in the movement of a hand. I heard Gibberne's voice in
  infinite alarm. "Sit down," he said, and flop, down upon the turf at the edge
  of the Leas I sat&mdash;scorching as I sat. There is a patch of burnt grass
  there still where I sat down. The whole stagnation seemed to wake up as I did
  so, the disarticulated vibration of the band rushed together into a blast of
  music, the promenaders put their feet down and walked their ways, the papers
  and flags began flapping, smiles passed into words, the winker finished his
  wink and went on his way complacently, and all the seated people moved and
  spoke.</p>

  <p>The whole world had come alive again, was going as fast as we were, or
  rather we were going no faster than the rest of the world. It was like
  slowing down as one comes into a railway station. Everything seemed to spin
  round for a second or two, I had the most transient feeling of nausea, and
  that was all. And the little dog which had seemed to hang for a moment when
  the force of Gibberne's arm was expended fell with a swift acceleration clean
  through a lady's parasol!</p>

  <p>That was the saving of us. Unless it was for one corpulent old gentleman
  in a bath-chair, who certainly did start at the sight of us and afterwards
  regarded us at intervals with a darkly suspicious eye, and, finally, I
  believe, said something to his nurse about us, I doubt if a solitary person
  remarked our sudden appearance among them. Plop! We must have appeared
  abruptly. We ceased to smoulder almost at once, though the turf beneath me
  was uncomfortably hot. The attention of every one&mdash;including even the
  Amusements' Association band, which on this occasion, for the only time in
  its history, got out of tune&mdash;was arrested by the amazing fact, and the
  still more amazing yapping and uproar caused by the fact that a respectable,
  over-fed lap-dog sleeping quietly to the east of the bandstand should
  suddenly fall through the parasol of a lady on the west&mdash;in a slightly
  singed condition due to the extreme velocity of its movements through the
  air. In these absurd days, too, when we are all trying to be as psychic, and
  silly, and superstitious as possible! People got up and trod on other people,
  chairs were overturned, the Leas policeman ran. How the matter settled itself
  I do not know&mdash;we were much too anxious to disentangle ourselves from
  the affair and get out of range of the eye of the old gentleman in the
  bath-chair to make minute inquiries. As soon as we were sufficiently cool and
  sufficiently recovered from our giddiness and nausea and confusion of mind to
  do so we stood up and, skirting the crowd, directed our steps back along the
  road below the Metropole towards Gibberne's house. But amidst the din I heard
  very distinctly the gentleman who had been sitting beside the lady of the
  ruptured sunshade using quite unjustifiable threats and language to one of
  those chair-attendants who have "Inspector" written on their caps. "If you
  didn't throw the dog," he said, "who <i>did</i>?"</p>

  <p>The sudden return of movement and familiar noises, and our natural anxiety
  about ourselves (our clothe's were still dreadfully hot, and the fronts of
  the thighs of Gibberne's white trousers were scorched a drabbish brown),
  prevented the minute observations I should have liked to make on all these
  things. Indeed, I really made no observations of any scientific value on that
  return. The bee, of course, had gone. I looked for that cyclist, but he was
  already out of sight as we came into the Upper Sandgate Road or hidden from
  us by traffic; the char-a-banc, however, with its people now all alive and
  stirring, was clattering along at a spanking pace almost abreast of the
  nearer church.</p>

  <p>We noted, however, that the window-sill on which we had stepped in getting
  out of the house was slightly singed, and that the impressions of our feet on
  the gravel of the path were unusually deep.</p>

  <p>So it was I had my first experience of the New Accelerator. Practically we
  had been running about and saying and doing all sorts of things in the space
  of a second or so of time. We had lived half an hour while the band had
  played, perhaps, two bars. But the effect it had upon us was that the whole
  world had stopped for our convenient inspection. Considering all things, and
  particularly considering our rashness in venturing out of the house, the
  experience might certainly have been much more disagreeable than it was. It
  showed, no doubt, that Gibberne has still much to learn before his
  preparation is a manageable convenience, but its practicability it certainly
  demonstrated beyond all cavil.</p>

  <p>Since that adventure he has been steadily bringing its use under control,
  and I have several times, and without the slightest bad result, taken
  measured doses under his direction; though I must confess I have not yet
  ventured abroad again while under its influence. I may mention, for example,
  that this story has been written at one sitting and without interruption,
  except for the nibbling of some chocolate, by its means. I began at 6.25, and
  my watch is now very nearly at the minute past the half-hour. The convenience
  of securing a long, uninterrupted spell of work in the midst of a day full of
  engagements cannot be exaggerated. Gibberne is now working at the
  quantitative handling of his preparation, with especial reference to its
  distinctive effects upon different types of constitution. He then hopes to
  find a Retarder with which to dilute its present rather excessive potency.
  The Retarder will, of course, have the reverse effect to the Accelerator;
  used alone it should enable the patient to spread a few seconds over many
  hours of ordinary time,&mdash;and so to maintain an apathetic inaction, a
  glacier-like absence of alacrity, amidst the most animated or irritating
  surroundings. The two things together must necessarily work an entire
  revolution in civilised existence. It is the beginning of our escape from
  that Time Garment of which Carlyle speaks. While this Accelerator will enable
  us to concentrate ourselves with tremendous impact upon any moment or
  occasion that demands our utmost sense and vigour, the Retarder will enable
  us to pass in passive tranquillity through infinite hardship and tedium.
  Perhaps I am a little optimistic about the Retarder, which has indeed still
  to be discovered, but about the Accelerator there is no possible sort of
  doubt whatever. Its appearance upon the market in a convenient, controllable,
  and assimilable form is a matter of the next few months. It will be
  obtainable of all chemists and druggists, in small green bottles, at a high
  but, considering its extraordinary qualities, by no means excessive price.
  Gibberne's Nervous Accelerator it will be called, and he hopes to be able to
  supply it in three strengths: one in 200, one in 900, and one in 2000,
  distinguished by yellow, pink, and white labels respectively.</p>

  <p>No doubt its use renders a great number of very extraordinary things
  possible; for, of course, the most remarkable and, possibly, even criminal
  proceedings may be effected with impunity by thus dodging, as it were, into
  the interstices of time. Like all potent preparations it will be liable to
  abuse. We have, however, discussed this aspect of the question very
  thoroughly, and we have decided that this is purely a matter of medical
  jurisprudence and altogether outside our province. We shall manufacture and
  sell the Accelerator, and, as for the consequences&mdash;we shall see.</p>

  <h3>First published as "The Story Of The Inexperienced Ghost" in <i>The
  Strand Magazine</i>, March 1902</h3>

  <p>The scene amidst which Clayton told his last story comes back very vividly
  to my mind. There he sat, for the greater part of the time, in the corner of
  the authentic settle by the spacious open fire, and Sanderson sat beside him
  smoking the Broseley clay that bore his name. There was Evans, and that
  marvel among actors, Wish, who is also a modest man. We had all come down to
  the Mermaid Club that Saturday morning, except Clayton, who had slept there
  overnight&mdash;which indeed gave him the opening of his story. We had golfed
  until golfing was invisible; we had dined, and we were in that mood of
  tranquil kindliness when men will suffer a story. When Clayton began to tell
  one, we naturally supposed he was lying. It may be that indeed he was
  lying&mdash;of that the reader will speedily be able to judge as well as I.
  He began, it is true, with an air of matter-of-fact anecdote, but that we
  thought was only the incurable artifice of the man.</p>

  <p>"I say!" he remarked, after a long consideration of the upward rain of
  sparks from the log that Sanderson had thumped, "you know I was alone here
  last night?"</p>

  <p>"Except for the domestics," said Wish.</p>

  <p>"Who sleep in the other wing," said Clayton. "Yes. Well&mdash;" He pulled
  at his cigar for some little time as though he still hesitated about his
  confidence. Then he said, quite quietly, "I caught a ghost!"</p>

  <p>"Caught a ghost, did you?" said Sanderson. "Where is it?"</p>

  <p>And Evans, who admires Clayton immensely and has been four weeks in
  America, shouted, "<i>caught</i> a ghost, did you, Clayton? I'm glad of it!
  Tell us all about it right now."</p>

  <p>Clayton said he would in a minute, and asked him to shut the door.</p>

  <p>He looked apologetically at me. "There's no eavesdropping of course, but
  we don't want to upset our very excellent service with any rumours of ghosts
  in the place. There's too much shadow and oak panelling to trifle with that.
  And this, you know, wasn't a regular ghost. I don't think it will come again
  &mdash;ever."</p>

  <p>"You mean to say you didn't keep it?" said Sanderson.</p>

  <p>"I hadn't the heart to," said Clayton.</p>

  <p>And Sanderson said he was surprised.</p>

  <p>We laughed, and Clayton looked aggrieved. "I know," he said, with the
  flicker of a smile, "but the fact is it really <i>was</i> a ghost, and I'm as
  sure of it as I am that I am talking to you now. I'm not joking. I mean what
  I say."</p>

  <p>Sanderson drew deeply at his pipe, with one reddish eye on Clayton, and
  then emitted a thin jet of smoke more eloquent than many words.</p>

  <p>Clayton ignored the comment. "It is the strangest thing that has ever
  happened in my life. You know, I never believed in ghosts or anything of the
  sort, before, ever; and then, you know, I bag one in a corner; and the whole
  business is in my hands."</p>

  <p>He meditated still more profoundly, and produced and began to pierce a
  second cigar with a curious little stabber he affected.</p>

  <p>"You talked to it?" asked Wish.</p>

  <p>"For the space, probably, of an hour."</p>

  <p>"Chatty?" I said, joining the party of the sceptics.</p>

  <p>"The poor devil was in trouble," said Clayton, bowed over his cigar-end
  and with the very faintest note of reproof.</p>

  <p>"Sobbing?" some one asked.</p>

  <p>Clayton heaved a realistic sigh at the memory. "Good Lord!" he said;
  "yes." And then, "Poor fellow! yes."</p>

  <p>"Where did you strike it?" asked Evans, in his best American accent.</p>

  <p>"I never realised," said Clayton, ignoring him, "the poor sort of thing a
  ghost might be," and he hung us up again for a time, while he sought for
  matches in his pocket and lit and warmed to his cigar.</p>

  <p>"I took an advantage," he reflected at last.</p>

  <p>We were none of us in a hurry. "A character," he said, "remains just the
  same character for all that it's been disembodied. That's a thing we too
  often forget. People with a certain strength or fixity of purpose may have
  ghosts of a certain strength and fixity of purpose&mdash;most haunting
  ghosts, you know, must be as one-idea'd as monomaniacs and as obstinate as
  mules to come back again and again. This poor creature wasn't." He suddenly
  looked up rather queerly, and his eye went round the room. "I say it," he
  said, "in all kindliness, but that is the plain truth of the case. Even at
  the first glance he struck me as weak."</p>

  <p>He punctuated with the help of his cigar.</p>

  <p>"I came upon him, you know, in the long passage. His back was towards me
  and I saw him first. Right off I knew him for a ghost. He was transparent and
  whitish; clean through his chest I could see the glimmer of the little window
  at the end. And not only his physique but his attitude struck me as being
  weak. He looked, you know, as though he didn't know in the slightest whatever
  he meant to do. One hand was on the panelling and the other fluttered to his
  mouth. Like&mdash;<i>so</i>!"</p>

  <p>"What sort of physique?" said Sanderson.</p>

  <p>"Lean. You know that sort of young man's neck that has two great flutings
  down the back, here and here&mdash;so! And a little, meanish head with
  scrubby hair&mdash;And rather bad ears. Shoulders bad, narrower than the
  hips; turn-down collar, ready-made short jacket, trousers baggy and a little
  frayed at the heels. That's how he took me. I came very quietly up the
  staircase. I did not carry a light, you know&mdash;the candles are on the
  landing table and there is that lamp&mdash;and I was in my list slippers, and
  I saw him as I came up. I stopped dead at that&mdash;taking him in. I wasn't
  a bit afraid. I think that in most of these affairs one is never nearly so
  afraid or excited as one imagines one would be. I was surprised and
  interested. I thought, 'Good Lord! Here's a ghost at last! And I haven't
  believed for a moment in ghosts during the last five-and-twenty years.'"</p>

  <p>"Um," said Wish.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I wasn't on the landing a moment before he found out I was
  there. He turned on me sharply, and I saw the face of an immature young man,
  a weak nose, a scrubby little moustache, a feeble chin. So for an instant we
  stood&mdash;he looking over his shoulder at me and regarded one another. Then
  he seemed to remember his high calling. He turned round, drew himself up,
  projected his face, raised his arms, spread his hands in approved ghost
  fashion &mdash;came towards me. As he did so his little jaw dropped, and he
  emitted a faint, drawn-out 'Boo.' No, it wasn't&mdash;not a bit dreadful. I'd
  dined. I'd had a bottle of champagne, and being all alone, perhaps two or
  three &mdash;perhaps even four or five&mdash;whiskies, so I was as solid as
  rocks and no more frightened than if I'd been assailed by a frog. 'Boo!' I
  said. 'Nonsense. You don't belong to <i>this</i> place. What are you doing
  here?'</p>

  <p>"I could see him wince. 'Boo-oo,' he said.</p>

  <p>"'Boo&mdash;be hanged! Are you a member?' I said; and just to show I
  didn't care a pin for him I stepped through a corner of him and made to light
  my candle. 'Are you a member?' I repeated, looking at him sideways.</p>

  <p>"He moved a little so as to stand clear of me, and his bearing became
  crestfallen. 'No,' he said, in answer to the persistent interrogation of my
  eye; 'I'm not a member&mdash;I'm a ghost.'</p>

  <p>"'Well, that doesn't give you the run of the Mermaid Club. Is there any
  one you want to see, or anything of that sort?' and doing it as steadily as
  possible for fear that he should mistake the carelessness of whisky for the
  distraction of fear, I got my candle alight. I turned on him, holding it.
  'What are you doing here?' I said.</p>

  <p>"He had dropped his hands and stopped his booing, and there he stood,
  abashed and awkward, the ghost of a weak, silly, aimless young man. 'I'm
  haunting,' he said.</p>

  <p>"'You haven't any business to,' I said in a quiet voice.</p>

  <p>"'I'm a ghost,' he said, as if in defence.</p>

  <p>"'That may be, but you haven't any business to haunt here. This is a
  respectable private club; people often stop here with nursemaids and
  children, and, going about in the careless way you do, some poor little mite
  could easily come upon you and be scared out of her wits. I suppose you
  didn't think of that?'</p>

  <p>"'No, sir,' he said, 'I didn't.'</p>

  <p>"'You should have done. You haven't any claim on the place, have you?
  Weren't murdered here, or anything of that sort?'</p>

  <p>"'None, sir; but I thought as it was old and oak-panelled&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'That's <i>no</i> excuse.' I regarded him firmly. 'Your coming here is a
  mistake,' I said, in a tone of friendly superiority. I feigned to see if I
  had my matches, and then looked up at him frankly. 'If I were you I wouldn't
  wait for cock-crow&mdash;I'd vanish right away.'</p>

  <p>"He looked embarrassed. 'The fact <i>is</i>, sir&mdash;' he began.</p>

  <p>"'I'd vanish,' I said, driving it home.</p>

  <p>"'The fact is, sir, that&mdash;somehow&mdash;I can't.'</p>

  <p>"'You <i>can't</i>?'</p>

  <p>"'No, sir. There's something I've forgotten. I've been hanging about here
  since midnight last night, hiding in the cupboards of the empty bedrooms and
  things like that. I'm flurried. I've never come haunting before, and it seems
  to put me out.'</p>

  <p>"'Put you out?'</p>

  <p>"'Yes, sir. I've tried to do it several times, and it doesn't come off.
  There's some little thing has slipped me, and I can't get back.'</p>

  <p>"That, you know, rather bowled me over. He looked at me in such an abject
  way that for the life of me I couldn't keep up quite the high, hectoring vein
  I had adopted. 'That's queer,' I said, and as I spoke I fancied I heard some
  one moving about down below. 'Come into my room and tell me more about it,' I
  said. 'I didn't, of course, understand this,' and I tried to take him by the
  arm. But, of course, you might as well have tried to take hold of a puff of
  smoke! I had forgotten my number, I think; anyhow, I remember going into
  several bedrooms&mdash;it was lucky I was the only soul in that
  wing&mdash;until I saw my traps. 'Here we are,' I said, and sat down in the
  arm-chair; 'sit down and tell me all about it. It seems to me you have got
  yourself into a jolly awkward position, old chap.'</p>

  <p>"Well, he said he wouldn't sit down! he'd prefer to flit up and down the
  room if it was all the same to me. And so he did, and in a little while we
  were deep in a long and serious talk. And presently, you know, something of
  those whiskies and sodas evaporated out of me, and I began to realise just a
  little what a thundering rum and weird business it was that I was in. There
  he was, semi-transparent&mdash;the proper conventional phantom, and noiseless
  except for his ghost of a voice&mdash;flitting to and fro in that nice,
  clean, chintz-hung old bedroom. You could see the gleam of the copper
  candlesticks through him, and the lights on the brass fender, and the corners
  of the framed engravings on the wall,&mdash;and there he was telling me all
  about this wretched little life of his that had recently ended on earth. He
  hadn't a particularly honest face, you know, but being transparent, of
  course, he couldn't avoid telling the truth."</p>

  <p>"Eh?" said Wish, suddenly sitting up in his chair.</p>

  <p>"What?" said Clayton.</p>

  <p>"Being transparent&mdash;couldn't avoid telling the truth&mdash;I don't
  see it," said Wish.</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> don't see it," said Clayton, with inimitable assurance. "But it
  IS so, I can assure you nevertheless. I don't believe he got once a nail's
  breadth off the Bible truth. He told me how he had been killed&mdash;he went
  down into a London basement with a candle to look for a leakage of
  gas&mdash;and described himself as a senior English master in a London
  private school when that release occurred."</p>

  <p>"Poor wretch!" said I.</p>

  <p>"That's what I thought, and the more he talked the more I thought it.
  There he was, purposeless in life and purposeless out of it. He talked of his
  father and mother and his schoolmaster, and all who had ever been anything to
  him in the world, meanly. He had been too sensitive, too nervous; none of
  them had ever valued him properly or understood him, he said. He had never
  had a real friend in the world, I think; he had never had a success. He had
  shirked games and failed examinations. 'It's like that with some people,' he
  said; 'whenever I got into the examination-room or anywhere everything seemed
  to go.' Engaged to be married of course&mdash;to another over-sensitive
  person, I suppose&mdash;when the indiscretion with the gas escape ended his
  affairs. 'And where are you now?' I asked. 'Not in&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>"He wasn't clear on that point at all. The impression he gave me was of a
  sort of vague, intermediate state, a special reserve for souls too
  non-existent for anything so positive as either sin or virtue. <i>I</i> don't
  know. He was much too egotistical and unobservant to give me any clear idea
  of the kind of place, kind of country, there is on the Other Side of Things.
  Wherever he was, he seems to have fallen in with a set of kindred spirits:
  ghosts of weak Cockney young men, who were on a footing of Christian names,
  and among these there was certainly a lot of talk about 'going haunting' and
  things like that. Yes&mdash;going haunting! They seemed to think 'haunting' a
  tremendous adventure, and most of them funked it all the time. And so primed,
  you know, he had come."</p>

  <p>"But really!" said Wish to the fire.</p>

  <p>"These are the impressions he gave me, anyhow," said Clayton, modestly. "I
  may, of course, have been in a rather uncritical state, but that was the sort
  of background he gave to himself. He kept flitting up and down, with his thin
  voice going talking, talking about his wretched self, and never a word of
  clear, firm statement from first to last. He was thinner and sillier and more
  pointless than if he had been real and alive. Only then, you know, he would
  not have been in my bedroom here&mdash;if he <i>had</i> been alive. I should
  have kicked him out."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Evans, "there <i>are</i> poor mortals like that."</p>

  <p>"And there's just as much chance of their having ghosts as the rest of
  us," I admitted.</p>

  <p>"What gave a sort of point to him, you know, was the fact that he did seem
  within limits to have found himself out. The mess he had made of haunting had
  depressed him terribly. He had been told it would be a 'lark'; he had come
  expecting it to be a 'lark,' and here it was, nothing but another failure
  added to his record! He proclaimed himself an utter out-and-out failure. He
  said, and I can quite believe it, that he had never tried to do anything all
  his life that he hadn't made a perfect mess of&mdash;and through all the
  wastes of eternity he never would. If he had had sympathy, perhaps&mdash;. He
  paused at that, and stood regarding me. He remarked that, strange as it might
  seem to me, nobody, not any one, ever, had given him the amount of sympathy I
  was doing now. I could see what he wanted straight away, and I determined to
  head him off at once. I may be a brute, you know, but being the Only Real
  Friend, the recipient of the confidences of one of these egotistical
  weaklings, ghost or body, is beyond my physical endurance. I got up briskly.
  'Don't you brood on these things too much,' I said. 'The thing you've got to
  do is to get out of this get out of this&mdash;sharp. You pull yourself
  together and <i>try</i>.' 'I can't,' he said. 'You try,' I said, and try he
  did."</p>

  <p>"Try!" said Sanderson. <i>"How?"</i></p>

  <p>"Passes," said Clayton.</p>

  <p>"Passes?"</p>

  <p>"Complicated series of gestures and passes with the hands. That's how he
  had come in and that's how he had to get out again. Lord! what a business I
  had!"</p>

  <p>"But how could <i>any</i> series of passes&mdash;?" I began.</p>

  <p>"My dear man," said Clayton, turning on me and putting a great emphasis on
  certain words, "you want <i>everything</i> clear. <i>I</i> don't know
  <i>how</i>. All I know is that you <i>do</i>&mdash;that <i>he</i> did,
  anyhow, at least. After a fearful time, you know, he got his passes right and
  suddenly disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Did you," said Sanderson, slowly, "observe the passes?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Clayton, and seemed to think. "It was tremendously queer," he
  said. "There we were, I and this thin vague ghost, in that silent room, in
  this silent, empty inn, in this silent little Friday-night town. Not a sound
  except our voices and a faint panting he made when he swung. There was the
  bedroom candle, and one candle on the dressing-table alight, that was
  all&mdash;sometimes one or other would flare up into a tall, lean, astonished
  flame for a space. And queer things happened. 'I can't,' he said; 'I shall
  never&mdash;!' And suddenly he sat down on a little chair at the foot of the
  bed and began to sob and sob. Lord! what a harrowing, whimpering thing he
  seemed!</p>

  <p>"'You pull yourself together,' I said, and tried to pat him on the back,
  and...my confounded hand went through him! By that time, you know, I wasn't
  nearly so&mdash;massive as I had been on the landing. I got the queerness of
  it full. I remember snatching back my hand out of him, as it were, with a
  little thrill, and walking over to the dressing-table. 'You pull yourself
  together,' I said to him, 'and try.' And in order to encourage and help him I
  began to try as well."</p>

  <p>"What!" said Sanderson, "the passes?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the passes."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" I said, moved by an idea that eluded me for a space.</p>

  <p>"This is interesting," said Sanderson, with his finger in his pipe-bowl.
  "You mean to say this ghost of yours gave away&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did his level best to give away the whole confounded barrier?
  <i>Yes</i>."</p>

  <p>"He didn't," said Wish; "he couldn't. Or you'd have gone there too."</p>

  <p>"That's precisely it," I said, finding my elusive idea put into words for
  me.</p>

  <p>"That <i>is</i> precisely it," said Clayton, with thoughtful eyes upon the
  fire.</p>

  <p>For just a little while there was silence.</p>

  <p>"And at last he did it?" said Sanderson.</p>

  <p>"At last he did it. I had to keep him up to it hard, but he did it at
  last&mdash;rather suddenly. He despaired, we had a scene, and then he got up
  abruptly and asked me to go through the whole performance, slowly, so that he
  might see. 'I believe,' he said, 'if I could see I should spot what was wrong
  at once.' And he did. '<i>I</i> know,' he said. 'What do you know?' said I.
  '<i>I</i> know,' he repeated. Then he said, peevishly, 'I <i>can't</i> do it
  if you look at me&mdash;I really <i>can't</i>; it's been that, partly, all
  along. I'm such a nervous fellow that you put me out.' Well, we had a bit of
  an argument. Naturally I wanted to see; but he was as obstinate as a mule,
  and suddenly I had come over as tired as a dog&mdash;he tired me out. 'All
  right,' I said, '<i>I</i> won't look at you,' and turned towards the mirror,
  on the wardrobe, by the bed.</p>

  <p>He started off very fast. I tried to follow him by looking in the looking-
  glass, to see just what it was had hung. Round went his arms and his hands,
  so, and so, and so, and then with a rush came to the last gesture of
  all&mdash;you stand erect and open out your arms&mdash;and so, don't you
  know, he stood. And then he didn't! He didn't! He wasn't! I wheeled round
  from the looking-glass to him. There was nothingl I was alone, with the
  flaring candles and a staggering mind. What had happened? Had anything
  happened? Had I been dreaming?...And then, with an absurd note of finality
  about it, the clock upon the landing discovered the moment was ripe for
  striking <i>one</i>. So!&mdash;Ping! And I was as grave and sober as a judge,
  with all my champagne and whisky gone into the vast serene. Feeling queer,
  you know&mdash;confoundedly <i>queer</i>! Queer! Good Lord!"</p>

  <p>He regarded his cigar-ash for a moment. "That's all that happened," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"And then you went to bed?" asked Evans.</p>

  <p>"What else was there to do?"</p>

  <p>I looked Wish in the eye. We wanted to scoff, and there was something,
  something perhaps in Clayton's voice and manner, that hampered our
  desire.</p>

  <p>"And about these passes?" said Sanderson.</p>

  <p>"I believe I could do them now."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Sanderson, and produced a penknife and set himself to grub the
  dottel out of the bowl of his clay.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you do them now?" said Sanderson, shutting his pen-knife with a
  click.</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm going to do," said Clayton.</p>

  <p>"They won't work," said Evans.</p>

  <p>"If they do&mdash;" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"You know, I'd rather you didn't," said Wish, stretching out his legs.</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Evans.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather he didn't," said Wish.</p>

  <p>"But he hasn't got 'em right," said Sanderson, plugging too much tobacco
  in his pipe.</p>

  <p>"All the same, I'd rather he didn't," said Wish.</p>

  <p>We argued with Wish. He said that for Clayton to go through those gestures
  was like mocking a serious matter. "But you don't believe&mdash;?" I said.
  Wish glanced at Clayton, who was staring into the fire, weighing something in
  his mind. "I do&mdash;more than half, anyhow, I do," said Wish.</p>

  <p>"Clayton," said I, "you're too good a liar for us. Most of it was all
  right. But that disappearance...happened to be convincing. Tell us, it's a
  tale of cock and bull."</p>

  <p>He stood up without heeding me, took the middle of the hearthrug, and
  faced me. For a moment he regarded his feet thoughtfully, and then for all
  the rest of the time his eyes were on the opposite wall, with an intent
  expression. He raised his two hands slowly to the level of his eyes and so
  began...</p>

  <p>Now, Sanderson is a Freemason, a member of the lodge of the Four Kings,
  which devotes itself so ably to the study and elucidation of all the
  mysteries of Masonry past and present, and among the students of this lodge
  Sanderson is by no means the least. He followed Clayton's motions with a
  singular interest in his reddish eye. "That's not bad," he said, when it was
  done. "You really do, you know, put things together, Clayton, in a most
  amazing fashion. But there's one little detail out."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Clayton. "I believe I could tell you which."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"This," said Clayton, and did a queer little twist and writhing and thrust
  of the hands.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"That, you know, was what HE couldn't get right," said Clayton. "But how
  do YOU&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Most of this business, and particularly how you invented it, I don't
  understand at all," said Sanderson, "but just that phase&mdash;I do." He
  reflected. "These happen to be a series of gestures&mdash;connected with a
  certain branch of esoteric Masonry. Probably you know. Or
  else&mdash;<i>how</i>?" He reflected still further. "I do not see I can do
  any harm in telling you just the proper twist. After all, if you know, you
  know; if you don't, you don't."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing," said Clayton, "except what the poor devil let out last
  night."</p>

  <p>"Well, anyhow," said Sanderson, and placed his churchwarden very carefully
  upon the shelf over the fireplace. Then very rapidly he gesticulated with his
  hands.</p>

  <p>"So?" said Clayton, repeating.</p>

  <p>"So," said Sanderson, and took his pipe in hand again.</p>

  <p>"Ah, <i>now</i>," said Clayton, "I can do the whole
  thing&mdash;right."</p>

  <p>He stood up before the waning fire and smiled at us all. But I think there
  was just a little hesitation in his smile. "If I begin&mdash;" he said.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't begin," said Wish.</p>

  <p>"It's all right!" said Evans. "Matter is indestructible. You don't think
  any jiggery-pokery of this sort is going to snatch Clayton into the world of
  shades. Not it! You may try, Clayton, so far as I'm concerned, until your
  arms drop off at the wrists."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe that," said Wish, and stood up and put his arm on
  Clayton's shoulder. "You've made me half believe in that story somehow, and I
  don't want to see the thing done!"</p>

  <p>"Goodness!" said I, "here's Wish frightened!"</p>

  <p>"I am," said Wish, with real or admirably feigned intensity. "I believe
  that if he goes through these motions right he'll GO."</p>

  <p>"He'll not do anything of the sort," I cried. "There's only one way out of
  this world for men, and Clayton is thirty years from that. Besides...And such
  a ghost! Do you think&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>Wish interrupted me by moving. He walked out from among our chairs and
  stopped beside the tole and stood there. "Clayton," he said, "you're a
  fool."</p>

  <p>Clayton, with a humorous light in his eyes, smiled back at him. "Wish," he
  said, "is right and all you others are wrong. I shall go. I shall get to the
  end of these passes, and as the last swish whistles through the air, Presto!
  &mdash;this hearthrug will be vacant, the room will be blank amazement, and a
  respectably dressed gentleman of fifteen stone will plump into the world of
  shades. I'm certain. So will you be. I decline to argue further. Let the
  thing be tried."</p>

  <p><i>"No,"</i> said Wish, and made a step and ceased, and Clayton raised his
  hands once more to repeat the spirit's passing.</p>

  <p>By that time, you know, we were all in a state of tension&mdash;largely
  because of the behaviour of Wish. We sat all of us with our eyes on Clayton
  &mdash;I, at least, with a sort of tight, stiff feeling about me as though
  from the back of my skull to the middle of my thighs my body had been changed
  to steel. And there, with a gravity that was imperturbably serene, Clayton
  bowed and swayed and waved his hands and arms before us. As he drew towards
  the end one piled up, one tingled in one's teeth. The last gesture, I have
  said, was to swing the arms out wide open, with the face held up. And when at
  last he swung out to this closing gesture I ceased even to breathe. It was
  ridiculous, of course, but you know that ghost-story feeling. It was after
  dinner, in a queer, old shadowy house. Would he, after all&mdash;?</p>

  <p>There he stood for one stupendous moment, with his arms open and his
  upturned face, assured and bright, in the glare of the hanging lamp. We hung
  through that moment as if it were an age, and then came from all of us
  something that was half a sigh of infinite relief and half a reassuring
  <i>"No!"</i> For visibly&mdash;he wasn't going. It was all nonsense. He had
  told an idle story, and carried it almost to conviction, that was all!...And
  then in that moment the face of Clayton, changed.</p>

  <p>It changed. It changed as a lit house changes when its lights are suddenly
  extinguished. His eyes were suddenly eyes that were fixed, his smile was
  frozen on his lips, and he stood there still. He stood there, very gently
  swaying.</p>

  <p>That moment, too, was an age. And then, you know, chairs were scraping,
  things were falling, and we were all moving. His knees seemed to give, and he
  fell forward, and Evans rose and caught him in his arms...</p>

  <p>It stunned us all. For a minute I suppose no one said a coherent thing. We
  believed it, yet could not believe it... I came out of a muddled stupefaction
  to find myself kneeling beside him, and his vest and shirt were torn open,
  and Sanderson's hand lay on his heart...</p>

  <p>Well&mdash;the simple fact before us could very well wait our convenience;
  there was no hurry for us to comprehend. It lay there for an hour; it lies
  athwart my memory, black and amazing still, to this day. Clayton had, indeed,
  passed into the world that lies so near to and so far from our own, and he
  had gone thither by the only road that mortal man may take. But whether he
  did indeed pass there by that poor ghost's incantation, or whether he was
  stricken suddenly by apoplexy in the midst of an idle tale&mdash;as the
  coroner's jury would have us believe&mdash;is no matter for my judging; it is
  just one of those inexplicable riddles that must remain unsolved until the
  final solution of all things shall come. All I certainly know is that, in the
  very moment, in the very instant, of concluding those passes, he changed, and
  staggered, and fell down before us&mdash;dead!</p>

     name="story60">MR. SKELMERSDALE IN FAIRYLAND</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Harmsworth London Magazine</i>, February
  1903</h3>

  <p>"There's a man in that shop," said the Doctor, "who has been in
  Fairyland."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" I said, and stared back at the shop. It was the usual village
  shop, post-office, telegraph wire on its brow, zinc pans and brushes outside,
  boots, shirtings, and potted meats in the window. "Tell me about it," I said,
  after a pause.</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> don't know," said the Doctor. "He's an ordinary sort of lout
  &mdash;Skelmersdale is his name. But everybody about here believes it like
  Bible truth."</p>

  <p>I reverted presently to the topic.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about it," said the Doctor, "and I don't WANT to know. I
  attended him for a broken finger&mdash;Married and Single cricket match
  &mdash;and that's when I struck the nonsense. That's all. But it shows you
  the sort of stuff I have to deal with, anyhow, eh? Nice to get modern
  sanitary ideas into a people like this!"</p>

  <p>"Very," I said in a mildly sympathetic tone, and he went on to tell me
  about that business of the Bonham drain. Things of that kind, I observe, are
  apt to weigh on the minds of Medical Officers of Health. I was as sympathetic
  as I knew how, and when he called the Bonham people "asses," I said they were
  "thundering asses," but even that did not allay him.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, later in the summer, an urgent desire to seclude myself, while
  finishing my chapter on Spiritual Pathology&mdash;it was really, I believe,
  stiffer to write than it is to read&mdash;took me to Bignor. I lodged at a
  farmhouse, and presently found myself outside that little general shop again,
  in search of tobacco. "Skelmersdale," said I to myself at the sight of it,
  and went in.</p>

  <p>I was served by a short, but shapely, young man, with a fair downy
  complexion, good, small teeth, blue eyes, and a languid manner. I scrutinised
  him curiously. Except for a touch of melancholy in his expression, he was
  nothing out of the common. He was in the shirt-sleeves and tucked-up apron of
  his trade, and a pencil was thrust behind his inoffensive ear. Athwart his
  black waistcoat was a gold chain, from which dangled a bent guinea.</p>

  <p>"Nothing more to-day, sir?" he inquired. He leant forward over my bill as
  he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Are you Mr. Skelmersdale?" said I.</p>

  <p>"I am, sir," he said, without looking up.</p>

  <p>"Is it true that you have been in Fairyland?"</p>

  <p>He looked up at me for a moment with wrinkled brows, with an aggrieved,
  exasperated face. "O <i>shut</i> it! " he said, and, after a moment of
  hostility, eye to eye, he went on adding up my bill. "Four, six and a half,"
  he said, after a pause. "Thank you, Sir."</p>

  <p>So, unpropitiously, my acquaintance with Mr. Skelmersdale began.</p>

  <p>Well, I got from that to confidence&mdash;through a series of toilsome
  efforts. I picked him up again in the Village Room, where of a night I went
  to play billiards after my supper, and mitigate the extreme seclusion from my
  kind that was so helpful to work during the day. I contrived to play with him
  and afterwards to talk with him. I found the one subject to avoid was
  Fairyland. On everything else he was open and amiable in a commonplace sort
  of way, but on that he had been worried&mdash;it was a manifest taboo. Only
  once in the room did I hear the slightest allusion to his experience in his
  presence, and that was by a cross-grained farm hand who was losing to him.
  Skelmersdale had run a break into double figures, which, by the Bignor
  standards, was uncommonly good play. "Steady on!" said his adversary. "None
  of your fairy flukes!"</p>

  <p>Skelmersdale stared at him for a moment, cue in hand, then flung it down
  and walked out of the room.</p>

  <p>"Why can't you leave 'im alone?" said a respectable elder who had been
  enjoying the game, and in the general murmur of disapproval the grin of
  satisfied wit faded from the ploughboy's face.</p>

  <p>I scented my opportunity. "What's this joke," said I, "about
  Fairyland?"</p>

  <p>"'Tain't no joke about Fairyland, not to young Skelmersdale," said the
  respectable elder, drinking. A little man with rosy cheeks was more
  communicative. "They <i>do</i> say, sir," he said, "that they took him into
  Aldington Knoll an' kep' him there a matter of three weeks."</p>

  <p>And with that the gathering was well under weigh. Once one sheep had
  started, others were ready enough to follow, and in a little time I had at
  least the exterior aspect of the Skelmersdale affair. Formerly, before he
  came to Bignor, he had been in that very similar little shop at Aldington
  Corner, and there whatever it was did happen had taken place. The story was
  clear that he had stayed out late one night on the Knoll and vanished for
  three weeks from the sight of men, and had returned with "his cuffs as clean
  as when he started," and his pockets full of dust and ashes. He returned in a
  state of moody wretchedness that only slowly passed away, and for many days
  he would give no account of where it was he had been. The girl he was engaged
  to at Clapton Hill tried to get it out of him, and threw him over partly
  because he refused, and partly because, as she said, he fairly gave her the
  "'ump." And then when, some time after, he let out to some one carelessly
  that he had been in Fairyland and wanted to go back, and when the thing
  spread and the simple badinage of the countryside came into play, he threw up
  his situation abruptly, and came to Bignor to get out of the fuss. But as to
  what had happened in Fairyland none of these people knew. There the gathering
  in the Village Room went to pieces like a pack at fault. One said this, and
  another said that.</p>

  <p>Their air in dealing with this marvel was ostensibly critical and
  sceptical, but I could see a considerable amount of belief showing through
  their guarded qualifications. I took a line of intelligent interest, tinged
  with a reasonable doubt of the whole story.</p>

  <p>"If Fairyland's inside Aldington Knoll," I said, "why don't you dig it
  out?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I says," said the young ploughboy.</p>

  <p>"There's a-many have tried to dig on Aldington Knoll," said the
  respectable elder, solemnly, "one time and another. But there's none as goes
  about to-day to tell what they got by digging."</p>

  <p>The unanimity of vague belief that surrounded me was rather impressive; I
  felt there must surely be <i>something</i> at the root of so much conviction,
  and the already pretty keen curiosity I felt about the real facts of the case
  was distinctly whetted. If these real facts were to be got from any one, they
  were to be got from Skelmersdale himself; and I set myself, therefore, still
  more assiduously to efface the first bad impression I had made and win his
  confidence to the pitch of voluntary speech. In that endeavour I had a social
  advantage. Being a person of affability and no apparent employment, and
  wearing tweeds and knickerbockers, I was naturally classed as an artist in
  Bignor, and in the remarkable code of social precedence prevalent in Bignor
  an artist ranks considerably higher than a grocer's assistant. Skelmersdale,
  like too many of his class, is something of a snob; he had told me to "shut
  it," only under sudden, excessive provocation, and with, I am certain, a
  subsequent repentance; he was, I knew, quite glad to be seen walking about
  the village with me. In due course, he accepted the proposal of a pipe and
  whisky in my rooms readily enough, and there, scenting by some happy instinct
  that there was trouble of the heart in this, and knowing that confidences
  beget confidences, I plied him with much of interest and suggestion from my
  real and fictitious past. And it was after the third whisky of the third
  visit of that sort, if I remember rightly, that a propos of some artless
  expansion of a little affair that had touched and left me in my teens, that
  he did at last, of his own free will and motion, break the ice. "It was like
  that with me," he said, "over there at Aldington. It's just that that's so
  rum. First I didn't care a bit and it was all her, and afterwards, when it
  was too late, it was, in a manner of speaking, all me."</p>

  <p>I forbore to jump upon this allusion, and so he presently threw out
  another, and in a little while he was making it as plain as daylight that the
  one thing he wanted to talk about now was this Fairyland adventure he had sat
  tight upon for so long. You see, I'd done the trick with him, and from being
  just another half-incredulous, would-be facetious stranger, I had, by all my
  wealth of shameless self-exposure, become the possible confidant. He had been
  bitten by the desire to show that he, too, had lived and felt many things,
  and the fever was upon him.</p>

  <p>He was certainly confoundedly allusive at first, and my eagerness to clear
  him up with a few precise questions was only equalled and controlled by my
  anxiety not to get to this sort of thing too soon. But in another meeting or
  so the basis of confidence was complete; and from first to last I think I got
  most of the items and aspects&mdash;indeed, I got quite a number of times
  over almost everything that Mr. Skelmersdale, with his very limited powers of
  narration, will ever be able to tell. And so I come to the story of his
  adventure, and I piece it all together again. Whether it really happened,
  whether he imagined it or dreamt it, or fell upon it in some strange
  hallucinatory trance, I do not profess to say. But that he invented it I will
  not for one moment entertain. The man simply and honestly believes the thing
  happened as he says it happened; he is transparently incapable of any lie so
  elaborate and sustained, and in the belief of the simple, yet often keenly
  penetrating, rustic minds about him I find a very strong confirmation of his
  sincerity. He believes&mdash;and nobody can produce any positive fact to
  falsify his belief. As for me, with this much of endorsement, I transmit his
  story&mdash;I am a little old now to justify or explain.</p>

  <p>He says he went to sleep on Aldington Knoll about ten o'clock one night
  &mdash;it was quite possibly Midsummer night, though he has never thought of
  the date, and he cannot be sure within a week or so&mdash;and it was a fine
  night and windless, with a rising moon. I have been at the pains to visit
  this Knoll thrice since his story grew up under my persuasions, and once I
  went there in the twilight summer moonrise on what was, perhaps, a similar
  night to that of his adventure. Jupiter was great and splendid above the
  moon, and in the north and northwest the sky was green and vividly bright
  over the sunken sun. The Knoll stands out bare and bleak under the sky, but
  surrounded at a little distance by dark thickets, and as I went up towards it
  there was a mighty starting and scampering of ghostly or quite invisible
  rabbits. Just over the crown of the Knoll, but nowhere else, was a
  multitudinous thin trumpeting of midges. The Knoll is, I believe, an
  artificial mound, the tumulus of some great prehistoric chieftain, and surely
  no man ever chose a more spacious prospect for a sepulchre. Eastward one sees
  along the hills to Hythe, and thence across the Channel to where, thirty
  miles and more perhaps, away, the great white lights by Gris Nez and Boulogne
  wink and pass and shine. Westward lies the whole tumbled valley of the Weald,
  visible as far as Hindhead and Leith Hill, and the valley of the Stour opens
  the Downs in the north to interminable hills beyond Wye. All Romney Marsh
  lies southward at one's feet, Dymchurch and Romney and Lydd, Hastings and its
  hill are in the middle distance, and the hills multiply vaguely far beyond
  where Eastbourne rolls up to Beachy Head.</p>

  <p>And out upon all this it was that Skelmersdale wandered, being troubled in
  his earlier love affair, and as he says, "not caring <i>where</i> he went."
  And there he sat down to think it over, and so, sulking and grieving, was
  overtaken by sleep. And so he fell into the fairies' power.</p>

  <p>The quarrel that had upset him was some trivial matter enough between
  himself and the girl at Clapton Hill to whom he was engaged. She was a
  farmer's daughter, said Skelmersdale, and "very respectable," and no doubt an
  excellent match for him; but both girl and lover were very young and with
  just that mutual jealousy, that intolerantly keen edge of criticism, that
  irrational hunger for a beautiful perfection, that life and wisdom do
  presently and most mercifully dull. What the precise matter of quarrel was I
  have no idea. She may have said she liked men in gaiters when he hadn't any
  gaiters on, or he may have said he liked her better in a different sort of
  hat, but however it began, it got by a series of clumsy stages to bitterness
  and tears. She no doubt got tearful and smeary, and he grew dusty and
  drooping, and she parted with invidious comparisons, grave doubts whether she
  ever had <i>really</i> cared for him, and a clear certainty she would never
  care again. And with this sort of thing upon his mind he came out upon
  Aldington Knoll grieving, and presently, after a long interval, perhaps,
  quite inexplicably, fell asleep.</p>

  <p>He woke to find himself on a softer turf than ever he had slept on before,
  and under the shade of very dark trees that completely hid the sky. Always,
  indeed, in Fairyland the sky is hidden, it seems. Except for one night when
  the fairies were dancing, Mr. Skelmersdale, during all his time with them,
  never saw a star. And of that night I am in doubt whether he was in Fairyland
  proper or out where the rings and rushes are, in those low meadows near the
  railway line at Smeeth.</p>

  <p>But it was light under these trees for all that, and on the leaves and
  amidst the turf shone a multitude of glow-worms, very bright and fine. Mr.
  Skelmersdale's first impression was that he was <i>small</i>, and the next
  that quite a number of people still smaller were standing all about him. For
  some reason, he says, he was neither surprised nor frightened, but sat up
  quite deliberately and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. And there all about
  him stood the smiling elves who had caught him sleeping under their
  privileges and had brought him into Fairyland.</p>

  <p>What these elves were like I have failed to gather, so vague and imperfect
  is his vocabulary, and so unobservant of all minor detail does he seem to
  have been. They were clothed in something very light and beautiful, that was
  neither wool, nor silk, nor leaves, nor the petals of flowers. They stood all
  about him as he sat and waked, and down the glade towards him, down a
  glow-worm avenue and fronted by a star, came at once that Fairy Lady who is
  the chief personage of his memory and tale. Of her I gathered more. She was
  clothed in filmy green, and about her little waist was a broad silver girdle.
  Her hair waved back from her forehead on either side; there were curls not
  too wayward and yet astray, and on her brow was a little tiara, set with a
  single star. Her sleeves were some sort of open sleeves that gave little
  glimpses of her arms; her throat, I think, was a little displayed, because he
  speaks of the beauty of her neck and chin. There was a necklace of coral
  about her white throat, and in her breast a coral-coloured flower. She had
  the soft lines of a little child in her chin and cheeks and throat. And her
  eyes, I gather, were of a kindled brown, very soft and straight and sweet
  under her level brows. You see by these particulars how greatly this lady
  must have loomed in Mr. Skelmersdale's picture. Certain things he tried to
  express and could not express; "the way she moved," he said several times;
  and I fancy a sort of demure joyousness radiated from this Lady.</p>

  <p>And it was in the company of this delightful person, as the guest and
  chosen companion of this delightful person, that Mr. Skelmersdale set out to
  be taken into the intimacies of Fairyland. She welcomed him gladly and a
  little warmly&mdash;I suspect a pressure of his hand in both of hers and a
  lit face to his. After all, ten years ago young Skelmersdale may have been a
  very comely youth. And once she took his arm, and once, I think, she led him
  by the hand adown the glade that the glow-worms lit.</p>

  <p>Just how things chanced and happened there is no telling from Mr.
  Skelmersdale's disarticulated skeleton of description. He gives little
  unsatisfactory glimpses of strange corners and doings, of places where there
  were many fairies together, of "toadstool things that shone pink," of fairy
  food, of which he could only say "you should have tasted it!" and of fairy
  music, "like a little musical box," that came out of nodding flowers. There
  was a great open place where fairies rode and raced on "things," but what Mr.
  Skelmersdale meant by "these here things they rode," there is no telling.
  Larvae, perhaps, or crickets, or the little beetles that elude us so
  abundantly. There was a place where water splashed and gigantic king-cups
  grew, and there in the hotter times the fairies bathed together. There were
  games being played and dancing and much elvish love-making, too, I think,
  among the moss-branch thickets. There can be no doubt that the Fairy Lady
  made love to Mr. Skelmersdale, and no doubt either that this young man set
  himself to resist her. A time came, indeed, when she sat on a bank beside
  him, in a quiet, secluded place "all smelling of vi'lets," and talked to him
  of love.</p>

  <p>"When her voice went low and she whispered," said Mr. Skelmersdale, "and
  laid 'er 'and on my 'and, you know, and came close with a soft, warm friendly
  way she 'ad, it was as much as I could do to keep my 'ead."</p>

  <p>It seems he kept his head to a certain limited unfortunate extent. He saw
  "'ow the wind was blowing," he says, and so, sitting there in a place all
  smelling of violets, with the touch of this lovely Fairy Lady about him, Mr.
  Skelmersdale broke it to her gently&mdash;that he was engaged!</p>

  <p>She had told him she loved him dearly, that he was a sweet human lad for
  her, and whatever he would ask of her he should have&mdash;even his heart's
  desire.</p>

  <p>And Mr. Skelmersdale, who, I fancy, tried hard to avoid looking at her
  little lips as they just dropped apart and came together, led up to the more
  intimate question by saying he would like enough capital to start a little
  shop. He'd just like to feel, he said, he had money enough to do that. I
  imagine a little surprise in those brown eyes he talked about, but she seemed
  sympathetic for all that, and she asked him many questions about the little
  shop, "laughing like" all the time. So he got to the complete statement of
  his affianced position, and told her all about Millie.</p>

  <p>"All?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Everything," said Mr. Skelmersdale, "just who she was, and where she
  lived, and everything about her. I sort of felt I 'ad to all the time, I
  did."</p>

  <p>"'Whatever you want you shall have,' said the Fairy Lady. 'That's as good
  as done. You <i>shall</i> feel you have the money just as you wish. And now,
  you know&mdash;<i>You must kiss me.</i>'"</p>

  <p>And Mr. Skelmersdale pretended not to hear the latter part of her remark,
  and said she was very kind. That he really didn't deserve she should be so
  kind. And&mdash;</p>

  <p>The Fairy Lady suddenly came quite close to him and whispered, "Kiss
  me!"</p>

  <p>"And," said Mr. Skelmersdale, "like a fool, I did."</p>

  <p>There are kisses and kisses, I am told, and this must have been quite the
  other sort from Millie's resonant signals of regard. There was something
  magic in that kiss; assuredly it marked a turning point. At any rate, this is
  one of the passages that he thought sufficiently important to describe most
  at length. I have tried to get it right, I have tried to disentangle it from
  the hints and gestures through which it came to me, but I have no doubt that
  it was all different from my telling and far finer and sweeter, in the soft
  filtered light and the subtly stirring silences of the fairy glades. The
  Fairy Lady asked him more about Millie, and was she very lovely, and so
  on&mdash;a great many times. As to Millie's loveliness, I conceive him
  answering that she was "all right." And then, or on some such occasion, the
  Fairy Lady told him she had fallen in love with him as he slept in the
  moonlight, and so he had been brought into Fairyland, and she had thought,
  not knowing of Millie, that perhaps he might chance to love her. "But now you
  know you can't," she said, "so you must stop with me just a little while, and
  then you must go back to Millie." She told him that, and you know
  Skelmersdale was already in love with her, but the pure inertia of his mind
  kept him in the way he was going. I imagine him sitting in a sort of
  stupefaction amidst all these glowing beautiful things, answering about his
  Millie and the little shop he projected and the need of a horse and cart...
  And that absurd state of affairs must have gone on for days and days. I see
  this little lady, hovering about him and trying to amuse him, too dainty to
  understand his complexity and too tender to let him go. And he, you know,
  hypnotised as it were by his earthly position, went his way with her hither
  and thither, blind to everything in Fairyland but this wonderful intimacy
  that had come to him. It is hard, it is impossible, to give in print the
  effect of her radiant sweetness shining through the jungle of poor
  Skelmersdale's rough and broken sentences. To me, at least, she shone clear
  amidst the muddle of his story like a glow-worm in a tangle of weeds.</p>

  <p>There must have been many days of things while all this was happening
  &mdash;and once, I say, they danced under the moonlight in the fairy rings
  that stud the meadows near Smeeth&mdash;but at last it all came to an end.
  She led him into a great cavernous place, lit by a red nightlight sort of
  thing, where there were coffers piled on coffers, and cups and golden boxes,
  and a great heap of what certainly seemed to all Mr. Skelmersdale's senses
  &mdash;coined gold. There were little gnomes amidst this wealth, who saluted
  her at her coming, and stood aside. And suddenly she turned on him there with
  brightly shining eyes.</p>

  <p>"And now," she said, "you have been kind to stay with me so long, and it
  is time I let you go. You must go back to your Millie. You must go back to
  your Millie, and here&mdash;just as I promised you&mdash;they will give you
  gold."</p>

  <p>"She choked like," said Mr. Skelmersdale. "At that, I had a sort of
  feeling&mdash;" (he touched his breastbone) "as though I was fainting here. I
  felt pale, you know, and shivering, and even then&mdash;I 'adn't a thing to
  say."</p>

  <p>He paused. "Yes," I said.</p>

  <p>The scene was beyond his describing. But I know that she kissed him good-
  bye.</p>

  <p>"And you said nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he said. "I stood like a stuffed calf. She just looked back
  once, you know, and stood smiling like and crying&mdash;I could see the shine
  of her eyes&mdash;and then she was gone, and there was all these little
  fellows bustling about me, stuffing my 'ands and my pockets and the back of
  my collar and everywhere with gold."</p>

  <p>And then it was, when the Fairy Lady had vanished, that Mr. Skelmersdale
  really understood and knew. He suddenly began plucking out the gold they were
  thrusting upon him, and shouting out at them to prevent their giving him
  more. "'I don't <i>want</i> yer gold,' I said. 'I 'aven't done yet. I'm not
  going. I want to speak to that Fairy Lady again.' I started off to go after
  her and they held me back. Yes, stuck their little 'ands against my middle
  and shoved me back. They kept giving me more and more gold until it was
  running all down my trouser legs and dropping out of my 'ands. 'I don't
  <i>want</i> yer gold,' I says to them, 'I want just to speak to the Fairy
  Lady again.'"</p>

  <p>"And did you?"</p>

  <p>"It came to a tussle."</p>

  <p>"Before you saw her?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't see her. When I got out from them she wasn't anywhere to be
  seen."</p>

  <p>So he ran in search of her out of this red-lit cave, down a long grotto,
  seeking her, and thence he came out in a great and desolate place athwart
  which a swarm of will-o'-the-wisps were flying to and fro. And about him
  elves were dancing in derision, and the little gnomes came out of the cave
  after him, carrying gold in handfuls and casting it after him, shouting,
  "Fairy love and fairy gold! Fairy love and fairy gold!"</p>

  <p>And when he heard these words, came a great fear that it was all over, and
  he lifted up his voice and called to her by her name, and suddenly set
  himself to run down the slope from the mouth of the cavern, through a place
  of thorns and briers, calling after her very loudly and often. The elves
  danced about him unheeded, pinching him and pricking him, and the
  will-o'-the-wisps circled round him and dashed into his face, and the gnomes
  pursued him shouting and pelting him with fairy gold. As he ran with all this
  strange rout about him and distracting him, suddenly he was knee-deep in a
  swamp, and suddenly he was amidst thick twisted roots, and he caught his foot
  in one and stumbled and fell...</p>

  <p>He fell and he rolled over, and in that instant he found himself sprawling
  upon Aldington Knoll, all lonely under the stars.</p>

  <p>He sat up sharply at once, he says, and found he was very stiff and cold,
  and his clothes were damp with dew. The first pallor of dawn and a chilly
  wind were coming up together. He could have believed the whole thing a
  strangely vivid dream until he thrust his hand into his side pocket and found
  it stuffed with ashes. Then he knew for certain it was fairy gold they had
  given him. He could feel all their pinches and pricks still, though there was
  never a bruise upon him. And in that manner, and so suddenly, Mr.
  Skelmersdale came out of Fairyland back into this world of men. Even then he
  fancied the thing was but the matter of a night until he returned to the shop
  at Aldington Corner and discovered amidst their astonishment that he had been
  away three weeks.</p>

  <p>"Lor'! the trouble I 'ad!" said Mr. Skelmersdale.</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Explaining. I suppose you've never had anything like that to
  explain."</p>

  <p>"Never," I said, and he expatiated for a time on the behaviour of this
  person and that. One name he avoided for a space.</p>

  <p>"And Millie?" said I at last.</p>

  <p>"I didn't seem to care a bit for seeing Millie," he said.</p>

  <p>"I expect she seemed changed?"</p>

  <p>"Every one was changed. Changed for good. Every one seemed big, you know,
  and coarse. And their voices seemed loud. Why, the sun, when it rose in the
  morning, fair hit me in the eye!"</p>

  <p>"And Millie?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to see Millie."</p>

  <p>"And when you did?"</p>

  <p>"I came up against her Sunday, coming out of church. 'Where you been?' she
  said, and I saw there was a row. <i>I</i> didn't care if there was. I seemed
  to forget about her even while she was there a-talking to me. She was just
  nothing. I couldn't make out whatever I 'ad seen in 'er ever, or what there
  could 'ave been. Sometimes when she wasn't about, I did get back a little,
  but never when she was there. Then it was always the other came up and
  blotted her out... Anyow, it didn't break her heart."</p>

  <p>"Married?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Married 'er cousin," said Mr. Skelmersdale, and reflected on the pattern
  of the tablecloth for a space.</p>

  <p>When he spoke again it was clear that his former sweetheart had clean
  vanished from his mind, and that the talk had brought back the Fairy Lady
  triumphant in his heart. He talked of her&mdash;soon he was letting out the
  oddest things, queer love secrets it would be treachery to repeat. I think,
  indeed, that was the queerest thing in the whole affair, to hear that neat
  little grocer man after his story was done, with a glass of whisky beside him
  and a cigar between his fingers, witnessing, with sorrow still, though now,
  indeed, with a time-blunted anguish, of the inappeasable hunger of the heart
  that presently came upon him. "I couldn't eat," he said, "I couldn't sleep. I
  made mistakes in orders and got mixed with change. There she was day and
  night, drawing me and drawing me. Oh, I wanted her. Lord! how I wanted her! I
  was up there, most evenings I was up there on the Knoll, often even when it
  rained. I used to walk over the Knoll and round it and round it, calling for
  them to let me in. Shouting. Near blubbering I was at times. Daft I was and
  miserable. I kept on saying it was all a mistake. And every Sunday afternoon
  I went up there, wet and fine, though I knew as well as you do it wasn't no
  good by day. And I've tried to go to sleep there."</p>

  <p>He stopped sharply and decided to drink some whisky.</p>

  <p>"I've tried to go to sleep there," he said, and I could swear his lips
  trembled. "I've tried to go to sleep there, often and often. And, you know, I
  couldn't, sir&mdash;never. I've thought if I could go to sleep there, there
  might be something. But I've sat up there and laid up there, and I couldn't
  &mdash;not for thinking and longing. It's the longing... I've
  tried&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He blew, drank up the rest of his whisky spasmodically, stood up suddenly
  and buttoned his jacket, staring closely and critically at the cheap
  oleographs beside the mantel meanwhile. The little black notebook in which he
  recorded the orders of his daily round projected stiffly from his breast
  pocket. When all the buttons were quite done, he patted his chest and turned
  on me suddenly. "Well," he said, "I must be going."</p>

  <p>There was something in his eyes and manner that was too difficult for him
  to express in words. "One gets talking," he said at last at the door, and
  smiled wanly, and so vanished from my eyes. And that is the tale of Mr.
  Skelmersdale in Fairyland just as he told it to me.</p>

     name="story61">THE VALLEY OF SPIDERS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, March 1903</h3>

  <p>Towards mid-day the three pursuers came abruptly round a bend in the
  torrent bed upon the sight of a very broad and spacious valley. The difficult
  and winding trench of pebbles along which they had tracked the fugitives for
  so long, expanded to a broad slope, and with a common impulse the three men
  left the trail, and rode to a little eminence set with olive-dun trees, and
  there halted, the two others, as became them, a little behind the man with
  the silver-studded bridle.</p>

  <p>For a space they scanned the great expanse below them with eager eyes. It
  spread remoter and remoter, with only a few clusters of sere thorn bushes
  here and there, and the dim suggestions of some now waterless ravine, to
  break its desolation of yellow grass. Its purple distances melted at last
  into the bluish slopes of the further hills&mdash;hills it might be of a
  greener kind&mdash;and above them invisibly supported, and seeming indeed to
  hang in the blue, were the snowclad summits of mountains that grew larger and
  bolder to the north-westward as the sides of the valley drew together. And
  westward the valley opened until a distant darkness under the sky told where
  the forests began. But the three men looked neither east nor west, but only
  steadfastly across the valley.</p>

  <p>The gaunt man with the scarred lip was the first to speak. "Nowhere," he
  said, with a sigh of disappointment in his voice. "But after all, they had a
  full day's start."</p>

  <p>"They don't know we are after them," said the little man on the white
  horse.</p>

  <p>"<i>She</i> would know," said the leader bitterly, as if speaking to
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Even then they can't go fast. They've got no beast but the mule, and all
  to-day the girl's foot has been bleeding&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>The man with the silver bridle flashed a quick intensity of rage on him.
  "Do you think I haven't seen that?" he snarled.</p>

  <p>"It helps, anyhow," whispered the little man to himself.</p>

  <p>The gaunt man with the scarred lip stared impassively. "They can't be over
  the valley," he said. "If we ride hard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He glanced at the white horse and paused.</p>

  <p>"Curse all white horses!" said the man with the silver bridle, and turned
  to scan the beast his curse included.</p>

  <p>The little man looked down between the mclancholy ears of his steed.</p>

  <p>"I did my best," he said.</p>

  <p>The two others stared again across the valley for a space. The gaunt man
  passed the back of his hand across the scarred lip.</p>

  <p>"Come up!" said the man who owned the silver bridle, suddenly. The little
  man started and jerked his rein, and the horse hoofs of the three made a
  multitudinous faint pattering upon the withered grass as they turned back
  towards the trail...</p>

  <p>They rode cautiously down the long slope before them, and so came through
  a waste of prickly, twisted bushes and strange dry shapes of horny branches
  that grew amongst the rocks, into the levels below. And there the trail grew
  faint, for the soil was scanty, and the only herbage was this scorched dead
  straw that lay upon the ground. Still, by hard scanning, by leaning beside
  the horses' necks and pausing ever and again, even these white men could
  contrive to follow after their prey.</p>

  <p>There were trodden places, bent and broken blades of the coarse grass, and
  ever and again the sufficient intimation of a footmark. And once the leader
  saw a brown smear of blood where the half-caste girl may have trod. And at
  that under his breath he cursed her for a fool.</p>

  <p>The gaunt man checked his leader's tracking, and the little man on the
  white horse rode behind, a man lost in a dream. They rode one after another,
  the man with the silver bridle led the way, and they spoke never a word.
  After a time it came to the little man on the white horse that the world was
  very still. He started out of his dream. Besides the little noises of their
  horses and equipment, the whole great valley kept the brooding quiet of a
  painted scene.</p>

  <p>Before him went his master and his fellow, each intently leaning forward
  to the left, each impassively moving with the paces of his horse; their
  shadows went before them&mdash;still, noiseless, tapering attendants; and
  nearer a crouched cool shape was his own. He looked about him. What was it
  had gone? Then he remembered the reverberation from the banks of the gorge
  and the perpetual accompaniment of shifting, jostling pebbles. And,
  moreover&mdash;? There was no breeze. That was it! What a vast, still place
  it was, a monotonous afternoon slumber. And the sky open and blank, except
  for a sombre veil of haze that had gathered in the upper valley.</p>

  <p>He straightened his back, fretted with his bridle, puckered his lips to
  whistle, and simply sighed. He turned in his saddle for a time, and stared at
  the throat of the mountain gorge out of which they had come. Blank! Blank
  slopes on either side, with never a sign of a decent beast or tree&mdash;much
  less a man. What a land it was! What a wilderness! He dropped again into his
  former pose.</p>

  <p>It filled him with a momentary pleasure to see a wry stick of purple black
  flash out into the form of a snake, and vanish amidst the brown. After all,
  the infernal valley WAS alive. And then, to rejoice him still more, came a
  little breath across his face, a whisper that came and went, the faintest
  inclination of a stiff black-antlered bush upon a little crest, the first
  intimations of a possible breeze. Idly he wetted his finger, and held it
  up.</p>

  <p>He pulled up sharply to avoid a collision with the gaunt man, who had
  stopped at fault upon the trail. Just at that guilty moment he caught his
  master's eye looking towards him.</p>

  <p>For a time he forced an interest in the tracking. Then, as they rode on
  again, he studied his master's shadow and hat and shoulder, appearing and
  disappearing behind the gaunt man's nearer contours. They had ridden four
  days out of the very limits of the world into this desolate place, short of
  water, with nothing but a strip of dried meat under their saddles, over rocks
  and mountains, where surely none but these fugitives had ever been
  before&mdash;for <i>that</i>!</p>

  <p>And all this was for a girl, a mere wilful child! And the man had whole
  cityfuls of people to do his basest bidding&mdash;girls, women! Why in the
  name of passionate folly <i>this</i> one in particular? asked the little man,
  and scowled at the world, and licked his parched lips with a blackened
  tongue. It was the way of the master, and that was all he knew. Just because
  she sought to evade him...</p>

  <p>His eye caught a whole row of high plumed canes bending in unison, and
  then the tails of silk that hung before his neck flapped and fell. The breeze
  was growing stronger. Somehow it took the stiff stillness out of
  things&mdash;and that was well.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" said the gaunt man.</p>

  <p>All three stopped abruptly.</p>

  <p>"What?" asked the master. "What?"</p>

  <p>"Over there," said the gaunt man, pointing up the valley.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Something coming towards us."</p>

  <p>And as he spoke a yellow animal crested a rise and came bearing down upon
  them. It was a big wild dog, coming before the wind, tongue out, at a steady
  pace, and running with such an intensity of purpose that he did not seem to
  see the horsemen he approached. He ran with his nose up, following, it was
  plain, neither scent nor quarry. As he drew nearer the little man felt for
  his sword. "He's mad," said the gaunt rider.</p>

  <p>"Shout!" said the little man, and shouted.</p>

  <p>The dog came on. Then when the little man's blade was already out, it
  swerved aside and went panting by them and past. The eyes of the little man
  followed its flight. "There was no foam," he said. For a space the man with
  the silver-studded bridle stared up the valley. "Oh, come on!" he cried at
  last. "What does it matter?" and jerked his horse into movement again.</p>

  <p>The little man left the insoluble mystery of a dog that fled from nothing
  but the wind, and lapsed into profound musings on human character. "Come on!"
  he whispered to himself. "Why should it be given to one man to say 'Come on!'
  with that stupendous violence of effect. Always, all his life, the man with
  the silver bridle has been saying that. If <i>I</i> said it&mdash;!" thought
  the little man. But people marvelled when the master was disobeyed even in
  the wildest things. This half-caste girl seemed to him, seemed to every one,
  mad&mdash;blasphemous almost. The little man, by way of comparison, reflected
  on the gaunt rider with the scarred lip, as stalwart as his master, as brave
  and, indeed, perhaps braver, and yet for him there was obedience, nothing but
  to give obedience duly and stoutly...</p>

  <p>Certain sensations of the hands and knees called the little man back to
  more immediate things. He became aware of something. He rode up beside his
  gaunt fellow. "Do you notice the horses?" he said in an undertone.</p>

  <p>The gaunt face looked interrogation.</p>

  <p>"They don't like this wind," said the little man, and dropped behind as
  the man with the silver bridle turned upon him.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," said the gaunt-faced man.</p>

  <p>They rode on again for a space in silence. The foremost two rode downcast
  upon the trail, the hindmost man watched the haze that crept down the
  vastness of the valley, nearer and nearer, and noted how the wind grew in
  strength moment by moment. Far away on the left he saw a line of dark
  bulks&mdash;wild hog perhaps, galloping down the valley, but of that he said
  nothing, nor did he remark again upon the uneasiness of the horses.</p>

  <p>And then he saw first one and then a second great white ball, a great
  shining white ball like a gigantic head of thistle-down, that drove before
  the wind athwart the path. These balls soared high in the air, and dropped
  and rose again and caught for a moment, and hurried on and passed, but at the
  sight of them the restlessness of the horses increased.</p>

  <p>Then presently he saw that more of these drifting globes&mdash;and then
  soon very many more&mdash;were hurrying towards him down the valley.</p>

  <p>They became aware of a squealing. Athwart the path a huge boar rushed,
  turning his head but for one instant to glance at them, and then hurling on
  down the valley again. And at that, all three stopped and sat in their
  saddles, staring into the thickening haze that was coming upon them.</p>

  <p>"If it were not for this thistle-down&mdash;" began the leader.</p>

  <p>But now a big globe came drifting past within a score of yards of them. It
  was really not an even sphere at all, but a vast, soft, ragged, filmy thing,
  a sheet gathered by the corners, an aerial jelly-fish, as it were, but
  rolling over and over as it advanced, and trailing long, cobwebby threads and
  streamers that floated in its wake.</p>

  <p>"It isn't thistle-down," said the little man.</p>

  <p>"I don't like the stuff," said the gaunt man.</p>

  <p>And they looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"Curse it!" cried the leader. "The air's full of it up there. If it keeps
  on at this pace long, it will stop us altogether."</p>

  <p>An instinctive feeling, such as lines out a herd of deer at the approach
  of some ambiguous thing, prompted them to turn their horses to the wind, ride
  forward for a few paces, and stare at that advancing multitude of floating
  masses. They came on before the wind with a sort of smooth swiftness, rising
  and falling noiselessly, sinking to earth, rebounding high, soaring&mdash;all
  with a perfect unanimity, with a still, deliberate assurance.</p>

  <p>Right and left of the horsemen the pioneers of this strange army passed.
  At one that rolled along the ground, breaking shapelessly and trailing out
  reluctantly into long grappling ribbons and bands, all three horses began to
  shy and dance. The master was seized with a sudden unreasonable impatience.
  He cursed the drifting globes roundly. "Get on!" he cried; "get on! What do
  these things matter? How <i>can</i> they matter? Back to the trail!" He fell
  swearing at his horse and sawed the bit across its mouth.</p>

  <p>He shouted aloud with rage. "I will follow that trail, I tell you!" he
  cried. "Where is the trail?"</p>

  <p>He gripped the bridle of his prancing horse and searched amidst the grass.
  A long and clinging thread fell across his face, a grey streamer dropped
  about his bridle-arm, some big, active thing with many legs ran down the back
  of his head. He looked up to discover one of those grey masses anchored as it
  were above him by these things and flapping out ends as a sail flaps when a
  boat comes, about&mdash;but noiselessly.</p>

  <p>He had an impression of many eyes, of a dense crew of squat bodies, of
  long, many-jointed limbs hauling at their mooring ropes to bring the thing
  down upon him. For a space he stared up, reining in his prancing horse with
  the instinct born of years of horsemanship. Then the flat of a sword smote
  his back, and a blade flashed overhead and cut the drifting balloon of
  spider-web free, and the whole mass lifted softly and drove clear and
  away.</p>

  <p>"Spiders!" cried the voice of the gaunt man. "The things are full of big
  spiders! Look, my lord!"</p>

  <p>The man with the silver bridle still followed the mass that drove
  away.</p>

  <p>"Look, my lord!"</p>

  <p>The master found himself staring down at a red, smashed thing on the
  ground that, in spite of partial obliteration, could still wriggle unavailing
  legs. Then when the gaunt man pointed to another mass that bore down upon
  them, he drew his sword hastily. Up the valley now it was like a fog bank
  torn to rags. He tried to grasp the situation.</p>

  <p>"Ride for it!" the little man was shouting. "Ride for it down the
  valley."</p>

  <p>What happened then was like the confusion of a battle. The man with the
  silver bridle saw the little man go past him slashing furiously at imaginary
  cobwebs, saw him cannon into the horse of the gaunt man and hurl it and its
  rider to earth. His own horse went a dozen paces before he could rein it in.
  Then he looked up to avoid imaginary dangers, and then back again to see a
  horse rolling on the ground, the gaunt man standing and slashing over it at a
  rent and fluttering mass of grey that streamed and wrapped about them both.
  And thick and fast as thistle-down on waste land on a windy day in July, the
  cobweb masses were coming on.</p>

  <p>The little man had dismounted, but he dared not release his horse. He was
  endeavouring to lug the struggling brute back with the strength of one arm,
  while with the other he slashed aimlessly, The tentacles of a second grey
  mass had entangled themselves with the struggle, and this second grey mass
  came to its moorings, and slowly sank.</p>

  <p>The master set his teeth, gripped his bridle, lowered his head, and
  spurred his horse forward. The horse on the ground rolled over, there were
  blood and moving shapes upon the flanks, and the gaunt man, suddenly leaving
  it, ran forward towards his master, perhaps ten paces. His legs were swathed
  and encumbered with grey; he made ineffectual movements with his sword. Grey
  streamers waved from him; there was a thin veil of grey across his face. With
  his left hand he beat at something on his body, and suddenly he stumbled and
  fell. He struggled to rise, and fell again, and suddenly, horribly, began to
  howl, "Oh&mdash;ohoo, ohooh!"</p>

  <p>The master could see the great spiders upon him, and others upon the
  ground.</p>

  <p>As he strove to force his horse nearer to this gesticulating, screaming
  grey object that struggled up and down, there came a clatter of hoofs, and
  the little man, in act of mounting, swordless, balanced on his belly athwart
  the white horse, and clutching its mane, whirled past. And again a clinging
  thread of grey gossamer swept across the master's face. All about him, and
  over him, it seemed this drifting, noiseless cobweb circled and drew nearer
  him...</p>

  <p>To the day of his death he never knew just how the event of that moment
  happened. Did he, indeed, turn his horse, or did it really of its own accord
  stampede after its fellow? Suffice it that in another second he was galloping
  full tilt down the valley with his sword whirling furiously overhead. And all
  about him on the quickening breeze, the spiders' airships, their air bundles
  and air sheets, seemed to him to hurry in a conscious pursuit.</p>

  <p>Clatter, clatter, thud, thud&mdash;the man with the silver bridle rode,
  heedless of his direction, with his fearful face looking up now right, now
  left, and his sword arm ready to slash. And a few hundred yards ahead of him,
  with a tail of torn cobweb trailing behind him, rode the little man on the
  white horse, still but imperfectly in the saddle. The reeds bent before them,
  the wind blew fresh and strong, over his shoulder the master could see the
  webs hurrying to overtake...</p>

  <p>He was so intent to escape the spiders' webs that only as his horse
  gathered together for a leap did he realise the ravine ahead. And then he
  reaIised it only to misunderstand and interfere. He was leaning forward on
  his horse's neck and sat up and back all too late.</p>

  <p>But if in his excitement he had failed to leap, at any rate he had not
  forgotten how to fall. He was horseman again in mid-air. He came off clear
  with a mere bruise upon his shoulder, and his horse rolled, kicking spasmodic
  legs, and lay still. But the master's sword drove its point into the hard
  soil, and snapped clean across, as though Chance refused him any longer as
  her Knight, and the splintered end missed his face by an inch or so.</p>

  <p>He was on his feet in a moment, breathlessly scanning the onrushing
  spider-webs. For a moment he was minded to run, and then thought of the
  ravine, and turned back. He ran aside once to dodge one drifting terror, and
  then he was swiftly clambering down the precipitous sides, and out of the
  touch of the gale.</p>

  <p>There under the lee of the dry torrent's steeper banks he might crouch,
  and watch these strange, grey masses pass and pass in safety till the wind
  fell, and it became possible to escape. And there for a long time he
  crouched, watching the strange, grey, ragged masses trail their streamers
  across his narrowed sky.</p>

  <p>Once a stray spider fell into the ravine close beside him&mdash;a full
  foot it measured from leg to leg, and its body was half a man's
  hand&mdash;and after he had watched its monstrous alacrity of search and
  escape for a little while, and tempted it to bite his broken sword, he lifted
  up his iron-heeled boot and smashed it into a pulp. He swore as he did so,
  and for a time sought up and down for another.</p>

  <p>Then presently, when he was surer these spider swarms could not drop into
  the ravine, he found a place where he could sit down, and sat and fell into
  deep thought and began after his manner to gnaw his knuckles and bite his
  nails. And from this he was moved by the coming of the man with the white
  horse.</p>

  <p>He heard him long before he saw him, as a clattering of hoofs, stumbling
  footsteps, and a reassuring voice. Then the little man appeared, a rueful
  figure, still with a tail of white cobweb trailing behind him. They
  approached each other without speaking, without a salutation. The little man
  was fatigued and shamed to the pitch of hopeless bitterness, and came to a
  stop at last, face to face with his seated master. The latter winced a little
  under his dependant's eye. "Well?" he said at last, with no pretence of
  authority.</p>

  <p>"You left him?"</p>

  <p>"My horse bolted."</p>

  <p>"I know. So did mine."</p>

  <p>He laughed at his master mirthlessly.</p>

  <p>"I say my horse bolted," said the man who once had a silver-studded
  bridle.</p>

  <p>"Cowards both," said the little man.</p>

  <p>The other gnawed his knuckle through some meditative moments, with his eye
  on his inferior.</p>

  <p>"Don't call me a coward," he said at length.</p>

  <p>"You are a coward like myself."</p>

  <p>"A coward possibly. There is a limit beyond which every man must fear.
  That I have learnt at last. But not like yourself. That is where the
  difference comes in."</p>

  <p>"I never could have dreamt you would have left him. He saved your life two
  minutes before... Why are you our lord?"</p>

  <p>The master gnawed his knuckles again, and his countenance was dark.</p>

  <p>"No man calls me a coward," he said. "No. A broken sword is better than
  none... One spavined white horse cannot be expected to carry two men a four
  days' journey. I hate white horses, but this time it cannot be helped. You
  begin to understand me?...I perceive that you are minded, on the strength of
  what you have seen and fancy, to taint my reputation. It is men of your sort
  who unmake kings. Besides which&mdash;I never liked you."</p>

  <p>"My lord!" said the little man.</p>

  <p>"No," said the master. <i>"No!"</i></p>

  <p>He stood up sharply as the little man moved. For a minute perhaps they
  faced one another. Overhead the spiders' balls went driving. There was a
  quick movement among the pebbles; a running of feet, a cry of despair, a gasp
  and a blow...</p>

  <p>Towards nightfall the wind fell. The sun set in a calm serenity, and the
  man who had once possessed the silver bridle came at last very cautiously and
  by an easy slope out of the ravine again; but now he led the white horse that
  once belonged to the little man. He would have gone back to his horse to get
  his silver-mounted bridle again, but he feared night and a quickening breeze
  might still find him in the valley, and besides he disliked greatly to think
  he might discover his horse all swathed in cobwebs and perhaps unpleasantly
  eaten.</p>

  <p>And as he thought of those cobwebs and of all the dangers he had been
  through, and the manner in which he had been preserved that day, his hand
  sought a little reliquary that hung about his neck, and he clasped it for a
  moment with heartfelt gratitude. As he did so his eyes went across the
  valley.</p>

  <p>"I was hot with passion," he said, "and now she has met her reward. They
  also, no doubt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And behold! Far away out of the wooded slopes across the valley, but in
  the clearness of the sunset distinct and unmistakable, he saw a little spire
  of smoke.</p>

  <p>At that his expression of serene resignation changed to an amazed anger.
  Smoke? He turned the head of the white horse about, and hesitated. And as he
  did so a little rustle of air went through the grass about him. Far away upon
  some reeds swayed a tattered sheet of grey. He looked at the cobwebs; he
  looked at the smoke.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, after all, it is not them," he said at last.</p>

  <p>But he knew better.</p>

  <p>After he had stared at the smoke for some time, he mounted the white
  horse.</p>

  <p>As he rode, he picked his way amidst stranded masses of web. For some
  reason there were many dead spiders on the ground, and those that lived
  feasted guiltily on their fellows. At the sound of his horse's hoofs they
  fled.</p>

  <p>Their time had passed. From the ground without either a wind to carry them
  or a winding sheet ready, these things, for all their poison, could do him
  little evil. He flicked with his belt at those he fancied came too near.
  Once, where a number ran together over a bare place, he was minded to
  dismount and trample them with his boots, but this impulse he overcame. Ever
  and again he turned in his saddle, and looked back at the smoke.</p>

  <p>"Spiders," he muttered over and over again. "Spiders! Well, well... The
  next time I must spin a web."</p>

     name="story62">THE TRUTH ABOUT PYECRAFT</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, April 1903</h3>

  <p>He sits not a dozen yards away. If I glance over my shoulder I can see
  him. And if I catch his eye&mdash;and usually I catch his eye&mdash;it meets
  me with an expression.</p>

  <p>It is mainly an imploring look&mdash;and yet with suspicion in it.</p>

  <p>Confound his suspicion! If I wanted to tell on him I should have told long
  ago. I don't tell and I don't tell, and he ought to feel at his ease. As if
  anything so gross and fat as he could feel at ease! Who would believe me if I
  did tell?</p>

  <p>Poor old Pyecraft! Great, uneasy jelly of substance! The fattest clubman
  in London.</p>

  <p>He sits at one of the little club tables in the huge bay by the fire,
  stuffing. What is he stuffing? I glance judiciously and catch him biting at a
  round of hot buttered tea-cake, with his eyes on me. Confound him!&mdash;with
  his eyes on me!</p>

  <p>That settles it, Pyecraft! Since you <i>will</i> be abject, since you
  <i>will</i> behave as though I was not a man of honour, here, right under
  your embedded eyes, I write the thing down&mdash;the plain truth about
  Pyecraft. The man I helped, the man I shielded, and who has requited me by
  making my club unendurable, absolutely unendurable, with his liquid appeal,
  with the perpetual "don't tell" of his looks.</p>

  <p>And, besides, why does he keep on eternally eating?</p>

  <p>Well, here goes for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
  truth!</p>

  <p>Pyecraft&mdash;. I made the acquaintance of Pyecraft in this very smoking-
  room. I was a young, nervous new member, and he saw it. I was sitting all
  alone, wishing I knew more of the members, and suddenly he came, a great
  rolling front of chins and abdomina, towards me, and grunted and sat down in
  a chair close by me and wheezed for a space, and scraped for a space with a
  match and lit a cigar, and then addressed me. I forget what he
  said&mdash;something about the matches not lighting properly, and afterwards
  as he talked he kept stopping the waiters one by one as they went by, and
  telling them about the matches in that thin, fluty voice he has. But, anyhow,
  it was in some such way we began our talking.</p>

  <p>He talked about various things and came round to games. And thence to my
  figure and complexion. "<i>You</i> ought to be a good cricketer," he said. I
  suppose I am slender, slender to what some people would call lean, and I
  suppose I am rather dark, still&mdash;I am not ashamed of having a Hindu
  great-grandmother, but, for all that, I don't want casual strangers to see
  through me at a glance to <i>her</i>. So that I was set against Pyecraft from
  the beginning.</p>

  <p>But he only talked about me in order to get to himself.</p>

  <p>"I expect," he said, "you take no more exercise than I do, and probably
  you eat no less." (Like all excessively obese people he fancied he ate
  nothing.) "Yet,"&mdash;and he smiled an oblique smile&mdash;"we differ."</p>

  <p>And then he began to talk about his fatness and his fatness; all he did
  for his fatness and all he was going to do for his fatness; what people had
  advised him to do for his fatness and what he had heard of people doing for
  fatness similar to his. "A priori," he said, "one would think a question of
  nutrition could be answered by dietary and a question of assimilation by
  drugs." It was stifling. It was dumpling talk. It made me feel swelled to
  hear him.</p>

  <p>One stands that sort of thing once in a way at a club, but a time came
  when I fancied I was standing too much. He took to me altogether too
  conspicuously. I could never go into the smoking-room but he would come
  wallowing towards me, and sometimes he came and gormandised round and about
  me while I had my lunch. He seemed at times almost to be clinging to me. He
  was a bore, but not so fearful a bore as to be limited to me; and from the
  first there was something in his manner&mdash;almost as though he knew,
  almost as though he penetrated to the fact that I <i>might</i>&mdash;that
  there was a remote, exceptional chance in me that no one else presented.</p>

  <p>"I'd give anything to get it down," he would say&mdash;"anything," and
  peer at me over his vast cheeks and pant.</p>

  <p>Poor old Pyecraft! He has just gonged, no doubt to order another buttered
  tea-cake!</p>

  <p>He came to the actual thing one day. "Our Pharmacopoeia," he said, "our
  Western Pharmacopoeia, is anything but the last word of medical science. In
  the East, I've been told&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped and stared at me. It was like being at an aquarium.</p>

  <p>I was quite suddenly angry with him. "Look here," I said, "who told you
  about my great-grandmother's recipes?"</p>

  <p>"Well," he fenced.</p>

  <p>"Every time we've met for a week," I said, "and we've met pretty often
  &mdash;you've given me a broad hint or so about that little secret of
  mine."</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "now the cat's out of the bag, I'll admit, yes, it is so.
  I had it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"From Pattison?"</p>

  <p>"Indirectly," he said, which I believe was lying, "yes."</p>

  <p>"Pattison," I said, "took that stuff at his own risk."</p>

  <p>He pursed his mouth and bowed.</p>

  <p>"My great-grandmother's recipes," I said, "are queer things to handle. My
  father was near making me promise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He didn't?"</p>

  <p>"No. But he warned me. He himself used one&mdash;once."</p>

  <p>"Ah!...But do you think&mdash;? Suppose&mdash;suppose there did happen to
  be one&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The things are curious documents," I said.</p>

  <p>"Even the smell of 'em... No!"</p>

  <p>But after going so far Pyecraft was resolved I should go farther. I was
  always a little afraid if I tried his patience too much he would fall on me
  suddenly and smother me. I own I was weak. But I was also annoyed with
  Pyecraft. I had got to that state of feeling for him that disposed me to say,
  "Well, <i>take</i> the risk!" The little affair of Pattison to which I have
  alluded was a different matter altogether. What it was doesn't concern us
  now, but I knew, anyhow, that the particular recipe I used then was safe. The
  rest I didn't know so much about, and, on the whole, I was inclined to doubt
  their safety pretty completely.</p>

  <p>Yet even if Pyecraft got poisoned&mdash;</p>

  <p>I must confess the poisoning of Pyecraft struck me as an immense
  undertaking.</p>

  <p>That evening I took that queer, odd-scented sandalwood box out of my safe
  and turned the rustling skins over. The gentleman who wrote the recipes for
  my great-grandmother evidently had a weakness for skins of a miscellaneous
  origin, and his handwriting was cramped to the last degree. Some of the
  things are quite unreadable to me&mdash;though my family, with its Indian
  Civil Service associations, has kept up a knowledge of Hindustani from
  generation to generation&mdash;and none are absolutely plain sailing. But I
  found the one that I knew was there soon enough, and sat on the floor by my
  safe for some time looking at it.</p>

  <p>"Look here," said I to Pyecraft next day, and snatched the slip away from
  his eager grasp.</p>

  <p>"So far as I&mdash;can make it out, this is a recipe for Loss of Weight.
  ("Ah!" said Pyecraft.) I'm not absolutely sure, but I think it's that. And if
  you take my advice you'll leave it alone. Because, you know&mdash;I blacken
  my blood in your interest, Pyecraft&mdash;my ancestors on that side were, so
  far as I can gather, a jolly queer lot. See?"</p>

  <p>"Let me try it," said Pyecraft.</p>

  <p>I leant back in my chair. My imagination made one mighty effort and fell
  flat within me. "What in Heaven's name, Pyecraft," I asked, "do you think
  you'll look like when you get thin?"</p>

  <p>He was impervious to reason. I made him promise never to say a word to me
  about his disgusting fatness again whatever happened&mdash;never, and then I
  handed him that little piece of skin.</p>

  <p>"It's nasty stuff," I said.</p>

  <p>"No matter," he said, and took it.</p>

  <p>He goggled at it. "But&mdash;but&mdash;" he said.</p>

  <p>He had just discovered that it wasn't English.</p>

  <p>"To the best of my ability," I said, "I will do you a translation."</p>

  <p>I did my best. After that we didn't speak for a fortnight. Whenever he
  approached me I frowned and motioned him away, and he respected our compact,
  but at the end of a fortnight he was as fat as ever. And then he got a word
  in.</p>

  <p>"I must speak," he said. "It isn't fair. There's something wrong. It's
  done me no good. You're not doing your great-grandmother justice."</p>

  <p>"Where's the recipe?"</p>

  <p>He produced it gingerly from his pocket-book.</p>

  <p>I ran my eye over the items. "Was the egg addled?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No. Ought it to have been?"</p>

  <p>"That," I said, "goes without saying in all my poor dear great-
  grandmother's recipes. When condition or quality is not specified you must
  get the worst. She was drastic or nothing... And there's one or two possible
  alternatives to some of these other things. You got <i>fresh</i> rattlesnake
  venom."</p>

  <p>"I got a rattlesnake from Jamrach's. It cost&mdash;it cost&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's your affair, anyhow. This last item&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know a man who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes. H'm. Well, I'll write the alternatives down. So far as I know the
  language, the spelling of this recipe is particularly atrocious. By-the-bye,
  dog here probably means pariah dog."</p>

  <p>For a month after that I saw Pyecraft constantly at the club and as fat
  and anxious as ever. He kept our treaty, but at times he broke the spirit of
  it by shaking his head despondently. Then one day in the cloakroom he said,
  "Your great-grandmother&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not a word against her," I said; and he held his peace.</p>

  <p>I could have fancied he had desisted, and I saw him one day talking to
  three new members about his fatness as though he was in search of other
  recipes. And then, quite unexpectedly, his telegram came.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Formalyn!" bawled a page-boy under my nose, and I took the telegram
  and opened it at once.</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake come.&mdash;Pyecraft."</p>

  <p>"H'm," said I, and to tell the truth I was so pleased at the
  rehabilitation of my great grandmother's reputation this evidently promised
  that I made a most excellent lunch.</p>

  <p>I got Pyecraft's address from the hall porter. Pyecraft inhabited the
  upper half of a house in Bloomsbury, and I went there so soon as I had done
  my coffee and Trappistine. I did not wait to finish my cigar.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pyecraft?" said I, at the front door.</p>

  <p>They believed he was ill; he hadn't been out for two days.</p>

  <p>"He expects me," said I, and they sent me up.</p>

  <p>I rang the bell at the lattice-door upon the landing.</p>

  <p>"He shouldn't have tried it, anyhow," I said to myself. "A man who eats
  like a pig ought to look like a pig."</p>

  <p>An obviously worthy woman, with an anxious face and a carelessly placed
  cap, came and surveyed me through the lattice.</p>

  <p>I gave my name and she let me in in a dubious fashion.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said I, as we stood together inside Pyecraft's piece of the
  landing.</p>

  <p>"'E said you was to come in if you came," she said, and regarded me,
  making no motion to show me anywhere. And then, confidentially, "'E's locked
  in, sir."</p>

  <p>"Locked in?"</p>

  <p>"Locked himself in yesterday morning and 'asn't let any one in since, sir.
  And ever and again <i>swearing</i>. Oh, my!"</p>

  <p>I stared at the door she indicated by her glances.</p>

  <p>"In there?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"What's up?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head sadly, "'E keeps on calling for vittles, sir.
  <i>'Eavy</i> vittles 'e wants. I get 'im what I can. Pork 'e's 'ad, sooit
  puddin', sossiges, noo bread. Everythink like that. Left outside, if you
  please, and me go away. 'E's eatin', sir, somethink <i>awful</i>."</p>

  <p>There came a piping bawl from inside the door: "That Formalyn?"</p>

  <p>"That you, Pyecraft?" I shouted, and went and banged the door.</p>

  <p>"Tell her to go away."</p>

  <p>I did.</p>

  <p>Then I could hear a curious pattering upon the door, almost like some one
  feeling for the handle in the dark, and Pyecraft's familiar grunts.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," I said, "she's gone."</p>

  <p>But for a long time the door didn't open.</p>

  <p>I heard the key turn. Then Pyecraft's voice said, "Come in."</p>

  <p>I turned the handle and opened the door. Naturally I expected to see
  Pyecraft.</p>

  <p>Well, you know, he wasn't there!</p>

  <p>I never had such a shock in my life. There was his sitting-room in a state
  of untidy disorder, plates and dishes among the books and writing things, and
  several chairs overturned, but Pyecraft&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It's all right, o' man; shut the door," he said, and then I discovered
  him.</p>

  <p>There he was right up close to the cornice in the corner by the door, as
  though some one had glued him to the ceiling. His face was anxious and angry.
  He panted and gesticulated. "Shut the door," he said. "If that woman gets
  hold of it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I shut the door, and went and stood away from him and stared.</p>

  <p>"If anything gives way and you tumble down," I said, "you'll break your
  neck, Pyecraft."</p>

  <p>"I wish I could," he wheezed.</p>

  <p>"A man of your age and weight getting up to kiddish gymnastics&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't," he said, and looked agonised.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," he said, and gesticulated.</p>

  <p>"How the deuce," said I, "are you holding on up there?"</p>

  <p>And then abruptly I realised that he was not holding on at all, that he
  was floating up there&mdash;just as a gas-filled bladder might have floated
  in the same position. He began a struggle to thrust himself away from the
  ceiling and to clamber down the wall to me. "It's that prescription," he
  panted, as he did so. "Your great-gran&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He took hold of a framed engraving rather carelessly as he spoke and it
  gave way, and he flew back to the ceiling again, while the picture smashed
  onto the sofa. Bump he went against the ceiling, and I knew then why he was
  all over white on the more salient curves and angles of his person. He tried
  again more carefully, coming down by way of the mantel.</p>

  <p>It was really a most extraordinary spectacle, that great, fat, apoplectic-
  looking man upside down and trying to get from the ceiling to the floor.
  "That prescription," he said. "Too successful."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Loss of weight&mdash;almost complete."</p>

  <p>And then, of course, I understood.</p>

  <p>"By Jove, Pyecraft," said I, "what you wanted was a cure for fatness! But
  you always called it weight. You would call it weight."</p>

  <p>Somehow I was extremely delighted. I quite liked Pyecraft for the time.
  "Let me help you!" I said, and took his hand and pulled him down. He kicked
  about, trying to get a foothold somewhere. It was very like holding a flag on
  a windy day.</p>

  <p>"That table," he said, pointing, "is solid mahogany and very heavy. If you
  can put me under that&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>I did, and there he wallowed about like a captive balloon, while I stood
  on his hearthrug and talked to him.</p>

  <p>I lit a cigar. "Tell me," I said, "what happened?"</p>

  <p>"I took it," he said.</p>

  <p>"How did it taste?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>beastly</i>!"</p>

  <p>I should fancy they all did. Whether one regards the ingredients or the
  probable compound or the possible results, almost all of my
  great-grandmother's remedies appear to me at least to be extraordinarily
  uninviting. For my own part&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I took a little sip first."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"And as I felt lighter and better after an hour, I decided to take the
  draught."</p>

  <p>"My dear Pyecraft!"</p>

  <p>"I held my nose," he explained. "And then I kept on getting lighter and
  lighter&mdash;and helpless, you know."</p>

  <p>He gave way to a sudden burst of passion. "What the goodness am I to
  <i>do</i>?" he said.</p>

  <p>"There's one thing pretty evident," I said, "that you mustn't do. If you
  go out of doors, you'll go up and up." I waved an arm upward. "They'd have to
  send Santos-Dumont after you to bring you down again."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it will wear off?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "I don't think you can count on that," I said.</p>

  <p>And then there was another burst of passion, and he kicked out at adjacent
  chairs and banged the floor. He behaved just as I should have expected a
  great, fat, self-indulgent man to behave under trying
  circumstances&mdash;that is to say, very badly. He spoke of me and my great-
  grandmother with an utter want of discretion.</p>

  <p>"I never asked you to take the stuff," I said.</p>

  <p>And generously disregarding the insults he was putting upon me, I sat down
  in his armchair and began to talk to him in a sober, friendly fashion.</p>

  <p>I pointed out to him that this was a trouble he had brought upon himself,
  and that it had almost an air of poetical justice. He had eaten too much.
  This he disputed, and for a time we argued the point.</p>

  <p>He became noisy and violent, so I desisted from this aspect of his lesson.
  "And then," said I, "you committed the sin of euphuism. You called it not
  Fat, which is just and inglorious, but Weight. You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted to say he recognised all that. What was he to
  <i>do</i>?</p>

  <p>I suggested he should adapt himself to his new conditions. So we came to
  the really sensible part of the business. I suggested that it would not be
  difficult for him to learn to walk about on the ceiling with his hands
  &mdash;</p>

  <p>"I can't sleep," he said.</p>

  <p>But that was no great difficulty. It was quite possible, I pointed out, to
  make a shake-up under a wire mattress, fasten the under things on with tapes,
  and have a blanket, sheet, and coverlet to button at the side. He would have
  to confide in his housekeeper, I said; and after some squabbling he agreed to
  that. (Afterwards it was quite delightful to see the beautifully matter-of-
  fact way with which the good lady took all these amazing inversions.) He
  could have a library ladder in his room, and all his meals could be laid on
  the top of his bookcase. We also hit on an ingenious device by which he could
  get to the floor whenever he wanted, which was simply to put the British
  Encyclopaedia (tenth edition) on the top of his open shelves. He just pulled
  out a couple of volumes and held on, and down he came. And we agreed there
  must be iron staples along the skirting, so that he could cling to those
  whenever he wanted to get about the room on the lower level.</p>

  <p>As we got on with the thing I found myself almost keenly interested. It
  was I who called in the housekeeper and broke matters to her, and it was I
  chiefly who fixed up the inverted bed. In fact, I spent two whole days at his
  flat. I am a handy, interfering sort of man with a screw-driver, and I made
  all sorts of ingenious adaptations for him&mdash;ran a wire to bring his
  bells within reach, turned all his electric lights up instead of down, and so
  on. The whole affair was extremely curious and interesting to me, and it was
  delightful to think of Pyecraft like some great, fat blow-fly, crawling about
  on his ceiling and clambering round the lintels of his doors from one room to
  another, and never, never, never coming to the club any more...</p>

  <p>Then, you know, my fatal ingenuity got the better of me. I was sitting by
  his fire drinking his whisky, and he was up in his favourite corner by the
  cornice, tacking a Turkey carpet to the ceiling, when the idea struck me. "By
  Jove, Pyecraft!" I said, "all this is totally unnecessary."</p>

  <p>And before I could calculate the complete consequences of my notion I
  blurted it out. "Lead underclothing," said I, and the mischief was done.</p>

  <p>Pyecraft received the thing almost in tears. "To be right ways up
  again&mdash;" he said. I gave him the whole secret before I saw where it
  would take me. "Buy sheet lead," I said, "stamp it into discs. Sew 'em all
  over your underclothes until you have enough. Have lead-soled boots, carry a
  bag of solid lead, and the thing is done! Instead of being a prisoner here
  you may go abroad again, Pyecraft; you may travel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A still happier idea came to me. "You need never fear a shipwreck. All you
  need do is just slip off some or all of your clothes, take the necessary
  amount of luggage in your hand, and float up in the air&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In his emotion he dropped the tack-hammer within an ace of my head. "By
  Jove!" he said, "I shall be able to come back to the club again."</p>

  <p>The thing pulled me up short. "By Jove!" I said faintly. "Yes. Of course
  &mdash;you will."</p>

  <p>He did. He does. There he sits behind me now, stuffing&mdash;as I live!
  &mdash;a third go of buttered tea-cake. And no one in the whole world knows
  &mdash;except his housekeeper and me&mdash;that he weighs practically
  nothing; that he is a mere boring mass of assimilatory matter, mere clouds in
  clothing, niente, nefas, the most inconsiderable of men. There he sits
  watching until I have done this writing. Then, if he can, he will waylay me.
  He will come billowing up to me...</p>

  <p>He will tell me over again all about it, how it feels, how it doesn't
  feel, how he sometimes hopes it is passing off a little. And always somewhere
  in that fat, abundant discourse he will say, "The secret's keeping, eh? If
  any one knew of it&mdash;I should be so ashamed... Makes a fellow look such a
  fool, you know. Crawling about on a ceiling and all that..."</p>

  <p>And now to elude Pyecraft, occupying, as he does, an admirable strategic
  position between me and the door.</p>

     name="story63">THE MAGIC SHOP</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> June 1903</h3>

  <p>I had seen the Magic Shop from afar several times; I had passed it once or
  twice, a shop window of alluring little objects, magic balls, magic hens,
  wonderful cones, ventriloquist dolls, the material of the basket trick, packs
  of cards that <i>looked</i> all right, and all that sort of thing, but never
  had I thought of going in until one day, almost without warning, Gip hauled
  me by my finger right up to the window, and so conducted himself that there
  was nothing for it but to take him in. I had not thought the place was there,
  to tell the truth&mdash;a modest-sized frontage in Regent Street, between the
  picture shop and the place where the chicks run about just out of patent
  incubators, but there it was sure enough. I had fancied it was down nearer
  the Circus, or round the corner in Oxford Street, or even in Holborn; always
  over the way and a little inaccessible it had been, with something of the
  mirage in its position; but here it was now quite indisputably, and the fat
  end of Gip's pointing finger made a noise upon the glass.</p>

  <p>"If I was rich," said Gip, dabbing a finger at the Disappearing Egg, "I'd
  buy myself that. And that"&mdash;which was The Crying Baby, Very Human
  &mdash;and that," which was a mystery, and called, so a neat card asserted,
  "Buy One and Astonish Your Friends."</p>

  <p>"Anything," said Gip, "will disappear under one of those cones. I have
  read about it in a book.</p>

  <p>"And there, dadda, is the Vanishing Halfpenny&mdash;, only they've put it
  this way up so's we can't see how it's done."</p>

  <p>Gip, dear boy, inherits his mother's breeding, and he did not propose to
  enter the shop or worry in any way; only, you know, quite unconsciously he
  lugged my finger doorward, and he made his interest clear.</p>

  <p>"That," he said, and pointed to the Magic Bottle.</p>

  <p>"If you had that?" I said; at which promising inquiry he looked up with a
  sudden radiance.</p>

  <p>"I could show it to Jessie," he said, thoughtful as ever of others.</p>

  <p>"It's less than a hundred days to your birthday, Gibbles," I said, and
  laid my hand on the door-handle.</p>

  <p>Gip made no answer, but his grip tightened on my finger, and so we came
  into the shop.</p>

  <p>It was no common shop this; it was a magic shop, and all the prancing
  precedence Gip would have taken in the matter of mere toys was wanting. He
  left the burthen of the conversation to me.</p>

  <p>It was a little, narrow shop, not very well lit, and the door-bell pinged
  again with a plaintive note as we closed it behind us. For a moment or so we
  were alone and could glance about us. There was a tiger in papier-mache on
  the glass case that covered the low counter&mdash;a grave, kind-eyed tiger
  that waggled his head in a methodical manner; there were several crystal
  spheres, a china hand holding magic cards, a stock of magic fish-bowls in
  various sizes, and an immodest magic hat that shamelessly displayed its
  springs. On the floor were magic mirrors; one to draw you out long and thin,
  one to swell your head and vanish your legs, and one to make you short and
  fat like a draught; and while we were laughing at these the shopman, as I
  suppose, came in.</p>

  <p>At any rate, there he was behind the counter&mdash;a curious, sallow, dark
  man, with one ear larger than the other and a chin like the toe-cap of a
  boot.</p>

  <p>"What can we have the pleasure?" he said, spreading his long, magic
  fingers on the glass case; and so with a start we were aware of him.</p>

  <p>"I want," I said, "to buy my little boy a few simple tricks."</p>

  <p>"Legerdemain?" he asked. "Mechanical? Domestic?"</p>

  <p>"Anything amusing?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Um!" said the shopman, and scratched his head for a moment as if
  thinking. Then, quite distinctly, he drew from his head a glass ball.
  "Something in this way?" he said, and held it out.</p>

  <p>The action was unexpected. I had seen the trick done at entertainments
  endless times before&mdash;it's part of the common stock of
  conjurers&mdash;but I had not expected it here.</p>

  <p>"That's good," I said, with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it?" said the shopman.</p>

  <p>Gip stretched out his disengaged hand to take this object and found merely
  a blank palm.</p>

  <p>"It's in your pocket," said the shopman, and there it was!</p>

  <p>"How much will that be?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"We make no charge for glass balls," said the shopman politely. "We get
  them,"&mdash;he picked one out of his elbow as he spoke&mdash;"free." He
  produced another from the back of his neck, and laid it beside its
  predecessor on the counter. Gip regarded his glass ball sagely, then directed
  a look of inquiry at the two on the counter, and finally brought his
  round-eyed scrutiny to the shopman, who smiled.</p>

  <p>"You may have those too," said the shopman, "and, if you <i>don't</i>
  mind, one from my mouth. <i>So</i>!"</p>

  <p>Gip counselled me mutely for a moment, and then in a profound silence put
  away the four balls, resumed my reassuring finger, and nerved himself for the
  next event.</p>

  <p>"We get all our smaller tricks in that way," the shopman remarked.</p>

  <p>I laughed in the manner of one who subscribes to a jest. "Instead of going
  to the wholesale shop," I said. "Of course, it's cheaper."</p>

  <p>"In a way," the shopman said. "Though we pay in the end. But not so
  heavily&mdash;as people suppose... Our larger tricks, and our daily
  provisions and all the other things we want, we get out of that hat... And
  you know, sir, if you'll excuse my saying it, there <i>isn't</i> a wholesale
  shop, not for Genuine Magic goods, sir. I don't know if you noticed our
  inscription&mdash;the Genuine Magic shop." He drew a business-card from his
  cheek and handed it to me. "Genuine," he said, with his finger on the word,
  and added, "There is absolutely no deception, sir."</p>

  <p>He seemed to be carrying out the joke pretty thoroughly, I thought.</p>

  <p>He turned to Gip with a smile of remarkable affability. "You, you know,
  are the Right Sort of Boy."</p>

  <p>I was surprised at his knowing that, because, in the interests of
  discipline, we keep it rather a secret even at home; but Gip received it in
  unflinching silence, keeping a steadfast eye on him.</p>

  <p>"It's only the Right Sort of Boy gets through that doorway."</p>

  <p>And, as if by way of illustration, there came a rattling at the door, and
  a squeaking little voice could be faintly heard. "Nyar! I <i>warn</i> 'a go
  in there, dadda, I <i>warn</i> 'a go in there. Ny-a-a-ah!" and then the
  accents of a down-trodden parent, urging consolations and propitiations.
  "It's locked, Edward," he said.</p>

  <p>"But it isn't," said I.</p>

  <p>"It is, sir," said the shopman, "always&mdash;for that sort of child," and
  as he spoke we had a glimpse of the other youngster, a little, white face,
  pallid from sweet-eating and over-sapid food, and distorted by evil passions,
  a ruthless little egotist, pawing at the enchanted pane. "It's no good, sir,"
  said the shopman, as I moved, with my natural helpfulness, doorward, and
  presently the spoilt child was carried off howling.</p>

  <p>"How do you manage that?" I said, breathing a little more freely.</p>

  <p>"Magic!" said the shopman, with a careless wave of the hand, and behold!
  sparks of coloured fire flew out of his fingers and vanished into the shadows
  of the shop.</p>

  <p>"You were saying," he said, addressing himself to Gip, "before you came
  in, that you would like one of our 'Buy One and Astonish your Friends'
  boxes?"</p>

  <p>Gip, after a gallant effort, said "Yes."</p>

  <p>"It's in your pocket."</p>

  <p>And leaning over the counter&mdash;he really had an extraordinarily long
  body&mdash;this amazing person produced the article in the customary
  conjurer's manner. "Paper," he said, and took a sheet out of the empty hat
  with the springs; "string," and behold his mouth was a string-box, from which
  he drew an unending thread, which when he had tied his parcel he bit
  off&mdash;and, it seemed to me, swallowed the ball of string. And then he lit
  a candle at the nose of one of the ventriloquist's dummies, stuck one of his
  fingers (which had become sealing-wax red) into the flame, and so sealed the
  parcel. "Then there was the Disappearing Egg," he remarked, and produced one
  from within my coat-breast and packed it, and also The Crying Baby, Very
  Human. I handed each parcel to Gip as it was ready, and he clasped them to
  his chest.</p>

  <p>He said very little, but his eyes were eloquent; the clutch of his arms
  was eloquent. He was the playground of unspeakable emotions. These, you know,
  were REAL Magics. Then, with a start, I discovered something moving about in
  my hat&mdash;something soft and jumpy. I whipped it off, and a ruffled pigeon
  &mdash;no doubt a confederate&mdash;dropped out and ran on the counter, and
  went, I fancy, into a cardboard box behind the papier-mache tiger.</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut!" said the shopman, dexterously relieving me of my headdress;
  "careless bird, and&mdash;as I live&mdash;nesting!"</p>

  <p>He shook my hat, and shook out into his extended hand two or three eggs, a
  large marble, a watch, about half-a-dozen of the inevitable glass balls, and
  then crumpled, crinkled paper, more and more and more, talking all the time
  of the way in which people neglect to brush their hats <i>inside</i> as well
  as out, politely, of course, but with a certain personal application. "All
  sorts of things accumulate, sir... Not <i>you</i>, of course, in
  particular... Nearly every customer... Astonishing what they carry about with
  them..." The crumpled paper rose and billowed on the counter more and more
  and more, until he was nearly hidden from us, until he was altogether hidden,
  and still his voice went on and on. "We none of us know what the fair
  semblance of a human being may conceal, sir. Are we all then no better than
  brushed exteriors, whited sepulchres&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His voice stopped&mdash;exactly like when you hit a neighbour's gramophone
  with a well-aimed brick, the same instant silence, and the rustle of the
  paper stopped, and everything was still...</p>

  <p>"Have you done with my hat?" I said, after an interval.</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>I stared at Gip, and Gip stared at me, and there were our distortions in
  the magic mirrors, looking very rum, and grave, and quiet...</p>

  <p>"I think we'll go now," I said. "Will you tell me how much all this comes
  to?...</p>

  <p>"I say," I said, on a rather louder note, "I want the bill; and my hat,
  please."</p>

  <p>It might have been a sniff from behind the paper pile...</p>

  <p>"Let's look behind the counter, Gip," I said. "He's making fun of us."</p>

  <p>I led Gip round the head-wagging tiger, and what do you think there was
  behind the counter? No one at all! Only my hat on the floor, and a common
  conjurer's lop-eared white rabbit lost in meditation, and looking as stupid
  and crumpled as only a conjurer's rabbit can do. I resumed my hat, and the
  rabbit lolloped a lollop or so out of my way.</p>

  <p>"Dadda!" said Gip, in a guilty whisper.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Gip?" said I.</p>

  <p>"I <i>do</i> like this shop, dadda."</p>

  <p>"So should I," I said to myself, "if the counter wouldn't suddenly extend
  itself to shut one off from the door." But I didn't call Gip's attention to
  that. "Pussy!" he said, with a hand out to the rabbit as it came lolloping
  past us; "Pussy, do Gip a magic!" and his eyes followed it as it squeezed
  through a door I had certainly not remarked a moment before. Then this door
  opened wider, and the man with one ear larger than the other appeared again.
  He was smiling still, but his eye met mine with something between amusement
  and defiance. "You'd like to see our show-room, sir," he said, with an
  innocent suavity. Gip tugged my finger forward. I glanced at the counter and
  met the shopman's eye again. I was beginning to think the magic just a little
  too genuine. "We haven't <i>very</i> much time," I said. But somehow we were
  inside the show-room before I could finish that.</p>

  <p>"All goods of the same quality," said the shopman, rubbing his flexible
  hands together, "and that is the Best. Nothing in the place that isn't
  genuine Magic, and warranted thoroughly rum. Excuse me, sir!"</p>

  <p>I felt him pull at something that clung to my coat-sleeve, and then I saw
  he held a little, wriggling red demon by the tail&mdash;the little creature
  bit and fought and tried to get at his hand&mdash;and in a moment he tossed
  it carelessly behind a counter. No doubt the thing was only an image of
  twisted indiarubber, but for the moment&mdash;! And his gesture was exactly
  that of a man who handles some petty biting bit of vermin. I glanced at Gip,
  but Gip was looking at a magic rocking-horse. I was glad he hadn't seen the
  thing. "I say," I said, in an undertone, and indicating Gip and the red demon
  with my eyes, "you haven't many things like <i>that</i> about, have you?"</p>

  <p>"None of ours! Probably brought it with you," said the shopman&mdash;also
  in an undertone, and with a more dazzling smile than ever. "Astonishing what
  people <i>will</i> carry about with them unawares!" And then to Gip, "Do you
  see anything you fancy here?"</p>

  <p>There were many things that Gip fancied there.</p>

  <p>He turned to this astonishing tradesman with mingled confidence and
  respect. "Is that a Magic Sword?" he said.</p>

  <p>"A Magic Toy Sword. It neither bends, breaks, nor cuts the fingers. It
  renders the bearer invincible in battle against any one under eighteen.
  Half-a-crown to seven and sixpence, according to size. These panoplies on
  cards are for juvenile knights-errant and very useful&mdash;shield of safety,
  sandals of swiftness, helmet of invisibility."</p>

  <p>"Oh, daddy!" gasped Gip.</p>

  <p>I tried to find out what they cost, but the shopman did not heed me. He
  had got Gip now; he had got him away from my finger; he had embarked upon the
  exposition of all his confounded stock, and nothing was going to stop him.
  Presently I saw with a qualm of distrust and something very like jealousy
  that Gip had hold of this person's finger as usually he has hold of mine. No
  doubt the fellow was interesting, I thought, and had an interestingly faked
  lot of stuff, really <i>good</i> faked stuff, still&mdash;</p>

  <p>I wandered after them, saying very little, but keeping an eye on this
  prestidigital fellow. After all, Gip was enjoying it. And no doubt when the
  time came to go we should be able to go quite easily.</p>

  <p>It was a long, rambling place, that show-room, a gallery broken up by
  stands and stalls and pillars, with archways leading off to other
  departments, in which the queerest-looking assistants loafed and stared at
  one, and with perplexing mirrors and curtains. So perplexing, indeed, were
  these that I was presently unable to make out the door by which we had
  come.</p>

  <p>The shopman showed Gip magic trains that ran without steam or clockwork,
  just as you set the signals, and then some very, very valuable boxes of
  soldiers that all came alive directly you took off the lid and said&mdash;. I
  myself haven't a very quick ear and it was a tongue-twisting sound, but Gip
  &mdash;he has his mother's ear&mdash;got it in no time. "Bravo!" said the
  shopman, putting the men back into the box unceremoniously and handing it to
  Gip. "Now," said the shopman, and in a moment Gip had made them all alive
  again.</p>

  <p>"You'll take that box?" asked the shopman.</p>

  <p>"We'll take that box," said I, "unless you charge its full value. In which
  case it would need a Trust Magnate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dear heart! <i>No</i>!" and the shopman swept the little men back again,
  shut the lid, waved the box in the air, and there it was, in brown paper,
  tied up and&mdash;<i>with Gip's full name and address on the paper!</i></p>

  <p>The shopman laughed at my amazement.</p>

  <p>"This is the genuine magic," he said. "The real thing."</p>

  <p>"It's a little too genuine for my taste," I said again.</p>

  <p>After that he fell to showing Gip tricks, odd tricks, and still odder the
  way they were done. He explained them, he turned them inside out, and there
  was the dear little chap nodding his busy bit of a head in the sagest
  manner.</p>

  <p>I did not attend as well as I might. "Hey, presto!" said the Magic
  Shopman, and then would come the clear, small "Hey, presto!" of the boy. But
  I was distracted by other things. It was being borne in upon me just how
  tremendously rum this place was; it was, so to speak, inundated by a sense of
  rumness. There was something a little rum about the fixtures even, about the
  ceiling, about the floor, about the casually distributed chairs. I had a
  queer feeling that whenever I wasn't looking at them straight they went
  askew, and moved about, and played a noiseless puss-in-the-corner behind my
  back. And the cornice had a serpentine design with masks&mdash;masks
  altogether too expressive for proper plaster.</p>

  <p>Then abruptly my attention was caught by one of the odd-looking
  assistants. He was some way off and evidently unaware of my presence&mdash;I
  saw a sort of three-quarter length of him over a pile of toys and through an
  arch&mdash;and, you know, he was leaning against a pillar in an idle sort of
  way doing the most horrid things with his features! The particular horrid
  thing he did was with his nose. He did it just as though he was idle and
  wanted to amuse himself. First of all it was a short, blobby nose, and then
  suddenly he shot it out like a telescope, and then out it flew and became
  thinner and thinner until it was like a long, red, flexible whip. Like a
  thing in a nightmare it was! He flourished it about and flung it forth as a
  fly-fisher flings his line.</p>

  <p>My instant thought was that Gip mustn't see him. I turned about, and there
  was Gip quite preoccupied with the shopman, and thinking no evil. They were
  whispering together and looking at me. Gip was standing on a little stool,
  and the shopman was holding a sort of big drum in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Hide and seek, dadda!" cried Gip. "You're He!"</p>

  <p>And before I could do anything to prevent it, the shopman had clapped the
  big drum over him. I saw what was up directly. "Take that off," I cried,
  "this instant! You'll frighten the boy. Take it off!"</p>

  <p>The shopman with the unequal ears did so without a word, and held the big
  cylinder towards me to show its emptiness. And the little stool was vacant!
  In that instant my boy had utterly disappeared?...</p>

  <p>You know, perhaps, that sinister something that comes like a hand out of
  the unseen and grips your heart about. You know it takes your common self
  away and leaves you tense and deliberate, neither slow nor hasty, neither
  angry nor afraid. So it was with me.</p>

  <p>I came up to this grinning shopman and kicked his stool aside.</p>

  <p>"Stop this folly!" I said. "Where is my boy?"</p>

  <p>"You see," he said, still displaying the drum's interior, "there is no
  deception&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>I put out my hand to grip him, and he eluded me by a dexterous movement. I
  snatched again, and he turned from me and pushed open a door to escape.
  "Stop!" I said, and he laughed, receding. I leapt after him&mdash;into utter
  darkness.</p>

  <p><i>Thud!</i></p>

  <p>"Lor' bless my 'eart! I didn't see you coming, sir!"</p>

  <p>I was in Regent Street, and I had collided with a decent-looking working
  man; and a yard away, perhaps, and looking a little perplexed with himself,
  was Gip. There was some sort of apology, and then Gip had turned and come to
  me with a bright little smile, as though for a moment he had missed me.</p>

  <p>And he was carrying four parcels in his arm!</p>

  <p>He secured immediate possession of my finger.</p>

  <p>For the second I was rather at a loss. I stared round to see the door of
  the magic shop, and, behold, it was not there! There was no door, no shop,
  nothing, only the common pilaster between the shop where they sell pictures
  and the window with the chicks!...</p>

  <p>I did the only thing possible in that mental tumult; I walked straight to
  the kerbstone and held up my umbrella for a cab.</p>

  <p>"'Ansoms," said Gip, in a note of culminating exultation.</p>

  <p>I helped him in, recalled my address with an effort, and got in also.
  Something unusual proclaimed itself in my tail-coat pocket, and I felt and
  discovered a glass ball. With a petulant expression I flung it into the
  street.</p>

  <p>Gip said nothing.</p>

  <p>For a space neither of us spoke.</p>

  <p>"Dada!" said Gip, at last, "that WAS a proper shop!"</p>

  <p>I came round with that to the problem of just how the whole thing had
  seemed to him. He looked completely undamaged&mdash;so far, good; he was
  neither scared nor unhinged, he was simply tremendously satisfied with the
  afternoon's entertainment, and there in his arms were the four parcels.</p>

  <p>Confound it! what could be in them?</p>

  <p>"Um!" I said. "Little boys can't go to shops like that every day."</p>

  <p>He received this with his usual stoicism, and for a moment I was sorry I
  was his father and not his mother, and so couldn't suddenly there, coram
  publico, in our hansom, kiss him. After all, I thought, the thing wasn't so
  very bad.</p>

  <p>But it was only when we opened the parcels that I really began to be
  reassured. Three of them contained boxes of soldiers, quite ordinary lead
  soldiers, but of so good a quality as to make Gip altogether forget that
  originally these parcels had been Magic Tricks of the only genuine sort, and
  the fourth contained a kitten, a little living white kitten, in excellent
  health and appetite and temper.</p>

  <p>I saw this unpacking with a sort of provisional relief. I hung about in
  the nursery for quite an unconscionable time...</p>

  <p>That happened six months ago. And now I am beginning to believe it is all
  right. The kitten had only the magic natural to all kittens, and the soldiers
  seem as steady a company as any colonel could desire. And Gip&mdash;?</p>

  <p>The intelligent parent will understand that I have to go cautiously with
  Gip.</p>

  <p>But I went so far as this one day. I said, "How would you like your
  soldiers to come alive, Gip, and march about by themselves?"</p>

  <p>"Mine do," said Gip. "I just have to say a word I know before I open the
  lid."</p>

  <p>"Then they march about alone?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>quite</i>, dadda. I shouldn't like them if they didn't do
  that."</p>

  <p>I displayed no unbecoming surprise, and since then I have taken occasion
  to drop in upon him once or twice, unannounced, when the soldiers were about,
  but so far I have never discovered them performing in anything like a magical
  manner.</p>

  <p>It's so difficult to tell.</p>

  <p>There's also a question of finance. I have an incurable habit of paying
  bills. I have been up and down Regent Street several times, looking for that
  shop. I am inclined to think, indeed, that in that matter honour is
  satisfied, and that, since Gip's name and address are known to them, I may
  very well leave it to these people, whoever they may be, to send in their
  bill in their own time.</p>

     name="story64">THE LAND IRONCLADS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, December 1903</h3>

  <h2>I</h2>

  <p>The young lieutenant lay beside the war correspondent and admired the
  idyllic calm of the enemy's lines through his field-glass.</p>

  <p>"So far as I can see," he said, at last, "one man."</p>

  <p>"What's he doing?" asked the war correspondent.</p>

  <p>"Field-glass at us," said the young lieutenant</p>

  <p>"And this is war!"</p>

  <p>"No," said the young lieutenant; "it's Bloch."</p>

  <p>"The game's a draw."</p>

  <p>"No! They've got to win or else they lose. A draw's a win for our
  side."</p>

  <p>They had discussed the political situation fifty times or so, and the war
  correspondent was weary of it. He stretched out his limbs. "Aaai s'pose it
  <i>is</i>!" he yawned.</p>

  <p>"<i>Flut!</i>"</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>"Shot at us."</p>

  <p>The war correspondent shifted to a slightly lower position. "No one shot
  at him," he complained.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if they think we shall get so bored we shall go home?"</p>

  <p>The war correspondent made no reply.</p>

  <p>"There's the harvest, of course..."</p>

  <p>They had been there a month. Since the first brisk movements after the
  declaration of war things had gone slower and slower, until it seemed as
  though the whole machine of events must have run down. To begin with, they
  had had almost a scampering time; the invader had come across the frontier on
  the very dawn of the war in half-a-dozen parallel columns behind a cloud of
  cyclists and cavalry, with a general air of coming straight on the capital,
  and the defender horsemen had held him up, and peppered him and forced him to
  open out to outflank, and had then bolted to the next position in the most
  approved style, for a couple of days, until in the afternoon, bump! they had
  the invader against their prepared lines of defense. He did not suffer so
  much as had been hoped and expected: he was coming on, it seemed with his
  eyes open, his scouts winded the guns, and down he sat at once without the
  shadow of an attack and began grubbing trenches for himself, as though he
  meant to sit down there to the very end of time. He was slow, but much more
  wary than the world had been led to expect, and he kept convoys tucked in and
  shielded his slow marching infantry sufficiently well to prevent any heavy
  adverse scoring.</p>

  <p>"But he ought to attack," the young lieutenant had insisted.</p>

  <p>"He'll attack us at dawn, somewhere along the lines. You'll get the
  bayonets coming into the trenches just about when you can see," the war
  correspondent had held until a week ago.</p>

  <p>The young lieutenant winked when he said that.</p>

  <p>When one early morning the men the defenders sent to lie out five hundred
  yards before the trenches, with a view to the unexpected emptying of
  magazines into any night attack, gave way to causeless panic and blazed away
  at nothing for ten minutes, the war correspondent understood the meaning of
  that wink.</p>

  <p>"What would you do if you were the enemy?" said the war correspondent,
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>"If I had men like I've got now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Take those trenches."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;dodges! Crawl out half-way at night before moonrise and get into
  touch with the chaps we send out. Blaze at 'em if they tried to shift, and so
  bag some of 'em in the daylight. Learn that patch of ground by heart, lie all
  day in squatty holes, and come on nearer next night. There's a bit over
  there, lumpy ground, where they could get across to rushing
  distance&mdash;easy. In a night or so. It would be a mere game for our
  fellows; it's what they're made for... Guns? Shrapnel and stuff wouldn't stop
  good men who meant business."</p>

  <p>"Why don't <i>they</i> do that?"</p>

  <p>"Their men aren't brutes enough: that's the trouble. They're a crowd of
  devitalized townsmen, and that's the truth of the matter' They're clerks,
  they're factory hands, they're students, they're civilized men. They can
  write, they can talk, they can make and do all sorts of things, but they're
  poor amateurs at war. They've got no physical staying power, and that's the
  whole thing. They've never slept in the open one night in their lives;
  they've never drunk anything but the purest water-company water; they've
  never gone short of three meals a day since they left their feeding-bottles.
  Half their cavalry never cocked leg over horse till it enlisted six months
  ago. They ride their horses as though they were bicycles&mdash;you watch 'em!
  They're fools at the game, and they know it. Our boys of fourteen can give
  their grown men points... Very well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The war correspondent mused on his face with his nose between his
  knuckles.</p>

  <p>"If a decent civilization," he said, "cannot produce better men for war
  than&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped with belated politeness.</p>

  <p>"I mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Than our open-air life," said the young lieutenant, politely.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said the war correspondent. "Then civilization has to
  stop."</p>

  <p>"It looks like it," the young lieutenant admitted.</p>

  <p>"Civilization has science, you know," said the war correspondent. "It
  invented and it makes the rifles and guns and things you use."</p>

  <p>"Which our nice healthy hunters and stockmen and so on, rowdy-dowdy
  cowpunchers and negro-whackers, can use ten times better than&mdash;<i>What's
  that?</i>"</p>

  <p>"What?" said the war correspondent, and then seeing his companion busy
  with his field-glass he produced his own: "Where?" said the war
  correspondent, sweeping the enemy's lines.</p>

  <p>"It's nothing" said the young lieutenant, still looking.</p>

  <p>"What's nothing?"</p>

  <p>The young lieutenant put down his glass and pointed. "I thought I saw
  something there, behind the stems of those trees. Something black. What it
  was I don't know."</p>

  <p>The war correspondent tried to get even by intense scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't anything" said the young lieutenant, rolling over to regard the
  darkling evening sky, and generalized: "There never will be anything any more
  for ever. Unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The war correspondent looked inquiry.</p>

  <p>"They may get their stomachs wrong, or something&mdash;-living without
  proper drains."</p>

  <p>A sound of bugles came from the tents behind. The war correspondent slid
  backward down the sand and stood up. "Boom!" came from somewhere far away to
  the left. "Halloa!" he said, hesitated, and crawled back to peer again.
  "Firing at this time is jolly bad manners."</p>

  <p>The young lieutenant was incommunicative again for a space.</p>

  <p>Then he pointed to the distant clump of trees again. "One of our big guns.
  They were firing at that." he said.</p>

  <p>"The thing that wasn't anything?"</p>

  <p>"Something over there, anyhow."</p>

  <p>Both men were silent, peering through their glasses for a space. "Just
  when it's twilight," the lieutenant complained. He stood up.</p>

  <p>"I might stay here a bit," said the war correspondent.</p>

  <p>The lieutenant shook his head. "There is nothing to see," he apologized,
  and then went down to where his little squad of sun-brown, loose-limbed men
  had been yarning in the trench. The war correspondent stood up also, glanced
  for a moment at the business-like bustle below him, gave perhaps twenty
  seconds to those enigmatical trees again, then turned his face toward the
  camp.</p>

  <p>He found himself wondering whether his editor would consider the story of
  how somebody thought he saw something black behind a clump of trees, and how
  a gun was fired at this illusion by somebody else, too trivial for public
  consultation.</p>

  <p>"It's the only gleam of a shadow of interest," said the war correspondent,
  "for ten whole days."</p>

  <p>"No," he said, presently; "I'll write that other article, 'Is War Played
  Out?'"</p>

  <p>He surveyed the darkling lines in perspective, the tangle of trenches one
  behind another, one commanding another, which the defender had made ready.
  The shadows and mists swallowed up their receding contours, and here and
  there a lantern gleamed, and here and there knots of men were busy about
  small fires.</p>

  <p>"No troops on earth could do it," he said...</p>

  <p>He was depressed. He believed that there were other things in life better
  worth having than proficiency in war; he believed that in the heart of
  civilization, for all its stresses, its crushing concentrations of forces,
  its injustice and suffering, there lay something that might be the hope of
  the world, and the idea that any people by living in the open air, hunting
  perpetually, losing touch with books and art and all the things that
  intensify life, might hope to resist and break that great development to the
  end of time, jarred on his civilized soul.</p>

  <p>Apt to his thought came a file of defender soldiers and passed him in the
  gleam of a swinging lamp that marked the way.</p>

  <p>He glanced at their red-lit faces, and one shone out for a moment, a
  common type of face in the defender's ranks: ill-shaped nose, sensuous lips,
  bright clear eyes full of alert cunning, slouch hat cocked on one side and
  adorned with the peacock's plume of the rustic Don Juan turned soldier, a
  hard brown skin, a sinewy frame, an open, tireless stride, and a master's
  grip on the rifle.</p>

  <p>The war correspondent returned their salutations and went on his way.</p>

  <p>"Louts," he whispered. "Cunning, elementary louts. And they are going to
  beat the townsmen at the game of war!"</p>

  <p>From the red glow among the nearer tents came first one and then half-a-
  dozen hearty voices, bawling in a drawling unison the words of a particularly
  slab and sentimental patriotic song.</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>go</i> it!" muttered the war correspondent, bitterly.</p><br>

  <h2>II</h2>

  <p>It was opposite the trenches called after Hackbone's Hut that the battle
  began. There the ground stretched broad and level between the lines, with
  scarcely shelter for a lizard, and it seemed to the startled, just awakened
  men who came crowding into the trenches that this was one more proof of that
  green inexperience of the enemy of which they had heard so much. The war
  correspondent would not believe his ears at first, and swore that he and the
  war artist, who, still imperfectly roused, was trying to put on his boots by
  the light of a match held in his hand, were the victims of a common illusion.
  Then, after putting his head in a bucket of cold water, his intelligence came
  back as he towelled. He listened. "Gollys!" he said; "that's something more
  than scare firing this time. It's like ten thousand carts on a bridge of
  tin."</p>

  <p>There came a sort of enrichment to that steady uproar. "Machine-guns!"</p>

  <p>Then, "Guns!"</p>

  <p>The artist, with one boot on, thought to look at his watch, and went to it
  hopping.</p>

  <p>"Half an hour from dawn," he said. "You were right about their attacking,
  after all..."</p>

  <p>The war correspondent came out of the tent, verifying the presence of
  chocolate in his pocket as he did so. He had to halt for a moment or so until
  his eyes were toned down to the night a little. "Pitch!" he said. He stood
  for a space to season his eyes before he felt justified in striking out for a
  black gap among the adjacent tents. The artist coming out behind him fell
  over a tent-rope. It was half-past two o'clock in the morning of the darkest
  night in time, and against a sky of dull black silk the enemy was talking
  searchlights, a wild jabber of searchlights. "He's trying to blind our
  riflemen," said the war correspondent with a flash, and waited for the artist
  and then set off with a sort of discreet haste again. "Whoa!" he said,
  presently. "Ditches!"</p>

  <p>They stopped.</p>

  <p>"It's the confounded searchlights," said the war correspondent.</p>

  <p>They saw lanterns going to and fro, near by, and men falling in to march
  down to the trenches. They were for following them, and then the artist began
  to feel his night eyes. "If we scramble this," he said, "and it's only a
  drain, there's a clear run up to the ridge." And that way they took. Lights
  came and went in the tents behind, as the men turned out, and ever and again
  they came to broken ground and staggered and stumbled. But in a little while
  they drew near the crest. Something that sounded like the impact of a very
  important railway accident happened in the air above them, and the shrapnel
  bullets seethed about them like a sudden handful of hail. "Right-ho!" said
  the war correspondent, and soon they judged they had come to the crest and
  stood in the midst of a world of great darkness and frantic glares, whose
  principal fact was sound.</p>

  <p>Right and left of them and all about them was the uproar, an army-full of
  magazine fire, at first chaotic and monstrous and then, eked out by little
  flashes and gleams and suggestions, taking the beginnings of a shape. It
  looked to the war correspondent as though the enemy must have attacked in
  line and with his whole force&mdash;in which case he was either being or was
  already annihilated.</p>

  <p>"Dawn and the dead," he said, with his instinct for headlines. He said
  this to himself, but afterwards, by means of shouting, he conveyed an idea to
  the artist.</p>

  <p>"They must have meant it for a surprise," he said.</p>

  <p>It was remarkable how the firing kept on. After a time he began to
  perceive a sort of rhythm in this inferno of noise. It would
  decline&mdash;decline perceptibly, droop towards something that was
  comparatively a pause&mdash;a pause of inquiry. "Aren't you all dead yet?"
  this pause seemed to say. The flickering fringe of rifle-flashes would become
  attenuated and broken, and the whack-bang of the enemy's big guns two miles
  away there would come up out of the deeps. Then suddenly, east or west of
  them, something would startle the rifles to a frantic outbreak again.</p>

  <p>The war correspondent taxed his brain for some theory of conflict that
  would account for this, and was suddenly aware that the artist and he were
  vividly Illuminated. He could see the ridge on which they stood and before
  them in black outline a file of riflemen hurrying down towards the nearer
  trenches. It became visible that a light rain was falling, and farther away
  towards the enemy was a clear space with men&mdash;"our men?"&mdash;running
  across it in disorder. He saw one of those men throw up his hands and drop.
  And something else black and shining loomed up on the edge of the
  beam-coruscating flashes; and behind it and far away a calm, white eye
  regarded the world. "Whit, whit, whit," sang something in the air, and then
  the artist was running for cover, with the war correspondent behind him. Bang
  came shrapnel, bursting close at hand as it seemed, and our two men were
  lying flat in a dip in the ground, and the light and everything had gone
  again, leaving a vast note of interrogation upon the night.</p>

  <p>The war correspondent came within bawling range. "What the deuce was it?
  Shooting our men down!"</p>

  <p>"Black," said the artist, "and like a fort. Not two hundred yards from the
  first trench."</p>

  <p>He sought for comparisons in his mind. "Something between a big blockhouse
  and a giant's dish-cover," he said.</p>

  <p>"And they were running!" said the war correspondent.</p>

  <p>"<i>You'd</i> run if a thing like that, searchlight to help it, turned up
  like a prowling nightmare in the middle of the night."</p>

  <p>They crawled to what they judged the edge of the dip and lay regarding the
  unfathomable dark. For a space they could distinguish nothing, and then a
  sudden convergence of the searchlights of both sides brought the strange
  thing out again.</p>

  <p>In that flickering pallor it had the effect of a large and clumsy black
  insect, an insect the size of an ironclad cruiser, crawling obliquely to the
  first line of trenches and firing shots out of portholes in its side. And on
  its carcass the bullets must have been battering with more than the
  passionate violence of hail on a roof of tin.</p>

  <p>Then in the twinkling of an eye the curtain of the dark had fallen again
  and the monster had vanished, but the crescendo of musketry marked its
  approach to the trenches.</p>

  <p>They were beginning to talk about the thing to each other, when a flying
  bullet kicked dirt into the artist's face, and they, decided abruptly to
  crawl down into the cover of the trenches. They had got down with an
  unobtrusive persistence into the second line, before the dawn had grown clear
  enough for anything to be seen. They found themselves in a crowd of expectant
  riflemen, all noisily arguing about what would happen next. The enemy's
  contrivance had done execution upon the outlying men, it seemed, but they did
  not believe it would do any more. "Come the day and we'll capture the lot of
  them," said a burly soldier.</p>

  <p>"Them?" said the war correspondent.</p>

  <p>"They say there's a regular string of 'em, crawling along the front of our
  lines... Who cares?"</p>

  <p>The darkness filtered away so imperceptibly that at no moment could one
  declare decisively that one could see. The searchlights ceased to sweep
  hither and thither. The enemy's monsters were dubious patches of darkness
  upon the dark, and then no longer dubious, and so they crept out into
  distinctness. The war correspondent, munching chocolate absent-mindedly,
  beheld at last a spacious picture of battle under the cheerless sky, whose
  central focus was an array of fourteen or fifteen huge clumsy shapes lying in
  perspective on the very edge of the first line of trenches, at intervals of
  perhaps three hundred yards, and evidently firing down upon the crowded
  riflemen. They were so close in that the defender's guns had ceased, and only
  the first line of trenches was in action.</p>

  <p>The second line commanded the first, and as the light grew the war
  correspondent could make out the riflemen who were fighting these monsters,
  crouched in knots and crowds behind the transverse banks that crossed the
  trenches against the eventuality of an enfilade. The trenches close to the
  big machines were empty save for the crumpled suggestions of dead and wounded
  men; the defenders had been driven right and left as soon as the prow of this
  land ironclad had loomed up over the front of the trench. He produced his
  field-glass, and was immediately a centre of inquiry from the soldiers about
  him.</p>

  <p>They wanted to look, they asked questions, and after he had announced that
  the men across the traverses seemed unable to advance or retreat, and were
  crouching under cover rather than fighting, he found it advisable to loan his
  glasses to a burly and incredulous corporal. He heard a strident voice, and
  found a lean and sallow soldier at his back talking to the artist.</p>

  <p>"There's chaps down there caught," the man was saying. "If they retreat
  they got to expose themselves, and the fire's too straight..."</p>

  <p>"They aren't firing much, but every shot's a hit."</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"The chaps in that thing. The men who're coming up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Coming up where?"</p>

  <p>"We're evacuating them trenches where we can. Our chaps are coming back up
  the zigzags... No end of 'em hit... But when we get clear our turn'll come.
  Rather! These things won't be able to cross a trench or get into it; and
  before they can get back our guns'll smash 'em up. Smash 'em right up. See?"
  A brightness came into his eyes. "Then we'll have a go at the beggar inside,"
  he said...</p>

  <p>The war correspondent thought for a moment, trying to realize the idea.
  Then he set himself to recover his field-glasses from the burly
  corporal...</p>

  <p>The daylight was getting clearer now. The clouds were lifting, and a gleam
  of lemon-yellow amidst the level masses to the east portended sunrise. He
  looked again at the land ironclad. As he saw it in the bleak grey dawn, lying
  obliquely upon the slope and on the very lip of the foremost trench, the
  suggestion of a stranded vessel was very great indeed. It might have been
  from eighty to a hundred feet long&mdash;it was about two hundred and fifty
  yards away&mdash;its vertical side was ten feet high or so, smooth for that
  height, and then with a complex patterning under the eaves of its flattish
  turtle cover. This patterning was a close interlacing of portholes, rifle
  barrels, and telescope tubes&mdash;-sham and real&mdash;-indistinguishable
  one from the other. The thing had come into such a position as to enfilade
  the trench, which was empty now, so far as he could see, except for two or
  three crouching knots of men and the tumbled dead. Behind it, across the
  plain, it had scored the grass with a train of linked impressions, like the
  dotted tracings sea-things leave in sand. Left and right of that track dead
  men and wounded men were scattered&mdash;men it had picked off as they fled
  back from their advanced positions in the searchlight glare from the
  invader's lines. And now it lay with its head projecting a little over the
  trench it had won, as if it were a single sentient thing planning the next
  phase of its attack...</p>

  <p>He lowered his glasses and took a more comprehensive view of the
  situation. These creatures of the night had evidently won the first line of
  trenches and the fight had come to a pause. In the increasing light he could
  make out by a stray shot or a chance exposure that the defender's marksmen
  were lying thick in the second and third line of trenches up towards the low
  crest of the position, and in such of the zigzags as gave them a chance of a
  converging fire. The men about him were talking of guns. "We're in the line
  of the big guns at the crest but they'll soon shift one to pepper them," the
  lean man said, reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"Whup," said the corporal:</p>

  <p>"Bang! bang! bang! Whir-r-r-r-r!" It was a sort of nervous jump, and all
  the rifles were going off by themselves. The war correspondent found himself
  and the artist, two idle men crouching behind a line of preoccupied backs, of
  industrious men discharging magazines. The monster had moved. It continued to
  move regardless of the hail that splashed its skin with bright new specks of
  lead. It was singing a mechanical little ditty to itself, "Tuf-tuf, tuf-tuf,
  tuf-tuf," and squirting out little jets of steam behind. It had humped itself
  up, as a limpet does before it crawls; it had lifted its skirt and displayed
  along the length of it&mdash;<i>feet</i>! They were thick, stumpy feet,
  between knobs and buttons in shape&mdash;flat, broad things, reminding one of
  the feet of elephants or the legs of caterpillars; and then, as the skirt
  rose higher, the war correspondent, scrutinizing the thing through his
  glasses again, saw that these feet hung, as it were, on the rims of wheels.
  His thoughts whirled back to Victoria Street, Westminster, and he saw himself
  in the piping times of peace, seeking matter for an interview.</p>

  <p>"Mr.&mdash;Mr. Diplock," he said; "and he called them Pedrails...Fancy
  meeting them here!"</p>

  <p>The marksman beside him raised his head and shoulders in a speculative
  mood to fire more certainly&mdash;It seemed so natural to assume the
  attention of the monster must be distracted by this trench before
  it&mdash;and was suddenly knocked backwards by a bullet through his neck. His
  feet flew up, and he vanished out of the margin of the watcher's field of
  vision. The war correspondent grovelled tighter, but after a glance behind
  him at a painful little confusion, he resumed his field-glass, for the thing
  was putting down its feet one after the other, and hoisting itself farther
  and farther over the trench. Only a bullet in the head could have stopped him
  looking just then.</p>

  <p>The lean man with the strident voice ceased firing to turn and reiterate
  his point. "They can't possibly cross," he bawled. They&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!"&mdash;drowned everything.</p>

  <p>The lean man continued speaking for a word or so, then gave it up, shook
  his head to enforce the impossibility of anything crossing a trench like the
  one below, and resumed business once more.</p>

  <p>And all the while that great bulk was crossing. When the war correspondent
  turned his glass on it again it had bridged the trench, and its queer feet
  were rasping away at the farther bank, in the attempt to get a hold there. It
  got its hold. It continued to crawl until the greater bulk of it was over the
  trench&mdash;until it was all over. Then it paused for a moment, adjusted its
  skirt a little nearer the ground, gave an unnerving "toot, toot," and came on
  abruptly at a pace of, perhaps, six miles an hour straight up the gentle
  slope towards our observer.</p>

  <p>The war correspondent raised himself on his elbow and looked a natural
  inquiry at the artist.</p>

  <p>For a moment the men about him stuck to their position and fired
  furiously. Then the lean man in a mood of precipitancy slid backwards, and
  the war correspondent said "Come along" to the artist, and led the movement
  along the trench.</p>

  <p>As they dropped down, the vision of a hillside of trench being rushed by a
  dozen vast cockroaches disappeared for a space, and instead was one of a
  narrow passage, crowded with men, for the most part receding, though one or
  two turned or halted. He never turned back to see the nose of the monster
  creep over the brow of the trench; he never even troubled to keep in touch
  with the artist. He heard the "whit" of bullets about him soon enough, and
  saw a man before him stumble and drop, and then he was one of a furious crowd
  fighting to get into a transverse zigzag ditch that enabled the defenders to
  get under cover up and down the hill. It was like a theatre panic. He
  gathered from signs and fragmentary words that on ahead another of these
  monsters had also won to the second trench.</p>

  <p>He lost his interest in the general course of the battle for a space
  altogether; he became simply a modest egotist, in a mood of hasty
  circumspection, seeking the farthest rear, amidst a dispersed multitude of
  disconcerted riflemen similarly employed. He scrambled down through trenches,
  he took his courage in both hands and sprinted across the open, he had
  moments of panic when it seemed madness not to be quadrupedal, and moments of
  shame when he stood up and faced about to see how the fight was going. And he
  was one of many thousand very similar men that morning. On the ridge he
  halted in a knot of scrub, and was for a few minutes almost minded to stop
  and see things out.</p>

  <p>The day was now fully come. The grey sky had changed to blue, and of all
  the cloudy masses of the dawn there remained only a few patches of dissolving
  fleeciness. The world below was bright and singularly clear. The ridge was
  not, perhaps, more than a hundred feet or so above the general plain, but in
  this flat region it sufficed to give the effect of extensive view. Away on
  the north side of the ridge, little and far, were the camps, the ordered
  wagons, all the gear of a big army; with officers galloping about and men
  doing aimless things. Here and there men were falling in, however and the
  cavalry was forming up on the plain beyond the tents. The bulk of men who had
  been in the trenches were still on the move to the rear, scattered like sheep
  without a shepherd over the farther slopes. Here and there were little
  rallies and attempts to wait and do&mdash;something vague; but the general
  drift was away from any concentration. There on the southern side was the
  elaborate lacework of trenches and defences, across which these iron turtles,
  fourteen of them spread out over a line of perhaps three miles, were now
  advancing as fast as a man could trot, and methodically shooting down and
  breaking up any persistent knots of resistance. Here and there stood little
  clumps of men, outflanked and unable to get away, showing the white flag, and
  the invader's cyclist-infantry was advancing now across the open, in open
  order but unmolested, to complete the work of the machines. Surveyed at
  large, the defenders already looked a beaten army. A mechanism that was
  effectually ironclad against bullets, that could at a pinch cross a
  thirty-foot trench, and that seemed able to shoot out rifle-bullets with
  unerring precision, was clearly an inevitable victor against anything but
  rivers, precipices, and guns.</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch. "Half-past four! Lord! What things can happen in
  two hours. Here's the whole blessed army being walked over, and at half-past
  two&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And even now our blessed louts haven't done a thing with their guns!"</p>

  <p>He scanned the ridge right and left of him with his glasses. He turned
  again to the nearest land ironclad, advancing now obliquely to him and not
  three hundred yards away, and then scrambled the ground over which he must
  retreat if he was not to be captured.</p>

  <p>"They'll do nothing," he said, and glanced again at the enemy.</p>

  <p>And then from far away to the left came the thud of a gun, followed very
  rapidly by a rolling gunfire.</p>

  <p>He hesitated and decided to stay.</p><br>

  <h2>III</h2>

  <p>The defender had relied chiefly upon his rifles in the event of an
  assault. His guns he kept concealed at various points upon and behind the
  ridge ready to bring them into action against any artillery preparations for
  an attack on the part of his antagonist. The situation had rushed upon him
  with the dawn, and by the time the gunners had their guns ready for motion,
  the land ironclads were already in among the foremost trenches. There is a
  natural reluctance to fire into one's own broken men, and many of the guns,
  being Intended simply to fight an advance of the enemy's artillery, were not
  in positions to hit anything in the second line of trenches. After that the
  advance of the land ironclads was swift. The defender-general found himself
  suddenly called upon to invent a new sort of warfare, in which guns were to
  fight alone amidst broken and retreating infantry. He had scarcely thirty
  minutes in which to think it out. He did not respond to the call, and what
  happened that morning was that the advance of the land ironclads forced the
  fight, and each gun and battery made what play its circumstances dictated.
  For the most part it was poor play.</p>

  <p>Some of the guns got in two or three shots, some one or two, and the
  percentage of misses was unusually high. The howitzers, of course, did
  nothing. The land ironclads in each case followed much the same tactics. As
  soon as a gun came into play the monster turned itself almost end on, so as
  to minimize the chances of a square hit, and made not for the gun, but for
  the nearest point on its flank from which the gunners could be shot down. Few
  of the hits scored were very effectual; only one of the things was disabled,
  and that was the one that fought the three batteries attached to the brigade
  on the left wing. Three that were hit when close upon the guns were clean
  shot through without being put out of action. Our war correspondent did not
  see that one momentary arrest of the tide of victory on the left; he saw only
  the very ineffectual fight of half-battery 96B close at hand upon his right.
  This he watched some time beyond the margin of safety.</p>

  <p>Just after he heard the three batteries opening up upon his left he became
  aware of the thud of horses' hoofs from the sheltered side of the slope, and
  presently saw first one and then two other guns galloping into position along
  the north side of the ridge, well out of sight of the great bulk that was now
  creeping obliquely towards the crest and cutting up the lingering infantry
  beside it and below, as it came.</p>

  <p>The half-battery swung round into line&mdash;each gun describing its
  curve&mdash;halted, unlimbered, and prepared for action...</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The land ironclad had become visible over the brow of the hill, and just
  visible as a long black back to the gunners. It halted, as though it
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>The two remaining guns fired, and then their big antagonist had swung
  round and was in full view, end on, against the sky, coming at a rush.</p>

  <p>The gunners became frantic in their haste to fire again. They were so near
  the war correspondent could see the expressions on their excited faces
  through his field-glass. As he looked he saw a man drop, and realized for the
  first time that the ironclad was shooting.</p>

  <p>For a moment the big black monster crawled with an accelerated pace
  towards the furiously active gunners. Then, as if moved by a generous
  impulse, it turned its full broadside to their attack, and scarcely forty
  yards away from them. The war correspondent turned his field-glass back to
  the gunners and perceived it was now shooting down the men about the guns
  with the most deadly rapidity.</p>

  <p>Just for a moment it seemed splendid and then it seemed horrible. The
  gunners were dropping in heaps about their guns. To lay a hand on a gun was
  death. "Bang!" went the gun on the left, a hopeless miss, and that was the
  only second shot the half-battery fired. In another moment half-a-dozen
  surviving artillerymen were holding up their hands amidst a scattered muddle
  of dead and wounded men, and the fight was done.</p>

  <p>The war correspondent hesitated between stopping in his scrub and waiting
  for an opportunity to surrender decently, or taking to an adjacent gully he
  had discovered. If he surrendered it was certain he would get no copy off;
  while, if he escaped, there were all sorts of chances. He decided to follow
  the gully, and take the first offer in the confusion beyond the camp of
  picking up a horse.</p><br>

  <h2>IV</h2>

  <p>Subsequent authorities have found fault with the first land ironclads in
  many particulars, but assuredly they served their purpose on the day of their
  appearance. They were essentially long, narrow, and very strong steel
  frameworks carrying the engines, and borne upon eight pairs of big pedrail
  wheels, each about ten feet in diameter, each a driving wheel and set upon
  long axles free to swivel round a common axis. This arrangement gave them the
  maximum of adaptability to the contours of the ground. They crawled level
  along the ground with one foot high upon a hillock and another deep in a
  depression, and they could hold themselves erect and steady sideways upon
  even a steep hillside. The engineers directed the engines under the command
  of the captain, who had look-out points at small ports all round the upper
  edge of the adjustable skirt of twelve-inch iron-plating which protected the
  whole affair, and could also raise or depress a conning-tower set about the
  portholes through the center of the iron top cover. The riflemen each
  occupied a small cabin of peculiar construction and these cabins were slung
  along the sides of and before and behind the great main framework, in a
  manner suggestive of the slinging of the seats of an Irish jaunting-car.
  Their rifles, however, were very different pieces of apparatus from the
  simple mechanisms in the hands of their adversaries.</p>

  <p>These were in the first place automatic, ejected their cartridges and
  loaded again from a magazine each time they fired, until the ammunition store
  was at an end, and they had the most remarkable sights imaginable, sights
  which threw a bright little camera-obscura picture into the light-tight box
  in which the rifleman sat below. This camera-obscura picture was marked with
  two crossed lines, and whatever was covered by the intersection of these two
  lines, that the rifle hit. The sighting was ingeniously contrived. The
  rifleman stood at the table with a thing like an elaborately of a
  draughtsman's dividers in his hand, and he opened and closed these dividers,
  so that they were always at the apparent height&mdash;if it was an
  ordinary-sized man&mdash;of the man he wanted to kill. A little twisted
  strand of wire like an electric-light wire ran from this implement up to the
  gun, and as the dividers opened and shut the sights went up and down. Changes
  in the clearness of the atmosphere, due to changes of moisture, were met by
  an ingenious use of that meteorologically sensitive substance, catgut, and
  when the land ironclad moved forward the sites got a compensatory deflection
  in the direction of its motion. The riflemen stood up in his pitch-dark
  chamber and watched the little picture before him. One hand held the dividers
  for judging distance, and the other grasped a big knob like a door-handle. As
  he pushed this knob about the rifle above swung to correspond, and the
  picture passed to and fro like an agitated panorama. When he saw a man he
  wanted to shoot he brought him up to the cross-lines, and then pressed a
  finger upon a little push like an electric bell-push, conveniently placed in
  the center of the knob. Then the man was shot. If by any chance the rifleman
  missed his target he moved the knob a trifle, or readjusted his dividers,
  pressed the push, and got him the second time.</p>

  <p>This rifle and its sights protruded from a porthole, exactly like a great
  number of other portholes that ran in a triple row under the eaves of the
  cover of the land ironclad. Each porthole displayed a rifle and sight in
  dummy, so that the real ones could only be hit by a chance shot, and if one
  was, then the young man below said "Pshaw!" turned on an electric light,
  lowered the injured instrument into his camera, replaced the injured part, or
  put up a new rifle if the injury was considerable.</p>

  <p>You must conceive these cabins as hung clear above the swing of the axles,
  and inside the big wheels upon which the great elephant-like feet were hung,
  and behind these cabins along the center of the monster ran a central gallery
  into which they opened, and along which worked the big compact engines. It
  was like a long passage into which this throbbing machinery had been packed,
  and the captain stood about the middle, close to the ladder that led to his
  conning-tower, and directed the silent, alert engineers&mdash;for the most
  part by signs. The throb and noise of the engines mingled with the reports of
  the rifles and the intermittent clangour of the bullet hail upon the armour.
  Ever and again he would touch the wheel that raised his conning tower, step
  up his ladder until his engineers could see nothing of him above the waist,
  and then come down again with orders. Two small electric lights were all the
  illumination of this space&mdash;they were placed to make him most clearly
  visible to his subordinates; the air was thick with the smell of oil and
  petrol, and had the war correspondent been suddenly transferred from the
  spacious dawn outside to the bowels of the apparatus he would have thought
  himself fallen into another world.</p>

  <p>The captain, of course, saw both sides of the battle. When he raised his
  head into his conning-tower there were the dewy sunrise, the amazed and
  disordered trenches, the flying and falling soldiers, the depressed-looking
  groups of prisoners, the beaten guns; when he bent down again to signal "half
  speed", "quarter speed", "half circle round towards the right," or what not,
  he was in the oil-smelling twilight of the ill-lit engine room. Close beside
  him on either side was the mouthpiece of a speaking-tube, and ever and again
  he would direct one side or other of his strange craft to "Concentrate fire
  forward on gunners," or to "clear out trench about a hundred yards on our
  right front."</p>

  <p>He was a young man, healthy enough but by no means sun-tanned, and of a
  type of feature and expression that prevails in His Majesty's Navy: alert,
  intelligent, quiet. He and his engineers and his riflemen all went about
  their work, calm and reasonable men. They had none of that flapping
  strenuousness of the half-wit in a hurry, that excessive strain upon the
  blood-vessels, that hysteria of effort which is so frequently regarded as the
  proper state of mind for heroic deeds.</p>

  <p>For the enemy these young engineers were defeating they felt a certain
  qualified pity and a quite unqualified contempt. They regarded these big,
  healthy men they were shooting down precisely as these same big, healthy men
  might regard some inferior kind of native. They despised them for making war;
  despised their bawling patriotisms and their emotionality profoundly;
  despised them, above all, for the petty cunning and the almost brutish want
  of imagination their method of fighting displayed. "If they <i>must</i> make
  war," these young men thought, "why in thunder don't they do it like sensible
  men?" They resented the assumption that their own side was too stupid to do
  anything more than play their enemy's game, that they were going to play this
  costly folly according to the rules of unimaginative men. They resented being
  forced to the trouble of making man-killing machinery; resented the
  alternative of having to massacre these people or endure their truculent
  yappings; resented the whole unfathomable imbecility of war.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, with something of the mechanical precision of a good clerk
  posting a ledger, the riflemen moved their knobs and pressed their
  buttons...</p>

  <p>The captain of Land Ironclad Number Three had halted on the crest close to
  his captured half-battery. His lined-up prisoners stood hard by and waited
  for the cyclists behind to come for them. He surveyed the victorious morning
  through his conning-tower.</p>

  <p>He read the general's signals. "Five and Four are to keep among the guns
  to the left and prevent any attempt to recover them. Seven and Eleven and
  Twelve, stick to the guns you have got; Seven, get into position to command
  the guns taken by Three. Then, we're to do something else, are we? Six and
  One, quicken up to about ten miles an hour and walk round behind that camp to
  the levels near the river&mdash;-we shall bag the whole crowd of them,"
  interjected the young man. "Ah, here we are! Two and Three, Eight and Nine,
  Thirteen and Fourteen, space out to a thousand yards, wait for the word, and
  then go slowly to cover the advance of the cyclist infantry against any
  charge of mounted troops. That's all right. But where's Ten? Halloa! Ten to
  repair and get movable as soon as possible. They've broken up Ten!"</p>

  <p>The discipline of the new war machines was business-like rather than
  pedantic, and the head of the captain came down out of the conning-tower to
  tell his men. "I say, you chaps there. They've broken up Ten. Not badly, I
  think; but anyhow, he's stuck."</p>

  <p>But that still left thirteen of the monsters in action to finish up the
  broken army.</p>

  <p>The war correspondent stealing down his gully looked back and saw them all
  lying along the crest and talking fluttenng congratulatory flags to one
  another. Their iron sides were shining golden in the light of the rising
  sun.</p><br>

  <h2>V</h2>

  <p>The private adventures of the war correspondent terminated in surrender
  about one o'clock in the afternoon, and by that time he had stolen a horse,
  pitched off it, and narrowly escaped being rolled upon; found the brute had
  broken its leg, and shot it with his revolver. He had spent some hours in the
  company of a squad of dispirited riflemen, had quarrelled with them about
  topography at last, and gone off by himself in a direction that should have
  brought him to the banks of the river and didn't. Moreover, he had eaten all
  his chocolate and found nothing in the whole world to drink. Also, it had
  become extremely hot. From behind a broken, but attractive, stone wall he had
  seen far away in the distance the defender-horsemen trying to charge cyclists
  in open order, with land ironclads outflanking them on either side. He had
  discovered that cyclists could retreat over open turf before horsemen with a
  sufficient margin of speed to allow of frequent dismounts and much terribly
  effective sharpshooting; and he had a sufficient persuasion that those
  horsemen, having charged their hearts out, had halted just beyond his range
  of vision and surrendered. He had been urged to sudden activity by a forward
  movement of one of those machines that had threatened to enfilade his wall.
  He had discovered a fearful blister on his heel.</p>

  <p>He was now in a scrubby gravelly place, sitting down and meditating on his
  pocket-handkerchief, which had in some extraordinary way become in the last
  twenty-four hours extremely ambiguous in hue. "It's the whitest thing I've
  got," he said.</p>

  <p>He had known all along that the enemy was east, west, and south of him,
  but when he heard war Ironclads Number's One and Six talking in their
  measured, deadly way not half a mile to the north he decided to make his own
  little unconditional peace without any further risks. He was for hoisting his
  white flag to a bush and taking up a position of modest obscurity near it,
  until someone came along. He became aware of voices, clatter, and the
  distinctive noises of a body of horse, quite near, and he put his
  handkerchief in his pocket again and went to see what was going forward.</p>

  <p>The sound of firing ceased, and then as he drew near he heard the deep
  sounds of many simple, coarse, but hearty and noble-hearted soldiers of the
  old school swearing with vigour.</p>

  <p>He emerged from his scrub upon a big level plain, and far away a fringe of
  trees marked the banks of the river. In the center of the picture was a still
  intact road bridge, and a big railway bridge a little to the right. Two land
  ironclads rested, with a general air of being long, harmless sheds, in a pose
  of anticipatory peacefulness right and left of the picture, completely
  commanding two miles and more of the river levels. Emerged and halted a few
  yards from the scrub was the remainder of the defender's cavalry, dusty, a
  little disordered and obviously annoyed, but still a very fine show of men.
  In the middle distance three or four men and horses were receiving medical
  attendance, and nearer a knot of officers regarded the distant novelties in
  mechanism with profound distaste. Everyone was very distinctly aware of the
  twelve other ironclads, and of the multitude of townsmen soldiers, on
  bicycles or afoot, encumbered now by prisoners and captured war-gear but
  otherwise thoroughly effective, who were sweeping like a great net in their
  rear.</p>

  <p>"Checkmate," said the war correspondent, walking out into the open. "But I
  surrender in the best of company. Twenty-four hours ago I thought war was
  impossible&mdash;and these beggars have captured the whole blessed army!
  Well! Well!" He thought of his talk with the young lieutenant. "If there's no
  end to the surprises of science, the civilized people have it, of course. As
  long as their science keeps going they will necessarily be ahead of open-
  country men. Still..." He wondered for a space what might have happened to
  the young lieutenant.</p>

  <p>The war correspondent was one of those inconsistent people who always want
  the beaten side to win. When he saw all these burly, sun-tanned horsemen,
  disarmed and dismounted and lined up; when he saw their horses unskillfully
  led away by the singularly not equestrian cyclists to whom they had
  surrendered; when he saw these truncated Paladins watching this scandalous
  sight, he forgot altogether that he had called these men "cunning louts" and
  wished them beaten not four-and-twenty hours ago. A month ago he had seen
  that regiment in its pride going forth to war, and had been told of its
  terrible prowess, how it could charge in open order with each man firing from
  his saddle, and sweep before it anything else that ever came out to battle in
  any sort of order, foot or horse. And it had had to fight a few score of
  young men in atrociously unfair machines!</p>

  <p>"Manhood <i>versus</i> Machinery" occurred to him as a suitable headline.
  Journalism curdles all one's mind to phrases.</p>

  <p>He strolled as near the lined-up prisoners as the sentinels seemed
  disposed to permit and surveyed them and compared their sturdy proportions
  with those of their lightly built captors.</p>

  <p>"Smart degenerates," he muttered. "An&aelig;mic cockneydom"</p>

  <p>The surrendered officers came quite close to him presently, and he could
  hear the colonel's high-pitched tenor. The poor gentleman had spent three
  years of arduous toil upon the best material in the world perfecting that
  shooting from the saddle charge, and he was mourning with phrases of
  blasphemy, natural under the circumstances what one could be expected to do
  against this suitably consigned ironmongery.</p>

  <p>"Guns," said some one.</p>

  <p>"Big guns they can walk round. You can't shift big guns to keep pace with
  them and little guns in the open they rush. I saw 'em rushed. You might do a
  surprise now and then&mdash;assassinate the brutes, perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You might make things like 'em."</p>

  <p>"What? <i>More</i> ironmongery? Us?..."</p>

  <p>"I'll call my article," meditated the war correspondent, "'Mankind
  <i>versus</i> Ironmongery,' and quote the old boy at the beginning."</p>

  <p>And he was much too good a journalist to spoil his contrast by remarking
  that the half-dozen comparatively slender young men in blue pajamas who were
  standing about their victorious land ironclad, drinking coffee and eating
  biscuits, had also in their eyes and carriage something not altogether
  degraded below the level of a man.</p>

     name="story65">THE COUNTRY OF THE BLIND</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, April 1904</h3>

  <p>Three hundred miles and more from Chimborazo, one hundred from the snows
  of Cotopaxi, in the wildest wastes of Ecuador's Andes, there lies that
  mysterious mountain valley, cut off from all the world of men, the Country of
  the Blind. Long years ago that valley lay so far open to the world that men
  might come at last through frightful gorges and over an icy pass into its
  equable meadows, and thither indeed men came, a family or so of Peruvian
  half-breeds fleeing from the lust and tyranny of an evil Spanish ruler. Then
  came the stupendous outbreak of Mindobamba, when it was night in Quito for
  seventeen days, and the water was boiling at Yaguachi and all the fish
  floating dying even as far as Guayaquil; everywhere along the Pacific slopes
  there were landslips and swift thawings and sudden floods, and one whole side
  of the old Arauca crest slipped and came down in thunder, and cut off the
  Country of the Blind for ever from the exploring feet of men. But one of
  these early settlers had chanced to be on the hither side of the gorges when
  the world had so terribly shaken itself, and he perforce had to forget his
  wife and his child and all the friends and possessions he had left up there,
  and start life over again in the lower world. He started it again but ill,
  blindness overtook him, and he died of punishment in the mines; but the story
  he told begot a legend that lingers along the length of the Cordilleras of
  the Andes to this day.</p>

  <p>He told of his reason for venturing back from that fastness, into which he
  had first been carried lashed to a llama, beside a vast bale of gear, when he
  was a child. The valley, he said, had in it all that the heart of man could
  desire&mdash;sweet water, pasture, an even climate, slopes of rich brown soil
  with tangles of a shrub that bore an excellent fruit, and on one side great
  hanging forests of pine that held the avalanches high. Far overhead, on three
  sides, vast cliffs of grey-green rock were capped by cliffs of ice; but the
  glacier stream came not to them, but flowed away by the farther slopes, and
  only now and then huge ice masses fell on the valley side. In this valley it
  neither rained nor snowed, but the abundant springs gave a rich green
  pasture, that irrigation would spread over all the valley space. The settlers
  did well indeed there. Their beasts did well and multiplied, and but one
  thing marred their happiness. Yet it was enough to mar it greatly. A strange
  disease had come upon them and had made all the children born to them
  there&mdash;and indeed, several older children also&mdash;blind. It was to
  seek some charm or antidote against this plague of blindness that he had with
  fatigue and danger and difficulty returned down the gorge. In those days, in
  such cases, men did not think of germs and infections, but of sins, and it
  seemed to him that the reason of this affliction must he in the negligence of
  these priestless immigrants to set up a shrine so soon as they entered the
  valley. He wanted a shrine&mdash;a handsome, cheap, effectual shrine&mdash;to
  be erected in the valley; he wanted relics and suchlike potent things of
  faith, blessed objects and mysterious medals and prayers. In his wallet he
  had a bar of native silver for which he would not account; he insisted there
  was none in the valley with something of the insistence of an inexpert liar.
  They had all clubbed their money and ornaments together, having little need
  for such treasure up there, he said, to buy them holy help against their ill.
  I figure this dim-eyed young mountaineer, sunburnt, gaunt, and anxious, hat
  brim clutched feverishly, a man all unused to the ways of the lower world,
  telling this story to some keen-eyed, attentive priest before the great
  convulsion; I can picture him presently seeking to return with pious and
  infallible remedies against that trouble, and the infinite dismay with which
  he must have faced the tumbled vastness where the gorge had once come out.
  But the rest of his story of mischances is lost to me, save that I know of
  his evil death after several years. Poor stray from that remoteness! The
  stream that had once made the gorge now bursts from the mouth of a rocky
  cave, and the legend his poor, ill-told story set going developed into the
  legend of a race of blind men somewhere "over there" one may still hear
  to-day.</p>

  <p>And amidst the little population of that now isolated and forgotten valley
  the disease ran its course. The old became groping, the young saw but dimly,
  and the children that were born to them never saw at all. But life was very
  easy in that snow-rimmed basin, lost to all the world, with neither thorns
  nor briers, with no evil insects nor any beasts save the gentle breed of
  llamas they had lugged and thrust and followed up the beds of the shrunken
  rivers in the gorges up which they had come. The seeing had become purblind
  so gradually that they scarcely noticed their loss. They guided the sightless
  youngsters hither and thither until they knew the whole valley marvellously,
  and when at last sight died out among them the race lived on. They had even
  time to adapt themselves to the blind control of fire, which they made
  carefully in stoves of stone. They were a simple strain of people at the
  first, unlettered, only slightly touched with the Spanish civilisation, but
  with something of a tradition of the arts of old Peru and of its lost
  philosophy. Generation followed generation. They forgot many things; they
  devised many things. Their tradition of the greater world they came from
  became mythical in colour and uncertain. In all things save sight they were
  strong and able, and presently chance sent one who had an original mind and
  who could talk and persuade among them, and then afterwards another. These
  two passed, leaving their effects, and the little community grew in numbers
  and in understanding, and met and settled social and economic problems that
  arose. Generation followed generation. Generation followed generation. There
  came a time when a child was born who was fifteen generations from that
  ancestor who went out of the valley with a bar of silver to seek God's aid,
  and who never returned. There about it chanced that a man came into this
  community from the outer world. And this is the story of that man.</p>

  <p>He was a mountaineer from the country near Quito, a man who had been down
  to the sea and had seen the world, a reader of books in an original way, an
  acute and enterprising man, and he was taken on by a party of Englishmen who
  had come out to Ecuador to climb mountains, to replace one of their three
  Swiss guides who had fallen ill. He climbed here and he climbed there, and
  then came the attempt on Parascotopetl, the Matterhorn of the Andes, in which
  he was lost to the outer world. The story of that accident has been written a
  dozen times. Pointer's narrative is the best. He tells how the little party
  worked their difficult and almost vertical way up to the very foot of the
  last and greatest precipice, and how they built a night shelter amidst the
  snow upon a little shelf of rock, and with a touch of real dramatic power,
  how presently they found Nunez had gone from them. They shouted, and there
  was no reply; shouted and whistled, and for the rest of that night they slept
  no more.</p>

  <p>As the morning broke they saw the traces of his fall. It seems impossible
  he could have uttered a sound. He had slipped eastward towards the unknown
  side of the mountain; far below he had struck a steep slope of snow, and
  ploughed his way down it in the midst of a snow avalanche. His track went
  straight to the edge of a frightful precipice, and beyond that everything was
  hidden. Far, far below, and hazy with distance, they could see trees rising
  out of a narrow, shut-in valley&mdash;the lost Country of the Blind. But they
  did not know it was the lost Country of the Blind, nor distinguish it in any
  way from any other narrow streak of upland valley. Unnerved by this disaster,
  they abandoned their attempt in the afternoon, and Pointer was called away to
  the war before he could make another attack. To this day Parascotopetl lifts
  an unconquered crest, and Pointer's shelter crumbles unvisited amidst the
  snows.</p>

  <p>And the man who fell survived.</p>

  <p>At the end of the slope he fell a thousand feet, and came down in the
  midst of a cloud of snow upon a snow slope even steeper than the one above.
  Down this he was whirled, stunned and insensible, but without a bone broken
  in his body; and then at last came to gentler slopes, and at last rolled out
  and lay still, buried amidst a softening heap of the white masses that had
  accompanied and saved him. He came to himself with a dim fancy that he was
  ill in bed; then realized his position with a mountaineer's intelligence and
  worked himself loose and, after a rest or so, out until he saw the stars. He
  rested flat upon his chest for a space, wondering where he was and what had
  happened to him. He explored his limbs, and discovered that several of his
  buttons were gone and his coat turned over his head. His knife had gone from
  his pocket and his hat was lost, though he had tied it under his chin. He
  recalled that he had been looking for loose stones to raise his piece of the
  shelter wall. His ice-axe had disappeared.</p>

  <p>He decided he must have fallen, and looked up to see, exaggerated by the
  ghastly light of the rising moon, the tremendous flight he had taken. For a
  while he lay, gazing blankly at the vast, pale cliff towering above, rising
  moment by moment out of a subsiding tide of darkness. Its phantasmal,
  mysterious beauty held him for a space, and then he was seized with a
  paroxysm of sobbing laughter...</p>

  <p>After a great interval of time he became aware that he was near the lower
  edge of the snow. Below, down what was now a moonlit and practicable slope,
  he saw the dark and broken appearance of rock-strewn turf. He struggled to
  his feet, aching in every joint and limb, got down painfully from the heaped
  loose snow about him, went downward until he was on the turf, and there
  dropped rather than lay beside a boulder, drank deep from the flask in his
  inner pocket, and instantly fell asleep...</p>

  <p>He was awakened by the singing of birds in the trees far below.</p>

  <p>He sat up and perceived he was on a little alp at the foot of a vast
  precipice that sloped only a little in the gully down which he and his snow
  had come. Over against him another wall of rock reared itself against the
  sky. The gorge between these precipices ran east and west and was full of the
  morning sunlight, which lit to the westward the mass of fallen mountain that
  closed the descending gorge. Below him it seemed there was a precipice
  equally steep, but behind the snow in the gully he found a sort of
  chimney-cleft dripping with snow-water, down which a desperate man might
  venture. He found it easier than it seemed, and came at last to another
  desolate alp, and then after a rock climb of no particular difficulty, to a
  steep slope of trees. He took his bearings and turned his face up the gorge,
  for he saw it opened out above upon green meadows, among which he now
  glimpsed quite distinctly a cluster of stone huts of unfamiliar fashion. At
  times his progress was like clambering along the face of a wall, and after a
  time the rising sun ceased to strike along the gorge, the voices of the
  singing birds died away, and the air grew cold and dark about him. But the
  distant valley with its houses was all the brighter for that. He came
  presently to talus, and among the rocks he noted&mdash;for he was an
  observant man&mdash;an unfamiliar fern that seemed to clutch out of the
  crevices with intense green hands. He picked a frond or so and gnawed its
  stalk, and found it helpful.</p>

  <p>About midday he came at last out of the throat of the gorge into the plain
  and the sunlight. He was stiff and weary; he sat down in the shadow of a
  rock, filled up his flask with water from a spring and drank it down, and
  remained for a time, resting before he went on to the houses.</p>

  <p>They were very strange to his eyes, and indeed the whole aspect of that
  valley became, as he regarded it, queerer and more unfamiliar. The greater
  part of its surface was lush green meadow, starred with many beautiful
  flowers, irrigated with extraordinary care, and bearing evidence of
  systematic cropping piece by piece. High up and ringing the valley about was
  a wall, and what appeared to be a circumferential water-channel, from which
  the little trickles of water that fed the meadow plants came, and on the
  higher slopes above this flocks of llamas cropped the scanty herbage. Sheds,
  apparently shelters or feeding-places for the llamas, stood against the
  boundary wall here and there. The irrigation streams ran together into a main
  channel down the centre of the valley, and this was enclosed on either side
  by a wall breast high. This gave a singularly urban quality to this secluded
  place, a quality that was greatly enhanced by the fact that a number of paths
  paved with black and white stones, and each with a curious little kerb at the
  side, ran hither and thither in an orderly manner. The houses of the central
  village were quite unlike the casual and higgledy-piggledy agglomeration of
  the mountain villages he knew; they stood in a continuous row on either side
  of a central street of astonishing cleanness, here and there their
  parti-coloured facade was pierced by a door, and not a solitary window broke
  their even frontage. They were parti-coloured with extraordinary
  irregularity, smeared with a sort of plaster that was sometimes grey,
  sometimes drab, sometimes slate-coloured or dark brown; and it was the sight
  of this wild plastering first brought the word "blind" into the thoughts of
  the explorer. "The good man who did that," he thought, "must have been as
  blind as a bat."</p>

  <p>He descended a steep place, and so came to the wall and channel that ran
  about the valley, near where the latter spouted out its surplus contents into
  the deeps of the gorge in a thin and wavering thread of cascade. He could now
  see a number of men and women resting on piled heaps of grass, as if taking a
  siesta, in the remoter part of the meadow, and nearer the village a number of
  recumbent children, and then nearer at hand three men carrying pails on yokes
  along a little path that ran from the encircling wall towards the houses.
  These latter were clad in garments of llama cloth and boots and belts of
  leather, and they wore caps of cloth with back and ear flaps. They followed
  one another in single file, walking slowly and yawning as they walked, like
  men who have been up all night. There was something so reassuringly
  prosperous and respectable in their bearing that after a moment's hesitation
  Nunez stood forward as conspicuously as possible upon his rock, and gave vent
  to a mighty shout that echoed round the valley.</p>

  <p>The three men stopped, and moved their heads as though they were looking
  about them. They turned their faces this way and that, and Nunez gesticulated
  with freedom. But they did not appear to see him for all his gestures, and
  after a time, directing themselves towards the mountains far away to the
  right, they shouted as if in answer. Nunez bawled again, and then once more,
  and as he gestured ineffectually the word "blind" came up to the top of his
  thoughts. "The fools must be blind," he said.</p>

  <p>When at last, after much shouting and wrath, Nunez crossed the stream by a
  little bridge, came through a gate in the wall, and approached them, he was
  sure that they were blind. He was sure that this was the Country of the Blind
  of which the legends told. Conviction had sprung upon him, and a sense of
  great and rather enviable adventure. The three stood side by side, not
  looking at him, but with their ears directed towards him, judging him by his
  unfamiliar steps. They stood close together like men a little afraid, and he
  could see their eyelids closed and sunken, as though the very balls beneath
  had shrunk away. There was an expression near awe on their faces.</p>

  <p>"A man," one said, in hardly recognisable Spanish&mdash;"A man it is
  &mdash;a man or a spirit&mdash;coming down from the rocks."</p>

  <p>But Nunez advanced with the confident steps of a youth who enters upon
  life. All the old stories of the lost valley and the Country of the Blind had
  come back to his mind, and through his thoughts ran this old proverb, as if
  it were a refrain&mdash;</p>

  <p>"In the Country of the Blind the One-Eyed Man is King."</p>

  <p>"In the Country of the Blind the One-Eyed Man is King."</p>

  <p>And very civilly he gave them greeting. He talked to them and used his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Where does he come from, brother Pedro?" asked one.</p>

  <p>"Down out of the rocks."</p>

  <p>"Over the mountains I come," said Nunez, "out of the country beyond there
  &mdash;where men can see. From near Bogota, where there are a hundred
  thousands of people, and where the city passes out of sight."</p>

  <p>"Sight?" muttered Pedro. "Sight?"</p>

  <p>"He comes," said the second blind man, "out of the rocks."</p>

  <p>The cloth of their coats, Nunez saw was curious fashioned, each with a
  different sort of stitching.</p>

  <p>They startled him by a simultaneous movement towards him, each with a hand
  outstretched. He stepped back from the advance of these spread fingers.</p>

  <p>"Come hither," said the third blind man, following his motion and
  clutching him neatly.</p>

  <p>And they held Nunez and felt him over, saying no word further until they
  had done so.</p>

  <p>"Carefully," he cried, with a finger in his eye, and found they thought
  that organ, with its fluttering lids, a queer thing in him. They went over it
  again.</p>

  <p>"A strange creature, Correa," said the one called Pedro. "Feel the
  coarseness of his hair. Like a llama's hair."</p>

  <p>"Rough he is as the rocks that begot him," said Correa, investigating
  Nunez's unshaven chin with a soft and slightly moist hand. "Perhaps he will
  grow finer."</p>

  <p>Nunez struggled a little under their examination, but they gripped him
  firm.</p>

  <p>"Carefully," he said again.</p>

  <p>"He speaks," said the third man. "Certainly he is a man."</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" said Pedro, at the roughness of his coat.</p>

  <p>"And you have come into the world?" asked Pedro.</p>

  <p>"Out of the world. Over mountains and glaciers; right over above there,
  halfway to the sun. Out of the great, big world that goes down, twelve days'
  journey to the sea."</p>

  <p>They scarcely seemed to heed him. "Our fathers have told us men may be
  made by the forces of Nature," said Correa. "It is the warmth of things, and
  moisture, and rottenness&mdash;rottenness."</p>

  <p>"Let us lead him to the elders," said Pedro.</p>

  <p>"Shout first," said Correa, "lest the children be afraid. This is a
  marvellous occasion."</p>

  <p>So they shouted, and Pedro went first and took Nunez by the hand to lead
  him to the houses.</p>

  <p>He drew his hand away. "I can see," he said.</p>

  <p>"See?" said Correa.</p>

  <p>"Yes; see," said Nunez, turning towards him, and stumbled against Pedro's
  pail.</p>

  <p>"His senses are still imperfect," said the third blind man. "He stumbles,
  and talks unmeaning words. Lead him by the hand."</p>

  <p>"As you will," said Nunez, and was led along laughing.</p>

  <p>It seemed they knew nothing of sight.</p>

  <p>Well, all in good time he would teach them.</p>

  <p>He heard people shouting, and saw a number of figures gathering together
  in the middle roadway of the village.</p>

  <p>He found it tax his nerve and patience more than he had anticipated, that
  first encounter with the population of the Country of the Blind. The place
  seemed larger as he drew near to it, and the smeared plasterings queerer, and
  a crowd of children and men and women (the women and girls he was pleased to
  note had, some of them, quite sweet faces, for all that their eyes were shut
  and sunken) came about him, holding on to him, touching him with soft,
  sensitive hands, smelling at him, and listening at every word he spoke. Some
  of the maidens and children, however, kept aloof as if afraid, and indeed his
  voice seemed coarse and rude beside their softer notes. They mobbed him. His
  three guides kept close to him with an effect of proprietorship, and said
  again and again, "A wild man out of the rocks."</p>

  <p>"Bogota," he said. "Bogota. Over the mountain crests."</p>

  <p>"A wild man&mdash;using wild words," said Pedro. "Did you hear that
  &mdash;Bogota? His mind has hardly formed yet. He has only the beginnings of
  speech."</p>

  <p>A little boy nipped his hand. "Bogota!" he said mockingly.</p>

  <p>"Aye! A city to your village. I come from the great world&mdash;where men
  have eyes and see."</p>

  <p>"His name's Bogota," they said.</p>

  <p>"He stumbled," said Correa, "stumbled twice as we came hither."</p>

  <p>"Bring him in to the elders."</p>

  <p>And they thrust him suddenly through a doorway into a room as black as
  pitch, save at the end there faintly glowed a fire. The crowd closed in
  behind him and shut out all but the faintest glimmer of day, and before he
  could arrest himself he had fallen headlong over the feet of a seated man.
  His arm, outflung, struck the face of someone else as he went down; he felt
  the soft impact of features and heard a cry of anger, and for a moment he
  struggled against a number of hands that clutched him. It was a one-sided
  fight. An inkling of the situation came to him and he lay quiet.</p>

  <p>"I fell down," he said; "I couldn't see in this pitchy darkness."</p>

  <p>There was a pause as if the unseen persons about him tried to understand
  his words. Then the voice of Correa said: "He is but newly formed. He
  stumbles as he walks and mingles words that mean nothing with his
  speech."</p>

  <p>Others also said things about him that he heard or understood
  imperfectly.</p>

  <p>"May I sit up?" he asked, in a pause. "I will not struggle against you
  again."</p>

  <p>They consulted and let him rise.</p>

  <p>The voice of an older man began to question him, and Nunez found himself
  trying to explain the great world out of which he had fallen, and the sky and
  mountains and suchlike marvels, to these elders who sat in darkness in the
  Country of the Blind. And they would believe and understand nothing whatever
  that he told them, a thing quite outside his expectation. They would not even
  understand many of his words. For fourteen generations these people had been
  blind and cut off from all the seeing world; the names for all the things of
  sight had faded and changed; the story of the outer world was faded and
  changed to a child's story; and they had ceased to concern themselves with
  anything beyond the rocky slopes above their circling wall. Blind men of
  genius had arisen among them and questioned the shreds of belief and
  tradition they had brought with them from their seeing days, and had
  dismissed all these things as idle fancies and replaced them with new and
  saner explanations. Much of their imagination had shrivelled with their eyes,
  and they had made for themselves new imaginations with their ever more
  sensitive ears and finger-tips. Slowly Nunez realised this: that his
  expectation of wonder and reverence at his origin and his gifts was not to be
  borne out; and after his poor attempt to explain sight to them had been set
  aside as the confused version of a new-made being describing the marvels of
  his incoherent sensations, he subsided, a little dashed, into listening to
  their instruction. And the eldest of the blind men explained to him life and
  philosophy and religion, how that the world (meaning their valley) had been
  first an empty hollow in the rocks, and then had come first inanimate things
  without the gift of touch, and llamas and a few other creatures that had
  little sense, and then men, and at last angels, whom one could hear singing
  and making fluttering sounds, but whom no one could touch at all, which
  puzzled Nunez greatly until he thought of the birds.</p>

  <p>He went on to tell Nunez how this time had been divided into the warm and
  the cold, which are the blind equivalents of day and night, and how it was
  good to sleep in the warm and work during the cold, so that now, but for his
  advent, the whole town of the blind would have been asleep. He said Nunez
  must have been specially created to learn and serve the wisdom they had
  acquired, and that for all his mental incoherency and stumbling behaviour he
  must have courage and do his best to learn, and at that all the people in the
  doorway murmured encouragingly. He said the night&mdash;for the blind call
  their day night&mdash;was now far gone, and it behooved everyone to go back
  to sleep. He asked Nunez if he knew how to sleep, and Nunez said he did, but
  that before sleep he wanted food.</p>

  <p>They brought him food&mdash;llama's milk in a bowl and rough salted
  bread&mdash;and led him into a lonely place to eat out of their hearing, and
  afterwards to slumber until the chill of the mountain evening roused them to
  begin their day again. But Nunez slumbered not at all.</p>

  <p>Instead, he sat up in the place where they had left him, resting his limbs
  and turning the unanticipated circumstances of his arrival over and over in
  his mind.</p>

  <p>Every now and then he laughed, sometimes with amusement and sometimes with
  indignation.</p>

  <p>"Unformed mind!" he said. "Got no senses yet! They little know they've
  been insulting their heaven-sent king and master. I see I must bring them to
  reason. Let me think&mdash;Let me think."</p>

  <p>He was still thinking when the sun set.</p>

  <p>Nunez had an eye for all beautiful things, and it seemed to him that the
  glow upon the snowfields and glaciers that rose about the valley on every
  side was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. His eyes went from that
  inaccessible glory to the village and irrigated fields, fast sinking into the
  twilight, and suddenly a wave of emotion took him, and he thanked God from
  the bottom of his heart that the power of sight had been given him.</p>

  <p>He heard a voice calling to him from out of the village.</p>

  <p>"Ya ho there, Bogota! Come hither!"</p>

  <p>At that he stood up, smiling. He would show these people once and for all
  what sight would do for a man. They would seek him, but not find him.</p>

  <p>"You move not, Bogota," said the voice.</p>

  <p>He laughed noiselessly and made two stealthy steps aside from the
  path.</p>

  <p>"Trample not on the grass, Bogota; that is not allowed."</p>

  <p>Nunez had scarcely heard the sound he made himself. He stopped,
  amazed.</p>

  <p>The owner of the voice came running up the piebald path towards him.</p>

  <p>He stepped back into the pathway. "Here I am," he said.</p>

  <p>"Why did you not come when I called you?" said the blind man. "Must you be
  led like a child? Cannot you hear the path as you walk?"</p>

  <p>Nunez laughed. "I can see it," he said.</p>

  <p>"There is no such word as see," said the blind man, after a pause. "Cease
  this folly and follow the sound of my feet."</p>

  <p>Nunez followed, a little annoyed.</p>

  <p>"My time will come," he said.</p>

  <p>"You'll learn," the blind man answered. "There is much to learn in the
  world."</p>

  <p>"Has no one told you, 'In the Country of the Blind the One-Eyed Man is
  King?'"</p>

  <p>"What is blind?" asked the blind man, carelessly, over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Four days passed and the fifth found the King of the Blind still
  incognito, as a clumsy and useless stranger among his subjects.</p>

  <p>It was, he found, much more difficult to proclaim himself than he had
  supposed, and in the meantime, while he meditated his coup d'&eacute;tat, he
  did what he was told and learnt the manners and customs of the Country of the
  Blind. He found working and going about at night a particularly irksome
  thing, and he decided that, that should be the first thing he would
  change.</p>

  <p>They led a simple, laborious life, these people, with all the elements of
  virtue and happiness as these things can be understood by men. They toiled,
  but not oppressively; they had food and clothing sufficient for their needs;
  they had days and seasons of rest; they made much of music and singing, and
  there was love among them and little children.</p>

  <p>It was marvellous with what confidence and precision they went about their
  ordered world. Everything, you see, had been made to fit their needs; each of
  the radiating paths of the valley area had a constant angle to the others,
  and was distinguished by a special notch upon its kerbing; all obstacles and
  irregularities of path or meadow had long since been cleared away; all their
  methods and procedure arose naturally from their special needs. Their senses
  had become marvellously acute; they could hear and judge the slightest
  gesture of a man a dozen paces away&mdash;could hear the very beating of his
  heart. Intonation had long replaced expression with them, and touches
  gesture, and their work with hoe and spade and fork was as free and confident
  as garden work can be. Their sense of smell was extraordinarily fine; they
  could distinguish individual differences as readily as a dog can, and they
  went about the tending of llamas, who lived among the rocks above and came to
  the wall for food and shelter, with ease and confidence. It was only when at
  last Nunez sought to assert himself that he found how easy and confident
  their movements could be.</p>

  <p>He rebelled only after he had tried persuasion.</p>

  <p>He tried at first on several occasions to tell them of sight. "Look you
  here, you people," he said. "There are things you do not understand in
  me."</p>

  <p>Once or twice one or two of them attended to him; they sat with faces
  downcast and ears turned intelligently towards him, and he did his best to
  tell them what it was to see. Among his hearers was a girl, with eyelids less
  red and sunken than the others, so that one could almost fancy she was hiding
  eyes, whom especially he hoped to persuade. He spoke of the beauties of
  sight, of watching the mountains, of the sky and the sunrise, and they heard
  him with amused incredulity that presently became condemnatory. They told him
  there were indeed no mountains at all, but that the end of the rocks where
  the llamas grazed was indeed the end of the world; thence sprang a cavernous
  roof of the universe, from which the dew and the avalanches fell; and when he
  maintained stoutly the world had neither end nor roof such as they supposed,
  they said his thoughts were wicked. So far as he could describe sky and
  clouds and stars to them it seemed to them a hideous void, a terrible
  blankness in the place of the smooth roof to things in which they
  believed&mdash;it was an article of faith with them that the cavern roof was
  exquisitely smooth to the touch. He saw that in some manner he shocked them,
  and gave up that aspect of the matter altogether, and tried to show them the
  practical value of sight. One morning he saw Pedro in the path called
  Seventeen and coming towards the central houses, but still too far off for
  hearing or scent, and he told them as much. "In a little while," he
  prophesied, "Pedro will be here." An old man remarked that Pedro had no
  business on path Seventeen, and then, as if in confirmation, that individual
  as he drew near turned and went transversely into path Ten, and so back with
  nimble paces towards the outer wall. They mocked Nunez when Pedro did not
  arrive, and afterwards, when he asked Pedro questions to clear his character,
  Pedro denied and outfaced him, and was afterwards hostile to him.</p>

  <p>Then he induced them to let him go a long way up the sloping meadows
  towards the wall with one complaisant individual, and to him he promised to
  describe all that happened among the houses. He noted certain goings and
  comings, but the things that really seemed to signify to these people
  happened inside of or behind the windowless houses&mdash;the only things they
  took note of to test him by&mdash;and of those he could see or tell nothing;
  and it was after the failure of this attempt, and the ridicule they could not
  repress, that he resorted to force. He thought of seizing a spade and
  suddenly smiting one or two of them to earth, and so in fair combat showing
  the advantage of eyes. He went so far with that resolution as to seize his
  spade, and then he discovered a new thing about himself, and that was that it
  was impossible for him to hit a blind man in cold blood.</p>

  <p>He hesitated, and found them all aware that he had snatched up the spade.
  They stood all alert, with their heads on one side, and bent ears towards him
  for what he would do next.</p>

  <p>"Put that spade down," said one, and he felt a sort of helpless horror. He
  came near obedience.</p>

  <p>Then he had thrust one backwards against a house wall, and fled past him
  and out of the village.</p>

  <p>He went athwart one of their meadows, leaving a track of trampled grass
  behind his feet, and presently sat down by the side of one of their ways. He
  felt something of the buoyancy that comes to all men in the beginning of a
  fight, but more perplexity. He began to realise that you cannot even fight
  happily with creatures who stand upon a different mental basis to yourself.
  Far away he saw a number of men carrying spades and sticks come out of the
  street of houses and advance in a spreading line along the several paths
  towards him. They advanced slowly, speaking frequently to one another, and
  ever and again the whole cordon would halt and sniff the air and listen.</p>

  <p>The first time they did this Nunez laughed. But afterwards he did not
  laugh.</p>

  <p>One struck his trail in the meadow grass and came stooping and feeling his
  way along it.</p>

  <p>For five minutes he watched the slow extension of the cordon, and then his
  vague disposition to do something forthwith became frantic. He stood up, went
  a pace or so towards the circumferential wall, turned, and went back a little
  way. There they all stood in a crescent, still and listening.</p>

  <p>He also stood still, gripping his spade very tightly in both hands. Should
  he charge them?</p>

  <p>The pulse in his ears ran into the rhythm of "In the Country of the Blind
  the One-Eyed Man is King."</p>

  <p>Should he charge them?</p>

  <p>He looked back at the high and unclimbable wall behind&mdash;unclimbable
  because of its smooth plastering, but withal pierced with many little doors
  and at the approaching line of seekers. Behind these others were now coming
  out of the street of houses.</p>

  <p>Should he charge them?</p>

  <p>"Bogota!" called one. "Bogota! Where are you?"</p>

  <p>He gripped his spade still tighter and advanced down the meadows towards
  the place of habitations, and directly he moved they converged upon him.
  "I'll hit them if they touch me," he swore; "by Heaven, I will. I'll hit." He
  called aloud, "Look here, I'm going to do what I like in this valley! Do you
  hear? I'm going to do what I like and go where I like."</p>

  <p>They were moving in upon him quickly, groping, yet moving rapidly. It was
  like playing blind man's buff with everyone blindfolded except one. "Get hold
  of him!" cried one. He found himself in the arc of a loose curve of pursuers.
  He felt suddenly he must be active and resolute.</p>

  <p>"You don't understand," he cried, in a voice that was meant to be great
  and resolute, and which broke. "You are blind and I can see. Leave me
  alone!"</p>

  <p>"Bogota! Put down that spade and come off the grass!"</p>

  <p>The last order, grotesque in its urban familiarity, produced a gust of
  anger. "I'll hurt you," he said, sobbing with emotion. "By Heaven, I'll hurt
  you! Leave me alone!"</p>

  <p>He began to run, not knowing clearly where to run. He ran from the nearest
  blind man, because it was a horror to hit him. He stopped, and then made a
  dash to escape from their closing ranks. He made for where a gap was wide,
  and the men on either side, with a quick perception of the approach of his
  paces, rushed in on one another. He sprang forward, and then saw he must be
  caught, and Swish! The spade had struck. He felt the soft thud of hand and
  arm, and the man was down with a yell of pain, and he was through.</p>

  <p>Through! And then he was close to the street of houses again, and blind
  men, whirling spades and stakes, were running with a reasoned swiftness
  hither and thither.</p>

  <p>He heard steps behind him just in time, and found a tall man rushing
  forward and swiping at the sound of him. He lost his nerve, hurled his spade
  a yard wide of this antagonist, and whirled about and fled, fairly yelling as
  he dodged another.</p>

  <p>He was panic-stricken. He ran furiously to and fro, dodging when there was
  no need to dodge, and in his anxiety to see on every side of him at once,
  stumbling. For a moment he was down and they heard his fall. Far away in the
  circumferential wall a little doorway looked like Heaven, and he set off in a
  wild rush for it. He did not even look round at his pursuers until it was
  gained, and he had stumbled across the bridge, clambered a little way among
  the rocks, to the surprise and dismay of a young llama, who went leaping out
  of sight, and lay down sobbing for breath.</p>

  <p>And so his coup d'&eacute;tat came to an end.</p>

  <p>He stayed outside the wall of the valley of the blind for two nights and
  days without food or shelter, and meditated upon the unexpected. During these
  meditations he repeated very frequently and always with a profounder note of
  derision the exploded proverb: "In the Country of the Blind the One-Eyed Man
  is King." He thought chiefly of ways of fighting and conquering these people,
  and it grew clear that for him no practicable way was possible. He had no
  weapons, and now it would be hard to get one.</p>

  <p>The canker of civilisation had got to him even in Bogota, and he could not
  find it in himself to go down and assassinate a blind man. Of course, if he
  did that, he might then dictate terms on the threat of assassinating them
  all. But&mdash;Sooner or later he must sleep...!</p>

  <p>He tried also to find food among the pine trees, to be comfortable under
  pine boughs while the frost fell at night, and&mdash;with less confidence
  &mdash;to catch a llama by artifice in order to try to kill it&mdash;perhaps
  by hammering it with a stone&mdash;and so finally, perhaps, to eat some of
  it. But the llamas had a doubt of him and regarded him with distrustful brown
  eyes and spat when he drew near. Fear came on him the second day and fits of
  shivering. Finally he crawled down to the wall of the Country of the Blind
  and tried to make his terms. He crawled along by the stream, shouting, until
  two blind men came out to the gate and talked to him.</p>

  <p>"I was mad," he said. "But I was only newly made."</p>

  <p>They said that was better.</p>

  <p>He told them he was wiser now, and repented of all he had done.</p>

  <p>Then he wept without intention, for he was very weak and ill now, and they
  took that as a favourable sign.</p>

  <p>They asked him if he still thought he could see."</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "That was folly. The word means nothing&mdash;less than
  nothing!"</p>

  <p>They asked him what was overhead.</p>

  <p>"About ten times ten the height of a man there is a roof above the world
  &mdash;of rock&mdash;and very, very smooth..." He burst again into hysterical
  tears. "Before you ask me any more, give me some food or I shall die!"</p>

  <p>He expected dire punishments, but these blind people were capable of
  toleration. They regarded his rebellion as but one more proof of his general
  idiocy and inferiority, and after they had whipped him they appointed him to
  do the simplest and heaviest work they had for anyone to do, and he, seeing
  no other way of living, did submissively what he was told.</p>

  <p>He was ill for some days and they nursed him kindly. That refined his
  submission. But they insisted on his lying in the dark, and that was a great
  misery. And blind philosophers came and talked to him of the wicked levity of
  his mind, and reproved him so impressively for his doubts about the lid of
  rock that covered their cosmic casserole that he almost doubted whether
  indeed he was not the victim of hallucination in not seeing it overhead.</p>

  <p>So Nunez became a citizen of the Country of the Blind, and these people
  ceased to be a generalised people and became individualities to him, and
  familiar to him, while the world beyond the mountains became more and more
  remote and unreal. There was Yacob, his master, a kindly man when not
  annoyed; there was Pedro, Yacob's nephew; and there was Medina-sarote, who
  was the youngest daughter of Yacob. She was little esteemed in the world of
  the blind, because she had a clear-cut face and lacked that satisfying,
  glossy smoothness that is the blind man's ideal of feminine beauty, but Nunez
  thought her beautiful at first, and presently the most beautiful thing in the
  whole creation. Her closed eyelids were not sunken and red after the common
  way of the valley, but lay as though they might open again at any moment; and
  she had long eyelashes, which were considered a grave disfigurement. And her
  voice was weak and did not satisfy the acute hearing of the valley swains. So
  that she had no lover.</p>

  <p>There came a time when Nunez thought that, could he win her, he would be
  resigned to live in the valley for all the rest of his days.</p>

  <p>He watched her; he sought opportunities of doing her little services and
  presently he found that she observed him. Once at a rest-day gathering they
  sat side by side in the dim starlight, and the music was sweet. His hand came
  upon hers and he dared to clasp it. Then very tenderly she returned his
  pressure. And one day, as they were at their meal in the darkness, he felt
  her hand very softly seeking him, and as it chanced the fire leapt then, and
  he saw the tenderness of her face.</p>

  <p>He sought to speak to her.</p>

  <p>He went to her one day when she was sitting in the summer moonlight
  spinning. The light made her a thing of silver and mystery. He sat down at
  her feet and told her he loved her, and told her how beautiful she seemed to
  him. He had a lover's voice, he spoke with a tender reverence that came near
  to awe, and she had never before been touched by adoration. She made him no
  definite answer, but it was clear his words pleased her.</p>

  <p>After that he talked to her whenever he could take an opportunity. The
  valley became the world for him, and the world beyond the mountains where men
  lived by day seemed no more than a fairy tale he would some day pour into her
  ears. Very tentatively and timidly he spoke to her of sight.</p>

  <p>Sight seemed to her the most poetical of fancies, and she listened to his
  description of the stars and the mountains and her own sweet white-lit beauty
  as though it was a guilty indulgence. She did not believe, she could only
  half understand, but she was mysteriously delighted, and it seemed to him
  that she completely understood.</p>

  <p>His love lost its awe and took courage. Presently he was for demanding her
  of Yacob and the elders in marriage, but she became fearful and delayed. And
  it was one of her elder sisters who first told Yacob that Medina-sarote and
  Nunez were in love.</p>

  <p>There was from the first very great opposition to the marriage of Nunez
  and Medina-sarote; not so much because they valued her as because they held
  him as a being apart, an idiot, incompetent thing below the permissible level
  of a man. Her sisters opposed it bitterly as bringing discredit on them all;
  and old Yacob, though he had formed a sort of liking for his clumsy, obedient
  serf, shook his head and said the thing could not be. The young men were all
  angry at the idea of corrupting the race, and one went so far as to revile
  and strike Nunez. He struck back. Then for the first time he found an
  advantage in seeing, even by twilight, and after that fight was over no one
  was disposed to raise a hand against him. But they still found his marriage
  impossible.</p>

  <p>Old Yacob had a tenderness for his last little daughter, and was grieved
  to have her weep upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You see, my dear, he's an idiot. He has delusions; he can't do anything
  right."</p>

  <p>"I know," wept Medina-sarote. "But he's better than he was. He's getting
  better. And he's strong, dear father, and kind&mdash;stronger and kinder than
  any other man in the world. And he loves me&mdash;and father, I love
  him."</p>

  <p>Old Yacob was greatly distressed to find her inconsolable, and besides
  &mdash;what made it more distressing&mdash;he liked Nunez for many things. So
  he went and sat in the windowless council-chamber with the other elders and
  watched the trend of the talk, and said, at the proper time, "He's better
  than he was. Very likely, some day, we shall find him as sane as
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>Then afterwards one of the elders, who thought deeply, had an idea. He was
  a great doctor among these people, their medicine-man, and he had a very
  philosophical and inventive mind, and the idea of curing Nunez of his
  peculiarities appealed to him. One day when Yacob was present he returned to
  the topic of Nunez. "I have examined Nunez," he said, "and the case is
  clearer to me. I think very probably he might be cured."</p>

  <p>"This is what I have always hoped," said old Yacob.</p>

  <p>"His brain is affected," said the blind doctor.</p>

  <p>The elders murmured assent.</p>

  <p>"Now, what affects it?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said old Yacob.</p>

  <p>"This," said the doctor, answering his own question. "Those queer things
  that are called the eyes, and which exist to make an agreeable depression in
  the face, are diseased, in the case of Nunez, in such a way as to affect his
  brain. They are greatly distended, he has eyelashes, and his eyelids move,
  and consequently his brain is in a state of constant irritation and
  distraction."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" said old Yacob. "Yes?"</p>

  <p>"And I think I may say with reasonable certainty that, in order to cure
  him complete, all that we need to do is a simple and easy surgical operation
  &mdash;namely, to remove these irritant bodies."</p>

  <p>"And then he will be sane?"</p>

  <p>"Then he will be perfectly sane, and a quite admirable citizen."</p>

  <p>"Thank Heaven for science!" said old Yacob, and went forth at once to tell
  Nunez of his happy hopes.</p>

  <p>But Nunez's manner of receiving the good news struck him as being cold and
  disappointing.</p>

  <p>"One might think," he said, "from the tone you take that you did not care
  for my daughter."</p>

  <p>It was Medina-sarote who persuaded Nunez to face the blind surgeons.</p>

  <p>"You do not want me," he said, "to lose my gift of sight?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"My world is sight."</p>

  <p>Her head drooped lower.</p>

  <p>"There are the beautiful things, the beautiful little things&mdash;the
  flowers, the lichens amidst the rocks, the light and softness on a piece of
  fur, the far sky with its drifting dawn of clouds, the sunsets and the stars.
  And there is you. For you alone it is good to have sight, to see your sweet,
  serene face, your kindly lips, your dear, beautiful hands folded together...
  It is these eyes of mine you won, these eyes that hold me to you, that these
  idiots seek. Instead, I must touch you, hear you, and never see you again. I
  must come under that roof of rock and stone and darkness, that horrible roof
  under which your imaginations stoop... No; you would not have me do
  that?"</p>

  <p>A disagreeable doubt had arisen in him. He stopped and left the thing a
  question.</p>

  <p>"I wish," she said, "sometimes&mdash;" She paused.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" he said, a little apprehensively.</p>

  <p>"I wish sometimes&mdash;you would not talk like that."</p>

  <p>"Like what?"</p>

  <p>"I know it's pretty&mdash;it's your imagination. I love it, but
  now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He felt cold. "Now?" he said, faintly.</p>

  <p>She sat quite still.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;you think&mdash;I should be better, better
  perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was realising things very swiftly. He felt anger perhaps, anger at the
  dull course of fate, but also sympathy for her lack of understanding&mdash;a
  sympathy near akin to pity.</p>

  <p>"Dear," he said, and he could see by her whiteness how tensely her spirit
  pressed against the things she could not say. He put his arms about her, he
  kissed her ear, and they sat for a time in silence.</p>

  <p>"If I were to consent to this?" he said at last, in a voice that was very
  gentle.</p>

  <p>She flung her arms about him, weeping wildly. "Oh, if you would," she
  sobbed, "if only you would!"</p>

  <p>For a week before the operation that was to raise him from his servitude
  and inferiority to the level of a blind citizen Nunez knew nothing of sleep,
  and all through the warm, sunlit hours, while the others slumbered happily,
  he sat brooding or wandered aimlessly, trying to bring his mind to bear on
  his dilemma. He had given his answer, he had given his consent, and still he
  was not sure. And at last work-time was over, the sun rose in splendour over
  the golden crests, and his last day of vision began for him. He had a few
  minutes with Medina-sarote before she went apart to sleep.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," he said, "I shall see no more."</p>

  <p>"Dear heart!" she answered, and pressed his hands with all her
  strength.</p>

  <p>"They will hurt you but little," she said; "and you are going through this
  pain&mdash;you are going through it, dear lover, for me... Dear, if a woman's
  heart and life can do it, I will repay you. My dearest one, my dearest with
  the tender voice, I will repay."</p>

  <p>He was drenched in pity for himself and her.</p>

  <p>He held her in his arms, and pressed his lips to hers and looked on her
  sweet face for the last time. "Good-bye!" he whispered to that dear sight,
  "Good-bye!"</p>

  <p>And then in silence he turned away from her.</p>

  <p>She could hear his slow retreating footsteps, and something in the rhythm
  of them threw her into a passion of weeping.</p>

  <p>He walked away.</p>

  <p>He had fully meant to go to a lonely place where the meadows were
  beautiful with white narcissus, and there remain until the hour of his
  sacrifice should come, but as he walked he lifted up his eyes and saw the
  morning, the morning like an angel in golden armour, marching down the
  steeps...</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that before this splendour he and this blind world in the
  valley, and his love and all, were no more than a pit of sin.</p>

  <p>He did not turn aside as he had meant to do, but went on and passed
  through the wall of the circumference and out upon the rocks, and his eyes
  were always upon the sunlit ice and snow.</p>

  <p>He saw their infinite beauty, and his imagination soared over them to the
  things beyond he was now to resign for ever!</p>

  <p>He thought of that great free world that he was parted from, the world
  that was his own, and he had a vision of those further slopes, distance
  beyond distance, with Bogota, a place of multitudinous stirring beauty, a
  glory by day, a luminous mystery by night, a place of palaces and fountains
  and statues and white houses, lying beautifully in the middle distance. He
  thought how for a day or so one might come down through passes drawing ever
  nearer and nearer to its busy streets and ways. He thought of the river
  journey, day by day, from great Bogota to the still vaster world beyond,
  through towns and villages, forest and desert places, the rushing river day
  by day, until its banks receded, and the big steamers came splashing by and
  one had reached the sea&mdash;the limitless sea, with its thousand islands,
  its thousands of islands, and its ships seen dimly far away in their
  incessant journeyings round and about that greater world. And there, unpent
  by mountains, one saw the sky&mdash;the sky, not such a disc as one saw it
  here, but an arch of immeasurable blue, a deep of deeps in which the circling
  stars were floating...</p>

  <p>His eyes scrutinised the great curtain of the mountains with a keener
  inquiry.</p>

  <p>For example; if one went so, up that gully and to that chimney there, then
  one might come out high among those stunted pines that ran round in a sort of
  shelf and rose still higher and higher as it passed above the gorge. And
  then? That talus might be managed. Thence perhaps a climb might be found to
  take him up to the precipice that came below the snow; and if that chimney
  failed, then another farther to the east might serve his purpose better. And
  then? Then one would be out upon the amber-lit snow there, and halfway up to
  the crest of those beautiful desolations. And suppose one had good
  fortune!</p>

  <p>He glanced back at the village, then turned right round and regarded it
  with folded arms.</p>

  <p>He thought of Medina-sarote, and she had become small and remote.</p>

  <p>He turned again towards the mountain wall down which the day had come to
  him.</p>

  <p>Then very circumspectly he began his climb.</p>

  <p>When sunset came he was no longer climbing, but he was far and high. His
  clothes were torn, his limbs were blood-stained, he was bruised in many
  places, but he lay as if he were at his ease, and there was a smile on his
  face.</p>

  <p>From where he rested the valley seemed as if it were in a pit and nearly a
  mile below. Already it was dim with haze and shadow, though the mountain
  summits around him were things of light and fire. The mountain summits around
  him were things of light and fire, and the little things in the rocks near at
  hand were drenched with light and beauty, a vein of green mineral piercing
  the grey, a flash of small crystal here and there, a minute, minutely
  beautiful orange lichen close beside his face. There were deep, mysterious
  shadows in the gorge, blue deepening into purple, and purple into a luminous
  darkness, and overhead was the illimitable vastness of the sky. But he heeded
  these things no longer, but lay quite still there, smiling as if he were
  content now merely to have escaped from the Valley of the Blind, in which he
  had thought to be King. And the glow of the sunset passed, and the night
  came, and still he lay there, under the cold, clear stars.</p>

     name="story66">THE EMPIRE OF THE ANTS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, December 1905</h3>

  <h2>I</h2>

  <p>When Captain Gerilleau received instructions to take his new gunboat, the
  Benjamin Constant, to Badama on the Batemo arm of the Guaramadema and there
  assist the inhabitants against a plague of ants, he suspected the authorities
  of mockery. His promotion had been romantic and irregular, the affections of
  a prominent Brazilian lady and the captain's liquid eyes had played a part in
  the process, and the Diario and O Futuro had been lamentably disrespectful in
  their comments. He felt he was to give further occasion for disrespect.</p>

  <p>He was a Creole, his conceptions of etiquette and discipline were pure-
  blooded Portuguese, and it was only to Holroyd, the Lancashire engineer, who
  had come over with the boat, and as an exercise in the use of
  English&mdash;his "th" sounds were very uncertain&mdash;that he opened his
  heart.</p>

  <p>"It is in effect," he said, "to make me absurd! What can a man do against
  ants? Dey come, dey go."</p>

  <p>"They say," said Holroyd, "that these don't go. That chap you said was a
  Sambo&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Zambo&mdash;it is a sort of mixture of blood."</p>

  <p>"Sambo. He said the people are going!"</p>

  <p>The captain smoked fretfully for a time. "Dese things 'ave to happen," he
  said at last. "What is it? Plagues of ants and suchlike as God wills. Dere
  was a plague in Trinidad&mdash;the like ants that carry leaves. Orl der
  oranges-trees, all der mangoes! What does it matter? Sometimes ant armies
  come into your houses&mdash;fighting ants; a different sort. You go and they
  clean the house. Then you come back again;&mdash;the house is clean, like
  new! No cockroaches, no fleas, no jiggers in the floor."</p>

  <p>"That Sambo chap," said Holroyd, "says these are a different sort of
  ant."</p>

  <p>The captain shrugged his shoulders, fumed, and gave his attention to a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>Afterwards he reopened the subject. "My dear 'Olroyd, what am I to do
  about des infernal ants?"</p>

  <p>The captain reflected. "It is ridiculous," he said. But in the afternoon
  he put on his full uniform and went ashore, and jars and boxes came back to
  the ship and subsequently he did. And Holroyd sat on deck in evening coolness
  and smoked profoundly and marvelled at Brazil. They were six days up the
  Amazon, some hundreds of miles from the ocean, and east and west of him there
  was horizon like the sea, and to the south nothing but a sand-bank island
  with some tufts of scrub. The water was always running like a sluice, thick
  with dirt, animated with crocodiles and hovering birds, and fed by some
  inexhaustible source of tree trunks; and the waste of it, the headlong waste
  of it, filled his soul. The town of Alemquer, with it's meagre church, it's
  thatched sheds for houses, it's discoloured ruins of ampler days, seemed a
  little thing lost in this wilderness of Nature, a sixpence dropped on Sahara.
  He was a young man, this was his first site of the tropics, he came straight
  from England, where Nature is hedged, ditched, and drained into the
  perfection of submission, and he had suddenly discovered the insignificance
  of man. For six days they had been steaming up the sea by unfrequented
  channels, and man had been as rare as a rare butterfly. One saw one day a
  canoe, another day a distant station, the next no men at all. He began to
  perceive that man is indeed a rare animal, having but a precarious hold upon
  this land.</p>

  <p>He perceived it more clearly as the days passed, and he made his devious
  way to the Batemo, in the company of this remarkable commander, who ruled
  over one big gun, and was forbidden to waste his ammunition. Holroyd was
  learning Spanish industriously, but he was still in the present tense and
  substantive stage of speech, and the only other person who had any words of
  English was a negro stoker, who had them all wrong. The second in command was
  a Portuguese, da Cunha, who spoke French, but it was a different sort of
  French from the French Holroyd had learned in Southport, and their
  intercourse was confined to politenesses and simple propositions about
  weather. And the weather, like everything else in this amazing new world, the
  weather had no human aspect, and was hot by night and hot by day, and the air
  steam, even the wind was hot steam, smelling of vegetation in decay: and the
  alligators and the strange birds, the flies of many sorts and sizes, the
  beetles, the ants, the snakes and monkeys seemed to wonder what man was doing
  in an atmosphere that had no gladness in its sunshine and no coolness in its
  night. To wear clothing was intolerable, but to cast it aside was to scorch
  by day, and expose an ampler area to the mosquitoes by night; to go on deck
  by day was to be blinded by glare and to stay below was to suffocate. And in
  the daytime came certain flies, extremely clever and noxious about one's
  wrist and ankle. Captain Gerilleau, who was Holroyd's sole distraction from
  these physical distresses, developed into a formidable bore, telling the
  simple story of his heart's affections day by day, a string of anonymous
  women, as if he was telling beads. Sometimes he suggested sport, and they
  shot at alligators, and at rare intervals they came to human aggregations in
  the waste of trees, and stayed for a day or so, and drank and sat about; and
  one night, danced with Creole girls, who found Holroyd's poor elements of
  Spanish, without either past tence or future, amply sufficient for their
  purposes. But these were mere luminous chinks in the long grey passage of the
  streaming river, up which the throbbing engines beat. A certain liberal
  heathen deity, in the shape of demi-john, held seductive court aft, and it is
  probable, forward.</p>

  <p>But Gerilleau learned things about the ants, more things and more, at this
  stopping-place and that, and became interested in his mission.</p>

  <p>"Dey are a new sort of ant," he said. "We have got to be&mdash;what do you
  call it&mdash;? Entomologie? Big. Five centimetres! Some bigger! It is
  ridiculous. We are like monkeys&mdash;sent to pick insects... But dey are
  eating up the country."</p>

  <p>He burst out indignantly. "Suppose&mdash;suddenly, there are complications
  with Europe. Here am I&mdash;son we shall be above the Rio Negro&mdash;and my
  gun, useless!"</p>

  <p>He nursed his knee and mused.</p>

  <p>"Dose people who were dere at de dancing place, dey 'ave come down. Dey
  'ave lost all they got. De ants come to deir house one afternoon. Everyone
  run out. You know when de ants come one must&mdash;every one runs out and
  they go over the house. If you stayed they'd eat you. See? Well, presently
  dey go back; dey say, 'The ants 'ave gone...' De ants 'aven't gone. Dey try
  to go in&mdash;de son, 'e gose in. De ants fight."</p>

  <p>"Swarm over him?"</p>

  <p>"Bite 'im. Presently he comes out again&mdash;screaming and running. He
  runs past them to river. See? He get into de water and drowns de
  ants&mdash;yes." Gerilleau paused, brought his liquid eyes close to Holroyd's
  face, tapped Holroyd's knee with his knuckle. "That night he dies, just as if
  he was stung by snake."</p>

  <p>Poisoned&mdash;by the ants?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows?" Gerilleau shrugged his shoulders, "Perhaps they bit him
  badly... When I joined dis service I joined to fight men. Dese things, dese
  ants, dey come and go. It is no business for men."</p>

  <p>After that he talked frequently of ants to Holroyd, and whenever they
  chanced to drift against any speck of humanity in that waste of water and
  sunshine and distant trees, Holroyd's improving knowledge of the language
  enabled him to recognise the ascendant word Sauba, more and more completely
  dominating the whole.</p>

  <p>He perceived the ants were becoming interesting, and the nearer he drew to
  them the more interesting they became. Gerilleau abandoned his old themes
  almost suddenly, and the Portuguese lieutenant became a conversational
  figure; he knew something about the leaf-cutting ant, and expanded his
  knowledge. Gerilleau sometimes rendered what he had to tell to Holroyd. He
  told of the little workers that swarm and fight, and the big workers that
  command and rule, and how these latter always crawled to the neck and how
  their bites drew blood. He told how they cut leaves and made fungus beds, and
  how their nests in Caracas are sometimes a hundred yards across. Two days the
  three men spent disputing whether ants have eyes. The discussion grew
  dangerously heated on the second afternoon, and Holroyd saved the situation
  by going ashore in a boat to catch ants and see. He captured various
  specimens and returned and some had eyes and some hadn't. Also, they argued,
  do ants bite or sting?</p>

  <p>"Dese ants," said Gerilleau, after collecting information at a rancho,
  "have big eyes. They don't run about blind&mdash;not as most ants do. No! Dey
  get in corners and watch what you do."</p>

  <p>"And they sting?" asked Holroyd.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Dey sting. Dere is poison in the sting." He meditated. "I do not see
  what men can do against ants. Dey come and go."</p>

  <p>"But these don't go."</p>

  <p>"They will," said Gerilleau.</p>

  <p>Past Tamandu there is a long low coast of eighty miles without any
  population, and then ones comes to the confluence of the main river and the
  Batemo arm, like a great lake, and then the forest came nearer, came at last
  intimately near. The character of the channel changes, snags abound, and the
  Benjamin Constant moored by a cable that night, under the very shadow of dark
  trees. For the first time for many days came a spell of coolness, and Holroyd
  and Gerilleau sat late, smoking cigars and enjoying this delicious sensation.
  Gerilleau's mind was full of ants and what they could do. He decided to sleep
  at last, and lay down on a mattress on deck, a man hopelessly perplexed; his
  last words, when he already seemed asleep, were to ask, with a flourish of
  despair: "What can one do with ants...? De whole thing is absurd."</p>

  <p>Holroyd was left to scratch his bitten wrists, and meditate alone.</p>

  <p>He sat on the bulwark and listened to changes in Gerilleau's breathing
  until he was fast asleep, and then the ripple and lap of stream took his
  mind, and brought back that sense of immensity that had been growing upon him
  since first he had left Para and come up the river. The monitor showed but
  one small light, and there was first a little talking forward and then
  stillness. His eyes went from the dim black outlines of the middle works of
  the gunboat towards the bank, to the black overwhelming mysteries of forest,
  lit now and then by a fire-fly, and never still from the murmur of alien and
  mysterious activities...</p>

  <p>It was the inhuman immensity of this land that astonished and oppressed
  him. He knew the skies were empty of men, the stars were specks in an
  incredible vastness of space; he knew the ocean was enormous and untamable,
  but in England he had come to think of the land as man's. In England it is
  indeed man's, the wild things live by sufferance, grow on lease, everywhere
  the roads, the fences, and absolute security runs. In an atlas, too, the land
  is man's, and all coloured to show his claim to it&mdash;in vivid contrast to
  the universal independent blueness of the sea. He had taken it for granted
  that a day would come when everywhere about the earth, plough and culture,
  light tramways, and good roads, an ordered security, would prevail. But now
  he doubted.</p>

  <p>This forest was interminable, it had an air of being invincible, and Man
  seemed at best an infrequent precarious intruder. One travelled for miles
  amidst the still silent struggle of giant trees, of strangulating creepers,
  of assertive flowers, everywhere the alligator, the turtle, and endless
  varieties of bird and insects seemed at home, dwelt irreplaceable&mdash;but
  man, man at most held a footing upon resentful clearings, fought weeds,
  fought beasts and insects for the barest foothold, fell a prey to snake and
  beast, insects and fever, and was presently carried away. In many places down
  the river he had been manifestly driven back, this deserted creek or that
  preserved the name of a casa, and here and there ruinous white walls and
  shattered towers enforced the lesson. The puma, the jaguar, were more the
  masters here...</p>

  <p>Who are the real masters?</p>

  <p>In a few miles of this forest there must be more ants than there are men
  in the world! This seemed to Holroyd a perfectly new idea. In a few thousand
  years men had emerged from barbarism to a stage of civilisation that made
  them feel lords of the future and masters of earth! But what was to prevent
  ants evolving also? Such ants as one knew lived in little communities of a
  few thousand individuals, made no concerted efforts against the greater
  world. But they had a language, they had an intelligence! Why should things
  stop at that any more then men had stopped at the barbaric stage? Suppose
  presently the ants began to store knowledge, just as men had done by means of
  books and records, use weapons, form great empires, sustain a planned and
  organised war?</p>

  <p>Things came back to him that Gerilleau had gathered about these ants they
  were approaching. They used a poison like the poison of snakes. They obeyed
  greater leaders even as the leaf-cutting ants do. They were carnivorous, and
  where they came they stayed...</p>

  <p>The forest was very still. The water lapped incessantly against the side.
  About the lantern overhead there eddied a noiseless whirl of phantom
  moths.</p>

  <p>Gerilleau stirred in the darkness and sighed. "What can one do?" he
  murmured, and turned over and was still again.</p>

  <p>Holroyd was roused from meditations that were becoming sinister by the hum
  of a mosquito.</p><br>

  <h2>II</h2>

  <p>The next morning Holroyd learned they were within forty kilometers of
  Badama, and his interest in the banks intensifies. He came up whenever an
  opportunity offered to examine his surroundings. He could see no signs of
  human occupation whatever, save for a weedy ruin of a house and green-stained
  facade of the long-deserted monastery at Moju, with a forest tree growing out
  of a vacant window space, and great creepers netted across it's vacant
  portals. Several flights of strange yellow butterflies with semi-transparent
  wings crossed the river that morning, and many alighted on the monitor and
  were killed by men. It was towards afternoon that they came upon the derelict
  cuberta.</p>

  <p>She did not at first appear to be derelict; both her sails were set and
  hanging slack in the afternoon calm, and there was the figure of a man
  sitting on the fore planking beside the shipped sweeps. Another man appeared
  to be sleeping face downwards on the sort of longitudinal bridge, these big
  canoes have in the waist. But it was presently apparent, from the sway of her
  rudder and the way she drifted into the course of the gunboat, that something
  was out of order with her. Gerilleau surveyed her through a field-glass, and
  became interested in queer darkness of the face of the sitting man, a
  red-faced man he seemed, without a nose&mdash;crouching he was rather then
  sitting, and the longer the captain looked the less he liked to look at him,
  and the less able he was to take his glasses away.</p>

  <p>But he did so at last, and went a little way to call up Holroyd. Then he
  went back to hail the cuberta. He hailed her again, and so she drove past
  him. Santa Rosa stood out clearly as her name.</p>

  <p>As she came by and into the wake of the monitor, she pitched a little, and
  suddenly the figure of the crouching man collapsed as though all it's joints
  had given way. His hat fell off, his head was not nice to look at, and his
  body flopped lax and rolled out of sight behind the bulwarks.</p>

  <p>"Caramba!" cried Gerilleau, and resorted to Holroyd forthwith.</p>

  <p>Holroyd was halfway up the companion. "Did you see dat?" said the
  captain.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" said Holroyd. "Yes. You'd better send a boat aboard. There's
  something wrong."</p>

  <p>"Did you&mdash;by any chance&mdash;see his face?"</p>

  <p>"What was it like?"</p>

  <p>"It was&mdash;ugh&mdash;! I have no words." And the captain suddenly
  turned his back on Holroyd and became a active and strident commander.</p>

  <p>The gunboat came about, steamed parallel to the erratic course of the
  canoe, and dropped the boat with Lieutenant da Cunha and three sailors to
  board her. Then the curiosity of the captain made him draw up almost
  alongside as the lieutenant got aboard, so that the whole of the Santa Rosa
  deck and hold, was visible to Holroyd.</p>

  <p>He saw now clearly that the sole crew of the vessel was these two dead
  men, and though he could not see their faces, he saw by their outstretched
  hands, which were all of ragged flesh, that they had been subjected to some
  strange exceptional process of decay. For a moment his attention,
  concentrated on these two enigmatical bundles of dirty cloths and laxly flung
  limbs, and then his eyes went forward to discover the open hold piled high
  with trunks and cases, and aft, to where the little cabin gaped inexplicably
  empty. Then he became aware that the planks of the middle decking were dotted
  with moving black specks.</p>

  <p>His attention was riveted by these specks. They were all walking in
  directions radiating from the fallen man in a manner&mdash;the image came
  unsought to his mind&mdash;like the crowd dispersing from a bull-fight.</p>

  <p>He became aware of Gerilleau beside him. "Capo," he said, "have you your
  glasses? Can you focus as closely as those planks there?"</p>

  <p>Gerilleau made an effort, grunted, and handed him the glasses.</p>

  <p>There followed a moment of scrutiny. "It's ants," said the Englishman, and
  handed the focused field-glasses back to Gerilleau.</p>

  <p>His impression of them was of a crowd of large black ants, very like
  ordinary ants except for size, and for the fact some of the larger of them
  bore a sort of clothing of grey. But at the time his inspection was too brief
  for particulars. The head of Lieutenant da Cunha appeared over the side of
  the cuberta, and a brief colloquy ensued.</p>

  <p>"You must go aboard," said Gerilleau.</p>

  <p>The lieutenant objected that the boat was full of ants.</p>

  <p>"You have your boots," said Gerilleau.</p>

  <p>The lieutenant changed the subject. "How did these men die?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Captain Gerilleau embarked upon speculation that Holroyd could not follow,
  and the two men disputed with a certain vehemence. Holroyd took up the
  field-glass and resumed his scrutiny, first of ants and then of the dead man
  amidships.</p>

  <p>He has described these ants to me very particularly.</p>

  <p>He says they were as large as any ants he has ever seen, black and moving
  with a steady deliberation very different from the mechanical fussiness of
  the common ant. About one in twenty was much larger than it's fellows, and
  with an exceptionally large head. These reminded him at once of the master
  workers who are said to rule over the leaf-cutter ants; like them they seemed
  to be directing and co-ordinating the general movements. They tilted their
  bodies back in a manner altogether singular, as if they made some use of the
  fore feet. And he had a curious fancy, that he was too far off to verify,
  that most of these ants of both kinds were wearing accoutrements, had things
  strapped about their bodies by bright white bands like white metal
  threads...</p>

  <p>He put down the glasses abruptly, realising that the question of
  discipline between the captain and his subordinate had become acute.</p>

  <p>"It is your duty," said the captain, "to go aboard. It is my
  instructions."</p>

  <p>The lieutenant seemed on the verge of refusing. The head of one of the
  mulatto sailors appeared beside him.</p>

  <p>"I believe these men were killed by ants," said Holroyd abruptly in
  English.</p>

  <p>The captain burst into rage. He made no answer to Holroyd. "I have
  commanded you to go aboard," he screamed to his subordinate in Portuguese.
  "If you do not go aboard forthwith it is mutiny&mdash;rank mutiny. Mutiny and
  cowardice! Where is the courage that should animate us? I will have you in
  irons, I will have you shot like a dog." He began a torrent of abuse and
  curses, he danced to and fro. He shook his fists, he behaved as if beside
  himself with rage, and the lieutenant, white and still, stood looking at him.
  The crew appeared forward, with amazed faces.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, in a pause of this outbreak, the lieutenant came to some heroic
  decision, saluted, drew himself together and clambered upon the deck of the
  cuberta.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Gerilleau, and his mouth shut like a trap. Holroyd saw the ants
  retreating before da Cunha's boots. The Portuguese walked slowly to the
  fallen man, stooped down, hesitated, clutched his coat and turned him over. A
  black swarm of ants rushed out of the clothes, and da Cunha stepped back very
  quickly and trod two or three times on the deck.</p>

  <p>Holroyd put up the glasses. He saw the scattered ants about the invader's
  feet, and doing what he had never seen ants doing before. They had nothing of
  the blind movements of the common ant; they were looking at him&mdash;as a
  rallying crowd of men might look at some gigantic monster that had dispersed
  it.</p>

  <p>"How did he die?" the captain shouted.</p>

  <p>Holroyd understood the Portuguese to say the body was too much eaten to
  tell.</p>

  <p>"What is there forward?" asked Gerilleau.</p>

  <p>The lieutenant walked a few paces, and began his answer in Portuguese. He
  stopped abruptly and beat off something from his leg. He made some peculiar
  steps as if he was trying to stamp on something invisible, and went quickly
  towards the side. Then he controlled himself, turned about, walked
  deliberately forward to the hold, clambered up to the fore decking, from
  which the sweeps are worked, stooped for a time over the second man, groaned
  audibly, and made his way back and aft to the cabin; moving very rigidly. He
  turned and began a conversation with his captain, cold and respectful in tone
  on either side, contrasting vividly with the wrath and insult of a few
  moments before. Holroyd gathered only fragments of it's purport.</p>

  <p>He reverted to the field-glass, and was surprised to find the ants had
  vanished from all exposed surfaces of the deck. He turned towards the shadow
  beneath the decking, and it seemed to him they were full of watching
  eyes.</p>

  <p>The cuberta, it was agreed, was derelict, but too full of ants to put men
  aboard to sit and sleep: it must be towed. The lieutenant went forward to
  take in and adjust the cable, and the men in the boat stood up to be ready to
  help him. Holroyd's glasses searched the canoe.</p>

  <p>He became more and more impressed by the fact that a great if minute and
  furtive activity was going on. He perceived that a number of gigantic ants
  &mdash;they seemed nearly a couple of inches in length&mdash;carrying oddly-
  shaped burthens for which he could imagine no use&mdash;were moving in rushes
  from one point of obscurity to another. They did not move in columns across
  the exposed places, but in open, spaced-out lines, oddly suggestive of the
  rushes of modern infantry advancing under fire. A number were taking cover
  under the dead man's clothes, and a perfect swarm was gathering along the
  side over which da Cunha must presently go.</p>

  <p>He did not see them actually rush for the lieutenant as he returned, but
  he has no doubt they did make a concerted rush. Suddenly the lieutenant was
  shouting and cursing and beating at his legs. "I'm stung!" he shouted, with a
  face of hate and accusation towards Gerilleau.</p>

  <p>Then he vanished over the side, dropped into his boat, and plunged at once
  into the water. Holroyd heard the splash.</p>

  <p>The three men in the boat pulled him out and brought him aboard, and that
  night he died.</p><br>

  <h2>III</h2>

  <p>Holroyd and the captain came out of the cabin in which the swollen and
  contorted body of the lieutenant lay, and stood together at the stern of the
  monitor, staring at the sinister vessel they trailed behind them. It was a
  close, dark night that had only phantom flickers of sheet lightning to
  illuminate it. The cuberta, a vague black triangle, rocked about in the
  steamer's wake, her sails bobbing and flapping, and the black smoke from the
  funnels, spark-lit ever and again, streamed over her swaying masts.</p>

  <p>Gerilleau's mind was inclined to run on the unkind things the lieutenant
  had said in the heat of his last fever.</p>

  <p>"He says I murdered 'im," he protested. "It is simply absurd. Someone 'ad
  to go aboard. Are we to run away from these confounded ants whenever they
  show up?"</p>

  <p>Holroyd said nothing. He was thinking of a disciplined rush of little
  black shapes across bare sunlit planking.</p>

  <p>"It was his place to go," harped Gerilleau. "He died in the execution of
  his duty. What has he to complain of? Murdered...! But the poor fellow was
  &mdash;what is it&mdash;? Demented. He was not in his right mind. The poison
  swelled him... U'm."</p>

  <p>They came to a long silence.</p>

  <p>"We will sink that canoe&mdash;burn it."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>The inquiry irritated Gerilleau. His shoulders went up, his hands flew out
  at right angles from his body. "What is one to do?" he said, his voice going
  up to an angry squeak.</p>

  <p>"Anyhow," he broke out vindictively, "every ant in dat cuberta&mdash;! I
  will burn dem alive!"</p>

  <p>Holroyd was not moved to conversation. A distant ululation of howling
  monkeys filled the sultry night with foreboding sounds, and as the gunboat
  drew near the black mysterious banks this was reinforced by a depressing
  clamour of frogs.</p>

  <p>"What is one to do?" the captain repeated after a vast interval, and
  suddenly becoming active and savage and blasphemous, decided to burn the
  Santa Rosa without further delay. Everyone aboard was pleased by that idea,
  everyone helped with zest; they pulled in the cable, cut it, and dropped the
  boat and fired her with tow and kerosene, and soon the cuberta was crackling
  and flaring merrily amidst the immensities of the tropical night. Holroyd
  watched the mounting yellow flare against the blackness, and the livid
  flashes of sheet lightning that came and went above the forest summits,
  throwing them into momentary silhouette, and his stoker stood behind him
  watching also.</p>

  <p>The stoker was stirred to the depths of his linguistics. "Sauba go pop,
  pop," he said. "Wahaw!" and laughed richly.</p>

  <p>But Holroyd was thinking that these little creatures on the decked canoe
  had also eyes and brains.</p>

  <p>The whole thing impressed him as incredibly foolish and wrong, but
  &mdash;what was one to do? This question came back enormously reinforced on
  the morrow, when at last the gunboat reached Badama.</p>

  <p>This place, with its leaf-thatch-covered houses and sheds, its creeper-
  invaded sugar-mill, its little jetty of timber and canes, was very still in
  the morning heat, and showed never a sign of living men. Whatever ants there
  were at that distance were too small to see.</p>

  <p>"All the people have gone," said Gerilleau, "but we will do one thing
  anyhow. We will 'oot and vissel."</p>

  <p>So Holroyd hooted and whistled.</p>

  <p>Then the captain fell into a doubting fit of the worst kind. "Dere is one
  thing we can do," he said presently.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" said Holroyd.</p>

  <p>"'Oot and vissel again."</p>

  <p>So they did.</p>

  <p>The captain walked his deck and gesticulated to himself. He seemed to have
  many things on his mind. Fragments of speeches came from his lips. He
  appeared to be addressing some imaginary public tribunal either in Spanish or
  Portuguese. Holroyd's improving ear detected something about ammunition. He
  came out of these preoccupations suddenly into English. "My dear 'Olroyd!" he
  cried, and broke off with "But what can one do?"</p>

  <p>They took the boat and field-glasses, and went close in to examine the
  place. They made out a number of big ants, whose still postures had a certain
  effect of watching them, dotted about the edge of the rude embarkation jetty.
  Gerilleau tried ineffectual pistol shots at these. Holroyd thinks he
  distinguished curious earthworks running between the nearer houses, that may
  have been the work of insect conquerors of those human habitations. The
  explorers pulled past the jetty, and became aware of a human skeleton wearing
  a loin cloth, and very bright and clean and shining, lying beyond. They came
  to a pause regarding this...</p>

  <p>"I 'ave all dose lives to consider," said Gerilleau suddenly.</p>

  <p>Holroyd turned and stared at the captain, realising slowly that he
  referred to the unappetising mixture of races that constituted his crew.</p>

  <p>"To send a landing party&mdash;it is impossible&mdash;impossible. They
  will be poisoned, they will swell, they will swell up and abuse me and die.
  It is totally impossible... If we land, I must land alone, alone in thick
  boots and with my life in my hand. Perhaps I should live. Or again&mdash;I
  might not land. I do not know. I do not know."</p>

  <p>Holroyd thought he did, but he said nothing.</p>

  <p>"De whole thing," said Gerilleau suddenly, "'as been got up to make me
  ridiculous. De whole thing!"</p>

  <p>They paddled about and regarded the clean white skeleton from various
  points of view, and then they returned to the gunboat. Then Gerilleau's
  indecisions became terrible. Steam was got up, and in the afternoon the
  monitor went on up the river with an air of going to ask somebody something,
  and by sunset came back again, and anchored. A thunderstorm gathered and
  broke furiously, and then the night became beautifully cool and quiet and
  everyone slept on deck. Except Gerilleau, who tossed about and muttered. In
  the dawn he awakened Holroyd.</p>

  <p>"Lord!" said Holroyd, "what now?"</p>

  <p>"I have decided," said the captain.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;to land?" said Holroyd, sitting up brightly.</p>

  <p>"No!" said the captain, and was for a time very reserved. "I have
  decided," he repeated, and Holroyd manifested symptoms of impatience.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;yes," said the captain. "I shall fire de big gun!"</p>

  <p>And he did! Heaven knows what the ants thought of it, but he did. He fired
  it twice with great sternness and ceremony. All the crew had wadding in their
  ears, and there was effect of going into action about the whole affair, and
  first hit and wrecked the old sugar-mill, and then they smashed the abandoned
  store behind the jetty. And then Gerilleau experienced the inevitable
  reaction.</p>

  <p>"It is no good," he said to Holroyd; "no good at all. No sort of bally
  good. We must go back&mdash;for instructions. Dere will be de devil of a row
  about dis ammunition&mdash;oh! De devil of a row! You don't know,
  'Olroyd..."</p>

  <p>He stood regarding the world in infinite perplexity for a space.</p>

  <p>"But what else was there to do?" he cried.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon the monitor started down stream again, and in the evening
  a landing party took the body of the lieutenant and buried it on the bank
  upon which the new ants have so far not appeared...</p><br>

  <h2>IV</h2>

  <p>I heard this story in a fragmentary state from Holroyd not three weeks
  ago. These new ants have got into his brain, and he has come back to England
  with the idea, as he says, of "exciting people" about them "before it is too
  late." He says they threaten British Guiana, which cannot be much over a
  trifle of a thousand miles from their present sphere of activity, and that
  the Colonial Office ought to get to work upon them at once. He declaims with
  great passion: "These are intelligent ants. Just think what that means!"</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt they are a serious pest, and that the Brazilian
  Government is well advised in offering a prize of five hundred pounds for
  some effectual method of extirpation. It is certain too, that since they
  first appeared in the hills beyond Badama, about three years ago, they have
  achieved extraordinary conquests. The whole of the south bank of the Batemo
  River, for nearly sixty miles, they have in their effectual occupation; they
  have driven men out completely, occupied plantations and settlements, and
  boarded and captured at least one ship. It is even said they have in some
  inexplicable way bridged the very considerable Capuarana arm and pushed many
  miles towards the Amazon itself. There can be little doubt that they are far
  more reasonable and with a far better social organisation then any previously
  known ant species; instead of being dispersed societies they are organised
  into what is in effect a single nation; but their peculiar and immediate
  formidableness lies not so much in this as in the intelligent use they make
  of poison against their enemies. It would seem this poison of theirs is
  closely akin to snake poison, and it is highly probable they actually
  manufacture it, and that the larger individuals among them carry the
  needle-like crystals of it in their attacks upon men.</p>

  <p>Of course it is extremely difficult to get any detailed information about
  these new competitors for sovereignty of the globe. No eye-witnesses of their
  activity, except for such glimpses as Holroyd's, have survived the encounter.
  The most extraordinary legends of their prowess and capacity are in
  circulation in the region of the Upper Amazon, and grow daily as the steady
  advance of the invader stimulates men's imaginations through their fears.
  These strange little creatures are credited not only with the use of
  implements and knowledge of fire and metals and with organised feats of
  engineering that stagger our Northern minds&mdash;used as we are to such
  feats as that of the Saubas of Rio de Janeiro, who, in 1841, drove a tunnel
  under Parahyba, where it is as wide as the Thames at London Bridge&mdash;but
  with an organised and detailed method of record and communication analogous
  to our books. So far their action has been a steady progressive settlement,
  involving the flight or slaughter of every human being in the new areas they
  invade. They are increasing rapidly in numbers, and Holroyd at least is
  firmly convinced that they will finally dispossess man over the whole of
  tropical South America.</p>

  <p>And why should they stop at tropical South America?</p>

  <p>Well, there they are, anyhow. By 1911 or thereabouts, if they go on as
  they are going, they ought to strike the Capuarana Extension Railway, and
  force themselves upon the attention of the European capitalist.</p>

  <p>By 1920 they will be halfway down the Amazon. I fix 1950 or '60 at least
  for the discovery of Europe.</p>

     name="story67">THE DOOR IN THE WALL</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Daily Chronicle</i>, July 14, 1906</h3>

  <h2>I</h2>

  <p>One confidential evening, not three months ago, Lionel Wallace told me
  this story of the Door in the Wall. And at the time I thought that so far as
  he was concerned it was a true story.</p>

  <p>He told it me with such a direct simplicity of conviction that I could not
  do otherwise than believe in him. But in the morning, in my own flat, I woke
  to a different atmosphere, and as I lay in bed and recalled the things he had
  told me, stripped of the glamour of his earnest slow voice, denuded of the
  focussed shaded table light, the shadowy atmosphere that wrapped about him
  and the pleasant bright things, the dessert and glasses and napery of the
  dinner we had shared, making them for the time a bright little world quite
  cut off from every-day realities, I saw it all as frankly incredible. "He was
  mystifying!" I said, and then: "How well he did it!... It isn't quite the
  thing I should have expected him, of all people, to do well."</p>

  <p>Afterwards, as I sat up in bed and sipped my morning tea, I found myself
  trying to account for the flavour of reality that perplexed me in his
  impossible reminiscences, by supposing they did in some way suggest, present,
  convey&mdash;I hardly know which word to use&mdash;experiences it was
  otherwise impossible to tell.</p>

  <p>Well, I don't resort to that explanation now. I have got over my
  intervening doubts. I believe now, as I believed at the moment of telling,
  that Wallace did to the very best of his ability strip the truth of his
  secret for me. But whether he himself saw, or only thought he saw, whether he
  himself was the possessor of an inestimable privilege, or the victim of a
  fantastic dream, I cannot pretend to guess. Even the facts of his death,
  which ended my doubts forever, throw no light on that. That much the reader
  must judge for himself.</p>

  <p>I forget now what chance comment or criticism of mine moved so reticent a
  man to confide in me. He was, I think, defending himself against an
  imputation of slackness and unreliability I had made in relation to a great
  public movement in which he had disappointed me. But he plunged suddenly. "I
  have" he said, "a preoccupation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know," he went on, after a pause that he devoted to the study of his
  cigar ash, "I have been negligent. The fact is&mdash;it isn't a case of
  ghosts or apparitions&mdash;but&mdash;it's an odd thing to tell of, Redmond
  &mdash;I am haunted. I am haunted by something&mdash;that rather takes the
  light out of things, that fills me with longings ..."</p>

  <p>He paused, checked by that English shyness that so often overcomes us when
  we would speak of moving or grave or beautiful things. "You were at Saint
  Athelstan's all through," he said, and for a moment that seemed to me quite
  irrelevant. "Well"&mdash;and he paused. Then very haltingly at first, but
  afterwards more easily, he began to tell of the thing that was hidden in his
  life, the haunting memory of a beauty and a happiness that filled his heart
  with insatiable longings that made all the interests and spectacle of worldly
  life seem dull and tedious and vain to him.</p>

  <p>Now that I have the clue to it, the thing seems written visibly in his
  face. I have a photograph in which that look of detachment has been caught
  and intensified. It reminds me of what a woman once said of him&mdash;a woman
  who had loved him greatly. "Suddenly," she said, "the interest goes out of
  him. He forgets you. He doesn't care a rap for you&mdash;under his very nose
  ..."</p>

  <p>Yet the interest was not always out of him, and when he was holding his
  attention to a thing Wallace could contrive to be an extremely successful
  man. His career, indeed, is set with successes. He left me behind him long
  ago; he soared up over my head, and cut a figure in the world that I couldn't
  cut&mdash;anyhow. He was still a year short of forty, and they say now that
  he would have been in office and very probably in the new Cabinet if he had
  lived. At school he always beat me without effort&mdash;as it were by nature.
  We were at school together at Saint Athelstan's College in West Kensington
  for almost all our school time. He came into the school as my co-equal, but
  he left far above me, in a blaze of scholarships and brilliant performance.
  Yet I think I made a fair average running. And it was at school I heard first
  of the Door in the Wall&mdash;that I was to hear of a second time only a
  month before his death.</p>

  <p>To him at least the Door in the Wall was a real door leading through a
  real wall to immortal realities. Of that I am now quite assured.</p>

  <p>And it came into his life early, when he was a little fellow between five
  and six. I remember how, as he sat making his confession to me with a slow
  gravity, he reasoned and reckoned the date of it. "There was," he said, "a
  crimson Virginia creeper in it&mdash;all one bright uniform crimson in a
  clear amber sunshine against a white wall. That came into the impression
  somehow, though I don't clearly remember how, and there were horse-chestnut
  leaves upon the clean pavement outside the green door. They were blotched
  yellow and green, you know, not brown nor dirty, so that they must have been
  new fallen. I take it that means October. I look out for horse-chestnut
  leaves every year, and I ought to know.</p>

  <p>"If I'm right in that, I was about five years and four months old."</p>

  <p>He was, he said, rather a precocious little boy&mdash;he learned to talk
  at an abnormally early age, and he was so sane and "old-fashioned," as people
  say, that he was permitted an amount of initiative that most children
  scarcely attain by seven or eight. His mother died when he was born, and he
  was under the less vigilant and authoritative care of a nursery governess.
  His father was a stern, preoccupied lawyer, who gave him little attention,
  and expected great things of him. For all his brightness he found life a
  little grey and dull I think. And one day he wandered.</p>

  <p>He could not recall the particular neglect that enabled him to get away,
  nor the course he took among the West Kensington roads. All that had faded
  among the incurable blurs of memory. But the white wall and the green door
  stood out quite distinctly.</p>

  <p>As his memory of that remote childish experience ran, he did at the very
  first sight of that door experience a peculiar emotion, an attraction, a
  desire to get to the door and open it and walk in.</p>

  <p>And at the same time he had the clearest conviction that either it was
  unwise or it was wrong of him&mdash;he could not tell which&mdash;to yield to
  this attraction. He insisted upon it as a curious thing that he knew from the
  very beginning&mdash;unless memory has played him the queerest trick
  &mdash;that the door was unfastened, and that he could go in as he chose.</p>

  <p>I seem to see the figure of that little boy, drawn and repelled. And it
  was very clear in his mind, too, though why it should be so was never
  explained, that his father would be very angry if he went through that
  door.</p>

  <p>Wallace described all these moments of hesitation to me with the utmost
  particularity. He went right past the door, and then, with his hands in his
  pockets, and making an infantile attempt to whistle, strolled right along
  beyond the end of the wall. There he recalls a number of mean, dirty shops,
  and particularly that of a plumber and decorator, with a dusty disorder of
  earthenware pipes, sheet lead ball taps, pattern books of wall paper, and
  tins of enamel. He stood pretending to examine these things, and coveting,
  passionately desiring the green door.</p>

  <p>Then, he said, he had a gust of emotion. He made a run for it, lest
  hesitation should grip him again, he went plump with outstretched hand
  through the green door and let it slam behind him. And so, in a trice, he
  came into the garden that has haunted all his life.</p>

  <p>It was very difficult for Wallace to give me his full sense of that garden
  into which he came.</p>

  <p>There was something in the very air of it that exhilarated, that gave one
  a sense of lightness and good happening and well being; there was something
  in the sight of it that made all its colour clean and perfect and subtly
  luminous. In the instant of coming into it one was exquisitely glad&mdash;as
  only in rare moments and when one is young and joyful one can be glad in this
  world. And everything was beautiful there...</p>

  <p>Wallace mused before he went on telling me. "You see," he said, with the
  doubtful inflection of a man who pauses at incredible things, "there were two
  great panthers there...Yes, spotted panthers. And I was not afraid. There was
  a long wide path with marble-edged flower borders on either side, and these
  two huge velvety beasts were playing there with a ball. One looked up and
  came towards me, a little curious as it seemed. It came right up to me,
  rubbed its soft round ear very gently against the small hand I held out and
  purred. It was, I tell you, an enchanted garden. I know. And the size? Oh! it
  stretched far and wide, this way and that. I believe there were hills far
  away. Heaven knows where West Kensington had suddenly got to. And somehow it
  was just like coming home.</p>

  <p>"You know, in the very moment the door swung to behind me, I forgot the
  road with its fallen chestnut leaves, its cabs and tradesmen's carts, I
  forgot the sort of gravitational pull back to the discipline and obedience of
  home, I forgot all hesitations and fear, forgot discretion, forgot all the
  intimate realities of this life. I became in a moment a very glad and
  wonder-happy little boy&mdash;in another world. It was a world with a
  different quality, a warmer, more penetrating and mellower light, with a
  faint clear gladness in its air, and wisps of sun-touched cloud in the
  blueness of its sky. And before me ran this long wide path, invitingly, with
  weedless beds on either side, rich with untended flowers, and these two great
  panthers. I put my little hands fearlessly on their soft fur, and caressed
  their round ears and the sensitive corners under their ears, and played with
  them, and it was as though they welcomed me home. There was a keen sense of
  home-coming in my mind, and when presently a tall, fair girl appeared in the
  pathway and came to meet me, smiling, and said 'Well?' to me, and lifted me,
  and kissed me, and put me down, and led me by the hand, there was no
  amazement, but only an impression of delightful rightness, of being reminded
  of happy things that had in some strange way been overlooked. There were
  broad steps, I remember, that came into view between spikes of delphinium,
  and up these we went to a great avenue between very old and shady dark trees.
  All down this avenue, you know, between the red chapped stems, were marble
  seats of honour and statuary, and very tame and friendly white doves...</p>

  <p>"And along this avenue my girl-friend led me, looking down&mdash;I recall
  the pleasant lines, the finely-modelled chin of her sweet kind face
  &mdash;asking me questions in a soft, agreeable voice, and telling me things,
  pleasant things I know, though what they were I was never able to recall ...
  And presently a little Capuchin monkey, very clean, with a fur of ruddy brown
  and kindly hazel eyes, came down a tree to us and ran beside me, looking up
  at me and grinning, and presently leapt to my shoulder. So we went on our way
  in great happiness ..."</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"Go on," I said.</p>

  <p>"I remember little things. We passed an old man musing among laurels, I
  remember, and a place gay with paroquets, and came through a broad shaded
  colonnade to a spacious cool palace, full of pleasant fountains, full of
  beautiful things, full of the quality and promise of heart's desire. And
  there were many things and many people, some that still seem to stand out
  clearly and some that are a little vague, but all these people were beautiful
  and kind. In some way&mdash;I don't know how&mdash;it was conveyed to me that
  they all were kind to me, glad to have me there, and filling me with gladness
  by their gestures, by the touch of their hands, by the welcome and love in
  their eyes. Yes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He mused for awhile. "Playmates I found there. That was very much to me,
  because I was a lonely little boy. They played delightful games in a grass-
  covered court where there was a sun-dial set about with flowers. And as one
  played one loved...</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;it's odd&mdash;there's a gap in my memory. I don't remember the
  games we played. I never remembered. Afterwards, as a child, I spent long
  hours trying, even with tears, to recall the form of that happiness. I wanted
  to play it all over again&mdash;in my nursery&mdash;by myself. No! All I
  remember is the happiness and two dear playfellows who were most with me ...
  Then presently came a sombre dark woman, with a grave, pale face and dreamy
  eyes, a sombre woman wearing a soft long robe of pale purple, who carried a
  book and beckoned and took me aside with her into a gallery above a hall
  &mdash;though my playmates were loth to have me go, and ceased their game and
  stood watching as I was carried away. 'Come back to us!' they cried. 'Come
  back to us soon!' I looked up at her face, but she heeded them not at all.
  Her face was very gentle and grave. She took me to a seat in the gallery, and
  I stood beside her, ready to look at her book as she opened it upon her knee.
  The pages fell open. She pointed, and I looked, marvelling, for in the living
  pages of that book I saw myself; it was a story about myself, and in it were
  all the things that had happened to me since ever I was born...</p>

  <p>"It was wonderful to me, because the pages of that book were not pictures,
  you understand, but realities."</p>

  <p>Wallace paused gravely&mdash;looked at me doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Go on," I said. "I understand."</p>

  <p>"They were realities&mdash;yes, they must have been; people moved and
  things came and went in them; my dear mother, whom I had near forgotten; then
  my father, stern and upright, the servants, the nursery, all the familiar
  things of home. Then the front door and the busy streets, with traffic to and
  fro: I looked and marvelled, and looked half doubtfully again into the
  woman's face and turned the pages over, skipping this and that, to see more
  of this book, and more, and so at last I came to myself hovering and
  hesitating outside the green door in the long white wall, and felt again the
  conflict and the fear.</p>

  <p>"'And next?' I cried, and would have turned on, but the cool hand of the
  grave woman delayed me.</p>

  <p>"'Next?' I insisted, and struggled gently with her hand, pulling up her
  fingers with all my childish strength, and as she yielded and the page came
  over she bent down upon me like a shadow and kissed my brow.</p>

  <p>"But the page did not show the enchanted garden, nor the panthers, nor the
  girl who had led me by the hand, nor the playfellows who had been so loth to
  let me go. It showed a long grey street in West Kensington, on that chill
  hour of afternoon before the lamps are lit, and I was there, a wretched
  little figure, weeping aloud, for all that I could do to restrain myself, and
  I was weeping because I could not return to my dear play-fellows who had
  called after me, 'Come back to us! Come back to us soon!' I was there. This
  was no page in a book, but harsh reality; that enchanted place and the
  restraining hand of the grave mother at whose knee I stood had
  gone&mdash;whither have they gone?"</p>

  <p>He halted again, and remained for a time, staring into the fire.</p>

  <p>"Oh! the wretchedness of that return!" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Well?" I said after a minute or so.</p>

  <p>"Poor little wretch I was&mdash;brought back to this grey world again! As
  I realised the fulness of what had happened to me, I gave way to quite
  ungovernable grief. And the shame and humiliation of that public weeping and
  my disgraceful homecoming remain with me still. I see again the
  benevolent-looking old gentleman in gold spectacles who stopped and spoke to
  me&mdash;prodding me first with his umbrella. 'Poor little chap,' said he;
  'and are you lost then?'&mdash;and me a London boy of five and more! And he
  must needs bring in a kindly young policeman and make a crowd of me, and so
  march me home. Sobbing, conspicuous and frightened, I came from the enchanted
  garden to the steps of my father's house.</p>

  <p>"That is as well as I can remember my vision of that garden&mdash;the
  garden that haunts me still. Of course, I can convey nothing of that
  indescribable quality of translucent unreality, that difference from the
  common things of experience that hung about it all; but that&mdash;that is
  what happened. If it was a dream, I am sure it was a day-time and altogether
  extraordinary dream .....H'm!&mdash;naturally there followed a terrible
  questioning, by my aunt, my father, the nurse, the governess&mdash;everyone
  ....</p>

  <p>"I tried to tell them, and my father gave me my first thrashing for
  telling lies. When afterwards I tried to tell my aunt, she punished me again
  for my wicked persistence. Then, as I said, everyone was forbidden to listen
  to me, to hear a word about it. Even my fairy tale books were taken away from
  me for a time&mdash;because I was 'too imaginative.' Eh? Yes, they did that!
  My father belonged to the old school...And my story was driven back upon
  myself. I whispered it to my pillow&mdash;my pillow that was often damp and
  salt to my whispering lips with childish tears. And I added always to my
  official and less fervent prayers this one heartfelt request: 'Please God I
  may dream of the garden. Oh! take me back to my garden! Take me back to my
  garden!'</p>

  <p>"I dreamt often of the garden. I may have added to it, I may have changed
  it; I do not know...All this you understand is an attempt to reconstruct from
  fragmentary memories a very early experience. Between that and the other
  consecutive memories of my boyhood there is a gulf. A time came when it
  seemed impossible I should ever speak of that wonder glimpse again."</p>

  <p>I asked an obvious question.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "I don't remember that I ever attempted to find my way back
  to the garden in those early years. This seems odd to me now, but I think
  that very probably a closer watch was kept on my movements after this
  misadventure to prevent my going astray. No, it wasn't until you knew me that
  I tried for the garden again. And I believe there was a
  period&mdash;incredible as it seems now&mdash;when I forgot the garden
  altogether&mdash;when I was about eight or nine it may have been. Do you
  remember me as a kid at Saint Athelstan's?"</p>

  <p>"Rather!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't show any signs did I in those days of having a secret
  dream?"</p>

  <h2>II</h2>

  <p>He looked up with a sudden smile.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever play North-West Passage with me?...No, of course you didn't
  come my way!"</p>

  <p>"It was the sort of game," he went on, "that every imaginative child plays
  all day. The idea was the discovery of a North-West Passage to school. The
  way to school was plain enough; the game consisted in finding some way that
  wasn't plain, starting off ten minutes early in some almost hopeless
  direction, and working one's way round through unaccustomed streets to my
  goal. And one day I got entangled among some rather low-class streets on the
  other side of Campden Hill, and I began to think that for once the game would
  be against me and that I should get to school late. I tried rather
  desperately a street that seemed a cul de sac, and found a passage at the
  end. I hurried through that with renewed hope. 'I shall do it yet,' I said,
  and passed a row of frowsy little shops that were inexplicably familiar to
  me, and behold! there was my long white wall and the green door that led to
  the enchanted garden!</p>

  <p>"The thing whacked upon me suddenly. Then, after all, that garden, that
  wonderful garden, wasn't a dream!"...</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"I suppose my second experience with the green door marks the world of
  difference there is between the busy life of a schoolboy and the infinite
  leisure of a child. Anyhow, this second time I didn't for a moment think of
  going in straight away. You see... For one thing my mind was full of the idea
  of getting to school in time&mdash;set on not breaking my record for
  punctuality. I must surely have felt <i>some</i> little desire at least to
  try the door&mdash;yes, I must have felt that...But I seem to remember the
  attraction of the door mainly as another obstacle to my overmastering
  determination to get to school. I was immediately interested by this
  discovery I had made, of course&mdash;I went on with my mind full of
  it&mdash;but I went on. It didn't check me. I ran past tugging out my watch,
  found I had ten minutes still to spare, and then I was going downhill into
  familiar surroundings. I got to school, breathless, it is true, and wet with
  perspiration, but in time. I can remember hanging up my coat and hat...Went
  right by it and left it behind me. Odd, eh?"</p>

  <p>He looked at me thoughtfully. "Of course, I didn't know then that it
  wouldn't always be there. School boys have limited imaginations. I suppose I
  thought it was an awfully jolly thing to have it there, to know my way back
  to it, but there was the school tugging at me. I expect I was a good deal
  distraught and inattentive that morning, recalling what I could of the
  beautiful strange people I should presently see again. Oddly enough I had no
  doubt in my mind that they would be glad to see me... Yes, I must have
  thought of the garden that morning just as a jolly sort of place to which one
  might resort in the interludes of a strenuous scholastic career.</p>

  <p>"I didn't go that day at all. The next day was a half holiday, and that
  may have weighed with me. Perhaps, too, my state of inattention brought down
  impositions upon me and docked the margin of time necessary for the detour. I
  don't know. What I do know is that in the meantime the enchanted garden was
  so much upon my mind that I could not keep it to myself.</p>

  <p>"I told&mdash;What was his name?&mdash;a ferrety-looking youngster we used
  to call Squiff."</p>

  <p>"Young Hopkins," said I.</p>

  <p>"Hopkins it was. I did not like telling him, I had a feeling that in some
  way it was against the rules to tell him, but I did. He was walking part of
  the way home with me; he was talkative, and if we had not talked about the
  enchanted garden we should have talked of something else, and it was
  intolerable to me to think about any other subject. So I blabbed.</p>

  <p>"Well, he told my secret. The next day in the play interval I found myself
  surrounded by half a dozen bigger boys, half teasing and wholly curious to
  hear more of the enchanted garden. There was that big Fawcett&mdash;you
  remember him?&mdash;and Carnaby and Morley Reynolds. You weren't there by any
  chance? No, I think I should have remembered if you were...</p>

  <p>"A boy is a creature of odd feelings. I was, I really believe, in spite of
  my secret self-disgust, a little flattered to have the attention of these big
  fellows. I remember particularly a moment of pleasure caused by the praise of
  Crawshaw&mdash;you remember Crawshaw major, the son of Crawshaw the
  composer?&mdash;who said it was the best lie he had ever heard. But at the
  same time there was a really painful undertow of shame at telling what I felt
  was indeed a sacred secret. That beast Fawcett made a joke about the girl in
  green&mdash;."</p>

  <p>Wallace's voice sank with the keen memory of that shame. "I pretended not
  to hear," he said. "Well, then Carnaby suddenly called me a young liar and
  disputed with me when I said the thing was true. I said I knew where to find
  the green door, could lead them all there in ten minutes. Carnaby became
  outrageously virtuous, and said I'd have to&mdash;and bear out my words or
  suffer. Did you ever have Carnaby twist your arm? Then perhaps you'll
  understand how it went with me. I swore my story was true. There was nobody
  in the school then to save a chap from Carnaby though Crawshaw put in a word
  or so. Carnaby had got his game. I grew excited and red-eared, and a little
  frightened, I behaved altogether like a silly little chap, and the outcome of
  it all was that instead of starting alone for my enchanted garden, I led the
  way presently&mdash;cheeks flushed, ears hot, eyes smarting, and my soul one
  burning misery and shame&mdash;for a party of six mocking, curious and
  threatening school-fellows.</p>

  <p>"We never found the white wall and the green door ..."</p>

  <p>"You mean?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I mean I couldn't find it. I would have found it if I could.</p>

  <p>"And afterwards when I could go alone I couldn't find it. I never found
  it. I seem now to have been always looking for it through my school-boy days,
  but I've never come upon it again."</p>

  <p>"Did the fellows&mdash;make it disagreeable?"</p>

  <p>"Beastly...Carnaby held a council over me for wanton lying. I remember how
  I sneaked home and upstairs to hide the marks of my blubbering. But when I
  cried myself to sleep at last it wasn't for Carnaby, but for the garden, for
  the beautiful afternoon I had hoped for, for the sweet friendly women and the
  waiting playfellows and the game I had hoped to learn again, that beautiful
  forgotten game...</p>

  <p>"I believed firmly that if I had not told&mdash;... I had bad times after
  that&mdash;crying at night and woolgathering by day. For two terms I
  slackened and had bad reports. Do you remember? Of course you would! It was
  <i>you</i>&mdash;your beating me in mathematics that brought me back to the
  grind again."</p>

  <h2>III</h2>

  <p>For a time my friend stared silently into the red heart of the fire. Then
  he said: "I never saw it again until I was seventeen.</p>

  <p>"It leapt upon me for the third time&mdash;as I was driving to Paddington
  on my way to Oxford and a scholarship. I had just one momentary glimpse. I
  was leaning over the apron of my hansom smoking a cigarette, and no doubt
  thinking myself no end of a man of the world, and suddenly there was the
  door, the wall, the dear sense of unforgettable and still attainable
  things.</p>

  <p>"We clattered by&mdash;I too taken by surprise to stop my cab until we
  were well past and round a corner. Then I had a queer moment, a double and
  divergent movement of my will: I tapped the little door in the roof of the
  cab, and brought my arm down to pull out my watch. 'Yes, sir!' said the
  cabman, smartly. 'Er&mdash;well&mdash;it's nothing,' I cried. '<i>My</i>
  mistake! We haven't much time! Go on!' and he went on...</p>

  <p>"I got my scholarship. And the night after I was told of that I sat over
  my fire in my little upper room, my study, in my father's house, with his
  praise&mdash;his rare praise&mdash;and his sound counsels ringing in my ears,
  and I smoked my favourite pipe&mdash;the formidable bulldog of
  adolescence&mdash;and thought of that door in the long white wall. 'If I had
  stopped,' I thought, 'I should have missed my scholarship, I should have
  missed Oxford&mdash;muddled all the fine career before me! I begin to see
  things better!' I fell musing deeply, but I did not doubt then this career of
  mine was a thing that merited sacrifice.</p>

  <p>"Those dear friends and that clear atmosphere seemed very sweet to me,
  very fine, but remote. My grip was fixing now upon the world. I saw another
  door opening&mdash;the door of my career."</p>

  <p>He stared again into the fire. Its red lights picked out a stubborn
  strength in his face for just one flickering moment, and then it vanished
  again.</p>

  <p>"Well", he said and sighed, "I have served that career. I have done
  &mdash;much work, much hard work. But I have dreamt of the enchanted garden a
  thousand dreams, and seen its door, or at least glimpsed its door, four times
  since then. Yes&mdash;four times. For a while this world was so bright and
  interesting, seemed so full of meaning and opportunity that the half-effaced
  charm of the garden was by comparison gentle and remote. Who wants to pat
  panthers on the way to dinner with pretty women and distinguished men? I came
  down to London from Oxford, a man of bold promise that I have done something
  to redeem. Something&mdash;and yet there have been disappointments...</p>

  <p>"Twice I have been in love&mdash;I will not dwell on that&mdash;but once,
  as I went to someone who, I know, doubted whether I dared to come, I took a
  short cut at a venture through an unfrequented road near Earl's Court, and so
  happened on a white wall and a familiar green door. 'Odd!' said I to myself,
  'but I thought this place was on Campden Hill. It's the place I never could
  find somehow&mdash;like counting Stonehenge&mdash;the place of that queer day
  dream of mine.' And I went by it intent upon my purpose. It had no appeal to
  me that afternoon.</p>

  <p>"I had just a moment's impulse to try the door, three steps aside were
  needed at the most&mdash;though I was sure enough in my heart that it would
  open to me&mdash;and then I thought that doing so might delay me on the way
  to that appointment in which I thought my honour was involved. Afterwards I
  was sorry for my punctuality&mdash;I might at least have peeped in I thought,
  and waved a hand to those panthers, but I knew enough by this time not to
  seek again belatedly that which is not found by seeking. Yes, that time made
  me very sorry...</p>

  <p>"Years of hard work after that and never a sight of the door. It's only
  recently it has come back to me. With it there has come a sense as though
  some thin tarnish had spread itself over my world. I began to think of it as
  a sorrowful and bitter thing that I should never see that door again. Perhaps
  I was suffering a little from overwork&mdash;perhaps it was what I've heard
  spoken of as the feeling of forty. I don't know. But certainly the keen
  brightness that makes effort easy has gone out of things recently, and that
  just at a time with all these new political developments&mdash;when I ought
  to be working. Odd, isn't it? But I do begin to find life toilsome, its
  rewards, as I come near them, cheap. I began a little while ago to want the
  garden quite badly. Yes&mdash;and I've seen it three times."</p>

  <p>"The garden?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;the door! And I haven't gone in!"</p>

  <p>He leaned over the table to me, with an enormous sorrow in his voice as he
  spoke. "Thrice I have had my chance&mdash;<i>thrice</i>! If ever that door
  offers itself to me again, I swore, I will go in out of this dust and heat,
  out of this dry glitter of vanity, out of these toilsome futilities. I will
  go and never return. This time I will stay...I swore it and when the time
  came &mdash;<i>I didn't go.</i></p>

  <p>"Three times in one year have I passed that door and failed to enter.
  Three times in the last year.</p>

  <p>"The first time was on the night of the snatch division on the Tenants'
  Redemption Bill, on which the Government was saved by a majority of three.
  You remember? No one on our side&mdash;perhaps very few on the opposite side
  &mdash;expected the end that night. Then the debate collapsed like eggshells.
  I and Hotchkiss were dining with his cousin at Brentford, we were both
  unpaired, and we were called up by telephone, and set off at once in his
  cousin's motor. We got in barely in time, and on the way we passed my wall
  and door&mdash;livid in the moonlight, blotched with hot yellow as the glare
  of our lamps lit it, but unmistakable. 'My God!' cried I. 'What?'said
  Hotchkiss. 'Nothing!' I answered, and the moment passed.</p>

  <p>"'I've made a great sacrifice,' I told the whip as I got in. 'They all
  have,' he said, and hurried by.</p>

  <p>"I do not see how I could have done otherwise then. And the next occasion
  was as I rushed to my father's bedside to bid that stern old man farewell.
  Then, too, the claims of life were imperative. But the third time was
  different; it happened a week ago. It fills me with hot remorse to recall it.
  I was with Gurker and Ralphs&mdash;it's no secret now you know that I've had
  my talk with Gurker. We had been dining at Frobisher's, and the talk had
  become intimate between us. The question of my place in the reconstructed
  ministry lay always just over the boundary of the discussion. Yes&mdash;yes.
  That's all settled. It needn't be talked about yet, but there's no reason to
  keep a secret from you...Yes&mdash;thanks! thanks! But let me tell you my
  story.</p>

  <p>"Then, on that night things were very much in the air. My position was a
  very delicate one. I was keenly anxious to get some definite word from
  Gurker, but was hampered by Ralphs' presence. I was using the best power of
  my brain to keep that light and careless talk not too obviously directed to
  the point that concerns me. I had to. Ralphs' behaviour since has more than
  justified my caution...Ralphs, I knew, would leave us beyond the Kensington
  High Street, and then I could surprise Gurker by a sudden frankness. One has
  sometimes to resort to these little devices... And then it was that in the
  margin of my field of vision I became aware once more of the white wall, the
  green door before us down the road.</p>

  <p>"We passed it talking. I passed it. I can still see the shadow of Gurker's
  marked profile, his opera hat tilted forward over his prominent nose, the
  many folds of his neck wrap going before my shadow and Ralphs' as we
  sauntered past.</p>

  <p>"I passed within twenty inches of the door. 'If I say good-night to them,
  and go in,' I asked myself, 'what will happen?' And I was all a-tingle for
  that word with Gurker.</p>

  <p>"I could not answer that question in the tangle of my other problems.
  'They will think me mad,' I thought. 'And suppose I vanish now!&mdash;Amazing
  disappearance of a prominent politician!' That weighed with me. A thousand
  inconceivably petty worldlinesses weighed with me in that crisis."</p>

  <p>Then he turned on me with a sorrowful smile, and, speaking slowly; "Here I
  am!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Here I am!" he repeated, "and my chance has gone from me. Three times in
  one year the door has been offered me&mdash;the door that goes into peace,
  into delight, into a beauty beyond dreaming, a kindness no man on earth can
  know. And I have rejected it, Redmond, and it has gone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I know. I know. I am left now to work it out, to stick to the tasks that
  held me so strongly when my moments came. You say, I have success&mdash;this
  vulgar, tawdry, irksome, envied thing. I have it." He had a walnut in his big
  hand. "If that was my success," he said, and crushed it, and held it out for
  me to see.</p>

  <p>"Let me tell you something, Redmond. This loss is destroying me. For two
  months, for ten weeks nearly now, I have done no work at all, except the most
  necessary and urgent duties. My soul is full of inappeasable regrets. At
  nights&mdash;when it is less likely I shall be recognised&mdash;I go out. I
  wander. Yes. I wonder what people would think of that if they knew. A Cabinet
  Minister, the responsible head of that most vital of all departments,
  wandering alone&mdash;grieving&mdash;sometimes near audibly
  lamenting&mdash;for a door, for a garden!"</p>

  <h2>IV</h2>

  <p>I can see now his rather pallid face, and the unfamiliar sombre fire that
  had come into his eyes. I see him very vividly to-night. I sit recalling his
  words, his tones, and last evening's Westminster Gazette still lies on my
  sofa, containing the notice of his death. At lunch to-day the club was busy
  with him and the strange riddle of his fate.</p>

  <p>They found his body very early yesterday morning in a deep excavation near
  East Kensington Station. It is one of two shafts that have been made in
  connection with an extension of the railway southward. It is protected from
  the intrusion of the public by a hoarding upon the high road, in which a
  small doorway has been cut for the convenience of some of the workmen who
  live in that direction. The doorway was left unfastened through a
  misunderstanding between two gangers, and through it he made his way...</p>

  <p>My mind is darkened with questions and riddles.</p>

  <p>It would seem he walked all the way from the House that night&mdash;he has
  frequently walked home during the past Session&mdash;and so it is I figure
  his dark form coming along the late and empty streets, wrapped up, intent.
  And then did the pale electric lights near the station cheat the rough
  planking into a semblance of white? Did that fatal unfastened door awaken
  some memory?</p>

  <p>Was there, after all, ever any green door in the wall at all?</p>

  <p>I do not know. I have told his story as he told it to me. There are times
  when I believe that Wallace was no more than the victim of the coincidence
  between a rare but not unprecedented type of hallucination and a careless
  trap, but that indeed is not my profoundest belief. You may think me
  superstitious if you will, and foolish; but, indeed, I am more than half
  convinced that he had in truth, an abnormal gift, and a sense,
  something&mdash;I know not what&mdash;that in the guise of wall and door
  offered him an outlet, a secret and peculiar passage of escape into another
  and altogether more beautiful world. At any rate, you will say, it betrayed
  him in the end. But did it betray him? There you touch the inmost mystery of
  these dreamers, these men of vision and the imagination.</p>

  <p>We see our world fair and common, the hoarding and the pit. By our
  daylight standard he walked out of security into darkness, danger and death.
  But did he see like that?</p>

     name="story68">THE BEAUTIFUL SUIT</a></h2>

  <h3>First published as "A Moonlight Fable" in <i>Collier's Weekly</i>, April
  10, 1909</h3>

  <p>There was once a little man whose mother made him a beautiful suit of
  clothes. It was green and gold, and woven so that I can not describe how
  delicate and fine it was, and there was a tie of orange fluffiness that tied
  up under his chin. And the buttons in their newness shone like stars. He was
  proud and pleased by his suit beyond measure, and stood before the long
  looking-glass when first he put it on, so astonished and delighted with it
  that he could hardly turn himself away.</p>

  <p>He wanted to wear it everywhere, and show it to all sorts of people. He
  thought over all the places he had ever visited, and all the scenes he had
  ever heard described, and tried to imagine what the feel of it would be if he
  were to go now to those scenes and places wearing his shining suit, and he
  wanted to go out forthwith into the long grass and hot sunshine of the meadow
  wearing it. Just to wear it! But his mother told him "No," She told him he
  must take great care of his suit, for never would he have another nearly so
  fine; he must save it and save it, and only wear it on rare great occasions.
  It was his wedding-suit, she said. And she took the buttons and twisted them
  up with tissue paper for fear their bright newness should be tarnished, and
  she tacked little guards over the cuffs and elbows, and wherever the suit was
  most likely to come to harm. He hated and resisted these things, but what
  could he do? And at last her warnings and persuasions had effect, and he
  consented to take off his beautiful suit and fold it into its proper creases,
  and put it away. It was almost as though he gave it up again. But he was
  always thinking of wearing it, and of the supreme occasions when some day it
  might be worn without the guards, without the tissue paper on the buttons,
  utterly and delightfully, never caring, beautiful beyond measure.</p>

  <p>One night, when he was dreaming of it after his habit, he dreamt he took
  the tissue paper from one of the buttons, and found its brightness a little
  faded, and that distressed him mightily in his dream. He polished the poor
  faded button and polished it, and if anything, it grew duller. He woke up and
  lay awake, thinking of the brightness slightly dulled, and wondering how he
  would feel if perhaps when the great occasions (whatever it might be) should
  arrive, one button should chance to be ever so little short of its first
  glittering freshness, and for days and days that thought remained with him
  distressingly. And when next his mother let him wear his suit, he was tempted
  and nearly gave way to the temptation just to fumble off a bit of tissue
  paper and see if indeed the buttons were keeping as bright as ever.</p>

  <p>He went trimly along on his way to church, full of this wild desire. For
  you must know his mother did, with repeated and careful warnings, let him
  wear his suit at times, on Sundays, for example, to and fro from church, when
  there was no threatening of rain, no dust blowing, nor anything to injure it,
  with its buttons covered and its protections tacked upon it, and a sunshade
  in his hand to shadow it, if there seemed too strong a sunlight for its
  colours. And always, after such occasions, he brushed it over and folded it
  exquisitely as she had taught him, and put it away again.</p>

  <p>Now all these restrictions his mother set to the wearing of his suit he
  obeyed, always he obeyed them, until one strange night he woke up and saw the
  moonlight shining outside his window. It seemed to him the moonlight was not
  common moonlight, nor the night a common night, and for a while he lay quite
  drowsily, with this odd persuasion in his mind. Thought joined on to thought
  like things that whisper warmly in the shadows. Then he sat up in his little
  bed suddenly very alert, with his heart beating very fast, and a quiver in
  his body from top to toe. He had made up his mind. He knew that now he was
  going to wear his suit as it should be worn. He had no doubt in the matter.
  He was afraid, terribly afraid, but glad, glad.</p>

  <p>He got out of his bed and stood for a moment by the window looking at the
  moonshine-flooded garden, and trembling at the thing he ment to do. The air
  was full of a minute clamour of crickets and murmurings, of the infinitesimal
  shouting of little living things. He went very gently across the creaking
  boards, for fear that he might wake the sleeping house, to the big dark
  clothes-press wherein his beautiful suit lay folded, and he took it out
  garment by garment, and softly and very eagerly tore off its tissue-paper
  covering and its tacked protections until there it was, perfect and
  delightful as he had seen it when first his mother had given it to
  him&mdash;a long time it seemed ago. Not a button had tarnished, not a thread
  had faded on this dear suit of his; he was glad enough for weeping, as in a
  noiseless hurry he put it on. And then back he went, soft and quick, to the
  window that looked out upon the garden, and stood there for a minute, shining
  in the moonlight, with his buttons twinkling like stars, before he got out on
  the sill, and making as little of a rustling as he could, clambered down to
  the garden path below. He stood before his mother's house, and it was white
  and nearly as plain as by day, with every window-blind but his own shut like
  an eye that sleeps. The trees cast still shadows like intricate black lace
  upon the wall.</p>

  <p>The garden in the moonlight was very different from the garden by day;
  moonshine was tangled in hedges and stretched in phantom cobwebs from spray
  to spray. Every flower was gleaming white or crimson black, and the air was
  a-quiver with the thridding of small crickets and nightingales singing unseen
  in the depths of the trees.</p>

  <p>There was no darkness in the world, but only warm, mysterious shadows, and
  all the leaves and spikes were edged and lined with iridescent jewels of dew.
  The night was warmer than any other night had ever been; the heavens by some
  miracle at once vaster and nearer, and in spite of the great ivory-tinted
  moon that ruled the world, the sky was full of stars.</p>

  <p>The little man did not shout nor sing for all his infinite gladness. He
  stood for a time like one awe-stricken, and then with a queer small cry and
  holding out his arms, he ran out as if he would embrace at once the whole
  round immensity of the world. He did not follow the neat set paths that cut
  the garden squarely, but thrust across the beds and through the wet, tall,
  scented herbs, though the night-stock and the nicotine and the clusters of
  phantom white mallow flowers and through the thickets of southernwood and
  lavender, and knee-deep across a wide space of mignonette. He came to the
  great hedge, and he thrust his way through it; and though the thorns of the
  brambles scored him deeply and tore threads from his wonderful suit, and
  though burrs and goose-grass and havers caught and clung to him, he did not
  care. He did not care, for he knew it was all part of the wearing for which
  he had longed. "I am glad I put on my suit," he said; "I am glad I wore my
  suit."</p>

  <p>Beyond the hedge he came to the duck-pond, or at least to what was the
  duck-pond by day. But by night it was a great bowl of silver moonshine all
  noisy with singing frogs, of wonderful silver moonshine twisted and clotted
  with strange patternings, and the little man ran down into its waters between
  the thin black rushes, knee-deep and waist-deep and to his shoulders, smiting
  the water to black and shining wavelets with either hand, swaying and
  shivering wavelets, amidst which the stars were netted in the tangled
  reflections of the brooding trees upon the bank. He waded until he swam, and
  so he crossed the pond and came out upon the other side, trailing, as it
  seemed to him, not duckweed, but very silver in long, clinging, dripping
  masses. And up he went through the transfigured tangles of the willow-herb
  and the uncut seeding grasses of the farther bank. He came glad and
  breathless into the high road. "I am glad," he said, "beyond measure, that I
  had clothes that fitted this occasion."</p>

  <p>The high-road ran straight as an arrow flies, straight into the deep-blue
  pit of the sky beneath the moon, a white and shining road between the singing
  nightingales, and along it he went, running now and leaping, and now walking
  and rejoicing, in the clothes his mother had made for him with tireless,
  loving hands. The road was deep in dust, but that for him was only soft
  whiteness; and as he went a great dim moth came fluttering round his wet and
  shimmering and hastening figure. At first he did not heed the moth, and then
  he waved his hands at it, and made a sort of dance with it, as it circled
  round his head. "Soft moth!" he cried, "Dear moth! And wonderful night,
  wonderful night of the world! Do you think my clothes are beautiful, dear
  moth? As beautiful as your scales and all this silver vesture of the earth
  and sky?"</p>

  <p>And the moth circled closer and closer until at last its velvet wings just
  brushed his lips...</p>

  <p>And next morning they found him dead, with his neck broken, in the bottom
  of the stone pit, with his beautiful clothes a little bloody, and foul and
  stained with the duckweed from the pond. But his face was a face of such
  happiness that, had you seen it, you would have understood indeed how that he
  had died happy, never knowing that cool and streaming silver for the duckweed
  in the pond.</p>

     name="story69">MY FIRST AEROPLANE &mdash; "ALAUDA MAGNA"</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, January 1910</h3>

  <p>My first aeroplane! What vivid memories of youth that recalls!</p>

  <p>Far back it was in the spring of 1912 that I acquired "Alauda Magna," the
  great Lark, for so I christened her; and I was then a slender young man of
  four-and-twenty, with hair&mdash;beautiful blond hair&mdash;all over my
  adventurous young head. I was a dashing young fellow enough, in spite of the
  slight visual defect that obliged me to wear spectacles on my prominent,
  aquiline, but by no means shapeless nose&mdash;the typical flyer's nose. I
  was a good runner and swimmer, a vegetarian as ever, an all-wooler, and an
  ardent advocate of the extremist views in every direction about everything.
  Precious little in the way of a movement got started that I wasn't in. I
  owned two motor-bicycles, and an enlarged photograph of me at that remote
  date, in leather skull-cap, goggles, and gauntlets, still adorns my study
  fireplace. I was also a great flyer of war-kites, and voluntary scout-master
  of high repute. From the first beginnings of the boom in flying, therefore, I
  was naturally eager for the fray.</p>

  <p>I chafed against the tears of my widowed mother for a time, and at last
  told her I could endure it no longer. "If I am not the first to fly in
  Mintonchester," I said, "I leave Mintonchester. I'm your own son mummy, and
  that's me!"</p>

  <p>And it didn't take me a week to place my order when she agreed.</p>

  <p>I found one of the old price-lists the other day in a drawer, full of
  queer woodcuts of still queerer contrivances. What a time that was! An
  incredulous world had at last consented to believe that it could fly, and in
  addition to the motor-car people and the bicycle people, and so on, a hundred
  new, unheard-of firms were turning out aeroplanes of every size and pattern
  to meet the demand. Amazing prices they got for them, too&mdash;three hundred
  and fifty was cheap for the things! I find four hundred and fifty, five
  hundred, five hundred guineas in this list of mine; and many as capable of
  flight as oak trees! They were sold too, without any sort of guarantee, and
  with merest apology for instructions. Some of the early aeroplane companies
  paid nearly 200 per cent on their ordinary shares in those early years.</p>

  <p>How well I remember the dreams I had&mdash;and the doubts!</p>

  <p>The dreams were all of wonder in the air. I saw myself raising gracefully
  from my mother's paddock, clearing the hedge at the end, circling up to get
  over the vicar's pear trees, and away between the church steeple and the rise
  of Withycombe, towards the market-place. Lord! How they would stare to see
  me! "Young Mr. Betts again!" they would say. "We knew he'd do it."</p>

  <p>I would circle and perhaps wave a handkerchief, and then I meant to go
  over Lupton's gardens to the grounds of Sir Digby Foster. There a certain
  fair denizen might glance from the window...</p>

  <p>Ah, youth! Youth!</p>

  <p>My doubts were all of the make I should adopt, the character of engines I
  should choose...</p>

  <p>I remember my wild rush on my motor-bike to London to see the things and
  give my order, the day of muddy-traffic dodging as I went from one shop to
  another, my growing exasperation at hearing everywhere the same refrain,
  "Sold out! Can't undertake to deliver before the beginning of April."</p>

  <p>Not me!</p>

  <p>I got "Alauda Magna" at last at a little place in Blackfriars Road. She
  was an order thrown on the firm's hands at the eleventh hour by the death of
  the purchaser through another maker, and I ran my modest bank account into an
  overdraft to get her&mdash;to this day I won't confess the price I paid for
  her. Poor little Mumsy! Within a week she was in my mother's paddock, being
  put together after transport by a couple of not-too-intelligent
  mechanics.</p>

  <p>The joy of it! And a sort of adventurous tremulousness. I'd had no
  lessons&mdash;all the qualified teachers were booked up at stupendous fees
  for months ahead; but it wasn't in my quality to stick at a thing like that!
  I couldn't have endured three day's delay. I assured my mother I had, had
  lessons, for her peace of mind&mdash;it is a poor son who will not tell a lie
  to keep his parent happy.</p>

  <p>I remember the exultant turmoil of walking round the thing as it grew into
  a credible shape, with the consciousness of half Mintonchester peering at me
  though the hedge, and only deterred by our new trespass-board and the
  disagreeable expression of Snape, our trusted gardener, who was partly mowing
  the grass and partly on sentry-go with his scythe, from swarming into the
  meadow. I lit a cigarette and watched the workmen sagely, and we engaged an
  elderly unemployed named Snorticombe to keep watch all night to save the
  thing from meddlers. In those days, you must understand, an aeroplane was a
  sign and a wonder.</p>

  <p>"Alauda Magna" was a darling for her time, though nowadays I suppose she
  would be received with derisive laughter by every schoolboy in the land. She
  was a monoplane, and roughly speaking, a Bleriot, and she had the dearest,
  neatest seven-cylinder forty horse-power G.K.C. engine, with its G.B.S. fly-
  wheel, that you can possibly imagine. I spent an hour or so tuning her up
  &mdash;she had a deafening purr, rather like a machine-gun in
  action&mdash;until the vicar sent round to say that he was writing a sermon
  upon "Peace" and was unable to concentrate his mind on that topic until I
  desisted. I took his objection in good part, and after a culminating volley
  and one last lingering look, started for a stroll round the town.</p>

  <p>In spite of every endeavour to be modest I could not but feel myself the
  cynosure of every eye. I had rather carelessly forgotten to change my
  leggings and breeches I had bought for the occasion, and I was also wearing
  my leather skull-cap with ear-flaps carelessly adjusted, so that I could hear
  what people were saying. I should think I had half the population under
  fifteen at my heels before I was halfway down the High Street.</p>

  <p>"You going to fly, Mr. Betts?" says one cheeky youngster.</p>

  <p>"Like a bird!" I said.</p>

  <p>"Don't you fly till we comes out of school," says another.</p>

  <p>It was a sort of Royal progress that evening for me. I visited old Lupton,
  the horticulturist, and he could hardly conceal what a great honour he
  thought it. He took me over his new greenhouse&mdash;he had now got, he said
  three acres of surface under glass&mdash;and showed me all sorts of clever
  dodges he was adopting in way of intensive culture, and afterwards we went
  down to the end of his old flower-garden and looked at his bees. When I came
  out my retinue of kids was still waiting for me, reinforced. Then I went
  round by Paramors and dropped into the Bull and Horses, just as if there
  wasn't anything particular up, for a lemon squash. Everybody was talking
  about my aeroplane. They just shut up for a moment when I came in, and then
  burst out with questions. It's odd nowadays to remember all that excitement.
  I answered what they had to ask me and refrained from putting on any side,
  and afterwards Miss Flyteman and I went into the commercial-room and turned
  over the pages of various illustrated journals and compared the pictures with
  my machine in a quite, unassuming sort of way. Everybody encouraged me to go
  up&mdash;everybody.</p>

  <p>I lay stress on that because, as I was soon to discover, the tides and
  ebbs of popular favour are among the most inexplicable and inconsistent
  things in the world.</p>

  <p>I particularly remember old Cheeseman, the pork-butcher, whose pigs I
  killed, saying over and over again, in a tone of perfect satisfaction, "You
  won't 'ave any difficulty in going up, you won't. There won't be any
  difficulty 'bout going up." And winking and nodding to the other eminent
  tradesmen there assembled.</p>

  <p>I hadn't much difficulty in going up. "Alauda Magna" was a cheerful
  lifter, and the roar and spin of her engine had hardly begun behind me before
  she was off her wheels&mdash;snap, snap, they came up above the ski gliders
  &mdash;and swaying swiftly across the meadows towards the vicarage hedge. She
  had a sort of onward roll to her, rather like the movement of a corpulent but
  very buoyant woman.</p>

  <p>I had just a glimpse of brave little mother, trying not to cry, and full
  of pride in me, on the veranda, with both the maids and old Snape beside her,
  and then I had to give all my attention to the steering-wheel if I didn't
  want to barge into the vicar's pear trees.</p>

  <p>I'd felt the faintest of tugs just as I came up, and fancied I heard a
  resounding whack on our new Trespassers will be Prosecuted board, and I saw
  the crowd of people in the lane running this way and that from my loud
  humming approach; but it was only after the flight was all over that I
  realised what that fool Snorticombe had been up to. It would seem he had
  thought the monster needed tethering&mdash;I won't attempt to explain the
  mysteries of his mind&mdash;and he had tied about a dozen yards of rope to
  the end of either wing and fixed them firmly to a couple of iron guy-posts
  that belonged properly to the Badminton net. Up they came at the tug of
  "Alauda," and they were trailing and dancing and leaping along behind me, and
  taking the most vicious dives and lunges at everything that came within range
  of them. Poor old Templecom got it hottest in the lane, I'm told&mdash;a
  frightful whack on his bald head; and then we ripped up the vicar's cucumber
  frames, killed and scattered his parrot, smashed the upper pane of his study
  window, and just missed the housemaid as she stuck her head out of the upper
  bedroom window. I didn't, of course, know anything of this at the
  time&mdash;it was on a lower plane altogether from my proceedings. I was
  steering past his vicarage&mdash;a narrow miss&mdash;and trying to come round
  to clear the pear trees at the end of the garden&mdash;which I did with a
  graze&mdash;and the trailers behind me sent leaves and branches flying this
  way and that. I had reason to thank Heaven for sturdy little G.K.C.'s.</p>

  <p>Then I was fairly up for a time.</p>

  <p>I found it much more confusing, than I had expected; the engine made such
  an infernal whir-r-row for one thing, and the steering tugged and struggled
  like a thing alive. But I got her heading over the market-place all right. We
  buzzed over Stunt's the greengrocer, and my trailers hopped up his back
  premises and made a sanguinary mess of the tiles on his roof, and sent an
  avalanche of broken chimney-pot into the crowded street below. Then the thing
  dipped&mdash;I supposed one of the guy-posts tried to anchor for a second in
  Stunt's rafters&mdash;and I had the hardest job to clear the Bull and Horses
  stables. I didn't, as a matter of fact, completely clear them. The ski-like
  alighting runners touched the ridge for a moment and the left wing bent
  against the top of the chimney-stack and floundered over it in an awkward,
  destructive manner.</p>

  <p>I'm told that my trailers whirled about the crowded market-place in the
  most diabolical fashion as I dipped and recovered, but I'm inclined to think
  all this part of the story has been greatly exaggerated. Nobody was killed,
  and I couldn't have been half a minute form the time I appeared over Stunt's
  to the time when I slid off the stable roof and among Lupton's glass. If
  people had taken reasonable care of themselves instead of gaping at me, they
  wouldn't have got hurt. I had enough to do without pointing out to people
  that they were likely to be hit by an iron guy-post which had seen fit to
  follow me. If anyone ought to have warned them it was that fool Snorticombe.
  Indeed, what with the incalculable damage done to the left wing and one of
  the cylinders getting out of rhythm and making an ominous catch in the whirr,
  I was busy enough for anything on my own private personal account.</p>

  <p>I suppose I am in manner of speaking responsible for knocking old Dudney
  off the station bus, but I don't see that I can be held answerable for
  subsequent evolutions of the bus, which ended after a charge among the market
  stalls in Cheeseman's shop-window, nor do I see that I am to blame because an
  idle and ill-disciplined crowd chose to stampede across a stock of carelessly
  distributed earthenware and overturn a butter stall. I was a mere excuse for
  all this misbehaviour.</p>

  <p>I didn't exactly fall into Lupton's glass, and I didn't exactly drive over
  it. I think ricochetting describes my passage across his premises as well an
  any single word can.</p>

  <p>It was the queerest sensation, being carried along by this big, buoyant
  thing, which had, as it were, bolted with me, and feeling myself alternately
  lifted up and then dropped with a scrunch upon a fresh greenhouse-roof, in
  spite of all my efforts to control. And the infinite relief when at last, at
  the fifth or sixth pounce, I rose&mdash;and kept on rising!</p>

  <p>I seemed to forget everything disagreeable instantly. The doubt whether
  after all "Alauda Magna" was good for flying vanished. She was evidently very
  good. We whirred over the wall at the end, with my trailers still bumping
  behind, and beyond one of them hitting a cow, which died next day, I don't
  think I did the slightest damage to anything or anybody all across the
  breadth of Cheeseman's meadow. Then I began to rise, steadily but surely, and
  getting the thing well in hand, came swooping round over his piggeries to
  give Mintonchester a second taste of my quality.</p>

  <p>I meant to go up in a spiral until I was clear of all the trees and things
  and circle about the church spire. Hitherto I had been so concentrated on
  plunges and tugs of the monster I was driving and so deafened by the uproar
  of my engine, that I had noticed little of the things that were going on
  below; but now I could make out a little lot of people headed by Lupton with
  a garden fork, rushing obliquely across the corner of Cheeseman's meadow. It
  puzzled me for a second to imagine what they could think they were after.</p>

  <p>Up I went, whirring and swaying, and presently got a glimpse down the High
  Street of the awful tangle everything had got into in the market-place. I
  didn't at the time connect that extraordinary smash-up with my transit.</p>

  <p>It was the jar of my whack against the weathercock that really stopped my
  engines. I've never been able to make out quite how it was I hit the
  unfortunate vane; perhaps the twist I had given my left wing on Stunt's roof
  spoilt my steering; but anyhow, I hit the gaudy thing and bent it, and for a
  lengthy couple of seconds I wasn't by any means sure whether I wasn't going
  to dive straight down into the market-place. I got her right by a supreme
  effort&mdash;I think the people I didn't smash might have squeezed out one
  drop of gratitude for that&mdash;drove pitching at the tree-tops of
  Withycombe, got round, and realised the engines were stopping. There wasn't
  any time to survey the country and arrange for suitable landing place; there
  wasn't any chance of clearing the course. It wasn't my fault if a quarter of
  the population of Mintonchester was swarming out over Cheeseman's meadows. It
  was the only chance I had to land without a smash, and I took it. Down I
  came, a steep glide, doing the best I could for myself.</p>

  <p>Perhaps I did bowl a few people over; but progress is progress.</p>

  <p>And I had to kill his pigs. It was a case of either dropping among the
  pigs and breaking my rush, or going full tilt into the corrugated iron
  piggeries beyond. I might have been cut to ribbons. And pigs are born to
  die.</p>

  <p>I stopped, and stood up stiffly upon the framework and looked behind me.
  It didn't take me a moment to realise that Mintonchester meant to take my
  poor efforts to give it an Aviation Day all to itself in a spirit of
  ferocious ingratitude.</p>

  <p>The air was full of the squealing of the two pigs I had pinned under my
  machine and the bawling of the nearer spectators. Lupton occupied the middle
  distance with a garden fork, with the evident intention of jabbing it into my
  stomach. I am always pretty cool and quick-witted in an emergency. I dropped
  off poor "Alauda Magna" like a shot, dodged through the piggery, went up by
  Frobisher's orchard, nipped over the yard wall of Hinks's cottages, and was
  into the police-station by the back way before anyone could get within fifty
  feet of me.</p>

  <p>"Halloa!" said Inspector Nenton; "Smashed the thing?"</p>

  <p>"No," I said; "but people seem to have got something the matter with them.
  I want to be locked in a cell..."</p>

  <p>For a fortnight, do you know, I wasn't allowed to come near my own
  machine. I went home from the police-station as soon as the first excitement
  had blown over a little, going round by Love Lane and Chart so as not to
  arouse any febrile symptoms. I found mother frightfully indignant, you can be
  sure, at the way I had been treated. And there, as I say, was I, standing a
  sort of siege in the upstairs rooms, and sturdy little "Alauda Magna," away
  in Cheeseman's field, being walked round and stared at by everybody in the
  world but me. Cheeseman's theory was that he had seized her. There came a
  gale one night, and the dear thing was blown clean over the hedge among
  Lupton's greenhouses again, and then Lupton sent round a silly note to say
  that if we didn't remove her, she would be sold to defray expenses, going off
  into a long tirade about damages and his solicitor. So mother posted off to
  Clamps', the furniture removers at Upnorton Corner, and they got hold of a
  timber-waggon, and popular feeling had allayed sufficiently before that
  arrived for me to go in person to superintend the removal. There she lay like
  a great moth above the debris of some cultural projects of Lupton's, scarcely
  damaged herself except for a hole or so and some bent rods and stays in the
  left wing and a smashed skid. But she was bespattered with pigs' blood and
  pretty dirty.</p>

  <p>I went at once by instinct for the engines, and had them in perfect going
  order before the timber-waggon arrived.</p>

  <p>A sort of popularity returned to me with that procession home. With the
  help of a swarm of men we got "Alauda Magna" poised on the waggon, and then I
  took my seat to see she was balanced properly, and a miscellaneous team of
  seven horses started to tow her home. It was nearly one o'clock when we got
  to that, and all the children turned out to shout and jeer. We couldn't go by
  Pook's Lane and the vicarage, because the walls are too high and narrow, and
  so we headed across Cheeseman's meadows for Stokes' Waste and the Common, to
  get round by that detour.</p>

  <p>I was silly, of course, to do what I did&mdash;I see that now&mdash;but
  sitting up there on my triumphal car with all the multitude about me excited
  me. I got a kind of glory on. I really only meant to let the propellers spin
  as sort of hurrahing, but I was carried away. Whuz-z-z-z! It was like
  something blowing up, and behold! I was sailing and plunging away from my
  wain across the common for a second flight.</p>

  <p>"Lord!" I said.</p>

  <p>I fully meant to run up the air a little way, come about, and take her
  home to our paddock, but those early aeroplanes were very uncertain
  things.</p>

  <p>After all, it wasn't such a very bad shot to land in the vicarage garden,
  and that practically is what I did. And I don't see that it was my fault that
  all the vicarage and a lot of his friends should be having lunch on the lawn.
  They were doing that, of course, so as to be on the spot without having to
  rush out of the house when "Alauda Magna" came home again. Quite
  exultation&mdash;that was their game. They wanted to gloat over every
  particular of my ignominious return. You can see that from the way they had
  arranged the table. I can't help it if Fate decided that my return wasn't to
  be so ignominious as all that, and swooped me down on the lot of them.</p>

  <p>They were having their soup. They had calculated on me for the dessert, I
  suppose.</p>

  <p>To this day I can't understand how I didn't kill the vicar. The forward
  edge of the left wing got him just under the chin and carried him back a
  dozen yards. He must have had neck vertebrae like steel; and even then I was
  amazed his head didn't come off. Perhaps he was holding on underneath; but I
  can't imagine where. If it hadn't been for the fascination of his staring
  face I think I could have avoided the veranda, but as it was, that took me by
  surprise. That was a fair crumple up. The wood must have just rotted away
  under its green paint; but anyhow, it and the climbing roses and shingles
  above and everything snapped and came down like stage scenery, and I and the
  engines and the middle part drove clean through the French windows on to the
  drawing-room floor. It was jolly luck for me, I think, that the French
  windows weren't shut. There's no unpleasanter way of getting hurt in the
  world than flying suddenly through thin window-glass; and I think I ought to
  know. There was a frightful jawbation, but the vicar was out of action, that
  was one good thing. Those deep, sonorous sentences! But perhaps they would
  have calmed things...</p>

  <p>That was the end of "Alauda Magna," my first aeroplane. I never even
  troubled to take her away. I hadn't the heart to...</p>

  <p>And then the storm burst.</p>

  <p>The idea seems to have been to make mother and me pay for everything that
  had ever tumbled down or got broken in Mintonchester since the beginning of
  things. Oh! And for any animal that had died a sudden death in the memory of
  the oldest inhabitant. The tariff ruled high, too. Cows were twenty-five to
  thirty pounds and upward; pigs about a pound each, with no reduction for
  killing a quantity; verandas&mdash;verandas were steady at forty-five
  guineas. Dinner services, too, were up, and so were tilting and branches of
  the building trade. It seemed to certain persons in Mintonchester, I believe,
  that an era of unexampled prosperity had dawned upon the place&mdash;only
  limited, in fact by the solvency of me and mother. The vicar tried the old
  "sold to defray expenses" racket, but I told him he might sell.</p>

  <p>I pleaded defective machinery and the hand of God, did my best to shift
  the responsibility on to the firm in Blackfriars Road, and as additional
  precaution, filed my petition in bankruptcy. I really hadn't any property in
  the world, thanks to mother's goodness, except my two motor-bicycles, which
  the brutes took, my photographic dark-room, and a lot of bound books on
  aeronautics and progress generally. Mother, of course, wasn't responsible.
  She hadn't lifted a wing.</p>

  <p>Well, for all that, disagreeables piled up so heavily on me, what with
  being shouted after by a rag-tag and bobtail of schoolboys and golf caddies
  and hobbledehoys when I went out doors, threatened with personal violence by
  stupid people like old Lupton, who wouldn't understand that a man can't pay
  what he hasn't got, pestered by the wives of various gentlemen who saw fit to
  become out-of-works on the strength of alleged injuries, and served with all
  sorts of silly summonses for all sorts of fancy offences, such as mischievous
  mischief and manslaughter and wilful damage and trespass, that I simply had
  to go away from Mintonchester to Italy, and leave poor little mother to
  manage them in her own solid, undemonstrative way. Which she did, I must
  admit, like a Brick.</p>

  <p>They didn't get much out of her, anyhow but she had to break up our little
  home at Mintonchester and join me at Arosa, in spite of her dislike of
  Italian cooking. She found me already a bit of a celebrity because I had made
  a record, so it seemed, by falling down three separate crevasses on three
  successive days. But that's another story altogether.</p>

  <p>From start to finish I reckon that first aeroplane cost my mother over
  nine hundred pounds. If I hadn't put my foot down, and she had stuck to her
  original intention of paying all the damage, it would have cost her three
  thousand... But it was worth it. It was worth it. I wish I could live it all
  over again; and many an old codger like me sits at home now and deplores
  those happy, vanished, adventurous times, when any lad of spirit was free to
  fly&mdash;and go anywhere&mdash;and smashed anything&mdash;and discuss the
  question afterwards of just what the damages amounted to and what his legal
  liability might be.</p>

     name="story70">LITTLE MOTHER UP THE M&Ouml;RDERBERG</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, April 1910</h3>

  <p>I think I mentioned, when I was telling how I sailed my first aeroplane,
  that I made a kind of record at Arosa by falling down three separate
  crevasses on three successive days. That was before little mother followed me
  out there. When she came, I could see at a glance she was tired and jaded and
  worried, and so, instead of letting her fret about, in the hotel and get into
  a wearing tangle of gossip, I packed her and two knapsacks up, and started
  off on a long, refreshing, easy-going walk northward, until a blister on her
  foot stranded us at the Magenruhe Hotel on the Sneejoch. She was for going
  on, blister or no blister&mdash;I never met pluck like mother's in all my
  life&mdash;but I said "No, This is a mountaineering inn, and it suits me down
  to the ground&mdash;or if you prefer it, up to the sky. You shall sit in the
  veranda by the telescope, and I'll prance about among the peaks for a
  bit."</p>

  <p>"Don't have accidents," she said.</p>

  <p>"Can't promise that, little mother," I said; "but I'll always remember I'm
  your only son."</p>

  <p>So I pranced...</p>

  <p>I need hardly say that in a couple of days I was at loggerheads with all
  the mountaineers in that inn. They couldn't stand me. They didn't like my
  neck with its strong, fine Adam's apple&mdash;being mostly men with their
  heads jammed on&mdash;and they didn't like the way I bore myself and lifted
  my aviator's nose to the peaks. They didn't like my being a vegetarian and
  the way I evidently enjoyed it, and they didn't like the touch of colour,
  orange and green, in my rough serge suit. They were all of the dingy
  school&mdash;the sort of men I call gentlemanly owls&mdash;shy,
  correct-minded creatures, mostly from Oxford, and as solemn over their
  climbing as a cat frying eggs. Sage they were, great headnodders, and
  "I-wouldn't-venture-to-do-a-thing-like-that"-ers. They always did what the
  books and guides advised, and they classed themselves by their seasons; one
  was in his ninth season, and another in his tenth, and so on. I was a novice
  and had to sit with my mouth open for bits of humble-pie.</p>

  <p>My style that! Rather!</p>

  <p>I would sit in the smoking-room sucking away at a pipeful of hygienic herb
  tobacco&mdash;they said it smelt like burning garden rubbish&mdash;and
  waiting to put my spoke in and let a little into their minds. They set aside
  their natural reticence altogether in their efforts to show how much they
  didn't like me.</p>

  <p>"You chaps take these blessed mountains too seriously," I said. "They're
  larks, you've got to lark with them."</p>

  <p>They just slued their eyes round me.</p>

  <p>"I don't find the solemn joy in fussing you do. The old-style mountaineers
  went up with alpenstocks and ladders and light hearts. That's my idea of
  mountaineering."</p>

  <p>"It isn't ours," said one red-boiled hero of the peaks, all blisters and
  peeling skin, and he said it with an air of crushing me.</p>

  <p>"It's the right idea," I said serenely, and puffed at my herb tobacco.</p>

  <p>"When you've had a bit of experience you'll know better," said another, an
  oldish young man with a small grey beard.</p>

  <p>"Experience never taught me anything," I said.</p>

  <p>"Apparently not," said someone, and left me one down and me to play. I
  kept perfectly tranquil.</p>

  <p>"I mean to do the M&ouml;rderberg before I go down," I said quietly, and
  produced a sensation.</p>

  <p>"When are you going down?"</p>

  <p>"Week or so," I answered, unperturbed.</p>

  <p>"It's not the climb a man ought to attempt in his first year," said the
  peeling gentleman.</p>

  <p>"You particularly ought not to try it," said another.</p>

  <p>"No guide will go with you."</p>

  <p>"Foolhardy idea."</p>

  <p>"Mere brag."</p>

  <p>"Like to see him do it."</p>

  <p>I just let them boil for a bit, and when they were back to the simmer I
  dropped in, pensively, with, "Very likely I'll take that little mother of
  mine. She's small, bless her, and she's as hard as nails."</p>

  <p>But they saw they were being drawn by my ill-concealed smile; and this
  time they contented themselves with a few grunts and grunt-like remarks, and
  then broke up into little conversations in undertones that pointedly excluded
  me. It had the effect of hardening my purpose. I'm a stiff man when I'm put
  on my mettle, and I determined that the little mother should go up the
  M&ouml;rderberg, where half these solemn experts hadn't been, even if I had
  to be killed or orphaned in the attempt. So I spoke to her about it the next
  day. She was in a deck-chair on the veranda, wrapped up in rugs and looking
  at the peaks.</p>

  <p>"Comfy?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Very," she said.</p>

  <p>"Getting rested?"</p>

  <p>"It's so nice."</p>

  <p>I strolled to the rail of the veranda. "See that peak there, mummy?"</p>

  <p>She nodded happily, with eyes half shut.</p>

  <p>"That's the M&ouml;rderberg. You and me have got to be up there the day
  after to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Her eyes opened a bit. "Wouldn't it be rather a climb, dearest?" she
  said.</p>

  <p>"I'll manage that all right," I said, and she smiled consentingly and
  closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>"So long as you manage it," she said.</p>

  <p>I went down the valley that afternoon to Daxdam to get gear and guides and
  porters, and I spent the next day in glacier and rock practice above the
  hotel. That didn't add to my popularity. I made two little slips. One took me
  down a crevasse&mdash;I've an extraordinary knack of going down crevasses
  &mdash;and a party of three which was starting for the Kinderspitz spent an
  hour and a half fishing me out; and the other led to my dropping my ice-axe
  on a little string of people going for the Humpi glacier. It didn't go within
  thirty inches of anyone, but you might have thought from the row they made
  that I had knocked out the collective brains of the party. Quite frightful
  language they used, and three ladies with them, too!</p>

  <p>The next day there was something very like an organised attempt to prevent
  our start. They brought out the landlord, they remonstrated with mother, they
  did their best to blacken the character of my two guides. The landlord's
  brother had a first-class row with them.</p>

  <p>"Two years ago," he said, "they lost their Herr!"</p>

  <p>"No particular reason," I said, "why you shouldn't keep yours on is
  it?"</p>

  <p>That settled him. He wasn't up to a polyglot pun, and it stuck in his mind
  like a fishbone in the throat.</p>

  <p>Then the peeling gentleman came along and tried to overhaul our equipment.
  "Have you got this?" it was, and "Have you got that?"</p>

  <p>"Two things," I said, looking at his nose pretty hard, "we haven't
  forgotten. One's blue veils and the other vaseline."</p>

  <p>I've still a bright little memory of the start, There was the pass a
  couple of hundred feet or so below the hotel, and the hotel&mdash;all name
  and windows&mdash;standing out in a great, desolate, rocky place against
  lumpy masses of streaky green rock, flecked here and there with patches of
  snow and dark shelves of rhododendron, and raising perhaps a thousand feet
  towards the western spur of the massif. Our path ran before us, meandering
  among the boulders down to stepping-stones over a rivulet, and then upward on
  the other side of the stream towards the Magenruhe glacier, where we had to
  go up the rocks to the left and then across the icefall to shelves on the
  precipitous face on the west side. It was dawn, the sun had still to rise,
  and everything looked very cold and blue and vast about us. Everyone in the
  hotel had turned out to bear a hand in the row&mdash;some of the deshabilles
  were disgraceful&mdash;and now they stood in a silent group watching us
  recede. The last word I caught was, "They'll have to come back."</p>

  <p>"We'll come back all right," I answered. "Never fear."</p>

  <p>And so we went our way, cool and deliberate, over the stream and up and up
  towards the steep snowfields and icy shoulder of the M&ouml;rderberg. I
  remember that we went in absolute silence for a time, and then how suddenly
  the landscape gladdened with sunrise, and in an instant, as if speech had
  thawed, all our tongues were babbling.</p>

  <p>I had one or two things in the baggage that I hadn't cared for the people
  at the inn to see, and I had made no effort to explain why I had five porters
  with the load of two and a half. But when we came to the icefall I showed my
  hand a little, and unslung a stout twine hammock for the mater. We put her in
  this with a rug round her, and sewed her in with a few stitches; then we
  roped up in line, with me last but one and a guide front and rear, and mummy
  in the middle carried by two of the porters. I stuck my alpenstock through
  two holes I had made in the shoulders of my jacket under my rucksack, T-shape
  to my body, so that when I went down a crevasse, as I did ever and again, I
  just stuck in its jaws and came up easy as the rope grew taut. And so, except
  for one or two bumps that made the mater chuckle, we got over without
  misadventure.</p>

  <p>Then came the rock climb on the other side, requiring much judgment. We
  had to get from ledge to ledge as opportunity offered, and here the little
  mother was a perfect godsend. We unpacked her after we had slung her over the
  big fissure&mdash;I forget what you call it&mdash;that always comes between
  glacier and rock&mdash;and whenever we came to a bit of ledge within eight
  feet of the one we were working along, the two guides took her and slung her
  up, she being so light, and then she was able to give a foot for the next man
  to hold by and hoist himself. She said we were all pulling her leg, and that
  made her and me laugh so much that the whole party had to wait for us.</p>

  <p>It was pretty tiring altogether doing that bit of the climb&mdash;two
  hours we had of it before we got to the loose masses of rock on the top of
  the arete. "It's worse going down," said the elder guide.</p>

  <p>I looked back for the first time, and I confess it did make me feel a bit
  giddy. There was the glacier looking quite pretty, and with a black gash
  between itself and the rocks.</p>

  <p>For a time it was pretty fair going up the rocky edge of the arete, and
  nothing happened of any importance, except that one of the porters took to
  grousing because he was hit on the shin by a stone I dislodged. "Fortunes of
  war," I said, but he didn't seem to see it, and when I just missed him with a
  second he broke out into a long, whining discourse in what I suppose he
  thought was German&mdash;I couldn't make head or tail of it.</p>

  <p>"He said you might have killed him," said little mother.</p>

  <p>"They say," I quoted, "What say they? Let them say."</p>

  <p>I was for stopping and filling him up with a feed, but the elder guide
  wouldn't have it. We had already lost time, he said, and the traverse round
  the other face of the mountain would be more and more subject to avalanches
  as the sun got up. So we went on. As we went round the corner to the other
  face I turned towards the hotel&mdash;it was the meanest little oblong spot
  by now&mdash;and made a derisive gesture or so for the benefit of anyone at
  the telescope.</p>

  <p>We did get one rock avalanche that reduced the hindmost guide to audible
  prayer, but nothing hit us except a few bits of snow. The rest of the fall
  was a couple of yards and more from us. We were on rock just then and
  overhung; before and afterwards we were edging along steps in an ice-slope
  cut by the foremost guide, and touched up by the porters. The avalanche was
  much more impressive before it came in sight, banging and thundering
  overhead, and it made a tremendous uproar in the blue deeps beneath, but in
  actual transit it seemed a mean show&mdash;mostly of stones smaller than I
  am.</p>

  <p>"All right?" said the guide.</p>

  <p>"Toned up," I answered.</p>

  <p>"You suppose it is safe, dear?" asked the little mother.</p>

  <p>"Safe as Trafalgar Square," I said. "Hop along, mummykins."</p>

  <p>Which she did with remarkable agility.</p>

  <p>The traverse took us on to old snow at last, and here, we could rest for
  lunch&mdash;and pretty glad we were both of lunch and rest. But here the
  trouble with the guides and porters thickened. They were already a little
  ruffled about my animating way with loose rocks, and now they kicked up a
  tremendous shindy because instead of the customary brandy we had brought non-
  alcoholic ginger cordial. Would they even try it? Not a bit of it! It was a
  queer little dispute, high up in that rarefied air about food values and the
  advantages of making sandwiches with nuttar. They were an odd lot of men,
  invincibly set upon a vitiated and vitiating dietary. They wanted meat, they
  wanted alcohol, they wanted narcotics to smoke. You might have thought that
  men like these, living in almost direct contact with Nature, would have liked
  "Nature" foods, such as plasmon, protose, plobose, digestine, and so forth.
  Not them! They just carved for corruption. When I spoke of drinking pure
  water one of the porters spat in a marked, symbolic manner over the
  precipice. From that point onward discontent prevailed.</p>

  <p>We started again about half-past eleven, after a vain attempt on the part
  of the head guide to induce us to turn back. We had now come to what is
  generally the most difficult part of the M&ouml;rderberg ascent, the edge
  that leads up to the snowfield below the crest. But here we came suddenly
  into a draught of warm air blowing from the south-west, and everything, the
  guide said, was unusual. Usually the edge is a sheet of ice over rock. To-day
  it was wet and soft, and one could kick steps in it and get one's toes into
  rock with the utmost ease.</p>

  <p>"This is where Herr Tomlinson's party fell," said one of the porters,
  after we'd committed ourselves to the edge for ten minutes or so.</p>

  <p>"Some people could fall out of a four-post bed," I said.</p>

  <p>"It'll freeze hard again before we come back," said the second guide, "and
  us with nothing but verdammt ginger inside of us."</p>

  <p>"You keep your rope taut," said I.</p>

  <p>A friendly ledge came to the help of mother in the nick of time, just as
  she was beginning to tire, and we sewed her up all but the feet in her
  hammock again, and roped her carefully. She bumped a bit, and at times she
  was just hanging over immensity and rotating slowly, with everybody else
  holding like grim death.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she said, the first time this happened, "is it right for me to
  be doing this?"</p>

  <p>"Quite right," I said, "but if you can get a foothold presently again
  &mdash;it's rather better style."</p>

  <p>"You're sure there's no danger, dear?"</p>

  <p>"Not a scrap."</p>

  <p>"And I don't fatigue you?"</p>

  <p>"You're a stimulant."</p>

  <p>"The view," she said, "is certainly becoming very beautiful."</p>

  <p>But presently the view blotted itself out, and we were in clouds and thin
  drift of almost thawing snowflakes.</p>

  <p>We reached the upper snowfield about half-past one, and the snow was
  extraordinarily soft. The elder guide went in up to his armpits.</p>

  <p>"Frog it," I said, and spread myself out flat, in a sort of swimming
  attitude. So we bored our way up to the crest and along it. We went in little
  spurts and then stopped for breath, and we dragged the little mother after us
  in her hammock-bag. Sometimes the snow was so good we fairly skimmed the
  surface; sometimes it was so rotten we plunged right into it and splashed
  about. I went too near the snow cornice once and it broke under me, but the
  rope saved me, and we reached the summit about three o'clock without further
  misadventure. The summit was just bare rock with the usual cairn and pole.
  Nothing to make a fuss about. The drift of snow and cloudwisp had passed, the
  sun was blazing hot overhead, and we seemed to be surveying all Switzerland.
  The Magenruhe Hotel was at our toes, hidden, so to speak, by our chins. We
  squatted about the cairn, and the guides and porters were reduced to ginger
  and vegetarian ham-sandwiches. I cut and scratched an inscription, saying I
  had climbed on simple food, and claiming a record.</p>

  <p>Seen from the summit the snowfields on the north-east side of the mountain
  looked extremely attractive, and I asked the head guide why that way up
  wasn't used. He said something in his peculiar German about precipices.</p>

  <p>So far our ascent had been a fairly correct ascent in rather slow time. It
  was in the descent that, that strain in me of almost unpremeditated
  originality had play. I wouldn't have a rope returning across the upper
  snowfield, because mother's feet and hands were cold, and I wanted her to
  jump about a bit. And before I could do anything to prevent it she had
  slipped, tried to get up by rolling over down the slope instead of up, as she
  ought to have done, and was leading the way, rolling over and over and over,
  down towards the guide's blessed precipices above the lower snowfield.</p>

  <p>I didn't lose an instant in flinging myself after her, axe up, in
  glissading attitude. I'm not clear what I meant to do, but I fancy the idea
  was to get in front of her and put on the brake. I did not succeed, anyhow.
  In twenty seconds I had slipped, and was sitting down and going down out of
  my own control altogether.</p>

  <p>Now, most great discoveries are the result of accident, and I maintain
  that in that instant mother and I discovered two distinct and novel ways of
  coming down a mountain.</p>

  <p>It is necessary that there should be first a snow slope above with a layer
  of softish, rotten snow on the top of ice, then a precipice, with a snow-
  covered talus sloping steeply at first and then less steeply, then more snow-
  slopes and precipices according to taste, ending in a snowfield or a not-too-
  greatly-fissured glacier, or a reasonable, not-too-rocky slope. Then it all
  becomes as easy as chuting the chutes.</p>

  <p>Mother hit on the sideways method. She rolled. With the snow in the
  adhesive state it had got into, she had made the jolliest little snowball of
  herself in half a minute, and the nucleus of as clean and abundant a snow
  avalanche as anybody could wish. There was plenty of snow going in front of
  her, and that's the very essence of both our methods. You must fall on your
  snow, not your snow fall on you, or it smashes you. And you mustn't mix
  yourself up with loose stones.</p>

  <p>I, on the other hand, went down feet first, and rather like a snow-
  plough; slower than she did, and if, perhaps, with less charm, with more
  dignity. Also I saw more. But it was certainly a tremendous rush. And I gave
  a sort of gulp when mummy bumped over the edge into the empty air and
  vanished.</p>

  <p>It was like a toboggan ride gone mad down the slope until I took off from
  the edge of the precipice, and then it was like a dream.</p>

  <p>I'd always thought falling must be horrible. It wasn't in the slightest
  degree. I might have hung with my clouds and lumps of snow about me for
  weeks, so great was my serenity. I had an impression then that I was as good
  as killed&mdash;and that didn't matter. I wasn't afraid&mdash;that's
  nothing&mdash;! But I wasn't a bit uncomfortable. Whack! We'd hit something,
  and I expected to be flying to bits right and left. But we'd only got on to
  the snow-slope below, at so steep an angle that it was merely breaking the
  fall. Down we went again. I didn't see much of the view after that because
  the snow was all round and over my head, but I kept feet foremost and in a
  kind of sitting posture, and then I slowed and then I quickened again and
  bumped rather, and then harder, and bumped and then bumped again and came to
  rest. This time I was altogether buried in snow, and twisted sideways with a
  lot of heavy snow on my right shoulder.</p>

  <p>I sat for a bit enjoying the stillness&mdash;and then I wondered what had
  become of mother, and set myself to get out of the snow about me. It wasn't
  so easy as you might think; the stuff was all in lumps and spaces like a
  gigantic sponge, and I lost my temper and struggled and swore a good deal,
  but at last I managed it. I crawled out and found myself on the edge of
  heaped masses of snow quite close to the upper part of the Magenruhe glacier.
  And far away, right up the glacier and near the other side, was a little
  thing like a black-beetle struggling in the heart of an immense split ball of
  snow.</p>

  <p>I put my hands to my mouth and let out with my version of the yodel, and
  presently I saw her waving her hand.</p>

  <p>It took me nearly twenty minutes to get to her. I knew my weakness, and I
  was very careful of every crevasse I came near. When I got up to her, her
  face was anxious.</p>

  <p>"What have you done with the guides?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"They've got too much to carry," I said. "They're coming down another way.
  Did you like it?"</p>

  <p>"Not very much, dear," she said, "but I dare say I shall get used to these
  things. Which way do we go now?"</p>

  <p>I decided we'd find a snow-bridge across the bergschrund&mdash;that's the
  word I forgot just now&mdash;and so get on to the rocks on the east side of
  the glacier, and after that we had uneventful going right down to the
  hotel...</p>

  <p>Our return evoked such a strain of hostility and envy as I have never met
  before or since. First they tried to make out we'd never been to the top at
  all, but mother's little proud voice settled that sort of insult. And
  besides, there was the evidence of the guides and porters following us down.
  When they asked about the guides, "They're following your methods," I said,
  "and I suppose they'll get back here to-morrow morning sometime."</p>

  <p>That didn't please them.</p>

  <p>I claimed a record. They said my methods were illegitimate.</p>

  <p>"If I see fit," I said, "to use an avalanche to get back by, what's that
  to you? You tell me, me and mother can't do the confounded mountain anyhow,
  and when we do you want to invent a lot of rules to disqualify us. You'll say
  next one mustn't glissade. I've made a record, and you know I've made a
  record, and you're about as sour as you can be. The fact of it is, you chaps
  don't know your own silly business. Here's a good, quick way of coming down a
  mountain, and you ought to know about it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The chance that both of you are not killed was one in a thousand."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! It's the proper way to come down for anyone who hasn't a hide-
  bound mind. You chaps ought to practise falling great heights in snow. It's
  perfectly easy and perfectly safe, if only you know how to set about it."</p>

  <p>"Look here, young man," said the oldish young man with the little grey
  beard, "you don't seem to understand that you and that lady have been saved
  by a kind of miracle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Theory!" I interrupted. "I'm surprised you fellows ever come to
  Switzerland. If I were your kind I'd just invent theoretical mountains and
  play for points. However, you're tired, little mummy. It's time you had some
  nice warm soup and tucked yourself up in bed. I shan't let you get up for
  six-and-thirty hours."</p>

  <p>But it's queer how people detest a little originality.</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Storyteller</i>, April 1921</h3>

  <p>"Can these bones live?"</p>

  <p>Could anything be more dead, more mute and inexpressive to the inexpert
  eye than the ochreous fragments of bone and the fractured lumps of flint that
  constitute the first traces of something human in the world? We see them in
  the museum cases, sorted out in accordance with principles we do not
  understand, labelled with strange names. Chellean, Mousterian, Solutrian and
  the like, taken mostly from the places Chelles, La Moustier, Solutre, and so
  forth where the first specimens were found. Most of us stare through the
  glass at them, wonder vaguely for a moment at that half-savage, half-animal
  past of our race, and pass on. "Primitive man," we say. "Flint implements.
  The mammoth used to chase him." Few of us realize yet how much the subtle
  indefatigable cross-examination of the scientific worker has been extracting
  from the evidence of these rusty and obstinate witnesses during the last few
  years.</p>

  <p>One of the most startling results of this recent work is the gradual
  realisation that great quantities of these flint implements and some of the
  earlier fragments of bone that used to be ascribed to humanity are the
  vestiges of creatures, very manlike in many respects, but not, strictly
  speaking, belonging to the human species. Scientific men call these vanished
  races man (<i>Homo</i>), just as they call lions and tigers cats
  (<i>Felis</i>), but there are the soundest reasons for believing that these
  earlier so-called men were not of our blood, not our ancestors, but a strange
  and vanished animal, like us, akin to us, but different from us, as the
  mammoth was like, and akin to, and yet different from, the elephant. Flint
  and bone implements are found in deposits of very considerable antiquity;
  some in our museums may be a million years old or more, but the traces of
  really human creatures, mentally and anatomically like ourselves, do not go
  back much earlier than twenty or thirty thousand years ago. True men appeared
  in Europe then, and we do not know whence they came. These other tool-using,
  fire-making animals, the things that were like men and yet were not men,
  passed away before the faces of the true men.</p>

  <p>Scientific authorities already distinguish four species of these pseudo-
  men, and it is probable that we shall learn from time to time of other
  species. One strange breed made the implements called Chellean. These are
  chiefly sole-shaped blades of stone found in deposits of perhaps 300,000 or
  400,000 years ago. Chellean implements are to be seen in any great museum.
  They are huge implements, <i>four or five times as big as those made by any
  known race of true men</i>, and they are not ill made. Certainly some
  creature with an intelligent brain made them. Big clumsy hands must have
  gripped and used these rocky chunks. But so far only one small fragment of a
  skeleton of this age has been found, a very massive chinless lower jawbone,
  with teeth rather <i>more</i> specialised than those of men to-day. We can
  only guess what strange foreshadowing of the human form once ate with that
  jaw, and struck at its enemies with those big but not unhandy flint blades.
  It may have been a tremendous fellow, probably much bigger in the body than a
  man. It may have been able to take bears by the scruff and the sabre-toothed
  lion by the throat. We do not know. We have just these great stone blades and
  that bit of a massive jaw and&mdash;the liberty to wonder.</p>

  <p>Most fascinating riddle of all these riddles of the ages of ice and
  hardship, before the coming of the true men, is the riddle of the Mousterian
  men, because they were perhaps still living in the world when the true men
  came wandering into Europe. They lived much later than those unknown Chellean
  giants. They lived thirty or forty thousand years ago&mdash;a yesterday
  compared with the Chellean time. These Mousterians are also called
  Neandertalers. Until quite recently it was supposed that they were true men
  like ourselves. But now we begin to realise that they were different, so
  different that it is impossible that they can be very close relations of
  ours. They walked or shambled along with a peculiar slouch, they could not
  turn their heads up to the sky, and their teeth were very different from
  those of true men. One oddity about them is that in one or two points they
  were less like apes than we are. The dog tooth, the third tooth from the
  middle, which is so big in the gorilla, and which in man is pointed and still
  quite distinct from the other teeth, is not distinct at all in the
  Neandertaler. He had a very even row of teeth, and his cheek teeth also were
  very unlike ours, and less like the apes' than ours. He had more face and
  less brow than true men, but that is not because he had a lesser brain; his
  brain was as big as a modern man's but it was different, bigger behind and
  smaller in front, so that probably he thought and behaved differently from
  us. Perhaps he had a better memory and less reasoning power than real men, or
  perhaps he had more nervous energy and less intelligence. He had no chin, and
  the way his jawbones come together below make it very doubtful if he could
  have used any such sounds in speech as we employ. Probably he did not talk at
  all. He could not hold a pin between his finger and thumb. The more we learn
  about this beast-man the stranger he becomes to us and the less like the
  Australoid savage he was once supposed to be.</p>

  <p>And as we realise the want of any close relationship between this ugly,
  strong, ungainly, manlike animal and mankind, the less likely it becomes that
  he had a naked skin and hair like ours and the more probable that he was
  different and perhaps bristly or hairy in some queer inhuman fashion like the
  hairy elephant and the woolly rhinoceros who were his contemporaries. Like
  them he lived in a bleak land on the edge of the snows and glaciers that were
  even then receding northward. Hairy or grisly, with a big face like a mask,
  great brow ridges and no forehead, clutching an enormous flint, and running
  like a baboon with his head forward and not, like a man, with his head up, he
  must have been a fearsome creature for our forefathers to come upon.</p>

  <p>Almost certainly they met, these grisly men and the true men. The true man
  must have come into the habitat of the Neandertaler, and the two must have
  met and fought. Some day we may come upon the evidences of this warfare.</p>

  <p>Western Europe, which is the only part of the world that has yet been
  searched with any thoroughness for the remains of early men, was slowly
  growing warmer age by age; the glaciers that had once covered half the
  continent were receding, and wide stretches of summer pasture and thin woods
  of pine and birch were spreading slowly over the once icy land. South Europe
  then was like northern Labrador to-day. A few hardy beasts held out amidst
  the snows; the bears hibernated. With the spring grass and foliage came great
  herds of reindeer, wild horses, mammoth, elephant, and rhinoceros, drifting
  northward from the slopes of the great warm valley that is now filled up with
  water&mdash;the Mediterranean Sea. It was in those days before the ocean
  waters broke into the Mediterranean that the swallows and a multitude of
  other birds acquired the habit of coming north, a habit that nowadays impels
  them to brave the passage of the perilous seas that flow over and hide the
  lost secrets of the ancient Mediterranean valleys. The grisly men rejoiced at
  the return of life, came out of the caves in which they had lurked during the
  winter, and took their toll of the beasts.</p>

  <p>These grisly men must have been almost solitary creatures.</p>

  <p>The winter food was too scanty for communities. A male may have gone with
  a female or so; perhaps they parted in the winter and came together in the
  summer; when his sons grew big enough to annoy him, the grisly man killed
  them or drove them off. If he killed them he may have eaten them. If they
  escaped him they may have returned to kill him. The grisly folk may have had
  long unreasoning memories and very set purposes.</p>

  <p>The true men came into Europe, we know not whence, out of the South. When
  they appeared in Europe their hands were as clever as ours; they could draw
  pictures we still admire, they could paint and carve; the implements they
  made were smaller than the Mousterian ones, far smaller than the Chellean,
  but better made and more various. They wore no clothes worth speaking of, but
  they painted themselves and probably they talked. And they came in little
  bands. They were already more social than the Neandertaler; they had laws and
  self-restraints; their minds had travelled a long way along that path of
  adaptation and self-suppression which has led to the intricate mind of man
  to-day with its concealed wishes, its confusions, and laughter and the
  fantasies and reveries and dreams. They were already held together, these
  men, and kept in order by the strange limitations of tabu.</p>

  <p>They were still savages, very prone to violence and convulsive in their
  lusts and desires; but to the best of their poor ability they obeyed laws and
  customs already immemorably ancient, and they feared the penalties of wrong-
  doing. We can understand something of what was going on in their minds, those
  of us who can remember the fears, desires, fancies and superstitions of our
  childhood. Their moral struggles were ours&mdash;in cruder forms. They were
  our kind. But the grisly folk we cannot begin to understand. We cannot
  conceive in our different minds the strange ideas that chased one another
  through those queerly shaped brains. As well might we try to dream and feel
  as a gorilla dreams and feels.</p>

  <p>We can understand how the true men drifted northward from the lost lands
  of the Mediterranean valley into the high Spanish valleys and the south and
  centre of France, and so on to what is now England&mdash;for there was no
  Channel then between England and France&mdash;and eastward to the Rhineland
  and over the broad wilderness which is now the North Sea, and the German
  plain. They would leave the snowy wilderness of the Alps, far higher then and
  covered with great glaciers, away on their right. These people drifted
  northward for the very good reason that their kind was multiplying and food
  diminishing. They would be oppressed by feuds and wars. They had no settled
  homes; they were accustomed to drift with the seasons, every now and then
  some band would be pushed by hunger and fear a little farther northward into
  the unknown.</p>

  <p>We can imagine the appearance of a little group of these wanderers, our
  ancestors, coming over some grassy crest into these northern lands. The time
  would be late spring or early summer, and they would probably be following up
  some grazing beasts, a reindeer herd or horses.</p>

  <p>By a score of different means our anthropologists have been able to
  reconstruct the particulars of the appearance and habits of these early
  pilgrim fathers of mankind.</p>

  <p>They would not be a very numerous band, because if they were there would
  be no reason why they should have been driven northward out of their former
  roving grounds. Two or three older men of thirty or so, eight or ten women
  and girls with a few young children, a few lads between fourteen and twenty,
  might make up the whole community. They would be a brownish brown-eyed people
  with wavy dark hair; the fairness of the European and the straight blue-black
  hair of the Chinaman had still to be evolved in the world. The older men
  would probably lead the band, the women and children would keep apart from
  the youths and men, fenced off by complex and definite tabus from any close
  companionship. The leaders would be tracking the herd they were following.
  Tracking was then the supreme accomplishment of mankind. By signs and traces
  that would be invisible to any modern civilised eye, they would be reading
  the story of the previous day's trek of the herd of sturdy little horses
  ahead of them. They would be so expert that they would go on from one fault
  sign to another with as little delay as a dog who follows a scent.</p>

  <p>The horses they were following were only a little way ahead&mdash;so the
  trackers read the signs&mdash;they were numerous and nothing had alarmed
  them. They were grazing and moving only very slowly. There were no traces of
  wild dog or other animals to stampede them. Some elephants were also going
  north, and twice our human tribe had crossed the spoor of woolly rhinoceros
  roaming westward.</p>

  <p>The tribe travelled light. They were mainly naked, but all of them were
  painted with white and black and red and yellow ochre. At this distance of
  time it is difficult to see whether they were tattooed. Probably they were
  not. The babies and small children were carried by the women on their backs
  in slings or bags made of animal skins, and perhaps some or all of them wore
  mantles and loin bands of skin and had pouches and belts of leather. The men
  had stone-pointed spears, and carried sharpened flints in their hands.</p>

  <p>There was no Old Man who was lord and master and father of this particular
  crowd. Weeks ago the Old Man had been charged and trampled to a jelly by a
  great bull in the swamp far away. Then two of the girls had been waylaid and
  carried off by the young men of another larger tribe. It was because of these
  losses that this remnant was now seeking new hunting grounds.</p>

  <p>The landscape that spread before the eyes of this little band as they
  crested the hills was a bleaker, more desolate and altogether unkempt version
  of the landscape of western Europe to-day. About them was a grassy down
  athwart which a peewit flew with its melancholy cry. Before them stretched a
  great valley ridged with transverse purple hills over which the April
  cloud-shadows chased one another. Pinewoods and black heather showed where
  these hills became sandy, and the valleys were full of brown brushwood, and
  down their undrained troughs ran a bright green band of peaty swamps and long
  pools of weedy water. In the valley thickets many beasts lurked unseen, and
  where the winding streams had cut into the soil there were cliffs and caves.
  Far away along the northern slopes of the ridge that were now revealed, the
  wild ponies were to be seen grazing.</p>

  <p>At a sign from the two leaders the little straggle of menfolk halted, and
  a woman who had been chattering in subdued tones to a little girl became
  silent. The brothers surveyed the wide prospect earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" said one abruptly and pointed.</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" cried his brother.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the whole tribe swung round to the pointing finger.</p>

  <p>The group became one rigid stare.</p>

  <p>Every soul of them stood still, astonishment had turned them into a tense
  group of statuettes.</p>

  <p>Far away down the slope with his body in profile and his head turned
  towards them, frozen by an equal amazement, stood a hunched grey figure,
  bigger but shorter than a man. He had been creeping up behind a fold in the
  ground to peer at the ponies, and suddenly he had turned his eyes and seen
  the tribe. His head projected like a baboon's. In his hand he carried what
  seemed to the menfolk a great rock.</p>

  <p>For a little while this animal scrutiny held discoverers and discovered
  motionless. Then some of the women and children began to stir and line out to
  see the strange creature better. "Man!" said an old crone of forty.
  "<i>Man!</i>" At the movement of the women the grisly man turned, ran
  clumsily for a score of yards or so towards a thicket of birch and budding
  thorn. Then he halted again for a moment to look at the newcomers, waved an
  arm strangely, and then dashed into cover.</p>

  <p>The shadows of the thicket swallowed him up, and by hiding him seemed to
  make him enormous. It identified itself with him, and watched them with his
  eyes. Its tree stems became long silvery limbs, and a fallen trunk crouched
  and stared.</p>

  <p>It was still early in the morning, and the leaders of the tribe had hoped
  to come up with the wild ponies as the day advanced and perhaps cut one off
  and drive it into difficulties among the bushes and swampy places below, and
  wound it and follow it up and kill it. Then they would have made a feast, and
  somewhere down in the valley they would have found water and dry bracken for
  litter and a fire before night. It had seemed a pleasant and hopeful morning
  to them until this moment. Now they were disconcerted. This grey figure was
  as if the sunny morning had suddenly made a horrible and inexplicable
  grimace.</p>

  <p>The whole expedition stood gazing for a time, and then the two leaders
  exchanged a few words. Waugh, the elder, pointed. Click, his brother, nodded
  his head. They would go on, but instead of slanting down the slopes towards
  the thickets they would keep round the ridge.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Waugh, and the little band began to move again. But now it
  marched in silence. When presently a little boy began a question his mother
  silenced him by a threat. Everybody kept glancing at the thickets below.</p>

  <p>Presently a girl cried out sharply and pointed. All started and stopped
  short.</p>

  <p>There was the grisly thing again. It was running across an open space,
  running almost on all fours, in joltering leaps. It was hunchbacked and very
  big and low, a grey hairy wolf-like monster. At times its long arms nearly
  touched the ground. It was nearer than it had been before. It vanished amidst
  the bushes again. It seemed to throw itself down among some red dead
  bracken...</p>

  <p>Waugh and Click took counsel.</p>

  <p>A mile away was the head of the valley where the thickets had their
  beginning. Beyond stretched the woldy hills, bare of cover. The horses were
  grazing up towards the sun, and away to the north the backs of a herd of
  woolly rhinoceros were now visible on a crest&mdash;just the ridges of their
  backs showing like a string of black beads.</p>

  <p>If the tribe struck across those grassy spaces, then the lurking prowler
  would have either to stay behind or come into the open. If he came into the
  open the dozen youths and men of the tribe would know how to deal with
  him.</p>

  <p>So they struck across the grass. The little band worked round to the head
  of the valley, and there the menfolk stayed at the crest while the women and
  children pushed on ahead across the open.</p>

  <p>For a time the watchers remained motionless, and then Waugh was moved to
  gestures of defiance. Click was not to be outdone. There were shouts at the
  hidden watcher, and then one lad, who was something of a clown, after certain
  grimaces and unpleasant gestures, obliged with an excellent imitation of the
  grey thing's lumbering run. At that scare gave place to hilarity.</p>

  <p>In those days laughter was a social embrace. Men could laugh, but there
  was no laughter in the grisly pre-man who watched and wondered in the shadow.
  He marvelled. The men rolled about and guffawed and slapped their thighs and
  one another. Tears ran down their faces.</p>

  <p>Never a sign came from the thickets.</p>

  <p>"Yahah," said the menfolk. "Yahah! Bzzzz. Yahah! Yah!"</p>

  <p>They forgot altogether how frightened they had been.</p>

  <p>And when Waugh thought the women and children had gone on a sufficient
  distance, he gave the word for the men to follow them.</p>

  <p>In such fashion it was that men, our ancestors, had their first glimpse of
  the pre-men of the wilderness of western Europe...</p>

  <p>The two breeds were soon to come to closer quarters.</p>

  <p>The newcomers were pushing their way into the country of these grisly men.
  Presently came other glimpses of lurking semi-human shapes and grey forms
  that ran in the twilight. In the morning Click found long narrow footprints
  round the camp...</p>

  <p>Then one day one of the children, eating those little green thorn-buds
  that rustic English children speak of as bread and cheese, ventured too far
  from the others. There was a squeal and a scuffle and a thud, and something
  grey and hairy made off through the thickets carrying its victim, with Waugh
  and three of the younger men in hot pursuit. They chased the enemy into a
  dark gully, very much overgrown. This time it was not a solitary Neandertaler
  they had to deal with. Out of the bushes a big male came at them to cover the
  retreat of his mate, and hurled a rock that bowled over the youth it hit like
  a nine-pin, so that thereafter he limped always. But Waugh with his throwing
  spear got the grey monster in the shoulder, and he halted snarling.</p>

  <p>No further sound came from the stolen child.</p>

  <p>The female showed herself for a moment up the gully, snarling,
  bloodstained, and horrible, and the menfolk stood about afraid to continue
  their pursuit, and yet not caring to desist from it. One of them was already
  hobbling off with his hand to his knee.</p>

  <p>How did that first fight go?</p>

  <p>Perhaps it went against the men of our race. Perhaps the big Neandertaler
  male, his mane and beard bristling horribly, came down the gully with a
  thunderous roar, with a great rock in either hand. We do not know whether he
  threw those big discs of flint or whether he smote with them. Perhaps it was
  then that Waugh was killed in the act of running away. Perhaps it was bleak
  disaster then for the little tribe. Short of two of its members it presently
  made off over the hills as fast as it could go, keeping together for safety,
  and leaving the wounded youth far behind to limp along its tracks in lonely
  terror.</p>

  <p>Let us suppose that he got back to the tribe at last&mdash;after nightmare
  hours.</p>

  <p>Now that Waugh had gone, Click would become Old Man, and he made the tribe
  camp that night and build their fire on the high ridges among the heather far
  away from the thickets in which the grisly folk might be lurking.</p>

  <p>The grisly folk thought we knew not how about the menfolk, and the men
  thought about the grisly folk in such ways as we can understand; they
  imagined how their enemies might act in this fashion or that, and schemed to
  circumvent them. It may have been Click who had the first dim idea of getting
  at the gorge in which the Neandertalers had their lair, from above. For as we
  have said, the Neandertaler did not look up. Then the menfolk could roll a
  great rock upon him or pelt him with burning brands and set the dry bracken
  alight.</p>

  <p>One likes to think of a victory for the human side. This Click we have
  conjured up had run in panic from the first onset of the grisly male, but as
  he brooded by the fire that night, he heard again in imagination the cry of
  the lost girl, and he was filled with rage. In his sleep the grisly male came
  to him and Click fought in his dreams and started awake stiff with fury.
  There was a fascination for him in that gorge in which Waugh had been killed.
  He was compelled to go back and look again for the grisly beasts, to waylay
  them in their tracks, and watch them from an ambush. He perceived that the
  Neandertalers could not climb as easily as the menfolk could climb, nor hear
  so quickly, nor dodge with the same unexpectedness. These grisly men were to
  be dealt with as the bears were dealt with, the bears before whom you run and
  scatter, and then come at again from behind.</p>

  <p>But one may doubt if the first human group to come into the grisly land
  was clever enough to solve the problems of the new warfare. Maybe they turned
  southward again to the gentler regions from which they had come, and were
  killed by or mingled with their own brethren again. Maybe they perished
  altogether in that new land of the grisly folk into which they had intruded.
  Yet the truth may be that they even held their own and increased. If they
  died there were others of their kind to follow them and achieve a better
  fate.</p>

  <p>That was the beginning of a nightmare age for the little children of the
  human tribe. They knew they were watched.</p>

  <p>Their steps were dogged. The legends of ogres and man-eating giants that
  haunt the childhood of the world may descend to us from those ancient days of
  fear. And for the Neandertalers it was the beginning of an incessant war that
  could end only in extermination.</p>

  <p>The Neandertalers, albeit not so erect and tall as men, were the heavier,
  stronger creatures, but they were stupid, and they went alone or in twos and
  threes; the menfolk were swifter, quicker-witted, and more social&mdash;when
  they fought they fought in combination. They lined out and surrounded and
  pestered and pelted their antagonists from every side. They fought the men of
  that grisly race as dogs might fight a bear. They shouted to one another what
  each should do, and the Neandertaler had no speech; he did not understand.
  They moved too quickly for him and fought too cunningly.</p>

  <p>Many and obstinate were the duels and battles these two sorts of men
  fought for this world in that bleak age of the windy steppes, thirty or forty
  thousand years ago. The two races were intolerable to each other. They both
  wanted the caves and the banks by the rivers where the big flints were got.
  They fought over the dead mammoths that had been bogged in the marshes, and
  over the reindeer stags that had been killed in the rutting season. When a
  human tribe found signs of the grisly folk near their cave and squatting
  place, they had perforce to track them down and kill them; their own safety
  and the safety of their little ones was only to be secured by that killing.
  The Neandertalers thought the little children of men fair game and pleasant
  eating.</p>

  <p>How long the grisly folk lived on in that chill world of pines and silver
  birch between the steppes and the glaciers, after the true menfolk came, we
  do not know. For ages they may have held out, growing more cunning and
  dangerous as they became rare. The true men hunted them down by their spoor
  and by their tracks, and watched for the smoke of their fires, and made food
  scarce for them.</p>

  <p>Great Paladins arose in that forgotten world, men who stood forth and
  smote the grey man-beast face to face and slew him. They made long spears of
  wood, hardened by fire at the tips; they raised shields of skin against his
  mighty blows. They struck at him with stones on cords, and slung them at him
  with slings. And it was not simply men who withstood the grisly beast but
  women. They stood over their children; they stood by their men against this
  eerie thing that was like and yet not like mankind. Unless the <i>savants</i>
  read all the signs awry, it was the women who were the makers of the larger
  tribes into which human families were already growing in those ancient times.
  It was the woman's subtle, love-guided wits which protected her sons from the
  fierce anger of the Old Man, and taught them to avoid his jealousy and wrath,
  and persuaded him to tolerate them and so have their help against the grisly
  enemy. It was woman, says Atkinson, in the beginning of things human, who
  taught the primary tabus, that a son must go aside out of the way of his
  stepmother, and get himself a wife from another tribe, so as to keep the
  peace within the family. She came between the fratricides, and was the first
  peacemaker. Human societies in their beginnings were her work, done against
  the greater solitariness, the lonely fierceness of the adult male. Through
  her, men learnt the primary co-operation of sonship and brotherhood. The
  grisly folk had not learnt even the rudest elements of co-operation, and
  mankind had already spelt out the alphabet of a unity that may some day
  comprehend the whole earth. The menfolk kept together by the dozen and by the
  score. By ones and twos and threes therefore the grisly folk were beset and
  slain, until there were no more of them left in the world.</p>

  <p>Generation after generation, age after age, that long struggle for
  existence went on between these men who were not quite men and the men, our
  ancestors, who came out of the south into western Europe. Thousands of fights
  and hunts, sudden murders and headlong escapes there were amidst the caves
  and thickets of that chill and windy world between the last age of glaciers
  and our own warmer time. Until at length the last poor grisly was brought to
  bay and faced the spears of his pursuers in anger and despair.</p>

  <p>What leapings of the heart were there not throughout that long warfare!
  What moments of terror and triumph! What acts of devotion and desperate
  wonders of courage! And the strain of the victors was our strain; we are
  lineally identical with those sun-brown painted beings who ran and fought and
  helped one another, the blood in our veins glowed in those fights and chilled
  in those fears of the forgotten past. For it was forgotten. Except perhaps
  for some vague terrors in our dreaming life and for some lurking element of
  tradition in the legends and warnings of the nursery, it has gone altogether
  out of the memory of our race. But nothing is ever completely lost. Seventy
  or eighty years ago a few curious <i>savants</i> began to suspect that there
  were hidden memories in certain big chipped flints and scraps of bone they
  found in ancient gravels. Much more recently others have begun to find hints
  of remote strange experiences in the dreams and odd kinks in modern minds. By
  degrees these dry bones begin to live again.</p>

  <p>This restoration of the past is one of the most astonishing adventures of
  the human mind. As humanity follows the gropings of scientific men among
  these ancient vestiges, it is like a man who turns over the yellow pages of
  some long-forgotten diary, some engagement book of his adolescence. His dead
  youth lives again. Once more the old excitements stir him, the old happiness
  returns. But the old passions that once burnt, only warm him now, and the old
  fears and distresses signify nothing.</p>

  <p>A day may come when these recovered memories may grow as if we in our own
  persons had been there and shared the thrill and the fear of those primordial
  days; a day may come when the great beasts of the past will leap to life
  again in our imaginations, when we shall walk again in vanished scenes,
  stretch painted limbs we thought were dust, and feel again the sunshine of a
  million years ago.</p>

     name="story72">THE PEARL OF LOVE</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, December 1925</h3>

  <p>The pearl is lovelier than the most brilliant of crystalline stones, the
  moralist declares, because it is made through the suffering of a living
  creature. About that I can say nothing because I feel none of the fascination
  of pearls. Their cloudy lustre moves me not at all. Nor can I decide for
  myself upon that agelong dispute whether The Pearl of Love is the cruellest
  of stories or only a gracious fable of the immortality of beauty.</p>

  <p>Both the story and the controversy will be familiar to students of
  mediaeval Persian prose. The story is a short one, though the commentary upon
  it is a respectable part of the literature of that period. They have treated
  it as a poetic invention and they have treated it as an allegory meaning
  this, that, or the other thing. Theologians have had their copious way with
  it, dealing with it particularly as concerning the restoration of the body
  after death, and it has been greatly used as a parable by those who write
  about aesthetics. And many have held it to be the statement of a fact, simply
  and baldly true.</p>

  <p>The story is laid in North India, which is the most fruitful soil for
  sublime love stories of all the lands in the world. It was in a country of
  sunshine and lakes and rich forests and hills and fertile valleys; and far
  away the great mountains hung in the sky, peaks, crests, and ridges of
  inaccessible and eternal snow. There was a young prince, lord of all the
  land; and he found a maiden of indescribable beauty and delightfulness and he
  made her his queen and laid his heart at her feet. Love was theirs, full of
  joys and sweetness, full of hope, exquisite, brave and marvellous love,
  beyond anything you have ever dreamt of love. It was theirs for a year and a
  part of a year; and then suddenly, because of some venomous sting that came
  to her in a thicket, she died.</p>

  <p>She died and for a while the prince was utterly prostrated. He was silent
  and motionless with grief. They feared he might kill himself, and he had
  neither sons nor brothers to succeed him. For two days and nights he lay upon
  his face, fasting, across the foot of the couch which bore her calm and
  lovely body. Then he arose and ate, and went about very quietly like one who
  has taken a great resolution. He caused her body to be put in a coffin of
  lead mixed with silver, and for that he had an outer coffin made of the most
  precious and scented woods wrought with gold, and about that there was to be
  a sarcophagus of alabaster, inlaid with precious stones. And while these
  things were being done he spent his time for the most part by the pools and
  in the garden-houses and pavilions and groves and in those chambers in the
  palace where they two had been most together, brooding upon her loveliness.
  He did not rend his garments nor defile himself with ashes and sackcloth as
  the custom was, for his love was too great for such extravagances. At last he
  came forth again among his councillors and before the people, and told them
  what he had a mind to do.</p>

  <p>He said he could never more touch woman, he could never more think of
  them, and so he would find a seemly youth to adopt for his heir and train him
  to his task, and that he would do his princely duties as became him; but that
  for the rest of it, he would give himself with all his power and all his
  strength and all his wealth, all that he could command, to make a monument
  worthy of his incomparable, dear, lost mistress. A building it should be of
  perfect grace and beauty, more marvellous than any other building had ever
  been or could ever be, so that to the end of time it should be a wonder, and
  men would treasure it and speak of it and desire to see it and come from all
  the lands of the earth to visit and recall the name and the memory of his
  queen. And this building he said was to be called the Pearl of Love.</p>

  <p>And this his councillors and people permitted him to do, and so he
  did.</p>

  <p>Year followed year and all the years he devoted himself to building and
  adorning the Pearl of Love. A great foundation was hewn out of the living
  rock in a place whence one seemed to be looking at the snowy wilderness of
  the great mountain across the valley of the world. Villages and hills there
  were, a winding river, and very far away three great cities. Here they put
  the sarcophagus of alabaster beneath a pavilion of cunning workmanship; and
  about it there were set pillars of strange and lovely stone and wrought and
  fretted walls, and a great casket of masonry bearing a dome and pinnacles and
  cupolas, as exquisite as a jewel. At first the design of the Pearl of Love
  was less bold and subtle than it became later. At first it was smaller and
  more wrought and encrusted; there were many pierced screens and delicate
  clusters of rosy-hued pillars, and the sarcophagus lay like a child that
  sleeps among flowers. The first dome was covered with green tiles, framed and
  held together by silver, but this was taken away again because it seemed
  close, because it did not soar grandly enough for the broadening imagination
  of the prince.</p>

  <p>For by this time he was no longer the graceful youth who had loved the
  girl queen. He was now a man, grave and intent, wholly set upon the building
  of the Pearl of Love. With every year of effort he had learnt new
  possibilities in arch and wall and buttress; he had acquired greater power
  over the material he had to use and he had learnt of a hundred stones and
  hues and effects that he could never have thought of in the beginning. His
  sense of colour had grown finer and colder; he cared no more for the
  enamelled gold-lined brightness that had pleased him first, the brightness of
  an illuminated missal; he sought now for blue colourings like the sky and for
  the subtle hues of great distances, for recondite shadows and sudden broad
  floods of purple opalescence and for grandeur and space. He wearied
  altogether of carvings and pictures and inlaid ornamentation and all the
  little careful work of men. "Those were pretty things," he said of his
  earlier decorations; and had them put aside into subordinate buildings where
  they would not hamper his main design. Greater and greater grew his artistry.
  With awe and amazement people saw the Pearl of Love sweeping up from its
  first beginnings to a superhuman breadth and height and magnificence. They
  did not know clearly what they had expected, but never had they expected so
  sublime a thing as this. "Wonderful are the miracles," they whispered, "that
  love can do," and all the women in the world, whatever other loves they had,
  loved the prince for the splendour of his devotion.</p>

  <p>Through the middle of the building ran a great aisle, a vista, that the
  prince came to care for more and more. From the inner entrance of the
  building he looked along the length of an immense pillared gallery and across
  the central area from which the rose-hued columns had long since vanished,
  over the top of the pavilion under which lay the sarcophagus, through a
  marvellously designed opening, to the snowy wildernesses of the great
  mountain, the lord of all mountains, two hundred miles away. The pillars and
  arches and buttresses and galleries soared and floated on either side,
  perfect yet unobtrusive, like great archangels waiting in the shadows about
  the presence of God. When men saw that austere beauty for the first time they
  were exalted, and then they shivered and their hearts bowed down. Very often
  would the prince come to stand there and look at that vista, deeply moved and
  not yet fully satisfied. The Pearl of Love had still something for him to do,
  he felt, before his task was done. Always he would order some little
  alteration to be made or some recent alterations to be put back again. And
  one day he said that the sarcophagus would be clearer and simpler without the
  pavilion; and after regarding it very steadfastly for a long time, he had the
  pavilion dismantled and removed.</p>

  <p>The next day he came and said nothing, and the next day and the next. Then
  for two days he stayed away altogether. Then he returned, bringing with him
  an architect and two master craftsmen and a small retinue.</p>

  <p>All looked, standing together silently in a little group, amidst the
  serene vastness of their achievement. No trace of toil remained in its
  perfection. It was as if the God of nature's beauty had taken over their
  offspring to himself.</p>

  <p>Only one thing there was to mar the absolute harmony. There was a certain
  disproportion about the sarcophagus. It had never been enlarged, and indeed
  how could it have been enlarged since the early days. It challenged the eye;
  it nicked the streaming lines. In that sarcophagus was the casket of lead and
  silver, and in the casket of lead and silver was the queen, the dear immortal
  cause of all this beauty. But now that sarcophagus seemed no more than a
  little dark oblong that lay incongruously in the great vista of the Pearl of
  Love. It was as if someone had dropped a small valise upon the crystal sea of
  heaven.</p>

  <p>Long the prince mused, but no one knew the thoughts that passed through
  his mind.</p>

  <p>At last he spoke. He pointed.</p>

  <p>"Take that thing away," he said.</p>

     name="story73">THE QUEER STORY OF BROWNLOW'S NEWSPAPER</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Ladies Home Journal</i>, February 1932</h3>

  <h2>1</h2>

  <p>I call this a Queer Story because it is a story without an explanation.
  When I first heard it, in scraps, from Brownlow I found it queer and
  incredible. But&mdash;it refuses to remain incredible. After resisting and
  then questioning and scrutinizing and falling back before the evidence, after
  rejecting all his evidence as an elaborate mystification and refusing to hear
  any more about it, and then being drawn to reconsider it by an irresistible
  curiosity and so going through it all again, I have been forced to the
  conclusion that Brownlow, so far as he can tell the truth, has been telling
  the truth. But it remains queer truth, queer and exciting to the imagination.
  The more credible his story becomes the queerer it is. It troubles my mind. I
  am fevered by it, infected not with germs but with notes of interrogation and
  unsatisfied curiosity.</p>

  <p>Brownlow is, I admit, a cheerful spirit. I have known him tell lies. But I
  have never known him do anything so elaborate and sustained as this affair,
  if it is a mystification, would have to be. He is incapable of anything so
  elaborate and sustained. He is too lazy and easy-going for anything of the
  sort. And he would have laughed. At some stage he would have laughed and
  given the whole thing away. He has nothing to gain by keeping it up. His
  honour is not in the case either way. And after all there is his bit of
  newspaper in evidence&mdash;and the scrap of an addressed wrapper...</p>

  <p>I realize it will damage this story for many readers that it opens with
  Brownlow in a state very definitely on the gayer side of sobriety. He was not
  in a mood for cool and calculated observation, much less for accurate record.
  He was seeing things in an exhilarated manner. He was disposed to see them
  and greet them cheerfully and let them slip by out of attention. The
  limitations of time and space lay lightly upon him. It was after midnight. He
  had been dining with friends.</p>

  <p>I have inquired what friends&mdash;and satisfied myself upon one or two
  obvious possibilities of that dinner party. They were, he said to me, "just
  friends. They hadn't anything to do with it." I don't usually push past an
  assurance of this sort, but I made an exception in this case. I watched my
  man and took a chance of repeating the question. There was nothing out of the
  ordinary about that dinner party, unless it was the fact that it was an
  unusually good dinner party. The host was Redpath Baynes, the solicitor, and
  the dinner was in his house in St. John's Wood. Gifford, of the <i>Evening
  Telegraph</i>, whom I know slightly, was, I found, present, and from him I
  got all I wanted to know. There was much bright and discursive talk and
  Brownlow had been inspired to give an imitation of his aunt, Lady
  Clitherholme, reproving an inconsiderate plumber during some re-building
  operations at Clitherholme. This early memory had been received with
  considerable merriment&mdash;he was always very good about his aunt, Lady
  Clitherholme&mdash;and Brownlow had departed obviously elated by this little
  social success and the general geniality of the occasion. Had they talked, I
  asked, about the Future, or Einstein, or J.W. Dunne, or any such high and
  serious topic at that party? They had not. Had they discussed the modern
  newspaper? No. There had been nobody whom one could call a practical joker at
  this party, and Brownlow had gone off alone in a taxi. That is what I was
  most desirous of knowing. He had been duly delivered by his taxi at the main
  entrance to Sussex Court.</p>

  <p>Nothing untoward is to be recorded of his journey in the lift to the fifth
  floor of Sussex Court. The liftman on duty noted nothing exceptional. I asked
  if Brownlow said, "Good night." The liftman does not remember. "Usually he
  says Night O," reflected the liftman&mdash;manifestly doing his best and with
  nothing particular to recall. And there the fruits of my inquiries about the
  condition of Brownlow on this particular evening conclude. The rest of the
  story comes directly from him. My investigations arrive only at this: he was
  certainly not drunk. But he was lifted a little out of our normal harsh and
  grinding contact with the immediate realities of existence. Life was glowing
  softly and warmly in him, and the unexpected could happen brightly, easily,
  and acceptably.</p>

  <p>He went down the long passage with its red carpet, its clear light, and
  its occasional oaken doors, each with its artistic brass number. I have been
  down that passage with him on several occasions. It was his custom to enliven
  that corridor by raising his hat gravely as he passed each entrance, saluting
  his unknown and invisible neighbours, addressing them softly but distinctly
  by playful if sometimes slightly indecorous names of his own devising,
  expressing good wishes or paying them little compliments.</p>

  <p>He came at last to his own door, number 49, and let himself in without
  serious difficulty. He switched on his hall light. Scattered on the polished
  oak floor and invading his Chinese carpet were a number of letters and
  circulars, the evening's mail. His parlourmaid-housekeeper who slept in a
  room in another part of the building, had been taking her evening out, or
  these letters would have been gathered up and put on the desk in his bureau.
  As it was, they lay on the floor. He closed his door behind him or it closed
  of its own accord; he took off his coat and wrap, placed his hat on the head
  of the Greek charioteer whose bust adorns his hall, and set himself to pick
  up his letters.</p>

  <p>This also he succeeded in doing without misadventure. He was a little
  annoyed to miss the <i>Evening Standard</i>. It is his custom, he says, to
  subscribe for the afternoon edition of the Star to read at tea-time and also
  for the final edition of the <i>Evening Standard</i> to turn over the last
  thing at night, if only on account of Low's cartoon. He gathered up all these
  envelopes and packets and took them with him into his little sitting-room.
  There he turned on the electric heater, mixed himself a weak whisky-and-soda,
  went to his bedroom to put on soft slippers and replace his smoking jacket by
  a frogged jacket of llama wool, returned to his sitting-room, lit a
  cigarette, and sat down in his arm-chair by the reading lamp to examine his
  correspondence. He recalls all these details very exactly. They were routines
  he had repeated scores of times.</p>

  <p>Brownlow's is not a preoccupied mind; it goes out to things. He is one of
  those buoyant extroverts who open and read all their letters and circulars
  whenever they can get hold of them. In the daytime his secretary intercepts
  and deals with most of them, but at night he escapes from her control and
  does what he pleases, that is to say, he opens everything.</p>

  <p>He ripped up various envelopes. There was a formal acknowledgment of a
  business letter he had dictated the day before, there was a letter from his
  solicitor asking for some details about a settlement he was making, there was
  an offer from some unknown gentleman with an aristocratic name to lend him
  money on his note of hand alone, and there was a notice about a proposed new
  wing to his club. "Same old stuff," he sighed. "Same old stuff. What bores
  they all are!" He was always hoping, like every man who is proceeding across
  the plains of middle-age, that his correspondence would contain agreeable
  surprises&mdash;and it never did. Then, as he put it to me, <i>inter
  alia</i>, he picked up the remarkable newspaper.</p><br>

  <h2>2</h2>

  <p>It was different in appearance from an ordinary newspaper, but not so
  different as not to be recognizable as a newspaper, and he was surprised, he
  says, not to have observed it before. It was enclosed in a wrapper of pale
  green, but it was unstamped; apparently it had been delivered not by the
  postman, but by some other hand. (This wrapper still exists; I have seen it.)
  He had already torn it off before he noted that he was not the addressee.</p>

  <p>For a moment or so he remained looking at this address, which struck him
  as just a little odd. It was printed in rather unusual type: "Evan O'Hara
  Mr., Sussex Court 49."</p>

  <p>"Wrong name," said Mr. Brownlow; "Right address. Rummy. Sussex Court 49...
  'Spose he's got my Evening Standard... 'Change no robbery."</p>

  <p>He put the torn wrapper with his unanswered letters and opened out the
  newspaper.</p>

  <p>The title of the paper was printed in large slightly ornamental black-
  green letters that might have come from a kindred fount to that responsible
  for the address. But, as he read it, it was the <i>Evening Standard!</i> Or,
  at least, it was the "Even Standrd." "Silly," said Brownlow. "It's some damn
  Irish paper. Can't spell&mdash;anything&mdash;these Irish..."</p>

  <p>He had, I think, a passing idea, suggested perhaps by the green wrapper
  and the green ink, that it was a lottery stunt from Dublin.</p>

  <p>Still, if there was anything to read he meant to read it. He surveyed the
  front page. Across this ran a streamer headline:</p>

  <p class="headline">"WILTON BORING REACHES SEVEN MILES: SUCCES ASSURED."</p>

  <p>"No," said Brownlow. "It must be oil... Illiterate lot these oil chaps
  &mdash;leave out the 's' in 'success.'"</p>

  <p>He held the paper down on his knee for a moment, reinforced himself by a
  drink, took and lit a second cigarette, and then leant back in his chair to
  take a dispassionate view of any oil-share pushing that might be afoot.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't an affair of oil. It was, it began to dawn upon him,
  something stranger than oil. He found himself surveying a real evening
  newspaper, which was dealing, so far as he could see at the first onset, with
  the affairs of another world.</p>

  <p>He had for a moment a feeling as though he and his arm-chair and his
  little sitting-room were afloat in a vast space and then it all seemed to
  become firm and solid again.</p>

  <p>This thing in his hands was plainly and indisputably a printed newspaper.
  It was a little odd in its letterpress, and it didn't feel or rustle like
  ordinary paper, but newspaper it was. It was printed in either three or four
  columns&mdash;for the life of him he cannot remember which&mdash;and there
  were column headlines under the page streamer. It had a sort of art-nouveau
  affair at the bottom of one column that might be an advertisement (it showed
  a woman in an impossibly big hat), and in the upper left-hand corner was an
  unmistakable weather chart of Western Europe, with <i>coloured</i> isobars,
  or isotherms, or whatever they are, and the inscription: "To-morrow's
  Weather."</p>

  <p>And then he remarked the date. The date was November 10th, 1971!</p>

  <p>"Steady on," said Brownlow. "Damitall! Steady on."</p>

  <p>He held the paper sideways, and then straight again. The date remained
  November 10th, 1971.</p>

  <p>He got up in a state of immense perplexity and put the paper down. For a
  moment he felt a little afraid of it. He rubbed his forehead. "Haven't been
  doing a Rip Van Winkle, by any chance, Brownlow, my boy?" he said. He picked
  up the paper again, walked out into his hall and looked at himself in the
  hall mirror. He was reassured to see no signs of advancing age, but the
  expression of mingled consternation and amazement upon his flushed face
  struck him suddenly as being undignified and unwarrantable. He laughed at
  himself, but not uncontrollably. Then he stared blankly at that familiar
  countenance. "I must be half-way <i>tordu</i>" he said, that being his
  habitual facetious translation of "screwed." On the console table was a
  little respectable-looking adjustable calendar bearing witness that the date
  was November 10th, 1931.</p>

  <p>"D'you see?" he said, shaking the queer newspaper at it reproachfully. "I
  ought to have spotted you for a hoax ten minutes ago. 'Moosing trick, to say
  the least of it. I suppose they've made Low editor for a night, and he's had
  this idea. Eh?"</p>

  <p>He felt he had been taken in, but that the joke was a good one. And, with
  quite unusual anticipations of entertainment, he returned to his arm-chair. A
  good idea it was, a paper forty years ahead. Good fun if it was well done.
  For a time nothing but the sounds of a newspaper being turned over and
  Brownlow's breathing can have broken the silence of the flat.</p><br>

  <h2>3</h2>

  <p>Regarded as an imaginative creation, he found the thing almost too well
  done. Every time he turned a page he expected the sheet to break out into
  laughter and give the whole thing away. But it did nothing of the kind. From
  being a mere quip, it became an immense and amusing, if perhaps a little
  over-elaborate, lark. And then, as a lark, it passed from stage to stage of
  incredibility until, as any thing but the thing it professed to be, it was
  incredible altogether. It must have cost far more than an ordinary number.
  All sorts of colours were used, and suddenly he came upon illustrations that
  went beyond amazement; they were in the colours of reality. Never in all his
  life had he seen such colour printing&mdash;and the buildings and scenery and
  costumes in the pictures were strange. Strange and yet credible. They were
  colour photographs of actuality forty years from now. He could not believe
  anything else of them. Doubt could not exist in their presence.</p>

  <p>His mind had swung back, away from the stunt-number idea altogether. This
  paper in his hand would not simply be costly beyond dreaming to produce. At
  any price it could not be produced. All this present world could not produce
  such an object as this paper he held in his hand. He was quite capable of
  realizing that.</p>

  <p>He sat turning the sheet over and&mdash;quite mechanically&mdash;drinking
  whisky. His sceptical faculties were largely in suspense; the barriers of
  criticism were down. His mind could now accept the idea that he was reading a
  newspaper of forty years ahead without any further protest.</p>

  <p>It had been addressed to Mr. Evan O'Hara, and it had come to him. Well and
  good. This Evan O'Hara evidently knew how to get ahead of things...</p>

  <p>I doubt if at that time Brownlow found anything very wonderful in the
  situation.</p>

  <p>Yet it was, it continues to be, a very wonderful situation. The wonder of
  it mounts to my head as I write. Only gradually have I been able to build up
  this picture of Brownlow turning over that miraculous sheet, so that I can
  believe it myself. And you will understand how, as the thing flickered
  between credibility and incredibility in my mind, I asked him, partly to
  justify or confute what he told me, and partly to satisfy a vast expanding
  and, at last, devouring curiosity: "What was there in it? What did it have to
  say?" At the same time, I found myself trying to catch him out in his story,
  and also asking him for every particular he could give me.</p>

  <p>What was there in it? In other words, What will the world be doing forty
  years from now? That was the stupendous scale of the vision, of which
  Brownlow was afforded a glimpse. The world forty years from now! I lie awake
  at nights thinking of all that paper might have revealed to us. Much it did
  reveal, but there is hardly a thing it reveals that does not change at once
  into a constellation of riddles. When first he told me about the thing I
  was&mdash;it is, I admit, an enormous pity&mdash;intensely sceptical. I asked
  him questions in what people call a "nasty" manner. I was ready&mdash;as my
  manner made plain to him&mdash;to jump down his throat with "But that's
  preposterous!" at the very first slip. And I had an engagement that carried
  me off at the end of half an hour. But the thing had already got hold of my
  imagination, and I rang up Brownlow before tea-time, and was biting at this
  "queer story" of his again. That afternoon he was sulking because of my
  morning's disbelief, and he told me very little. "I was drunk and dreaming, I
  suppose," he said. "I'm beginning to doubt it all myself." In the night it
  occurred to me for the first time that, if he was not allowed to tell and put
  on record what he had seen, he might become both confused and sceptical about
  it himself. Fancies might mix up with it. He might hedge and alter to get it
  more credible. Next day, therefore, I lunched and spent the afternoon with
  him, and arranged to go down into Surrey for the week-end. I managed to
  dispel his huffiness with me. My growing keenness restored his. There we set
  ourselves in earnest, first of all to recover everything he could remember
  about his newspaper and then to form some coherent idea of the world about
  which it was telling.</p>

  <p>It is perhaps a little banal to say we were not trained men for the job.
  For who could be considered trained for such a job as we were attempting?
  What facts was he to pick out as important and how were they to be arranged?
  We wanted to know everything we could about 1971; and the little facts and
  the big facts crowded on one another and offended against each other.</p>

  <p>The streamer headline across the page about that seven-mile Wilton boring,
  is, to my mind, one of the most significant items in the story. About that we
  are fairly clear. It referred, says Brownlow, to a series of attempts to tap
  the supply of heat beneath the surface of the earth. I asked various
  questions. "It was <i>explained</i>, y'know," said Brownlow, and smiled and
  held out a hand with twiddling fingers. "It was explained all right. Old
  system, they said, was to go down from a few hundred feet to a mile or so and
  bring up coal and burn it. Go down a bit deeper, and there's no need to bring
  up and burn anything. Just get heat itself straightaway. Comes up of its own
  accord&mdash;under its own steam. See? Simple.</p>

  <p>"They were making a big fuss about it," he added. "It wasn't only the
  streamer headline; there was a leading article in big type. What was it
  headed? Ah! The Age of Combustion has Ended!"</p>

  <p>Now that is plainly a very big event for mankind, caught in mid-
  happening, November 10th, 1971. And the way in which Brownlow describes it as
  being handled, shows clearly a world much more preoccupied by economic
  essentials than the world of to-day, and dealing with them on a larger scale
  and in a bolder spirit.</p>

  <p>That excitement about tapping the central reservoirs of heat, Brownlow was
  very definite, was not the only symptom of an increase in practical economic
  interest and intelligence. There was much more space given to scientific work
  and to inventions than is given in any contemporary paper. There were
  diagrams and mathematical symbols, he says, but he did not look into them
  very closely because he could not get the hang of them. "<i>Frightfully</i>
  highbrow, some of it," he said.</p>

  <p>A more intelligent world for our grandchildren evidently, and also, as the
  pictures testified, a healthier and happier world.</p>

  <p>"The fashions kept you looking," said Brownlow, going off at a tangent,
  "all coloured up as they were."</p>

  <p>"Were they elaborate?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Anything <i>but</i>" he said.</p>

  <p>His description of these costumes is vague. The people depicted in the
  social illustrations and in the advertisements seemed to have reduced body
  clothing&mdash;I mean things like vests, pants, socks and so forth&mdash;to a
  minimum. Breast and chest went bare. There seem to have been tremendously
  exaggerated wristlets, mostly on the left arm and going as far up as the
  elbow, provided with gadgets which served the purpose of pockets. Most of
  these armlets seem to have been very decorative, almost like little shields.
  And then, usually, there was an immense hat, often rolled up and carried in
  the hand, and long cloaks of the loveliest colours and evidently also of the
  most beautiful soft material, which either trailed from a sort of gorget or
  were gathered up and wrapped about the naked body, or were belted up or
  thrown over the shoulders.</p>

  <p>There were a number of pictures of crowds from various parts of the world.
  "The people looked fine," said Brownlow. "Prosperous, you know, and
  upstanding. Some of the women&mdash;just lovely."</p>

  <p>My mind went off to India. What was happening in India?</p>

  <p>Brownlow could not remember anything very much about India. "Ankor," said
  Brownlow. "That's not India, is it?" There had been some sort of Carnival
  going on amidst "perfectly lovely" buildings in the sunshine of Ankor.</p>

  <p>The people there were brownish people but they were dressed very much like
  the people in other parts of the world.</p>

  <p>I found the politician stirring in me. Was there really nothing about
  India? Was he sure of that? There was certainly nothing that had left any
  impression in Brownlow's mind. And Soviet Russia? "Not as Soviet Russia,"
  said Brownlow. All that trouble had ceased to be a matter of daily interest.
  "And how was France getting on with Germany?" Brownlow could not recall a
  mention of either of these two great powers. Nor of the British Empire as
  such, nor of the U.S.A. There was no mention of any interchanges,
  communications, ambassadors, conferences, competitions, comparisons,
  stresses, in which these governments figured, so far as he could remember. He
  racked his brains. I thought perhaps all that had been going on so entirely
  like it goes on to-day&mdash;and has been going on for the last hundred
  years&mdash;that he had run his eyes over the passages in question and that
  they had left no distinctive impression on his mind. But he is positive that
  it was not like that. "All that stuff was washed out," he said. He is
  unshaken in his assertion that there were no elections in progress, no notice
  of Parliament or politicians, no mention of Geneva or anything about
  armaments or war. All those main interests of a contemporary journal seem to
  have been among the "washed out" stuff. It isn't that Brownlow didn't notice
  them very much; he is positive they were not there.</p>

  <p>Now to me this is a very wonderful thing indeed. It means, I take it, that
  in only forty years from now the great game of sovereign states will be over.
  It looks also as if the parliamentary game will be over, and as if some quite
  new method of handling human affairs will have been adopted. Not a word of
  patriotism or nationalism; not a word of party, not an allusion. But in only
  forty years! While half the human beings already alive in the world will
  still be living! You cannot believe it for a moment. Nor could I, if it
  wasn't for two little torn scraps of paper. These, as I will make clear,
  leave me in a state of&mdash;how can I put it?&mdash;incredulous
  belief.</p><br>

  <h2>4</h2>

  <p>After all, in 1831 very few people thought of railway or steamship travel,
  and in 1871 you could already go round the world in eighty days by steam, and
  send a telegram in a few minutes to nearly every part of the earth. Who would
  have thought of that in 1831? Revolutions in human life, when they begin to
  come, can come very fast. Our ideas and methods change faster than we
  know.</p>

  <p>But just forty years!</p>

  <p>It was not only that there was this absence of national politics from that
  evening paper, but there was something else still more fundamental. Business,
  we both think, finance that is, was not in evidence, at least upon anything
  like contemporary lines. We are not quite sure of that, but that is our
  impression. There was no list of Stock Exchange prices. for example, no City
  page, and nothing in its place. I have suggested already that Brownlow just
  turned that page over, and that it was sufficiently like what it is to-day
  that he passed and forgot it. I have put that suggestion to him. But he is
  quite sure that that was not the case. Like most of us nowadays, he is
  watching a number of his investments rather nervously, and he is convinced he
  looked for the City article.</p>

  <p>November 10th, 1971, may have been Monday&mdash;there seems to have been
  some readjustment of the months and the days of the week; that is a detail
  into which I will not enter now&mdash;but that will not account for the
  absence of any City news at all. That also, it seems, will be washed out
  forty years from now.</p>

  <p>Is there some tremendous revolutionary smash-up ahead, then? Which will
  put an end to investment and speculation? Is the world going Bolshevik? In
  the paper, anyhow, there was no sign of, or reference to, anything of that
  kind. Yet against this idea of some stupendous economic revolution we have
  the fact that here forty years ahead is a familiar London evening paper still
  tumbling into a private individual's letter-box in the most uninterrupted
  manner. Not much suggestion of a social smash-up there. Much stronger is the
  effect of immense changes which have come about bit by bit, day by day, and
  hour by hour, without any sort of revolutionary jolt, as morning or
  springtime comes to the world.</p>

  <p>These futile speculations are irresistible. The reader must forgive me
  them. Let me return to our story.</p>

  <p>There had been a picture of a landslide near Ventimiglia and one of some
  new chemical works at Salzburg, and there had been a picture of fighting
  going on near Irkutsk. (Of that picture, as I will tell presently, a fading
  scrap survives.) "Now that was called&mdash;" Brownlow made an effort, and
  snapped his fingers triumphantly. "&mdash;'Round-up of Brigands by Federal
  Police.'"</p>

  <p>"<i>What Federal Police?</i>" I asked.</p>

  <p>"There you have me," said Brownlow. "The fellows on both sides looked
  mostly Chinese, but there were one or two taller fellows, who might have been
  Americans or British or Scandinavians.</p>

  <p>"What filled a lot of the paper," said Brownlow, suddenly, "was gorillas.
  There was no end of a fuss about gorillas. Not so much as about that boring,
  but still a lot of fuss. Photographs. A map. A special article and some
  paragraphs."</p>

  <p>The paper, had, in fact, announced the death of the last gorilla.
  Considerable resentment was displayed at the tragedy that had happened in the
  African gorilla reserve. The gorilla population of the world had been
  dwindling for many years. In 1931 it had been estimated at nine hundred. When
  the Federal Board took over it had shrunken to three hundred.</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i> Federal Board?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Brownlow knew no more than I did. When he read the phrase, it had seemed
  all right somehow. Apparently this Board had had too much to do all at once,
  and insufficient resources. I had the impression at first that it must be
  some sort of conservation board, improvised under panic conditions, to save
  the rare creatures of the world threatened with extinction. The gorillas had
  not been sufficiently observed and guarded, and they had been swept out of
  existence suddenly by a new and malignant form of influenza. The thing had
  happened practically before it was remarked. The paper was clamouring for
  inquiry and drastic changes of reorganization.</p>

  <p>This Federal Board, whatever it might be, seemed to be something of very
  considerable importance in the year 1971. Its name turned up again in an
  article of afforestation. This interested Brownlow considerably because he
  has large holdings in lumber companies. This Federal Board was apparently not
  only responsible for the maladies of wild gorillas but also for the
  plantation of trees in&mdash;just note these names!&mdash;Canada, New York
  State, Siberia, Algiers, and the East Coast of England, and it was arraigned
  for various negligences in combating insect pests and various fungoid plant
  diseases. It jumped all our contemporary boundaries in the most astounding
  way. Its range was world-wide. "In spite of the recent additional
  restrictions put upon the use of big timber in building and furnishing, there
  is a plain possibility of a shortage of shelter timber and of rainfall in
  nearly all the threatened regions for 1985 onwards. Admittedly the Federal
  Board has come late to its task, from the beginning its work has been urgency
  work; but in view of the lucid report prepared by the James Commission, there
  is little or no excuse for the inaggressiveness and over-confidence it has
  displayed."</p>

  <p>I am able to quote this particular article because as a matter of fact it
  lies before me as I write. It is indeed, as I will explain, all that remains
  of this remarkable newspaper. The rest has been destroyed and all we can ever
  know of it now is through Brownlow's sound but not absolutely trustworthy
  memory.</p><br>

  <h2>5</h2>

  <p>My mind, as the days pass, hangs on to that Federal Board. Does that
  phrase mean, as just possibly it may mean, a world federation, a scientific
  control of all human life only forty years from now? I find that
  idea&mdash;staggering. I have always believed that the world was destined to
  unify&mdash;"Parliament of Mankind and Confederation of the World," as
  Tennyson put it&mdash;but I have always supposed that the process would take
  centuries. But then my time sense is poor. My disposition has always been to
  under-estimate the pace of change. I wrote in 1900 that there would be
  aeroplanes "in fifty years' time." And the confounded things were buzzing
  about everywhere and carrying passengers before 1920.</p>

  <p>Let me tell very briefly of the rest of that evening paper. There seemed
  to be a lot of sport and fashion; much about something called "Spectacle"
  &mdash;with pictures&mdash;a lot of illustrated criticism of decorative art
  and particularly of architecture. The architecture in the pictures he saw was
  "towering&mdash;kind of magnificent. Great blocks of building. New York, but
  more so and all run together"... Unfortunately he cannot sketch. There were
  sections devoted to something he couldn't understand, but which he thinks was
  some sort of "radio programme stuff."</p>

  <p>All that suggests a sort of advanced human life very much like the life we
  lead to-day, possibly rather brighter and better. But here is something
  &mdash;different.</p>

  <p>"The birth-rate," said Brownlow, searching his mind, "was seven in the
  thousand."</p>

  <p>I exclaimed. The lowest birth-rates in Europe now are sixteen or more per
  thousand. The Russian birth-rate is forty per thousand, and falling
  slowly.</p>

  <p>"It was seven," said Brownlow. "Exactly seven. I noticed it. In a
  paragraph."</p>

  <p>But what birth-rate, I asked. The British? The European?</p>

  <p>"It said the birth-rate," said Brownlow. "Just that." That I think is the
  most tantalizing item in all this strange glimpse of the world of our
  grandchildren. A birth-rate of seven in the thousand does not mean a fixed
  world population; it means a population that is being reduced at a very rapid
  rate&mdash;unless the death-rate has gone still lower. Quite possibly people
  will not be dying so much then, but living very much longer. On that Brownlow
  could throw no light. The people in the pictures did not look to him an "old
  lot." There were plenty of children and young or young-looking people
  about.</p>

  <p>"But Brownlow," I said, "wasn't there any crime?"</p>

  <p>"Rather," said Brownlow. "They had a big poisoning case on, but it was
  jolly hard to follow. You know how it is with these crimes. Unless you've
  read about it from the beginning, it's hard to get the hang of the situation.
  No newspaper has found out that for every crime it ought to give a summary
  up-to-date every day&mdash;and forty years ahead, they hadn't. Or they aren't
  going to. Whichever way you like to put it.</p>

  <p>"There were several crimes and what newspaper men call stories," he
  resumed; "personal stories. What struck me about it was that they seemed to
  be more sympathetic than our reporters, more concerned with the motives and
  less with just finding someone out. What you might call
  psychological&mdash;so to speak."</p>

  <p>"Was there anything much about books?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember anything about books," he said...</p>

  <p>And that is all. Except for a few trifling details such as a possible
  thirteenth month inserted in the year, that is all. It is intolerably
  tantalizing. That is the substance of Brownlow's account of his newspaper. He
  read it&mdash;as one might read any newspaper. He was just in that state of
  alcoholic comfort when nothing is incredible and so nothing is really
  wonderful. He knew he was reading an evening newspaper of forty years ahead
  and he sat in front of his fire, and smoked and sipped his drink and was no
  more perturbed than he would have been if he had been reading an imaginative
  book about the future.</p>

  <p>Suddenly his little brass clock pinged Two.</p>

  <p>He got up and yawned. He put that astounding, that miraculous newspaper
  down as he was wont to put any old newspaper down; he carried off his
  correspondence to the desk in his bureau, and with the swift laziness of a
  very tired man he dropped his clothes about his room anyhow and went to
  bed.</p>

  <p>But somewhen in the night he woke up feeling thirsty and grey-minded. He
  lay awake and it came to him that something very strange had occurred to him.
  His mind went back to the idea that he had been taken in by a very ingenious
  fabrication. He got up for a drink of Vichy water and a liver tabloid, he put
  his head in cold water and found himself sitting on his bed towelling his
  hair and doubting whether he had really seen those photographs in the very
  colours of reality itself, or whether he had imagined them. Also running
  through his mind was the thought that the approach of a world timber famine
  for 1985 was something likely to affect his investments and particularly a
  trust he was setting up on behalf of an infant in whom he was interested. It
  might be wise, he thought, to put more into timber.</p>

  <p>He went back down the corridor to his sitting-room. He sat there in his
  dressing-gown, turning over the marvellous sheets. There it was in his hands
  complete in every page, not a corner torn. Some sort of auto-hypnosis, he
  thought, might be at work, but certainly the pictures seemed as real as
  looking out of a window. After he had stared at them some time he went back
  to the timber paragraph. He felt he must keep that. I don't know if you will
  understand how his mind worked&mdash;for my own part I can see at once how
  perfectly irrational and entirely natural it was&mdash;but he took this
  marvellous paper, creased the page in question, tore off this particular
  article and left the rest. He returned very drowsily to his bedroom, put the
  scrap of paper on his dressing-table, got into bed and dropped off to sleep
  at once.</p><br>

  <h2>6</h2>

  <p>When he awoke again it was nine o'clock; his morning tea was untasted by
  his bedside and the room was full of sunshine. His parlourmaid-housekeeper
  had just re-entered the room.</p>

  <p>"You were sleeping so peacefully," she said; "I couldn't bear to wake you.
  Shall I get you a fresh cup of tea?"</p>

  <p>Brownlow did not answer. He was trying to think of something strange that
  had happened.</p>

  <p>She repeated her question.</p>

  <p>"No. I'll come and have breakfast in my dressing-gown before my bath," he
  said, and she went out of the room.</p>

  <p>Then he saw the scrap of paper.</p>

  <p>In a moment he was running down the corridor to the sitting-room. "I left
  a newspaper," he said. "I left a newspaper."</p>

  <p>She came in response to the commotion he made.</p>

  <p>"A newspaper?" she said. "It's been gone this two hours, down the chute,
  with the dust and things."</p>

  <p>Brownlow had a moment of extreme consternation.</p>

  <p>He invoked his God. "I wanted it <i>kept</i>!" he shouted. "I wanted it
  <i>kept</i>."</p>

  <p>"But how was <i>I</i> to know you wanted it kept?"</p>

  <p>"But didn't you notice it was a very extraordinary-looking newspaper?"</p>

  <p>"I've got none too much time to dust out this flat to be looking at
  newspapers," she said. "I thought I saw some coloured photographs of bathing
  ladies and chorus girls in it, but that's no concern of mine. It didn't seem
  a proper newspaper to me. How was I to know you'd be wanting to look at them
  again this morning?"</p>

  <p>"I must get that newspaper back," said Brownlow. "It's&mdash;it's vitally
  important... If all Sussex Court has to be held up I want that newspaper
  back."</p>

  <p>"I've never known a thing come up that chute again," said his housekeeper,
  "that's once gone down it. But I'll telephone down, sir, and see what can be
  done. Most of that stuff goes right into the hot-water furnace, they
  say..."</p>

  <p>It does. The newspaper had gone.</p>

  <p>Brownlow came near raving. By a vast effort of self-control he sat down
  and consumed his cooling breakfast. He kept on saying "Oh, my God!" as he did
  so. In the midst of it he got up to recover the scrap of paper from his
  bedroom, and then found the wrapper addressed to Evan O'Hara among the
  overnight letters on his bureau. That seemed an almost maddening
  confirmation. The thing had happened.</p>

  <p>Presently after he had breakfasted, he rang me up to aid his baffled
  mind.</p>

  <p>I found him at his bureau with the two bits of paper before him. He did
  not speak. He made a solemn gesture.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" I asked, standing before him.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he said. "Tell me. What are these objects? It's serious.
  Either&mdash;" He left the sentence unfinished.</p>

  <p>I picked up the torn wrapper first and felt its texture. "Evan O'Hara,
  Mr.," I read.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Sussex Court, 49. Eh?"</p>

  <p>"Right," I agreed and stared at him.</p>

  <p>"<i>That's</i> not hallucination, eh?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"And now this?" His hand trembled as he held out the cutting. I took
  it.</p>

  <p>"Odd," I said. I stared at the black-green ink, the unfamiliar type, the
  little novelties in spelling. Then I turned the thing over. On the back was a
  piece of one of the illustrations; it was, I suppose, about a quarter of the
  photograph of that "Round-up of Brigands by Federal Police" I have already
  mentioned.</p>

  <p>When I saw it that morning it had not even begun to fade. It represented a
  mass of broken masonry in a sandy waste with bare-looking mountains in the
  distance. The cold, clear atmosphere, the glare of a cloudless afternoon were
  rendered perfectly. In the foreground were four masked men in a brown service
  uniform intent on working some little machine on wheels with a tube and a
  nozzle projecting a jet that went out to the left, where the fragment was
  torn off. I cannot imagine what the jet was doing. Brownlow says he thinks
  they were gassing some men in a hut. Never have I seen such realistic colour
  printing.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is this?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It's <i>that</i>" said Brownlow. "I'm not mad, am I? It's really
  <i>that</i>."</p>

  <p>"But what the devil is it?"</p>

  <p>"It's a piece of a newspaper for November 10th, 1971."</p>

  <p>"You had better explain," I said, and sat down, with the scrap of paper in
  my hand, to hear his story. And, with as much elimination of questions and
  digressions and repetitions as possible, that is the story I have written
  here.</p>

  <p>I said at the beginning that it was a queer story and queer to my mind it
  remains, fantastically queer. I return to it at intervals, and it refuses to
  settle down in my mind as anything but an incongruity with all my experience
  and beliefs. If it were not for the two little bits of paper, one might
  dispose of it quite easily. One might say that Brownlow had had a vision, a
  dream of unparalleled vividness and consistency. Or that he had been hoaxed
  and his head turned by some elaborate mystification. Or, again, one might
  suppose he had really seen into the future with a sort of exaggeration of
  those previsions cited by Mr. J.W. Dunne in his remarkable "Experiment with
  Time." But nothing Mr. Dunne has to advance can account for an actual evening
  paper being slapped through a letter-slit forty years in advance of its
  date.</p>

  <p>The wrapper has not altered in the least since I first saw it. But the
  scrap of paper with the article about afforestation is dissolving into a fine
  powder and the fragment of picture at the back of it is fading out; most of
  the colour has gone and the outlines have lost their sharpness. Some of the
  powder I have taken to my friend Ryder at the Royal College, whose work in
  micro-chemistry is so well known. He says the stuff is not paper at all,
  properly speaking. It is mostly aluminium fortified by admixture with some
  artificial resinous substance.</p><br>

  <h2>7</h2>

  <p>Though I offer no explanation whatever of this affair I think I will
  venture on one little prophesy. I have an obstinate persuasion that on
  November 10th, 1971, the name of the tenant of 49, Sussex Court, will be Mr.
  Evan O'Hara. (There is no tenant of that name now in Sussex Court and I find
  no evidence in the Telephone Directory, or the London Directory, that such a
  person exists anywhere in London.) And on that particular evening forty years
  ahead, he will not get his usual copy of the <i>Even Standrd</i>: instead he
  will get a copy of the <i>Evening Standard</i> of 1931. I have an incurable
  fancy that this will be so.</p>

  <p>There I may be right or wrong, but that Brownlow really got and for two
  remarkable hours, read, a real newspaper forty years ahead of time I am as
  convinced as I am convinced that my own name is Hubert G. Wells. Can I say
  anything stronger than that?</p>
