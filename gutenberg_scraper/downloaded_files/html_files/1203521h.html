     name="ch01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"She is an orphan," said Mr. Collings emotionally.</p>

  <p>Orphans were Mr. Collings' weakness.</p>

  <p>In ordinary intercourse as between lawyer and client, he was a stern,
  reserved man with a cold passion for compromise. Litigants entered his office
  charged with bubbling joy that their enemies had delivered themselves into
  their hands; they came talking five figure damages and the stark ruin of men
  and corporations who and which had offended them. They slunk out again into
  the glare of an Australian sun, their cases demolished, their spirits broken,
  their futures clouded. Mr. Collings did not believe in litigation. He
  believed that things could be arranged.</p>

  <p>If it was possible for a murdered man to walk into Mr. Collings' office
  and say: "I've got an excellent case against Binks: he has just shot me dead.
  Do you think I can get damages?" Mr. Collings would reply: "I very much doubt
  it. There is a great deal to be said for Binks. And aren't you in rather an
  awkward position yourself? You are carrying about a bullet which undoubtedly
  is the property of Binks. You never know what point of view a jury will take.
  You had better let me try to settle this."</p>

  <p>But in the matter of orphans Mr. Collings was slightly unbalanced. He was
  strictly brought up by parents who compelled him to read books on Sunday that
  were entirely devoted to orphans and good organ-grinders and little girls who
  quoted extensively from precious books and died surrounded by weeping
  negroes. In such literature the villains of the piece were young scoundrels
  who surreptitiously threw away their crusts and only ate the crumbly part of
  bread; desperadoes who kicked dogs and threw large flies into spiders' webs
  and watched the spider at his fell work with glee.</p>

  <p>"She is an orphan," said Mr. Collings again, and blew his nose loudly.</p>

  <p>"She has been an orphan for ten years," said Mr. William Cathcart
  cynically.</p>

  <p>Mr. Collings was stout, bald, given to afternoon naps; Mr. Cathcart was
  thin, narrow-faced, not so bald, and never slept at all, so far as anybody
  knew. He hated orphans. They stood for questions of <i>cestui que use</i>,
  problems of <i>cy-pr&egrave;s</i>, perplexities of <i>donatio mortis causa</i> and
  the Guardianship of Infants Act. He never saw an orphan without his hand
  going instinctively to his hip pocket.</p>

  <p>"And the most irregular orphan I have ever met," continued Mr. William
  Cathcart remorselessly. "An infant in law with a bank balance of a hundred
  thousand! I refuse to drop a tear&mdash;positively!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Collings wiped his eyes.</p>

  <p>"She is an orphan," he insisted. "Mrs. Tetherby gave her the money during
  her lifetime: there is nothing irregular in that. If I gave an&mdash;an
  orphan"&mdash;he swallowed hard&mdash;"a penny, a pound&mdash;a
  thousand&mdash;is that a breach of the law, an impropriety, even though it is
  practised <i>de die in diem</i>?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Cathcart considered.</p>

  <p>"You might in certain circumstances be acting <i>de sont tort</i>," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Collings pondered this; found the term almost inapplicable, but not so
  much so that he could be offensive in a gentlemanly way. Wisely he returned
  to lamb.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Tetherby was inert. Stout women are often inert&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lazy," suggested the dyspeptic Cathcart.</p>

  <p>"She was fond of Diana. Few aunts are fond of nieces. Her will proves
  that. She left everything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There was nothing to leave," interrupted Mr. William Cathcart with sour
  satisfaction. How that man hated orphans! "There was nothing to leave because
  in her lifetime she gave Diana full control of her money."</p>

  <p>"She was inert," murmured Mr. Collings. "She loved this orphan
  child&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If there was one woman in the world who ought never to have been
  allowed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never ought have been," corrected Mr. Collings gently.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;to have charge of a girl of Diana Ford's temperament, it is or was
  Mrs. Tetherby. A child of sixteen who has a raging love affair with a
  student&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A theological student," insisted Mr. Collings. "Don't forget that. A
  young woman may well feel that she could give her heart to a theological
  student when a medical student would have revolted all that was most
  sensitive in her nature."</p>

  <p>"A theological student makes it worse."</p>

  <p>"At least Mrs. Tetherby consulted us on that matter." Mr. Collings was a
  shade reproachful. "Inert or energetic, she consulted us."</p>

  <p>"She consulted us to discover whether she would be liable to trial for
  murder if she waylaid and shot Mr. Dempsi. She said that she had set a dog on
  to him, but he was incapable of taking a hint. Those were her words."</p>

  <p>"Dempsi is dead," said Mr. Collings in a hushed voice. "I spoke to Diana
  on the subject only eight months ago&mdash;when her dear aunt died. I asked
  her if the wound had left a scar. She said she scarcely remembered a scratch,
  and that she often amused herself in the evenings by trying to draw him from
  memory."</p>

  <p>"A heartless little devil," said Mr. Cathcart.</p>

  <p>"A child&mdash;youth has no memory, not even for its stomach aches," said
  Mr. Collings oracularly.</p>

  <p>"Did you discuss those too?" sneered his partner.</p>

  <p>Mr. Collings raised his eyebrows. Such a man as he is hopeless in the face
  of sheer vulgarity.</p>

  <p>"An orphan..." he began.</p>

  <p>The clerk at the door spoke in the strained way of managing clerks.</p>

  <p>"Miss Diana Ford, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>The legal house of Collings &amp; Cathcart exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>"Show the young lady in." The door closed. "Be gentle with her,
  William."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cathcart writhed.</p>

  <p>"Will she be gentle with me?" he asked bitterly. "Will you guarantee that
  she will be reasonably polite to me&mdash;and back your guarantee with real
  money?"</p>

  <p>There came through the door a peach tree, blossoming in the spring of the
  year; summer dawn on riverside meadows with the dew winking from a thousand
  gossamers. The froth of hawthorn in an English country lane; a crystal brook
  whispering between slim larches. Miss Diana Ford.</p>

  <p>During the war Mr. Cathcart had held a commission in the Army Service
  Corps (Home Service) and had acquired the inventory habit. He saw:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Girl: Slim, medium size. One.</li>

    <li>Eyes: Grey-blue; large, more or less innocent. Two.</li>

    <li>Mouth: Red, Bow-shaped, largish. One.</li>

    <li>Nose: Straight, in perfect shape. One.</li>

    <li>Hair: Slightly golden, bobbed.</li>

    <li>One complete head.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Diana was as unrecognisable from the inventory as the average man from the
  description on his passport. She had the atmosphere of spring and dawn. Her
  colouring belonged to such season and time, having a pink of its own and a
  whiteness which looked pink when compared with white. She moved with such
  supple grace that Mr. Cathcart suspected an entire absence of
  corsets&mdash;he was a married man.</p>

  <p>She came impulsively to Mr. Collings and kissed him. Mr. William Cathcart
  closed his eyes, so did not meet the smirk of satisfaction which his partner
  loosened for his benefit.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Uncle. Good morning. Uncle Cathcart."</p>

  <p>"'Mornin'," said Mr. Cathcart, hostile to the last.</p>

  <p>"'Mornin'!" she boomed in imitation. "And I've come feeling awfully nice
  toward you! I called you 'Uncle'!"</p>

  <p>"I heard you," glowered the newly elected relative. "It would be much
  better, Miss Ford, if we proceeded on business lines&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can proceed on tram lines if that pleases you," she sighed, taking
  off her hat and tossing it on to the nearest deed-box. "Oh, Uncle Collings,
  I'm sick..."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cathcart half rose in his alarm.</p>

  <p>"Sick of Australia, sick of the station, sick of the people, sick of
  everything. I'm going home."</p>

  <p>"Home!" gasped Mr. Collings. "But, my dear little Diana. If by 'home' you
  mean England and not&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Heaven," suggested Mr. Cathcart.</p>

  <p>"I mean England, of course I mean England. I am going to stay with my
  cousin, Gordon Selsbury."</p>

  <p>Mr. Collings scratched his nose.</p>

  <p>"An elderly person, of course?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know." She shrugged her indifference.</p>

  <p>"Married, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. If he's nice. All the nice men are married&mdash;present
  company excepted."</p>

  <p>Mr. Collings was a bachelor and could afford to laugh very heartily. Mr.
  Cathcart, on the other hand, was married and was not even amused.</p>

  <p>"You have cabled and written, of course: there is no objection to your
  going to&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. Selsbury's?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever." She was overridingly brisk. "He will be delighted to have
  me."</p>

  <p>"Twenty!" said Mr. Cathcart and shook his head. "An infant in law! I
  really think we must know more about Mr. Selsbury and his condition
  before&mdash;eh, Collings?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Collings looked appealingly at the girl; she had never seemed more or
  looked less orphaned than at that moment.</p>

  <p>"It would be wise, perhaps&mdash;?" he no more than suggested.</p>

  <p>When Diana smiled her eyes wrinkled up and you saw both rows of her small
  white teeth.</p>

  <p>"I have taken my cabin: a lovely one. With a bathroom and sitting-room.
  The walls are panelled in blue brocade silk and there is a cute little brass
  bedstead in the middle&mdash;so that you can fall out either side."</p>

  <p>Mr. William Cathcart felt it was the moment to bring down his foot.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I cannot consent to your going," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Up went her chin.</p>

  <p>"Yes, why?" demanded Mr. Collings. He was anxious to know.</p>

  <p>"Because," said Mr. Cathcart, "because, my dear young lady, you are an
  infant in the eyes of the wise old law of this country; because Mr. Collings
  and I stand <i>in loco parentis</i> to you. Now I am old enough to be your
  father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And grandfather," she said calmly. "But does that matter? There was a lad
  of sixty trying to find opportunities for squeezing my hand all the way down
  in the train from Bendigo. Age means nothing if your heart is young."</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" said Mr. Collings, whose heart was very young.</p>

  <p>"The long and the short of it is that you can't go," said Mr. William
  Cathcart defiantly. "I do not wish to apply for an order of the
  court&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One moment, little friend of the poor," said Diana. She threw several
  priceless law books and a pile of affidavits from a chair and sat down. "A
  few moments ago&mdash;correct me if I am wrong: I seldom am&mdash;you
  produced your hoary Mr. Loco Parentis to crush me to the earth. Meet Colonel
  Locus Standi!"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" said William, dithered.</p>

  <p>"My knowledge of legal formula is slight," said Diana gravely. "I have
  lived a pure and a sheltered life amidst the rolling grass lands of
  Kara-Kara, but ignorant orphan though I am..."</p>

  <p>Mr. Collings sighed.</p>

  <p>"... I understand that before a lawyer applies to the courts he must have
  a client. For no lawyer, except perhaps a lawyer who has been crossed in love
  and is not quite sane, goes to law without a client."</p>

  <p>Mr. William Cathcart shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You must make your own bed," he said.</p>

  <p>"The court can't even make me do that," she replied.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cathcart saw her walking across to him and took up his pen
  hastily.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Cathcart," she said in a low voice, "I did so hope and pray that we
  should part friends! Every night when I kneel by my bed and say 'Please, God,
  give Uncle Cathcart a sense of humour and make him a nice man.' I have
  expected the miracle to happen."</p>

  <p>Uncle Cathcart wriggled.</p>

  <p>"Have your own way," he said loudly. "I can't put an old head on young
  shoulders. Those who live longest will see most."</p>

  <p>"The proof of the pudding is in the eating," she added gently. "You forgot
  that one."</p>

  <p>At luncheon, Mr. Collings tapped the ash of his cigar into the coffee
  saucer.</p>

  <p>"What is this fellow like&mdash;this Selsbury?"</p>

  <p>"He's wonderful!" she said dreamily. "He rowed six in the University
  eight&mdash;I'm simply crazy about him."</p>

  <p>The startled Mr. Collings gazed at her in fascinated horror.</p>

  <p>"Is he crazy about you?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>Diana smiled. She was adjusting her nose with the aid of a mirror
  concealed in the flap of her handbag.</p>

  <p>"He will be," she said softly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch02"
     name="ch02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Neither by nature crazy, nor by inclination eccentric, Mr.
Gordon Selsbury
  had at moments serious but comfortable doubts as to whether he was not a
  little abnormal; whether he was not, in fine, one of those rare and gifted
  mortals to whom was given Vision beyond the ordinary. His environment was the
  commonplace City of London; his occupation a shrieking incongruity for a
  spiritual man&mdash;he was an insurance broker. And a prosperous insurance
  broker.</p>

  <p>Sometimes he sat before the silver fire grate of his sitting-room, amazed
  at the contradictory evidence of his own genius. Here (said he, thinking
  impartially) was a man with a Conscious Soul, beside whom other men were
  clods, vegetables, animals of the field, slaves to their material demands.
  Lifted above the world and its peculiarly grimy interests, he was a man whose
  spiritual head rose above fog and was one with the snow-capped mountains and
  the blue skies. And yet&mdash;here was the truly astonishing thing&mdash;he
  could grapple most practically with these materialists and could tear from
  the clenched and frenzied paws large quantities of soiled and greasy
  money....</p>

  <p>"No, Trenter, I shall be out to-morrow afternoon. Will you please tell Mr.
  Robert that I will see him at my office. Thank you, Trenter."</p>

  <p>Trenter inclined his head respectfully and went back to the telephone.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, Mr. Selsbury will not be at home to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Bobbie Selsbury was annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell him that he promised to play in a foursome with me, tell
  him &mdash;ask him to come to the telephone."</p>

  <p>Gordon got up from his tapestried armchair with an expressionless face.
  Before the servants he revealed nothing in the least degree emotive.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I know!" wearily. "But I had a prior engagement. You must get
  somebody else. Old Mendlesohn ... what's the matter with him? Rubbish, my
  dear fellow. ... At any rate, you must get somebody&mdash;I'm tremendously
  busy to-morrow. ... I don't feel like discussing my business on the
  telephone."</p>

  <p>He paced his dignified way to his den. Gordon Selsbury once rowed six in
  the Varsity boat&mdash;there were crossed oars above his fireplace, though he
  thought the display in bad taste. He had once been a fresher whose chief joy
  in life had been to steal policemen's helmets and ride a bicycle down
  forbidden pathways, and to sprint from proctors. It seemed difficult to
  believe. He was tall and good-looking in the Apollo Belvedere manner. Fair,
  with a forehead which was large and thoughtful, he baffled instant analysis
  by carrying through life two inches of sidewhisker on either cheek. Men
  seeing him first thought he wrote music or played a 'cello. Women on
  introduction guessed him as a dancer of amazing agility, or possibly a film
  artist.</p>

  <p>"Trenter . . ."</p>

  <p>Trenter waited, his head attentively thrust forward, a simulation of
  intense interest on his sharp features. He continued to wait, even as Gordon
  continued to frown at the fireplace.</p>

  <p>"Trenter . . ."</p>

  <p>..."Yes, sir?"</p>

  <p>Slowly Mr. Selsbury turned his head until his eyes met Trenter's. "I saw
  you kissing the parlourmaid this morning. You are a married man, I
  believe?"</p>

  <p>Trenter blinked apprehensively. He was indeed married.</p>

  <p>"I do not wish that sort of thing to happen again," said Gordon, mildly
  scandalised. "You are a married man with responsibilities which cannot be
  ignored or set on one side. Eleanor, as I understand her name to be, is a
  young girl, possibly inflammable, certainly impressionable. To cloud a young
  girl's life by awakening in her heart a passion which you cannot return is
  most reprehensible. Even I have been rocked by the current which the stone
  you cast has set into motion. My shaving water was late this morning. This
  must not occur again."</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Trenter.</p>

  <p>News comes instantly to the servants' hall in any event. Now, telepathy
  lagged behind Trenter's spoken word.</p>

  <p>Eleanor, tall, svelte, pallid of face, black eyebrows and eyes that
  flashed, interrupted the operation of a lip-stick to listen. She was
  tremulously indignant.</p>

  <p>"Because he's a St. Andrew, does he think that we haven't any human
  feelings? The poor cold-blooded fish! I'll let him know that I won't be
  talked about and my name took away&mdash;taken away, I mean&mdash;by a
  prying, sneaking, rubber-soled spy. He is too!"</p>

  <p>"Who's this St. Andrew?" Trenter was suspicious of all saints, being by
  marriage a Primitive Baptist.</p>

  <p>"He's the man that women tempted and he wouldn't," said Eleanor, prepared
  to drop the illustration. But Trenter was of another mind.</p>

  <p>"Who's been tempting him?" he asked, darkling eyed.</p>

  <p>"Nobody: not if it's me you mean. I'd like to see him put his arm round my
  waist! He'd never forget it!"</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't forget himself anyway," said Trenter, relieved.</p>

  <p>She tossed her head sceptically.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know!" she said, and nodded to a warm, large woman in the
  gingham and apron of her profession. "Ask cook!"</p>

  <p>Trenter was dazed.</p>

  <p>"Good God!&mdash;not you, cook?" he asked in a whisper.</p>

  <p>Happily Mrs. Magglesark was not a quick thinker.</p>

  <p>"Yes; I saw him too," she said, and Eleanor, in terror that the telling of
  the story should go elsewhere, trod on the opening of the cook's
  narrative.</p>

  <p>"Me and cook&mdash;that is to say cook and I&mdash;were on top of a 'bus
  last Sunday&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In Knightsbridge." Thus the cook claimed her equal share of the
  copyright.</p>

  <p>"We were laughing and talking when cook said 'Look, Nelly&mdash;there's
  the boss.'"</p>

  <p>"I said 'If that isn't his nibs!'" amended Mrs. Magglesark.</p>

  <p>"And there he was!" said Eleanor. "With a girl, very tall and dressed in
  black, and he was holding her hand!"</p>

  <p>"In the street?"&mdash;incredulously.</p>

  <p>"In the car: from the top of a 'bus you can look down into cars, if
  they're open. Many a sight I've seen!"</p>

  <p>"Was she pretty?" asked Trenter, man-like.</p>

  <p>Eleanor's lips pursed.</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose some people would call her pretty. Did you think she was
  pretty, cook?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Magglesark, having reached the age when she regarded all young people
  as passable, thought she was pretty.</p>

  <p>"Holding her hand!" Trenter was very thoughtful. "It wasn't Mrs. van
  Oynne?"</p>

  <p>"Who is she?"</p>

  <p>"She's been here twice to tea. An American lady, rather well-dressed.
  Heloise! That's her name. And a good-looker. She usually wears black and
  paradise feathers."</p>

  <p>"She wore paradise feathers!" said cook and Eleanor together.</p>

  <p>Trenter nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's her," he said, "but there's nothing in it. She's a highbrow. Reads
  books and all that. Last time she was here, she and him discussed the Ego
  Soul. The little bits I heard I couldn't make head or tail of."</p>

  <p>Eleanor was impressed.</p>

  <p>"Funny for him to be discussing eggs," she said.</p>

  <p>It was not funny for Gordon Selsbury to discuss anything. With Heloise van
  Oynne there seemed to be no subject, from kidney beans to metaphysics, that
  he could not examine profitably. It is true that he did most of the talking,
  but her rapt gaze rectified deficiencies of speech.</p>

  <p>Gordon sat with her that afternoon in the tearoom of the Coburg Hotel, and
  they were comparatively alone.</p>

  <p>"There is something I have wanted to say to you ever since I met you,
  Heloise," he said softly. "A month! It almost seems incredible! If our
  theories are substantial it is incredible. We met before in the Temple of
  Atlantis, where the bearded priests chanted the day through. And you were a
  great lady and I was a humble gladiator. That the gladiatorial games and even
  the factions of the circus have a more remote antiquity than Rome, I am
  certain. Who knows but that the last remnants of dying Atlantis were not the
  first peoples of Etruscan civilisation....?"</p>

  <p>Her fine eyes agreed with that theory. They said as plainly as though the
  words were spoken: "How brilliant of you to associate Etruria with the
  mythical civilisation of Atlantis!"</p>

  <p>On the other hand, her eyes did not say many things that she thought.</p>

  <p>"What is so fine about friendship," Gordon was going on, "is that we have
  lifted common interest above the sordid range of philanderism."</p>

  <p>"How's that?"</p>

  <p>Her head was bent forward eagerly, enquiringly. Trenter had the same
  trick, only he looked pained.</p>

  <p>"I mean"&mdash;Gordon Selsbury flicked a crumb of cake daintily from his
  knee&mdash;"we have never tarnished the bright surface of our friendship with
  that weakness which is so glibly styled 'love.'"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" Heloise van Oynne sat back in her basket chair. "That's so," she
  said, and if there was a sense of immense satisfaction in her tone, even one
  attuned to her spiritual wavelength would not have observed the
  circumstance.</p>

  <p>"The perfect sympathy, the perfect understanding, the dovetailing of mind
  into mind, the oneness of a mutual soul&mdash;these transcend all sentient
  impressions, whatever be the label they bear."</p>

  <p>She smiled slowly and with infinite sweetness and comradeship. Heloise
  invariably smiled at Gordon that way when she wasn't quite sure what he was
  talking about. Though, as to souls&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The soul is certainly the finest thing we have around," she said, in deep
  thought. "That's where we've got most people skinned&mdash;I should say, at a
  disadvantage, you and I, Gordon. One doesn't like to bare one's heart; one
  shrinks instinctively even from self-revelation."</p>

  <p>She sighed as one who had got through an exercise of considerable
  difficulty. Then, observing by certain signs that he had only, so to speak,
  removed the lid of his introspections and that the real contents of his mind
  would shortly spill, to be gathered up and replaced by her none too sure
  hands, she interjected hastily:</p>

  <p>"You were telling me, Gordon, about a cousin of yours in
  Australia&mdash;she must certainly be interesting, and I'm just mad to hear
  about your relations. I like you, Gordon&mdash;a lot. There's nothing about
  you that doesn't fascinate me."</p>

  <p>She laid a gloved hand on his knee. No other woman could lay a hand,
  gloved or ungloved, on Gordon Selsbury's knee without his calling for the
  police. But Heloise... he laid his hand gently on hers.</p>

  <p>"Diana? Well, really, I know nothing about her except that she had that
  tremendous affair with a fellow called Dempsi. I told you that. She's very
  well off, I believe. I've taken a little notice of her&mdash;sent her a few
  books and a word or two of advice. I often think that a man's advice is ever
  so much more acceptable to a young girl than a woman's. When were we talking
  about her? Oh, of course, I remember! It was when we had that tremendous talk
  on the growth of the Ego...."</p>

  <p>"Is she fair or dark?" Heloise nimbly blocked the road to metaphysics.</p>

  <p>"I really don't know. I had a letter from my aunt&mdash;her aunt
  also&mdash;just before the poor creature died. She said that Diana had
  forgotten Dempsi and wondered where she could get his photograph&mdash;the
  man is dead. Has it ever occurred to you, Heloise, how absurd are such terms
  as life and de&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Diana!" mused Heloise, aloud. "Poor little Australian girl. I should like
  to meet her, Gordon."</p>

  <p>Gordon shook his head, smiling gently.</p>

  <p>"I cannot imagine anything less likely," he said, "than your meeting
  her."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch03"
     name="ch03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Cheynel Gardens is one of those very select thoroughfares
that no cab-
  driver has ever found without the assistance of a local guide. Taximen have
  "heard of it," dimly remember having dropped a fare there at some time or
  other; but where it is, only the police and the postmen know. Often people
  who live in Cheynel Gardens have only the haziest idea whether they are in
  Mayfair or Marylebone.</p>

  <p>Gordon occupied a corner house that had a garden, probably the garden
  after which the thoroughfare was named, for there was no other. If a garden
  can be so called that consists of a twelve by ten paved courtyard occupied by
  two large bushes in tubs.</p>

  <p>It was the last house on the left as you turned in from Brook Street, a
  handsome, sober pile of red brick and yellow sandstone, with a big study to
  which stained-glass windows gave the appearance of a well-furnished
  chapel.</p>

  <p>His study was indeed a holy place, for none entered without invitation. It
  had two doors, one of thick oak, one of deadening baize, so that no sound
  might disturb Gordon's close and careful scrutiny of The Economist, which,
  with the Insurance Review, formed his light reading. By day he perused The
  Times, by night he read heavy studies in sociology, or, if he were tired,
  <i>Zur Genealogie der Moral</i>&mdash;Nietzsche being one of his favourite
  authors.</p>

  <p>He descended from the cab that brought him home, gave the driver a ten per
  cent. tip worked out to the nearest penny, and erring on his own side, and
  walked slowly up the steps. The door opened instantly. It was part of the
  daily ritual. Trenter took his hat, his walking-stick and his gloves, and
  Gordon said:</p>

  <p>"No letters?"</p>

  <p>If Trenter had said no, the ritual would have been interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>No need to say more. Gordon was staring at four immense trunks that almost
  completely covered the floor space of the hall. Three of them were
  conspicuously labelled "Not wanted on voyage." The fourth had a big red
  "Cabin" pasted on its side.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;on&mdash;earth&mdash;are&mdash;these?" asked Gordon
  breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"The young lady arrived this afternoon, sir." Trenter was all a-
  twitter.</p>

  <p>"The young lady arrived&mdash;which young lady, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Ford, sir."</p>

  <p>Gordon's forehead wrinkled. He had heard the name in some connection.
  Ford... Ford? It was familiar.</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;Miss Diana Ford from Australia."</p>

  <p>The cousin! Mr. Selsbury inclined his head graciously. The instincts of
  hospitality were not entirely atrophied, and the Selsburys were a race of
  courtly men.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell Miss Ford I am returned and will be glad to see her in The
  Study?"</p>

  <p>Trenter's face twitched.</p>

  <p>"She's in The Study, sir," he almost pleaded. "I told her that nobody ever
  went when you were away and that I kept it locked."</p>

  <p>Gordon was taken aback. It is disconcerting to a host to find his
  hospitality anticipated and taken as a right.</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" he said, and smiled. "Miss Ford couldn't be expected to
  understand our ways, Trenter. I will see her."</p>

  <p>He knocked at the door and a voice bade him enter.</p>

  <p>"I am delighted to meet you, Cousin Diana," he said, and looked round to
  discover how she might be met.</p>

  <p>Then from his favourite chair a white hand appeared.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Gordon. . . . I'm sure it's Gordon."</p>

  <p>She jumped up and round to face him. She had taken off her shoes for
  greater comfort, and in her silk-stockinged feet looked very small. He
  thought she was pretty, just as he would have thought that a kitten was
  pretty. How very amusing.</p>

  <p>"Well, young lady," he said with paternal good-humour, "so here you are! I
  never expected to see you. Have you had a good voyage???"</p>

  <p>"Are you married?" She asked the question rather tensely.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not married. I'm a confirmed old bachelor."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" She sighed happily. "I was awfully scared of that complication ? you
  haven't kissed me."</p>

  <p>Gordon was not aware that he had not kissed her, any more than he was
  aware that he had not hit her on the head with the book he was carrying. The
  Selsburys were a courtly race. He stooped and struck her gently with his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, my dear&mdash;you will have tea, of course? I am truly sorry
  that I kept you waiting. Where are you staying?"</p>

  <p>She flashed one look at him.</p>

  <p>"Here," she said.</p>

  <p>For a second he could not comprehend.</p>

  <p>"I mean, what hotel&mdash;where are you&mdash;er&mdash;sleeping to-
  night?"</p>

  <p>"Here," said Diana.</p>

  <p>In moments of crisis Gordon never lost his head. He once stood on the deck
  of a sinking cross-Channel steamer discussing the atomic theory with a
  Cambridge don. He had twice heard burglars in the house, and had often been
  called upon without notice at public meetings to propose the health of the
  chairman.</p>

  <p>"You mean that you are coming to stay with me&mdash;for a little while? I
  would be delighted, but unfortunately this is a bachelor establishment. There
  are no women in the house except the domestic staff."</p>

  <p>He spoke kindly; his argument was logical, his attitude correct in every
  detail.</p>

  <p>"You want a woman about the house; it was very nearly time I came," she
  said, as unflurried as Gordon himself.</p>

  <p>He stifled his sigh. The position was embarrassing&mdash;other men would
  have been thrown off their feet and either lost their tempers or behaved in
  some way hurtfully.</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted to have you here&mdash;for a few days," he smiled.
  "So run along and telephone to your chaperone and ask her to bring her trunks
  here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Diana pulled on her shoes, unconcerned.</p>

  <p>"I've been admiring your oars," she said. "You rowed six, didn't
  you&mdash;and won! How splendid!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes&mdash;er&mdash;yes." Gordon was not proud of his bygone
  athleticism. "Or shall I telephone?"</p>

  <p>"To whom?" innocently.</p>

  <p>"To your chaperone... the lady with whom you are travelling..."</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly."</p>

  <p>He stiffened; went limp again: turned a shade paler.</p>

  <p>"I travelled alone&mdash;as much alone as one can be with a hundred and
  fifty saloon passengers who played deck games and enjoyed them. An
  intellectual woman can have no possible community of interest with people who
  enthuse over bucket quoits."</p>

  <p>A chair was within reach of his hand and he sat down. Men like Gordon
  Selsbury seldom lose grip of a situation, however awkward it may be. The
  sheer weight of their wisdom and their personality has a tendency to roll
  flat obstacles of the most tremendous nature.</p>

  <p>"Now I'm going to be a father and an uncle and a wise old cousin to you,"
  he said, good nature rigidly and obstinately imprinted in his smile. "You're
  a young girl and somebody has got to tell you that you cannot stay
  alone&mdash;er&mdash;as the guest of a bachelor."</p>

  <p>She stood, her hands behind her, not the ghost of amusement in her face,
  unmoved and immovable.</p>

  <p>"And I've got to tell you, Gordon Selsbury, that I not only can, but I'm
  going to stay here! I am not responsible for your being a bachelor. You ought
  to be married. It is unnatural to live in a big house like this by yourself.
  I have come to stay and, possibly, keep house for you. You must let me have a
  list of the dishes you like for breakfast. I like grapefruit and hominy with
  a small crisp slice of bacon. At the same time, Gordon, I am not averse to
  devilled kidneys a la chef&mdash;do you like waffles? I'm crazy about them!
  We had a Japanese cook who made them to perfection. Another wonderful
  breakfast dish is tomatoes chiffre..."</p>

  <p>"Diana," he said gravely, "you are distressing me. Of course you can't
  possibly stay here! My dear child, I have to consider your good name; in
  after years you will realise what a dreadful thing you have proposed. Now, my
  dear, I'm going to 'phone Laridge's Hotel and ask them to reserve a nice room
  for you."</p>

  <p>He half rose; her hands dropped to his shoulders and she pushed him down.
  It was surprising how strong she was.</p>

  <p>"Let us have no scandal," said Diana firmly. "There is only one way to get
  me out of this house and that is for you to send for a policeman. And a
  single policeman could do very little. I have an automatic in my dressing-
  bag... I shall not hesitate to shoot."</p>

  <p>He gazed at her in horror. She returned the gaze without reproach, without
  doubt. She had the Will to Stay. He recognised a variation of the Nietzsche
  principle.</p>

  <p>"There is only one thing left for me to do, Diana," he said. His gravity
  was so profound that he intoned his speech; it became a Gregorian chant in
  the minor key. "I must go out from my house and leave you here. I myself must
  take a room in a near hotel."</p>

  <p>"You'll do nothing of the kind," she said. "If you do I shall put
  advertisements in all the papers:</p>

  <p>"Missing from his home since Friday, Mr. Gordon Selsbury. Tall, fair,
  fresh complexion, rather good-looking."</p>

  <p>Gordon licked dry lips. Life was drab and sordid, but nothing in life was
  quite so vulgar and hateful as the popular press. The only time in his life
  that he had ever experienced a nightmare, the vision had taken a particularly
  hideous shape. He dreamt that he had been locked up for smothering a chorus
  girl, and was ordered by the judge to write his impressions of the murder in
  a Sunday newspaper.</p>

  <p>"You will perhaps think better of this in a few days." he said huskily. "I
  feel sure that, when you realise what you are doing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She sat down at his beautifully tidy writing-table, took up a pen, and
  snatched from his stationery rack a sheet of notepaper.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me what you like for breakfast," she said. "Smoked haddock...
  salmon steak... fish is good for the brain. Do you mind if I call you
  Gord?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch04"
     name="ch04">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">One day Diana came back from a conscientious tour of the
stores and found
  a thin and middle-aged lady sitting in the drawing-room. She greeted Diana
  with a deferential smile. She was such a middle-aged lady as might have
  stepped from the pages of a late Victorian novel, and Diana regarded her
  steadily, for she wore no hat, had the skimpy beginnings of a purple wool
  jumper on her knees, and in her hands two knitting needles that seemed to be
  operating of heir own volition all the time she talked.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon! You're Miss Ford, aren't you, my dear? I'm Miss Staffle,
  and I do hope we are going to be good friends!"</p>

  <p>"I hope so," said Diana. "We'll be better friends when I understand. Are
  you a guest of ours?"</p>

  <p>Click-flash-flicker went the needles. Diana looked in awe. She was the
  only woman in the world who had never knitted a jumper.</p>

  <p>"Well... yes. Mr. Selsbury thought you would be rather lonely. It doesn't
  do for us girls to be too much alone. We brood."</p>

  <p>"I'm brooding at this minute." Diana was very incisive in business hours.
  "Do I understand that you have been engaged as a chaperone?"</p>

  <p>"Companion," murmured Miss Staffle.</p>

  <p>"That makes it easier," Diana opened her pocket-book. "Your salary
  is?"</p>

  <p>Miss Staffle murmured the amount.</p>

  <p>"Here is two months' pay," said Diana. "I have decided not to engage a
  companion."</p>

  <p>She rang the bell; the needles became stationary.</p>

  <p>"Eleanor," to the svelte parlourmaid, "Miss Staffle is leaving before tea.
  Will you see that her boxes are brought down, and tell Trenter to have a nice
  clean taxi waiting?"</p>

  <p>"But, my dear"&mdash;Miss Staffle's voice was slightly
  acidulated&mdash;"Mr. Selsbury engaged me, and I am afraid..."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Selsbury doesn't want a companion," said Diana. "Now, my angel, are
  you going to give me trouble, or are you going to be a sweet little cherub
  and fly?"</p>

  <p>Gordon came home prepared to face a storm and ready to present a rocky
  face either to the waves of her wrath or the drizzle of her tears. He found
  her trying a new record on a brand-new gramophone, her feet moving lightly to
  the magical rhythm of "I Ain't Nobody's Darling." He resented the gramophone,
  but had other matters of greater moment to discuss. There was no sign of the
  excellent Miss Staffle. "Anybody been?" he asked carelessly. She stopped
  whistling.</p>

  <p>"Nobody except an elderly lady who made the curious mistake of thinking I
  wanted a companion."</p>

  <p>"Where is she?" asked Gordon, his heart sinking.</p>

  <p>"I didn't trouble to take her address," said Diana. "Why&mdash;did you
  want her?"</p>

  <p>"You sent her away?"</p>

  <p>Diana nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes; her industry was appalling." And then, as a thought occurred: "Was
  the jumper for you?"</p>

  <p>"You sent a&mdash;er&mdash;um&mdash;person I engaged away from my house?"
  sternly. "Really, Diana! This is a little too much! Let's have this out, my
  dear."</p>

  <p>Diana changed the record.</p>

  <p>"Tea will be served in ten minutes," she said. "And Gordon, my dear, your
  shoes are muddy. Run up and change them."</p>

  <p>Revolt flew red signals on his cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I will do nothing of the kind!" he said sharply. "I will not be ordered
  about in my own house. Diana, you have gone too far! This intolerable
  situation must end here and now."</p>

  <p>He brought his hand slapping down on the back of the easy chair. He was
  determined.</p>

  <p>"Either you or I leave this house to-night," he said. "I have had enough!
  Already the servants are talking. I saw a particularly sinister smile on
  Trenter's face when you came down to breakfast in your negligee this morning.
  I have a position, a reputation, a name in the City of London&mdash;I must
  guard my interests against the thoughtless, selfish folly of reckless
  adolescence!"</p>

  <p>"What a name to call a lady!" she said reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"I will not temporise; I will not allow a very serious situation to be
  turned into a jest. Either you leave Cheynel Gardens or I."</p>

  <p>She thought a moment, then walked out of the room. Gordon heard her at the
  telephone in the hall and smiled. A little firmness was all that was
  required.</p>

  <p>"Is that the <i>Morning Telegram</i>? This is Miss Diana Ford speaking.
  Will you send a reporter to 61 Cheynel Gardens&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In two seconds he was in the hall and had covered the transmitter with a
  frantic hand.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" he asked frenziedly.</p>

  <p>She shrugged a shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Life without you is insupportable, Gordon," she said brokenly. "You are
  the only relation I have in the world, and if you turn me out what is there
  left but the river?"</p>

  <p>"You're mad," he wailed.</p>

  <p>"The coroner will take that charitable view, I hope&mdash;don't interrupt
  me, Gordon. They want to speak to me."</p>

  <p>By sheer force he lifted her away from the instrument and took the
  receiver in his own hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't bother to send anybody... she is quite well... alive. I mean,
  there's no suicide..."</p>

  <p>Out of breath, he strode back to The Study.</p>

  <p>"Your conduct is abominable! You are shameless! I can well understand why
  your wretched Dempsi ran away, preferring to die in the bush than be any
  longer associated with such an infernal little termagant!"</p>

  <p>The Selsburys were a courtly people, but there was a limit to their
  patience. He was savage, cruel, and knew he was behaving unpardonably before
  the words were out of his mouth.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he muttered.</p>

  <p>Her face was set, a mask that showed nothing of her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"I'm extremely sorry. I shouldn't have said that&mdash;please forgive
  me."</p>

  <p>Still she did not speak. Her eyes were tragic in their steadfast,
  unwinking gaze. He stole quietly from the room, and then she spoke her
  thoughts aloud.</p>

  <p>"How absurd not to have the telephone connected with the study! I'll write
  to the Post Office this very night."</p>

  <p>A very silent dinner. Gordon was going out and was resplendent in his
  raiment.</p>

  <p>"I am taking a friend to a theatre to-night," he said.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen a show for years," she sighed.</p>

  <p>"This would not interest you. It is a Russian play dealing with social
  unrest."</p>

  <p>She sighed again.</p>

  <p>"I love Russian plays. All the characters die so nicely and you know where
  you are. In a musical comedy you can never be sure who anybody is."</p>

  <p>Gordon shuddered.</p>

  <p>"This is not a play for a young girl," he said gently.</p>

  <p>She was unconvinced.</p>

  <p>"If you very much wanted me to come, I could dress in five minutes," she
  suggested. "I hardly know what I shall do with myself to-night."</p>

  <p>"Think out to-morrow's breakfast," he said bitterly.</p>

  <p>Alone, she gave her mind alternately to serious thought and the new
  gramophone. She did think of Dempsi sometimes, and a little uneasily. Not
  that she had loved that strange progeny of Michael Dempsi and Marie
  Stezzaganni. Dempsi came into her life as an earthquake intrudes upon the
  domesticity of a Californian farmer. He shifted the angle of things and had
  been a great disturbance. She never really remembered Dempsi, except that he
  was very slight and very wiry and very voluble. She remembered that he had
  thrown himself at her feet, had threatened to shoot her, had told her he
  adored her and was ready to forsake his career in the church. Finally, on a
  hot February morning (she remembered that the roses were thick in the big
  garden) he had flung his worldly possessions at her feet, taken an intense
  and tearful farewell, and had dashed madly into the bush, never to
  return.</p>

  <p>In point of fact, the nearest bush country was a hundred miles away, but
  he had said that he was going to the bush "to end a life already prolonged
  beyond the limits of human endurance and find forgetfulness in oblivion," and
  he had probably kept his word. So far as the "bush" part of the contract was
  concerned. She did not mourn him. If she wondered at all, it was as to the
  circumstances in which he would reappear and claim some eight thousand pounds
  neatly tied in one package that it might be the more effectively and
  dramatically thrown at her feet, and which in truth missed her feet by a wide
  margin and struck the station cat, who, being newly maternal, flew at Dempsi
  and accelerated his wild flight.</p>

  <p>She did not tell her aunt about the eight thousand; Mrs. Tetherby being,
  as she had been described, "inert," had an objection to fuss of any kind.
  More than this, she possessed one curious weakness&mdash;a horror of debt.
  The knowledge that she was under monetary obligation kept her awake. An
  overlooked garage account once reduced her to a state of nervous prostration.
  Other people's money she would not touch, and, on an occasion when, having
  paid her shearers, she was requested by the men to keep the money from
  Saturday to Monday, she paced the verandah for two nights, a shot gun under
  her arm.</p>

  <p>It was largely due to this weakness that all money affairs were in Diana's
  hands from the age of fifteen. Diana put the eight thousand to her own
  account and spent an interesting three months planning and drawing expensive
  memorials to the departed Dempsi. In the back pages of a dictionary, under
  the heading "Foreign words and phrases," she discovered an appropriate
  epitaph.</p>

  <p class="cp"><i>Satis eloquentiae, sapientiae parum</i><br>
  He had great eloquence but little sense.</p>

  <p>As the years passed, and her uneasiness increased, she made half-hearted
  attempts to discover his relatives, though she knew that he was without so
  much as a known cousin. And then, gradually, Dempsi had receded into the
  background. She was beloved of a romantic squatter. This affair ended
  abruptly when the romantic squatter's unromantic wife arrived in a
  high-powered car and bore him off to serve the remainder of his sentence.</p>

  <p>Diana gave exactly five minutes of her thoughts to Dempsi. For the
  remainder of the evening she practised a new waltz step which had
  surprisingly found its way into jazz.</p>

  <p>"What I can't understand," said Trenter, "is why the boss allows this sort
  of thing to go on. It's downright improper, a young woman living in a
  bachelor's house. It reminds me of a case old Superbus once told me
  about&mdash;he's a court bailiff and naturally he sees the seamy side of
  life&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't have a bailiff for a friend if you paid me a million," said
  Eleanor, who had been brought up in an atmosphere of financial embarrassment.
  "I'd sooner have a burglar. Don't you worry about our young Di, Arthur. She's
  all there! Personally speaking, I'm glad she's arrived. What about
  me&mdash;haven't I any morals? Hasn't me and cook&mdash;cook and I, that is
  to say&mdash;lived in the same house with a bachelor for a year?"</p>

  <p>"You're different," said Trenter.</p>

  <p>"Guess again," said Eleanor.</p>

  <p>"The house hasn't been what it was." A touch of sadness in Trenter's voice
  had its origin in obscure sources.</p>

  <p>Methodical as Gordon was, he never counted his cigars. Diana, on the other
  hand, had an eye for quantity. It was she who asked delicately whether he
  thought there were mice in the house, and, if so, did he think that they
  preferred Coronas to cheese.</p>

  <p>"There's a big change coming&mdash;a terrific change. I feel it in my
  bones," he said. "And I know! I've always had second sight even as a
  boy."</p>

  <p>"You should wear glasses," said Eleanor.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch05"
     name="ch05">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">On an afternoon in late summer Heloise van Oynne looked
across the
  darkening river, seemed for a moment absorbed in the gay lighting of one of
  the moored house-boats, and then:</p>

  <p>"Tell me some more about Diana, please. She must be fascinating!" she
  pleaded.</p>

  <p>Her companion shifted a little uncomfortably. He had already said more
  about Diana than he wished or intended saying.</p>

  <p>"Well... you know all about Diana, I hope you will meet her... some
  day."</p>

  <p>There was just that little pause before the last word that meant so much
  to a woman with an acute sense of tone, and Heloise was supersensitive
  because it was her business to be. Today she seemed unusually ethereal.</p>

  <p>She was pretty, slim (Diana would have called her "skinny"),
  <i>spirituelle</i>. In the deep, dark eyes was mystery... elusiveness;
  something that occasionally made his flesh creep pleasantly.</p>

  <p>Gordon Selsbury was not in love. He was not the easily loving kind. It
  pleased him to know that he had a mystery of his own&mdash;he had once been
  described as "sphinx-like."</p>

  <p>If Diana had been older and were not his cousin, and had not in her
  masterful way installed herself in his house, defiant of the conventions, and
  were not so infernally sarcastic and self-sufficient&mdash;well, he might
  feel nicer toward her.</p>

  <p>Talking of Diana....</p>

  <p>He looked at the watch on his wrist. He had told her he would be in for
  dinner. Heloise saw the movement and smiled inwardly.</p>

  <p>"Was it serious, that affair of hers?" she asked gently.</p>

  <p>Gordon coughed. Heloise never met him but she talked of Diana's affair. It
  was a curious piece of femininity that he did not expect to find in a woman.
  Not his kind of woman.</p>

  <p>He was relieved of the necessity for answering.</p>

  <p>"Who is that man, Gordon?"</p>

  <p>The skiff had passed twice under the hotel terrace where they sat at tea
  that afternoon, and twice the big, red-faced man had peered up at the two
  people.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Shouldn't we be going?"</p>

  <p>She made no attempt to rise.</p>

  <p>"When do I see you again, Gordon? Life is so blank and miserable without
  you. Does Diana monopolise you so entirely? People wouldn't understand, would
  they? I don't love you and you do not love me. If you thought I loved you,
  you would never see me again." She laughed quietly. "It is just your soul and
  mind"&mdash;her voice was very low&mdash;"just the clear channel of
  understanding that makes our minds as one. Love doesn't bring that, or
  marriage."</p>

  <p>"It is rather wonderful." He nodded many times.
  "Extraordinary&mdash;people would never understand."</p>

  <p>She thought they wouldn't.</p>

  <p>"I'm just aching for The Day to come," she said, staring across the river.
  "I don't think it ever will come: not The Day of my dreams."</p>

  <p>Gordon Selsbury had this premonition too; had been waiting all afternoon
  to translate his doubt into words.</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking the matter over, Heloise&mdash;that trip to Ostend. Of
  course, it would be lovely seeing one another every day and all day, and
  living, if not under the same roof, at least in the same environment. The
  uninterrupted contact of mind&mdash;that is beautifully appealing. But do you
  think it wise? I am speaking, of course, from your point of view. Scandal
  doesn't touch a man grossly."</p>

  <p>She turned her glorious eyes to his.</p>

  <p>"'They say: what say they? Let them say,'" she quoted contemptuously.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Your name is very precious to me," he said, not without a hint of
  emotion, "very precious, Heloise. I feel that, although the Ostend season is
  past and most of the hotels are closed and visitors have dispersed, as I
  understand they do disperse from fashionable seaside resorts, there is a
  possibility, a bare possibility, that we should see somebody there who knew
  me&mdash;us, I mean&mdash;and who would put the worst possible construction
  upon what&mdash;er&mdash;would be the most innocent intellectual recreation.
  It is extremely dangerous."</p>

  <p>She was laughing hardly as she rose.</p>

  <p>"I see," she said. "You are really conventional underneath, Gordon. It was
  a mad idea&mdash;don't let us talk any more about it. It hurts me a
  little."</p>

  <p>In silence he paid the bill, in silence followed her into his car. He was
  hurt too. Nobody had ever called him conventional. Half way across Richmond
  Park he said:</p>

  <p>"We will go: let us say no more. I will meet you as we arranged."</p>

  <p>The only answer she made was to squeeze his arm until they were flying
  down Roehampton Lane, and then, dreamily:</p>

  <p>"There is something Infinite in friendship like ours, Man. It is all too
  wonderful...."</p>

  <p>Diana was reading a magazine in The Study when Gordon came in. She threw
  down the magazine and jumped up from the chair (she sat at his desk when she
  read, with the exasperating result that the writing surface, which he left
  neat and ordered on his going out, was generally in a state of chaos on his
  coming in).</p>

  <p>"Dinner," she said tersely. "You're late, Gord, devilishly late."</p>

  <p>Mr. Selsbury's expression was pained.</p>

  <p>"I wish you would not call me 'Gord,' Diana," he complained gently. "It
  sounds&mdash;well, blasphemous."</p>

  <p>"But oh, it fits," she said, shaking her head. "You don't know how it
  fits!"</p>

  <p>Gordon shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"At any rate, 'devilish' is not ladylike."</p>

  <p>"Where have you been?" she asked with that disconcerting brusqueness of
  hers.</p>

  <p>"I have been detained&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not at your office," said Diana promptly, as she sat down at the table
  and pointed an accusing finger. "You haven't been back since luncheon."</p>

  <p>Mr. Selsbury cast a resigned look at the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"I have been detained on a purely private business matter," he said
  stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear!" said Diana, unimpressed.</p>

  <p>Nothing really impressed Diana. She had, she boasted, passed the
  impressionable age.</p>

  <p>Gordon had come to admit to himself that she was pretty; in a way she was
  beautiful. She had blue eyes, willow pattern blue, and a skin like satin. He
  admitted that her figure was rather lovely. If she had been older or younger,
  if her hair had not been bobbed&mdash;if she had a little more respect for
  wisdom, an appreciation of thought, a little something of hero-worship!</p>

  <p>He strolled gloomily to the window and stared blankly into the dusk. Diana
  was an insoluble problem.</p>

  <p>Trenter came in at that moment. "Trenter."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir." The butler crossed to his employer.</p>

  <p>"Do you see that man on the other side of the road&mdash;that red-faced
  man?"</p>

  <p>It was the stranger of the skiff. Gordon recognised him at once.</p>

  <p>"I've seen him before to-day... rather a coincidence."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," agreed Trenter. "That's Mr. Julius Superbus."</p>

  <p>Gordon gaped at him.</p>

  <p>"Julius Superbus&mdash;what the devil do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Language!" murmured a voice in the background. How like Diana.</p>

  <p>"What on earth do you mean? That is a Roman name."</p>

  <p>Trenter smirked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Mr. Superbus is a Roman, the last Roman left in England. He
  comes from Caesar Magnus&mdash;it's a little village near Cambridge. I used
  to be in service there, that's how I come to know him."</p>

  <p>Gordon frowned heavily. By what strange chance had he come to see this
  oddly named creature twice in one day&mdash;at Hampton, rowing a boat with
  some labour; in Cheynel Gardens, apparently absorbed in the study of a
  near-by lamp- post?</p>

  <p>"What is he&mdash;by profession?"</p>

  <p>"A detective, sir," said Trenter.</p>

  <p>Gordon went suddenly pale.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch06"
     name="ch06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Sometimes, mostly all the time, Gordon forgot that before
the name of
  Heloise van Oynne was that magical prefix "Mrs." Too nice-minded to discover,
  even by an indirect method, the extent of her indiscretion, Gordon had
  conceived in his mind a marriage between two persons diametrically unsuited
  one to the other. He fashioned Mr. van Oynne in the image of a gross,
  unimaginative business man, without soul, and saw dimly a struggle between
  opposing ideals; sullen fury or blank indifference on the man's part, and, in
  the case of Heloise, a refined suffering and an infinite restlessness in her,
  until there came into her life the other half of her intellectual being.
  Which was Gordon.</p>

  <p>He looked out of the window again.</p>

  <p>Mr. Julius Superbus was deliberately charging a black pipe from a sealskin
  tobacco pouch. He seemed the kind of man who would stoop to the meanest
  methods to gain his ends. And a prurient brute who would think nothing of
  writing reports highly disparaging to a slim, aesthetic girl. A detective! In
  desperation he turned to Diana.</p>

  <p>"Diana, do you mind if I have The Study for a little while? I want to see
  a man."</p>

  <p>She waved a cheery farewell as she disappeared through the door at the far
  end of the room.</p>

  <p>"Bring him in."</p>

  <p>"Bring him in, sir?" Trenter was intrigued.</p>

  <p>Gordon repeated the order.</p>

  <p>"He's not a gentleman, sir," warned Trenter, desiring exculpation in
  advance.</p>

  <p>This was in case Mr. Superbus was even less of a gentleman than he thought
  him to be. Gordon has never any illusions on the subject. He said as much
  tersely, and Trenter went forth in a spirit of joyful anticipation, knowing
  that the nature of this interview would be repeated to him when next he met
  his friend.</p>

  <p>A wait, and then:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Superbus, sir," said Trenter correctly. He bowed the visitor into the
  study, and withdrew.</p>

  <p>There was nothing in the appearance of Mr. Superbus that was suggestive of
  Roman culture at its zenith. He was very short, and waddled rather than
  walked. He was fat so that, if he were standing on two square feet of his own
  property, his waistcoat might have been arrested for trespass on neighbouring
  land. His face was very red and broad; he had a stubbly black moustache,
  which was obviously dyed; on his otherwise bald head, twenty-seven hairs were
  parted, thirteen on one side and fourteen on the other. He had often counted
  them.</p>

  <p>He stood, breathing audibly and twisting his hat in his blue hands.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Mr. Superbus," said Gordon awkwardly. "Trenter was telling me
  that you are&mdash;in fact, you have the distinction of being a Roman?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus bent forward before he sat, as though to assure himself that
  his feet were all present and correct.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," he said, in a rich, deep voice. "I believe I am. Us
  Superbusses"&mdash;he gave the word a pronunciation which suggested that he
  had been named after a public vehicle of unusual size&mdash;"have come down
  for generations. There's only four of us now&mdash;there's me, my brother
  Augustus, who's married to a young woman in Coventry; there's Agrippa, who's
  doing very well with her third husband&mdash;this one doesn't drink, I'm
  happy to say&mdash;and there's Scipius: he's on the stage."</p>

  <p>"Really!" said Gordon, dazzled for the moment.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's on the stage," said Mr. Superbus with great satisfaction, "and
  doing very well. They say he's the best carpenter they've ever had at the
  Gaiety. Yes, we're an ancient family. I've never got the rights of it, but an
  old gentleman who lives at Cambridge told me that, if everybody had his due,
  I ought to be a member of the Roman Royal Family, being the eldest."</p>

  <p>Near Caesar Magnus is the University of Cambridge, and there have been
  soured antiquarians who have suggested that the illustrious family of
  Superbus owed its origin to the freakish whim of certain freshmen whose gowns
  rustled in Petty Cury a hundred years ago. That these same students, in their
  humour, had adopted the family of an indigent carter, one Sooper, and had
  christened the family afresh. Mr. Superbus had heard these rumours and had
  treated them with contempt.</p>

  <p>"How we came to start I don't know," he said, on his favourite topic; "but
  you know what women are when Romans are about!"</p>

  <p>Gordon did not even trouble to guess.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Superbus, you have&mdash;er&mdash;a very-important position.
  You're a detective, I understand?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus nodded soberly.</p>

  <p>"It must be an interesting life, watching people," he suggested, "going
  into court and ly&mdash;testifying to their various misdoings?"</p>

  <p>"I never go into court," said Mr. Superbus. And here, apparently, he had a
  grievance. "My work, so to speak, is commercial. Not that I shan't go into
  court if a certain coop comes off."</p>

  <p>"Coop?" Gordon was puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Coop," repeated Mr. Superbus emphatically.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;coop? Are you looking for people who steal
  chickens?" asked Gordon, at sea.</p>

  <p>"By 'coop' I mean&mdash;well, you know what I mean, sir. Suppose I bring
  off a big bit of business&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, coup!" said Gordon, enlightened. "I see. You have a coup?"</p>

  <p>"I always called it coop myself," said Mr. Superbus graciously, and
  leaving Gordon with the impression that he was being humoured. "Yes, I've got
  a coop up my sleeve." He lowered his voice and stretched himself to as near
  Gordon as his body could reach. "I'm after Double Dan," he whispered
  hoarsely.</p>

  <p>A heavy burden rolled from Gordon's heart. So the "Mrs." had nothing to do
  with the matter at all! Nor the gross husband, who thought more of his dogs
  and his horses than of the flaming intellect of his beautiful wife. (Gordon
  was thorough: the gross husband must have his pets.)</p>

  <p>"I seem to remember the name," he said slowly. "Double Dan? Isn't that the
  man who impersonates people?"</p>

  <p>"You've got it, sir," said Mr. Superbus. "He don't impersonate them, he is
  them! Take Mr. Mendlesohn&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Now Gordon remembered.</p>

  <p>"You'd never think anybody could impersonate him, though, with his white
  whiskers and him not being married, it wasn't so hard. He got away with eight
  thousand pounds, did Dan. Got Mr. Mendlesohn out of the way, walked into his
  private office and sent a new clerk out with a cheque. That's why Mr.
  Mendlesohn's gone into the country. He daren't hold up his head."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see," said Gordon slowly. "You're acting on behalf of?"</p>

  <p>"The Brokers' Association&mdash;he goes after brokers."</p>

  <p>Gordon seldom laughed, but he was laughing softly now.</p>

  <p>"And you have been following me round to protect me, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly that, sir," said Mr. Superbus with professional reserve.
  "What I was trying to do was to get to know you, so that I'd make no mistake
  if Dan tried to 'double' you."</p>

  <p>"Have a cigar?" said Gordon.</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus said he didn't mind if he did; that he would take it home,
  and smoke it in the seclusion of his own house.</p>

  <p>"My good lady likes the smell of a cigar," he said. "It keeps away the
  moths. I've been married now for three and twenty years, and there isn't a
  better woman on the face of the earth than my good lady."</p>

  <p>"A Roman?" asked Gordon.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," replied Mr. Superbus gravely. "Devonshire."</p>

  <p>Diana, coming into the room half an hour later, saw Gordon standing with
  his back to the fireplace, his hands clasped behind him, his head slightly
  bent, a picture of practical thought.</p>

  <p>"Who was that funny little man I saw go out of the house?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He is a man named Superbus," said Gordon, roused from his reverie with a
  start, "who has been making certain enquiries. He's been trying to trace
  somebody who has robbed a man of eight thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Diana, and sat down quickly. The ghost of the late Mr. Dempsi
  was very active at that moment.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch07"
     name="ch07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Diana liked Bobbie Selsbury the moment she saw him. He was
a smaller
  edition of his brother, a brusque, cynical young man, with a passion for
  revue and the more clingy variations of modern dancing. Also he was engaged
  to a girl in Canada, and had no intense interest in any other woman. She
  liked him most because he was entirely without that brand of soul which
  wriggled so frequently under the scalpel of his brother.</p>

  <p>He came to dinner twice, and on the second occasion Gordon thought his
  relative was on sufficiently good terms with his unwanted guest, to discuss
  openly the impropriety of her continued stay.</p>

  <p>"Bobbie is what is known as a man of the world," said Gordon. When Gordon
  introduced the virtues of his friends, he did so in the manner of a chairman
  at a public meeting bringing an unknown speaker to the notice of an
  audience.</p>

  <p>"He has a keener concept of relative social values than either I, who am a
  little old-fashioned, or you, my child, who have led a cloistered life. I
  think we can safely leave the issue in Bobbie's hands. Now, Bobbie, I'm going
  to put the matter to you without prejudice. Is it right that Diana should be
  staying in the same house as I, without a chaperone?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see why she should want a chaperone with a dry old stick like
  you," said Bobbie instantly. "Besides, you're cousins. She has certainly made
  Cheynel Gardens a place worth visiting, which it never was before."</p>

  <p>"But the world&mdash;" protested Gordon.</p>

  <p>"The other day you were telling me how superior you were to the world and
  its opinions," said the traitor Bobbie. "You told me that the views of the
  hoi polloi passed you by without making the least impression. You said that a
  man should rise superior to the test of public approval. You said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What I said," snapped Gordon testily, "had a general application to
  certain schools of philosophical thought. It did not apply, and never will
  apply, to questions of behaviour and propriety."</p>

  <p>"Diana is here, and you're a lucky devil to have somebody to darn your
  socks. Does he pay you anything, Diana?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am living on my little capital," she said plaintively, and Gordon felt
  a brute, but it was not until the next morning that he raised the subject
  again.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've been rather thoughtless, Diana," he said. "Will you
  please buy anything you want and give me a note of any money you
  require?"</p>

  <p>She leant back in her chair, laughing softly.</p>

  <p>"You dear goop!" she said. "Of course I don't want money! I am rolling in
  riches."</p>

  <p>"Then why did you tell Bobbie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I like sympathy," she said calmly. "And nobody gives me sympathy except
  Eleanor. She's rather a pretty girl, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't noticed," said Gordon.</p>

  <p>"I knew you hadn't," she said, "when I discovered that you'd never kissed
  her."</p>

  <p>Gordon's mouth was occupied with bacon at the moment, but he stood up and
  made an unearthly noise of protest.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't ask servants such questions," said Diana primly, "but a woman
  has instincts, and there's always a way of finding these things out. Gordon,
  you are exonerated," she added with a generous gesture.</p>

  <p>"Your philosophy of life is amazing," he said, after he had recovered some
  of his calm. "Whatever made you think I should kiss her?"</p>

  <p>"Because she's pretty," said Diana. "All men want to kiss pretty girls if
  they're normal. Lots of people have wanted to kiss me."</p>

  <p>Gordon raised his eyebrows without looking up. He was not revolted; he was
  simply resigned.</p>

  <p>"You haven't asked me whether I let them," she said after waiting.</p>

  <p>"I'm not interested," said Gordon coldly.</p>

  <p>"Not a teeny weeny bit?"</p>

  <p>Anxiety was in her voice, but he was not deceived. He had learnt by hard
  experience that when Diana was most wistful, she was usually gurgling with
  internal laughter. A terrible girl.</p>

  <p>"I've only had two affairs," she went on, regardless of his distaste.
  "There was Dempsi and there was Dingo."</p>

  <p>"Who was Dingo?" he was trapped into asking.</p>

  <p>"Theophilus Shawn. He was a married man with five children."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" Gordon dropped his knife and fork on the plate helplessly.</p>

  <p>"He never kissed me," she said. "His wife came and took him away just as I
  was getting to like the smell of cloves&mdash;he used to eat cloves. He said
  it made his hair grow. Whenever he ran short of cloves he got into his car
  and drove to the hotel to get some. He'd go a dozen times a day. He was
  staying with Auntie; she met him at a lecture on sunspots, but she didn't
  know anything about his wife until she came for him. She was an awfully nice
  woman, and thanked me for looking after her husband. She said she hadn't seen
  him sober before&mdash;she was awfully interested in him. I think wives
  should get to know their husbands before they're married, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Selsbury sighed.</p>

  <p>"I think you're talking a lot of abject nonsense," he said, "and I wish to
  heaven you'd get to know your husband!"</p>

  <p>She smiled, but did not reply. She felt that he had been shocked enough
  for one day.</p>

  <p>He was making as if to get up from the breakfast table when she remembered
  a question she wanted to ask him.</p>

  <p>"Gordon, that man who came yesterday, the man with the Hebrew
  name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Roman. You mean Superbus?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Whom did he want?" she asked, playing with her serviette ring.</p>

  <p>"He was looking for a robber, a man named"&mdash;he cast up his eyes,
  trying to recall the title&mdash;"Double Dan, a swindler."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" drawled Diana, her eyes on the tablecloth. "Are you going,
  Gordon? What time will you be home?"</p>

  <p>"When my business permits me to return," he said in his stateliest
  fashion. "Do you realise, Diana, that nobody has ever asked me that question
  in my life?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I ask you every day," she said in wonder.</p>

  <p>"I mean, nobody except you. My comings and goings have never been
  questioned, and for the life of me I don't see why they should be questioned
  now."</p>

  <p>"I'm not questioning you, I'm merely asking you," said Diana, aggrieved.
  "I only want to know because of dinner."</p>

  <p>"I may not be home to dinner," said Gordon shortly, and went forth to an
  actuarial orgy, for business had improved at an enormous rate recently, and
  he was engaged in organising a new form of insurance.</p>

  <p>He had at least the will power to put out of his head a problem which
  rippled the smooth current of his thoughts. Only in the luncheon hour did he
  return to grapple with the projected soul tour. He wished that Heloise had
  chosen some other venue than Ostend. Ostend in itself was improper, and
  associated in all respectable minds with licence and luxury. He felt that he
  might have been a little more firm about Diana staying on at Cheynel Gardens
  if he himself had not outraged, or contemplated the outrage of convention....
  Convention was an ugly word, a bourgeois word.... What he really meant was...
  he thought in vain for a synonym. The Ostend idea was a mad idea, and he
  wondered who had thought of it. At the same time, there was no reason why he
  should be recognised if he kept away from the quay, where the incoming
  Continental boats pull in; and, if necessary, he could alter his appearance
  slightly... he went hot and cold at the thought. There was something furtive
  and underhand about the very notion. Diana had made mock of those little
  smears of side-whiskers, and he never went to the barber but that individual
  made some reference to the appendages. He had seriously considered their
  removal. Especially since Heloise had wondered why he wore them. She thought
  they made him look rather older than he was. It would be in the nature of a
  subtle compliment to her if he appeared on The Day clean- shaven. As to the
  other matter, one did not go to Ostend in a morning coat and top hat. He
  might wear his sports suit or&mdash;but he had a tailor with views, and to
  this merchant of habit he appealed on his way home. The tailor listened
  alertly.</p>

  <p>"If you are going abroad, I should advise a couple of tweed suits. Grey
  checks are being worn by everybody&mdash;a, check with a little red in it.
  No, sir, oh dear, no! Lord Furnisham had a suit of that character only last
  month, and he, as you know, is a man of taste and refinement. And one of the
  leading men at the Convocation of Laymen&mdash;a dear friend of the
  Archbishop's."</p>

  <p>Gordon saw the patterns, was panic-stricken by their joviality. And yet...
  Who would recognise Gordon Selsbury in a fashionable grey check with a little
  red in it?</p>

  <p>"Rather noisy, don't you think?" he wavered.</p>

  <p>The tailor smiled tolerantly at a bolt of blue serge.</p>

  <p>"My clients do not think so," he said. He was so great a tailor that he
  had clients.</p>

  <p>"Very well."</p>

  <p>Gordon gave the order. He told himself that he was not committed to the
  trip. But if he did go, he possessed an outfit. That was a comfort.</p>

  <p>Heloise was staying at the Majestic (if it was still open). Gordon would
  arrange for rooms at the Splendid&mdash;with the same contingency. They were
  to meet after breakfast every morning and lunch together at a little cafe on
  Place des Armes. On one day they would go to Bruges together and see the
  pictures. A tour of the Littoral was a possibility. Between whiles there were
  books to be discussed, the lectures of a brand-new exponent of a brand-new
  philosophy to be attended. He held what may be described as an ethical clinic
  at Mariakirk and was the original excuse for the trip. A party of Thinkers
  was projected to sit at the feet of De Waal (that was his name) and learn
  laboriously the difference between right and wrong, right being what had
  hitherto appeared to be wrong, and wrong being proved, by the new school of
  thought and its principal exegete, to be so absurdly right that the wonder
  was that nobody had seen it all along. The party had fallen through. The new
  Master had been discredited by a newer, a German who demonstrated that there
  was neither right nor wrong in any kind of question whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Gordon's dilemma was born of this projected Pilgrimage of Reason, and one
  aspect of the holiday worried him: the possibility of something happening
  which would make it imperative that he should be communicated with.</p>

  <p>In reality this was the strongest argument against the trip. Only by
  taking somebody into his confidence could such an adventure be undertaken.
  Diana was, of course, impossible. Gordon pinched his lip and rehearsed the
  terms in which he would convey to his agent the exact character of his
  journey. His attempt to put into words so remarkable and so unbelievable a
  project left him with a cold sense of dismay. Of all the people he thought
  likely he started with Bobbie; he also ended with Bobbie.</p>

  <p>Robert G. Selsbury had an office on Mark Lane, where, from ten o'clock in
  the morning until four o'clock in the afternoon, he bought and sold tea,
  coffee and sugar to his own considerable profit. Gordon had only been to the
  office once. He thought it was rather stuffy and rather redolent of the two
  principal commodities in which Bobbie dealt. His own office in Queen Victoria
  Street was both rich and chaste and odourless, except for the faint fragrance
  of lavender&mdash;Gordon was strong for germicides, and that mostly employed
  to destroy the ravaging microbe had that suggestion of the lavender fields.
  Bobbie never came to see his brother without the sense that he ought to be
  wearing a boudoir cap and bedroom slippers.</p>

  <p>The principal stockholder of R. G. Selsbury Ltd. was examining a sample of
  china tea when his brother was announced.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gordon?" asked Bobbie incredulously, and when the girl confirmed the
  tidings. "Push him in," he said, and Gordon, who would have resented even the
  gentlest of pushes, entered unaided.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked Bobbie.</p>

  <p>Gordon seated himself very carefully, put down his glossy silk hat on the
  table and slowly stripped his gloves.</p>

  <p>"Robert, I'm rather in a tangle and I want you to help me out."</p>

  <p>"It can't be money&mdash;it must be love. Who is she?"</p>

  <p>"It is neither money nor love," retorted Gordon with some asperity. "It
  is... well, a delicate matter."</p>

  <p>Bobbie whistled, and a whistle can be very offensive.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tell you the facts." Gordon had to struggle with himself; he
  was on the point of inventing an excuse for calling and making a hasty
  retreat.</p>

  <p>"Is it about Diana?"</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't about Diana," snapped the elder. "Diana has nothing whatever
  to do with it. It is like this&mdash;old man..."</p>

  <p>The "old man" sobered Bobbie. It showed that his brother was not his
  normal self. So he listened without interruption to the lamest story he had
  ever heard; to the most transparent invention that had yet been displayed for
  the scorn of sceptic.</p>

  <p>"Who is Mrs. van Oynne?" he asked at last.</p>

  <p>"She's... well, I don't want to discuss her. I met her at a
  <i>conversazione</i> of the Theosophical Society. She's rather...
  wonderful."</p>

  <p>"I should say so," said Bobbie drily. "Of course you won't go?"</p>

  <p>It needed but this piece of assurance to decide Gordon.</p>

  <p>"Of course I shall go," he said firmly. "I need the change; I need the
  intellectual recreation."</p>

  <p>"But why go to Ostend to discuss souls? What's the matter with Battersea
  Park?" insisted Bobbie. "It's the most lunatic idea I have heard! And of
  course, if you're spotted in Ostend your name for henceforth and everlasting
  will be Waste Product Esquire. I suppose you're telling the truth. From any
  other man I wouldn't think twice about it; I'd know that it was a clumsy lie.
  Have you thought of Diana?"</p>

  <p>A staggering question: Gordon was taken aback.</p>

  <p>"I don't see how this affects Diana. What the dickens has she got to do
  with it?"</p>

  <p>"She's an inmate of your house," said Bobbie, in a serious mood. "Any
  reflection upon your good name is a reflection upon hers."</p>

  <p>"She can leave&mdash;I wish to heaven she would leave!" retorted Gordon
  viciously. "You don't imagine that I intend allowing the possibility of Diana
  knowing to stand in my way? She is an interloper&mdash;in a way I despise
  her. She's hateful to me sometimes. Are you going to help me or aren't
  you?"</p>

  <p>He flung the ultimatum across the table. Bobbie elected for peace.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose I shall have to wire to you much," he said. "Nothing is
  likely to turn up in your absence. What are you going to tell Diana?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Selsbury closed his eyes wearily.</p>

  <p>"Does it matter what I tell Diana?"</p>

  <p>A brave question. In his heart he knew that a story must be invented, and
  a very plausible story.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a particularly nimble liar," he said. "Think out something for
  me."</p>

  <p>Bobbie sniffed.</p>

  <p>"I am on my knees to you for the compliment," he said, but irony was
  wasted on Gordon. "Why not tell her you are going north for the
  shooting?"</p>

  <p>"I dislike subterfuge," Gordon deprecated with a wry face. "Why should I
  tell her anything? When does shooting start?"</p>

  <p>"It has started. Go to Scotland: it is remote. You're not likely to meet
  anybody you know because you won't be there."</p>

  <p>Gordon thought the flippancy in bad taste.</p>

  <p>"It is repugnant to me&mdash;this necessity for invention," he said. "Why
  must I give an account of my comings and goings? It is preposterous! I had
  better make my objective Aberdeen, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Diana! Of all the absurd arguments that had been raised against the Ostend
  trip, this was the most futile. The very mention of her name was a spur. By
  the time he had reached Cheynel Gardens the trip was definitely and
  irrevocably settled.</p>

  <p>He found a cable waiting for him at home. It was from his New York agent,
  advising him that Mr. Tilmet would call upon him on the Friday, and he
  realised with a shock that the to be, or not to be, of Ostend had put out of
  his mind an important business deal. His agent had purchased on his behalf
  the business of Tilmet and Voight, a none too prosperous firm of marine
  insurance brokers, operating in one of those queerly ancient offices on the
  Water Front. Mr. Tilmet had expressed a desire to be paid the money, fifty
  thousand dollars, in London, which he would visit en route to the Continent.
  The documents had arrived by an earlier mail, and Gordon had been advised
  that, the hour of Mr. Tilmet's arrival being uncertain, and his immediate
  departure for the more attractive countries of Europe being very likely, Mr.
  Tilmet would call at Cheynel Gardens to settle the deal. He glanced at the
  Times shipping list, noted that the Mauretania had been signalled five
  hundred miles west of the Lizard at twelve o'clock on the previous day, and
  made a mental calculation. He must have the money in the house to-morrow,
  though he objected emphatically to doing business except at his office.
  Still, the circumstances were unusual and the bargain excellent. He was not
  prepared to develop a grievance.</p>

  <p>Making a note on his memorandum pad, and a second note on the cover of his
  cheque-book, he went up to dress. He was dining with Heloise, and was
  carrying to her the news that he had made a decision in the matter which she
  had thought, and which she had had every right to think, had been settled
  beyond doubt.</p>

  <p>Coming down, he saw Diana on the stairs below. She also was in evening
  dress, a wonderful creamy white. There were two ropes of pearls about her
  neck; she wore no other jewellery. He followed her into The Study, and, as
  she turned, stared. It was a transfigured Diana, something ethereal,
  unearthly in her loveliness.</p>

  <p>"Why, Diana, you look awfully pretty," he said.</p>

  <p>The generosity of his race compelled the statement.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said indifferently. "I always look well in this colour.
  You are dining out too, I see? Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I'm dining at the Ritz," he said. "And you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to the Embassy. Mr. Collings is over here on business; he
  called this afternoon. He's my lawyer and a darling."</p>

  <p>Gordon murmured something agreeable. Diana, at any rate, was off his
  conscience for the night. And she certainly was lovely.</p>

  <p>Receptive to his unspoken admiration, she purred a little to herself,
  then, to his wrath, undid the excellent impression that she had made by
  unlocking a drawer in his sacred table.</p>

  <p>"I say, who gave you the key of that?" he asked indignantly.</p>

  <p>"I found one that fitted," she said, without embarrassment. "The drawer
  was empty except for a few queer German books, so I threw them out and had
  the lock changed. I must have some place to keep my things."</p>

  <p>He choked down his rising ire.</p>

  <p>"What things have you got?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"My jewel case."</p>

  <p>"That ought to be in the safe."</p>

  <p>"What is the combination?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Telma," he said, before he knew what he was saying. And not another soul
  in the world knew that secret!</p>

  <p>Before his exasperation could find adequate expression, she had taken from
  the drawer and laid on the desk a small black object, at the sight of which
  Gordon recoiled.</p>

  <p>"You really ought not to keep firearms in the house, Diana," he said
  nervously. "If you go fooling with a thing like that, you might do yourself
  an enormous amount of harm&mdash;in fact, kill yourself."</p>

  <p>"Fiddlesticks!" said Diana. "I know that gun inside out. I could hit that
  keyhole three times in the five"&mdash;she pointed to the door.</p>

  <p>"Well, don't," said he loudly. "Is it loaded?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally it's loaded," she replied, handling the weapon tenderly.
  "There's nothing in the breach, but the magazine is full. Shall I show you
  how it works?"</p>

  <p>"No, put the beastly thing away."</p>

  <p>Diana obeyed, locked the drawer and put the key in her handbag.</p>

  <p>"Telma&mdash;I must remember that," she mused.</p>

  <p>"I'd like you to forget it. I really never intended telling you or anybody
  else the combination of my safe. It isn't right that you should know. You
  might inadvertently&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I never do things inadvertently," said Diana. "I do them maliciously, or
  sinfully, but I do them deliberately. You can drop me at the Embassy," she
  said, as Eleanor helped her on with her cloak. "You're so near to the Ritz
  that you could fall into the front porch. Unless you're going to pick up
  somebody?" She looked round at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Gordon did intend picking up somebody, and his
  immediate objective was Buckingham Gate, where, in consequence of his change
  of plans, he arrived five minutes late. The restraint which Mrs. van Oynne
  showed was heroic. He was apologetic; under the influence of the bright
  restaurant and soft music, explanatory.</p>

  <p>"Diana again!" she said petulantly. "I almost think I dislike that
  Jane."</p>

  <p>"Diana, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I meant Diana," said Heloise hurriedly. "Gordon, you don't know how I'm
  looking forward to Saturday."</p>

  <p>"It occurred to me," said he, "that Saturday is rather a busy day, and the
  trains will be full with people going away for the week-end."</p>

  <p>She drew a long sigh.</p>

  <p>"We need not be travelling together," she said with resignation. "My, how
  scared you are!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not scared," protested the injured Gordon. "I'm scared for
  you&mdash;yes. That is the only thought I have. By the way, I told
  Robert."</p>

  <p>"That's your brother? What did he say?"</p>

  <p>She was curious.</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;Gordon hesitated&mdash;"Robert is a man of affairs, with
  little or no imagination, and at first he thought..." he shrugged his
  shoulders&mdash;"well, you know what a certain type of mind would think, my
  dear Heloise."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't we go on Friday?"</p>

  <p>"That's impossible. I've got a man coming to see me on Friday."</p>

  <p>He explained at length Mr. Tilmet's business, and the method he would
  follow to discharge the debt.</p>

  <p>Throughout the meal she observed that he was a little distrait, and
  explained his long silences by his dormant uneasiness about the forthcoming
  trip. In this surmise she was wrong. Gordon was thinking of Diana, and
  wondering how it was that he had never observed those factors of colouring
  and feature which had been so emphatic that night. In a way he had begun to
  tolerate Diana, and to find a grim amusement in his own discomfiture. She had
  proved a wonderful manager, had reduced expenses perceptibly; though her
  record of excellence as a housekeeper had been somewhat spoiled by an
  incident which came to Gordon in a roundabout way. She had entered the
  kitchen just after the butcher had left. One glance at the joint had been
  sufficient, and, as the butcher boy was gathering up his reins to drive off,
  a small shoulder of mutton came hurtling through the kitchen window. The
  elevation was excellent, the direction slightly faulty; the shoulder of
  mutton caught the butcher on the side of the head and almost knocked him off
  his perch. Then Diana appeared in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Cold storage," she said laconically. "Bring home-killed meat, or never
  darken our doors again!"</p>

  <p>The driver went off in a condition bordering upon hysteria. Thereafter,
  the meat supply showed a marked improvement.</p>

  <p>At first Gordon had been serious when this matter was reported to him
  respectfully and inoffensively by Trenter, who drew a small commission on all
  tradesmen's bills and took a charitable view of their shortcomings. But now,
  sitting vis-a-vis his pretty companion, the matter occurred to him in a fresh
  light.</p>

  <p>"Why are you smiling?" asked Heloise.</p>

  <p>"Was I?" he said apologetically. "I hadn't the slightest idea. I was
  thinking of something&mdash;er&mdash;something that happened in my
  office."</p>

  <p>Not in his wildest mood had he ever dreamt that he would lie about
  Diana.</p>

  <p>Mr. Collings, that eminent lawyer, had many friends in London, including
  important personages at Australia House. Diana went into the Embassy
  expecting a tete-a-tete meal, and found herself greeted by stately and
  elderly men and their stately and middle-aged wives. She was introduced to an
  Under Secretary for the Colonies, and manoeuvred herself to his side when she
  learnt that he was one of the coming men in the Government. Diana had
  suddenly decided that Gordon ought to have a title.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch08"
     name="ch08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When she got home that night she found Gordon had arrived
before her. He
  was thoughtful, unusually subdued; most remarkable of all, was to be seen,
  for he invariably went to bed as soon as he reached home after a dinner or
  theatre, and never by any chance was he in a conversational mood at such
  hours.</p>

  <p>"Good time?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Very. I met the cream of the Colonial Office. It was thin but genuine
  cream. Were you very late, and was she very annoyed?"</p>

  <p>Such a query, ordinarily, would be ignored.</p>

  <p>"Five minutes or so; the lady was naturally&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Peeved?" she suggested. "And it was a lady, after all? Gordon, let me see
  her?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"She wouldn't interest you, Diana. She is rather an intellectual."</p>

  <p>Diana was not offended.</p>

  <p>"The only thing I approve about the Bolsheviks is that they killed off the
  intelligentsia first," she said without heat. "I suppose they got tired of
  seeing their plays and hearing about their spiritual insides. What do you
  talk about&mdash;Bimetallism or Free Will?"</p>

  <p>He humoured her, being in a somewhat sympathetic mood. The strain of
  holding friendship to lecture-hall level was beginning to tell.</p>

  <p>"Books and people," he said lightly. "And you?"</p>

  <p>She threw her cloak over the back of a chair, pulled a stool to the fire
  and sat down, warming her knees. Gordon, the soul of delicacy, strolled out
  of the line of vision.</p>

  <p>"We talked about tradesmen and the superiority of Australian beef and the
  difficulty of finding servants and Mrs. Carter-Corrillo's fearful
  indiscretion&mdash;she went to France with the third secretary of the
  Montenegrin Embassy. She was only there three days, but, as Lady Pennefort
  said, there are twenty-four hours in every day. Some women are
  fools&mdash;and most men. This young man's career is ruined, even though he
  swears that their mutual interest in the gravel deposits of Abbeville was the
  explanation of the visit. They are both keen on geology."</p>

  <p>"And why shouldn't that be the true explanation?" demanded Gordon stoutly,
  his heart warming to the geological third secretary. "Why should not men and
  women have mutual scientific interests?"</p>

  <p>"We'll hear what the judge says," she answered complacently. "Mr. Carter-
  Corrillo is suing for a divorce."</p>

  <p>"On what grounds&mdash;incompatibility of interest in strata?" sneered
  Gordon.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly. Conventions are the by-laws of society. It is presumed
  that, if you break a by-law, you are capable of breaking the law."</p>

  <p>He stared, amazed at her cool inconsistency.</p>

  <p>"Here are you, living, unchaperoned, in the house of a
  bachelor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cousins are different," she said promptly. "Nobody suggests that the
  third secretary is Mrs. Carter-Corrillo's cousin. That would make a
  difference. Besides, everybody knows how much you dislike me."</p>

  <p>"I don't dislike you," after a moment's thought; "but if you think I do,
  why do you stay?"</p>

  <p>"I have a mission," she said, with a finality of tone that brought the
  subject out of discussion.</p>

  <p>Gordon broke the news of his impending departure after breakfast the next
  morning.</p>

  <p>"I am thinking of running up to Scotland to have a shot at the birds," he
  said. He felt rather like a liar.</p>

  <p>"What have they been doing?" she asked, her grey-blue eyes wide.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. One shoots them at this season of the year. You have game laws
  in Australia, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I have shot wallaby and dingo and rabbits and things, but
  never birds. To Scotland? That's an awful long way. Gordon, I shall be
  worried about you. There was a railway accident in the newspapers this
  morning. You'll send me a wire?"</p>

  <p>"From every station," he said sarcastically, and was ashamed of himself
  when she thanked him so warmly.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad&mdash;that is my eccentricity, a horrid fear that people I like
  are in railway accidents. Of course, I could always wire to the
  station-master to enquire about you, or to your hotel."</p>

  <p>Slowly it dawned upon Gordon Selsbury that in an unguarded and fatally
  foolish moment he had enormously complicated a situation already far from
  simple. To escape, to offer excuses, even to laugh off her anxiety, simulated
  or real, was impossible. A solution came to him and was instantly rejected.
  It came again because it was, in all the circumstances, the only solution.
  But it was one that could only be applied at the cost of his self-respect.
  Almost he cursed Heloise or whoever was the fool who had suggested this mad
  excursion,</p>

  <p>Trenter was laying out his master's clothes for dinner when Gordon
  strolled into his dressing-room.</p>

  <p>"Um... don't go, Trenter. When did you have your holiday?"</p>

  <p>"First week in April, sir."</p>

  <p>Gordon considered.</p>

  <p>"Do you know Scotland?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; I've been with several house parties for the September
  shooting."</p>

  <p>"Good. The fact is, Trenter, I'm going away on a&mdash;a peculiar mission.
  It is a secret even from my most intimate friends. There are reasons, very
  excellent reasons with which I need not trouble you, and which you certainly
  would not understand, why I should go secretly to one place whilst I am
  supposed to be at another."</p>

  <p>Trenter aimed wildly, but scored on the target at the first shot.</p>

  <p>"A lady, sir?" he ventured respectfully, meaning no harm&mdash;offering,
  in fact, a tribute to the known chivalry of the Selsburys.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>There was reason enough for the large and angry blush that darkened
  Gordon's face.</p>

  <p>"No, of course not. Business. Nothing at all to do with a lady."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, sir," said Trenter, and was.</p>

  <p>"We won't discuss my mission. What I want to say is this. Miss Ford, who
  is rather of a nervous disposition, has asked me to send her wires at
  intervals of the journey</p>

  <p>"And you want me to go to Scotland and send them," said Trenter
  brilliantly. Gordon had never respected his servant's intelligence so much as
  he did at that moment.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. It will save me a lot of worry. And," he added mysteriously, "if
  the wires fall into other hands, they will help deceive a Certain
  Person!"</p>

  <p>Trenter nodded wisely. He couldn't guess who the Certain Person was: even
  Gordon did not know. But lying grew easier with practice&mdash;he had grown
  reckless.</p>

  <p>"Not a word of this in the servants' hall," warned Gordon.</p>

  <p>The servitor smiled. Gordon had not seen him smile before. It was a
  strange sight.</p>

  <p>"No, sir; I shall tell them that my aunt in Bristol is ill (which she is)
  and that you've given me leave. How long do you want me to be away, sir?"</p>

  <p>"A week," said Gordon.</p>

  <p>Mr. Trenter went down to the servants' hall importantly.</p>

  <p>"The old man's given me a week's holiday to see my aunt. I'm leaving to-
  morrow."</p>

  <p>Eleanor was constitutionally suspicious.</p>

  <p>"Bit sudden, isn't it? He's going away tomorrow too. You men are devils!
  Us women never know what you're up to."</p>

  <p>Trenter smiled cryptically. It added to his self-confidence to be
  suspected of devilish deeds.</p>

  <p>"<i>Noos verrong</i>," he said, and added the information: "French."</p>

  <p>"Is Miss Diana going?" asked the cook.</p>

  <p>"With me or him?" demanded Trenter insolently. "She's not going with him!
  And do I blame him? No! She's no lady, that's my firm opinion."</p>

  <p>"Then keep it to yourself!" said Eleanor, shrill of voice. "I don't want
  you to say anything about Miss Diana!"</p>

  <p>"You women stick together." Trenter could not but admire the trait.</p>

  <p>"And you men stick at nothing." Eleanor's sincerity gave sanction to
  inconsequence. "She's too good for him. I suppose you're both off on some
  gallivanting business? So far as I am concerned you're welcome! You've been
  an experience, and every girl ought to have experience&mdash;up to a point.
  Your wife can have you."</p>

  <p>"If I've told you once, I've told you forty million times that I'm not
  married!" hissed Trenter. "I had to be married because he wanted a married
  man for a butler, and if I'd said I was single I should have lost the job.
  That temper of yours, my girl, is going to be your ruin."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't talk disp&mdash;whatever the word is&mdash;about Miss Diana,"
  she sulked.</p>

  <p>"I don't trouble my head about her, because I don't think there's anybody
  in the world like you, Eleanor," he urged.</p>

  <p>She admitted later that there was much to be said for his point of
  view.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch09"
     name="ch09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the early days, when Trenter had known him, Mr. Superbus
was a court
  bailiff, a man who seized the property of unsuccessful litigants, who served
  writs, attached furniture, and committed all those barbarous acts peculiar to
  his office. But progression, the inexorable law of getting on, the natural
  craving for success, brought Mr. Superbus from the atmosphere of a dull
  county court to a small office in the Insurance Trust Building, and the
  distinction of having his name painted upon the glass panel of the door. He
  was officially styled "First Enquiry Clerk." The "detective" which was
  printed on the corner of his visiting card was wholly unofficial, and his
  request to his superiors that a nickel badge should be designed that he might
  wear on his waistcoat and display at fitting moments when it was necessary to
  disclose his identity, was refused as being "impracticable and
  undesirable."</p>

  <p>The cinematograph is at once educative and inspirational. Mr. Superbus
  spent most of his spare evenings in watching the pictures. Those he liked
  best dealt with the careers of young, beautiful but penurious girls, who were
  pursued by rich and remorseless villains, and were rescued in the nick of
  time from a fate which is popularly supposed to be worse than death, by a
  handsome young hero, with the assistance of a stern-faced officer of the law,
  who smoked cigars, wore a derby hat, and from time to time turned back his
  coat to display the badge of his calling. A film which had no detective, and
  dealt merely with the love of a millionaire's beautiful young wife for his
  secretary, was unpalatable to him, even though it featured his favourite
  artists and showed, in the course of its telling, tremendous railway
  accidents, landslides, riots and the enervating effects of cocaine.</p>

  <p>Before the open window of his parlour, Mr. Superbus sat in a state of
  profound meditation. Though the day was chilly, he was in his shirtsleeves,
  for he was one of those hot-blooded men in whom the variations of climate
  peculiar to his native land produced no effect. It was an open secret that he
  was one of those hardy souls who swam in the Serpentine every Christmas Day,
  preferably breaking the ice to get in, and his portrait appeared with
  monotonous regularity every twenty-sixth of December in all the better-class
  illustrated newspapers.</p>

  <p>His good lady came bustling in with a shiver. She restricted her own
  bathing operations to the decent privacy of a four by seven bathroom.</p>

  <p>"You'll catch your death of cold there, Julius," she said. "Fancy sitting
  there from morning till night doing nothing!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not doing nothing," said Julius quietly. "I'm thinking."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's what I call doing nothing," said Mrs. Superbus, bustling
  round and laying the cloth.</p>

  <p>She had an extraordinary appreciation of her husband's qualities, admired
  him secretly, but felt that the smooth harmonies of matrimony might well be
  disturbed if she committed the error of showing her feelings.</p>

  <p>"It's beyond me how you puzzle these things out," she said.</p>

  <p>"It's brains," explained Julius.</p>

  <p>"You get such ideas," she said in despair. "I wonder you don't go on the
  stage."</p>

  <p>It was her conviction that the stage was the ultimate goal of all genius;
  its greatest reward; its most natural line of development.</p>

  <p>"This Double Dan is certainly a bit of a puzzle, though I've worked out
  bigger problems in my time, mother."</p>

  <p>She nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>"The way you mended the cistern last week beats me," she said. "After that
  I'll believe anything. Who is this Double Dan?"</p>

  <p>"He's a swindler," said Mr.. Superbus, "a parasite of society, a human
  vampire&mdash;but I'll get him!"</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised the police don't go after him," she said.</p>

  <p>He was naturally irritated, and his laughter lacked sincerity.</p>

  <p>"The police! No, mother, the man who's going to get Double Dan has got to
  be clever, he's got to be cunning, he's got to be artful."</p>

  <p>"I don't know anybody artfuller than you, Julius," said his wife
  graciously, and Mr. Superbus accepted the compliment as his right.</p>

  <p>He might speak disparagingly of the police, as he did; as all private
  detectives, authors of mystery stories and such-like are in the habit of
  doing. But his knowledge that Double Dan was in London, the hint that had
  been whispered up from the underworld that Mr. Gordon Selsbury was to be the
  new victim; these and a hundred other little pointers of incalculable value
  came to him fourth-hand from Scotland Yard. After his midday dinner he put on
  his coat and strolled to Cheynel Gardens. Gordon was out, and he was received
  by Diana.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course, you're Mr.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Superbus," said Julius.</p>

  <p>"The Roman!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus confessed to that distinction. He might have added "ultimus
  Romanorum," only he was unacquainted with the phrase. Instead he remarked, a
  little pathetically:</p>

  <p>"There ain't many of us left."</p>

  <p>"I bet there ain't," said Diana. "Sit down and have some tea. You want to
  see Mr. Selsbury, but he won't be back for an hour."</p>

  <p>"I did and I didn't," said Julius the obscure. "What I want to do is to
  keep a certain eye on a certain fellow."</p>

  <p>He did not particularise the eye, but Diana guessed that it might be that
  which was nearest to her: it looked the less glassy of the two. In the matter
  of the certain fellow she sought information.</p>

  <p>"Double Dan&mdash;I remember. Who is he, Mr. Superbus?"</p>

  <p>"Well, ma'am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Miss."</p>

  <p>"You don't look it," he said gallantly, if vaguely. "This Double Dan is a
  desperado, and is believed to emanate from the West."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean West London?"</p>

  <p>"I mean America," said Julius, "where most of the desperadoes come from.
  And go to," he added, with a recollection of certain past defaulters, whose
  disappearance had been hampering to him as a bailiff of the court.</p>

  <p>She listened attentively while Mr. Superbus described the misdoings of the
  impersonator.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing this fellow can't do, miss," said Superbus impressively.
  "He can make himself fat, he can make himself thin; he can impersonate a tall
  man or a short man, an old man or a young man. By all accounts he was an
  actor onthealls."</p>

  <p>"Onthealls?" She wrinkled her brow, thinking for the moment that Mr.
  Superbus had dug up one of those natty colloquialisms that enlivened the
  Senate in those days when Cicero could always be depended upon to pass a few
  bright, snappy remarks about the Tribune Clodius.</p>

  <p>"An actor onthealls," repeated Mr. Superbus, astounded that he was
  unintelligible.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see!" a great light dawning upon her mind. "On the halls? You mean
  the vaudeville stage?"</p>

  <p>"So they say," said Mr. Superbus. "Anyway, he's been too clever for the
  regular police. It's now up to them who have made a study of crime, so to
  speak, to bring him to justice."</p>

  <p>He looked cautiously round the apartment and lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>"By all accounts, Mr. Selsbury's the next."</p>

  <p>Diana sat bolt upright in her chair.</p>

  <p>"You means he's to be the next person robbed?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"From information received," he said.</p>

  <p>"But does he know?"</p>

  <p>"I've dropped an 'int, miss," said Julius. "But on the whole it's better
  that he didn't know. A man gets jiggered, so to speak, if he knows a crook is
  after him, and that hampers the officers of the law." He shook his head.
  "Many a good case have I lost that way."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean exactly by impersonation?" asked Diana, troubled. "Do
  you mean to say that, when Mr. Selsbury is out, somebody who looks very much
  like him is liable to walk into this house and help himself to anything that
  he can find?"</p>

  <p>"Cheques mostly, or money," affirmed Julius. "He works big, this fellow.
  Nothing small about him, you understand. You could leave your silver around,
  and he wouldn't touch so much as an egg-spoon. He's one of the big
  gang&mdash;I've had my eye on him for years."</p>

  <p>"This is very alarming," said Diana after a long silence.</p>

  <p>"It is alarming," agreed Julius, "but at the same time, if you've got the
  right kind of man around to protect you, a fellow who's a bit sharp, it's not
  alarming. But he's got to be clever, and he's got to have experience of what
  I might term the criminal classes, I should say."</p>

  <p>"You mean yourself?" Diana smiled faintly, not in the mood to be
  amused.</p>

  <p>"I mean me," said Julius. "If I was you, miss, I'd drop a hint to Mr.
  Selsbury. Maybe he takes more notice of what his daughter says."</p>

  <p>At parting he took her hand in his own large, purple paw, called her "Miss
  Selsbury" and asked to be remembered to her father. When Gordon came home,
  she told him of the visit.</p>

  <p>"Superbus, eh?" said Gordon good-naturedly. "He called for a tip. But why,
  in the name of heaven, he should start in to alarm you, I don't know. I must
  speak to the Association about it."</p>

  <p>"He didn't alarm me at all," said Diana, "except when he asked to be
  remembered to my father, and said that you were more likely to be influenced
  by your young and gentle daughter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Does he think I'm your father?" demanded Gordon indignantly. "That
  fellow's got a nerve! As for Double Dan, I shouldn't think very much about
  him if I were you, Diana. He certainly caught old Mendlesohn, but then, old
  Mendlesohn is a philandering old fool. He allowed himself to be trapped by
  the woman who works with the scoundrel and acts as his decoy duck."</p>

  <p>The mail boat was in, Gordon noted, glancing at his newspaper the next
  morning. He had arranged to remain at home that day, and his accountant
  called at the house with a carefully engrossed receipt form and the office
  cheque- book. Gordon filled a blank for eleven thousand and a few odd
  pounds.</p>

  <p>"I want fifty thousand dollars in gold bills; you'll buy them at the Bank
  of England. Bring them back here in a taxicab, Miller. You have told the
  office that wires are to be telephoned to me? Good. I expect a message from
  Mr. Tilmet."</p>

  <p>The message did not come until long after the bills had been deposited in
  The Study safe.</p>

  <p>It was from Paris, to the effect that Mr. Tilmet had landed at Cherbourg
  and would be in London on the Sunday; he added that he would leave for
  Holland that same night. Gordon, in his genteel way, consigned the American
  to the devil.</p>

  <p>He saw Heloise that afternoon. She was a being exalted at the prospect of
  the trip, and his last desperate appeal to her that it should be cancelled
  was unmade. They were to meet at a quarter to eleven on the platform at
  Victoria, and were to travel as strangers until they reached Ostend. The
  passage looked likely to be a good one; the weather bureau reported a smooth
  sea and light easterly winds.</p>

  <p>Trenter had packed his big carry-all, and had included one of the new
  suits&mdash;that grey check with a little red in it&mdash;which had arrived
  belatedly from the tailor. The case had been secretly transported to a hotel
  in the neighbourhood of Victoria, where Gordon had to change. Nothing
  remained to be done but to prepare the telegrams which Trenter was to send.
  He could do this with a light heart, for it had occurred to him that if,
  taking advantage of his absence, the criminal impersonator should call (he
  regarded this as the least likely of any happening) the wires would confound
  and expose him. He felt almost as if he were doing a worthy deed.</p>

  <p>The first he marked in the corner "Euston," and inscribed "Just leaving,
  Gordon." He wrote a number of "Good journey, all wells" for York, Edinburgh
  and Inverness.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, Diana came to him that day for some money.</p>

  <p>"I arranged the transfer of my money to the London branch of the Bank of
  Australasia, but there has been some sort of hitch. I called today and the
  transfer has not arrived. Save me from penury, Gordon&mdash;I'm a ruined
  woman."</p>

  <p>She displayed dramatically the empty inside of a notecase. Gordon felt a
  queer satisfaction in signing a cheque for her, recovered a little of the
  kind- fatherly feeling appropriate to their relationship.</p>

  <p>"And to think that, if you had really turned me out, I should have
  starved!" taking the slip from his hand. "Gordon, behind a rugged and
  unprepossessing exterior, you hide a heart of gold."</p>

  <p>"I sometimes wish you were a little more serious," he said in good
  humour.</p>

  <p>"I'm always wishing that you weren't," she said.</p>

  <p>Gordon was temporarily deprived of the full use of The Study in the
  afternoon. There could be no more remarkable proof of Diana's dynamic
  qualities than the arrival of post office linesmen to move the telephone from
  the hall to Gordon's room&mdash;and that within forty-eight hours of her
  notifying the Postmaster General of her desires. Gordon demurred at first.
  The telephone was an invasion of his privacy. Diana was flippant and he was
  in no spirit for a fight.</p>

  <p>Bobbie was at dinner that night, and, when they were alone, asked her a
  question that he had asked himself many times.</p>

  <p>"Why do you stick this kind of existence, Diana? You've heaps of money and
  could be having a really good time instead of rushing round after
  Gordon."</p>

  <p>She looked up under her curling lashes.</p>

  <p>"Does Gordon want me here? Has he ever wanted me? No, sir! When I came I
  left my baggage in the hall: I intended taking his advice about hotels and
  things. I never had the slightest intention of stopping&mdash;till I saw him
  and heard him, and read the panic he was in at the idea of my remaining in
  the house, and heard him become paternal and my-dear-little-girly. So I
  stayed. The day Gordon wants me to stay&mdash;I go!"</p>

  <p>The atmosphere of the house was electric: Bobbie felt it, Diana was
  conscious of an uneasiness that was not to be accounted for by the errors of
  banking officials. Even in the servants' hall hysteria made a mild
  manifestation. Eleanor had a premonition which she called by another
  name.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure something's going to happen."</p>

  <p>When she was nervous her voice grew high-pitched.</p>

  <p>"Don't be ridiculous." Trenter's voice lacked confidence.</p>

  <p>"I wish you wasn't&mdash;weren't going away," she sobbed. "I've got the
  creeps. That window man will do something. The moment I saw him I said 'that
  man's a villain,' didn't I, cook?"</p>

  <p>"You did. You said 'I'm sure there's something wrong about that man,'"
  agreed cook.</p>

  <p>As for Gordon Selsbury, he went to bed at ten. At one o'clock he was
  pacing his room. At three he went down to The Study and started the
  percolator working. Whilst the coffee was in process of making, he opened the
  safe and took out the fifty thousand dollars, counted them and put them back.
  The safe looked very fragile, he thought. Once this wretched trip was over he
  would attend to the matter. The house was not difficult to burgle. The big,
  stained- glass window&mdash;an enterprising craftsman with a penknife could
  get in....</p>

  <p>In a corner of the room flush with the window was a small door, hidden
  behind a curtain. This led to the courtyard and was never used. As to its
  design, and what purpose it was intended to serve, only the builder and
  original owner of the house might testify. His name was Gugglewaite, he had
  been three times divorced, and was at the moment in heaven&mdash;or his well-
  edited epitaph lied.</p>

  <p>Gordon went upstairs for his pass-key, opened the door and stepped out
  into the "garden." It was very dark and still, and the wet wind smelt sweet
  and fresh. Across the yard was a door that gave to a small side passage. The
  wall was high, but no obstacle to an active burglar. He shivered and went in
  again to his coffee and a returning serenity induced by the fire he had
  kindled and the comfort of his surroundings.</p>

  <p>He would have gladly given a thousand&mdash;ten thousand&mdash;to cancel
  his fool adventure; to remain here with... well, with Diana. He told himself
  this with a certain defiance as though one half of a dual personality were
  challenging the other. Diana was really a dear. He wished he had been a
  little more loyal to her and had talked less about Dempsi... a boy and girl
  affair and perfectly understandable. On Dempsi, his identity, his appearance,
  he mused till the light began to show in a ghostly fashion behind the painted
  window.</p>

  <p>There was no thrill in the secrecy, the plotting, the wile within wile.
  Gordon smelt the meanness of it, and sometimes he quavered. It made matters a
  thousand times worse that Diana was so sweet about everything.</p>

  <p>It had occurred to him that he would have to depend upon her to deal with
  Mr. Tilmet when he called. Nobody else could possibly cope with that elusive
  gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Surely," she said without hesitation. "Have you the receipt ready and the
  final contract? It isn't worth paper unless it has been drawn up by an
  American notary. Auntie bought an oil well in Texas and she had to find an
  American attorney before the contract could be made."</p>

  <p>"And she was swindled, of course?" said Gordon. "All these oil properties
  are swindles."</p>

  <p>"She made seventy thousand dollars out of the deal," said Diana. "Auntie
  had an irresistible attraction for bargain money. The bills are in the
  safe?"</p>

  <p>"With the contract and the receipt. Really, Diana, you're almost a
  business woman!"</p>

  <p>"Your patronage is offensive, but I feel sure that you mean well," said
  Diana without heat. "Let me see that money."</p>

  <p>He opened the safe and she counted it, bill by bill, before she snapped
  the door close and spun the handle.</p>

  <p>"Good," she said. "I will have a spring clean whilst you are away. I have
  sent for a man to clean the windows of The Study. They are in a shocking
  state. And, Gordon, with Trenter and you away, I shall need extra help. I
  will have a man and his wife here. There is an attic room where they can
  sleep: is that in order?"</p>

  <p>Diana was brisk, business-like, imposingly capable. Gordon realised that
  she was unconsciously ramming home her indispensability.</p>

  <p>Eleanor, coming in to put the room in order, found him in his dressing-
  gown, asleep before the black ashes of the fire, and her squeal of fear woke
  him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir, you gave me such a fright!"</p>

  <p>He rose stiffly, blinking at her.</p>

  <p>"Did I....? I'm sorry, Eleanor. Will you send Trenter to me in my
  room?"</p>

  <p>A bad start to a very bad day's business. He ached from head to foot,
  until his bath gave him some bodily ease.</p>

  <p>"Eleanor says you were asleep before the study fire. When did you come
  down, Gordon?" Diana asked at breakfast.</p>

  <p>"About three o'clock, I think. I remembered work that had to be done."</p>

  <p>She was concerned.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go by the night train&mdash;you could sleep?" she
  suggested, and he forced a smile.</p>

  <p>"I shall sleep all right," he said with spurious gaiety.</p>

  <p>The talk went off in another direction, and then Bobbie came in for final
  instructions. Gordon was unaccountably irritated by this act of devotion to
  duty, and his "Good-morning" was like the crack of a whip.</p>

  <p>"After you have gone," said Diana, "I shall ask Trenter to show me such of
  your clothes as need go to the cleaners."</p>

  <p>"Trenter is going before me," he said hastily. "He's catching a train to
  Bristol. His aunt is seriously ill."</p>

  <p>"What on earth's the matter with you?" gasped Bobbie.</p>

  <p>Gordon turned, ready to be offensive, but it was not he at whom Bobbie was
  staring. Diana's face was ghastly; her eyes were wide with a terror she could
  not conceal; her skin the colour of chalk. Gordon jumped up and ran to
  her.</p>

  <p>"Whatever's the matter?" he asked, in genuine alarm.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she said with a gasp. "Perhaps I'm feeling the parting. I
  always go like this when my cousins go away!"</p>

  <p>"Have you had bad news?"</p>

  <p>Her letters were open on the table. She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No; the butcher's arithmetic is a little embrangled. Ever heard that word
  before, Gordon? I guess you haven't! I found it in <i>Tom Brown's School
  Days</i>. Bobbie, don't stare, it's very rude..."</p>

  <p>Under her covering hand was the letter she had been reading.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dempsi was very much alive: was in London at that moment. The opening
  lines of his letter were significant.</p>

  <p>"My bride! I have come to claim you!" Dempsi always wrote like that.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Ten minutes later, Bobbie walked into his brother's room
without knocking,
  and interrupted what seemed to be a very confidential interview. Trenter
  pocketed a sheaf of telegrams in haste, but not so quickly that Bobbie did
  not see them. He made no comment until Mr. Trenter, in his best suit and
  looking unusually spruce, had made a hurried departure.</p>

  <p>"Trenter's going down to see his sick aunt," explained his master.</p>

  <p>"He looks like that," said Bobbie. "The chrysanthemum in his buttonhole
  will cheer her immensely. Is the faithful Trenter in the swindle too?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean by 'swindle,'" said Gordon loudly. "I wish I
  hadn't told you anything about it!"</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't, only you wanted somebody to stand by you in case anything
  went wrong. That is, anything but you."</p>

  <p>Gordon glared at him.</p>

  <p>"I shall not go wrong, believe me!"</p>

  <p>"I don't," said Bobbie. And then, hastily: "At least, I do, but nobody
  else would."</p>

  <p>"You can't understand these&mdash;it's a hateful word, but there is no
  better&mdash;affinities," said Gordon, "these understandings and yearnings
  for something which&mdash;which&mdash;well, somebody else can't give you.
  Some magic that draws a man's confidence and kills all sense of time and
  obligation."</p>

  <p>Bobbie nodded wisely.</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;a woman."</p>

  <p>Gordon stood erect.</p>

  <p>"Bobbie," he said awfully, "I tell you this is not an affair&mdash;at any
  rate, it is different from other kinds of affairs."</p>

  <p>"So are all other kinds of affairs," said Bobbie. "That's why the judges
  have been working overtime. I dare say I am cynical: I can afford to be, I'm
  a bachelor. The lady has a husband?"</p>

  <p>"Heloise is married," said Gordon gravely.</p>

  <p>"Heloise? I must remember that name. And Trenter, I presume, is going into
  the country to post the necessary telegrams to give verisimilitude to an
  otherwise unconvincing narrative. I hate quoting Gilbert at you, but the
  situation is a little Gilbertian. What is she like?"</p>

  <p>Gordon was not inclined to particularise.</p>

  <p>"Of course, if you're going to make trouble&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't be an ass," said Bobbie. "I'm not going to give you away because,
  for some extraordinary reason, I believe you."</p>

  <p>A knock at the door: it was Eleanor.</p>

  <p>"Will you see Mr. Superbus?" she said.</p>

  <p>"No," snapped Gordon. "Get me a cab."</p>

  <p>"Who's Mr. Superbus?"</p>

  <p>"He's the detective I told you about; the man that is watching for Double
  Dan."</p>

  <p>Bobbie whistled: it was an exasperating trick of his.</p>

  <p>"Double Dan? By Jove! I didn't think of him. Gordon, you're taking a risk.
  Is there any money in the house?"</p>

  <p>"I told you."</p>

  <p>"You keep telling me you've told me things. I think your mind is
  wandering."</p>

  <p>"There's fifty thousand dollars in the safe. Diana's looking after it. The
  combination word is 'Telma'&mdash;I told her, and I might as well tell you.
  It is for Tilmet, who's calling on Sunday, but Diana will look after
  that."</p>

  <p>"Double Dan," repeated Bobbie softly. "And you're the very bird he could
  impersonate to the life! Sometimes I do it myself unconsciously. A little
  pomp, a little strut, a little preciousness of speech&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gordon waved him out of the room. He had reached the limit of his
  patience.</p>

  <p>Diana was out when he came down, and he was not sorry. Also, the telephone
  receiver was on the table; he replaced it in the hook.</p>

  <p>"Where is Miss Ford?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Miss Ford had to go out. She asked me to say good-bye to you, sir," said
  Eleanor. "Will you see Mr. Superbus?"</p>

  <p>"No, I will not see Mr. Superbus. Tell him&mdash;well, tell him anything
  you like. I've got a train to catch."</p>

  <p>He was gone in such a hurry that Bobbie had not time to get the
  information he had come to procure&mdash;Gordon had not told him the address
  to which he was to wire. There was time to go after him, but his immediate
  objective was unknown. It was obviously too early for the train, and Bobbie
  had such a sense of delicacy that he would not take the risk of a chance
  meeting with the fascinating Mrs. van Oynne. He sat down, waiting for Diana's
  return, and puzzling over the change which a letter had wrought in her. That
  it was a letter, he knew. Sharper of eye than his brother, he had noticed the
  closely written page beneath her hand. Diana had her secrets too.</p>

  <p>As for Gordon, he was a fool, an utter, hopeless, dithering maniac! Bobbie
  got up and walked across to the safe, hesitated a moment, then manipulated
  the dial and pulled the door open.</p>

  <p>Except for a receipt form and a four page contract, the safe was empty. Of
  money there was none!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was half an hour before Diana came back, and she still
showed the
  effects of the shock she had received at breakfast time.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Bobbie!" She glanced at his face. "What is the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Diana"&mdash;he spoke slowly&mdash;"you're in some kind of trouble."</p>

  <p>"Some kind!" She flung her hat recklessly on the table. "Every kind, my
  dear child!"</p>

  <p>He did not smile.</p>

  <p>"Gordon told me that he had left fifty thousand dollars in the safe to pay
  an American who's calling on Sunday. He gave me the combination."</p>

  <p>She stood before him, her hands behind her.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"The money is not there."</p>

  <p>A little pause.</p>

  <p>"And do you know why?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I've been worried to death.</p>

  <p>He didn't take it?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I took it," she said. "Bobbie, Dempsi is alive!"</p>

  <p>"Alive? Dempsi? Impossible!"</p>

  <p>She nodded many times.</p>

  <p>"He is alive! I've had a letter from him this morning&mdash;thirteen
  pages&mdash;you could have used any one of them as a mustard leaf. I'm
  scared!"</p>

  <p>"But I thought he was lost in the bush?" said Bobbie.</p>

  <p>She smiled painfully and dropped into the chair in which Gordon had spent
  the night.</p>

  <p>"He was found in the bush," she said. "He had fever or something and was
  discovered by the Jackies. They took him to their village. Bobbie, Dempsi is
  half Irish and half Italian. Which half is most mad? Because that's the half
  that wrote."</p>

  <p>Bobbie considered for a long time.</p>

  <p>"He knows you're not married?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Diana calmly. "We talked on the telephone just after you left
  the room, and his first words were: 'Are you single? We'll be married to-
  morrow. If you're married, you'll be a widow to-night!' I knew at once that
  it was Dempsi."</p>

  <p>"What did you say?" he asked, awe-stricken.</p>

  <p>"I told him I was married," she said, with such coolness that he was
  inarticulate. "I couldn't very well explain why I was here if I wasn't
  married, could I? Then he got so violent that I told him I was a widow.
  Bobbie, isn't lying easy?"</p>

  <p>Bobbie could say nothing.</p>

  <p>"Then he sprang another one on me, and I told him that I was living with
  my Uncle Isaac&mdash;I used to have an Uncle Isaac," she said in
  self-defence. "He was a sort of an adopted uncle. He died of delirium
  tremens. All our family have done something out of the common. I couldn't say
  I was living alone in this big house, and anyhow, Gordon is away. It's
  wonderful luck, his going."</p>

  <p>Bobbie paced the floor in a state of supreme agitation.</p>

  <p>"What about the money?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I owed it to him. Before he ran away into the bush we had a terrible
  scene. He wanted me to elope with him, and when I wouldn't, he said he would
  commit suicide. He was like a madman; he cried over me, he kissed my feet,
  and then went off to lose himself in the bush. He didn't even do that
  properly."</p>

  <p>"And the money?"</p>

  <p>"He gave it to me, or the cat or somebody. Anyway, I had it. Dempsi hadn't
  a relation in the world, and I just banked the money with my own." She bit
  her lip. "I intended putting up such a beautiful monument to him," she added
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>Bobbie drew a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear girl, as you've obviously sent him the money, the worst is
  over. You can replace it: the banks do not close till twelve."</p>

  <p>"How am I to replace it?" she asked scornfully. "I've no money in my own
  bank, except a few pounds that I opened the account with when I came to
  London. I took the fifty thousand dollars and put eight thousand pounds to my
  own account. Here's the rest." She drew out a wad of bills and handed them to
  him.</p>

  <p>Bobbie looked at her aghast.</p>

  <p>"But this Tilmet, this American&mdash;you've got to find the money for
  him?"</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd get it for me," she said, her big eyes fixed pleadingly
  on him.</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"It'll want some doing. You can't raise eight thousand in real money in
  two hours. Is this money of Gordon's in your bank?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm sending Dempsi a cheque by special messenger. He's living in a little
  hotel in the Edgware Road."</p>

  <p>"He mentioned the money then?"</p>

  <p>"He made a casual reference," she said, "which my conscience probably
  magnified into a demand. Phew!" She fanned herself with her hand.</p>

  <p>Bobbie locked away the remaining ten thousand dollars.</p>

  <p>"I'll see what I can do. May I telephone?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"You may do anything you please except ask me to marry Dempsi," she said
  wearily.</p>

  <p>His first call was to his bank, and the conversation was not encouraging.
  Bobbie had just paid from his account heavy bills, and he was slightly
  overdrawn. To the suggestion that the overdraft should be increased, the
  manager turned an unsympathetic ear. And then, at the end of the third call,
  when Bobbie was in a condition of frenzy, Eleanor came in with a telegram,
  and the girl opened it quickly.</p>

  <p>"Saved!" she whooped.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" said Bobbie, snatching the form from her hand.</p>

  <p>It was dated Paris and was from the American's secretary.</p>

  <p>"Feared Mr. Tilmet has contracted measles. Will not be able to arrive in
  London for another fortnight."</p>

  <p>"Thank God for measles!" wailed Diana.</p>

  <p>Bobbie wiped his streaming forehead.</p>

  <p>"I've a good mind to take the remainder of this money away," he said, "I
  don't like it being in the house."</p>

  <p>For answer, she opened the drawer of the desk and took out the black-
  muzzled Browning.</p>

  <p>"Burglars are my specialty," she said.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind putting that lethal weapon away?" said Bobbie. "What a
  bloodthirsty little devil you are!"</p>

  <p>"I am," said Diana. "There's murder in my bones at this particular moment.
  Yes, Eleanor?"</p>

  <p>"Are you going to see Mr. Superbus?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know he was here. Ask him to come in, will you?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus came, in his stately, senatorial fashion, and was introduced
  to Bobbie. It was obvious he sought a very private interview indeed, but
  Diana explained in what relationship Bobbie stood.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to have missed Mr. Selsbury," said Julius. "Information having
  come to me last night through my secret agent about a certain party."</p>

  <p>"You mean Double Dan?"</p>

  <p>Diana reacted instantly. For the moment she hadn't a care in the
  world.</p>

  <p>"It's no laughing matter, miss." Mr. Superbus shook his head, and invited,
  with a wave of the hand, bent forward to see his feet and sat down slowly.
  "No, it isn't any laughing matter, ma'am&mdash;miss. If he walked in at that
  door"&mdash;he pointed&mdash;"made up for the part, you'd think it was your
  father."</p>

  <p>Diana raised a protesting hand.</p>

  <p>"May I explain, in passing, that Mr. Selsbury is not my father?"</p>

  <p>Julius graciously indicated that she had his permission.</p>

  <p>"Dan is wonderful! I was telling my good lady only this morning that, if
  she sees a fellow looking like me trying to get into the house when I'm
  supposed to be away, she must make him take his shirt off&mdash;I've got a
  lucky mole on my shoulder, miss&mdash;ma'am&mdash;miss. Why moles are
  supposed to be lucky I've never discovered."</p>

  <p>Diana turned to Bobbie.</p>

  <p>"This is rather alarming."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," said Bobbie. "Lots of people have moles."</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd. I mean Double Dan."</p>

  <p>"But why should he come here?" asked Bobbie, well aware that the contents
  of the safe, such as they were, justified a visit. But it was Mr. Superbus
  who answered.</p>

  <p>"That's what they all say, but there's always a reason, miss. My good lady
  said to me 'Why should he come here?' but I pointed out that&mdash;what's in
  that safe? Any valuables there?" He pointed to the wall.</p>

  <p>"Nothing very much," said Diana hastily. "Tell us some more about this
  person, Mr. Superbus."</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus smiled to himself.</p>

  <p>"I'm the greatest living authority on him," he said modestly, "that's what
  I am! He's a very plausible fellow, and works with a girl. Whether or
  not&mdash;well, let's say it's his wife. She wangles the information out of
  the fellow that Dan is going to rob. Do you see?"</p>

  <p>Diana nodded.</p>

  <p>"I see. She's a sort of decoy who gets to know the victim."</p>

  <p>"Know him! Well, I should say she did, miss&mdash;it would be much easier
  to tell you everything if you was ma'am."</p>

  <p>"Well, imagine I am," smiled Diana. "She gets to know him very well?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus nodded.</p>

  <p>"I should say so! She starts a hand-holding friendship, if I might
  describe it."</p>

  <p>"But surely not always?" interrupted Bobbie. "She didn't catch old
  Mendlesohn that way? He must be sixty-five!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus was amused.</p>

  <p>"Sixty-five! Why, of course she did! The sixty-fivers are the worst.
  They're easy. Mind you, there's nothing more than a high-class friendship in
  it, if I may use the word. The people she likes to get hold of are the
  thinkers&mdash;she's got a classy line of language. You know the sort of
  stuff that highbrows talk."</p>

  <p>"A soul, in fact?" smiled Diana. "Does she represent herself as being
  married?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there's always a husband in the background. Sometimes he lives
  abroad, sometimes he's in a lunatic asylum, but he's mostly out of the
  way."</p>

  <p>Bobbie staggered and caught hold of a chair for support. Happily, Diana
  did not notice his wan excitement.</p>

  <p>"And then what happens?" she asked, a little nervous as to whether Mr.
  Superbus was still confounding "miss" with "ma'am."</p>

  <p>"Well, she lures him away," said Mr. Superbus. "There's no other word for
  it. She lures him away. And whilst they're away, up comes Double Dan with all
  the dear departed's little tricks&mdash;his voice, his funny little ways,
  which the girl has been studying and passing on to Dan. You understand, miss?
  I've collected all this information myself. It's a coop with me. 'Coop' is
  French for 'cop.'"</p>

  <p>"And the girl?" asked Diana.</p>

  <p>"Oh, she gets away too&mdash;pretends her husband's come back unexpectedly
  from foreign parts; but she does it so that the fellow can't return home.
  Usually he's told people that he's going away for a fortnight or so, and
  naturally, he doesn't want to come back."</p>

  <p>"How perfectly disgusting!" said Diana with a wry face.</p>

  <p>"That's what I say," said Mr. Superbus earnestly. "Having allowed a
  gentleman to go so far&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"At any rate, we need not have any fear about Mr. Selsbury," said Diana
  with a quiet smile.</p>

  <p>Evidently Mr. Superbus had fears about Mr. Selsbury. He looked around in
  his mysterious way, and then:</p>

  <p>"He's gone out of town, hasn't he?"</p>

  <p>Diana nodded.</p>

  <p>"For any length of time?"</p>

  <p>"For a week," said Diana.</p>

  <p>Superbus rubbed his chin.</p>

  <p>"It's rather a delicate matter, but I am a family man, ma'am&mdash;miss.
  Has he gone away on business&mdash;no chance of a&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Of a what?"</p>

  <p>"Of a lure?"</p>

  <p>Diana laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely no chance." Diana was thinking quickly. "What sort of a woman
  would this be&mdash;his confederate, I mean&mdash;pretty?"</p>

  <p>"Handsome is as handsome does," replied Julius.</p>

  <p>"Are you going, Bobbie?"</p>

  <p>Bobbie was following the detective from the room.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've got to see a man," he said a little incoherently.</p>

  <p>There was still time to catch Gordon, and he was resolved to take the
  risk.</p>

  <p>With Bobbie out of the way, the girl rang the bell, and, when Eleanor
  came, she found her mistress at the writing-table, blotting an envelope.</p>

  <p>"Put your hat on, Eleanor, and deliver this letter to the Marble Arch
  Hotel. Take a taxi."</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam," said Eleanor in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Ask to see Mr. Dempsi."</p>

  <p>Diana made an attempt to be unconcerned, and failed dismally.</p>

  <p>"If he kisses the letter, or anything like that&mdash;you mustn't be
  surprised. He is very impulsive: he might even kiss you," she added.</p>

  <p>Eleanor stiffened.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, miss?"</p>

  <p>"He won't mean anything by it." Diana was tremulously diplomatic. "He
  always kisses people when he sees them. I&mdash;I shouldn't be surprised if
  he kissed me when he calls&mdash;we're old friends, and people do that sort
  of thing in&mdash;in Australia."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, madam?" said Eleanor, her interest in the British Empire
  awakened.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid Mr. Selsbury wouldn't understand," Diana went on lightly. "Men
  are rather narrow. If you told him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I should never dream of telling Mr. Selsbury, madam," said Eleanor
  indignantly.</p>

  <p>The girl came in dressed before she went.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon. Miss Ford, but it has just occurred to me," she said
  hesitantly. "If this foreign gentleman should kiss me, might I be bold enough
  to ask you not to mention it to Trenter?"</p>

  <p>"You may rely on me, Eleanor," said Diana firmly. "We women must stand
  together."</p>

  <p>She watched the girl through the window till she was out of sight, then
  flopped back in her chair. The papers stood in a rack at her hand, unopened,
  unread. She reached out and found one, but there was no drama that could
  quite overshadow that which was being played out in her heart.</p>

  <p>She heard a tap and looked round. It was not at the door; it seemed to be
  at the stained-glass window. There was a little window square, level with the
  ledge, which could be opened and closed as a casement, and against this she
  saw the shadow of a head, and, with her heart thumping wildly, walked across
  the room.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Then came a voice that chilled her to the marrow.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know me, beloved?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dempsi!" she gasped. "You mustn't come here, really you mustn't!
  My&mdash;my Uncle Isaac isn't at home, and I can't receive you."</p>

  <p>With an effort of will she jerked open the window and looked down upon a
  bearded face and eyes that shone. A wide-brimmed sombrero at the back of his
  head; hanging from his shoulders, a long black cape. He might have stepped
  from an opera.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I can't see you now, really I can't! Won't you call next
  Wednesday week?"</p>

  <p>So that was Dempsi! She remembered dimly some resemblance to the bare-
  faced boy she had known. Perhaps that wild glitter of eye, that furious
  gesticulation.</p>

  <p>"Diana," he breathed, "I've come back from the grave to claim you!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, but not now," she said, in an agony of apprehension. "Go back
  to your grave till three o'clock. I'll see you then."</p>

  <p>The shadow disappeared. How had he got there? Curiosity. Opening the
  window an eighth of an inch, she saw him scaling the wall with an agility
  which would have been admirable in any other conditions. Slowly she walked up
  the stairs to her room, closed and locked the door behind her, and sat down
  heavily on her bed.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time her aunt had carefully loaded a shot-gun designed for
  this same Dempsi. Tears came into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Dear auntie!" she half-sobbed. "You understood men so well!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Gordon hesitated a little time before the mirror in his
bedroom at the
  hotel, the razor poised in his hand, his cheeks crisp with lather. There is
  no more solemn act undertaken by man than destruction of such facial
  landmarks (if the term be allowed) as are represented by cultivated hair.
  There is something so irrevocable, so tremendous in self-destruction of
  whiskers, that it is amazing so few great poets have utilised the theme.</p>

  <p>Setting his jaw, Gordon attacked with a firm hand, the bright blade
  flashed in the pale sunlight... the deed was done. Rubbing his face clean of
  lather, he gazed in surprise at the result. His appearance was wholly
  changed. It would not be extravagant to describe it as improved. Those two
  flickers of the razor had made him ten years younger.</p>

  <p>"Boyish!" exclaimed Gordon, neither in despair nor pleasure, yet with
  something of both emotions.</p>

  <p>Until then he had not seen the suit, that fashionable grey check with a
  little red in it. His first impression of the pattern had mellowed with
  time...</p>

  <p>"My God!" breathed Gordon.</p>

  <p>He was not a profane man. Once Diana had wrung from him such an
  expression, but Diana and her startling point of view was the mildest of
  provocation compared with the horror that lay unfolded on the bed.</p>

  <p>As a length of cloth it had called for attention. It was humanly
  impossible to pass it by without some such comment as "That is rather
  unusual." But in the piece it had dignity; there was a suggestion of weavers'
  genius and ingenuity.</p>

  <p>As a suit, embellished with a saucy waist, and with buttons that were in
  themselves a quiet smile... Gordon felt a trickle of something at his temples
  and requisitioned his handkerchief. He could not possibly wear this. The
  alternative, for a short sea voyage, was a black morning coat and top
  hat&mdash;equally impossible.</p>

  <p>Time was flying. He put on the trousers. They did not look so bad... he
  dressed.</p>

  <p>Standing before the long glass in the wardrobe, he looked and wondered.
  One thing was certain: not his dearest friend would recognise him&mdash;and
  his overcoat would hide much. The reflection of this new Gordon Selsbury
  fascinated him.</p>

  <p>"How do you do?" he asked politely.</p>

  <p>The figure in the mirror bowed gravely. He was a perfect stranger to
  Gordon, a young bookmaker, Gordon thought, and was growing interested when he
  realised with a shock that it was himself. Packing hastily, he rang the bell
  three times for the valet. If you rang twice the porter came, once, the
  chambermaid. So he rang three times. The chambermaid appeared. Happily the
  hotel is a house of call. Guests come overnight and leave in the morning.
  Nobody recognises anybody except under the urgent promptings of lawyers'
  clerks, supported by the visitors' book. Ten per cent. of the staff was
  permanently giving evidence at the law courts.</p>

  <p>"The valet," said Gordon and, when that individual appeared, gave
  instructions regarding the grip containing his discarded suit and hat-box. It
  occurred to him at that moment that one does not journey to Scotland in a top
  hat, and he was rather glad that Diana had been out when he left.</p>

  <p>"I want these things to be kept in the hotel cloak-room," said Gordon. "I
  will be back next Friday night and collect them."</p>

  <p>Now the valet knew him; had seen him, not at the hotel, but at a very
  select club in Pall Mall where the man had been a waiter before the craze for
  improvement had driven him to the brushing of odd people's odder
  clothing.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir, you're Mr. Selsbury, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>Gordon went red.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am Mr. Selsbury," he said with a touch of hauteur. His signature
  in the visitors' book was unintelligible. The reception clerk thought it was
  Silsburg.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I should leave your bag in the hotel, sir," said the valet
  gravely.</p>

  <p>Something of authority upon the ritual of adventure, he spoke with the
  best of intentions.</p>

  <p>"Next Friday particularly we've got a big dinner here&mdash;to one of the
  Colonial Premiers. The hotel will be full of people&mdash;you don't want to
  meet anybody you know?"</p>

  <p>The assumption that he was privy to the clandestine character of Gordon's
  movements made the visitor incapable of protest.</p>

  <p>"Tell me the train you're coming by; I'll meet you at the station with the
  grip&mdash;I'll put it straight away into the railway parcels office," said
  the valet gently, almost tenderly.</p>

  <p>Gordon could think of no improvement on this method; at the same time, the
  valet must be under no misapprehension.</p>

  <p>"Thank you&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Balding&mdash;I used to be a waiter at the Junior University Club,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course. I think your idea is an excellent one. The fact is, I'm
  leaving London on a... mission, and I have to be very careful... thousands of
  pounds are involved."</p>

  <p>"I see, sir."</p>

  <p>Balding was so serious as to be almost plaintive. He had met gentlemen at
  the hotel in similar circumstances, only they had said that they were in the
  secret service.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir... very kind of you, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>Balding slipped the note into his waistcoat pocket indifferently.</p>

  <p>"I'll take this now, sir." He lifted the grip from the bed. "Will you be
  coming by the first or the second continental on Friday? Ostend four-thirty,
  Paris eight-thirty."</p>

  <p>"Four-thirty," said Gordon.</p>

  <p>The die was cast. He gathered the second and smaller grip, paid his bill
  at the desk and went out.</p>

  <p>It was chiming the quarter before eleven when he entered Victoria Station;
  the train left at twelve. There was no need to rush for seats. He had his
  Pullman reservation in his pocket. Happily the day was raw, the sun and rain
  alternately, blustering wind all the time. He could turn up the collar of his
  greatcoat. On the indicator board he read:</p>

  <p>"Wind N N.W. Sea moderate to rough. Visibility good."</p>

  <p>He was glad, at any rate, that the visibility was good.</p>

  <p>And then he looked around for Heloise. They had arranged to meet for the
  briefest space of time.</p>

  <p>At ten minutes to eleven, he grew restive, was on the point of picking up
  his valise, when he saw her hurrying toward him, glancing furtively behind.
  And there was something in her face that made his breath come a little more
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"Follow me into the waiting-room!"</p>

  <p>She had passed him with this muttered message. Like a man in a dream,
  Gordon picked up his bag and followed. The big waiting-hall was nearly empty,
  and to its emptiest corner she led him.</p>

  <p>"Gordon, a dreadful thing has happened." Her agitation communicated itself
  to his unquiet bosom. "My husband has returned unexpectedly from Kongo. He is
  following me... he is mad&mdash;mad! Oh, Gordon, what have I done!"</p>

  <p>He did not swoon; rather, he experienced all the sensations without losing
  consciousness.</p>

  <p>"He swears I have transferred my affections, and says he will never rest
  until he stretches the man dead at my feet. He said he would do dreadful
  things... he is a great admirer of Peter the Great."</p>

  <p>"Is he?" said Gordon. It seemed a futile question to ask, but he could
  think of nothing else. And he was not a little bit interested in Mr. van
  Oynne's historical leanings.</p>

  <p>"Gordon, you must go on to Ostend and wait for me," she said rapidly. "I
  will come as soon as possible... oh, my dear, you don't know how I'm
  feeling!"</p>

  <p>Gordon was so immensely absorbed in his own feelings that he made no
  effort of imagination.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you tell him that our... our friendship was just... spiritual?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Her smile was faint and sad and shadowy. A ghost who had overheard a good
  one in a smoking-room might have laughed as hilariously.</p>

  <p>"My dear... who would believe that? Now hurry, I must go."</p>

  <p>Her little hand trembled for a second on his arm and she was gone.</p>

  <p>He picked up his bag: it was curiously heavy: and followed her into the
  station. She was nowhere in sight. A porter stretched a suggestive hand
  toward his baggage.</p>

  <p>"Continental train, sir... have you got a seat?"</p>

  <p>Gordon looked up at the clock. It wanted five minutes of eleven.</p>

  <p>"Eleven-five the boat train, sir," said the porter.</p>

  <p>"Eleven-five? I thought it was eleven," said Gordon numbly.</p>

  <p>"There's plenty of time, sir."</p>

  <p>Still Gordon stood, motionless. For some extraordinary reason his mind had
  refused to function; he was wholly incapable of decision or movement. The
  engine of his faculties had gone cold and refused to start.</p>

  <p>"Get me a cab, please."</p>

  <p>The mechanism of the request saved him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>The bag was taken from his unresisting hand. He followed the porter to the
  busy courtyard, pathetic in his helplessness.</p>

  <p>"Where shall I tell him to go, sir?"</p>

  <p>The porter stood invitingly, the cab door in his hand, a friendly smile on
  his face. He had not yet been tipped.</p>

  <p>"Scotland," said Gordon hollowly.</p>

  <p>"Scotland&mdash;you mean Scotland Yard?"</p>

  <p>This touched the spring: all the wheels in Mr. Selsbury's mind began
  revolving at once.</p>

  <p>"No, no&mdash;to the Grovely Hotel. Thank you very much."</p>

  <p>The gratuity that Gordon crushed into the outstretched hand was
  munificent, princely. One glance at its value and the porter staggered
  against the door, closed it with a strangled "Grovely!" and the cab rattled
  out of the station precincts.</p>

  <p>At that moment Bobbie Selsbury was engaged in a frenzied seat-to-seat
  search for his erring brother.</p>

  <p>Gordon was cooler now, though not out of danger. He could think: he could
  also for the moment inhibit thought. A jealous and revengeful husband,
  probably armed, certainly homicidal, and a student of Peter the Great and his
  methods, could not be wholly inhibited. Gordon wondered whether in his
  library he had a really frank and unexpurgated history of Peter.</p>

  <p>The hotel linkman opened the door of the cab, professionally pleased at
  his return.</p>

  <p>"Keep the cab," warned Gordon. He was by no means certain that he was
  capable, unaided, of calling another.</p>

  <p>At the desk of the reception clerk he recovered his key and the right to
  its employment, and carrying his bag to his room, rang the bell three times
  for the valet. The porter answered him, but not by mischance, as was
  proved.</p>

  <p>"Balding is off duty, sir," he explained. "He goes off at eleven on
  Saturdays."</p>

  <p>"When will he be back?"</p>

  <p>"On Monday, sir. We have a whole day every second week. Is there anything
  I can get you, sir?"</p>

  <p>Gordon shook his head. He only wanted his bag and his lost respectability.
  Removing his overcoat, he looked at himself in the glass.</p>

  <p>"That isn't me," he said brokenly.</p>

  <p>His appearance had changed, even in the short space of time elapsing
  between this and his last inspection.</p>

  <p>The type was hideously familiar. He had seen it once in a vulgar film
  where everybody chased everybody else. He remembered that the heroine wore
  white stockings and black boots.</p>

  <p>There were two alternatives. He might remain a prisoner in that room until
  Balding returned from his holiday; he could go home, get into the house
  unobserved and change. He had many black-tailed coats, batteries of silk
  hats, forests of quiet, grey-striped trousers. This idea was more attractive.
  Diana would lunch at one o'clock; the dining-room was across the hall from
  The Study. It would be a simple matter to slip upstairs, change and come down
  to meet the astonished eyes of Diana. How surprised she would be, and how
  amusing and unbending he would be!</p>

  <p>"Didn't expect to see me, eh? Well, the fact is, I had an important
  cablegram&mdash;just as I was getting into the train. My side-whiskers? Yes,
  I took them off as a little surprise for you. Rather an improvement, don't
  you think?"</p>

  <p>His heart warmed to the plan, and there was a glow in the thought that the
  desire of the morning, that he should sleep in his own bed that night, would
  be gratified. And there was the companionship of Diana, hitherto an
  unconsidered attraction. Diana grew on him: he admitted this to himself. If
  Heloise did go after him to Ostend, that would be unfortunate. He hated the
  idea of giving her a journey for nothing. But she would not leave for a day
  or two, and he would find means of communicating with her...</p>

  <p>He shuddered; for at the back of the vision of Heloise, stood the large,
  brutal husband who was mad, mad.</p>

  <p>There were two hours to wait before he could put his plan into operation.
  He telephoned from his bedroom to a bookseller's in the Buckingham Palace
  Road.</p>

  <p>"Have you a good life of Peter the Great?" he asked.</p>

  <p>They had two. He ordered them to be sent to him immediately. He was rather
  amused with himself.</p>

  <p>He was less amused when he heard of the fate of one who had aspired to the
  affections of Catherine, and whose head had been placed into a large glass
  jar and displayed in Catherine's boudoir to remind her that husbands have
  their feelings. There was another gentleman who loved Catherine, and him
  Peter had hanged on a high gibbet, under which he promenaded arm in arm with
  Catherine. The arm and arm was a domestic touch not lost upon Gordon. On the
  whole, he decided thoughtfully, a profound admiration for Peter's character
  would have no softening tendency upon any man, especially a man who was mad,
  mad.</p>

  <p>He put away his book, drew on his overcoat, and, passing down in the
  elevator, found his cab still waiting, the meter bloated with charges. He had
  forgotten all about the cab.</p>

  <p>At the corner of the street he paid the man and walked rapidly into
  Cheynel Gardens, his nose showing above the collar of his overcoat. Happily,
  the street was empty. He almost ran when he reached the familiar facade of
  his house, turned into the side passage, and, with a trembling hand, fitted
  the key into the lock of the back gate. Suppose it were bolted? The horrid
  doubt was no sooner in his mind than it was dispelled. The key turned easily,
  and he found himself looking up at the familiar window of his study.</p>

  <p>Tiptoeing to the little door, he listened. There was no sound, and, with
  minute care to avoid making the slightest noise, he pushed his pass-key
  slowly in the lock, and pushed the door open a fraction of an inch. Not a
  sound. He opened it a little further, slipped behind the curtain which hid
  the door, and closed it behind him.</p>

  <p>The room was empty, the two doors into the hall ajar. He could hear the
  solemn ticking of the grandfather clock on the staircase.</p>

  <p>His first step, he had decided, must be to get into touch with Bobbie.
  Listening at the hall door, he heard the click of steel on china&mdash;Diana
  was at lunch, as he had expected. He closed first the baize, and then the
  inner door softly, shot a bolt and tiptoed across the room. Bless Diana for
  bringing the telephone into The Study!</p>

  <p>Bobbie's office responded. A late leaving clerk had heard the ring of the
  'phone and came back to answer.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, Mr. Selsbury is not in to-day."</p>

  <p>Gordon rang off without disclosing his identity, and tried Bobbie's
  lodgings in Half Moon Street, with no better success. He was wasting valuable
  time, he realised, and Bobbie could wait. He put on the receiver and stood
  up, stretching himself, with an easy, happy, home-coming smile. Yes, Diana
  would be surprised.</p>

  <p>He crossed the room to the hall. His hand was on the handle when, glancing
  round, he saw the curtain which hid the door into the courtyard move and
  billow. He had left the door open, he thought, and was on the point of
  returning to close it, when a hand came round the edge of the curtain, and he
  stood, frozen to the spot. Again the draperies moved, and a woman came into
  view. It was Heloise!</p>

  <p>Gordon did not believe the evidence of his eyes. She was some vision
  conjured up by an overheated brain, a symptom of disordered nerves.</p>

  <p>"You are not real," he said dully. "Avaunt!"</p>

  <p>"Gordon!"</p>

  <p>The outstretched hands, the plea in her eyes. Gordon Selsbury stood with
  his back to the door.</p>

  <p>"How did you come here?" he croaked.</p>

  <p>"Through the garden gate&mdash;the way you came... I followed you. Gordon,
  he is furious! You must protect me."</p>

  <p>He could only stare at her owlishly.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;Peter?" he nodded.</p>

  <p>"Peter? No, my husband, Claude. He knows everything!" dramatically.</p>

  <p>"Is he... an editor?"</p>

  <p>He was talking foolishly: nobody knew that better than Gordon; but the
  works were beginning to slow down again. And then she came to him and dropped
  both her hands on his arm.</p>

  <p>"You want me to stay here, don't you? You won't turn me out....? He
  followed me, but I slipped him."</p>

  <p>"Stay here?" Gordon hardly recognised his own voice. "Are you mad?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Are you married?"</p>

  <p>"No." And then a flashing inspiration. "Yes."</p>

  <p>"Yes-no," she said impatiently. "What are you&mdash;divorced?"</p>

  <p>"No. You see how absurd it is, Heloise."</p>

  <p>"You are married to Diana." She pointed an accusing finger.</p>

  <p>Gordon could only nod idiotically.</p>

  <p>"You really must go," he squeaked. "This may mean ruin for me!"</p>

  <p>Her lips curled as she drew back, hands on hips.</p>

  <p>"Do I get any of that ruin?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"You must go back to your husband." His brain was alert now. "Tell him you
  have made a mistake&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He pretty well guesses that," she interrupted bitterly, and slowly took
  off her wrap.</p>

  <p>Instantly Gordon seized it.</p>

  <p>"Put it on, put it on!" he wailed, but she twisted herself loose.</p>

  <p>"I will not go, I will not! Oh, Gordon, you can't turn me out after all
  we've been to one another! After all the confidences!"</p>

  <p>He was pushing her toward the courtyard door, a man beside himself,
  frenzied with fear, terrified beyond hope of succour.</p>

  <p>"Out of the side door!" he hissed. "I will meet you in half an hour, at a
  teashop somewhere. Heloise, don't you realise my reputation
  depends&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It needed but this to pull the mask from her face.</p>

  <p>"Teashop! I am to be thrown to the lions!"</p>

  <p>He looked hard at her. Could a woman pun in such a solemn moment?</p>

  <p>"As to your reputation," she drawled coolly, "that sort of thing doesn't
  make me get out of bed and walk round, I assure you! I will not leave this
  house&mdash;alone!"</p>

  <p>Gordon covered his mouth with his hand. He was in no danger of talking. He
  wanted to cover her mouth with his hand, but she was too far away. It was an
  involuntary gesture which silenced her. She heard the knock at the door, and
  then Diana's voice:</p>

  <p>"Who is there?"</p>

  <p>He pointed to the side door, grimacing. Heloise was adamant.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" said Diana.</p>

  <p>"Side door," whispered Gordon frantically.</p>

  <p>Heloise shook her head, hesitated, and then stole silently behind the
  curtain into the recess. It was her final compromise.</p>

  <p>"Who is there? Who locked the door?"</p>

  <p>Diana's voice was urgent. Gordon straightened his coat, smoothed his hair,
  unlocked the door and threw it wide open.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, dear." He was grinning inanely like a cat. "Ha
  ha&mdash;it's only Gordon&mdash;Gord, as you would say! I'm just coming
  out... here I am back again ... like a bad penny."</p>

  <p>In Diana's eyes was a glitter which he did not like, and as she advanced
  he backed instantly before her.</p>

  <p>"Only old Gordon&mdash;ha ha!" he said feebly.</p>

  <p>"Very funny. I'll laugh to-morrow," said Diana.</p>

  <p>The vulgarity of the ancient music-hall gag did not even arouse him.</p>

  <p>"So it's only old Gordon, is it?" She nodded wisely. "Sit over
  there&mdash;old Gordon!" She pointed to a chair.</p>

  <p>"Now look here, my dear girl." It was a very colourless imitation of his
  best manner. "The whole thing can be explained. I lost my train...."</p>

  <p>She was opening a drawer in the writing table, slowly, deliberately, her
  eyes never leaving his face. When her hand came to view, it held a
  Browning.</p>

  <p>Click! The jacket snapped back. It was loaded.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing, Diana?" he squeaked again.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were now murderous.</p>

  <p>"Will you be good enough not to call me Diana?" she asked icily. "So
  you've come, have you? And even I, who expect most things, didn't expect you.
  But, my friend, you've come at an opportune hour!"</p>

  <p>"Look here, old girl&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"You can omit the familiarities." She waved him down to his chair. "Never
  imagine that you will deceive me&mdash;I know you!"</p>

  <p>"You know me?" he said hoarsely. He had come to a point where he wasn't
  quite certain whether he knew himself.</p>

  <p>"I know you," she repeated slowly. "You're Double Dan!"</p>

  <p>He leapt to his feet, the pistol covering him. Waving wild hands, he
  strove to speak.</p>

  <p>"You're Double Dan," she said, and the fire in her eyes was now ominous.
  "I've heard about you. You're the impersonator. You and your woman
  confederate lure innocent men from their homes, that you can rob them." She
  looked round. "Where is the woman? Doesn't she appear on the scene, or does
  her work finish when the luring is completed?"</p>

  <p>"Diana, I swear to you you're mistaken. I'm Gordon, your cousin."</p>

  <p>She smiled slowly.</p>

  <p>"You haven't been as careful as usual, Dan. And the fact that I call you
  by your Christian name need not inspire you with a desire to get better
  acquainted. You haven't studied him. My cousin, Gordon Selsbury, had little
  side-whiskers&mdash;didn't you know that?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I had an accident. In fact," said Gordon, "I took them off... to
  please you."</p>

  <p>Her sneering smile chilled him through and through.</p>

  <p>"My cousin Gordon is not the kind of man who would have an accident with
  his whiskers," she said with cold deliberation. "Where is your lady
  friend?"</p>

  <p>He tried to look away from the curtained recess, stared solemnly ahead of
  him, but involuntarily his eyes strayed to the garden door. And then Diana
  saw the slightest of movements.</p>

  <p>"Come out, please," she said.</p>

  <p>There was no response.</p>

  <p>"Come out, or I'll shoot!"</p>

  <p>The curtain grew agitated. Heloise, white of face, flew across the room,
  flinging herself upon Gordon's heaving bosom.</p>

  <p>"Don't let her shoot me! Don't let her shoot me!" she shrieked.</p>

  <p>Diana looked and nodded.</p>

  <p>"So this man is your husband!" she said.</p>

  <p>Walking back to the door, she closed it.</p>

  <p>"Now listen to me, Double Dan and Mrs. Double Dan, or whatever your names
  may be. You are here to commit a felony, and I could, if I wished, send for
  the police and hand you over to justice. I'm not sure that I shan't take that
  course. For the moment, however, your presence is providential."</p>

  <p>And then, in scorn:</p>

  <p>"Gordon Selsbury! Do you imagine Gordon Selsbury would bring a woman to
  this house furtively? Do you imagine he would come dressed like a third-class
  comedian? Never dare mention Mr. Selsbury's name again in my presence!"</p>

  <p>Gordon opened and closed his mouth, but no words came.</p>

  <p>"You will stay here until I give you permission to go."</p>

  <p>She went to the garden gate, closed and slammed it, then came back to
  Gordon.</p>

  <p>"You had a key? Give it to me," she said curtly.</p>

  <p>Gordon obeyed, lamb-like, watching her as she double-locked the door. And
  then he made his last desperate attempt.</p>

  <p>"Diana, I can explain everything," he said hoarsely. "I am&mdash;the fact
  is&mdash;I'll tell you the truth. I was going abroad, and the fact is, I am
  Gordon, although I may not seem so. I admit I'm wearing the most disgustingly
  loud suit, and that I have in other ways changed my appearance, but that also
  can be explained."</p>

  <p>There was a knock on the panel of the door.</p>

  <p>"Wait," said Diana, and walked backward to the entrance. "Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"Eleanor, madam. A telegram."</p>

  <p>"Push it under the door."</p>

  <p>An orange envelope came into sight, and, picking it up, she tore away the
  cover and read the form.</p>

  <p>"Go on," she signalled to Gordon. "You say you are Gordon Selsbury? Tell
  me some more. But before you do so, listen to this:</p>

  <p>"'Just leaving Euston. Take care of yourself. Gordon.'</p>

  <p>"Now there need be no deception on either side. Open your heart to me,
  little man. Who are you&mdash;Gordon Selsbury or Double Dan?"</p>

  <p>"Anything!" The wail of the damned.</p>

  <p>"Gordon Selsbury or Double Dan?" she demanded inexorably.</p>

  <p>He threw out his hands. "Double Dan," snarled Gordon. Of the two
  alternative roles, this seemed the more creditable.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">He had never seen anybody as scared as Heloise was; that
was the one clear
  impression which Gordon carried away from the interview. She, the self-
  possessed woman of the world, a soul, one superior to the lesser grades of
  humanity, seemed to have cowered and shrunk under the domination of Diana's
  baleful eye. Gordon sighed, tied his baize apron a little tighter round his
  waist, and wondered where Trenter kept his stock of plate powder. On the
  whole, it was good that Trenter was away, and that he was spared the sight of
  his master's humiliation. If indeed it was a humiliation to be thrust into an
  ill- lit pantry with instructions to clean the silver, and be ready at a
  moment's notice to make himself presentable. Gordon tried again and attacked
  a cream-jug half-heartedly. His hands were not designed for housework. Yet he
  would as soon have thought of cutting his throat with a fruit knife
  (half-a-dozen of which awaited his attention) as disobey Diana's imperious
  gesture which had sent him off to the pantry to clean silver.</p>

  <p>He was not asleep; he had made absolutely certain of this; he was wide
  awake, in his shirt sleeves, a baize apron covering his detestable suit, and
  he was polishing a cream, or it may have been a milk jug. That fact being
  firmly and inevitably established, he had some basis for reasoning and
  wonder. Chief cause for wonder was why Diana kept him in the house at all,
  believing him to be Double Dan; why she did not send immediately for the
  police and have him taken off to the nearest lock-up. He was devoutly
  thankful that she hadn't! The second cause for wonder was what had happened
  to the remainder of the domestic staff? Eleanor he had not seen. There was no
  evidence that the cook was on the premises. Here again this fact provided him
  with a certain amount of satisfaction&mdash;but where were they? He was to
  learn.</p>

  <p>Diana made her appearance at the door of the pantry and he stared at her
  open- mouthed. Around her dainty waist was a broad leather belt, and, hanging
  by two straps, was a pistol holster, from the opening of which protruded the
  black handle of a Browning.</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything about potatoes?" she asked curtly.</p>

  <p>Gordon was ashamed to discover that he knew nothing about potatoes, except
  that they were vegetables.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever peeled potatoes?"</p>

  <p>"I can't remember," he said. "When I was at school I think we used to peel
  potatoes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not interested in what happened at Borstal&mdash;that is the name of
  the juvenile convict establishment, isn't it? Put that milk-jug down and come
  into the kitchen."</p>

  <p>He followed her meekly. There was no sign of the cook; Eleanor was
  invisible, and he learnt the reason.</p>

  <p>"I've sent my servants away for a week-end holiday," she said. "I want no
  scandal attaching to my cousin's name. I will not even have it known that
  this attempt has been made to swindle him. You understand that you will not
  try to leave the house?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he nodded.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, it is impossible that I should keep up day and night watching
  you," she said, "so I have asked a friend to come in and help me."</p>

  <p>A gleam of hope showed in Gordon's eyes.</p>

  <p>"A detective," she said impressively, "a Mr. Superbus&mdash;a name, I
  think with which you are well acquainted."</p>

  <p>"That... that....?" spluttered Gordon indignantly.</p>

  <p>"That," she said.</p>

  <p>A bell shrilled in the kitchen. She looked up at the indicator. The little
  disc which represented the front door was oscillating violently.</p>

  <p>"There are the potatoes," she pointed to them.</p>

  <p>Gordon saluted. He was once in the army and it seemed natural to
  salute.</p>

  <p>No sooner had she gone than he decided upon his course of action. He was
  well enough acquainted with the house to know that there was a kitchen door
  and for this he made. It was locked; the key had been taken away; the windows
  of scullery and kitchen were heavily barred against burglars. Gordon returned
  to his potatoes with a sigh. He sighed easily in these hours.</p>

  <p>Again the bell rang. Diana heard it as she unbuckled the strap of her
  revolver belt, and put away the weapon into the hall cupboard. She hesitated
  a second with her hand on the doorknob, and then the thunderous rat-tat
  forced her to action. She opened the door. The moment had come. Before she
  saw the bearded gentleman she knew he was there.</p>

  <p>"Three o'clock!" he cried exultantly, and threw out both his hands. "Three
  o'clock, my bride, my dove, my life!"</p>

  <p>"Come in," said Diana practically.</p>

  <p>He would have taken her in his arms, but she held him at a distance.</p>

  <p>"The servants," she said and swiftly eluded his embracing arms.</p>

  <p>"In here," she opened The study door. "Giuseppe, you must behave&mdash;you
  really must. My uncle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your uncle!" He gazed at her ecstatically.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"In this house?"</p>

  <p>She ought to have been warned by his fervour, but the immediate
  necessities of the moment threw her off her balance.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course he's here," she said.</p>

  <p>"Your uncle is here!" There was triumph in his tone, his wild eyes fixed
  her.</p>

  <p>"Why... why yes, Giuseppe," she faltered and he closed his eyes in a rapt
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Then the dream of my life is to be fulfilled. Your telephone&mdash;I may
  use it, yes?"</p>

  <p>He was at the telephone before she could say yes or no. She heard him give
  a number, his hotel, and then:</p>

  <p>"You will have my bags sent here at once, to Cheynel Gardens, yes? Two
  bags, do you not understand English? My grip, bags, send them to this place.
  What is the name, Cheynel? Yes, that is it, Cheynel Gardens, Number 61. You
  cannot mistake it. My pyjamas you will not forget. They are under my
  pillow."</p>

  <p>"Giuseppe!" she gasped. "What are you doing? Wait! You can't stay
  here!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, here, under your roof. The glory of it! It is wonderful, a
  fulfilment of dreams, oh my starry vision! Without your good uncle it was
  impossible. You have a new aunt? Ah, the poor Mrs. Tetherby! It was comical,
  to me tragic, yet this moment comical again!"</p>

  <p>"But Giuseppe," she wailed, "you can't stay. My uncle doesn't like people
  staying in the house...."</p>

  <p>He patted her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"We shall charm him. We shall overcome his objections! Tell me his hobby,
  I will speak about it. There is no subject under the sun on which I cannot
  speak."</p>

  <p>This she believed.</p>

  <p>"Your aunt! To me your aunt! Bring her at once that I may shake her hand
  and kiss her on both cheeks. The aunt of Diana! Oh divine relationship!"</p>

  <p>In a dazed kind of way Diana realized that the Italian side of Mr. Dempsi
  had developed to an enormous and unbearable extent. He could not keep still
  for a moment. Now he was at the fireplace, examining the crossed oars.</p>

  <p>"You have learnt to row, my little Diana? That is wonderful! We shall row
  together upon the stream of Time, drinking the waters of Lethe and forgetting
  the past."</p>

  <p>In two strides he had reached her, gripping both her hands in his.</p>

  <p>"Diana, do you realise how I have dreamt of all this, through the long
  nights in the bush, in the waste places of the Northern Territories, where I
  wandered seeking gold and forgetfulness and finding neither? In the silence
  of the native hut, broken by the little birds' twittering in the darkness,
  and no other sound but the sighing of the wind&mdash;your face was there!
  Your exquisite memorable features, the glory of your hair, your eyes that
  smiled and tormented..."</p>

  <p>He broke off abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Your uncle... produce him..."</p>

  <p>Gordon had peeled his third potato when Diana staggered into the kitchen.
  They were big potatoes when he started to deal with them. They were very
  small when he had finished. It was difficult to know where the skin began and
  ended; he had cut deep to make sure.</p>

  <p>At the sight of her tragic face he dropped his potato.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Wrong? Everything's wrong!" she said bitterly. "I'm going to give you
  your chance. I don't like your name, Dan, and I've changed it. You're
  Isaac!"</p>

  <p>"Who!" he twittered.</p>

  <p>"You're Isaac, my uncle Isaac!"</p>

  <p>He put down the knife, wiped his hands on his apron and went slowly across
  to her.</p>

  <p>"I am not your uncle Isaac," he began.</p>

  <p>"Take off that!" she pointed to the apron. "Put on your coat and come
  upstairs. Remember, you're uncle Isaac and that terrible female&mdash;where
  is she?"</p>

  <p>"How the dickens do I know where she is?" asked the annoyed Gordon.</p>

  <p>"Wait!"</p>

  <p>Diana flew up the stairs to the top of the house and in the spare room
  where she had intended putting the hired man and wife, she found Heloise
  sitting disconsolately on the edge of the bed, a suspicious wetness about her
  eyes. When the door was unlocked and flung open, the woman jumped up.</p>

  <p>"Now, see here, Mrs. Selsbury," she began in her high voice, "I don't know
  the law of this country but you've no right to lock me in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to send for the police?" asked Diana, calm but
  menacing.</p>

  <p>"I tell you you're all wrong, Mrs. Selsbury," said Heloise with great
  earnestness. "You've made the biggest mistake of your life. That poor fish is
  your husband."</p>

  <p>"I have no husband&mdash;fish, flesh, fowl or herring," said Diana. "I
  never had a husband," and then remembering, "I am a widow."</p>

  <p>Heloise was momentarily staggered.</p>

  <p>"You can forget all that has happened to-day," said Diana speaking a
  little wildly. "A visitor has come&mdash;he is staying in the house... an old
  friend of mine... in fact, I was once engaged to him until he died in the
  bush."</p>

  <p>"Is he here?" asked the startled Heloise.</p>

  <p>"He is here," nodded Diana, "and he is remaining. Obviously, I cannot
  allow him to stay unless I have a chaperone. You are," she spoke
  deliberately, "Aunt Lizzie."</p>

  <p>Heloise could only look at her.</p>

  <p>"You're Aunt Lizzie and your wretched criminal husband, or whatever he is
  (I can only hope for the best) is Uncle Isaac. Go right down into the kitchen
  and tell him."</p>

  <p>"Let me get this right," said Heloise slowly. "I am Aunt Lizzie... you
  want me to be your Aunt Lizzie... and that poor child is to be...?"</p>

  <p>"Uncle Isaac."</p>

  <p>"I haven't gotten it right yet," said Heloise, "this is a cinema lot...
  you're playing somep'n," she had forgotten momentarily that she was a lady of
  fashion and culture. "I'm Aunt Lizzie..."</p>

  <p>She sank under the burden that had been imposed upon her.</p>

  <p>"You're all crazy, that's what. I'm an American citizen, or near
  American... Toronto, but I live so close that I could throw a stone across
  the border. And I'm Aunt Lizzie!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Gordon was playing absently with potato peelings when she
came in.</p>

  <p>"You're Uncle Isaac!" she said in a strained, hazy fashion.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been, Heloise?"</p>

  <p>The sight of his companion in misfortune brought him with a jerk to
  normal. Heloise was real, something to cling to; he forgot his resentment in
  the joy of seeing something that anchored him to Gordon Selsbury.</p>

  <p>"Say Gordon, that Jane... she's Diana, huh?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Your wife, you never told me that?"</p>

  <p>"She is not my wife... she has no right here... if I gave you cause to
  think I was married it was because I wanted you to go. Don't you see what
  you've done? You've ruined me! If you had only kept away&mdash;if you had
  only kept away!" he moaned.</p>

  <p>"She's your widow," she was very quiet and restrained. He decided that she
  had lost her reason.</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you like, she's my widow," he said soothingly. "Sit down... I
  will get you a glass of water."</p>

  <p>"Diana!" said Heloise in wonder. "That's your little Australian girl...
  Gordon, was she a cop?"</p>

  <p>"A what?"</p>

  <p>"A headquarters woman! She's got the style. Come on."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"She wants us..." said Heloise listlessly. "What's the good of fighting,
  Gordon? We're entangled in the mesh of circumstance."</p>

  <p>It was a favourite profundity of Heloise; he had heard her say it many
  times. But they were not entangled then.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later.</p>

  <p>A small brown-faced man was shaking Gordon by the hand, by both hands, by
  alternate hands. In the interval of shaking, he held hands.</p>

  <p>"Your uncle... and so young! And yet, he is older than he seems! And this
  is Aunt Lizzie!"</p>

  <p>He kissed the patient Heloise on both cheeks.</p>

  <p>Gordon was a dumbfounded spectator. Who was this infernal little cad, he
  demanded&mdash;Diana had omitted an introduction.</p>

  <p>After a while it came.</p>

  <p>"This, Uncle Isaac, is Mr. Giuseppe Dempsi&mdash;you remember how often I
  have spoken of him."</p>

  <p>Her steely glance was unnecessary. Gordon remembered.</p>

  <p>"I thought he was dead." So intense were his feelings that his voice
  dropped to a deep base.</p>

  <p>It startled even himself.</p>

  <p>"But I am alive! Rejoice, Uncle Isaac! Your little Wopsy is alive! I have
  come back from the shades! A syren's sweet magic brought me across the world,
  yea, even through the shadows..."</p>

  <p>He pointed with his whole hand to Diana and then.</p>

  <p>"My bride!" he said tremendously.</p>

  <p>Gordon looked from one to the other. "Dempsi... bride... bride
  Dempsi..."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly ridiculous," said Gordon and quailed under a fiendish glare
  from Diana.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Dempsi was too happy to find anything in the interruption but a
  piece of rare good humour.</p>

  <p>"We will have long talks, you and my uncle!" he said and beamed round on
  his hostess. "Tell me, little one, have I changed? Ah, but I was a boy then,
  a weak, vacillating ignorant boy. I did not realize that to win a woman she
  must be carried off her feet. To whine and wail for her, that is no good; to
  be diffident and timid&mdash;that is no good. To sigh at her feet bores her,
  to be humble arouses the greatest contempt... women desire in men the grand
  manner, biff, bang, boff!"</p>

  <p>"Uncle has to go now to... to feed the chickens," said Diana
  hurriedly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Giuseppe Dempsi must neither biff, bang nor boff at 61 Cheynel
  Gardens. Dismayed she realized how broken were the reeds on which she had
  leant. They also were to know. She came into the kitchen after them.</p>

  <p>"You're no good, either of you," she was in despair. "I suppose you're
  good crooks, but that is because you haven't the brains to be anything else.
  You stood like wax figures from the Chamber of Horrors and did nothing!"</p>

  <p>"What were we supposed to do?" Gordon was stung into enquiring. "If I'd
  done what I wanted to do, I'd have thrown the little wop into the street! But
  you're master here. You won't accept a perfectly simple
  explanation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your perfectly simple explanation doesn't go with Aunt Lizzie," she
  stopped him in her most imperial manner. "You might have deceived me but for
  that&mdash;be sensible, man. I know you're Double Dan. I want to use you if I
  can&mdash;if I can't I'll send for the police. I'm expecting Mr. Superbus at
  any moment&mdash;you will be under his eye; try to conduct yourself as an
  uncle would."</p>

  <p>Gordon writhed.</p>

  <p>"How can I behave like an uncle when you're setting an infernal bottle-
  nosed enquiry agent to watch me?" demanded Gordon hotly. "It is no crime to
  be an uncle, my good girl! You can't say 'Watch that man, he's my Uncle
  Isaac!' By your standard of ethics, an uncle may be a suspicious
  circumstance, but in this country it isn't... what excuse can you give?"</p>

  <p>Her lips curled.</p>

  <p>"I can say that you are weak-minded," she said, cold-bloodedly, "and that
  is just what I am going to say!"</p>

  <p>Gordon leant against the table for support.</p>

  <p>"I'm not weak-minded," he protested.</p>

  <p>They waited until the sound of Diana's footsteps had died away.</p>

  <p>"This comes of trips to Ostend," said Mr. Selsbury with a catch in his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"If you'd gone to Ostend that couldn't have happened," said Heloise
  fiercely. "Does it occur to you that my husband has followed us and is at
  this moment sitting on the doorstep waiting to free your poor spirit from
  this earthly bondage?"</p>

  <p>Gordon passed his hand wearily over his forehead. He was in the depths of
  despondency.</p>

  <p>"I don't care," he said. "I don't care about your husband. He's probably a
  sensible man to whom one could explain things. Diana is so infernally sure of
  herself that you can't argue with her."</p>

  <p>Sitting on the edge of the table, she had lit a cigarette, and was sending
  blue, twisting rings of smoke into the air. She did not speak for a long
  time, and then only to break in upon Gordon's gloomy thoughts.</p>

  <p>"My, I wish I was back home in my little apartment on a hundred 'n'
  thoity-ninth Street!" she quavered.</p>

  <p>Mr. Selsbury was visibly surprised. He had never heard her say "thoity"
  before.</p>

  <p>Diana had come to feel unaccountably fagged. There was no adequate reason,
  for as a rule she was tireless; but the succession of demands upon her
  nervous energy was telling. She had to watch for tradesmen, she had to answer
  the door; a dozen times she was called from The Study to interview callers of
  all kinds who, obeying the large notice she had hand-printed and stuck on the
  kitchen door, "Please come to the main entrance: this door is not in use,"
  fed her with packages of grocery, baskets of meat, trays of fish. The amount
  of food that was consumed at No. 61 was appalling; she, at any rate, was
  appalled.</p>

  <p>Toward evening, when Dempsi was fidgeting for the dinner she had forgotten
  to order, a man called. He was poorly dressed, unsavoury of appearance. His
  thin, yellow face was unshaven and he carried his head slightly askew. The
  sight of Diana took him aback for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, miss," he said, touching his cap. "I've called for the
  money."</p>

  <p>"Whose money?" she asked, surprised.</p>

  <p>"Mine: I cleaned the windows yesterday."</p>

  <p>Then she recalled him. Heloise had complained that the man was "nosing
  round The Study," and expressed doubts about his honesty and bona fides.</p>

  <p>"Name of Stark, miss," he said encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"I remember." She went in search of her bag.</p>

  <p>When she came back, he was examining the lock of the door with
  professional interest. He was once a lock-maker, he offered the excuse for
  his curiosity. If Diana had not been wearing very soft-soled boots, the
  excuse would have been unnecessary.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Selsbury not in, miss?" as she counted the money in his hand.</p>

  <p>"No," she said shortly.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Trenter in, miss?"</p>

  <p>"No." Her eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p>"Will Mr. Selsbury be away long&mdash;I wanted to see him about a
  job?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know when he will be back," she said. "There are several men in
  the house: would you like to see one?"</p>

  <p>His expression changed.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, miss."</p>

  <p>She closed the door on him and wondered when the Watch Dog would
  arrive.</p>

  <p>There was still a lot of money in the safe. Those unaware of her
  obligations to Mr. Dempsi might imagine there was more.</p>

  <p>Dempsi had wandered out of the room when she came in, and she went swiftly
  to the safe. It was one of those old-fashioned receptacles that had, in
  addition to the combination, a further lock operated by a key. Gordon had
  once told her that the key was never used; he had once mislaid it and had to
  summon experts to open the door. She searched his writing-table, pulling out
  drawers (she opened them all without difficulty) and at last, in a small
  envelope inscribed gratuitously "Key," she found what she sought.</p>

  <p>"Thank goodness!" said Diana.</p>

  <p>A turn of her wrist and the safe was secure even against those who by
  cunning or violence had obtained the code word.</p>

  <p>Mr. Julius Superbus came importantly, descending from a taxicab and
  drawing out after him a large tin box, mottled red and black. He produced,
  also from the interior of the cab, a large scrap-book fastened about with a
  broad green canvas strap. He also delivered from the cab a daring golf cap.
  These he deposited on the sidewalk, paid the taximan his fare, climbing
  inside to verify what had seemed to be a preposterous statement of claim, and
  donated the driver sixpence. Diana in the note she had scrawled had added a
  P.S. "Spare no expense."</p>

  <p>Gathering his belongings under both arms, he went up the steps, stooped
  and pressed the bell with his nose, a clever little device that had once come
  to him as an inspiration and which in itself advertised his originality.</p>

  <p>Diana answered the door.</p>

  <p>"You sent for me," said Julius simply. "I have come."</p>

  <p>She was obviously relieved to see him, and piloted him into the dining-
  room.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Superbus, I am going to make great demands upon you, and I'm sure I
  shall not ask in vain. I am in the greatest trouble,"</p>

  <p>He inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"Have you searched all your clothes?" he asked quickly. "You've lost
  something&mdash;I know this by, so to speak, a method of my own. It's natural
  to suspect servants&mdash;but do they do it, ma'am? Not once in fifty
  times&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've lost nothing. Mr. Superbus, my uncle is here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was doubtful as to how she should go on.</p>

  <p>Should she take him entirely into her confidence? A wild idea, but not
  without its advantage.</p>

  <p>"Relations," the Roman pronounced, "are best apart. They come, they borrow
  money, they eat you out of house and home, and when they go, they haven't a
  good word for you. Uncles especially. Leave him to me, ma'am; I'll put the
  case to him man to man. He'll be out of this house..." he looked at his
  watch&mdash;"in five minutes."</p>

  <p>She enlightened him briefly: her uncle was a welcome visitor; a nice man,
  very much like Mr. Selsbury in appearance and as young. Only... she tapped
  her forehead. Mr. Superbus understood.</p>

  <p>"Tact," he said, "tact and humour. Let 'em think they're havin' their way
  and then the iron hand in the velvet glove&mdash;an expression I invented
  myself," he appended modestly. "Leave him to me. You couldn't come to anybody
  better than me, ma'am. We've had several lunatics in our family"&mdash;Diana
  stepped back a pace&mdash;"and his good lady is here?"</p>

  <p>"Aunt Lizzie."</p>

  <p>"That makes it a little awkward," regretted Superbus, "owing to the
  difficulty of watching him when he's asleep. Unless Aunt Lizzie would mind? I
  am a family man."</p>

  <p>"She might object," said Diana. "No, I don't think that you need do that.
  If you can keep a general eye on him. He must not leave the house on any
  excuse."</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus smiled.</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry about that, ma'am," he said.</p>

  <p>There followed more instructions and warnings. Diana flew into The Study
  to pacify a distracted Dempsi, whose urgent voice had interrupted her twice
  during the interview with the detective.</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus went into the kitchen thoughtfully. He saw no resemblance
  between Gordon Selsbury and his uncle. He noted that in Aunt Lizzie's face
  was an expression of uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon," he said. "My name's Smith."</p>

  <p>Gordon pointed to the door.</p>

  <p>"Go out and change it," he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus was amused.</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd pop down and have a look at you, Uncle Isaac," he said, and
  bowed to the lady, "and Aunt Lizzie." He radiated compassion.</p>

  <p>"Get out!" roared Gordon, red of face. "Go back to the lady who employs
  you and tell her that I give her ten minutes to hand me my keys and kick her
  infernal Dempsi out of the house!"</p>

  <p>"What's the good?" It was Heloise who spoke. "If you make a fuss you'll be
  seeing the judge on Monday."</p>

  <p>"I don't care!" Gordon was toeing the limit. "I simply don't care. I'm the
  master of this house and I will assert myself."</p>

  <p>"Say, Gordon! What am I&mdash;one of the extras? Ain't I got any say in
  this? You don't care! Well, I'm certainly glad you're that way&mdash;it's
  grand. But I allowed myself to be trapped by a she-octopus and I'll find
  another way of getting out than taking the short trail to the hutch. And the
  only way out is to behave."</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus agreed. He was not unprepared for the claim that Gordon was
  master of the house: against this strange hallucination on the part of Uncle
  Isaac that he was his own nephew, Diana had warned him.</p>

  <p>"You're a good lad and I'm a good lad," he murmured. "We're all good lads
  together."</p>

  <p>He winked at Heloise. Susceptible to such signals, Heloise winked
  back.</p>

  <p>It was maddening&mdash;to what degree, Gordon learnt painfully. Mr.
  Superbus was so kind and so helpful and so tolerant. Gordon went into his
  pantry and searched for a large, razor-sharp carving knife. There are some
  things no man can endure&mdash;kindness is one of them.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Life," said Mr. Dempsi, stretching the toes of his small
feet to the fire
  with a luxurious intake of breath, "is a beautiful thing. From the utter
  depths of loveless despair to the sublime accomplishment of heart's
  desire&mdash;what a transition, my own!"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dempsi&mdash;" began Diana.</p>

  <p>"Wopsy," he murmured reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;Wopsy. I have allowed you to stay because I wanted a quiet
  talk with you. A quiet talk," she stressed the qualification as he reached
  out for a hand that was not there.</p>

  <p>"Silence is so wonderful." He turned his languishing eyes upon her.
  "Silence and thought and The Woman."</p>

  <p>But Diana had her piece to say, carefully prepared and rehearsed in the
  solitude of her room.</p>

  <p>"Five years ago you were good enough to ask me to marry you. I refused.
  People say that young girls are brainless&mdash;the fact that I declined the
  honour you offered is proof to the contrary.</p>

  <p>What I felt then, I feel now. My heart is in the grave!"</p>

  <p>"My grave." His smile was melancholy but complacent.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly. You are alive, I'm sorry&mdash;I mean I should be sorry
  if you weren't. I had a lover&mdash;my heart went out to him,
  Wopsy,"&mdash;her voice trembled, she thought there were tears in his
  sympathetic eyes, "but he passed."</p>

  <p>"Ran away from you?" Mr. Dempsi sat up.</p>

  <p>"When I say 'passed'"&mdash;there was more than a trace of acid in Diana's
  voice&mdash;"I mean... to the Great Beyond."</p>

  <p>"Pegged out?" Dempsi shrugged. "These things happen. Once I loved a
  girl&mdash;oh, Diana, such a girl amongst girls! Tall, divinely fair,
  gracious in every look and movement. She also passed&mdash;to the Great
  Beyond."</p>

  <p>"She died?" whispered Diana.</p>

  <p>"She went on to the stage&mdash;in America," said Dempsi. "She was dead to
  me. I cut her out of my heart. I could have killed myself, but I said:
  'Wopsy, have you forgotten your little Diana&mdash;your first, your only
  love?' With a courage that I have often admired, I forgot her. She is now the
  greatest screen vamp in Hollywood. I see her frequently without a tremor.
  Such things happen."</p>

  <p>Diana was unmoved, though a little discouraged.</p>

  <p>"My love will never be forgotten," she gulped. "Wopsy, you see how
  impossible it is&mdash;did you get the money?"</p>

  <p>"The money&mdash;you sent it to me? But, Diana, how foolish!"</p>

  <p>"I sent it by cheque," she said.</p>

  <p>He sank back again in his chair.</p>

  <p>"You are a foolish little one. Money!" He laughed cruelly. "How you Anglo-
  Saxons worship money! To men of my temperament...!" He snapped his fingers.
  "As to your unfaithfulness to the great ideal I provided, your heartless
  disregard for my memory, I forgive you. You were only a child&mdash;you could
  not be expected to cherish the memory of the man who died for you. That is
  past. We belong to the Day&mdash;tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday we shall be
  married."</p>

  <p>"What are we doing on Wednesday?" she asked. "Forgive me for looking so
  far ahead."</p>

  <p>For a second he was disconcerted, uneasy: that he betrayed in his
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"My dear little Diana, how droll you are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen, Dempsi or Wopsy, as the case may be&mdash;you are returning to
  your hotel to-morrow. We are not getting married on Monday, Tuesday or
  Wednesday. Shall I tell you why? I see that you are interested. Because I
  don't want to marry you."</p>

  <p>His face darkened.</p>

  <p>"This is Uncle Isaac!" he said between his teeth. "The influence of that
  man is diabolical! All my life I have been thwarted by aunts and uncles. He
  shall answer to me&mdash;Giuseppe Dempsi!"</p>

  <p>He flung out of his chair, took two strides toward the door, when she
  caught his arms desperately.</p>

  <p>"Let me go," he stormed.</p>

  <p>"If you leave this room I will telephone for the police!"</p>

  <p>The tension relaxed.</p>

  <p>"For me&mdash;the police for me I" He covered his face in his hands and
  his shoulders heaved convulsively. Diana felt no regrets.</p>

  <p>"And she of whom I dreamt threatens me. Let me die!"</p>

  <p>Diana let him. At the end of three minutes he was still alive.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dempsi, dry your eyes."</p>

  <p>Like a faithful but heart-broken hound, he obeyed.</p>

  <p>"You may stay here to-night," she said; "your bedroom is at the top of the
  stairs. I hope you sleep well. If you want anything, ring the bell. Good-
  night."</p>

  <p>He turned wearily toward the door.</p>

  <p>"This is not Diana."</p>

  <p>His dejection would have touched a heart of stone. Diana was unmoved. She
  heard his door close, went silently up the stairs and slipped a key into the
  lock. He heard, too late, the grating of steel against steel. Before he could
  reach the door the lock snapped.</p>

  <p>"Who is that&mdash;who has locked the door? Open it at once."</p>

  <p>"It is I," said Diana in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"But, Diana, this is extraordinary!"</p>

  <p>"I do it for your own protection," she whispered through the keyhole.
  "Uncle Isaac does not like you&mdash;and he is armed!"</p>

  <p>A silence.</p>

  <p>"But this is dangerous! If there is a fire&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Use the extinguisher!" she hissed. "It is hanging in the wardrobe."</p>

  <p>She was tired, aching in every limb, immensely lonely. Oh, for the
  comforting presence of Gordon! Or even Eleanor, at that moment sitting in
  agitated conference with Mrs. Magglesark, discussing the strange behaviour of
  mistresses in general and Australian mistresses in particular.</p>

  <p>Happily there was Mr. Superbus.</p>

  <p>The faint sound of music came up from the servants' hall as she descended
  the stairs. Mr. Superbus was playing a mouth-organ softly, almost musically.
  Aunt Lizzie sat before the kitchen fire, chin in hand. Uncle Isaac leant
  against the kitchen dresser, glowering at the musician. The harmonies were
  confirmed as she opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Had a pleasant evening?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I've had nothing to eat but bread and cheese," said Gordon. "This little
  joke of yours is going too far, Diana."</p>

  <p>She looked at him aghast.</p>

  <p>"We didn't have any dinner!" she said in dismay, tempered with the
  satisfaction that Dempsi was at that moment starving in his locked room. "I
  haven't even had bread and cheese&mdash;it is time for you to go to bed."</p>

  <p>"I'll go when I please," said Gordon loudly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus shook his head reprovingly.</p>

  <p>"Naughty, naughty!" he chided. "That's not like my Uncle Isaac. And he's
  been such a good boy, ma'am, singing as gay as a lark."</p>

  <p>Gordon blushed.</p>

  <p>"I didn't sing, you jackass!" he growled.</p>

  <p>"Didn't he sing, Aunt Lizzie?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged indifferent shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Well, if he didn't sing he 'ummed," insisted Mr. Superbus.</p>

  <p>His repertoire on the mouth-organ included the Eton Boating
  Song&mdash;Gordon was an old Etonian. Doubtless he had 'ummed: no Etonian
  could resist the lilt of it.</p>

  <p>"To bed," said Diana curtly.</p>

  <p>Swinging her keys, she had the appearance of a jailer,</p>

  <p>"You will regret this," said Gordon between his teeth. "I can bring a
  thousand people to identify me."</p>

  <p>"And how many to identify Aunt Lizzie?" asked Diana with a curl of her
  lips.</p>

  <p>Gordon had no answer. She had the exasperating habit of shutting every
  door in his face, dispelling every wild vision of liberty that hope conjured
  to shape.</p>

  <p>Heloise was not silenced.</p>

  <p>"Why, that's not going to be difficult," she drawled. "I'm Mrs. van Oynne
  of 71 Clarence Gate Gardens."</p>

  <p>"Very good," nodded Diana. "You are at liberty to telephone to the police
  and allow them to identify you. I'll tell them that by an error I have
  mistaken you for Double Dan's&mdash;what is the word? partners? They will put
  things right."</p>

  <p>Heloise got up.</p>

  <p>"I was never strong for fighting," she said. "I'm going to bed."</p>

  <p>Diana led the way, Gordon came after, Mr. Superbus followed, emitting soft
  tuning noises from his mouth-organ. Were it in his repertoire, Gordon would
  have selected "The Death of Asa" as an appropriate accompaniment to that
  solemn march. He imagined himself a malefactor on his way to execution. Diana
  had the air of hangman and private torturer.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," he said mechanically, and stopped at the door of his
  room.</p>

  <p>"Not in there!" Her loud whisper was threatening. He followed to the floor
  above.</p>

  <p>The room chosen was that in which Diana said she intended sleeping the man
  and wife who were to be engaged for the autumn cleaning. Heloise went
  in&mdash;she knew the room.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," she said.</p>

  <p>"You have forgotten something," said Diana.</p>

  <p>"If you think I'm going to kiss you, there's a surprise coming to you,
  girl," said Heloise, and tried to shut the door.</p>

  <p>"Your husband," said Diana primitively.</p>

  <p>The door slammed, Diana heard a chair dragged across the room, and guessed
  that the back of it was being propped under the handle. Gordon's throat went
  dry.</p>

  <p>"You have quarrelled?" said Diana. "Or perhaps you don't...."</p>

  <p>"I don't!"</p>

  <p>The voice came from his stomach&mdash;he had never suspected such a range
  of sound in himself.</p>

  <p>"That's very awkward." She tapped her lips with a key. "You'll have to go
  into the spare room. Come down."</p>

  <p>The spare room was at the far end of the passage and the bed had not been
  made up.</p>

  <p>"There are the blankets," said Diana and pointed. "To-morrow I will find
  sheets for you. The bed is more comfortable than any you'll find at the
  police station."</p>

  <p>She locked the door on him.</p>

  <p>The window was open, but there was no method of reaching safety. Here the
  wall dropped sheerly to the bottom of the area, and if you missed the area
  there was a row of sharp, spiked railings. Gordon decided to go to bed. For
  an hour he tossed from side to side, his nerves on edge, sleep farther from
  him than ever. There might be a spare key to the room in one of the drawers.
  He searched diligently, but without success. Then he tried the door. From
  somewhere outside came the sound of a knife-cleaner working eccentrically. Or
  it may have been the noise of a carpet-sweeper being pushed across the floor
  by one who had no conception of rhythm. As he turned the handle, the noise
  ceased and a voice said:</p>

  <p>"Sleep well. Uncle Isaac."</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus, that faithful watch dog, was sleeping on the mat.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Diana stirred uneasily in her sleep and woke. There was no
sound but the
  distant snore of Mr. Superbus, but she had an uncanny instinct that all was
  not well. Slipping out of bed, she pulled on her dressing-gown and looked out
  of the window. She saw a figure on the sidewalk. A man, slight of build,
  round- shouldered. She saw him clearly in the light of the street standard
  which was immediately opposite the house. She guessed his face rather than
  saw it, and wondered where she had seen him before. Stark, the
  window-cleaner! Now she knew him. As she looked, he stood back quickly,
  bringing himself against the railings. Craning her neck, she saw a shadowy
  policeman slowly passing the end of the street. He reached the opposite
  corner and stopped, came a few steps down Cheynel Gardens and stopped again.
  There was the flare of a match. It was the hour when policemen produce
  surreptitious pipes in defiance of all regulations. The figure against the
  railings remained motionless.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" demanded Diana.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stark looked up.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, lady. I can't sleep," he stammered.</p>

  <p>"See the policeman: he'll nurse you," said Diana.</p>

  <p>He disappeared up the passage leading to the courtyard, but presently he
  came back and walked boldly back to the main street. Diana saw the smoking
  policeman cross the road. There was a brief conversation and Mr. Stark
  disappeared. Diana thought she had seen the policeman's hands moving
  scientifically over the loafer's body.</p>

  <p>She was thoroughly awake now. The hour was 3.15. She took up her handbag,
  unlocked and opened her door and listened. The watchful Julius was awake
  instantly.</p>

  <p>"It is only I, Mr. Superbus," she said, relieved to find him so alert. "I
  am afraid you're having a very uncomfortable time."</p>

  <p>"No, miss: I seldom sleep. Napoleon was that way by all accounts. Want
  anything, ma'am?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to make myself a cup of tea," she said, and went down the
  gloomy stairs to the kitchen.</p>

  <p>She was very hungry&mdash;she made tea, found a tinful of biscuits and
  called her protector in a whisper to share the feast.</p>

  <p>"We might as well have some light," she said, and lit the hall lamp. "Come
  in, Mr. Superbus."</p>

  <p>The door of The Study did not yield to her pressure, and she frowned.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I did not lock this door," she said, and found the pass-key in
  her bag. The door was bolted on the inside!</p>

  <p>"Wait here whilst I dress," she said.</p>

  <p>The eyes of Julius Superbus bulged. Excitement toned his complexion from
  petunia to old gold. He was not nervous; he was not frightened. Danger made
  him go pale. Mark Antony was that way.</p>

  <p>She was down again in an incredibly short space of time, took the revolver
  belt from the hall cupboard and fixed it about her waist. Mr. Superbus saw
  the gun in her hand and felt more comfortable.</p>

  <p>"Open the door, please."</p>

  <p>There was a faint rustle of movement on the other side of the door. A not
  so faint click as if lights were being extinguished.</p>

  <p>"Guard the back of the house," she said in a low voice. "He will probably
  escape over the wall. Take no risks&mdash;strike him down at once. He may be
  armed!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus did not move. He was rooted to the spot, as they say.</p>

  <p>"What about getting a policeman?" he asked hollowly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't want the police here. Do as I tell you, please."</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus tried to lift a foot and winced; his rheumatism had "come on"
  again.</p>

  <p>"I won't leave you here by yourself," he said unsteadily; "it would be
  cowardly, leaving a lady by herself."</p>

  <p>From the hall there was one entrance to The Study. You might reach it,
  however, through the small ante-room which Gordon used as a book store. He
  refused to dignify the place with the description of "library."</p>

  <p>"Stay here," she whispered, and sped along the dark passage.</p>

  <p>The door was unlocked, the smell of books came to her in the darkness, and
  she stepped stealthily into the room, pistol in hand.</p>

  <p>The second door into The Study opened. The big room was in darkness except
  for the faint light of the painted window.</p>

  <p>"Hands up!" she called. "I see you!"</p>

  <p>The light control was at the other end of the room&mdash;she felt
  cautiously forward. She had taken a few steps when the door into the hall
  jerked open and a figure darted through, slamming the door....</p>

  <p>Superbus would have him, she thought exultantly as she ran in pursuit. But
  there was no sound of struggle, and when she flew into the hall it was
  empty.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Superbus!" she called.</p>

  <p>"Here, ma'am." He came out of The Study behind her. "I follered you," he
  said; "it wasn't right to let a lady take risks. Did you see him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, why didn't you do as I told you?" she wailed.</p>

  <p>"My duty was to foller you." Julius was dogged. "It was safer."</p>

  <p>Which was true.</p>

  <p>She put on all the lights of The Study. Nothing apparently had been
  disturbed except&mdash;</p>

  <p>She had left the pointer of the combination on the letter "X." It was now
  on "A."</p>

  <p>"Bring in the tea," she said, and continued her inspection.</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus returned with the tray she had filled.</p>

  <p>"What we want are cloos," he said gently, so gently that she did not hear
  him aright.</p>

  <p>"The wine cellars are closed. I don't want the bother of unlocking
  them&mdash;and I never drink."</p>

  <p>"Cloos," said Julius loudly.</p>

  <p>"Oh! I thought you said... well, find some."</p>

  <p>Bent double, he prowled round the room. Diana ate biscuits ravenously.</p>

  <p>"Somebody has been here," he pointed to the big chair near the fireplace.
  "Look at that cushion&mdash;there's the mark of a head."</p>

  <p>"Mine," she was laconic, a trifle unkind. "Look for cigar-ash, my dear
  Watson!"</p>

  <p>He eyed her with a certain amount of suspicion which was largely
  justified.</p>

  <p>"Come and eat," she said, and dropped the biscuit tin within reach. "Now
  how on earth did he get out?"</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"Doub&mdash;Uncle Isaac." She corrected her error instantly.</p>

  <p>Julius could afford to smile.</p>

  <p>"He didn't get out. I've never left my post, ma'am. My own theory is that
  it was a burglar."</p>

  <p>"How did he leave the house?" she asked. "The front door is still chained
  and bolted. He must still be in the house."</p>

  <p>"Don't say that, miss&mdash;ma'am," begged Julius nervously. "If he was in
  this house I wouldn't be responsible for myself. I go mad when I see
  burglars&mdash;that's why the doctor ordered me to keep away from 'em."</p>

  <p>"He's in the house; probably hiding in the kitchen. Have some biscuits;
  when I've finished my tea we'll go look for him."</p>

  <p>Julius had no appetite.</p>

  <p>"This is a case for the regular police," he said earnestly. "They're paid
  for it, anyway. The Government supports their widows. Besides," unselfishly,
  "they get promotion for capturing burglars. I believe in doing somebody a
  good turn whenever I can. Shall I get a copper?"</p>

  <p>She motioned him to remain.</p>

  <p>"Stay here: I will look."</p>

  <p>He refused to stay. His place was by her side and a little behind her. He
  liked the way she handled that Browning. She seemed the kind of woman who
  would stand no nonsense.</p>

  <p>The kitchen drew blank.</p>

  <p>"I never thought he was here," she said. "No, it was Uncle Isaac."</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus, back in The Study, propounded a startling theory.</p>

  <p>"There's such things as subterranean passages," he said. "I've seen 'em.
  You push back a panel and there's a flight of stairs, leading to an
  underground vault. You touch a spring&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There are no springs to be touched at 61 Cheynel Gardens," she said, "and
  no panels, and no underground vaults except the cellar where the furnace is.
  Go down and satisfy yourself."</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus countered graciously that her word was sufficient.</p>

  <p>The hour was a quarter after four o'clock. Mr. Superbus lit the fire,
  going very slowly down to the kitchen to find the kindling wood, and coming
  very swiftly up again. His teeth were chattering: it was very chilly in the
  kitchen, he said.</p>

  <p>"There was nothing to hurt you in the kitchen," she said.</p>

  <p>Julius was amused.</p>

  <p>"Hurt me? I'd like to see the thing that tried it on! I don't know what
  fear is, ma'am. All our family is that way. My brother Augustus walks through
  a churchyard every night from the Duchesses' Arms&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Does she know him so well&mdash;how odd!" she said.</p>

  <p>"It's the name of an inn, ma'am. He's married. Yes, he walks through the
  churchyard and he's never seen anything. His wife&mdash;she's got a bitter
  tongue&mdash;says that she's not surprised. He can't see her by the time he
  gets home. My sister Agrippa is as brave as a lion&mdash;it runs in the
  family. What's that!"</p>

  <p>He half rose. From the hall came the sound of stealthy footsteps.</p>

  <p>"Go out and see."</p>

  <p>She reached for the gun.</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus went reluctantly, making a wide detour. You can as easily see
  into the hall from the far side of the room as from the doorway. She saw him
  creep slowly onward until he was in a position, by stretching his neck, to
  command a view of the hall.</p>

  <p>"Don't shoot, ma'am," he quavered; "it's Aunt!"</p>

  <p>Heloise advanced into the room, a scowl on her face.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble?" she demanded. "I heard somebody running
  upstairs."</p>

  <p>Her eyes fell on the biscuit tin. She reached for a handful, sat down
  before the unlit fire and munched moodily.</p>

  <p>"There's a cat and canary feeling about this house," she said. "I wish I
  was home!"</p>

  <p>Diana was impressed by the abysmal dejection of the woman.</p>

  <p>"Get another cup and saucer, Mr. Superbus," she said. "Aunt Lizzie would
  like some tea."</p>

  <p>Julius had gone down on his knees before the fireplace, in that attitude
  resembling a priest of some mystic sect of fire-worshippers. Straightening
  his back, he looked up anxiously.</p>

  <p>"You will find a cup and saucer on the servery at the end of the passage,"
  said Diana. "You need not go down to the kitchen."</p>

  <p>Julius rose with relief.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind the kitchen," he said untruly.</p>

  <p>It was Heloise who lit the fire and crouched above it, folded arms on
  knees, staring down at the little banners of flame. It seemed to her that a
  million years had passed since she had discussed anybody's soul. Watching
  her, Diana had a view of a delicately moulded cheek and the tip of a
  well-shaped nose, and experienced an inexplicable wave of compassion toward
  the woman.</p>

  <p>"What is Double Dan to you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Heloise shrugged her left shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Are you married to him?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. van Oynne was sensitive to atmosphere. No English barometer (the most
  restless of all scientific instruments except perhaps a Japanese seismograph)
  was quite as responsive to the emotions of others as was the little detector
  which registered sympathy in the nimble brain of Heloise.</p>

  <p>"Some day I will tell you," she said, in a tone of deepest melancholy,
  "but not now&mdash;not now!"</p>

  <p>She drew a long, shivering sigh.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose you're following this kind of life for the fun of it,"
  Diana went on, her heart softening toward her unwilling guest.</p>

  <p>"You've said it!" Heloise nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"If I could do anything&mdash;" began Diana.</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus arrived with the extra cup and saucer, and confidences were
  temporarily sidetracked.</p>

  <p>"Sleep well, Aunt Lizzie?" asked Julius, drinking audibly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I can't sleep in strange beds. Besides, I've got trouble&mdash;big
  trouble. People can't sleep when they're in trouble."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Julius wisely. "My theory is that you have slept."</p>

  <p>She looked round at him over her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Where do you get that theory? Don't you think I know whether I slept or
  not, you poor... Mr. Superbus?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Julius calmly; "there's one thing nobody knows&mdash;you can
  never know that you're asleep. You're a bit of a sonombulist?" he asked with
  elaborate carelessness.</p>

  <p>"How's that?"</p>

  <p>"Sonombulist&mdash;walk in your sleep. I got an idea I saw you about one
  o'clock?"</p>

  <p>She turned her face away to the contemplation of the fire.</p>

  <p>"Got ideas too? That mind of yours is surely active. If I thought you'd
  seen me at one o'clock, why, I'd die right here at this very minute. I was
  taking off&mdash;you married?"</p>

  <p>Julius, with some complacence, confessed that he was.</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess I can discuss corsets without offending against Public
  Morality. You didn't see me at one o'clock&mdash;I'd be sorry to think you
  had."</p>

  <p>Julius was embarrassed but not completely discouraged.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it was three o'clock&mdash;I saw somebody coming downstairs. Ha ha,
  Aunt Lizzie, I saw you!"</p>

  <p>He lifted a roguish finger.</p>

  <p>"You're nutty," she said tersely, yawned and got up. "I guess I could
  sleep now. And I'm going to hang a stocking over the keyhole of my door." She
  directed this remark at Mr. Superbus and he choked indignantly at the base
  insinuation.</p>

  <p>"Did you see her?" asked Diana after Heloise had gone.</p>

  <p>"No, ma'am, I didn't," admitted Julius. "You can often get people to
  confess that way. It's called the Third Decree in America. I've tried it
  myself. We had a charwoman help once who used to pinch my tobacco for her
  husband. I tried it on her&mdash;and other cases."</p>

  <p>"You think it was Aunt Lizzie that was in the room?"</p>

  <p>"Certain!" said Julius. "Notice how quiet she walks? That's a bad
  sign&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Notice how she reeks of Origon?" mimicked Diana.</p>

  <p>"I didn't see her reeking," admitted Mr. Superbus, confused.</p>

  <p>"I wonder you didn't&mdash;those heavy perfumes are almost visible. And
  there was no scent of Origon in the room&mdash;no fresh scent, anyway."</p>

  <p>It was still dark when she drew up the blind and looked out. She felt very
  wide awake without knowing exactly in what manner her activity might be best
  employed.</p>

  <p>"Take this key, go up into Uncle Isaac's room, open the door quietly and
  see if he is there. And then get out&mdash;quick!"</p>

  <p>Julius did not like that word "quick!" Climbing the stairs leisurely, he
  listened at the door of Uncle Isaac's room. There was no sound. Which was
  satisfactory. On the other hand, the very stillness might be ominous. Mad
  people are notoriously cunning. He remembered gruesome stories he had heard
  of cat-footed maniacs who had crept up behind their guards and cut their
  throats with pieces of old iron secretly sharpened.</p>

  <p>Julius Superbus drew a long breath. The blood of his Caesarian ancestors
  ran a little coldly; the pumping station under his left-hand waistcoat pocket
  increased its thump noisily. Again he listened. If Uncle Isaac was asleep, he
  would make no noise. Therefore, if there was no sound, he must be asleep. He
  went downstairs again.</p>

  <p>"Sleeping like an innocent child," he reported, "one 'and under his cheek
  an' a sort of smile on his face."</p>

  <p>She took the key from his hand and looked at it.</p>

  <p>"You went in?"</p>

  <p>"Right in," said Julius, sunning his back at the fire. "Put on the light,
  had a good look around."</p>

  <p>She looked at the flat steel in her hand.</p>

  <p>"I only asked you," she said, "because I gave you the key of The Study by
  mistake."</p>

  <p>Julius was a man of infinite resource.</p>

  <p>"I've got a way of opening doors that's known only to three people in the
  world."</p>

  <p>"Come up with me," she said, rising. "I've got a way too&mdash;I use the
  right key."</p>

  <p>He walked behind her, temporarily at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>She opened the door of Gordon's prison quickly and snapped on the
  light.</p>

  <p>The room was empty.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Knotted to the bedstead was a rope. It was of amateur make,
being three
  strips of blanket plaited together, and the rope led through the open
  window.</p>

  <p>Diana looked down. The end of the rope dangled less than six feet from the
  window-sill. He must have dropped twenty feet to the stone flags below.</p>

  <p>"That's funny," said Superbus, game to the last. "When I looked
  in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let us keep to facts," begged Diana, her youthful brows wrinkled. "What
  is the use of a rope if it only falls him a few feet from the sill&mdash;and
  why didn't he pull the bed to the window?"</p>

  <p>She pulled the bed herself&mdash;it moved easily. The weight of a man
  would have drawn it across the floor.</p>

  <p>Thoughtfully she took stock of the apartment. In one corner stood a long,
  mirror-fronted wardrobe. Drawing her Browning, she pulled open the door.</p>

  <p>"Come out, please," she said coldly.</p>

  <p>Gordon stepped forth with some dignity.</p>

  <p>Standing in the doorway, Mr. Superbus witnessed the astonishing spectacle
  and shook his head reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Isaac, Uncle Isaac!" he said reprovingly. "I never thought you'd
  play a trick like that on an old friend!"</p>

  <p>"Will you kindly tell me why you destroyed my bed linen?" asked Diana, and
  her cool claim to the ownership of anything in the house aroused Gordon to
  fury.</p>

  <p>"Your bed linen is my bed linen!" he spluttered.</p>

  <p>She raised her hand.</p>

  <p>"We will not go into that matter. Uncle Isaac," she said with freezing
  politeness. "Will you be kind enough to draw in the blanket and close the
  window? It will be light soon, and I have no wish to give the milkman a topic
  for discussion. I have my cousin's interests to guard."</p>

  <p>"Send for Bobbie," said Gordon, suddenly quiet. "I don't think he will
  have any doubt as to who I am."</p>

  <p>"If by 'Bobbie' you mean Mr. Robert Selsbury," said Diana, "I've already
  telephoned to him. He is out of town&mdash;probably decoyed away by your
  agents."</p>

  <p>Gordon was stricken to silence. The last avenue of escape was closed,</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "I promise you I will give you no further
  trouble."</p>

  <p>He pulled in the rope, let down the window and drew the blinds.</p>

  <p>"Now, if you don't mind," he said, "I would like to go to sleep. I have
  been up the whole of the night."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"You may sleep, but Mr. Superbus will sit in this room. I will lock the
  door on you both&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Personally, I prefer sitting outside," said Mr. Superbus hastily. "I
  should like a smoke."</p>

  <p>"You will remain," said Diana with firmness.</p>

  <p>"If he does, I'll chuck him out of the window," said Gordon savagely.</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus backed from the room.</p>

  <p>"He'll be all right, ma'am&mdash;miss," he said. "Trust old Uncle
  Isaac."</p>

  <p>Diana knew that it was useless to insist. She shut the door on her captive
  and went down to The Study, being confident that he would make no further
  attempt at escape.</p>

  <p>She must get in touch with Bobbie, must even risk his annoyance at being
  dragged from his bed at that unearthly hour. She took up the telephone and
  put through a call. It was answered with surprising rapidity. The voice of an
  unknown man spoke: she guessed it was Bobbie's servant.</p>

  <p>"It is Miss Ford speaking. Can I speak to Mr. Selsbury?"</p>

  <p>"He hasn't been home all night, miss. I've been sitting up for him. He
  said he might get into London at daybreak."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He's gone to Ostend, miss. He telephoned me from Dover."</p>

  <p>The news was unexpected and a little alarming.</p>

  <p>"Has he gone alone?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"To the best of my knowledge and belief, miss," said Bobbie's man,
  tactfully, diplomatically and legally.</p>

  <p>Diana hung up the receiver. Had they lured Bobbie, she wondered?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Bobbie Selsbury had gone to Victoria to rescue his brother
at the eleventh
  hour from a situation which could be mildly described as dangerous. He had
  searched one Continental train from end to end, and was half way through
  another when the guard's whistle sounded, and he was faced with the
  alternatives of leaving his search incomplete or going on to Dover. He
  decided upon the latter course, continuing his inspection of the
  compartments, roving Pullman cars, peeping in upon indignant honeymoon
  couples, without discovering the object of his search. At Dover he discovered
  that there had been a relief train leave Victoria at a quarter to eleven; the
  passengers were already on the steamer. Gordon may have come by that, he
  thought, and made his decision.</p>

  <p>He had no passport, but most of the restrictions affecting Continental
  travel, especially travel to Belgium, had been removed, and he was able to
  convince the passport officer at the barrier that his business was of such
  urgency, and his identity so well established, that a little licence might be
  extended to him; and, on the promise that he would return after leaving the
  ship, he was allowed to pass to the quayside.</p>

  <p>He stopped only to get a call through to London, and, by great good luck,
  found the Dover-London wire disengaged. The boat was crowded, and he was no
  sooner on board than he saw how impossible it was to make sure that Gordon
  was not on the boat by a search whilst the ship was in port. The <i>Princess
  Juliana</i> carried Bobbie to sea. He arrived at Ostend at four o'clock in
  the afternoon, having satisfied himself that, although there were many
  suspicious characters on the ship, Gordon and Mrs. van Oynne were not two of
  them.</p>

  <p>He spent two hours seeking the British Vice-Consul and persuading that
  gentleman to give him the necessary certificate to be readmitted, and to
  placate the passport officer on the other side, who had already been notified
  of his unauthorized departure.</p>

  <p>Very few of the Ostend hotels were open, but Bobbie made a tour of all,
  examining their visitors' books. Gordon was not in Ostend. That was a relief.
  He might have changed his mind at the last moment and gone to Paris, but that
  was unlikely. Bobbie believed his brother, though he imposed the limit of
  strain upon his credulity.</p>

  <p>He returned to Dover by the night boat, and came in the grey dawn to the
  port, where he was held for two hours by the outraged passport authorities,
  missing the boat train and finally catching a slow train from the town
  station. He arrived in London at ten, unshaven, weary and irritable, and he
  did then what he might well have done at first&mdash;he drove straight to
  Scotland Yard, and, fortune favouring him, found Inspector Carslake in his
  room. Carslake and he had been in France together, and for twelve months had
  worked side by side in the Intelligence Bureau, where enemy regiments were
  identified and their positions plotted, by methods which would have puzzled
  cleverer people than my dear Watson.</p>

  <p>As briefly as possible Bobbie told his story, and the inspector listened
  with unusual interest.</p>

  <p>"It's curious you should come to me. I have charge of the Double Dan
  cases, and I must say that this looks like a typical coup of his."</p>

  <p>"Gordon isn't an easy man to impersonate," warned Bobbie, "though I told
  him he was when I was trying to scare him."</p>

  <p>"Anybody is easy to Double Dan," said Carslake at once. "Tall, short, thin
  or fat. He's a specialist&mdash;the only man at the game as far as I know.
  You didn't see the woman, Mrs. van Oynne?"</p>

  <p>Bobbie shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where she lives?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't the slightest idea."</p>

  <p>"He will do nothing till Monday," said Carslake thoughtfully. "Dan only
  works in banking hours, but when he does work he moves! I take off my hat to
  Dan&mdash;he's clever."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"A man named Throgood. He used to be an actor&mdash;I believe he's played
  opposite some of the best people in America. He was the English dude type. He
  himself is English or Welsh. His partner is an American or a Canadian, and an
  ex-chorus girl. Maybe it's the same&mdash;rather slight, short, with golden
  hair, blue eyes?"</p>

  <p>Bobbie shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't sound like Mrs. van Oynne," he said, hope dawning in his breast.
  "Perhaps I'm mistaken. You're sure?"</p>

  <p>Carslake nodded.</p>

  <p>"We trailed her to Paris and missed her. I shouldn't think he'd be working
  again for a very long time. He likes to allow the excitement to die down, and
  I shouldn't think that he'd take on a new partner; they require very careful
  training." He chuckled. "Double Dan's getting on the nerves of some of your
  commercial people," he said, "but I don't think I should worry very much
  about him. Anyway, I'll come along and see you on Monday."</p>

  <p>Bobbie went home, feeling happier than he had been for the past twenty-
  four hours.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">His servant had news for him.</p>

  <p>"Miss Ford rang you up this morning, sir."</p>

  <p>"Oh, what had she to say?" Bobbie turned, lather brush in hand.</p>

  <p>"She only asked if you were at home."</p>

  <p>"What time was this?"</p>

  <p>"About five o'clock, sir."</p>

  <p>"Five o'clock! You graven image, why didn't you tell me?"</p>

  <p>Lathered as he was, he dashed to the telephone and got through to
  Diana.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Bobbie? Can I see you to-day?"</p>

  <p>"I'll come at once."</p>

  <p>There was a silence at the other end of the wire.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you need come at once," said Diana. "Just call
  in&mdash;don't be surprised if you find somebody here you've heard me speak
  about."</p>

  <p>"Not Dempsi?" he asked, astonished.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is... staying for a day or two. I'll explain when you come."</p>

  <p>Bobbie whistled softly.</p>

  <p>He lunched in the gloomy solitude of his club (it was Sunday, the day on
  which all clubs are at their worst) and early in the afternoon strolled round
  to Cheynel Gardens. The door was opened by a stage butler. Bobbie looked
  fascinated at the glittering display of shirt-front and the ill-fitting dress
  suit, several times too small for its wearer.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Ford is in The Study," said the apparition gruffly.</p>

  <p>Bobbie gazed in wonder; the servitor with the concertina trousers might
  have stepped out from any burlesque of any triangle drama. Had there been
  printed across the dazzling shirt-front "James: an old family servant,
  devoted to the children," he could not have been more obvious.</p>

  <p>"So you're the new butler?"</p>

  <p>The new butler put his hand on his heart, bowed and growled:</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;name of Smith." He was squinting, his face fearfully
  distorted.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm going to call you Superbus. Take that look off your face and
  stop looking round corners."</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus obeyed. He was for a while disappointed.</p>

  <p>"Lord, sir, did you recognise me?" he asked. "Maybe Mrs. Ford told
  you?"</p>

  <p>Bobbie smiled derisively.</p>

  <p>"Recognise you! Good heavens! Why you absolutely shouted! I spotted you
  the moment I saw you!"</p>

  <p>"That's funny," said Mr. Superbus. "My good lady always says that when I
  disguise my face that way she would pass me in the street."</p>

  <p>"How can you blame her? Who wouldn't pass you in the street with that
  face? Even your wife has some illusions left, I suppose. Now, Superbus, what
  is the game?"</p>

  <p>Julius was all innocence. A wreath of wild flowers about his head would
  not have made him more coyishly artless. Bobbie was not deceived.</p>

  <p>"Game, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Why are you in this house, got up like a comic seneschal? Does Miss Ford
  know who you are?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus closed the door quickly and put his finger to his lips.</p>

  <p>"'Ush!" he said mysteriously.</p>

  <p>Bobbie waited.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm 'ushing," he said impatiently.</p>

  <p>Julius tiptoed to The Study and beckoned him through the doorway. He had
  the air of a respectable conspirator; one who knew that whenever the mine
  exploded he would be out of the way and could, in certain eventualities, be
  an acceptable witness for the prosecution.</p>

  <p>"She sent for me," he said darkly. "Asked me to come and stay here&mdash;I
  come! Could I refuse? If there's any danger I like to be on the spot. That's
  me!"</p>

  <p>Bobbie thought he understood Diana's motive. She wanted a man in the
  house; he was not alone in respecting the genius of Double Dan.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see. Sensible girl!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, very sensible. I don't know anybody sensibler. She came to the
  right man. Me."</p>

  <p>"I was talking to myself," a little stiffly.</p>

  <p>Julius inclined his head again.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; we both heard you," he said. "I've got wonderful ears."</p>

  <p>"I understand Miss Ford was alone in the house and she asked you to come
  and stay? I'm glad."</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly alone," explained Mr. Superbus, loath to share the
  honours which were rightly his as Chief Protector. "Of course, there's Uncle
  Isaac."</p>

  <p>Bobbie's mouth opened.</p>

  <p>"Unc&mdash;Uncle Isaac? Uncle Isaac who?"</p>

  <p>Julius had meant to ask this question at the first opportunity.</p>

  <p>"I don't know his other name&mdash;very bad-tempered gentleman. He has
  fits; and... "He tapped his forehead, but Bobbie did not grasp the sense of
  the pantomime.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Isaac! Suffering Moses!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, he hasn't come yet. They must be Hebrew gentlemen. Only Uncle
  Isaac and Mr. Dempsi."</p>

  <p>Bobbie knew about Dempsi.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and Aunt Lizzie," concluded Julius.</p>

  <p>Bobbie staggered, grasped the mantelpiece for support, and turned a wan
  countenance to the shirt-fronted butler. The unreality of the position was
  intensified. Presently Julius would produce two rabbits and a bowl of
  goldfish from a silk hat, and Diana would skip on to the scene in a ballet
  dress and a fixed smile. And then Bobbie would wake up.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind pouring out a drink?" he asked faintly. "My hand's not
  steady."</p>

  <p>The Great Detective opened the tantalus with an air of pride and poured
  forth a potion.</p>

  <p>"Say 'when,'" he said. He would have made a good barman, he was so
  talkative.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Lizzie, I think you said?"</p>

  <p>Bobbie had reviewed his relations, but no Aunt Lizzie showed in their
  serried ranks.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;she came with Uncle Isaac, yesterday afternoon. Rare
  pretty young lady she is too. Naturally she and Uncle Isaac don't get on well
  together. Fancy calling her Lizzie! It's common. And when there's nice names
  like Maud and Ethel and Agnes to choose from."</p>

  <p>Bobbie got back to normal with a struggle.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;why shouldn't she be called Lizzie? It's&mdash;it's an auntish
  name. Aunt Lizzie!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus helped himself from the decanter. He it was who had
  discovered the tantalus in a cabinet. And rights of discoverers are
  indisputable.</p>

  <p>"Good health, sir!" he said, and drank.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Lizzie!" muttered Bobbie.</p>

  <p>"What I can't understand," said Julius, wiping his mouth deftly, "is, when
  she's got a good name like Heloise&mdash;that's what he calls her when
  they're alone..."</p>

  <p>It was not the whisky, for he had not drunk thereof; nor the smell of it,
  for the aroma had not reached him. The room suddenly spun before his eyes. He
  saw twenty-four Superbuses wiping twenty-four moustaches.</p>

  <p>"Heloise! Heloise!" he muttered. "Has she&mdash;has she got hair dark as
  the raven's?"</p>

  <p>Julius considered. He had never met a raven, but he understood that it was
  a very dark bird.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"And eyes that probe your soul?" asked Bobbie.</p>

  <p>Again the detective considered.</p>

  <p>"Well, she ain't done any probing as far as I'm concerned," he confessed,
  "but there's something about them that's&mdash;well, peculiar."</p>

  <p>"And the sweetest voice in the world?"</p>

  <p>Here again Mr. Superbus was handicapped by a lack of experience. Voices
  were just voices to him.</p>

  <p>"I've never heard her singing," he confessed, "or talking much. She swears
  a bit at Uncle Isaac, which in my opinion isn't ladylike. Nor smoking, for
  the matter of that. The way some of these ladies smoke is very sad. Smoking
  stunts the growth&mdash;which a doctor told me, and what a doctor don't know
  ain't worth knowing."</p>

  <p>Bobbie interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"Where&mdash;where is Uncle Isaac?"</p>

  <p>The reply came like a thunderclap.</p>

  <p>"Cleaning the silver."</p>

  <p>Bobbie reeled.</p>

  <p>"Cleaning the silver!" he said, dazed. "I'll wake up in a minute." He
  pinched himself, Mr. Superbus watching and ready to offer suggestions. They
  were unnecessary: Bobbie found a tender spot. "I'm awake&mdash;it's real.
  Uncle Isaac is cleaning the silver! Where are the servants&mdash;the other
  servants?"</p>

  <p>Julius could take exception at the "other."</p>

  <p>"Miss Ford sent them out, if you mean the servants. I'm here professional.
  I don't mind tellin' you, sir, that my job is to see that Uncle Isaac don't
  go out too."</p>

  <p>Bobbie began at last to see daylight. If it was Gordon, his desire for
  liberty was not only pardonable but praiseworthy.</p>

  <p>"Does he want to go?"</p>

  <p>Julius thought the question unnecessary. Surely a member of the family
  knew all about the family skeletons? At the same time it was only natural
  that he should pretend he didn't. Julius was a just man.</p>

  <p>"He's a bit nutty. See what I mean? He's got delusions,
  hallucinations&mdash;to use a medical expression. Sees things, thinks he's
  somebody else. I've had hundreds of such cases through my hands."</p>

  <p>"But who put him to clean the silver?" insisted Bobbie.</p>

  <p>"Miss Ford. Said it would keep him occupied."</p>

  <p>A step in the hall, a heavy step.</p>

  <p>"That's him coming now. Don't be afraid of Uncle Isaac, sir: he's as
  harmless as a child&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gordon came in at that moment, but stopped dead at the sight of the
  visitor. He was in his shirt-sleeves, he carried a duster in his hand, his
  front was covered with a large white apron and a bib that was kept in place
  by a pin. Bobbie could not speak&mdash;he could only stare and stare.</p>

  <p>"By heavens, it's&mdash;Uncle Isaac!" he said in a voice that was almost
  inaudible to Mr. Superbus.</p>

  <p>"You know him, sir?" he smiled. "I thought it would be very strange if you
  didn't. Members of the same family, so to speak, and very likely inflicted in
  the same way."</p>

  <p>"Ye-yes, I know him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus approached the unhappy object of their discussion.</p>

  <p>"Do you want something. Uncle Isaac?" he asked kindly, and patted Gordon's
  arm. So broken was Mr. Selsbury's spirit that his keeper remained alive and
  uninjured.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;no," he said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>Julius shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He can't make up his mind about anything. It takes you that way. I wonder
  how he ever got married."</p>

  <p>Gordon steadied himself.</p>

  <p>"Where is&mdash;Aunt Lizzie?" he gulped.</p>

  <p>"In her room, Uncle Isaac, reading."</p>

  <p>For a second Gordon's face was contorted.</p>

  <p>"Don't call me uncle," he grated, holding himself in hand. "I'm not your
  uncle, anyway."</p>

  <p>"No, sir," admitted Julius. "I haven't got any uncles. Not as far as I
  know. They run in some families and they don't run in others."</p>

  <p>Suddenly his brow clouded, and he glared at Gordon with such intense
  malignity that even Bobbie quailed.</p>

  <p>"Here&mdash;I've just got an idea in my head, sir," he slowly, "a sort of
  inspiration. Is that Uncle Isaac?"</p>

  <p>Bobbie started.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know Uncle Isaac?" The idea or inspiration had taken firm hold of
  his imagination. "Suppose Double Dan was passin' himself off as him!"</p>

  <p>Bobbie looked past the man to his brother. Gordon was frowning and shaking
  his head. He wished to keep in the character of the patriarch for some
  extraordinary reason.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," said Bobbie, "that is Uncle Isaac." He was almost
  breathless.</p>

  <p>Julius was not immediately convinced.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?" dubiously.</p>

  <p>Bobbie became very confident.</p>

  <p>"Oh, rather! That is Uncle Isaac all right&mdash;how absurd, of course it
  is Uncle Isaac. I knew him in a minute."</p>

  <p>No man readily sacrifices his inspirations&mdash;Julius was but human,
  though there were moments when this was hard to believe.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" he said disappointedly. "Mind you, Double Dan's clever."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" said Bobbie with loud scorn. "He couldn't impersonate Uncle
  Isaac. I would know him anywhere!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, couldn't he...!" sneered Superbus. "You don't know Double Dan!"</p>

  <p>Bobbie had done some quick thinking. He must talk to Gordon alone. Mr.
  Superbus being impervious to the hints which followed:</p>

  <p>"I want to have a little talk with my uncle," said Bobbie, "on family
  business. Do you mind leaving us alone for a minute?"</p>

  <p>Julius was in two minds about the matter.</p>

  <p>"Don't let him escape," he cautioned. "He's as artful as a monkey! You
  ought to hear what he did to me last night!"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not." Bobbie was ready to promise that he would bring his
  brother to execution.</p>

  <p>Still Mr. Superbus lingered. Diana had gone out, leaving instructions
  which were to be carried out to the letter. Julius was a stickler for
  duty.</p>

  <p>"And don't let him telephone."</p>

  <p>Even this Bobbie promised, and Julius took a reluctant leave.</p>

  <p>"I'll be on hand if he's troublesome," he said from the doorway. "Now, no
  larks, uncle!"</p>

  <p>"Uncle" mutely promised.</p>

  <p>The portal closed, Bobbie went softly and listened. For a few seconds he
  waited, and then jerked open the door. Julius was stooping to lace his shoes.
  A less inquisitive man might have been suspected of having his ear to the
  keyhole.</p>

  <p>"Want me?" he asked with a blameless smile.</p>

  <p>"No," said Bobbie, so emphatically that Mr. Superbus could not mistake his
  meaning. The door closed again.</p>

  <p>"Gordon, what on earth?"</p>

  <p>Gordon threw out despairing arms.</p>

  <p>"Bobbie, I'm in a hell of a mess," he said, his tone one of anguish beyond
  remedy.</p>

  <p>"What has happened&mdash;what does it mean?" asked the bewildered Bobbie.
  "Why didn't you get in touch with me before?"</p>

  <p>Gordon's gesture cut short his questioning.</p>

  <p>"I tried to telephone you, but I couldn't get on, and ever since, that
  infernal jackass has been keeping guard over the instrument. Is it a crime to
  kill an amateur detective? I've forgotten. I know that in some circumstances
  murder is justifiable."</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" asked Bobbie again.</p>

  <p>For fully three minutes Gordon paced the room, so agitated that he could
  not steady his voice. His relief at Bobbie's arrival had brought the
  inevitable reaction. Presently he grew calmer.</p>

  <p>"When I got to the station to meet&mdash;you know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Heloise?"</p>

  <p>Gordon winced. He didn't want to talk about Heloise. The very sound of her
  name gave him a little pain.</p>

  <p>"I found her in a state of terrible fear. You can imagine how I felt when
  she told me that her husband was watching the barriers and thirsting for my
  blood! She wanted me to go on and await her, but of course I bolted back;
  went to the hotel to change, and found that the valet who had my bag and had
  taken it to the station parcels office, was away for the week-end. I came
  home, and she must have followed."</p>

  <p>"Heloise?"</p>

  <p>Gordon swallowed something.</p>

  <p>"Say 'she' or 'her,'" he begged. "I feel better about her when she's a
  pronoun!"</p>

  <p>"She must have followed?" repeated Bobbie in horror. "Then she is here!
  She&mdash;she isn't Aunt Lizzie by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"She is Aunt Lizzie! Aunt Lizzie! Oh, Bobbie, isn't this the most awful
  thing that ever happened? What am I going to do? I can't leave the
  house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But why?" asked Bobbie, thunderstruck.</p>

  <p>No man stood less in need of cross-examination at that moment than Gordon.
  He had hopes that Bobbie, with his curious insight into human affairs, would
  accept the situation without demanding analysis.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand," began Bobbie. "You've only to explain to
  Diana&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gordon's laugh was harsh. Bobbie had heard him laugh once before like
  that&mdash;when he was recovering from gas after having a tooth out.</p>

  <p>"I haven't told you the worst," said Gordon gloomily. "Diana found me here
  and accused me of being Double Dan. I was struck dumb. The idea was so
  grotesque that I could not find words to answer her. Suppose somebody came to
  you in the street and accused you of murder, what would you say? Something
  amusing? I haven't the gift of persiflage. I could have got out of it even
  then, but that infernal woman made her appearance and hung round my neck! In
  a sense she was justified. Diana threatened to shoot her. A woman doesn't
  like that. What was I to do? My dilemma was a terrible one! I had the
  alternative of admitting that I was Double Dan, impersonator and teller of
  plausible stories, or of telling the unbelievable truth, which means that she
  would have thought that I was engaged in a vulgar affair with Heloise."</p>

  <p>This argument seemed very sound to Bobbie.</p>

  <p>"Who called her Aunt Lizzie?" he asked. He might have saved himself the
  trouble.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think?" asked Gordon bitterly. "Diana! Bobbie, that girl is
  driving me mad! Why did she come from Australia to upset my life? And I'm a
  member of the British Empire League! Curse the Empire! Diana is terrible! She
  is carrying on with Dempsi under my eyes. The most shocking little cad! A
  bounder of bounders! And Bobbie, she pretends to be a widow! I don't know
  whose widow&mdash;I sometimes think it is mine. If that is so, the things she
  says about me are enough to make me turn in my grave!"</p>

  <p>Bobbie was very grave and thoughtful. This was a situation so bizarre that
  it could not be tested by his own experience.</p>

  <p>"I see," he said slowly. "Deuced awkward, old man."</p>

  <p>Gordon had expected some other comment. In all the conditions "deuced
  awkward" seemed rather mild.</p>

  <p>"You've got to help me get out of this," he said impatiently. "And we've
  got to deal drastically with Dempsi. Why, he wanted to marry her this
  afternoon! Said he knew a place that specialised in Sunday afternoon
  marriages! The parson called twice! Dempsi carries a special license in his
  pocket, the hateful little dago! I shall do something desperate. I shall
  shoot them both."</p>

  <p>Bobbie was looking at him curiously. His real anger was so patently
  directed toward Dempsi, whose chief offence seemed to be that he wanted to
  marry Diana: which seemed a reasonable and laudable ambition.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't shoot them," said Bobbie slowly. "You'll only get yourself
  talked about. And besides, I don't see that it is any business of yours. They
  were old friends, lovers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you want to drive me mad?" snarled Gordon. "Lovers! They were never
  lovers! Diana&mdash;Diana, of all women in the world, to&mdash;to&mdash;carry
  on like this! Encouraging him&mdash;there's no other word for it! Diana, whom
  I believed the very soul of modesty!"</p>

  <p>Bobbie had no especial interest in Diana's soul; he thought she was a nice
  girl.</p>

  <p>"It must have come as a bit of a shock to you," he said sardonically, and
  Gordon was hurt at the innuendo. "What does Aunt Lizzie say about it?"</p>

  <p>This was a subject on which he could not speak with normal politeness.</p>

  <p>"Does it matter what she says? Bobbie, do you know what Diana tried to do?
  And this reveals an undreamt-of indelicacy of mind. She tried to give us the
  same room! A wretched little servants' room at the top of the house. She says
  that Heloise is my accomplice.... It's no laughing matter!" Bobbie was
  rolling helplessly in his chair. "Diana is treating me like a dog."</p>

  <p>Bobbie surveyed his relative critically.</p>

  <p>"And you look a bit of a dog too in those clothes," he said. "Where did
  you dig up that suit? Gordon, I've seen a judge send down a man for five
  years for wearing a suit like that. He said it revealed his criminal
  psychology."</p>

  <p>"Now, Bobbie, you've got to help me." Gordon was not amused. "I'm going to
  get away. Once I can get to the hotel to my bag, or even if I could get to
  Scotland&mdash;which wouldn't be a bad move&mdash;I'm safe. But I haven't a
  penny! She made me turn out my pockets at the point of a pistol. She is the
  most thorough woman I have ever met. Swore that I had been trying to get at
  the safe and searched me for skeleton keys!"</p>

  <p>Bobbie felt in his pockets. The trip to Ostend had exhausted most of the
  spare cash&mdash;and it was Sunday.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've no money with me," he said. "I can get a cheque cashed at
  the club for a tenner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That doesn't matter," interrupted Gordon. "I'll tell you what I want you
  to do&mdash;a very simple service that you can render and will save all
  bother. When Diana comes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here, Bobbie thought the solution was a very simple one.</p>

  <p>"When she comes I'll just tell her that you're really Gordon Selsbury," he
  said, and Gordon leapt up from the chair where he had been sitting.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to ruin me?" he hissed. "Tell her I'm Gordon Selsbury? I've
  told her, haven't I? But I gave up telling her when I remembered Heloise. How
  am I going to explain her?"</p>

  <p>The crux of the problem was now displayed. Bobbie had no cut and dried
  solution. Such as presented were so nobbly and damp that he rejected them
  without examination.</p>

  <p>"I'd forgotten about Aunt Lizzie," he said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>Gordon's triumph brought little happiness to him.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see it's impossible? Now, I've been thinking the matter over
  and I've worked out a much better plan than yours. I can get away when this
  dithering old ass isn't looking&mdash;which is pretty often. Diana has to go
  out early tomorrow to her bankers. That will be my chance, but I must have
  some money. I want it before the banks open, so you cannot possibly help me
  there. What you can do is this: persuade Diana to let you have the key of the
  safe. She's put the lock on as well as the combination. I've tried to open
  it, so I know. Get the key and pass it to me at the first opportunity."</p>

  <p>Bobbie was looking at him very hard now, and Bobbie was whistling.</p>

  <p>"Give you the key of the safe?" he said slowly. "By Jove!" His eyes were
  bulging, his jaw had dropped.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" demanded Gordon with a sinking feeling in his
  heart.</p>

  <p>Slowly and distinctly the words came.</p>

  <p>"You infernal rascal!"</p>

  <p>Gordon stepped back as if he had been struck.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he gasped. Yet he could not mistake the meaning of
  words and looks.</p>

  <p>Bobbie's attitude had undergone a remarkable change. The friendliness had
  gone from his tone, the light of fun from his face. He glared at the man
  before him; judgment and condemnation and doom was in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are Double Dan!" he breathed. "By jinks! I was deceived! You're
  clever, my man, diabolically clever. Carslake said you were, and like a fool
  I thought he was exaggerating. You are Double Dan! My brother has whiskers!
  Where are yours? I thought there was something strange about you when I saw
  you. And now that I come to think of it, that cock-and-bull story of yours
  about Aunt Lizzie is just the kind of story you would tell if you were
  detected&mdash;phew! Bravo, little Diana!"</p>

  <p>Gordon went purple and red; he uttered strange, wild animal noises that
  had no meaning.</p>

  <p>"I swear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bobbie shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It won't do, my friend," he said. "I see the whole plot. Of course, you
  and your accomplice pumped my unfortunate brother, who is on his way to Paris
  or some other unreachable place. You discovered that I knew he was going to
  Ostend, and you changed your plans. Gordon went to Paris as I
  feared&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Alone?"</p>

  <p>Gordon was becoming an adept in self-control. Alone? That was a poser for
  Bobbie.</p>

  <p>"I didn't think of that. But there's no reason why part of your original
  story shouldn't be true. The husband appears, the lady begs the victim to go
  and she will follow. That is it!"</p>

  <p>"I tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bobbie stopped his protest.</p>

  <p>"No, no, my man, it won't do," he said sternly. "My cousin, Miss Ford, who
  has so cleverly trapped you, must have some special reason for not wishing to
  hand you over to justice&mdash;had I been she, I would have sent for the
  police. She has probably taken the wisest course&mdash;I will not interfere
  with her plans."</p>

  <p>He laughed softly&mdash;Gordon thought that the immaculate agriculturist
  Abel must have laughed like that; there was something to be said for
  Cain.</p>

  <p>"Give you the key of the safe, eh? I was nearly deceived; upon my word, I
  was. Now go on with your dusting, little man, and thank your lucky stars
  you're not in prison."</p>

  <p>Gordon went on with his dusting&mdash;he dusted the perspiration from his
  brow, and the duster was not particularly clean. The result was
  startling.</p>

  <p>"Bobbie!" he wailed.</p>

  <p>Bobbie turned on his heel.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to kick you?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Evidently Gordon didn't. He began to rub the back of a chair listlessly.
  He had no heart in his work, and without enthusiasm even dusting is a
  failure.</p>

  <p>Bobbie opened the door and found Mr. Superbus sitting on the bottom stair,
  manicuring his nails with a clasp-knife.</p>

  <p>"Giving you any trouble, sir?" he asked eagerly, and was disappointed when
  Bobbie Selsbury shook his head.</p>

  <p>"None whatever." He walked back into the room. "Now then. Uncle Isaac,
  clear out!"</p>

  <p>"Did he try to escape, sir?" asked the interested custodian.</p>

  <p>Bobbie laughed his Cain and Abel laugh. His brother wondered where Diana
  kept her little gun.</p>

  <p>"Did he try to escape? I should jolly well say he did!" said Bobbie. "Look
  after him, Mr. Superbus. You have in your able hands a man of singular
  cunning and resource."</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"You're a naughty old Uncle Isaac, that's what you are," he said. "I'm
  surprised at you."</p>

  <p>Gordon collected his dusters and staggered from the room. He was at the
  end of his dream.</p>

  <p>"I'm a naughty old Uncle Isaac," he moaned. "I'm a naughty old Uncle
  Isaac!"</p>

  <p>His moan came up from the deep recesses of the kitchen.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Bobbie!"</p>

  <p>The girl came toward him with both hands outstretched. Behind her in the
  hall he saw a strange shadow.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, dear! I came as soon as you wanted me, I hope?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Dempsi was now visible. His black sombrero gave him a sinister
  appearance. His voice was querulous, his manner menacing.</p>

  <p>"Dear?" he asked deeply. "Who calls you 'dear'? What is this man to you,
  Diana?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Dempsi," she said wearily, "this gentleman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But he was furious; flung his hat on the ground and swung his cloak from
  him with the air of a caballero. Bobbie expected to see a belt with knives
  and pistols&mdash;the poker dot waistcoat was an anticlimax.</p>

  <p>"I will not endure it," he stormed. "Do you hear, sir? You address this
  lady as dear&mdash;explain!"</p>

  <p>She saved Bobbie the trouble.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Selsbury, my cousin." Diana was dangerously quiet. Probably
  Mr. Dempsi, from his long acquaintance with her, recognised the signs.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Your cousin! I see the likeness. The same beautiful eyes, the same
  firm but gentle mouth. The slight figure, the lovely hand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bobbie was annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much, but when you've finished cataloguing my features and
  describing my delectable points, perhaps you'll tell me who you are?"</p>

  <p>He was antagonistic, and he needed no introduction. For he knew the
  bearded man, and shared the spurious Gordon's resentment and utter
  dislike.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Dempsi," said Diana. "You've heard me speak of him?"</p>

  <p>There was an appeal in her eyes which Bobbie could not resist. He made a
  show of being happy to meet Mr. Dempsi. As an effort of simulation it was a
  failure.</p>

  <p>"Won't you change your coat, Wop&mdash;Wopsy&mdash;upstairs?" she
  suggested.</p>

  <p>Dempsi kissed her hand.</p>

  <p>"My beloved&mdash;I go. Your word is law! Sir&mdash;cousin&mdash;Bobbie,
  forgive me."</p>

  <p>Bobbie forced a smile of friendliness. His gentle cousin thought he was
  ill.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dempsi went singing up the stairs: Donna e mobile was the song. He
  sang it happily and flatly, as though his throat rebelled against this
  rejoicing in the fickleness of woman.</p>

  <p>"Suffering cats!" said Bobbie, awe-stricken. "Is that the First Love?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"And is that his style of conversation&mdash;a bit wearing, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Wearing? Bobbie, he's just like that to every man who looks at me! He's
  changed in appearance&mdash;I suppose six years makes an awful difference. I
  used to think there was room for nothing but improvement, for he was only a
  boy then. But, oh, Bobbie, he's worse! He wanted to strangle the waiter at
  the Ritz- Carlton at lunch because he was rather good-looking and had a sense
  of humour&mdash;he smiled when I made a feeble joke. And, Bobbie, Double
  Dan&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She saw that Bobbie knew, and sighed gratefully. Bobbie was to be a tower
  of strength: she had guessed that all along.</p>

  <p>"He's here," said the young man.</p>

  <p>"You've seen him? Thank heavens! He is like Gordon, isn't he? The make-up
  is astounding. I've tried to find out the secret. But he's so useful about
  the house. That alone betrays him. Gordon lived in the clouds, where there
  were no laundry bills and no patent sweepers. And he came in time to be Uncle
  Isaac. No, we haven't any real Uncle Isaac, but he served beautifully, and,
  what is more, he brought with him a perfectly good aunt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The audacious scoundrel!" Bobbie cried wrathfully. "Why, do you know, he
  nearly deceived me? I wasn't as clever as you. I talked with him for ten
  minutes about his troubles. He's evidently studied every detail of appearance
  and association. And he makes no mistakes&mdash;he called me Bobbie the first
  time he saw me."</p>

  <p>"He called me Diana. But he didn't deceive me&mdash;not for a moment,"
  said the girl, flopping into Gordon's big chair. "This morning I caught him
  trying to get into Gordon's dressing-room! He has to be watched day and
  night, and of course he has a perfectly good excuse for everything he does.
  He said he wanted some clothes!"</p>

  <p>Bobbie thought that a desire to change into clothing less vocal than the
  suit he was wearing was not reprehensible even in Double Dan. But the
  audacity of the man!</p>

  <p>"The villain! I wish to heaven I hadn't gone to Ostend."</p>

  <p>She reminded herself that she must ask him why he went at all. That could
  wait, however.</p>

  <p>"I had to arrange everything on the spot," she said, going back to the
  hectic moments of Saturday. "Luckily I remembered that little man's 'phone
  number&mdash;you weren't here when he told me? Hate, hate, ho, Ammersmith.
  Then I had to invent a story&mdash;oh, positively dozens of stories! They
  weren't lies&mdash;just expedients. The stroke of genius was the one about
  Uncle Isaac being eccentric. Happily Dempsi loves him."</p>

  <p>"Who?" asked the startled Bobbie. "Not Uncle Isaac surely? He gave me the
  impression&mdash;but that was in his role of Gordon&mdash;that he hated
  him."</p>

  <p>"No, I mean Superbus. He took to him at once&mdash;it was the sort of
  thing he would do. He kept white mice when he was a boy and adored them!
  Dempsi thinks that he and Mr. Superbus must have both descended from Julius
  Caesar. He spent all the morning in the book room searching for Caesar's
  Life."</p>

  <p>"How does Double Dan accept your treatment of him&mdash;and your discovery
  that he was a fake?"</p>

  <p>"That is the surprising thing," said Diana in wonder. "He was meekness
  itself&mdash;I never saw a man so quickly accept a situation as he did."</p>

  <p>"And the perfectly good aunt?"</p>

  <p>Diana shrugged.</p>

  <p>"She was difficult. That is natural, being a woman. But she is tame now. I
  called her Aunt Lizzie to save a scandal. But"&mdash;her voice
  sank&mdash;"they're not married!"</p>

  <p>Bobbie tried hard to look surprised.</p>

  <p>"Aren't they?"</p>

  <p>Diana shook her head. There was some good Puritan blood in the Fords.
  Bobbie never received evidence of its presence without a little shock of
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"No! Isn't it terrible? They're not married. They are not even engaged: I
  could tell that by the way she orders him about. She does so with the air of
  a woman who has nothing to lose. But I'm determined on one thing. I thought
  it out before I went to bed. He shall marry her before he leaves this house!
  She has been hopelessly compromised. This adventure shall have one good
  result."</p>

  <p>Bobbie was not enthusiastic.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't meddle if I were you," he said, but made no impression on
  her.</p>

  <p>Gordon Selsbury came into the room unnoticed. He carried a dustpan and a
  short- handled broom. He stood for a while irresolutely, neither of the pair
  noticing him. Then:</p>

  <p>"Have you heard from Gordon?"</p>

  <p>Her face lit up.</p>

  <p>"I've had the loveliest wires from him. Really he has been most
  thoughtful! The dear man has telegraphed from almost every station."</p>

  <p>Bobbie coughed.</p>

  <p>"Somehow I thought he would," he said.</p>

  <p>She was searching her handbag and brought out a folded paper.</p>

  <p>"Here is the last, from Crewe; it didn't arrive until ten o'clock this
  morning. 'Having a comfortable journey. Hope everything is going
  smoothly&mdash;Gordon.'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bobbie sat up.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I say, that's too bad," he protested warmly&mdash;too warmly, he
  realised. "I mean, it's too bad that didn't arrive until to-day. Write to the
  Post Office."</p>

  <p>Gordon growled under his breath, and took another step into the room.
  Diana saw him, but made no sign. He was one with the furniture.</p>

  <p>"If he'd only stay away for another week!" she sighed.</p>

  <p>It was the opportunity for which Bobbie had hoped.</p>

  <p>"You know, old Gordon isn't such a bad chap," he said. "I know one's first
  impression is that he is a terrible prig, and his manner is bad, I admit; and
  he's a thought conceited. These intellectuals are. Though why, I've never
  understood."</p>

  <p>She shook her head. Evidently she had already found excuses for Gordon,
  and there was no need for his championship.</p>

  <p>"Conceited? But most men are, don't you think? I wouldn't call it
  conceit&mdash;he's a little self-important, that's all."</p>

  <p>The hand that wielded the broom trembled, the dust-pan wobbled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose that's what he is," said Bobbie thoughtfully. "Gordon was
  rather spoilt as a kid, and that makes a man a little self-important."</p>

  <p>"And Pharisaical, don't you think?" suggested Diana, considering. "I ought
  not to say anything unkind. Really I'm not. He isn't any worse for our
  frankness."</p>

  <p>Mr. Gordon Selsbury half rose from his knees, his mouth working, his face
  pale with fury.</p>

  <p>"I'm inclined to agree with you," said Bobbie regretfully. "And poor old
  Gordon has faults."</p>

  <p>"The faults of age," said Diana. "He's the sort of man who has been forty-
  five ever since he was born; but, thank God, he's not flighty!" she added
  piously.</p>

  <p>The sweeper nodded in agreement, but his faint smile was to vanish.</p>

  <p>"Don't put any man on a pedestal, my dear," said Bobbie in the paternal
  manner.</p>

  <p>"Sneak!" said Gordon fiercely but inaudibly.</p>

  <p>"The best of men make mistakes," the traitor brother continued. "His very
  innocence is a disadvantage. I could well imagine that a woman with the right
  line of talk could twist him round her little finger!"</p>

  <p>She dissented. Diana had her own views, and they were mainly
  unbendable.</p>

  <p>"If I were his wife I should trust Gordon, Bobbie," she said seriously.
  "He's the very soul of honour. Whatever you say of Gordon, you've got to
  admit he's that. He wouldn't do anything undignified or vulgar. I could
  imagine many things, but I could not imagine Gordon going to Ostend, even in
  a mood of theosophical ecstasy, without a chaperone."</p>

  <p>Bobbie shifted uneasily. He was by nature honest, in spite of his being a
  tea- broker. There were certain fundamentals in his code with which he could
  not dispense, even to shield Gordon.</p>

  <p>"N-no, perhaps not," he said.</p>

  <p>She smiled scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps! You know he wouldn't, Bobbie! I can't think of his doing a thing
  like that. Why, Gordon is the very antithesis of vulgarity! Could you imagine
  him engaged in a clandestine friendship with a woman like Aunt Lizzie? It is
  absurd. Can you imagine him walking into this house with a strange female and
  pretending that he doesn't know her when he is detected? I should imagine
  not!"</p>

  <p>Still Bobbie had a duty to perform.</p>

  <p>"I think you're mad to trust any man absolutely," he said firmly. "No man
  is worthy of that confidence."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"You're a cynical bachelor."</p>

  <p>A voice came from the background. An indignant and an emphatic voice.</p>

  <p>"That is just what I say," said Gordon. "I can't imagine a more immoral
  point of view, striking at the very roots&mdash;er&mdash;um&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He almost cringed under Diana's gaze.</p>

  <p>"How dare you interrupt?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bobbie took a hand.</p>

  <p>"Now see here, my friend, you take my advice and drop this pretence," he
  said gravely. "You will deceive nobody&mdash;though I can understand why you
  have not given up hope&mdash;and you may get yourself into very serious
  trouble. If I had my way, you would be in that position at this moment, but
  my cousin, for an excellent reason, has refrained from handing you over to
  the police. That generosity ought to be appreciated by you."</p>

  <p>Gordon set his teeth, cast broom and brush to the devil and leapt up.</p>

  <p>"I don't care&mdash;I will tell the truth," he said doggedly. "In spite of
  everything&mdash;in spite of all appearances, I am Gordon Selsbury."</p>

  <p>He looked round: Superbus was at the door, a buff envelope in his hand. It
  was no use; he went down on his knees and groped for the dustpan. He was
  beaten.</p>

  <p>"A wire for you, ma'am. I never knew they came on Sunday."</p>

  <p>She took the envelope and tore it open.</p>

  <p>"Another! 'Aberdeen. Very good journey and looking forward to my return.
  Gordon.'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bobbie gaped.</p>

  <p>"What an artist!" he said.</p>

  <p>She turned on him with a frown.</p>

  <p>"I say, what a nasty journey!" corrected Bobbie.</p>

  <p>She nodded slowly, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, I'm beginning to feel quite different toward Gordon," she
  said.</p>

  <p>The sweeper sat up on his heels expectantly. For a second she became
  conscious of his presence.</p>

  <p>"Well, what are you waiting for?" she asked coldly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing." The despairing man stooped to his task.</p>

  <p>"Where is your&mdash;your accomplice?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Gordon turned his head.</p>

  <p>"She's reading&mdash;'How to be Happy though Married,'" he said
  cynically.</p>

  <p>Kindness was wasted on such a man.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with Dempsi?" asked Bobbie, leaning across and
  dropping his voice.</p>

  <p>She made a little face.</p>

  <p>"I'm in despair, Bobbie. I can't count on his losing himself again. The
  only thing he shows any signs of losing is his head&mdash;and I never knew
  him when he had one worth losing. Well?"</p>

  <p>It was Superbus again. She wished he wouldn't put his hand on his heart
  before he bowed.</p>

  <p>"That parson gentleman's called again," he said in a hoarse whisper. "He's
  the Vicar of Banhurst."</p>

  <p>Superbus was country-bred and was schooled in the values of ecclesiastical
  rank. The Vicar of Banhurst was a person of eminence. To Diana he was part of
  the marriage trap. The steel grille that would cut her off from freedom. She
  was panic-stricken by his very presence in the house.</p>

  <p>"Tell him I'm ill," she said frantically. "Tell him&mdash;I'm&mdash;I'm
  very ill. Ask him to come tomorrow. And please, please don't tell Mr. Dempsi
  he is here."</p>

  <p>"He said if you'd call him up&mdash;" Superbus offered tentatively the
  clerical card. She waved it away.</p>

  <p>"I don't want his address&mdash;I don't want it!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus did his bow and went out. Her face was the picture of
  woe.</p>

  <p>"Bobbie, what am I to do? That's the third time he's called to-day."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"The clergyman. Dempsi's idea! He thinks our marriage is a matter of
  hours! It is so like Dempsi, so absurdly, so tragically mad; but he'd hardly
  been with me two minutes before he told me he was sending for the parson to
  'make us one'! And I know which one! I read the review of a book to-day by a
  man whose name I forget. It doesn't matter. He says that there are conditions
  in which assassination is the purest and noblest expression of public
  sentiment. Will you get it for me?"</p>

  <p>"But he couldn't marry you in the evening," persisted Bobbie. "It is
  against the law."</p>

  <p>She was darkly amused.</p>

  <p>"Against the law! What is a little thing like that to Dempsi? He is the
  law!"</p>

  <p>"It seems a simple matter to get him away." Bobbie searched his mind for a
  solution. "Have you any plan?"</p>

  <p>Had she any plan? Was there a moment of consciousness in the day that she
  did not form a new scheme to rid herself of her electric incubus?</p>

  <p>"I've a hundred, and they're all futile and foolish. I thought of running
  away. That seems about the only sane idea I have had."</p>

  <p>"Running away? To where?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"To Scotland. To join Gordon."</p>

  <p>Bobbie jumped up, a very perturbed young man.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't do that!" he cried. "Whatever you do, don't do that, Diana!
  In the first place, none of us knows where he is; in the second
  place&mdash;well... I shouldn't do it."</p>

  <p>Her eyebrows rose.</p>

  <p>"Why not? I could tell Gordon the whole truth, and I'm sure he would be
  nice and sympathetic. I feel very sure of Gordon in a great crisis like
  this&mdash;it is a very dear feeling to have." She smiled a little
  pathetically.</p>

  <p>"Suppose Dempsi followed you&mdash;and he certainly would," urged Bobbie.
  "Suppose he found that you'd deceived him, and came upon you on the moors
  with Gordon?"</p>

  <p>The smile deepened; into her eyes came a faraway look.</p>

  <p>"That's an idea. Gordon would have his gun on the moors," she said. "Hush!
  Here he comes."</p>

  <p>Bobbie had agreed readily to stay the night, for the great Superbus was
  tired, being human, as he explained, and having only one pair of eyes that
  needed rest.</p>

  <p>There was a slight scene at dinner (Heloise cooked this, and Diana's
  respect for her increased).</p>

  <p>Dempsi, in his most extravagant mood, called for wine. He wanted wine, red
  wine&mdash;to drink the health of his bride. He demanded that it be red and
  rosy. That it bubbled with the laughter of sunny vineyards. That its hue be
  as of the warm, rich blood of youth, palpitating, pulsing, seething with
  love. This he said in so many words. Bobbie said something terse and
  offensive, and offered him a whisky and soda. Mr. Dempsi looked black, and
  Diana hastily intervened. But she might as well have attempted to stay the
  tide of time. Dempsi made a remarkably quick recovery; spoke tremulously of
  his happiness; kissed Diana's hand; gave her for the third time the history
  of his life.</p>

  <p>When he lay in the foul huts of the natives, recovering from his fever,
  when he searched the world through for traces of his lost love, when, under
  the starry skies of the Australian bush, he pressed on desperately, doggedly,
  unflinchingly, following the trail of his divine lady&mdash;this was the
  thought he had&mdash;Diana! That some day she should be his! The past sad
  years should be blotted out and forgotten. All the misery of life would
  vanish as in a cloud.</p>

  <p>"Rot!" said Bobbie.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dempsi dissolved into tears.</p>

  <p>"Really, Diana, I can't stand that fellow," said Bobbie, when the devoted
  lover had flooded from the room.</p>

  <p>Diana lay back limp in her chair, fanning herself with her
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Bobbie, he's&mdash;he's terrible!" she moaned. "Bobbie, there must be
  some other solution than murder?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Dempsi, in his temperamental way, recovered his equilibrium before he
  had crossed the hall. Julius Superbus was making up The Study-fire as he came
  in&mdash;Dempsi went straight to him, laid his hand on his shoulder, too
  overcome for speech.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my friend!" he murmured.</p>

  <p>Julius, at a loss for a suitable response, played for safety.</p>

  <p>"Good-evening, sir," he said, and patted his fellow Roman on the head.</p>

  <p>"The one friend I have in this house&mdash;the one understanding soul! The
  one honest creature that is faithful to my memory."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dempsi invariably spoke of himself as though he had recently returned
  from a brief holiday in heaven.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say that, sir," said Julius generously. "There are
  others."</p>

  <p>"I do say it! I, Giuseppe Dempsi! Who denies my right?" he demanded
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>Julius backed off.</p>

  <p>"Not me, sir, I'm sure," he said hastily. "It's the last thing in the
  world I'd dream of doing."</p>

  <p>Giuseppe grew gentle again.</p>

  <p>"The moment I saw you, I said: 'Here is a man with vision, a big man, a
  man of sensibility! Superbus has a heart, feeling, simpatico&mdash;a man of
  affairs, a keen-eyed officer of the law!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus moved uneasily. He had all an amateur detective's fear of
  misrepresentation. He coughed.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly an officer of the law, sir. In a sense I am, and in a sense
  I'm not, though I used to be when I was a bailiff in the County Court."</p>

  <p>Dempsi smiled.</p>

  <p>"But now you are a detective. A disciple of the immortal Holmes&mdash;what
  a man, what ingenuity! You are this&mdash;you told me?"</p>

  <p>Julius hastened to correct a wrong impression.</p>

  <p>"Private, sir, private. As I explained to you, sir, I was brought
  in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dempsi never allowed anybody else to talk.</p>

  <p>"To watch for a despicable scoundrel," said Dempsi hotly. "That such
  should be at liberty! Double Dan! Even his name is deplorable! Ah! You are
  surprised that I have heard of this violator of sanctuaries? You clever
  detective, you are astounded and flabbergasted that I also know of this
  pestiferous brigand? Superbus, I ask a favour: when you have discovered him,
  send for me."</p>

  <p>There was a significant glitter in his eyes. His half-closed hands already
  dripped with the blood of his victim. Mr. Superbus was spellbound.</p>

  <p>"Send for me," repeated Dempsi deliberately. "I haven't killed a man for
  years. But I will not speak of that. I am too sorry for his wife and family.
  I have a tender heart." He gazed at Julius in admiration. "So you are a
  detective! One of that great and silent army of watchers, everlastingly on
  duty, standing between peaceable citizens like Giuseppe Dempsi and the
  vultures who prey upon society!"</p>

  <p>Dempsi held out his hand. Mr. Superbus, his eyes modestly lowered, took
  it. He felt for once that he was being taken at a proper valuation. Dempsi
  was a man of the world, a Sir Hubert whose praise was praise indeed. Julius
  made a mental note of the words for future exhibition. At any moment Dempsi
  might switch off to an unimportant subject.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is a bit of a job," agreed Julius. "The public don't
  understand."</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't," said Mr. Dempsi scornfully.</p>

  <p>"We take some risks," Mr. Superbus went on. "You can't get about town
  without taking risks&mdash;I was nearly run over by a 'bus yesterday."</p>

  <p>Dempsi was impressed.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>Julius nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was&mdash;in the execution of me duty," he said. "I saw a suspicious
  looking man&mdash;he looked like a fellow that had been owing me money for
  years&mdash;and crossed the road to have a look at him." His gesture
  suggested a swerving motor 'bus. "As near as that," he said simply but
  impressively.</p>

  <p>Dempsi shuddered appropriately.</p>

  <p>"Ah, it is fine work! Have you brought many men to justice? I see you
  have, but it is too painful to talk about. I understand your fine
  feelings&mdash;you are worthy."</p>

  <p>"Well, I've brought them to the County Court," said Julius. "That's not
  exactly to justice. People who can't pay their bills and owe tradesmen
  money."</p>

  <p>The other regarded him in awe.</p>

  <p>"I wonder you can sleep at night," he said in a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>Julius smiled callously. He suggested thereby that the ruin of small
  litigants meant less to him than the indubitable fact that flies have corns
  and suffer from asthma.</p>

  <p>"They never get on my mind," he said; "and as for sleeping&mdash;I'm a
  pretty good sleeper; nothing disturbs me."</p>

  <p>He hoped, at any rate, that nothing would disturb him that night, for he
  was sleeping on a made-up bed in The Study. It was Diana's idea and he viewed
  all Diana's ideas with a suspicion which was, it must be confessed,
  justifiable.</p>

  <p>"Ah, a good conscience!" said Dempsi. "What a beautiful thing!"</p>

  <p>Mr, Superbus wasn't sure whether this admirable characteristic of his was
  due entirely to conscience.</p>

  <p>"A good digestion's got something to do with it," he said. "I'm a careful
  feeder."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," said Dempsi confidentially, "have you served her long&mdash;my
  queen?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus called up to memory his acquaintance with contemporary
  history.</p>

  <p>"I thought you had a king in Italy?" he said.</p>

  <p>Dempsi laughed.</p>

  <p>"No, no, you mistake me&mdash;my sweet lady&mdash;my Diana?" he asked
  softly. "I am jealous of your privilege in serving her."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you mean ma'am? No, I've only just got to know her."</p>

  <p>Dempsi changed the subject abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I will go to bed. To-night there is no lock upon my door. If Double Dan
  comes, you will let me know?"</p>

  <p>He need not ask that question. Given consciousness and the ability to
  scream, all the house would know from Julius that the monster had
  arrived.</p>

  <p>"Why, certainly. But I can manage him."</p>

  <p>Dempsi bit his lower lip, viewing his friend thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I shall know the moment the firing starts&mdash;at the first
  bang I will be by your side."</p>

  <p>Julius turned white. In moments of great excitement all great Romans go
  white. Caesar Borgia had that failing. And for the matter of that, so had
  Nero, the celebrated fire-bug.</p>

  <p>"Firing?" he asked faintly.</p>

  <p>Dempsi nodded.</p>

  <p>"He is armed&mdash;certain to be. But remember this&mdash;and let it be in
  your mind all the time; the thought may comfort you&mdash;when you fall I
  shall be ready to take your place."</p>

  <p>Julius stretched his neck forward.</p>

  <p>"When&mdash;when I fall?" he said unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"I'm not likely to fall if I keep to the carpets&mdash;it's the par-kay
  that does me in."</p>

  <p>"You will look up and see me"&mdash;Dempsi obviously relished the picture
  he drew&mdash;"perhaps the last thing you will ever see on
  earth&mdash;standing over your prostrate body, pierced, my poor Superbus, by
  a dozen bullets. I shall be there, face to face with your murderer!"</p>

  <p>Julius closed his eyes and his lips moved. Yet he was not at his
  devotional exercises. Before his horrified vision spread a veritable panorama
  of tragedy with one notable figure in the foreground somewhat inanimate.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"But you shall not die unavenged, my Superbus!"</p>

  <p>Dempsi's affectionate hand was on his arm. Julius moved away from the
  fire; he had gone suddenly hot.</p>

  <p>"You're sure he carries firearms?"</p>

  <p>Dempsi nodded.</p>

  <p>"Loaded? That's against the lore, sir. A man could be pinched for
  that."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dempsi treated the matter light-heartedly. Julius could not but feel
  that his indifference was almost criminal.</p>

  <p>"Certain," he said carelessly. "I've never met a desperado yet&mdash;and
  I've met a few&mdash;that didn't carry a loaded gun&mdash;generally throwing
  a hollow- nosed bullet. And they're pretty good shots."</p>

  <p>He appeared to take a pride in their marksmanship. Julius leered at
  him&mdash;there is no other description for the grimace.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose so," he said huskily. "Of course, my good lady&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dempsi did not let him finish. He became suddenly serious as though the
  gravity of the situation had forced itself upon him.</p>

  <p>"Your wife? Have no fear, Superbus," he said quickly. "She shall never
  want. I will make it my business to see that she is provided for. And your
  deed shall be commemorated: I promise you that. I myself have suffered from a
  thoughtless failure to immortalise my name. I have in my mind a great tablet
  of black marble, chaste of design. Simple yet grand. Plain, yet in a sense
  decorative. And an inscription in letters of gold:</p>

  <p>"'To the memory of Julius Superbus, A Hero, a Gentleman and a Roman.'"</p>

  <p>His voice trembled as he spoke. Already he stood before the monument in
  tears. Julius wiped the perspiration from his pale face.</p>

  <p>"Yes, very pretty," he said, and now his hoarseness was chronic. "As I was
  saying, my good lady will be pleased. She always had a good opinion of me,
  though she's never mentioned it. But at the same time, though I'm very much
  obliged to you, and nobody could be kinder about it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Can't you see her standing reading the inscription?" asked Dempsi in a
  hushed voice. "Can't you imagine her looking up to the slab&mdash;fixed in a
  respectable church, perhaps under a stained-glass window&mdash;with proud,
  shining eyes, her children by her side&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I haven't got any children," said Julius loudly.</p>

  <p>Dempsi spread out his expressive hands.</p>

  <p>"She may marry again," he said considerately. "She is probably in the
  prime of life. There may still be happiness for her."</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus sat down limply.</p>

  <p>"You ain't half putting the wind up me!" he said fretfully.</p>

  <p>Dempsi bent over him, speaking softly.</p>

  <p>"To-night I sleep in sound of your voice. Have no hesitation in calling
  me. Perhaps I may arrive in time to save you. I pray that this may be. I like
  you. We are&mdash;who knows?&mdash;kinsmen. He who strikes you, strikes
  me&mdash;Giuseppe Dempsi."</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus got up; his knees were without strength, his tongue was
  parched.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you're sleeping here, and Mr. Bobbie is sleeping here, there
  doesn't seem any call for me to stay, does there? Not that it worries me. Far
  from it. Danger is always welcome to a Superbus. It's my good lady I'm
  thinking of. I was going to sleep in this room. Seems silly."</p>

  <p>"I shall be on hand," said Mr. Dempsi, and examined the short-barrelled
  revolver he had taken from his hip pocket.</p>

  <p>Julius almost swooned.</p>

  <p>"I'm a match for any man of my own weight," he said, his voice trembling
  as he thought of the terrible risk which any burglar of his own weight would
  run, "if he'll only give me a chance. But they don't give you a chance.
  They're on you before you know where you are&mdash;is that fair?"</p>

  <p>Dempsi did not answer. Aunt Lizzie had chosen that moment to wander into
  the room. Julius seized the opportunity to steal from the unnecessary gaiety
  that shone through Mr. Dempsi's sympathy&mdash;his eagerness to frame
  epitaphs which Julius would never see, his coldblooded plottings for the
  future of his good lady.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The atmosphere of a kitchen, however clean and well-ordered
it may be, is
  calculated to pall on any man of intellect and genius. It needs the gross
  mind of a materialist, a man like the husband of Heloise (Gordon's expression
  was one of distaste as he thought of that man) to appreciate the lingering
  fragrance of long-baked and long-consumed pies, the everlasting aroma which
  the spluttering hot oven has sent forth from time to time through the years,
  to permeate the homely furniture, and through that medium to retain its
  delicate nidus for the joy of those lovers of good food to whom such smells
  were appetising.</p>

  <p>Gordon had read everything that was readable. He had skipped through two
  cookery books, and had read the old newspapers in the wood cupboard. The
  almanac above the kitchen range he knew by heart, so that he could have told
  you the exact date when everybody of importance was born, married or
  assassinated.</p>

  <p>Happily, he had seen little of Heloise and less of Diana. At the thought
  of Diana his expression changed from one of great sadness to one of intense
  malignity. And then he would laugh softly, for, despite all that had been
  said (and that in his hearing) he possessed a sense of humour. How remarkably
  capable she was! In his bitterest moments this fact worked out from the
  confusion of his resentment. And how lovely! Once he had tried to patronise
  her... he blushed at the memory. Suppose he hadn't gone away on this mad
  adventure, would he have recognised all her excellent qualities as he saw
  them now? It was doubtful. He was so keyed up, his nerves were stretched at
  such tension, that every note of her was detected and valued. And of course
  she was behaving in this outrageous way in his interest. He warmed at this
  thought. But Dempsi... his heart went back into the refrigerator.</p>

  <p>The door opened slowly and he looked up, hoping to see the subject of his
  thoughts. But he was to be disappointed. It was Heloise. She threw down the
  book she was carrying, tore off the selvedge of an old newspaper that lay on
  the table, and, by its aid and the kitchen fire, lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>He got up from the Windsor chair before the fire, and, without a word of
  thanks, she dropped into his place. She smoked, watching the fire. She was
  pretty too, but in a harder way. He felt just a little sorry for her....</p>

  <p>Presently Gordon broke into her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"You've landed me in a pretty fine mess," he said without heat.</p>

  <p>She looked up at him sideways, flicking the ash from her cigarette with a
  cute little snap of her forefinger.</p>

  <p>"I've landed you," she said ironically. "I like that&mdash;anyway, there's
  no call to get mad, Man."</p>

  <p>A cold chill ran down his spine at that familiar form of address.</p>

  <p>"I wish you wouldn't call me Man. It belongs to bobbed hair and empress
  gowns and art serge... and soul."</p>

  <p>She laughed quietly; she hadn't laughed for a long time.</p>

  <p>"You used to like me calling you Man&mdash;in the days of our spiritual
  freedom, when deep called to deep&mdash;oh, gee! I forget the mush! And only
  two days ago I was word-perfect&mdash;knew every line."</p>

  <p>Gordon riveted his shocked gaze upon her.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand... knew your lines? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>She was examining the cigarette between her fingers. He had a dreadful
  foreboding that a revelation was imminent.</p>

  <p>"I mean all that stuff we used to talk&mdash;the O Man! stuff and the O
  Woman! stuff. And about our being on planes, and affinities of souls. My, but
  I had a bad time trying not to go to sleep. You're different now&mdash;I
  kinder like you this way. I'm strong for common sense and nature. Man! I've
  been the making of you."</p>

  <p>"The breaking of me, you mean," he snapped, the old grievance revived. "If
  you hadn't come here, I could have explained everything to Diana&mdash;Miss
  Ford."</p>

  <p>"I like 'Diana' better," she said. "That young dame is surely no miss.
  She's either been married or she's studied first-hand. If I hadn't come!" She
  jerked up her head derisively.</p>

  <p>"Why did you?" he asked. Even now he half believed the story she had told.
  Illusions die hard, but she was mercifully sudden.</p>

  <p>"Because my man double-crossed me," she said coolly.</p>

  <p>Gordon could not believe the evidence of his ears.</p>

  <p>"Your man? Your husband, you mean?"</p>

  <p>She flung away the cigarette, stood up and stretched her hands about her
  head.</p>

  <p>"My husband is the straightest thing that ever happened," she answered.
  'I'm talking of Dan&mdash;Double Dan, you call him!"</p>

  <p>The tick-tick of the kitchen clock filled the interval.</p>

  <p>"You're working&mdash;with&mdash;Double&mdash;Dan?" he breathed. Even now
  he could not believe her.</p>

  <p>She smiled pityingly.</p>

  <p>"Surely," she nodded. "Why do you think I allowed myself to be made love
  to by you? Be honest with yourself and tell me what there is in your
  equipment that a woman could rave about?"</p>

  <p>He stammered a wrathful denial.</p>

  <p>"I didn't make love to you," said Gordon hotly. "We talked about things...
  and you... and me&mdash;about our tastes...."</p>

  <p>"If you had as much experience as I have," said Heloise, "you'd know that
  that was being made love to." She nodded wisely. "Maybe you didn't
  know&mdash;you know now."</p>

  <p>Gordon's anger was rising.</p>

  <p>"We talked on&mdash;on a higher plane," he said sharply. "We talked of...
  imponderable things. There was never... never a caress. I hardly held your
  hand. Do you suggest there was anything in our little talks about prehistoric
  creatures," he sneered, "or in our interchange of thought about the
  subconscious ego?"</p>

  <p>To his horror she nodded.</p>

  <p>"Sure! That's how highbrows make love. When they start in to tell me about
  the Dinornis and the Silurian age, I know they got a crush on me."</p>

  <p>She herself might have been a Dinornis or something equally extinct and
  terrible by his attitude toward her.</p>

  <p>"Then it was a plot to get me away?" he asked breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you know?" She was frankly surprised. "You're a slow
  thinker&mdash;but you're right! It was my job to get you away good and safe,
  and I could have done it, whilst Double Dan&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Impersonated me!"</p>

  <p>He saw all things clearly. Mysteries were mysteries no more. There was
  little left upon which a harassed man need speculate.</p>

  <p>Her face was sombre and brooding. Evidently she was thinking happily.</p>

  <p>"He put one over on me. Gosh! That fellow's mind is so constructed that he
  couldn't go straight if he was sliding down a tube! And I went into it with
  my eyes open&mdash;yes, sir. Some of the boys who'd worked with him and one
  of his partners told me he'd do it before I left Manhattan Island. I had my
  warning&mdash;but I'm one of those dames who know it all and I wouldn't
  believe 'em. That's the kind of mad woman I am. And all they said came true.
  Yesterday morning, when everything was fixed for me to tote you to Ostend, I
  went to see him to split the Mendlesohn money. No, I wasn't in that. But the
  little friend of mine who brought Father Eli to the verge of marriage had to
  go back home. Her eldest boy was ill, and I advanced her her share.
  Forty-sixty, that's how I shared, and how Freda had arranged to share. And
  that's how I paid her&mdash;and it was worth it. Freda put in a whole lot of
  good, solid work for that guy. Only interest he had in life was
  stamps&mdash;postal stamps. Freda studied those darned foolish things so that
  she jumped every time the postman knocked. Dan would part on terms&mdash;and
  I'm his friend! Used to be in the same touring company as me, back home!"</p>

  <p>Gordon was rubbing his head mechanically.</p>

  <p>"Your&mdash;your husband, is he?"</p>

  <p>Her scorn was visible.</p>

  <p>"My husband!" she scoffed. "Now listen! I'm a respectable married woman
  and you gotta remember that, Man! Married ten years. I've the daisiest little
  apartment over in New York&mdash;and a real nice lovely boy of a
  husband."</p>

  <p>"In New York?" he managed to ask.</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Why, he's not in New York now: he's in the State Penitentiary&mdash;an
  innocent man, as heaven is my judge! You know what these Central Office men
  are! They'd swear you into the chair for a nickel. And John could have got
  evidence that he was a sleep-walker. Yes, sir. He's been that way for years.
  When the bulls got him in Ackensmidt's Jewellery Store, he didn't know how he
  got there himself&mdash;he's one of the best singers in the Sing Sing Glee
  Party, is John. But he's due home in a month and naturally I'm going home to
  meet him."</p>

  <p>"But is he a&mdash;a thief?" he blurted.</p>

  <p>A pink and angry flush spread on the classic face of Heloise.</p>

  <p>"Say, where did you get all that personal stuff? Thief! John's no
  thief&mdash;he's had a lot of bad luck, I guess. But sleep-walking is at the
  bottom of it. When he's awake he wouldn't take anything unless he got a
  receipt for it. It's at nights he goes kinder crazy. No, sir, John is a
  gentleman&mdash;though he's on the register as a safe and strong-room
  expoit&mdash;expert."</p>

  <p>He was calmer now and prepared, if necessary, to enquire into the profits
  of the business.</p>

  <p>"He's a bank-smasher!" he said sagely. "How interesting! And of course he
  smashes the banks where he hasn't a deposit."</p>

  <p>The futility of his remark was palpable even to himself.</p>

  <p>"Sure thing. That's what John is. I used to work with him, but it got him
  rattled when I was around, so I fixed to work with Dan, who's a snake but a
  workman. I'll say that for him&mdash;he's all for business. Dan always treats
  his partner as a lady. When I've said that I come right to the end of Dan's
  attractions."</p>

  <p>She spoke as an actress might speak about a fellow member of the
  cast&mdash;without anger, fairly. Gordon stopped strumming funeral marches on
  the kitchen table and became alive to the realities.</p>

  <p>"But is Dan coming here?" he asked. "Disguised as me! Is&mdash;is that the
  game? What a blind idiot I was! And you, of course, were the decoy... and all
  that soul stuff, as you call it, was?"</p>

  <p>"Bunk," she said. "It would have been bunk anyway if I'd meant it. That
  kind of talk is never anything else."</p>

  <p>He was still helplessly puzzled.</p>

  <p>"But... why did you come here?"</p>

  <p>"Because I want my money back&mdash;the money I advanced to my little
  friend. And he just wouldn't split with me. Said he hadn't got Mendlesohn's
  cheque&mdash;can't you see Dan taking cheques? Said he was short of
  money&mdash;that fellow has got Ananias down for the count. Yes, sir. Why, he
  was so stuffed with bills you couldn't touch him without he crackled! He had
  so much money he had to carry it under his arm! When I told him I wouldn't go
  on till he'd settled the old account, he told me to go to blue blazes. Or
  some place. Said I'd no right to pay the girl, and that he'd finish the job
  without me. But he won't!"</p>

  <p>Gordon glowered down on her.</p>

  <p>"Why do you tell me this? Don't you realise that you've placed yourself in
  my hands?" he asked. "I have only to 'phone the police and you're
  finished!"</p>

  <p>She was not perturbed.</p>

  <p>"Man, you've got a head like a haunted house! Forget it&mdash;Uncle
  Isaac!"</p>

  <p>He wilted under the blow. Uncle Isaac! He was in a hopeless position.</p>

  <p>"How shall I recognise him&mdash;this Double Dan&mdash;when he comes? When
  do you expect him?"</p>

  <p>Whatever happened, Double Dan's scheme should be brought to failure, he
  decided.</p>

  <p>"Why, Dan sort of happens naturally," she said lazily. "I lift my tile to
  him every time. He is certainly the most artistic guy in the business. I
  can't let my feelings prejudice me. He a great artist. The Lord didn't give
  him any ideas about simple division, but we're not all born mathematicians.
  You'll not know him when he comes. He doesn't always pretend to be the sucker
  he's robbing. Sometimes he's a butler."</p>

  <p>Gordon started. Superbus! Yet it seemed impossible that a man could sink
  so low that he would impersonate the Roman.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;our stout friend the detective?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I've known him before to make up like a detective who's watching
  for him, and, what's more, get away with it. It's one of Dan's favourite
  disguises, and he's got others. I'm giving you a million dollars' worth of
  information, Man. You ought to thank me on your knees, but you won't. Another
  good one of his is to be a visiting clergyman&mdash;that's one of his best.
  He told me once that he'd made a quarter of a million dollars out of the
  church."</p>

  <p>"A minister&mdash;there's been one here to-day," said Gordon thoughtfully.
  "Why don't you turn King's evidence against him?"</p>

  <p>"State's evidence, I guess that means? No, sir. That means nothing to me,
  and you're insulting me by suggesting it. This is a private matter between D.
  D. and H. C.&mdash;Chowster is my name&mdash;my father was a Reverend
  Chowster of Minneapolis and I'm a high-school girl and don't forget it.
  Anyway, I'm just too much of a lady to start makin' entries in the squeal
  book. Birth and education count for something, Man."</p>

  <p>He covered his face with his hands.</p>

  <p>"What a fool I've been, what a fool!" he groaned.</p>

  <p>Heloise looked at him: in this mood he was interesting.</p>

  <p>"Why, I guess every man's a fool&mdash;he's born that way, and has got
  twen'y years to pull himself right before some woman comes along and spoils
  his chance. I used to know a boy in Ontario, where I was
  born&mdash;Minneapolis, I mean&mdash;who got right after he was married, but
  he was an exception. And he'd done the mischief then."</p>

  <p>"I'll not stand it," said Gordon between his teeth. "Whatever happens, I'm
  going to put a spoke in the wheel of this Double Dan."</p>

  <p>"You don't say?" She was politely intrigued.</p>

  <p>"Am I going to remain quietly by and see a couple of crooks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, say!" she protested.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;robbing society with impunity?"</p>

  <p>"That's fine. And if Dan gets busy he'll rob with any old thing that's
  handy. He's a genius that way. My John says that Dan could open a safe with a
  hairpin- -"</p>

  <p>"I'll report this to the police," said Gordon firmly. "I was a fool not to
  take this step before. It may mean exposure, it may mean social ruin; it will
  certainly mean..." He stopped before he came to the possible effect upon
  Diana. "I'll have you both in gaol&mdash;both of you."</p>

  <p>She was unaffected by his fury.</p>

  <p>"Honey bunch, oh honey!" she cooed. "Don't get mad, baby!"</p>

  <p>He turned on her in fury.</p>

  <p>"You've done your best to make Miss Ford think I'm&mdash;I'm something to
  you. I would have forgiven you everything but that."</p>

  <p>"Well, ain't you?" she drawled. "Ah, peachy boy, don't be mad at your
  little snookums! Smile, baby, show little toothsies."</p>

  <p>Diana, in the opening of the kitchen door, heard only this.</p>

  <p>"Will you kindly reserve your love-making until you are out of my house?"
  she asked severely.</p>

  <p>At the sound of her voice Gordon reeled. The final straw had dropped
  brutally upon a camel, already over-burdened.</p>

  <p>"Why, I don't know," said Heloise, her insolent gaze turned on the
  intruder. "It seems to me that a cook's got a right to a li'l bit of love,
  honey? I'll admit that Uncle Isaac ain't so cute as darling Wopsy. But he's a
  real nice boy in Aunt Lizzie's eyes."</p>

  <p>Gordon would have intervened, but his spirit was broken. He slunk into the
  scullery and dropped his aching head upon the knife-machine.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For once Diana was silenced. It was absurd that she should
attempt to
  justify herself to a woman of this character. Yet she did.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dempsi is&mdash;is a very dear friend. To compare your&mdash;oh, it's
  horrible!"</p>

  <p>She was sickened&mdash;the realisation of her own hypocrisy did not lessen
  the nausea. There was no comparison. Of the two men, Double Dan was the more
  appealing.</p>

  <p>No index of her mind went unread by the shrewd watcher.</p>

  <p>"I gotta stick by this anyhow. It's no vacation for me," said Heloise with
  a sigh.</p>

  <p>The effect was magical&mdash;the frown vanished from Diana's face and a
  soft light came to her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry for you sometimes," she said.</p>

  <p>Heloise raised her left shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Why, I'm sorry most times. Gee! It's a helluva life," she said
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>Diana's heart went out to the woman. Her loneliness, the atmosphere of
  tragedy which now enveloped her, called for tenderness and help.</p>

  <p>"I ought to have realised that," she said gently. "I'm sorry I was
  sharp."</p>

  <p>The great strategist is he who recognises the moment when his enemy is
  wavering. Heloise brought up her heavy guns.</p>

  <p>"I was a good woman before I met him," she said with a little sob. Gordon,
  a horrified listener, came gasping into the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you!"</p>

  <p>"Silence!"</p>

  <p>Under the flashing eyes of Diana Ford his courage failed. Like the
  fisherman's wife, he could only stand and watch and suffer.</p>

  <p>"He just naturally dragged me down." Heloise was playing for safety and
  freedom, and she was a champion player.</p>

  <p>Diana's voice quivered as she turned on the shrinking man.</p>

  <p>"You brute! To think that a man like you should be allowed to prey upon
  humanity! I suspected something like this! You are a human tiger, unfit to
  live&mdash;Why don't you leave him, Heloise?" she asked tenderly.</p>

  <p>Heloise wiped her eyes and sniffed.</p>

  <p>"He's got me&mdash;so." She put down her thumb suggestively. "That kind of
  man doesn't let up on a woman once she's in his power. She's his till
  doom."</p>

  <p>Gordon shuffled his feet and she stepped back, fear in her face.</p>

  <p>"Don't let him touch me!" she cried in terror.</p>

  <p>In another second Diana's arm was about her.</p>

  <p>"Stand back," she said sternly. "Does he&mdash;does he strike you?"</p>

  <p>Heloise nodded with just that show of reluctance that was so
  convincing.</p>

  <p>"I'm just black and blue sometimes," she wept. "He'll beat me for this,
  sure. Don't trouble about me. Miss Ford&mdash;I'm naturally worthless. I must
  stand by Dan to the end of the chapter&mdash;heaven help me!"</p>

  <p>"You villain!" The girl was in tears too. Gordon was beyond weeping. "But
  why can't you leave him?" Diana's voice was low and vibrant. "Are you
  married?"</p>

  <p>The slow smile that dawned on the sad face told its own black story.</p>

  <p>"That kinder man doesn't marry," said Heloise quietly.</p>

  <p>The basilisk glare of Diana's eyes turned to Gordon, dumb and
  motionless.</p>

  <p>"But he shall!" she said slowly.</p>

  <p>Heloise went swiftly past her and fell on her knees at Gordon's feet. He
  did not even attempt to draw his hands away when she clutched them. This
  nightmare would pass&mdash;he was sure of that. Monstrous things like this
  did not happen in a well-ordered world. He had only to keep quiet and calm
  and presently Trenter's voice would say: "Eight o'clock, sir; I'm afraid it
  is raining." Trenter always apologised for the weather. And he would open his
  eyes...</p>

  <p>Through the haze of his dream came the moaning sound of Heloise
  pleading.</p>

  <p>"Dan, you heard what the good young lady said. Marry me, Dan&mdash;won't
  you marry me?"</p>

  <p>Gordon smiled foolishly. To Diana it was devilish.</p>

  <p>"Make me like I was when you took me from my li'l Connecticut home,"
  sobbed Heloise. Not for nothing had she played a small town tour with that
  masterpiece Rich Men and Poor Women. "Don't you see it, Dan? The old farm an'
  the old cows comin' along the boardwalk, an' can't you hear the cracked bell
  of the chapel, an' don't you remember my old mother sittin' right there on
  the porch read'n' the good old Book? Make it come back again, Dan."</p>

  <p>Her voice rose to a thin, agonized wail. For a second Gordon returned to
  near normal.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by this tomfoolery?" he squeaked, trying to disengage
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"Man!" Diana was unconscious of the plagiarism. "Be careful!"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You shall marry her!"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I can't&mdash;I won't... I'll see you all to the devil."</p>

  <p>Heloise cowered under the stroke of fate.</p>

  <p>"You promised me, Dan! You promised me! You're not going back on your
  word? Dan, say it ain't true&mdash;it's not true, Dan?"</p>

  <p>It was terrible, thought Diana, her heart broken by the woman's woe.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean it, Dan, do you? It's only your joking way?" Gordon showed
  his teeth in a fiendish grimace. "Ah, I can see you smiling. I can see the
  li'l twinkle in your eye! We'll quit this business like this pretty young
  lady says an' shake the whole outfit, won't we, Dan? And I'll be just your
  li'l wife sittin' on the back porch, whilst you're mixin' the hen-feed in the
  garden."</p>

  <p>"Damn the hen-feed!" he yelled. "Curse you and your back porch! I won't
  marry you. Diana, can't you see that she's a fake? She's acting! I'm nothing
  to her!"</p>

  <p>"He spurns me," groaned Heloise, and fell prostrate to the floor.
  Instantly Diana was beside her and had raised the bowed head.</p>

  <p>"Come with me, my dear. Appeal is wasted on a man like that. Ah, you can
  laugh!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not laughing," said Gordon indignantly. "What the devil is there to
  laugh at? If I laughed at anybody I would laugh at you, you... you
  booby!"</p>

  <p>She cast upon him one harrowing glance of contempt, and then devoted her
  attention to the girl.</p>

  <p>"If I gave you the money to get to your home, would you go?"</p>

  <p>Heloise nodded weakly.</p>

  <p>"You shall have it to-morrow. Come with me.</p>

  <p>Heloise gently freed herself of the detaining arm.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no, I'll stay," she said brokenly. "I guess there's something I
  want to say to Dan, something that I want no other woman to hear."</p>

  <p>Diana went pale.</p>

  <p>"I think I understand," she said quietly, and went out, closing the door
  softly behind her.</p>

  <p>Heloise waited, crept to the door and listened before she spun round, joy
  in her face.</p>

  <p>"Whoop-ee!" She danced round the kitchen. "I got my fare! I got my fare!
  Oh boy, some leading woman! Heloise, your salary is raised and your name's in
  lights."</p>

  <p>"You, you wicked woman!" gasped Gordon. "How dare you&mdash;how dare
  you!"</p>

  <p>"Aw, listen!" Hand on hip, she faced him, looking from under her curling
  lashes. "I gotta get somethin' on the side. Be reasonable, Man. I'm
  broke&mdash;I couldn't raise two dollars. Suppose Dan does pay
  up&mdash;where's my transportation coming from? Have a heart, birdie."</p>

  <p>"You've deceived Miss Ford."</p>

  <p>"Now listen to Holy Mike! Haven't you deceived her? Anyway, you don't
  deserve a nice li'l girl like that. Don't think I despise her because she's
  easy. That's a real nice girl. You lied when you said you were
  married&mdash;you may be, but it is not to Diana. And never will be. She's
  got brains."</p>

  <p>He strode up and down the kitchen with furious strides, muttering under
  his breath. Presently he confronted her.</p>

  <p>"You take away my character&mdash;you accuse me of the most abominable
  acts. You swear away my reputation in a most disgraceful manner. I am Double
  Dan in her eyes."</p>

  <p>She had found and lit another cigarette and was sitting on the table, her
  feet swinging.</p>

  <p>"Gee, you've gotta get a sense of humour, boy," she said good-naturedly.
  "You're too serious, that's what's wrong with you! She's a good dresser
  too&mdash;that gown she was wearing this afternoon certainly made me feel
  old."</p>

  <p>He was cooling down now. The uselessness of argument or appeal was so
  apparent that he fell into her mood.</p>

  <p>"I shall finish in a lunatic asylum," he said, "just as surely as Double
  Dan will finish in jail."</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry. The li'l game is going to end very soon. I'm through.
  John's due home in a fortnight, and I'm just longing for the smell of rubber
  an' oil an' breakfast. That's what a ship smells like to me. I'm going to
  have it out with Dan."</p>

  <p>"You mean, he is coming&mdash;that we shall meet?" asked Gordon
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>"We shall meet and he shall part," she said cryptically, "that's what. The
  poor Limburger! And he's going to split fair. Did he think I'd sit down an'
  take his twen'y-eighty? No, sir. As a woman the idea revolts me. I was
  brought up in a strict fifty-fifty school!"</p>

  <p>Gordon was himself again.</p>

  <p>"Now I warn you this matter has gone as far as it is going," he said
  impressively. "There are fifty thousand dollars in The Study safe, and I've
  no doubt in my mind that that is his objective, though how he came to know
  this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fifty thousand!" she breathed. "That explains everything! You told me in
  one of your heart-to-heart talks that you always kept a thousand pounds, but
  not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This money was drawn to pay an American," said Gordon impatiently. "There
  is no reason why I should explain why it is here. It is in the
  safe&mdash;that is sufficient."</p>

  <p>Heloise had become very thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"Then he knew!" she said. "The piker! Wouldn't that make you sore! Fifty
  thousand dollars&mdash;ten thousand pounds&mdash;seven hundred thousand
  francs &mdash;every mark in the world&mdash;and all to be cleaned up on his
  lonesome!"</p>

  <p>She was apparently oblivious of Gordon's presence. The immensity of Dan's
  treachery was all-absorbing.</p>

  <p>"So that's why he wanted to work alone! 'Get him to Ostend,' he said, 'and
  leave the rest to me!' And the rest was fifty thousand dollars! That fellow
  couldn't go straight if he was fired from a gun. Not a word to me
  either&mdash;he expected to get a thousand pounds, he said&mdash;it is the
  most unprofessional thing I've ever heard about in my life!"</p>

  <p>"My dear woman," said Gordon testily, "the ethics of the case do not
  interest me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But he's gonna split this two ways," said Heloise grimly, "or my name is
  Johanna Dub. He's going to act honest even if it hurts him. Yes, sir. There's
  going to be honour amongst Double Dan and Heloise Chowster. Shame on you,
  Dan, you great big yegg!"</p>

  <p>The perfidy of the man had changed her whole outlook on life. Her very
  ideals were tottering.</p>

  <p>"He'll split it no-ways, understand that!" Gordon was firm. "I will not
  see myself robbed. Do you think I'm a fool?"</p>

  <p>She searched his face for rebutting evidence.</p>

  <p>"Why, that idea certainly did occur to me," she said mildly; and then her
  tone changed. Diana's step was on the stair. "1 won't plead with you any
  more, Dan, there's nothin' to be gained. I&mdash;I wish you luck! Won't you
  take my hand for the last time?"</p>

  <p>Bewildered, Gordon stared at her, then he saw Diana and understood.</p>

  <p>"Don't let us part this way, Dan. I forgive you everything you've done.
  Good- bye, Dan, old friend."</p>

  <p>She put out her hand timidly. Gordon could have smacked her.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye!"</p>

  <p>"You brute&mdash;take her hand at once!" hissed Diana.</p>

  <p>He took it limply.</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;good-evening."</p>

  <p>Diana knew that the criminal classes were callous, but she had never
  realised how brutal they could be.</p>

  <p>"Come with me, my dear," she said. "You need not see him any more."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Gordon; "that's the first kind thing you've said."</p>

  <p>Diana treated him with the scorn he deserved.</p>

  <p>"Miss Ford"&mdash;Heloise was looking wistfully at her
  benefactress&mdash;"dare I ask you sump'n?"</p>

  <p>"Why, surely."</p>

  <p>Heloise touched her skirt disparagingly.</p>

  <p>"Somehow these clothes don't seem right in my state of mind. I know you'll
  think I'm crazy, but clothes mean an awful lot, even to a woman like me, and
  these are kind of too gay for a broken-hearted girl. If you've got sump'n
  quiet and sorrowful&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Diana smiled. How well she understood!</p>

  <p>"I know just how you're feeling. Come to my room, Heloise. You need have
  no fear. I will send Superbus to look after this&mdash;this man."</p>

  <p>Gordon thrust out a warning finger.</p>

  <p>"Diana, I beg of you not to help this wretched female. And for heaven's
  sake don't give her any of your new clothes&mdash;if you do, she'll
  impersonate you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Diana's glance would have withered a water-lily.</p>

  <p>"You despicable brute! Go to your bed and sleep&mdash;if you can!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was Monday morning. A church clock striking one reminded
Gordon of this
  interesting fact. An hour had passed since Bobbie's "goodnight" had come to
  him through the closed door of his room.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," said Gordon.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't speaking to you," snapped Bobbie.</p>

  <p>He had been out all the evening interviewing Inspector Carslake, and the
  excursion had not been altogether profitable. Bobbie's door closed. He heard
  the click of Diana's lock being fastened. Dempsi passed, after rhapsodizing
  at the closed portals of Diana's bower. From somewhere below came the snores
  of Julius Superbus.</p>

  <p>Every exit from the house was closed, save one. The little casement in the
  big windows of The Study. Gordon had made a careful examination, for there
  was a possibility that Diana had taken the precaution of screwing it tight.
  But this she had neglected, satisfied probably with the presence in The Study
  of Mr. Superbus.</p>

  <p>Twice Gordon had tiptoed to the door of his room and turned the handle. It
  was unlocked to-night. With Bobbie in the house Diana had relaxed her
  vigilance. Half-past-one chimed. Gordon got off the bed, put on his soiled
  collar and his coat and gathered up his shoes. He was penniless, but the
  servants at the hotel knew him, and he would be able to write a cheque on the
  hotel note-paper and get all the cash he wanted. And then he would return and
  deal with Mr. Dempsi. He had not yet decided as to the method of Dempsi's
  death, but it would be painful. As for Heloise... he hoped that she would be
  gone.</p>

  <p>Extinguishing the light, he opened the door and listened. There was no
  sound, and, creeping down the stairs, he passed silently into The Study. Mr.
  Superbus was breathing regularly&mdash;the window rattled a little; the floor
  vibrated; but no other ill effects followed. As Gordon stood listening, the
  detective grunted and turned over on his side. The snores ceased&mdash;Julius
  was in a deeper sleep than ever. Now was his chance; yet he had not taken a
  step before he halted. A circle of light had appeared at the window. He
  waited, holding his breath. There was a rasping sound, and the casement
  opened. He saw the dark bulk of a figure wriggle through. A long pause, in
  which the newcomer was invisible, then the circle of light appeared again.
  This time on the safe.</p>

  <p>A burglar! His first impulse was to leap at the man and grapple with him.
  His second was to approach with less commotion....</p>

  <p>"Hands up, or I'll fire!"</p>

  <p>At the first sibilant of the words, the light went out, and then:</p>

  <p>"Don't shoot, guv'nor. It's a cop!"</p>

  <p>"Don't shout, you fool!" hissed Gordon. "There's a man sleeping in the
  room&mdash;where's your gun?"</p>

  <p>"Don't carry a gun."</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>The unknown burglar's impatient click of lips was certainly called
  for.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask silly questions&mdash;I said it was a cop, didn't I?"</p>

  <p>Gordon groped for the flash-lamp and turned it full on the man's face.</p>

  <p>"I know you," he said immediately.</p>

  <p>The thin lips parted in a grin.</p>

  <p>"You 'ave the advantage of me," he said with mordant humour.</p>

  <p>"You are the man who was cleaning the windows yesterday morning?"</p>

  <p>The burglar nodded.</p>

  <p>"Got me first time. Stark's my name&mdash;I'm not giving any trouble, and
  if you tell the judge I had a gun you're a liar."</p>

  <p>He raised his voice a little. Gordon glanced round fearfully, but the
  detective was snoring again.</p>

  <p>"Ssh! Not so loud. Have you opened the safe?"</p>

  <p>The idea came to him at that second: a brain flash of singular
  brilliance.</p>

  <p>"I should have done if you'd been a minute later," said Stark plaintively.
  "You've spoilt a good night's work."</p>

  <p>Gordon nodded.</p>

  <p>"Open it," he said, and Stark could not believe his ears.</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>"Open it. I'll pay you well&mdash;and I'll give you your liberty. You'll
  only have to work on one lock&mdash;the combination is 'Telma'&mdash;got
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean it, guv'nor?" incredulity dominant.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. I lost my key," replied Gordon. "Now get to work&mdash;can you
  manage without the lights?"</p>

  <p>The other grinned in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Sure. Only amatchoors want a lot of light. A flash is best&mdash;and
  brightest."</p>

  <p>He produced from under his coat a short jemmy and a longer and thinner
  instrument. He may have been, and was, a poor window-cleaner. As burglar he
  belonged to the aristocracy.</p>

  <p>"Ever seen a safe opened before?" he asked over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Gordon shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not this way," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"Takes years to learn and there's not much money in it," said Mr. Stark
  sadly. "Spoilt by foreigners this trade is, ruined by competition and
  outsiders, like everything else. Americans mostly. Why they don't keep in
  their own country I don't know. Very smart fellows&mdash;I'll say that,
  though they're taking the bread out of our mouths; but we've got as good men
  if they only had a bit of encouragement and capital behind 'em."</p>

  <p>The door swung out.</p>

  <p>"There you are, sir!"</p>

  <p>Gordon peered over the man's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Open?" he asked, in a tone which combined surprise and annoyance. The man
  who sold him the safe was indeed a teller of untrue stories.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Show the light. Here it is. Moses! there's not ten thousand there!"</p>

  <p>He grasped what there was, and raised his head to listen&mdash;somebody
  was coming down the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Now go quick&mdash;there's somebody coming. Here, take this!"</p>

  <p>He thrust a bill into the burglar's hand. In a second Stark was through
  the window. Gordon was following, when a quivering voice from the sofa
  called:</p>

  <p>"Who's there?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Selsbury did not wait to explain. As the detective, with surprising
  courage, ran toward him, Gordon jumped from the window.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>It was another voice&mdash;Dempsi! Gordon dropped to the courtyard as the
  other fired.</p>

  <p>"Bang&mdash;bang!"</p>

  <p>Twice he shot, and there was a scream of pain. Diana heard it, and sprang
  from bed. Drawing her wrap about her as she ran, she flew down the stairs and
  into The Study. In the centre of the room stood Dempsi, and at his feet a
  figure&mdash;the wriggling figure of Julius Superbus.</p>

  <p>"He has paid the price of duty," said Dempsi.</p>

  <p>And so it proved. Ten little toes had Mr. Superbus brought to 61 Cheynel
  Gardens. One would never go forth again attached to his patrician feet.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Summing up the matter, as she did in a night made busy with
the comings
  and goings of doctors, and vocal with the low-voiced agony of Mr. Superbus,
  Diana was glad that the man had escaped. She was sorry, extremely sorry about
  the Julian toe&mdash;a small toe by all accounts, and not especially valuable
  or wholly necessary to his complete enjoyment of life&mdash;still, it was
  his, and had been (as he explained between paroxysms) a close companion
  throughout his chequered life. He recounted stories about it, half fond, half
  wistful. Once he had dropped a hammer on it and had cursed it for being in
  the way. He regretted that now. It had been a gentle, easygoing toe, and had
  never given him trouble. Other toes had developed callosities that were
  painful; but this child of his heart amongst the pedal appendages had never
  given him a moment's unease.</p>

  <p>Yes, she was rather sorry, even though the doctor said he was in no pain
  and (not knowing the fearless character of the man) had given an opinion that
  Julius was more frightened than hurt. But she was glad Double Dan had gone...
  ever so glad.</p>

  <p>And the shooting had produced one most desirable result&mdash;Dempsi had
  been completely subdued ever since. Not once had he described her as his
  angel or his serene vision. He who had searched the heavens and starry spaces
  thereof for illustrations of her beauty, her charm and her numerous
  attractions, was satisfied with the most commonplace terminology.</p>

  <p>"The fact is," said Bobbie, "the poor Wop has never used an automatic
  before, and the darn thing went off before he realised he had touched the
  trigger."</p>

  <p>"Poor Wop!" Diana's nose went up. "Poor Mr. Superbus rather!"</p>

  <p>This was so long after breakfast that Bobbie had had time to make a call
  at Diana's bank, and Mr. Dempsi was a notable absentee.</p>

  <p>"How did you sleep?" he asked sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Terribly! Bobbie, did you get the money?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, by great good luck your credits came through on Saturday. I have the
  money. The manager was full of apologies on behalf of self and bank. Here it
  is." He produced from his hip pocket a thick wad of bills. "In American
  money. By some strange accident it is clean."</p>

  <p>She was thoughtful, biting her lip.</p>

  <p>"I had a wire from Gordon. He has reached Inverness," she mentioned.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure he has," said Bobbie drily. "And how is the old K Bus?"</p>

  <p>"Poor old fellow!" she laughed quietly. "I think he's almost reconciled to
  his very great loss. I shouldn't be surprised if he didn't develop into a
  war-hero, but for the moment he's worrying what his good lady will say about
  the lost toe. From what he says I gather that she counts them every
  night."</p>

  <p>Bobbie grinned at the fire. There seemed something inexpressibly comic
  about a man losing a toe.</p>

  <p>"Nothing has been heard of Double Dan?" he asked, and she shook her
  head.</p>

  <p>"No, he seems to have disappeared. We know by the marks on the brickwork
  that he climbed the wall, and according to Mr. Superbus, he had a companion.
  In one way I'm glad he's gone."</p>

  <p>Bobbie looked at the girl in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Glad?" he said. "Good lord, why?"</p>

  <p>"For the poor girl's sake." Diana's face was saddened. "You don't know
  what she's suffered at his hands, Bobbie. There's a whole lot of good in
  Heloise. Of course she feels his going. That's the curse of it&mdash;a woman
  never loses hope."</p>

  <p>"He must have got away pretty quickly," said Bobbie. "I was down
  immediately after Dempsi, and though I searched the house and the courtyard
  at once, there was no sign of the devil."</p>

  <p>She made a little gesture of distaste.</p>

  <p>"Don't let us talk about him," she said briefly and went on to talk of
  Dempsi.</p>

  <p>"He has been simply splendid. Really I have had a pleasant shock: the only
  one of that variety he has ever given me. I shouldn't have thought that a man
  of his excitable temperament could have taken the matter so calmly. But he is
  subdued. A little nervous, I think, about the shooting. He was very anxious
  to know if I had informed the police, but of course I hadn't&mdash;so far as
  Mr. Superbus' toe was concerned. He's going to-day."</p>

  <p>"Not Dempsi?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"He says he'll wait for me for a thousand years," she sighed. "I told him
  a hundred would be long enough&mdash;heigho! He hasn't spoken otherwise about
  marriage all the morning. I almost like him for it."</p>

  <p>The subject of conversation strolled into the room a few minutes later. He
  was looking haggard, Bobbie thought, and remarkably unattractive.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Selsbury&mdash;you have not seen Aunt Lizzie? I wished
  to condole with her. It is terrible when lovers are parted&mdash;but how
  terrible for you! Double Dan, you say? It makes my flesh creep.
  Yet"&mdash;his admiring eyes beamed upon his hostess&mdash;"yet our little
  Diana did not fear! Ah, that was most wonderful. But tell me&mdash;who is
  Aunt Lizzie?"</p>

  <p>"A friend of mine," said Diana shortly.</p>

  <p>Dempsi shook his head in sorrow.</p>

  <p>"I shall never forgive myself for shooting Superbus&mdash;in the toe," he
  said in a tone of bitter regret.</p>

  <p>Bobbie laughed.</p>

  <p>"You sound as though you'd like to have shot him through the head," he
  said, and Mr. Dempsi recoiled before the bloodthirsty suggestion.</p>

  <p>"I? Heaven forbid! I admire Superbus. He is to me most admirable."</p>

  <p>"He shouldn't have slept," said Diana. "He promised me that if he did fall
  off, he would have one eye open. Those were his words. I don't know how he
  would manage, but he was so confident that I didn't come down to look."</p>

  <p>She ran to the door. The tap, tap of a stick on the parquet floor of the
  hall announced the coming of the invalid, his right foot a picturesque
  cushion of white bandages. There was a crutch under one arm, and he heaved
  himself forward in jerks. To Diana he accorded a wan smile. Bobbie took one
  arm, Mr. Dempsi the other. They reached the sofa to the accompaniment of many
  grunts and "ughs."</p>

  <p>"You are feeling better, Mr. Superbus?" He shook his head, being unwilling
  at this early stage to dispense with the anxiety, the care and the
  apprehension that was his due.</p>

  <p>"Middling, ma'am, middling. Naturally, I'm a little bit shook up. I always
  get that way when I figure in a shooting affray&mdash;if I may use the
  term&mdash;and I've been in a few in my time. I'll tell you about them one
  day, miss. But this, in a way, is the worst, and I admit I don't feel up to
  the mark. What my good lady will say when she finds I've lost a
  toe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He shook his head mournfully. Diana tried to cheer him.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure she won't make a fuss, Mr. Superbus. Women are very brave in
  such moments of trial. And a toe more or less isn't essential to married
  happiness."</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus wasn't so sure, being at that moment in his most sentimental
  mood. His eyes were moist.</p>

  <p>"It's a dreadful thing to think, ma'am," he said, his lip a-tremble, "that
  only yesterday that little toe of mine was alive and well; to-
  day&mdash;where is it?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Dempsi covered his eyes with his long, thin hand.</p>

  <p>"And I did it," he said, his bosom heaving.</p>

  <p>"Don't take on so, sir"&mdash;Julius had the air of a Christian martyr
  excusing the lions. "Why, it might have happened to any gentleman. I wish
  you'd shot him&mdash;or her."</p>

  <p>Diana's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Or her?" she repeated. "What makes you say that?" Was the other person a
  woman?"</p>

  <p>"It might have been." Julius was not prepared to be more explicit. In
  truth, he wasn't particularly sure himself, but being gifted by nature with
  the mystery novelist's successful trick of passing on suspicion to the most
  unlikely quarters, he suggested a woman accomplice, if only to be the only
  person in the room who knew the truth. Which was that the second person was a
  man and used expressions that no lady could possibly employ.</p>

  <p>"Whether it is one or the other I am unable to make a statement at
  present," he said sombrely. "That will come out at the trial."</p>

  <p>"What really happened?" Bobbie put the question. He had still only a
  disjoined idea of what had occurred in the dark.</p>

  <p>Julius fumbled in his pocket and found a massive notebook, opened it
  deliberately, and, after much searching, found the page he sought.</p>

  <p>"At two A. M. on or about the fifteenth inst.," he said sonorously and
  with complete relish, "I was aroused from my slumbers by an uneasy
  apprehension that trouble was abroad, viz: burglars or other bad characters.
  I proceeded at once to rise from my bed, which was twenty-five feet six
  inches from the window (I got Aunt Lizzie to measure it)" he explained in
  parenthesis. "The Study was in darkness, but I saw the figure of a man. As I
  darted forward to arrest him, there arose, seemingly from my feet, a person
  or persons unknown. Realising that danger threatened, I immediately grappled
  with them&mdash;I suppose you heard the sign of a struggle?" he asked
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>Diana had heard nothing. Bobbie shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I didn't, but I wasn't near enough," he explained.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dempsi, his hand behind him, his bearded chin on his waistcoat, did
  not look up.</p>

  <p>"Suddenly," resumed Superbus, "there was a shot and I knew no more."</p>

  <p>"But you say it might have been a woman?" Diana was not inclined to lose
  sight of that point.</p>

  <p>"It might have been a man or a woman," said Julius. "That will come out
  when I tell the secret story, so to speak. For the present I will describe it
  as a person or persons unknown. I don't mind admitting," he added, "that they
  was strangers to me, and I never want to see 'em again. Where's Uncle Isaac?
  I haven't seen him this morning."</p>

  <p>"But when you grappled, Mr. Superbus, you surely knew whether it was a man
  or a woman?" insisted Diana.</p>

  <p>Julius inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"Speaking as a married man," he said discreetly, "I ought to know."</p>

  <p>"But you 'grappled'?"</p>

  <p>"In a sense," said Mr. Superbus, "only in a sense. When a man grapples
  with&mdash;with&mdash;a problem, does he catch it by the ear, or punch it
  under the jaw? No, ma'am. When I say grappled, I'm speaking in a general
  way."</p>

  <p>"But you saw&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here Julius was on safer ground.</p>

  <p>"Well, it looked like a man... I'll tell you the truth, it looked like
  Uncle Isaac. Don't imagine for one second that it was Uncle Isaac," he warned
  them. "I cast no aspersions. He got through the door before I could properly
  see him."</p>

  <p>"You must have been mistaken, Mr. Superbus," said Diana.</p>

  <p>"I saw it slip past me and out of that door." Julius pointed.</p>

  <p>"You were mistaken," said Diana. "The man went out of the window and from
  the window into the courtyard. And then over the wall. The window was found
  open."</p>

  <p>But Julius was really not interested in the escaping criminal. On the
  other hand, he was very much interested in his own emotions. For once he felt
  that the eyes of the world were on him.</p>

  <p>"As I lay there," he said, "the whole of my life flitted before me. I saw
  my old school and the schoolmaster waiting for me at the door with his cane
  behind his back. I saw the public-house what I used to use as a young man,
  and where I met my good lady, owing to taking her father home one night and
  helping the family to put him to bed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," interrupted Bobbie, a little unkindly, "it must have been a
  dreadful experience. Now tell us how you came to be asleep whilst these
  people were breaking open the safe?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Superbus raised his eyebrows and shut his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Drugs," he said. "The coffee must have been drugged last night. I'm a
  light sleeper. The slightest noise and I'm awake!"</p>

  <p>Bobbie nodded.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you did hear the pistol then?" he said.</p>

  <p>Diana thought his remark somewhat offensive.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">With the remark that he had to go to his good lady or his
good lady would
  have to come to him, Julius had taken his departure in a motor ambulance. He
  could as well have gone by taxi, but he expressed a preference for an
  ambulance. "One with a red cross," he suggested. Diana had 'phoned a garage,
  and Julius Superbus made his exit dramatically, covered with blankets, flat
  on a stretcher, and smiling the smile of one who was not long for this world
  but wasn't afraid to go.</p>

  <p>"And what my missus will say when I come home short, I shudder to think,"
  he said pathetically. "I don't know: the only satisfaction I've got is that
  it was done on dooty."</p>

  <p>This significantly. When he had gone, Diana asked:</p>

  <p>"What is a toe worth, Bobbie? I must send the poor dear something. Would
  two hundred pounds be too little?"</p>

  <p>"It was a little toe," said Bobbie thoughtfully; "a big toe would have
  cost you more. Try him with two hundred."</p>

  <p>Diana wrote at once.</p>

  <p>She felt in excellent humour despite the empty safe with its hanging door;
  despite the shadow of tragedy which had impinged upon the house. Eleanor and
  the cook had made an early return. She had told them to stay away until
  Tuesday. They had argued (so they said) as to whether she had said Monday or
  Tuesday, and, to be on the safe side, had returned on the earlier day. Cook's
  triumph (she had supported the Tuesday view) was tempered by the chagrin of a
  lost twenty-four hours of well-paid idleness.</p>

  <p>Heloise, from an upper window, saw the detective take his ceremonious
  departure. She had reason to be glad that Dempsi's shots had done no greater
  mischief. She had been noticeably nervous all that morning, starting at every
  sound. Once Diana had found her hiding&mdash;there was no other word for
  it&mdash;in the little book-room and, detected, she had been so frightened
  and confused that Diana for a second was puzzled, till she remembered that
  the abrupt departure of Double Dan must have shocked the poor girl beyond
  understanding.</p>

  <p>Diana had finished her letter when Heloise came aimlessly into the room
  and looked round.</p>

  <p>Dempsi was sitting on the sofa, his face in his hands, looking moodily
  into the fire. Bobbie was in his own room, engaged in some mysterious
  business of his own (he was writing frantic telegrams to Gordon, imploring
  him to return; these he addressed to every hotel in Paris where he was likely
  to be found).</p>

  <p>Diana looked up with a smile, blotted the envelope and fixed a stamp.</p>

  <p>"You must talk with Aunt&mdash;with Heloise&mdash;and amuse her," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Dempsi broke off his meditations with a start.</p>

  <p>"You have met Heloise?"</p>

  <p>So many unlikely things had happened in the past forty-eight hours that it
  was quite possible she had omitted an introduction. She would not have been
  surprised if Dempsi denied having ever met Aunt Lizzie.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, we have met," he said awkwardly. "Did the shot waken you? I owe
  you ten thousand apologies if it did."</p>

  <p>She shook her head sadly.</p>

  <p>"No, no. My mind was too full of&mdash;something else. Something that I
  cannot explain. Uncle&mdash;Uncle Isaac has really gone?"</p>

  <p>Diana nodded.</p>

  <p>"Gone! Out of my life! It doesn't seem possible."</p>

  <p>Dempsi was vaguely interested, fixing her with a blank look; he also was
  thinking of something else.</p>

  <p>"Dear lady, you seem very sad," he said mildly.</p>

  <p>Her tragic eyes moved till they rested on his.</p>

  <p>"Sad! When I think of my old home and my dear father in
  Michigan&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I thought you said Connecticut," interrupted Diana.</p>

  <p>Heloise was a quick thinker.</p>

  <p>"Mother lives there," she said gently. "Poppa is in Michigan. They're
  living apart."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Diana helpfully, "happily separated. Most of one's friends
  are. It is so convenient for everybody&mdash;it simply means if you keep on
  good terms with both, that you double the number of your friends. You must
  feel rather nice about returning to America&mdash;having two homes that will
  welcome you."</p>

  <p>Heloise looked hard at the girl. She was never quite sure whether she was
  being very serious or very sarcastic. Other people disliked Diana for the
  same reason.</p>

  <p>"So you're going home?" Dempsi roused himself to take a benevolent
  interest in Aunt Lizzie.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm going back to a new life, thanks to Miss Ford," she said
  quietly. "Some day this life will seem like a bad dream; I shall forget
  everything, except those who have robbed me of that which was dearer than
  life itself."</p>

  <p>The embarrassed Diana made her escape.</p>

  <p>"You go to America?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"It is a beautiful country. A wonderful country!" mused Dempsi.</p>

  <p>The click of the door as Diana disappeared brought him to his feet, and
  his expression had undergone a remarkable change. He looked down at Heloise
  keenly, as he rasped:</p>

  <p>"Now, where is that money?"</p>

  <p>Heloise glanced at the door, looked over her shoulder: the room was
  empty.</p>

  <p>"You know where it is, Sally!" he said harshly. "Now come across!"</p>

  <p>She was not sad any more; on the contrary, she was on the verge of fury.
  Hands on hips, she faced him.</p>

  <p>"Say, Dan, you're the cleverest thing in male impersonators I know," she
  said shrilly. "I guess I wouldn't be surprised to see you come into this room
  disguised as a performing flea. But the innocent child is outside your
  repertoire. You wouldn't last three bars as Little Eva. Who took the money?
  You cheap skate! You're not going to put that over on me! You took the money.
  You took it, and helped that poor fool make a getaway at the same time. I
  guess you were working on the safe when he came in."</p>

  <p>"You lie!" He was beside himself with wrath. "I came in after you'd got it
  out. I didn't mean to shoot&mdash;I guess that was the maddest thing I ever
  did. But I saw this guy getting through the window, and I guessed what
  happened. He gave you the money to let him escape!"</p>

  <p>She showed her white teeth in a grimace of fury.</p>

  <p>"You mean I've got it right now? In my pocket?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I mean that," he said doggedly.</p>

  <p>She heaved up a long, impatient sigh.</p>

  <p>"You're going to hear from my husband's lawyers! That's what! And right
  here and now I'm telling you sump'n, you four-flushin' dog! You took the
  money, and shot that poor boob when he came in to see who it was breaking the
  tin! What were you doing in the room all dressed up ready to jump the first
  train out of London&mdash;and leave me flat? You sneak! Haven't I worked hard
  for you? Haven't I sat for hours making an exhibition of my darned ego for
  that soul-lizard? Didn't I get out of him the story of Diana, and give you
  the script and band parts and light cues? Didn't I pump him till there was
  noth'n' left but the squeak and the handle?
  And&mdash;do&mdash;you&mdash;dare&mdash;to turn me down?"</p>

  <p>He dared nothing. Her victory was complete when he began to make
  excuses.</p>

  <p>"There was fifty thousand dollars in that safe. All I've got is a crossed
  cheque that's as useful as confetti at a funeral. It will take two days to
  clear: Selsbury will be back to-night."</p>

  <p>"Fifty thousand dollars!" she sneered. "You told me nothing about that.
  Maybe you forgot it? You said there wasn't a thousand pounds in the job.
  Didn't you? You said you'd be glad if you got back expenses. Am I lying? And
  what's that cheque anyway? Money she owed Dempsi? Great snakes&mdash;the
  money Dempsi threw at her! I told you that, and I'd forgotten it!"</p>

  <p>She ran her fingers through her hair. Her smile was fixed and terrifying.
  The smile of the Medusas was jocund by comparison.</p>

  <p>"I forgot about it until I got a note from her enclosing the money," he
  protested. "Why, when that cheque came along, you could have blown me down.
  It was then I saw big money in the proposition and decided to go after the
  rest of the stuff. It looked easy to me."</p>

  <p>Impolite scepticism showed in her eye, and his injured air only
  intensified her suspicions.</p>

  <p>"Now, Dan, you're a wonderful teller of tales and I guess if I were a bit
  younger I'd fall for it!" she said practically. "But you're going to be a
  good little boy and 'fess up to Auntie that you took that money, and then
  you'll say 'Auntie, we'll split it fifty-fifty.' And if you don't, Dan, why,
  it's 'Good morning, judge' for yours!"</p>

  <p>He tried blandishment.</p>

  <p>"Honest, now, Sally, you've got it," he said genially. "Let's get right
  down to cases and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Would I be here doing this act and allowing my emotions to destroy my
  beauty if I had it? Shouldn't I be stepping on it? Would you be exchanging
  persiflage with anything but the dust of my trail?"</p>

  <p>This point appeared logical.</p>

  <p>"That's true," he said. "Then who opened the safe&mdash;not Selsbury?"</p>

  <p>"You did," she nodded, and he went purple.</p>

  <p>"Curse you! I told you I didn't take it..."</p>

  <p>The door handle turned. Without looking round they knew it was Diana. She
  had omitted to enclose a cheque in her letter, she remarked at large, but
  they were too absorbed in their talk to heed her.</p>

  <p>"I just love the country," sighed Heloise. "To hear the old blue jays
  singing and watch the clouds coming up over the hill and feel the breeze in
  your face&mdash;why, there's nothing quite like it, Mr. Dempsi."</p>

  <p>"I've never seen you two talking before," said Diana with a smile. Which
  was true.</p>

  <p>In a few seconds she was gone....</p>

  <p>"Now see here, Sally, we haven't time to act foolishly over this business.
  The stuff was taken, maybe by that guy Selsbury. What did you come here for,
  anyway?" It was a question that he had been seeking an opportunity to
  ask.</p>

  <p>"I came here when I found you were trying to work the job as a one-man
  performance. I know you, Dan; you've got a mighty bad reputation amongst
  honest crooks."</p>

  <p>He laughed without merriment.</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to live it down. Where has he gone&mdash;did he tell you he
  was leaving?"</p>

  <p>"No; we'd given up confidences before he left. You said he would come
  back. I've got it in my bones that you're right. I guess he got it."</p>

  <p>"But he couldn't have worked a job like this single-handed," said the
  other. "Why, your husband couldn't have opened that safe more
  scientifically...."</p>

  <p>She was not willing to be turned by gross flattery.</p>

  <p>"Cut out the small talk and get right down to the grand facts of life,"
  she said briskly. "Did I find Selsbury and affinitize him or did I not? Did
  I..."</p>

  <p>He snarled at her like an angry mongrel.</p>

  <p>"'Did I, didn't I'&mdash;great Moses! Do I want all that stuff? Why did
  you allow him to come back here?"</p>

  <p>"Let him come back?" she said scornfully. "I made him come back! When I
  got him into the house, I had him like that. I knew how you'd turn up. I knew
  there was money here, and I was going to stay with it. It's a funny thing
  about me that, of all the affinities I've met, noth'n' is quite so close as
  money. Noth'n' understands me better or talks more like Governor George
  Demosthenes."</p>

  <p>The man was finished. He too was a philosopher.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's no help for it," he said with a groan that he could not
  suppress. "We'll have to share. The old terms, mind&mdash;none of your fifty-
  fifty stuff. Seventy-thirty."</p>

  <p>"Seventy-thirty! Well, I admire cold blood! It's fifty-fifty or nothing
  with me, Dan. But there ain't anything to share."</p>

  <p>Here he corrected her.</p>

  <p>"She's paying up. I've given her back the cheque. If you wait half-an-
  hour she'll have it cashed. Now are you satisfied? Sixty-forty?"</p>

  <p>"Fifty-fifty!" said Heloise firmly. "You'd never forgive yourself if you
  gave me less."</p>

  <p>They wrangled for ten minutes; in the end Heloise gained a victory for
  principle.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Eleanor came furtively in search of her mistress and found
her in Gordon's
  room, valiantly overhauling his wardrobe.</p>

  <p>"The clergyman, miss," she said, with an air of mystery that was
  natural.</p>

  <p>The well-trained servant has an air appropriate to the calling of every
  visitor. Dread and a funereal solemnity for doctors, a primness for elderly
  ladies, a suppressed blitheness to announce the young, mystery for the
  clergy; only a lawyer baffles interpretation. The secret dispositions of
  lawyers have never been probed.</p>

  <p>"The clergyman!" Diana's heart fell.</p>

  <p>"A priest, ma'am, by his clothes," said Eleanor.</p>

  <p>She was a Primitive Methodist and was secretly thrilled by priests and
  nuns.</p>

  <p>Not before had Diana considered Mr. Dempsi's sectarian leanings. Nor had
  she before had sufficient confidence to meet the man whom she guessed had
  been sent by Dempsi to arrange the details of her servitude.</p>

  <p>"I will come down," she said, and took the card from Eleanor's hand.</p>

  <p>She read the few printed words carefully, then she read them again and
  passed her hand over her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Father Giuseppe Dempsi, Vicar of Banhurst."</p>

  <p>"Father Giuseppe Dempsi!" she said aloud, and in another second was flying
  down the stairs.</p>

  <p>She recognised him instantly, clean-shaven, dark, the old grin in his
  brown eyes. She would have known him even had he not been wearing his black
  cassock.</p>

  <p>"Diana!" he said. "After all these years I"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dempsi," she grasped, gripping the thin hand outstretched, "it is
  you! You don't know how glad I am to see you!"</p>

  <p>Dempsi, the real Dempsi! Then who was the other? The solution of the
  mystery came to her in a flash, and in the realisation the whole weight of
  the universe was lifted from her heart.</p>

  <p>"Father Dempsi!" she said, in a wondering way, still holding his hand. "It
  doesn't seem possible!"</p>

  <p>"I was rather a fool, wasn't I?" he said without any trace of
  embarrassment. "Yes, I went into the Church. But I should have let you
  know."</p>

  <p>"The money!" she said, suddenly. "The money you gave me&mdash;you will
  want that?"</p>

  <p>He laughed a little sheepishly.</p>

  <p>"I wondered if any was left. Honestly, I need money just now. My boys'
  club is insolvent and the new church hall wants an organ..."</p>

  <p>She nodded. She was still bewildered. Almost hysterical. And then came an
  excited Bobbie with a rush, flinging open the door.</p>

  <p>"Diana!" he began.</p>

  <p>Behind him stood Gordon. A somewhat severely clad Gordon, yet different.
  She ran to him&mdash;before she realised what happened, she had kissed him.
  Gordon returned the kiss without any visible effort.</p>

  <p>"Gordon, do you know the Reverend Giuseppe Dempsi? You've heard me talk
  about Mr. Dempsi?"</p>

  <p>Gordon stared at the priest open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"The Reverend Giuseppe Dempsi?" he said. "I thought&mdash;er " He grasped
  the hand of the smiling clergyman. "I knew it couldn't be that little... how
  do you do?"</p>

  <p>"Diana and I are very old acquaintances&mdash;old friends, I ought to
  say," said Dempsi, beaming from one to the other. "Old lovers, I nearly said,
  but the love was a little one-sided." He chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary!" Gordon could say no more.</p>

  <p>"But, Gordon, how is it you're back? I had a wire this morning from
  Inverness. You couldn't have got back&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By aeroplane," said Gordon without a blush. "I had a feeling that all was
  not well with you."</p>

  <p>"Gordon, did you really?" Her colour came and went. "You are psychic,
  aren't you? And Gordon, dear, you've had your whiskers shaved!"</p>

  <p>He nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"I meant to tell you I intended doing that&mdash;you once said that you
  did not like them. No more than that was necessary. They vanished in the
  twinkling of an eye."</p>

  <p>It was Gordon's moment. He was colossal.</p>

  <p>Eleanor opened the front door to a gentleman who was difficult to
  place.</p>

  <p>"Miss Ford at home?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, but she's engaged."</p>

  <p>The stranger had no visiting-card apparently, for he announced
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I am Inspector Carslake from Scotland Yard," he said. "I should like to
  see the safe that was opened last night. It isn't necessary to disturb Miss
  Ford."</p>

  <p>Eleanor, in a flutter, opened the door wider and showed him into The
  Study.</p>

  <p>"...leave by the first train," Mr. Dempsi was saying. "We'll split
  later."</p>

  <p>"We'll split before we part," said Heloise firmly, "for fear an accident
  happens&mdash;to the money."</p>

  <p>The other shrugged.</p>

  <p>"I'd hate to have a mind like yours," he said.</p>

  <p>And then the visitor came in. Heloise recognised him before he saw her
  face. There was a newspaper within reach, and she snatched it up, disappeared
  behind the printed page, and, reading, walked slowly from The Study into the
  little library.</p>

  <p>"Don't go," said Dempsi.</p>

  <p>Then he too saw the detective, and here the recognition was mutual.</p>

  <p>"The cobwebs on your chin are strangers to me," said Carslake, "but that
  noble brow and those sparkling eyes belong to an old friend of mine, Dan
  Throgood, yclept Double Dan."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you've made a mistake," said "Dempsi" with some hauteur.</p>

  <p>"What you're afraid of is that I haven't," said Carslake, and glanced at
  the broken door of the safe. "Your work?"</p>

  <p>"No. That's not my line. You've nothing on me, Carslake. I've been staying
  here as a guest of Mr. Selsbury."</p>

  <p>"And now you're going to be a guest of the King," said Carslake, slipping
  a pair of handcuffs from his pocket. "I must say, Dan, that you see
  life!"</p>

  <p>It was later in the day, and from information received, that the inspector
  called at 61 Cheynel Gardens to arrest and detain one Sarah Chowster, British
  subject alias Heloise van Oynne. But Heloise had gone. None knew whither.</p>

  <p>"Can I see Miss Ford," he asked, "or Mr. Selsbury?"</p>

  <p>Eleanor asked him to wait, and, passing into The Study, listened intently
  at the door.</p>

  <p>"...I really was going back to Australia, Gordon."</p>

  <p>"I'll follow you, and if necessary lose myself in the bush," said Gordon's
  voice.</p>

  <p>There was a long silence. Eleanor opened the door an inch and looked. Then
  she went back to the detective.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Selsbury and Miss Ford are engaged," she said.</p>
