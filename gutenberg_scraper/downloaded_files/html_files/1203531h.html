  <br>

<p class="first">IT was a bad night in London, not wild or
turbulent, but swathed to the eyes like an Eastern woman in a
soft grey garment of fog. It engulfed the walled canyons of the
city through which the traffic had roared all day, plugged up
the maze of dark side streets, and blotted out the open squares.
Close to the ground it was thick, viscous, impenetrable, so that
one could not see a yard ahead, and walked ghostlike,
adventuring into a strange world.</p>

<p>Occasionally it dispersed. In front of the opera house,
numbers of arc-lights wrought a wavering mist-hung yellow
square, into which a constant line of vehicles like monstrous
shiny bugs emerged from the outer nowhere, disgorged their
contents, and eclipsed again. And pedestrians in gay
processional streamed across the ruddy glistening patch like
figures on a slide.</p>

<p>Conspicuous in the shifting throng was a boy, ostensibly
selling violets, but with a keen eye upon the arriving vehicles.
Suddenly he darted to the curb, where an electric coupe had just
drawn up. A man alighted heavily, and turned to assist a young
woman.</p>

<p>For an instant the lad's attention was deflected by the
radiant vision. The girl, wrapped in a voluminous cloak of ivory
colour, was tall and slim, with soft white throat and graceful
neck; her eyes under shadowy lashes were a little narrow, but
blue as autumn mist, and sparkling now with amusement.</p>

<p>"Watch your steps, auntie," she warned laughingly, as a plump
elderly little lady descended stiffly from the coupe. "These
London fogs are dangerous."</p>

<p>The boy stood staring at her, his feet as helpless as if they
had taken root in the ground. Suddenly he remembered his
mission. His native impudence reasserted itself, and he started
forward.</p>

<p>"Voylets, lidy? Wear your colours. You ain't allowed to trot
without."</p>

<p>The girl gazed at him, her blue eyes bright as stars on a
windy night. An enchanting dimple twinkled about her curved lips
in gay hide-and-seek, and when she laughed, fled upward to her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Father," she said, "will you buy my colours from this bold
sporting gentleman?"</p>

<p>As the man fumbled in an inner pocket for change, the lad
took a swift inventory. The face, beneath the tall hat, was a
powerful oval, paste-coloured, with thin lips, and heavy lines
from nostril to jaw. The eyes were close-set and of a turbid
grey.</p>

<p>"It's him," the boy assured himself, and opened his mouth to
speak.</p>

<p>"So you are a sporting man," the girl rallied him gaily,
adjusting the flowers.</p>

<p>The boy nodded, responding instantly to her mood.</p>

<p>"Only," he swept her with shrewd, appraising eyes, that noted
every detail of her delicate beauty and sumptuousness, "<i>I</i>
don't trot in the two-minute class myself."</p>

<p>The girl laughed a clear silvery peal; and turned impulsively
to the young man in evening dress who had just dismissed his
hansom and joined the group.</p>

<p>It was the diversion the boy had prayed for. He took a quick
step toward the older man.</p>

<p>"N.," he said in a soft but distinct undertone. The man's
face blanched suddenly, and a coin which he held in his large,
white-gloved palm, slipped jingling to the pavement.</p>

<p>The young messenger stooped and caught it up dextrously.</p>

<p>"N.," he whispered again, insistently.</p>

<p>"H.," the answer came hoarsely. The man's lips trembled.</p>

<p>"C.," finished the boy promptly and with satisfaction. Under
cover of returning the coin, he thrust a slip of white paper
into the other's hand. Then he wheeled, ducked to the girl with
a gay little swagger of impudence, threw a lightning glance of
scrutiny at her young escort, and turning, was lost in the
throng.</p>

<p>The whole incident occupied less than a minute, and presently
the four were seated in their box, and the throbbing strains
from the overture of <i>I Pagliacci</i> came floating up to
them.</p>

<p>"I wish I were a little street gamin in London," said the
girl pensively, fingering the violets at her corsage. "Think of
the adventures! Don't you, Cord?"</p>

<p>"Don't I wish you were?" Cord Van Ingen looked across at her
with smiling significant eyes, which brought a flush to her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"No," he said softly, "I do not!"</p>

<p>The girl laughed at him and shrugged her round white
shoulders.</p>

<p>"For a young diplomat, Cord, you are too obvious&mdash;too
delightfully verdant. You should study indirection, subtlety,
finesse&mdash;study Poltavo!"</p>

<p>At the name the boy's brow darkened.</p>

<p>"Study the devil!" he muttered under his breath.</p>

<p>"That too, for a diplomat, is necessary!" she murmured
sweetly.</p>

<p>"He isn't coming here to-night?" Van Ingen asked in aggrieved
tones.</p>

<p>The girl nodded, her eyes dancing with laughter.</p>

<p>"What you can see in that man, Doris," he protested, "passes
me! I'll bet you anything you like that the fellow's a rogue! A
smooth, soft-smiling rascal! Lady Dinsmore," he appealed to the
older woman, "do you like him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't ask Aunt Patricia!" cried the girl. "She thinks
him quite the most fascinating man in London. Don't deny it,
auntie!"</p>

<p>"I shan't," said that lady calmly, "for it's true! Count
Poltavo," she paused to inspect through her lorgnettes some
newcomers in the opposite box, "Count Poltavo is the only
interesting man in London. He is a genius." She shut her
lorgnettes with a snap. "It delights me to talk with him. He
smiles and murmurs gay witticisms and quotes Talleyrand and
Lucullus, and all the while in the back of his head, quite out
of reach, his real opinions of you are being tabulated and
ranged neatly in a row, like bottles on a shelf."</p>

<p>"I'd like to take down some of those bottles," said Doris
thoughtfully. "Maybe some day I shall."</p>

<p>"They're probably labelled poison," remarked Van Ingen, a
little viciously. He looked at the girl with a growing sense of
injury. Of late she had seemed absolutely changed toward him;
and from being his dear friend, his childhood's mate, with
established intimacies, she had turned before his very eyes into
an alien, almost an enemy, more beautiful than ever, to be true,
but perverse, mocking, impish. She flouted him for his youth,
his bluntness, his guileless transparency. But hardest of all to
bear was the delicate derision with which she treated his
awkward attempts to express his passion for her, to speak of the
fever which had taken possession of him, almost against his
will, and which at sight of her throbbed madly at his wrists and
temples. And now, he reflected bitterly, with this velvet fop of
a count looming up as a possible rival, with his <i>savoir
faire</i>, and his absurd penchant for literature and art, what
chance had he, a plain American, against such odds?&mdash;
unless, as he profoundly believed, the chap was a crook. He
determined to sound her father.</p>

<p>"Mr. Grayson," he asked aloud, "what do you
think&mdash;halloo!" He sprang up suddenly and thrust out a
supporting arm.</p>

<p>Grayson had risen, and stood swaying slightly upon his feet.
He was frightfully pale, and his countenance was contracted as
if in pain. He lifted a wavering hand to his brow.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I feel ill," he said faintly. His hand fell limply
to his side. He took a staggering step toward the door.</p>

<p>Van Ingen was beside him instantly.</p>

<p>"Lean on me, sir," he urged quietly. He passed a steadying
hand through Grayson's, and guided him toward the passage.</p>

<p>"We'll have you out of this in a jiffy," he said cheerfully.
"It's the confounded stifling air of these places! It's enough
to make a grampus faint! Lady Dinsmore, will you look after
Doris?"</p>

<p>"No! No!" the girl exclaimed. Her face was white and strained
and fear darkened her eyes. In her distress she had risen, and
stood, clasping tightly her father's arm.</p>

<p>"We'll all go together! Please, dear!" Her voice and eyes
pleaded. She seemed trying to convey a hidden meaning, a secret
urgency.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Grayson, still pallid and frowning, leaned
heavily upon Van Ingen's shoulder. Tiny beads of perspiration
stood out upon his temples but his voice was stronger.</p>

<p>"Don't make a scene, my girl." He nodded toward the stalls,
where already curious lorgnettes were beginning to be levelled
at their box.</p>

<p>"Sit down!"</p>

<p>Doris obeyed mutely, her mobile lips quivering as she sought
to suppress her emotion. She was conscious of a shiver which
seemed to spread from her heart throughout her limbs. The
oppression of a nameless fear took possession of her; it weighed
her down. She sat very still, gripping her fan.</p>

<p>"I'll be around fit as ever in the morning. 'Night, Lady
Dinsmore. Take care of my girl."</p>

<p>Grayson spoke jerkily with a strong effort.</p>

<p>Lady Patricia Dinsmore regarded him coldly. She disliked the
man cordially, and made no bones of it. In her heart she had
never forgiven him for wedding her foolish younger sister, the
family beauty, who had died at Doris' birth far away from her
kith and kin in the desolate wilds of New York.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Gerald," she said drily. "Try to get a little
sleep." She turned to the younger man. "Put him to bed, Cord,
and cut all the wires around the Savoy, so he won't call up
those wretched brokers. I think he's trying to gobble the whole
English market."</p>

<p>She marked sharply the effect of her shaft. Grayson turned a
shade paler. He clutched Van Ingen's arm.</p>

<p>"Get me out of here!" he whispered hoarsely. Lady Patricia
viewed their departing backs with a fleeting ironical smile.</p>

<p>"Your father, my dear," she murmured to Doris, "is a very
remarkable man."</p>

<p>Out in the fresh air, Grayson revived amazingly. His
feebleness disappeared as if by magic, and he stepped out
briskly. He nodded to a hansom in the rank and the man drew in
to the opening.</p>

<p>"The Savoy," cried Grayson.</p>

<p>He sprang in hastily.</p>

<p>Van Ingen made as if to follow, but Grayson held the apron
door securely.</p>

<p>"No need in the world for you to accompany me, dear boy," he
exclaimed, smiling. "Go back. I feel quite braced already. It
was that devilish stuffiness inside&mdash;a momentary seizure.
Good-night!"</p>

<p>He waved his hand and sank back. The hansom started forward
with a jerk, and the young man retraced his steps to the
theatre, frowning thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Grayson thrust up the trap.</p>

<p>"You may drop me here," he called. He descended and paid his
fare. "I'll walk the rest of the way," he remarked casually.</p>

<p>"Bit thickish on foot to-night, sir," offered the driver
respectfully. "Better let me set you down at the hotel." But his
fare was already lost in the enveloping gloom.</p>

<p>Grayson wrapped his muffler closely about his chin, pulled
down his hat to shadow his eyes, and hurried along like a man
with a set destination. Presently he halted and signalled to a
cab, crawling along close to the curb. Grayson scrutinised it
keenly. The horse looked strong.</p>

<p>"Can you take me some distance?" he asked the driver.</p>

<p>"Take ye far's you got the coin!"</p>

<p>Grayson glanced about him furtively. "As far as this?" He
stepped forward and gave an address in a carefully lowered
voice.</p>

<p>The driver leaned far down from his high box and peered into
his fare's face.</p>

<p>"Not there!" he muttered.</p>

<p>Grayson held out a sovereign silently.</p>

<p>The driver shook his head.</p>

<p>"It's fair worth a man's life on a night like this."</p>

<p>Two sovereigns gleamed in Grayson's bare outstretched
palm.</p>

<p>"I'll double it if you drive fast," he offered.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," answered the man at length, a bit sullenly.
"Jump in." He turned his horse round and drove rapidly toward
the river.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap02" name="chap02">II. &mdash; A BUSINESS
CONSULTATION</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE fog was still heavy and the blurred
street-lamps looked ghastly in the yellow mist when the young
messenger, the first half of his mission performed, struck
briskly riverward to complete his business. He disposed of his
violets at a corner stand, hailed a passing hansom boldly, and
after a low consultation with the driver, got in. They drove
steadily for an hour. The gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets
more narrow and gloomy. Suddenly the man drew up with a
jerk.</p>

<p>"Here ye be," he called huskily.</p>

<p>The boy sprang to the ground and peered about him. "It'll
do," he announced, and then briefly, "Wait 'arf an hour."</p>

<p>He plunged down a dark and crabbed way, glancing warily
behind him now and then to see if he was being followed.</p>

<p>Here, between invisible walls, the fog hung thick and warm
and sticky, crowding up close, with a kind of blowsy intimacy
that whispered the atmosphere of the place. Occasionally, close
to his ear, snatches of loose song burst out, or a base, coarse
face loomed head-high through the reek. But the boy was upon his
native heath and scuttled along, whistling softly between closed
teeth, as, with a dexterity born of long practice, he skirted
slush and garbage sinks, held around the blacker gulfs that
denoted unguarded basement holes, and eluded the hideous shadows
that lurched by in the gloom.</p>

<p>Hugging the wall, he presently became aware of footsteps
behind him. He rounded a corner, and turning swiftly collided
with something which grappled him with great hands. Without
hesitation, the lad leaned down and set his teeth deep into the
hairy arm.</p>

<p>The man let go with a hoarse bellow of rage, and the boy,
darting across the alley, could hear him stumbling after him in
blind search of the narrow way.</p>

<p>Thin shivers of excitement rippled up and down his spine and
his blood crinkled in his veins. Squatting close to the sloppy
wall, he thrust out one leg and waited. He could feel the quarry
come on, the big blowing body of him, the groping, outstretched
arms. His leg stiffened rigid as a bar of iron. With a crash the
man fell headlong across it. The boy laughed aloud and sheered
aside, barely missing a knife which hurtled past and stuck
quivering in the opposite wall.</p>

<p>As he sped along, a door suddenly opened in the blank wall
beside him, and a stream of ruddy light gushed out, catching him
square within its radiance, mud-spattered, starry-eyed,
vivid.</p>

<p>A man stood framed in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Come in," he commanded briefly.</p>

<p>The boy obeyed. Surreptitiously he wiped the wet and mud from
his face and tried to reduce his wild breathing.</p>

<p>The room which he entered was meagre and stale-smelling, with
bare floor and stained and sagging wall-paper; unfurnished save
for a battered deal table and some chairs.</p>

<p>He sank into one of them and stared with frank curiosity past
his employer, who had often entrusted him with messages
requiring secrecy, past his employer's companion, to the third
figure in the room. A prostrate figure which lay quite still
under the heavy folds of a long dark ulster with its face turned
to the wall.</p>

<p>"Well?" It was a singularly agreeable voice which aroused
him, softly modulated but with a faint foreign accent. The
speaker was his employer, a slender dark man, with a finely
carved face, immobile as the Sphinx. He had laid aside his
Inverness and top hat, and showed himself in evening dress with
a large buttonhole of Parma violets, which sent forth a faint,
delicious fragrance.</p>

<p>Of the personality of the man the messenger knew nothing more
than that he was an aristocratic young nob, eccentric in a quiet
way, who lived in a grand house near Portland Place, and who
rewarded him handsomely for his occasional services.</p>

<p>He related his adventures of the evening, not omitting to
mention his late pursuer. "The keb's waitin' now, outside, sir,"
he concluded. The man listened quietly, brooding, his elbows
upon the table, his inscrutable face propped in the crotch of
his hand. A ruby, set quaintly in a cobra's head, gleamed from a
ring upon his little finger. Presently he roused.</p>

<p>"That's all to-night, my boy," he said gravely. "You've
served me well."</p>

<p>He drew out his purse, extracted two sovereigns, and laid
them in the messenger's hand.</p>

<p>"And this," he said softly, holding up a third gold piece,
"is for&mdash;discretion! You comprehend?"</p>

<p>The boy shot a swift glance, not unmixed with terror, at the
still, recumbent figure in the corner, mumbled an assent, and
withdrew. Out in the dampness of the fog, he took a long, deep
breath. After all, he reflected, such affairs were not in the
province of a night-messenger. They belonged to Scotland Yard.
And certainly the man paid well.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind him, his employer leaned back in
his chair, and smiled into the sombre eyes of his companion.</p>

<p>"At last!" he breathed softly. "The thing moves. The wheels
are beginning to revolve!"</p>

<p>His friend nodded gloomily, his glance straying off toward
the corner of the room.</p>

<p>"They've got to revolve a mighty lot more before the night's
done!" he replied with heavy significance.</p>

<p>He was a tall, lean man and wore a brown overcoat with the
collar turned up sharply about his throat, and a derby hat still
glistening from the mist. His voice, which was flat and rasping,
betrayed his transatlantic origin.</p>

<p>"It's my opinion," he continued bluntly, "that you stick
right here at this end of the line and see the game through. You
can present your excuses to Lady Dinsmore to-morrow. I needn't
tell you that we must move in this venture with extreme caution.
A single misstep at the outset, the slightest breath of
suspicion, and pff! the entire superstructure falls to the
ground."</p>

<p>"That is doubtless true, Mr. Baggin," murmured his companion
pleasantly. He leaned down to inhale the fragrant scent of the
violets. "But you forget one little thing. This grand
superstructure you speak of&mdash;so mysteriously&mdash;" he hid
a slight smile, "I know it not. You have seen fit, in your
extreme caution, to withhold all knowledge of it from me."</p>

<p>He paused and regarded his companion with a level, steady
gaze. A faint, ironical smile played about the corners of his
mouth.</p>

<p>"Is it not so, my friend?" he asked softly. "I am&mdash;how
you say&mdash;left out in the cold?"</p>

<p>His countenance was serene and unruffled, and it was only by
his slightly quickened breathing that an acute observer might
have said that the conversation held any unusual
significance.</p>

<p>The American stirred uneasily in his chair. A dull flush
mounted to his temples.</p>

<p>"There are some financial matters&mdash;" he muttered
sullenly.</p>

<p>"You admit it, then&mdash;this high scheme has to do with
finance, with the finance of nations&mdash;the finance of the
world!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered Baggin hoarsely. He glanced about,
half-fearfully.</p>

<p>The younger man ignored the outburst. He laid a persuasive
hand upon his companion's arm.</p>

<p>"My friend," he said gravely, "let me give you a bit of good
advice. Believe me, I speak disinterestedly. Take me into your
counsels. As a Russian nobleman and distant kinsman of his
Imperial Majesty the Tsar, I have the entree to the most
exclusive houses of London. Politics I know a little, and the
politicians extremely well. Twice I have been a guest at
Sandringham. I am a person of diplomacy, resolution, power. In
brief, Mr. Baggin, I am intelligent, and I know too little or
too much for you. Too much for an outsider, too little for a
friend and&mdash;ah&mdash;conspirator. With half my knowledge, I
could make you, or break you like glass. Candidly, I have not
the heart for the latter. I would be rather a&mdash;a friendly
power."</p>

<p>He leaned forward suddenly. "Make me," he said softly, "a
member of your Committee of Nine."</p>

<p>Baggin shrank back. "You&mdash;you know that?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"I know many things," was the quiet reply, "but not all."</p>

<p>The American looked at him doubtfully. The man seemed limpid.
Was he, in truth, as Grayson had once said, as deep as the
bottomless pit?</p>

<p>Grayson, he knew, had favoured him.</p>

<p>"You have no money," he objected, finally.</p>

<p>"I have something better."</p>

<p>"What?" In Baggin's mouth the question was an insult.</p>

<p>"Genius!" returned the young man simply.</p>

<p>He disregarded Baggin's scornful ejaculation, and continued
impersonally, as if reading aloud from a book.</p>

<p>"Genius, my friend! Genius is as high above mere money as the
stars wheeling in their celestial courses are above the earth.
It is human electricity &mdash;the motive power of the world.
With my power, the spark I feel within me here"&mdash;he touched
his white shirt-front&mdash;"I could wipe out kingdoms and
principalities, change the map of Europe more drastically than
Napoleon&mdash;and bloodlessly! Think of it a moment, my
prosaic, financial friend! I who sit here in this room, with you
and a dead man, <i>can do these things</i>! Just one little pawn
in the game is missing. Money. A few million pounds for running
expenses and for salaries to my&mdash;er&mdash;myrmidons! That
item, Mr. Baggin, I expect to be supplied by you."</p>

<p>He laughed outright at Baggin's frowning, mistrustful face,
crossed one leg over the other, and clasped his silk-clad ankle
with a shapely hand.</p>

<p>Baggin noted the boyish action. It at once irritated him and
determined his course.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," he replied drily, "we have already chosen
our president and voted upon the immediate use of the fund. The
map of Europe, I fear, must for the present remain
unaltered&mdash;"</p>

<p>He glanced up and added hurriedly, "I&mdash;regret this.
Perhaps at our next meeting. The membership, as you perhaps
know, is&mdash;er&mdash;limited."</p>

<p>The young man sprang to his feet. His face was bronze.</p>

<p>"It is of no consequence, my friend." He laughed softly.
"Simply, the scheme appealed to me. It fired my imagination. I
am, as you know, a dreamer.</p>

<p>"'If you can dream, and not make dreams your master,'" he
murmured.</p>

<p>He walked over to the corner of the room, picked up his
Inverness, and stood looking composedly down upon the figure
which it had concealed.</p>

<p>"<i>Salve</i>, my friend! You go down the river to-night,
wiser than all the kings of earth."</p>

<p>He slipped into his coat and turned toward Baggin, who had
also risen.</p>

<p>"You will see that it gets into the morning papers," he said.
"I could wish to write it myself," he added pensively, drawing
on his gloves.</p>

<p>"It has possibilities. So: 'Grayson a suicide. Great
financier shows himself at the opera, bids the gay world
good-night, and throws himself in the Thames. A flying rumour
breathes money troubles as a cause for the tragedy.' Wait!" he
fumbled in his breast pocket, "I'll write a note to pin to his
clothes."</p>

<p>He scribbled hastily in his memorandum book, tore out the
leaf, and handed it to his companion.</p>

<p>"He confesses his sins and commends his soul to 'le bon
Dieu.'" He laid a hand upon the door.</p>

<p>"You will leave me here&mdash;alone?" asked Baggin.</p>

<p>"But yes! Nothing can harm you from within, and you bolt the
door from without&mdash;until the preconcerted signal. It should
not be long now." He drew out his watch.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I wish you to remain&mdash;I command
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>Despite his efforts at composure, Baggin's voice
quavered.</p>

<p>His companion laughed. "A Roland for your Oliver, my friend!"
he cried. "Favour for favour! You grant my small request?"</p>

<p>Baggin shook his head.</p>

<p>"You will be king, eh?&mdash;and alone? Good!"</p>

<p>He put on his top hat, adjusted his silk muffler about his
throat, and with an amiable nod to his companion, stepped out
into the night.</p>

<p>The fog had thinned to a nebulous haze, fine as a lady's
veil, and the young man strode along briskly. Ten minutes
brought him to the waiting hansom.</p>

<p>"Covent Garden," he directed the driver. He sprang in and
leaned back against the cushions.</p>

<p>"So Baggin would be king!" He smiled with a certain
grimness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap03" name="chap03">III. &mdash; IN WHICH A CERTAIN
MOMENTOUS QUESTION IS ASKED</a></h2>

<p class="first">AT precisely ten o'clock, as the curtain came
reefing slowly down upon the first act of <i>I Pagliacci</i>,
Lady Dinsmore turned with outstretched hand to greet a newcomer
who had just entered the box.</p>

<p>"My dear count," she exclaimed, "I am disappointed in you!
Here I have been paying you really quite tremendous compliments
to these young people&mdash;which for an old woman, you know, is
very proper&mdash;and you show your complete indifference to me
by committing the worst crime in the calendar!"</p>

<p>"I am desolated!" The stranger who was bowing over her hand,
a trifle lower than an Englishman would have done, was slender
and distinguished looking, faultlessly dressed, and wearing a
bunch of Parma violets. He had a way of looking at one gravely
with an air of concentrated attention, as if he were seeing
through the words, into the very soul of the speaker. He was,
indeed, a wonderful listener, and this quality, added to a
certain boyish candour of temperament, accounted perhaps for
Count Poltavo's popularity in society.</p>

<p>"Before I ask you to name the crime, Lady Dinsmore," he said,
"or to inform me if the calendar is a lady's, permit me to offer
my humblest apologies for my lateness."</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore shook her head at him.</p>

<p>"You are incorrigible!" she declared. "But sit down and make
your excuses at your leisure. You know my niece, and I think you
have met Mr. Van Ingen. He is one of our future diplomats." The
count bowed and sank into a chair beside his hostess.</p>

<p>Van Ingen, after a frigidly polite acknowledgment, resumed
his conversation with Doris rather eagerly, and Lady Dinsmore
turned to her companion.</p>

<p>"Now for the explanation," she exclaimed briskly. "I shall
not let you off! Unpunctuality <i>is</i> a crime, and your
punishment shall be to confess its cause."</p>

<p>Count Poltavo bent toward her with bright, smiling eyes.</p>

<p>"A very stupid and foolish business engagement," he replied,
"which required my personal attendance. Shall I give you the
details? I warn you in advance they will bore you frightfully!
They did me."</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore threw up a protesting hand.</p>

<p>"Pray spare me," she begged. "Business has no charms to
soothe my savage breast! Grayson," she lowered her voice
confidentially, "can talk of nothing else. When he was with me,
he was forever telegraphing, cabling to America, or decoding
messages. There was no peace in the house, by day or by night.
Finally I made a stand. 'Gerald,' I said, 'you shall not pervert
my servants with your odious tips, and turn my home into a
public stock-exchange. Take your bulls and bears over to the
Savoy and play with them there, and leave Doris to me.' And he
did!" she concluded triumphantly.</p>

<p>Count Poltavo looked about, as if noting for the first time
the man's absence. "Where is he now?" he enquired.</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"He is&mdash;ill! Frankly, I think he had a slight
indisposition, and magnified it in order to escape. He hates
music. Doris has been quite distrait ever since. The child
adores her father."</p>

<p>Her companion glanced across to the subject of their remarks.
The girl sat in the front of the box, slim and elegant, her
hands clasped loosely in her lap. She was watching the brilliant
scene with a certain air of detachment, as if thinking of other
things. Her usual lightness and gay banter seemed for the moment
to have deserted her, leaving a soft brooding wistfulness that
was strangely appealing.</p>

<p>The count looked long at her.</p>

<p>"She is very beautiful," he murmured under his breath.</p>

<p>Something in his voice caught Lady Dinsmore's attention. She
eyed him keenly. The count met her look frankly.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is she engaged to her young friend?" he asked
quietly. "Believe me, it is not vulgar curiosity which prompts
the question. I&mdash;I am&mdash;interested."</p>

<p>His voice was as composed as ever, but a slight pallor spread
across his countenance. Lady Dinsmore averted her gaze hurriedly
and thought with lightning rapidity.</p>

<p>"I have not her confidence," she replied at length in a low
tone. "She is a wise young woman and keeps her own counsel." She
appeared to hesitate. "She dislikes you," she added. "I am sorry
to wound you, but it is no secret."</p>

<p>Count Poltavo nodded. "I know," he said simply. "Will you be
my very good friend and tell me why?"</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore smiled. "I will do better than that," she said
kindly. "I will be your very good friend and give you a chance
to ask her why. Cord," she bent forward and tapped the young man
upon the shoulder with her fan, "will you come over here and
tell me what your chief means by permitting all this dreadful
war-talk with Japan. Is it true that you Americans are going to
fight those pleasant little men?"</p>

<p>The count resigned his seat courteously, and took the vacant
place beside the girl. A silence fell between them, which
presently the man broke.</p>

<p>"Miss Grayson," he began gravely, "your aunt kindly gave me
this opportunity to ask you a question. Have I your permission
also?"</p>

<p>The girl arched her brows at him. Her lip curled ever so
slightly.</p>

<p>"A question to which you and my Aunt Patricia could find no
answer between you! It must be subtle indeed! How can I hope to
succeed?"</p>

<p>He ignored her sarcasm. "Because it concerns yourself,
mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"Ah!" She drew herself up and regarded him with sparkling
eyes. One small foot began to tap the floor ominously. Then she
broke into a vexed little laugh.</p>

<p>"I am no match for you with the foils, count. I admit it,
freely. I should have learned by this time that you never say
what you mean, or mean what you say."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Miss Grayson, if I say that you mistake me
utterly. I mean always what I say&mdash;most of all to you. But
to say all that I mean.&mdash;to put into speech all that one
hopes or dreams&mdash;or dares&mdash;" his voice dropped to a
whisper&mdash;" to turn oneself inside out like an empty pocket
to the gaze of the multitude&mdash;that is&mdash;imbecile."</p>

<p>He threw out his hands with an expressive gesture.</p>

<p>"But to speak concretely&mdash;I have unhappily offended you,
Miss Grayson. Something I have done&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Grayson," he began gravely, "your aunt kindly gave me
this opportunity to ask you a question. Have I your permission
also?"</p>

<p>The girl arched her brows at him. Her lip curled ever so
slightly.</p>

<p>"A question to which you and my Aunt Patricia could find no
answer between you! It must be subtle indeed! How can I hope to
succeed?"</p>

<p>He ignored her sarcasm. "Because it concerns yourself,
mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"Ah!" She drew herself up and regarded him with sparkling
eyes. One small foot began to tap the floor ominously. Then she
broke into a vexed little laugh.</p>

<p>"I am no match for you with the foils, count. I admit it,
freely. I should have learned by this time that you never say
what you mean, or mean what you say."</p>

<p>There was no mistaking his almost passionate sincerity now,
held in check by the man's invincible composure.</p>

<p>But the girl still held aloof, her blue eyes cool and
watchful. For the moment her face, in its young hardness, bore a
curious resemblance to her father's.</p>

<p>"Is that your question?" she demanded.</p>

<p>The count bowed silently. His lips were pale.</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you!" She spoke in a low voice surcharged
with emotion. "I will give you candour for candour, and make an
end of all this paltry masquerade."</p>

<p>"That," he murmured, "is what I most desire."</p>

<p>Doris continued, heedless of the interruption.</p>

<p>"It is true that I dislike you. I am glad to be able to say
it to you, openly. And yet, perhaps, I should use another word.
I dislike you and fear you in equal parts. I dislike your
secrecy&mdash;something dark and hidden within you&mdash;and I
fear your influence over my father." Her voice faltered over the
last word, and she paused.</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore's cheerful tones broke across the silence.</p>

<p>"Doris," she charged, "you are preaching to the count. He is
looking quite sulky and bored."</p>

<p>He shook his head at her, smiling.</p>

<p>"My unfortunate face, it belies me. I was, in truth, deeply
interested. Miss Grayson was speaking of her father." He turned
back to the girl. "You will continue the&mdash;how you
say&mdash;arraignment?" he asked gravely. "I would know the
worst. I, influence your father for evil&mdash;but how?"</p>

<p>Doris looked at him sombrely.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;exactly," she admitted. "But you are
somehow connected with the&mdash;the scheme &mdash;a terrible
illegal scheme," her voice was only just audible. "That I know
to a certainty. Father spoke to me one day of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Count Poltavo started.</p>

<p>"It was after he had decoded a telegram. He looked up and
spoke of your brilliance and discretion. He said you had the
mind of a Napoleon."</p>

<p>"It is true that I was able to do your father a service," he
replied slowly. "I did him another to-night." He smiled with a
certain mysticism.</p>

<p>"In truth, it was what delayed me. But as for
your&mdash;ah&mdash;conspiracy, Miss Grayson, believe me, I know
little. That a&mdash;a committee exists, with a
president&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Baggin!" breathed the girl. Her eyes were wide with
terror.</p>

<p>"Ah!" His face was immovable, but a gleam in his eyes
betrayed him.</p>

<p>She turned upon him sharply. "You did not know?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I know nothing&mdash;certainly. I wish I
did!" he added simply.</p>

<p>"That is true&mdash;you swear it?" She leaned toward him a
little, her bosom heaving tumultuously.</p>

<p>He bowed his head in assent.</p>

<p>"If I could believe you!" she faltered. "I need a friend! Oh,
if you could know how I have been torn by doubts, beset by
fears&mdash;oppressions!"</p>

<p>Her voice quivered. "It is illegal, you know, and terrible!
If you would help me. Wait. May I test you with a question?"</p>

<p>"A thousand if you like."</p>

<p>"And you will answer&mdash;truthfully?" In her eagerness she
was like a child.</p>

<p>He smiled. "If I answer at all, be sure it v/ill be
truthful."</p>

<p>"Tell me then, is Mr. Baggin your friend?"</p>

<p>"He is my dearest enemy," he returned promptly.</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath of relief. "And my father?" The
question was a whisper. She appeared to hang upon his reply.</p>

<p>The count hesitated. "I do not know," he admitted finally.
"If he were not influenced by Mr. Baggin, I believe he would be
my friend."</p>

<p>For the first time that evening Doris looked at him with
warmth in her manner. "By that," she said, smiling faintly, "I
know you have told the truth. My father likes you, but Mr.
Baggin sways him completely." The smile deepened in her eyes and
she laughed a little unsteadily. "You&mdash;you will be kind,
and forgive my rudeness and&mdash;and my anger?" The coldness
had departed from her face completely and she was charming.</p>

<p>The count looked hard at her. Her glance wavered, fell, and
met his again for a long moment.</p>

<p>Her colour heightened, and her breath came more quickly. A
cloud of passion was about them. It brushed them with invisible
wings.</p>

<p>He broke the spell.</p>

<p>"I am happy to have convinced you of my&mdash;ah
&mdash;sincerity," he murmured. "And you do, in truth, believe
me?"</p>

<p>She laughed softly. "Yes."</p>

<p>"And will trust me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He bent nearer to her. His face was quite pale and his eyes
burned like living things. "May I put my original question,
then&mdash;my personality is not utterly displeasing to
you?"</p>

<p>"My dear count," it was Lady Dinsmore's voice again, "it
occurs to me that you are putting several hundred questions
besides the one which I permitted you."</p>

<p>"It is I who am the culprit, auntie," exclaimed Doris gaily.
"You see it was a game&mdash;taking down bottles off the shelf!
Each one of us had ten questions which the other must answer
truthfully. I finished mine first, and the count had just begun
on his!"</p>

<p>"I see," said Lady Dinsmore drily. "I fear, then, that I
interrupted."</p>

<p>Count Poltavo leaned toward her persuasively.</p>

<p>"There is just one more important question, dear Lady
Dinsmore," he said, "and that I should like to ask you."</p>

<p>The little lady elevated her brows at him. "Insatiable
youth!" she murmured. "What is your question?"</p>

<p>"It is a very small thing," he replied, "but it has been in
my mind for several days. I should like you and Miss
Grayson&mdash;and Mr. Van Ingen, if he can find the time," he
bowed politely to the young American, "to visit my studio."</p>

<p>Doris clapped her hands. "Delightful!" she exclaimed. "And
will you do a sketch of auntie with her head cocked a bit to one
side, like a pert little robin, and that adorable crooked
smile?"</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore patted her hand with a tolerant smile. "It is
you that the count wishes to paint, my dear, not a wizened old
woman like me."</p>

<p>"If I might try both of you," the count replied. "Sometimes,
with people who are my friends, the result is not so bad. The
likeness, if it comes at all, comes quickly."</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore laughed. "We will come, I promise you! Some
afternoon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Morning," he begged. "The light is better."</p>

<p>"Some morning, then," she agreed, "next week."</p>

<p>The curtain rose upon Nedda and Canio, who sang with love and
bitterness and rage. Lady Dinsmore yawned behind her fan. At the
end of the act she rose.</p>

<p>"Doris, my dear, I am going to follow the example of your
father. This air is stifling, and we have a heavy day before us
to-morrow. Cord, will you go for our things?"</p>

<p>It was the count who handed the ladies to their places in the
unobtrusively elegant electric coupe, while Van Ingen stood
doggedly at his elbow, awaiting a last word with Doris. He was
bitterly jealous of his rival, who, to the boy's inflamed mind,
seemed perversely lingering over his farewells. There was some
colour for his anger. The count had taken the girl's hand, and
bending down so low that the two dark heads almost touched, was
murmuring in her ear.</p>

<p>She smiled, but shook her head.</p>

<p>"Every moment to-morrow is already gone. And the next day
also!"</p>

<p>He looked at her steadfastly for a moment. "I shall see you
to-morrow," he reiterated softly. "Moreover, you yourself will
send for me. I prophesy!"</p>

<p>She laughed, and gave her hand to Van Ingen.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Cord," she said with frank affection.</p>

<p>"You won't forget you're lunching with me tomorrow, Doris?"
he begged.</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" she returned mischievously. "I want to see my
father. And, Cord, do look him up in the morning and 'phone me
how he is&mdash;will you? I wish you could get him off for a
walk."</p>

<p>"I will." He flushed with pleasure at the request. "I'll take
him out to the zoo."</p>

<p>He closed the door and turned to rid himself of his
companion.</p>

<p>The count stood with bared head, staring after the coupe. The
corners of his lips curved in a slight smile, and his eyes were
bright, as of one who dreams of pleasant things.</p>

<p>"Good-night," said Van Ingen shortly. The count laid a
persuasive hand upon the young man's arm.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he begged. "You will perhaps stroll with me for a
little?"</p>

<p>Van Ingen hesitated, frowning.</p>

<p>"I must insist!" Count Poltavo linked an arm through his
companion's, who perforce fell into step with him. "It
is&mdash;how you say&mdash;a small matter of business!" He
laughed softly.</p>

<p>Van Ingen stalked along in absolute silence. The man's
marked, almost insolent preference of Doris, as well as his
amazing power over her, filled him with speechless rage. Given a
pinchbeck title, he reflected viciously, and a glib tongue, and
straightway a girl loses her head. "What is your business?" he asked
aloud.</p>

<p>Poltavo threw back his head and laughed musically. "Ah, you
Americans!" he murmured. "You cut, like a sharp knife, straight
to the heart of a matter. One stroke! 'What is your business?'"
He mimicked the young man's curt speech with delicate
precision.</p>

<p>"Your countrywoman, Miss Grayson, she also is
direct&mdash;and adorable." He appeared to muse. "She is
natural, with the naivete of a child. She is beautiful. She has
charm. The perfect trinity! Have you observe' her chin&mdash;so
round, so firm&mdash;and her throat&mdash;"</p>

<p>Van Ingen disengaged himself roughly. "We will not discuss
Miss Grayson," he said a little hoarsely. "We will, if you
please, keep strictly to business."</p>

<p>The count regarded him with an air of aggrieved reproach.</p>

<p>"You use words like bricks, my friend," he said gently. "You
assault the intelligence. Ver' good. I retort in kind." His
accent became slightly more pronounced. "You say: keep strictly
to business. I say: mademoiselle is the subject of my business.
She have told me that she and you are childhood mates&mdash;that
you live in&mdash;how you say&mdash;the same <i>bloc</i> with
her in New York&mdash;and that she have for you great regard,
great affection&mdash;like a sister, perhaps. And it was this
great regard which leads me to speak to you&mdash;to confide my
hopes. It is my great wish to make Miss Grayson my wife," he
concluded simply.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you are engaged to her?" The universe seemed
suddenly wheeling about Van Ingen's head, and his heart was
beating thickly. It appeared, oddly enough, to be beating up in
his head, smiting the drums of his ears like iron hammers, and
pounding madly at his temples. He fought for composure, the
hated ease of his companion. The count's words came to him
dimly, as from a distance.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he was saying. "In the future&mdash;perhaps. But
with you, her almost-brother, one may anticipate&mdash;"</p>

<p>Van Ingen interrupted him. "I fear I must correct a slight
misapprehension upon your part. I am not Miss Grayson's
'almost-brother,' nor," he laughed grimly, "have I any desire for
that particular relationship. You have given me your confidence. I
will be equally frank with you. I, too, admire Miss
Grayson."</p>

<p>"Ah!" He looked at Van Ingen with interest. "So you also are
making the running! But, my dear boy, are you not&mdash;forgive
me!&mdash;are you not&mdash;ah&mdash;young?"</p>

<p>Van Ingen flushed to the roots of his hair with sheer rage.
It was the very taunt which Doris had flung in his teeth earlier
in the evening. "I am twenty-five," he replied stiffly.</p>

<p>"So old!" exclaimed the count. "Permit me to say that you do
not look it! I," he continued thoughtfully, "am thirty-five. And
Miss Doris is older than both of us."</p>

<p>"She is exactly twenty-two."</p>

<p>The count shook his head. "Never believe it, my friend. She
is as old as Eve. And as eternally young as Spring!" He turned
to the other with a slight laugh. "You are my rival, then? You
will do your best to baffle me, to thwart this great
desire?"</p>

<p>"That is understood!" Van Ingen retorted. In spite of himself
he was coming to admire the man's coolness and apparent
simplicity of nature.</p>

<p>"Excellent! Well, then, it would appear that we are enemies.
I have been counted an indifferently good enemy," he remarked.
He held out his hand. "Good-night! Let us part friends, though
we meet as sworn foes in the morning."</p>

<p>Van Ingen appeared not to perceive the outstretched hand.
"Good-night," he said coldly.</p>

<p>He lifted his hat and turned away.</p>

<p>The count looked after him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Odd!" he muttered. "But I fancy that youngster. He <i>is</i>
like her." With a few swift steps he overtook his late
companion.</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Ingen, forgive my insistence. Believe me, it
surprises you no more than it does me. Let me venture to give
you a word of advice."</p>

<p>Van Ingen interrupted him fiercely. "Let me give you a word
first," he exclaimed. "The plain advice of a very plain
American. Briefly, mind your own business and permit me to
attend to mine."</p>

<p>The count looked at him fixedly for a moment, and then
shrugged his shoulders. "So be it, my friend," he murmured,
turning away.</p>

<p>"It was but a momentary weakness." He drew out his note-book,
which afterwards became so famous, and wrote: "To spare is to
become a coward."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap04" name="chap04">IV. &mdash; WHICH RELATES TO A
NEWSPAPER SUICIDE</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE next morning, at the stroke of ten, Van
Ingen, faultlessly clad, sprang from his hansom in front of the
American Embassy and tossed the astonished jarvey a
sovereign.</p>

<p>"Because it's a fine morning," explained Van Ingen gaily,
"and also because something nice is going to happen to-day."</p>

<p>He stood for a moment, drawing in the fresh April air, sweet
with the breath of approaching spring. He caught the scent of
lilacs from an adjoining florist shop. Overhead, the sky was
faintly blue. He was feeling fit, very fit indeed&mdash;he made
passes with his cane at an imaginary foe&mdash;and he was to
lunch with Doris and her father at the Savoy. That was the
"something nice"&mdash;with perhaps a stroll later along the
Embankment with Doris alone.</p>

<p>He turned and took the stairs three at a time, whistling
softly to himself.</p>

<p>"Chief in yet?" he enquired of Jamieson, the secretary, who
looked up in astonishment at his entrance, and then at the
clock.</p>

<p>"No, he's not down yet. You've broken your record."</p>

<p>Cord grinned. "I've got to get away early." Tossing his hat
upon his desk, he sat down and went methodically through his
mail. Half-an-hour later, he leaned back languidly and unfolded
his <i>Times</i>, which in his haste he had thrust unread into
his pocket.</p>

<p>"Beastly bore, this keeping up with the times," he grumbled
in an aggrieved tone. "Why does the chief make us wade through
all this stuff? Make us diplomats, forsooth!"</p>

<p>He yawned and glanced down at the flaring headlines on the
front page. With a little horrified cry he sprang to his feet.
He was suddenly pale, and the hand which gripped the paper
shook.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Jamieson swung about in his swivel chair.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he enquired alertly.</p>

<p>"Grayson!" he muttered huskily. "Gerald Grayson has committed
suicide!"</p>

<p>"Yes, so I read," remarked Jamieson cheerfully. "Supposed to
be a fabulously rich old johnny, wasn't he, and turned out to be
a bankrupt. Friend of yours?" he asked curiously.</p>

<p>Van Ingen lifted a face from which every vestige of colour
had been drained. "I&mdash;I was with him at the opera last
night," he said. Jamieson whistled softly.</p>

<p>"He was slightly indisposed and left early," continued Van
Ingen, "and I thought no more about it."</p>

<p>He rose hurriedly and reached for his hat. "I must go to
them. Perhaps something can be done. Doris&mdash;" He broke off,
unable to continue, and turned away sharply.</p>

<p>Jamieson looked at him sympathetically. "Why don't you go
round by the newspaper offices?" he suggested. "There may be new
developments&mdash;possibly a mistake. You note that
the&mdash;the body has not been recovered?"</p>

<p>Van Ingen's face brightened. "A fine idea! Thanks, old man."
He wrung the other's hand fervently. "I'll be off at once."</p>

<p>Out upon the pavement, he caught a passing taxi-cab. "Drive
to the nearest newspaper office," he directed, "and wait for
me."</p>

<p>At the information desk inside the huge building where he
preferred his request, his worst fears were realised. The note
was unmistakably in Grayson's handwriting.</p>

<p>"We verified that, of course," said the reporter who had been
sent out to speak to the young man.</p>

<p>"How?" asked Van Ingen sharply.</p>

<p>"Through his daughter, naturally," was the calm response. "We
sent a man out this morning to her aunt's house, and she
recognised the handwriting at once."</p>

<p>Van Ingen groaned. "Couldn't you have left her in peace?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Ingen, you don't seem quite to realise the
importance of this tragedy. Grayson was a financial king&mdash;a
multimillionaire. Or, at least, he was so considered up to this
morning. It now appears that he had speculated heavily during
the last few weeks&mdash;we gathered this from Lady
Dinsmore&mdash;who kindly told us what she knew&mdash;and lost
everything, every penny of his own and his daughter's fortune.
Last night, in a fit of despair, he ended his life."</p>

<p>Van Ingen looked at him in a kind of stupefaction. Was it of
Grayson the man was talking such drivel? Grayson who only the
week before had told him in high gratification that within the
last month he had added a cool million to his girl's marriage
portion. Grayson who but yesterday had hinted mysteriously of a
gigantic financial coup in the near future. He passed a
bewildered hand across his eyes. And now all that fortune was
lost, and the loser was lying at the bottom of the Thames!</p>

<p>"I think I must be going mad!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Grayson wasn't the kind to kill himself. Why, I tell you,"
he cried, "that last night, when I bade him good-night, he was
gay, smiling. He looked like a man who goes forth to meet
success."</p>

<p>"You saw him, then?" the reporter queried eagerly. "When?
Where? Please give us full details, Mr. Van Ingen. This may turn
out to be of tremendous importance." He pulled out his
note-book.</p>

<p>"I was at the opera with his party last night," replied Van
Ingen. He repeated the events of the previous evening.</p>

<p>"Grayson was not meditating suicide when I left him," he
concluded positively. "I could swear it! Rather, he seemed to be
reflecting with relish upon some particularly fine joke. May I
see that note he is supposed to have written?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" The reporter vanished into an inner room, and
presently returned holding a scrap of white paper in his hand.
"Torn from his memorandum book, you see," he observed quietly.
Van Ingen read it through. "It's his handwriting, right enough,"
he admitted. "But somehow, it doesn't sound like Grayson
himself. Too theatrical, dramatic!" He frowned, as if trying to
catch some haunting impression. "It sounds like&mdash;" He broke
off sharply, his face paling.</p>

<p>"Good God, no!" he whispered, "that couldn't be! And yet
"&mdash;his eyes sought the paper again &mdash;"it's the dead
ringer of the kind of rot he talks! But why&mdash;" He pressed
his hand to his temples. "I give it up!" He returned the slip to
the reporter, who had been watching him with cool, level
eyes.</p>

<p>"You have a clue?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, no!" replied Van Ingen hurriedly. "The whole affair is
utterly inexplicable to me at present. I cannot believe that
Grayson deliberately killed himself. The thing is beyond reason!
The paper says that his hat and overcoat were found?"</p>

<p>"Together with his wallet and some personal letters. It seems
a clear case." The reporter hesitated a moment. "It is not as
yet known to the public, but I think I may tell it to you that
Mr. T.B. Smith has been given charge of the matter. He will
probably wish to know your address. And in the meantime, if you
run across anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly! I will let you know. Smith is an able man, of
course." Van Ingen gave the number of his chambers, and
retreated hastily, glad that the man had questioned him no
further.</p>

<p>Out in the fresh air he drew a deep breath of relief, which
ended in a sigh. But, at any rate, he had not betrayed his
suspicions, if indeed they could be termed
suspicions&mdash;those wild surmises which had flashed like
forked lightning across the blackness of his mind. He found his
cab and flung himself wearily back against the cushions. And now
for Doris!</p>

<p>But Doris was not visible. Lady Dinsmore met him in the
morning-room, her usually serene countenance full of trouble. He
took her hand in silence.</p>

<p>"It is good of you, my dear Cord, to come so quickly. You
have heard all?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "How is Doris?"</p>

<p>She sank into a chair and shook her head. "The child is
taking it terribly hard! Quite tearless, but with a face like
frozen marble! She refused quite scornfully to believe the news,
until she saw his own handwriting. Then she fainted. She fell to
the floor at the man's feet as if she had been stabbed to the
heart." Lady Dinsmore took out her lace handkerchief and wiped
her eyes. "Doris," she continued in a moment, "has sent for
Count Poltavo."</p>

<p>Van Ingen started. "Why?" he demanded in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I cannot say, definitely," she replied, with a sigh. "She is
a silent girl. But I fancy she feels that the count knows
something. She believes that Gerald met with foul play."</p>

<p>Cord leaned forward breathlessly. "My own idea!" he
articulated.</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore surveyed him with faint, good-humoured scorn.
"You do not know Gerald!" she said finally.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I do not follow you! If it was not murder it must
have been suicide. But why should Grayson kill himself?"</p>

<p>"I am sure that he had not the slightest idea of doing
anything so unselfish," returned Lady Dinsmore composedly.</p>

<p>"Then what&mdash;"</p>

<p>She leaned forward and tapped him on the shoulder with her
fan.</p>

<p>"Why are you so absolutely sure that he is dead?" she asked
softly.</p>

<p>Cord stared at her in blank amazement. "What do you mean?" he
gasped. Was she mad also?</p>

<p>"Simply that he is no more dead than you or I," she retorted
coolly. "What evidence have we? A letter, in his own
handwriting, telling us gravely that he has decided to die! Does
it sound probable? It is a safe presumption that that is the
farthest thing from his intentions. For when did Gerald ever
tell the truth concerning his movements? No, depend on it, he is
not dead. But, for purposes of his own, he is pretending to be.
He has decided to exist&mdash;surreptitiously."</p>

<p>"Why should he?" muttered Cord. This was the maddest theory
of all. His head swam with the riot of conflicting impressions.
He seemed to have been hurled headlong into a frightful
nightmare, and he longed to emerge again into the light of the
prosaic, everyday world.</p>

<p>The door at the farther end of the room opened. He looked up
eagerly, half expecting to see Grayson himself smiling upon the
threshold.</p>

<p>It was Doris. She stood there for a moment, uncertain, gazing
at them rather strangely. In her white morning dress, slightly
crumpled, and her dark hair arranged in smooth bandeaux, she was
amazingly like a child. The somewhat cold spring sunlight which
streamed through the window showed her pallid, as though the
event of the night had already set its mark upon her. There were
faint violet shadows beneath her eyes.</p>

<p>Cord came forward hastily, everything blotted from his mind
but the sight of her white, grief-stricken face. He took both
her hands in his own warm clasp. All he found to say, huskily,
was, "Doris! Doris!"</p>

<p>The girl gave him a wide, deep look. Suddenly her lips dipped
and quivered uncontrollably. With a short, smothered sob, she
flung herself into his arms and hid her face on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>Cord held her tenderly. "Don't!" he whispered unsteadily.
"Don't cry, dear!"</p>

<p>In her sorrow, she was inexpressibly sweet and precious to
him.</p>

<p>The moment recalled vividly an incident in their childhood,
when her pet collie had died, and the little girl of seven had
flown down the path with streaming eyes to meet him and sobbed
out her grief in his arms.</p>

<p>He bent down and smoothed with gentle fingers the soft dusky
hair. The fragrance of it filled his nostrils. Its softness sent
a delicious ecstasy thrilling from his finger-tips up his arm.
He trembled throughout his entire frame. All his life, he
declared to himself with passionate sincerity, he would love her
like this. All his life he would remember this one moment. He
gazed down at her tenderly, a wonderful light in his young
face.</p>

<p>"Dear!" he whispered again.</p>

<p>She lifted a pallid face to him. Her violet eyes were misty,
and tiny drops of dew were still tangled in her lashes.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you are good to me," she murmured.</p>

<p>At his answering look, a faint colour swept into her cheeks.
She disengaged herself and sat down.</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore came forward, and seating herself beside the
girl upon the divan, drew her close within the shelter of her
arms.</p>

<p>"Now, Cord," she said cheerily, indicating a chair opposite,
"sit down, and let us take counsel together. And first of all,"
she pressed the girl's cold hand, "let me speak my strongest
conviction. Gerald is not dead. Something tells me that he is
safe and well."</p>

<p>Doris turned her eyes to the young man wistfully. "You have
heard something&mdash;later?" she asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "There has been no time for fresh
developments yet. I came past the newspaper office, and they are
doing what they can. Scotland Yard is in charge of the affair,
and T.B. Smith has been put upon the case."</p>

<p>She shuddered and covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>"How strange and ghastly it all is!" she whispered.
"I&mdash;I cannot get it out of my head. The dark river&mdash;my
father&mdash;I can see him there&mdash;" She broke off with a
low moan.</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore looked helplessly across to the young man.
Tears were in her kind eyes.</p>

<p>The curtain at the lower end of the room parted, and a
footman stood framed in the opening.</p>

<p>"A message for Miss Grayson," he announced discreetly.</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore arched her eyebrows significantly. "Poltavo!"
she breathed.</p>

<p>Doris darted forward and snatched the letter from the man's
hand. She broke the seal and tore out the contents at a glance.
A little strangled cry of joy escaped her. Her face, which had
been pale, flushed a rosy hue. She bent to read it again, her
lips parted. Her whole aspect breathed renewed hope and
radiance. She folded the note, slipped it into her bosom, and,
without a word, glided from the room.</p>

<br>

<p>Cord stared after her, white to the lips with rage and
wounded love.</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore rose briskly to her feet. "Excuse me, dear
Cord," she murmured, "and wait here!" She rustled after her
niece.</p>

<p>Van Ingen paced up and down the room distractedly,
momentarily expecting her reappearance.</p>

<p>Alternate waves of jealousy and grief inundated his being.
Only a short half-hour ago, with Doris' head pillowed upon his
breast, he had felt supremely happy; now he was plunged into an
abyss of utter wretchedness. What were the contents of that
brief note which had affected her so powerfully? Why should she
secrete it with such care unless it conveyed a lover's
assurance? His foot came into contact with a chair, and he swore
under his breath. Then he sighed.</p>

<p>The servant, who had entered unobserved, coughed
deprecatingly. "Her ladyship sends her excuses, sir," he said,
"and says she will write you later." He ushered the young man to
the outer door.</p>

<p>Upon the top step Van Ingen halted stiffly. He found himself
face to face with Poltavo.</p>

<p>The count greeted him gravely. "A sad business!" he murmured.
"You have seen the ladies? How does Miss Grayson bear it? She is
well?"</p>

<p>Van Ingen gazed at him darkly. "Your note recovered her!" he
said with harsh bitterness.</p>

<p>"Mine!" Surprise was in the count's voice.</p>

<p>"But I have not written. I am come in person."</p>

<p>Cord's face expressed scornful incredulity. He lifted his hat
grimly and descended the steps.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap05" name="chap05">V. &mdash; COUNT POLTAVO OFFERS
HIS SERVICES</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE footman who had shown Van Ingen to the door
ushered the count into the morning-room, replenished the fire in
the grate which had burned low, and departed noiselessly.</p>

<p>The newcomer sank wearily into a deep chair, and closed his
eyes. He looked spent and haggard, as if his night had been a
sleepless one. The clear olive of his skin showed slightly
sallow, and fine wire-lines were etched about his eyes. Perhaps
he did not hear the light footfalls which approached. Doris came
nearer, soft-footed, and pausing before the fire, regarded him
with deep attention.</p>

<p>She had changed into a dark dress which accentuated her youth
and slenderness.</p>

<p>The count opened his eyes and looked at her. A slight smile
touched his lips. "I was dreaming of you!" he murmured softly.
He sprang to his feet. "Forgive me!" he exclaimed contritely. "I
must have dozed. I had a wakeful night." She gave him her hand.
"And I disturbed you with my message!"</p>

<p>"I was glad to come," he replied simply. "But you&mdash;this
terrible news!" He released her hand and fell back a pace,
scrutinising her sharply.</p>

<p>"But you do not look sad! And yet your letter&mdash;the
morning paper which I bought upon the way &mdash;it is not true,
then?"</p>

<p>"Something is true&mdash;but not&mdash;not the ghastly thing
I feared when I wrote you." She seated herself, and the count
resumed his chair by the fire. His face was hidden in the
shadows. "You mean that your father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is alive and well!" Her voice quivered and broke. Two
shining tears trembled for a moment upon her lashes., and then
sped down her cheeks. Others followed. She smiled through them.
"I am so happy&mdash;so thankful!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"How did you learn this&mdash;wonderful news?"</p>

<p>The count's voice, though low, rang like steel on stone.</p>

<p>She gave him a startled look, and withdrew the note from its
warm resting place and handed it silently to him.</p>

<p>"May I take it to the light?" Without waiting for permission,
he rose and stepped to the window. He stood with his eyes glued
to the oblong strip of paper. A curious greyish pallor had
spread across his countenance, and his hands shook. A gust of
strong rage overtook him, as he stared down at the familiar
handwriting. "Imbecile!" he muttered. With an effort he
collected himself, and turned back to the girl. "Permit me to
ask if your aunt has seen
this&mdash;ah&mdash;communication?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "You see, he&mdash;he has forbidden me to
speak!" Tears clouded her vision.</p>

<p>The sternness melted out of his face, but he put another
question.</p>

<p>"And your estimable young friend whom I met at the door?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He took a deep breath and returned to his place at her
side.</p>

<p>"I wished to tell him," she continued, "for Cord is so good!
He is as dear to me as a brother."</p>

<p>The count restrained a smile. He bent down and possessed
himself of her hand. "Dear lady," he said, "you must conceal
this, even from your brother. It was a mad thing for your father
to do! I think Baggin would kill him if he knew!"</p>

<p>His own face hardened as he spoke. "But what's done can be
undone." He leaned forward and dropped the paper upon the
glowing coals. It smoked, then turned a deep quivering red,
against which the letters were blackly visible. "Look!" he
exclaimed softly. One phrase stood out strong and clear upon the
darkening ashes.</p>

<p>"'Trust Poltavo!'" Doris whispered. She bent a little toward
him. Her eyes were luminous, and her red lips parted. "It is a
good omen!" she breathed.</p>

<p>"And you will trust me in this matter?" he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded gravely.</p>

<p>He raised her fingers to his lips and kissed them.</p>

<p>"And in others, also?"</p>

<p>She flushed warmly. "You must not speak of such things now. I
must not listen. I can think only of my father. He is not
dead&mdash;for that I thank Heaven. But he is in
danger&mdash;great danger, both from Baggin and the law.
He&mdash;he loved me more than his millions, and wrote to
reassure me of his safety. Oh!" she exclaimed passionately, "he
is not bad, Count Poltavo&mdash;as Baggin is&mdash;as I once
thought you were&mdash;but only weak, and swayed by his
imagination. He sees things big. He dreams of a financial empire
such as the world never knew."</p>

<p>The count looked at her, and smiled queerly.</p>

<p>"And you wish me to find your father?" he questioned.</p>

<p>"Yes, or take me to him!"</p>

<p>"And after that?" he demanded a little eagerly.</p>

<p>"After that," she replied wearily, "you may say what you
will."</p>

<p>"Until that hour, then," he said gently, "I shall set a seal
upon my lips."</p>

<p>A silence fell between them. The count brooded, his eyelids
down-dropped, his chin propped in the palm of his hand. A ruby,
set in a curious antique ring, gleamed dully from his
finger.</p>

<p>"I think," he observed finally in a low voice, "that Mr.
Grayson is, by this time, safely upon the Continent.
Paris&mdash;Rome?" He shook his head. "Too dangerous. Madrid? It
is possible. Yes." He nodded, and then sat erect. "To-night,
mademoiselle," he announced, "I shall start for Madrid to find
your father."</p>

<p>She thanked him with her eyes. "And you will stop this
terrible scheme&mdash;you will save him from Baggin?"</p>

<p>"I will save him from Baggin!" he promised grimly. "More than
that, dear lady, I cannot undertake."</p>

<p>She gave him a shining look. "Ah, you are good," she
whispered. She laid a hand on his arm. "Good and&mdash;and
faithful!"</p>

<p>The count seemed deeply moved. He looked down at the hand,
but made no motion to touch it.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," he said in a strange, choked voice, "it is
you who are good! You conquer me with your divine tenderness!" A
spasm as of pain crossed his countenance. "I&mdash;I am not
good, as, the world knows that word. I am hard, ambitious,
cruel." He continued, his face white and stern:</p>

<p>"Power is to me the greatest thing in the world, greater than
love&mdash;even my love for you&mdash;greater than life. For
what is human life? It is cheaper than the dirt in the street.
Why should we value it? For myself, it signifies nothing. When
it obstructs my path, I set it aside&mdash;or crush it."</p>

<p>She drew back from him half fearfully. A lock of dark hair
had escaped, and fallen across her brow. It made her look
singularly young and troubled. "Why do you say those wild
things?" she faltered.</p>

<p>He smiled, master of himself again, and took her hand.</p>

<p>"You are afraid of me&mdash;Doris?" he whispered softly.</p>

<p>She trembled at the word. Her white eyelids fluttered, and
her colour came and went under his persistent gaze.</p>

<p>"A&mdash;a little!" she confessed. It seemed to her that she
could almost hear her heart beat. His personality was round
about her like a spell.</p>

<p>"Only a little!" the count laughed gaily. "I admit I am very
much afraid of you!"</p>

<p>The hand was still closely imprisoned. She disengaged it, and
lifted her eyes bravely to him.</p>

<p>"I believe that you are the most truthful man in the world,"
she said simply. "But I&mdash;I fear your truth. It terrifies
me."</p>

<p>"Yesterday," he replied, with a whimsical smile, "you hated
me. I was all evil. To-day I am the most truthful man in the
world. What shall I be to-morrow?"</p>

<p>She held her head down and refused to meet his look.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I cannot tell," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Nor shall I urge you," he replied gently.</p>

<p>"Later, perhaps, when your father is safe. But until then,
may I ask a very great favour?"</p>

<p>She nodded mutely.</p>

<p>He drew off the ring. "Will you wear this? I have a fancy
that upon your hand it will bring me good luck and ward off
danger." He tried it upon one after another of her fingers. "Too
large!" he murmured disappointedly.</p>

<p>Doris smiled faintly. From about her throat, hidden in the
lace of her gown, she pulled out a slender gold chain, from
which a locket depended.</p>

<p>"I will wear it here," she promised, "together with the
picture of my father." She took the jewel from his hand, and
undoing the clasp, threaded the ring upon the chain and restored
all to their place.</p>

<p>"That is better than I dared hope!" he said. He bent toward
her. "And you will think of me sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Every instant of the day," she responded fervently, "until I
shall see my father."</p>

<p>He laughed a little ruefully, and rose. "I suppose that must
content me! And now I must be off. I will find your father.
'Trust Poltavo.'"</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;completely." She gave him her hand.</p>

<p>Her face was composed, almost cheerful. "Do you leave any
commands?"</p>

<p>He looked significantly at the fire, where the only trace of
the note was a faint black film. "You have already received
them," he said gravely.</p>

<p>"Everything is as it was this morning. Your father is dead.
For you nothing is left but silence&mdash;and courage."</p>

<p>She shuddered a little. "Cord told me that the&mdash;the
affair was in the hands of Scotland Yard, and that a Mr. Smith
had been appointed to the case."</p>

<p>The count started at the name. He opened his lips to speak,
but closed them again.</p>

<p>"Will he come and question me?" she continued. "Oh," she
declared half wildly, "I could not bear that!"</p>

<p>"I regret that Mr. Smith has been given the case," observed
the count thoughtfully. "I know the gentleman, slightly. He is a
difficult man to deceive. You may be sure, dear lady, that he
will come&mdash;and come again, if he suspects anything. You
must be on your guard. Aid him openly with all the information
at your disposal. Make engagements with him. Write notes. Send
him fresh clues&mdash;one a day! And now&mdash;how you
say&mdash;good-bye!" He looked down into her eyes, smiling.</p>

<p>Doris appeared to cling to him. "Oh, if you could be here to
advise me!" she murmured. "I am afraid. It is all so
secret&mdash;and terrible!"</p>

<p>"I will return," he assured her. "In three days I will
return, or wire instructions. Courage!" he whispered. He touched
his lips to her hand, pressed it, gave her a long look, and
turned abruptly upon his heel.</p>

<p>Doris sank upon the divan, and stared drearily into the
fire.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later, Lady Dinsmore, drawing the curtains
softly, found her in the same position. The older woman's face
was flushed, and showed traces of recent tears. She sat down
beside the girl and drew her close into her arms.</p>

<p>"Dear," she said in a choked voice, "you must be very
brave."</p>

<p>Doris shuddered inside the protecting circle. Lady Dinsmore
held her tightly.</p>

<p>"Your poor father has been found. Mr. Smith is below. He
wishes us to go with him, to identify the&mdash;the body." She
bent down tenderly to the girl, who lay quite still in her arms,
and then gave a little cry. Doris had fainted.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap06" name="chap06">VI. &mdash; A STRANGER COMES TO
BURGOS</a></h2>

<p class="first">HE was a slender, distinguished man, and
dressed in black, which is the colour of Spain.</p>

<p>Seeing him, on windy days, when bleak, icy air-streams poured
down from the circling Sierras, and made life in Madrid
insupportable, one might have marked him down as a Spaniard. His
black felt hat and his velvet-lined <i>cappa</i> with its high
collar would show him to be such from a distance, while nearer
at hand his olive complexion, his delicately aquiline nose, and
slightly upturned black moustache, would confirm the distant
impression. He had come to Burgos from Madrid by an express, and
had travelled all night, and yet he was the trimmest and most
alert of the crowd which thronged the Calle de Vitoria, a crowd
made up of peasants, tourists, and soldiers.</p>

<p>He made a slow progress, for the crowd grew thicker in the
vicinity of the Casa del Cord&oacute;n, where the loyal country-folk
waited patiently for a glimpse of their young king.</p>

<p>The stranger stood for a little while looking up at the
expressionless windows of the Casa, innocent of curtain, but
strangely clean. He speculated on the value of life&mdash;of
royal life.</p>

<p>"If I were to kill the king," he mused, "Europe would
dissolve into one big shudder. If, being dead, I came forward
offering to restore him to life for fifty million francs the
money would be instantly forthcoming on the proof of my ability.
Yet were I to go now to the king's minister saying&mdash;'It is
easy for me to kill the king, but if you will give me the money
you would spend on his obsequies, I will stay my hand,' I should
be kicked out, arrested, and possibly confined as a
lunatic."</p>

<p>He nodded his head slowly, and as he turned away he took a
little note-book from his pocket, and inscribed&mdash;"The
greatest of miracles is self-restraint." Then he rolled a
cigarette and walked slowly back to the Cafe Suizo in the
Espolon.</p>

<p>A clean-shaven priest, with a thin, intellectual face, was
stirring his coffee at one of the tables, and since this was the
least occupied the stranger made for it. He raised his hat to
the priest and sat down.</p>

<p>"I apologise for intruding myself, father," he said, "but the
other tables&mdash;"</p>

<p>The priest smiled and raised a protesting hand.</p>

<p>"The table is at your disposition, my son," he said.</p>

<p>He was about the same age as the stranger, but he spoke with
the assurance of years. His voice was modulated, his accent
refined, his presence that of a gentleman.</p>

<p>"A Jesuit," thought the stranger, and regarded him with
politely veiled curiosity. Jesuits had a fascination for him.
They were clever, and they were good; but principally they were
a mysterious force that rode triumphant over the prejudice of
the world and the hatred in the Church.</p>

<p>"If I were not an adventurer," he said aloud, and with an air
of simplicity, "I should be a Jesuit."</p>

<p>The priest smiled again, looking at him with calm
interest.</p>

<p>"My son," he said, "if I were not a Jesuit priest, I should
be suspicious of your well-simulated frankness."</p>

<p>Here would have come a deadlock to a man of lesser parts than
the stranger, but he was a very adaptable man. None the less, he
was surprised into a laugh which showed his white teeth.</p>

<p>"In Spain," he said, "no gambit to conversation is known. I
might have spoken of the weather, of the crowd, of the
king&mdash;I chose to voice my faults."</p>

<p>The priest shook his head, still smiling.</p>

<p>"It is of no importance," he said quietly; "&mdash;you are a
Russian, of course?"</p>

<p>The stranger stared at him blankly. These
Jesuits&mdash;strange stories had been told about them. A body
with a secret organisation, spread over the world&mdash;it had
been said that they were hand-in-hand with the police.</p>

<p>"I knew you were a Russian; I lived for some time in St.
Petersburg. Besides, you are only Spanish to your feet," the
Jesuit looked down at the stranger's boots,&mdash;"they are not
Spanish; they are much too short."</p>

<p>The stranger laughed again. After all, this was a
confirmation of his views of Jesuits.</p>

<p>"You, my father," he accused in his turn, "are a teacher; a
professor at the College of Madrid: a professor of languages."
He stopped and looked up to the awning that spread above him,
seeking inspiration. "A professor of Greek," he said slowly.</p>

<p>"Arabic," corrected the other; "&mdash;but that deduction
isn't clever, because the Jesuits at Madrid are all engaged in
scholastic work."</p>

<p>"But I knew you came from Madrid."</p>

<p>"Because we both came by the same train," said the calm
priest, "and for the same purpose."</p>

<p>The stranger's eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"For what purpose, father?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To witness the eclipse," said the priest. A few minutes
later the stranger watched the black-robed figure with the
broad-rimmed hat disappearing in the crowd with a little feeling
of irritation.</p>

<p>He drank the remainder of his <i>caf&eacute; en tasse</i>, paid the
waiter, and stepping out into the stream, was swept up the hill
to where a number of English people were gathered, with one eye
upon their watches and another upon the livid shadow that lay
upon the western sky.</p>

<p>He found a place on the slope of the hill tolerably clear of
sightseers, and spread a handkerchief carefully on the bare
baked earth and sat down. He had invested a penny in a strip of
smoked glass, and through this he peered critically at the sun.
The hour of contact was at hand, and he could see the thin rim
of the obstruction cover the edge of the glaring ball.</p>

<p>"Say, this will do; it's not so crowded."</p>

<p>The stranger buried his chin in the high collar of his
<i>cappa</i>, pulled down his felt hat over his eyes, and from
beneath its brim gazed eagerly at the newcomers.</p>

<p>One was short and stout and breathed stertorously, having
recently climbed the hill. His face was a heavy oval, with deep
creases running from nostril to jaw. The other, the speaker, was
a tall, lean man, with an eagle cast of countenance. He wore,
somewhat carelessly, a brown overcoat and a derby. Both were
unmistakably American tourists, who had stopped off at Burgos to
see the eclipse.</p>

<p>"Phew!" exclaimed the fat man. "I don't know which was worse,
the climb or the crowd. I hate crowds," he grumbled. "You lose
things."</p>

<p>"Have you lost anything?" asked the other. His own hand went
unconsciously to his breast pocket. The stranger saw this out of
the corner of his eye&mdash;inside breast pocket on the left, he
noted.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't carry valuables in a place like this," the man
continued, "that is to say, not money."</p>

<p>"How about letters, eh, Baggin? Letters&mdash;and plans?
They are sometimes worth money to the right party."</p>

<p>His companion frowned. "Nothing that I carry is worth money,"
he returned shortly. "I flatter myself that not a man in the
world, no, not even you, Grayson," there was a slight sneer in
his voice, "could make head or tail of my memoranda. And yet,
there it is, the entire proposition, written down, in black and
white. But it's all in code, and I carry the code in my
head."</p>

<p>"I'm sincerely glad to hear it," replied the other. He looked
about him nervously. "I have a feeling that we oughtn't to have
come here."</p>

<p>"You make me tired," said Baggin wearily.</p>

<p>"We oughtn't be seen together," persisted the other. "All
sorts of people are here. Men from the city, perhaps. Suppose I
should be recognised &mdash;my picture was in all the
papers."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," said Baggin roughly. "And for Heaven's
sake, don't peer around in that silly fashion. Let me give you
an epigram of Poltavo's. 'It is the observer who is always
observed.' Rather neat, eh?"</p>

<p>"I wish he were in with us on this thing."</p>

<p>"I don't," retorted Baggin. "So that's settled. He's done his
work, and that's the end of him."</p>

<p>"I doubt it," returned the other thoughtfully. "And, frankly,
if the matter comes up again, I shall vote to admit him."</p>

<p>"Well, wait till it does come up," growled Baggin. "And don't
talk shop in a crowd like this. Do you know what Poltavo says?
'Men babble away their secrets, and whisper away their lives.'"
There was a long pause, and the stranger knew that one of the
Americans was making dumb-show signals of warning. They were
nodding at him, he felt sure, so he bowed and asked
politely:</p>

<p>"At what hour is the eclipse?"</p>

<p>"No savvy," said the fat man, "no hablo Espagnol."</p>

<p>The stranger shrugged his shoulders, and turned again to the
contemplation of the plain below.</p>

<p>"He doesn't speak English," said the fat man, "none of these
beggars do."</p>

<p>His friend made no reply, but after a silence of a few
minutes he said quietly and in English:</p>

<p>"Look at that balloon."</p>

<p>But the stranger was not to be trapped by a simple trick like
that, and continued his stolid regard of the landscape; besides
he had seen the balloons parked on the outskirts of the town,
and knew that intrepid scientists would make the ascent to
gather data.</p>

<p>He took another look at the sun. The disc was and blue, and
the little clouds that flecked the sky were iridescent. Crowds
still poured up the hill, and the slope was now covered with
people. He had to stand up, and in doing so, he found himself
side by side with the fat man. A strange light was coming to the
world; there were triple shadows on the ground, and the stout
man shifted uneasily.</p>

<p>"Don't like this, Baggin," he said fretfully, "it's
hateful&mdash;never did like these wonders of the sky, they make
me nervous. It's awful. Look out there, out west behind you.
It's black, black&mdash;it's like the end of the world!"</p>

<p>"Cut it out!" said his unimaginative companion.</p>

<p>Then of a sudden the black shadow in the west leaped across
the sky, and the world went grey-black. Where the sun had been
was a hoop of fire, a bubbling, boiling circle of golden light,
and the circling horizon was a dado of bright yellow. It was as
though the sun had set at its zenith, and the sunset glows were
shown, east, west, north, and south.</p>

<p>"My God, this is awful!"</p>

<p>The stout man covered his face with one hand and clung
tightly with the other to Baggin. He was oblivious to
everything, save a gripping fear of the unknown that clawed at
his heart. Baggin himself paled, and set his jaw grimly.</p>

<p>For the moment he was blind and deaf to the hustling,
murmuring crowd about him; he only knew that he stood in the
darkness at high noon, and that something was happening which he
could not compress within the limits of his understanding.</p>

<p>Three minutes the eclipse lasted; then, as suddenly as it
began, it ended.</p>

<p>A blazing, blinding wave of light flooded the world, and the
stars that had studded the sky went out.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes, I know I'm a fool." Grayson's face was bathed
in perspiration. "It's&mdash;it's my temperament. But never
again! It's an experience." He shook his head, as his trembling
legs carried him down the hillside.</p>

<p>"You're all right," said Baggin reassuringly.</p>

<p>"I'll admit that it was a bit spooky." He tapped his pocket
mechanically, and stopped dead.</p>

<p>"Gone!" he gasped, and dived into his pocket.</p>

<p>"My memorandum book!" Suddenly he grasped his companion and
shook him savagely.</p>

<p>"It was you, damn you! I felt you pawing over me in the
dark."</p>

<p>Grayson looked at him good-naturedly. "Don't be an ass,
Baggin," he said. "What would I do with your code when I had it?
God knows I don't want the responsibility of this business!"</p>

<p>Baggin released him sullenly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I beg pardon, Grayson. But I did feel hands upon me
in the darkness, and thought at the time it was you. I daresay
it was that accursed Spaniard."</p>

<p>He looked about him eagerly. The crowd was dispersing in all
directions. The stranger was not to be seen.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, the thing was in cipher. He won't be able to
make anything of it, anyway. He probably thought it was a fat
wallet full of money, and will be desperately disappointed." He
laughed mirthlessly. Plainly he was greatly disturbed. Grayson
observed him with a malicious satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't carry valuables around in a place like this,"
he remarked gravely.</p>

<p>The two men descended the hill and made their way to their
hotel.</p>

<p>The stranger went into the cathedral, and took from the
pocket of his mantle a small memorandum book.</p>

<p>"'Men babble away their secrets, and whisper away their
lives,'" he murmured with a smile.</p>

<p>"Never was my friend Baggin more apropos." He set to work
upon the cipher. It was very quiet in the cathedral.</p>

<p>That evening, at ten o'clock, the trim serving-maid tapped
lightly at the sitting-room door of the two American gentlemen,
and tendered Baggin, who answered it, a card.</p>

<p>"Tell him to come up," he said in a surly voice.</p>

<p>He flipped the bit of pasteboard across to his friend.
"Poltavo! What the devil is he doing in this part of the world?
No good, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>A sudden idea shot across his mind and struck him pale. He
stood in the middle of the room, his head down, his brows drawn
blackly together. A red light flickered in his eyes. Grayson,
lounging easily in a deep leather chair, regarded him with
something of the contempt the lazy man always entertains for the
active one. The beginning of a secret dislike formed vaguely in
his brain. His thoughts flew to Poltavo, a bright contrast. "I
wish he would bring me news of Doris," he muttered. A wistful
look crept into his face.</p>

<p>There was a discreet double knock at the door, it fell open,
and Count Poltavo was revealed framed picturesquely in the
archway.</p>

<p>He wore a black felt hat and a velvet-lined <i>cappa</i>
which fell about him in long graceful folds. A small dark
moustache adorned his upper lip. He removed it, and the hat,
gravely, and stood bare-headed before them, a slender,
distinguished figure.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, gentlemen."</p>

<p>He spoke in a soft, well-modulated voice, which held a hint
of laughter. "Mr. Baggin, permit me to restore something of
yours which I&mdash;er&mdash;found upon the hill." He held out
the memorandum book, smiling.</p>

<p class="caption">Baggin sprang at him with an oath...</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>Baggin sprang at him with an oath.</p>

<p>The count, still smiling, flung out his other hand, with a
motion of defence, and the candlelight gleamed brightly upon a
small dagger of Spanish workmanship. "'Ware!" he cried softly.
"That point, I fancy, is sharp."</p>

<p>Baggin fell back a pace, his face twitching with rage.</p>

<p>"You would knife me, an unarmed man!" he cried furiously.
"You low foreign cur!"</p>

<p>The count took a quick step toward him. His eyes sparkled. "I
must ask you to retract that," he said. There was a dangerous
note in his tones like the thin edge of a blade.</p>

<p>Grayson started to his feet. "Gentlemen! Gentlemen!" he
cried. "Are you gone stark mad, to quarrel over such a trifle?
Baggin, stop glaring like a caged beast. Sit down. The count has
returned your book, which doubtless you dropped upon the hill.
And did you not boast that its contents were
undecipherable?"</p>

<p>Baggin took the book. "I may have been over-hasty," he
acknowledged grudgingly, suspicion still in his eye. "But your
disguise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was necessary, my friend, and I accept your apology. Say
nothing more of it." The count unfastened the clasp at his
throat, stuck the dagger into the panel of the door, and hung
his hat and mantle upon it. The moustache he held up between
thumb and forefinger with a grimace.</p>

<p>"How do you like me with mustachios, Mr. Grayson? They fell
off three times to-day." The man whom most of London supposed to
be dead laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"They change the entire cast of your countenance," he
remarked candidly. "They make you look like a rascal."</p>

<p>"That is true," admitted the count. "I have observe' the
same. They bring out the evil streak in my nature. I used to
wear them, five years ago, in London," he continued pensively,
"and then I shaved for&mdash;ah&mdash;aesthetic reasons. Mr. T.
B. Smith does not fancy mustachios. He thought they gave me the
look of a nihilist&mdash;or perhaps a Russian spy. Apropos," he
nodded to Grayson, "he has charge of your case. He is a clever
man, my friend." He sighed gently.</p>

<p>Grayson looked at him sombrely. "I wish I were out of this
job," he muttered, "and back in America with Doris. You saw
her?"he demanded eagerly.</p>

<p>The count nodded, with a significant glance toward Baggin.
The latter caught the look, and suspicion flamed again in his
eye.</p>

<p>"May I ask you a plain question?" he said harshly.</p>

<p>"Surely!"</p>

<p>"How much of this business do you know?"</p>

<p>The count permitted himself a smile. "Since this afternoon,"
he answered softly, "I know&mdash;all."</p>

<p>Baggin's face grew black with rage. "Thief! I knew it!" He
stuttered in the intensity of his passion.</p>

<p>The count surveyed him dispassionately.</p>

<p>"Wrath in, reason out," he murmured. Grayson intervened
again. "For my part," he declared, "I am heartily glad of it.
Poltavo is one of us now, and can tell us what he thinks of the
scheme. I have always wished for his opinion."</p>

<p>Baggin rose abruptly, and strode about the room. Plainly the
man was in a great, almost uncontrollable passion. The veins on
his temples stood out in knots, and his hands clenched and
unclenched spasmodically. Presently he turned, mastering himself
with a strong effort, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"I agree," he said in a constrained voice. "You are one of
us, count." The two shook hands and resumed their chairs.</p>

<p>"And now," said Grayson, "tell us what you think of the
scheme?"</p>

<p>The count hesitated for a minute. "Good," he said at length,
"and bad! Admirable in the general plan, but absurd in some of
the details."</p>

<p>"The general plan was mine," said Baggin gruffly.</p>

<p>"And the absurd details were probably mine," admitted Grayson
with cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"May I give you some suggestions?" asked the count
politely.</p>

<p>"Go ahead!" returned Baggin.</p>

<p>"This afternoon&mdash;after I had deciphered your
notes&mdash;it took me precisely two hours by the cathedral
chimes to work out the key&mdash;I ventured to revise them, and
also to devise a different plan of retirement for the committee.
You would care to know it?" He looked deferentially at Baggin,
whose bent brows relaxed.</p>

<p>"Draw up your chair to the table," he said in reply. "We'll
overhaul the entire proposition. There will be difficulties. If
you could invest an equal share of money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought of that," answered the count simply. "And I fancy
I can&mdash;how you say&mdash;raise the required amount. May I
speak for a moment to Mr. Grayson &mdash;on a very personal
matter?"</p>

<p>He drew the older man aside, and conversed with him briefly,
in low tones.</p>

<p>Surprise, incredulity, displeasure chased each other across
Grayson's countenance in rapid succession. "Very well," he said
finally, somewhat brusquely. "You have my consent&mdash;until I
see Doris."</p>

<p>They returned to the table. "I will be security for Count
Poltavo," he declared to Baggin, "for half-a-million
pounds."</p>

<h2><a id="chap07" name="chap07">VII. &mdash; SOME
DISAPPEARANCES</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN the last week of April, 1908, a notice was
posted on the doors of the London, Manhattan, and Jersey
Syndicate, in Moorgate Street. It was brief, but it was to the
point:</p>

<br>

<p class="note">"Owing to the disappearance of Mr. George T.
Baggin, the L. M. and J. Syndicate has suspended
operations."</p>

<br>

<p>With Mr. Baggin had disappeared the sum of &pound;247,000. An
examination of the books of the firm revealed the fact that the
London, Manhattan, and Jersey Syndicate was&mdash;Mr. Baggin;
that its imposing title thinly disguised the operations of a
bucket-shop, and the vanished bullion had been most
systematically collected in gold and foreign notes.</p>

<p>Mr. Baggin had disappeared as though the earth had swallowed
him up. He was traced to Liverpool. A ticket to New York had
been purchased by a man answering to his description, and he had
embarked on the <i>Lucania</i>. The liner called at Queenstown,
and the night she left, Mr. "Coleman" was missing. His clothing
and trunks were found intact in his cabin. The ship was searched
from stem to stern, but no trace of the unfortunate man could be
discovered. The evening newspapers flared forth with, "Tragic
End of a Defaulting Banker," but Scotland Yard, ever sceptical,
set on foot certain enquiries and learnt that a stranger had
been seen in Queenstown after the ship sailed. A stranger who
left for Dublin, and who doubled back to Heysham; who came,
<i>via</i> Manchester, back to London again. In London he had
vanished completely. Whether or not this was the redoubtable
George T. Baggin, was a matter for conjecture.</p>

<p>T.B. Smith, of Scotland Yard, into whose hands the case was
put, had no doubt at all. He believed that Baggin was alive.</p>

<p>Most artistic of all was the passing of Lucas Damant, the
Company Promoter. Damant's defalcations were the heaviest, for
his opportunities were greater. He dealt in millions and stole
in millions. Taking his holiday in Switzerland, Mr. Damant
foolishly essayed the ascent of the Matterhorn without a guide.
His alpenstock was picked up at the edge of a deep
<i>crevasse</i>, and another Alpine disaster was added to the
alarming list of mountaineering tragedies. What time four expert
guides were endeavouring to extricate the lost man from a
bottomless pit, sixteen chartered accountants were engaged in
extracting from the chaos of his documentary remains the true
position of Mr. Damant's affairs, but the sixteen accountants,
had they been sixteen hundred, and the space of time occupied in
their investigations a thousand years, would never have been
able to balance the Company Promoter's estate to the
satisfaction of all concerned, for between debit and credit
yawned an unfathomable chasm that close on a million pounds
could not have spanned.</p>

<p>In the course of time a fickle public forgot the sensational
disappearance of these men; in course of time their victims died
or sought admission to the workhouse. There were spasmodic
discussions that arose in smoke-rooms and tap-rooms, and the
question, as to whether they were dead or whether they had
merely bolted, was hotly debated, but it may be truthfully said
that they were forgotten; but not by Scotland Yard, which
neither forgets nor forgives.</p>

<p>The Official Memory sits in a big office that overlooks the
Thames Embankment. It is embodied in a man who checks, day by
day, hour by hour, and minute by minute, the dark happenings of
the world. He is an inconsiderable person, as personalities go,
for he enters no witness-box to testify against a pallid
prisoner. He grants no interviews to curious newspaper
reporters, he appears in no magazines as a picturesque detector
of crime, but silently, earnestly, and remorselessly he marks
certain little square cards, makes grim entries in strange
ledgers, consults maps, and pores over foreign newspaper
reports. Sometimes he prepares a <i>dossier</i> as a cheap-jack
makes up his prize packet, with a paper from this cabinet, a
photograph from that drawer, a newspaper-cutting, a docketed
deposition with the sprawling signature of a dying man, a
finger-print card&mdash;and all these he places in a large
envelope, and addresses it in a clerkly hand to Chief Inspector
So-and-So, or to the "Director of Public Prosecutions." When the
case is over and a dazed man sits in a cell at Wormwood Scrubbs
pondering his sentence, or, as it sometimes happens, when
convict masons are at work carving initials over a grave in a
prison-yard, the envelope comes back to the man in the office,
and he sorts the contents jealously. It is nothing to him, the
sum of misery they have cast, or the odour of death that
permeates them. He receives them unemotionally, distributes the
contents to their cabinets, pigeon-holes, guard-books, and
drawers and proceeds to make up yet another <i>dossier</i>.</p>

<p>All things come to him; crime in all its aspects is veritably
his stock-in-trade.</p>

<p>When George T. Baggin disappeared in 1908, his simple
arrangement of indexing showed the connection between the
passing of Lucas Damant, six months later, and the obliteration
of Gerald Grayson. The Official Memory knew, too, what the
public had no knowledge of: namely, that there had been
half-a-dozen minor, but no less mysterious, flittings in the
space of two years.</p>

<p>Their stories, briefly and pithily told, were inscribed on
cards in the silent man's cabinet. Underneath was the
significant word, "Incomplete." They were stories to be
continued; some other hand than his might take up the tale at a
future time, and subscribe "<i>Finis</i>" to their grim
chapters. He was satisfied to carry the story forward as far as
his information allowed him.</p>

<p>There never was a more fascinating office than this of the
Silent Recorder's. It was terribly business-like, with its
banked files, its innumerable drawers, its rows of deep
cabinets. "A, B, C, D," they ran; then began all over again,
"AA, BB, CC," except the big index drawer where "Aabot, Aaroon,
Aato, Abard, Abart" commenced the record of infamous men. There
were forgers here, murderers, coiners, defaulters great and
small. There are stories of great swindles, and of suspected
swindles, of events apparently innocent in themselves, behind
which lie unsuspected criminalities.</p>

<p>I show you this office, the merest glimpse of it, so that as
this story progresses, and information comes mysteriously to the
hand of the chief actor, you will understand that no miracle has
been performed, no Heaven-sent divination of purpose has come to
him, but that at the back of the knowledge he employs with such
assurance is this big office at New Scotland Yard. A pleasant
office, overlooking the Embankment with its green trees and its
sunny river and its very pleasant sights&mdash;none of which
the Recorder ever sees, being short-sighted from overmuch study
of criminal records.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap08" name="chap08">VIII. &mdash; THE AMBASSADOR
TAKES A HAND</a></h2>

<p class="first">MR. JOHN HAMMOND BIERCE, American Ambassador
and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of Saint James, sat in
his spacious private office, and listened with an air of grave
attention to the story his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; poured into his ears.
As Van Ingen concluded, the great man leaned back in his
swivel-chair until the spring creaked, and stifled a yawn
behind a white, well-groomed hand.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," he said, "this is a very sad tale, and I am
genuinely sorry for Miss Grayson. Her father appears to have
been a rascal. But," he smiled across at his youthful visitor,
"I do not quite see what the American ambassador has to do with
the business. I understand you consulted me in my official
capacity."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I thought perhaps you might wish to take some
action&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the man is dead!" exclaimed the ambassador. "Dead and
buried."</p>

<p>"That is just the question!" cried Cord eagerly. "<i>Is</i>
he dead? For my part, I suspect he is very much alive and
kicking. His suicide was only a ruse, to mask his plans from the
public."</p>

<p>"A very successful one!" retorted the older man drily. "His
daughter identified the body and was present at its burial. It
was in all the papers."</p>

<p>"That is another point!" exclaimed Van Ingen. "Not once was I
permitted to view the body. I was even denied admittance to the
house until three days after the funeral. Throughout the affair
the utmost secrecy was observed."</p>

<p>"That seems natural, under the circumstances."</p>

<p>Van Ingen coloured warmly. "Pardon me, it is not natural,
sir, when you know all the circumstances. I was an intimate of
the family&mdash;almost, one might say, in the position of a
son." He halted, and then continued, with a certain dignity:</p>

<p>"I have not spoken on the subject to you before, sir, chiefly
because there has been nothing definite to say. But Miss Grayson
is, I hope and pray, sir, my future wife."</p>

<p>"Ah!" The ambassador surveyed him with a keen but kindly
glance.</p>

<p>"I feel bound," he observed thoughtfully, "to make a few
remarks, both as your guardian and as a man who has seen
something of the world. The wife of a rising young diplomat must
be, like Caesar's wife, above reproach. In short, my dear boy,
to marry Miss Grayson will absolutely ruin your career."</p>

<p>Van Ingen sprang to his feet; his face was livid with
anger.</p>

<p>"Then, sir," he cried hotly, "I shall ruin my career, with
the greatest pleasure in life. Miss Grayson&mdash;Doris&mdash;is
worth inestimably more to me than any paltry success, or
material advantage. Moreover," he continued, composing himself
with a strong effort, "I disagree with you, even upon worldly
grounds. Marriage with Doris will not mar me&mdash;it will make
me. Without her, I shall be ineffectual, a nobody to the end of
my days. Without her, living has no aim, no purpose. She
justifies existence. I can't explain these things, sir, even to
you. I&mdash;I love her!"</p>

<p>"So it would seem!" murmured the ambassador. The sternness
had melted out of his face, leaving a whimsical tenderness.</p>

<p>"Sit down, my dear boy! Other people have been as hot in love
as you before now&mdash;and as rashly headstrong." A shade
passed over his features. "Come, let us get down to business.
What is it you wish me to do&mdash;administer a love-potion to
the young woman? Or restore the father to life?"</p>

<p>"I want you to investigate the case," Cord replied simply.
"Or rather, give me the power to do so."</p>

<p>"There's Scotland Yard, you know," suggested his friend
mildly.</p>

<p>"They could co-operate with us. In fact, that is what I
should like to ask. That you send for Mr. T.B. Smith, who is
already in charge of the business, and tell him that a certain
strangeness in the circumstances has aroused your suspicions,
and that you wish to sift the affair to the bottom. But since
you cannot move openly, on account of your conspicuous position,
you desire to join forces secretly, and to that end you offer a
bonus of &pound;500 to clear up the mystery&mdash;to prove,
satisfactorily, that Grayson either is, or is not, dead."</p>

<p>"Five hundred pounds!" mused the ambassador. "You are in
love!"</p>

<p>Van Ingen flushed at the thrust. "I am in earnest," he said
simply.</p>

<p>The ambassador studied his finger-tips. "I might say," he
observed gravely, "that such a course as you outline&mdash;minus
the &pound;500&mdash;had already occurred to me. Certain
financial&mdash;er&mdash;adventures in which Grayson was
engaged, with others, have come before my attention, and it
appeared advisable to throw a searchlight upon the somewhat
shadowy obscurity of his death. But my attitude in the
investigation differs slightly from yours." His eyes, suddenly
upraised, were slightly quizzical.</p>

<p>Van Ingen leaned forward breathlessly. He appeared to hang on
his companion's words. "Go on! Go on, sir!" he urged.</p>

<p>The older man continued: "I do not ask, then, as you, where
is Mr. Grayson? I ask, where is Mr. Grayson's money? The
gentleman may be in heaven, or&mdash;ah!&mdash;elsewhere;
presumably the latter. But, in either case, his money is not
with him. Where is it, then? These, and several other
interesting queries, I am waiting to put to Mr. Smith"&mdash;he
took out his watch&mdash;"who is due here in precisely ten
minutes."</p>

<p>He smiled blandly at the young man, who seized his hand and
wrung it fervently.</p>

<p>"And you will let me work under him, for you?"</p>

<p>"That was my intention before this interview. But, since your
revelation, I doubt its wisdom. Coolness, impartiality of
judgment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, come, sir!" protested Van Ingen, reddening. "I think
I've had enough!"</p>

<p>The ambassador laughed. "Perhaps you have," he conceded.
"Especially as the young lady has not yet struck her
colours&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Nor shows the slightest signs of doing so," replied Van
Ingen ruefully. "There's another fellow making the
running&mdash;that foreign beggar, Poltavo."</p>

<p>The ambassador looked up swiftly. "Not Count Poltavo,
distantly related to the Czar?"</p>

<p>"Related to the devil!" muttered Van Ingen gloomily. "The way
he gets around Doris&mdash;"</p>

<p>His guardian looked a little disturbed. "I am sorry for you,
my boy. Poltavo is a strong man. I fancy he will give you quite
a fight." There was a discreet knock at the door, and, at the
ambassador's call, Jamieson entered. He bore a card, which he
laid upon the table.</p>

<p>"I told him that you were engaged, Mr. Bierce, but he said he
came in answer to your note."</p>

<p>"Quite right!" replied the ambassador briskly.</p>

<p>"Show him in at once." As the secretary vanished, the older
man held up the bit of engraved pasteboard before the astonished
eyes of his young friend. "Apropos!" he murmured.</p>

<p>Van Ingen reached for his hat. "I must be going," he said
hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Not so fast!" The ambassador waved him back to his chair.
"Sit still. The investigation has begun!"</p>

<p>The door opened, and Count Poltavo entered the room.</p>

<p>The ambassador received him cordially. "It was good of you to
come so promptly," he said.</p>

<p>"I daresay my note puzzled you."</p>

<p>"I shall not deny it," smiled the count. He bowed politely to
Van Ingen. "As you see, I have come directly on the heels of it,
to hear the question."</p>

<p>"I shall not keep you in suspense, Count Poltavo," replied
the ambassador gravely, "but come at once to the point. Briefly,
some data which lie before me"&mdash;he tapped a typewritten
report upon the table&mdash;"connect you, somewhat vaguely, with
a certain recent event. For reasons, I propose to investigate
that event, and a truthful statement on your part&mdash;"</p>

<p>The count elevated his eyebrows slightly.</p>

<p>"Pardon me! I withdraw the unnecessary adjective."</p>

<p>The count bowed. "And a statement on my part&mdash;" he
murmured.</p>

<p>"Would be of great value to me at the present moment. And so
I have ventured to write to you, as one gentleman to another, to
beg your assistance."</p>

<p>"And the question?" The count's voice was like velvet. He
outlined a pattern of the carpet with his cane.</p>

<p>The ambassador regarded him somewhat sternly. "How did you
spend the evening of the eighteenth of this month?"</p>

<p>The count's composure did not fail him. Not a muscle of his
face moved under the sharp scrutiny of his questioner, but he
hesitated a perceptible moment.</p>

<p>"The eighteenth?" He wrinkled his brows, in an effort at
recollection. "Pardon me!" He took out a small, black,
leather-bound book. "I sometimes scribble in it my random
thoughts," he explained. "It may contain something which will
aid my memory of that particular night. Ah!" His face beamed.
"Here it is! The night of the eighteenth, I was at the opera
with Lady Dinsmore and her charming niece. Afterwards, I had a
most interesting conversation with Mr. Van Ingen, in which he
confided to me&mdash;ah! &mdash;his age." He looked up
brightly.</p>

<p>"Is that helpful?"</p>

<p>The ambassador smiled grimly. "And then?"</p>

<p>"Then we parted. I strolled for perhaps ten minutes, and took
a taxi-cab home." He appeared to reflect a moment. "I went
directly to my study, and wrote for some time&mdash;several
hours, perhaps. Later, I read." He paused, and then added: "I am
not, at any time, an insatiable sleeper. Four, or five hours at
best, are all that I can manage. That morning it was dawn when I
retired, and a faint, ghostly light was filtering through the
shutters. I remember flinging them wide to look out, and
wondering what the new day would bring to the world. It
brought," he concluded quietly, "great grief to my dear
friends."</p>

<p>He rose as he finished. "And now I regret that another
engagement&mdash;with Lady Dinsmore, in truth&mdash;cuts short
my time. I am glad if I have been able to aid you. And you will
let me know if I can be of further service to you in this
lamentable business." He held out his hand. The ambassador sat
still in his chair, smiling.</p>

<p>"One moment, my dear count, and, if Lady Dinsmore complains,
refer her to me."</p>

<p>The count looked at him amiably. "There is still another
question?" he murmured.</p>

<p>"A small part of the same one," the ambassador emended
smoothly. "Where were you in the early part of the
evening&mdash;<i>before</i> the opera?"</p>

<p>Poltavo laughed softly. "That is true," he admitted. "For the
moment I had completely forgotten. I dined at an unconscionably
early hour with a business associate&mdash;I regret that I
cannot give you his name&mdash;"</p>

<p>The ambassador glanced down at his report.</p>

<p>"Baggin?" he suggested.</p>

<p>The count turned a little white, but he answered composedly.
"It is true. I dined with Mr. Baggin."</p>

<p>"And did not Mr. Grayson call you up over the telephone
during dinner?"</p>

<p>"Some one called Mr. Baggin," responded the count
indifferently. "I remember, because the fish grew cold and had
to be sent away."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;we discussed&mdash;business. I have a little
money lying idle which I desired Mr. Baggin to invest for me.
Unfortunately, the sum was too small for his purpose."</p>

<p>"And when did you join Mr. Grayson?"</p>

<p>The count stared. "Not at all!" He glanced down at the
typewritten sheets, and an ironical smile touched his lips.
"Your report appears to be&mdash;ah!&mdash;defective.</p>

<p>"It is," agreed the ambassador. "I had hoped to supplement it
by your information. May I ask you again&mdash;Did you not see
Mr. Grayson at some time during the evening of the
eighteenth?"</p>

<p>The count shook his head. "I did not," he replied simply. "I
affirm it, upon the honour of a Poltavo."</p>

<p>The ambassador sighed. "Then we are still in the dark," he
said ruefully. "But I thank you for your courtesy. Would you
care to know why I have sought you out, openly, in this
extraordinary fashion?"</p>

<p>"Because you are an extraordinary man," returned the count,
with a deep bow. The ambassador made a motion of dissent.</p>

<p>"Because I am your well-wisher, Count Poltavo," he said
earnestly. "You are, I believe, a poet, a philosopher, a
dreamer&mdash;not a common, base money-grabber. And, therefore,
I should deeply regret to find you connected in any way with
this present investigation, and I sincerely trust that in the
future your name will not appear in these&mdash;
ah!&mdash;defective reports. Frankly, I like you, Count
Poltavo." He held out his hand. "Good-morning. I thank you for
your extreme good nature in answering my questions."</p>

<p>The count appeared moved. Throughout his life, this strange
man remained deeply susceptible to expressions of regard from
his associates, and was always melted, for the moment, by
sincere affection. Indeed, his natural tenderness, offspring of
his heart, and his haughty ambitions, offspring of his head,
were ever in deadly conflict, and his hardness conquered only by
the supremest act of his will.</p>

<p>He grasped the outstretched hand cordially.</p>

<p>"You are very kind!" he said. "And I shall repay you by
endeavouring that my name does not again appear in that
reprehensible report." He laid a hand upon the sheaf of papers.
"I should like to see it?" he asked simply.</p>

<p>The ambassador laughed outright. "My dear count," he
exclaimed, "your powers are wasted as a private gentleman! You
should be the ambassador of your imperial kinsman. There, your
abilities would have adequate scope."</p>

<p>The count laughed, and glanced again at the report. "I shall
see you next week at the Duke of Manchester's," he said. "The
duchess read me yesterday her list of names. I was rejoiced to
see it included yours." He bowed again, and withdrew.</p>

<p>The ambassador stared after him somewhat gloomily, took a
turn about the room, and stopped in front of the young man. At
sight of his doleful countenance, his own face brightened.</p>

<p>"Well?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Van Ingen looked sheepish. "I give up!" he replied. "The
rascal's as deep as a well. But he seemed to me to be telling
the truth."</p>

<p>"He was!" agreed the ambassador promptly.</p>

<p>"He is a great man&mdash;and a dangerous one. He has an
unquenchable spirit."</p>

<p>He took out his watch. "Smith has failed us," he remarked.
"But it is no matter. He sent in this morning his detailed
report. I will turn that over to you, my boy, since you have
volunteered your services in this business. Read it with
care&mdash;it contains some remarkable statements&mdash;and
return it to Mr. Smith, in person. Why not drop around to his
chambers, this evening and see what has detained him? Wait! I'll
give you a line to him."</p>

<p>He scribbled a note hastily, and thrust it and the report
into the young man's hands. "And now, clear out!" He waved his
hands laughingly.</p>

<p>"Don't return until you can explain&mdash;everything! Off
with you!"</p>

<p>On the way out, Cord paused to examine his mail. One letter
was from Doris. He broke the seal with fingers that trembled
slightly. It contained but a single sentence.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"Can you come to me at nine o'clock?
<span class="smcap">Doris</span>."</p>

<br>

<p>Despite his joy at receiving such a token of friendship, his
face clouded. Nine o'clock! It was an awkward hour. He had
planned to spend the entire evening with the detective. He
determined to read the report, dine with Smith, if he could
catch him, and go on later to Lady Dinsmore's. His spirits rose
with a bound at the prospect.</p>

<p>But he was destined to disappointment. Mr. Smith was not to
be found at his chambers, nor at Scotland Yard, nor in any of
his accustomed haunts. Nor had he left any instructions with his
man. At five o'clock, after repeated attempts, Cord gave up the
project, somewhat sulkily, and sent two messages. He would stay
for a short half-hour with Doris, and then drive around to the
apartment of the detective, trusting that he might have
returned.</p>

<p>That evening, at nine o'clock, he was ushered into Lady
Dinsmore's drawing-room by a deferential footman, who went to
announce his presence. Cord moved about restlessly. His forehead
throbbed madly with overwrought nerves, for, since the reading
of the report, he had felt wildly excited. It was safely folded
away in an inner pocket, together with a telegram from T.B.
Smith, bearing the single word, "Delighted!"</p>

<p>When at length Doris appeared, Cord was struck with the
pallid beauty of the girl. Her animation and glow had departed,
and her red lips, usually a Cupid's-bow of laughter, drooped
pitifully at the corners. Her high-necked gown of deepest black
gave her the look of a sorrowing nun. Nor did her manner
reassure him; it was vague and remote, and Cord, who had meant
to pour out his heart in sympathy, found himself chilled, and
stammering forth absurd inanities. The half-hour passed on
leaden foot. Doris explained, in a listless voice, that she was
leaving soon, with her aunt, for the Continent, to travel
indefinitely. She had meant to go away, quietly, without a word,
but she found that she wished to see him once more&mdash;she
faltered piteously.</p>

<p>Cord stood up abruptly. The interview had suddenly become
unendurable to him.</p>

<p>"I shall see you again to-morrow!" he assured her.</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly. "This is the end, dear Cord. Our
paths lie apart in the future. Yours is a fair, shining one,
with success just ahead. Mine&mdash;" She gave a gesture of
despair. "Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Cord took both her hands in his. "Good-night! I shall come
again in the morning." He felt an almost overmastering desire {o
take her into his arms, to whisper into her ear the secret of
the report.</p>

<p>She walked with him to the outer door and let him out into
the cool darkness of the night.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" she said again. She seemed vaguely uneasy, and
bent forward, peering about her. "Is that your taxi-cab?" she
asked sharply. Cord reassured her.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I have a presentiment that something is going to
happen." She spoke in a low voice, full of emotion. "You will be
careful&mdash;for my sake?"</p>

<p>Cord laughed, with a commingling of the joy and tender pride
which a man feels toward the anxiety of the one woman in the
world.</p>

<p>"I will be most careful," he promised, "and I will report my
welfare to you in the morning!"</p>

<p>The door closed between them, and he went down the steps,
whistling cheerfully.</p>

<p>The taxi-cab drew alongside. He gave the address to the
driver, and sprang in, triumphant, hopeful. In front of the
house of the detective, he descended and halted a moment upon
the pavement, searching in an inner pocket for change. Something
rushed upon him from behind; he swerved, instinctively, and
received a stinging blow across the head and neck. As he sank
helplessly to his knees, blinded by pain, but still conscious, a
hand from behind inserted itself into his pocket. Cord resisted
with all his strength. "Smith!" he shouted. Something heavy
descended upon his head. There was a sudden blaze of falling
stars all about him,&mdash;and then blackness, oblivion. When he
regained consciousness, he was lying upon a couch, and Smith was
bending over him.</p>

<p>"That was a narrow squeak, my friend!" he said cheerfully.
"You may thank your lucky stars that you missed the full force
of that first blow." Van Ingen blinked feebly. There was still a
horrid buzzing in his ears, and Smith's voice sounded as from a
great distance. The room swam in great circles around him.</p>

<p>"The report?" he asked faintly.</p>

<p>"They got it!" admitted Smith, who did not seem deeply
downcast at its loss. "But they didn't get you, my boy! So that
I think we may regard their job as a failure."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap09" name="chap09">IX. &mdash; INTRODUCING
T.B. SMITH</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN the month of May the market, that unfailing
barometer of public nerves, moved slowly in an upward
direction.</p>

<p>If the "House" was jubilant, the "Street" was no less
gratified, for since the "Baggin Failure" and financial
cataclysm, which dragged down the little investors to ruin,
there had been a sad flatness in the world of shares. There are
many places of public resort where the "Street" people
meet&mdash;those speculators who daily, year in and out,
promenade the pavement of Throgmorton Street, buying and selling
on an "eighth" margin. To them, from time to time, come the
bare-headed clerks with news of this or that rise or fall, to
receive instructions gravely imparted, and as gravely accepted,
and to retire to the mysterious deeps of the "House" to execute
their commissions.</p>

<p>The market was rising, steadily as the waters of a river
rise; that was the most pleasant knowledge of all. It did not
jump or leap or flare; it progressed by sixteenths, by
thirty-seconds, by sixty-fourths; but all down the money columns
in the financial papers of the press were tiny little plus marks
which brought joy to the small investor, who is by nature a
"bull."</p>

<p>Many people who are not directly interested in finance
regarded the signs with sympathy. The slaves of the street,
'busmen, cabmen, the sellers of clamorous little financial
papers, all these partook in the general cheeriness.</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly climbed the market.</p>

<p>"Like old times!" said a hurrying clerk; but the man he spoke
to sniffed contemptuously, being by nature one of that sour
class from which all beardom is recruited.</p>

<p>"Like old times!" chuckled a man standing at the Bodega bar,
a little dazed with his prosperity. Somebody reminded him of the
other booms that had come and undergone sudden collapse, but the
man standing at the counter twiddled the stem of the glass in
his hand and smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>"Industrials are the feature," said an evening paper, and
indeed the biggest figures behind the tiny plus marks were those
against the famous commercial concerns best known in the city.
The breweries, the bakeries, the cotton corporations, the
textile manufacturing companies enjoying quotation in the share
list&mdash;all these participated in the upward rush; nay, led
the van.</p>

<p>Into Old Broad Street, on one day at the height of the boom,
came a man a little above middle height, clean-shaven, his face
the brick-tan of one who spends much of his life in the open
air. He wore a suit of blue serge, well-cut but plain, a
spotless grey Tirai hat, broad-brimmed, white spats over his
patent shoes, and a thin cane in his hand. "A fellow in the
Kaffir market&mdash;" guessed one of the group about the corner
of 'Change Alley, but somebody better informed turned hastily
when he saw the quick, striding figure approaching, and dived
down a side court.</p>

<p>A showily attired young man, standing on the edge of the
pavement chewing a quill toothpick thoughtfully, did not see the
newcomer until he was close on him, then started and changed
colour. The man in the wide-brimmed hat recognised him and
nodded. He checked his walk and stopped.</p>

<p>"Here's Moss," he said. He had a snappy, curt delivery and a
disconcerting habit of addressing one in the third person. "How
is Moss? Straight now? Straight as a die, I'll swear. He's given
up rigging, given up Punk Prospectuses for Petty Punters. Oh,
Moss! Moss!"</p>

<p>He shook his head with gentle melancholy, though a light
twinkled in his humorous grey eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know why you're so 'ard on me, Mister Smith," said
the embarrassed Moss; "we've all got our faults&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not me, Mr. Moss," said T.B. Smith promptly.</p>

<p>"I dessay even you, sir," insisted the other.</p>

<p>"I've 'ad my flutter; and I failed. There's lots of people
who've done more than I ever done, worse things, and crookeder
things, who are livin' in what I might call the odour of
sanctity."</p>

<p>"There's people in the 'Ouse," Moss wagged an admonitory
finger towards 'Change, and his tone was bitter but envious,
"who've robbed by the million, an' what do we see?"</p>

<p>T.B. Smith shook his head.</p>

<p>"We see," said the indignant young man, "motor-cars, an'
yachts, an' race-horses&mdash;because they 'aven't been found
out!"</p>

<p>"Moral," mused T.B. Smith: "don't allow yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, I know." Moss loftily waved aside the dubious
morality of Mr. Assistant-Commissioner Smith. "But I was found
out. Twelve months in the second division. Is that justice?"</p>

<p>"It all depends," cautiously, "what you mean by justice. I
thought the sentence was rather light."</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr. Smith," said Mr. Moss firmly; "&mdash;let's
put the matter another way round. Here's Baggin's case, an'
Grayson's case. Now, I ask you, man to man, are these chaps
dead?"</p>

<p>T.B. Smith was discreetly silent.</p>

<p>"Are they dead?" again demanded Moss, with emotion. "You know
jolly well they ain't. You know as well as I do who's at the
bottom of these bear raids to send the market into the mud. I
know them raids!" In his excitement Mr. Moss got farther and
farther away from the language of his adoption. "They smell o'
Baggin, George T. Baggin; he's operatin' somewhere. I recognise
the touch. George T. Baggin, I tell you, an', as the good book
says, his right hand hath not lost its cunnin'."</p>

<p>"And," said T.B. Smith, blandly ignoring the startling
hypothesis; "what is Mr. Moss doing now to earn the bread,
butter, and <i>et ceteras</i> of life?"</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, I'm in the East mostly," said the other
moodily;&mdash;" got a client or two; give a tip an' get a tip
now an' again. Small money an' small profits."</p>

<p>He dropped his eyes under the steady and pseudo-benevolent
gaze of the other.</p>

<p>"No companies?" said the detective softly.</p>

<p>"No companies, Mr. Moss? No Amalgamated Peruvian Concessions,
eh? No Brazilian Rubber and Exploitation Syndicate?"</p>

<p>The young man shifted his feet uneasily.</p>

<p>"Genuine concerns, them," he said doggedly; "an', besides,
I'm only a shareholder."</p>

<p>"Not promoter. Mr. Moss is not a promoter?"</p>

<p>In desperation the badgered shareholder turned.</p>

<p>"How in 'Eaven's name you get hold of things I don't know,"
he said in helpless annoyance.</p>

<p>"An' all I can say&mdash;excuse me."</p>

<p>T.B. Smith saw his expression undergo a sudden change.</p>

<p>"Don't look round, sir," said the other breathlessly;
"there's one o' my clients comin' along; genuine business, Mr.
Smith; don't crab the deal."</p>

<p>In his agitation he grew a little incoherent.</p>

<p>T.B. Smith might have walked on discreetly, leaving Moss to
transact his business in quiet and peace. Indeed, the young
man's light-blue eyes pleaded for this indulgence; but the
gentleman from Scotland Yard was singularly obtuse this
morning.</p>

<p>"You don't want to meet him," urged Mr. Moss. "He's not in
your line, sir; he's a gentleman."</p>

<p>"I think you're very rude, Mr. Moss," said T.B. Smith, and
waited, whilst Moss and client met.</p>

<p>"Permit me," said Moss, with all the grace he could summon at
a moment's notice, "to introduce you to a friend of
mine&mdash;name of Smith&mdash;in the Government."</p>

<p>The stranger bowed and offered a gloved hand.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;" said T.B., hesitant. "I did not quite catch your
name?"</p>

<p>"Count Poltavo," said Mr. Moss defiantly; "a friend of mine
an' a client."</p>

<p>"Delighted to make your acquaintance, count. I have met you
somewhere."</p>

<p>The count bowed.</p>

<p>"It is ver' likely. I have been in England before."</p>

<p>T.B. Smith surveyed the imperturbable foreigner with
interest. Of Count Poltavo's connection with Baggin and with
Grayson he knew from his men's reports, though, as far as
recollection served, he had never seen the man. But a haunting
resemblance troubled him.</p>

<p>He nodded briefly to Moss, and turned away, and five minutes
later had dismissed the incident from his mind.</p>

<p>He continued in the direction of the Mansion House. A famous
banker, passing in his motor brougham, waved his hand in salute;
a city policeman stolidly ignored him.</p>

<p>Along Cheapside, with the deliberate air of a sightseer, the
man in the grey felt hat strolled, turning over in his mind the
problem of the boom.</p>

<p>For it was a problem.</p>

<p>If you see, on one hand, ice forming on a pool, and, on the
other, a thermometer rising slowly to blood-heat, you may be
satisfied in your mind that something is wrong somewhere. Nature
cannot make mistakes. Thermometers are equally infallible. Look
for the human agency at work on the mercury bulb for the jet of
hot air directed to the instrument. In this parable is explained
the market position, and T.B. Smith, who dealt with huge, vague
problems like markets and wars and national prosperity, was
looking for the hot-air current.</p>

<p>The market rises because big people buy big quantities of
shares; it falls because these same people sell, and T.B. Smith
happened to know that nobody was buying. That is, nobody of
account &mdash;Eckhardts, Tollingtons, or Bronte's Bank. You can
account for the rise of a particular share by some local and
favourable circumstance, but when the market as a whole moves
up?</p>

<p>"We can trace no transactions," wrote Mr. Louis Veil,
of the firm of Veil, Vallings &amp; Boys, Brokers, "carried out
by or on behalf of the leading jobbers. The market improvement
in Industrial Stocks is due, as far as we can gather, to
Continental buying&mdash;an unusual circumstance."</p>

<p>Who was the "philanthropist" who was making a market in
stagnant stocks? Whoever it was, he or they repented long before
T.B. Smith had reached the Central Criminal Court, which was his
objective.</p>

<p>He was a witness in the Gildie Bank fraud case, and his
cross-examination at the hands of one of the most relentless of
counsel occupied three hours. This concluded to everybody's
satisfaction, save counsel's, T.B. Smith, who hated the law
courts, walked out into Old Bailey to find newsboys loudly
proclaiming, "Slump on the Stock Exchange!"</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, that bubble's burst!" said T.B. piously, and
walked back to Scotland Yard, whistling.</p>

<p>He did not doubt that the artificial rise had failed, and
that the market had gone back to normal.</p>

<p>At the corner of the Thames Embankment he bought a paper, and
the first item of news he read was:</p>

<br>

<p class="headline">CONSOLS HAVE FALLEN TO 84.</p>

<br>

<p>Now, Consols that morning had stood at 90, and T.B. Smith
stopped whistling.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap10" name="chap10">X. &mdash; THE
ANTICIPATORS</a></h2>

<p class="first">T.B. SMITH strolled into the room of
Superintendent Elk.</p>

<p>Elk is a detective officer chiefly remarkable for his memory.
A tall, thin, sad man, who affects a low turned-down collar and
the merest wisp of a black tie. If he has any other pose than
his desire to be taken for a lay preacher, it is his pose of
ignorance on most subjects. Elk's attitude to the world at large
is comprehended in the phrase, "I am a child in these things,"
which accounts to a very great extent for the rapidity of his
promotion in the Criminal Investigation Department. T.B.'s face
wore a frown, and he twirled a paper-knife irritably.</p>

<p>"Elk," he said, without any preliminary, "the market has gone
to the devil."</p>

<p>"Again?" said Elk politely, having knowledge without
interest.</p>

<p>"Again," said T.B. emphatically, "for the fourth time this
year. I've just seen one of the Stock Exchange Committee, and
he's in a terrible state of mind. Stocks and shares are nothing
to me," the Commissioner went on, seeing the patient boredom on
the other's face, "and I know there is a fairly well-defined law
that governs the condition of the Stock Exchange. Prices go
see-sawing up and down, and that is part of the day's work, but for
the fourth time, and for no apparent reason, the market is
broken. Consols are down to 84."</p>

<p>"I once had some shares in an American copper mine,"
reflected Elk, "and a disinterested stock-jobber advised me to
hold on to them; I'm still holding, but it never occurred to
me&mdash;I lost &pound;500 &mdash;that it was a matter for police
investigation."</p>

<p>The Commissioner stopped in his walk and looked at the
detective.</p>

<p>"There's little romance in finance," he mused, "but there is
something behind all this; do you remember the break of January
4?"</p>

<p>Elk nodded; he saw there was a police side to this slump, and
grew alert and knowledgeable.</p>

<p>"Yankees and gilt-edged American stock came tumbling down as
though their financial foundations had been dug away. What was
the cause?"</p>

<p>Elk thought.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it the suicide of the President of the Eleventh
National Bank?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Happened after the crash," said T.B. promptly. "Do you
remember the extraordinary slump in Russian Fours in
April&mdash;a slump which, like the drop in Yankees, affected
every market? What was the cause?"</p>

<p>"The attempt on the Czar."</p>

<p>"Again you're wrong," said the other; "the slump anticipated
the attempt; it did not follow it. Then we have the business of
the 9th of August."</p>

<p>"The Kaffir slump?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But, surely, the reason for that may be traced," said Elk;
"&mdash;it followed the decision of the Cabinet to abolish
coloured labour in the mines."</p>

<p>"It anticipated it," corrected his chief, with a twinkle in
his eye, "and do you remember no other occurrence that filled
the public mind about that time?"</p>

<p>Elk thought with knit brows.</p>

<p>"There was the airship disaster at the palace. Hike Mills was
put away just about then for blackmail; there was the Vermont
case&mdash;and the Sud Express wreck&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's it," said the Commissioner, "wrecked outside
Valladolid; three killed, many injured&mdash;do you remember
who was killed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Elk slowly, "a Frenchman, whose name I've
forgotten; Mr. Arthur Saintsbury, a King's Messenger&mdash;by
George!" The connection dawned upon him, and T.B. grinned.</p>

<p>"Killed whilst carrying despatches to the King of Portugal,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Those despatches related to the proposed withdrawal of
native labour&mdash;much of which is recruited in Portuguese
West Africa." He paused a moment, and added as an afterthought,
"His despatch-box was never found."</p>

<p>There was silence.</p>

<p>"You suggest?" said Elk suddenly.</p>

<p>"I suggest there is an intelligent anticipator in existence
who is much too intelligent to be at large." The Commissioner
walked to the door. He stood for a moment irresolutely.</p>

<p>"I offer you two suggestions," he said: "the first is that
the method which our unknown operator is employing is not unlike
the method of Mr. George Baggin, who departed this life some
time ago. The second is that, if by any chance I am correct in
my first surmise, we lay this ghost for good and all."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap11" name="chap11">XI. &mdash; AT BRONTE'S
BANK</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT was two days later, when Consols touched 80,
that T.B. Smith gathered in Cord Van Ingen and marched him into
the City.</p>

<p>The agitated Committee-man of the Stock Exchange met them in
his office and led them to his private room.</p>

<p>"I must tell you the whole story," he said, after he had
carefully shut and locked the door. "Last Wednesday, the market
still rising and a genuine boom in sight, Mogseys&mdash;they're
the biggest firm of brokers in the city&mdash;got a wire from
their Paris agents which was to this effect, 'Sell Consols down
to 80.' They were standing then at 90, and were on the up-grade.
Immediately following the wire, and before it could be
confirmed, came another instruction, in which they were told to
sell some gilt-edged stocks&mdash;this was on a rising market,
too&mdash;down to prices specified. I have seen the list, and
taking the prices as they stood on Wednesday morning and the
price they stand at to-day, the difference is
enormous&mdash;something like three millions."</p>

<p>"Which means?"</p>

<p>"Which means that the unknown bears have pocketed that
amount. Well, Mogseys were paralysed at the magnitude of the
order, and cabled away to their agent, asking for particulars,
and were equally dumbfounded to learn that they were acting on
behalf of the Credit Bourbonnais, one of the biggest banks in
the South of France. There was nothing else to do but to carry
out the order, and on Thursday morning they had hammered stocks
down ten points&mdash;stocks that have never fluctuated five
points each way in mortal memory!"</p>

<p>The Committee-man, speaking in tones of reverence of these
imperturbable securities, mopped his forehead with a tumultuous
bandanna.</p>

<p>"Now," he resumed, "we know all the bears throughout all the
world. The biggest of 'em is dead. That was George T. Baggin,
one of the most daring and unscrupulous operators we have ever
had in London. We know every man or woman or corporation likely
to jump onto the market with both feet and set it
sagging&mdash;but there isn't a single known bear who has a hand
in this. We've tried to discover his identity, but we've always
come up against a blank wall&mdash;the bank. The bank can't give
away its client, and, even if it did, I doubt very much whether
we should be any the wiser, for he's pretty sure to have hidden
himself too deep. We'd probably find the bank was instructed by
a broker and the broker by another bank, and we'd be as far off
a solution as ever."</p>

<p>"Is there any cause for the present break?"</p>

<p>"I'm coming to that. In all previous slumps there has been a
very good excuse for a panic hanging round. In the present
instance no such excuse exists. There is a good feeling abroad,
money is free and the Bank Rate is low, and the recent spurt in
Kaffirs and Yankee rails has put a good heart into the
market&mdash;why, even the Brontes have dealt!"</p>

<p>He mentioned the name of the great bank, which, in the City
of London, ranks second to the Bank of England only.</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly the details of their dealing, but it is
pretty generally known in the City that they have increased
their commitments, and, when a conservative house like Bronte's
takes advantage of a spell of prosperity, you may be sure that
peace is in the very air we breathe." T.B. Smith was
thoughtfully rolling a glass paper-weight up and down a
blotting-pad, and Van Ingen, following such a plain lead, was
regarding the ceiling with an air of pained resignation.</p>

<p>Neither of the two spoke when the Committee-man finished his
recital. He waited a little longer for them to offer some
remark, and, finding that neither had any comment to make, he
asked, a little impatiently:</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>T.B. roused himself from his reverie.</p>

<p>"Would you mind telling me the names of the stocks again?" he
asked. "The stocks that are being attacked."</p>

<p>The member recited a list.</p>

<p>"Um!" said the Commissioner thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Industrials, breweries, manufactories&mdash;the very shares
that enjoyed the boom are now undergoing the slump. Will you
give me a Stock Exchange Year-book?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>He unlocked the door and went out, reappearing shortly with a
fat brown volume.</p>

<p>T.B. turned the pages of the book with quick, nervous
fingers, consulting the list at his side from time to time.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said at length, pushing the book from him and
rising.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea&mdash;?" the broker began, and T.B.
laughed.</p>

<p>"You nearly said 'clue'" he smiled; "&mdash;yes, I've lots of
ideas&mdash;I'm just going to work one of them out."</p>

<p>He bowed slightly, and the two men left the building
together. Van Ingen was burning with curiosity, but he wisely
kept silence. At the corner of Threadneedle Street, Smith bought
an evening paper.</p>

<p>"Issued at 4.10," he said, glancing at the "fudge" space,
where the result of a race had been printed, "and nothing has
happened."</p>

<p>He hailed a passing cab, and the two men got in.</p>

<p>"Bronte's Bank, Holborn," was the direction he gave.</p>

<p>"Like the immortal Mrs. Harris, there ain't no Bronte, as you
know," he said. "The head of the business is Sir George
Calliper. He's an austere young man of thirty-five or
thereabouts. President of philosophical societies and patron of
innumerable philanthropies."</p>

<p>"Has no vices," added Van Ingen.</p>

<p>"And therefore a little inhuman," commented T.B. "Here we
are."</p>

<p>They drew up before the severe fa&ccedil;ade of Bronte's, and
dismissed the cab.</p>

<p>The bank was closed, but there was a side door &mdash;if,
indeed, such an insignificant title could be applied to the
magnificent portal of mahogany and brass&mdash;and a bell, which
was answered by a uniformed porter.</p>

<p>"The bank is closed, gentlemen," he said when T.B. had stated
his errand.</p>

<p>"My business is very urgent," said T.B. imperatively, and the
man hesitated.</p>

<p>"I am afraid Sir George has left the building," he said,
"but, if you will give me your cards, I will see."</p>

<p>T.B. Smith drew a card from his case. He also produced a tiny
envelope, in which he inserted the card.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the messenger returned.</p>

<p>"Sir George will see you," he said, and ushered them into an
anteroom. "Just a moment, gentlemen; Sir George is engaged."</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed before he came again. Then he reappeared,
and they followed him along a marble-tiled corridor to the
sanctum of the great man. It was a large room, solidly and
comfortably furnished and thickly carpeted. The only
ornamentation was the beautifully carved mantel, over which hung
the portrait of Septimus Bronte, who, in 1743, had founded the
institution which bore his name.</p>

<p>Sir George Calliper rose to meet them. He was a tall young
man with sandy hair and a high, bald forehead. From his
square-toed boots to his black satin cravat, he was commercial
solidity personified. T.B. noted the black ribbon watchguard, the
heavy dull gold signet-ring, the immaculately manicured nails, the
dangling black-rimmed monocle, and catalogued his observations
for future reference.</p>

<p>Van Ingen, who saw with another eye and from a different
point of view, mentally recorded a rosebud on the carpet and a
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Now, what can I do for you?" asked Sir George; he picked up
the card from the desk and refreshed his memory.</p>

<p>"We're very sorry to trouble you," began T.B. conventionally,
but the baronet waved the apology aside.</p>

<p>"I gather you have not come to see me out of office hours
without cause," he said, and his tone rather suggested that it
would be unpleasant even for an Assistant-Commissioner, if he
had.</p>

<p>"No, but I've come to make myself a nuisance &mdash;I want to
ask you questions," said T.B. coolly.</p>

<p>"So long as they are pertinent to the business in hand, I
shall have every pleasure in answering," replied Sir George.</p>

<p>"First and foremost, is there the slightest danger of
Bronte's Bank failing?" asked T.B. Smith calmly.</p>

<p>The audacity of the question struck the baronet dumb.</p>

<p>"Failing?" he repeated. "Bronte's fail&mdash;Mr. Smith, are
you jesting?"</p>

<p>"I was never more in earnest," said T.B.</p>

<p>"Think what you like of my impertinence, but humour me,
please." The banker looked hard at the man before him, as though
to detect some evidence of ill-timed humour.</p>

<p>"It is no more possible for Bronte's to fail than the Bank of
England," he said brusquely.</p>

<p>"I am not very well acquainted with the practice of banking,"
said T.B., "and I should be grateful if you would explain why it
is impossible for a bank to fail."</p>

<p>If Sir George Calliper had been a little less sure of
himself, he would have detected the monstrous inaccuracy of
T.B.'s confession of ignorance.</p>

<p>"But are you really in earnest?"</p>

<p>"I assure you," said T.B. seriously, "that I regard this
matter as being one of life and death."</p>

<p>"Well," said the banker, with a perplexed frown, "I will
explain. The solvency of a bank, as of an individual, is merely
a matter of assets and liabilities. The liabilities are the
elementary debts, deposits, loans, calls, and such like that are
due from the bank to its clients and shareholders. Sometimes the
liability takes the form of a guarantee for the performance of
certain obligations &mdash;that is clear enough?"</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"Assets may be represented as gold, Government securities and
stock convertible into gold, properties, freehold, leasehold,
land; but you know, of course, the exact significance of the
word assets?"</p>

<p>T.B. nodded again.</p>

<p>"Well, it is a matter of balance," said the banker, "allowing
a liberal margin for the fluctuation of securities, we endeavour
and succeed in keeping a balance of assets in excess of our
liabilities."</p>

<p>"Do you keep gold in any quantity on the premises?&mdash;what
would be the result, say, of a successful burglary that cleared
your vaults?"</p>

<p>"It would be inconvenient," said Sir George, with a dry
smile, "but it would not be disastrous."</p>

<p>"What is your greatest outstanding liability?" demanded
T.B.</p>

<p>The banker looked at him strangely.</p>

<p>"It is queer that you should ask," he said slowly; "&mdash;it
was the subject of a discussion at my board meeting this
afternoon&mdash;it is the Wady Semlik Barrage."</p>

<p>"The Egyptian irrigation scheme?" asked T.B. quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, the bank's liability was very limited until a short
time ago. There was always a danger that the physical
disabilities of the Soudan would bring about a fiasco. So we
farmed our liability, if you understand the phrase. But with the
completion of the dam, and the report of our engineer that it
had been submitted to the severest test, we curtailed the
expensive insurance."</p>

<p>"When are the works to be handed over to the Egyptian
Government?"</p>

<p>Sir George smiled.</p>

<p>"That I cannot tell you," he said; "it is a secret known only
to the directors and myself."</p>

<p>"But until it is officially handed over, you are liable?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to an extent. As a matter of fact, we shall only be
fully liable for one day. For there is a clause in the agreement
which binds the Government to accept responsibilities for the
work seven days after inspection by the works department, and
the bulk of our insurances run on till within twenty-four hours
of that date. I will tell you this much: the inspection has
taken place&mdash;I cannot give you the date&mdash;and the fact
that it was made earlier than we anticipated is responsible for
the cancellation of the insurances."</p>

<p>"One more question, Sir George," said T.B.</p>

<p>"Suppose, through any cause, the Wady Semlik Barrage broke on
that day&mdash;the day upon which the bank was completely
liable,&mdash;what would be the effect on Bronte's?"</p>

<p>A shadow passed over the banker's face.</p>

<p>"That is a contingency I do not care to contemplate," he said
curtly.</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"I have not asked you to explain your mysterious visit," he
said, with a smile, "and I am afraid I must curb my curiosity,
for I have an appointment in ten minutes, as far west as
Portland Place. In the meantime, it may interest you to read the
bank's balance-sheet."</p>

<p>Van Ingen's eye was on him as he opened a drawer in his
desk.</p>

<p>He closed it again hurriedly, with a little frown. He opened
another drawer and produced a printed sheet. "Here it is," he
said. "Would you care to see me again at ten to-morrow?"</p>

<p>T.B. might have told him that for the next twelve hours the
banker would hardly be out of sight for an hour, but he
replied:</p>

<p>"I shall be very pleased."</p>

<p>He had shaken hands with Sir George, and was on his way to
the door, when Van Ingen gave him a sign. T.B. turned again.</p>

<p>"By the way," he said, pointing to the picture over the
fireplace, "that is <i>the</i> Bronte, is it not?"</p>

<p>Sir George turned to the picture.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, and then with a smile: "&mdash;I wonder Mr.
Bronte did not fall from his frame at some of your
questions."</p>

<p>T.B. chuckled softly as he followed the uniformed doorkeeper
along the ornate corridor. In a cab being driven rapidly
westward, Van Ingen solemnly produced his finds.</p>

<p>"A little rose and a handkerchief," he said. T.B. took the
last-named article in his hand. It was a delicate piece of
flimsiness, all lace and fragrance. Also it was damp.</p>

<p>"Here's romance," said T.B., folding it carefully and putting
it in his pocket. "Somebody has been crying, and I'll bet it
wasn't our friend the banker."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap12" name="chap12">XII. &mdash; MURDER</a></h2>

<p class="first">"I'VE got two men on to Sir George," said T.B.
to Van Ingen. They were at the Yard. "I've given them
instructions not to leave him day or night. Now, the question
is, how will the 'bears' discover the fatal day the barrage is
to be handed over to the guileless Fellaheen?"</p>

<p>"Through the Egyptian Government?" suggested Van Ingen.</p>

<p>"That I doubt. It seems a simple proposition, but the issues
are so important that you may be sure our mysterious friends
will not strike until they are absolutely certain. In the
meantime&mdash;"</p>

<p>He unlocked the safe and took out a book.</p>

<p>This, too, was fastened by two locks. He opened it, laid it
down, and began writing on a sheet of paper, carefully,
laboriously checking the result.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THAT night the gentleman who is responsible for
the good order of Egypt received a telegram which ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">PREMIUM FELLOW COLLECT WADY BARRAGE MERIDIAN
TAINTED INOCULATE WEARY SULPHUR.</p>

<br>

<p>There was a great deal more written in the same interesting
style. When the Egyptian Chief of Police unlocked his book to
decode the message, he was humming a little tune that he had
heard the band playing outside Shepheard's Hotel. Long before he
had finished decoding the message, his humming stopped.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the wires were humming, and a battalion of
infantry was hastily entrained from Khartoum.</p>

<p>Having despatched the wire, T.B. turned to the young man, who
was sitting solemnly regarding a small gossamer handkerchief and
a crushed rosebud that lay on the table.</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded T.B. Smith, leaning over the table, "what do
you make of 'em?"</p>

<p>"They are not Sir George's," replied Van Ingen, with a
grin.</p>

<p>"So much I gather," said T.B.</p>

<p>"A client's?"</p>

<p>"A very depressed and agitated client&mdash;feel."</p>

<p>T.B.'s fingers touched the little handkerchief; it was still
quite damp. He nodded.</p>

<p>"The rosebud?"</p>

<p>"Did you notice our austere banker's button-hole?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly&mdash;but I remember no flowers."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Van Ingen, "there were no flowers. I noticed
particularly that his buttonhole was sewn, and yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And yet?"</p>

<p>"Hidden in one of those drawers was a bunch of these roses. I
saw them when he was getting your balance-sheet."</p>

<p>"H'm!" T.B. tapped the table impatiently.</p>

<p>"So, you see," Van Ingen went on, "we have an interest in
this lady client of his, who comes after office hours, weeps
copiously, and leaves a bunch of rosebuds as a souvenir of her
visit. It may have been a client, of course."</p>

<p>"And the roses may have been security for an overdraft," said
the ironic T.B. "What do you make of the handkerchief?"</p>

<p>It was an exquisite little thing of the most delicate
cambric. Along one hem, in letters minutely embroidered in
flowing script, there ran a line of writing. T.B. took up a
magnifying glass and read it.</p>

<p>"'<i>Que dieu te garde</i>,'" he read, "and a little
monogram&mdash;a gift of some sort, I gather. As far as I can
see, the lettering is 'N.H.C.'&mdash;and what that means,
Heaven knows! I'm afraid that, beyond intruding to an
unjustifiable extent into the private affairs of our banker, we
get no further. Well, Jones?"</p>

<p>With a knock at the door, an officer had entered.</p>

<p>"Sir George has returned to his house. We have just received
a telephone message from one of our men."</p>

<p>"What has he been doing to-night&mdash;Sir George?"</p>

<p>"He dined at home; went to his club and returned; he does not
go out again." T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"Watch the house and report," he said. The man saluted and
left.</p>

<p>T.B. turned again to the contemplation of the
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"If I were one of those funny detectives, Mr. Van Ingen, who
live in books," he said sadly, "I could weave quite an
interesting theory from this." He held the handkerchief to his
nose and smelt it.</p>

<p>"The scent is 'Simpatico,' therefore the owner must have
lived in Spain; the workmanship is Parisian, therefore&mdash;"
He threw the flimsy thing from him with a laugh. "This takes us
no nearer to the Wady Barrage, my friend&mdash;no nearer to the
mysterious millionaires who 'bear' the shares of worthy brewers.
Let us go out into the open, and ask Heaven to drop a clue at
our feet." The two men turned their steps towards Whitehall, and
were halfway to Trafalgar Square when a panting constable
overtook them.</p>

<p>"There is a message from the man watching Sir George
Calliper's house, sir," he said; "&mdash;he wants you to go
there at once."</p>

<p>"What is wrong?" asked T.B. quickly.</p>

<p>"A drunken man, sir, so far as I could understand."</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>T.B.'s eyebrows rose, and he smiled incredulously.</p>

<p>"A drunken man," repeated the man; "he's made two attempts to
see Sir George&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hail that cab," said T.B. "We'll drive round and see this
extraordinary person."</p>

<p>A drunken man is not usually a problem so difficult that it
is necessary to requisition the services of an
Assistant-Commissioner. This much T.B. pointed out to the detective
who awaited him at the corner of St. James's Square.</p>

<p>"But this man is different," said the officer; "he's well
dressed; he has plenty of money&mdash;he gave the cab-driver a
sovereign&mdash;and he talks."</p>

<p>"Nothing remarkable in that, dear lad," said T.B.
reproachfully; "we all talk."</p>

<p>"But he talks business, sir," persisted the officer; "boasts
that he's got Bronte's bank in his pocket."</p>

<p>"The devil he does!" T.B.'s eyebrows had a trick of rising.
"Did he say anything else?"</p>

<p>"The second time he came," said the detective, "the butler
pushed him down the steps, and that seemed to annoy him&mdash;he
talked pretty freely then, called Sir George all the names he
could lay his tongue to, and finished up by saying that he could
ruin him."</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"And Sir George? He could not, of course, hear this
unpleasant conversation? He would be out of earshot."</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir," said the plain-clothes man, "but that's
where you're mistaken. I distinctly saw Sir George through the
half-opened door. He was standing behind his servant."</p>

<p>"It's a pity&mdash;" began T.B., when the detective pointed
along the street in the direction of the Square.</p>

<p>"There he is, sir," he whispered; "he's coming again."</p>

<p>Along the pavement, a little unsteadily, a young man walked.
In the brilliant light of a street lamp T.B. saw that he was
well dressed in a glaring way. The Assistant-Commissioner waited
until the newcomer reached the next lamp; then walked to meet
him.</p>

<p>A young man, expensively garbed, red of face, and flashily
jewelled&mdash;at a distance T.B. classified him as one of the
more offensive type of <i>nouveau riche</i>. The stranger would
have passed on his way, but T.B. stepped in front of him.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mr.&mdash;" He stopped with an incredulous gasp.
"Mr. Moss!" he said wonderingly. "Mr. Lewis Moss, some time of
Tokenhouse Yard, company promoter."</p>

<p>"Here, stash it, Mr. Smith," begged the young man. He stood
unsteadily, and in his eye was defiance. "Drop all
that&mdash;reformed&mdash;me. Look 'ere"&mdash;he lurched
forward and caught T.B. by the lapel of his coat, and his breath
was reminiscent of a distillery&mdash;" if you knew what I know,
ah!"</p>

<p>The "ah!" was triumph in a word.</p>

<p>"If you knew what I know," continued Mr. Moss, with relish;
"but you don't. You fellers at your game think you know
<i>toot</i>, as Count Poltavo says; but you don't." He wagged
his head wisely.</p>

<p>T.B. waited.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to see Calliper," Mr. Moss went on, with gross
familiarity, "an' what I've got to say to him is worth
millions&mdash;millions, I tell you. An' when Calliper says to
me, 'Mr. Moss, I thank you!' and has done the right thing, I'll
come to you&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>"I see," said T.B., "but you mustn't annoy Sir George any
more to-night."</p>

<p>"Look here, Smith," Mr. Moss went off at a tangent, "you want
to know how I got acquainted with Count Poltavo&mdash;well, I'll
tell you. There's a feller named Hyatt that I used to do a bit
of business with. Quiet young feller who got marvellous
tips&mdash;made a lot o' money, he did, all because he bowled
out Poltavo&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>He stopped short, for it evidently dawned upon him that he
was talking too much.</p>

<p>"He sent you, eh?" Mr. Moss jerked the point of a gold-mounted
stick in the direction of Sir George's house. "Come down
off his high 'orse "&mdash;the third "h" was too much for
him&mdash;"and very wisely, very wisely." He shook his head
with drunken gravity. "As a man of the world," he went on, "you
bein' one an' me bein' another, it only remains to fix a meeting
between self an' client&mdash;your client&mdash;an' I can give
him a few tips."</p>

<p>"That," said T.B., "is precisely my desire." He had ever the
happy knack of dealing satisfactorily with drunken men. "Now let
us review the position."</p>

<p>"First of all," said Mr. Moss firmly, "who are these people?"
He indicated Van Ingen and the detective. "If they're friends of
yours, old feller, say the word "&mdash;and his gesture was
generous&mdash;"friends of yours? Right!" Once more he became
the man of affairs.</p>

<p>"Let us get at the bottom of the matter," said T.B. "Firstly,
you wish to see Sir George Calliper?"</p>

<p>The young man, leaning against some happily placed railings,
nodded several times.</p>

<p>"Although," T.B. went on, shaking his head reprovingly, "you
are not exactly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A bottle of fizz&mdash;a couple, nothing to cloud the mind,"
said the young man airily. "I've never been drunk in me
life."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that I have heard that remark before," said
T.B., "&mdash;but that's beside the matter; you were talking
about a man called Hyatt who bowled Poltavo."</p>

<p>The young man pulled himself erect.</p>

<p>"In a sense I was," he said, with dignity, "in a sense I
wasn't; and now I must be toddling." T.B. saw the sudden
suspicion that came to him. "What do you know about the
barrage?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>The man started back, sobered.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said harshly. "I know nothing. I know you,
though, Mr. Bloomin' Smith, and you ain't goin' to pump me.
Here, I'm going." He pushed T.B. aside. Van Ingen would have
stopped him but for a look from his companion.</p>

<p>"Let him go," he said. "I have a feeling that&mdash;"</p>

<p>The young man was crossing St. James's Street, and
disappeared for a moment in the gloom between the street lamps.
T.B. waited a time for him to reappear, but he did not come into
sight.</p>

<p>"That's rum," murmured Van Ingen; "he couldn't have gone into
Sir George's; his house is on the other side of the
street&mdash;hello, there he is!"</p>

<p>A man appeared momentarily in the rays of the lamp they were
watching, and walked rapidly away.</p>

<p>"That isn't him," said T.B., puzzled; "he's too tall; it must
be somebody from one of the houses. Let us stroll along and see
what has become of Mr. Moss."</p>

<p>The little party crossed the street. The thoroughfare was
deserted now, save for the disappearing figure of the tall
gentleman.</p>

<p>The black patch where Moss had disappeared was the entrance
of the mews.</p>

<p>"He must have mistaken this for a thoroughfare," said T.B.
"We'll probably find him asleep in a corner somewhere." He took
a little electric lamp from his pocket and shot a white beam
into the darkness.</p>

<p>"I don't see him anywhere," he said, and walked into the
mews.</p>

<p>"There he is!" said Van Ingen suddenly. The man was lying
flat on his back, his eyes wide open, one arm moving feebly.</p>

<p>"Drunk?" said T.B., and leant over him. Then he saw the blood
and the wound in the man's throat.</p>

<p>"Murder! by the Lord!" he cried. He was not dead, but, even
as the sound of Van Ingen's running feet grew fainter, T.B. knew
that this was a case beyond the power of the divisional surgeon.
The man tried to speak, and the detective bent his head to
listen. "Can't tell you all," the poor wreck whispered, "get
Hyatt or the man on the Eiffel Tower&mdash;they know. His
sister's got the book&mdash;Hyatt's sister&mdash;down in
Falmouth&mdash;you'll find N.H.C. I don't know who they are, but
you'll find them." He muttered a little incoherently, and T.B.
strained his ears, but heard nothing. "N.H.C.," he repeated
under his breath, and remembered the handkerchief.</p>

<p>The man on the ground spoke again&mdash;"The
Admiralty&mdash;they could fix it for you. Poltavo&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he died.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap13" name="chap13">XIII. &mdash; HYATT</a></h2>

<p class="first">"GET Hyatt or the man on the Eiffel Tower!"</p>

<p>It sounded like the raving of a dying man, and T.B. shook his
head as, in the company of Van Ingen, he walked back to his
chambers in the early hours of the morning.</p>

<p>Since the night of the assault, the young man had remained as
Smith's guest, at the latter's express command.</p>

<p>"Not that I believe you stand in immediate danger of having
your head broken again by those miscreants," he said laughingly
the next morning, "or that I could protect you if you did! But
since you are in on this thing, and the enemy have got wind of
it, it is as well to join forces. You can run errands, type my
notes, and investigate obscure clues&mdash;in short, become a
useful other self to me. In that way I double my efficiency, and
can be in two places at once!"</p>

<p>And so Van Ingen, nothing loath, had sent for a few
necessaries, and had taken up quarters with the detective.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of the latter, he had not acquainted Doris
with his mishap, the injuries from which were, indeed, slight
enough, consisting only of a bruise, the size of a walnut on the
right side of his head, and an accompanying dizziness when, the
next morning, he attempted to raise his head from the
pillow.</p>

<p>He had scrawled a line to Doris therefore, reporting himself,
per agreement, and inviting himself to tea, to discuss an
important personal matter, the next afternoon at five.</p>

<p>To this he had received, late the same day, posted from
Folkestone, the following reply:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Dear Cord</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">"Owing to a sudden change of plans, we start
for the Continent to-night, and, to-morrow at five, I shall be
having my tea with Aunty in Paris&mdash;and thinking of you!</p>

<p class="letter">"We remain there only for a few days, then on
to the Riviera, and eventually cross into Spain.</p>

<p class="letter">I had something to ask you last night, which
escaped me in the pain of bidding you farewell&mdash;something
you may do for me, which will add to the great debt of gratitude
I already owe you&mdash;and crown it all! Abandon this
investigation! By our dear friendship of many years, I ask
it,&mdash;by the love which you profess for me. It will involve
you in frightful consequences of which I do not dare to speak.
Your bare connection with it fills me with anguish&mdash;I
cannot sleep!... Thank you for the report of your health. I am
nervous and unstrung these days, and filled with imaginary
terrors.</p>

<p class="letter">In your note, you speak of 'an important
personal matter'&mdash;may I interpret the phrase, candidly, and
give you my answer? I esteem you too dear to entangle you in my
own melancholy career. This decision is quite unalterable, and,
moreover, I am not free.</p>

<p class="letter">"There is nothing left to add. God bless
you.</p>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Doris</span>."</p>

<p><br>
This missive Van Ingen did not show to Smith.</p>

<p>With a white bandage about his head, and looking, the
detective declared, "pale and interesting," he sat in an
easy-chair before the open fire, and gloomily reviewed the
situation.</p>

<p>She was not free. That meant Poltavo! Could it be true that
in truth she loved him, then? For a while, he gave himself to
the full bitterness of the idea. Before his mind there arose,
vividly, the picture of the two at the opera&mdash;Poltavo,
elegant, distinguished, speaking in low eager tones, and Doris
bending toward him with parted lips, a divine light in her blue
eyes. As he pondered all the recent circumstances, he felt the
waters of despair pour over his soul. His head still throbbed
from the bruise; he felt feverish and agitated, full of a
burning turmoil, and a longing that knows but one solace.</p>

<p>Again he turned to the letter, seeking, unconsciously, for
some word of comfort to his troubled spirit, and reread it,
slowly.</p>

<p>This time her sweet sympathy shone out at him, like the sun
behind storm-clouds. He remarked, also, the note of despairing
sadness. She was not free! That hinted not of love, but of
compulsion, of an iron necessity laid upon her soul. In a flash
of intuition, the young man glimpsed the real situation. She had
bound herself to the count, in order to save her father!</p>

<p>What had it not cost her to assume that heavy burden? For the
first time he realised something of what the girl, with her high
spirit, and her passionate adoration of her father, must have
suffered at learning that he had perpetrated such a monstrous
fraud on the public; that he was, in truth, a cheat, an outlaw,
and a criminal. Was it any wonder that her cheeks had lost their
colour, her eyes their light, and her figure its youthful
buoyancy and charm? He recalled, with a sharp pang, the pitiful
droop of the slender, black-robed figure when he had last seen
her; her pallor, and the shadow which lay deep, in her eyes.
Fear had looked out of those eyes, fear had trembled in her
voice, as she bade him be careful!... And she had esteemed him
too dear to entangle in her dark fate!... A flood of infinite
tenderness welled up in his breast, a tenderness and an
exquisite yearning which thrilled the young man's soul to the
point of pain. He burned with the desire to stand between her
and her troubles, to carry her off bodily from her enemies, to
conquer a kingdom, or subdue a dragon&mdash;to do any wild, rash
thing to prove his love.</p>

<p>Such moments rarely endure. They pass, these mountain-heights
of exaltation and emotion, but to have experienced them however
briefly, to have loved a woman with such passion and pure
fervour, leaves no man as he was before.</p>

<p>Van Ingen returned to the problem. She had bound herself to
the count.</p>

<p>But Poltavo, according to the detective's theory, was the
master-mind of the conspiracy. How, then, had he tricked her so
completely? How had he gulled them all, he wondered savagely.
Even his chief, the American ambassador, and a judge of men, had
been completely fascinated by the charm of his personality, and
would not hear a word against him.</p>

<p>As for women&mdash;he knew the silly ardent creatures went
down like nine-pins before the smiling glance of his eyes and
the unfailing courtesy of his manners. There was Lady Angela,
the Duke of Manchester's daughter, a slender dryad-girl, with
soft eyes and a halo of pale golden hair, whom the count had
sketched upon a recent visit to their country-house, and whom,
it was reported, he might have any day, for the asking.</p>

<p>"Why don't he ask her, then?" he growled aloud.</p>

<p>The detective, who lounged opposite him, warm coils of smoke
ascending from his briar pipe, regarded him with humorous
eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't follow you," he said. He glanced down at the open
letter, which Van Ingen still held tightly in his hand.</p>

<p>"Do you want him to marry her?"</p>

<p>Van Ingen reddened. "I &mdash;I beg your pardon!" he
stammered. "I was thinking of Lady Angela."</p>

<p>The detective smoked on tranquilly, though it was apparent he
did not get the connection. Van Ingen, however, vouchsafed no
further explanation, and presently the conversation fell upon
other things.</p>

<p>The next morning Cord had awakened greatly refreshed, and
with his resolve strengthened to continue the investigation. In
company with Smith, he had interviewed Sir George Calliper, and
seen the tragic end of Moss. As they walked homeward in the cold
air of the early morning, Cord speculated upon the manner of man
was this Count Poltavo. Beside him, the detective pondered,
grimly, the same problem.</p>

<p>Hyatt&mdash;the man on the Eiffel Tower&mdash;the Wady
Barrage&mdash;the mysterious bears&mdash;what connection was
there one with another?</p>

<br>

<p class="cp"><span class="smcap">To&mdash;Hyatt, A Friend Of
The Late Lewis Moss</span></p>

<p class="newspaper">Information concerning the whereabouts of
the above-mentioned Hyatt is urgently required. Immediate
communication should be made to the nearest police-station.</p>

<br>

<p>This notice appeared under the heading, "Too Late for
Classification," in every London newspaper the morning following
the murder of Moss.</p>

<p>"It is possible that the name is an assumed one," said T.B.,
"but the Falmouth clue narrows the search."</p>

<p>An "all-station" message was flashed throughout the
metropolis:</p>

<br>

<p class="note">"Arrest and detain Count Ivan Poltavo" (here
followed a description), "on suspicion of being concerned in the
murder of Lewis Moss."</p>

<br>

<p>But Count Poltavo anticipated the arrest, for hardly had the
last message been despatched when he himself entered the portico
of Scotland Yard and requested an interview with T.B.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said sadly, "I knew this young man. Poor
fellow!"</p>

<p>He gave a very frank account of his dealings with Moss,
offered a very full explanation of his own movements on the
night of the murder, and was finally dismissed by a perplexed
Commissioner, who detached an officer to verify all that Poltavo
had said.</p>

<p>T.B. was worried, and showed it, after his own fashion. He
sent Van Ingen by an early train to pursue his enquiries in
Cornwall, and then went into the City.</p>

<p>An interview with the head of the banking-house of Bronte was
not satisfactory.</p>

<p>"I am satisfied," said T.B., "that an attempt will be made to
destroy the barrage on the day for which you are liable. All the
features of the present market position point to this fact."</p>

<p>"In that case," said the banker, "the 'bears' must be
clairvoyant. The day on which the barrage comes into the hands
of the Egyptian Government is known to two persons only. I am
one, and the other is a gentleman the mere mention of whose name
would satisfy you as to his integrity."</p>

<p>"And none other?"</p>

<p>"None other," said the banker. And that was all he would
say.</p>

<p>But at six o'clock that night T.B. received a message. It was
written in pencil on the torn edges of a newspaper.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"To-night Sir George Calliper is dining with
the Spanish dancing girl, La Belle Espagnole."</p>

<br>

<p>That, and an initial, was all the note contained, but it came
from the most reliable man in the Criminal Investigation
Department, and T.B. whistled his astonishment.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap14" name="chap14">XIV. &mdash; SIR GEORGE
DINES</a></h2>

<p class="first">SIR GEORGE CALLIPER lived in St. James's
Street. A bachelor&mdash;some regarded him as a
misogynist&mdash;his establishment was nevertheless a model of
order; and if you had missed the indefinable something that
betrays a woman's hand in the arrangement of furniture, you
recognised that the controlling spirit of the household was one
possessed of a rigid sense of domesticity, that found expression
in solid comfort and sober luxury. The banker sat in his study
engaged in writing a letter. He was in evening dress, and the
little French clock on the mantel had just chimed seven. He
finished the note and folded it in its envelope. Then he pressed
a bell. A servant entered.</p>

<p>"I am dining out," said Sir George shortly.</p>

<p>"I shall be home at eleven." It was characteristic that he
did not say "may be home," or "at about eleven."</p>

<p>"Shall I order the car, Sir George?"</p>

<p>"No; I'll take a cab."</p>

<p>A shrill whistle brought a taxi-cab to the door. A passing
commissionaire stopped to ask the cabman which was the nearest
way to Berkeley Square as the banker came down the two steps of
the house.</p>

<p>"Meggioli's," he instructed the cabman, and added, "the Vine
Street entrance."</p>

<p>The commissionaire stood back respectfully as the whining
taxi jerked forward.</p>

<p>"Meggioli's!" murmured the commissionaire, "and by the
private door! That's rum. I wonder whether Van Ingen has started
for Cornwall yet?"</p>

<p>He walked into St. James's Square, and a smart one-horse
brougham, that had been idly moving round the circle of garden
in the centre, pulled up at the curb by his side.</p>

<p>"Meggioli's&mdash;front entrance," said the
commissionaire.</p>

<p>It was a uniformed man who entered the carriage; it was T.B.
Smith in his well-fitting dress clothes who emerged at
Meggioli's.</p>

<p>"I want a private room," he informed the proprietor, who came
to meet him with a bow.</p>

<p>"I'm ver' sorry, Mr. Smith, but I have not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you have three," said T.B. indignantly.</p>

<p>"I offer a thousand regrets," said the distressed
restaurateur; "they are engaged. If you had only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, name of dog! name of a sacred pipe!" expostulated T.B.
unscrupulously. Was it not possible to pretend that there had
been a mistake; that one room had already been engaged?</p>

<p>"Impossible, m'sieur! In No.1 we have no less a person than
the Premier of Southwest Australia, who is being dined by his
fellow-colonists; in No.2 a family party of Lord Redlands; in
No.3&mdash;ah! in No. 3&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, in No. 3!" repeated T.B. cunningly, and the proprietor
dropped his voice to a whisper.</p>

<p>"'La Belle Espagnole'!" he murmured. He named the great
Spanish dancer with relish.</p>

<p>"She, and her <i>fianc&eacute;'s</i> friend, eh?"</p>

<p>"Her <i>fianc&eacute;</i>? I didn't know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is a secret&mdash;" He looked round as if he were fearful
of eavesdroppers. "But it is said that 'La Belle Espagnole' is
to be married to a rich admirer."</p>

<p>"Name?" asked T.B. carelessly.</p>

<p>The proprietor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I do not enquire the name of my patrons," he said, "but I
understand that it is to be the young Lord Carleby."</p>

<p>The name told T.B. nothing.</p>

<p>"Well," he said easily, "I will take a table in the
restaurant. I do not wish to interrupt a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not Carleby to-night," the proprietor hastened to
assure him. "I think mamzelle would prefer that it was&mdash;no;
it is a stranger."</p>

<p>T.B. sauntered into the brilliantly lighted room, having
handed his hat and coat to a waiter. He found a deserted table.
Luck was with him to an extraordinary extent; that Sir George
should have chosen Meggioli's was the greatest good fortune of
all.</p>

<p>At that time Count Menshikoff was paying one of his visits to
England. The master of the St. Petersburg secret police was a
responsibility. For his protection it was necessary that a small
army of men should be detailed, and since Meggioli's was the
restaurant he favoured, at least one man of the Criminal
Investigation Department was permanently employed at that
establishment.</p>

<p>T.B. called a waiter, and the man came swiftly. He had a
large white face, big unwinking black eyes, and heavy bushy
eyebrows, that stamped his face as one out of the common. His
name&mdash;which is unimportant&mdash;was Vellair, and foreign
notabilities his specialty.</p>

<p>"<i>Soup&mdash;consomm&eacute;</i>, <i>cr&egrave;me de&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>T.B., studying his menu, asked quietly, "Is it possible to
see and hear what is going on in No. 3?"</p>

<p>"The private room?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The waiter adjusted the table with a soft professional touch.
"There is a small anteroom, and a ventilator, a table that might
be pushed against the wall and a chair," said the waiter
concisely. "If you remain here I will make sure."</p>

<p>He scribbled a mythical order on his little pad and
disappeared.</p>

<p>He came back in five minutes with a small tureen of soup. As
he emptied its contents into the plate before T.B. he said, "All
right; the key is on the inside.&mdash;The door is numbered
11."</p>

<p>T.B. picked up the wine list.</p>

<p>"Cover me when I leave," he said.</p>

<p>He had finished his soup when the waiter brought him a note.
He broke open the envelope and read the contents with an
expression of annoyance.</p>

<p>"I shall be back in a few minutes," he said, rising;
"&mdash;reserve this table."</p>

<p>The waiter bowed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap15" name="chap15">XV. &mdash; THE DANCING
GIRL</a></h2>

<p class="first">T.B. REACHED the second floor. The corridor was
deserted; he walked quickly to No. 11. The door yielded to his
push. He closed it behind him and noiselessly locked it. He took
a tiny electric lamp from his pocket and threw the light
cautiously round.</p>

<p>He found the table and chair placed ready for him, and
blessed Vellair silently.</p>

<p>The ventilator was a small one; he had located it easily
enough when he had entered the room by the gleam of light that
came through it. Very carefully he mounted the table, stepped
lightly into the chair, and looked down into the next chamber.
It was an ordinary kind of private dining-room. The only light
came from two shaded electric lamps on the table in the
centre.</p>

<p>Sir George, with a frown, was regarding his beautiful
<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>. That she was lovely beyond ordinary loveliness
T.B. knew from repute. He had expected the high colourings, the
blacks and scarlets of the Andalusian; but this girl had the
creamy complexion of the well-bred Spaniard, with eyes that
might have been hazel or violet in the uncertain light, but
which were decidedly not black. Her lips, now tightly
compressed, were neither too full nor too thin; her nose
straight; her hair, brushed back from her forehead in an
unfamiliar style, was that exact tint between bronze and brown
that your connoisseur so greatly values.</p>

<p>A plain <i>filet</i> of dull gold about her head and the
broad collar of pearls around her neck were the only jewels she
displayed. Her dress was black, unrelieved by any touch of
colour. She was talking rapidly in French, a language with which
T.B. was very well conversant.</p>

<p>"&mdash;but, Sir George," she pleaded, "it would be horrible,
wicked, cruel not to see him again!"</p>

<p>"It would be worse if you saw him," said the other drily.
"You know, my dear Miss Dominguez, you would both be miserable
in a month. The title would be no compensation for you; Carleby
would bore you; Carleby House would drive you mad; Carleby's
relatives would incite you to murder."</p>

<p>"You are one!" she blazed.</p>

<p>"Exactly; and do I not exasperate you? Think of me magnified
by a hundred. Come, come, there are better men than Carleby in
the world, and you are young, you are little more than a
child."</p>

<p>"But I love him," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"I suppose you do." T.B., from his hiding-place, bestowed an
admiring grin upon the patronage in the baronet's tone. "When
did you meet him first?"</p>

<p>"Three weeks ago." She spoke with a catch in her voice that
affected T.B. strangely.</p>

<p>"That girl is acting," he thought. "But why?"</p>

<p>"Three weeks?" mused the banker. "Um&mdash;when did you
discover he was a relative of mine?"</p>

<p>"A few days since," she said eagerly. "I was in Cornwall,
visiting some friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cornwall!" T.B. had hard work to suppress an
exclamation.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and I learnt from them that you were related. I did
not know of any other relation. My friends told me it would be
wicked to marry without the knowledge of his people. 'Go to Sir
George Calliper and explain,' they said; 'he will help you';
instead of which&mdash;"</p>

<p>The banker smiled again.</p>

<p>"Instead of which I pointed out how impossible it was, eh?
and persuaded you to give up all idea of marrying Carleby. Yes,
I suppose you think I am a heartless brute." She sat with bent
head.</p>

<br>

<a id="pic4"></a>

<div align="center">
<img src="1203531h-images/TheNineBears-4.gif"
alt="Illustration"
title="You will give him my message?">
<p class="caption">"You will give him my message?"</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"You will give him my message?" she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"And the flowers?"</p>

<p>"And the flowers," he repeated gravely.</p>

<p>("That clears the banker," thought T.B.)</p>

<p>"I shall leave for Spain to-morrow. It was good of you to let
me have this talk."</p>

<p>"It was good of you to come."</p>

<p>"Somehow," she said drearily, "I cannot help feeling that it
is for the best."</p>

<p>Again T.B. thought he detected a note of insincerity.</p>

<p>"When will you see him?"</p>

<p>"Carleby?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Not to-morrow."</p>

<p>"The next day?"</p>

<p>T.B. was alert now; he saw in a flash the significance of
this interview; saw the plot which had lured a foolish relative
of Calliper's to a love affair; and now, the manoeuvring to the
crucial moment of the interview which she had so cleverly
planned.</p>

<p>"Nor the next day," smiled Sir George.</p>

<p>"Well, the <i>next</i> day?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "That is the day of all days I am not
likely to leave London."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked innocently, her eyes wide open and her lips
parted.</p>

<p>"I have some very important business to transact on that
day," he said briefly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot," she said, with a hint of awe in her voice.
"You're a great banker, aren't you?" she smiled. "Oh, yes,
Carleby told me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought you didn't know about me until your Cornish
friends told you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not that you were related to him," she rejoined quickly,
"but he spoke of the great house of Bronte&mdash;"</p>

<p>("Neat," approved the hidden T.B.)</p>

<p>"So Thursday will be the day," she mused.</p>

<p>"What day?" The banker's voice was sharp.</p>

<p>"The day you will see Carleby," she said, with a look of
surprise.</p>

<p>"I said not Thursday on any account, but possibly the next
day," said Sir George stiffly.</p>

<p>"She has the information she wants," said T.B. to himself,
"and so have I," he reflected; "I will now retire."</p>

<p>He stepped carefully down, reached the floor, and was feeling
his way to the door when a strange noise attracted his
attention. It came, not from the next room, but from that in
which he stood. He stood stock-still, holding his breath, and
the noise he heard was repeated.</p>

<p>Somebody was in the room with him. Somebody was moving
stealthily along the wall at the opposite side of the apartment.
T.B. waited for a moment to locate his man, then leapt
noiselessly in the direction of the sound. His strong hands
grasped a man's shoulder; another instant and his fingers were
at the spy's throat. "Utter a word and I'll knock your head
off!" he hissed. No terrible threat when uttered facetiously,
but T.B.'s words were the reverse of humorous. Retaining a hold
of his prisoner, he waited until the noise of a door closing
told him that the diners in the next room had departed, then he
dragged his man to where he judged the electric-light switch
would be. His fingers found the button, turned it, and the room
was instantly flooded with light. He released the man with a
little push, and stood with his back to the door.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said T.B. virtuously; "will you kindly explain
what you mean by spying on me?"</p>

<p>The man was tall and thin. He was under thirty and decently
dressed; but it was his face that held the detective's
attention. It was the face of a man in mortal terror&mdash;the
eyes staring, the lips tremulous, the cheeks lined and seamed
like an old man's. He stood blinking in the light for a moment,
and when he spoke he was incoherent and hoarse.</p>

<p>"You're T.B. Smith," he croaked. "I know you; I've been
wanting to find you."</p>

<p>"Well, you've found me," said the detective grimly.</p>

<p>"I wasn't looking for you&mdash;now. I'm Hyatt."</p>

<p>He said this simply enough. It was the detective's turn to
stare.</p>

<p>"I'm Hyatt," the man went on; "and I've a communication to
make; King's evidence; but you've got to hide me!" He came
forward and laid his hand on the other's arm. "I'm not going to
be done in like Moss; it's your responsibility, and you'll be
blamed if anything happens to me," he almost whispered in his
fear. "They've had Moss, and they'll try to have me. They've
played me false because they thought I'd get to know the day the
barrage was to be handed over, and spoil their market. They
brought me up to London, because I'd have found out if I'd been
in Cornwall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Steady, steady!" T.B. checked the man. He was talking at
express rate, and between terror and wrath was well-nigh
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>"Now, begin at the beginning. Who are 'they'?"</p>

<p>"N. H. C, I told you," snarled the other impatiently. "I knew
they were going to get the date from the banker. That was the
scheme of Catherine Dominguez. She is one of the agents&mdash;
they've got 'em everywhere. She was introduced to his nephew so
that she might get at the uncle. But I'm giving King's evidence.
I shall get off; shan't I?"</p>

<p>His anxiety was pitiable.</p>

<p>T.B. thought quickly. Here were two ends to the mystery;
which was the more important? He decided. This man would keep;
the urgent business was to prevent Catherine from communicating
her news to her friends.</p>

<p>"Take this card," he said, and scribbled a few words hastily
upon a visiting-card; "&mdash;that will admit you to my rooms at
the Savoy. Make yourself comfortable until I return." He gave
the man a few directions, piloted him from the restaurant, saw
him enter a cab, then turned his steps toward Baker Street.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap16" name="chap16">XVI. &mdash; MARY
BROWN</a></h2>

<p class="first">PENTONBY MANSIONS are within a stone's throw of
Baker Street Station. T.B. jumped out of his cab some distance
from the great entrance hall, and paid the driver. Just before
he turned into the vestibule a man, strolling towards him, asked
him for a match.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"She came straight from the restaurant and has been inside
ten minutes," reported the man, ostentatiously lighting his
pipe.</p>

<p>"She hasn't sent a telegram?"</p>

<p>"So far as I know, no, sir." In the vestibule a hall porter
sat reading the evening paper.</p>

<p>"Can I telephone from here?" asked T.B.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the man, and T.B.'s heart sank, for he had
overlooked this possibility.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have 'phones in every room?" he asked
carelessly.</p>

<p>But the man shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he said; "there is some talk of putting 'em in,
but so far this 'phone in my office is the only one in the
building."</p>

<p>T.B. smiled genially.</p>

<p>"And I suppose," he said, "that you're bothered day and night
with calls from tenants?" He waited anxiously for the
answer.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I am, and sometimes I go a whole day without
calls. No; to-day, for instance, I haven't had a message since
five o'clock."</p>

<p>T.B. murmured polite surprise and began his ascent of the
stairs. So far, so good. His business was to prevent the girl
communicating with Poltavo.</p>

<p>He had already formed a plan in his mind.</p>

<p>Turning at the first landing, he walked briskly along the
corridor to the left.</p>

<p>"29, 31, 33," he counted, "35, 37. Here we are." The corridor
was empty; he slipped his skeleton-key from his pocket and
deftly manipulated it.</p>

<p>The door opened noiselessly. He was in a dark little hallway.
At the end was a door, and a gleam of light shone under it. He
closed the door behind him, stepped softly along the carpeted
floor, and his hand was on the handle of the further door, when
a sweet voice called him by name from the room.</p>

<p>"<i>Adelante</i>! Senor Smit'," it said; and, obeying the
summons, T.B. entered.</p>

<p>The room was well, if floridly, furnished; but T.B. had no
eyes save for the graceful figure lounging in a big wicker-chair,
a thin cigarette between her red lips, and her hands
carelessly folded on her lap.</p>

<p>"Come in," she repeated, this time in French. "I have been
expecting you."</p>

<p>T.B. bowed slightly.</p>

<p>"I was told that I should probably receive a visit from
you."</p>

<p>"First," said T.B. gently, "let me relieve you of that ugly
toy."</p>

<p>Before she could realise what was happening, two strong hands
seized her wrists and lifted them. Then one hand clasped her
two, and a tiny pistol that lay in her lap was in the
detective's possession.</p>

<p>"Let us talk," said T.B. He laid her tiny pistol on the
table, and with his thumb raised the safety-catch.</p>

<p>"You are not afraid of a toy pistol?" she scoffed.</p>

<p>"I am afraid of anything that carries a nickel bullet," he
confessed without shame. "I know by experience that your 'toy'
throws a shot that penetrates an inch of pinewood and comes out
on the other side. I cannot offer the same resistance as
pinewood," he added modestly.</p>

<p>"I have been warned about you," she said, with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>"So you were warned?" T.B. was mildly amused and just a
trifle annoyed. It piqued him to know that, whilst, as he
thought, he had been working in the shadow, he had been under a
searchlight.</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;what do you call it in England?&mdash;smug,"
she said, "but what are you going to do with me?"</p>

<p>She had let fall her cloak and was again leaning back lazily
in the big armchair. The question was put in the most
matter-of-fact tones.</p>

<p>"That you shall see," said T.B. cheerfully. "I am mainly
concerned now in preventing you from communicating with your
friends."</p>

<p>"It will be rather difficult?" she challenged, with a smile.
"I am not proscribed; my character does not admit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As to your character," said T.B. magnanimously, "we will not
go into the question. So far as you are concerned, I shall take
you into custody on a charge of obtaining property by false
pretences," said T.B. calmly.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Your name is Mary Brown, and I shall charge you with having
obtained the sum of &pound;350 by a trick from a West Indian gentleman
at Barbadoes last March."</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet, her eyes blazing.</p>

<p>"You know that is false and ridiculous," she said steadily.
"What is the meaning of it?"</p>

<p>T.B. shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Would you prefer that I should charge 'La Belle Espagnole'
with being an accessory to murder?" he asked, with a lift of his
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"You could not prove it!" she challenged.</p>

<p>"Of that I am aware," he said. "I have taken the trouble to
trace your movements. When these murders were committed you were
fulfilling an engagement at the Philharmonic, but you knew of
the murder, I'll swear&mdash;you are an agent of N.H.C."</p>

<p>"So it was you who found my handkerchief?"</p>

<p>"No; a discerning friend of mine is entitled to the
discovery. Are you ready&mdash;Mary Brown?"</p>

<p>"Wait."</p>

<p>She stood plucking at her dress nervously.</p>

<p>"What good can my arrest do to you?&mdash;to-morrow it will
be known all over the world."</p>

<p>"There," said T.B., "you are mistaken."</p>

<p>"To arrest me is to sign your death-warrant&mdash;you must
know that&mdash;the Nine Men will strike&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>T.B.'s eyes were dancing with excitement.</p>

<p>"Nine men!" he repeated slowly. "<i>Neuf
hommes</i>&mdash;N.H. What does the 'C.' stand for?"</p>

<p>"That much you will doubtless discover," she said coldly,
"but they will strike surely and effectively."</p>

<p>The detective had regained his composure.</p>

<p>"I'm a bit of a striker myself," he said in English.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap17" name="chap17">XVII. &mdash;
DEPORTATION</a></h2>

<p class="first">T.B. FOUND the Chief Commissioner of Police at
his club, and unfolded his plan. The Chief looked grave.</p>

<p>"It might very easily lead to a horrible catastrophe if you
carry that scheme into execution."</p>

<p>"It might very easily lead to a worse if I don't," said T.B.
brutally. "I am too young to die. At the worst it can only be a
'police blunder,' such as you read about in every evening
newspaper that's published," he urged, "and I look at the other
side of the picture. If this woman communicates with her
principals, nothing is more certain than that Thursday will see
the blowing up of the Wady Semlik Barrage. These 'Nine Bears'
are operating on the sure knowledge that Bronte's Bank is going
to break. The stocks they are attacking are companies banking
with Bronte, and it's ten chances to one they will kill Sir
George Calliper in order to give an artistic finish to the
failure."</p>

<p>The Commissioner bit his lip thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"And," urged T.B. Smith, "the N.H.C. will be warned, and bang
goes our only chance of bagging the lot!"</p>

<p>The Commissioner smiled.</p>

<p>"Your language, T.B.!" he deplored; then,</p>

<p>"Do as you wish&mdash;but what about the real Mary
Brown?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she can be sent on next week with apologies. We can get
a new warrant if necessary."</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"At Bow Street."</p>

<p>"No; I mean the Spanish lady?"</p>

<p>T.B. grinned.</p>

<p>"She's locked up in your office, sir," he said
cheerfully.</p>

<p>The Commissioner said nothing, but T.B. declined to meet his
eye.</p>

<p>At four o'clock the next morning, a woman attendant woke "La
Belle Espagnole" from a fitful sleep, and a few minutes
afterwards T.B., dressed for a journey and accompanied by a
hard-faced wardress and a detective, came in.</p>

<p>"Where are you going to take me?" she demanded, but T.B.'s
reply was not very informing.</p>

<p>A closed carriage deposited them at Euston in time to catch
the early morning train. In the compartment reserved for her and
the wardress&mdash;it was a corridor carriage, and T.B. and his
man occupied the next compartment&mdash;she found a dainty
breakfast waiting for her, and a supply of literature. She slept
the greater part of the journey and woke at the jolting of a
shunting engine being attached to the carriage.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We're there," was the cryptic reply of the woman
attendant.</p>

<p>She was soon to discover, for, when the carriage finally came
to a standstill and the door was opened, she stepped down onto a
wind-swept quay. Ahead of her the great white hull of a steamer
rose, and before she could realise the situation she had been
hurried up the sloping gangway onto the deck.</p>

<p>Evidently T.B.'s night had been profitably spent, for he was
expected. The purser met him.</p>

<p>"We got your telegrams," he said. "Is this the lady?"</p>

<p>T.B. nodded. The purser led the way down the spacious
companion.</p>

<p>"I have prepared 'C' suite," he said, and ushered the party
into a beautifully appointed cabin. She noticed that a steel
grating had been newly fixed to the porthole, but that was the
only indication of her captivity.</p>

<p>"I have enlisted the help of the stewardess," said T.B., "and
you will find all the clothing you are likely to require for the
voyage. I am also instructed to hand you &pound;300. You will find
your little library well stocked. I myself have denuded my own
poor stock of French novels in order that you might not be
dull."</p>

<p>"I understand that I am to be deported?" she said.</p>

<p>"That is an excellent understanding," he replied.</p>

<p>"By what authority?" she demanded. "It is necessary to obtain
an order from the Court."</p>

<p>"For the next fourteen days, and until this ship reaches
Jamaica, you will be Mary Brown, who was formally extradited
last Saturday on a charge of fraud," said T.B. "If you are wise
you will give no trouble, and nobody on board need have an
inkling that you are a prisoner. You can enjoy the voyage, and
at the end&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At the end?" she asked, seeing that he paused.</p>

<p>"At the end we shall discover our mistake," said T.B., "and
you may return."</p>

<p>"I will summon the captain and demand to be put ashore!" she
cried.</p>

<p>"A very natural request on the part of a prisoner," said T.B.
meditatively, "but I doubt very much whether it would have any
effect upon an unimaginative seaman."</p>

<p>He left her raging.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day he idled about the ship. The <i>Port
Sybil</i> was due to leave at four o'clock, and when the first
warning bell had sounded he went below to take his leave. He
found her much calmer.</p>

<p>"I would like to ask one question," she said.</p>

<p>"It is not like the police to provide me with money, and to
reserve such a cabin as this for my use&mdash;who is behind
this?"</p>

<p>"I wondered whether you would ask that," said T.B. "Sir
George was very generous&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir George Calliper!" she gasped. "You have not
dared&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it needed some daring," admitted T.B., "to wake an
eminent banker out of his beauty sleep to relate such a story as
I had to tell&mdash;but he was very nice about it."</p>

<p>She brooded for some moments.</p>

<p>"You will be sorry for this," she said. "The Nine Men will
know much sooner than you imagine."</p>

<p>"Before they know this they will know other things," he said.
And with this utterance he left her.</p>

<p>He stood watching the great steamer moving slowly down the
Mersey. He had left the wardress on board to make the voyage,
and the other detective had remained to report.</p>

<p>As the vessel swung round a bend of the Mersey out of sight,
he murmured flippantly:</p>

<p>"Next stop&mdash;Jamaica!"</p>

<p>T.B. reached his chambers at noon that day. He stopped to ask
a question of the porter.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said that worthy, "he arrived all right with your
card last night. I made him comfortable for the night, got him
some supper, and told my mate who is on duty at night to look
after him."</p>

<p>T.B. nodded. Declining the lift-boy's services, he mounted
the marble stairs.</p>

<p>He reached the door of his flat and inserted the key.</p>

<p>"Now for Mr. Hyatt," he thought, and opened the door.</p>

<p>There was a little hallway to his chambers, in which the
electric light still burned, in spite of the flood of sunlight
that came from a long window at the end.</p>

<p>"Extravagant beggar!" muttered T.B.</p>

<p>The dining-room was empty, and the blinds were drawn, and
here, too, the electric light was full on. There was a spare
bedroom to the left, and to this T.B. made his way.</p>

<p>He threw open the door.</p>

<p>"Hyatt!" he called; but there was no answer, and he
entered.</p>

<p>Hyatt lay on the bed, fully dressed. The handle of a knife
protruded from his breast, and T.B., who understood these
things, knew that the man had been dead for many hours.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Consols were up.</p>

<p>There was no doubt whatever about that fact, and the
industrial market was a humming hive of industry.</p>

<p>Breweries, bakeries, and candlestick makeries&mdash;their
shares bounded joyously as though a spirit, as of early spring,
had entered into these inanimate and soulless things.</p>

<p>The mysterious "bears" were buying, buying, buying.
Frantically, recklessly buying.</p>

<p>Whatever coup had been contemplated by the Nine Men had
failed, and their agents and brokers were working at fever heat
to cover their losses. It is significant that on the morning the
boom started, there appeared in all the early editions of the
evening newspapers one little paragraph. It appeared in the
"late news" space and was condensed:</p>

<br>

<p class="newspaper">"Wady Barrage was handed over to Egyptian
Government early this morning in presence of Minister of Works.
Overnight rumours were prevalent that attempt made to destroy
section dam by dynamite and that Italian named Soccori shot dead
by sentry of West Kent Regiment in act of placing explosives on
works. No official confirmation."</p>

<br>

<p>Interesting enough, but hardly to be associated by the crowd
which thronged the approaches of the House with the rising
market.</p>

<p>All day long the excitement in the city continued, all day
long bareheaded clerks ran aimlessly&mdash;to all
appearance&mdash;from 'Change to pavement, pavement to 'Change,
like so many agitated ants. Sir George Calliper, sitting alone
in the magnificence of his private office, watched the "boom"
thoughtfully, and wondered exactly what would have happened if
"an Italian named Soccori" had succeeded in placing his
explosive.</p>

<p>The echoes of the boom came to T.B. Smith in, his little room
overlooking the Thames Embankment, but brought him little
satisfaction. The Nine Men had failed this time. Would they fail
on the next occasion?</p>

<p>Who they were he could guess. From what centre they operated,
he neither knew nor guessed. For T.B. they had taken on a new
aspect. Hitherto they had been regarded merely as a band of
dangerous and clever swindlers, Napoleonic in their method; now,
they were murderers&mdash;dangerous, devilish men without pity
or remorse.</p>

<p>The man Moss by some accident had been associated with
them&mdash;a tool perhaps, but a tool who had surprised their
secret. He was not the type of man who, of his own intelligence,
would have made discoveries. He mentioned Hyatt and "the man on
the Eiffel Tower." That might have been the wanderings of a
dying man, but Hyatt had come to light.</p>

<p>Hyatt, with his curiously intellectual face; here, thought
T.B., was the man, if any, who had unearthed the secret of the
Nine. Likely enough he shared confidence with Moss; indeed,
there was already evidence in T.B.'s hands that the two men had
business dealings. And the third&mdash;"the man on the Eiffel
Tower"? Here T.B. came against a wall of improbability.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap18" name="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; IN THE "JOURNAL"
OFFICE</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE room was a long one, full of dazzling
islands of light where shaded lamps above the isolated sub-editors'
desks threw their white circles. This room, too, was
smirched with black shadows; there were odd corners where light
never came. It never shone upon the big bookcase over the
mantelpiece, or in the corner behind the man who conned the
foreign exchanges, or on the nest of pigeonholes over against
the chief "sub."</p>

<p>When he would refer to these he must needs emerge blinking
from the blinding light in which he worked and go groping in the
darkness for the needed memorandum.</p>

<p>He was sitting at his desk now, intent upon his work.</p>

<p>At his elbow stood a pad, on which he wrote from time to
time.</p>

<p>Seemingly his task was an aimless one. He wrote nothing save
the neat jottings upon his pad. Bundles of manuscript came to
him, blue books, cuttings from other newspapers; these he looked
at rather than read, looked at them in a hard, strained fashion,
put them in this basket or that, as the fancy seized him, chose
another bundle, stared at it, fluttered the leaves rapidly, and
so continued. He had the appearance of a man solving some
puzzle, piecing together intricate parts to make one
comprehensive whole. When he hesitated, as he sometimes did, and
seemed momentarily doubtful as to which basket a manuscript
should be consigned, you felt the suggestion of mystery with
which his movements were enveloped, and held your breath. When
he had decided upon the basket you hoped for the best, but
wondered vaguely what would have happened if he had chosen the
other.</p>

<p>The door that opened into the tape-room was swinging
constantly now, for it wanted twenty minutes to eleven. Five
tickers chattered incessantly, and there was a constant
procession of agency boys and telegraph messengers passing in
and out the vestibule of the silent building. And the pneumatic
tubes that ran from the front hall to the subs' room hissed and
exploded periodically, and little leathern carriers rattled into
the wire basket at the chief sub's elbow.</p>

<p>News! news! news!</p>

<p>A timber fire at Rotherhithe; the sudden rise in Consols; the
Sultan of Turkey grants an amnesty to political offenders; a man
kills his wife at Wolverhampton; a woman cyclist run down by a
motor-car; the Bishop of Elford denounces
Nonconformists&mdash;</p>

<p>News for to-morrow's breakfast table! Intellectual stimulant
for the weary people who are even now kicking off their shoes
with a sleepy yawn and wondering whether there will be anything
in the paper to-morrow.</p>

<p>A boy came flying through the swing door of the tape-room,
carrying in his hand a slip of paper. He laid it before the
chief sub.</p>

<p>That restless man looked at it, then looked at the clock.</p>

<p>"Take it to Mr. Greene," he said shortly, and reached for the
speaking-tube that connected him with the printer.</p>

<p>"There will be a three-column splash on page five," he said
in a matter-of-fact voice.</p>

<p>"What's up?" His startled assistant was on his feet.</p>

<p>"A man found murdered in T.B. Smith's chambers," he said.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE inquest was over, the stuffy little court
discharged its morbid public, jurymen gathered in little knots
on the pavement permitted themselves to theorise, feeling,
perhaps, that the official verdict of "murder against some
person or persons unknown" needed amplification.</p>

<p>"My own opinion is," said the stout foreman, "that nobody
could have done it, except somebody who could have got into his
chambers unknown."</p>

<p>"That's my opinion, too," said another jury-man.</p>

<p>"I should have liked to add a rider," the foreman went on,
something like this: 'We call the coroner's attention to the
number of undiscovered murders nowadays, and severely censure
the police,' but he wouldn't have it."</p>

<p>"They 'ang together," said a gloomy little man;
"&mdash;p'lice and coroners and doctors, they 'ang together,
there's corruption somewhere. I've always said it."</p>

<p>"Here's a feller murdered," the foreman went on, "in a
detective's room, the same detective that's in charge of the
Moss murder. We're told his name's Hyatt, we're told he was sent
to that room by the detective whilst he's engaged in some
fanciful business in the north&mdash;is that sense?"</p>

<p>"Then there's the <i>Journal</i>," interrupted the man of
gloom, "it comes out this mornin' with a cock-an'-bull story
about these two murders being connected with the
slump&mdash;why, there ain't any slump! The market went up the
very day this chap Hyatt was discovered."</p>

<p>"Sensation," said the foreman, waving deprecating hands,
"newspaper sensation. Any lie to sell the newspapers, that's
their motto."</p>

<p>The conversation ended abruptly, as T.B. Smith appeared at
the entrance of the court. His face was impassive, his attire,
as usual, immaculate, but those who knew him best detected signs
of worry.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake," he said to a young man who approached
him, "don't talk to me now&mdash;you beggar, your wretched rag
has upset all my plans."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Smith," pleaded the reporter.</p>

<p>"What we said was true, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"'A lie that is half the truth,'" quoted T.B. solemnly.</p>

<p>"But it is true&mdash;there is some connection between the
murders and the slump, and, I say, do your people know anything
about the mysterious disappearance of that dancing girl from the
Philharmonic?"</p>

<p>"Oh, child of sin!" T.B. shook his head reprovingly. "Oh,
collector of romance!"</p>

<p>"One last question," said the reporter. "Do you know a man
named Escoltier?"</p>

<p>"Not," said T.B. flippantly, "from a crow&mdash;why? is he
suspected of abducting your dancing lady?"</p>

<p>"No," said the reporter, "he's suspected of pulling our
editor's leg."</p>

<p>T.B. was all this time walking away from the court, and the
reporter kept step with him.</p>

<p>"And what is the nature of his hoax?" demanded T.B.</p>

<p>He was not anxious for information, but he was very desirous
of talking about nothing&mdash;it had been a trying day for
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, the usual thing; wants to tell us the greatest crime
that ever happened&mdash;a great London crime that the police
have not discovered."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said T.B. politely, "wants payment in
advance?"</p>

<p>"No; that's the curious thing about it," said the reporter.
"All he wants is protection." T.B. stopped dead and faced the
young man. He dropped the air of boredom right away.</p>

<p>"Protection?" he said quickly, "from whom?"</p>

<p>"That is just what he doesn't say&mdash;in fact, he's rather
vague on that point&mdash;why don't you go up and see Delawn,
the editor?"</p>

<p>T.B. thought a moment.</p>

<p>"Yes," he nodded. "That is an idea. I will go at once."</p>

<p>In the holy of holies, the inner room within the inner room,
wherein the editor of the <i>London Morning Journal</i> saw
those visitors who were privileged to pass the outer portal,
T.B. Smith sat, a sorely puzzled man, a scrap of disfigured
paper in his hands.</p>

<p>He read it again and looked up at the editor.</p>

<p>"This might of course be a fake," he said.</p>

<p>"It doesn't read like a fake," said the other.</p>

<p>"Admitting your authority on the subject of fakes, Tom," said
T.B.,&mdash;they were members of the same club, which fact in
itself is a license for rudeness,&mdash;" I am still in the
dark. Why does this &mdash;what is his name?"</p>

<p>"Escoltier."</p>

<p>"Why does this man Escoltier write to a newspaper, instead of
coming straight to the police?"</p>

<p>"Because he is a Frenchman, I should imagine," said the
editor. "The French have the newspaper instinct more highly
developed than the English."</p>

<p>T.B. looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Will he come, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I have wired to him," said the editor. T.B. read the paper
again. It was written in execrable English, but its purport was
clear. The writer could solve the mystery of Hyatt's death, and
for the matter of that of the Moss murder.</p>

<p>T.B. read it and shook his head.</p>

<p>"This sort of thing is fairly common," he said; "there never
was a bad murder yet, but what the Yard received solutions by
the score."</p>

<p>A little bell tinkled on the editor's desk, and he took up
the receiver of the telephone.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said, and listened. Then, "Send him up."</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Escoltier," said the editor. A few seconds later
the door was opened, and a man was ushered into the room. Short
and thick-set, with a two days' growth of beard on his chin, his
nationality was apparent long before he spoke in the
<i>argot</i> of the lowly born Parisian. His face was haggard,
his eyes heavy from lack of sleep, and the hand that strayed to
his mouth shook tremulously.</p>

<p>"I have to tell you," he began, "about M'sieur Moss and
M'sieur Hyatt." His voice was thick, and as he spoke he glanced
from side to side as though fearful of observation. There was
something in his actions that vividly reminded the detective of
his interview with Hyatt. "You understand," the man went on
incoherently, "that I had long suspected N.H.C.&mdash;it was
always so unintelligible. There was no such station
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must calm yourself, monsieur," said T.B., speaking in
French; "&mdash;begin at the beginning, for as yet my friend and
myself are entirely in the dark. What is N.H.C., and what does
it mean?"</p>

<p>It was some time before the man could be brought to a
condition of coherence. The editor pushed him gently to the
settee that ran the length of the bay window of his office.</p>

<p>"Wait," said the journalist, and unlocking a drawer, he
produced a silver flask.</p>

<p>"Drink some of this," he said.</p>

<p>The man raised the brandy to his lips with a hand that shook
violently, and drank eagerly.</p>

<p>"<i>C'est bien</i>," he muttered, and looked from one to the
other.</p>

<p>"I tell you this story because I am afraid to go to the
police&mdash;they are watching the police office&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the first place, who are you?" demanded T.B.</p>

<p>"As to who and what I am," said the stranger, nodding his
head to emphasise his words, "it would be better that I should
remain silent."</p>

<p>"I do not see the necessity," said the detective calmly. "So
far as I can judge from what information I have, you are a
French soldier&mdash;an engineer. You are a wireless telegraph
operator, and your post of duty is on the Eiffel Tower."</p>

<p>The man stared at the speaker, and his jaw dropped.</p>

<p>"M'sieur!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Hyatt was also a wireless operator; probably in the employ
of the Marconi Company in the west of England. Between you, you
surprised the secret of a mysterious agency which employs
wireless installations to communicate with its agents. What
benefits you yourself may have derived from your discovery I
cannot say. It is certain that Hyatt, operating through Moss,
made a small fortune; it is equally certain that, detecting a
leakage, the 'Nine Men' have sent a clever agent to discover the
cause&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the man from the Eiffel Tower had fainted.</p>

<p>"I shall rely on you to keep the matter an absolute secret
until we are ready," said T.B., and the editor nodded. "The
whole scheme came to me in a flash. The Eiffel Tower! Who lives
on the Eiffel Tower? Wireless telegraph operators. Our friend is
recovering."</p>

<p>He looked down at the pallid man lying limply in an
armchair.</p>

<p>"I am anxious to know what brings him to London. Fright, I
suppose. It was the death of Moss that brought Hyatt, the
killing of Hyatt that produced Monsieur Escoltier."</p>

<p>The telegraphist recovered consciousness with a shiver and a
groan. For a quarter of an hour he sat with his face hidden in
his hands. Another pull at the editor's flask aroused him to
tell his story&mdash;a narrative which is valuable as being the
first piece of definite evidence laid against the Nine
Bears.</p>

<p>He began hesitatingly, but as the story of his complicity was
unfolded he warmed to his task. With the true Gaul's love for
the dramatic, he declaimed with elaborate gesture and sonorous
phrase the part he had played.</p>

<p>"My name is Jules Escoltier, I am a telegraphist in the corps
of engineers. On the establishment of the wireless telegraphy
station on the Eiffel Tower in connection with the Casa Blanca
affair, I was appointed one of the operators. Strange as it may
sound, one does not frequently intercept messages, but I was
surprised a year ago to find myself taking code despatches from
a station which called itself 'N.H.C.' There is no such station
known, so far as I am aware, and copies of the despatches which
I forwarded to my superiors were always returned to me as
'non-decodable.'</p>

<p>"One day I received a message in English, which I can read.
It ran&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="note">"'All those who know N.H.C. call H.A.'</p>

<br>

<p>"Although I did not know who N.H.C. was, I had the curiosity
to look up H. A. on the telegraph map, and found it was the
Cornish Marconi Station. Taking advantage of the absence of my
officer, I sent a wireless message, 'I desire information, L.L.'
That is not the Paris 'indicator,' but I knew that I should get
the reply. I had hardly sent the message when another message
came. It was from Monsieur Hyatt. I got the message
distinctly&mdash;'Can you meet me in London on the 9th,
Gallini's Restaurant?' To this I replied, 'No, impossible.'
After this I had a long talk with the Cornishman, and then it
was that he told me that his name was Hyatt. He told me that he
was able to decode the N.H.C. messages, that he had a book, and
that it was possible to make huge sums of money from the
information contained in them. I thought that it was very
indiscreet to speak so openly, and told him so.</p>

<p>"He asked me for my name, and I gave it, and thereafter I
regularly received letters from him, and a correspondence
began.</p>

<p>"Not being <i>au fait</i> in matters affecting the Bourse, I
did not know of what value the information we secured from
N.H.C. could be, but Hyatt said he had a friend who was
interested in such matters, and that if I 'took off' all N.H.C.
messages that I got, and repeated them to him, I should share in
the proceeds. I was of great value to Hyatt, because I received
messages that never reached him in this way. He was able to keep
in touch with all the operations on which N.H.C. were
engaged.</p>

<p>"By arrangement, we met in Paris&mdash;Hyatt, his friend of
the London Bourse, Monsieur Moss, and myself, and Hyatt handed
to me notes for 20,000 francs (&pound;800); that was the first
payment I received from him. He returned to England, and things
continued in very much the same way as they had done, I
receiving and forwarding N.H.C. messages. I never understood any
of them, but Hyatt was clever, and he had discovered the code
and worked it out.</p>

<p>"About a fortnight ago I received from him 3,000 francs in
notes, a letter that spoke of a great coup contemplated by
N.H.C. 'If this materialises,' he wrote, 'I hope to send you
half a million francs by the end of next week.'</p>

<p>"The next morning I received this message&mdash;"</p>

<p>He fumbled in his pocket and produced a strip of paper, on
which was hastily scrawled&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">From N.H.C. to L.L. Meet me in London on the
sixth, Charing Cross Station.</p>

<br>

<p>"It was, as you see, in French, and as it came I scribbled it
down. I would have ignored it, but that night I got a message
from Hyatt saying that N.H.C. had discovered we shared their
secret and had offered to pay us &pound;5,000 each to preserve
silence, and that as they would probably alter the code I should
be a fool not to accept. So I got leave of absence and bought a
suit of clothing, left Paris, and arrived in London the
following night. A dark young man met me at the station, and
invited me to come home with him.</p>

<p>"He had a motor-car at the entrance of the station, and after
some hesitation I accepted. We drove through the streets filled
with people, for the theatres were just emptying, and after an
interminable ride we reached the open country. I asked him where
was Hyatt, and where we were going, but he refused to speak.
When I pressed him, he informed me he was taking me to a
rendezvous near the sea.</p>

<p>"We had been driving for close on three hours, when we
reached a lonely lane. By the lights of the car I could see a
steep hill before us, and I could hear the roar of the waves
somewhere ahead.</p>

<p>"Suddenly he threw a lever over, the car bounded forward, and
he sprang to the ground.</p>

<p>"Before I could realise what had happened, the machine was
flying down the steep gradient, rocking from side to side.</p>

<p>"I have sufficient knowledge of motor-car engineering to
manipulate a car, and I at once sprang to the wheel and felt for
the brake. But both foot and hand brake were useless. In some
manner he had contrived to disconnect them.</p>

<p>"It was pitch-dark, and all that I could hope to do was to
keep the car to the centre of the road. Instinctively I knew
that I was rushing to certain death, and, messieurs, I was! I
was flying down a steep gradient to inevitable destruction, for
at the bottom of the hill the road turned sharply, and
confronting me, although I did not know this, was a stone sea
wall.</p>

<p>"I resolved on taking my life in my hands, and putting the
car at one of the steep banks which ran on either side, I turned
the steering wheel and shut my eyes. I expected instant death.
Instead, the car bounded up at an angle that almost threw me
from my seat. I heard the crash of wood, and flying splinters
struck my neck, and the next thing I remember was a series of
bumps as the car jolted over a ploughed field.</p>

<p>"I had achieved the impossible. At the point I had chosen to
leave the road was a gate leading to a field, and by an act of
Providence I had found the only way of escape.</p>

<p>"I found myself practically at the very edge of the sea, and
in my first terror I would have given every sou I had to escape
to France. All night long I waited by the broken car, and with
the dawn some peasants came and told me I was only five miles
distant from Dover. I embraced the man who told me this, and
would have hired a conveyance to drive me to Dover, <i>en
route</i> for France. I knew that N.H.C. could trace me, and
then I was anxious to get in touch with Hyatt and Moss. Then it
was that I saw in an English newspaper that Moss was dead."</p>

<p>He stopped and moistened his lips.</p>

<p>"M'sieur!" he went on with a characteristic gesture, "I
decided that I would come to London and find Hyatt. I took
train, but I was watched. At a little junction called Sandgate,
a man sauntered past my carriage. I did not know him, he looked
like an Italian. As the train left the station something smashed
the window and I heard a thud. There was no report, but I knew
that I had been fired at with an air-gun, for the bullet I found
embedded in the woodwork of the carriage."</p>

<p>"Did nothing further happen?" asked T.B.</p>

<p>"Nothing till I reached Charing Cross, then when I stopped to
ask a policeman to direct me to the Central Police Bureau I saw
a man pass me in a motor-car, eyeing me closely. It was the man
who had tried to kill me."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then I saw my danger. I was afraid of the police. I saw a
newspaper sheet. It was a great newspaper&mdash;I wrote a
letter&mdash;and sought lodgings in a little hotel near the
river. There was no answer to my letter. I waited in hiding for
two days before I realised that I had given no address. I wrote
again. All this time I have been seeking Hyatt. I have
telegraphed to Cornwall, but the reply comes that he is not
there. Then in the newspaper I learn of his death. M'sieur, I am
afraid."</p>

<p>He wiped the drops of sweat from his forehead with a shaky
hand.</p>

<p>He was indeed in a pitiable condition of fright, and T.B.,
upon whose nerves the mysterious "bears" were already beginning
to work, appreciated his fear without sharing it. There came a
knock at the outer door of the office, and the editor moved to
answer it. There was a whispered conversation at the door, the
door closed again, and the editor returned with raised
brows.</p>

<p>"T.B.," he said, "that wretched market has gone again."</p>

<p>"Gone?"</p>

<p>"Gone to blazes! Spanish Fours are so low that you'd get pain
in your back if you stooped to pick them up."</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"I'll use your telephone," he said, and stooped over the
desk. He called for a number, and after an interval&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that you, Maitland? Go to 375 St. John Street, and
take into custody Count Ivan Poltavo on a charge of murder. Take
with you fifty men and surround the place. Detain every caller,
and every person you find in the house."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver. "It is a bluff, as my gay American
friend says," he remarked to the editor, "because, of course, I
have no real evidence against him. But I want a chance to
ransack that studio of his, anyway.</p>

<p>"Now, my friend," he said in French, "what shall we do with
you?"</p>

<p>The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders listlessly.</p>

<p>"What does it matter?" he said. "They will have me&mdash;it
is only a matter of hours."</p>

<p>"I take a brighter view," said T.B. cheerily; "you shall walk
with us to Scotland Yard and there you shall be taken care
of."</p>

<p>But the Frenchman shrank back.</p>

<p>"Come, there is no danger," smiled T.B.</p>

<p>Reluctantly the engineer accompanied the detective and the
editor from the building. A yellow fog lay like a damp cloth
over London, and the Thames Embankment was almost deserted.</p>

<p>"Do you think he followed you here?" asked T.B.</p>

<p>"I am sure." The Frenchman looked from left to right in an
agony of apprehension. "He killed Hyatt and he killed
Moss&mdash;of that I am certain&mdash;and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>A motor-car loomed suddenly through the fog, coming from the
direction of Northumberland Avenue, and overtook them. A man
leant out of the window as the car swept abreast. His face was
masked and his actions were deliberate.</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried the editor and clutched the Frenchman's
arm.</p>

<p>The pistol that was levelled from the window of the car
cracked twice and T.B. felt the wind of the bullets as they
passed his head.</p>

<p>Then the car disappeared into the mist, leaving behind three
men, one half fainting with terror, one immensely pleased with
the novel sensation&mdash;our editor, you may be sure&mdash;and
one using language unbecoming to an Assistant-Commissioner of
Police.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap19" name="chap19">XIX. &mdash; THE BOOK</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE house in St. John Street had been raided.
In a little room on the top floor there was evidence that an
instrument of some considerable size had been hastily
dismantled. Broken ends of wire were hanging from the wall, and
one other room on the same floor was packed with storage
batteries. Pursuing their investigations, the detectives
ascended to the roof through a trap door. Here was the flagstaff
and the arrangement for hoisting the wires. Apparently, night
was usually chosen for the reception and despatch of messages.
By night, the taut strands of wire would not attract attention.
Only in cases of extremest urgency were they employed in
daylight.</p>

<p>Count Poltavo was gone&mdash;vanished, in spite of the fact
that every railway terminus in London had been watched, every
ocean-going passenger scrutinised.</p>

<p>Van Ingen had been given two days to get the "book"; this
code which the unfortunate Hyatt had deciphered to his undoing.
Moss had said Hyatt's sister had it, but the country had been
searched from end to end for Hyatt's sister. It had not been
difficult to trace her. Van Ingen, after half-an-hour's search
in Falmouth, had discovered her abode, but the girl was not
there.</p>

<p>"She left for London yesterday," he was informed.</p>

<p>From that moment Miss Hyatt had disappeared. A telegram had
reached her on the very day of Hyatt's death. It said
"Come."</p>

<p>There was no name, no address. The telegram had been handed
in at St. Martin's-le-Grand; unearthed, it was found to be in
typewritten characters, and the address at its back a fictitious
one. One other item of news Van Ingen secured; there had been a
lady on the same errand as himself.</p>

<p>"A foreign lady," said the good folks of Falmouth.</p>

<p>He had some two days to discover Eva Hyatt&mdash;this was her
name.</p>

<p>He paced the room, his head sunk on his breast. Where was the
girl?</p>

<p>The telegram said "Come." It suggested some prearranged plan
in which the girl had acquiesced; she was to leave Falmouth and
go somewhere. Suppose she had come to London, where would
Catherine Dominguez have placed her? Near at hand; a thought
struck Van Ingen. Smith had told him the tale of the deportation
of the dancing girl. He would search her flat. He took down his
overcoat and struggled into it, made a selection of keys from
his pocket, and went out. It was a forlorn hope, but forlorn
hopes had often been the fore-runners of victory, and there was
nothing to be lost by trying.</p>

<p>He came to the great hall of the mansion in Baker Street and
asked the number of the dancer's flat.</p>

<p>The hall porter touched his cap.</p>

<p>"Evening, sir." Then, "I suppose you know the young lady
hasn't come back yet?"</p>

<p>Van Ingen did know, but said nothing. The porter was in a
talkative mood.</p>

<p>"She sent me a wire from Liverpool, saying that she'd been
called away suddenly."</p>

<p>The young man nodded. He knew this, too, for T.B. had sent
the wire.</p>

<p>"What the other young lady couldn't understand," continued
the porter, and Van Ingen's heart gave a leap, "was,
why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why she hadn't wired her, eh?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, she was so busy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course!" The porter clucked his lips impatiently.</p>

<p>"She's upstairs in Miss Dominguez' flat at this moment. My
word, she's been horribly worried&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll go up and see her. As a matter of fact, I've come here
for the purpose," said Van Ingen quickly. He took the lift to
the second floor, and walked along the corridor. He reached No.
43 and his hand was raised to press the little electric bell of
the suite when the door opened quickly and a girl stepped out.
She gave a startled cry as she saw the stranger, and drew
back.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Van Ingen, with a pleasant smile.
"I'm afraid I startled you." She was a big florid girl with a
certain awkwardness of movement.</p>

<p>"Well-dressed but <i>gauche</i>," thought Van Ingen.
"Provincial! she'll talk."</p>

<p>"I was a little startled," she said, with a ready smile. "I
thought it was the postman."</p>

<p>"But surely postmen do not deliver letters in this palatial
dwelling," he laughed. "I thought the hall porter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but this is a registered letter," she said importantly,
"from America." All the time Van Ingen was thinking out some
method by which he might introduce the object of his visit. An
idea struck him.</p>

<p>"Is your mother&mdash;" she looked blank, "er&mdash;aunt
within?" he asked. He saw the slow suspicion gathering on her
face.</p>

<p>"I'm not a burglar," he smiled, "in spite of my alarming
question, but I'm in rather a quandary. I've a
friend&mdash;well, not exactly a friend&mdash;but I have
business with Miss Dominguez, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here's the postman," she interrupted. A quick step sounded
in the passage, and the bearer of the king's mails, with a flat
parcel in his hand and his eyes searching the door numbers,
stopped before them.</p>

<p>"Hyatt?" he asked, glancing at the address.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl; "is that my parcel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss; will you sign?"</p>

<p>"Hyatt?" murmured Van Ingen; "what an extraordinary
coincidence. You are not by any chance related to the
unfortunate young man the story of whose sad death has been
filling the newspapers?"</p>

<p>She flushed and her lip trembled.</p>

<p>"He was my brother; did you know him?"</p>

<p>"I knew of him," said Van Ingen quietly, "but I did not know
you lived in London!"</p>

<p>"Nor do I," said the girl; "it is only by the great kindness
of Miss Dominguez that I am here."</p>

<p>There was no time for delicate finesse.</p>

<p>"Will you let me come in and talk with you?" Van Ingen said;
then, as he saw again the evidence of her suspicion, "What I
have to ask you is of the greatest importance to you and to
me."</p>

<p>She hesitated, then led the way into a handsomely furnished
sitting-room.</p>

<p>"First of all," said Van Ingen quietly, "you must tell me how
Miss Dominguez found you."</p>

<p>"She came to Falmouth and sought me out. It was not
difficult. I have a little millinery establishment there, and my
name is well known. She came one morning, eight
days&mdash;no&mdash;yes, it was seven days ago, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did she want?"</p>

<p>"She said she had known Charles; he had some awfully swagger
friends; that is what got him into trouble at the post-office;
it was a great blow to us, because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did she want?" asked Van Ingen, cutting short the
loquacity.</p>

<p>"She said that Charles had something of hers &mdash;a book
which she had lent him, years before. Now, the strange thing was
that on the very day poor Charles was killed I had a telegram
which ran: 'If anything happens, tell Escoltier book is at
Antaxia, New York.' It was unsigned, and I did not connect it
with Charles. You see, I hadn't heard from him for years.</p>

<p>"She was a great friend of Charles'&mdash;the Spanish
lady&mdash;and she came down especially about the book. She said
Charles had got into trouble and she wanted the book to save
him. Then I showed her the telegram. I was confused, but I
wanted to help Charles." She gulped down a sob. "I asked her who
Escoltier was."</p>

<p>"Yes?" asked Van Ingen quickly.</p>

<p>"She said he was a friend of hers who was interested in the
book. She went away, but came back soon afterwards and told me
that 'Antaxia' was the telegraphic address of a safe deposit in
New York. She was very nice and offered to pay for a cable to
the deposit. So I wired: 'Please forward by registered post the
book deposited by Charles Hyatt'; and I signed it 'Eva Hyatt'
and gave my address. By the evening the reply came: 'Forwarded;
your previous wire did not comply with our
instructions.'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see," said Van Ingen.</p>

<p>"Well, that is more than I can," said the girl, with a smile,
"because only one wire was sent. Miss Dominguez was surprised,
too, and a little annoyed, and said: 'How foolish it was of me
not to ask you your Christian name.' Well, then she insisted
upon my coming to stay with her till the book came. I came
expecting I should find Charles, but&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her eyes were filled with tears.</p>

<p>"I read in a newspaper that he was dead. It was the first
thing I saw in London, the bill of a newspaper&mdash;"</p>

<p>Van Ingen gave her time to recover her voice.</p>

<p>"And Miss Dominguez?"</p>

<p>"She took this furnished flat near to hers," said the girl;
"she lives here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Does she?" asked Van Ingen artlessly. He took up the
registered parcel which she had put on the table.</p>

<p>It was fairly light.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Hyatt," he said, very gently. "I want you to do
something for me; and I must tell you that, although I ask it as
a favour, I can enforce my wishes as a right."</p>

<p>"I will do anything," said the girl eagerly.</p>

<p>"Very well; you must let me take this book away."</p>

<p>"But it is not mine; it belongs to Miss Dominguez," she
protested; "and it is to save my brother's name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Hyatt," said Van Ingen, "I must take this book which
has so providentially come into my hands, not to save your
brother's name, but to bring to justice the men who took his
life." As he spoke there came a knock at the door; and, hastily
drying her eyes, the girl opened it.</p>

<p>A porter handed her a telegram, and she came back into the
light of the room to open it. She read it, and reread it; then
looked at Van Ingen with bewilderment written on her face.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" she said. He took the telegram from
her hand; it had been readressed from Falmouth and ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">BY WIRELESS FROM PORT SYBIL. DO NOT PART
WITH BOOK TO ANYBODY ON ANY ACCOUNT. CATHERINE DOMINGUEZ.</p>

<br>

<p>He handed the telegram back.</p>

<p>"It means," he said, "that our friend is just two minutes too
late."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap20" name="chap20">XX. &mdash; AT THE
ADMIRALTY</a></h2>

<p class="first">"THIS business is a little too hot to hold,"
said the editor in a final interview with T.B., who had
persuaded him to keep back his story, until he had bagged the
"Nine Men." "To-night I must tell the whole of the affair."</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"To-night," said T.B., "you can tell what you like. I shall
have played my stake for good or ill.</p>

<p>"I have been talking with Escoltier; we have got him lodged
in Scotland Yard&mdash;though you needn't mention that fact in
your account&mdash;and I think we know enough now to trap the
'Nine Men.'"</p>

<p>"Who are they and what does the 'C.' stand for in
'N.H.C.'?"</p>

<p>"I can only guess," said T.B. cautiously. "Do you know
anything about wireless telegraphy?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Not much," admitted the editor.</p>

<p>"Well, you know enough to realise that the further you wish
to communicate the more electrical energy you require?"</p>

<p>"That much I understand," said the journalist.</p>

<p>"The principle is the 'rings on the pond.' You throw a stone
into still water, and immediately rings grow outward. The bigger
the stone, the farther-reaching the rings."</p>

<p>"At Poldhu," continued T.B., "Hyatt was in charge of the
long-distance instrument. As a matter of fact, the work he was
engaged on was merely experimental, but his endeavour seemed to
be centred in securing the necessary energy for communicating
900 miles. Of course, wireless telegraphy is practicable up to
and beyond 3,000 miles, but few installations are capable of
transmitting that distance."</p>

<p>"So 'C.' is, you think, within 900 miles of Cornwall?"</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"I have a feeling that I know 'C.,'" he said. "I have another
feeling that these wireless messages do not come from 'C.' at
all, but from a place adjacent. However,"&mdash;he took from his
pocket a flat exercise book filled with closely written columns
of words and figures&mdash;"we shall see."</p>

<p>He took a cab from Fleet Street; and, arriving at the block
of Government buildings which shelters the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, he entered its gloomy doors.</p>

<p>A messenger came forward to enquire his business, but was
forestalled by a keen little man with tanned face and twinkling
eyes. "Sailor" was written on every line of his mahogany
face.</p>

<p>"Hullo, my noble policeman," he greeted T.B. Who is the
victim&mdash;the First Sea Lord or the Controller of the
Victualling Department?"</p>

<p>"To be precise, Almack," said T.B., "I have come to arrest
Reform, which I gather&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No politics," smiled Captain John Almack, R.N. "What is the
game?"</p>

<p>"It is what our mutual friend Napoleon would call a negative
problem in strategy," the Assistant-Commissioner replied. "I
want to ask an ethereal friend, who exists somewhere in space,
to come in and be killed."</p>

<p>Captain Almack led the way up a flight of stairs.</p>

<p>"We got a request from your Commissioner; and, of course, the
Lords of the Admiralty are only too pleased to put the
instrument at your disposal."</p>

<p>"They are very charming," murmured T.B.</p>

<p>"They instructed me to keep a watchful eye on you. We have
missed things since your last visit."</p>

<p>"That sounds like a jovial lie," said T.B. frankly.</p>

<p>In the orderly instrument room they found an operator in
attendance, and T.B. lost no time.</p>

<p>"Call N.H.C.," he said; and, whilst the instrument clicked
and snapped obedient to the man's hand, T.B. opened his little
exercise book and composed a message. He had finished his work
long before any answer came to the call. For half-an-hour they
waited whilst the instrument clicked monotonously. "Dash-dot,
dot-dot-dot, dash-dot-dash-dot."</p>

<p>And over and over again.</p>

<p>"Dash-dot, dot-dot-dot, dash-dot-dash-dot." Then suddenly the
operator stopped, and there came a new sound.</p>

<p>They waited in tense silence.</p>

<p>"Answered," said the operator.</p>

<p>"Take this." T.B. handed him a slip of paper.</p>

<p>As the man sent the message out with emphatic tappings,
Captain Almack took the translation that T.B. handed to him.</p>

<br>

<p class="note">"To N.H.C. There is trouble here. I must see
you. Important. Can you meet me in Paris to-morrow?"</p>

<br>

<p>After this message had gone through there was a wait of five
minutes. Then the answer came, and the man at the instrument
wrote down unintelligible words which T.B. translated.</p>

<br>

<p class="note">"Impossible. Come to M. Will meet S.E. Have you
got the book?"</p>

<br>

<p>"Reply 'Podaba'" instructed T.B., spelling the word. "Now
send this." He handed another slip of paper across the table,
and passed the translation back to the man behind him.</p>

<br>

<p class="note">"Is Gibraltar intercepting messages?" it ran.
Again the wait, and again the staccato reply.</p>

<br>

<p class="note">"Unlikely, but will send round to-morrow to make
sure. Good-night."</p>

<p><br>
As the instrument clicked its farewell, T.B. executed a
silent war-dance to the scandal of the solemn operator, and the
delight of the little captain.</p>

<p>"T.B., you'll get me hung!" he warned.</p>

<p>"You'll upset all kinds of delicate instruments, to say
nothing of the telegraphist's sense of decency. Come away."</p>

<p>"Now," demanded Captain Almack, when he had led him to his
snug little office; "what is the mystery?"</p>

<p>T.B. related as much of the story as was necessary, and the
officer whistled.</p>

<p>"The devils!" he swore.</p>

<p>"The discovery I was trying to make," T.B. went on, "was the
exact location of N.H.C. I asked him or them to come to Paris.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to know if they were within
twenty-four hours' distance of Paris. 'Impossible,' they reply.
But they will come to Madrid, and offer to meet the Sud Express.
So they must be in Spain and south of Madrid, otherwise there
would be no impossibility about meeting me in Paris to-morrow.
Where are they? Within reach of Gibraltar apparently, because
they talk of sending round to-morrow. Now, that phrase 'sending
round' is significant, for it proves beyond the shadow of a
doubt exactly in what part of Andalusia they live."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"When people who live within reach of the fortress talk of
going to Gibraltar, as you know they either say that they are
'going across to Gibraltar' or that they are 'going round.' By
the first, they indicate the route <i>via</i> Algeciras and
across the bay; by the latter, they refer to the journey by way
of Cadiz and Tangier&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cadiz!"</p>

<p>The exclamation came from his hearer.</p>

<p>"Cadiz," repeated T.B. He bent his head forward and rested it
for a moment in his hands. When he lifted it, his face was
grave.</p>

<p>"It's worth trying," he muttered. "And," he continued aloud,
"it will be bringing down two birds with one stone."</p>

<p>"Can I use the instrument again?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the officer readily.</p>

<p>T.B. rose.</p>

<p>"I'm going to Scotland Yard, and I shall not be away for more
than ten minutes," he said; and in a few seconds he was crossing
Whitehall at a run. He passed through the entrance and made
straight for the big bureau, where day in and day out the silent
recorder sat with his pen, his cabinets, and his everlasting
<i>dossier</i>.</p>

<p>T.B. knew he would be there, because there was a heavy
calendar at the Old Bailey, and the silent man was working far
into the night&mdash;arranging, sorting, and rearranging.</p>

<p>The detective was back at the Admiralty within the ten
minutes, and together the two made their way to the instrument
room.</p>

<p>"N.H.C." responded almost at once, and T.B. sent his
message.</p>

<br>

<p class="note">"Tell George T. Baggin that another warrant has
been issued for his arrest."</p>

<br>

<p>The reply came immediately.</p>

<br>

<p class="note">"Thanks. Get further particulars, but do not use
names."</p>

<br>

<p>T.B. read the reply and handed it without a word to the
other.</p>

<p>"Please God, I'll hang the man who sent that message," he
said with unusual earnestness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap21" name="chap21">XXI. &mdash; POLTAVO
STRIKES</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT was half-past nine when T.B. sent and
received the last message; and an hour later he had interviewed
the Commissioner.</p>

<p>"Get your lady away all right?" his chief greeted him.</p>

<p>"Well away, sir," said T.B. serenely. "Out of reach of
Poltavo&mdash;his agents were watching the flat&mdash;there was
a burglary there the very night the book arrived."</p>

<p>"And the lady?"</p>

<p>"She is due in Jamaica in a few days."</p>

<p>"And now&mdash;"</p>

<p>T.B. told the story of the developments. The Commissioner
nodded from time to time.</p>

<p>"You're an ingenious young man," he said. "One of these fine
days somebody will badly want your blood."</p>

<p>"It has often happened," T.B. granted. He sat over a
companionable cigar and a whisky and soda, talking until the
hands of the clock were near on midnight; then he rose to take
his leave.</p>

<p>"You will leave for Spain to-morrow?" asked the chief.</p>

<p>"Yes; by the first train. I shall take Van Ingen, with me; he
speaks Spanish with ease, while I can only blunder through with
a phrase or two. I can get the warrants from the Yard before I
leave," he continued, "and the Spanish authorities will give me
all the help I need."</p>

<p>"And what of Poltavo?" asked the Chief Commissioner.</p>

<p>T.B. shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"We had a murderer there," he said. "I am satisfied that he
killed Moss. Whether he actually stabbed Hyatt, I am not sure.
The man had such a perfect organisation in London that it is
possible that one of his cutthroat friends served him in the
case of that unfortunate young man. Count Poltavo can wait. If
we get the others, we shall get him. He has powerful friends; we
must move with caution.</p>

<p>"Good-night, sir."</p>

<p>He grasped the proffered hand, and his host ushered him into
the silent street.</p>

<p>He took two steps forward, when a man rose apparently from
the ground, and two shots rang out. T.B. had drawn his revolver
and fired from his hip, and his assailant staggered back cursing
as a dark shadow came running from the opposite side of the road
to his help.</p>

<p>Then T.B. swayed, his knees bent under him, and he fell back
into the Commissioner's arms.</p>

<p>"I'm done," he said, and the third man, hesitating a moment
in the roadway, heard the words and slipped his revolver back
into his pocket and fled.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap22" name="chap22">XXII. &mdash; THE CONVICT FROM
CEUTA</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE streets of Cadiz were deserted. Only by the
Quay was there any sign of life, for here the crew of the
Brazilian warship, the <i>Maria Braganza</i>, were languidly
embarking stores on flat-bottomed lighters, and discussing, with
a wealth of language and in no complimentary terms, the energy
of their commander. It was obvious, so they said in their
picturesque language, that a warship was never intended to carry
cargo, and if the Brazilian Government was foolish enough to
purchase war stores in Spain, it should go a little farther, and
charter a Spanish merchant ship to carry them.</p>

<p>So they cursed Captain Lombrosa for a dog and the son of a
dog, and predicted for him an eternity of particular
discomfort.</p>

<p>Captain Lombrosa, a short, swarthy man, knew nothing of his
unpopularity and probably cared less. He was sitting in the Cafe
of the Five Nations, near the Plaza Mayor, picking his teeth
thoughtfully and reading from time to time the cablegram from
his Government which informed him that certain defalcations of
his had been discovered by the paymaster-general of the navy,
and demanding peremptorily his return to Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>To say that Captain Lombrosa was unperturbed would be to
exaggerate. No man who builds his house upon sand can calmly
regard the shifting foundations of his edifice. But he was not
especially depressed, for many reasons. The Government had
merely anticipated events by a week or so.</p>

<p>He read the cablegram with its pencilled decodation, smiled
sadly, put up his feet on a chair, and called for another bottle
of Rioja.</p>

<p>There is an unlovely road through the dreary waste that leads
from Cadiz to San Fernando. Beyond the city and beyond the
Arsenal the road winds through the bleak salt marshes to Jerez,
that Xeres de la Frontera which has given its name to the amber
wine of Spain.</p>

<p>A solitary horseman cantered into San Fernando, his clothing
white with brackish dust. He drew rein before the Cafe Cruz
Blanca and dismounted, an untidy barefooted boy leading his
horse away. There were few people in the saloon of the caf&eacute;, for
a chill wind was abroad, and the <i>cappa</i> is a very poor
protection against the icy breezes that blow from the
Sierras.</p>

<p>A man greeted the horseman as he entered&mdash;a stout man
with bulging cheeks and puffy eyes. He breathed wheezily, and
his hands moved with a strange restlessness.</p>

<p>They hailed each other in the Andalusian dialect, and the
newcomer ordered "Cafe c'leche."</p>

<p>"Well, friend?" asked the stout man, when the waiter had
disappeared. "What is the news?"</p>

<p>He spoke in English.</p>

<p>"The best," replied the other in the same language. "T.B. is
finished."</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"It's a fact. Ramundo shot him at close range, but the devil
went down fighting. They've got Ramundo."</p>

<p>The fat man snorted.</p>

<p>"Isn't that dangerous?" he asked.</p>

<p>"For us, no; for him, yes," said the man carelessly. "Ramundo
knows nothing except that he has been living in the lap of
luxury in London on the wages of an unknown employer."</p>

<p>"What will he get?" asked the stout man nervously.</p>

<p>The man looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"You are getting jumpy, friend Grayson," he said coolly.</p>

<p>"I am getting sick of this life," said Grayson. "We're making
money by the million, but what is the use of it? We are dogs
that dare not show our noses abroad; we're exiled and damned,
and there is no future."</p>

<p>"You might as well be here as in prison," philosophised his
friend. "And in prison you most certainly would be, if not
worse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We had no hand in the murders," interrupted Grayson
pleadingly. "Now did we, Baggin?"</p>

<p>"I know little about the English law," drawled George T.
Baggin, sometime treasurer of the London, Manhattan, and Jersey
Securities Syndicate. "But such knowledge as I have enables me
to say with certainty that we should be hanged&mdash;sure."</p>

<p>The fat man collapsed, mopping his brow.</p>

<p>"Ramundo killed one and Poltavo the other," he mumbled. "What
about Poltavo?"</p>

<p>"He was standing by when T.B. was shot; but, as soon as he
saw the policeman was down and out, he skipped. He arrives
to-night."</p>

<p>Some thought came to him which was not quite agreeable, for
he frowned.</p>

<p>"Poltavo, of course, knows," he went on meditatively.
"Poltavo is one with us."</p>

<p>"He has been a valuable member," ventured Grayson.</p>

<p>"Had been," said the other, emphasising the first word.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Was it not he who established our stations
and got the right men to work 'em? Why, he has got the whole
thing at his fingers' ends."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Baggin, with a wry smile. "And he has us at his
fingers' ends also&mdash;where are our friends?&mdash;the other
matter I have arranged without calling in Poltavo."</p>

<p>"They are returning to-night." The fat man shifted
uncomfortably. "You were saying about this T.B. fellow&mdash;he
is dead?"</p>

<p>"Not dead, but nearly; Poltavo saw him carried into the
house, and a little later an ambulance came flying to the door.
He saw him carried out. Later he enquired at the
hospital&mdash;sent in his card, if you please&mdash;and found
that Smith was shot through the shoulder."</p>

<p>Grayson lowered his voice.</p>

<p>"Is Poltavo&mdash;" He did not complete his sentence.</p>

<p>"He's dangerous. I tell you, Grayson, we are on tender ice;
there's a crackling and a creaking in the air."</p>

<p>Grayson licked his dry lips.</p>

<p>"I've been having dreams lately," he rumbled. "Horrid dreams
about prisons&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, cut it out!" said Baggin. "There's no time for fool
dreaming. I'm going to the committee to-night; you back me up.
Hullo!"</p>

<p>A beggar had sidled into the caf&eacute; in the waiter's absence. He
moved with the furtive shuffle of the practised mendicant.</p>

<p>His hair was close-cropped, and on his cheeks was a three
days' growth of beard.</p>

<p>He held out a grimy hand.</p>

<p>"Senor," he murmured. "For Dios&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get out."</p>

<p>The man looked at him appealingly.</p>

<p>"Diez centimes, senor," he whined.</p>

<p>Baggin raised his hand, but checked its descent.</p>

<p>He had seen something behind the ragged jacket closely
buttoned at the throat.</p>

<p>"Wait for me on the road to Jerez," he commanded, and tossed
the man a silver piece. The beggar caught it with the skill of
an expert. Baggin cut short the torrent of thanks, blessings,
and protestations.</p>

<p>"Meet me in half-an-hour; you understand?"</p>

<p>"What the devil are you going to do?" demanded Grayson.</p>

<p>"You shall see."</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later they emerged from the caf&eacute;, Baggin to his
horse, and the fat man to a capacious victoria that he had
summoned from the hotel stables.</p>

<p>A mile along the road they came up with the beggar.</p>

<p>"Get down, Grayson, and send the victoria on; you can signal
it when you want it."</p>

<p>He waited until the empty victoria had driven away; then he
turned to the waiting ragamuffin.</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Carlos Cabindez," said the man hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"At Ronda."</p>

<p>"Where have you come from?"</p>

<p>"Tarifa."</p>

<p>"What is your trade?"</p>

<p>The man grinned and shuffled his feet.</p>

<p>"A fisherman," he said at last.</p>

<p>Baggin's hand suddenly shot out; and, grasping his collar,
tore open the frayed jacket. The man wrenched himself free with
an imprecation.</p>

<p>"Take your hand from that knife," commanded Baggin. "I will
do you no harm. Where did you get that shirt?"</p>

<p>The beggar scowled and drew the threadbare coat across his
chest.</p>

<p>"I bought it," he said.</p>

<p>"That's a lie," said Baggin. "It is a prisoner's shirt; you
are an escaped convict."</p>

<p>The man made no answer.</p>

<p>"From Ceuta?"</p>

<p>Again no reply.</p>

<p>"What was your sentence? Answer."</p>

<p>"Life," said the other sullenly.</p>

<p>"Your crime?"</p>

<p>"<i>Asesinatos</i>."</p>

<p>"How many?"</p>

<p>"<i>Tres</i>."</p>

<p>Baggin's eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"Three murders, eh?" he said. Then, "You would like to earn a
thousand pesetas?" he asked. The man's eyes lit up.</p>

<p>Baggin turned to the troubled Grayson.</p>

<p>"You can go on, Grayson," he said. "I shall see you to-night.
In the meantime, I wish to have a little talk with our friend
here.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap23" name="chap23">XXIII. &mdash; THE HOUSE ON THE
HILL</a></h2>

<p class="first">BEYOND the town of Jerez and on the road that
runs westward to San Lucar, there is a hill. Once upon a time, a
grey old watch-tower stood upon its steepest place, but one day
there came an eccentric American who purchased the land on which
it stood, demolished the tower, and erected a castellated
mansion. Rumour had it that he was mad, but no American would be
confined on a Spaniard's appreciation of sanity.</p>

<p>The American consul at Jerez, of his charity and kindliness
of heart, journeyed out to call upon him, and received a cold
welcome. A message came to him that the proprietor was in bed
with gout, and neither then or at any time desired visitors,
which so enraged the well-meaning consul that he never called
again. The American's visits were of a fleeting character. He
was in residence less than a month in the year. Then one day he
came and remained. His name was registered as Senor Walter G.
Brown, of New York. The English police sought him as George T.
Baggin, an absconding promoter, broker, bucket-shop keeper, and
all-round thief. After a time he began to receive visitors, who
stayed on also.</p>

<p>Then came a period when Mr. Walter G. Brown became
aggressively patriotic. He caused to be erected on the topmost
tower of his mansion an enormous flagstaff, from which flew on
rare occasions a ridiculously small Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>At night, the place of the flag was taken by a number of
thick copper strands, and simple-minded villagers in the country
about reported strange noises, for all the world like the
rattling of dried peas in a tin canister.</p>

<p>On the evening of a wintry day, many people journeyed up the
steep pathway that led to the mansion on the hill. They came
singly and in pairs, mostly riding, although one stout man drove
up in a little victoria drawn by two panting mules. The last to
come was Mr. Baggin, an unpleasant smile on his square face.</p>

<p>By the side of his horse trotted a breathless man in a
tattered coat, his cropped head bare.</p>

<p>"I will show you where to stand," Baggin said.</p>

<p>"There is a curtain that covers a door. The man will pass by
that curtain, and I shall be with him. I will hold his
arm&mdash;so. Then I will say, 'Count Poltavo, I do not trust
you,' and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>The ragged man swept the sweat from his forehead with the
back of his hand, for the path was steep.</p>

<p>"And then," he grunted, "I will strike."</p>

<p>"Surely," warned the other.</p>

<p>The man grinned.</p>

<p>"I shall not fail," he said significantly. They disappeared
into the great house&mdash;it is worthy of note that Baggin
opened the door with a key of his own&mdash;and darkness fell
upon the hill and upon the valley.</p>

<p>Far away, lights twinkling through the trees showed where
Jerez lay.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap24" name="chap24">XXIV. &mdash; THE NINE
BEARS</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE room in which the Nine Men sat was large,
even as rooms go in Spain. It had the appearance of a small
lecture hall. Heavy curtains of dark blue velvet hid the tall
windows, and electric lights, set at intervals in the ceiling,
provided light. The little desks at which the men sat were
placed so as to form a horseshoe.</p>

<p>Of the nine, it is possible that one knew the other, and that
some guessed the identity of all. It was difficult to disguise
Grayson, who in his life of inactivity had grown exceedingly
stout, and yet with all the trickery of the black cloaks they
wore and the crepe masks that hid their faces, it was hard
enough to single even him from his fellows. The last man had
reached his seat when one who sat at the extreme end of the
horseshoe on the president's right, rose and asked: "What of
Poltavo, brother?"</p>

<p>"He has not yet arrived," was the muffled reply.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, then, it is well that I should say what I have to
say before his return," said the first speaker.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, and eight pairs of eyes turned towards
him.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he began, "the time has come when our operations
must cease."</p>

<p>A murmur interrupted him, and he stopped.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Let us have more light," said a mask at the end of the
horseshoe, and pointed to the ceiling where only half of the
lights glowed. Baggin nodded, and the man rose and made his way
to the curtained recess where the switches were.</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" said Baggin quickly&mdash;for he suddenly
realised that there was something hidden by the curtain, a
sinister figure of a man in convict shirt, fingering the edge of
a brand-new knife. So Baggin pictured him.</p>

<p>The masked man halted in surprise.</p>

<p>"No, no," repeated Baggin, and beckoned him back. "For what I
have to say I need no light; you interrupt me, brother."</p>

<p>With a muttered apology the man resumed his seat.</p>

<p>"I have said," continued Baggin, "that the time has come when
we must seriously consider the advisability of dispersing."</p>

<p>A murmur of assent met these words.</p>

<p>"This organisation of ours has grown and grown until it has
become unwieldy," he went on.</p>

<p>"We are all business men, so there is no need for me to
enlarge upon the danger that attends the house that undertakes
responsibilities which it cannot personally attend to.</p>

<p>"We have completed a most wonderful organisation. We have
employed all the ingenuities of modern science to further our
plans. We have agents in every part of Europe, in India, Egypt,
and America. So long as these agents have been ignorant of the
identity and location of their employers, we were safe. To
ensure this, we have worked through Count Poltavo, a gentleman
who came to us some time ago&mdash;under peculiar
conditions.</p>

<p>"We have employed, too, and gratefully employed, Catherine
Dominguez, a charming lady, as to whose future you need have no
fear. Some time ago, as you all know, we established wireless
stations in the great capitals, as being the safest method by
which our instructions might be transmitted without revealing to
our agents the origin of these commands. A code was drawn up,
certain arrangements of letters and words, and this code was
deciphered and our secret revealed through the ingenuity of one
man. We were prepared to meet him on a business basis. We
communicated with him by wireless, and agreed to pay a sum not
only to himself, but to two others, if he kept our secret and
agreed to make no written record of their discovery. They
promised, but their promise was broken, and it was necessary to
employ other methods.</p>

<p>"I am fully prepared to accept responsibility for my share of
the result, just as I am prepared to share responsibility for
any other act which circumstances may have rendered
necessary.</p>

<p>"And now, gentlemen, I come to the important part in my
speech. By sharing the result of our operations we may each go
our way, in whatever guise we think most suitable, to the
enjoyment of our labours.</p>

<p>"In a short time for many of us the statute of limitations
will have worked effectively; and for others there are States in
South America that would welcome us and offer us every luxury
that money can buy or heart desire.</p>

<p>"Yet I would not advise the scattering of our forces. Rather,
I have a scheme which will, I think, enable us to extract the
maximum of enjoyment from life, at a minimum of risk. With that
end in view, I have expended from our common fund a sum equal to
half-a-million English pounds. I have completed elaborate
arrangements, which I shall ask you to approve of; I have
fashioned our future." He threw out his hands with a gesture of
pride. "It is for you to decide whether we shall go our several
ways, each in fear of the weakness of the other, our days filled
with dread, our nights sleepless with doubt, or whether in new
circumstances we shall live together in freedom, in happiness,
and in unity."</p>

<p>Again the murmured applause.</p>

<p>"But there is an element of danger which must be removed,"
Baggin went on; "&mdash;between freedom and us there lies a
shadow."</p>

<p>He stopped and looked from mask to mask.</p>

<p>"That shadow," he said slowly, "is Count Ivan Poltavo, the
man who knows our secrets, who has done our work, the one man in
the world who holds our lives in the hollow of his&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before he had finished he saw their eyes leave his face and
seek the door, and he turned to meet the calm scrutiny of the
subject of his discourse. He had entered the room whilst Baggin
was speaking and stood listening.</p>

<p>For a few moments there was silence.</p>

<p>Over Baggin's face came a startling change. The flush of
excitement died out of his cheeks, leaving him ghastly pale and
overcome with confusion. His mouth, opened to conclude his
sentence, hung gaping, as if it had suddenly been frozen in that
position. His eyes glared with rage and terror.</p>

<p>Count Poltavo advanced, hat in hand, and bowed gravely to the
masked company.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Baggin does me an honour that I do not deserve," he
said.</p>

<p>Baggin, recovering himself, shot a swift side glance at a
curtained recess behind which stooped a crop-haired man in a
convict shirt, fingering a brand-new knife.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Baggin," Count Poltavo went on, "is wrong when he
says I am the only man who stands between the Nine Bears of
Cadiz and freedom&mdash;there is another, and his name is T.B.
Smith."</p>

<p>"T.B. Smith is dead, or dying," said Baggin angrily;
"&mdash;we have your word for it."</p>

<p>His antagonist favoured him with the slightest bow.</p>

<p>"Even I may fall into an error," he said magnanimously. "T.B.
is neither dead nor dying."</p>

<p>"But he fell?"</p>

<p>The count smiled.</p>

<p>"It was clever, and for the moment even I was deceived," he
confessed.</p>

<p>He walked forward until he was opposite the curtain where the
assassin waited.</p>

<p>"He is in Jerez, messieurs&mdash;with an assistant. I saw
them upon the street this morning. Mr. Smith," he concluded,
smiling, "wore his arm in a sling."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" shouted Baggin. "Strike, Carlos!"</p>

<p>He wrenched the curtain aside, revealing the sinister figure
behind.</p>

<p>Poltavo fell back with an ashen face, but the convict made no
move.</p>

<p>Baggin sprang at him in a fury, and struck madly, blindly,
but Poltavo's arm caught his, and wrenched him backward.</p>

<p>In the count's other hand was a revolver, and the muzzle
covered the convict.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, and his eyes blazed with triumph, "I
have told you that T.B. Smith was here with an
assistant&mdash;behold the assistant!"</p>

<p>And Cord Van Ingen, in his convict shirt, standing with one
hand against the wall of the recess, and the other on his hip,
smiled cheerfully.</p>

<p>"That is very true," he said.</p>

<p>Under his hand were the three switches that controlled the
light in the room.</p>

<p>"It is also true, my young friend," said Poltavo softly,
"that you have meddled outrageously in this matter&mdash;that
you are virtually dead."</p>

<p>Van Ingen nodded.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it a Polish philosopher," he began, with all the
hesitation of one who is beginning a long discourse, "who
said&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he switched out the light and dropped flat on the floor.
The revolvers cracked together, and Poltavo uttered an oath.</p>

<p>There was a wild scramble in the dark. A knot of men swayed
over a prostrate form; then a trembling hand found the switch,
and the room was flooded with light.</p>

<p>Poltavo lay flat on his back with a bullet through his leg,
but the man they sought, the man in the striped shirt and with a
three days' growth of beard, was gone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap25" name="chap25">XXV. &mdash; IN THE
GARDEN</a></h2>

<p class="first">THAT night at nine o'clock, Cord Van Ingen
paced with beating heart the length of the tiny enclosed garden
upon which the side-door of the hotel opened, and glanced up
eagerly at every sound of footsteps. There may be men who can go
to a lover's appointment with an even pulse, but Cord Van Ingen
was not one of them. His heart sang a paean of joy and praise.
He was going to see Doris! A broad shaft of yellow light
streaming from an unshuttered window in the second story, told
him that the detective was still busy writing reports and
preparing despatches. That he regarded the expedition as a
failure the young man knew, but he was indifferent since he had
learned the one great fact. Doris was in Jerez!</p>

<p>An old woman, with a face like a withered apple, and her eyes
under the fringe of her black headshawl shining like bright
beads, had delivered the message. At the conclusion of his
adventure with the Nine, he had made his way back to the hotel,
and after a few words to the detective, had mounted to his bare
little room, bathed, shaved, and descended to supper.</p>

<p>The meal was an unsocial one, for Smith, in an execrable
temper over the miscarriage of his plans, glowered blackly
through the scant courses, and at their close vanished promptly
into his room.</p>

<p>Van Ingen lighted a cigarette, and sauntered out upon the
narrow street. He meant to stroll toward the plaza, and have a
look at the cathedral. As he stood for a moment in front of the
hotel, uncertain of the direction, an old crone, such as haunt
the steps of churches with trinkets and sacred relics for sale,
hobbled up to him, scanned his face sharply, and dropped a
courtesy.</p>

<p>"Senor Van Eenge?" she asked, in a clear soft whisper.</p>

<p>The young man fell back a pace in amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted curtly. On the instant he thought of
Poltavo, and his hand went into his coat pocket. "But how did
you know?"</p>

<p>She shook her head with a mysterious smile, and held out her
hand. "From the senorita," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Eh?" Cord stared blankly.</p>

<p>But he took the missive, scenting a romance, and laughingly
struck a match. It contained but a single pencilled line,
written, evidently, in great agitation, for the characters were
scarcely legible. The match burned down and scorched his
fingers. He lit another unsteadily, and stared again, his face
in the small circle of light pallid with excitement.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">I will see you in the garden at nine.
<span class="smcap">Doris</span>.</p>

<br>

<p>Doris, whom he had believed to be with Lady Dinsmore on the
Riviera, in this desolate, wind-raked little Spanish town? What
was the meaning of it? He turned to question the old crone, but
she had slid noiselessly into the gloom whence she had come, and
he was left standing before the hotel with only the scrap of
white paper to show that the entire incident was not the wild
imagining of an overwrought brain.</p>

<p>He bent his eyes to it again, and especially to the
signature. There could be no mistake. That funny little D of
Doris, with its childish curl at the end, he would know the
world around. It smote him with a strong emotion and gave him a
sense of reality. Doris, then, was actually near at hand,
breathing the same warm night air, watching the same moon, high
and pale, sailing across the sky. He turned back to the house,
and after a casual word with his host, a tall, spare-looking
man, with a drooping moustache and a face as sour as the
vintages he sold to his guests, he went down the short flight of
steps into the garden. The bell of the campanile somewhere in
the distance struck the four quarters, and then chimed eight
silver strokes. An hour to wait. He flung himself upon a bench
at the extreme end of the garden, beneath a pomegranate tree. As
he leaned back, a shower of the scarlet flowers fell about him.
Not far down the street, perhaps beneath some window, a youth's
voice could be heard, sweetened by distance, singing "La
Paloma." Cord wondered idly if it were another tryst.</p>

<p>He sprang up, mastered by impatience, and walked about,
whistling the same air softly. Minutes passed. Cord wondered how
she would come. The only entrance to the enclosed garden which
he had remarked lay through the lobby of the hotel. He frowned
at the thought of her meeting the cold, leering stare of his
host, and decided to meet her upon the street. With a foot upon
the lower step, he paused and lifted his head, alert, listening.
Behind him, at the end of the garden, coming from the
neighbourhood of the bench, he had heard the sound of an
unmistakable click. He sprang toward the sound, his blood racing
tumultuously through his veins.</p>

<p>Two shadows detached themselves from the deeper gloom of the
garden wall, and stood forth uncertainly. One of the shadows
held out a hand.</p>

<p>"Cord!" she murmured. She pushed back the enveloping folds of
the lace mantilla about her head. It fell away upon her
shoulders, and the pale beams of the moon shone full upon her
face. It was Doris.</p>

<p>At sight of her, the exclamation of joy died on Van Ingen's
lips. He stood rooted to the spot by the startling change in her
countenance. Her blue eyes, once so laughing, looked out from
black hollows, her cheeks were pale and slightly drawn, and her
mouth colourless. Fear, depression, misery, spoke in every
drooping line of her figure.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said at last, tremulously. "You&mdash;are not
glad to see me?"</p>

<p>With a hoarse little cry, he took her into his arms, and held
her close.</p>

<p>"My Doris!" he whispered. "What have they done to you?"</p>

<p>She trembled in the close embrace, and clung to him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I have been afraid," she said simply, "for so many
endless days! So many long white nights! I thought at times I
should go mad at the horror of it! And when I heard that you
were here, near me, in Jerez, I decided to risk all. And so
I&mdash;I came with Maria, who knows the way," she nodded toward
the other figure which had withdrawn into the shadows,
"to&mdash;to see you."</p>

<p>"To see me?" he repeated in a low voice, as one cons a
difficult lesson. "You risked all, to see me?"</p>

<p>She nodded, and raised her eyes to his. "But if you are not
glad to see me?" She strove gently to disengage herself.</p>

<p>He held her fast. At the moment, as if the heavens had opened
wide, a great light broke in upon him. He stared at the face
lying against his shoulder, flushed, eager, incredulous. Her
soft eyelids were closed. Love lay upon them like a dream, and
upon the faintly smiling lips. Her breath mounted to his
nostrils like delicate incense. He bent lower and lower.</p>

<p>"Open your eyes, darling!" he entreated. She
obeyed&mdash;their lips met. He kissed her again.</p>

<p>A slight sound came from the shadows. Doris broke from him,
breathless, but unashamed, a new-found joy in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I had almost forgot!" she exclaimed. "I came to tell you
something&mdash;something important."</p>

<p>Cord laughed. "You have told it already!" he said. "You have
been chanting wonderful, thrilling, cosmic things to me the last
ten minutes!"</p>

<p>He sat down and drew her beside him on the bench.</p>

<p>"Tell me&mdash;everything," he said gravely. She eased
herself within the circle of his arm.</p>

<p>"First, I wish you to take a message to my aunt. Tell her I
am well and happy&mdash;now!"</p>

<p>"Lady Dinsmore?" he asked in surprise. "Is she not with
you?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Aunt Patricia is in Biarritz," she
replied in a low tone. "I&mdash;I am with my father." Fear had
crept into her voice again.</p>

<p>"That is what I came to tell you," she continued. "My aunt
does not understand&mdash;she would have me desert my father.
But I shall stay with him to the end.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;Poltavo?" Van Ingen recalled her letter, and
jealousy started up within him.</p>

<p>"Count Poltavo is with us&mdash;at present," she answered in
a constrained voice. "How long he will remain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me everything, darling!" he pleaded.</p>

<p>"I can tell you&mdash;nothing!" she said passionately, her
breast heaving. "Save only that I shall be glad, glad, when this
terrible search is completed. So many lives&mdash;" For the
first time, she broke down completely, and turning from him,
sobbed bitterly, her face hidden in her hands. She rocked back
and forth in a paroxysm of grief. He bent over her, in an agony
of distress, and put his arms about her.</p>

<p>"Cord!" The voice came to him, strangled with sobs.</p>

<p>"Darling?" his mouth was close to her lips.</p>

<p>"Promise me that you will give it up?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But they will kill you&mdash;too!" she moaned.</p>

<p>"Not me!" he said cheerfully. "Not after this!" He raised her
tearful face to his. "Tell me, at least, where a letter may find
you."</p>

<p>"I shall be with my father," she replied evasively. "Count
Poltavo and Mr. Baggin are in open rupture," she hurried on.
"Each is fighting for mastery. Count Poltavo has the brains, but
Baggin has the money. Between them, they tear my poor father to
pieces."</p>

<p>"And you!" he cried in a choked, angry voice. "They are
killing you, too."</p>

<p>"I am a pawn in the game," she said listlessly. "Each side
plays me off against the other." She rose. "It is late.
Maria."</p>

<p>The old woman materialised out of the gloom, and held open
the gate. Cord arose also.</p>

<p>"You are not to come with me!" she whispered urgently.
"Good-night!"</p>

<p>He held her closely. "You love me?"</p>

<p>"Forever!" she said simply.</p>

<p>She rearranged the lace mantilla about her head, and held out
her hand.</p>

<p>"I am coming with you," he said composedly.</p>

<p>Something in his tone checked the protest on her lips.</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>They walked quietly along the narrow street, the duenna
behind, climbed a slight ascent, and stopped in front of a house
standing apart, and surrounded by a large garden.</p>

<p>She turned to him, laying one hand upon a small wicket
gate.</p>

<p>"One moment," he implored. "Count Poltavo&mdash;Your
promise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I gave my pledge to him if he would save my father," she
said sadly. "That he has not done." She opened the gate.</p>

<p>"But if he should&mdash;" he insisted.</p>

<p>She lifted her head proudly. "Then I should redeem my
pledge."</p>

<p>She vanished into the darkness of the garden, and the young
man retraced his steps to the hotel. The next morning he mounted
the steep little street with hope in his heart, and hung about,
watching anxiously. No sign of life exhibited itself. The
windows, with their close-drawn shades, stared at him blankly.
Presently an old woman hobbled out of the little wicket
gate.</p>

<p>Van Ingen approached her eagerly. "The young lady&mdash;" he
began in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Gone, senor!" She threw out her hands with an expressive
gesture, to indicate illimitable distances. "They departed, in
mad haste, in the night."</p>

<p>"And she left no message?" he cried, in bitter
disappointment.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "Nothing more than she told the
senor last night."</p>

<p>Van Ingen tossed her a silver piece, and turned slowly back
to the hotel.</p>

<h2><a id="chap26" name="chap26">XXVI. &mdash; T.B. SMITH
REPORTS</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN red, blue, and green; in type varying in
size according to the temperament of the newspaper; in words
wild or sedate, as the character of the journal demanded, the
newspaper contents bills gave London its first intimation of the
breaking up of the Nine Bears.</p>

<p>As a sensation scarcely less vivid came the astounding expos&eacute;
of Count Ivan Poltavo. Society rocked to its foundations by this
news of its favourite. From every dinner-table in London arose
the excited clamour of discussion. Lady Angela defended him
stoutly, declaring that as an artist, and ignorant of money, he
had been misled by bad, clever rascals. Men who had been forced
to take second place in his presence, now came forward, boldly,
and stated that they had always suspected him to be a rogue.</p>

<p>One brilliant young man achieved a week-long fame by looking
up his record at Scotland Yard. It appeared that the count was
indeed a black-hearted villain. Five years ago he had been
deported as an undesirable alien.</p>

<p>"But how did he escape recognition?" asked a guest.</p>

<p>The famous one smirked. "He parted his hair on one side, and
wore a moustache!"</p>

<p>Ah! Into the mind of every feminine diner arose the vivid
picture of the count&mdash;with mustachios! They sighed.</p>

<p>That the Nine Bears were dispersed was hailed as a triumph
for the English police. Unfortunately, the popular view is not
always the correct view, and T.B. Smith came back to London a
very angry man.</p>

<p>It had been no fault of his that the majority of the band had
escaped.</p>

<p>"The Civil Guard was twenty minutes late in taking up its
position," wrote T.B. in his private report.</p>

<p>"No blame attached to the Guard, which is one of the finest
police forces in the world, but to the local police authorities,
who at the eleventh hour detected some obscurity in their
instructions from Madrid, and must needs telegraph for
elucidation. So that the ring about the House on the Hill which
I commanded was not completed until long after the whole lot had
escaped. We caught Fran&ccedil;ois Zillier, who has been handed over to
the French police, but the remainder of the gang got clean away.
Apparently they have taken Count Poltavo with them; Van Ingen
declares he shot him and such indications as we have point to
his having been badly hurt. How the remainder managed to carry
him off passes my comprehension. We have secured a few
documents. There is one mysterious scrap of paper discovered in
Baggin's private room which is incoherent to a point of
wildness, and apparently the rough note of some future scheme;
it will bear re-examination."</p>

<p>"Thanks to the industry and perseverance of the English
police," said the <i>London Morning Journal</i>, commenting on
the affair, "the Nine Men of Cadiz are dispersed, their power
destroyed, their brilliant villainies a memory. It is only a
matter of time before they will fall into the hands of the
police, and the full measure of Society's punishment be awarded
them. Scattered as they are&mdash;"</p>

<p>T.B. Smith put down his paper when he came to this part, and
smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"Scattered, are they!" he said. "I doubt it." For all the
praise that was lavished upon him and upon his department, he
was not satisfied with himself. He knew that he had failed. To
break up the gang had always been possible. To arrest them and
seize the huge fortune they had amassed would have been an
achievement justifying the encomia that were being lavished upon
him.</p>

<p>"The only satisfaction I have," he said to the Chief
Commissioner, "is that we are so often cursed for inefficiency
when we do the right thing, that we can afford to take a little
credit when we've made a hash of things."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say that," demurred the Chief. "You did all that
was humanly possible."</p>

<p>T.B. sniffed.</p>

<p>"Eight men and Poltavo slipped through my fingers," he
answered briefly; "&mdash;that's a bad best." He rose from the
chair and paced the room, his head sunk on his breast.</p>

<p>"If Count Poltavo had delayed his entrance another ten
minutes," he said, stopping suddenly, "Baggin would have told
Van Ingen all that I wanted to know. This wonderful scheme of
his that was to secure them all ease and security for the rest
of their lives."</p>

<p>"He may have been boasting," suggested the other, but T.B.
shook his head.</p>

<p>"It was no boast," he said with assurance, "and if it were he
has made it good, for where are the Nine? One of them is on
Devil's Island, because he had the misfortune to fall into our
hands. But where are the others? Vanished! Dissolved into the
elements&mdash;and their money with them! I tell you, sir, there
is not even the suspicion of a trace of these men. How did they
get away from Cadiz? Not by rail, for all northward trains were
stopped at Boadilla and searched. Not by sea, for the only ship
that left that night was the Brazilian man-o'-war, <i>Maria
Braganza</i>."</p>

<p>"Airship," suggested his chief flippantly, as he moved
towards the door.</p>

<p>"It is unlikely, sir," replied T.B. coldly. The Chief
Commissioner stood with his hand on the edge of the open
door.</p>

<p>"At any rate, they are finished," he said, "their power for
further mischief is destroyed."</p>

<p>"I appreciate your optimism, sir," said T.B. impertinently,
"which I regret to say I do not share."</p>

<p>"One thing is evident, and must be remembered," T.B. went on,
as his chief still lingered.</p>

<p>"Outside of the Nine Men there must be in Europe hundreds of
agents, who, without being aware of their principals, have been
acting blindly for years in their interest. What of the men who
went to the length of murder at Poltavo's orders? What of the
assassins in Europe and America who 'arranged' the suicide of
the bank president and the wreck of the Sud Express? Not one of
these men have we been able to track down. I tell you, sir, that
outside of the inner council of this gang, Poltavo organised as
great a band of villains as the world has ever seen. They
remain; this is an indisputable fact; somewhere in the world,
scattered materially, but bound together by bonds of Poltavo's
weaving, are a number of men who formed the working parts of the
Nine Men's great machine. For the moment the steam is absent.
Yes?"</p>

<p>A constable was at the door.</p>

<p>"A message for you, sir."</p>

<p>T.B. took the envelope and tore it open mechanically. It was
a note from Van Ingen.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Saw Poltavo ten minutes ago in a hansom.
Positive&mdash;no disguise. <span class="smcap">C.V.I.</span></p>

<br>

<p>Smith sat suddenly erect. "Poltavo in London!" he breathed.
"It is incredible!"</p>

<p>He stood up, busily engaged in speculation.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE little telegraph instrument near the Chief
Inspector's desk began to click. In every police station
throughout the metropolis it snapped forth its message. In
Highgate, in Camberwell, in sleepy Greenwich, in Ladywell, as in
Stoke Newington.</p>

<p>"Clickerty, clickerty, click," it went, hastily,
breathlessly. It ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="note">TO ALL STATIONS: ARREST AND DETAIN COUNT IVAN
POLTAVO. [here the description followed.] ALL RESERVES OUT IN
PLAIN CLOTHES.</p>

<br>

<p>All reserves out!</p>

<p>That was a remarkable order.</p>

<p>London did not know of the happening; the homeward-bound
suburbanite may have noticed a couple of keen-faced men standing
idly near the entrance of the railway station, may have seen a
loiterer on the platform&mdash;a loiterer who apparently had no
train to catch. Curious men, too, came to the hotels, lounging
away the whole evening in the entrance hall, mildly interested
in people who came or went. Even the tram termini were not
neglected, nor the theatre queues, nor the boarding-houses of
Bloomsbury. Throughout London, from east to west, north to
south, the work that Scotland Yard had set silent emissaries to
perform was swiftly and expeditiously carried out.</p>

<p>T.B. sat all that evening in his office waiting. One by one
little pink slips were carried in to him and laid upon the desk
before him.</p>

<p>As the evening advanced they increased in number and
length.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock came a wire:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">NOT LEAVING BY HOOK OF HOLLAND ROUTE.</p>

<br>

<p>Soon after nine:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">CONTINENTAL MAIL CLEAR.</p>

<br>

<p>Then in rapid succession the great caravanserais reported
themselves. Theatres, bars, restaurants, every place in London
where men and women gather together, sent, through the
plain-clothes watchers, their messages.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock T.B. was reading a telegram from Harwich
when the telephone at his elbow buzzed.</p>

<p>He took up the receiver.</p>

<p>"Hullo," he said curtly.</p>

<p>For a second there was no reply, and then, very clear and
distinct, came a voice.</p>

<p>"T.B. Smith, I presume."</p>

<p>It was the voice of Count Poltavo.</p>

<p>If there had been anybody in the room but T.B., he might have
imagined it was a very ordinary call the detective was
receiving. Save for the fact that his face twitched, as was a
characteristic of his when labouring under any great excitement,
he gave no sign of the varied emotions Poltavo's voice had
aroused.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am T.B. Smith; you are, of course, Count
Poltavo?"</p>

<p>"I am, of course, Count Poltavo," said the voice suavely,
"and it is on the tip of your tongue to ask me where I am."</p>

<p>"I am hardly as foolish as that," said T.B. drily, "but
wherever you are&mdash;and I gather from the clearness of your
voice that you are in London &mdash;I shall have you."</p>

<p>There was a little laugh at the other end of the wire.</p>

<p>T.B.'s hand stole out and pressed a little bell-push that
rested on the table.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Poltavo's voice mockingly, "I am in London. I am
desirous of knowing where my friends have hidden."</p>

<p>"Your friends?" T.B. was genuinely astonished.</p>

<p>"My friends," said the voice gravely, "who so ungenerously
left me to die on the salt plains near Jerez whilst they were
making their escape."</p>

<p>A constable entered the room whilst Poltavo was talking, and
T.B. raised his hand warningly.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said carelessly, "why you have not joined
them."</p>

<p>Then, like a flash, he brought his hand down over the
transmitter and turned to the waiting constable.</p>

<p>"Run across to Mr. Elk's room," he said rapidly; "call the
Treasury Exchange and ask what part of London&mdash;what
office&mdash;this man is speaking to me from."</p>

<p>Poltavo was talking before T.B. had finished giving his
instructions.</p>

<p>"Why have I not joined them?" he said, and there was a little
bitterness in his voice,&mdash;" because they do not wish to
have me. Poltavo has served his purpose! Where are they
now?&mdash;that is what I wish to know. More important still, I
greatly desire a piece of information which you alone, monsieur,
can afford me."</p>

<p>The sublime audacity of the man brought a grin to T.B.'s
face.</p>

<p>"And that is?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There was," said Poltavo, "amongst the documents you found
at our headquarters in Jerez a scrap of paper written somewhat
unintelligibly, and apparently&mdash;I should imagine, for I
have not seen it&mdash;without much meaning."</p>

<p>"There was," said T.B. cheerfully.</p>

<p>"So much I gathered from Baggin's agitation on our retreat,"
said Poltavo. "Where, may I ask, is this interesting piece of
literature deposited?"</p>

<p>The cool, matter-of-fact demand almost took T.B.'s breath
away.</p>

<p>"It is at present at Scotland Yard," he said.</p>

<p>"With my&mdash;er&mdash;<i>dossier</i>?" asked the voice, and
a little laugh followed.</p>

<p>"Rather with the <i>dossier</i> of your friend Baggin," said
T.B.</p>

<p>"In case I should ever want to&mdash;how do you
say&mdash;burgle Scotland Yard," said the drawling voice again,
"could you give me explicit instructions where to find it?"</p>

<p>T.B.'s anxiety was to keep Poltavo engaged in conversation
until the officer he had despatched to the telephone
returned.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "at present it is in the cabinet marked
'Unclassified Data,' but I cannot promise you that it will
remain there. You see, count, I have too high an opinion of your
enterprise and daring."</p>

<p>He waited for a reply, but no reply came, and at that moment
the door opened and the constable he had sent on the errand
appeared.</p>

<p>T.B. covered the transmitter again.</p>

<p>"The Treasury say that you are not connected with anybody,
sir," he said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>T.B. stared at him.</p>

<p>He moved his hand from the transmitter and called softly,
"Poltavo!"</p>

<p>There was no reply, and he called again.</p>

<p>He looked up with the receiver still at his ear.</p>

<p>"He's rung off."</p>

<p>Then a new voice spoke.</p>

<p>"Finished, sir?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;who are you?" demanded T.B. quickly.</p>

<p>"Exchange, sir&mdash;Private Exchange, Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>"Who was talking to me then? Where was he talking from?"</p>

<p>"Why, from the Record Office."</p>

<p>T.B., his face white, leapt to his feet.</p>

<p>"Follow me," he said, and went racing down the long corridor.
He went down the broad stairs three at a time.</p>

<p>A constable on duty in the hall turned in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Has anybody left here recently?" asked T.B.
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"A gentleman just gone out, sir," said the man; "went away in
a motor-car."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Elk in the building?"</p>

<p>"In the Record Office, sir," said the man. Up the stairs
again flew the detective.</p>

<p>The Record Office was at the far end of the building.</p>

<p>The door was ajar and the room in darkness, but T.B. was in
the room and had switched on the light.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room was stretched the unfortunate Elk
in a pool of blood. A life-preserver lay near him. T.B. leant
over him; he was alive, but terribly injured; then he shot a
swift glance round the room. He saw the telephone with the
receiver off; he saw an open cabinet marked "Unclassified Data,"
and it was empty.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap27" name="chap27">XXVII. &mdash; THE LOST
WARSHIP</a></h2>

<p class="first">POLTAVO had escaped. There was pother enough
&mdash;eight of the Nine Bears had melted into nothingness. No
official feather came to T.B.'s cap for that, whatever praise
the mistaken public might award. Worst of all, and most shocking
outrage of all, the Record Office at Scotland Yard had been
burgled and important documents had been stolen. But Elk had not
been killed, so the incident did not come before the public.</p>

<p>The contents of the documents were not lost to the police,
for Scotland Yard does not put all its eggs into one basket,
even when the basket is as secure a one as the Record Office.
There were photographs innumerable of the scrap of paper, and
one of these was on T.B. Smith's desk the morning after the
robbery.</p>

<p>The memorandum, for such it was, was contained in less than a
hundred words. Literally, and with all its erasures written out,
it ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="note">"Idea [crossed out]. Ideas [written again].
Suppose we separated; where to meet; allowing for accidental
partings; must be some spot; yet that would be dangerous;
otherwise, must be figures easily remembered; especially as none
of these people have knowledge [crossed out and rewritten];
especially as difficult for non-technical [word undecipherable]
to fix in mind, and one cipher makes all difference. LOLO be
good, accessible, unfrequented. Suggest on first Ju every year
we rendezvous at Lolo.</p>

<p class="note">"(Mem.&mdash;Lolo would indeed be nowhere!)</p>

<p class="note">"So far have only explained to Zillier."</p>

<br>

<p>That was all, and T.B. read and reread the memorandum.
Zillier was the only man who knew. By the oddest of chances,
Baggin had confided his plans to the one man who might have
found them useful if Providence had given him one chance of
escape. But the French Government had him safe enough on Devil's
Island.</p>

<p>For the rest, the "note" needed much more explanation than he
could give it.</p>

<p>He took a pen and began to group the sentences he could not
understand.</p>

<p>"Must be some spot; yet that would be dangerous; otherwise,
must be figures easily remembered."</p>

<p>A spot would be dangerous? He was perplexed and showed it.
What was meant by "spot"?</p>

<p>"On the 1st of Ju we rendezvous at Lolo&mdash;nowhere!"</p>

<p>"This is absolute nonsense!" The detective threw down his pen
and jumped up. He called in the Chief Commissioner's office and
was received cordially.</p>

<p>"Any news, T.B.; what do you make of your puzzle?"</p>

<p>T.B. made a little grimace.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said, "and if the original had not been stolen
I should not have troubled to study it."</p>

<p>He gained the Strand by a short cut.</p>

<p>A contents bill attracted his attention, and he stopped to
buy an evening newspaper.</p>

<br>

<p class="headline">LOSS OF A WARSHIP</p>

<br>

<p>He turned the paper before he discovered the small paragraph
that justified so large a bill.</p>

<br>

<p class="newspaper">The Brazilian Government has sent another
cruiser to search for the Brazilian man-of-war, <i>Maria
Braganza</i>, which is a month overdue. It is feared that the
warship foundered in the recent cyclone in the South
Atlantic.</p>

<br>

<p>"<i>Maria Braganza</i>?" thought T.B., and remembered where
he had seen the vessel.</p>

<p>The ship and her fate passed out of his mind soon afterward,
for he had a great deal of routine work requiring his attention,
but the name cropped up again in the course of the day and in a
curious manner.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">A DRUNKEN sailor, obviously of foreign
extraction, was ejected, fighting, from a small public-house in
the Edgware Road. He rose from the ground slowly, and stood
apparently debating in his mind whether he should go away
quietly or whether he should return to the attack. It is not too
much to say that had he decided upon the pacific course, the
mystery of the whereabouts of the Nine Bears might never have
been elucidated. In that two seconds of deliberation hung the
fates of Baggin and his confederates, and the reputation of
Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>The foreign sailor made up his mind. Back to the swing-doors
of the tavern he staggered, pushed them open, and entered.</p>

<p>A few minutes later a police-whistle blew, and a commonplace
constable strolled leisurely to the scene of the disturbance and
took into custody the pugnacious foreigner on a charge of "drunk
and disorderly."</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the final fight with the "Bears," a
fight which cost Europe over a million of money and many lives,
but which closed forever the account of the Nine Bears of
Cadiz.</p>

<p>"Here is a case that will amuse you, T.B.," said the Chief,
strolling into his bureau; "&mdash;a man, giving the name of
Silva, who has been taken to the police-station on the prosaic
charge of 'D. and D.,' is found to be a walking cash deposit.
Twelve hundred pounds in Bank of England notes and 26,000 francs
in French money was found in his possession. He speaks little or
no English, has the appearance of being a sailor&mdash;will you
go down and see what you can make of him?"</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour the Assistant-Commissioner was at the
police-station.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the station sergeant, "he's quiet now. I
don't think he's so very drunk, only pugilistically so."</p>

<p>"What do you make of him?"</p>

<p>"He's a sailor; a deserter from some foreign navy, I should
say. He has underclothes of a uniform type, and there's a sort
of device on his singlet&mdash;three stars and a number."</p>

<p>"Brazilian Navy," said T.B. with promptness. "Talkative?"</p>

<p>The sergeant smiled.</p>

<p>"In his own language, very," he said drily. "When I searched
him, he said a great number of things which were probably very
rude."</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"I'll see him," he said.</p>

<p>A gaoler led him down a long corridor. On either side were
long stone-painted doors, each with a little steel wicket.</p>

<p>Stopping before one door, he inserted his bright key in the
lock, snapped back a polished bolt, and the door swung open.</p>

<p>A man who was sitting on a wooden bench with his head in his
hands, jumped to his feet as the Assistant-Commissioner entered,
and poured forth a volume of language.</p>

<p>"Softly, softly," said T.B. "You speak French, my
friend."</p>

<p>"Oui, monsieur," said the man. "Though I am Spanish."</p>

<p>"You are a deserter from a Brazilian warship," said T.B.</p>

<p>The man stared at him defiantly.</p>

<p>"Is not that so, friend?"</p>

<p>The prisoner shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I should like to smoke," was all that he said. T.B. took his
gold case from an inside pocket and opened it.</p>

<p>"Many thanks," said the sailor, and took the lighted match
the gaoler had struck. If he had known the ways of the English
police, he would have grown suspicious. Elsewhere, a man might
be bullied, browbeaten, frightened into a confession. In France,
<i>Juge d'Instruction</i> and detective would combine to wring
from his reluctant lips a damaging admission. In America, the
Third Degree, most despicable of police methods, would have been
similarly employed.</p>

<p>But the English police do most things by kindness, and do
them very well.</p>

<p>The sailor puffed at his cigarette, from time to time looking
up from the bench on which he sat at the detective's smiling
face.</p>

<p>T.B. asked no questions; he had none to ask; he did not
demand how the man came by his wealth; he would not be guilty of
such a crudity. He waited for the sailor to talk. At last he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," he said, "you wish to know where I got my
money?"</p>

<p>T.B. said nothing.</p>

<p>"Honestly," said the sailor loudly, and with emphatic
gesture; "honestly, monsieur;" and he went on earnestly, "By my
way of reckoning, a man has a price."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," agreed T.B.</p>

<p>"A price for body and soul." The sailor blew a ring of smoke
and watched it rising to the vaulted roof of the cell.</p>

<p>"Some men," continued the man, "in their calm moments set
their value at twenty million dollars&mdash;only to sell
themselves in the heat of a foolish moment for&mdash;" He
snapped his fingers.</p>

<p>"I have never," thought T.B., "come into contact with so many
philosophical criminals in my life."</p>

<p>"Yet I would beg you to believe," said the sailor, "it is a
question of opportunity and need. There are moments when I would
not risk my liberty for a million pesetas&mdash;there have been
days when I would have sold my soul for ten mil-reis." He paused
again, for he had all the Latin's appreciation of an audience;
all the Latin's desire for dramatic effect.</p>

<p>"Sixty thousand pesetas is a large sum, monsieur; it amounts
to more than &pound;2,000 in your money&mdash;that was my price!"</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"I will set you a riddle: on the <i>Maria Braganza</i> we had
one hundred officers and men&mdash;"</p>

<p>T.B. saw light.</p>

<p>"You are a deserter from the <i>Maria Braganza</i>," he
said&mdash;but the man shook his head smilingly.</p>

<p>"On the contrary. I have my discharge from the navy, properly
attested and signed by my good captain. You will find it at my
lodgings, in a tin trunk under a picture of the blessed Saint
Teresa of Avila, or, as some say, Segovia. No, monsieur
officer, I am discharged honourably. Listen."</p>

<p>His cigarette was nearly finished, and T.B. opened his case
again, and the man, with a grateful inclination of his head,
helped himself. Slowly, he began his story, a story which,
before all others, helps the mind to grasp the magnitude of a
combination which made the events he described possible.</p>

<p>"I was a sub-officer on the <i>Maria Braganza</i>," he began,
and went on to narrate the history of the voyage of that
remarkable battleship from the day it left Rio until it steamed
into the roadstead off Cadiz.</p>

<p>"We stayed at Cadiz much longer than we expected, and the men
were grumbling&mdash;because our next port was to have been Rio.
But for some reason our Captain Lombrosa did not wish to sail.
Then one day he came on board&mdash;he spent most of his time
ashore&mdash;looking extremely happy. Previous to this he had
lived and walked in gloom, as though some matter were preying on
his mind. But this was all changed now. Whatever troubles he had
were evaporated. He walked about the deck, smiling and cracking
jokes, and we naturally concluded that he had received his
orders to sail back to Brazil at once.</p>

<p>"That same day we were ordered to take on board stores which
the Government had purchased. Whatever stores these were, they
were extremely heavy. They were packed in little square boxes,
strongly made and clamped with steel. Of these boxes we took two
hundred and fifty, and the business of transporting them
occupied the greater part of a whole day."</p>

<p>"What was the weight of them?" asked T.B.</p>

<p>"About fifty kilos," said the man, "and," he added with an
assumption of carelessness, "they each contained gold."</p>

<p>T.B. did a little sum in his head.</p>

<p>"In fact a million and a half of English pounds," he said
half to himself.</p>

<p>"As to that I do not know," said the other, "but it was
enormous; I discovered the gold by accident, for I and another
officer had been chosen to store the boxes in one of the
ammunition flats, and, owing to the breaking of a box, I
saw&mdash;what I saw.</p>

<p>"However, to get back to the captain. In the evening he came
aboard, having first given orders for steam to be ready and
every preparation made for slipping.</p>

<p>"Then it was I told him that I had seen the contents of one
of the boxes, and he was distressed.</p>

<p>"'Who else has seen this?' he asked, and I informed him of
the sub-officer who had been with me.</p>

<p>"'Do not speak of this matter, as you value your soul,' he
said, 'for this is a high Government secret&mdash;send sub-officer
Alverez to me '&mdash;that was the name of my companion.
I obeyed and sent Alverez aft. He too received similar
injunctions, and was dismissed.</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock that night, the quartermasters went to their
stations, and all stood ready for dropping our mooring.</p>

<p>"As the hours wore on, the captain began to show signs of
impatience. I was on the bridge with the officer of the watch,
and the captain was pacing up and down, now looking at his watch
and swearing, now training his binocular on a portion of the
land to the north of the town.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten to say that at 8.30 the ship's steam pinnace
had been sent away, and that it had not returned.</p>

<p>"It was for the coming of the pinnace, and whoever was coming
with it, that our captain displayed so much anxiety.</p>

<p>"It was eleven o'clock before the boat came alongside. We
heard it racing across the water&mdash;for the night was very
still. Then it drew alongside, and a number of gentlemen came on
board. They were all talking excitedly, and seemed as though
they had walked a long distance, for, by the light of the branch
lamp that lit the gangway, I saw that their boots and trousers
were white with dust, such as I believe lies on the road outside
Cadiz. One was in a state of great fear; he was very stout.
Another, and he was the leader, spoke to our captain, and soon
after I heard the order given&mdash;'Quartermaster, stand by for
going out of harbour,' and the captain gave the navigating
officer his course. We went out at full speed, steering a course
due west.</p>

<p>"It was a perfectly calm night, with stars, but no moon. When
(as near as I can guess) we were twenty miles from the coast,
the captain sent for me and Alverez to his cabin.</p>

<p>"'My friends,' he said, 'I have a proposition to make to you,
but first let me ask you if you are good patriots.'</p>

<p>"We said that we were.</p>

<p>"'What,' said the captain, addressing himself to me, 'do you
value your patriotism at?'</p>

<p>"I was silent.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said the prisoner earnestly, "I assure you I was
not considering the insult offered to me, because we had got to
a point outside of abstract morality. In my mind was a
dilemma&mdash;if I ask too much I might lose an opportunity, if
I ask too little I should assuredly lose money. Such was also
the consideration in Alverez's mind. 'Senor Capitan,' I said,
'as an honest man&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'We will leave that out of the question,' said the captain.
'Name a price.'</p>

<p>"And so, at random, I suggested a sum equal to &pound;3,000, and
Alverez, not a man of any originality, repeated '&pound;3,000.'</p>

<p>"The captain nodded; 'This sum I will pay you,' he said.
'Moreover, I will give you your discharge from the Navy of
Brazil, and you may leave the ship to-night.'</p>

<p>"I did not ask him why. I realised he had some high scheme
which it was not proper I should know, besides which I had not
been ashore for a month&mdash;and there was the &pound;3,000.</p>

<p>"'Before you go,' said the captain, 'I will explain to you,
that my honour and my reputation may not suffer. In a few days'
time, when we are at sea, the comrades you leave behind will be
offered a new service, a service under a new and wealthier
government, a government that will offer large and generous
rewards for faithful service and obedience.'"</p>

<p>The prisoner chuckled softly, as at some thought which amused
him.</p>

<p>"We went ashore in the steam pinnace; the captain himself
superintending our landing. It was a remarkable journey,
senor.</p>

<p>"You may imagine us in the open sea, with nothing but the
'chica clucka, clucka!' of the engine of our little boat!
Alverez and myself sat at the bow with our hands on the butts of
our revolvers&mdash;we knew our captain&mdash;and he himself
steered us for the lights that soon came up over the horizon. We
landed at Cadiz, and were provided with papers to the Brazilian
consul, should our return be noticed. But none saw us, or if
they did, thought nothing of the spectacle of two Brazilian
seamen walking through the streets at that hour of the night;
remember that none but the port authorities were aware that the
<i>Maria Braganza</i> had sailed. The next morning we procured
some civilian clothing, and left by the afternoon train for
Seville. By easy stages we came first to Madrid, then to Paris.
Here we stayed some time."</p>

<p>He chuckled again.</p>

<p>"Alverez," he resumed, "is a man of spirit, but, as I have
said, of no great originality. In Paris a man of spirit may go
far, a man of money farther, always providing that behind the
spirit and the wealth there is intelligence. My poor Alverez
went his own way in Paris. He made friends."</p>

<p>Again he smiled thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Alverez I left," he explained; "his ways are not my ways. I
came to England. I do not like this country," he said frankly.
"Your lower classes are gross people, and very quarrelsome."</p>

<p>A few more questions were asked, and answered, and ten
minutes later T.B. was flying back to Scotland Yard with the
story of the stolen battleship.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap28" name="chap28">XXVIII. &mdash; THE "MARIA
BRAGANZA"</a></h2>

<p class="first">ONCE more were the Nine Men in the bill of
every newspaper in London. Once more the cables hummed from
world's end to world's end, and slowly, item by item, came
fragmentary scraps of news which Scotland Yard pieced
together.</p>

<br>

<p class="newspaper">"Of all extraordinary developments," said
the <i>London Journal</i>, "in any great criminal case, nothing
has ever equalled, in its improbability, the present phase of
this remarkable case.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"And now we have reached the stage which we
confidently hope will be a final one. It is clear that these
men, having command of enormous riches, gained at the sacrifice
of life, and by the ruin of thousands of innocent people,
secured to their service the Captain of the Brazilian warship,
<i>Maria Braganza</i>. So that somewhere in the wide seas of the
world is a stolen battleship, having on board a congregation of
the world's worst rascals, Napoleonic in the largeness of their
crimes.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Many and fantastic are the suggestions
that have been put forward as to the whereabouts of the Nine Men
of Cadiz. One of our contemporaries draws a fanciful picture of
life on some gorgeous Southern Pacific isle, out of the track of
steamers, and pictures the Nine Men living in a condition of
Oriental splendour, an existence of <i>dolce far niente</i>.
Such a supposition is, of course, on the face of it absurd. Such
an island exists only in the fancy of the romantic writer. The
uninhabited portions of the globe are few, and are, in the main,
of the character of the Sahara desert. Wherever life can be
sustained, wherever comfort and freedom from disease wait the
newcomer, be sure the newcomer has already arrived."</p>

<p><br>
This much is quoted from the <i>Journal</i> because it
approaches near enough to truth and actuality to merit
quotation.</p>

<p>That Baggin had based all his plans on the supposition that
such an island existed, and could be discovered, we now know. He
was the possessor of an imagination, but his geographical
knowledge was faulty.</p>

<p>The "idea," that scrap of paper which Count Poltavo had
risked his neck to obtain, was simple enough now&mdash;up to a
point.</p>

</table>

<br>

<p><br>
This last was the only part of the little clue that offered
any difficulty to T.B. The <i>Gazetteer</i> supplied no
explanation,</p>

<p>Nor could the Admiralty help. The naval authorities did their
best to unravel the mystery of "Lolo."</p>

<p>A conference of the Ambassadors met in London, and it was
jointly agreed that the nations should act in concert to bring
the <i>Maria Braganza</i> and her crew to justice as speedily as
possible. The Brazilian Government agreed to indemnify the
Powers in their action, and, in the event of the destruction of
the ship being necessitated by resistance on the part of its
rebel captain, to accept an agreed sum as compensation.</p>

<p>There are surprising periods of inaction in the record of all
great accomplishments, which those who live, rather than those
who read the stories of achievements, realise.</p>

<p>There were weeks of fretting and days of blank despair in one
room at Scotland Yard. For the examination of all clues led to
the one end. Somewhere in the world were the Nine Men of
Cadiz&mdash;but where, none could say. Every port in every
civilised land was alert. Captains of mail steamers, of grimy
little tramps, of war vessels of every nation, watched for the
battleship. Three British cruisers, detached unostentatiously
from the Home Fleet, cruised unlikely seas, but with no good
result.</p>

<p>Then began the new terror.</p>

<p>T.B. had always had one uncomfortable feeling, a feeling that
the dissipation of the Nine had not dispelled, and that was the
knowledge that somewhere in Europe the machinery set up with
devilish ingenuity by Poltavo still existed. Who were the
desperate and broken men who acted as agents to the Nine?
Whoever they were, they had been well chosen.</p>

<p>The weeks passed without further news of the ship, and T.B.
was beginning to worry, for good reasons. He had an elaborate
chart supplied to him by the Admiralty, which showed him, from
day to day, the amount of provisions and coal such a ship as the
<i>Maria Braganza</i> would require, and he knew that she must
be running short. Then, one morning, he received a clue.</p>

<p>A telegram came to Scotland Yard, which began:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">"OFFICER COMMANDING GIBRALTAR REPORTS THAT
HIS WIRELESS STATION HAD BEEN INTERCEPTING MESSAGES IN CODE
WHICH BEAR SOME RESEMBLANCE TO THOSE OF N.H.C. FULL MESSAGES
HAVE BEEN FORWARDED HERE FOR DECODING. SOME OF THEM ARE
UNINTELLIGIBLE, BUT ONE PORTION OF A MESSAGE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO MAKE READ: '...ACCEPT YOUR ASSURANCE AND EXPLANATION; WE HAVE
STILL SPLENDID FIELD FOR ENTERPRISE; I WILL JOIN YOU AT LOLO
WITH SHIPLOAD OF PROVISIONS AND COLLIER ON JUNE 1ST. IN
MEANTIME, IF YOU DO AS I SUGGEST, WE CAN MAKE TERMS WITH
GOVERNMENTS AND, MOREOVER, FIND EMPLOYMENT FOR AGENTS WHO ARE AT

EXCEPTION OF WORDS 'DESTRUCTION,' 'EASILY OBTAINABLE,' AND
'INSURE.' THIS MESSAGE OBVIOUSLY BETWEEN POLTAVO AND MARIA
BRAGANZA&mdash;' COMMANDER FLEET, GIBRALTAR, HAS SENT H.M.S.
DUNCAN, ESSEX, KENT, WITH SIX DESTROYERS, INTO ATLANTIC PICK UP
MARIA BRAGANZA.'"</p>


<p><br>
T.B. read the message again, folded it carefully, and placed
it in his breast pocket. There was one word in Poltavo's message
that revealed, in a flash, the nature of the new terror with
which the Nine Men of Cadiz threatened the world.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap29" name="chap29">XXIX. &mdash; A MATTER OF
INSURANCE</a></h2>

<p class="first">YOU pass up a broad stone staircase at one end
of the Royal Exchange, and come to a landing where, confronting
you, are two big swing-doors that are constantly opening and
closing as bare-headed clerks and top-hatted brokers go swiftly
in and out.</p>

<p>On the other side of the doors is a small counter where a man
in uniform checks, with keen glance, each passer-by. Beyond the
counter are two rooms, one leading to the other, shaped like the
letter "L," and in the longer of the two sit, in innumerable
pews, quiet men with fat note-books. From desk to desk flutter
the brokers bargaining their risks, and there is a quiet but
eager buzz of voices through which, at intervals, boom the
stentorian tones of the porter calling by name the members whose
presence is required outside.</p>

<p>A stout man made a slow progress down one of the aisles,
calling at the little pews <i>en route</i>, making notes in a
silver-mounted book he held in his hand.</p>

<p>He stopped before the pew of one of the biggest underwriters.
"<i>Raglan Castle</i>?" he said laconically, and the underwriter
looked up over his spectacles, then down at the slip of paper
the man put before him.</p>

<p>"One per cent?" he asked, in some surprise, and the other
nodded.</p>

<p>"How much?" he asked.</p>

<p>The underwriter tapped the slip of paper before him.</p>

<p>"Ten thousand pounds at 5s. per centum," he said. "I can do
that." He initialled the slip, and the man passed on.</p>

<p>He went the round of the room, stopped to exchange a joke
with an acquaintance, then descended the stone stairs.</p>

<p>Back to his stuffy little office went the broker, with little
thought that he had been engaged in any unusual variety of
business. In his private room he found his client; a thick-set
man with a straggling beard, who rose politely as the broker
entered, and removed the cigar he had been smoking.</p>

<p>"You have finish?" he said, with a slightly foreign accent,
and the broker smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!"&mdash;a little pompously, after the manner of all
Lloyd's brokers&mdash;"no difficulty about the <i>Raglan</i>,
you know. Mail ship, new steamer, no risks practically on the
Cape route; rather a bad business for you; you'll lose your
premium."</p>

<p>He shook his head with a show of melancholy, and took a pinch
of snuff.</p>

<p>"I have a dream," said the foreigner hastily, "ver' bad
dream. I have belief in dreams."</p>

<p>"I daresay," said the broker indulgently. "A sister of mine
used to have 'em, or said she had; dreamt a tiger bit her, and,
sure enough, next day she lost her brooch." He sat at his desk,
signed a receipt, counted some notes, and locked them in his
drawer.</p>

<p>"You won't get your policies for a day or so," he said;
"you're staying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At the Hotel Belgique," said the client, and, pocketing his
receipts, he rose.</p>

<p>"Good-day," said the broker, and opened the door.</p>

<p>With a slight bow, his client departed, and reached the
street.</p>

<p>There was a taxi-cab drawn up before the door, and two or
three gentlemen standing on the pavement before the office.</p>

<p>"Cab, sir?" said the driver, but the foreigner shook his
head.</p>

<p>"I think you had better," said a voice in French, and a
strong hand grasped his arm. Before he realised what had
happened, the Frenchman was hustled into the cab, two men jumped
in with him, the door banged, and the car whirled westward.</p>

<p>It was a car which had extraordinary privileges, for at a nod
from the man who sat by the side of the driver the City police
held up the traffic to allow it to pass. It flew down Queen
Victoria Street at a much greater speed than is permissible
within the City boundaries, and the gloved hands of the
policemen on duty at the end of Blackfriars Bridge made a clear
way for it.</p>

<p>It turned into Scotland Yard, remained a few minutes, then
returned along the Embankment, up Northumberland Avenue, and
through a side thoroughfare to Bow Street.</p>

<p>Thereafter, the Frenchman's experience was bewildering. He
was searched, hurried through a passage to a small court, where
a benevolent-looking gentleman sat behind a table, on a raised
dais.</p>

<p>The prisoner was placed in a steel pen, and a quietly dressed
man rose from the solicitors' table, and made a brief
statement.</p>

<p>"We shall charge this man with being a suspected person, your
Worship," he said, "and ask for a remand."</p>

<p>Then another man went into the witness-box.</p>

<p>"My name is Detective-Sergeant Kiegnell, of 'A' Division," he
said; "and, from information received, I went to 976 Throgmorton
Street, where I saw the prisoner. I told him I was a police
officer, and should take him into custody."</p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p>The magistrate scribbled something on a paper before him, and
said briefly, "Remanded."</p>

<p>Before the prisoner could say a word, or utter anything more
than a "<i>Sacr&eacute;</i>!" he was beckoned from the dock and
disappeared from court.</p>

<p>So unimportant was this case that none of the reporters in
court troubled to record more than the fact that "a well-dressed
man of foreign appearance was charged with loitering with
intent."</p>

<p>Certainly nobody associated his arrest with the announcement
that the <i>Raglan Castle</i> had left Cape Town, homeward
bound.</p>

<p>It was an interesting voyage for the passengers of the
<i>Raglan Castle</i>, which, by the way, carried specie to the
amount of &pound;600,000. She left Cape Town soon after dusk. The next
morning, to the surprise of her captain, she fell in with a
little British fleet&mdash;the <i>Doris</i>, the
<i>Philomel</i>, and the <i>St. George</i>, flying a Commodore's
flag.</p>

<p>Greatest surprise of all came to the captain of the <i>Raglan
Castle</i> when he received the following signal:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">SLOW DOWN TO THIRTEEN KNOTS, AND DO NOT PART
COMPANY.</p>

<br>

<p>To the captain's "I am carrying the mails," came the laconic
message, "I know."</p>

<p>For ten days the four ships kept together, then came the
sensation of the voyage. At dawn of the tenth day, a big steamer
came into view over the horizon. She was in the direct path of
the flotilla, and to all appearance she was stationary. Those
who were on deck at that early hour heard shrill bugle sounds
from the escorting warships, then suddenly the engines of the
<i>Raglan</i> stopped, and a crowd of curious passengers came
running up from below. The <i>Raglan Castle</i> had obeyed a
peremptory order given by the <i>St. George</i>, and was
hove-to.</p>

<p>The <i>St. George</i> and <i>Doris</i> went on; then, from
the funnels of the stationary steamer, came clouds of smoke,
and, through their telescope, the passengers saw her turn slowly
and move.</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly she got under way, then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bang!"</p>

<p>The forward 9.2 gun of the <i>St. George</i> emitted a thin
straight streak of flame, and there was a strange whining noise
in the air.</p>

<p>"Bang! Bang!"</p>

<p>The <i>Doris</i> came into action at the same time as the
<i>St. George</i> fired her second gun. Both shots fell short,
and the spray of the <i>ricochets</i> leapt up into the air.</p>

<p>The fugitive steamer was now moving at full speed; there was
a great fan-shaped patch of white water at her stern.</p>

<p>"Bang!"</p>

<p>All this time the two British warships were going ahead,
firing as they went. Then, from the stern of the strange
steamer, floated a whiff of white smoke, and, in a second, the
eerie whine of a shell came to the passengers who crowded the
deck of the <i>Raglan Castle</i>. The shell missed the firing
warships; indeed, it did not seem to be aimed in their
direction, but it fell uncomfortably close to the mail boat.
Another shell fell wide of the steamer, but in a line with her.
The manoeuvre of the flying vessel was now apparent. She carried
heavier metal than the second-class cruisers of the British
fleet, but her object was to disable the mail boat.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Raglan</i> did not wait for orders; he
rung his engines full speed ahead, and swung his helm hard
aport. He was going to steam back out of range.</p>

<p>But no further shot came from the <i>Maria Braganza</i>.</p>

<p>Smaller and smaller she grew until only a pall of smoke on
the horizon showed where she lay.</p>

<p>Obeying a signal from the distant warship, the <i>Raglan</i>
came round again, and in half-an-hour had come abreast of the
two warships, the faithful <i>Philomel</i> in attendance.</p>

<p>There was a swift exchange of signals between the warships,
and their semaphore arms whirled furiously.</p>

<p>Then the Commodore's ship signalled:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">HOPE YOU ARE NOT ALARMED; YOU WILL NOT BE
TROUBLED AGAIN; GO AHEAD.</p>


<p><br>
On the twelfth day there was another shock for the excited
passengers of the <i>Raglan Castle</i>, for, nearing Cape Verde
Islands, they came upon not one warship but six&mdash;six big
black hulls lying at regular intervals along the horizon. But
there was no cause for alarm. They were the six Dreadnought
cruisers that had been sent down from Gibraltar to take up the
burden of the Cape Fleet.</p>

<p>It was all a mystery to the bewildered passengers, whatever
it might be to the officers of the Raglan, who had received a
long "lamp" message in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>There was a two hours' delay whilst the captain of the St.
George went on board the <i>Indefatigable</i> to report.</p>

<p>This was the end of the adventures that awaited the
<i>Raglan</i>. She was escorted to the Needles by the six
warships, and came into Southampton, her passengers a-flutter
with that excitement peculiar to men who have come through a
great danger and are exhilarated to find themselves alive.</p>

<p>The arrival of the <i>Raglan</i> was opportune; it gave
confirmation to the rumours which had been in circulation, and
synchronised with the issue of the manifesto of the Nine
Men&mdash;a manifesto unique in history.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap30" name="chap30">XXX. &mdash; THE "MAD
WARSHIP"</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE manifesto had arrived simultaneously at
every newspaper office in London, Paris, and Berlin.</p>

<p>It was printed on paper of a texture and quality which is
generally in use in small Continental newspaper offices. From
certain peculiarities of the printed characters, it was seen
that the type from which it was printed must have been cast in
Spain. The manifesto was neatly folded and enclosed in an
envelope of octavo size, and the actual sheet-size was what is
known in the printing trade as double-crown. The postage stamps
were Spanish, the place of posting, as revealed by the office
post-marks, were in some cases Malaga, and in some, Algeciras.
The fact that, whether posted at one place or the other, the
date of the posting was identical, supported the view that at
least two persons had been concerned in the despatch.</p>

<p>The manifesto itself ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote" style="text-align:center">TO THE CIVILIZED
NATION (<i>sic</i>)</p>

<p class="quote">Whereas, we, the company known as the Nine Men
of Cadiz, have been placed by universal decree outside the law,
and whereas it is against our desires that such decrees of
outlawry should exist against us, both from the point of view of
our own personal comfort and safety, and from the point of view
of the free exchange of commercial (<i>sic</i>)
relationships.</p>

<p class="quote">Now, therefore, we decree&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">That unless an immediate free pardon be granted
to each and every man on board the <i>Maria Braganza</i> and
liberty be given to him to go his way peaceably without arrest
or fear of molestations (<i>sic</i>), the owners and crew of the
<i>Maria Braganza</i> will declare war upon the commerce of the
world. It will loot and destroy such shipping as may with
advantage be so looted and destroyed, and in the end will fight
to the last against its aggressor.</p>

<p class="quote">(Signed) By order of the Nine.</p>

<p class="quote"><span class="smcap">Poltavo</span>.</p>

<p><br>
It is no exaggeration to say that the publication of this
manifesto caused a panic, not only in shipping circles, but
throughout the civilised world. The sea held a hidden danger,
neither life nor property was secure.</p>

<p>That the fears of the community were justified was proved by
the story of the <i>Raglan Castle</i>, and within a fortnight
came the story of the North Atlantic outrage.</p>

<p>The <i>Caratana</i>, the fastest mail-ship afloat, as well as
being nearly the largest, was sixty hours out of New York with
350 passengers on board, when she came up with a strange warship
flying a red flag. The warship hoisted an unintelligible signal,
which the captain of the <i>Caratana</i> did not understand. It
was followed by one of which there could be no mistaking the
meaning:</p>

<br>

<p class="cp">STOP, OR I WILL SINK YOU.</p>

<p><br>
The captain of the Atlantic liner knew all that was known
about the <i>Maria Braganza</i>, and at once realised his
danger. If he did not realise it, there came a shell from the
warship which passed astern. Fortunately, there was a mist on
the water, which grew heavier every minute&mdash;a dense bank of
fog, not usually met with so far east.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Caratana</i> decided upon the course of
action he would take. Very quickly he signalled "I surrender,"
and rang his engines to "stop." The men on the warship seemed
satisfied with his action, and no further demonstration was made
against the liner. Such was the "way" on the big ship that,
although her propellers had ceased to revolve, she continued her
course&mdash;nearer and nearer she grew to a thick patch of the
fog that lay ahead of her. The <i>Maria Braganza</i> may have
suspected the manoeuvre, for she signalled&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="cp">GO ASTERN.</p>

<p></p>
<p>For answer, the captain of the <i>Caratana</i> put port and
starboard engines full ahead, and, whilst men were running to
their stations on the warship, the <i>Caratana</i> slipped into
the fog-belt.</p>

<p>In an instant, the <i>Maria Braganza</i> was blotted from
view.</p>

<p>The liner captain put his helm over to starboard, and it was
well that he did so, for, with a reverberating crash, the
warship opened fire in the direction in which he had
disappeared. Shell after shell came flying through the thick
mist, and the thud of their impact as they struck the water came
to the ears of the affrighted passengers.</p>

<p>The sound of spasmodic firing grew fainter and fainter every
minute as the great steamer went threshing through the swirling
fog, until it ceased altogether.</p>

<p>Although no harm had befallen the liner, the news of the
attack produced a profound sensation. Its effect was to paralyse
the business of ocean travel. The "Mad Warship" terrorised the
seas.</p>

<p>It was on the day the report of this new outrage reached
England that T.B. Smith located Poltavo.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THERE languished in a prosaic prison cell at
Brixton Gaol a Monsieur Torquet, who was admittedly a victim of
police persecution. That much T.B. himself was prepared to
admit.</p>

<p>Monsieur Torquet was suspected not of a crime against any
particular section of society, but indeed of being accessory to
a crime against humanity; and T.B. was prepared to run a tilt at
the very Habeas Corpus Act rather than release his grip upon the
stranger with the straggling beard who had so heavily insured
the <i>Raglan Castle</i> before she started out on her
adventurous voyage. This Monsieur Torquet, brooding in the
loneliness of his cell at Brixton, had very nearly reached the
limits of his patience; the silence and the indifference had
crushed what little spirit there was in him.</p>

<p>For two months he had lain without trial, in a cell which had
a table on which were pen, paper, and ink. He had not in all
that time touched the one or the other, but on the day that the
Atlantic liner came across the <i>Maria Braganza</i> he sat at
the table and wrote a brief note to the governor of the prison.
Within an hour T.B. Smith was ushered into the cell, and
remained with the man for some time. Then he came out, and sent
for a shorthand clerk, and together they returned. For four
hours the three men worked, one questioning and translating, one
answering at first sullenly and with periodic outbursts of
temper, and later eagerly, volubly&mdash;and all this time the
clerk wrote and wrote, until one note-book was exhausted and he
sent out for another.</p>

<p>It was late in the evening when he said:</p>

<p>"And that, monsieur, is all."</p>

<p>"All?" T.B.'s eyebrows rose. "All? But you have not explained
the whereabouts of Lolo?"</p>

<p>The prisoner was frankly puzzled.</p>

<p>"Lolo?" he repeated. "M'sieur, I do not understand."</p>

<p>It was T.B.'s turn to be astonished.</p>

<p>"But the rendezvous&mdash;there was to be some rendezvous
where the ship would come to pick up any member of the Nine who
might become detached."</p>

<p>The man shook his head, and at that moment an idea occurred
to T.B. He drew from his pocket a copy of Baggin's little "cross
with the nobs," as it had been named at Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"Do you know this?" he asked.</p>

<p>The man looked at it, and smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Poltavo drew that for me on the last occasion I
met him in Paris."</p>

<p>"What does it mean?"</p>

<p>Again the prisoner shook his head.</p>

<p>"I do not know," he said simply. "Poltavo was telling me
something of his plans. He drew the cross and was beginning to
explain its meaning, and then for some reason he stopped,
crumpled up the paper, and threw it into the fireplace. At the
time I attached some importance to it, and, after he had gone, I
rescued it, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't understand it?"</p>

<p>"I don't," said the man, and T.B. knew that he spoke the
truth.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap31" name="chap31">XXXI. &mdash; THE
FLIGHT</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT must have been whilst Poltavo was in Paris
that the ruling spirit of the <i>Maria Braganza</i> discovered
that Count Poltavo was indispensable, and that strange
reconciliation occurred. Through what agency Baggin and he came
into touch is not known. It is generally supposed that the
warship ventured close to the French or Spanish coast and sent a
message of good will flickering through space, and that some
receiving station, undiscovered and undemolished&mdash;there
must have been a score of such stations&mdash;received it, and
transmitted it to Poltavo.</p>

<p>News of him came to Smith from Van Ingen, who, following a
faint clue of the Spanish dancer, had gone to Tangier. Work at
the Embassy had become unendurable to him, since the
disappearance of the Nine Men had marked also the disappearance
of Doris, and despite the expostulations of the ambassador, who
was sorely distressed by certain international complications of
the situation&mdash;for both Baggin and Grayson were
Americans&mdash;despite also the detective's blunt advice to let
the business alone and return to the Embassy, Van Ingen had set
forth on his wild-goose chase.</p>

<p>The afternoon of his arrival, he climbed to the Marshan, the
plateau that commands Tangier. Here are villas, in which
Moorish, Spanish, and English styles of architecture, struggling
for supremacy, have compromised in a conglomerate type. And
here, idling along the promenade, scanning every figure as it
passed, he had come face to face with Catherine Dominguez.</p>

<p>At his start of surprise, for he had not expected such good
fortune, the lady paused, uncertainly. The young man uncovered
with a sweeping bow.</p>

<p>"Pardon!" he exclaimed gallantly, in Spanish, "but so often
have I seen the lovely face of the 'Belle Espagnole' in the
newspapers that I recognised it before I was aware!"</p>

<p>Catherine nodded amiably, and, at a word of invitation, Van
Ingen fell into step beside her.</p>

<p>That night he cabled to the detective:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">POLTAVO IN TANGIER. C. DOMINGUEZ WILL SELL
HIS WHEREABOUTS FOR &pound;5,000. VAN INGEN.</p>

<br>

<p>To this he received the laconic reply, "Coming."</p>

<p>The trap which the detective laid, as the Sud Express fled
shrieking through the night, was simple. To capture Count
Poltavo while the "Mad Terror" remained afloat would be
imbecile. But to frighten him by a pseudo-attack out into the
open, and then follow him to the Nine&mdash;Smith smiled over
the common-sense of his little scheme, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>His interview, two mornings later, with Catherine Dominguez
was most amiable&mdash;both ignored their last meeting&mdash;and
satisfactory, save in one small particular. Upon reflection, the
lady had raised her price. For &pound;10,000 she would divulge her
secret. And the detective, after a few protests, acceded to her
demands. After all, she ran a certain risk in betraying a man
like the count. He thought, grimly, of Hyatt and Moss.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the conference, he wrote her a
check.</p>

<p>She shook her head, smiling.</p>

<p>"I should prefer bank-notes," she said gently. Smith appeared
to hesitate. "Very well," he replied finally. "But, in that
case, you must wait until to-morrow. If your information is
good&mdash;the check will be also."</p>

<p>She took it from his hand, and he rose.</p>

<p>"Ver' good, Senor Smit'," she replied, looking up at him with
an engaging smile. "I will trust you." She fingered the paper
absently. Smith looked down at her. Something, he knew, she had
left untold, and he waited.</p>

<p>"One small thing I had almost forgot," she murmured
pensively. "Count Poltavo leaves for &mdash;Lolo&mdash;to-night."</p>

<p>Catherine Dominguez had not lied. Perhaps, she had some
secret grudge against the Nine, whose faithful agent she had
been, or perhaps she was tired of obscure flittings, and wished
to buy indemnity by confession. The detective never knew.
Nevertheless, he felt grateful to her.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THAT night, a slender man, wearing a felt hat
and a <i>cappa</i>, descended the steps of one of the villas of
the Marshan, and walked through the garden.</p>

<p>There was a man standing in the middle of the white road, his
hands in his overcoat pocket, the red glow of his cigar a point
of light in the gloom. Farther away, he saw the figures of three
horsemen.</p>

<p>"Count Poltavo, I suppose," drawled a voice&mdash;the voice
of T.B. Smith. "Put up your hands or you're a dead man."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap32" name="chap32">XXXII. &mdash; POLTAVO LEAVES
HURRIEDLY</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN an instant the road was filled with men;
they must have been crouching in the shadow of the grassy
plateau, but in that same instant Poltavo had leapt back to the
cover of the garden. A revolver banged behind him; and, as he
ran, he snatched his own revolver from his pocket, and sent two
quick shots into the thick of the surrounding circle. There was
another gate at the farther end of the garden; there would be
men there, but he must risk it. He was slight and had some speed
as a runner; he must depend upon these gifts.</p>

<p>He opened the gate swiftly and sprang out. There were three
or four men standing in his path. He shot at one point-blank,
dodged the others, and ran. He judged that his pursuers would
not know the road as well as he. Shot after shot rang out behind
him. He was an easy mark on the white road, and he turned aside
and took to the grass. He was clear of the houses now, and there
was no danger ahead, but the men who followed him were
untiring.</p>

<p>Presently he struck the footpath across the sloping plain
that led to the shore, and the going was easier.</p>

<p>It was his luck that his pursuers should have missed the
path. His every arrangement worked smoothly, for the boat was
waiting, the men at their oars, and he sprang breathlessly into
the stern.</p>

<p>It was a circumstance which might have struck him as strange,
had he been in a condition for calm thought, that the horsemen
who were of the party that surrounded him had not joined in
pursuit.</p>

<p>But there was another mystery that the night revealed. He had
been on board the <i>Doro</i>&mdash;as his little ship was
called&mdash;for an hour before he went to the cabin that had
been made ready for him. His first act was to take his revolver
from his pocket, preparatory to reloading it from the cartridges
stored in one of his trunks.</p>

<p>Two chambers of the pistol were undischarged, and, as he
jerked back the extractor, these two shells fell on the bed. He
looked at them stupidly.</p>

<p>Both cartridges were blank!</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">HAD he heard T.B. Smith speaking as he went
flying down the road, Poltavo might have understood.</p>

<p>"Where's the dead man?" asked T.B.</p>

<p>"Here, sir," said Van Ingen cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Good." Then, in French, he addressed a figure that stood in
the doorway.</p>

<p>"Were you hurt, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>Catherine's little laugh came out to him. "I am quite safe,"
she said quietly. He was going away, but she called him.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand why you allowed him to escape&mdash;"
she began. "That you should desire blank cartridges to be placed
in his revolver is not so difficult, but I do not
see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose not," said T.B. politely, and left her
abruptly.</p>

<p>He sprang onto a horse that was waiting, and went clattering
down the hill, through the Sole, down the narrow main street
that passes the mosque; dismounting by the Custom House, he
placed his horse in charge of a waiting soldier, and walked
swiftly along the narrow wooden pier. At the same time as the
count was boarding the <i>Doro</i>, T.B. and Van Ingen were
being rowed in a cockleshell of a pinnace to the long destroyer
which lay, without lights, in the bay.</p>

<p>They swung themselves up a tiny ladder onto the steel deck
that rang hollow under their feet.</p>

<p>"All right?" said a voice in the darkness.</p>

<p>"All right," said T.B.; a bell tinkled somewhere, the
destroyer moved slowly ahead, and swung out to sea.</p>

<p>"Will you have any difficulty in picking her up?" He was
standing in the cramped space of the little bridge, wedged
between a quick-firing gun and the navigation desk.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I think not," said the officer; "&mdash;our
difficulty will be to keep out of sight of her. It will be an
easy matter to keep her in view, because she stands high out of
the water, and she is pretty sure to burn her regulation lights.
By day I shall let her get hull down and take her masts for
guide."</p>

<p>It was the strangest procession that followed the southern
bend of the African coast. First went the <i>Doro</i>, its
passengers serenely unconscious of the fact that six miles away,
below the rim of the horizon, followed a slim ugly destroyer
that did not once lose sight of the <i>Doro</i>'s mainmast;
behind the destroyer, and three miles distant, came six
destroyers steaming abreast. Behind them, four miles away, six
swift cruisers.</p>

<p>That same night, there steamed from Funchal in the Island of
Madeira, the <i>Victor Hugo</i>, <i>Cond&eacute;</i>, <i>Gloire</i>,
and the <i>Edgard Quinet</i> of the French Fleet; the
<i>Roon</i>, <i>Yorck</i>, <i>Prinz Adalbert</i>, and the
battleship <i>Pommern</i> of the German Navy, with sixteen
destroyers, and followed a parallel ocean path.</p>

<p>After three days' steaming, the <i>Doro</i> turned sharply to
starboard, and the unseen fleets that dogged her turned too. In
that circle of death, for a whole week, the little Spanish
steamer twisted and turned, and, obedient to the message that
went from destroyer to cruiser, the fleets followed her every
movement. For the <i>Doro</i> was unconsciously leading the
nations to the "Mad Battleship." She had been slipped with that
object. So far every part of the plan had worked well. To make
doubly sure, the news of Zillier's escape from Devil's Island
had been circulated in every country. It was essential that, if
they missed the <i>Maria Braganza</i> this time, they should
catch her on the first of June at "Lolo."</p>

<p>"And where that is," said T.B., in despair, "Heaven only
knows."</p>

<p>Wearing a heavy overcoat, he was standing on the narrow deck
of the destroyer as she pounded through the seas. They had found
the southeast trade winds at a surprisingly northerly latitude,
and the sea was choppy and cold.</p>

<p>Young Marchcourt, the youthful skipper of the <i>Martine</i>,
grinned.</p>

<p>"'Lolo' is 'nowhere,' isn't it?" he said. "You'll find it
charted on all Admiralty maps; it's the place where the supply
transport is always waiting on manoeuvres&mdash;I wish to Heaven
these squalls would drop," he added irritably, as a sudden gust
of wind and rain struck the tiny ship.</p>

<p>"Feel seasick?" suggested T.B. maliciously.</p>

<p>"Not much&mdash;but I'm horribly afraid of losing sight of
this Looker-ahead."</p>

<p>He lifted the flexible end of a speaking-tube, and pressed a
button.</p>

<p>"Give her a few more revolutions, Cole," he said. He hung up
the tube. "We look like carrying this weather with us for a few
days," he said, "and, as I don't feel competent to depend
entirely upon my own eyesight, I shall bring up the
<i>Magneto</i> and the <i>Solus</i> to help me watch this
beggar."</p>

<p>Obedient to signal, two destroyers were detached from the
following flotilla, and came abreast at dusk.</p>

<p>The weather grew rapidly worse, the squalls of greater
frequence. The sea rose, so that life upon the destroyer was
anything but pleasant. At midnight, T.B. Smith was awakened from
a restless sleep by a figure in gleaming oilskins.</p>

<p>"I say," said a gloomy voice, "we've lost sight of that
dashed <i>Doro</i>."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>T.B. jumped from his bunk, to be immediately precipitated
against the other side of the cabin.</p>

<p>"Lost her light&mdash;it has either gone out or been put out.
We're going ahead now full speed in the hope of overhauling
her&mdash;"</p>

<p>Another oilskinned figure came to the door.</p>

<p>"Light ahead, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" said the other fervently, and bolted to the
deck.</p>

<p>T.B. struggled into his clothing, and, with some difficulty,
made his way to the bridge. Van Ingen was already before him. As
he climbed the little steel ladder, he heard the engine-bell
ring, and instantly the rattle and jar of the engines
ceased.</p>

<p>"She's stationary," explained the officer," so we've stopped.
She has probably upset herself in this sea."</p>

<p>"How do you know she is stationary?" asked T.B., for the two
faint stars ahead told him nothing.</p>

<p>"Got her riding lights," said the other laconically.</p>

<p>Those two riding lights stopped the destroyer; it stopped six
other destroyers, far out of sight, six obedient cruisers came
to a halt, and, a hundred miles or so away, the combined French
and German fleets became stationary.</p>

<p>All through the night the watchers lay, heaving, rolling, and
pitching, like so many logs, on the troubled seas. Dawn broke
mistily, but the lights still gleamed. Day came in dull
greyness, and the young officer, with his eyes fastened to his
binoculars, looked long and earnestly ahead.</p>

<p>"I can see a mast," he said doubtfully, "but there's
something very curious about it." Then he put down his glasses
suddenly, put out his hand, and rang his engines full ahead.</p>

<p>He turned to the quartermaster at his side.</p>

<p>"Get the Commodore by wireless," he said rapidly; "the
<i>Doro</i> has gone." Gone, indeed, was the
<i>Doro</i>&mdash;gone six hours since.</p>

<p>They found the lights. They were still burning when the
destroyer came up with them. A roughly built raft with a pole
lashed upright, and from this was suspended two lanterns. Whilst
the fleet had watched this raft, the <i>Doro</i> had gone on.
Nailed to the pole was a letter. It was sodden with spray, but
T.B. had no difficulty in reading it.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"Cher ami," it ran, "much as I value the
honour of a naval escort, its presence is embarrassing at the
moment. I saw your destroyer this morning through my glasses,
and guessed the rest. You are ingenious. Now I understand why
you allowed me to escape.</p>

<p class="letter">"My respectful salutations to you, oh, most
admirable of policemen!"</p>

<p>It was signed, "<span class="smcap">Poltavo</span>."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE court-martial held on Lieutenant-Commander
George Septimus Marchcourt, on a charge of "neglect of duty, in
that he failed to carry out the instructions of his superior
officer," resulted in an honourable acquittal for that cheerful
young officer. It was an acquittal which had a far-reaching
effect, though at the time it did not promise well.</p>

<p>T.B. was a witness at the trial, which was a purely formal
one, in spite of the attention it excited.</p>

<p>He remained at Gibraltar, pending further developments. For
the affair of the Nine Men had got beyond Scotland
Yard&mdash;they were an international problem.</p>

<p>T.B. was walking over from La Linea, across the strip of
neutral ground which separated Gibraltar from Spain, with Van
Ingen, when he confessed that he despaired of ever bringing the
Nine to justice.</p>

<p>"The nations cannot stand the racket much longer," he said;
"these Nine Men are costing civilisation a million a week! Think
of it! A million pounds a week! We must either capture them soon
or effect a compromise. I am afraid they will make peace on
their own terms."</p>

<p>"But they must be caught soon," urged the other.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded T.B. irritably. "How can we hope to capture
one of the fastest war vessels afloat when the men who control
her have all the seas to run in?"</p>

<p>They had reached the water-port, and T.B. stopped before his
hotel.</p>

<p>"Come in," he said suddenly. The two men passed through the
paved vestibule and mounted the stair to T.B.'s room. "I'm going
to look again at our clue," he said grimly, and extracted from
his portfolio the drawing of the little cross with the circular
ends.</p>

<p>T.B. himself does not know to this day why he was moved to
produce this disappointing little diagram at that moment. It may
have been that, as a forlorn hope, he relied upon the
application of a fresh young mind to the problem which was so
stale in his, for Van Ingen had never seen the diagram.</p>

<p>He looked and frowned.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" he asked, without disguising his
disappointment.</p>

<p>"That is all," responded T.B.</p>

<p>They sat looking at the diagram in silence. Van Ingen, as was
his peculiarity, scribbled mechanically on the blotting pad
before him. He drew flowers, and men's heads, and impossible
structures of all kinds; he made inaccurate tracings of maps, of
columns, pediments, squares, and triangles. Then, in the same
absent way, he made a rough copy of the diagram.</p>

<p>Then his pencil stopped and he sat bolt upright.</p>

<p>"Gee!" he whispered.</p>

<p>The detective looked up in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Van Ingen. "Have you got an atlas,
Smith?"</p>

<p>The detective took one from his trunk. Van Ingen turned the
leaves, looked long and earnestly at something he saw, closed
the book, and turned a little white, but his eyes were
blazing.</p>

<p>"I have found 'Lolo,'" he said simply.</p>

<p>He took up his pencil and quickly sketched the
diagram:</p><br>

<div align="center"> <img alt="Illustration"
src="1203531h-images/TheNineBears-6a.gif" title="Baggin sprang at him
with an oath..."> </div><br>

<p>"Look," he said, and added a few letters:</p><br>

<div align="center"> <img alt="Illustration"
src="1203531h-images/TheNineBears-6b.gif" title="Diagram 2"> </div><br>

<p>"Longitude, nought; latitude nought&mdash;L.0, L.0!"
whispered the detective. "You've hit it, Van Ingen! By Jove!
Why, that is off the African coast."</p>

<p>He looked again at the map.</p>

<p>"It is where the Greenwich meridian crosses the Equator," he
said. "It's 'nowhere'! The only 'nowhere' in the world!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap33" name="chap33">XXXIII. &mdash; AT
"LOLO"</a></h2>

<p class="first">UNDER an awning on the quarter-deck of the
<i>Maria Braganza</i>, George T. Baggin was stretched out in the
easiest of easy-chairs in an attitude of luxurious comfort.</p>

<p>Admiral Lombrosa, passing on his way to his cabin, smacked
him familiarly upon the shoulder&mdash;an attitude which
epitomised the changed relationships of the pair.</p>

<p>The <i>Maria Braganza</i> was steaming slowly eastward, and,
since it was the hour of siesta, the deck was strewn with the
recumbent forms of men. Baggin looked up with a scowl.</p>

<p>"Where is Poltavo?" he asked, and the other laughed.</p>

<p>"He sleeps, Senor Presidente," said the
"Admiral."&mdash;There had been some curious promotions on board
the <i>Maria Braganza</i>.&mdash;" He is amusing, your
count."</p>

<p>Baggin wriggled uncomfortably in his chair, but made no
answer, and the other man eyed him keenly.</p>

<p>Baggin must have felt rather than observed the scrutiny, for
suddenly he looked up and caught the sailor's eye.</p>

<p>"Eh?" he asked, as though to some unspoken question. Then,
"Where is Grayson?"</p>

<p>Again the smile on the swart face of the Brazilian.</p>

<p>"He is here," he said, as a stout figure in white ducks
shuffled awkwardly along the canting deck. He came opposite to
Baggin; and, drawing a chair towards him with a grunt, he
dropped into it with a crash.</p>

<p>"You grow fatter, my friend," said Baggin.</p>

<p>"Fatter!" gasped the other. "Of course I'm fatter! No
exercise&mdash;this cursed ship! Oh, what a fool, what a fool
I've been!"</p>

<p>"Forget it," said Baggin. He took a long gold case from his
inside pocket, opened it, and selected with care a black
cheroot. "Forget it."</p>

<p>"I wish I could! I'd give half-a-million to be safe in the
hands of the Official Receiver! I'd give half-a-million to be
serving five years in Sing Sing! Baggin," he said, with comic
earnestness, "we've got to compromise! It's got to be done.
Where do we stand, eh?"</p>

<p>Baggin puffed leisurely at his cigar, but made no attempt to
elucidate the position. He was used to all this; but now, with
his nerves on edge, this cowardice of Grayson's grated.</p>

<p>"Where are the Nine Men of Cadiz?" demanded Grayson, the
sweat rolling down his cheeks. "Where is Bortuski? Where is
Morson? Where is Couthwright? Zillier, we know where he is, or
was, but where are the others? You and me and Count Poltavo and
the rest&mdash;phutt!" He made a little noise with his
mouth. "I know!" he said. He raised a trembling finger
accusingly.</p>

<p>"My dear man," said Baggin lazily, though his face was white
and his lips firm-pressed. "There was the storm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" screamed Grayson, beating the air with his
hands; "&mdash;that's a lie! The storm didn't take Kohr from his
bunk and leave blood on his pillow! It didn't make Morson's
cabin smell of chloroform! I know, I know!"</p>

<p>"There is such a thing as knowing too much," said George T.
Baggin, rising unsteadily. "Grayson," he said, "I've been a good
friend of yours because I sort of like you in spite of your
foolishness. Our friends perished in the storm; it wasn't a bad
thing for us, taking matters all round. If this manifesto of
ours doesn't secure us a pardon, we can risk making a run for
safety. There are fewer of us to blab. See here&mdash;"</p>

<p>He sat down on the side of the other's chair and dropped his
voice&mdash;"suppose we can't shock this old world into giving
us a free pardon, and the sun gets too warm for us, as it will
sooner or later&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Suppose it!" Grayson burst in. "Do you think there's an hour
of the day or night when I don't suppose it? Lord! I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen, can't you?" said Baggin savagely.</p>

<p>"When that happens, what are we to do? We've buried gold on
the African coast; we've buried it on the South American
coast&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All the crew know. We're at the mercy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait, wait!" said the other wearily. "Suppose there comes a
time when we must make a dash for safety&mdash;with the steam
pinnace. Slipping away in the night when the men of the watch
are doped. You and your daughter, and me, Poltavo, and the
Admiral"&mdash;he bent his head lower&mdash;"leaving a time-fuse
in the magazine," he whispered. "There's a way out for us, my
friend! We are going to make one last effort," he went on.
"Between here and 'Lolo' we fall in with the outward-bound,
intermediate Cape mail. It shall be our last attack upon
civilisation."</p>

<p>"Don't do it!" begged Grayson; "&mdash;for the love of
Heaven, don't do it, Baggin!"</p>

<p>He got upon his feet, pallid and staring. His hand was
clapped over his heart, and his breath came in thick, stertorous
gasps. Doris appeared around the corner, walking with Count
Poltavo. She came forward swiftly.</p>

<p>"Come, father!" she said, and led him, unresisting, away.</p>

<p>They ate a silent meal in the magnificently upholstered
ward-room, which had been converted into a saloon for the officers
of the "Mad Battleship."</p>

<p>After dinner, Count Poltavo and Baggin promenaded the
quarter-deck together.</p>

<p>"Grayson has gone below," reported the count, in answer to a
question of his companion. "He got no sleep last night."</p>

<p>"He is a greater danger than any of the others," said
Baggin.</p>

<p>They stood for awhile, watching the phosphorescence on the
water, till Lombrosa's voice recalled them.</p>

<p>"Are you there?" he called quickly. They detected the
agitation in his tone and turned together.</p>

<p>"It's Grayson," said the captain rapidly. "I found him in the
wireless cabin, trying to send a message. He's half-mad."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" demanded the count; but, before his tongue had
formed the words, the voice of the fat man came to him. He came
along, the centre of a swaying body of sailors, who held
him.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, silence him!" said the Brazilian hoarsely.
"Don't you hear?"</p>

<p>"Dead! you'll all be dead!" yelled Grayson. He was screaming
at the top of his voice in English. "A time-fuse in your
magazine! whilst they get away with the money!"</p>

<p>At any moment he might remember that the Brazilians who held
him could not understand a word he said.</p>

<p>Poltavo gave an order, and the struggling man was flung to
the deck.</p>

<p>"Murder!" he screamed. "Hyatt, and the other man! And poor
Morson and Kohr. I see the blood on his pillow! and a time-fuse
in the magazine&mdash;"</p>

<p>Baggin thrust a handkerchief in his mouth.</p>

<p>"Chloroform," he said in Spanish. "Our friend has been
drinking." In a few seconds, the captain was back with a bottle
of colourless liquid, and a saturated handkerchief was pressed
over the struggling man's mouth.</p>

<p>He was silent at last, and, at a word from their captain, the
men who held him released their hold, and went forward to their
quarters. The captain discreetly followed them.</p>

<p>The two men stood in silence, gazing down at the huddled
figure. Then, "He must go," said Baggin.</p>

<p>Poltavo was silent a moment.</p>

<p>"No," he said finally, "I do not agree."</p>

<p>Baggin regarded him blackly.</p>

<p>"I see your point," he said, with biting emphasis. "With the
others"&mdash;he wet his dry lips&mdash;" you cast the black
vote fast enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>The count elevated his eyebrows. "Why refer to such things?"
he objected mildly. "If they be necessary&mdash;do them, swiftly
and well&mdash;but be silent, even as Nature is silent. For Mr.
Grayson, he is&mdash;how you say&mdash;a very sick man.
Perhaps&mdash;" He shrugged his shoulders and did not finish the
sentence.</p>

<p>He bent down to the unconscious man.</p>

<p>"Lend a hand," he said quietly to Baggin. The American
obeyed, sullenly, and, between them, they half supported, half
carried Grayson to his cabin.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap34" name="chap34">XXXIV. &mdash; THE LAST OF THE
NINE</a></h2>

<p class="first">To a calm sea, to a dawn all pearl and rose,
the crew of the <i>Maria Braganza</i> woke. In the night, the
speed of the warship had been accelerated until she was moving
at her top speed, and two columns of black smoke belched from
her great funnels. The two men who came on deck at the same
moment did not speak one to the other. Baggin was pale; there
were dark circles about his eyes; he looked like a man who had
not slept. But Count Poltavo was unperturbed.</p>

<p>Clear-eyed, shaven, not unusually pallid, he woke as from a
pleasant dream, and appeared on deck immaculate from point of
shoe to finger-nail.</p>

<p>All the morning preparations were going on. Ammunition came
up from the magazine, dilatory quartermasters swung out guns; on
the mast-head was an under-officer armed with a telescope.</p>

<p>He was the principal object of interest to the men on the
quarter-deck. Every few minutes their eyes would go sweeping
aloft.</p>

<p>Beyond the curtest salutations, neither the captain, Baggin,
nor the calm Poltavo spoke. In Baggin's heart grew a new terror,
and he avoided the count.</p>

<p>The sun beat down on the stretch of awning that protected the
privileged three, but, for some reason, Baggin did not feel the
heat. He had a something on his mind; a question to ask; and at
last he summoned his resolution to put it. He walked over to
where the count sat reading.</p>

<p>"Ivan," he said&mdash;he had never so addressed him
before&mdash;"is the end near?"</p>

<p>The count had raised his clear eyes when the other had come
toward him; he smiled.</p>

<p>"Which variety of end?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There is only one variety," said Baggin steadily. "There is
only one thing in the world that counts, and that is life."</p>

<p>"Not money?" asked the Russian, with a faint, ironical
smile.</p>

<p>"Not money," repeated Baggin. "Least of all, money&mdash;but
life!"</p>

<p>Poltavo arose. He had seen the flutter of a white skirt at
the far end of the promenade-deck.</p>

<p>"Life," he said, with soft deliberateness, "is the least of
all gifts, my friend. It is of no more consequence than the
crystal of snow which is lost in the foul mud beneath our feet,
or the drop of dew which is burned up by the ardent rays of the
sun." He turned upon his heel.</p>

<p>The American plucked at his sleeve. "Then, what counts?" he
demanded hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Nothing!" There was a certain mysticism in the count's
gentle smile. "We are bewildered guests. Listen to the words of
one of your own great countrymen." He quoted in a musical voice,
looking out across the water:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
I was not asked if I should like to come,<br>
I have not seen my host here since I came,<br>
Or had a word of welcome in his name.<br>
Some say that we shall never see him, and some<br>
That we shall see him elsewhere, and then know<br>
Why we were bid.</p>

<br>

<p>"For myself"&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders with an
expressive gesture&mdash;"it does not matter. I have been well
<i>amus&eacute;</i>." He strolled forward. Doris, dressed all in white,
was leaning against the rail. She drank in the fresh morning air
eagerly. The wind had brought a faint tinge of colour to her
cheeks, and the blue ribbon which she had bound about her hair
to protect it from the ravages of the wind lent her an air
almost of gaiety, which the count was not slow to observe.</p>

<p>"It is a glorious day," he said cheerfully. "And your father
is better. I can read the good news in your face."</p>

<p>He ranged himself beside her, his back against the rail, so
that his eyes took in every aspect of her face and figure.</p>

<p>"He is asleep," she returned in a low voice, "and so I
ventured out for a breath of fresh air. He
was&mdash;delirious&mdash;through the night."</p>

<p>He looked at her reproachfully. "And you watched with him all
night?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"You might, at least, have permitted me to divide the time
with you."</p>

<p>The girl was silent.</p>

<p>"Is he alone&mdash;now?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>A certain quality in his tones made her glance up
swiftly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think so," she faltered. "There
is&mdash;danger?"</p>

<p>"It is just as well to have a guard," he said drily. "In case
the&mdash;ah!&mdash;delirium should return."</p>

<p>He beckoned to one of the sailors, and spoke to him in
Spanish.</p>

<p>As the man retreated, she turned to him, her blue eyes
swimming in a bright mist of tears.</p>

<p>"You are very good!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," he said simply. "Will you come up on the
hurricane-deck? I have a desire for wide sweeps&mdash;great
distances to-day."</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>"Your father is safe," he urged. "I have set two men at his
door. And I have something to say to you."</p>

<p>"I also have something to say to you," she answered, with a
queer little laugh.</p>

<p>They did not speak again until he had placed her in a
luxurious steamer-chair, protected from the rays of the sun by a
gay striped awning, and seated himself beside her.</p>

<p>Doris folded her hands in her lap, and gazed across the
shimmering water. Slowly her eyes came back, and rested upon the
figure beside her. She drew from about her neck a slender gold
chain, from which depended a locket, and a ring, set quaintly
with a ruby.</p>

<p>"Count Poltavo," she said, in a low, clear tone, "do you
remember giving me this ring?"</p>

<p>"Yes." His face had paled slightly, and a light came into his
eyes.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and the pledge which I made you then?"</p>

<p>"I recall no pledge, dear lady."</p>

<p>She gave him a wide, deep look.</p>

<p>"I bound myself to answer any question you should wish to
ask&mdash;if you should save my father from Mr. Baggin.
Yesterday, that came to pass. During a lucid interval in the
night, my father"&mdash;her voice quivered on the
word&mdash;"spoke of you, but brokenly, and I did not completely
understand until you set the guard about his door."</p>

<p>The count made as if to speak, but she raised a protesting
hand. "So now you have fulfilled your pledge to me, and I
"&mdash;she lifted her head proudly&mdash;"stand ready to redeem
mine."</p>

<p>He looked at her strangely. "You would marry me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Her lips articulated the word with difficulty. Her eyes were
upon her hands, and her hands plaited nervously a fold of her
white gown.</p>

<p>"Doris!" He laid a hand over the slim white fingers. She
shrank back, and then suffered her hand to lie in his,
passively.</p>

<p>"Look up, child," he urged gently. "Let me see your
eyes."</p>

<p>She closed them tightly. A warm tear splashed upon his
hand.</p>

<p>Count Poltavo was very white, but he smiled.</p>

<p>"Do you weep," he said softly, "because you have given
yourself to me? Or because you do not love me?"</p>

<p>The tears fell faster.</p>

<p>He took both her hands. "Dear lady," he said, "let our hearts
speak only true words to-day. You have already chosen a
mate&mdash;is it not true?"</p>

<p>She sat mute, but a burning flush betrayed her.</p>

<p>The count rose suddenly to his feet, and made his way blindly
to the rail. When he returned, a few moments later, his face was
tranquil and serene. "I have put my question," he said lightly,
"and you have answered it&mdash;with a blush! Let us drop the
poor unfortunate subject into oblivion."</p>

<p>She took a long deep breath, as if throwing off the weight of
a weary burden. "I am free?" she whispered.</p>

<p>He laughed somewhat harshly. "As free as a bird," he
retorted, "to fly whither you will."</p>

<p>She did not answer, but unthreaded the ring, with trembling
fingers, and handed it to him without a word.</p>

<p>He drew back, shaking his head. "Will you honour me by
keeping it as a memento of your&mdash;ah!&mdash;freedom? To
think upon, in happier days?"</p>

<p>"I will keep it," she said softly, "in memory of a man whom I
could wish to love!" A silence fell between them, which the girl
presently broke.</p>

<p>"You also had something to tell me?" she said.</p>

<p>He roused himself. "It is true&mdash;I had almost forgot!" He
stopped and looked about them, as if to reassure himself that
they were quite alone.</p>

<p>"Your father is very ill," he began, "too ill to receive
proper attention aboard this ship. I have decided,
therefore,"&mdash;he lowered his voice to a whisper&mdash;"to
transfer him, as soon as he is able, to the first steamer we
meet. It can be arranged, quite simply, with assumed names. You
will take him to some quiet place, and, when he is quite
restored, return with him to America."</p>

<p>The light of a great hope shone in her eyes.</p>

<p>Impulsively, she bent down, and touched his hand with her
lips. "I can never, never repay you!" she murmured.</p>

<p>He rose smiling. From where he stood, the man in the mainmast
was visible. He was shouting to somebody on the bridge, and
pointing northward.</p>

<p>The count deftly interposed himself between the girl and the
sea.</p>

<p>"You can repay me," he said slowly, "by returning at once
with me to your father's state-room, and promising to remain
there until I come or send some one for you."</p>

<p>She looked up at him, startled, and the blood ebbed from her
cheeks, leaving them ashen, but she asked no question, and he
escorted her gravely to her father's cabin.</p>

<p>When he came again on deck, Baggin pointed triumphantly
toward the north. "We make our final appeal to the world!" he
cried.</p>

<p>It came reluctantly into view, a big grey-painted steamer
with red-and-black funnels, a great, lumbering ocean beast.</p>

<p>Through their glasses the three men watched her, a puzzled
frown upon the captain's face.</p>

<p>"I do not recognise her," he said, "but she looks like a
gigantic cargo steamer."</p>

<p>"Her decks are crowded with passengers," said Baggin. "I can
see women's hats and men in white; what is that structure
forward?" He indicated a long superstructure before the
steamer's bridge.</p>

<p>"There goes her flag."</p>

<p>A little ball crept up to the mainmast.</p>

<p>"We will show her ours," said the captain pleasantly, and
pushed a button.</p>

<p>Instantly, with a crash that shook the ship, the forward gun
of the <i>Maria Braganza</i> sent a shell whizzing through the
air.</p>

<p>It fell short and wide of the steamer. The captain turned to
Poltavo, as for instructions.</p>

<p>"Sink her," said the count briefly.</p>

<p>But the steamer was never sunk.</p>

<p>The little ball that hung at the main suddenly broke, and out
to the breeze there floated not the red ensign of the merchant
service, but the Stars and Stripes of America&mdash;more, on the
little flag-staff at the bow of the ship fluttered a tiny blue
flag spangled with stars.</p>

<p>Livid of face, Captain Lombrosa sprang to the wheel.</p>

<p>"It's a Yankee man-o'-war!" he cried, and his voice was
cracked. "We've&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he spoke the superstructure on the "intermediate," which
had excited the count's curiosity, fell apart like a house of
canvas&mdash;as it was&mdash;and the long slim barrel of a
nine-inch gun swung round.</p>

<p><i>"Bang!"</i></p>

<p>The shell carried away a boat and a part of the wireless
cabin.</p>

<p>"Every gun!" yelled Lombrosa, frantically pressing the
buttons on the bridge before him.</p>

<p>"We must run for it!"</p>

<p>Instantly, with an ear-splitting succession of crashes, the
guns of the <i>Maria Braganza</i> came into action.</p>

<p>To the last, fortune was with the Nine, for the second or
third shot sent the American over with a list to starboard.</p>

<p>Round swung the <i>Maria Braganza</i> like a frightened hare;
the water foamed under her bows as, running under every ounce of
steam, she made her retreat.</p>

<p>"We must drop all idea of picking up Zillier," said Baggin,
white to the lips; "this damned warship is probably in wireless
communication with a fleet; can you tap her messages?"</p>

<p>Poltavo shook his head.</p>

<p>"The first shell smashed our apparatus," he said. "What is
that ahead?"</p>

<p>Lombrosa, with his telescope glued to his eye, was scanning
the horizon.</p>

<p>"It looks like a sea fog."</p>

<p>But the captain made no reply.</p>

<p>Over the edge of the ocean hung a thin red haze. He put the
glass down, and turned a troubled face to the two men.</p>

<p>"In other latitudes I should say that it was a gathering
typhoon," he said. He took another long look, put down the
telescope, closed it mechanically, and hung it in the rack.</p>

<p>"Smoke," he said briefly. "We are running into a fleet."</p>

<p>He brought the <i>Maria Braganza</i>'s bows northward, but
the smoke haze was there, too. East, north, south, west, a great
circle of smoke and the <i>Maria Braganza</i> trapped in the
very centre.</p>

<p>Out of the smoke haze grey shadowy shapes, dirty grey hulls,
white hulls, hulls black as pitch, loomed into view.</p>

<p>The captain rang his engines to "stop."</p>

<p>"We are caught," he said.</p>

<p>He opened a locker on the bridge leisurely, and took out a
revolver.</p>

<p>"I have no regrets," he said&mdash;it was a challenge to
fate.</p>

<p>Then he shot himself and fell dead at the feet of the two.
Baggin sprang forward, but too late.</p>

<p>"You coward!" he screamed. He shook his fist in the dead
man's face, then he turned like a wild beast on Poltavo. "This
is the end of it! This is the end of your scheme! Curse you!
Curse you!"</p>

<p>He leapt at the Russian's throat.</p>

<p>For a moment they swayed and struggled, then suddenly Baggin
released his hold, dropped his head like a tired man, and slid
to the deck.</p>

<p>Count Poltavo flung the knife overboard, and lit a cigarette
with a hand that did not tremble.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">ONE last expiring effort the <i>Maria
Braganza</i> made; you could almost follow Poltavo, as he sped
from one side of the ship to the other, by the spasmodic shots
that came from the doomed ship.</p>

<p>Then four men-of-war detached themselves from the encircling
fleets and steamed in toward the Brazilian. Shell after shell
beat upon the steel hull of the "Mad Battleship," a great hole
gaped in her side, her funnels were shot away, her foremast hung
limply.</p>

<p>A white flag waved feebly from her bridge, and a British
destroyer came with a swift run across the smoky seas.</p>

<p>Up the companion-ladder came a rush of marines; and, after
them, a revolver in his hand, T.B. Smith, a prosaic
Assistant-Commissioner from Scotland Yard, and Van Ingen.</p>

<p>T.B. came upon the count standing with his back to a
bulkhead, grimy&mdash;bloodstained, but with the butt of a
cigarette still glowing in the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>"You are Count Ivan Poltavo," said T.B., and snapped a pair
of handcuffs on his wrists. "I shall take you into custody on a
charge of wilful murder, and I caution you that what you now say
may be used in evidence against you at your trial."</p>

<p>The count laughed, though faintly.</p>

<p>"You come, as ever, a bit late, my friend." He flung
overboard a tiny phial, which he had held concealed in his hand.
He turned to Van Ingen.</p>

<p>"You will find Miss Grayson in the cabin with her father, who
is dying. For him, also, Mr. Smith comes a trifle too late."</p>

<p>He staggered backward.</p>

<p>Van Ingen and the detective sprang to his support.</p>

<p>The marines had gathered about in an awe-struck circle.</p>

<p>A slight foam gathered upon the count's lips.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"It grows dark," he whispered. "Good-night, gentlemen!"</p>

<p>He stiffened himself suddenly, and stood boldly erect, gazing
past the circle of men.</p>

<p>"Vive Poltavo!" he cried, in a loud, clear voice, and fell
backward into their arms.</p>
