  <h2><a id="chap01"
     name="chap01">I. &mdash; ECLIPSE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MEN who think in millions, usually pay in installments, but
  this was not the case with Silinski, who had a mind for small things, and
  between whiles, when mighty financial schemes were not occupying the screen,
  had time to work out his landlady's bill and detect the altogether fallacious
  addition of&mdash;</p>
  <pre>
                 3 pesetas 25 centimos
                 4   "     50    "
              as 8 pesetas 75 centimos
</pre>

  <p>He might, indeed, have hailed from Andalusia as did the Se&ntilde;ora with her
  thrifty additions and her buxom red and white and black beauty, for he
  counted his pennies carefully and never received a duoro without testing it
  with his teeth.</p>

  <p>He was a tall man with a stoop, and dressed invariably in black, which is
  the colour of Spain. Seeing him, on windy days, when bleak, icy air-streams
  poured down from the circling Sierras, and made life in Madrid insupportable,
  you might have marked him down as a Spaniard. His black felt hat and his
  velvet-lined <i>cappa</i> with its high collar would show him to be such from
  a distance, whilst nearer at hand, his long, melancholy face, with a thin
  nose that drooped over a trim black moustache slightly upturned, would
  confirm the distant impression. He spoke Spanish fluently, and affected a
  blazing diamond ring&mdash;such as a well-to-do Spaniard would delight
  in.</p>

  <p>Silinski was, in fact, a Pole, and had been for many years a patriot,
  finding the calling lucrative.</p>

  <p>Of all the bad men of whose history I have knowledge, or whose
  acquaintance I have made, none more than Silinski looked the part.</p>

  <p>He was the transpontine villain to the life, and is the only instance I
  can recall of such a creature. He was in appearance so clever, so cunning, so
  snake-like, suave, and well-mannered, that men, and not a few women, trusted
  him from sheer perversity, reasoning, no doubt, that no man who looked so
  utterly untrustworthy could be anything but good at bottom. Reflecting on the
  bad men I have known, I enter into the spirit of the reasoning. Jan Muller
  was benevolent of face, with a kindly eye that twinkled behind gold-rimmed
  spectacles&mdash;yet Muller's record is known, and for the five murders that
  were brought home to him, a score were undiscovered. Bawker had the face of a
  clown, a weak, good-natured clown, with his loose lip and the puckered eyes
  of a lover of good living&mdash;Bawker was a cold-hearted murderer. Agma
  Cymon&mdash;I doubt if that was his real name&mdash;was a cold severe, just
  man, infinitely precise and methodical; a mean man who would fight over a
  penny, and who invariably had his clothing patched, and his shoes re-soled,
  yet Cymon's defalcations amounted to &pound;127,000, and the bulk of the money went
  to the upkeep of an establishment over which the beautiful Madame
  Carron-Setter presided.</p>

  <p>Silinski looked what he was, yet people did not shake their heads over
  him. Either they received him in their homes, and some, more intimately
  acquainted, joked with him on his Mephistophelian ensemble.</p>

  <p>Silinski came to Burgos, from Madrid, by an excursion train that travelled
  all night, yet he was the trimmest and most alert of the crowd which thronged
  the Callo do Vitoria, a crowd made up of peasants, tourists, and
  soldiers.</p>

  <p>He made slow progress, for the crowd grew thicker in the vicinity of the
  Casa del Cordon, where the loyal country-folk waited patiently for a glimpse
  of their King.</p>

  <p>Silinski stood for a little while looking up at the expressionless windows
  of the Casa, innocent of curtain, but strangely clean. He speculated on the
  value of life&mdash;of royal life.</p>

  <p>"If I were to kill the King," he mused, "Europe would dissolve into one
  big shudder. If, being dead, I came forward offering to restore him to life
  for fifty million francs the money would be instantly forthcoming on the
  proof of my ability. Yet were I to go now to the King's minister
  saying&mdash;'It is easy for me to kill the King, but if you will give me the
  money you would spend on his obsequies. I will stay my hand,' I should be
  kicked out, arrested, and possibly confined as a lunatic."</p>

  <p>He nodded his head slowly, and as he turned away he took a little notebook
  from his pocket, and inscribed&mdash;"The greatest of miracles is self-
  restraint." Then he rolled a cigarette and walked slowly back to the Cafe
  Suiso in the Espollon.</p>

  <p>A clean-shaven priest, with a thin, intellectual face, was stirring his
  coffee at one of the tables, and since this was the least occupied Silinski
  made for it. He raised his hat to the priest and sat down.</p>

  <p>"I apologize for intruding myself, father," he said, "but the other
  tables&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The priest smiled and raised a protesting hand.</p>

  <p>"The table is at your disposition, my son," he said.</p>

  <p>He was about the same age as Silinski, but he spoke with the assurance of
  years. Silinski noted that the priest's voice was modulated, his accent
  refined, his presence that of a gentleman.</p>

  <p>"A Jesuit," thought Silinski, and regarded him with politely veiled
  curiosity. Jesuits had a fascination for him. They were clever, and they were
  good; but principally they were a mysterious force that rode triumphant over
  the prejudice of the world and the hatred in the Church.</p>

  <p>"If I were not an adventurer," he said aloud, and with that air of
  simplicity which ever proved to be his most valuable asset, "I should be a
  Jesuit."</p>

  <p>The priest smiled again, looking at Silinski with calm interest.</p>

  <p>"My son," he said, "if I were not a Jesuit priest, I should be suspicious
  of your well-simulated frankness."</p>

  <p>Here would have come a deadlock to a man of lesser parts than Silinski,
  but he was a very adaptable man. None the less, he was surprised into a laugh
  which showed his white teeth.</p>

  <p>"In Spain," he said, "no gambit to conversation is known. I might have
  spoken of the weather, of the crowd, of the King&mdash;I chose to voice my
  faults."</p>

  <p>The priest shook his head, still smiling.</p>

  <p>"It is of no importance," he said quietly, "you are a Pole, of
  course?"</p>

  <p>Silinski stared at him blankly. These Jesuits&mdash;strange stories had
  been told about them. A body with a secret organization, spread over the
  world&mdash;it had been said that they were hand-in-hand with the police.</p>

  <p>"I knew you were a Pole; I lived for some time in Poland. Besides, you are
  only Spanish to your feet," the Jesuit looked down at Silinski's boots, "they
  are not Spanish; they are too short and too heavy."</p>

  <p>Silinski laughed again. After all, this was a confirmation of his views of
  Jesuits.</p>

  <p>"You, my father," he accused in his turn, "are a teacher; a professor at
  the college in Madrid; a professor of languages," he stopped and looked up to
  the awning that spread above him, seeking inspiration. "A professor of
  Greek," he said slowly.</p>

  <p>"Arabic," corrected the other, "but that deduction isn't clever, because
  the Jesuits at Madrid are all engaged in scholastic work."</p>

  <p>"But I knew you came from Madrid," smiled Silinski.</p>

  <p>"Because we both came by the same train," said the calm priest, "and for
  the same purpose."</p>

  <p>Silinski's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"For what purpose, father?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"To witness the eclipse," said the priest.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, Silinski watched the black-robed figure with the
  broad-rimmed hat disappearing in the crowd with a little feeling of
  irritation.</p>

  <p>He had not come to Burgos to witness the eclipse of the sun, but because
  he knew that the phenomenon would attract to the ancient stronghold of the
  Cid many notabilities. Notabilities were usually rich men, and these Silinski
  was anxious to meet. A Spanish gentleman, who could speak fluently French,
  English, German, and Italian, might, if he played his cards well, secure
  introductions at such a time as this, which ordinarily would be out of his
  reach. The guarded circles of Paris and London, through which the unknown
  could not hope to penetrate, would be assailable here.</p>

  <p>A stately Spanish grandee (which was Silinski's role) might call on my
  lord in Berkeley Square, and receive no happier welcome than the suspicious
  scrutiny of an under footman. His ability to speak English would not serve
  him in a city where 6,000,000 of people spoke it indifferently well.</p>

  <p>Silinski had come to Burgos as another man might go to a horse fair, in
  the hope of picking up a bargain; only, in the case of the Pole, it was a
  human bargain he desired, a profitable investment which he could secure for a
  hundred pesetas&mdash;for that was the exact amount of capital he at the
  moment controlled.</p>

  <p>So with Silinski in Burgos, with crowds hurrying to the hill above the
  cathedral to witness the eclipse, and with no other actor in this strange
  drama upon the stage, the story of the Nine Bears begins.</p>

  <p>Silinski scrawled a platitude in his notebook&mdash;had it been an epigram
  I would have recorded it&mdash;drank the remainder of his cafe au lait,
  signed to the waiter and paid him the exact amount due. Leaving the outraged
  servant speechless, he stepped into the stream and was swept up the hill to
  where a number of English people were gathered, with one eye upon their
  watches and another upon the livid shadow that lay upon the western sky.</p>

  <p>Silinski found a place on the slope of the hill tolerably clear of
  sightseers, and spread a handkerchief carefully on the bare baked earth and
  sat down. He had invested a penny in a strip of smoked glass, and through
  this he peered critically at the sun. The hour of contact was at hand, and he
  could see the thin rim of the obstruction cover the edge of the glaring
  ball.</p>

  <p>He had all the clever man's respect for the astuteness of the scientist,
  and as he waited he wondered by what method astronomers were able to so
  accurately fortell to the minute, to the second, nay to the thousandth part
  of a second, the time of eclipse. Perhaps&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Say, this place will do, it's not so crowded."</p>

  <p>Silinski looked up at the newcomers.</p>

  <p>One was short and stout and breathed stertor-ously, having recently
  climbed the hill, the other, the speaker, was tall, well-groomed and
  unmistakably an American, with his rimless glasses and his square-toed
  boots.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" wheezed the fat man. "Don't know which was worse, the climb or the
  crowd." He tapped his inside pocket apprehensively. "Hate crowds," he
  grumbled, "lose things."</p>

  <p>"Have you lost anything?" asked the other. The fat man shook his head, but
  felt his pocket again. Silinski saw this out of the corner of his
  eye&mdash;inside breast pocket on the left, he noted.</p>

  <p>"Baggin," said the fat man suddenly, "I've a feelin' that we oughtn't to
  have come here."</p>

  <p>"You make me tired," said the American wearily.</p>

  <p>"We oughtn't to be seen together," persisted the other; "all sorts of
  people are here, eh? Fellers I know slightly, chaps in the City, eh? They'll
  smell a rat."</p>

  <p>He was querulous and worrying, and had a trick of asking for corroboration
  where none was likely to be offered.</p>

  <p>"You're a fool," said the other.</p>

  <p>There was a long pause, and Silinski knew that the American was making
  dumb show signals of warning. They were nodding at him, he felt sure, so he
  raised his hat and asked politely:</p>

  <p>"At what hour is the eclipse?"</p>

  <p>"No savvy," said the fat man, "no hablo es-pagnol."</p>

  <p>Silinski shrugged his shoulders, and turned again to the contemplation of
  the plain below.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't speak English," said the fat man, "none of these beggars
  do."</p>

  <p>The American made no reply, but after a silence of a few minutes, he said
  quietly and in English:</p>

  <p>"Look at that balloon."</p>

  <p>But Silinski was too experienced a warrior to be trapped by a simple trick
  like that, and continued his solid regard of the landscape; besides, he had
  seen the balloons parked on the outskirts of the town, and knew that intrepid
  scientists would make the ascent to gather data.</p>

  <p>He took another look at the sun. The disc was half-way across its surface,
  and the west was grey and blue, and the little clouds that flecked the sky
  were iridescent. Crowds still poured up the hill, and the slope was now
  covered with people. He had to stand up, and in doing so he found himself
  side by side with the fat man.</p>

  <p>A strange light was coming to the world; there were triple shadows on the
  ground, and the stout man, whose name was Meyers, shifted uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Don't like this, Baggin," he said fretfully; "it's hateful&mdash;never
  did like these wonders of the sky, they make me nervous&mdash;am frightened,
  Baggin, eh? It's awful, it's damned awful. Look out there, out west behind
  you, eh? It's black, black&mdash;it's like the end of the world!"</p>

  <p>"Cut it out!" said his unimaginative companion.</p>

  <p>Then of a sudden the black shadow in the west leaped across the sky, and
  the world went grey black. Where the sun had been was a hoop of fire, a
  bubbling, boiling circle of golden light, and the circling horizon was a dado
  of bright yellow. It was as though the sun had set at its zenith, and the
  sunset glows were shown, east, west, north, and south.</p>

  <p>"My God! My God!" the fat man shook in his terror; "it's horrible,
  horrible."</p>

  <p>He covered his face with his hands, oblivious to everything, save a
  gripping fear of the unknown that clawed at his heart.</p>

  <p>He was blind and deaf to the hustling, murmuring crowd about him; only he
  knew he stood in the darkness at high noon, and that something was happening
  he could not compress within the limits of his understanding.</p>

  <p>Three minutes the eclipse lasted, then, as suddenly as it began, it
  ended.</p>

  <p>A blazing, blinding wave of light flooded the world, and the stars that
  had studded the sky went out.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;yes, I know I'm a fool." His face was bathed in perspiration,
  although with the darkness had come the chill of death. "It's&mdash;it's my
  temperament, eh? But never again! It's an experience."</p>

  <p>He shook his head, as his trembling legs carried him down the hillside;
  then he tapped his pocket mechanically and stopped dead.</p>

  <p>"Gone!" he gasped, and dived into his pocket. "Gone! by hell!" he roared.
  "Fifty thousand francs&mdash;gone&mdash;I've been robbed, Baggin&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You must expect that sort of thing in a crowd." said the philosophical
  American.</p>

  <p>Silinski went into the cathedral to count the money&mdash;it was very
  quiet in the cathedral.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap02"
     name="chap02">II. &mdash; SILINSKI HAS A PLAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SILINSKI had a sister who was beautiful. She enjoyed a vogue
  in Madrid as Foudonitya, a great dancer. She went her own way, having no
  reason for showing respect for her brother, or regard for his authority. This
  did not greatly exercise Silinski. But her way&mdash;so easy a way!&mdash;led
  to outrageous unconventionalities, and there were certain happenings which
  need not be particularized. She was solemnly excommunicated by the Archbishop
  of Toledo, and the evening newspapers published her photograph.</p>

  <p>Silinski was annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Child," he had said gravely to her, "you did wrong to come into conflict
  with the Church."</p>

  <p>"It will be a good advertisement," she said.</p>

  <p>Silinski shook his head, and said nothing.</p>

  <p>That night Foudonitya was hissed off the stage of the Casino, and came to
  her brother, not weeping or storming, but philosophically alarmed.</p>

  <p>"What am I to do?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Go away into the country and perform good works; be kind to the poor,
  hire a duenna, and make the acquaintance of the local correspondent of the
  Heraldo de Madrid."</p>

  <p>"It will cost money," said the practical Catherine&mdash;this was her
  name.</p>

  <p>"You can do nothing without money," said Silinski, and would have entered
  the saying in his notebook, but for the fact that it sounded trite.</p>

  <p>So Catherine went into the country, and from time to time there appeared
  notes of her charity in the Madrid papers. She was still in the country when
  the ban of excommunication was withdrawn and she did penance at Cordova.</p>

  <p>Silinski was not greatly surprised to see her dining at the Hotel de Paris
  at Burgos, on the night of the eclipse, but her hosts&mdash;they could not be
  her guests, for Catherine was one of the frugal sort&mdash;gave him occasion
  for thought. He stood in the doorway watching them. He had been looking for
  an empty table when he saw Catherine, and after a first glance he would have
  turned and departed, waiting until his sister was disengaged, but the fat man
  saw him.</p>

  <p>"Hi!" he bellowed, "there he is&mdash;stop him, somebody!"</p>

  <p>Silinski required no stopping; rather he came forward with a smile,
  offering his hand to the beautiful girl.</p>

  <p>"That was the fellow who was standing near me when I lost the money,"
  fumed the fat man, and looked helplessly round for a policeman.</p>

  <p>There was a scraping of chairs, a confusion of voices; people rose from
  their seats craning their necks in an endeavour to secure a better view of
  what was happening, in the midst of which Mr. Meyers found himself pulled to
  his chair.</p>

  <p>"Keep quiet&mdash;you," hissed Baggin's voice in his ear; "you fool,
  you're getting exactly a million dollars' worth of the wrong kind of
  publicity&mdash;he knows the girl." He leaned across the table and smiled
  crookedly at Silinski. "Sit down, won't you? My friend thinks he knows
  you&mdash;introduce us, Se&ntilde;ora."</p>

  <p>The commotion died down as it had begun, occasional curious glances being
  thrown at the strange quartette.</p>

  <p>"Your brother?" Baggin looked keenly at the bowing stranger. "Well, we've
  met him before, and my friend entertained rather unjust suspicions&mdash;but
  they were preposterous, of course."</p>

  <p>Silinski bowed again with a grave and patient smile.</p>

  <p>"He didn't understand English on the hill, eh?"</p>

  <p>Meyers choked as his suspicions found fresh food. "Don't like it Baggin,
  don't like it, I tell you!" He had a trick of dropping pronouns, which gave
  his speech an extraordinary rapidity of utterance.</p>

  <p>"We had the pleasure of meeting your sister in Eonda a few weeks ago,"
  Baggin went on smoothly, and Silinski nodded. He did not ask by what means
  this prosperous-looking American had secured an introduction in this land of
  punctilio. On Catherine's hand blazed a ring he had not remembered seeing
  before. "As we are leaving Spain tomorrow, we offered her a parting
  feast&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was feeling his way with Silinski, not quite sure of his ground.
  Silinski might be the outraged relative, the proud hidalgo, quickly and
  easily affronted, terrible in his vengeance. The girl needed some explaining
  away.</p>

  <p>As for Silinski, did Baggin but know, the girl had explained her presence
  when she laid her hand on the white table-cloth and the fires of her ring
  leaped and fell in the gas-light.</p>

  <p>"Se&ntilde;or," said Silinski benevolently, "I am gratified beyond measure with
  your courtesy. We Bohemians, we artists, ask nor offer excuse for our
  departures from the convention. My little one"&mdash;he patted Catherine's
  white hand&mdash;"makes friends quickly, but"&mdash;here he shrugged his
  shoulders and turned a pained face to the wheezing Mr. Meyers&mdash;"some
  observations have been made which reflect upon my honour."</p>

  <p>"No offence," growled Meyers sulkily.</p>

  <p>"Pardon," Silinski raised his hand, dignity and respect in every pose,
  "pardon, Se&ntilde;or, I could not fail to comprehend your accusation. I stood by
  your side on the hill, so absorbed, so rapt in the glories of the phenomena,
  that I could not bring my elated mind to the level of understanding." He
  resolved to remember this phrase. "I understood nothing, heard nothing, saw
  nothing, but the astral splendour&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No offence, no offence," grumbled the fat man, "didn't think before I
  spoke; worried, worried, worried!" He waggled his fat hand to and fro as
  though illustrating the process of perturbation.</p>

  <p>"As to that," said Silinski, with a magnificent sweep of hand, "we agree
  to forget; but you lost money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lost money!" the fat man glared, "lost more than money, important
  documents, a <i>precioso</i>&mdash;precious, savvy&mdash;letter from a feller
  in the city, no possible value except to owner, see?"</p>

  <p>"Let us go on with our dinner," said Baggin roughly; "you talk too much,
  Louis."</p>

  <p>"Letters have been lost, seemingly, irredeemably lost," persisted
  Silinski, who was not at all anxious to change the subject, "yet, by such
  agencies as I have at present in my mind, have been restored to their
  grateful and generous owners."</p>

  <p>"Detectives, eh?" Meyers' glare was now ferocious. "Spying, pryin', lyin'
  detectives? No! by&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Baggin looked across at the girl in patient despair.</p>

  <p>"I was not thinking of detectives&mdash;by the way, Burgos seems filled
  with these gentlemen," Silinski went on. "I was thinking of a genius who
  makes this country his home. His name"&mdash;Silinski's voice was emphatic as
  he created from his mind the wonderful investigator&mdash;"his name is Se&ntilde;or
  don Sylvester de Gracia, and he is a personal friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"Oh! let the thing go," interrupted Baggin impatiently. "You've lost it,
  and there's an end to it; the thief will be satisfied with the money and tear
  the letter up."</p>

  <p>"Unless," mused Silinski, "the thief is arrested by the police, and the
  letter is found upon him. Then the authorities might send for Se&ntilde;or T.B.
  Smith&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>Meyers' face went ashen, and his thick lips began to quiver like a child
  on the point of crying.</p>

  <p>"Smith? T.B. Smith? Commissioner, Scotland Yard! Not here, eh? Damn it,
  he's not here!"</p>

  <p>"I passed him in the Plaza Mayos less than an hour ago; a gentleman very
  easily amused."</p>

  <p>"Smith!" Meyers' shaking hand poured out a glass of amber wine. "Bah!
  mistaken!"</p>

  <p>"I know him slightly," said Silinski modestly (it was T.B. Smith who had
  marked him for deportation under the Undesirable Aliens Act); "I never forget
  a face."</p>

  <p>The fat man pushed back his chair, wiping his big mouth clumsily with a
  serviette.</p>

  <p>"Then it's up," he said. "He's here for something; my name's Mud in the
  city&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Be quiet!" Baggin turned with a snarl upon his companion. "Look here," he
  said, facing Silinski, "my friend is not quite himself&mdash;I'll take him up
  to my room for a minute or so: will you wait here? You might be of service to
  us."</p>

  <p>Without waiting for an answer the two men left the room, Baggin with one
  hand clenched on the fat man's arm.</p>

  <p>When they had gone Silinski turned to his sister.</p>

  <p>"I hope you haven't scared them," she said in German.</p>

  <p>"I think not," said her amiable relative, and the two exchanged
  confidences.</p>

  <p>"What have they done?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;as yet," he said diplomatically.</p>

  <p>"You have this letter?" she asked, but Silinski shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If I had," he said, "I could tell you all you want to know. Unfortunately
  I am in the dark."</p>

  <p>"And the money?"</p>

  <p>"I know no more about the money than you," he replied, with charming
  frankness. "Who are they?"</p>

  <p>She laughed, showing two straight, white rows of teeth, and there was
  genuine amusement in her big grey eyes. "You have the money, of course, and
  the letter&mdash;you must tell me, Gregory. I must know where I am with them;
  it is due to me."</p>

  <p>"As to the money," said Silinski, without shame, "it is some fifty
  thousand francs; one might live for a year in luxury upon fifty thousand
  francs. As for the letter&mdash;why, that is an annuity forever."</p>

  <p>He leaned over the table, and as he looked his eyes were lowered to the
  cloth, like a man ransacking his memory for elusive facts.</p>

  <p>"These men are part of an epidemic&mdash;a wave of financial instability
  is rushing across the world&mdash;no, I will put it inimitably: There are
  props of rotten finance; sometimes one pole snaps and the structure trembles,
  sometimes two snap and the structure lurches, but does not fall, for there is
  strength in union, and it is more difficult to break a bundle of worm-eaten
  sticks than one honest stave. But suppose all the props are withdrawn at
  once&mdash;what happens? Ph-tt! And suppose the weaker props say&mdash;' The
  big fellow is going&mdash;it is time for us to move'?"</p>

  <p>Catherine listened patiently.</p>

  <p>"I would rather you spoke less like a priest, in parables," she said.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Silinski, with an easy inclination of his head, as
  though this were the very comment he expected, "yet I must deal in parables.
  Amongst your accomplishments, do you speak English?"</p>

  <p>"A little." Catherine shrugged her shoulders carelessly. "I can say 'my
  dear' and 'I like you very much'."</p>

  <p>"Which hardly fulfils all commercial requirements," said Silinski
  thoughtfully. "I will translate to you the interesting letter, which may be
  condensed into one comprehensive sentence towards the end&mdash;'When you are
  ready say "jump"'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here Baggin appeared in the doorway, and beckoned to the polite Silinski,
  and that worthy made his way through the crowded room.</p>

  <p>"Can you get that letter?" asked Baggin, without any preliminary, "or were
  you only joshing?"</p>

  <p>"I can not only get the letter, but I have the letter," said the other
  calmly, and Baggin's lids narrowed. "Further, your plans are very foolish,"
  the Pole went on smoothly, "because you have no plans. Spain will not hold
  nine defaulting bucket-shop keepers&mdash;that is the idiom, is it
  not?&mdash;unless your retirement is organized with considerably more skill
  than you have up to this moment displayed."</p>

  <p>The American said nothing.</p>

  <p>"I have a plan, a great plan," said Silinski, and he drew himself erect in
  the pride of his authorship; "but you must take me into its working."</p>

  <p>"You are a damned villain," said Baggin, "a blackmailer!"</p>

  <p>Silinski's brows darkened.</p>

  <p>"Villain, yes," he said; "blackmailer, no&mdash;I am a genius&mdash;that
  is all."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap03"
     name="chap03">III. &mdash; SOME DISAPPEARANCES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN the month of March, 1904, a notice was posted on the
  doors of the London, Manhattan and Jersey Syndicate, in Moorgate Street. It
  was brief, but it was to the point&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Owing to the disappearance of Mr. George T. Baggin, the L.M. and J.
  Syndicate has suspended operations."</p>

  <p>With Mr. Baggin had disappeared the sum of &pound;247,000, an examination of the
  books of the firm revealed the fact that the London, Manhattan, and Jersey
  Syndicate was&mdash;Mr. Baggin; that its imposing title thinly disguised the
  operations of a bucket-shop, and the vanished bullion had been most
  systematically collected in gold and foreign notes.</p>

  <p>Mr. Baggin had disappeared as though the earth had swallowed him up. He
  was traced to Liverpool; a ticket to New York had been purchased by a man
  answering to his description, and he had embarked on the Lucania. The liner
  called at Queenstown, and the night she left Mr. "Coleman" was missing. His
  clothing and trunks were found intact in his cabin, and a pathetic note
  addressed to the chief steward was pinned to his pillow. It said, in the
  extravagant language of remorse, that overwhelmed by the horror of his
  position, the writer had decided to leave this world for a better, and, he
  trusted, brighter life. It was signed "George T. Baggin." The ship was
  searched from stem to stern, but no trace of the unfortunate man could be
  discovered.</p>

  <p>The evening newspapers flared forth with, "Tragic End of a Defaulting
  Banker," but Scotland Yard, ever sceptical, set on foot certain inquiries and
  learnt that a stranger had been seen in Queenstown after the ship sailed. A
  stranger who left for Dublin, and who doubled back to Heysham; who came, via
  Manchester, back to London again. In London he had vanished completely.
  Whether or not this was the redoubtable George T. Baggin, was a matter for
  conjecture.</p>

  <p>T.B. Smith, of Scotland Yard, into whose hands the case was put, had no
  doubt at all. He believed that Baggin was alive. Two months after the
  disappearance, the firm of Woolfe, Meyers, Limited, crumbled into
  dust&mdash;for Louis Meyers himself failed to take his place one fine morning
  in the lavishly furnished board-room in King William Street. Meyers was a
  dealer in Premium Bonds. A stout man, scant of breath, loose-lipped, sparing
  pronouns. His ingenious method of trading may be summarized in a sentence.
  You paid your money and he took his choice. "There can be no doubt at all,"
  said the Daily Megaphone, in commenting on his disappearance, "that this
  wretched man, face to face with exposure which was inevitable, has taken the
  supreme and desperate step of suicide. His overcoat, in which was a letter to
  the coroner, was found on one of the seats of the Thames Embankment..."</p>

  <p>Yet Scotland Yard took no trouble to find the body. Instead, it sent its
  most experienced detectives to watch the seaports. T.B. Smith's instructions
  to his watchful subordinates were marked with sardonic levity.</p>

  <p>"You will recognize the body of the late Louis Meyers," he wrote, "from
  the fact that it will be smoking a big cigar and carrying a portmanteau
  containing &pound;150,000's worth of French and German notes; it speaks Engish with
  a slight lisp."</p>

  <p>Most artistic of all was the passing of Lucas Damant, the Company
  Promoter. Damant's defalcations were the heaviest, for his opportunities were
  greater. He dealt in millions and stole in millions. Taking his summer
  holidays in Switzerland, Mr. Damant foolishly essayed the ascent of the
  Matterhorn without a guide. His alpenstock was picked up at the edge of a
  deep crevasse, and (I again quote the Megaphone) "yet another Alpine disaster
  was added to the alarming list of mountaineering tragedies." What time four
  expert guides were endeavouring to extricate the lost man from a bottomless
  pit, sixteen chartered accountants were engaged in extracting from the chaos
  of his documentary remains the true position of Mr. Damant's affairs, but the
  sixteen accountants, had they been sixteen hundred, and the space of time
  occupied in their investigations a thousand years, would never have been able
  to balance the Company Promoter's estate to the satisfaction of all
  concerned, for between debit and credit yawned an unfathomable chasm that
  close on a million pounds could not have spanned. In the course of time a
  fickle public forgot the sensational disappearance of these men; in course of
  time their victims died or sought admission to the workhouse. There were
  spasmodic discussions that arose in smoke-rooms and tap-rooms, and the
  question as to whether they were dead or whether they had merely bolted, was
  hotly debated, but it may be truthfully said that they were forgotten; but
  not by Scotland Yard, which neither forgets nor forgives.</p>

  <p>The Official Memory sits in a big office that overlooks the Thames
  Embankment. It is embodied in a man who checks, day by day, hour by hour, and
  minute by minute, the dark happenings of the world. He is an inconsiderable
  person, as personalities go, for he enters no witness-box to testify against
  a pallid prisoner. He grants no interviews to curious newspaper reporters, he
  appears in no magazine as a picturesque detector of crime, but silently,
  earnestly, and remorselessly, he marks certain little square cards, makes
  grim entries in strange ledgers, consults maps, and pores over foreign
  newspaper reports. Sometimes he prepares a dossier, as a cheap-jack makes up
  his prize packet, with a paper from this cabinet, a photograph from that
  drawer, a newspaper cutting, a docketed deposition with the sprawling
  signature of a dying man, a finger-print card&mdash;and all these he places
  in a large envelope, and addresses it in a clerkly hand to Chief Inspector
  So-and-So, or to the " Director of Public Prosecutions." When the case is
  over and a dazed man sits in a cell at Wormwood Scrubbs pondering his
  sentence, or, as it sometimes happens, when convict masons are at work
  carving initials over a grave in a prison yard, the envelope conies back to
  the man in the office, and he sorts the contents jealously. It is nothing to
  him, the sum of misery they have cast, or the odour of death that permeates
  them. He receives them unemotionally, distributes the contents to their
  cabinets, pigeonholes, guard-books, and drawers, and proceeds to make up yet
  another dossier.</p>

  <p>All things come to him; crime in all its aspects is veritably his
  stock-in-trade.</p>

  <p>When George Baggin disappeared in 1904, his simple arrangement of indexing
  showed the connection between the passing of Lucas Damant six months later,
  and the obliteration of Meyers between these times. The Official Memory knew,
  too, what the public had no knowledge of&mdash;namely, that there had been
  half a dozen minor, but no less mysterious, Sittings in the space of two
  years.</p>

  <p>Their stories, briefly and pithily told, were inscribed on cards in the
  silent man's cabinet. Underneath was the significant word, "Incomplete." They
  were stories to be continued; some other hand than his might take up the tale
  at a future time, and subscribe "Finis" to their grim chapters. He was
  satisfied to carry the story forward as far as his information allowed
  him.</p>

  <p>There never was a more fascinating office than this of the Silent
  Recorder's. It was terribly businesslike with its banked files, its
  innumerable drawers, its rows of deep cabinets, "A,B,C,D," they ran, then
  began all over again, "AA, BB, CC," except the big index drawer where "Aabot,
  Aaroon, Aato, Abard, Abart," commenced the record of infamous men. There were
  forgers here, murderers, coiners, defaulters, great and small (Silinski's
  autobiography occupies a folder by itself). There are stories of great
  swindles, and of suspected swindles, of events apparently innocent in
  themselves, behind which lie unsuspected criminalities.</p>

  <p>I show you this office, the merest glimpse of it, so that as this story
  progresses, and information comes mysteriously to the hand of the chief
  actor, you will understand that no miracle has been performed, no heaven-sent
  divination of purpose has come to him, but that at the back of the knowledge
  he employs with such assurance, is this big office at New Scotland Yard. A
  pleasant office overlooking the Embankment with its green trees and its sunny
  river and its very pleasant sights&mdash;none of which the Recorder ever
  sees, being short-sighted from overmuch study of criminal records.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap04"
     name="chap04">IV. &mdash; INTRODUCING T.B. SMITH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN the month of October the market, that unfailing barometer
  of public nerves, moved slowly in an upward direction.</p>

  <p>If the "House" was jubilant, the "Street" was no less gratified, for since
  the "Baggin Failure" and financial cataclysm which dragged down the little
  investors to ruin, there had been a sad flatness in the world of shares.
  There are many places of public resort where the "Street" people
  meet&mdash;those speculators who daily, year in and out, promenade the
  pavement of Throgmorton Street, buying and selling on an "eighth" margin.</p>

  <p>To them from time to time come the bareheaded clerks with news of this or
  that rise or fall, to receive instructions gravely imparted, and as gravely
  accepted, and to retire to the mysterious deeps of the "House" to execute
  their commissions.</p>

  <p>The market was rising steadily, as the waters of a river rise; that was
  the most pleasant knowledge of all. It did not jump or leap or flare; it
  progressed by sixteenths, by thirty-seconds, by sixty-fourths; but all down
  the money columns in the financial papers of the press were tiny little plus
  marks which brought joy to the small investor, who is by nature a "bull."</p>

  <p>Many people who are not directly interested in finance regarded the signs
  with sympathy. The slaves of the street, 'busmen, cabmen, the sellers of
  clamorous little financial papers, all these partook in the general
  cheeriness.</p>

  <p>Slowly, slowly, climbed the market.</p>

  <p>"Like old times," said a hurrying clerk; but the man he spoke to sniffed
  contemptuously, being by nature one of that sour class from which all
  bear-dom is recruited.</p>

  <p>"Like old times!" chuckled a man standing at the Bodega bar, a little
  dazed with his prosperity. Somebody reminded him of the other booms that had
  come and undergone sudden collapse, but the man standing at the counter
  twiddled the stem of the glass in his hand and smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>"Industrials are the feature," said an evening paper, and indeed the
  biggest figures behind the tiny plus marks were those against the famous
  commercial concerns best known in the city. The breweries, the bakeries, the
  cotton corporations, the textile manufacturing companies enjoying quotation
  in the share list&mdash;all these participated in the upward rush; nay, led
  the van.</p>

  <p>Into Old Broad Street on one day at the height of the boom, came a man a
  little above middle height, clean-shaven, his face the brick tan of one who
  spends much of his life in the open air. He wore a suit of blue serge, well
  cut but plain, a spotless grey Tirai hat, broad-brimmed, white spats over his
  patent shoes, and a thin cane in his hand. "A fellow in the Kaffir market"
  guessed one of the group about the corner of Change Alley, but somebody
  better informed turned hastily when he saw the quick striding figure
  approaching, and dived down a side court.</p>

  <p>A showily-attired young man, standing on the edge of the pavement chewing
  a quill toothpick thoughtfully, did not see the newcomer until he was close
  on him, then started and changed colour. The man in the wide-brimmed hat
  recognized him and nodded. He checked his walk and stopped.</p>

  <p>"Here's Moss," he said. He had a snappy, curt delivery and a disconcerting
  habit of addressing one in the third person. "How is Moss? Straight now?
  Straight as a die, I'll swear. He's given up rigging, given up Punk
  Prospectuses for Petty Punters. Oh, Moss! Moss!"</p>

  <p>He shook his head with gentle melancholy, though a light twinkled in his
  humorous grey eyes.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why you're so 'ard on me, Mister Smith," said the
  embarrassed Moss; "we've all got our faults&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not me, Mr. Moss," said T.B. Smith promptly.</p>

  <p>"I dessay even you, sir," insisted the other. "I've 'ad my flutter; and I
  failed. There's lots of people who've done more than I ever done, worse
  things, and crookeder things, who are livin' in what I might call the odour
  of sanctity.</p>

  <p>"There's people in the 'Ouse," Moss wagged an admonitory finger towards
  'Change, and his tone was bitter but envious, "who've robbed by the million,
  an' what do we see?"</p>

  <p>T.B. Smith shook his head.</p>

  <p>"We see," said the indignant young man, "motor cars, an' yachts, an'
  racehorses&mdash;because they 'aven't been found out!"</p>

  <p>"Moral," mused T.B. Smith, "don't allow yourself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, I know," Moss loftily waved aside the dubious morality of Mr.
  Assistant-Commissioner Smith. "But I was found out. Twelve months in the
  second division. Is that justice?"</p>

  <p>"It all depends," cautiously, "what you mean by justice. I thought the
  sentence was rather light."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mr. Smith," said Mr. Moss firmly; "let's put the matter
  another way round. Here's Baggin's case, an' Meyers' case. Now I ask you, man
  to man, are these chaps dead?"</p>

  <p>T.B. Smith was discreetly silent.</p>

  <p>"Are they dead?" again demanded Moss, with emotion. "You know jolly well
  they ain't. You know as well as I do who's at the bottom of these bear raids
  to send the market into the mud. I know them raids!" in his excitement Mr.
  Moss got further and further away from the language of his adoption; "they
  smell o' Baggin, George T. Baggin; he's operatin' somewhere. I recognize the
  touch. George T. Baggin, I tell you, an' as the good book says, his right
  hand hath not lost its cunnin'."</p>

  <p>"And," said T.B. Smith, blandly ignoring the startling hypothesis; "what
  is Mr. Moss doing now to earn the bread, butter, and etceteras of life?"</p>

  <p>"Me? Oh, I'm in the East mostly," said the other moodily; "got a client or
  two; give a tip an' get a tip now an' again. Small money an' small
  profits."</p>

  <p>He dropped his eyes under the steady and pseudo-benevolent gaze of the
  other.</p>

  <p>"No companies," said the detective softly. "No companies, Mr. Moss? No
  Amalgamated Peruvian Concessions, eh? No Brazilian Rubber and Exploitation
  Syndicate?"</p>

  <p>The young man shifted his feet uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Genuine concerns, them," he said doggedly; "an' besides, I'm only a
  shareholder."</p>

  <p>"Not promoter. Mr. Moss is not a promoter?"</p>

  <p>In desperation the badgered shareholder turned.</p>

  <p>"How in 'eaven's name you get hold of things I don't know," he said in
  helpless annoyance. "An' all I can say&mdash;excuse me."</p>

  <p>T.B. Smith saw his expression undergo a sudden change.</p>

  <p>"Don't look round, sir," said the other breathlessly; "there's one o' my
  clients comin' along; genuine business, Mr. Smith; don't crab the deal."</p>

  <p>In his agitation he grew a little incoherent.</p>

  <p>T.B. Smith might have walked on discreetly, leaving Moss to transact his
  business in quiet and peace. Indeed, the young man's light blue eyes pleaded
  for this indulgence; but the gentleman from Scotland Yard was singularly
  obtuse this morning.</p>

  <p>"You don't want to meet him," urged Mr. Moss. "He's not in your line, sir;
  he's a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"I think you're very rude, Mr. Moss," said T.B. Smith, and waited, whilst
  Moss and client met.</p>

  <p>The client may have been a gentleman; he was certainly opulent. The day
  being fairly mild, T.B. Smith thought the client's fur-lined coat a
  superfluity, but the silk hat which overtopped the client's thin, long face
  was most correct.</p>

  <p>"Permit me," said Moss with all the grace he could summon at a moment's
  notice, "to introduce you to a friend of mine&mdash;name of Smith&mdash;in
  the Government."</p>

  <p>The stranger bowed and offered a gloved hand.</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;" said T.B., hesitant. "I did not quite catch your name."</p>

  <p>"Count Poltavo," said Mr. Moss defiantly; "a friend of mine an' a
  client."</p>

  <p>"Delighted to make your acquaintance, Count. I have met you
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>The Count bowed.</p>

  <p>"It is ver' likely. I have been in England before."</p>

  <p>T.B. Smith with his head on one side, so ridiculously reminiscent of an
  inquisitive bird, surveyed the imperturbable foreigner with interest.</p>

  <p>"But for the integrity of Mr. Moss," he said, "I should believe that I had
  been introduced to quite an old friend of mine&mdash;Gregory Silinski, to
  wit."</p>

  <p>The foreigner smiled, showing two regular rows of white teeth.</p>

  <p>"You think of my cousin, of whom there is some resemblance&mdash;a bad
  lot." He shook his head sternly and reprovingly.</p>

  <p>"A bad lot, indeed," agreed T.B. Smith, and offered his hand to Moss.</p>

  <p>"Good-day to you, Mr. Moss," he said; "keep out of mischief; good-bye, Mr.
  Silinski." He looked at his watch. "It wants four minutes to twelve; and if
  by five minutes to twelve tomorrow you are still in England, I shall arrest
  you. Com-prenez?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Parfaitement</i>," said Silinski, who prided himself upon his ability
  to accept a situation.</p>

  <p>T.B. Smith resumed his walk. At the corner of Threadneedle Street an
  able-bodied hawker offered him his choice of a box of matches or a pair of
  bootlaces.</p>

  <p>"Neither in mine," said T.B. Smith. "Have you got a hawker's license, my
  man?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>The hawker produced from the inside pocket of his frowsy jacket a folded
  paper, and T.B. Smith examined it carefully. He must have read every word of
  it twice. After a while, he handed it back and what he said was not about
  hawkers, or licenses.</p>

  <p>"I know they are here," he said as though referring to people whose names
  were inscribed on the paper he had been reading, "but they don't count, they
  are too small. Silinski, do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen him," said the hawker; "wasn't he deported over the Griffon
  Street affair?"</p>

  <p>T.B. Smith nodded.</p>

  <p>"He's way along," he said, with a jerk of his head in the direction of
  Moss and client; "get one of your men to watch and report."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir."</p>

  <p>T.B. Smith continued in the direction of the Mansion House. A famous
  banker passing in his motor brougham, waved his hand in salute; a city
  policeman stolidly ignored him.</p>

  <p>Along Cheapside, with the deliberate air of a sightseer, the man in the
  grey felt hat strolled, turning over in his mind the problem of the boom.</p>

  <p>For it was a problem.</p>

  <p>If you see on one hand ice forming on a pool, and on the other a
  thermometer rising slowly to blood-heat, you may be satisfied in your mind
  that something is wrong somewhere. Nature cannot make mistakes. Thermometers
  are equally infallible. Look for the human agency at work on the mercury
  bulb, for the jet of hot air directed to the instrument. In this parable is
  explained the market position, and T.B. Smith, who dealt with huge, vague
  problems like markets and wars and national prosperity, was looking for the
  hot-air current.</p>

  <p>The market rises because big people buy big quantities of shares; it falls
  because these same people sell, and T.B. Smith happened to know that nobody
  was buying. That is, nobody of account&mdash;Eckhardt's, Tollington's, or
  Bronte's Bank. You can account for the rise of a particular share by some
  local and favourable circumstance, but when the market as a whole moves
  up?</p>

  <p>"We can trace no transactions," wrote Mr. Louis Veil, of the firm of Veil,
  Vallings &amp; Boys, Brokers, "carried out by or on behalf of the leading
  jobbers. The marked improvement in Industrial Stocks is due, as far as we can
  gather, to Continental buying&mdash;an unusual circumstance."</p>

  <p>Who was the "philanthropist" who was making a market in stagnant stocks?
  Whoever it was, he or they repented long before T.B. Smith had reached the
  Central Criminal Court, which was his objective.</p>

  <p>He was a witness in the Gildie Bank fraud case, and his cross-examination
  at the hands of one of the most relentless of counsel occupied three hours.
  This concluded to everybody's satisfaction, save counsel, T.B. Smith, who
  hated the law courts, walked out into Old Baily to find newsboys loudly
  proclaiming,&mdash;" Slump on the Stock Exchange!"</p>

  <p>"Thank heaven, that bubble's burst!" said T.B. piously, and walked back to
  Scotland Yard, whistling.</p>

  <p>He did not doubt that the artificial rise had failed, and that the market
  had gone back to normal.</p>

  <p>At the corner of the Thames Embankment he bought a paper, and the first
  item of news he read was:</p>

  <p class="cp">"Consols have fallen to 84."</p>

  <p>Now, Consols that morning had stood at 90, and T.B. Smith stopped
  whistling.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap05"
     name="chap05">V. &mdash; THE ANTICIPATORS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">T.B. SMITH strolled into the room of Superintendent Elk.</p>

  <p>Elk was a detective officer chiefly remarkable for his memory. A tall,
  thin, sad man, who affects a low turned-down collar and the merest wisp of a
  black tie. If he has any other pose than his desire to be taken for a lay
  preacher, it is his pose of ignorance on most subjects. Elk's attitude to the
  world at large is comprehended in the phrase, "I am a child in these things,"
  which accounts to a very great extent for the rapidity of his promotion in
  the Criminal Investigation Department.</p>

  <p>T.B.'s face wore a frown, and he twirled a paper-knife irritably.</p>

  <p>"Elk," he said, without any preliminary, "the market has gone to the
  devil."</p>

  <p>"Again?" said Elk politely, having knowledge without interest.</p>

  <p>"Again," said T.B. emphatically, "for the fourth time this year. I've just
  seen one of the Stock Exchange Committee, and he's in a terrible state of
  mind. Stocks and shares are nothing to me," the Commissioner went on, seeing
  the patient boredom on the other's face, "and I know there is a fairly
  well-defined law that governs the condition of the Stock Exchange. Prices go
  see-sawing up and down, and that is part of the day's work, but for the
  fourth time, and for no apparent reason, the market is broken. Consols are
  down to 84."</p>

  <p>"I once had some shares in an American copper mine," reflected Elk, "and a
  disinterested stock-jobber advised me to hold on to them; I'm still holding,
  but it never occurred to me&mdash;I lost &pound;500&mdash;that it was a matter for
  police investigation."</p>

  <p>The Commissioner stopped in his walk and looked at the detective.</p>

  <p>"There's little romance in finance," he mused, "but there is something
  behind all this; do you remember the break of January 4th?"</p>

  <p>Elk nodded; he saw there was a police side to this slump, and grew alert
  and knowledgeable.</p>

  <p>"Yankees and gilt-edged American stock came tumbling down as though their
  financial foundations had been dug away. What was the cause?"</p>

  <p>Elk thought.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't it the suicide of the President of the 11th National Bank?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Happened after the crash," said T.B. promptly. "Do you remember the
  extraordinary slump in Russian Fours in April&mdash;a slump which, like the
  drop in Yankees, affected every market? What was the cause?"</p>

  <p>"The attempt on the Czar."</p>

  <p>"Again you're wrong," said the other; "the slump anticipated the attempt,
  it did not follow it. Then we have the business of the 9th of August."</p>

  <p>"The Kaffir slump?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But, surely, the reason for that may be traced," said Elk; "it followed
  the decision of the Cabinet to abolish coloured labour on the mines."</p>

  <p>"It anticipated it," corrected his chief, with a twinkle in his eye, "and
  do you remember no other occurrence that filled the public mind about that
  time?"</p>

  <p>Elk thought with knit brows.</p>

  <p>"There was the airship disaster at the Palace. Hike Mills was put away
  just about then for blackmail; there was the Vermont case&mdash;and the Sud
  Express wreck&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's it," said the Commissioner, "wrecked outside Valladolid, three
  killed, many injured&mdash;do you remember who was killed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Elk slowly, "a Frenchman whose name I've forgotten, Mr. Arthur
  Saintsbury, a King's Messenger&mdash;by George!"</p>

  <p>The connection dawned upon him, and T.B. grinned.</p>

  <p>"Killed whilst carrying dispatches to the King of Portugal," he said.</p>

  <p>"Those dispatches related to the proposed withdrawal of native
  labour&mdash;much of which is recruited in Portuguese West Africa"; he paused
  a moment, and added as an afterthought, "his dispatch-box was never
  found."</p>

  <p>There was silence.</p>

  <p>"You suggest?" said Elk suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I suggest there is an intelligent anticipator in existence who is much
  too intelligent to be at large." The Commissioner walked to the door.</p>

  <p>He stood for a moment irresolutely.</p>

  <p>"I offer you two suggestions," he said; "the first is that the method
  which our unknown operator is employing is not unlike the method of Mr.
  George Baggin who departed this life some four years ago. The second is, that
  if by any chance I am correct in my first surmise, we lay this ghost for good
  and all!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap06"
     name="chap06">VI. &mdash; AT BRONTE'S BANK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was two days later, when Consols touched 80, that T.B.
  Smith gathered in Elk and marched him into the City.</p>

  <p>The agitated Committee-man of the Stock Exchange met them in his office
  and led them to his private room.</p>

  <p>"I must tell you the whole story," he said, after he had carefully shut
  and locked the door. "Last Wednesday, the market still rising and a genuine
  boom in sight, Mogseys&mdash;they're the biggest firm of brokers in the
  city&mdash;got a wire from their Paris agents, which was to this effect:
  'Sell Consols down to 80.' They were standing then at 90, and were on the
  upgrade. Immediately following the wire, and before it could be confirmed,
  came another instruction in which they were told to sell some gilt-edged
  stocks&mdash;this was on a rising market, too&mdash;down to prices specified.
  I have seen the list, and taking the prices as they stood on Wednesday
  morning and the price they stand at today, the difference is
  enormous&mdash;something like three millions."</p>

  <p>"Which means?"</p>

  <p>"Which means that the unknown bears have pocketed that amount. Well,
  Mogseys were paralyzed at the magnitude of the order, and cabled away to
  their agent asking for particulars, and were equally dumbfounded to learn
  that they were acting on behalf of the Credit Bourbonaise, one of the biggest
  banks in the South of France. There was nothing else to do but to carry out
  the order, and on Thursday morning they had hammered stocks down ten
  points&mdash;stocks that have never fluctuated five points each way in mortal
  memory!"</p>

  <p>The Committee-man, speaking in tones of reverence of these imperturbable
  securities, mopped his forehead with a tumultuous bandana.</p>

  <p>"Now," he resumed, "we know all the bears throughout all the world. The
  biggest of 'em is dead. That was George T. Baggin, one of the most daring and
  unscrupulous operators we have ever had in London. We know every man or woman
  or corporation likely to jump on to the market with both feet and set it
  snagging&mdash;but there isn't a single known bear who has a hand in
  this.</p>

  <p>We've tried to discover his identity, but we've always come up against a
  blank wall&mdash;the bank. The bank can't give away its client, and even if
  it did, I doubt very much whether we should be any the wiser, for he's pretty
  sure to have hidden himself too deep. "We'd probably find the bank was
  instructed by a broker, and the broker by another bank, and we'd be as far
  off a solution as ever."</p>

  <p>"Is there any cause for the present break!"</p>

  <p>"I'm coming to that. In all previous slumps there has been a very good
  excuse for a panic hanging round. In the present instance no such excuse
  exists. There is a good feeling abroad, money is free and the Bank Eate is
  low, and the recent spurt in Kaffirs and Yankee rails has put a good heart
  into the market&mdash;why, even Bronte's have dealt!"</p>

  <p>He mentioned the name of the great bank, which in the City of London,
  ranks only second to the Bank of England.</p>

  <p>"I don't know exactly the details of their dealing, but it is pretty
  generally known in the City that they have increased their commitments, and
  when a conservative house like Bronte's take advantage of a spell of
  prosperity, you may be sure that peace is in the very air we breathe."</p>

  <p>T.B. Smith was thoughtfully rolling a glass paperweight up and down a
  blotting-pad, and Elk was regarding the ceiling with an air of pained
  resignation.</p>

  <p>Neither of the two spoke when the Committeeman finished his recital, or
  when he looked from one to the other, secretly disappointed that two men of
  whom he expected so much should be so little perturbed, indeed, so little
  interested, by his story. He waited a little longer for them to offer some
  remark, and, finding that neither had any comment to make, he asked a little
  impatiently&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Well!"</p>

  <p>T.B. roused himself from his reverie, and Elk brought his gaze to
  earth.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind telling me the names of the stocks againf" asked T.B.,
  "the stocks that are being attacked."</p>

  <p>The member recited a list.</p>

  <p>"Um!" said the Commissioner thoughtfully. "Industrials, breweries,
  manufactories&mdash;the very shares that enjoyed the boom and are now
  undergoing the slump!</p>

  <p>"Will you give me a Stock Exchange Yearbook!"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>He unlocked the door and went out, re-appearing shortly with a fat brown
  volume.</p>

  <p>T.B. turned the pages of the book with quick, nervous fingers, consulting
  the list at his side from time to time.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said at length, pushing the book from him and rising.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea&mdash;?" the broker began, and T.B. laughed.</p>

  <p>"You nearly said 'clue,'" he smiled; "yes, I've lots of ideas&mdash;I'm
  just going to work one of them out."</p>

  <p>He bowed slightly and the two detectives left the building together.</p>

  <p>At the corner of Threadneedle Street he bought an evening paper.</p>

  <p>"Issued at 4:10," he said, glancing at the "fudge" space, where the result
  of a race had been printed, "and nothing has happened."</p>

  <p>He hailed a passing cab and the two men got in.</p>

  <p>"Bronte's Bank, Holborn," was the direction he gave.</p>

  <p>"Like the immortal Mrs. Harris, there ain't no Bronte, as you know,"he
  said. "The head of the business is Sir George Calliper. He's an austere young
  man of thirty-five or thereabouts. President of philosophical societies and
  patron of innumerable philanthropies."</p>

  <p>"Has no vices," added Elk.</p>

  <p>"And therefore a little inhuman," commented T.B. "Here we are."</p>

  <p>They drew up before the severe fagade of Bronte's, and dismissed the
  cab.</p>

  <p>The bank was closed, but there was a side door&mdash;if, indeed, such an
  insignificant title could be applied to the magnificent portal of mahogany
  and brass&mdash;and a bell, which was answered by a uniformed porter.</p>

  <p>"The bank is closed, gentlemen," he said when T.B. had stated his
  errand.</p>

  <p>"My business is very urgent," said T.B. imperatively, and the man
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid Sir George has left the building," he said, "but if you will
  give me your cards I will see."</p>

  <p>T.B. Smith drew a card from his case. He also produced a tiny envelope, in
  which he inserted the card.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later the messenger returned.</p>

  <p>"Sir George will see you," he said, and ushered them into an anteroom.
  "Just a moment, gentlemen, Sir George is engaged."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes passed before he came again. Then he reappeared, and they
  followed him along a marble-tiled corridor to the sanctum of the great
  man.</p>

  <p>It was a large room, solidly and comfortably furnished and thickly
  carpeted. The only ornamentation was the beautifully carved mantel, over
  which hung the portrait of Septimus Bronte, who, in 1743, had founded the
  institution which bore his name.</p>

  <p>Sir George Calliper rose to meet them.</p>

  <p>He was a tall young man with sandy hair and a high, bald forehead. From
  his square-toed boots to his black satin cravat he was commercial solidity
  personified. T.B. noted the black ribbon watch-guard, the heavy, dull gold
  signet-ring, the immaculately manicured nails, the dangling, black-rimmed
  monocle, and catalogued his observations for future reference. Elk, who saw
  with another eye and from a different point of view, mentally recorded a
  rosebud on the carpet and a handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Now, what can I do for you?" asked Sir George; he picked up the card from
  the desk and refreshed his memory.</p>

  <p>"We're very sorry to trouble you," began T.B. conventionally, but the
  baronet waved the apology aside.</p>

  <p>"I gather you have not come to see me out of office hours without cause,"
  he said, and his tone rather suggested that it would be unpleasant even for
  an Assistant-Commissioner, if he had.</p>

  <p>"No, but I've come to make myself a nuisance&mdash;I want to ask you
  questions," said T.B. coolly.</p>

  <p>"So long as they are pertinent to the business in hand, I shall have every
  pleasure in answering," replied Sir George.</p>

  <p>"First and foremost, is there the slightest danger of Bronte's Bank
  failing?" asked T.B. Smith calmly.</p>

  <p>The audacity of the question struck the baronet dumb.</p>

  <p>"Failing?" he repeated, "Bronte's fail&mdash;Mr. Smith, are you
  jesting?"</p>

  <p>"I was never more in earnest," said T.B. "Think what you like of my
  impertinence, but humour me, please."</p>

  <p>The banker looked hard at the man before him, as though to detect some
  evidence of ill-timed humour.</p>

  <p>"It is no more possible for Bronte's to fail, than the Bank of England,"
  he said brusquely.</p>

  <p>"I am not very well acquainted with the practice of banking," said T.B.,
  "and I should be grateful if you would explain why it is impossible for a
  bank to fail."</p>

  <p>If Sir George Calliper had been a little less sure of himself, he would
  have detected the monstrous inaccuracy of T.B.'s confession of ignorance.</p>

  <p>"But are you really in earnest?"</p>

  <p>"I assure you," said T.B. seriously, "that I regard this matter as being
  one of life and death."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the banker, with a perplexed frown, "I will explain. The
  solvency of a bank, as of an individual, is merely a matter of assets and
  liabilities. The liabilities are the elementary debts, deposits, loans,
  calls, and such like, that are due from the bank to its clients and
  shareholders. Sometimes the liability takes the form of a guarantee for the
  performance of certain obligations&mdash;that is clear enough?"</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded.</p>

  <p>"Assets may be represented as gold, Government securities and stock
  convertible into gold, properties, freehold, leasehold, land; but you know,
  of course, the exact significance of the word assets?"</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded again.</p>

  <p>"Well, it is a matter of balance," said the banker; "allowing a liberal
  margin for the fluctuation of securities, we endeavour to and succeed in
  keeping a balance of assets in excess of our liabilities."</p>

  <p>"Do you keep gold in any quantity on the premises?&mdash;what would be the
  result, say, of a successful burglary that cleared your vaults!"</p>

  <p>"It would be inconvenient," said Sir George, with a dry smile, "but it
  would not be disastrous."</p>

  <p>"What is your greatest outstanding liability?" demanded T.B.</p>

  <p>The banker looked at him strangely.</p>

  <p>"It is queer that you should ask," he said slowly, "it was the subject of
  a discussion at my board meeting this afternoon&mdash;it is the Wady Semlik
  Barrage."</p>

  <p>"The Egyptian irrigation scheme?" asked T.B. quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the bank's liability was very limited until a short time ago. There
  was always a danger that the physical disabilities of the Soudan would bring
  about a fiasco. So we farmed our liability, if you understand the phrase. But
  with the completion of the dam, and the report of our engineer that it had
  been submitted to the severest test, we curtailed the expensive
  insurance."</p>

  <p>"When are the works to be handed over to the Egyptian Government?"</p>

  <p>Sir George smiled.</p>

  <p>"That I cannot tell you," he said, "it is a secret known only to the
  directors and myself."</p>

  <p>"But until it is officially handed over, you are liable!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, to an extent. As a matter of fact, we shall only be fully liable for
  one day. For there is a clause in the agreement which binds the Government to
  accept responsibilities for the work seven days after inspection by the works
  department, and the bulk of our insurances run on till within twenty-four
  hours of that date. I will tell you this much: the inspection has taken
  place, I cannot give you the date&mdash;and the fact that it was made earlier
  than we anticipated is responsible for the cancellation of the
  insurances."</p>

  <p>"One more question, Sir George," said T.B. "Suppose, through any cause,
  the Wady Semlik Barrage broke on that day&mdash;the day upon which the bank
  was completely liable&mdash;what would be the effect on Bronte 'sT'</p>

  <p>A shadow passed over the banker's face.</p>

  <p>"That is a contingency I do not care to contemplate," he said curtly.</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"I have not asked you to explain your mysterious visit," he said, with a
  smile, "and I am afraid I must curb my curiosity, for I have an appointment
  in ten minutes, as far west as Portland Place. In the meantime, it may
  interest you to read the bank's balance-sheet."</p>

  <p>Elk's vacant eye was on him as he opened a drawer in his desk.</p>

  <p>He closed it again hurriedly with a little frown. He opened another drawer
  and produced a printed sheet. "Here it is," he said. "Would you care to see
  me again at ten tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>T.B. might have told him that for the next twelve hours the banker would
  hardly be out of sight for an hour, but he replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I shall be very pleased."</p>

  <p>He had shaken hands with Sir George, and was on his way to the door, when
  Elk gave a sign which meant "cover my movements," and T.B. turned again.</p>

  <p>"By the way," he said, pointing to the picture over the fireplace, "that
  is the Bronte, is it not?"</p>

  <p>Sir George turned to the picture.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said he, and then with a smile, "I wonder Mr. Bronte did not fall
  from his frame at some of your questions."</p>

  <p>T.B. chuckled softly as he followed the uniformed doorkeeper along the
  ornate corridor.</p>

  <p>In a cab being driven rapidly westward, Elk solemnly produced his
  finds.</p>

  <p>"A little rose and a handkerchief," he said.</p>

  <p>T.B. took the last-named article in his hand. It was a delicate piece of
  flimsiness, all lace and fragrance. Also it was damp,</p>

  <p>"Here's romance," said T.B., folding it carefully and putting it in his
  pocket. "Somebody has been crying, and I'll bet it wasn't our friend the
  banker."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap07"
     name="chap07">VII. &mdash; SILINSKI EXPLAINS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">T.B. SMITH was dressing for dinner in his room at the Savoy,
  his mind occupied by speculations that centered round a mill dam, when there
  came a gentle tap at the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he said, having all but completed his somewhat elaborate
  toilet&mdash;he was ever a little fastidious in the matter of personal
  adornment.</p>

  <p>The door opened, and there came into his room a gentleman in evening
  dress, very beautiful to behold.</p>

  <p>His shirt-front was soft and pleated, and there were three little diamond
  buttons to fasten it. His dress suit fitted him almost as well as the white
  gloves on his hands, and if the velvet collar of his coat was a little
  daring, he had the distinguished air of the educated and refined foreigner to
  carry off his sartorial extravagance.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Silinski," said T.B., without turning round. "Twenty-four hours
  I gave you&mdash;when do you leave?"</p>

  <p>"May I take a chair?"</p>

  <p>Silinski was suave, polite, deferential, all the things that a well-bred
  man of the world should be.</p>

  <p>"Sorry&mdash;chuck those things of mine from the chair by the bed."</p>

  <p>So far from "chucking" anything anywhere, Silinski removed the various
  articles of attire one by one, folded them, and placed them in a neat pile on
  the bed.</p>

  <p>Then he seated himself carefully.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Smith," he began, "it was written by the illustrious philosopher
  Epictetus&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do not," begged T.B., in the throes of manipulating a dress tie, "do not
  quote any of your disreputable friends, I beg."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Silinski, unabashed, "let me put the matter in another way?
  Medical authority has it that all human-kind changes once in every seven
  years. New tissues replace the old, of superior or inferior quality according
  to age and temperament; but assuredly an entire change comes to every
  man."</p>

  <p>"The last man who cited to me the born-again theory&mdash;which, by the
  way, is an old one in criminal circles," interrupted T.B., "is now living in
  retirement near Princetown because unfortunately, there was enough of the old
  tissue left in him to induce him to commit crimes for which, I do not doubt.
  the shame and indignation..."</p>

  <p>"It it foolish," reflected Silinski, clasping his knee and gazing
  pensively at the ceiling, "to attempt to pit one's feeble wit against a
  philospher and gentleman of your calibre. Coming down to
  foundations&mdash;that is your idiom, I believe&mdash;is it necessary that I
  should leave England?"</p>

  <p>"It is," said T.B., confronting him now.</p>

  <p>"Because years ago I was," pursued Silinski, "a poor waif without a friend
  in this vast city, hungry, alone, half mad with solitude and starvation;
  because in the far-off days I stole a little. Is my sin to be visited on my
  head in the days of my affluence?"</p>

  <p>The unsympathetic T.B. grinned.</p>

  <p>"What a liar you are, Silinski," he said admiringly. "Friendless!
  starving! why, you beggar, you were living on the fat of Europe I Have you
  forgotten the reason for your deportation? A friend of yours threw a
  bomb&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Silinski raised a protesting hand.</p>

  <p>"There is no need to go farther," he said with dignity, "the circumstances
  of my persecution had for the moment escaped my memory. I must go!"</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded. He nodded most emphatically.</p>

  <p>"Go you must," he transposed, and Silinski rose to his feet slowly and
  sadly.</p>

  <p>"You would favour me if you extended the period," he said. "I have many
  interests in this country which will require time to realize. Also my sister
  is here, with obligations of a character not to be overridden: she is not
  without some little fame."</p>

  <p>He took from the breast pocket of his coat a highly-coloured picture
  post-card, and handed it to the detective.</p>

  <p>"You might not know that La Belle Espagna, whose dancing at the
  Philharmonic has aroused the populace to enthusiasm, has the misfortune to
  have for brother Gregory Silinski, patriot and outcast."</p>

  <p>He struck a little attitude, and T.B. smiled again.</p>

  <p>"I have been aware of that fact for many months," he said, and Silinski
  could not control the look of astonishment and uneasiness that crossed his
  face.</p>

  <p>"In fact, my dear friend," said T.B., dropping easily into French, "I know
  everything."</p>

  <p>He watched carelessly for some sign of alarm in the other, and was
  immediately gratified. The wonder was that one of Silinski's experience
  should have been deceived by the bluff T.B. was making.</p>

  <p>"Because I know of these things," continued T.B. Smith, enjoying the
  mystery he was creating, "I desire your absence. Let us, however, extend the
  period of grace to three days, at the end of which time I would have you in a
  land where your genius is appreciated to a greater extent than in this land
  of England."</p>

  <p>Silinski stood in the centre of the room, his head bent forward, his whole
  attitude suggestive of feline activity, and suddenly T.B. felt the airy
  badinage of his own tone ring hollow, and there came to him a realization
  that in some indefinable way he was in deadly peril.</p>

  <p>What secret had he surprised&mdash;what strange devilment was behind this
  man?</p>

  <p>T.B. had no other regard for Silinski than as a political extremist, a
  mischievous egger-on of other and bolder spirits. He had never thought of
  Silinski as a source of danger. T.B. Smith was prompt to act.</p>

  <p>"My man," he said evenly, "for some reason I do not like your present
  state of mind, and if you do monkey tricks I shall take you by the scruff of
  your neck and drop you out of the window."</p>

  <p>Silinski's face was extraordinarily pale, but he did not move.</p>

  <p>"You know&mdash;what?" he said steadily. "I am anxious, monsieur, to see
  where I stand. If you know what you may know, I have bungled&mdash;and if I
  have not, then somebody else has."</p>

  <p>"As to my information," said T.B., "I am not prepared to extend my
  confidence to you. I can only warn you that you will be watched, and any
  attempt on your part to further certain political propaganda"&mdash;he saw a
  look of relief come to the other's face, and was satisfied&mdash;"will be
  instantly and violently suppressed."</p>

  <p>He escorted his visitor to the lift and exchanged conventional farewells
  for the benefit of the liftman, and returned slowly to his room. Then he sat
  down to untangle the mystery.</p>

  <p>1. Silinski, an anarchist (see Dossier R.P.D., 9413, Record Department),
  and by his own confession.</p>

  <p>2. Deported for inciting to murder.</p>

  <p>3. His sister comes to London to fulfil an engagement at a first-class
  music-hall. ("No particular significance in this," thought T.B. "We are all
  liable to be cursed with unspeakable relations.")</p>

  <p>"By the way!"</p>

  <p>He walked across the room to where a telephone stood on the little table,
  and called up Elk at Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"Is anything known about La Belle Espagna&mdash;the dancing girl at the
  Philharmonic? Yes, I know all about her brother. Eh, what's
  that?&mdash;people desperately in love with her? You surprise me! Who? A
  young lord? Elk, there is so much awe in your voice that I could not catch
  that last. Who is the lord? Carleby? Never heard of him. Is that all?
  Thanks."</p>

  <p>He hung the receiver up.</p>

  <p>4. Silinski reappears, imposingly prosperous. He knows Moss, frankly, a
  thief.</p>

  <p>Could they have business together, fearing detection in which, Silinski
  goes white? Hardly.</p>

  <p>Then what was Silinski doing in London? Was he&mdash;a bear! T.B. had not
  connected the man with the bear raid. But that sort of thing was not in
  Silinski's line.</p>

  <p>He sat meditating till he realized that he was hungry, and taking his
  overcoat from a peg behind the door, struggled into it and went out.</p>

  <p>Elk met him at ten o'clock, and together they drove back to the Yard.
  There was need to dismiss Silinski from his mind.</p>

  <p>This business of the Egyptian barrage was sufficient to occupy his
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>Dimly, he began to see the workings of the gigantic combination that was
  spreading destruction throughout the world, anticipating disaster
  profitably.</p>

  <p>Who they were he might guess; where their headquarters were situated he
  could not understand. In two days telegraph and cable office had been
  systematically ransacked for evidence upon this point. Every code, private
  and official, had been employed in the deciphering of messages that had
  arrived in London on the day of the slump and the day preceding it. The
  secret police of a dozen countries were acting in concert; for now that
  Scotland Yard had begun its investigations, many things were remembered. The
  Berlin financial crisis, coincided with the discovery of stolen plans, which
  had all but precipitated a war with Austria. Every country had its tale to
  tell of unaccountable depression, and their secret forces worked in unison to
  discover wherefore.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap08"
     name="chap08">VIII. &mdash; MURDER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I'VE got two men on to Sir George," said T.B.&mdash;they
  were at the Yard&mdash;"I've given them instructions not to leave him day or
  night. Now, the question is, how will the 'bears' discover the fatal day the
  barrage is to be handed over to the guileless Fellaheen?"</p>

  <p>"Through the Egyptian Government?"</p>

  <p>"That I doubt. It seems a simple proposition, but the issues are so
  important that you may be sure our mysterious friends will not strike until
  they are absolutely certain. In the meantime&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He unlocked the safe and took out a book. This, too, was fastened by two
  locks. He opened it, laid it down and began writing on a sheet of paper,
  carefully, laboriously checking the result.</p>

  <p>That night the gentleman who is responsible for the good order of Egypt
  received a telegram which ran&mdash;</p>

  <p class="telegram">PREMIUM FELLOW COLLECT WADY BARRAGE MERIDIAN TAINTED
  INOCULATE WEARY SULPHER.</p>

  <p>There was a great deal more written in the same interesting style. When
  the Egyptian Chief of Police unlocked his book to decode the message, he was
  humming a little tune that he had heard the band playing outside Shepheard's
  Hotel. Long before he had finished decoding the message his humming
  stopped.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later the wires were humming, and a battalion of infantry was
  hastily entrained from Khartoum.</p>

  <p>Having dispatched the wire, T.B. turned to the other man, who was sitting
  solemnly regarding a small gossamer handkerchief and a crushed rosebud that
  lay on the table.</p>

  <p>"Well," demanded T.B. Smith, leaning over the table, "what do you make of
  'em?"</p>

  <p>"They are not Sir George's," replied the cautious Elk.</p>

  <p>"So much I gather," said T.B. "A client's?"</p>

  <p>"A very depressed and agitated client&mdash;feel."</p>

  <p>T.B.'s fingers touched the little handkerchief; it was still quite damp.
  He nodded.</p>

  <p>"The rosebud?"</p>

  <p>"Did you notice our austere banker's buttonhole?"</p>

  <p>"Not particularly&mdash;but I remember no flowers.'</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Elk absently, "there were no flowers. I noticed particularly
  that his buttonhole was sewn and yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And yet?"</p>

  <p>"Hidden in one of those drawers was a bunch of these roses. I saw them
  when he was getting your balance-sheet."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" T.B. tapped the table impatiently.</p>

  <p>"So you see," Elk went on, "we have an interest in this lady client of
  his, who comes after office hours, weeps copiously, and leaves a bunch of
  rosebuds as a souvenir of her visit. It may have been a client of
  course."</p>

  <p>"And the roses may have been security for an overdraft," said the ironic
  T.B. "What do you make of the handkerchief?"</p>

  <p>It was an exquisite little thing of the most delicate cambric. Along one
  hem, in letters minutely embroidered in flowing script, there ran a line of
  writing. T.B. took up a magnifying glass and read it.</p>

  <p>"'Que Dieu tu garde'," he read, "and a little monogram&mdash;a gift of
  some sort, I gather. As far as I can see, the lettering is 'N.H.C.'&mdash;and
  what that means, heaven knows! I'm afraid that beyond intruding to an
  unjustifiable extent into the private affairs of our banker, we get no
  further. Well, Jones?"</p>

  <p>With a knock at the door an officer had entered.</p>

  <p>"Sir George has returned to his house. We have just received a telephone
  message from one of our men."</p>

  <p>"What has he been doing tonight&mdash;Sir George?"</p>

  <p>"He dined at home; went to his club, and returned; he does not go out
  again."</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded.</p>

  <p>"Watch the house and report," he said, and the man saluted and left.</p>

  <p>T.B. turned again to the contemplation of the handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"If I were one of those funny detectives who live in books," he said
  sadly, "I could weave quite an interesting theory from this." He held the
  handkerchief to his nose and smelt it. "The scent is 'Sympatico,' therefore
  the owner must have lived in Spain, the workmanship is Parisian,
  therefore&mdash;" He threw the flimsy thing from him with a laugh. "This
  takes us no nearer to the Wady Barrage, my friend&mdash;no nearer to the
  mysterious millionaires who 'bear' the shares of worthy brewers. Let us go
  out into the open, Elk, and ask heaven to drop a clue at our feet."</p>

  <p>The two men turned their steps towards Whitehall, and were halfway to
  Trafalgar Square when a panting constable overtook them.</p>

  <p>"There is a message from the man watching Sir George Calliper's house,
  sir," he said; "he wants you to go there at once."</p>

  <p>"What is wrong?" asked T.B. quickly.</p>

  <p>"A drunken man, sir, so far as I could understand."</p>

  <p>"A what?"</p>

  <p>T.B.'s eyebrows rose, and he smiled incredulously.</p>

  <p>"A drunken man," repeated the man, "he's made two attempts to see Sir
  George&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hail that cab, Elk," said T.B. "We'll drive round and see this
  extraordinary person."</p>

  <p>A drunken man is not usually a problem so difficult that it is necessary
  to requisition the services of an Assistant-Commissioner. This much T.B.
  pointed out to the detective who awaited him at the corner of St. James's
  Square.</p>

  <p>"But this man is different," said the officer; he's well-dressed; he has
  plenty of money&mdash;he gave the cab-driver a sovereign&mdash;and he
  talks."</p>

  <p>"Nothing remarkable in that, dear lad," said T.B. reproachfully; "we all
  talk."</p>

  <p>"But he talks business, sir," persisted the offcer; "boasts that he's got
  Bronte's bank in his pocket."</p>

  <p>"The devil he does!" T.B.'s eyebrows had a trick of rising. "Did he say
  anything else?"</p>

  <p>"The second time he came," said the detective, "the butler pushed him down
  the steps, and that seemed to annoy him&mdash;he talked pretty freely then,
  called Sir George all the names he could lay his tongue to, and finished up
  by saying that he could ruin him."</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded.</p>

  <p>"And Sir George? He could not, of course, hear this unpleasant
  conversation? He would be out of earshot."</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon, sir," said the plain clothes man, "but that's where you're
  mistaken. I distinctly saw Sir George through the half-opened door. He was
  standing behind his servant."</p>

  <p>"It's a pity " began T.B., when the detective pointed along the street in
  the direction of the Square.</p>

  <p>"There he is, sir," he whispered, "he's coming again."</p>

  <p>Along the pavement, a little unsteadily, a young man walked. In the
  brilliant light of a street lamp T.B. saw that he was well dressed in a
  glaring way. The Assistant-Commissioner waited until the newcomer reached the
  next lamp, then walked to meet him.</p>

  <p>A young man, expensively garbed, red of face, and flashily
  jewelled&mdash;at a distance T.B. classified him as one of the more offensive
  type of nouveau riche. The stranger would have passed on his way, but T.B.
  stepped in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Mr. "He stopped with an incredulous gasp. "Mr. Moss!" he said
  wondering-ly. "Mr. Lewis Moss, some time of Tokenhouse Yard, company
  promoter."</p>

  <p>"Here, stash it, Mr. Smith," begged the young man. He stood unsteadily,
  and in his eye was defiance. "Drop all that&mdash;reformed&mdash;me. Look
  'ere"&mdash;he lurched forward and caught T.B. by the lapel of his coat, and
  his breath was reminiscent of a distillery&mdash;"if you knew what I know,
  ah!"</p>

  <p>The "Ah!" was triumph in a word.</p>

  <p>"If you knew what I know," continued Mr. Moss with relish, "but you don't.
  You fellers at your game think you know toot, as old Silinski says; but you
  don't." He wagged his head wisely.</p>

  <p>T.B. waited.</p>

  <p>"I'm goin' to see Calliper," Mr. Moss went on, with gross familiarity,
  "an' what I've got to say to him is worth millions&mdash;millions, I tell
  you. An' when Calliper says to me, 'Mr. Moss, I thank you!' and has done the
  right thing, I'll come to you&mdash;see!"</p>

  <p>"I see," said T.B.; "but you mustn't annoy Sir George any more
  tonight."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Smith," Mr. Moss went off at a tangent, "you want to know how
  I got acquainted with Silinski&mdash;well, I'll tell you. There's a feller
  named Hyatt that I used to do a bit of business with. Quiet young feller who
  got marvellous tips&mdash;made a lot o' money, he did, all because he bowled
  out Silinski&mdash;see?"</p>

  <p>He stopped short, for it evidently dawned upon him that he was talking too
  much.</p>

  <p>"He sent you, eh?" Mr. Moss jerked the point of a gold-mounted stick in
  the direction of Sir George's house. "Come down off his high 'orse"&mdash;the
  third "h" was too much for him&mdash;"and very wisely, very wisely." He shook
  his head with drunken gravity. "As a man of the world," he went on, "you
  bein' one an' me bein' another, it only remains to fix a meeting between self
  an' client&mdash;your client&mdash;an' I can give him a few tips."</p>

  <p>"That," said T.B., "is precisely my desire." He had ever the happy knack
  of dealing satisfactorily with drunken men. "Now let us review the
  position."</p>

  <p>"First of all," said Mr. Moss firmly, "who are these people?" He indicated
  Elk and the detective. "If they're friends of yours, ole feller, say the
  word," and his gesture was generous, "friends of yours? Right!" Once more he
  became the man of affairs.</p>

  <p>"Let us get to the bottom of the matter," said T.B. "Firstly, you wish to
  see Sir George Calliper?"</p>

  <p>The young man, leaning against some happily-placed railings, nodded
  several times.</p>

  <p>"Although," T.B. went on, shaking his head reprovingly, "you are not
  exactly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A bottle of fizz&mdash;a couple, nothing to cloud the mind," said the
  young man airily. "I've never been drunk in me life."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me that I have heard that remark before," said T.B., "but
  that's beside the matter; you were talking about a man called Hyatt who
  bowled Silinski."</p>

  <p>The young man pulled himself erect.</p>

  <p>"In a sense I was," he said with dignity, "in a sense I wasn't; and now I
  must be toddling."</p>

  <p>T.B. saw the sudden suspicion that came t him. "What do you know about the
  barrage?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>The man started back, sobered.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he said harshly. "I know nothing. I know you, though, Mr.
  Bloomin' Smith, and you ain't goin' to pump me. Here, I'm going."</p>

  <p>He pushed T.B. aside. Elk would have stopped him but for a look from his
  chief.</p>

  <p>"Let him go," he said. "I have a feeling that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The young man was crossing St. James's Street, and disappeared for a
  moment in the gloom between the street lamps. T.B. waited a time for him to
  reappear, but he did not come into sight.</p>

  <p>"That's rum," murmured Elk, "he couldn't have gone into Sir George's; his
  house is on the other side of the street&mdash;hello, there he is!"</p>

  <p>A man appeared momentarily in the rays of the lamp they were watching, and
  walked rapidly away.</p>

  <p>"That isn't him," said T.B., puzzled, "he's too tall; it must be somebody
  from one of the houses. Let us stroll along and see what has become of Mr.
  Moss."</p>

  <p>The little party crossed the street. The thoroughfare was deserted now,
  save for the disappearing figure of the tall gentleman.</p>

  <p>The black patch where Moss had disappeared was the entrance of the
  mews.</p>

  <p>"He must have mistaken this for a thoroughfare," said T.B. "We'll probably
  find him asleep in a corner somewhere." He took a little electric lamp from
  his pocket and shot a white beam into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"I don't see him anywhere," he said, and walked into the mews.</p>

  <p>"There he is!" said Elk suddenly.</p>

  <p>The man was lying flat on his back, his eyes wide open, one arm moving
  feebly.</p>

  <p>"Drunk!" said T.B., and leaned over him. Then he saw the blood and the
  wound in the man's throat.</p>

  <p>"Murder! by the Lord!" he cried.</p>

  <p>He was not dead, but even as the sound of Elk's running feet grew fainter,
  T.B. knew that this was a case beyond the power of the divisional surgeon.
  The man tried to speak, and the detective bent his head to listen. "Can't
  tell you all," the poor wreck whispered, "get Hyatt or the man on the Eiffel
  Tower&mdash;they know. His sister's got the book&mdash;Hyatt's
  sister&mdash;down in Falmouth&mdash;you'll find N.H.C. I don't know who they
  are, but you'll find them." He muttered a little incoherently, and T.B.
  strained his ears, but heard nothing. "N.H.C." he repeated under his breath,
  and remembered the handkerchief.</p>

  <p>The man on the ground spoke again&mdash;"The Admiralty&mdash;they could
  fix it for you."</p>

  <p>Then he died.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap09"
     name="chap09">IX. &mdash; HYATT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"GET Hyatt or the man on the Eiffel Tower!"</p>

  <p>It sounded like the raving of a dying man, and T.B. shook his head as he
  walked back to his chambers in the early hours of the morning.</p>

  <p>"Hyatt&mdash;the man on the Eiffel Tower&mdash;the Wady Barrage&mdash;the
  mysterious bears&mdash;what connection was there one with another"</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"To&mdash;Hyatt, a Friend of the late Lewis Moss.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Information concerning the whereabouts of the
  above-mentioned Hyatt is urgently required. Immediate communication should be
  made to the nearest police-station."</p>

  <p>This notice appeared under the heading, "Too late for classification" in
  every London newspaper the morning following the murder of Moss.</p>

  <p>"It is possible that the name is an assumed one," said T.B., "but the
  Falmouth clue narrows the search."</p>

  <p>An "all-station" message was flashed throughout the metropolis.</p>

  <p>"Arrest and detain Gregory Silinski" (here followed a description), "on
  suspicion of being concerned in the murder of Lewis Moss."</p>

  <p>But the surprising Silinski anticipated the arrest, for hardly had the
  last message been dispatched when he himself entered the portico of Scotland
  Yard and requested an interview with T.B.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said sadly, "I knew this young man. Poor fellow."</p>

  <p>He gave a very frank account of his dealings with Moss, offered a very
  full explanation of his own movements on the night of the murder, threw in
  not a few moral sayings on the futility of life and endeavour, and was
  finally dismissed by a perplexed Commissioner, who detached an officer to
  verify all that Silinski had said.</p>

  <p>He did not know Hyatt, confessed Silinski, had never heard the name; yet
  it seemed to T.B. Smith that at the mention of the mysterious Hyatt's name
  Silinski's lips tightened and his eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>T.B. was worried, and showed it after his own fashion. He sent Elk by an
  early train to pursue his inquiries, and then went into the City.</p>

  <p>An interview with the head of the banking-house of Bronte was not
  satisfactory.</p>

  <p>"I am satisfied," said T.B., "that an attempt will be made to destroy the
  barrage on the day for which you are liable. All the features of the present
  market position point to this fact."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said the banker, "the 'bears' must be clairvoyant. The day
  on which the barrage comes into the hands of the Egyptian Government is known
  to two persons only. I am one, and the other is a gentleman, the mere mention
  of whose name will satisfy you as to his integrity."</p>

  <p>"And none other?"</p>

  <p>"None other," said the banker. And that was all he would say.</p>

  <p>But at six o'clock that night T.B. received a message. It was written in
  pencil on the torn edges of a newspaper.</p>

  <p>"Tonight Sir George Calliper is dining with the Spanish dancing girl, La
  Belle Espagna."</p>

  <p>That, and an initial, was all the note contained, but it came from the
  most reliable man in the Criminal Investigation Department, and T.B. whistled
  his astonishment.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">X. &mdash; SIR GEORGE DINES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SIR GEORGE CALLIPER lived in St. James's Street. A
  bachelor&mdash;some regarded him as a misogynist&mdash;his establishment was
  nevertheless a model of order; and if you had missed the indefinable
  something that betrays a woman's hand in the arrangement of furniture, you
  recognized that the controlling spirit of the household was one possessed of
  a rigid sense of domesticity, that found expression in solid comfort and
  sober luxury.</p>

  <p>The banker sat in his study engaged in writing a letter. He was in evening
  dress, and the little French clock on the mantel had just chimed seven.</p>

  <p>He finished the note and folded it in its envelope. Then he pressed a
  bell. A servant entered.</p>

  <p>"I am dining out," said Sir George shortly. "I shall be home at eleven."
  It was characteristic that he did not say "may be home," or "at about
  eleven."</p>

  <p>"Shall I order the car, Sir George!"</p>

  <p>"No; I'll take a cab."</p>

  <p>A shrill whistle brought a taxi-cab to the door.</p>

  <p>A passing commissionaire stopped to ask the cabman which was the nearest
  way to Berkley Square as the banker came down the two steps of the house.</p>

  <p>"Meggioli's," he instructed the cabman, and added, "the Vine Street
  entrance."</p>

  <p>The commissionaire stood back respectfully as the whining taxi jerked
  forward.</p>

  <p>"Meggioli's!" murmured the commissionaire, "and by the private door!
  That's rum. I wonder whether Elk has started for Cornwall yet?"</p>

  <p>He walked into St. James's Square, and a smart one-horse brougham that had
  been idly moving round the circle of garden in the centre, pulled up at the
  kerb by his side.</p>

  <p>"Meggioli's&mdash;front entrance," said the commissionaire.</p>

  <p>It was a uniformed man who entered the carriage; it was T.B. Smith in his
  well-fitting dress clothes who emerged at Meggioli's.</p>

  <p>"I want a private room," he informed the proprietor, who came to meet him,
  with a bow.</p>

  <p>"I'm ver' sorry, Mr. Smith, but I have not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you have three," said T.B. indignantly.</p>

  <p>"I offer a thousand regrets," said the distressed restaurateur; "they are
  engaged. If you had only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But, name of dog! name of a sacred pipe!" expostulated T.B.
  unscrupulously. Was it not possible to pretend that there had been a mistake;
  that one room had already been engaged?</p>

  <p>"Impossible, m'sieur! In No. 1 we have no less a person than the Premier
  of South-West Australia, who is being dined by his fellow-colonists; in No. 2
  a family party of Lord Redlands; in No. 3&mdash;ah! in No. 3&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, in No. 3!" repeated T.B. cunningly, and the proprietor dropped his
  voice to a whisper.</p>

  <p>"La Belle Espagna!" he murmured. He named the great Spanish dancer with
  relish. "She, and her fiance's friend, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Her fianc&eacute;'s?" I didn't know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is a secret " he looked round as if he were fearful of eavesdroppers,
  "but it is said that La Belle Espagna is to be married to a rich
  admirer."</p>

  <p>"Name?" asked T.B. carelessly.</p>

  <p>The proprietor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I do not inquire the name of my patrons," he said, "but I understand that
  it is to be the young Lord Carleby."</p>

  <p>The name told T.B. nothing.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said easily, "I will take a table in the restaurant. I do not
  wish to interrupt a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is not Carleby tonight," the proprietor hastened to assure him. "I
  think mamzelle would prefer that it was&mdash;not; it is a stranger."</p>

  <p>T.B. sauntered into the brilliantly lighted room, having handed his hat
  and coat to a waiter. He found a deserted table. Luck was with him to an
  extraordinary extent; that Sir George should have chosen Meggioli's was the
  greatest good fortune of all</p>

  <p>At that time Count Menshikoff was paying one of his visits to England. The
  master of the St. Petersburg secret police was a responsibility. For his
  protection it was necessary that a small army of men should be detailed, and
  since Meggioli's was the restaurant he favoured, at least one man of the
  Criminal Investigation Department was permanently employed at that
  establishment.</p>

  <p>T.B. called a waiter, and the man came swiftly. He had a large white face,
  big unwinking black eyes, and heavy bushy eyebrows, that stamped his face as
  one out of the common. His name&mdash;which is unimportant&mdash;was Vellair,
  and foreign notabilities his specialty.</p>

  <p>"<i>Soup&mdash;consomm&eacute;</i>, <i>cr&egrave;me de&mdash;</i>"</p>

  <p>T.B., studying his menu, asked quietly, "is it possible to see and hear
  what is going on in No. 3?"</p>

  <p>"The private room?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>The waiter adjusted the table with a soft professional touch. "There is a
  small ante-room, and a ventilator, a table that might be pushed against the
  wall, and a chair," said the waiter, concisely. "If you remain here I will
  make sure."</p>

  <p>He scribbled a mythical order on his little pad and disappeared.</p>

  <p>He came back in five minutes with a small tureen of soup. As he emptied
  its contents into the plate before T.B. he said, "All right; the key is on
  the inside. The door is numbered 11."</p>

  <p>T.B. picked up the wine list. "Cover me when I leave," he said.</p>

  <p>He had finished his soup when the waiter brought him a note. He broke open
  the envelope and read the contents with an expression of annoyance.</p>

  <p>"I shall be back in a few minutes," he said rising; "reserve this
  table."</p>

  <p>The waiter bowed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">XI. &mdash; THE DANCING GIRL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">T.B. reached the second floor. The corridor was deserted; he
  walked quickly to No. 11. The door yielded to his push. He closed it behind
  him and noiselessly locked it. He took a tiny electric lamp from his pocket
  and threw the light cautiously round.</p>

  <p>He found the table and chair placed ready for him, and blessed Vellair
  silently.</p>

  <p>The ventilator was a small one, he had located it easily enough when he
  had entered the room by the gleam of light that came through it. Very
  carefully he mounted the table, stepped lightly on to the chair, and looked
  down into the next chamber.</p>

  <p>It was an ordinary kind of private dining-room. The only light came from
  two shaded electric lamps on the table in the centre.</p>

  <p>Sir George with a frown was regarding his beautiful vis-a-vis. That she
  was lovely beyond ordinary loveliness T.B. knew from repute. He had expected
  the high colourings, the blacks and scarlets of the Andalusian; but this girl
  had the creamy complexion of the well-bred Spaniard, with eyes that might
  have been hazel or violet in the uncertain light, but which were decidedly
  not black. Her lips, now tightly compressed, were neither too full nor too
  thin, her nose straight, her hair, brushed back from her forehead in an
  unfamiliar style, was that exact tint between bronze and brown that your
  connoisseur so greatly values.</p>

  <p>A plain filet of dull gold about her head, and the broad collar of pearls
  around her neck, were the only jewels she displayed. Her dress was black,
  unrelieved by any touch of colour. She was talking rapidly in Spanish, a
  language with which T.B. was very well conversant.</p>

  <p>"...but, Sir George," she pleaded, "it would be horrible, wicked, cruel
  not to see him again!"</p>

  <p>"It would be worse if you saw him," said the other drily. "You know, my
  dear young lady, you would both be miserable in a month. The title would be
  no compensation for you; Carleby would bore you; Carleby House would drive
  you mad; Carleby's relatives would incite you to murder."</p>

  <p>"You are one!" she blazed.</p>

  <p>"Exactly; and do I not exasperate you? Think of me magnified by a hundred.
  Come, come, there are better men than Carleby in the world, and you are
  young, you are little more than a child."</p>

  <p>"But I love him," she sobbed.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you do." T.B. from his hiding-place bestowed an admiring grin
  upon the patronage in the baronet's tone. "When did you meet him first?"</p>

  <p>"Three weeks ago." She spoke with a catch in her voice that affected T.B.
  strangely.</p>

  <p>"That girl is acting," he thought.</p>

  <p>"Three weeks?" mused the banker. "Um&mdash;when did you discover he was a
  relative of mine?"</p>

  <p>"A few days since," she said eagerly. "I was in Cornwall, visiting some
  friends&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cornwall!" T.B. had hard work to suppress an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"and I learned from them that you were related. I did not know of any
  other relation. My friends told me it would be wicked to marry without the
  knowledge of his people. ' Go to Sir George Calliper and explain,' they said;
  'he will help you'; instead of which&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The banker smiled again.</p>

  <p>"Instead of which I pointed out how impossible it was, eh? and persuaded
  you to give up all idea of marrying Carleby. Yes, I suppose you think I am a
  heartless brute."</p>

  <p>She sat with bent head.</p>

  <p>"You will give him my message?" she asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"And the flowers?"</p>

  <p>"And the flowers," he repeated gravely.</p>

  <p>("That clears the banker," thought T.B.)</p>

  <p>"I shall leave for Spain tomorrow. It was good of you to let me have this
  talk."</p>

  <p>"It was good of you to come."</p>

  <p>"Somehow," she said drearily. "I cannot help feeling that it is for the
  best."</p>

  <p>Again T.B. thought he detected a note of insincerity.</p>

  <p>"When will you see him?"</p>

  <p>"Carleby?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>"Not tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"The next day?" '</p>

  <p>T.B. was alert now; he saw in a flash the significance of this interview;
  saw the plot which had lured a foolish relative of Calliper's to a love
  affair; and now, the manoeuvring to the crucial moment of the interview which
  she had so cleverly planned.</p>

  <p>"Nor the next day," smiled Sir George.</p>

  <p>"Well, the next day?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "That is the day of all days I am not likely to leave
  London."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked innocently, her eyes wide open and her lips parted.</p>

  <p>"I have some very important business to transact on that day," he said
  briefly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I forgot," she said, with a hint of awe in her voice. "You're a great
  banker, aren't you?" she smiled. "Oh, yes, Carleby told me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I thought you didn't know about me until your Cornish friends told you?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not that you were related to him," she rejoined quickly, "but he spoke of
  the great house of Bronte&mdash;"</p>

  <p>("Neat," approved the hidden T.B.)</p>

  <p>"So Thursday will be the day," she mused.</p>

  <p>"What day?" the banker's voice was sharp.</p>

  <p>"The day you will see Carleby," she said, with a look of surprise.</p>

  <p>"I said not Thursday on any account, but possibly the next day," said Sir
  George stiffly.</p>

  <p>"She has the information she wants," said T.B. to himself, "and so have
  I," he reflected. "I will now retire."</p>

  <p>He stepped carefully down, and reached the floor, and was feeling his way
  to the door, when a strange noise attracted his attention. It came, not from
  the next room, but from that in which he stood. He stood stock still, holding
  his breath, and the noise he heard was repeated.</p>

  <p>Somebody was in the room with him. Somebody was moving stealthily along
  the wall at the opposite side of the apartment. T.B. waited for a moment to
  locate his man, then leaped noiselessly in the direction of the sound. His
  strong hands grasped a man's shoulder; another instant and his fingers were
  at the spy's throat. "Utter a word and I'll knock your head off!" he hissed.
  No terrible threat when uttered facetiously, but T.B.'s words were the
  reverse to humorous. Retaining a hold of his prisoner he waited until the
  noise of a door closing told him that the diners in the next room had
  departed, then he dragged his man to where he judged the electric light
  switch would be. His fingers found the button, turned it, and the room was
  instantly flooded with light.</p>

  <p>He released the man with a little push, and stood with his back to the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Now, sir," said T.B. virtuously, "will you kindly explain what you mean
  by spying on me?"</p>

  <p>The man was tall and thin. He was under thirty and decently dressed; but
  it was his face that held the detective's attention. It was the face of a man
  in mortal terror&mdash;the eyes staring, the lips tremulous, the cheeks lined
  and seamed like an old man's. He stood blinking in the light for a moment,
  and when he spoke he was incoherent and hoarse.</p>

  <p>"You're T.B. Smith," he croaked. "I know you; I've been wanting to find
  you."</p>

  <p>"Well, you've found me," said the detective grimly.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't looking for you&mdash;now. I'm Hyatt."</p>

  <p>He said this simply enough, and it was the detective 's turn to stare.</p>

  <p>"I'm Hyatt," the man went on; "and I've a communication to make; King's
  evidence; but you've got to hide me!" He came forward and laid his hand on
  the other's arm. "I'm not going to be done in like Moss; it's your
  responsibility, and you'll be blamed if anything happens to me," he almost
  whispered, in his fear. "They've had Moss, and they'll try to have me.
  They've played me false because they thought I'd get to know the day the
  barrage was to be handed over, and spoil their market. They brought me up to
  London, because I'd have found out if I'd been in Cornwall&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Steady, steady!" T.B. checked the man. He was talking at express rate,
  and between terror and wrath was well nigh incomprehensible. "Now, begin at
  the beginning. Who are 'they'?"</p>

  <p>"N.H.C., I told you," snarled the other impatiently. "I knew they were
  going to get the date from the banker. That was Catherine's scheme; she got
  introduced to his nephew so that she might get at the uncle. But I'm giving
  King's evidence. I shall get off, shan't I?"</p>

  <p>His anxiety was pitiable.</p>

  <p>T.B. thought quickiy. Here were two ends to the mystery; which was the
  most important? He decided. This man would keep; the urgent business was to
  prevent Catherine from communicating her news to her friends.</p>

  <p>"Take this card," he said, and scribbled a few words hastily upon a
  visiting-card; "that will admit you to my rooms at the Savoy. Make yourself
  comfortable until I return.</p>

  <p>He gave the man a few directions, piloted him from the restaurant, saw him
  enter a cab, then turned his steps towards Baker Street.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">XII. &mdash; "MARY BROWN"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">PENTONBY MANSIONS are within a stone's throw of Baker Street
  Station. T.B. jumped out of his cab some distance from the great entrance
  hall, and paid the driver. Just before he turned into the vestibule a man
  strolling toward him asked him for a match.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"She came straight from the restaurant and has been inside ten minutes,"
  reported the man ostentatiously lighting his pipe.</p>

  <p>"She hasn't sent a telegram?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I know, no, sir."</p>

  <p>In the vestibule a hall porter sat reading the evening paper.</p>

  <p>"Can I telephone from here?" asked T.B.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the man, and T.B.'s heart sank, for he had overlooked
  this possibility.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have 'phones in every room?" he asked carelessly.</p>

  <p>But the man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," he said; "there is some talk of putting 'em in, but so far this
  'phone in my office is the only one in the building."</p>

  <p>T.B. smiled genially.</p>

  <p>"And I suppose," he said, "that you're bothered day and night with calls
  from tenants?" He waited anxiously for the answer.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes I am, and sometimes I go a whole day without calls. No; today,
  for instance, I haven't had a message since five o'clock."</p>

  <p>T.B. murmured polite surprise and began his ascent of the stairs. So far,
  so good. His business was to prevent the girl communicating with her brother,
  whom he did not doubt now was the agent of the "bears," if not worse.</p>

  <p>He had already formed a plan in his mind.</p>

  <p>Turning at the first landing, he walked briskly along the corridor to the
  left.</p>

  <p>"29,31, 33," he counted, "35, 37. Here we are." The corridor was empty; he
  slipped his skeleton key from his pocket, deftly manipulated it.</p>

  <p>The door opened noiselessly. He was in a dark little hall-way. At the end
  was a door and a gleam of light shone under it. He closed the door behind
  him, stepped softly along the carpeted floor, and his hand was on the handle
  of the further door, when a sweet voice called him by name from the room.</p>

  <p>"Adelante! Se&ntilde;or Smith," it said; and, obeying the summons, T.B.
  entered.</p>

  <p>The room was well, if floridly, furnished; but T.B. had no eyes save for
  the graceful figure lounging in a big wicker chair, a thin cigarette between
  her red lips, and her hands carelessly folded on her lap.</p>

  <p>"Come in," she repeated. "I have been expecting you."</p>

  <p>T.B. bowed slightly.</p>

  <p>"Gregory told me that I should probably receive a visit from you."</p>

  <p>"First," said T.B. gently, "let me relieve you of that ugly toy."</p>

  <p>Before she could realize what was happening, two strong hands seized her
  wrists and lifted them. Then one hand clasped her two, and a tiny pistol that
  lay in her lap was in the detective's possession.</p>

  <p>"Let us talk," said T.B. He laid her tiny pistol on the table, and with
  his thumb raised the safety catch.</p>

  <p>"You are not afraid of a toy pistol!" she scoffed.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid of anything that carries a nickel bullet," he confessed,
  without shame. "I know by experience that your 'toy' throws a shot that
  penetrates an inch of pinewood and comes out on the other side. I cannot
  offer the same resistance as pinewood," he added modestly.</p>

  <p>"I have been warned about you," she said, with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"So you were warned." T.B. was mildly amused and just a trifle annoyed. It
  piqued him to know that whilst, as he thought, he had been working in the
  shadow, he had been under a searchlight.</p>

  <p>"Your excellent brother, I do not doubt," he said.</p>

  <p>"You are&mdash;what do you call it in England?&mdash;smug," she said, "but
  what are you going to do with me!"</p>

  <p>She had let fall her cloak and was again leaning back lazily in the big
  armchair. The question was put in the most matter-of-fact tones.</p>

  <p>"That, you shall see," said T.B. cheerfully. "I am mainly concerned now in
  preventing you from communicating with brother Gregory."</p>

  <p>"It will be rather difficult?" she challenged with a smile. "I am not
  proscribed; my character does not admit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As to your character," said T.B. magnanimously, "we will not go into the
  question. So far as you are concerned, I shall take you into custody on a
  charge of obtaining property by false pretences," said T.B. calmly.</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>"Your name is Mary Brown, and I shall charge you with having obtained the
  sum of &pound;350 by a trick from a West Indian gentleman at Barbadoes last
  March."</p>

  <p>She sprang to her feet, her eyes blazing.</p>

  <p>"You know that is false and ridiculous," she said steadily. "What is the
  meaning of it?"</p>

  <p>T.B. shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Would you prefer that I should charge La Belle Espagna with being an
  accessory to murder?" he asked, with a lift of his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"You could not prove it!" she challenged.</p>

  <p>"Of that I am aware," he said. "I have taken the trouble to trace your
  movements. When these murders were committed you were fulfilling an
  engagement at the "Philharmonic," but you knew of the murder, I'll
  swear&mdash;you are an agent of N.H.C."</p>

  <p>"So it was you who found my handkerchief?"</p>

  <p>"No; a discerning friend of mine is entitled to the discovery&mdash;are
  you ready, Mary Brown?"</p>

  <p>"Wait."</p>

  <p>She stood plucking at her dress nervously. "What good can my arrest do to
  you&mdash;tomorrow it will be known all over the world."</p>

  <p>"There," said T.B., "you are mistaken."</p>

  <p>"To arrest me is to sign your death-warrant&mdash;you must know
  that&mdash;the Nine Men will strike&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>T.B.'s eyes were dancing with excitement.</p>

  <p>"Nine men!" he repeated slowly, "<i>Neuf hommes</i>&mdash;'N.H.' What does
  the 'C' stand for?"</p>

  <p>"That much you will doubtless discover," she said coldly, "but they will
  strike surely and effectively."</p>

  <p>The detective had regained his composure.</p>

  <p>"I'm a bit of a striker myself," he said in English.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">XIII. &mdash; DEPORTATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">T.B. found the Chief Commissioner of Police at his club, and
  unfolded his plan.</p>

  <p>The Chief looked grave.</p>

  <p>"It might very easily lead to a horrible catastrophe if you carry that
  scheme into execution."</p>

  <p>"It might very easily lead to a worse if I don't," said T.B. brutally, "I
  am too young to die. At the worst it can only be a 'police blunder,' such as
  you read about in every evening newspaper that's published," he urged, "and I
  look at the other side of the picture. If this woman communicates with her
  principals, nothing is more certain than that Thursday will see the blowing
  up of the Wady Semlik Barrage. These 'Nine Bears' are operating on the sure
  knowledge that Bronte's Bank is going to break. The stocks they are attacking
  are companies banking with Bronte, and it's ten chances to one they will kill
  Sir George Calliper in order to give an artistic finish to the failure."</p>

  <p>The Commissioner bit his lip thoughtfully. "And," urged T.B. Smith, "the
  N. H. C. will be warned, and bang goes our only chance of bagging the
  lot!"</p>

  <p>The Commissioner smiled.</p>

  <p>"Your language, T.B.!" he deplored; then, "do as you wish&mdash;but what
  about the real Mary Brown?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, she can be sent on next week with apologies. We can get a new warrant
  if necessary."</p>

  <p>"Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"At Bow Street."</p>

  <p>"No; I mean the Spanish lady?"</p>

  <p>T.B. grinned.</p>

  <p>"She's locked up in your office, sir," he said cheerfully.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner said nothing, but T.B. declined to meet his eye.</p>

  <p>At four o'clock the next morning, a woman attendant woke La Belle Espagna
  from a fitful sleep, and a few minutes afterwards T.B., dressed for a journey
  and accompanied by a hard-faced wardress and a detective, came in.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going to take me?" she demanded; but T.B. 's reply was not
  very informing.</p>

  <p>A closed carriage deposited them at Euston in time to catch the early
  morning train.</p>

  <p>In the compartment reserved for her and the wardress&mdash;it was a
  corridor carriage, and T.B. and his man occupied the next
  compartment&mdash;she found a dainty breakfast waiting for her, and a supply
  of literature. She slept the greater part of the journey and woke at the
  jolting of a shunting engine being attached to the carriage.</p>

  <p>"Where are we?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"We're there," was the cryptic reply of the woman attendant.</p>

  <p>She was soon to discover, for when the carriage finally came to a
  standstill and the door was opened, she stepped down on to a wind-swept quay.
  Ahead of her the great white hull of a steamer rose, and before she could
  realize the situation she had been hurried up the sloping gangway on to the
  deck.</p>

  <p>Evidently T.B.'s night had been profitably spent, for he was expected. The
  purser met him.</p>

  <p>"We got your telegrams," he said. "Is this the lady!"</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded.</p>

  <p>The purser led the way down the spacious companion.</p>

  <p>"I have prepared 'C' suite," he said, and ushered the party into a
  beautifully appointed cabin.</p>

  <p>She noticed that a steel grating had been newly fixed to the porthole, but
  that was the only indication of her captivity.</p>

  <p>"I have enlisted the help of the stewardess," said T.B., "and you will
  find all the clothing you are likely to require for the voyage. I am also
  instructed to hand you three hundred pounds. You will find your little
  library well stocked. I, myself," he stated with all the extravagance to
  which the Iberian tongue lends itself, "have denuded my own poor stock of
  Spanish and French novels in order that you might not be dull."</p>

  <p>"I understand that I am to be deported?" she said.</p>

  <p>"That is an excellent understanding," he replied.</p>

  <p>"By what authority?" she demanded. "It is necessary to obtain an order
  from the Court."</p>

  <p>"For the next fourteen days, and until this ship reaches Jamaica, you will
  be Mary Brown, who was formally extradited last Saturday on a charge of
  fraud," said T.B. "If you are wise, you will give no trouble, and nobody on
  board need have an inkling that you are a prisoner. You can enjoy the voyage,
  and at the end&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"At the end?" she asked, seeing that he paused.</p>

  <p>"At the end we shall discover our mistake," said T.B., "and you may
  return."</p>

  <p>"I will summon the captain and demand to be put ashore!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"A very natural request on the part of a prisoner," said T.B.
  meditatively, "but I doubt very much whether it would have any effect upon an
  unimaginative seaman."</p>

  <p>He left her raging.</p>

  <p>For the rest of the day he idled about the ship. The Port Syfyil was due
  to leave at four o'clock, and when the first warning bell had sounded he went
  below to take his leave.</p>

  <p>He found her much calmer.</p>

  <p>"I would like to ask one question," she said. "It is not like the police
  to provide me with money, and to reserve such a cabin as this for my
  use&mdash;who is behind this?"</p>

  <p>"I wondered whether you would ask that," said T.B. "Sir George was very
  generous&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sir George Calliper!" she gasped. "You have not dared&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it needed some daring," admitted T.B., "to wake an eminent banker
  out of his beauty sleep to relate such a story as I had to tell&mdash;but he
  was very nice about it."</p>

  <p>She brooded for some moments.</p>

  <p>"You will be sorry for this," she said. "The Nine Men will know much
  sooner than you imagine."</p>

  <p>"Before they know this, they will know other things," he said. And with
  this cryptic utterance he left her.</p>

  <p>He stood watching the great steamer moving slowly down the Mersey. He had
  left the wardress on board to make the voyage, and the other detective had
  remained to report.</p>

  <p>As the vessel swung round a bend of the Mersey out of sight, he murmured
  flippantly:</p>

  <p>"Next stop&mdash;Jamaica!"</p>

  <p>T.B. reached his chambers at noon that day. He stopped to ask a question
  of the porter.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said that worthy, "he arrived all right with your card last
  night. I made him comfortable for the night, got him some supper, and told my
  mate who is on duty at night to look after him."</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded. Declining the lift-boy's services, he mounted the marble
  stairs.</p>

  <p>He reached the door of his flat and inserted the key.</p>

  <p>"Now for Mr. Hyatt," he thought, and opened the door.</p>

  <p>There was a little hall-way to his chambers, in which the electric light
  still burned, in spite of the flood of sunlight that came from a long window
  at the end.</p>

  <p>"Extravagant beggar!" muttered T.B.</p>

  <p>The dining-room was empty, and the blinds were drawn, and here, too, the
  electric light was full on. There was a spare bedroom to the left, and to
  this T.B. made his way.</p>

  <p>He threw open the door.</p>

  <p>"Hyatt!" he called; but there was no answer, and he entered.</p>

  <p>Hyatt lay on the bed, fully dressed. The handle of a knife protruded from
  his breast, and T.B., who understood these things, knew that the man had been
  dead for many hours.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">XIV. &mdash; WHEN THE MARKET ROSE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CONSOLS were up.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt whatever about that fact, and the industrial market was
  a humming hive of industry.</p>

  <p>Breweries, bakeries, and candlestick makeries&mdash;their shares bounded
  joyously as though a spirit, as of early spring had entered into these
  inanimate and soulless things.</p>

  <p>The mysterious "bears" were buying, buying, buying.</p>

  <p>Frantically, recklessly buying,</p>

  <p>Whatever coup had been contemplated by the Nine Men had failed, and their
  agents and brokers were working at fever heat to cover their losses.</p>

  <p>It is significant that on the morning the boom started, there appeared in
  all the early editions of the evening newspapers one little paragraph. It
  appeared in the "late news" space and was condensed:</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Wady Barrage was handed over to Egyptian Government
  early this morning in presence of Minister of Works. Overnight rumours were
  prevalent that attempt made to destroy section dam by dynamite and that
  Italian named Soccori shot dead by sentry of West Kent Regiment in act of
  placing explosives on works. No official confirmation."</p>

  <p>Interesting enough, but hardly to be associated by the crowd which
  thronged the approaches of the House with the rising market.</p>

  <p>All day long the excitement in the City continued, all day long
  bare-headed clerks ran aimlessly&mdash;to all appearances&mdash;from 'Change
  to pavement, from pavement to 'Change, like so many agitated ants.</p>

  <p>Sir George Calliper, sitting alone in the magnificence of his private
  office, watched the "boom" thoughtfully, and wondered exactly what would have
  happened if "an Italian named Soccori" had succeeded in placing his
  explosive.</p>

  <p>The echoes of the boom came to T.B. Smith in his little room overlooking
  the Thames Embankment, but brought him little satisfaction. The Nine Men had
  failed this time. Would they fail on the next occasion?</p>

  <p>Who they were he could guess. From what centre they operated, he neither
  knew nor guessed. For T.B. they had taken on a new aspect. Hitherto they had
  been regarded merely as a band of dangerous and clever swindlers, Napoleonic
  in their method; now, they were murderers&mdash;dangerous, devilish men,
  without pity or remorse.</p>

  <p>The man Moss by some accident had been associated with them&mdash;a tool
  perhaps, but a tool who had surprised their secret. He was not the type of
  man who, of his own intelligence, would have made discoveries. He mentioned
  Hyatt and "the man on the Eiffel Tower." That might have been the wanderings
  of a dying man, but Hyatt had come to light.</p>

  <p>Hyatt, with his curiously intellectual face; here, thought T.B., was the
  man, if any, who had unearthed the secret of the Nine.</p>

  <p>Likely enough he shared confidence with Moss; indeed, there was already
  evidence in T.B.'s hands that the two men had business dealings. And the
  third&mdash;"the man on the Eiffel Tower"? Here T.B. came against a wall of
  improbability. His report to the Chief Commissioner deserves quotation on the
  point.</p>

  <p>"Hyatt occupied rooms in Albany Street," he wrote. "So far as we have been
  able to ascertain, he paid rare visits to London. His landlady thought he
  came from the South of England, but could give me no reason for this
  supposition. He paid &pound;2 a week for his chambers, and although, as I say, he
  was seldom in London, he kept these rooms on, which leads to the assumption
  that he was a man of some means. The only documents we found in our search
  were two penny memorandum books, filled with notes regarding share
  transactions. Hyatt seems to have speculated very heavily and very
  successfully, and it is significant that he participated in all the big 'Nine
  Men' operations.</p>

  <p>"I found a bag with two hotel labels half obliterated. One of these is
  unquestionably the label of the Hotel de Calais in the Eue de Capucines, and
  the other is the representation of a white ensign. Comparing this with the
  hotel labels indexed on the Record Department at Scotland Yard, I am led to
  the belief that it was affixed at the Grand Hotel, Gibraltar. It is a fact,
  as you know, that amongst the possessions of Moss we discovered a hand-bag
  with a Paris label, but in these two bags there is a more important clue.
  There is affixed to both a 'Repository' label&mdash;that is, the label of a
  French cloak-room.</p>

  <p>"In the case of Moss the number of the ticket is '01795,' on Hyatt's bag
  there is still discernible '&mdash;796.' From this we know that not only were
  the two men in Paris at the same time, but that they arrived by the same
  train, and going together to the depository, left their bags&mdash;which were
  numbered consecutively.</p>

  <p>"I am now, therefore, inclined to take a more serious view of the
  statement made by Moss before he died. His words were, you
  remember&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Get Hyatt or the man on the Eiffel Tower. His sister's got the
  book&mdash;Hyatt's sister down in Falmouth.'</p>

  <p>"Then he went on to say that 'the Admiralty would fix it for you.'</p>

  <p>"At the time I thought the poor chap was raving; but Hyatt is a fact, and
  we are now searching for his sister and this 'book' of his. As to the
  reference to the Admiralty, I confess I am stumped, for nobody at Whitehall
  has ever heard of Hyatt.</p>

  <p>"There remains the man on the Eiffel Tower. Who was he, or is he? A theory
  advanced by Elk is that he is a man casually met; some acquaintance made in
  the course of a morning's sight-seeing. If this is so, the business of
  discovering his identity promises to be an extremely difficult one. We have
  communicated with Lepine in Paris, but naturally the little man wants
  something more tangible, more definite than the description we have been able
  to give him... In the meantime I have had Hyatt's body removed, and so far
  nothing has got into the papers about that murder. We must issue a statement
  tonight, if the fact does not leak out before. By the way, Silinski, the man
  I referred to in my minute of the 10th, was under observation at the time of
  the murder, and the detective engaged in shadowing him informs me that it is
  impossible that he could have been implicated."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">XV. &mdash; IN THE "JOURNAL" OFFICE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE room was a long one, full of dazzling islands of light
  where shaded lamps above the isolated sub-editors' desks threw their white
  circles. This room, too, was smirched with black shadows; there were odd
  corners where light never came. It never shone upon the big bookcase over the
  mantelpiece, or in the corner behind the man who conned the foreign
  exchanges, or on the nest of pigeon holes over against the chief "sub."</p>

  <p>When he would refer to these he must needs emerge blinking from the
  blinding light in which he worked and go groping in the darkness for the
  needed memorandum.</p>

  <p>He was sitting at his desk now, intent upon his work.</p>

  <p>At his elbow stood a pad, on which he wrote from time to time.</p>

  <p>Seemingly his task was an aimless one. He wrote nothing save the neat
  jottings upon his pad. Bundles of manuscript came to him, blue books,
  cuttings from other newspapers; these he looked at rather than read, looked
  at them in a hard, strained fashion, put them in this basket or that, as the
  fancy seized him, chose another bundle, stared at it, fluttered the leaves
  rapidly and so continued. He had the appearance of a man solving some puzzle,
  piecing together intricate parts to make one comprehensive whole. When he
  hesitated, as he sometimes did, and seemed momentarily doubtful as to which
  basket a manuscript should be consigned, you felt the suggestion of mystery
  with which his movements were enveloped, and held your breath. When he had
  decided upon the basket, you hoped for the best, but wondered vaguely what
  would have happened if he had chosen the other.</p>

  <p>Once he leaned back and dived into the darkness. When he came back to
  light his hand held a little book, carefully indexed and filled with written
  notes.</p>

  <p>He glanced dubiously at a bundle of copy before him, opened the book at
  "E," ran his finger down the page, turned the page over, made another search,
  and frowned.</p>

  <p>Elling was there: George Elling, who sold the <i>Journal</i> a story about
  a suicide that had never happened. He had derived a fairly comfortable and
  regular income from reporting mythical happenings till the <i>Journal</i>
  sent a special man to investigate. Then the fraud was detected and "our own
  correspondent" at Gravesport was "fired," and his name and the record of his
  infamy entered in the little book with the green covers. Edwards was there
  too. Edwards had written a little pamphlet attacking "The Office"&mdash;a
  vulgarly abusive, hysterical, foolish, and illogical little pamphlet, in
  which personal grievances and incoherent appeals to the sanity of the country
  were hopelessly interwoven. Essard was there, on the second page of the
  "E's." No crime stood against his name, but the chief sub. smiled faintly as
  he passed the name, for Essard had once dared to contribute a paragraph with
  a "business end." In other words, the wretched Essard had had the temerity to
  write under the guise of a news-story, the most barefaced advertisement of a
  firm of engineers, thereby wickedly, maliciously, and feloniously attempting
  to deprive the directors and shareholders of the Amalgamated Newspapers,
  Limited, of their just and proper revenue.</p>

  <p>But the sub-editor sought in vain for the name of the man under review. He
  closed the book and looked across the table to his assistant.</p>

  <p>"Who is Escoltier?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The assistant looked up.</p>

  <p>"Escoltier? Never heard of the gentleman. What has he done?"</p>

  <p>"Is he barred?"</p>

  <p>"Barred&mdash;Escoltier?" This was a serious question and not to be
  treated with flippancy. "No, I can't remember Escoltier&mdash;rum
  name&mdash;being barred; in fact, I can't remember Escoltier."</p>

  <p>The chief sub. stared at the manuscript on the desk before him.</p>

  <p>He shook his head; hesitated, then dropped it into basket three.</p>

  <p>The door that opened into the tape-room was swinging constantly now, for
  it wanted twenty minutes to eleven. Five tickers chattered incessantly, and
  there was a constant procession of agency boys and telegraph messengers
  passing in and out the vestibule of the silent building. And the pneumatic
  tubes that ran from the front hall to the subs', room hissed and exploded
  periodically, and little leathern carriers rattled into the wire basket at
  the chief sub's elbow.</p>

  <p>News! news! news!</p>

  <p>A timber fire at Rotherhithe; the sudden rise in Consols; the Sultan of
  Turkey grants an amnesty to political offenders; a man kills his wife at
  Wolverhampton; a woman cyclist run down by a motor-car; the Bishop of Elford
  denounces Nonconformists...</p>

  <p>News for tomorrow's breakfast table; intellectual stimulant for the weary
  people who are even now kicking off their shoes with a sleepy yawn and
  wondering whether there will be anything in the paper tomorrow.</p>

  <p>News to be carried by fast expresses north, east, south, and west. The
  history of the world for one day, told by eye-witnesses, recorded by expert
  reporters, telegraphed, telephoned, mailed, and written in the office at
  first hand.</p>

  <p>A boy came flying through the swing door of the tape-room, carrying in his
  hand a slip of paper.</p>

  <p>He laid it before the chief sub.</p>

  <p>That restless man looked at it, then looked at the clock.</p>

  <p>"Take it to Mr. Greene," he said shortly, and reached for the
  speaking-tube that connected him with the printer.</p>

  <p>"There will be a three-column splash on page five," he said, in a
  matter-of-fact voice.</p>

  <p>"What's up!" His startled assistant was on his feet.</p>

  <p>"A man found murdered in T.B. Smith's chambers," he said.</p>

  <p>The inquest was over, the stuffy little court discharged its morbid
  public, jurymen gathered in little knots on the pavement permitted themselves
  to theorize, feeling, perhaps, that the official verdict of "murder against
  some person or persons unknown," needed amplification.</p>

  <p>"My own opinion is," said the stout foreman, "that nobody could have done
  it, except somebody who could have got into his chambers unknown."</p>

  <p>"That's my opinion, too," said another juryman.</p>

  <p>"I should have liked to add a rider," the foreman went on, "something like
  this: 'We call the coroner's attention to the number of undiscovered murders
  nowadays, and severly censure the police,' but he wouldn't have it."</p>

  <p>"They 'ang together," said a gloomy little man; "p'lice and coroners and
  doctors, they 'ang together, there's corruption somewhere. I've always said
  it."</p>

  <p>"Here's a feller murdered," the foreman went on, "in a detective's room,
  the same detective that's in charge of the Moss murder. We're told his name's
  Hyatt, we're told he was sent to that room by the detective whilst he's
  engaged in some fanciful business in the north&mdash;is that sense?"</p>

  <p>"Then there's the <i>Journal</i>" interrupted the man of gloom, "it comes
  out this mornin' with a cock an' bull story about these two murders being
  connected with the slump&mdash;why, there ain't any slump! The market went up
  the very day this chap Hyatt was discovered."</p>

  <p>"Sensation," said the foreman, waving deprecating hands, "newspaper
  sensation. Any lie to sell the newspapers, that's their motto."</p>

  <p>The conversation ended abruptly, as T.B. Smith appeared at the entrance to
  the court. His face was impassive, his attire, as usual, immaculate, but
  those who knew him best detected signs of worry.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake," he said to a young man who approached him, "don't
  talk to me now&mdash;you beggar, your wretched rag has upset all my
  plans."</p>

  <p>"But, Mr. Smith," pleaded the reporter, "what we said was true, wasn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"A lie that is half the truth," quoted T.B. solemnly.</p>

  <p>"But it is true&mdash;there is some connection between the murders and the
  slump, and, I say, do your people know anything about the dancing girl from
  the Philharmonic?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, child of sin!" T.B. shook his head reprovingly. "Oh, collector of
  romance!"</p>

  <p>"One last question," said the reporter. "Do you know a man named
  Escoltier?"</p>

  <p>"Not," said T.B. flippantly, "from a crow&mdash;why? Is he suspected of
  abducting your dancing lady!"</p>

  <p>"No," said the reporter, "he's suspected of pulling our editor's leg."</p>

  <p>T.B. was all this time walking away from the Court, and the reporter kept
  step with him.</p>

  <p>"And what is the nature of his hoax?" demanded T.B.</p>

  <p>He was not anxious for information, but be was very desirous of talking
  about nothing&mdash;it had been a trying day for him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the usual thing; wants to tell us the greatest crime that ever
  happened&mdash;a great London crime that the police have not discovered."</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said T.B. politely, "wants payment in advance?"</p>

  <p>"No, that's the curious thing about it," said the reporter. "All he wants
  is protection."</p>

  <p>T.B. stopped dead and faced the young man. He dropped the air of boredom
  right away.</p>

  <p>"Protection?" he said quickly, "from whom?"</p>

  <p>"That is just what he doesn't say&mdash;in fact, he's rather vague on that
  point&mdash;why don't you go up and see Delawn, the editor!"</p>

  <p>T.B. thought a moment.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he nodded. "That is an idea. For the moment, however, I have
  engaged myself to meet another gentleman who may throw a light upon many
  matters which are at present obscure."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">XVI. &mdash; SILINSKI IS INTERVIEWED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was no apparent connection between Homborgstrasse 22,
  Berlin, and No. 14, Rue de Cent, Paris, nor between the big, barren-looking
  house in the Calle de Recoletos in Madrid and 375, St. John Street, W.C. Nor,
  for the matter of that, between the little house perched upon one of the
  seven hills overlooking the Tagus and the pension near Nevski Prospekt in
  Petersburg.</p>

  <p>One feature they had in common, and that was a stout flagstaff, upon which
  on festal days fluttered the flag of the respective nations.</p>

  <p>Silinski, who was responsible, for the hiring or purchasing of all these
  properties, could have told you another connection less apparent, but
  Silinski was a notoriously silent man, and said little or nothing.</p>

  <p>He sat in his well-furnished study in St. John Street, and round him and
  about was evidence of his refinement and taste. Rare prints hung on the wall,
  the furniture was sombrely magnificent, the carpet beneath his feet soft and
  thick and of sober hue, the desk before him such an one as a successful man
  of letters might affect.</p>

  <p>There were photographs of eminent personages, kings, statesmen,
  ambassadors, great prima donnas. Some of these were autographed "a cher
  Silinski"; some were framed in silver, and, in the case of royalties,
  surmounted by tiny gilt crowns.</p>

  <p>Silinski had never met royalty in his life, though he had once robbed a
  grand duke at Monte Carlo, and the autographs and loving messages written
  upon the purchased photographs were in Silinski's own hand, though this fact
  was not generally known. This was Silinski's weakness; many a greater man has
  shared it.</p>

  <p>There came a gentle tap at his door and a man entered.</p>

  <p>"Well?" demanded Silinski suavely.</p>

  <p>"The police, illustrious," said the man in Spanish, and with no particular
  sign of agitation.</p>

  <p>Silinski nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"Admit," he said, and in a few seconds T.B. Smith walked into the
  room.</p>

  <p>"And what is your pleasure, gentlemen!" demanded Silinski.</p>

  <p>"Little enough, Silinski," said the other blandly. He looked round as
  though seeking a comfortable chair. In reality he was taking a rapid survey
  of the apartment. "I have a few questions to ask you."</p>

  <p>Silinski bowed, and motioned the Assistant-Commissioner to a seat.</p>

  <p>"It is my misfortune," he said, leaning back in his chair and crossing his
  legs, "that I have incurred your enmity; none the less, it will give me the
  greatest pleasure to afford you such assistance as lies in my power."</p>

  <p>T.B. smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"You have incurred nobody's enmity, as I understand the situation," he
  said. He looked again round the room. "You are very comfortably
  circumstanced, Silinski."</p>

  <p>"Fortune has been kind," said the Pole suavely.</p>

  <p>"One successful speculation," mused T.B. aloud, "might found the fortunes
  of such a man as you."</p>

  <p>"I am no speculator," said the other hastily. "It is too risky&mdash;I do
  not approve of gambling."</p>

  <p>"Yet you had dealings with Moss?"</p>

  <p>"Investments, m'sieur&mdash;not speculations."</p>

  <p>"And with Hyatt?"</p>

  <p>"As to Hyatt&mdash;I do not know him. I have never heard of him."</p>

  <p>"And the man," T.B. paused, "from the&mdash;er&mdash;Eiffel Tower?"</p>

  <p>Perhaps Silinski's face grew a shade whiter, and the lines about his mouth
  hardened.</p>

  <p>"These riddles you set me are beyond my understanding," he said harshly.
  In a moment, however, he had recovered his equanimity.</p>

  <p>"You are much too clever for me, Mr. Smith," he said, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"There is a fourth person who would seem to be in some way associated with
  your complicated financial affairs," T.B. resumed. "Do you know a Monsieur
  Escoltier?"</p>

  <p>Silinski sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Fourth person&mdash;M'sieur Escoltier?" he stammered. "What do you mean?
  I tell you, you are speaking in riddles. I do not understand you&mdash;I do
  not wish to understand you." His voice grew louder and louder as he spoke.
  His energy seemed out of all proportion to the importance of the topic, and
  T.B. knit his brows in perplexity.</p>

  <p>Then he suddenly sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" he said, "stop talking! You are bellowing because something is
  happening in this house that you do not wish me to hear&mdash;stop!"</p>

  <p>But the frenzy of the Pole rose. He roared indignant, unintelligible
  protestations; he shouted denunciations of police espionage.</p>

  <p>T.B., with bent head and every sense alert, stood before him. Through the
  flood of impassioned words he detected the sound; it was a noise strangely
  like the rattling of dried peas in a tin can.</p>

  <p>Then as suddenly as he began, Silinski ceased, and the two men faced one
  another in silence.</p>

  <p>"Silinski," said T.B. at last, "before God, I believe you are a wicked
  murderer."</p>

  <p>"Then arrest me," challenged the man; "call in the police who have been
  watching this house day and night since the death of Moss. Arrest me, as you
  did my sister!"</p>

  <p>T.B. had all his work to suppress the exclamation of surprise that came to
  his lips.</p>

  <p>"Extradite me under a false name, as you did her," sneered Silinski;
  "carry me up to Liverpool in the dead of night and smuggle me on board a West
  Indian steamer."</p>

  <p>"I am not as a rule a curious man," said T.B. slowly, "but I must confess
  that I should like to know where you secured all these valuable data."</p>

  <p>"Pooh!"</p>

  <p>It was the old Silinski who paced the floor and snapped his
  fingers&mdash;the Silinski assured, arrogant, the hint of a swagger in his
  walk.</p>

  <p>"You think, you English police, that the world goes blind at your command.
  My friend"&mdash;he stopped and pointed a lean forefinger at the
  other&mdash;"I can tell you many things. The hour you left London, the hour
  you arrived, the number of the state-room in which you placed my poor,
  ill-used sister; your very words to her at parting."</p>

  <p>He stopped, biting his lips; he had said too much, and he knew it. In the
  enjoyment of puzzling an astute member of a profession regarded by him as
  made up of his natural enemies, he had allowed boastfulness to outrun
  discretion.</p>

  <p>"So you know my last words to her," repeated T.B., more slowly than ever,
  "although she and I were alone, although a thousand miles of sea separate you
  at this moment. I see."</p>

  <p>He said no more, but with a slight nod, and without any further talk, he
  descended the stairs that led to the big entrance-hall, and Silinski, pulling
  nervously at his moustache, heard the great door of the house close behind
  him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17">XVII. &mdash; THE MAN FROM THE EIFFEL TOWER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN the holy of holies, the inner room within the inner room,
  wherein the editor of the <i>London Morning Journal</i> saw those visitors
  who were privileged to pass the outer portal, T.B. Smith sat, a sorely
  puzzled man, a scrap of disfigured paper in his hands.</p>

  <p>He read it again and looked up at the editor.</p>

  <p>"This might, of course, be a fake," he said.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't read like a fake," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Admitting your authority on the subject of fakes, Tom," said
  T.B.,&mdash;they were members of the same club, which fact in itself is a
  license for rudeness&mdash;"I am still in the dark. Why does this&mdash;what
  is his name!"</p>

  <p>"Escoltier."</p>

  <p>"Why does this man Escoltier write to a newspaper, instead of coming
  straight to the police!"</p>

  <p>"Because he is, a Frenchman, I should imagine," said the editor. "The
  French have the newspaper instinct more highly developed than the
  English."</p>

  <p>T.B. looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Will he come, do you think&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I have wired to him," said the editor.</p>

  <p>T.B. read the paper again. It was written in execrable English, but its
  purport was clear.</p>

  <p>The writer could solve the mystery of Hyatt's death, and, for the matter
  of that, of the Moss murder.</p>

  <p>T.B. read it and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"This sort of thing is fairly common," he said; "there never was a bad
  murder yet, but what the Yard received solutions by the score."</p>

  <p>A little bell tinkled on the editor's desk, and he took up the receiver of
  the telephone.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" he said, and listened. Then, "Send him up."</p>

  <p>"Is it&mdash;?&raquo;</p>

  <p>"M. Escoltier," said the editor.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later the door was opened, and a man was ushered into the
  room. Short and thickset, with a two days ' growth of beard on his chin, his
  nationality was apparent long before he spoke in the argot of the lowly-born
  Parisian.</p>

  <p>His face was haggard, his eyes heavy from lack of sleep, and the hand that
  strayed to his mouth shook tremulously.</p>

  <p>"I have to tell you," he began, "about M'sieur Moss and M'sieur Hyatt."
  His voice was thick, and as he spoke he glanced from side to side as though
  fearful of observation. There was something in his actions that vividly
  reminded the detective of his interview with Hyatt. "You understand," the man
  went on incoherently, "that I had long suspected N. H. C.&mdash;it was always
  so unintelligible. There was no such station and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You must calm yourself, monsieur," said T.B., speaking in French; "begin
  at the beginning, for as yet my friend and myself are entirely in the dark.
  What is N.H.C., and what does it mean?" It was some time before the man could
  be brought to a condition of coherence. The editor pushed him gently to the
  settee that ran the length of the bay window of his office.</p>

  <p>"Wait," said the journalist, and unlocking a drawer, he produced a silver
  flask.</p>

  <p>"Drink some of this," he said.</p>

  <p>The man raised the brandy to his lips with a hand that shook violently,
  and drank eagerly.</p>

  <p>"<i>C'est bien</i>," he muttered, and looked from one to the other.</p>

  <p>"I tell you this story because I am afraid to go to the police&mdash;they
  are watching the police office&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In the first place, who are you?" demanded T.B.</p>

  <p>"As to who and what I am," said the stranger, nodding his head to
  emphasize his words, "it would be better that I should remain silent."</p>

  <p>"I do not see the necessity," said the detective calmly. " So far as I can
  judge from what information I have, you are a French soldier&mdash;an
  engineer. You are a wireless telegraph operator, and your post of duty is on
  the Eiffel Tower."</p>

  <p>The man stared at the speaker, and his jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"M'sieur!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"Hyatt was also a wireless operator; probably in the employ of the Marconi
  Company in the West of England. Between you, you surprised the secret of a
  mysterious agency which employs wireless installations to communicate with
  its agents. What benefits you yourself may have derived from your discovery I
  cannot say. It is certain that Hyatt, operating through Moss, made a small
  fortune; it is equally certain that, detecting a leakage, the 'Nine Men' have
  sent a clever agent to discover the cause&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the man from the Eiffel Tower had fainted.</p>

  <p>"I shall rely on you to keep the matter an absolute secret until we are
  ready," said T.B., and the editor nodded. "I tumbled to the whole scheme when
  a gentleman, who shall be nameless, boasted to me that he knew certain things
  which it was not humanly possible for him to know&mdash;until I remembered
  that a certain ship was fitted with wireless telegraphy. Then it came to me
  in a flash. The Eiffel Tower! Who lives on the Eiffel Tower? Telegraph
  operators. Our friend is recovering."</p>

  <p>He looked down at the pallid man lying limply in an armchair.</p>

  <p>"I am anxious to know what brings him to London. Fright, I suppose. It was
  the death of Moss that brought Hyatt, the killing of Hyatt that produced
  Monsieur Escoltier."</p>

  <p>The telegraphist recovered consciousness with a shiver and a groan. For a
  quarter of an hour he sat with his face hidden in his hands. Another pull at
  the editor's flask aroused him to tell his story&mdash;a narrative which is
  valuable as being the first piece of definite evidence laid against the Nine
  Bears.</p>

  <p>He began hesitatingly, but as the story of his complicity was unfolded he
  warmed to his task. With the true Gaul's love for the dramatic, he declaimed
  with elaborate gesture and sonorous phrase the part he had played.</p>

  <p>"My name is Jules Escoltier, I am a telegraphist in the corps of
  Engineers. On the establishment of the wireless telegraphy station on the
  Eiffel Tower in connection with the Casa Blanca affair, I was appointed one
  of the operators. Strange as it may sound, one does not frequently intercept
  messages, but I was surprised a year ago to find myself taking code
  dispatches from a station which called itself 'N.H.C.' There is no such
  station known, so far as I am aware, and copies of the dispatches which I
  forwarded to my superiors were always returned to me as 'non-decodable.'</p>

  <p>"One day I received a message in English, which I can read. It
  ran&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'All those who know N.H.C. call H.A.'</p>

  <p>"Although I did not know who N.H.C. was, I had the curiosity to look up
  H.A. on the telegraph map, and found it was the Cornish Marconi Station.
  Taking advantage of the absence of my officer, I sent a wireless message, 'I
  desire information, L.L.' That is not the Paris 'indicator,' but I knew that
  I should get the reply. I had hardly sent the message when another message
  came. It was from Monsieur Hyatt. I got the message distinctly&mdash;'Can you
  meet me in London on the 9th, Gallini's Restaurant! To this I replied, 'No,
  impossible.' After this I had a long talk with the Cornishman, and then it
  was that he told me that his name was Hyatt. He told me that he was able to
  decode the N.H.C.. messages, that he had a book, and that it was possible to
  make huge sums of money for the information contained in them. I thought that
  it was very indiscreet to speak so openly, and told him so.</p>

  <p>"He asked me for my name, and I gave it, and thereafter I regularly
  received letters from him, and a correspondence began.</p>

  <p>"Not being <i>au fait</i> in matters affecting the Bourse, I did not know
  of what value the information we secured from N.H.C. could be, but Hyatt said
  he had a friend who was interested in such matters, and that if I 'took off'
  all N.H.C. messages that I got, and repeated them to him, I should share in
  the proceeds. I was of great value to Hyatt, because I received messages that
  never reached him. In this way he was able to keep in touch with all the
  operations in which N.H.C. were engaged.</p>

  <p>"By arrangement, we met in Paris&mdash;Hyatt, his friend of the London
  Bourse (Monsieur Moss), and myself, and Hyatt handed to me notes for 20,000
  francs (&pound;800); that was the first payment I received from him. He returned to
  England, and things continued in very much the same way as they had done, I
  receiving and forwarding N.H.C.. messages. I never understood any of them,
  but Hyatt was clever, and he had discovered the code and worked it out.</p>

  <p>"About a fortnight ago I received from him 3,000 francs in notes, a letter
  that spoke of a great coup contemplated by K H. C. 'If this materializes, he
  wrote, 'I hope to send you half a million francs by the end of next
  week.'</p>

  <p>"The next morning I received this message&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He fumbled in his pocket and produced a strip of paper, on which was
  hastily scrawled&mdash;</p>

  <p>"From N.H.C. to L.L. Meet me in London on the sixth, Charing Cross
  Station."</p>

  <p>"It was, as you see, in French, and as it came I scribbled it down. I
  would have ignored it, but that night I got a message from Hyatt saying that
  N.H.C.. had discovered we shared their secret and had offered to pay us
  &pound;5,000 each to preserve silence, and that as they would probably alter the
  code I should be a fool not to accept. So I got leave of absence and bought a
  suit of clothing, left Paris, and arrived in London the following night. A
  dark young man who said his name was Silinski met me at the station, and
  invited me to come home with him.</p>

  <p>"He had a motor-car at the entrance of the station, and after some
  hesitation I accepted. We drove through the streets filled with people, for
  the theatres were just emptying, and after an interminable ride we reached
  the open country. Silinski drove the car and I was the only other occupant. I
  asked him where was Hyatt, and where we were going, but he refused to speak.
  When I pressed him, he informed me he was taking me to a rendezvous near the
  sea.</p>

  <p>"We had been driving for close on three hours, when we reached a lonely
  lane. By the lights of the car I could see a steep hill before us, and I
  could hear the roar of the waves somewhere ahead.</p>

  <p>"Suddenly he threw a lever over, and as the car bounded forward, he sprang
  to the ground with a mocking laugh.</p>

  <p>"Before I could realize what had happened, the machine was flying down the
  steep gradient, rocking from side to side.</p>

  <p>"I have sufficient knowledge of motor-car engineering to manipulate a car,
  and I at once sprang to the wheel and felt for the brake. But both foot and
  hand brake were useless. In some manner he had contrived to disconnect
  them.</p>

  <p>"It was pitch dark, and all that I could hope to do was to keep the car to
  the centre of the road. Instinctively I knew that I was rushing to certain
  death, and, messieurs, I was! I was flying down a steep gradient to
  inevitable destruction, for at the bottom of the hill the road turned
  sharply, and confronting me, although I did not know this, was a stone sea
  wall.</p>

  <p>"I resolved on taking my life in my hands, and putting the car at one of
  the steep banks which ran on either side, I turned the steering wheel and
  shut my eyes. I expected instant death. Instead, the car bounded up at an
  angle that almost threw me from my seat. I heard the crash of wood, and
  flying splinters struck my neck, and the next thing I remember was a series
  of bumps as the car jolted over a ploughed field.</p>

  <p>"I had achieved the impossible. At the point I had chosen to leave the
  road was a gate leading to a field, and by an act of Providence, I had found
  the only way of escape.</p>

  <p>"I found myself practically at the very edge of the sea, and in my first
  terror I would have given every sou I had to escape to France. All night long
  I waited by the broken car, and with the dawn some peasants came and told me
  I was only five miles distant from Dover. I embraced the man who told me
  this, and would have hired a conveyance to drive me to Dover, en route for
  France. I knew that N.H.C.. could trace me, and then I was anxious to get in
  touch with Hyatt and Moss. Then it was that I saw in an English newspaper
  that Moss was dead."</p>

  <p>He stopped and moistened his lips.</p>

  <p>"M'sieur!" he went on, with a characteristic gesture, "I decided that I
  would come to London and find Hyatt. I took train, but I was watched. At a
  little junction called Sandgate, a man sauntered past my carriage. I did not
  know him, he looked like an Italian. As the train left the station something
  smashed the window, and I heard a thud. There was no report, but I knew that
  I had been fired at with an air-gun, for the bullet I found embedded in the
  woodwork of the carriage."</p>

  <p>"Did nothing further happen?" asked T.B.</p>

  <p>"Nothing till I reached Charing Cross; then when I stopped to ask a
  policeman to direct me to the Central Police Bureau I saw a man pass me in a
  motor-car, eyeing me closely. It was Silinski."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"Then I saw my danger. I was afraid of the police. I saw a newspaper
  sheet. It was a great newspaper&mdash;I wrote a letter&mdash;and sought
  lodgings in a little hotel near the river. There was no answer to my letter.
  I waited in hiding for two days before I realized that I had given no
  address. I wrote again. All this time I have been seeking Hyatt. I have
  telegraphed to Cornwall, but the reply comes that he is not there. Then in
  the newspaper I learn of his death. M'sieur, I am afraid."</p>

  <p>He wiped the drops of sweat from his forehead with a shaky hand.</p>

  <p>He was indeed in a pitiable condition of fright, and T.B., upon whose
  nerves the mysterious "bears" were already beginning to work, appreciated his
  fear without sharing it.</p>

  <p>There came a knock at the outer door of the office, and the editor moved
  to answer it.</p>

  <p>There was a whispered conversation at the door, the door closed again, and
  the editor returned with raised brows.</p>

  <p>"T.B." he said, "that wretched market has gone again."</p>

  <p>"Gone?"</p>

  <p>"Gone to blazes! Spanish fours are so low that you'd get a pain in your
  back if you stooped to pick them up."</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'll use your telephone," he said, and stooped over the desk. He called
  for a number and after an interval&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;that you, Mainland? Go to 375 St. John Street, and take into
  custody Gregory Silinski on a charge of murder. Take with you fifty men and
  surround the place. Detain every caller, and every person you find in the
  house."</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Now, my friend," he said in French, "what shall we do with you?"</p>

  <p>The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders listlessly.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter?" he said, "they will have me&mdash;it is only a
  matter of hours."</p>

  <p>"I take a brighter view," said T.B. cheerily; "you shall walk with us to
  Scotland Yard and there you shall be taken care of."</p>

  <p>But the Frenchman shrunk back.</p>

  <p>"Come, there is no danger," smiled T.B.</p>

  <p>Reluctantly the engineer accompanied the detective and the editor from the
  building. A yellow fog lay like a damp cloth over London, and the Thames
  Embankment was almost deserted.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he followed you here?" asked T.B.</p>

  <p>"I am sure." The Frenchman looked from left to right in an agony of
  apprehension. "He killed Hyatt and he killed Moss&mdash;of that I am
  certain&mdash;and now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A motor-car loomed suddenly through the fog, coming from the direction of
  Northumberland Avenue, and overtook them. A man leaned out of the window as
  the car swept abreast. His face was masked and his actions were
  deliberate.</p>

  <p>"Look out!" cried the editor, and clutched the Frenchman's arm.</p>

  <p>The pistol that was levelled from the window of the car cracked twice and
  T.B. felt the wind of the bullets as they passed his head.</p>

  <p>Then the car disappeared into the mist, leaving behind three men, one
  half-fainting with terror, one immensely pleased with the novel
  sensation&mdash;our editor, you may be sure&mdash;and one using language
  unbecoming to an Assistant-Commissioner of Police, for T.B. knew that the
  mask was Silinski, and that the detectives even now on their way to St. John
  Street would find the cage empty and the bird flown.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; THE AFFAIR OF THE "CASTILIA"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was no apparent reason for the slump in Spanish Fours.
  Spanish credit never stood so high as it did at the moment of the panic.
  Catalonia had been appeased by the restoration of the constitution, the crops
  throughout Spain had been excellent, and the opening of the Porta Ciento
  mines, combined with the extension of the mining industry in the north, had
  all helped to bring about a condition of financial confidence in Spanish
  securities.</p>

  <p>The "bear" attack, which was made simultaneously on every European Bourse,
  was, in the face of these facts, madness.</p>

  <p>The Spanish Government rose to the situation and with praiseworthy
  promptness, issued broadcast warnings to the investing public. Ministers
  seized any opportunity for speaking on the subject of national financial
  stability, but the "raid" went on. No stock even remotely associated with, or
  dependent upon, Spain's national security was left unassailed. Telegraphs,
  railways, mines&mdash;they suffered in common.</p>

  <p>Then happened that remarkable tragedy that set the whole of Europe
  gasping. It was a happening tragic in its futility, comic in its very
  tragedy. Europe was dumbfounded, speechless. There are two accounts given;
  there is that contained in Blue Book 7541-09, and that issued by the Spanish
  Government as a White Paper. The latter, although it is little more than a
  reprint of a number of articles published in the Heraldo de Madrid and the
  Correspondencia, is as accurate and contains more detail. I have taken these
  accounts and summarized the story of the momentous occurrence from both.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 29th of January, the Spanish cruiser <i>Castilia</i>
  was lying in Vigo Bay. She had been engaged in gun practice on the coast, and
  had come into Vigo for stores and to give leave to her crew.</p>

  <p>The ship had been coaled, ammunition and stores taken on board, and the
  warship steamed out to sea. Her commander was Captain Alfonso Tirez, a
  singularly capable officer who had served with distinction in the Spanish-
  American War.</p>

  <p>The movements of the ship subsequent to her departure from Vigo Bay are
  fairly well known.</p>

  <p>She was seen by a fishing fleet heading south, and was sighted level with
  Oporto by the Portuguese gunboat <i>Braganza</i>. More than this, she
  exchanged signals with the <i>Braganza</i>, making "All's well."</p>

  <p>From this point, her voyage is something of a mystery, although it is
  evident that she continued a straight course.</p>

  <p>She was not sighted again until the third of February, four days after her
  departure from Vigo, and the particulars of her reappearance are contained in
  the report made by Captain Somburn, R.N., of H.M.S. Inveterate, a first-class
  cruiser.</p>

  <p>The Inveterate was detached from the Atlantic Squadron, then lying at
  Gibraltar, by order of the Commander-in-Chief, to cruise along the Morocco
  coast as far south as Mogador, and she was returning when the incident to
  Captain Somburn, so graphically described, occurred.</p>

  <p>"The ship's (the Inveterate's) position at 7.45 was approximately Lat. 35
  north and Long. 10 west, and we were due west of Cape Cantin when the
  <i>Castilia</i> was sighted," wrote Captain Somburn.</p>

  <p>"She was making a course as to pass us on our starboard bow. Recognizing
  her, I ordered the ensign to be flown. Nothing untoward happened, and the
  ship came nearer and nearer.</p>

  <p>"There had been some trouble just before I arrived at Mogador, some little
  fighting with a Moorish tribe, and thinking that it was on this account that
  the cruiser was going south, and that possibly the later news I had would be
  of interest to her captain, I ordered a signal to be made.</p>

  <p>"Mogador all quiet; rising quelled."</p>

  <p>"To my astonishment, no notice was taken of this, and not even so much as
  an answering pennant was hoisted.</p>

  <p>"The officer of the watch, who had been looking at the vessel through his
  telescope, then reported to me that the <i>Castilia</i> was cleared for
  action, and that her gun crews were standing by.</p>

  <p>"I thought that we were interrupting some manoeuvre, such as 'man and arm
  ship,' and readily forgave her commander, who was so absorbed in his drill
  that he had ignored my signal.</p>

  <p>"The next minute, however, the <i>Castilia</i> opened fire on me with her
  forward guns. Both shots missed, one passing our stern and the other just
  clearing our quarterdeck.</p>

  <p>"I signalled 'Your firing practice is endangering me,' for, even then, I
  could not bring myself to a realization that the captain of the
  <i>Castilia</i> was in earnest.</p>

  <p>"I was soon undeceived, however. A shell from his after four-inch gun
  struck and carried away a portion of the navigation bridge.</p>

  <p>"I immediately ordered general stations, and in twenty seconds I had
  cleared the starboard batteries for action. In this time the <i>Castilia</i>
  had put three shells into the Inveterate. The first killed an able seaman and
  seriously wounded the gunnery-lieutenant, the second did little or no damage,
  but the third destroyed No. 3 9.6 gun and killed four of its crew.</p>

  <p>"I at once opened fire on the <i>Castilia</i> with two six-inch guns. Both
  shots took effect, one, as I have since ascertained, below her water line,
  and she immediately heeled over to port.</p>

  <p>"Seeing she was helpless, and sinking rapidly, I ordered away my
  life-boats, at the same time signalling 'I am coming to your assistance.' No
  further shots were fired, and the officers and crew of the <i>Castilia</i>,
  together with nineteen wounded men, were taken off.</p>

  <p>"The <i>Castilia</i> sank at 8.19, the action having lasted, from the time
  of firing the first shot to the moment of crippling, 5 minutes, 48
  seconds.</p>

  <p>"I made no immediate attempt to ascertain the cause of the extraordinary
  conduct of the <i>Castilia</i>, because Captain Tirez, when I received him on
  board, was in a dying condition. He had been struck by a fragment of shell
  and never regained consciousness, expiring that afternoon, but before my
  arrival at Gibraltar I interviewed the Spanish officer who was acting as
  navigating lieutenant. From him I learned the incident was inexplicable to
  him, as to the rest of the crew. The captain had received a wireless
  telegram, coded in the secret cypher of the Admiralty. This telegram had
  perplexed and distressed him, but the only remark he had made to his officers
  had been&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'The Government is sending us to our deaths&mdash;but I can do nothing
  else than obey.'</p>

  <p>"From this it would seem that Captain Tirez&mdash;whom I know personally
  to have been a very able and gallant gentleman&mdash;was acting on orders
  which were open to no other interpretation than as direct instructions to
  shell the Inveterate."</p>

  <p>So much for the laconic report of the officer.</p>

  <p>He compressed within the limits of a sheet of notepaper a tragedy, the
  news of which appalled the civilized world.</p>

  <p>The battle occurred at between seven and eight in the morning. The news
  was in London by ten that the Inveterate had been sunk by a Spanish cruiser
  and that a fierce and sanguinary battle had preceded its sinking.</p>

  <p>Who sent the descriptive telegram from Gibraltar will never be known,
  though its source was obvious.</p>

  <p>It bore the name of a world-famous news agency, and was issued to the
  Press from the London office of the Agency, but the Gibraltar correspondent
  had no knowledge of its sending. All England was in an uproar when the
  official version of the incident came to hand.</p>

  <p>Spain! Why Spain! What was the cause? What had we done, what insult had we
  offered? There were writers in plenty to rush into print to prove that
  whatever had happened it was England's fault, but even these gentlemen could
  offer no elucidation.</p>

  <p>Captain Somburn's report was telegraphed to the Admiralty immediately on
  his arrival at Gibraltar, and issued to the Press. Side by side in the
  morning newspapers appeared the official disclaimer of the Spanish
  Government.</p>

  <p class="quote">"His Majesty's Government has no knowledge of any
  circumstance leading up to or responsible for the recent lamentable disaster
  off the coast of Morocco. It has issued directly or indirectly no
  instructions, orders, or suggestions to Captain Tirez, and has had no
  communication with him other than the conventional exchange of documents,
  peculiar to routine."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19">XIX. &mdash; THE BOOK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">T.B. SMITH was one of many millions who read this statement.
  He was one of many thousands who believed it implicitly. He was one of twelve
  who understood the madness of the dead Spanish Captain.</p>

  <p>He saw, too, villainy behind it all; the greed of gold that had sent a
  gallant ship to the bottom, that had brought death and mutilation in most
  horrible form to brave men.</p>

  <p>Silinski had slipped through his fingers&mdash;Silinski, arch-agent of the
  Nine.</p>

  <p>The house in St. John Street had been raided. In a little room on the top
  floor there was evidence that an instrument of some considerable size had
  been hastily dismantled. Broken ends of wire were hanging from the wall, and
  one other room on the same floor was packed with storage batteries. Pursuing
  their investigations, the detectives ascended to the roof through a trap
  door. Here was the flagstaff and the arrangement for hoisting the wires.
  Apparently, night was usually chosen for the reception and dispatch of
  messages. By night, the taut strands of wire would not attract attention.
  Only in cases of extremest urgency were they employed in daylight.</p>

  <p>Such an occasion had been that when T.B. had interviewed Silinski. He
  understood now why the Pole had talked so loudly. It was to drown the
  peculiar sound of a wireless instrument at work.</p>

  <p>Silinski was gone&mdash;vanished, in spite of the fact that every railway
  terminus in London had been watched, every ocean-going passenger
  scrutinized.</p>

  <p>Now, on top of his disappearance came the Castilia disaster with the
  irresponsible public of two nations howling for a scapegoat. T.B. Smith
  attended a specially convened meeting of Ministers in Downing Street and
  related all that he knew.</p>

  <p>"Give me two days," he said, "and you may publish the whole of the facts.
  But to show our hand now would be disastrous. The police of every city are
  engaged in tracking down the wireless stations. There is one in every
  capital, of that much we are sure. To get the whole gang, however, I must
  find out where they are operating from."</p>

  <p>"Is that possible?" asked the grave Prime Minister.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely, sir," said T.B.</p>

  <p>In the end they agreed.</p>

  <p>A more difficult man to persuade was the editor of the <i>London Morning
  Journal</i>.</p>

  <p>"I have got the story, why not let me publish?" was a not unnatural
  request.</p>

  <p>"In two days you shall have the complete story; what I am anxious to avoid
  is anything in the nature of to-be-continued-in-our-next! I want the whole
  thing rounded off and finished for good."</p>

  <p>Reluctantly, the editor agreed.</p>

  <p>He had two days to get the "book"; this code which the unfortunate Hyatt
  had deciphered to his undoing. Moss had said Hyatt's sister had it, but the
  country had been searched from end to end for Hyatt's sister. It had not been
  difficult to trace her. Elk, after half an hour's search in Falmouth had
  discovered her abode, but the girl was not there.</p>

  <p>"She left for London yesterday," he was informed.</p>

  <p>From that moment Miss Hyatt had disappeared.</p>

  <p>A telegram had reached her on the very day of Hyatt's death. It said
  "Come."</p>

  <p>There was no name, no address. The telegram had been handed in at St.
  Martin's-le-Grand; unearthed, it was found to be in typewritten characters,
  and the address at its back a fictitious one.</p>

  <p>One other item of news Elk secured; there had been a lady on the same
  errand as himself. "A foreign lady," said the good folks of Falmouth. When
  T.B. played the spy to the banker and the Spanish dancer, he had heard her
  speak of a visit to Cornwall; this, then, was the visit.</p>

  <p>He had some two days to discover Eva Hyatt&mdash;this was her name.</p>

  <p>Silinski might have killed her; he was large in his views and generously
  murderous, and one life more or less would not count. T.B. paced his room,
  his head sunk on his breast.</p>

  <p>Where was the girl?</p>

  <p>The telegram said "Come." It suggested some pre-arranged plan in which the
  girl had acquiesced; she was to leave Falmouth and go somewhere.</p>

  <p>Who sent the telegram? Not Silinski; this Eva Hyatt, by all showing, was
  of the class that sticks for the proprieties.</p>

  <p>Suppose she had come to London, where would Catherine Silinski have placed
  her? Near at hand; a thought struck T.B.</p>

  <p>He had been satisfied with deporting the dancing girl, a fruitless
  precaution, as it turned out; he had made no search of her flat. Had she been
  arrested in the ordinary way, the search would have followed, but her arrest
  was a little irregular.</p>

  <p>He took down his overcoat and struggled into it, made a selection of keys
  from his pocket, and went out. It was a forlorn hope, but forlorn hopes had
  often been the forerunners of victory with him, and there was nothing to be
  lost by trying.</p>

  <p>He came to the great hall of the mansion in Baker Street.</p>

  <p>The hall porter recognized him and touched his cap.</p>

  <p>"Evening, sir." Then, "I suppose you know the young lady hasn't come back
  yet?"</p>

  <p>T.B. did know, but said nothing. The porter was in a talkative mood.</p>

  <p>"She sent me a wire from Liverpool, saying that she'd been called away
  suddenly."</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded. He knew this, too, for it was he who had sent the wire.</p>

  <p>"What the other young lady couldn't understand," continued the porter, and
  T.B.'s heart gave a leap, "was, why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why she hadn't wired her, eh?" the detective jumped in.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, she was so busy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course!" The porter clucked his lips impatiently. "Of course, you saw
  her off, didn't you, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I saw her off," said T.B. gravely.</p>

  <p>"I'd forgotten that; why, you went away together, an' I never told the
  young lady. She's upstairs in Miss Silinski's flat at this moment. My word,
  she's been horribly worried&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll go up and see her. As a matter of fact, I've come here for the
  purpose," said T.B. quickly.</p>

  <p>He took the lift to the second floor, and walked along the corridor. He
  reached No. 43 and his hand was raised to press the little electric bell of
  the suite when the door opened quickly and a girl stepped out. She gave a
  startled cry as she saw the detective, and drew back.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said T.B. with a smile. "I'm afraid I startled
  you."</p>

  <p>She was a big florid girl with a certain awkwardness of movement.</p>

  <p>"Well-dressed but gauche," mentally summarized the detective. "Provincial!
  she'll talk."</p>

  <p>"I was a little startled," she said, with a ready smile. "I thought it was
  the postman."</p>

  <p>"But surely postmen do not deliver letters in this palatial dwelling," he
  laughed. "I thought the hall porter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, but this is a registered letter," she said importantly, "from
  America."</p>

  <p>All the time T.B. was thinking out some method by which he might introduce
  the object of his visit. An idea struck him.</p>

  <p>"Is your mother&mdash;" she looked blank, "er&mdash;aunt within?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>He saw the slow suspicion gathering on her face.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a burglar," he smiled, "in spite of my alarming question, but I'm
  in rather a quandary. I've a friend&mdash;well, not exactly a
  friend&mdash;but I have business with Miss Silinski, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Here's the postman," she interrupted.</p>

  <p>A quick step sounded in the passage, and the bearer of the King's mails,
  with a flat parcel in his hand and his eyes searching the door numbers,
  stopped before them.</p>

  <p>"Hyatt!" he asked, glancing at the address.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the girl; "is that my parcel!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, miss, will you sign!"</p>

  <p>"Hyatt!" murmured T.B., "what an extraordinary coincidence. You are not by
  any chance related to the unfortunate young man, the story of whose sad death
  has been rilling the newspapers!"</p>

  <p>She flushed and her lip trembled.</p>

  <p>"He was my brother; did you know him!"</p>

  <p>"I knew of him," said T.B. quietly, "but I did not know you lived in
  London!"</p>

  <p>"Nor do I," said the girl; "it is only by the great kindness of Se&ntilde;ora
  Silinski that I am here."</p>

  <p>There was no time for delicate finesse. He slid his card-case from his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"Will you let me come in and talk with you," he said; then, as he saw
  again the evidence of her suspicion, "I am a police-officer, and what I have
  to ask you is of the greatest importance to you and to me."</p>

  <p>She took the pasteboard, and, as T.B. had anticipated, fell into a flutter
  of agitation.</p>

  <p>"Oh, please come in! Was it wrong to come to London? The Se&ntilde;ora was so
  anxious that nobody should know I was here. I've been so worried about
  her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She led the way into a handsomely furnished sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"First of all," said T.B. quietly, "you must tell me how the Se&ntilde;ora found
  you."</p>

  <p>"She came to Falmouth and sought me out. It was not difficult. I have a
  little millinery establishment there, and my name is well known. She came one
  morning, eight days&mdash;no&mdash;yes, it was seven days ago,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What did she want?"</p>

  <p>"She said she had known Charles, he had some awfully swagger friends; that
  is what got him into trouble at the post office; it was a great blow to us
  because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What did she want?" asked T.B., cutting short the loquacity.</p>

  <p>"She said that Charles had something of hers&mdash;a book which she had
  lent him, years before. Now, the strange thing was that on the very day poor
  Charles was killed I had a telegram which ran: 'If anything happens, tell
  Escoltier book is at Antaxia, New York.' It was unsigned, and I did not
  connect it with Charles. You see, I hadn't heard from him for years.</p>

  <p>"She was a great friend of Charles'&mdash;the Se&ntilde;ora&mdash;and she came
  down especially about the book. She said Charles had got into trouble and she
  wanted the book to save him. Then I showed her the telegram. I was confused,
  but I wanted to help Charles." She gulped down a sob. "I asked her who
  Escoltier was."</p>

  <p>"Yes!" asked T.B. quickly.</p>

  <p>"She said he was a friend of hers who was interested in the book. She went
  away, but came back soon afterwards and told me that 'Antaxia' was the
  telegraphic address of a safe deposit in New York. She was very nice and
  offered to pay for a cable to the deposit. So I wired: 'Please forward by
  registered post the book deposited by Charles Hyatt'; and I signed it 'Eva
  Hyatt' and gave my address. By the evening the reply came: 'Forwarded; your
  previous wire did not comply with our instructions.'"</p>

  <p>"I see," said T.B.</p>

  <p>"Well, that is more than I can," said the girl, with a smile, "because
  only one wire was sent. The Se&ntilde;ora was surprised, too, and a little annoyed,
  and said: 'How foolish it was of me not to ask you your Christian name.'
  Well, then the Se&ntilde;ora insisted upon my coming to stay with her till the book
  came. I came expecting I should find Charles, but&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her eyes were filled with tears.</p>

  <p>"I read in a newspaper that he was dead. It was the first thing I saw in
  London, the bill of a newspaper&mdash;"</p>

  <p>T.B. gave her time to recover her voice.</p>

  <p>"And the Se&ntilde;ora!"</p>

  <p>"She took this furnished flat near to hers," said the girl; "she lives
  here."</p>

  <p>"Does she?" asked T.B. artlessly. He took up the registered parcel which
  she had put on the table.</p>

  <p>It was fairly light.</p>

  <p>"Now, Miss Hyatt," he said, "I want you to do something for me; and I must
  tell you that, although I ask it as a favour, I can enforce my wishes as a
  right."</p>

  <p>"I will do anything," said the girl eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Very well; you must let me take this book away."</p>

  <p>"But it is not mine; it belongs to the Se&ntilde;ora," she protested; "and it is
  to save my brother's name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Miss Hyatt," said T.B. gently, "I must take this book which has so
  providentially come into my hands, not to save your brother's name, but to
  bring to justice the men who took his life."</p>

  <p>As he spoke there came a knock at the door; and, hastily drying her eyes,
  the girl opened it.</p>

  <p>A porter handed her a telegram, and she came back into the light of the
  room to open it.</p>

  <p>She read it, and re-read it; then looked at T.B. with bewilderment written
  on her face.</p>

  <p>"What does this mean?" she said.</p>

  <p>T.B. took the telegram from her hand; it had been re-addressed from
  Falmouth, and ran:</p>

  <p>"By wireless from Port Sybil. Do not part with book to anybody on any
  account,</p>

  <p>"Catherine Silinski."</p>

  <p>T.B. handed the telegram back. "It means," he said, "that our friend is
  just two minutes too late."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20">XX. &mdash; AT THE ADMIRALTY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEREVER men met they spoke of one thing; they had one
  subject of conversation; in train or in club-room; in bar or meeting-place,
  in barristers' robing-room; in prisoners' waiting hall&mdash;the
  <i>Castilia</i>, and Spain.</p>

  <p>Small doubt but that there were demands, irresponsible demands for
  satisfaction, after satisfaction had been given. But tangible satisfaction
  was needed. Spain had dared... insult to the might and majesty of
  Britain&mdash;war must be a logical outcome&mdash;and the like.</p>

  <p>These outpourings appeared in many newspapers under the heading, "Letters
  to the Editor." Some newspapers would not print them because of a curious
  resemblance between them.</p>

  <p>The Editor of the <i>London Journal</i> made this discovery.</p>

  <p><i>The Journal</i> is a newspaper controlled by a great syndicate which
  owns a newspaper in every one of the great centres of industry throughout
  Great Britain. It has a system of exchanging confidences, and, as a result,
  it was found that a letter addressed to <i>The Northern Journal</i> and
  <i>Times</i> was identical, word for word, with a letter addressed to the
  London paper. With this difference, that whilst one was signed "J.Y. Barver,"
  the other bore the magnificent signature of "Orlando T. Sabout." The editor
  sent both letters to T.B. Smith, and T.B. grinned unpleasantly, but with some
  admiration for the completeness of the Nine Men's organization.</p>

  <p>On top of these letters, was revived a form of publicity which had long
  since fallen into desuetude&mdash;the pamphlet was mooked.</p>

  <p>Three pamphlets were shot suddenly into the market. This was the second
  day after the sinking of the <i>Castilia</i>.</p>

  <p>One, the more virulent, was called "A Blow at Protestantism," and was an
  invitation to England to sweep Europe clear of the "Catholic menace."</p>

  <p>Neither pamphlet could have been written in two days. They must have been
  prepared a fortnight to a month in advance of the disaster. They bore no
  publisher's imprint or printer's advertisement.</p>

  <p>"This business is a little too hot to hold," said the editor in a final
  interview with T.B. "Tonight I must tell the whole of the story."</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded.</p>

  <p>"To-night," said T.B., "you can tell what you like. I shall have played my
  stake for good or ill."</p>

  <p>"I have been talking with Escoltier; we have got him lodged in Scotland
  Yard&mdash;though you needn't mention that fact in your account&mdash;and I
  think we know enough now to trap the Nine Men."</p>

  <p>"Who are they and what does the 'C' stand for in'N.H.C.'?"</p>

  <p>"I can only guess," said T.B. cautiously. "Do you know anything about
  wireless telegraphy!" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Not much," admitted the editor.</p>

  <p>"Well, you know enough to realize that the further you wish to communicate
  the more electrical energy you require?"</p>

  <p>"That much I understand," said the journalist. "The principle is the
  'rings on the pond.' You throw a stone into still water, and immediately
  rings grow outward. The bigger the stone, the farther reaching the
  rings."</p>

  <p>"At Poldhu," continued T.B., "Hyatt was in charge of the long-distance
  instrument. As a matter of fact, the work he was engaged on was merely
  experimental, but his endeavour seemed to be centred in securing the
  necessary energy for communicating nine hundred miles. Of course, wireless
  telegraphy is practicable up to and beyond 3,000 miles, but few installations
  are capable of transmitting that distance.</p>

  <p>"So 'C' is, you think, within 900 miles of Cornwall!"</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have a feeling that I know 'C'," he said. "I have another feeling that
  these wireless messages do not come from 'C' at all, but from a place
  adjacent. However,"&mdash;he took from his pocket a flat exercise book filled
  with closely-written columns of words and figures&mdash;"we shall see."</p>

  <p>He took a cab from Fleet Street; and, arriving at the block of Government
  buildings which sheltered the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, he
  entered its gloomy doors.</p>

  <p>A messenger came forward to inquire his business, but was forestalled by a
  keen little man with tanned face and twinkling eyes. "Sailor" was written on
  every line of his mahogany face. "Hullo, my noble policeman!" he greeted T.B.
  "Who is the victim&mdash;the First Sea Lord or the Controller of the
  Victualling Department?"</p>

  <p>"To be precise, Almack," said T.B. "I have come to arrest Reform, which I
  gather&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No politics," smiled Captain John Almack, R.N. "What is the game?"</p>

  <p>"It is what our mutual friend Napoleon would call a negative problem in
  strategy," the Assistant-Commissioner replied. "I want to ask an ethereal
  friend, who exists somewhere in space, to come in and be killed."</p>

  <p>Captain Almack led the way up a flight of stairs.</p>

  <p>"We got a request from your Commissioner; and, of course, the Lords of
  Admiralty are only too pleased to put the instrument at your disposal."</p>

  <p>"They are very charming," murmured T.B.</p>

  <p>"They instructed me to keep a watchful eye on you. We have missed things
  since your last visit.</p>

  <p>"That sounds like a jovial lie," said T.B. frankly.</p>

  <p>In the orderly instrument room they found an operator in attendance, and
  T.B. lost no time.</p>

  <p>"Call N.H.C.," he said; and, whilst the instrument clicked and snapped
  obedient to the man's hand, T.B. opened his little exercise book and composed
  a message. He had finished his work long before any answer came to the call.
  For half an hour they waited whilst the instrument clicked monotonously.
  "Dash-dot, dot-dot-dot, dash-dot-dash-dot."</p>

  <p>And over and over again.</p>

  <p>"Dash-dot, dot-dot-dot, dash-dot-dash-dot."</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the operator stopped, and there came a new sound.</p>

  <p>They waited in tense silence.</p>

  <p>"Answered," said the operator.</p>

  <p>"Take this." T.B. handed him a slip of paper.</p>

  <p>As the man sent the message out with emphatic tappings, Captain Almack
  took the translation that T.B. handed him.</p>

  <p>"To N.H.C.. There is trouble here. I must see you. Important. Can you meet
  me in Paris tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>After this message had gone through there was a wait of five minutes. Then
  the answer came, and the man at the instrument wrote down unintelligible
  words which T.B. translated.</p>

  <p>"Impossible. Come to M. Will meet S.E. Have you got the book?"</p>

  <p>"Reply 'Podaba'," instructed T.B., spelling the word. "Now send this." He
  handed another slip of paper across the table, and passed the translation
  back to the man behind him.</p>

  <p>"Is Gibraltar intercepting messages?" it ran. Again the wait, and again
  the staccato reply.</p>

  <p>"Unlikely, but will send round tomorrow to make sure. Good-night."</p>

  <p>As the instrument clicked its farewell, T.B. executed a silent war-dance
  to the scandal of the solemn operator, and the delight of the little
  captain.</p>

  <p>"T.B., you'll get me hung!" he warned. "You'll upset all kinds of delicate
  instruments, to say nothing of the telegraphist's sense of decency. Come
  away."</p>

  <p>"Now," demanded Captain Almack, when he had led him to his snug little
  office; "what is the mystery!"</p>

  <p>T.B. related as much of the story as was necessary, and the officer
  whistled.</p>

  <p>"The devils!" he swore. "And so that's the explanation of the poor old
  <i>Castilia</i>'s sinking is it?"</p>

  <p>"The discovery I was trying to make," T.B. went on, "was the exact
  location of N.H.C.. I asked him or them to come to Paris. As a matter of
  fact, I wanted to know if they were within twenty-four hours' distance of
  Paris. 'Impossible,' they reply. But they will come to Madrid, and offer to
  meet the Sud Express. So they must be in Spain and south of Madrid, otherwise
  there would be no impossibility about meeting me in Paris tomorrow. "Where
  are they? Within reach of Gibraltar apparently, because they talk of sending
  round tomorrow. Now, that phrase 'sending round' is significant, for it
  proves beyond the shadow of a doubt exactly in what part of Andalusia they
  live."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"When people who live within reach of the fortress talk of going to
  Gibraltar, as you know, they either say that they are 'going across to
  Gibraltar' or that they are 'going round.' By the first, they indicate the
  route via Algeciras and across the bay; by the latter, they refer to the
  journey by way of Cadiz and Tangier&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cadiz!"</p>

  <p>The exclamation came from his hearers.</p>

  <p>"Cadiz," repeated T.B. He bent his head forward and rested it for a moment
  in his hands. When he lifted it, they saw that his face was grave.</p>

  <p>"It's worth trying," he muttered. "And," he continued aloud, "it will be
  bringing down two birds with one stone."</p>

  <p>"May I use the instrument again?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said the officer readily.</p>

  <p>T.B. rose.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to Scotland Yard, and I shall not be away for more than ten
  minutes," he said; and in a few seconds he was crossing Whitehall at a
  run.</p>

  <p>He passed through the entrance and made straight for the big bureau, where
  day in and day out the silent recorder sat with his pen, his cabinets and his
  everlasting dossier.</p>

  <p>T.B. knew he would be there, because there was a heavy calendar at the Old
  Bailey, and the silent man was working far into the night&mdash;arranging,
  sorting, and re-arranging.</p>

  <p>The detective was back at the Admiralty within the ten minutes, and
  together the two made their way to the Instrument Room.</p>

  <p>"N.H.C.." responded almost at once, and T.B. sent his message.</p>

  <p>"Tell George T. Baggin that another warrant has been issued for his
  arrest."</p>

  <p>The reply came immediately.</p>

  <p>"Thanks. Get further particulars, but do not use names."</p>

  <p>T.B. read the reply and handed it without a word to the other.</p>

  <p>"Please God, I'll hang the man who sent that, message," he said, with
  unusual earnestness.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap21"
     name="chap21">XXI. &mdash; SILINSKI STRIKES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was half-past nine when T.B. sent and received the last
  message; and an hour later he had interviewed the Commissioner.</p>

  <p>"Get your lady away all right?" his chief greeted him.</p>

  <p>"Well away, sir," said T.B. serenely. "Out of reach of Silinski&mdash;his
  agents were watching the flat&mdash;there was a burglary there the very night
  the book arrived."</p>

  <p>"And the lady?"</p>

  <p>"She is due in Jamaica in a few days."</p>

  <p>"And now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>T.B. told the story of the developments.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner nodded from time to time.</p>

  <p>"You're an ingenious young man," he said. "One of these fine days somebody
  will badly want your blood."</p>

  <p>"It has often happened," T.B. granted. "There was Spedding, the forger;
  you remember him, sir? There was&mdash;oh, I could give you a dozen
  instances."</p>

  <p>He sat over a companionable cigar and a whisky and soda, talking until the
  hands of the clock were near on midnight; then he rose to take his leave.</p>

  <p>"You will leave for Spain tomorrow?" asked the Chief.</p>

  <p>"Yes; by the first train. I can get the warrants from the Yard before I
  leave, and the Spanish authorities will give me all the help I need."</p>

  <p>"And what of Silinskif" asked the Chief Com-missioner.</p>

  <p>T.B. shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"We had a murderer there," he said. "I am satisfied that with all his
  alibis, he killed Moss. Whether he actually stabbed Hyatt, I am not sure. The
  man had such a perfect organization in London that it is possible that one of
  his cut-throat friends served him in the case of that unfortunate young man.
  Silinski can wait. If we get the others, we shall get him."</p>

  <p>"Good-night, sir."</p>

  <p>He grasped the proffered hand, and his host ushered him into the silent
  street.</p>

  <p>He took two steps forward, when a man rose apparently from the ground, and
  two shots rang out. T.B. had drawn his revolver and fired from his hip, and
  his assailant staggered back cursing as a dark shadow came running from the
  opposite side of the road to his help.</p>

  <p>Then T.B. swayed, his knees bent under him, and he fell back into the
  Commissioner's arms.</p>

  <p>"I'm done," he said, and the third man, whose name was Silinski,
  hesitating a moment in the roadway, slipped his revolver back into his pocket
  and fled.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap22"
     name="chap22">XXII. &mdash; THE CONVICT FROM CEUTRA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE streets of Cadiz were deserted; only by the Quay was
  there any sign of life, for here the crew of the Brazilian warship, the
  <i>Maria Braganza</i>, were languidly embarking stores on flat-bottomed
  lighters, and discussing, with a wealth of language and in no complimentary
  terms, the energy of their commander. It was obvious, so they said in their
  picturesque language, that a warship was never intended to carry cargo, and
  if the Brazilian Government was foolish enough to purchase war stores in
  Spain, it should go a little farther, and charter a Spanish merchant ship to
  carry them.</p>

  <p>So they cursed Captain Lombrosa for a dog and the son of a dog, and
  predicted for him an eternity of particular discomfort.</p>

  <p>Captain Lombrosa, a short, swarthy man, knew nothing of his unpopularity,
  and probably cared less. He was sitting in the cafe of the Five Nations, near
  the Plaza de Mayor, picking his teeth thoughtfully and reading from time to
  time the cablegram from his Government which informed him that certain
  defalcations of his had been discovered by the Paymaster-General of the Navy,
  and demanding peremptorily his return to Rio de Janeiro.</p>

  <p>To say that Captain Lombrosa was unperturbed would be to exaggerate. No
  man who builds his house upon sand can calmly regard the shifting foundations
  of his edifice. But he was not especially depressed for many reasons. The
  Government had merely anticipated events by a week or so.</p>

  <p>He read the cablegram with its pencilled deco-dation, smiled sadly, put up
  his feet on a chair, and called for another bottle of Rioja.</p>

  <p>There is an unlovely road through the dreary waste that leads from Cadiz
  to San Fernando. Beyond the city and beyond the Arsenal the road winds
  through the bleak salt marshes to Jerez, that Xeres de la Fonterra which has
  given its name to the amber wine of Spain.</p>

  <p>A solitary horseman cantered into San Fernando, his clothing white with
  brackish dust. He drew rein before the Cafe Cruz Blanca and dismounted; an
  untidy barefooted boy leading his horse away.</p>

  <p>There were few people in the saloon of the cafe, for a chill wind was
  abroad, and the <i>cappa</i> is a very poor protection against the icy
  breezes that blow from the Sierras.</p>

  <p>A man greeted the horseman as he entered&mdash;an outrageously stout man
  with bulging cheeks and puffy eyes. He breathed wheezily, and his fat hands
  moved with a strange restlessness.</p>

  <p>They hailed each other in the Andalusian dialect, and the newcomer ordered
  "Cafe c'leche."</p>

  <p>"Well, friend?" asked the stout man, when the waiter had disappeared.
  "What is the news?"</p>

  <p>He spoke in English.</p>

  <p>"The best," replied the other, in the same language. "T.B. is
  finished."</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"It's a fact."</p>

  <p>"Ramundo shot him at close range, but the devil went down fighting.
  They've got Ramundo."</p>

  <p>The fat man snorted.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that dangerous?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"For us, no; for him, yes," said the man carelessly. "Ramundo knows
  nothing except that he has been living in the lap of luxury for two years in
  London on the wages of an unknown employer."</p>

  <p>"What will he get?" asked the stout man nervously.</p>

  <p>The man looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"You are getting jumpy, friend Meyers," he said coolly.</p>

  <p>"I am getting sick of this life," said Meyers. "We're making money by the
  million, but what is the use of it? We are dogs that dare not show our noses
  abroad; we're exiled and damned and there is no future."</p>

  <p>"You might as well be here as in prison," philosophized his friend. "And
  in prison you most certainly would be, if not worse&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We had no hand in the murders," interrupted Meyers pleadingly. "Now did
  we, Baggin!"</p>

  <p>"I know little about the English law," drawled George T. Baggin, sometime
  treasurer of the London and Manhattan Securities Syndicate. "But such
  knowledge as I have enables me to say with certainty that we should be
  hanged&mdash;sure."</p>

  <p>The fat man collapsed, mopping his brow.</p>

  <p>"Eamundo killed one and Silinski the other," he mumbled. "What about
  Silinski!"</p>

  <p>"He was standing by when T.B. was shot; but, as soon as he saw the
  policeman was down and out, he skipped. He arrives tonight."</p>

  <p>Some thought came to him which was not quite agreeable, for he
  frowned.</p>

  <p>"Silinski, of course, knows," he went on meditatively. "Silinski is one
  with us."</p>

  <p>"He has been a good servant," the fat man ventured.</p>

  <p>"Had been," said the other, emphasizing the first word.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Was it not he who established our stations and got the
  right men to work 'em? Why, he has got the whole thing at his fingers'
  ends."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Baggin, with a wry smile. "And he has ns at his fingers'
  ends also&mdash;where are our friends?&mdash;the other matter I have arranged
  without calling in Silinski."</p>

  <p>"They are returning tonight." The fat man shifted uncomfortably. "You were
  saying about this T.B. fellow&mdash;he is dead?"</p>

  <p>"Not dead, but nearly; Silinski saw him carried into the house, and a
  little later an ambulance came flying to the door. He saw him carried
  out."</p>

  <p>Meyers lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>"Is Silinski?" He did not complete his sentence.</p>

  <p>"He's dangerous. I tell you, Meyers, we are on tender ice; there's a
  cracking and a creaking in the air."</p>

  <p>Meyers licked his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"I've been havin' dreams lately," he rumbled. "Horrid dreams about
  prisons&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Haw&mdash;cut it out," said the disgusted American. "There's no time for
  fool dreaming. I'm going to the committee tonight; you back me up.
  Hullo!"</p>

  <p>A beggar had sidled into the Cafe in the waiter's absence. He moved with
  the furtive shuffle of the practised mendicant.</p>

  <p>His hair was close cropped, and on his cheeks was a three days' growth of
  beard.</p>

  <p>He held out a grimy hand.</p>

  <p>"Se&ntilde;or," he murmured. "Por Dios&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Git!"</p>

  <p>The man looked at him appealingly.</p>

  <p>"Diez centimos, Se&ntilde;or," he whined.</p>

  <p>Baggin raised his hand, but checked its descent. He had seen something
  behind the ragged jacket closely buttoned at the throat.</p>

  <p>"Wait for me on the road to Jerez," he commanded, and tossed the man a
  silver piece. The beggar caught it with the skill of an expert.</p>

  <p>The American cut short the torrent of thanks, blessings, and
  protestations.</p>

  <p>"Meet me in half an hour; you understand?"</p>

  <p>'What the devil are you going to do?" demanded Meyers.</p>

  <p>"You shall see."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later they emerged from the Cafe, Baggin to his horse, and
  the fat man to a capacious victoria, that he had summoned from the hotel
  stables.</p>

  <p>A mile along the road they came up with the beggar.</p>

  <p>"Get down, Meyers, and send the victoria on; you can signal it when you
  want it."</p>

  <p>He waited until the empty victoria had driven away; then he turned to the
  waiting ragamuffin.</p>

  <p>"What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"Carlos Cabindez," said the man hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"Where do you live!"</p>

  <p>"At Ronda."</p>

  <p>"Where have you come from?"</p>

  <p>"Tarifa."</p>

  <p>"What is your trade?"</p>

  <p>The man grinned and shuffled his feet.</p>

  <p>"A fisherman," he said at last.</p>

  <p>Baggin's hand suddenly shot out; and, grasping his collar, tore open the
  frayed jacket.</p>

  <p>The man wrenched himself free with an imprecation.</p>

  <p>"Take your hand from that knife," commanded Baggin. "I will do you no
  harm. Where did you get that shirt?"</p>

  <p>The beggar scowled and drew the threadbare coat across his chest.</p>

  <p>"I bought it," he said.</p>

  <p>"That's a lie," said Baggin. "It's a prisoner's shirt; you are an escaped
  convict."</p>

  <p>The man made no answer.</p>

  <p>"From Ceutra?"</p>

  <p>Again no reply.</p>

  <p>"What was your sentence? Answer."</p>

  <p>"Life," said the other sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Your crime?"</p>

  <p>"Asesinatos."</p>

  <p>"How many?"</p>

  <p>"Tres."</p>

  <p>Baggin's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Three murders, eh?" he said. "Then you would like to earn a thousand
  pesetas?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>"You can go on, Meyers," he said. "I shall see you tonight. In the
  meantime, I wish to have a little talk with our friend here."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap23"
     name="chap23">XXIII. &mdash; THE HOUSE ON THE HILL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BEYOND the town of Jerez and on the road that runs westward
  to San Lucar, there is a hill. Once upon a time, a grey old watchtower stood
  upon its steepest place, but one day there came an eccentric American who
  purchased the land on which it stood, demolished the tower, and erected a
  castellated mansion. Rumour had it that he was mad, but no American would be
  confined on a Spaniard's appreciation of sanity.</p>

  <p>The American consul at Jerez, of his charity and kindliness of heart,
  journeyed out to call upon him, and received a cold welcome. A message came
  to him, but the proprietor was in bed with gout, and neither then or at any
  time desired visitors, which so enraged the well-meaning consul that he never
  called again. The American's visits were of a fleeting character. He was in
  residence less than a month in the year. Then one day he came and remained.
  His name was registered as Se&ntilde;or Walter G. Brown, of New York. The English
  police sought him as George T. Baggin, an absconding promoter, broker,
  bucket-shopkeeper, and all-round thief. After a time he began to receive
  visitors, who stayed on also.</p>

  <p>Then came a period when Mr. Walter G. Brown became aggressively
  patriotic.</p>

  <p>He caused to be erected on the topmost tower of his mansion an enormous
  flagstaff, from which flew on rare occasions a ridiculously small Stars and
  Stripes.</p>

  <p>At night, the place of the flag was taken by a number of thick copper
  strands, and simple-minded villagers in the country about reported strange
  noises, for all the world like the rattling of dried peas in a tin
  canister.</p>

  <p>On the evening of a wintry day, many people journeyed up the steep pathway
  that led to the mansion on the hill. They came singly and in pairs, mostly
  riding, although one exceedingly stout man drove up in a little victoria
  drawn by two panting mules.</p>

  <p>The last to come was Mr. Baggin, an unpleasant smile on his square
  face.</p>

  <p>By the side of his horse trotted a breathless man in a tattered coat, his
  cropped head bare.</p>

  <p>"I will show you where to stand," Baggin said. "There is a curtain that
  covers a door. The man will pass by that curtain, and I shall be with him. I
  will hold his arm&mdash;so. Then I will say 'Se&ntilde;or Silinski I do not trust
  you' and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The ragged man swept the sweat from his forehead with the back of his
  hand, for the path was steep.</p>

  <p>"And then," he grunted, "I will strike."</p>

  <p>"Surely," warned the other.</p>

  <p>The man grinned.</p>

  <p>"I shall not fail," he said significantly.</p>

  <p>They disappeared into the great house&mdash;it is worthy of note that
  Baggin opened the door with a key of his own&mdash;and darkness fell upon the
  hill and upon the valley.</p>

  <p>Far away, lights twinkling through the trees showed where Jerez lay.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap24"
     name="chap24">XXIV. &mdash; THE NINE BEARS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE room in which the Nine Men sat was large even as rooms
  go in Spain. It had the appearance of a small lecture hall. Heavy curtains of
  dark blue velvet hid the tall windows, and electric lights, set at intervals
  in the ceiling, provided light.</p>

  <p>The little desks at which the men sat were placed so as to form a
  horseshoe.</p>

  <p>Of the nine, it is possible that one knew the other, and that some guessed
  the identity of all. It was difficult to disguise Meyers with his unwieldy
  bulk, yet with all the trickery of the black cloaks they wore and the crepe
  masks that hid their faces, it was hard enough to single even him from his
  fellows.</p>

  <p>The last man had reached his seat when one who sat at the extreme end of
  the horseshoe on the president's right, rose and asked: "What of Silinski,
  brother?"</p>

  <p>"He has not yet arrived," was the muffled reply.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, then, it is well that I should say what I have to say before his
  return," said the first speaker.</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet, and eight pairs of eyes turned towards him.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he began, "the time has come when our operations must
  cease."</p>

  <p>A murmur interrupted him, and he stopped.</p>

  <p>"What is it!" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"Let us have more light," said a mask at the end of the horseshoe, and
  pointed to the ceiling where only half of the lights glowed.</p>

  <p>Baggins nodded, and the man rose and made his way to the curtained recess
  where the switches were.</p>

  <p>"No, no, no!" said Baggin quickly&mdash;for he suddenly realized that
  there was something hidden by the curtain, a sinister figure of a man in
  convict shirt, fingering the edge of a brand new knife. So Baggin pictured
  him.</p>

  <p>The masked man halted in surprise.</p>

  <p>"No, no," repeated Baggin, and beckoned him back. "For what I have to say
  I need no light; you interrupt me, brother,"</p>

  <p>With a muttered apology the man resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>"I have said," continued Baggin, "that the time has come when we must
  seriously consider the advisability of dispersing."</p>

  <p>A murmur of assent met these words.</p>

  <p>"This organization of ours has grown and grown until it has become
  unwieldy," he went on. "We are all business men, so there is no need for me
  to enlarge upon the danger that attends the house that undertakes
  responsibilities which it cannot personally attend to.</p>

  <p>"We have completed a most wonderful organization. We have employed all the
  ingenuities of modern science to further our plans. We have agents in every
  part of Europe, in India, Egypt, and America. So long as these agents have
  been ignorant of the identity and location of their employers, we were safe.
  To ensure this, we have worked through M. Gregory Silinski, a gentleman who
  came to us four years ago&mdash;under peculiar conditions.</p>

  <p>"We have employed, too, and gratefully employed, Catherine Silinski, a
  charming lady, as to whose future you need have no fear. Some time ago, as
  you all know, we established wireless stations in the great capitals, as
  being the safest method by which our instructions might be transmitted
  without revealing to our agents the origin of these commands. A code was
  drawn up, certain arrangements of letters and words, and this code was
  deciphered and our secret revealed through the ingenuity of one man. We were
  prepared to meet him on a business basis. We communicated with him by
  wireless, and agreed to pay a sum not only to himself, but to two others, if
  he kept our secret and agreed to make no written record of their discovery.
  They promised, but their promise was broken, and it was necessary to employ
  other methods.</p>

  <p>"I am fully prepared to accept responsibility for my share of the result,
  just as I am prepared to share responsibility for any other act, which
  circumstances may have rendered necessary.</p>

  <p>"And now, gentlemen, I come to the important part in my speech. By sharing
  the result of our operations we may each go our way, in whatever guise we
  think most suitable, to the enjoyment of our labours.</p>

  <p>"In a short time for many of us the Statute of Limitations will have
  worked effectively; and for others there are States in South America that
  would welcome us and offer us every luxury that money can buy or heart
  desire.</p>

  <p>"Yet I would not advise the scattering of our forces. Rather, I have a
  scheme which will, I think, enable us to extract the maximum of enjoyment
  from life, at a minimum of risk. With that end in view, I have expended from
  our common fund a sum equal to half a million English pounds. I have
  completed elaborate arrangements, which I shall ask you to approve of; I have
  fashioned our future." He threw out his hands with a gesture of pride. "It is
  for you to decide whether we shall go our several ways, each in fear of the
  weakness of the other, our days filled with dread, our nights sleepless with
  doubt, or whether in new circumstances we shall live together in freedom, in
  happiness, and in unity.</p>

  <p>Again the murmured applause.</p>

  <p>"But there is an element of danger which must be removed," Baggin went on,
  "between freedom and us there lies a shadow."</p>

  <p>He stopped and looked from mask to mask.</p>

  <p>"That shadow," he said slowly, "is Gregory Silinski, the man who knows our
  secret, who has done our work, the one man in the world who holds our lives
  in the hollow of his hand."</p>

  <p>Before he had finished he saw their eyes leave his face and seek the door,
  and he turned to meet the calm scrutiny of the subject of his discourse.</p>

  <p>He entered the room whilst Baggin was speaking and stood listening.</p>

  <p>Silinski had an air of his own; a deferential, yet menacing air, which
  impressed you. He had been described by T.B. Smith as a combination of
  head-waiter and hangman&mdash;not an unhappy description.</p>

  <p>Now he stood with eyes fixed on Baggin.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Baggin does me an honour that I do not deserve," he said
  suavely, in his high lisping voice.</p>

  <p>Baggin shot a swift side glance at a curtained recess behind which stooped
  a crop-haired man in a convict shirt, fingering a brand-new knife.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Baggin," Silinski went on, "is wrong when he says I am the only
  man who stands between the Nine Bears of Cadiz and freedom&mdash;there is
  another, and his name is T.B. Smith."</p>

  <p>"T.B. Smith is dead, or dying," said Baggin angrily, "we have your word
  for it."</p>

  <p>Silinski favoured him with the slightest bow.</p>

  <p>"Even Silinski may fall into an error," he said magnanimously. "T.B. is
  neither dead nor hurt."</p>

  <p>"But he fell?"</p>

  <p>Silinski smiled.</p>

  <p>"It was clever, and even I was deceived," he confessed; "the ambulance
  that took him away was an artistic conception&mdash;he is alive
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He walked forward until he was opposite the curtain where the assassin
  waited.</p>

  <p>"He is in Jerez, messieurs."</p>

  <p>"It's a lie," shouted Baggin. "Strike, Carlos."</p>

  <p>He wrenched the curtain aside, revealing the sinister figure behind.</p>

  <p>Silinski fell back with an ashen face, but the convict made no move.</p>

  <p>Baggin sprang at him in a fury, and struck madly, blindly, but Silinski's
  arm caught his, and wrenched him backward.</p>

  <p>In Silinski's other hand was a revolver, and the muzzle covered the
  convict.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," said Silinski, and his eyes blazed with triumph, "I have told
  you that T.B. Smith was alive&mdash;behold him!"</p>

  <p>And T.B. Smith, in his convict shirt, standing with one hand against the
  wall of the recess, and the other on his hip, smiled cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"That is very true," he said.</p>

  <p>Under his hand were the three switches that controlled the light in the
  room.</p>

  <p>"It is also true," said Silinski, who dearly loved a speech, "that you are
  virtually dead."</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded; he knew his man by now.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't it a Polish philosopher," he began with all the hesitation of one
  who is beginning a long discourse, "who said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then he switched out the light and dropped flat on the floor. The
  revolvers cracked together, and Silinski uttered an oath.</p>

  <p>There was a wild scramble in the dark. A knot of men swayed over a
  prostrate form; then a trembling hand found the switch, and the room was
  flooded with light.</p>

  <p>Silinski lay flat on his back with a bullet through his leg, but the man
  they sought, the man in the striped shirt and with a three days' growth of
  beard, was gone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap25"
     name="chap25">XXV. &mdash; T.B. SMITH REPORTS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN red, blue, and green; in type varying in size according
  to the temperament of the newspapers; in words wild or sedate, as the
  character of the journal demanded, the newspaper contents bills gave London
  its first intimation of the breaking up of the Nine Bears.</p>

  <p>"Never in the history of our time," began the leading article of the
  <i>Telegram</i>.</p>

  <p>"A story which reads like the imaginative conception of the romantic
  writer," began the leader of the London Times and Courier.</p>

  <p>That the Nine Bears were dispersed was hailed as a triumph for the English
  police. Unfortunately, the popular view is not always the correct view, and
  T.B. Smith came back to London a very angry man.</p>

  <p>It had been no fault of his that the majority of the band had escaped.</p>

  <p>"The Civil Guard was twenty minutes late in taking up its position," wrote
  T.B. in his private report.</p>

  <p>"No blame attached to the Guard, which is one of the finest police forces
  in the world, but of the local police authorities, who at the eleventh hour
  detected some obscurity in their instructions from Madrid, and must needs
  telegraph for elucidation. So that the ring about the House on the Hill was
  not completed until long after the whole lot had escaped. We caught Francois
  Zillier, who has been handed over to the French police, but the remainder of
  the gang got clean away. Apparently they have taken Silinski with them; he
  may or may not be dangerously wounded, but such indications as we have point
  to his having been badly hurt. How the remainder managed to carry him off
  passes my comprehension; the 'why' of it is apparent. He knows too much. We
  have secured a few documents. There is one mysterious scrap of paper
  discovered in Baggin's private room which is incoherent to a point of
  wildness, and apparently the rough note of some future scheme; it will bear
  re-examination.&mdash;"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap26"
     name="chap26">XXVI. &mdash; THE LADY WHO LOST &pound;200</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was, in the Record Office at Scotland Yard, and is
  probably still, a stout package containing a number of telegrams written in
  French, English, Spanish, German, Portuguese and Italian. Each one of these
  wires is to the same effect as the others.</p>

  <p>"Exhaustive enquiries throughout the country have failed to discover any
  trace of the Nine Bears of Cadiz."</p>

  <p>The story of these men, inscribed in the records of Scotland Yard, is not
  perhaps as complete as that in the possession of the French police, for M.
  Escoltier, sometime confidential wireless operator of the Eiffel Tower, had
  placed the police of Paris in possession of a great deal of useful
  information that he had denied the Metropolitan authorities.</p>

  <p>From the rough notes of the telegrams he had received and transmitted to
  the unfortunate Hyatt, the French police, with the aid of codes obligingly
  supplied by Scotland Yard, had been able to grasp the magnitude of the
  operations conducted by the Nine. The extent of these operations revealed the
  extraordinary thoroughness of their organization. In various names, and under
  cover very often of innocent-looking commercial concerns, they had conducted
  their nefarious business with impunity. There is now no doubt whatever that
  the Deutsch Ost-Amerika Handel, with its gorgeous offices at The Hague, was
  part of the chain of operating centres. Equally certain it is that the
  Compagnie de Maritime de Solent was another. The Credit Sud-Espagna&mdash;
  despite threats of libel actions&mdash;was a third. One could multiply the
  list, covering bogus concerns in Vienna, Petersburg, Moscow, Milan, Rome,
  Budapest, Bukarest, and Brussels.</p>

  <p>So far as we have been able to trace, there was no office in Copenhagen or
  in either of the Scandinavian capitals. By means of M. Escoltier's telegrams
  the French police made an approximate estimate of the extent of the profits
  secured by the band:</p>

  <p>Slump in Kaffirs (anticipating the announcements that the Portuguese
  Government refused recruiting facilities for native labour): &pound;1,750,000</p>

  <p>Slump in New York steel (anticipating the "suicide" of the President of
  the National Bank of Baltimore): &pound;2,850,000</p>

  <p>Slump in copper: &pound;1,340,000 (Coincident with the arrest of Mr. Hilas B.
  Cluttering on a charge of misappropriation. The documents on which the arrest
  was effected were afterwards discovered to be forgeries)</p>

  <p>&pound;1,000,000 Slump in British Industrials (expert opinions hold that this
  was one of the failures of the Nine) &pound;100,000</p>

  <p>Slump in Spanish Fours &pound;2,000,000</p>

  <p>(See page 49 of the Appendix of M. Gaultier's Report.)</p>

  <p>It well may be that the French police have overestimated the hauls, just
  as they have entirely failed to connect the disastrous fall of Argentine
  securities with the revolution of '07&mdash;a revolution which owed its
  origin to the machinations of the Nine Men of Cadiz.</p>

  <p>The discovery of the band and the revelations of its modus operandi must
  stand as the greatest sensation in the history of crime. It was followed by
  the world-famous "International Convention of 1910," and the adoption of its
  recommendation prohibiting the working of private wireless instruments
  without a licence from the Government, making any breach of the ordinance a
  penal offence.</p>

  <p>"Thanks to the industry and perseverance of the English police," said the
  <i>London Morning Journal</i>, commenting upon this law, "the Nine Men of
  Cadiz are dispersed, their power destroyed, their brilliant villainies a
  memory. It is only a matter of time before they will fall into the hands of
  the police, and the full measure of Society's punishment be awarded them.
  Scattered as they are..."</p>

  <p>T.B. Smith put down his paper when he came to this part, and smiled
  grimly.</p>

  <p>"Scattered, are they!" he said. "I doubt it."</p>

  <p>For all the praise that was lavished upon him and upon his department, he
  was not satisfied with himself. He knew that he had failed. To break up the
  gang had always been possible. To arrest them and seize the huge fortune they
  had amassed would have been an achievement justifying the encomia that was
  being lavished upon him.</p>

  <p>"The only satisfaction I have," he said to the Chief Commissioner, "is
  that we are so often cursed for inefficiency when we do the right thing, that
  we can afford to take a little credit when we've made a hash of things."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say that," demurred the Chief.</p>

  <p>"You did all that was humanly possible."</p>

  <p>T.B. sniffed.</p>

  <p>"Eight men and Silinski slipped through my fingers," he answered briefly;
  "that's a bad best."</p>

  <p>He rose from the chair and paced the room, his head sunk on his
  breast.</p>

  <p>"If Silinski had delayed his entrance another ten minutes," he said,
  stopping suddenly. "Baggin would have told me all that I wanted to know. This
  wonderful scheme of his that was to secure them all ease and security for the
  rest of their lives."</p>

  <p>"He may have been boasting," suggested the other, but T.B. shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"It was no boast," he said, with assurance, "and if it were, he has made
  it good, for where are the Nine? One of them is on the Devil's Island,
  because he had the misfortune to fall into our hands. But where are the
  others? Vanished! Dissolved into the elements&mdash;and their money with
  them. I tell you, sir, there is not even the suspicion of a trace of these
  men. How did they get away from Cadiz? Not by rail, for all northward trains
  were stopped at Bobadilla and searched. Not by sea, for the only ship that
  left that night was the Brazilian man-o'-war, <i>Maria Braganza</i>"</p>

  <p>"Airship," suggested his Chief flippantly, as he moved towards the
  door.</p>

  <p>"It is unlikely, sir," replied T.B. coldly.</p>

  <p>The Chief Commissioner stood with his hand on the edge of the open
  door.</p>

  <p>"At any rate, they are finished," he said, "their power for further
  mischief is destroyed."</p>

  <p>"I appreciate your optimism, sir," said T.B. impertinently, "which I
  regret to say I do not share."</p>

  <p>Three months had passed since the disappearance of the "bears"; from that
  day no news had come which might even remotely associate them with a
  hiding-place.</p>

  <p>"One thing is evident, and must be remembered," T.B. went on, as his Chief
  still lingered. "Outside of the Nine Men there must be in Europe hundreds of
  agents, who without being aware of their principals, have been acting blindly
  for years in their interest. What of the men who went to the length of murder
  at Silinski's orders! What of the assassins in Europe and America who
  'arranged' the suicide of the Bank President and the wreck of the Sud
  Express? Not one of these men have we been able to track down. I tell you,
  sir, that outside of the inner council of this gang, Silinski organized as
  great a band of villains as the world has ever seen. They remain; this is an
  indisputable fact; somewhere in the world, scattered materially, but bound
  together by bonds of Silinski's weaving, are a number of men who formed the
  working parts of the Nine Men's great machine. For the moment the steam is
  absent&mdash;Yes?"</p>

  <p>A constable was at the door.</p>

  <p>"There is a lady to see you, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"Lady?" said T.B. wonderingly, for ladies were rare amongst his regular
  callers. "What does she want?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir, except that she wants to see you about some money,"
  said the man.</p>

  <p>T.B. looked up at his Chief in blank astonishment, and the elder man shook
  his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"I should never have suspected you, T.B.," he said sorrowfully, with which
  cryptic utterance he left T.B. alone to his interview.</p>

  <p>The lady was stout and voluble, respectable, middle class. Her ample bosom
  was a chaos of brooches, ranging in size from a half-crown to a coffee
  saucer. She was red of face and scant of breath, and with a gracious
  inclination of her head she took the seat to which T.B. motioned her.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Smith?"</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded, and the lady fumbled in a little black satin bag that hung
  from her wrist. It contained many things that rattled; it also contained a
  little notebook, which the lady extracted and opened.</p>

  <p>"On the 4th ultimo," she began.</p>

  <p>"May I ask, madam," interrupted T.B. Smith, with some little evidence of
  irritation, "exactly what your business is?"</p>

  <p>The lady shot at him a look in which reproof and indignation were
  blended.</p>

  <p>"I have some experience of the police," she said bitingly, "having given
  evidence against Gustav Heilberg, a house-boy charged at the West London
  Sessions with having stolen a ring valued at four guineas, the property
  of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The legal mind," she said, with a magnanimous sweep of her hand, "is not
  beyond my comprehension, ' These police officials are busy people; they want
  all the facts set forth clearly, concisely'&mdash;er, another word begins
  with 's' which has for the moment escaped me&mdash;yes, 'succinctly,' that is
  it."</p>

  <p>"To all this I agree," said T.B.; he walked to his desk and pressed a
  bell. "If it is another case of Gustav Heilberg, I will see that you are
  escorted to the proper department. I do not deal with these matters
  myself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" The lady raised a gleaming hand.</p>

  <p>"This is a matter of greater importance&mdash;it concerns you&mdash;and a
  lady."</p>

  <p>If his visitor intended shocking him she succeeded admirably.</p>

  <p>T.B.'s eyebrows rose, his lean jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"A matter of two hundred and fifty-five," said madam, holding her head
  till the ornament of her bonnet shivered again, "advanced to a friend of
  yours last week&mdash;I say advanced, because I want no unpleasantness. I
  think that it is right to explain that we were fellow-passengers&mdash;the
  money never left me day or night, being always wrapped up in my nightdress
  bag, placed under the pillow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I see!" A light was beginning to dawn on T.B. "You have been robbed and
  somebody has told you to come to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait," said the lady imposingly; "wait; by day I carried it in my
  bodice&mdash;such a nice gal she was, used to sit for hours talking about my
  late husband, and her brother was such a gentlemanly man with a little peaky
  beard and eyeglasses, like a young man I used to know at the Hydro at
  Malvern. Well, she talked and talked, she helped me with my packing; I went
  down to help her with hers, though she never asked me, and," said the lady,
  wagging an impressive finger; "the first thing I saw in her cabin was
  you."</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>T.B. stared at the lady blankly.</p>

  <p>"You," repeated the visitor, with evidence of the satisfaction that her
  startling news produced. "You as large as life; in a silver frame, propped up
  on the bunk."</p>

  <p>"'Who's that?'says I.</p>

  <p>"'A friend of mine,' says she, snatching up the photo. That was all. But I
  have a memory for faces; the other day I saw your portrait in the Police
  News&mdash;"</p>

  <p>T.B. made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"I saw your portrait in the Police News," she repeated, "and I says to
  myself, 'Ah, ha, my lady! I 'm going to call on this friend of
  yours.'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused and looked triumphantly at the detective.</p>

  <p>"Two hundred and fifty-five pounds in Bank of England notes," she said
  slowly, emphasizing each word with a jab of her right finger in the palm of
  her left hand. "Gone!"</p>

  <p>"When did you find this out?"</p>

  <p>T.B. was interested now, although filling in the spaces of her disjointed
  narrative, he perceived little more than a fairly common story of an ordinary
  theft.</p>

  <p>"When I got to Euston the money was in my jewel-case; my card-case was
  packed in it, and I wanted to give my card to a very charming girl I met in
  the train&mdash;niece of a Lord Somebody or other&mdash;I opened the
  case&mdash;gone!"</p>

  <p>Again she stopped.</p>

  <p>"Well!" said the detective. "What do you expect me to do?"</p>

  <p>"Find my money," said the lady complacently. "If she knows you, you must
  know her."</p>

  <p>"What was her name?"</p>

  <p>"Mad'moozle de Verdum."</p>

  <p>The detective shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know the name," he said, "and if I did, I don't suppose I could
  find her; you may be sure that if she is a professional thief she has left
  England&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She is here; I saw her today. I was on the top of a 'bus, and she was in
  a carriage," said the lady bitterly, "paid for out of my money; you don't
  know her name, de Verdum!"</p>

  <p>"I do not," said T.B., and rose to signify that the interview was
  finished.</p>

  <p>"Suppose she had another name; suppose the name I saw on a card in her
  cabin was her name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In that case," said T.B. wearily, "you had better give me that also."</p>

  <p>For a moment the lady groped in the recesses of her satin bag, and after
  what looked like developing into an interminable search, she produced a
  card.</p>

  <p>"Here it is," she said, and read:</p>

  <p>"'Catherine Silinski.'"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap27"
     name="chap27">XXVII. &mdash; IN THE RECORD OFFICE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">T.B. spun round as though the lash of a whip had caught
  him.</p>

  <p>"Silinski&mdash;Catherine Silinski&mdash;here?" he breathed.</p>

  <p>"Here!" said the triumphant lady. "Now, will you tell me that you can't
  get my money back?"</p>

  <p>"It's incredible, unthinkable!"</p>

  <p>Silinski in London!</p>

  <p>As he stood, his mind busily engaged in speculation, his visitor grew
  impatient.</p>

  <p>"Two hundred and fifty-five pounds," she murmured absently.</p>

  <p>He looked up.</p>

  <p>"Your money, madam," he said briskly, "is the least important aspect of
  the question."</p>

  <p>The lady was not unnaturally annoyed.</p>

  <p>The little telegraph instrument near the chief inspector's desk began to
  click. In every police station throughout the Metropolis it snapped forth its
  message. In Highgate, in Camberwell, in sleepy Greenwich, in Ladywell, as in
  Stoke Newington. "Clickerty, clickerty, click," it went, hastily,
  breathlessly. It ran:</p>

  <p class="quote">"To all Stations:&mdash;Arrest and detain man and woman
  (here the descriptions followed) on a pharge of having stolen bank-notes to
  the amount of &pound;255 from Louisa Breddell, of Sloe Grove, Bayswater. All
  reserves out in plain clothes."</p>

  <p>All reserves out!</p>

  <p>That was a remarkable order. What was the importance of this theft of &pound;255
  that the whole of the London police force should be mobilized to find the
  thief?</p>

  <p>London did not know of the happening; the homeward-bound suburbanite may
  have noticed a couple of keen-faced men standing idly near the entrance of
  the railway station, may have seen a loiterer on the platform&mdash;a
  loiterer who apparently had no train to catch. Curious men, too, came to the
  hotels, lounging away the whole evening in the entrance hall, mildly
  interested in people who came or went. Even the tram termini were not
  neglected, nor the theatre queues, nor the boarding-houses of Bloomsbury.
  Throughout London, from East to West, North to South, the work that Scotland
  Yard had set emissaries to perform, was swiftly and expeditiously carried
  out.</p>

  <p>T.B. sat all that evening in his office waiting. One by one little pink
  slips were carried in to him and laid upon the desk before him.</p>

  <p>As the evening advanced they increased in number and length.</p>

  <p>At eight o'clock came a wire:</p>

  <p>"Not leaving by Hook of Holland route."</p>

  <p>Soon after nine:</p>

  <p>"Continental mail clear."</p>

  <p>Then in rapid succession the great caravanserai reported themselves.
  Theatres, bars, restaurants, every place in London where men and women gather
  together, sent, through the plain-clothes watchers, their messages.</p>

  <p>T.B.'s hope lay in the woman. Without her, Silinski might hide himself in
  some obscure slum in the Metropolis. At eleven o 'clock he was reading a
  telegram from Harwich when the telephone, at his elbow buzzed.</p>

  <p>He took up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Hullo," he said curtly.</p>

  <p>For a second there was no reply, and then, very clear and distinct, came a
  voice.</p>

  <p>"T.B. Smith, I presume."</p>

  <p>It was the voice of Silinski.</p>

  <p>If there had been anybody in the room, but T.B. they might have imagined
  it was a very ordinary call he was receiving. Save for the fact that his face
  twitched, as was a characteristic of his when labouring under any great
  excitement, he gave no sign of the varied emotions Silinski's voice had
  aroused.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am T.B. Smith; you are, of course, Silinskif"</p>

  <p>"I am, of course, Silinski," said the voice suavely, "and it is on the tip
  of your tongue to ask me where I am."</p>

  <p>"I am hardly as foolish as that,' said T.B. drily; "but wherever you
  are&mdash;and I gather from the clearness of your voice that you are in
  London&mdash;I shall have you."</p>

  <p>There was a little laugh at the other end of the wire.</p>

  <p>T.B.'s hand stole out and pressed a little bell-push that rested on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Silinski's voice mockingly. "I am in London. I am desirous of
  knowing where my friends have hidden."</p>

  <p>"Your friends?" T.B. was genuinely astonished.</p>

  <p>"My friends," said the voice gravely, "who so ungenerously left me to die
  on the salt plains near Jerez whilst they were making their escape."</p>

  <p>A constable entered the room whilst Silinski was talking, and T.B. raised
  his hand warningly.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he said carelessly, "why you have not joined them."</p>

  <p>Then, like a flash, he brought his hand down over the transmitter and
  turned to the waiting constable.</p>

  <p>"Run across to Mr. Elk's room," he said rapidly; "call the Treasury
  Exchange and ask what part of London&mdash;what office&mdash;this man is
  speaking to me from."</p>

  <p>Silinski was talking before T.B. had finished giving his instructions.</p>

  <p>"Why have I not joined them," said Silinski, and there was a little
  bitterness in his voice, "because they do not wish to have me. Silinski has
  served his purpose. Where are they now? that is what I wish to know. More
  important still, I greatly desire a piece of information which you alone,
  se&ntilde;or, can afford me."</p>

  <p>The sublime audacity of the man brought a grin to T.B.'s face.</p>

  <p>"And that is!" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There was," said Silinski, "amongst the documents you found at our
  headquarters in Jerez a scrap of paper written somewhat unintelligibly, and
  apparently&mdash;I should imagine, for I have not seen it&mdash;without much
  meaning."</p>

  <p>"There was," said T.B. cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"So much I gathered from Baggin's agitation on our retreat," said
  Silinski. "Where, may I ask, is this interesting piece of literature
  deposited?"</p>

  <p>The cool, matter-of-fact demand almost took T.B.'s breath away.</p>

  <p>"It is at present at Scotland Yard," he said.</p>

  <p>"With my&mdash;er&mdash;dossier?" asked the voice, and a little laugh
  followed.</p>

  <p>"Rather with the dossier of your friend, Bag-gin," said T.B.</p>

  <p>"In case I should ever want to burgle Scotland Yard," said the drawling
  voice again, "could you give me explicit instructions where to find it?"</p>

  <p>T.B.'s anxiety was to keep Silinski engaged in conversation until the
  officer he had dispatched to the telephone returned.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "at present it is in the cabinet marked 'Unclassified
  Data,' but I cannot promise you that it will remain there. You see, Silinski,
  I have too high an opinion of your enterprise and daring."</p>

  <p>He waited for a reply, but no reply came, and at that moment the door
  opened and the constable he had sent on the errand appeared. T.B. covered the
  transmitter again.</p>

  <p>"The Treasury say that you are not connected with anybody, sir," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>T.B. stared at him.</p>

  <p>He moved his hand from the transmitter and called softly, "Silinski."</p>

  <p>There was no reply, and he called again.</p>

  <p>He looked up with the receiver still at his ear.</p>

  <p>"He's rung off."</p>

  <p>Then a new voice spoke.</p>

  <p>"Finished, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No, who are you?" demanded T.B. quickly.</p>

  <p>"Exchange, sir&mdash;Private Exchange, Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>"Who was talking to me then! Where was he talking from?"</p>

  <p>"Why, from the Record Office."</p>

  <p>T.B., his face white, leaped to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Follow me," he said, and went racing down the long corridor. He went down
  the broad stairs three at a time.</p>

  <p>A constable on duty in the hall turned in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Has anybody left here recently?" asked T.B. breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman just gone out, sir," said the man; "went away in a
  motor-car&mdash;lady driving."</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Elk in the building?"</p>

  <p>"In the Record Office, sir," said the man.</p>

  <p>Up the stairs again flew the detective. The Record Office was at the far
  end of the building.</p>

  <p>The door was ajar and the room in darkness, but T.B. was in the room and
  had switched on the light.</p>

  <p>In the centre of the room was stretched the unfortunate Elk, in a pool of
  blood. A life-preserver lay near him. T.B. leant over him; he was alive, but
  terribly injured; then he shot a swift glance round the room. He saw the
  telephone with the receiver off; he saw an open cabinet marked "Unclassified
  Data," and it was empty.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap28"
     name="chap28">XXVIII. &mdash; THE LOST WARSHIP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TRANSLATION of an extract from a little memorandum book
  found in Gregory Silinski's house in St. John Street and now in possession of
  the Police Authorities.</p>

  <p class="quote">"It may be said that life is fairly crude, from the
  standpoint of the professional writer, and ' True Stories' have a singular
  knack of being remarkably dull.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Thus in actuality it very often happens that denouements
  have a knack of postponing themselves for a dozen years or so&mdash;a dozen
  years that enables the hero to grow fat and the heroine to lose a little of
  the bloom of youth and develop characteristics which are not in harmony with
  one's original conception of her character.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Very few indeed of the stories, tragic or comic, of real
  life, make good 'book tales,' because life is made up of anti-climaxes, and
  because the villains of life more often than not live to be respected, and
  virtue so frequently goes to the wall before an unappreciative world can
  realize its immense and gratifying worth."</p>

  <p>One need not be an admirer of Silinski to agree with the truth of much
  that he has said. Silinski was a philosopher, without being a gentleman.</p>

  <p>It may be that on the slender basis of his philosophy he depended too
  implicitly. He would argue that since his case was one of actuality he was
  safe in putting back the denouement for a dozen years or so. More he may have
  entertained visions of a respectable old age&mdash;of a Silinski
  white-haired, benevolent, and venerated, musing in his dotage of virtuous
  competitors buried and forgotten.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the story of the "Nine Bears" is a "book" story&mdash;one
  of a very few, and the denouement came with disconcerting swiftness. To such
  comfort as he might extract from his philosophy he was welcome.</p>

  <p>T.B. Smith was a philosopher, but of another type; his attitude in the
  face of blame was one of stoical equanimity; before a too lavish award of
  praise he was cynically tolerant.</p>

  <p>There might have been blame in plenty, if the news of the outrage at
  Scotland Yard leaked out, but, fortunately, Elk was not killed and the world
  was unaware of the happening.</p>

  <p>Silinski had escaped; there was pother enough; eight of the Nine Bears had
  melted into nothingness; no official feather came to T.B.'s cap for that,
  whatever praise the mistaken public might award. Worst of all, the Record
  Office at Scotland Yard had been burgled and important documents had been
  stolen.</p>

  <p>Their contents were not lost to the police, for Scotland Yard does not put
  all its eggs into one basket, even when the basket is as secure a one as the
  Record Office. There were photographs innumerable of the scrap of paper, and
  one of these was on T.B. Smith's desk the morning after the robbery.</p>

  <p>The memorandum, for such it was, was contained in less than a hundred
  words. Literally, and with all its erasures written out, it ran:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Idea (crossed out). Ideas (written again). Suppose we
  separated; where to meet; allowing for accidental partings; must be some
  spot; yet that would be dangerous; otherwise, must be figures easily
  remembered; especially as none of these people have knowledge (crossed out
  and rewritten); especially as difficult for non-technical (word
  undecipherable) to fix in mind, and one cipher makes all difference. Lolo be
  good, accessible, unfrequented. Suggest on first Ju every year we rendezvous
  at Lolo.</p>

  <p class="quote">("Mem.&mdash;Lolo would indeed be nowhere!)</p>

  <p class="quote">"So far have only explained to Zillier."</p>

  <p>That was all, and T.B. read and re-read the memorandum. Zillier was the
  only man who knew. By the oddest of chances, Baggin had confided his plans to
  the one man who might have found them useful if Providence had given him one
  chance of escape. But the French Government had him safe enough on Devil's
  Island.</p>

  <p>For the rest, the "note" needed much more explanation than he could give
  it. He took a pen and began to group the sentences he could not understand.
  "Must be some spot, yet that would be dangerous; otherwise must be figures
  easily remembered."</p>

  <p>A spot would be dangerous? He was perplexed, and showed it. What was meant
  by "spot"?</p>

  <p>He grinned faintly, remembering a famous legal quibble as to what was a
  "place" within the meaning of an Act. Any given point on the earth's surface
  was a "spot," so what could the "otherwise" mean? Somewhere that was not on
  the earth? He smiled again. In the air? What were the figures&mdash;and
  technical figures at that?</p>

  <p>"On the 1st of Ju we rendezvous at Lolo&mdash;nowhere!"</p>

  <p>"This is absolute nonsense!" The detective threw down his pen and jumped
  up. "I'll go over to the hospital and see old man Elk."</p>

  <p>He called at the Chief Commissioner's office and was received
  cordially.</p>

  <p>"Any news, T.B? what do you make of your puzzle?"</p>

  <p>T.B. made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he said, "and if the original had not been stolen I should not
  have troubled to study it"</p>

  <p>He gained the Strand by a short cut.</p>

  <p>A contents bill attracted his attention, and he stopped to buy an evening
  newspaper.</p>

  <p class="headline">"LOSS OF A WARSHIP"</p>

  <p>He turned the paper before he discovered the small paragraph that
  justified so large a bill.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"The Brazilian Government has sent another cruiser to
  search for the Brazilian man-of-war, <i>Maria Braganza</i>, which is a month
  overdue. It is feared that the warship foundered in the recent cyclone in the
  South Atlantic."</p>

  <p>"<i>Maria Braganza</i>?" thought T.B.&mdash;and remembered where he had
  seen the vessel.</p>

  <p>The ship and her fate passed out of his mind soon afterward, for he had a
  great deal of routine work requiring his attention; but the name cropped up
  again in the course of the day and in a curious manner.</p>

  <p>A drunken sailor, obviously of foreign extraction, was ejected, fighting
  from a small public-house in the Edgware Road. He rose from the ground
  slowly, and stood apparently debating in his mind whether he should go away
  quietly or whether he should return to the attack. It is not too much to say
  that had he decided upon the pacific course, the mystery of the whereabouts
  of the Nine Bears might never have been elucidated. In that two seconds of
  deliberation hung the fates of Baggin and his confederates, of Silinski and
  his sister, indeed of the reputation of Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>The foreign sailor made up his mind. Back to the swing doors of the tavern
  he staggered, pushed them open and entered.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later a police whistle blew, a commonplace constable
  strolled leisurely to the scene of the disturbance and took into custody the
  pugnacious foreigner on a charge of "drunk and disorderly."</p>

  <p>This was the beginning of the final fight with the "bears," a fight which
  cost Europe a million of money and many lives, but which closed for ever the
  account of the Nine Bears of Cadiz.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap29"
     name="chap29">XXIX. &mdash; SILINSKI UNDERSTANDS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHAT "double chambers" are to the dramatist, parallel
  columns are to the journalist; in the former you see two actions going on at
  the same time, in the latter you may observe two minds working differently to
  the same end.</p>

  <p>Thus Gregory Silinski of Paris and T.B. Smith in London.</p>

  <p>You may picture Silinski on a day in April, when Paris was awakening to
  spring-time, and the branches of the trees in the Bois de Boulogne vivid
  green. A day very balmy, with a hint of early summer, with no bite in the
  breeze that came in soft gusts along the Boulevard des Capucines.</p>

  <p>Every day to the Coq d'Or came a thoughtful student, clean-shaven, dressed
  in shabby black, with a cravat sufficiently extravagant to suggest art, and
  spectacles business-like enough to hint at medicine. This Monsieur Flamarrion
  lived in the Montmartre, and described himself as a mechanical engineer. He
  was&mdash;so said his papers&mdash;from Bayonne.</p>

  <p>He came, naturally enough, under the observation of the police, and was
  reported to be a bachelor of "studious and virtuous" habits; he had, said the
  report, "ne pas ami intime." Your Parisian detective, by nature suspicious,
  differs materially from his brother at Scotland Yard. In the first place, he
  concentrates his attentions too fiercely and is too readily swayed by first
  impressions. Under his terrific scrutiny and examinations the newly observed
  takes on a permanent character. Thus M. Flamarrion, a newcomer to Paris,
  endured the embarrassing attention of the French police for exactly two days,
  and was passed as "harmless."</p>

  <p>And all this time, T.B. Smith was imploring the French authorities to keep
  a strict watch on Silinski. Every day came M. Flamarrion to soak his brioch
  in his coffee and read patiently and thoroughly the <i>Journal des
  D&eacute;bats</i>.</p>

  <p>Every day, too, to this admirable tavern came a young lady, heavily veiled
  and wearing the evidence of recent widowhood.</p>

  <p>They did not sit at the same table, but generally they were near enough to
  exchange furtive glances and conventional politeness.</p>

  <p>"May I offer you <i>Le Matin</i>, madame?"</p>

  <p>"I am obliged to you, monsieur."</p>

  <p>Thus would Silinski communicate with his sister, for always, with the
  newspaper he so politely tendered, would be a letter giving her his news, his
  plans, and such money as she required.</p>

  <p>This April morning Catherine read her note with some trepidation. There
  was a little flush on Silinski's cheek when he greeted her, Iris eyes were a
  thought too bright, and his nod lacked the pretence of deference which
  usually marked it.</p>

  <p>More than this, he threw away all pretence of strangership and called her
  to his table.</p>

  <p>"Catherine," he said quickly, "we must leave Paris."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Our friend, Zillier!" he said, dropping his voice. "Consider it, little
  one! Whilst we are at liberty he languishes on in chains! A prisoner, a
  dog!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>His eyes were dancing, that little patch of red was in his face; she knew
  they stood on the threshold of a great enterprise.</p>

  <p>"I cannot sleep at nights," he went on. "I start up and see Zillier in his
  cage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Gregory," she said steadily, "why do you talk thus to me?"</p>

  <p>He was not abashed.</p>

  <p>"Little one," he said exultantly, "I talk thus because I feel thus.
  Zillier means a return to the grip of things. Baggin has gone, and with him
  my good fortune; you cannot any more secure employment; we have had to
  descend to petty robberies to sustain life. The Nine Men I made!" he said,
  and, since the cafe was empty, he indulged in his favourite gesture. "I
  created them, their machinery, their organization, their very code. And now!
  I have on my hands a hundred and one bold gentlemen who, their fortunes being
  bound in mine, find their means of living gone. On the one hand, I am sought
  by the police, who want my life, on the other by my agents, who want my
  money&mdash;of the two I fear the police least."</p>

  <p>He paused to sip his coffee.</p>

  <p>"From police and friends I have one refuge&mdash;the Nine Men of Cadiz;
  now the eight men of nowhere and the one of Devil's Island. How to join
  forces&mdash;how to reach Mr. Baggin, that is the question."</p>

  <p>He took a scrap of paper from his pocket-book.</p>

  <p>"This was valueless to me until to-day," he said, tapping the paper. "It
  gave me no clue as to the means by which my friends escaped, vanished into
  the void; but to-day has come a great light. We go to join our friends!"</p>

  <p>So much for Silinski, who, as we now know, left Paris that night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap30"
     name="chap30">XXX. &mdash; WHAT THE SAILOR SAID</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE solution of the "note" did not come so quickly to T.B.,
  because his mind could not jump as Silinski's did.</p>

  <p>"Here is a case that will amuse you, T.B.," said the Chief, strolling into
  his bureau; "a man, giving the name of Silva, who has been taken to the
  police-station on the prosaic charge of 'D. and D.', is found to be a walking
  cash deposit. Twelve hundred pounds in Bank of England notes and 26,000
  francs in French money was found in his possession. He speaks little or no
  English, has the appearance of being a sailor&mdash;will you go down and see
  what you can make of him?"</p>

  <p>In a quarter of an hour the Assistant-Commissioner was at the police-
  station.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the station sergeant, "he's quiet now. I don't think he's
  so very drunk, only pugilistically so."</p>

  <p>"What do you make of him?" "He's a sailor; a deserter from some foreign
  navy, I should say. He has underclothes of a uniform type, and there's a sort
  of device on his singlet&mdash;three stars and a number."</p>

  <p>"Brazilian Navy," said T.B. with promptness. "Talkative!"</p>

  <p>The sergeant smiled.</p>

  <p>"In his own language, very," he said drily. "When I searched him, he said
  a great number of things which were probably very rude."</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'll see him," he said.</p>

  <p>A gaoler led him down a long corridor.</p>

  <p>On either side were long stone-painted doors, each with a little steel
  wicket.</p>

  <p>Stopping before one door, he inserted his bright key in the lock, snapped
  back a polished bolt, and the door swung open.</p>

  <p>A man who was sitting on a wooden bench with his head in his hands, jumped
  to his feet as the Assistant-Commissioner entered, and poured forth a volume
  of language.</p>

  <p>"Softly, softly," said T.B. "You speak Spanish, my friend."</p>

  <p>"Si, se&ntilde;or," said the man. "I am Spanish."</p>

  <p>"That is good, for I cannot speak Portuguese," said T.B.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing of Portuguese," said the man quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yet you are a deserter from a Brazilian warship," said T.B.</p>

  <p>The man stared at him defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Is not that so, friend?"</p>

  <p>The prisoned shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I should like to smoke," was all that he said.</p>

  <p>T.B. took his gold case from an inside pocket and opened it.</p>

  <p>"Many thanks," said the sailor, and took the lighted match the gaoler had
  struck.</p>

  <p>If he had known the ways of the English police, he would have grown
  suspicious. Elsewhere, a man might be bullied, browbeaten, frightened into a
  confession. In France, Juge destruction and detective would combine to wring
  from his reluctant lips a damaging admission. In America, the Third Degree,
  most despicable of police methods, would have been similarly employed.</p>

  <p>But the English police do most things by kindness, and do them very
  well.</p>

  <p>The sailor puffed at his cigarette, from time to time looking up from the
  bench on which he sat at the detective's smiling face.</p>

  <p>T.B. asked no questions; he had none to ask; he did not demand how the man
  came by his wealth; he would not be guilty of such a crudity. He waited for
  the sailor to talk. As last he spoke,</p>

  <p>"Se&ntilde;or," he said, "you wish to know where I got my money?"</p>

  <p>T.B. said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Honestly," said the sailor, loudly, and with emphatic gesture, "honestly,
  se&ntilde;or," and he went on earnestly, "By my way of reckoning a man has a
  price."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," agreed T.B.</p>

  <p>"A price for body and soul." The sailor blew a ring of smoke and watched
  it rise to the vaulted roof of the cell.</p>

  <p>"Some men," continued the man, "in their calm moments set their value at
  twenty million dollars&mdash;only to sell themselves in the heat of a foolish
  moment for " he snapped his fingers.</p>

  <p>"I have never," thought T.B., "come into contact with so many
  philosophical criminals in my life."</p>

  <p>"Yet I would beg you to believe," said the sailor&mdash;and I would ask
  the reader to realize that he was speaking in Spanish, which gives even to
  the uneducated speech a certain literary pedantry&mdash;" it is a question of
  opportunity and need. There are moments when I would not risk my liberty for
  a million pesetas&mdash;there have been days when I would have sold my soul
  for ten mil-r&eacute;is."</p>

  <p>He paused again, for he had all the Latin's appreciation of an audience;
  all the Latin's desire for dramatic effect.</p>

  <p>"Sixty thousand pesetas is a large sum, se&ntilde;or; it amounts to more than
  &pound;2,000 in your money&mdash;that was my price!"</p>

  <p>"For what?"</p>

  <p>"I will set you a riddle: on the <i>Maria Braganza</i> we had one hundred
  officers and men&mdash;"</p>

  <p>T.B. saw light.</p>

  <p>"You are a deserter from the <i>Maria Braganza</i>" he said&mdash;but the
  man shook his head smilingly.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary I have my discharge from the navy, properly attested and
  signed by my good Captain. You will find it at my lodgings, in a tin trunk
  under a picture of the blessed Saint Teressa of Avila, or, as some say,
  Sergovia. No, se&ntilde;or officer, I am discharged honourably. Listen."</p>

  <p>His cigarette was nearly finished and T.B. opened his case again, and the
  man, with a grateful inclination of his head, helped himself. Slowly he began
  his story, a story which before all others, I think, helps the mind to grasp
  the magnitude of a combination which made the events he described
  possible.</p>

  <p>"I was a sub-officer on the <i>Maria Braganza</i>," he began, and went on
  to narrate the history of the voyage of that remarkable battleship from the
  day it left Eio, until it steamed into the roadstead off Cadiz.</p>

  <p>"We stayed at Cadiz much longer than we expected, and the men were
  grumbling&mdash;because our next port was to have been Rio. But for some
  reason our Captain did not wish to sail. Then one day he came on
  board&mdash;he spent most of his time ashore&mdash;looking extremely happy.
  Previous to this he had lived and walked in gloom, as though some matter were
  preying on his mind. But this was all changed now. Whatever troubles he had
  were evaporated. He walked about the deck, smiling and cracking jokes, and we
  naturally concluded that he had received his orders to sail back to Brazil at
  once.</p>

  <p>"That same day we were ordered to take on board stores which the
  government had purchased. Whatever stores these were, they were extremely
  heavy. They were packed in little square boxes, strongly made and clamped
  with steel. Of these boxes we took two hundred and fifty, and the business of
  transporting them occupied the greater part of a whole day."</p>

  <p>"What was the weight of them?" asked T.B.</p>

  <p>"About fifty kilos," said the man, "and," he added, with an assumption of
  carelessness, "they each contained gold."</p>

  <p>T.B. did a little sum in his head.</p>

  <p>"In fact a million and a half of English pounds," he said half to
  himself.</p>

  <p>"As to that I do not know," said the other, "but it was enormous; I
  discovered the gold by accident, for I and another officer had been chosen to
  store the boxes in one of the ammunition flats, and owing to the breaking of
  a box I saw&mdash;what I saw."</p>

  <p>"However, to get back to the Captain. In the evening he came aboard,
  having first given orders for steam to be ready and every preparation made
  for slipping."</p>

  <p>"Then it was I told him I had seen the contents of one of the boxes, and
  he was distressed.</p>

  <p>"'Who else has seen this?' he asked, and I informed him of the sub-officer
  who had been with me.</p>

  <p>"'Do not speak of this matter, as you value your soul,' he said, 'for this
  is a high Government secret&mdash;send sub-officer Alverez to me'&mdash;that
  was the name of my companion. I obeyed and sent Alverez aft. He too, received
  similar injunctions, and was dismissed.</p>

  <p>"At ten o'clock that night, the quarter-masters went to their stations,
  and all stood ready for dropping our mooring.</p>

  <p>"As the hours wore on, the Captain began to show signs of impatience. I
  was on the bridge with the officer of the watch, and the Captain was pacing
  up and down, now looking at his watch and swearing, now training his
  binocular on a portion of the land to the north of the town.</p>

  <p>"I had forogtten to say that at 8.30 the ship's steam pinnace had been
  sent away, and that it had not returned.</p>

  <p>"It was for the coming of the pinnace, and whoever was coming with it,
  that our Captain displayed so much anxiety.</p>

  <p>"It was eleven o'clock before the boat came alongside. "We heard it racing
  across the water&mdash;for the night was very still. Then it drew alongside,
  and a number of gentlemen came on board. They were all talking excitedly, and
  seemed as though they had walked a long distance, for, by the light of the
  branch lamp that lit the gangway I saw that their boots and trousers were
  white with dust, such as I believe lies on the road outside Cadiz. One was in
  a state of great fear; he was very stout. Another, and he was the leader,
  spoke to our Captain, and soon after I heard the order
  given&mdash;'Quartermaster, stand by for going out of harbour,' and the
  Captain gave the navigating officer his course. We went out at full speed,
  steering a course due west.</p>

  <p>"It was a perfectly calm night, with stars, but no moon. When (as near as
  I can guess) we were twenty miles from the coast, the Captain sent for me and
  Alverez to his cabin.</p>

  <p>"'My friends,' he said, 'I have a proposition to make to you, but first
  let me ask you if you are good patriots?'</p>

  <p>We said that we were.</p>

  <p>"'What,' said the Captain, addressing himself to me, 'do you value your
  patriotism at?'</p>

  <p>I was silent.</p>

  <p>"Se&ntilde;or," said the prisoner earnestly, "I assure you I was not considering
  the insult offered to me, because we had got to a point outside of abstract
  morality. In my mind was a dilemma&mdash;if I ask too little I should
  assuredly lose money. Such was also the consideration in Alverez's mind.
  'Se&ntilde;or Captain,' I said, 'as an honest man '</p>

  <p>"'We will leave that out of the question,' said the Captain. 'Name a
  price.'</p>

  <p>"And so, at random, I suggested a sum equal to &pound;3,000, and Alverez, not a
  man of any originality, repeated '&pound;3,000.'</p>

  <p>"The Captain nodded; 'This sum I will pay you,' he said. 'Moreover, I will
  give you your discharge from the navy of Brazil, and you may leave the ship
  tonight.'</p>

  <p>"I did not ask him why. I realized he had some high scheme which it was
  not proper I should know, besides which I had not been ashore for a
  month&mdash;and there was the &pound;3,000.</p>

  <p>"'Before you go,' said the Captain, 'I will explain to you that my honour
  and my reputation may not suffer. In a few days' time, when we are at sea,
  the comrades you leave behind will be offered a new service, a service under
  a new and wealthier Government, a Government that will offer large and
  generous rewards for faithful service and obedience.'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The prisoner chuckled softly, as at some thought which amused him.</p>

  <p>"We went ashore in the steam pinnace; the Captain himself superintending
  our landing. It was a remarkable journey, se&ntilde;or.</p>

  <p>"You may imagine us in the open sea, with nothing but the 'chica-clucka,
  clucka!' of the engine of our little boat; Alverez and myself sitting at the
  bow with our hands on the butts of our revolvers&mdash;we knew onr
  Captain&mdash;and he himself steering us for the lights that soon came up
  over the horizon. "We landed at Cadiz, and were provided with papers to the
  Brazilian Consul, should our return be noticed. But none saw us, or if they
  did, thought nothing of the spectacle of two Brazilian seamen walking through
  the streets at that hour of the night; remember that none but the port
  authorities were aware that the <i>Maria Braganza</i> had sailed. The next
  morning we procured some civilian clothing, and left by the afternoon train
  for Seville. By easy stages we came first to Madrid, then to Paris. Here we
  stayed some time."</p>

  <p>He chuckled again.</p>

  <p>"Alverez," he resumed, "is a man of spirit, but, as I have said, of no
  great originality. In Paris a man of spirit may go far, a man of money
  farther, always providing that behind the spirit and the wealth there is
  intelligence. My poor Alverez went his own way in Paris. He made
  friends."</p>

  <p>Again he smiled thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Alverez I left," he explained; "his ways are not my ways. I came to
  England. I do not like this country," he said frankly. "Your lower classes
  are gross people, and very quarrelsome." A few more questions were asked, and
  answered, and ten minutes later T.B. was flying back to Scotland Yard with
  the story of the stolen battleship.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap31"
     name="chap31">XXXI. &mdash; THE "MARIA BRAGANZA"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ONCE more were the Nine Men in the bill of every newspaper
  in London. Once more the cables hummed from world's end to world's end, and
  slowly, item by item, came fragmentary scraps of news which Scotland Yard
  pieced together.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Of all extraordinary developments," said the <i>London
  Journal</i>, "in any great criminal case, nothing has ever equalled in its
  improbability, the present phase of this remarkable case. Our readers will
  remember..." (here the <i>Journal</i> went on to give the story of the
  inception and progress of the Nine Men in their schemes&mdash;a story with
  which the reader is already familiar).</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"And now we have reached the stage which we confidently
  hope will be a final one. It is clear that these men, having command of
  enormous riches, gained at the sacrifice of life, and by the ruin of
  thousands of innocent people, secured to their service the Captain of the
  Brazilian warship, <i>Maria Braganza</i>.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Captain Lombroza holds an unenviable reputation in the
  Brazilian navy. A Court of Inquiry had discovered that, for years, he had
  been systematically robbing the Brazilian Treasury, and the discovery of his
  speculation coincided with his disappearance; but not only with his
  disappearance but with the vanishing of the Brazilian Government 's
  battleship.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"It is not difficult to understand what arguments the
  Nine Men used to win over the crew of this unfortunate battleship. They had
  enormous wealth at their command; they could offer to pay salaries which, to
  the untutored men of the Brazilian Navy, must have seemed beyond the dreams
  of avarice.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"But what is the explanation of the discharge of Alverez
  and his companion?</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"To our minds it would seem tolerably easy. These two
  men of all the crew knew the extent of the riches brought on board the
  <i>Maria Braganza</i>. They of all the crew had a comprehension of the wealth
  of the Nine Men. They were dangerous men to have on board; their presence
  might mean mutiny, strikes, all the extraordinary consequences of a position
  which would be Gilbertian were it not for the note of tragedy that underlies
  the whole remarkable story.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"From the day the <i>Maria Braganza</i> left Cadiz it
  has, apparently, been lost to sight. We say 'apparently' because a closer
  inspection of shipping records leads us to the belief that this ship has not
  only been sighted, but has coaled at a British port. On the 16th of January,
  Lloyds published, amongst other arrivals, that of the Spinoza at Port
  Elizabeth. At first, this was reported to be a warship flying the flag of
  Venezuela. This was later corrected to Colombia, a mistake very easy to make
  if one were to judge the nationality of a ship by its ensign; for, save for a
  small emblem in the centre of the flags, both these countries display a
  similar ensign. A reference to the battleships of the world, shows us that no
  such warship exists, and later advices from the Cape go to prove that the
  vessel that came in, coaled and took stores so hurriedly, was none other than
  the <i>Maria Braganza</i>, So that somewhere in the wide seas of the world is
  a stolen battleship, having on board a congregation of the world's worst
  rascals, Napoleonic in the largeness of their crimes. But money, which can do
  much, cannot do all, and it is necessary that these men, no less than the
  ship's company, should obtain stores and food, and the necessities of life;
  more important still, that they should secure the coal that is so necessary a
  part of the ships equipment. In this respect we have made one or two
  important discoveries.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"An examination of the shipping list shows that two
  months ago three colliers were chartered out of Cardiff. There is nothing
  remarkable in this fact, and their apparent destination excited no comment at
  the time. They were ordered to very usual ports in South America, but it is
  an extraordinary fact that the consignor in each case gave the captain sealed
  orders which were only to be opened at sea. So far, we have had no news from
  these ships, and it is the merest conjecture on our parts when we suppose the
  colliers were intended for the <i>Maria Braganza</i> and, that at some
  rendezvous, and at some appointed time, they were met by the warship in
  mid-ocean, and there transferred their cargo.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"But more mysterious is the chartering of the
  <i>Hedleigh Head</i>, a tramp steamer of 2,000 tons, which took on board, on
  the 16th of last month, one of the strangest cargoes that ship has ever
  taken. We now know that a month prior to this, one of the largest furnishing
  firms of the West End received an order to the extent of &pound;10,000, for the
  delivery of elaborate ship's fittings, intended, as it was said, for a South
  American yacht owner. The firm in question makes a specialty of such
  luxurious appointments, and such an order was not regarded as unusual, and so
  chairs, panels, upholstery of all kinds, paints, mouldings, and twelve
  magnificent cabin suites were placed on board the <i>Hedleigh Head</i>, and
  were ostentatiously consigned to Valparaiso. Here, again, the captain
  received sealed orders, and here again we think we are justified in assuming
  these goods were intended for the <i>Maria Braganza</i>; and that, so far
  from the ship's destination being Valparaiso, the cargo was met on the high
  seas and taken over.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Many and fantastic are the suggestions that have been
  put forward as to the whereabouts of the Nine Men of Cadiz. One of our
  contemporaries draws a fanciful picture of life on some gorgeous Southern
  Pacific Isle, out of the track of steamers, and pictures the Nine Men living
  in a condition of Oriental splendour, an existence of <i>dolce far
  niente</i>. Such a supposition is, of course, on the face of it, absurd. Such
  an island exists only in the fancy of the romantic writer. The uninhabited
  portions of the globe are few, and are in the main, of the character of the
  Sahara desert. Wherever life can be sustained, wherever comfort and freedom
  from disease waits the newcomer, be sure the newcomer has already
  arrived."</p>

  <p>I quote this much from the <i>Journal</i> because it is near enough to
  truth and actuality to merit quotation.</p>

  <p>That Baggin had based all his plans on the supposition that such an island
  existed, and could be discovered, we now know. He was the possessor of an
  imagination, but his geographical knowledge was faulty.</p>

  <p>The "idea," that scrap of paper which Silinski had risked his neck to
  obtain, was simple enough now&mdash;up to a point.</p>

  <p>The "Idea" "Suppose we separated, where to meet! Must be some spot yet
  that would be dangerous."</p>

  <p>"Otherwise, must be easily remembered. Especially as it is difficult for
  non-technical (?) to fix in mind, and one cypher makes all the
  difference."</p>

  <p>"Suggest we rendezvous at Lolo."</p>

  <p>The Solution "Some spot," meant some place on land.</p>

  <p>The latitude and longitude of sea rendezvous must be easy to remember.
  This last was the only part of the little clue that offered any difficulty to
  T.B. The Gazetteer supplied no explanation.</p>

  <p>Nor could the Admiralty help. The naval authorities did their best to
  unravel the mystery of "Lolo."</p>

  <p>T.B., who saw no reason to suppress such news as he had, and following the
  precedent he had established when he revealed the story of the deserter to
  the Press, called that engine to his aid, and all newspaperdom racked its
  brains to discover in "Lolo," a cryptic reference to some lonely Pacific
  island.</p>

  <p>Many and ingenious were the suggestions offered, but none found
  favour.</p>

  <p>A conference of the Ambassadors met in London, and it was jointly agreed
  that the nations should act in concert to bring the <i>Maria Braganza</i> and
  her crew to justice as speedily as possible. The Brazilian Government agreed
  to indemnify the Powers in their action, and in the event of the destruction
  of the ship being necessitated by resistance on the part of its rebel
  captain, to accept an agreed sum as compensation.</p>

  <p>There are surprising periods of inaction in the record of all great
  accomplishments, which those who read the stories of achievements,
  realize.</p>

  <p>There were weeks of fretting, and days of blank despair in one room at
  Scotland Yard. For the examination of all clues led to the one end. Somewhere
  in the world were the Nine Men of Cadiz&mdash;but where none could say. Every
  port in every civilized land was alert. Captains of mail steamers, of grimy
  little tramps, of war vessels of every nation, watched for the battleship.
  Three British cruisers, detached unostentatiously from the Home Fleet,
  cruised unlikely seas, but with no good result.</p>

  <p>Then began the new terror.</p>

  <p>T.B. had always had one uncomfortable feeling, a feeling that the
  dissipation of the Nine had not dispelled, and that was the knowledge that
  somewhere in Europe the machinery set up with devilish ingenuity by Silinski,
  still existed. Who were the desperate and broken men who acted as agents to
  the Nine? Whoever they were, they had been well chosen.</p>

  <p>Silinski possessed an extraordinary acquaintance with the criminal world.
  There was scarcely a land in which he had not been a sojourner, a citizen of
  the shades, more often than not, a fugitive of justice.</p>

  <p>That he then had a splendid opportunity of meeting with the very type
  which was ultimately to prove of such value to him, there can be no
  doubt.</p>

  <p>Investigations had not brought any of these men to the light of day; they
  lurked in the background&mdash;ominous, menacing, a constant danger.</p>

  <p>That danger was all the greater if Silinski had rejoined his accomplices,
  or if by any chance he had come into touch with them, as he boasted he
  had.</p>

  <p>This knowledge of danger was irritating, more irritating since it ran with
  the impatience engendered by inaction. For three weeks&mdash;three whole
  eternities&mdash;no word came of the <i>Maria Braganza</i>; then a Cape
  steamer picked up a ship's boat with a dead man and a rough wooden chest
  filled with English gold-coins. There were no papers, no name was painted on
  the little boat, but for the mystery of the tragic find T.B. had a solution
  which received official support. One of the crew of the Maria Barganza had
  looted the treasure and attempted to steal away by night. He had succeeded
  only too well.</p>

  <p>"This suggests," said T.B., "that at the time of the desertion the warship
  was within sailing distance from some coast, probably the isle of Sao Thome
  or Principe. The man, having no compass, took a wrong course; from the
  description he must have died of thirst."</p>

  <p>Two gunboats from the Cape station were sent to search those latitudes,
  but drew blank. The commander of the <i>Dwarf</i>, a small British gunboat,
  however, was partially successful, for it fell in with a Monrovian
  fishing-boat which had sighted a "big steamer" three weeks before, heading
  south.</p>

  <p>The British Government had taken every precaution to prevent supplies
  reaching the Nine. It was forbidden by a special Order in Council
  (colloquially known as "The 'Port to Port' Ordinance,") for ship's masters to
  sail with "sealed orders," or to discharge their cargoes elsewhere than at
  the ports specified on the ship's papers. Other nations had followed the
  lead, and the German Government instituted a vigilant surveillance of
  charters, a sort of charter parties' censorship which is in vogue to this
  day.</p>

  <p>The weeks passed without further news of the ship, and T.B. was beginning
  to worry, for good reasons. He had an elaborate chart supplied to him by the
  Admiralty, which showed him from day to day, the amount of provisions and
  coal such a ship as the <i>Maria Braganza</i> would require, and he knew that
  she must be running short.</p>

  <p>Then came news from Paris that trace of Silinski had been found; and,
  although the scent was old, T.B. crossed the Channel the day the message
  came.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The night of the 1st of March saw T.B. Smith in Paris. He
  stayed at the Hotel D'Antin in the Rue D'An tin, one of those cosy little
  hostels in which Paris abounds. His visit was partially successful. He had
  been able to find traces of Silinski and his sister; he found their lodgings
  without much difficulty. He found, with the aid of a French detective, the
  cafe affected by the precious pair, and in one way or another was able to
  collect quite a considerable amount of useful information regarding the
  Silinskis. He was idling away an, evening, sitting before the Cafe de la
  Paix, watching the ceaseless procession of people passing to and fro. This
  was a favourite amusement of his; indeed, is it not of every Englishman who
  finds himself in Paris with time on his hands?</p>

  <p>As he sat there sipping his coffee, a man left the pavement; and, pulling
  a chair towards the next table, seated himself. He was a thick-set man with a
  straggling beard, and there was little to distinguish him from the ordinary
  citizen. T.B. gave him a glance and resumed his survey of the passing crowd.
  By and by, his attention was again attracted to the neighbonring table by the
  arrival of another man equally undistinguished. The two men apparently knew
  one another, for, after a curt meeting, they plunged into a conversation,
  which was carried on in such low tones that no word reached the
  detective.</p>

  <p>Now, if T.B. had not been a born policeman, he would have been a born
  journalist, for his ruling passion was an intense curiosity. For aught that
  he knew, these two might have been engaged in the discussion of some private
  business matter; the subject of their conversation might indeed have had
  reference to some intimate family secret. But no sooner had these two very
  ordinary citizens given evidence of their wish for privacy, than T.B. was
  overpowered with a desire to act the eavesdropper.</p>

  <p>But his unpardonable curiosity was unrewarded save that, by one expression
  which reached him, he gathered that the conversation was either in Low German
  or Flemish.</p>

  <p>"Mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble," said one rapidly.</p>

  <p>"So!" said the other nodding.</p>

  <p>"Mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble."</p>

  <p>"Ja," said the other, and added something in a lower tone.</p>

  <p>T.B. was annoyed, not with himself that he should be acting the spy on
  apparently innocent people; he had no conscience in the matter&mdash;but
  because of the extraordinary and unnecessary care these people were taking to
  keep their affairs to themselves.</p>

  <p>He had a good working knowledge of Flemish&mdash;which is Cape Dutch with
  variations&mdash;and he was in a position to understand anything they might
  say, if they would only have the grace to say it aloud.</p>

  <p>At last he gave up his attempt at hearing, in disgust, and opening the
  <i>Journal du Soir</i>, began to read a particularly lurid story of an Apache
  murder in the Montmartre.</p>

  <p>"Mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble," went on the voices; and T.B., in his
  unjustifiable annoyance, thought twice about the advisability of changing his
  seat.</p>

  <p>He read the case through, turned over a leaf to a brilliant, if wholly
  illogical article on one of France's inevitable "situations," and was half
  way through it; then suddenly he stopped reading, and, though his eyes did
  not leave the printed page, every nerve in his body awoke to life.</p>

  <p>"Mumble, mumble, mumble, Silinski, mumble, ship, mumble." He waited. The
  voices kept up their monotonous burden.</p>

  <p>"Silinski&mdash;ship!"</p>

  <p>That was all; he heard no other word that gave him further clue to the
  subject of the conversation, but "Silinski&mdash;ship" was enough. By and by,
  he saw a French detective stroll past, saw the swift and apparently careless
  scrutiny of the officer, and caught his eye. The sign T.B. gave was
  imperceptible to any save one acquainted with the universal sign-language of
  the great police world, but the French detective, seeing T.B. rubbing his
  right eye as if to keep himself awake, knew that he was required, and walking
  along to the corner of the Place de l'Opera, waited. T.B. was with him in
  less than a minute, and rapidly explained. The detective listened. He had
  noticed the men.</p>

  <p>"If Monsieur le Commissaire will return to the cafe and invent some excuse
  for detaining them, I will do all that is necessary."</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded and returned to the cafe. The men were settling with the
  waiter when T.B. returned to his seat, with two or three newspapers he had
  hurriedly purchased at the corner kiosque as an excuse for his absence.</p>

  <p>As they rose, T.B. looked the man with the beard in the face, and,
  smiling, nodded.</p>

  <p>He saw the gathering frown of suspicion, and said. "M. Herhault, n'est ce
  que pas?"</p>

  <p>"You are mistaken, monsieur," said the man coldly.</p>

  <p>"Pardon," T.B. made haste to say with profound humility, "but I am in
  error. I thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good-night, m'sieur," said the other curtly, and turned to go.</p>

  <p>"One moment." T.B. laid his hand on the man's arm. "I cannot allow you to
  go under a misapprehension; will you be seated whilst I explain how I came to
  make the mistake?"</p>

  <p>"Your explanation is unnecessary," said the man shortly. "I beg you not to
  detain me."</p>

  <p>T.B. with one eye for the promenading crowd, saw the French detective
  pass.</p>

  <p>"I will not detain you, m'sieur," he said, with a slight bow.</p>

  <p>The two men turned out of the cafe. He watched them as they crossed the
  Place, going in the direction of the Eue de la Paix.</p>

  <p>At a distance he followed, and saw them turn into a side street. He
  quickened his steps; and, as he rounded the corner, he came upon a little
  group in the deserted street. The two men were surrounded by half a dozen
  plain clothes officers.</p>

  <p>They were expostulating vigorously, and their captors stood impassively
  by.</p>

  <p>As T.B. came up to the group two of the French officers took an arm each
  of the arrested men, whilst one whistled a cab.</p>

  <p>T.B. did not follow to the Commissaire's office. He had told the detective
  all he had heard, and he was content to leave the matter at that.</p>

  <p>He returned to his hotel, and waited. It was near midnight before the
  French officer came.</p>

  <p>"We have searched their lodgings, and can find nothing but a little
  drawing of the cardinal points of the compass," he said.</p>

  <p>"Do they deny knowledge of Silinski?"</p>

  <p>The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"They deny nothing; they affirm nothing," he said. "It is unusual for my
  countrymen in the exultation of arrest to make confessions. But I am placing
  a spy in the same cell, and to-morrow we may learn something. All that we
  know at present is that they are Frenchmen, although they are visitors from
  Brussels, that they have been in this city for a month, and are engaged in no
  known business."</p>

  <p>The next morning brought T.B. no further information. The men had remained
  dumb in the presence of the spy.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that unless we get further evidence, we must release them,"
  said the officer who brought the information. "I am with you in believing
  that these two men are, or have been, agents of Silinski; but we need a
  stronger case."</p>

  <p>That stronger case did not materialize, and that same night T.B. was
  informed that the men had been released.</p>

  <p>They were carefully watched, but that same night they left by the mail
  train for Liege.</p>

  <p>So much the detective officer related to T.B. over coffee and a cigarette
  at the Cafe de la Paix.</p>

  <p>"It is very curious," said the French detective thoughtfully; it was La
  Croix of Lefeu's staff; "that you should have heard them, or one of them,
  speak of Silinski and a ship. You are sure you were not mistaken?"</p>

  <p>T.B. shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I do not think you were," said La Croix. "I questioned them and they
  denied that they knew any such person, or that they had ever mentioned his
  name. That in itself is suspicious."</p>

  <p>"You found nothing in their lodgings'?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;except the compass points."</p>

  <p>He felt in his breast pocket, took out a notebook, opened it, and
  extracted a folded sheet of paper. This he smoothed on the marble-topped
  table at which they sat. There was no word of writing on it, only a simple
  diagram. It was a cross with tiny circles at the end of each arm, and a
  larger circle in the centre.</p>

  <p>T.B.'s frown spoke eloquently his disappointment.</p>

  <p>"This," bantered La Croix, "gives you no clue to this mysterious 'Lolo' of
  yours, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>T.B. shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Does it you!" he asked, and the Frenchman laughed.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "to me it is only a curious little cross with no
  significance."</p>

  <p>T.B. smoothed the paper again, and pursed his lips in thought.</p>

  <p>"Can I have this?" he demanded after a little while.</p>

  <p>"You may have a photograph of it," said the cautious La Croix. "These
  documents, even the least of them, have some value, and are part of the
  dossier; until we know enough to be able to distinguish between those that
  count and those that have no bearing whatever on the case, we cannot destroy
  any of them, or part with them. As it happens, I have anticipated your
  wishes, for a photograph has already been taken and will be in your
  possession to-day."</p>

  <p>It was the 9th of March when T.B., with the meagre evidence he had been
  able to secure, together with the unpromising photograph of the meaningless
  cross, drove down the Gare du Nord on his way back to town. The train was on
  the point of drawing out when a man came racing along the platform. T.B. 's
  carriage had been reserved, so that the man had no difficulty in discovering
  it. He jumped up on the footboard, and thrust a bulky blue package into T.B.
  's hand.</p>

  <p>"I am from the Chief of the Police," he said breathlessly; "this telegram
  is for you, and has just arrived."</p>

  <p>T.B. thanked him, and the train began to move.</p>

  <p>Leaning back amidst the cushions, he unfolded the blue sheets, and
  read.</p>

  <p>The telegram was from Scotland Yard, and began:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Officer commanding Gibraltar reports that his wireless station had been
  intercepting messages in code which bear some resemblance to those of N". H.
  C. Full messages have been forwarded here for decoding. Some of them are
  unintelligible, but one portion of a message we have been able to make read:
  '... Accept your assurance and explanation; we have will splendid field for
  enterprise; I will join you at Lolo with shipload of provisions and collier
  on June 1st. In meantime, if you do as I suggest we can make terms with
  Governments and, moreover, find employment agents who are at present
  discontented...' Message beyond this undecipherable with exception of words
  'destruction,' 'easily obtainable,' and 'insure.' This message obviously
  between Silinski and <i>Maria Braganza</i>"&mdash;Stop. 'Commander Fleet,
  Gibraltar, has sent H.M.S. <i>Duncan</i>, <i>Essex</i>, <i>Kent</i>, with six
  destroyers into Atlantic pick up <i>Maria Braganza</i>. Return
  immediately.&mdash;Commissioned&mdash;"</p>

  <p>T.B. read the message again, folded it carefully, and placed it in his
  breast pocket. There was one word in Silinski's message that revealed in a
  flash the nature of the new terror with which the Nine Men of Cadiz
  threatened the world.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap32"
     name="chap32">XXXII. &mdash; A MATTER OF INSURANCE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">YOU pass up a broad stone staircase at one end of the Royal
  Exchange, and come to a landing where, confronting you, are two big swing
  doors that are constantly opening and closing as bareheaded clerks and
  top-hatted brokers go swiftly in and out.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the doors is a small counter where a man in uniform
  checks, with keen glance, each passer-by. Beyond the counter are two rooms,
  one leading to the other, shaped like the letter "L," and in the longer of
  the two sit in innumerable pews, quiet men with fat notebooks. From desk to
  desk flutter the brokers bargaining their risks, and there is a quiet but
  eager buzz of voices through which at intervals booms the stentorian tones of
  the porter calling by name the members whose presence is required
  outside.</p>

  <p>A stout man made a slow progress down one of the aisles, calling at the
  little pews en route, making notes in a silver-mounted book he held in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>He stopped before the pew of one of the biggest underwriters. "<i>Raglan
  Castle</i>?" he said laconically, and the underwriter looked up over his
  spectacles, then down at the slip of paper the man put before him.</p>

  <p>"One per cent?" he asked, in some surprise, and the other nodded.</p>

  <p>"How much?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The underwriter tapped the slip of paper before him.</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand pounds at 5s. per centum," he said. "I can do that." He
  initialled the slip and the man passed on.</p>

  <p>He went the round of the room, stopped to exchange a joke with an
  acquaintance, then descended the stone stairs.</p>

  <p>Back to his stuffy little office went the broker with little thought that
  he had been engaged in any unusual variety of business. In his private room
  he found his client; a thick-set man with a straggling beard, who rose
  politely as the broker entered, and removed the cigar he had been
  smoking.</p>

  <p>"You have finish," he said with a slightly foreign accent, and the broker
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes!"&mdash;a little pompously, after the manner of all Lloyds
  brokers&mdash;"no difficulty about the Raglan, you know. Mail ship, new
  steamer, no risks practically on the Cape route; rather a bad business for
  you; you'll lose your premium."</p>

  <p>He shook his head with a show of melancholy, and took a pinch of
  snuff.</p>

  <p>"I have a dream," said the foreigner hastily, "ver' bad dream. I have
  belief in dreams."</p>

  <p>"I daresay," said the broker indulgently. "A sister of mine used to have
  'em, or said she had; dreamt a tiger bit her, and sure enough next day she
  lost her brooch."</p>

  <p>He sat at his desk, signed a receipt, counted some notes, and locked them
  in his drawer.</p>

  <p>"You won't get your policies for a day or so," he said; "you're
  staying&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"At the Hotel Belgique," said the client, and, pocketing his receipts, he
  rose.</p>

  <p>"Good-day," said the broker, and opened the door.</p>

  <p>With a slight bow his client departed, and reached the street.</p>

  <p>There was a taxicab drawn up before the door, and two or three gentlemen
  standing on the pavement before the office. "Cab, sir?" said the driver, but
  the foreigner shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I think you had better," said a voice in French, and a strong hand
  grasped his arm.</p>

  <p>Before he realized what had happened, the Frenchman was hustled into the
  cab, two men jumped in with him, the door banged, and the car whirled
  westward.</p>

  <p>It was a car which had extraordinary privileges, for at a nod from the man
  who sat by the side of the driver, the City police held up the traffic to
  allow it to pass. It flew down Queen Victoria Street at a much greater speed
  than is permissible within the City boundaries, and the gloved hands of the
  policemen on duty at the end of Blackfriars Bridge made a clear way for
  it.</p>

  <p>It turned into Scotland Yard, remained a few minutes, then returned along
  the Embankment, up Northumberland Avenue, and through a side thoroughfare, to
  Bow Street.</p>

  <p>Thereafter, the Frenchman's experience was bewildering. He was searched,
  hurried through a passage to a small court where a benevolent-looking
  gentleman sat behind a table, on a raised dais.</p>

  <p>The prisoner was placed in a steel pen, and a quietly-dressed man rose
  from the solicitors' table, and made a brief statement.</p>

  <p>"We shall charge this man with being a suspected person, your worship," he
  said, "and ask for a remand."</p>

  <p>Then another man went into the witness-box.</p>

  <p>"My name is Detective-Sergeant Kiegnell, of 'A' Division," he said; "and
  from information received, I went to 976, Throgmorton Street, where I saw the
  prisoner. I told him I was a police officer, and should take him into
  custody."</p>

  <p>That was all.</p>

  <p>The magistrate scribbled something on a paper before him, and said
  briefly, "Remanded."</p>

  <p>Before the prisoner could say a word, or utter anything more than a
  "Sacre!" he was beckoned from the dock and disappeared from court.</p>

  <p>So unimportant was this case that none of the reporters in court troubled
  to record more than the fact that "a well-dressed man of foreign appearance
  was charged with loitering with intent."</p>

  <p>Certainly nobody associated his arrest with the announcement that the
  <i>Raglan Castle</i> had left Cape Town, homeward bound.</p>

  <p>It was an interesting voyage for the passengers of the <i>Raglan
  Castle</i>, which, by the way, carried specie to the amount of &pound;600,000. She
  left Cape Town soon after dusk. The next morning, to the surprise of her
  Captain, he fell in with a little British fleet&mdash;the <i>Doris</i>, the
  <i>Philomel</i>, and the <i>St. George</i>, flying a Commodore's flag.</p>

  <p>Greatest surprise of all came to the Captain of the <i>Raglan Castle</i>
  when he received the following signal:</p>

  <p>"Slow down to thirteen knots, and do not part company."</p>

  <p>To the Captain's "I am carrying the mails," came the laconic message, "I
  know."</p>

  <p>For ten days the four ships kept together, then came the sensation of the
  voyage. At dawn of the tenth day, a big steamer came into view over the
  horizon. She was in the direct path of the flotilla and to all appearance she
  was stationary. Those who were on deck at that early hour, heard shrill bugle
  sounds from the escorting warships, then suddenly the engine of the
  <i>Raglan</i> stopped, and a crowd of curious passengers came running up from
  below. The <i>Raglan Castle</i> had obeyed a peremptory order given by the
  St. George, and was hove-to.</p>

  <p>The St. George and Doris went on; then from the funnels of the stationary
  steamer came clouds of smoke, and through their telescope the passengers saw
  her turn slowly and move.</p>

  <p>Slowly, slowly, she got under way, then&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The forward 9.2 gun of the St. George emitted a thin straight streak of
  flame, and there was a strange whining noise in the air.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>The Doris came into action at the same time as the St. George fired her
  second gun. Both shots fell short, and the spray of the ricochets leapt up
  into the air.</p>

  <p>The fugitive steamer was now moving at full speed; there was a great fan-
  shaped patch of white water at her stern.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>All this time the two British warships were going ahead firing as they
  went. Then from the stern of the strange steamer floated a whiff of white
  smoke, and, in a second, the eerie whine of a shell came to the passengers
  who crowded the deck of the <i>Raglan Castle</i>. The shell missed the firing
  warships; indeed, it did not seem to be aimed in their direction, but it fell
  uncomfortably close to the mail boat. Another shell fell wide of the steamer
  but in a line with her. The manoeuvre of the flying vessel was now apparent.
  She carried heavier metal than the second-class cruisers of the British
  fleet, but her object was to disable the mail boat.</p>

  <p>The Captain of the <i>Raglan</i> did not wait for orders; he rung his
  engines full speed ahead, and swung his helm hard aport. He was going to
  steam back out of range.</p>

  <p>But no further shot came from the <i>Maria Braganza</i>.</p>

  <p>Smaller and smaller she grew until a pall of smoke on the horizon showed
  where she lay.</p>

  <p>Obeying a signal from the distant warship, the <i>Raglan</i> came round
  again, and in half an hour had come abreast of the two warships, the faithful
  Philomel in attendance.</p>

  <p>There was a swift exchange of signals between the warships, and their
  semaphore arms whirled furiously.</p>

  <p>Then the Commodore's ship signalled.</p>

  <p>"Hope you are not alarmed; you will not be troubled again; go ahead."</p>

  <p>On the twelfth day there was another shock for the excited passengers of
  the <i>Raglan Castle</i>, for, nearing Cape Verde Islands, they came upon not
  one warship but six&mdash;six big black hulls lying at regular intervals
  along the horizon. But there was no cause for alarm. They were the six
  Dreadnought cruisers that had been sent down from Gibraltar to take up the
  burden of the Cape Fleet.</p>

  <p>It was all a mystery to the bewildered passengers, whatever it might be to
  the officers of the <i>Raglan</i>, who had received a long "lamp" message in
  the middle of the night.</p>

  <p>There was a two hours' delay whilst the Captain of the <i>St. George</i>
  went on board the Indefatigable to report.</p>

  <p>This was the end of the adventures that awaited the <i>Raglan</i>. She was
  escorted to the Needles by the six warships, and came into Southampton, her
  passengers a-flutter with that excitement peculiar to men who have come
  through a great danger, and are exhilarated to find themselves alive.</p>

  <p>The arrival of the <i>Raglan</i> was opportune; it gave confirmation to
  the rumours which had been in circulation, and synchronized with the issue of
  the manifesto of the Nine Men&mdash;a manifesto unique in history.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap33"
     name="chap33">XXXIII. &mdash; THE "MAD WARSHIP"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE manifesto had arrived simultaneously at every newspaper
  office in London, Paris, and Berlin.</p>

  <p class="quote">"It was printed," says the official record of the incident,
  with its cold precision and its passion for detail, "on paper of a texture
  and quality which is generally in use in small Continental newspaper offices.
  From certain peculiarities of the printed characters, it was seen that the
  type from which it was printed must have been cast in Spain. Wherever the
  letter W occurred it was replaced by VV... The manifesto was neatly folded
  and enclosed in an envelope of octavo size, and the actual sheet-size was
  what is known in the printing trade as double-crown. The postage stamps were
  Spanish, the place of posting, as revealed by the office post-marks, were in
  some cases Malaga, and in some, Algeciras. The fact that, whether posted at
  one place or the other the date of the posting was identical, supports the
  view that at least two persons had been concerned in the dispatch."</p>

  <p>The manifesto itself ran:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">"To the Civilized Nation (sic).</p>

  <p class="quote">"Whereas, we, the company known as the Nine Men of Cadiz,
  have been placed by universal decree outside the law, and whereas it is
  against our desires that such decrees of outlawry should exist against us,
  both from the point of view of our own personal comfort and safety, and from
  the point of view of the free exchange of commercial (sic) relationships.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Now, therefore, we decree&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">"That unless an immediate free pardon be granted to each and
  every man on board the <i>Maria Braganza</i> and liberty be given to him to
  go his way peaceably without arrest or fear of molestations (sic), the owners
  and crew of the <i>Maria Braganza</i> will declare war upon the commerce of
  the world. It will loot and destroy such shipping as may with advantage be so
  looted and destroyed, and in the end will fight to the last against its
  aggressor.</p>

  <p class="quote">"(Signed) By order of the Nine,</p>

  <p class="quote">"Silinski."</p>

  <p>It is no exaggeration to say that the publication of this manifesto caused
  a panic, not only in shipping circles, but throughout the civilized world.
  The sea held a hidden danger, neither life nor property were secure. There
  came to stay-at-home people a realization of the dependence of these islands
  upon its oversea trade. That insurance rates should rise was only a natural
  and immaterial result of the publication of the threat. But a more serious
  aspect was the instant effect the manifesto had upon the grain market. Bread
  rose in two days from 4d. to 6d., and, in some parts of the country 7d., a
  loaf.</p>

  <p>That the fears of the community were justified was proved by the story of
  the <i>Raglan Castle</i>, and was proved beyond doubt two days after the
  publishing of the Nine Men's proclamation by what happened to the <i>Zeider
  Prince</i>, a Welsh collier bound from Cardiff to Valparaiso. The port
  authorities at St. Vincent (Teneriffe) reported that heavy cannonading had
  been heard by the coastguards on the western shore of the island. The firing
  lasted three minutes and then ceased. Fortunately, there was in the harbour
  of St. Vincent at the time, the British destroyer <i>Alert</i>, which, on
  receipt of the news, went out at full speed to investigate. The <i>Alert</i>
  came up to the scene of the crime after the <i>Zeider Prince</i> had been
  sunk (a lifebuoy and a waterlogged boat were taken on board the destroyer to
  establish the identity of the doomed ship).</p>

  <p>When the <i>Alert</i> came up, the <i>Maria Braganza</i> was hull down,
  and steaming due west, and the Captain of the destroyer very pluckily gave
  chase. With the <i>Alert</i>'s enormous speed she overhauled the battleship
  hand over hand, but long before she could get within striking distance, the
  <i>Maria Braganza</i> opened fire on her, and it was only by a miracle that
  the <i>Alert</i> escaped destruction. The destroyer had neither the coal nor
  the stores necessary for a long chase, and returned to TenerifTe.</p>

  <p>The theory in regard to the <i>Zeider Prince</i> is that she was first
  brought alongside the battleship, her cargo taken aboard, and then the little
  tramp was sunk. No member of her crew was found, dead or alive, and the
  assumption at the time was that the crew were prisoners on board the
  warship&mdash;an assumption which afterwards proved to be accurate.</p>

  <p>Less fortunate were the men who manned the German steamer Aosan Werthan,
  bound from Hamburg to the ivory coast with a general cargo. The dead body of
  a sailor washed up near Cape Blanca was the first intimation of the
  tragedy.</p>

  <p>It was the only intimation, for from that day to this no word has ever
  reached the world of its fate.</p>

  <p>There was consternation enough at these events, but within a fortnight
  came the story of the North Atlantic outrage.</p>

  <p>The <i>Caratana</i>, the fastest mail-ship afloat, as well as being nearly
  the largest, was sixty hours, out of New York with 350 passengers on board,
  when she came up with a strange warship flying a red flag. The warship
  hoisted an unintelligible signal, which the Captain of the <i>Caratana</i>
  did not understand. It was followed by one of which there could be no
  mistaking the meaning.</p>

  <p>"Stop, or I will sink you."</p>

  <p>The Captain of the Atlantic liner knew all that was known about the
  <i>Maria Braganza</i>, and at once realized his danger. If he did not realize
  it, there came a shell from the warship, which passed astern. Fortunately,
  there was a mist on the water which grew in density every minute&mdash;a real
  "bank" fog, not usually met with so far east.</p>

  <p>The Captain of the <i>Caratana</i> decided upon the course of action he
  would take. Very quickly he signalled "I surrender," and rang his engines to
  "stop." The men on the warship seemed satisfied with his action, and no
  further demonstration was made against the liner. Such was the "way" on the
  big ship, that although her propellers had ceased to revolve, she continued
  her course, nearer and nearer she grew to a thick patch of fog that lay ahead
  of her. The <i>Maria Braganza</i> may have suspected the manoeuvre, for she
  signalled, "Go astern."</p>

  <p>For answer, the Captain of the <i>Caratana</i> put port and starboard
  engine full ahead, and, whilst men were running to their stations on the
  warship, the <i>Caratana</i> slipped into the fog belt.</p>

  <p>In an instant the <i>Maria Braganza</i> was blotted from view.</p>

  <p>The liner Captain put his helm over to starboard, and it was well that he
  did so, for with a reverberating crash, the warship opened fire in the
  direction he had disappeared. Shell after shell came flying through the thick
  mist, and the thud of their impact as they struck the water came to the ears
  of the affrighted passengers.</p>

  <p>The sound of spasmodic firing grew fainter and fainter every minute as the
  great steamer went threshing through the swirling fog, until it ceased
  altogether.</p>

  <p>Although no harm had befallen the liner, the news of the attack produced a
  profound sensation. Its effect was to paralyse the business of ocean travel.
  "The Mad Warship" terrorized the seas.</p>

  <p>Immediately intelligence of the outrage was flashed by wireless telegraphy
  to America, the American Fleet, which had been cruising up the Atlantic
  coast, steamed out to intercept the <i>Maria Braganza</i>; and,
  simultaneously, the Home Fleet, which was lying in Queenstown Harbour, sailed
  to meet them. The American Fleet consisted of the battleships New Jersey,
  Connecticut, Idaho, and Michigan; the armoured cruisers St. Louis and
  Maryland; and the protected cruisers Salem, Chattanooga, Olympia, and Tacoma.
  The cruisers went on, and two and a half days later came up with the Warrior,
  Achilles, Invincible and Indomitable, of the British Fleet.</p>

  <p>But no sign had they seen of the <i>Maria Braganza</i>, which must have
  headed due south.</p>

  <p>It was on the day the report of their non-success reached England that
  T.B. Smith located Silinski.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">There languished in a prosaic prison cell at Brixton gaol a
  Monsieur Torquet, who was admittedly a victim of a police persecution. That
  much I think T.B. himself was prepared to admit. He had come before a police
  magistrate; had been remanded and again remanded; he had communicated first
  with the Belgian Ambassador, who found it convenient to disown him as a
  Belgian; he had applied to the French Consul, and that gentleman had replied
  to the communication with a promptitude and a finality which suggest that the
  whole of the circumstances of the case had been in the possession of the
  Consulate, and the application anticipated.</p>

  <p>This, indeed, was the fact.</p>

  <p>M. Torquet was suspected not of a crime against any particular section of
  society, but indeed of being accessory to a crime against humanity; and T.B.
  was prepared to run a tilt at the very Habeas Corpus Act rather than release
  his grip upon the stranger with the straggling beard, whom he had recognized
  as being the mumbling gentleman of the Cafe de la Paix, who knew of Silinski
  and of "ships"; and, knowing so much about the latter, had heavily insured
  the <i>Raglan Castle</i> before she started out on her adventurous
  voyage.</p>

  <p>So, through the days of the terror, M. Torquet was a prisoner in Brixton,
  watched day and night, taking his exercise aloof and at separate hours from
  the other prisoners; and, moreover, denied the satisfaction of knowing that
  public interest was excited in his fate.</p>

  <p>For nobody knew of M. Torquet. The most astute reporters who had seen the
  thick-set figure stumble up the steps of the dock in the Extradition Court
  had failed to connect him with the subject that was filling every mind, and,
  incidentally, every available column in the newspapers. It is a fact that all
  through the period of incarceration no man had attempted by threat, entreaty,
  or promise, to extract from him the secret he undoubtedly held.</p>

  <p>The police had waited for a voluntary statement; they applied to him the
  supreme torture of indifference.</p>

  <p>Day by day men had brought him food, warders who were apparently dumb had
  led him forth to the paved exercise yard, and had led him back again. He had
  been kept supplied with books and writing materials, the food that came to
  him was well cooked, every consideration was shown to him; but nobody
  displayed any desire to share his confidence, or to be interested in any way
  in birr) , save as a rare animal to be fed and exercised.</p>

  <p>He had been remanded and remanded. Finally, he had been committed for
  trial.</p>

  <p>It does not seem possible that evidence could be produced in open
  court&mdash;evidence sufficient to constitute a prima facie case for
  trial&mdash;without the event being reported, yet this was what happened.</p>

  <p>Into the Extradition Court at Bow Street, generally supposed to be closed
  for the day, the man was hurried. A magistrate took his seat on the bench,
  evidence was given&mdash;there were two police witnesses&mdash;the committal
  was signed, and before the faintest rumour reached the general court that the
  other court was open, before a reporter could gather up his block and pad and
  hurry out, the sitting was completed, and no man was wiser.</p>

  <p>This M. Torquet, brooding in the loneliness of his cell at Brixton, had
  very nearly reached the limits of his patience; the silence and the
  indifference had crushed what little there was in him.</p>

  <p>For two months he had lain without trial, in a cell which had a table on
  which were pen, paper, and ink. He had not in all that time touched the one
  or the other, but on the day that the Atlantic liner came across the <i>Maria
  Braganza</i> he sat at the table and wrote a brief note to the governor of
  the prison. Within an hour T.B. Smith was ushered into the cell and remained
  with the man for some time. Then he came out and sent for a shorthand clerk,
  and together they returned.</p>

  <p>For four hours the three men worked, one questioning and translating, one
  answering, at first sullenly and with periodic outbursts of temper, and later
  eagerly, volubly&mdash;and all this time the clerk wrote and wrote, until one
  notebook was exhausted and he sent out for another.</p>

  <p>It was late in the evening when he said:</p>

  <p>"And that, monsieur, is all."</p>

  <p>"All?" T.B.'s eyebrows rose. "All? But you have not explained the
  whereabouts of Lolo?"</p>

  <p>The prisoner was frankly puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Lolo?" he repeated. "M'sieur, I do not understand."</p>

  <p>It was T.B.'s turn to be astonished.</p>

  <p>"But the rendezvous&mdash;there was to be some rendezvous where the ship
  would come to pick up any member of the Nine who might become detached."</p>

  <p>The man shook his head, and at that moment an idea occurred to T.B. He
  drew from his pocket a copy of the little "cross with the nobs," as it had
  been named at Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"Do you know this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man looked at it, and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Silinski drew that for me on the last occasion I met him in
  Paris."</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>Again the prisoner shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," he said simply. "Silinski was telling me something of his
  plans. He drew the cross and was beginning to explain its meaning and then
  for some reason he stopped, crumpled up the paper, and threw it into the
  fireplace. At the time I attached some importance to it, and after he had
  gone I rescued it, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't understand it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't," said the man, and T.B. knew that he spoke the truth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap34"
     name="chap34">XXXIV. &mdash; IN TANGIER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MANY little houses are on the Marshan, the plateau that
  commands Tangier. They are villas in which Moorish, Spanish, and English
  styles of architecture, struggling for supremacy, have compromised in a
  conglomerate type. In one of these houses lived Gregory Silinski and his
  sister. There is every excuse for a rich Madrid merchant taking up his
  residence in this pleasant land, more especially in the spring, most
  especially when the rich Madrid merchant is an invalid. This was Silinski's
  role for the moment.</p>

  <p>Like most people of the Polish race, he had an aptitude for languages, and
  his Arabic was well-night faultless.</p>

  <p>The man had a passion for organization, and in an incredibly short space
  of time he had created a secret service of his own.</p>

  <p>In Tangier, the very centre of international intrigue, where the Embassies
  beamed at one another over the dinner table, and plotted their lie was, he
  discovered that it was almost as cheap to go in person, as it would be to
  cable&mdash;and mnch safer. Then, he thought, Catherine would have money with
  her, or the means of getting it.</p>

  <p>When they had paid their fares back to England&mdash;Silinski affected a
  little beard in those troublous days&mdash;they exhausted their stock of
  ready money.</p>

  <p>It must have been whilst Silinski was in Paris that the ruling spirit of
  the <i>Maria Braganza</i> discovered that Silinski was indispensable, and
  that strange reconciliation occurred. Through what agency Baggin and he came
  into touch is not known. It is generally supposed that the warship ventured
  close to the French or Spanish coast and sent a message of good-will
  flickering through space, and that some receiving station, undiscovered and
  undemolished&mdash;there must have been a score of such
  stations-&mdash;received it, and transmitted it to Silinski. At any rate, it
  would appear that Silinski became suddenly affluent, and that he was&mdash;in
  Tangier&mdash;reputed wealthy.</p>

  <p>For this accession to comfort I find an explanation, more simple than that
  offered by the majority of biographers of the "Nine Men of Cadiz." There can
  be little doubt, that, by one of those extraordinary coincidences which no
  writer of fiction could dare fabricate, Silinski had met the second Brazilian
  sailor&mdash;that Alverez who was "not of great mentality and preferred
  Paris," and had succeeded in securing no small amount of the
  ex-quartermaster's money.</p>

  <p>But to return to Catherine Silinski.</p>

  <p>I reconstruct the scene when Catherine delivered her
  ultimatum&mdash;Catherine grown weary of waiting, grown tired with forced
  seclusion; Catherine divorced of an admiring audience, and being moreover a
  recipient of daily doles, for as I have explained Silinski was a careful man
  where money was concerned.</p>

  <p>They sat on either side of a table in the spacious living-room of their
  villa. The night was unusually warm, and the French windows were open, but
  the jalousies were closed.</p>

  <p>The room in which they sat was well furnished for Silinski was a man of
  some taste.</p>

  <p>He himself was engaged in making notes in a large exercise book, and
  Catherine was pretending to read. From time to time she glanced across the
  table at him, but he did not look up. Once, her glance rested longer than
  usual, and he might have seen that look of calm dispassionate speculation
  which was the peculiar possession of the Silinski family&mdash;a cold
  appraisement.</p>

  <p>"When she spoke it was patiently and quietly.</p>

  <p>"Gregory," she said suddenly, "how does this end?"</p>

  <p>"This!" He looked up enquiringly.</p>

  <p>"This," she repeated. "This hiding and seeking; these mysteries&mdash;and
  poverty?"</p>

  <p>He smiled gently, and shook his head as one reluctant to reprove, but
  compelled by circumstances to administer a chiding.</p>

  <p>"Poverty, as the great Cervantes once said&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"I would rather not discuss Cervantes," she interrupted coolly. "I do not
  know who Cervantes was, though there was a little man in Madrid who showed me
  a great deal of attention, who had that name. Gregory, what is the end of
  this, for me, and you?"</p>

  <p>He stroked his moustache with caressing white fingers.</p>

  <p>"Wealth," he said, after a while, "enormous wealth; our share of the
  profits we secured for our friends of Cadiz. It will not be difficult to
  reach the <i>Maria Braganza</i>. It will be less difficult to leave her when
  our share has been apportioned. More than our share," he added, thoughtfully,
  "for there is a man on that ship with whom I have some score to settle."</p>

  <p>She made no answer, but absently fingered the paper of her book.</p>

  <p>"You are once more in touch with them?" she asked, and Silinski
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. He loved a mystery, yet there was no mystery in the matter. In
  the days before the Nine Men had been scattered, Silinski had foreseen the
  necessity for establishing wireless stations that would be, because of their
  very openness, free from suspicion. He had no difficulty in persuading the
  young Sultan, Abdul Asziz, to grant a concession empowering the erection of
  experimental wireless stations, for Abdul Asziz dearly loved a toy, greatly
  desired, too, amongst Europeans the reputation of being a progressive
  monarch. So that the high masts of the Anglo-Sevilla Wireless Company stood
  by the lighthouse, at Cape Spartel, and had so stood for two years. When the
  hasty inspection of existing stations had been made by the powers, the Cape
  Spartel installation had not been suspected, and Silinski's agents had been
  permitted to continue their experiments. It was a simple explanation; it
  explained in fact Silinski's presence in Tangier, but he did not feel
  disposed to offer it.</p>

  <p>So his cryptic smile was all the answer that Catherine received.</p>

  <p>"Is there not a reward for the arrest of the Nine Men?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"There is, my child," he replied.</p>

  <p>"And a pardon?"</p>

  <p>"And a pardon."</p>

  <p>She was silent and sat with her eyes fixed on the table.</p>

  <p>"A reward of ten thousand pounds?" she repeated. "How much is that?"</p>

  <p>"A little more than a quarter of a million francs. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her keenly as he spoke, searching her every feature as though
  he would surprise a secret.</p>

  <p>"Why do you not take the reward?" she said calmly, and he stifled a little
  sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Because, my dear Catherine, I am what these English call a party to the
  crime&mdash;and in the amiable proclamation which the English Government
  issued a short time since, I was specifically named."</p>

  <p>She was silent for such a long time, that he had resumed his work.
  Then&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What will they do to you, if they capture you?" she asked, and he laid
  down his pen again, with an exaggerated air of patience.</p>

  <p>"They will hang me by the neck until I am dead," he said, and Catherine
  did not shudder, as a thousand other women would have done, but nodded.</p>

  <p>"And me?"</p>

  <p>"You, my dear Catherine?" Silinski looked at her again, with swift
  suspicion. "You? I think because of your youth and beauty, but more because
  you are not as deeply involved as the rest of us, you might escape with a few
  years' imprisonment&mdash;let us say seven."</p>

  <p>"I see."</p>

  <p>She took up her book again, and idly turned the leaves. "Seven years is a
  long time," she commented reflectively.</p>

  <p>"Eternity is longer," said Silinski.</p>

  <p>Catherine did not answer. She was apparently interested in her book, and
  Silinski, after waiting for her to speak, took up his pen again.</p>

  <p>He worked steadily for two hours, during which time Catherine made no
  further attempts to speak.</p>

  <p>He finished his work, read it over carefully, blotted the book, and
  rose.</p>

  <p>He pushed open the jalousies and stepped into the little garden. From the
  villa, a hill sloped downward to the town. It was a calm moonlight night, and
  the crude white of Tangier was softened in the silver beams. There were many
  twinkling lights in the town, and the bay was laced with light.</p>

  <p>He walked through the garden, and moved toward the sea.</p>

  <p>From where he stood he could not distinguish the little ship that lay
  under steam round the shoulder of the cliff. A tiny Spanish steamer that
  wandered from port to port, from Casa Blanca to Ceutra, from Tangier to
  Mogador, carrying passengers in the tourist season, and cargo all the year
  round. Silinski had a "friend" in command of the <i>Doro</i>. The fact that
  he was a friend of Silinski's is sufficient to indicate that he was none of
  Nature's noblemen, and I say this in no uncharity. It was rumoured in
  Gibraltar that the <i>Doro</i> had been engaged in not a few gun-running
  adventures on the Moorish coast, and on one occasion there had been a Court
  of Inquiry following upon a seizure, but nothing had come of that.</p>

  <p>Silinski walked back to the villa, and stood for a time on the white road
  that led past the house, his head on one side, absorbing the beauty of the
  scene&mdash;for there was poetry in the man.</p>

  <p>Then he walked slowly to the house.</p>

  <p>Catherine was sitting as he had left her, the book&mdash;it was one of
  Guadilva's romances, and bore a gandy picture on its cover&mdash;before her.
  She too had been thinking, for Silinski noted that the page was open at the
  identical illustration he had seen when he went out.</p>

  <p>He took up his work where he left off, opened his little book, unscrewed
  his stylographic pen, and began to work.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he stopped and, looking up, caught his sister's eyes fixed upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he said, picking up the conversation where they had dropped
  it, "you worry too much about things that do not concern you."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I think seven years' imprisonment concerns me very much," she said. "I
  should be an old woman at the end of that time."</p>

  <p>"It will never come to that," said Silinski sharply&mdash;for him. "You
  seem to think we shall fail. Do you not realize that we are on the verge of
  our greatest success?"</p>

  <p>She smiled, a little scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Men are always on the verge of success who end their lives in failure,"
  she said. "There is no verge to real success; it opens under you and you fall
  into it."</p>

  <p>"You are too clever," said Silinski. "You have read that somewhere. After
  all," he went on, "you have less to fear than most of us; and you forget that
  you are only a very small piece in the game."</p>

  <p>Then he made a mistake, a bad mistake for a man of his finesse.</p>

  <p>"We will find you a husband, Catherine," he said, with humour. "It shall
  be Baggin or Meyers&mdash;somebody immensely rich, and you shall live on a
  beautiful island, and have thousands of slaves."</p>

  <p>All the time she was looking at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>She nodded slightly when he finished, and went on reading.</p>

  <p>Silinski retired that night just before there came floating up from the
  town below the voice of the muezzin calling the faithful to prayer. He slept
  on the ground floor, and he was dozing when there was a tapping on his window
  pane.</p>

  <p>He got up and opened the window, for he recognized an agent from the
  wireless station.</p>

  <p>"Se&ntilde;or," whispered the mam "have you heard the news?"</p>

  <p>"No; what is it?"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Zillier has escaped from Devil's Island&mdash;the news came
  across from Gibraltar tonight."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?" whispered Silinski, eagerly.</p>

  <p>For answer the man produced a slip of paper.</p>

  <p>Silinski took it, closed the shutters, and turned on the electric
  light.</p>

  <p>The paper, crumpled and soiled, was a copy of the garrison orders of
  Gibraltar, and under the routine duties appeared the "News of the Day."</p>

  <p>Yes, there it was.</p>

  <p>"The man Zillier, convicted in connection with the Nine Men of Cadiz
  conspiracy, has escaped from Devil's Island."</p>

  <p>That was all.</p>

  <p>Silinski read it again, then he extinguished the lights, and reopened the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Take this," he said, handing the paper to the man. "All night call the
  Nine, and if you get an answer convey the news to them. They must know, for
  Zillier will endeavour to reach the rendezvous on June the first."</p>

  <p>After the man had gone, he returned to bed, and lay staring into the
  darkness. If Zillier joined the <i>Maria Braganza</i>, he must join it also;
  that much he decided. And Catherine&mdash;? He frowned. Catherine was getting
  a little difficult to manage.</p>

  <p>Before he fell asleep he decided to cut himself adrift from her. Curiously
  enough some such resolution had already been made by Catherine.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Three days later Silinski returned from a walk in the best
  of humours. He had been out to the station near Cape Spartel. After two days
  the operators had got into communication with the <i>Maria Braganza</i>, and
  the news was satisfactory.</p>

  <p>He burst in upon Catherine as she was settling herself down for a
  siesta.</p>

  <p>"Catherine, my child," he said, with a gesture that was peculiarly his,
  "soon you are to lose your unsympathetic brother, my little one; yet be
  assured that his thoughts will ever be with you, his eyes tearful&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And what does all this mean?" she added, very wakeful indeed now.</p>

  <p>He waved his hands airily.</p>

  <p>"A little separation," he said. "I must go to meet the Nine Men; after a
  while I shall, of course, return&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what of me?" she said. "Do I stay in this town of dogs and smells? Do
  I bury myself in Tangier and grow old?"</p>

  <p>"I will leave you money," he said. "I have made certain arrangements; you
  will have ten thousand pesetas."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand pesetas!" she scoffed; "to last me for eternity J"</p>

  <p>"Madame," he said gravely&mdash;Silinski was unusually impressive when he
  was grave&mdash;"I shall return."</p>

  <p>She made a little grimace, was about to speak, then shut her mouth tightly
  as though to cheek something that were better not said.</p>

  <p>"When do you purpose leaving!" she asked.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow&mdash;the next day&mdash;who knows!" he answered vaguely.
  "There are many things to do. The English Government have become interested
  in the wireless station. They have been putting on foot inquiries, which are
  not likely to allay any suspicion we have aroused. It would be better if some
  of our instruments were dismantled and taken away; they will be difficult to
  replace."</p>

  <p>He rattled on, giving her, amongst other things, such purely domestic
  instructions as to the disposal of such of his linen as was still with their
  Moorish laundry.</p>

  <p>To all this she listened patiently, even interposed a few suggestions of
  her own.</p>

  <p>Silinski, prepared for something of a scene at his bare-face desertion,
  was relieved, and showed it. He was in an exultant mood throughout that day,
  hummed such airs as occurred to him, whistled, made little jokes, and went on
  with his packing for all the world like some everyday clerk released from the
  bondage of office work to his annual holiday.</p>

  <p>Less boisterous was Catherine. She, too, was busy in a quiet way. In the
  confusion of his packing, Silinski did not notice at first that Catherine was
  packing also. When he did he dropped the work he was at the moment engaged
  in, and came to her.</p>

  <p>"Beloved," he said seriously, "what are you doing?"</p>

  <p>"I am packing," she replied calmly.</p>

  <p>"But," he urged gently; "you do not understand. I will return&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shall not be here," she said, without raising her voice. "You did not
  expect me to stay in this place, did you?"</p>

  <p>"At least, you will wait until I have gone?" he asked, ignoring her
  question. He had only the vaguest interest in her fate thereafter. Indeed, he
  thought it likely that Catherine might remain at liberty less than a week
  following his disappearance. You may be sure that Silinski had studied the
  situation in all its aspects. He had thought at first of taking her with him
  on board the <i>Maria Braganza</i>, but he foresaw complication. Her presence
  might strengthen his position with the Nine; at the same time it might easily
  bring about his own undoing.</p>

  <p>"Have no fear," she answered his question. "I shall wait for your
  departure."</p>

  <p>"That might well be," thought Silinski, for he had timed his departure for
  that very night. The <i>Doro</i> waited for him, and the dark of the night
  would bring a boat to the shore to take him and his belongings aboard.</p>

  <p>"Where do you meet our friends?" she asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"At the rendezvous," Silinski answered instantly, "although it is a great
  secret, little one, I will tell you; it is a spot on the map nine hundred
  miles south of Bermuda, in the midst of a desolation of water; here will
  Gregory Silinski, an outlaw, join his fellow outcasts." ^</p>

  <p>He grew pensive at the melancholy picture he drew, and sighed.</p>

  <p>"Nine hundred miles south of Bermuda," she repeated absently.</p>

  <p>"To be exact," said Silinski carefully, "eight hundred and ninety-four
  miles." She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I wonder where the rendezvous really is!" she said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I have told you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have told me a lie," she interrupted him, still smiling, and Silinski
  smiled in sympathy.</p>

  <p>He made many visits to the wireless station that day. It was a hot and
  dusty walk, but he regarded neither heat nor discomfort. Late in the
  afternoon, just as darkness fell, returning to the villa, he found it
  deserted, save for the two Moorish servants of the house. Their mistress had
  gone out, so they said, into the town. They had scarcely finished answering
  the questions that Silinski put to them when Catherine walked in.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been?" he asked. He made no pretence at being polite, for
  he was perturbed in mind.</p>

  <p>"To the city," she said coolly.</p>

  <p>"Why!"</p>

  <p>"To book my passage by the <i>Petalygol</i>"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>She made no answer.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Have I not answered? As soon as you have left Tangier, I also leave."</p>

  <p>"Why did you go into Tangier!" He was insistent, and she saw she had need
  for caution.</p>

  <p>"I have told you&mdash;to book my passage to Cadiz."</p>

  <p>He laughed harshly,</p>

  <p>"Book your passage to Hades, my friend!" he said. "You went to Tangier for
  a purpose."</p>

  <p>For answer she turned upon him with a contemptuous gesture, and walked
  quickly to her room. She heard him follow with quick steps, and shut the door
  in his face; before he could grasp the handle of the door, he heard the key
  turn in the lock. He was of a mind to kick in the door, for he had an
  instinct for danger, and knew that he was in deadly peril.</p>

  <p>Instead, he knocked at the door gently.</p>

  <p>"Catherine," he said softly, "Catherine, little one; I am sorry I offended
  you."</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>"I was annoyed because you went into Tangier without telling me. It was
  indiscreet, my dear. Open the door and I will explain."</p>

  <p>He heard her footsteps on the floor of the room, and slipped from his
  hip-pocket the thin-bladed knife he had found so useful many times
  before.</p>

  <p>But she did not come to the door. He heard a drawer open, the soft "click"
  of a Browning pistol being charged, and replaced his knife with a little grin
  which meant many things.</p>

  <p>He went back to the sitting-room. It was quite dark now, but he did not
  attempt to turn on the lights.</p>

  <p>He sat down to think. His baggage he had sent away during the afternoon.
  The men would now be waiting for him with the boat, though it was early. He
  could have wished to settle matters with Catherine. How much did she know? He
  did not rate the intelligence of women very highly, but Catherine was a
  Silinski. Yet, remarkably enough, he had never before seriously considered
  the extent of Catherine's knowledge.</p>

  <p>A suspicious man sitting in the dark, rapidly reviewing such a position as
  this, is not likely to think evenly or justly, and perhaps Silinski
  overestimated Catherine's astuteness. Be that as it may, be came to a
  decision.</p>

  <p>He stepped softly into the garden, and came to a spot beneath her
  window.</p>

  <p>"Catherine," he called, and he saw her dimly, for there was no light in
  her room.</p>

  <p>She stood a little way back from the open casement, but he judged the
  distance between himself and her with tolerable precision.</p>

  <p>Like a flash, his arm rose, and the thin-bladed knife went whistling
  through the air. He heard a sharp cry; then silence. He waited a little
  while, and walked through the garden. There was a man standing in the middle
  of the white road. His hands in his overcoat pocket, the red glow of his
  cigar a point of light in the gloom. Farther away, he saw the figures of
  three horsemen.</p>

  <p>"Silinski, I suppose," drawled a voice&mdash;the voice of T.B. Smith. "Put
  up your hands or you're a dead man."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap35"
     name="chap35">XXXV. &mdash; SILINSKI LEAVES HURRIEDLY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN an instant the road was filled with men; they must have
  been crouching in the shadow of the grassy plateau, but in that same instant
  Silinski had leapt back to the cover of the garden. A revolver banged behind
  him; and, as he ran, he snatched his own revolver from his pocket, and sent
  two quick shots into the thick of the surrounding circle. There was another
  gate at the farther end of the garden; there would be men there, but he must
  risk it. He was slight and had some speed as a runner; he must depend upon
  these gifts.</p>

  <p>He opened the gate swiftly and sprang out. There were three or four men
  standing in his path. He shot at one point blank, dodged the others, and ran.
  He judged that his pursuers would not know the road as well as he. Shot after
  shot rang out behind him. He was an easy mark on the white road, and he
  turned aside and took to the grass. He was clear of the houses now, and there
  was no danger ahead, but the men who followed him were untiring.</p>

  <p>Presently, he struck the footpath across the sloping plain that led to the
  shore, and the going was easier.</p>

  <p>It was Silinski's luck that his pursuers should have missed the path. His
  every arrangement worked smoothly, for the boat was waiting, the men at their
  oars, and he sprang breathlessly into the stern.</p>

  <p>It was a circumstance, which might have struck him as strange, had he been
  in a condition for calm thought, that the horsemen who were of the party that
  surrounded him had not joined in pursuit.</p>

  <p>But there was another mystery that the night revealed. He had been on
  board the <i>Doro</i> for an hour, and the crew of the little ship was
  pushing her southward before he went to the cabin that had been made ready
  for him.</p>

  <p>His first act was to take his revolver from his pocket, preparatory to
  reloading it from the cartridges stored in one of his trunks.</p>

  <p>Two chambers of the pistol were undischarged, and, as he jerked back the
  extractor, these two shells fell on the bed. He looked at them stupidly.</p>

  <p>Both cartridges were blank!</p>

  <p>Had he heard T.B. Smith speaking as he went flying down the road, Silinski
  might have understood.</p>

  <p>"Where's the dead man!" said T.B. cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"Here, sir," said a voice.</p>

  <p>"Good." Then in Spanish he addressed a figure that stood in the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>"Were you hurt, se&ntilde;ora!"</p>

  <p>Catherine's little laugh of contempt came out to him.</p>

  <p>"I know Gregory," she said quietly; "there is not a trick of his that I
  have not seen. I was expecting the knife before he raised his arm; has he got
  safely away?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so," said T.B. Then, "You have learnt nothing more?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she said. "He told me a story of the rendezvous, but it was, of
  course, a lie; but I have earned my reward."</p>

  <p>"I think you need have no fear as to that," said the detective. "Although
  I knew that your brother was somewhere on this coast, I should, in all
  probability, have arrived days too late but for your telegram; you will
  remain in Tangier under the protection of the British Consul."</p>

  <p>He was going away, but she called him.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand why you allowed my brother to escape " she began.
  "That you should desire blank cartridges to be placed in his revolver is not
  so difficult, but I do not see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," said T.B. politely, and left her abruptly.</p>

  <p>He sprang on to a horse that was waiting, and went clattering down the
  hill, through the Sok, down the narrow main street that passes the mosque;
  dismounting by the Custom House, he placed his horse in charge of a waiting
  soldier, and walked swiftly along the narrow wooden pier.</p>

  <p>At the same time as Silinski was boarding the D'oro, T.B. was being rowed
  in a cockleshell of a pinnace to the long destroyer which lay, without
  lights, in the bay.</p>

  <p>He swung himself up a tiny ladder on to the steel deck that rang hollow
  under his feet.</p>

  <p>"All right?" said a voice in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"All right," said T.B.; a bell tinkled somewhere, the destroyer moved
  slowly ahead, and swung out to sea.</p>

  <p>"Will you have any difficulty in picking her up?" He was standing in the
  cramped space of the little bridge, wedged between a quick-firing gun and the
  navigation desk.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I think not," said the officer; "our difficulty will be to keep
  out of sight of her. It will be an easy matter to keep her in view because
  she stands high out of the water, and she is pretty sure to burn her
  regulation lights. By day I shall let her get hull down and take her masts
  for guide."</p>

  <p>It was the strangest procession that followed the southern bend of the
  African Coast. First went the <i>Doro</i>, its passengers serenely
  unconscious of the fact that six miles away, below the rim of the horizon,
  followed a slim ugly destroyer that did not once lose sight of the
  <i>Doro</i>'s mainmast; behind the destroyer, and three miles distant, came
  six destroyers steaming abreast. Behind them, four miles away, six swift
  cruisers.</p>

  <p>That same night there steamed from Funchal in the Island of Madeira, the
  Victor Hugo, Conde, Gloire, and the Edgard Quinet of the French fleet; the
  Boon, Torek, Prim Adalbert, and the battleship Pommern, of the German navy,
  with sixteen destroyers, and followed a parallel ocean path.</p>

  <p>After three days' steaming, the <i>Doro</i> turned sharply to starboard,
  and the unseen fleets that dogged her turned too. In that circle of death,
  for a whole week, the little Spanish steamer twisted and turned, and,
  obedient to the message that went from destroyer to cruiser, the fleets
  followed her every movement. For the <i>Doro</i> was unconsciously leading
  the nations to the mad battleship. She had been slipped with that object. So
  far every part of the plan had worked well. To make doubly sure, the news of
  Zillier's escape from Devil's Island had been circulated in every country. It
  was essential that if they missed the <i>Maria Braganza</i> this time, they
  should catch her on the first of June at "Lolo."</p>

  <p>"And where that is," said T.B. in despair, "heaven only knows."</p>

  <p>Wearing a heavy overcoat, he was standing on the narrow deck of the
  destroyer as she pounded through the seas. They had found the South-East
  trade winds at a surprisingly northerly latitude, and the sea was choppy and
  cold.</p>

  <p>Young Marchcourt, the youthful skipper of the Martine, grinned.</p>

  <p>"'Lolo' is 'nowhere,' isn't it?" he said. "You'll find it charted on all
  Admiralty maps; it's the place where the supply transport is always waiting
  on manoeuvres&mdash;I wish to heaven these squalls would drop," he added
  irritably, as a sudden gust of wind and rain struck the tiny ship.</p>

  <p>"Feel sea-sick?" suggested T.B. maliciously.</p>

  <p>"Not much&mdash;but I'm horribly afraid of losing sight of this hooker
  ahead."</p>

  <p>He lifted the flexible end of a speaking tube, and pressed a button.</p>

  <p>"Give her a few more revolutions, Cole," he said. He hung up the tube. "We
  look like carrying this weather with us for a few days," he said, "and as I
  don't feel competent to depend entirely upon my own eyesight, I shall bring
  up the Magneto and the Solus to help me watch this beggar."</p>

  <p>Obedient to his signal, two destroyers were detached from the following
  flotilla, and came abreast at dusk.</p>

  <p>The weather grew rapidly worse, the squalls of greater frequence. The sea
  rose, so that life upon the destroyer was anything but pleasant. At midnight,
  T.B. Smith was awakened from a restless sleep by a figure in gleaming
  oilskins.</p>

  <p>"I say," said a gloomy voice, "we've lost sight of that dashed
  <i>Doro</i>."</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>T.B. jumped from his bunk, to be immediately precipitated against the
  other side of the cabin.</p>

  <p>"Lost her light&mdash;it has either gone out or been put out. We're going
  ahead now full speed in the hope of overhauling her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Another oil-skinned figure came to the door.</p>

  <p>"Light ahead, sir."</p>

  <p>"Thank heaven!" said the other fervently, and bolted to the deck.</p>

  <p>T.B. struggled into his clothing, and with some difficulty made, his way
  to the bridge. As he climbed the little steel ladder, he heard the engine
  bell ring, and instantly the rattle and jar of the engines ceased.</p>

  <p>"She's stationary," explained the officer, "so we've stopped. She has
  probably upset herself in this sea."</p>

  <p>"How do you know she is stationary?" asked T.B., for the two faint stars
  ahead told him nothing.</p>

  <p>"Got her riding lights," said the other laconically.</p>

  <p>Those two riding lights stopped the destroyer; it stopped six other
  destroyers, far out of sight, six obedient cruisers came to a halt, and a
  hundred miles or so away, the combined French and German fleets became
  stationary.</p>

  <p>All through the night the watchers lay, heaving, rolling, and pitching,
  like so many logs on the troubled seas. Dawn broke mistily, but the lights
  still gleamed. Day came in dull greyness, and the young officer, with his
  eyes fastened to his binoculars, looked long and earnestly ahead.</p>

  <p>"I can see a mast," he said doubtfully, "but there's something very
  curious about it."</p>

  <p>Then he put down his glasses suddenly, put out his hand, and rang his
  engines full ahead.</p>

  <p>He turned to the quarter-master at his side.</p>

  <p>"Get the Commodore by wireless," he said rapidly, "the <i>Doro</i> has
  gone."</p>

  <p>Gone, indeed, was the <i>Doro</i>&mdash;gone six hours since.</p>

  <p>They found the lights. They were still burning when the destroyer came up
  with them.</p>

  <p>A roughly built raft with a pole lashed upright, and from this was
  suspended two lanterns.</p>

  <p>Whilst the fleet had watched this raft, the <i>Doro</i> had gone on.
  Nailed to the pole was a letter. It was sodden with spray, but T.B. had no
  difficulty in reading it.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Cher ami," it ran, "much as I value the honour of a naval
  escort, its presence is embarrassing at the moment. I saw your destroyer this
  morning through my glasses, and guessed the rest. You are ingenious. Now I
  understand why you allowed me to escape.</p>

  <p class="letter">"My love and duty to Catherine, if she still lives; for
  yourself, my respectful salutations, most admirable of policemen."</p>

  <p>It was signed "Silinski."</p>

  <p>I am happy to think that the court-martial held on Lieutenant-Commander
  George Septimus Marchcourt, on a charge of "neglect of duty, in that he
  failed to carry out the instructions of his superior officer," resulted in an
  honourable acquittal for that cheerful young officer. It was an acquittal,
  which had a far-reaching effect, though at the time it did not promise
  well.</p>

  <p>T.B. was a witness at the trial, which was a purely formal one, in spite
  of the attention it excited.</p>

  <p>T.B. remained at Gibraltar, pending further developments. For the affair
  of the Nine Men had got beyond Scotland Yard&mdash;they were an international
  problem.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the information supplied by Torquet in Brixton prison,
  supplemented by such particulars as Catherine Silinski was able to supply,
  the European agents had been arrested. Their trials&mdash;if one may
  anticipate a little&mdash;were of the most sensational character, but in no
  case, whether the investigation was before the gentle tribunals peculiar to
  English law, or whether they were instituted by the more vigorous courts of
  France, Germany, or Russia, was the mystery of "Lolo" solved.</p>

  <p>But of "Lolo" she had no information to give</p>

  <p>Catherine's evidence,* however, was particularly valuable to T.B., not so
  much because she was able to assist him in his search for the Nine, but from
  the inside history she was able to give of the working of this colossal
  organization of crime. We know now the cause of many market "breaks" which
  were, at the time, inexplicable. We catch a glimpse, in her fascinating story
  of the method adopted by the Nine, their directors' meetings, to which,
  apparently, she was admitted. Catherine appears to have shared the confidence
  of Meyers, who from time to time confided his fears to her; she knew,
  intimately, Baggin, and it was through her that Silinski and he met.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The evidence of Catherine Maria Silinski in relation
  to the operations of 'The Cadiz Conspirators"-Blue Book, 747-11 (Home
  Office). ]</p>

  <p>T.B. was walking over from La Linea, across the strip of neutral ground
  which separated Gibraltar from Spain, with young Marchcourt, when he
  confessed that he despaired of ever bringing the Nine to justice.</p>

  <p>"The nations cannot stand the racket much longer," he said; "these Nine
  Men are costing civilization a million a week! Think of it! A million pounds
  a week! We must either capture them soon or effect a compromise. I am afraid
  they will make peace on their own terms.</p>

  <p>"But they must be caught soon," urged the other.</p>

  <p>"Why?" demanded T.B. irritably. "Why 'must'. Man, we couldn't catch De Wet
  in the restricted area of the Orange Eiver Colony; how can we hope to capture
  one of the fastest war vessels afloat when the men who control her have all
  the seas to run in!"</p>

  <p>"The crew will get tired. After all, they have nothing to gain," persisted
  the officer; "that is the weakness of their position."</p>

  <p>"And their strength," said T.B. "If these men have been persuaded to take
  the first step in piracy, the rest is easy; if by the promise of huge
  rewards, they have been induced to put their necks in the noose, the
  realization of their danger will only make them the more determined to go
  through with their enterprise."</p>

  <p>They had reached the waterport, and T.B. stopped before his hotel.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he said suddenly. The two men passed through the paved
  vestibule and mounted the stair, to T.B.'s room. "I'm going to show you our
  clue," he said grimly, and extracted from his portfolio the drawing of the
  little cross with the circular ends.</p>

  <p>T.B. himself does not know to this day why he was moved to produce this
  disappointing little diagram at that moment. It may have been that, as a
  forlorn hope, he relied upon the application of a fresh young mind to the
  problem which was so stale in his.</p>

  <p>The officer looked and frowned.</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" asked Marchcourt, without disguising his
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>"That is all," responded T.B.</p>

  <p>They sat looking at the diagram in silence, and T.B., as was his
  peculiarity, scribbled mechanically on the blotting pad before him.</p>

  <p>He drew flowers, and men's heads, and impossible structures of all kinds;
  he made inaccurate tracings of maps, of columns, pediments, squares, and
  triangles. Then, in the same absent way, he made a rough copy of the
  diagram.</p>

  <p>Then his pencil stopped and he sat bolt upright.</p>

  <p>"Gee!" he whispered.</p>

  <p>The young naval officer looked up in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Whew!" whistled T.B.</p>

  <p>He jumped up, walked to his trunk, and drew out an atlas.</p>

  <p>He turned the leaves, looked long and earnestly at something he saw,
  closed the book, and turned a little white; but his eyes were blazing.</p>

  <p>"I have found Lolo," he said simply.</p>

  <p>He took up his pencil and quickly sketched the diagram:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1203541h-images/TOM6a.jpg"
         title="Diagram 1"
         alt="Diagram&quot;">
  </div><br>

  <p>"What that means perhaps our nautical friend will tell us," he said
  triumphantly, and with a return to his old mannerism.</p>

  <p>But young Marchcourt only shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Look," said T.B., and added a few letters.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1203541h-images/TOM6b.jpg"
         title="Diagram 1"
         alt="Diagram&quot;">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Longitude nought; latitude nought&mdash;L.0, L.0!" whispered the officer.
  "By Jove! Why, this is off the African coast."</p>

  <p>T.B. nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is where the Greenwich meridian crosses the equator," he said. "It's
  'nowhere'! The only 'nowhere' in the world!"</p>

  <h2><a id="chap36"
     name="chap36">XXXVI. &mdash; AT "LOLO"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">UNDER an awning on the quarterdeck of the <i>Maria
  Braganza</i>, George T. Baggin was stretched out in the easiest of
  easy-chairs in an attitude of luxurious comfort.</p>

  <p>"Admiral" Lombrosa, passing on his way to his cabin, smacked him
  familiarly upon the shoulder&mdash;an attitude which epitomized the changed
  relationships of the pair.</p>

  <p>The <i>Maria Braganza</i> was steaming slowly eastward, and, since it was
  the hour of siesta, the deck was strewn with the recumbent forms of men.</p>

  <p>Baggin looked up with a scowl.</p>

  <p>"Where is Silinski?" he asked, and the other laughed.</p>

  <p>"He sleeps, Se&ntilde;or President," said the "Admiral.' '&mdash;there had been
  some curious promotions on board the <i>Maria Braganza</i>&mdash;"he is
  amusing, your Silinski."</p>

  <p>Baggin wriggled uncomfortably in his chair, but made no answer, and the
  other man eyed him keenly.</p>

  <p>Baggin must have felt rather than observed the scrutiny, for suddenly he
  looked up and caught the sailor's eye.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" he asked, as though to some unspoken question. Then, "Where is
  Meyers?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Again the smile on the swart face of the Brazilian.</p>

  <p>"He is here," he said, as a stout figure in white ducks shuffled awkwardly
  along the canting deck.</p>

  <p>He came opposite to Baggin; and, drawing a chair towards him, with a
  grunt, he dropped into it with a crash.</p>

  <p>"You get fatter and fatter, my friend," said Baggin, regarding the
  monstrous figure with the interest he would have given to some strange
  beast.</p>

  <p>"Fatter!" gasped the other&mdash;ever short of breath was Lucas
  Meyers&mdash;of course I'm fatter! No exercise&mdash;this cursed ship! Oh,
  what a fool, what a fool I've been!"</p>

  <p>He wriggled his big head, and the rolling fat of his neck creased and
  bulged.</p>

  <p>"Forget it," said Baggin. He took a long gold case from his inside pocket,
  opened it, and selected with care a black cheroot. " Forget it."</p>

  <p>"Wish I could! oh, heaven, I wish I could!" wheezed Meyers. "I'd give half
  a million to be safe in the hands of the Official Receiver! I'd give half a
  million to be servin' five years in Portland! Baggin," he said, with comic
  earnestness, "we've got to compromise! It's got to be done. Where do we
  stand, eh?"</p>

  <p>Baggin puffed leisurely at his cigar, but made no attempt to elucidate the
  position.</p>

  <p>The other man did not wait for any answer. He wrheezed on, whining,
  complaining, cursing.</p>

  <p>Baggin was used to all this; he had had years of it, but now, with his
  nerves on edge, this cowardice of Meyers' grated.</p>

  <p>"I've got an idea, see?" Meyers was saying, with unwonted eagerness. "I'm
  a nuisance to you, ain't I? I know I am. Now, suppose you ventured into some
  little port, eh? Put me ashore in a boat. I'd turn King's evidence&mdash;them
  London murders, Hyatt an' Moss&mdash;it wouldn't do you any harm, but it'd
  save me, see? You'd still be at sea; still be free, eh? I'll make over my
  share to you&mdash;just enough to get ashore an' live comfortably, if they
  let me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Splendid, splendid!" said the silky voice of Silinski.</p>

  <p>Meyers jerked himself erect, with a start. "Hey!" he breathed. "Hey,
  Silinski! You go sneakin' about in your bare feet. Don't do it! I hate it,
  Silinski; it unnerves me. I hate people who come creepin' on a man unawares!
  That's what you do, Silinski! It's&mdash;it's not gentlemanly."</p>

  <p>"It is not gentlemanly to talk of deserting your comrades; deserting this
  ocean republic we have founded," said Silinski gently; "that is treason, high
  treason."</p>

  <p>"Rot!" exploded Meyers. "Rot! Never approved of it; never saw any sense in
  it! Presidents! Admirals! Citizens! Oaths! Bah!"</p>

  <p>The Admiral had walked away to the after-rail.</p>

  <p>"Where are the Nine Men of Cadiz!" demanded Meyers, the sweat rolling down
  his cheeks, a tragic-comic figure. "Where is Bortuski? Where is Morson? Where
  is Couthwright? Zillier, we know where he is, or was, but where are the
  others? You an' me, an' this feller Silinski, an' the rest&mdash;phutt!" He
  made a little noise with his mouth. "I know!" he said. He raised a trembling
  finger accusingly. "They were all here when Silinski came aboard&mdash;less'n
  a week ago."</p>

  <p>"My dear man," said Baggin lazily, though his face was white and his lips
  firm-pressed. "There was the storm&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's a lie!" screamed the fat man, beating the air with his hands;
  "that's a lie! The storm didn't take Kohr from his bunk an' leave blood on
  his pillow! It didn't make Morson's cabin smell of chloroform! I know, I
  know!"</p>

  <p>"There is such a thing as knowing too much," said George T. Baggin, rising
  unsteadily. "Meyers," he said, "I've been a good friend of yours because I
  sort of like you in spite of your foolishness. Our friends perished in the
  storm; it wasn't a bad thing for us, taking matters all round. If this
  manifesto of ours doesn't secure us a pardon, we can risk making a run for
  safety. There are fewer of us to blab. See here"&mdash;he sat down on the
  side of the other's chair and dropped his voice&mdash;"suppose we can't shock
  this old world into giving us a free pardon, and the sun gets too warm for
  us, as it will sooner or later&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Suppose it!" Meyers burst in. "D'ye think there's an hour of the day or
  night when I don't suppose it? Lord! I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen, can't you?" said Baggin savagely. "When that happens, what are we
  to do? We've buried gold on the African coast; we've buried it on the South
  American coast&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All the crew know," grunted the fat man, "we're at the mercy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait! wait!" said the other wearily. "Suppose there comes a time when we
  must make a dash for safety&mdash;with the steam pinnace. Slipping away in
  the night when the men of the watch are doped. You and me, Silinski and the
  Admiral"&mdash;he bent his head lower&mdash;"leaving a time-fuse in the
  magazine"&mdash;he whispered&mdash;"there's a way out for us, my friend!"</p>

  <p>Meyers said nothing. The cold-blooded villainy of the proposal did not
  shock him; for a moment a gleam of hope lit the dark places of his miserable
  soul.</p>

  <p>"But Zillier," he whispered huskily; "we're going to pick up Zillier; why
  not leave him?"</p>

  <p>"He knows more than any other of our plans," said Baggin; "he will be
  safer with us&mdash;for a time."</p>

  <p>"We're going to make one last effort," he went on, "between here and
  'Lolo' we fall in with the outward bound intermediate Cape mail. It shall be
  our last attack upon civilization&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't do it!" begged Meyers; "for the love of heaven, don't do it! I
  can't stand it, Baggin! I can't stand it!"</p>

  <p>He stood on the deck, his feet wide apart, his big body quivering with
  fear. Terror gave him a certain dignity; he was grotesque rather than
  ridiculous.</p>

  <p>"Drop Zillier! Drop everything! Let us clear out&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Baggin left him babbling and walked to where Silinski strolled with the
  Captain.</p>

  <p>"I've done my best," he said shortly; "he's just mad with fright; there's
  no backbone in him."</p>

  <p>Silinski nodded.</p>

  <p>They ate a silent meal in the magnificently upholstered wardroom, which
  had been converted into a saloon for the officers of the Republic.* After
  dinner, Silinski and Baggin promenaded the quarter deck together.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *The exact constitution of this extraordinary Republic
  is not very dear. We have to depend upon the evidence of the warship's crew
  for such information as we possess, and it would appear that their knowledge
  was of the slightest-E. W. ]</p>

  <p>"Meyers has gone below," reported the latter in answer to a question; "he
  got no sleep last night."</p>

  <p>"He's a greater danger than any of the others," said Silinski quietly.</p>

  <p>They stood for a while watching phosphorescence on the water till
  Lombrosa's voice recalled them.</p>

  <p>"Are you there?" he called quickly. They detected the agitation in his
  tone and turned together.</p>

  <p>"It's Meyers," said the Captain rapidly. "I found him in the wireless
  cabin, trying to send a message. He's half mad."</p>

  <p>"Where is he!" demanded Silinski, but, before his tongue had formed the
  words, the voice of the fat man came to him. He came along, the centre of a
  swaying body of sailors, who held him.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, silence him!" said the Brazilian hoarsely. "Don't you
  hear?"</p>

  <p>"Dead! ye'll all be dead!" yelled Meyers. He was screaming at the top of
  his voice in English. "Eh! a time-fuse in your dam' magazine! whilst they get
  away with the money! Hold 'em! Catch 'em, ye fools!"</p>

  <p>At any moment he might remember that the Brazilians who held him could not
  understand a word he said.</p>

  <p>Silinski gave an order, and the struggling man was flung to the deck.</p>

  <p>"Murder!" he screamed. "Hyatt, an' the other feller! an' poor Morson, an'
  Kohr. I see the blood on his pillow! an' a time-fuse in the
  magazine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Silinski thrust a handkerchief in his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Chloroform," he said in Spanish. "Our friend has been drinking."</p>

  <p>In a few seconds Baggin was back with a bottle of colourless liquid, and a
  saturated handkerchief was pressed over the struggling man's mouth.</p>

  <p>He was silent at last, and, at a word from their Captain, the men who held
  him released their hold, and went forward to their quarters.</p>

  <p>The three men stood in silence, gazing down at the huddled figure. Then,
  "He must go," said Silinski, and Baggin nodded.</p>

  <p>Nobody heard the splash of him as he fell into the water, or heard the one
  scream of horror that came from his lips as the cold of the water revived
  him, or saw his large white face staring blankly into the darkness ere he
  went down to his death.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap37"
     name="chap37">XXXVII. &mdash; THE LAST OF THE NINE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TO a calm sea, to a dawn all pearl and rose, the crew of the
  <i>Maria Braganza</i> woke. In the night the speed of the warship had been
  accelerated until she was moving at her top speed, and two columns of black
  smoke belched from her great funnels. The two men who came on deck at the
  same moment did not speak one to the other. Baggin was pale; there were dark
  circles about his eyes; he looked like a man who had not slept. But Silinski
  was unperturbed to the last.</p>

  <p>Dapper, shaven, not unusually pallid, he woke as from a pleasant dream,
  and appeared on deck trim from point of shoe to finger-nail&mdash;a singular
  man.</p>

  <p>All the morning preparations were going on. Ammunition came up from the
  magazine, dilatory quarter-masters swung out guns; on the masthead was an
  under-officer armed with a telescope.</p>

  <p>He was the principal object of interest to the men on the quarter deck.
  Every few minutes their eyes would go sweeping aloft.</p>

  <p>Beyond the curtest "buenos dias" neither the Captain, Baggin, nor the calm
  Silinski spoke. In Baggin's heart grew a new terror, and he avoided
  Silinski.</p>

  <p>The sun beat down on the stretch of awning that protected the privileged
  three, but for some reason Baggin did not feel the heat.</p>

  <p>He had a something on his mind; a question to ask; and at last he summoned
  his resolution to put it. He walked over to where Silinski sat reading.</p>

  <p>"Gregory," he said&mdash;he had never so addressed him before&mdash;"is
  the end near?"</p>

  <p>Silinski had raised his eyes when the other had come toward him; he
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Which variety of end?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There is only one variety," said Baggin steadily. "There is only one
  thing in the world that counts, and that is life."</p>

  <p>"Not money?" sneered the Pole.</p>

  <p>"Not money," repeated Baggin; "least of all money."</p>

  <p>"You have been reading," said Silinski promptly&mdash;it was a point with
  him that all disturbing thought came as a result of book-reading; "we are at
  the very beginning of a new life, my friend&mdash;look, look!"</p>

  <p>From where they stood the man on the mainmast was visible; he was shouting
  to somebody on the bridge and pointing northward.</p>

  <p>"You see?" said Silinski triumphantly, "at the moment of your despair
  comes the spur to action; throw your philosophies overboard, my friend; they
  killed Meyers because they developed into fear. We will make our final appeal
  to the world."</p>

  <p>It came reluctantly into view, a big grey-painted steamer with red and
  black funnels, a great lumbering ocean beast.</p>

  <p>Through their glasses the three men watched her, a puzzled frown upon the
  Captain's face.</p>

  <p>"I do not recognize her," he said. "She is larger than the Ross Castle;
  she looks like a gigantic cargo steamer."</p>

  <p>"Her decks are crowded with passengers," said Baggin. "I can see women's
  hats and men in white; what is that structure forward?" He indicated a long
  superstructure before the steamer's bridge.</p>

  <p>"There goes her flag."</p>

  <p>A little ball crept up to the mainmast.</p>

  <p>"We will show her ours," said the Captain pleasantly, and pushed a
  button.</p>

  <p>Instantly, with a crash that shook the ship, the forward gun of the
  <i>Maria Braganza</i> sent a shell whizzing through the air.</p>

  <p>It fell short and wide of the steamer.</p>

  <p>The Captain turned to Silinski as for instructions.</p>

  <p>"Sink her," said Silinski.</p>

  <p>But the steamer was never sunk.</p>

  <p>The little ball that hung at the main suddenly broke, and out to the
  breeze there floated not the red ensign of the merchant service, but the
  stars and stripes of America&mdash;more, on the little flagstaff at the bow
  of the ship fluttered a tiny blue flag spangled with stars.</p>

  <p>Livid of face, Captain Lombrosa sprang to the wheeL</p>

  <p>"It's a Yankee man-o'-war!" he-cried, and his voice was cracked.
  "We've&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As he spoke the superstructure on the "intermediate," which had excited
  Baggin's curiosity, fell apart like a house of canvas&mdash;as it
  was&mdash;and the long slim barrel of a nine-inch gun swung round.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The shell carried away a boat and a part of the wireless cabin.</p>

  <p>"Every gun!" yelled Lombrosa, frantically pressing the buttons on the
  bridge before him. "We must run for it!"</p>

  <p>Instantly, with an ear-splitting succession of crashes, the guns of the
  Maria Braganza came into action.</p>

  <p>To the last, fortune was with the Nine, for the second or third shot sent
  the American over with a list to starboard.</p>

  <p>Bound swung the <i>Maria Braganza</i> like a frightened hare; the water
  foamed under her bows as, running under every ounce of steam, she made her
  retreat</p>

  <p>"We must drop all idea of picking up Zillier," said Baggin, white to the
  lips; "this damned warship is probably in wireless communication with a
  fleet; can you tap her messages?"</p>

  <p>Silinski shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The first shell smashed our apparatus," he said. "What is that
  ahead!"</p>

  <p>Lombrosa, with his telescope glued to his eye, was scanning the
  horizon.</p>

  <p>"It looks like a sea fog."</p>

  <p>But the Captain made no reply.</p>

  <p>Over the edge of the ocean hung a thin red haze. He put the glass down,
  and turned a troubled face to the two men.</p>

  <p>"In other latitudes I should say that it was a gathering typhoon," he
  said. He took another long look, put down the telescope, closed it
  mechanically, and hung it in the rack.</p>

  <p>"Smoke," he said briefly. "We are running into a fleet!"</p>

  <p>He brought the <i>Maria Braganza</i>'s bows northward but the smoke haze
  was there, too.</p>

  <p>East, north, south, west, a great circle of smoke and the <i>Maria
  Braganza</i> trapped in the very centre.</p>

  <p>Out of the smoke haze grey shadowy shapes, dirty grey hulls, white hulls,
  hulls black as pitch, loomed into view.</p>

  <p>The Captain rang his engines to "stop."</p>

  <p>"We are caught," he said.</p>

  <p>He opened a locker on the bridge leisurely, and took out a revolver.</p>

  <p>"I have no regrets," he said&mdash;it was a challenge to fate.</p>

  <p>Then he shot himself and fell dead at the feet of the two. Baggin sprang
  forward, but too late.</p>

  <p>"You coward! you coward!" he screamed. He shook his fist in the dead man's
  face, then he turned like a wild beast on Silinski. "This is the end of it!
  This is the end of your scheme! Curse you! Curse you!"</p>

  <p>He leaped at the Pole's throat.</p>

  <p>For a moment they swayed and struggled, then suddenly Baggin released his
  hold, dropped his head like a tired man, and slid to the deck.</p>

  <p>Silinski wiped his knife on the white duck coat of his fallen fellow, and
  lit a cigar with a hand that did not tremble.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">One last expiring effort the <i>Maria Braganza</i> made: you
  could almost follow Silinski as he sped from one side of the ship to the
  other, by the spasmodic shots that came from the doomed ship.</p>

  <p>Then four men-of-war&mdash;the <i>Boon</i>, the <i>Connecticut</i>, the
  <i>Black Prince</i>, and the <i>Gloire</i>&mdash;detached themselves from the
  encircling fleets and steamed in toward the Brazilian. Shell after shell beat
  upon the steel hull of the "Mad Battleship," a great hole gaped in her side,
  her funnels were shot away, her foremast hung limply.</p>

  <p>A white flag waved feebly from her bridge and a British destroyer came
  with a swift run across the smoky seas.</p>

  <p>Up the companion-ladder came a rush of marines; and, after them, a
  revolver in his hand, T.B. Smith, a prosaic Assistant-Commissioner from
  Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>And the end of this extraordinary story of crime was as commonplace as it
  could well be.</p>

  <p>T.B. came upon Silinski standing with his back to a bulkhead,
  grimy&mdash;bloodstained, but with the butt of a cigar still glowing in the
  corner of his mouth.</p>

  <p>"You are Gregory Silinski," said T.B., and snapped a pair of handcuffs on
  his wrists. "I shall take you into custody on a charge of wilful murder, and
  I caution you that anything you now say may be used in evidence against you
  at your trial."</p>

  <p>Silinski said nothing.</p>
