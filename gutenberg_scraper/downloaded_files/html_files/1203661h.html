  <h2><a name="ch-00"
     id="ch-00"></a>PROLOGUE</h2>

  <p class="first">The last sally had been, made and repulsed, the last shot
  fired; the fight was over, and victory remained with the white men. And yet,
  after all, was it a victory or a massacre? If you were a stay-at-home, and
  read the report from the telegrams in your club, or in the triumphant columns
  of the daily papers, especially those on the side of the Ministry, you would
  certainly have pronounced it the former. But if you had been there on the
  spot, and had seen the half-naked, ill-armed natives, with the fire of
  patriotism blazing in their eyes and leaping in their hearts&mdash;had seen
  them being shot down in rows by the merciless guns of the English
  batteries&mdash;another view of the matter might have presented itself to
  you. It might have occurred to you that these men were fighting on their own
  soil for their freedom and their country, and that the spirit which was
  blinding their eyes to the hopelessness of resistance, and urging them on to
  resist the stranger's progress with such passionate ineffectiveness, was,
  after all, a natural and a poetic one. But, after all, this has nothing to do
  with my story.</p>

  <p>The battle was over and it was morning. Far away in the east a dull red
  light had arisen from over the tops of the towering black mountains, and an
  angry sun was sullenly shining on the scene of carnage. It was a low
  hillside, once pleasant enough to look upon, but at that moment probably the
  most hideous sight which the whole universe could have shown. The silvery
  streams, which had trickled lazily down to the valley below, now ran thick
  and red with blood. The luxuriant shrubs and high waving ferns were trampled
  down and disfigured, and, most horrible sight of all, everywhere were strewn
  the copper-colored forms of the beaten natives. There they lay apart and in
  heaps in all imaginable postures, and with all imaginable expressions on
  their hard, battered faces. Some lay on their sides with their fingers locked
  around their spears, and the rigid frown and convulsed passion of an undying
  hatred branded on their numbed features. Others less brave had been shot in
  the back whilst flying from the death-dealing fire of the European guns, and
  lay stretched about in attitudes which in life would have been comical, but
  in death were grotesquely hideous; and over the sloping fields the misty
  clouds of smoke still lingered and curled upwards from the battered extinct
  shells which lay thick on the ground.</p>

  <p>High above the scene of devastation, on a rocky tableau at the summit of
  the range of hills, were pitched the tents of the victors. A little apart
  from these, conspicuous by the flag which floated above it was the general's
  tent; and underneath that sloping roof of canvas a strange scene was being
  enacted.</p>

  <p>Seated amongst a little group of the superior officers, with a heavy frown
  on his stern face, sat the general. Before him, at a little distance, with a
  soldier on either side, stood a tall, slight young man, in the uniform of an
  officer, but swordless. His smooth face, as yet beardless, was dyed with a
  deep flush, which might well be there, whether it proceeded from shame or
  indignation. For he was under arrest, and charged with a crime which, in a
  soldier, is heinous indeed&mdash;it was cowardice.</p>

  <p>It was a court-martial before which he stood arraigned, although a hastily
  improvised one. But soldiers have prompt ideas of justice, and General Luxton
  was a martinet in all matters of discipline. Disciplinarian though he was,
  however, he liked little the task which was now before him.</p>

  <p>He looked up from the papers, which were stretched out on the rickety
  little round table, with a sudden movement, and bent his frowning gaze upon
  the accused. The young man returned his gaze steadily, but the color in his
  cheeks grew deeper.</p>

  <p>"Herbert Devereux, you stand accused of a crime which, in your profession,
  nothing can palliate or excuse. Have you anything to say for yourself?"</p>

  <p>"There will be no need for me to say anything, sir," was the prompt reply.
  "It is true that I turned my back upon the enemy, but it was to face a
  greater danger. The man whose life I saved can disprove this cruel charge
  against me in a moment. I admit that, from your point of view, appearances
  are suspicious, but you nave only to learn from my half-brother, Rupert
  Devereux, why I quitted my post, and what I effected by so doing, to absolve
  me at least from all suspicion of cowardice, however much I may be to blame
  as a matter of discipline."</p>

  <p>General Luxton appeared surprised, a little relieved.</p>

  <p>"I hope so," he said, not unkindly. "Roberts, send an orderly to
  Lieutenant Devereux's tent, and command his presence at once."</p>

  <p>The man withdrew, and there was a few minutes' delay. Then the entrance to
  the tent was lifted up, and a tall, dark young man, with thin but decided
  features, and flashing black eyes, stepped forward. He was handsome, after a
  certain type, but his expression was too lifeless and supercilious to be
  prepossessing.</p>

  <p>General Luxton looked up and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant Devereux, your half-brother, who stands accused of cowardice
  in the face of the enemy, appeals to you to give evidence on his behalf. Let
  us hear what you saw of him during the recent fighting."</p>

  <p>Eagerly, and with a confident light in his fair young face, the prisoner
  turned towards the man to whom these words were addressed. But slowly and
  deliberately the latter turned his back upon his half-brother without
  noticing his glance of appeal, and with a scornful light in his eyes. There
  was a slight murmur and an interchange of looks amongst the few who were
  present at this significant action.</p>

  <p>"I do not know, General Luxton," he said, slowly, "what the prisoner can
  expect me to say likely to benefit him. He can scarcely be so mad as to
  expect me to shield him in this matter on account of our relationship, or to
  preserve the honor of our name, and yet I do not see why else he should have
  appealed to me. I saw very little of the affair, and would rather not have
  seen that. I was riding to you, sir, with a message from Colonel Elliott,
  and, as I passed trench 4, I saw the prisoner suddenly leave his company and
  run towards me. He passed several yards to the left, and as he seemed to be
  hurrying along aimlessly, I called to him. He made no answer, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Liar!"</p>

  <p>The word seemed hurled out with such a passionate intensity that every one
  started. General Luxton looked up angrily.</p>

  <p>"Silence, sir! You will have an opportunity of saying what you have to say
  presently. Proceed, Devereux."</p>

  <p>"As I was saying," Rupert Devereux continued calmly, without appearing to
  have noticed the interruption, "he made no answer, but seemed to wish to
  avoid me. As the message with which I was entrusted was an important one, I
  rode on and left him hurrying towards the rear."</p>

  <p>With, a sterner air even than he had at first assumed, General Luxton
  turned towards the unfortunate young man who stood before him. He was
  standing as though turned to stone, with wide-open eyes, staring at the man
  who had just spoken, attitude and expression alike bespeaking an overpowering
  bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"You are at liberty to ask the witness any questions," the General said,
  shortly.</p>

  <p>For a moment there was a dead silence. Then the words came pouring out
  from his quivering lips like a mountain torrent.</p>

  <p>"Rupert, what have you said? What does this mean? Good God, are you trying
  to ruin me? Did I not run to your assistance because you were beset by those
  three blackguards? Didn't I kill two of them and save your life? You can't
  have forgotten it! Why are you lying? Hilton saw it all, and so did Fenwick.
  Where are they? My God, this is horrible!"</p>

  <p>The deep flush had gone from his cheeks, and left him pale as death. Great
  beads of perspiration stood out upon his forehead, and there was a wild look
  in his deep blue eyes. But the man to whom he made his passionate appeal kept
  his back turned and heeded not a word of it. Instead of answering he
  addressed the General.</p>

  <p>"General Luxton," Rupert said, calmly, "the accused, in denying the truth
  of my statement, mentions the names of two men whom he admits were witnesses
  of this lamentable occurrence. Might I suggest that they be called to give
  their version?"</p>

  <p>The General nodded assent, and the thing was done. But Hilton was the only
  one who answered the summons, and on reference to a list of the killed and
  wounded it was found that Fenwick was reported missing.</p>

  <p>"John Hilton, the accused has appealed to you to give evidence on his
  behalf. Let us hear what you saw of him during the recent fighting."</p>

  <p>The man, an ordinary-looking private, stepped forward and saluted.</p>

  <p>"I only saw him for a moment, sir," he said, slowly, and with a marked
  reluctance. "I was riding behind Lieutenant Devereux when I saw him leave his
  company and pass us a few yards to the left. It struck me that he looked very
  pale, and I thought that perhaps he was wounded."</p>

  <p>"He did not leave his company to come to your master's assistance,
  then?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not, sir. We were not in any need of it. None of the enemy were
  near us."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. You can go, Hilton."</p>

  <p>The man saluted and went.</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence for a full minute. Then there came a passionate,
  hysterical cry from the prisoner&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Liar! Liar! General Luxton, upon my honor, either my brother anti this
  man are under some hallucination or they have entered into a conspiracy
  against me. Before God Almighty I swear that I only left my post because
  several of the enemy had crept down from the hill behind and had attacked my
  brother and his servant. I killed one of them, and the blood of the other is
  still on my sword. Why, Rupert, you know that you called out, 'Thanks,
  Herbert, you have saved my life.' Those were your very words!"</p>

  <p>The man appealed to shook his head slowly and as though with great
  reluctance. The sight seemed to madden the prisoner, and he made a sudden
  movement forward as though to spring at him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, this is horrible!" he cried. "Where is Fenwick? He saw it all. Let
  him be called."</p>

  <p>General Luxton glanced again at the list before him and looked up.</p>

  <p>"You are unfortunate in your selections," he said, dryly. "The evidence of
  Hilton and your brother, to whom you appealed, only strengthen the case
  against you. Fenwick is missing. Herbert Devereux," he went on sternly, "the
  charge against you has been proved. I, myself, at a most critical moment, saw
  you desert your post when it was the centre of attack, and it fell to
  another's lot to lead your men on to the pursuit. The reasons which you have
  brought forward to account for your unwarrantable action have been clearly
  disposed of. You are most certainly guilty of a crime for which, amongst
  soldiers, there is no pardon. But you are young, and I cannot forget that you
  are the son of one of the most distinguished officers with whom it has been
  my good fortune to be associated. For his sake I am willing to make some
  allowance for you&mdash;on one condition you may retain your commission, and,
  I trust, retrieve this well-nigh fatal mistake in the future. To the crime of
  cowardice yon have added the crime of lying; for that your account of the
  attack upon your half brother and your rescue is a pure fabrication I cannot
  doubt. The peculiar curve in the defile behind trench 4 unfortunately hid you
  from the field of battle and prevents further evidence as to the occurrence
  which, you say, took place. But that your story is false no one can possibly
  doubt. The place has been carefully examined, and there are no dead bodies
  within a hundred yards. It seems, from your appeal to your half-brother, that
  yon expected him to shield you at the expense of his honor. This lie and
  false statement of yours you must retract if you hope for any mercy from
  me."</p>

  <p>There was a convulsive agony in the boy's white, strained face as he drew
  himself up, and looking half piteously, half indignantly at his judge. But
  when he tried to speak he could not, and there was a minute or two's dead
  silence whilst he was struggling to obtain the mastery over himself. All
  expected a confession, and General Luxton removed his eyes from the prisoner,
  and bent close over his papers, that none might read the compassion which was
  in his heart, and which was reflected in his face.</p>

  <p>The words came at last; and shrill and incoherent though they were, there
  was a ring of genuine dignity in them.</p>

  <p>"General Luxton, I have been guilty neither of cowardice nor falsehood. I
  swear before God, on the sword which my father himself put into my hands
  before I left England; by everything that is most holy to me I swear that my
  account of this awful occurrence is true. Ask the men of whom I was in
  command when I caught sight of of him&mdash;" and he pointed with a trembling
  finger and a gesture than which nothing could have been more dramatic to his
  half brother&mdash;"ask them whether I bore myself like a coward when those
  spears were whistling around us, or when we were fighting hand-to-hand after
  the first repulse. God knows that I did not. I left my post to encounter a
  greater danger still. Bitterly do I regret that I ever did so; but it is the
  only indiscretion of which I am guilty. I swear it."</p>

  <p>General Luxton raised his head, and what there had been of compassion in
  his face was either gone or effectually concealed.</p>

  <p>"You have sworn enough already," he said, sternly. "Herbert Devereux, I am
  bitterly disappointed in you. I was willing to spare your father the disgrace
  which I fear will kill him; but you cut away the ground from under my feet.
  You are most certainly proved guilty of gross cowardice in the face of the
  enemy, found guilty, not upon the evidence of one man, but of two, and one of
  those your own relative. Circumstances, too, are strong against you, so are
  the probabilities. Most undeniably and conclusively you are found guilty;
  guilty of cowardice, guilty of falsehood. You will remain under arrest until
  I can find an opportunity of sending an escort with you to the Hekla. Your
  commission is forfeited to the Queen, whose uniform you have disgraced."</p>

  <p>Never a sign, of guilt in the prisoner's countenance. Proudly and
  indignantly he looked his General straight in the face, his cheeks red with a
  flush, which was not of shame, and the wild fury in his heart blazing out of
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is not I who have disgraced the Queen's colors; but he&mdash;he who
  has fabricated and sworn to a false string of lies. Rupert, in your heart
  alone is the knowledge of why you have done this thing. But some day you
  shall tell me&mdash;or die."</p>

  <p>There was something intensely dramatic in the passionate bitterness which
  vibrated in the shrill boyish tone, and, as though moved by a common impulse,
  every one in the tent followed that threatening gesture. But the face of
  Rupert Devereux was little like the face of a guilty man. He looked somewhat
  agitated, and a good deal pained; but although he was the cynosure of all
  eyes, he turned never a shade the paler, nor flinched once from the
  passionate fire which was leaping from the eyes of the young prisoner. He
  seemed as though about to make some reply: but the General raised his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Remove the prisoner."</p>

  <p>There was a sudden, commotion, for, with a deep, despairing groan, and
  arms for a moment lifted high above his head, he had staggered backwards and
  sunk heavily to the ground in a dead swoon. What wonder! He was but a boy
  after all.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Herbert! Why, Herbert! Good God! where did you spring from?
  Are you invalided?"</p>

  <p>The moonlight was streaming in through the high oriel windows of the long
  picture gallery, glittering upon the armor and crossed weapons which hung
  upon the walls, and casting fantastic rays down the polished oak floor.
  Colonel Sir Charles Devereux dropped the cigar which he had been peacefully
  smoking, and brought to a sudden halt his leisurely perambulation of this his
  favorite resort. Before him, with drooping head, with sunken cheeks, and with
  deep black rims under his eyes, stood his son Herbert, who, only a few months
  ago, had departed on his first campaign, a happy, careless young sub. Was it,
  indeed, his son, or was it a ghost that had stolen upon him out of the gloomy
  shadows of the vast gallery?</p>

  <p>"Invalided! Would to God that I was dead!" broke from the boy's quivering
  lips. "Father, I have brought disgrace upon you&mdash;disgrace upon your
  name." And he stretched out his hands towards the long line of pictured
  warriors, who seemed to be frowning down upon him from the wall. "Disgrace
  that you will never forgive, never pardon."</p>

  <p>Like a statue of stone the proud old soldier stood while he listened to
  his son's story. Then, with a half-smothered groan, he deliberately turned
  his back upon him.</p>

  <p>"Father," he pleaded, "listen to me. Before heaven I swear that I am
  innocent. Rupert lied. Why, I don't know, but he lied. I never felt
  fear."</p>

  <p>His father turned half round.</p>

  <p>"You have been put on your defence. General Luxton would never have found
  your father's son guilty of cowardice had there been room for doubt. The
  charge was proved against you in court-martial."</p>

  <p>"But, father, it was because they believed Rupert and his man. The only
  two other men who saw the struggle are dead."</p>

  <p>Colonel Devereux turned away and buried his face in his hands.</p>

  <p>"A Devereux guilty of cowardice!" he groaned. "My God! that it should have
  been my son!"</p>

  <p>Then with a sudden movement he turned round. His son had sunk upon his
  knees before him, and the moon was throwing a ghastly light upon his haggard,
  supplicating face.</p>

  <p>"Out of my sight, and out of my heart for ever, Herbert Devereux!" cried
  his father, his tones vibrating a passionate contempt. "You have brought
  disgrace upon a stainless name. Curse you for it, though you be a thousand
  times my son. You shall not sleep under this roof again. Begone! Change your
  name, I command you! Forget that you are a Devereux, as I most surely shall.
  Turn linen draper, or man-milliner, or lawyer, what you will so that I never
  see or hear from you again. Begone, and curse you."</p>

  <p>Scathing and vibrating with scorn though the words were, they seemed to
  touch a chord in the boy's heart, not of humiliation, but of righteous anger.
  He sprang to his feet, and held himself for a moment as proudly as any of his
  armored ancestors who looked down from the walls upon father and son.</p>

  <p>"I will go, then," he cried, firmly. "It is right that I should go. But,
  after all, it is false to say that I have disgraced your name. It is Rupert
  who has done this."</p>

  <p>He turned and walked steadily away, without a backward glance. Out of the
  swing doors on to the broad staircase, he passed along noble corridors,
  between rows of marble statues, down into the mighty dome-like hall, and out
  of the house which he had loved so well. And the servants, who would have
  pressed forward to welcome him, hung back in fear, for there was that in his
  face which they shrunk from looking upon. Out into the soft summer night, he
  stepped, heedless of their wondering glances, and down the broad avenue he
  hurried, never pausing once to breathe in the balmy night wind, heavy with
  the odor of sweet-smelling flowers, or to listen to the nightingale singing
  in the low copse which bordered the gardens. Through a low iron gate he
  stepped into the park, and walked swiftly along, never glancing to the right
  or to the left at the strange shadows cast by the mighty oak-trees on the
  velvety turf, or at the startled deer, who sprung up on every side of him and
  bounded gracefully away, or at the rabbits who were scampering about all
  around in desperate alarm; once he had loved to watch and to listen to all
  these things; but now he felt only a burning desire to escape from them, and
  to find himself outside the confines of the home which he was leaving for
  ever. And not until he had reached the last paling, and had vaulted into the
  broad, white road, did his strength desert him. Then, faint and weary, and
  heartsick, he sank down in a heap on the roadside, and prayed that he might
  die.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A cloudless summer morning, with the freshness of dawn still
  lingering in the air. A morning which seemed about to herald in one of
  Nature's perfect days, on which to be sad were a crime, and to have troubles
  absurd. Already the dreamy humming of bees was floating in the atmosphere,
  and the lark had given place to noisier, if less musical, songsters. It was a
  glorious morning.</p>

  <p>Over the low, iron gate of an old-fashioned garden a girl was leaning, her
  head resting lightly upon her hand, gazing across the pleasant meadows to the
  dark woods beyond, with a soft, far-away look in her grey eyes&mdash;for she
  was thinking of her lover. She was dressed in a blue print gown, which hung
  in simple folds around her straight, slim figure, and she had carelessly
  passed the long stalk of a full-blown red rose within her waistband. It was a
  very pleasant view that she was admiring; but any casual spectator would have
  declared that she was the most charming object in it.</p>

  <p>And there was a spectator, although not a casual one. Suddenly, like a
  ghost, the figure of her dreams stood before her. Pale, haggard, and
  dishevelled-looking, he seemed to have risen out of the very ground; and it
  was very little to be wondered at that, at first, she shrunk back
  alarmed.</p>

  <p>"Herbert! Herbert! can it really be you?"</p>

  <p>He never answered her; but, as the first surprise began to fade away, she
  moved forward and would have thrown herself into his arms. But he stopped
  her.</p>

  <p>"Keep back, Marian," he cried, hoarsely; "keep away from me! I have come
  to bid you good-bye."</p>

  <p>A swift, sudden fear drove the color from her cheeks, and chilled her
  through and through; but she faltered out an answer.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Herbert! What do you mean? Oh. tell me what has happened,
  quick!"</p>

  <p>"The one thing worse than death, Marian&mdash;disgrace!"</p>

  <p>And then, with his face turned away, and his eyes resting wearily on the
  picturesque landscape, he told her his story.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The last word had left his quivering lips, and he stood as
  though in a dream. The worst was over. He had told his father, and he had
  told her. It seemed like the end of all things to him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a pair of white arms were thrown around his neck, and a great red
  rose was crushed to pieces against his waistcoat.</p>

  <p>"Herbert! oh, Herbert! how dreadful! Don't look like that, you frighten
  me!"</p>

  <p>He was striving to free himself, but she would not let him go.</p>

  <p>"Dearest, you do not understand! This is ruin to me. My father has turned
  me from the house, commanded me to bear another name, disowned me. Be brave,
  Marian, for we must part. I am here only to tell you this, and to bid you
  farewell."</p>

  <p>Still she would not let him go.</p>

  <p>"You will do nothing of the sort, sir. I'll not be thrown over in that
  fashion," she said, struggling to smile through her tears. "And Herbert, oh,
  Herbert! how ill you look! You've been out all night."</p>

  <p>He did not deny it, but again he strove to disengage himself. But she
  would have none of it.</p>

  <p>"Bertie, dearest," she spoke cheerfully, though her eyes were still
  swimming with tears, "you mustn't think that you're going to got rid of us in
  this way. You've just got to come in to breakfast with me, and afterwards
  we'll tell grannie all about it. Come along, sir, I insist."</p>

  <p>He braced himself up for resistance, but ho had still to learn that
  against a woman's love a man's will can prevail nothing. At first he was
  firm, then wavering, and finally he was led in triumph across the smooth lawn
  and along the winding path to the French windows of the morning-room. But
  when he found himself face to face with the kind old lady who had loved him
  as her own son, and saw the tears trickle down her withered, apple-red cheeks
  as she listened to the tale which Marian poured out, he felt that he had
  passed the limits of self-endurance. For more than twenty-four hours he had
  neither eaten nor drunk, and he was sick at heart. Gradually Marian felt the
  arm, which she had drawn tightly through hers, grow heavier and heavier until
  at last as she finished her tale with a little tremulous burst of
  indignation, he sank back in the arm-chair and slowly fainted. But through
  the mist which closed in upon him he saw nothing but kindly pitying faces
  bending over him, and heard Grannie's gentle whisper:</p>

  <p>"I believe you, Herbert," and more emphatic but none the less earnest were
  her words, whose sweet, tear-stained face, so close to his, was the last he
  saw when unconsciousness was closing in upon him.</p>

  <p>"So do I, Bertie. I hate Rupert," and sweeter than the most heart-stirring
  music were the faltering words she added:</p>

  <p>"And I love you better than ever. Oh, Grannie, Grannie, he has
  fainted."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-01"
     id="ch-01"></a>I. &mdash; MY APOLOGY</h2>

  <p class="first">Fortune is the strangest mistress a man ever wooed. Who
  courts her she shuns, who deserves her she passes over, and on him who defies
  her and takes no pains to secure her she lavishes her favors. I am one of
  those to whom she has shown herself most kind. Many years ago I vowed my life
  away to one purpose, and that partly an immoral one. It was a purpose which
  held my life. I swore to seek no end apart from it, and I put away from any
  thoughts all joys that were not included in its accomplishment. And yet,
  having kept my oath, I still possess in the prime of life everything which a
  man could wish for. I am rich, and well thought of amongst my fellows. I am
  married to the woman whom I love, and life is flowing on with me as calmly
  and peacefully as the murmuring waters of a woodland stream in the middle of
  summer. And, above all, my heart is at ease, for I have kept my vow.</p>

  <p>She is a strange mistress, indeed! Nothing have I sought or deserved of
  her, yet everything I have. Whilst he who was far above me in his deservings,
  and whose sufferings none save myself thoroughly understood, passed through a
  gloomy life, buffeted by every wind, stranded by every tide of fortune;
  misunderstood, wronged, falsely accused, and narrowly escaped remaining in
  men's minds only as a prototype of a passionate, unforgiving, Quixotic
  man.</p>

  <p>That the world may know him as he was, and form a better judgment as to
  his character, I have gathered together the threads of my life indissolubly
  connected with his, and have turned them inside out. I have never indulged
  myself with the feminine luxury of a diary, but with a surer progress than of
  pen over paper has the record of my strange life been written into my mind;
  and so I tell it just as it all comes back to me, not as a professed
  story-teller, with harmonious dates and regular evolution of plot, and neatly
  paged chapters, but in a bolder way, leaving much lo be guessed at, and some
  things untold. If there be any of whom I have occasion to speak still amongst
  the living (my life has so contracted of late that many have passed out of
  its horizon), let them remember for what purpose I write, and for his sake
  forbear to complain. If the sword were the pen, then would mine be the pen of
  a ready writer, and I might be able to touch lightly on their shortcomings,
  and gild over the black spots on my own life. But enough of excuses. I take
  up my pen a blunt Englishman, an athlete rather than a scholar, to write a
  plain story which shall serve not as a eulogy, but as a justification of the
  man to whom many years of my life have been ungrudgingly given. Let all those
  who may feel disposed to cavil at the disconnectedness of any loosely jointed
  story, remember this, and be silent.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-02"
     id="ch-02"></a>II. &mdash; THE FIRST CLOUD</h2>

  <p class="first">About a mile seaward from Porlock, separated from it by a
  narrow strip of the most luxuriant meadowlands in Devonshire, lies the
  village of Bossington. Perhaps it were better called a hamlet, for at the
  time when I knew anything about it (which, let the tourist remember, is many
  years ago) it consisted but of six or seven cottages, a farmhouse, and a
  half-ruined old manor house, for the privilege of living in which my father
  paid ten pounds a year, or some such trifling sum, to the neighboring
  clergyman whose property it was.</p>

  <p>But what the place lacked in size was certainly atoned for&mdash;and more
  than atoned for&mdash;by the beauty of its situation. High above it, like a
  mighty protecting giant, rose Bossington Headband, covered always with a
  soft, springy turf, and glowing in midsummer with the brilliant coloring of
  rich purple heather and yellow gorse. Often have I stood on its highest
  point, and with my head bared to the strong fresh breeze, watched the sun
  rise over the Dartmoor Hills and Dunkerry Beacon, and waited until it shed
  its first warm gleams on the white cottages and queer old church-tower of
  Portlock, which lay clustered together in picturesque irregularity at the
  head of the little bay. And almost as often have I gazed upon the same scene
  from the same spot by the less distinct but more harmonious light of the full
  harvest moon, and have wondered in which guise it seemed the fairest.</p>

  <p>Behind Bossington lay Allercombe Woods, great tree-covered hills sloping
  on one side down to the road which connected, and still connects, Porlock
  with Minehead and the outside world, and on the other, descending
  precipitously to the sea; so precipitously indeed that it seemed always a
  wonder to me how the thickly growing but stunted fir trees could preserve
  their shape and regularity. The descent, from Bossington Headland into
  Porlock was by a steep winding path through Allercombe Woods, and many a time
  I have looked through the thin coating of green leaves upon the fields which
  stretched like a piece of patchwork below down to the sea, and wondered
  whether any other country in the world (I had never been out of Devonshire
  then) could be more beautiful than this.</p>

  <p>Within a stone's throw of where the blue sea of our English Bay of Naples
  rippled in on to the firm while sands, was the tumbledown old building in
  which we lived. What there had been of walls had long before our time been
  hidden by climbing plants and ivy, and in summer-time the place from a
  distance somewhat resembled a gigantic nosegay of cottage roses, jessamine,
  and other creeping flowers. There was but a small garden and no ground, for
  Bossington Headland rose precipitously close to the back of the house, and in
  front there was no space for any. A shed served as a stable for one or two
  Exmoor ponies, and also as a sleeping place for the lanky, raw-boned
  Devonshire lad whom we kept to look after them.</p>

  <p>There were but few habitable rooms in our mansion, but they were
  sufficient, for our household was a small one. My father, mother, sister,
  myself, and a country servant comprised it. We never had a visitor, save
  occasionally the clergyman from Porlock. We never went anywhere. We knew no
  one, and at seventeen years of age an idea which had been developed in me for
  a long time, took to itself the tangible shape of words.</p>

  <p>"Father," I said to him one evening when we were sitting out upon our
  little strip of lawn together, he smoking, I envying him for being able to
  smoke, "do you know that I have never been out of Devonshire&mdash;never been
  further than Exeter even, and I am seventeen years old?"</p>

  <p>It was long before he answered me, and when, at last, he turned round and
  did so, I was distressed to see the look of deep anxiety in his worn,
  handsome face, and the troubled light in his clear eyes.</p>

  <p>"I know it, my boy," he said, pityingly. "I have been expecting this. You
  are weary of the country."</p>

  <p>I stood up, with my hands in my pockets, and my back against the latticed
  wall of the house, gazing over the sparkling, dancing sea, to where, on the
  horizon, the stars seem to stoop and meet it. Was I tired of this quiet home?
  I scarcely knew; country sports and country sights were dear to me, and I had
  no desire to leave them for ever. I thought of the fat trout in the Exford
  streams, and the huntsman's rallying call from "t'other side Dunkerry," and
  the wild birds that needed so much getting at and such quick firing, and of
  the deep sea fishing, and the shooting up the coombs from Farmer Pulsford's
  boat, and of the delight of stripping on a hot summer's day and diving deep
  down into the cool bracing water. Why should I wish to leave all this? What
  should I be likely to find pleasanter in the world of which, as yet, I know
  nothing? For a moment or two I hesitated&mdash;but it was only for a moment
  or two. The restlessness which had been growing up within me for years was
  built upon a solid foundation, and would not be silenced.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not tired of the country, father," I answered, slowly. "I love it
  too much ever to be tired of it. But men don't generally live all their lives
  in one place, do they, without having any work or anything to do except enjoy
  themselves?"</p>

  <p>"And what should you like to be?" my father asked, quickly.</p>

  <p>I had long ago made up my mind upon that point, and was not slow to
  answer.</p>

  <p>"I should like to be a soldier," I declared, emphatically.</p>

  <p>I was very little prepared for the result of my words. A spasm of what
  seemed to be the most acute pain passed across my father's face, and he
  covered it for a moment with his hands. When he withdrew them he looked like
  a ghost, deathly pale in the golden moonlight, and when he spoke his voice
  trembled with, emotion.</p>

  <p>"God forbid that you should wish it seriously!" he said, "for it is the
  one thing which you can never be."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Hugh, you do not mean it really; you do not wish to go away from
  us!"</p>

  <p>I turned round, for the voice, a soft and gentle one, was my mother's. She
  was standing in the open window; with a fleecy white shawl around her head,
  and her eyes, the sweetest I ever saw, fixed appealingly upon me, I glanced
  from one to the other blankly, for my disappointment was great.</p>

  <p>Then, like a flash, a sudden conviction, laid hold of me. There was some
  great and mysterious reason why we had lived so long apart from the
  world.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>III. &mdash; THE BOY MUST BE TOLD</h2>

  <p class="first">That was quite an eventful night in our quiet life. Whilst
  we three stood looking at one another half fearfully&mdash;I full of this
  strange, new idea which had just occurred to me&mdash;we heard the latch of
  our garden gate lifted, and Mr. Cox, the vicar of Porlock and my instructor
  in the classics, followed by no fewer than four large-limbed, broad
  shouldered, Porlock men, entered.</p>

  <p>They made their way up the steep garden path, and my father, in no little
  surprise, rose to greet them. With Mr. Cox he shook hands and then glanced
  inquiringly at his followers, who, after touching their hats respectfully,
  stood in a row looking supremely uncomfortable, and each betraying a strong
  disposition to retire a little behind the others. Mr. Cox proceeded to
  explain matters.</p>

  <p>"You are pleased to look upon us as a deputation." he said, pleasantly,
  waving his hand towards the others, "of which I am the spokesman. We come
  from the Porlock Working Men's Conservative Club."</p>

  <p>My father bowed, and bidding me bring forward a garden seat, requested the
  deputation to be seated. Then he called into the house for Jane to bring out
  some jugs of cider and glasses, and a decided smile appeared on the somewhat
  wooden faces of the deputation. I was vastly interested, and not a little
  curious.</p>

  <p>When the cider had been brought and distributed, and a raid made upon the
  tobacco jar, Mr. Cox proceeded with his explanation.</p>

  <p>"We have come to ask you a favor, Mr. Arbuthnot," he said. "We are going
  to hold a political meeting in the schoolroom at Porlock next week. A
  gentleman from Minehead is going to give us an address on the land question
  which promises to be very interesting, and Mr. Bowles here has kindly
  promised to say a few words."</p>

  <p>The end man on the seat here twirled his hat, and, being nudged by his
  neighbor, betrayed his personality by a broad grin. Finally, to relieve his
  modesty, he buried his face in the mug of cider that stood by his side.</p>

  <p>"The difficulty we are in is this," continued Mr. Cox; "we want a
  chairman. I have most unfortunately promised to be in Exeter on that day and
  shall not be able to return in time for the meeting, or else we would not
  have troubled you. But as I shall not be available, we thought that perhaps
  you might be induced to accept the office. That is what we have come to ask
  you."</p>

  <p>My father shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is very kind of you to think of me," he said, hesitatingly, "but I
  fear that I must decline your offer. Politics have lost most of their
  interest for me&mdash;and&mdash;and, in short, I think I would rather
  not."</p>

  <p>"I hope you will reconsider that," Mr. Cox said pleasantly, "It will be a
  very slight tax upon you after all. You need only say a very few words. Come,
  think it over again. We really are at our wit's end or we would not have
  troubled you."</p>

  <p>"There is Mr. Sothern," my father protested.</p>

  <p>"He is in bed ill. An attack of pleurisy, I think."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brown, then?"</p>

  <p>"A rank Radical."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Jephcote?"</p>

  <p>"Away."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hetton?"</p>

  <p>"Gene to London for a week."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Smith, then?"</p>

  <p>"Will be at Exeter cattle fair."</p>

  <p>My father was silent for a moment or two. Then he suggested some more
  names, to each of which there was some objection.</p>

  <p>"You do seem to have been unfortunate," he declared, at last. "To tell you
  the truth, Mr. Cox," he added, thoughtfully, "I scarcely know what to say. I
  had made up my mind, for certain private reasons, never to have anything to
  do with public life in any shape or form."</p>

  <p>"This isn't a very formidable undertaking, is it?" Mr. Cox urged,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"It isn't. But the principle is the same," my father answered. "However,
  leave it in this way, if you like. Give me until tomorrow evening to think
  the matter over, and in the meantime see if you can't find some one else. I'm
  afraid I can't say more than that."</p>

  <p>The deputation thought that nothing could be fairer than this, and nothing
  more satisfactory except an unqualified assent. I think my father imagined
  that having promised so much they would take their departure. But nothing of
  the sort happened. Perhaps they found the cider too good, or perhaps they
  were tired after their day's work and the walk from Porlock. At any rate,
  there they sat for more than an hour, taking occasional gulps at their cider,
  and puffing incessantly at their blackened pipes with a stolid vacuous look
  on their honest faces, whilst my father and Mr. Cox talked a little aside in
  a low tone. I fancied that I was the subject of their conversation, but
  though I strained my ears in the attempt to catch some part of it, I was
  unsuccessful. Once or twice the sound of my name reached me, but directly I
  leaned forward they dropped their voices, so that I could hear no more. I
  have always believed, however, that my father was asking advice from Mr. Cox
  concerning me, and that Mr. Cox was urging him to send me to the University.
  But I never knew for certain, for events were soon to occur which swept out
  of my mind all minor curiosity.</p>

  <p>At last Mr. Cox rose to go, and the deputation, with manifest reluctance,
  did the same. My father courteously accompanied them to the garden gate, and
  shook hands with them all, thanking them for their visit. When he returned
  there was a slight sparkle in his eyes, and an amused smile on his lips. So
  monotonous was our life, that even such an event as this was welcome, and I
  could tell from his manner that he was pleased at the request which had been
  made to him, and disposed to accept it. I determined to encourage him in
  it.</p>

  <p>"Governor," I remarked, leaning over the wall and watching the retreating
  forms of our visitors, "I hope we're not going to have many political
  deputations here, especially if they're all going to be as thirsty as this
  one was. Did you ever see such fellows for cider! We shan't have a drop left
  for the hot weather if you encourage this sort of thing. But you'll do what
  they want you to, won't you? I should! It'll be capital fun, and I'm sure
  you'd make a rattling speech. You're up on the land question, too. I heard
  you giving it to Old Simpson the other morning."</p>

  <p>My father smiled, and stood by my side watching them make their way down
  the coombe.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to consult your mother about it," he said. "I almost think
  that I may venture it," he added, in a lower tone and thoughtfully, as though
  to himself.</p>

  <p>"Venture it! What could there be adventurous in it," I wondered, "to a
  well-read, scholarly man such as I knew him to be!"</p>

  <p>But I did not dare to ask.</p>

  <p>Presently he turned to me with a much graver look in his face.</p>

  <p>"Hugh!" he said, "these people interrupted our conversation. There is
  something which I must say to you at once. I do not wish you to become a
  soldier. When you feel that you can stay here no longer, and that this
  country life is too quiet for you, you must choose some other profession. But
  a soldier you can never be."</p>

  <p>I was bitterly disappointed, and not a little curious, and an idea which
  had often occurred to me swept suddenly into my mind with renewed
  strength.</p>

  <p>"Father, may I ask you a question?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated, but did not forbid me.</p>

  <p>"I have heard it said down in the village-every one says that you must
  once have been a soldier. You walk and hold your head like one,
  and&mdash;father, what is the matter?" I broke off all at once, for his face
  had become like a dead man's, and he had sunk heavily on to the seat.</p>

  <p>I would have sprung to his side, but my mother was there before me. She
  had passed one arm around his neck, and with the other she motioned me to go
  into the house.</p>

  <p>"It isn't your fault, Hugh," she said, "but you mustn't ask your father
  questions; they distress him. Leave us now."</p>

  <p>I turned heavily away, and went upstairs to my room. About an hour
  afterwards, when I pushed open my window before getting into bed, there stole
  into my room together with the sweet scent of jessamine and climbing roses
  the sound of subdued voices.</p>

  <p>"He must be told," I heard my father say solemnly. "God give me
  strength."</p>

  <p>Then the voices ceased for a while, but I still lingered, and presently
  they began again, but in a more cheerful key.</p>

  <p>I moved away and got into bed, but I left the window open as I always did,
  and some fragments of their conversation still reached me.</p>

  <p>"I am sure that you need have no fear, Herbert. No one in these parts can
  have the slightest idea of ... I hope you will ... It will be a change ...
  Now promise."</p>

  <p>I could hear nothing of my father's reply, but from its tone he seemed
  reluctant, though wishful. Then the voices dropped again, and I think that I
  must have dozed for some time. But suddenly I awoke and sat up in bed
  startled, for my father's voice was ringing in through the window.</p>

  <p>"You are right, Marian; you are right. I will do my duty. The boy must be
  told. The time has come when I must dig up any trouble again. The boy must be
  told."</p>

  <p>Then I heard them enter the house (leaving the door wide open, as was our
  common practice), and come up to their rooms. Afterwards there was silence,
  but there was no more sleep for me that night.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>IV. &mdash; A MYSTERIOUS MEETING</h2>

  <p class="first">On the morrow my father, not a little to my surprise,
  appeared to be in a particularly cheerful frame of mind. At breakfast time he
  remarked that the day looked well for fishing, and asked me whether I would
  not like to go. Of course I consented willingly, and William, our man, or
  rather boy of all work, was sent down to Mr. Cox, with whom I used generally
  to read in the morning, with my father's, compliments and my excuses.</p>

  <p>What sport we had all day long! We waded knee deep, sometimes waist high,
  down the Badgeworthy stream, following its gleaming course past Loma's tower,
  past waterslide, which I never looked upon without thinking of John Ridd's
  description, and round the green hills of the Doone, valley as far as the
  bend of the stream.</p>

  <p>It was a long ride home, and across a desolate country. I think that I
  should have gone to sleep in the saddle I was so tired, but for the stern
  necessity of picking our way carefully along what was nothing better than a
  sheep walk. I remember that night ride well.</p>

  <p>Suddenly my father pulled his pony almost on its haunches, and
  instinctively William and I did the same.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" he cried.</p>

  <p>I bent down and listened intently.</p>

  <p>"I hear nothing," I remarked, gathering up my reins, for I was desperately
  hungry and cold.</p>

  <p>My father held up his hand to bid me stay and then turning towards the
  inland stretch of moor shouted, "Hulloa there! Hulloa! Hulloa!" We listened,
  and, to my surprise, we heard almost immediately an answering shout, faint,
  and evidently a long way off, but distinctly a man's hail.</p>

  <p>It was scarcely safe to leave the track, so we stopped where we were, and
  all three shouted. And, sure enough, in less than five minutes we heard the
  sound of galloping hoofs, and a tall, stately-looking man came riding out of
  the mist mounted on a fine bay horse which seemed to have been up to its
  girths, in a morass, and which was trembling in every limb.</p>

  <p>"I'm uncommonly glad to see you, gentlemen, whoever you are," he
  exclaimed, riding up to us. "For close upon three hours have I been trying to
  come upon a path, or a road, or a track, or something that led somewhere, and
  have only succeeded in losing myself more completely. Curse these mists! How
  far am I from Luccombe Hall?"</p>

  <p>To my surprise my father made no answer, and when I looked towards him he
  was sitting bolt upright in his saddle, with his eyes riveted upon the
  stranger. So I answered his question.</p>

  <p>"If you mean Sir Frederick Lawson's place, it's about nine miles off. We
  are going that way."</p>

  <p>The stranger thanked me heartily, and moved his horse to the side of mine.
  And then happened the strangest thing which I had ever seen. My father, who
  was the most courteous and gentlest mannered man I ever came near, rose
  suddenly in his stirrups, and, without a word, struck the stranger full in
  the mouth with the back of his hand.</p>

  <p>It seemed for a moment as though he must fall from his horse; but by a
  great effort he recovered himself, and, with the blood streaming from his
  mouth, grasped his riding whip and dug spurs into his horse as though to
  spring at my father. What followed was the strangest part of all. Although
  his assailant was within a yard of him, with his heavy riding whip lifted
  high in the air to strike, my father never moved a muscle, but simply sat
  still as a statue upon his pony. But at the last moment, when the whip was
  quivering in the air, he quietly raised his hand and lifted his hat from his
  head. There he sat motionless, with the faint moon which had just struggled
  out from a bank of clouds shining on his handsome, delicate face, and with
  his clear, firm eyes fixed steadily upon the stranger. Like a tableaux
  vivant, burnt into my memory, I shall carry that scene with me until I
  die.</p>

  <p>The moment my father removed his hat his would-be assailant evidently
  recognised him. His whip dropped heavily to the ground, and into his ghastly
  face there leaped such an expression of horrified surprise as my pen could
  never dissect and set down in words.</p>

  <p>"My God! Herbert! Is this possible!"</p>

  <p>"Keep back, keep away from me," muttered my father, in a low, suppressed
  tone, as though he were striving to control some violent passion. "Keep out
  of my reach lest I do you a mischief. Thank God, we are not alone. Speak!
  What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>The fierce restraint which he seemed to be putting upon his words made
  them come forth slowly with a monotonous sing-song which sounded more
  terrible than the wildest outburst. I was shivering all over with dread of
  what might come of this.</p>

  <p>The stranger answered hoarsely, and I could tell that he, too, had felt
  the peculiar affect of my father's strange tone.</p>

  <p>"I am staying with Sir Frederick Lawson at Luccombe Hall for a few days
  only. I had no&mdash;"</p>

  <p>My father raised his hand.</p>

  <p>"Swear on what remains of your honor-swear by anything that is dearest to
  you-that you do not seek to discover my dwelling-place, or the name under
  which I choose to live. Swear that you never mention this meeting to living
  man or woman."</p>

  <p>The stranger raised his hat.</p>

  <p>"I swear," he said.</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence for a full minute. Then my father gathered up his
  reins, and motioned us to ride on.</p>

  <p>"You are fortunate as ever, Rupert Devereux," were his last words, as he
  turned to follow us, "for, sure as there is a God above us if I had met you
  here alone to-night, nay, if any other had been with me than my son, I should
  have killed you."</p>

  <p>We rode home almost in silence, and, though I listened often, I never once
  heard the sound of horse's hoofs behind us. Whoever this man might be whom we
  had so strangely met, he evidently preferred to risk losing his way again,
  rather than chance another meeting with us.</p>

  <p>As we walked our ponies down Porlock Hill, and came in sight of Bossington
  headland, standing gloomily out into the sea, my father called William to
  him.</p>

  <p>"William," he said shortly, "I desire that you keep strictly to yourself
  what happened to us just now. If I hear of your mentioning so much as a word
  of it, you will leave my service at once."</p>

  <p>William touched his hat awkwardly, but sincerely.</p>

  <p>"There bean't no fear of me, maester," he answered. "I bean't no gossip, I
  bean't, and I never zeed no zense in talkin' 'bout other folks' avvairs;
  zepecially yer betters. I'll no mention that ther'er chap to no one."</p>

  <p>My father nodded, and not another word was spoken until we had passed
  through Porlock and our ponies had freshened up into the home canter. Then he
  leaned over and spoke to me.</p>

  <p>"I need say nothing to you, my boy; you know your mother must hear about
  this from me, and from me only."</p>

  <p>"I promise, father," I answered simply, having hard work to keep my voice
  from trembling, for I was still excited and uneasy; and something made me
  suddenly hold my hand out to him as a pledge of my silence. Many a time since
  I have been glad that I did so, for he seemed to take it kindly.</p>

  <p>"God bless you, my boy!" he said, and I could almost have fancied that
  there were tears in his eyes.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-05"
     id="ch-05"></a>V. &mdash; ON BOSSINGTON HEADLAND</h2>

  <p class="first">A very demon of unrest laid hold of me that might. I ought
  to have been sleepy, for we had had a long fatiguing day in the open air,
  but, as a matter of fact, I was nothing of the sort. I have always been a
  rigid materialist, but never since that night have I been without some faint
  belief in that branch of superstition known as presentiments.</p>

  <p>I had led a strange life for a boy of my age. I had never been to school,
  and I had no companions of my own station save my father. As regards my
  education, that had been entrusted to Mr. Cox, our nearest clergyman. He did
  his best with me, poor man; but he must have found it terrible work, for I
  was anything but brilliant. There was another part of my education, the part
  undertaken by my father in which I was not so backward, and, with all due
  respect to the classics, I found it of infinitely more use to me in my after
  life. I could ride, fish, shoot, fence, box, or row as well as most men, and,
  though I was slight, I was tall and strong, as who would not have been,
  leading the healthy life which we did?</p>

  <p>It had never troubled me that I had no friends of my own age. Indeed, I
  never had need of any, for when I had finished for the day with Mr. Cox, or
  on holidays&mdash;which came not unfrequently&mdash;my father was always
  ready to do any thing I desired; and what better companion could I have had?
  He was a better shot and a far better fencer than I, and, at a distance, no
  one would have taken him for more than my elder brother. He was over six feet
  in height, and as slim and upright as a dart. His slight moustaches and hair
  were, indeed grey, but they were the only signs of age, save, perhaps, a
  weary, troubled look which sometimes came into his face and dwelt there for
  days. But a good hand-gallop or an hour or two shooting from a boat round the
  coombe, used generally to drive that away; and then his blue eyes would flash
  as eagerly and his interest in the sport would be as strong as ever mine was.
  But, though we were out in all weathers, sometimes for the whole day
  together, it seemed as though neither sun nor wind could do more than very
  slightly tan his clear, delicate skin; and his hands, although they were as
  tenacious and strong as a bargeman's, remained almost as white and shapely as
  a lady's. I used to think him the handsomest man in the world, and I have
  certainly never seen a handsomer. To be told that I was growing like him was
  to make me supremely happy&mdash;and people often told me so in those
  days.</p>

  <p>No wonder that I grew to love him with more even than an ordinary filial
  love. The ties between us were so various, that it would have been strange
  had it not been so. To the love of a son for his father was added the love
  which springs from constant companionship whilst engaged with kindred tastes
  in following a common object. My mother, too, claimed a large share of my
  affection, and so did Marian, my sister. But neither of them came any where
  near him in my heart.</p>

  <p>I was not of a speculative nature, but gradually it had begun to dawn upon
  me that we were somehow different from other people&mdash;that there must be
  some reason for the absolute and unbroken solitude in which we lived, and the
  events of the last two days had now made this certain. "The boy must be
  told." What was it that I must be told? I had thought that I should have
  known this very evening, for just as I was going to bed my father had called
  me to him.</p>

  <p>"Hugh," he had said kindly, "you were saying something last night about
  never having been away from this place. You were quite right. You must not
  live here always. There has been a reason, a very grave reason, for our
  having lived here so long and in such solitude. You must be told that
  reason."</p>

  <p>I could see that he was agitated, and a vague yet strong sense of trouble
  filled me.</p>

  <p>"Do not tell me now, father," I cried, "do not tell me at all if it
  distresses you. I will ask no more questions. I will be content to live on
  here always as we are doing now."</p>

  <p>He shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"No, Hugh, my boy, you must be told. It is my duty to tell you. But not
  to-night. I have gone through enough to-day," and he sighed.</p>

  <p>I thought of the terrible scene on the moor, of my father's wild words and
  passionate action, and I asked him no questions. But when I left him for the
  night and went to bed, there was in my heart a strong sense of some
  approaching trouble. I tossed about from side to side in my bed till sleep
  became hopeless. Then I rose, and, hastily putting on my clothes, slipped out
  of the house.</p>

  <p>Even outside I found it warm and oppressive. The sky was black with
  clouds, and without the moon's softening light the sea looked sullen and
  uninviting. The air seemed heavy, and, even when I stood on the headland
  after half an hour's climbing, there was no cool breeze to reward me, and,
  although I had thought myself hard and in good condition, the perspiration
  came streaming from every pore in my body, and I found myself panting for
  breath.</p>

  <p>I stood upright, and tried to look around me, but everything was wrapped
  in a thick pall of darkness. I had never known so dark a night, and after
  standing there for a moment or two, I grew afraid to move lest I should make
  a false step. To the right of me I could hear the wind moaning amongst the
  pine trees of Allercombe Wood, which the slightest breeze, when in a certain
  direction, always seemed to cause, and, many hundred feet below, there was
  the roar of the sea, unusually loud for such a quiet night, as it swept round
  the sharp corners of the headland.</p>

  <p>Never had I stood there before on such a night, or with such a heavy
  heart. I wished that I had not come, and yet I was afraid to go. The darkness
  had closed in upon me till I could almost feel it, and knowing that a single
  step in the wrong direction might cost me my life, I dared not move. Suddenly
  the heaviness of the atmosphere was explained. The sky above me seemed to be
  rent aside to let out a great blare of vivid light which flashed, glittering
  and fiercely brilliant, right across the arc of the heavens, sinking at last
  into the horizon of the sea, which it showed me for a moment with a lurid
  light, green and disturbed. Almost on its heels came the thunder, and I
  trembled as I listened. It seemed as if the hills were one by one splitting
  open with a great crash all around me, and the ground on which I stood shook.
  Again the lightning was scattered all over the inky sky, giving me ghastly
  peeps at sections of the patchworky landscape below, and once it flashed down
  the conductor of Porlock steeple, snowing, me the little town as distinctly
  as I had ever seen it. A gale sprung up with marvellous suddenness; the
  moaning of the pine trees became an angry shrieking, and the roar of the sea
  far away below, became a deafening thunder. Black clouds and grey mists came
  rolling along, sometimes enveloping me, and sometimes passing so close above
  my head that I could feel their moisture, and, by stretching out my hand,
  could almost have touched them. Every how and then above the storm I could
  hear the piteous bleating of the mountain sheep, as they rushed frantically
  about seeking in vain for shelter which the bare hill-side could not afford
  them. For the rain was coming down in sheets, blinding, driving, sheets and
  already the swollen mountain streams were making themselves heard above all
  the din, as they swept down into Porlock valley.</p>

  <p>Before the storm had even commenced to die away I had thrown myself face
  downwards on the wet grass, and was praying. A strange idea had flashed into
  my mind, and had suddenly become a conviction. This storm had somehow
  associated itself in my mind with the sudden sense of gloomy depression which
  had laid hold of me, and driven me out into the black night. As one ended, so
  would the troubles which the other foretold. It was a strange idea, but it
  was stranger still what a mastery it gained over me. I dared not look up lest
  I should still see a threatening sky and an angry sea. If such had been the
  case, I am convinced that I should have been strongly tempted to have thrown
  myself from the cliffs into the arms of certain death. But when at last I
  summoned up courage to rise, and gaze fearfully around, it was a very
  different sight upon which my eyes dwelt. So strangely different that at
  first it seemed almost as though the hideous storm which, had been raging so
  short a while ago must surely have been a wild nightmare. The dark line of
  the Dartmoor hills was betopped with rosy-colored clouds, and the sun was
  shining down from a clear sky, gilding and transforming the whole landscape
  like some great magician. The white cottages of Porlock seemed basking in its
  pleasant warmth, whilst the fields between it and the sea seemed to be
  stretching themselves out smiling and refreshed. Here and there scattered
  about amongst them, and on the white sands, were long sparkling streaks of
  silver, which bore witness of the violence of the rainfall; and the tops of
  the pine trees seemed encrusted with a mass of diamonds; but strangest of all
  seemed the altered aspect of the sea. It stretched away below me like a great
  lake, with only the gentlest ripple disturbing its placid surface, a mighty
  playground for myriads of sparkling sunbeams. Never had I seen the hills so
  green or the sea such on exquisite deep, clear blue. Everything seemed to
  speak of peace and calm and happiness after suffering. It struck an answering
  chord in my heart, and I could have cried out with joy. The hideous
  depression seemed rolled away from' me, and I could breathe freely again. My
  spirits leaped up within me, and I threw my hat into the air and shouted for
  joy till Allercombe Wood rang with the echoes! Then I turned away and strode
  down the narrow, winding path, suddenly conscious that I was stiff and wet
  and tired. If I had known then when and how I should next stand on Bossington
  Point, should I ever have come down? I cannot tell.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-06"
     id="ch-06"></a>VI. --AN INTERRUPTED ADDRESS</h2>

  <p class="first">Imagine a long, bare-looking apartment with white-washed
  walls and generally cheerless appearance, in one corner of which had been
  pushed aside black boards, piles of maps, and other evidences of the
  school-room. Scatted on benches which reached to the entrance door was a very
  fair sprinkling of the Porlock laborers and tradespeople, whose healthy red
  faces were shining with soap and expectation, and whose whole appearance
  denoted a lively and creditable desire to be enlightened on the very
  Important subject which they had come to hear discussed. If any one was
  interested in the land question surely they were, for they all lived either
  upon it or by it, except a few whose nautical garb betrayed another
  occupation, and whose presence was the subject of a great deal of
  good-humored chaff before the proceedings opened.</p>

  <p>"Eh, Bill," cried one of the land toilers whom I knew well, for he worked
  at Farmer Smith's up at Bossington, "what dost want know about t'land, eh?
  This'll noa teach thee to catch fishes."</p>

  <p>"Never thee moind aboot that, Joe," was the good-humored answer, "we want
  noabody to teach us to catch fish, we' don't. I ha' come t' hear what the
  bloke from Minehead's got to zay 'bout you poor de'ils o' landsmen just out
  o' curiosity like."</p>

  <p>"Coom, Bill, I like that," returned the first speaker. "Poor de'ils,
  indeed! Bean't we as well off as you vishers, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Noa, of course you bean't. How can yer be when every voot of land yer
  tread on belongs to your maesters? Why, we can go sailing away vor days on
  the zea, lads, and we've as much right the'er as any voine gentleman in his
  steam yacht. T' zea belongs to us, zall, yer zee, and we as goes vishing ha'
  got as much roight the'er as any one. I reckon we've got the best o' you
  landsmen there, eh, Bill. Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>To my deep regret this interesting discussion was here brought to a sudden
  termination by the appearance of my father, the lecturer, and the committee
  upon the platform. Instantly there was a deep silence, for country audiences,
  in that respect, are far better bred than town ones, in the midst of which my
  father, in a few kindly, well-chosen words, introduced the lecturer to
  them.</p>

  <p>When he resumed his chair there was a burst of applause (Devonshire men
  are generous with their hands and feet), at the conclusion of which the
  lecturer, a retired linen draper from Minehead, stepped forward. Of course
  his doing so was the signal for another little round of cheering, during
  which he stood rustling his papers about, edging down his cuffs, and making
  desperate efforts to appear at his ease, which he most certainly was not. At
  last he made a start, and in less than five minutes I found myself devoutly
  wishing that he would look sharp and finish, The land question may be an
  immensely interesting one&mdash;no doubt it is; but when it consists in
  having long strings of depressing statistics hurled mercilessly at you by a
  nervous little ex-vendor of calico, who made a point of dropping his h's, you
  can very soon have enough of it. Before long I saw my father politely stifle
  a yawn&mdash;a piece of delicacy which I, not being upon the platform, did
  not think it necessary to imitate. The audience behaved admirably. The
  painful efforts written on the faces of most of them to appear intelligently
  interested were quite affecting, and at exactly the proper moments they never
  failed to bring in a little encouraging applause. I'm quite sure there wasn't
  one of them who understood a word of what the man was saying, but they were
  evidently charitably inclined to put this down to their own stupidity rather
  than to the incompetence of the lecturer.</p>

  <p>He had been droning on for about half an hour, when a slight commotion
  caused by the noisy entrance of some late-comers led me to turn my head.
  Instantly my spirits rose, for I foresaw a row. The new-comers were all
  Luccombe men, and between the men of Luccombe and the men of Porlock there
  existed, a deadly enmity. They were rivals in sport and also in politics, for
  whilst Luccombe boasted a Radical club, Porlock was distinctively
  Conservative. The arrival of these Luccombites, therefore, was most
  promising, for they certainly had not come out of compliment to their
  neighbors, and I took an early opportunity of changing my seat for one nearer
  the back of the room, so as to be in the fun in case there should be any.</p>

  <p>It certainly seemed as though something would come of it. There were
  several strangers among the new-comers, and one of them in particular
  attracted my attention. He was a big, white-faced man, with continually
  blinking eyes and stupid, vacuous face, and every now and then he gave vent
  to his feelings by a prolonged animal cry which afforded the most exquisite
  amusement to his companions, and never failed to produce the utmost
  consternation in the lecturer's startled face. I don't know why it was so,
  but I took a violent dislike to that man the moment I saw him. He was so
  ugly, so like an animal, besides which, he was evidently half drunk. He
  seemed of a different species altogether to the broad-shouldered,
  ruddy-faced, good-humored Devonshire men by whom he was surrounded, and a
  very inferior species, too.</p>

  <p>After a while my attention was distracted from him to the other
  Luccombites, who were evidently bent upon breaking up the meeting. The
  lecturer was by no means the sort of man to defy the uproar, and insist upon
  finishing what he had to say. After a very mild protest, the meekness of'
  which caused a howl of derision from the peace-breakers, he brought his
  lecture to an abrupt close and sat down.</p>

  <p>Then my father rose, and spoke a few stern, reproving words which had an
  infinitely better effect. But I was too occupied in watching the
  extraordinary behavior of the white-faced man from Luccombe to listen to
  them. He had half risen to his feet, and was leaning over the back of one of
  the benches with his eyes and mouth wide open, staring with a stupidly
  bewildered look at my father. Suddenly he turned round to his companions.</p>

  <p>"Say, lads, should you like to see me shut that joker up?"</p>

  <p>I felt hot with indignation, but I kept still.</p>

  <p>"Ay, Jack, or Thomas, or whatever your name is," answered one of the
  Luccombites, "give him a cock-a-doodle-do."</p>

  <p>The man smiled, an ugly, sickly smile.</p>

  <p>"I'll do better nor that," he muttered. "Listen, you 'ere," and, leaning
  forward, he shouted out one word at the top of his voice&mdash;"Yah!
  coward!"</p>

  <p>I saw my father reel backwards as though he were shot, and the word he was
  uttering died away upon his lips. For a moment I hesitated whether to rush to
  him or at the man who had yelled out that word. But one glance at his ugly,
  triumphant face decided me. With two rapid strides I was across the room, and
  my hand was on his collar.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" I snouted, "come along!"</p>

  <p>He turned his fishy eyes up at me in amazement.</p>

  <p>"What d'ye want? What d'ye mean?" he called out. "Let me go, you young
  cub, you! You're choking me."</p>

  <p>"I'll do worse than choke you before I've done," I cried passionately.
  "Come outside and fight, you great beast," and I dragged him half across the
  floor, for he was striving to free himself, and shaking like a
  jelly-fish.</p>

  <p>The audience had sat quite still in their places until now, only half
  realising what was going on. But at my words it seemed suddenly to dawn upon
  them, and they crowded around us with a full appreciation of' my intended
  action.</p>

  <p>"Let him be, maester Hugh; we'll bring him along," they cried heartily,
  for there was not one whom I did not know. "We won't let him go, no fear. Who
  be 'e to call Maester Arbuthnot names?"</p>

  <p>The man whom I jealously released shook himself sulkily and slouched along
  in the middle of the crowd towards the door.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to be let go," he sneered. "If the boy wants a whipping I'll
  give it 'im. Most like he's a coward like his father though; and won't stand
  up to it."</p>

  <p>My blood was boiling, but I would not answer, there were others to speak
  for me, though.</p>

  <p>"You'd best keep that d&mdash;&mdash; tongue of yours fro' wagging in yer
  ugly mouth," cried Jim Holmes the blacksmith. "The lad's 'l the right to
  stand up for his father, and, boy or no boy, he's like to make a jelly-bag o'
  you. Bring him on the green, lads."</p>

  <p>They brought him on the green, and quickly formed a ring. The policeman,
  who was present as a delighted spectator, and who never dreamt of
  interfering, was good enough to hold my coat and waistcoat, whilst my
  adversary, unable to find any one willing to perform the same kind office for
  him, had to deposit his on the ground. He seemed in no hurry to declare
  himself ready, but at last the word was given, and we stood face to face.
  Even then he held up his hand for a minute's longer grace, and stared at me
  as though I were a ghost.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he muttered to himself, "it's Mr. Herbert's own self! It's just
  as he looked at me in the tent;" and he stared at me as though frightened,
  yet fascinated.</p>

  <p>Then we began. Of course I am not going to describe the fight. If we had
  been alone I should probably have killed him. As it was, they held me off by
  sheer force when they thought that he had had enough, and there was life
  still in him when I turned away, followed by an enthusiastic little
  crowd&mdash;but not much.</p>

  <p>I went straight to the schoolroom. It was deserted, and the gas was turned
  down. From one of the loiterers outside I heard that my father had gone home,
  and hastily bidding good night to the little crowd who still hung about my
  heels, I followed in the same direction.</p>

  <p>I had thought that I should have overtaken my father, and at every turn of
  the lane I looked forward to catching sight of him. But I was disappointed,
  and when I at last reached home without having done so, I began to feel
  nervously uneasy. I did not at once enter the house, but looked in at the
  window. My mother and Marian were alone, working. I looked through into the
  hall. Neither his hat nor coat were there.</p>

  <p>He could not have yet returned. And when I realised this I stepped back on
  to the lawn, pale and shivering, for a horrible foreboding had laid hold of
  me. What could have become of him? Where could he have gone? I could not
  imagine, I dared not conjecture.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-07"
     id="ch-07"></a>VII. --I AM TOLD</h2>

  <p class="first">"Master Hugh!"</p>

  <p>I had been leaning against a tree on the lawn, afraid to enter the house,
  yet knowing there was nothing else for me to do. At the sound of a voice
  close to my elbow I turned quickly round, and found myself face to face with
  our solitary man-servant, a raw country yokel with the garb and manners of a
  ploughboy.</p>

  <p>"Maester Hugh, dos't thee want t' master?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, William; have you seen him?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"That I have, Maester Hugh, and it zeemed to me that he had gone off 'is
  chump like. Ho coom down the lane 'bait quarter of an hour ago, and insteat
  o' cooming t' house, blamed if he didna turn in at Varmer Zmith's gate, and
  be a gone up theer," and the boy pointed to the dark outline of the headland
  which towered up above us.</p>

  <p>I sprang away from him, over the low wall, and up the steep winding path,
  with a reckless speed which frightened William out of the very few wits with
  which nature had endowed him, and bereft him of all words.</p>

  <p>I had but one idea, to get to the top as quickly as possible, and but one
  hope, that I might find him there when I arrived. I was a trained climber,
  and I did that night what I had never done before&mdash;I forsook the path
  and clambered right up the precipitous side of the hill, helping myself with
  hands and feet, heedless that a slip must cost me my life, and between my
  short, quick gasps for breath faltering out a prayer that I might be in
  time.</p>

  <p>It was granted. As I reached the last ridge, and swung myself on to the
  summit, grasping with my bleeding hands a friendly heather bush, I saw my
  father kneeling on the ground close to the edge of the cliff, with his coat
  and hat thrown on one side and his arms stretched out to the sea. In a moment
  I was beside him, and as my hand descended on his shoulder and closed upon
  him with a firm grasp, I drew a long sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Father, what does all this mean?" I cried. "What, are you doing here?
  Thank God that I have found you!"</p>

  <p>He started as though he were shot, and tried to shrink away from me. But I
  would have none of it. I dropped on my knees by his side, and locked my arm
  in his.</p>

  <p>"Father, tell me all about it," I pleaded. "Something terrible happened a
  long while ago, and that man who was there to-night knew about it. Am I not
  right? Tell me all about it; I am not afraid to hear."</p>

  <p>He shivered from head to foot, and his face looked ghastly cold. I reached
  out my hand for his coat and made him put it on.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, my poor boy, I had meant to tell you this, but I never dreamt that
  this would come. I thought that I was safe here-away from everyone."</p>

  <p>"Let me know it," I begged.</p>

  <p>"Ay, listen. When I was not much older than you are, I entered the
  army."</p>

  <p>I could not keep back the exclamation which rose to my lips. Had I not
  always thought that he had been a soldier?</p>

  <p>"At my first battle I unwisely deserted my post to save the life of the
  man whom we saw on Exmoor last night, and whose servant was at the meeting
  this evening. After the fighting was over I was charged with running away. I
  thought lightly of it, and appealed at once to the man whose life I had saved
  to come forward and clear me. He came forward with his servant, but, to my
  horror, they both deliberately perjured themselves. They swore that they had
  only seen me running away, and I was found guilty, guilty of
  cowardice&mdash;was cashiered, ruined, disgraced for life, and, but for your
  mother, I should have killed myself."</p>

  <p>The tears were swimming in my eyes, and I tightened my grasp upon his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Father, why did he do it?"</p>

  <p>"He sprang to his feet, his eyes ablaze with fury, and his voice
  shaking</p>

  <p>"That he might oust me from my home, and my father's heart&mdash;the
  cur&mdash;and take my position. We were half-brothers, and I was the elder.
  My father loved, me and cared little for Rupert. He was jealous. Ah! I can
  see it all now, and seized this opportunity of ruining me and getting rid of
  me for ever. He succeeded. Every one believed me guilty. My father turned me
  out of the house, bade me change my name, and forget that I was a&mdash;one
  of a noble family. From that day to this I have never looked upon his face or
  seen my old home. Your mother alone believed in me, refused to desert me;
  and, but for that, I must have died. Oh, God, it has been cruel!"</p>

  <p>He covered his face with his hands, and great sobs burst from him! My
  heart was beating with a passionate pity, but I could not tell how to comfort
  him.</p>

  <p>"Father, you know that I do not believe this thing," I cried. "Tell me the
  name of the man who has sworn to this wicked lie."</p>

  <p>"The same as your own and mine. Devereux. Rupert Devereux. Curse him! On
  his head be the sin of this thing, if sin there be! Good bye, my boy, good
  bye, Hugh!"</p>

  <p>He made a sudden movement to the edge of the cliff, and it was only by a
  stupendous effort that I caught hold of him in time.</p>

  <p>"Father, what would you do?" I cried. "Are you mad?"</p>

  <p>I caught hold of him by the waist, and dragged him back from his perilous
  position. He submitted without protesting&mdash;without speech of any sort.
  Looking into his face a great fear came upon me. Were my words prophetic, and
  was he indeed going mad? There was a dreamy, far-away look in his glazed
  eyes, a look which frightened me more than a wilder one would have done, and
  his face was like the face of a corpse. Then, with a deep groan, his knees
  would have given way from under him, but that I still held him up. He was
  unconscious.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-08"
     id="ch-08"></a>VIII. &mdash; MY VOW</h2>

  <p class="first">How we reached home that night I could never exactly tell. I
  know that I half carried, half supported him down the narrow path, and at
  last managed to reach the door of our house. But it was no easy task, and for
  some minutes I stood there panting and exhausted before I could bring myself
  to summon any one. Then my mother, who had been sitting up anxiously, heard
  us, and came hurrying out full of eager inquiries. But I had no strength left
  to answer her, and when she saw my father's state she ceased her questioning,
  for she knew at once what had happened.</p>

  <p>For three whole days and nights he was only partially conscious. Then he
  fell into a heavy sleep, which the doctor whom we had summoned from Minehead
  assured us was his salvation; and so it turned out, for on the fourth day he
  recovered consciousness, and within a week he was up, and looked much as
  usual, save for the worn, troubled look in his eyes, and the deeper lines on
  his forehead.</p>

  <p>On the first afternoon when he was allowed to talk, my mother was alone
  with him for several hours. Then she came out, and fetched me in from the
  garden and took me to him.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, my boy," he said slowly, looking up from his desk, "we are making
  our plans for the future. We are going to leave here at once."</p>

  <p>I was not surprised, and I was certainly not displeased. For although I
  loved our country home and the quaint homely people by whom we were
  surrounded, I could never lock upon Bossington Headland again without a
  shudder, when I remembered how nearly it had witnessed a terrible
  tragedy.</p>

  <p>"Your mother and I thought of travelling abroad for a while," he went on.
  "I shall never be able to settle down anywhere again. But with you it is
  different. You ought to go to college and choose a profession. Whether you do
  so or not must depend upon one thing. I myself shall never resume the name
  which I am supposed to have disgraced, but if you choose to do so there is
  nothing to prevent you. You will have to bear a certain amount of odium, but
  it is not everyone who will visit my disgrace upon you. You will be poor, but
  although my father will never leave either of us a penny he cannot prevent
  the title coming to me, and eventually to you. The entailed estates which go
  with the title are very small, and I hear that he has purposely mortgaged
  them up to the hilt, so that nothing should ever come to me from them. But if
  you choose to bear your rightful name you will claim a place amongst one of
  the oldest and most honorable families in the country, you can go to college,
  and somehow or other we will find the money to start you in one of the
  professions, but not in the army."</p>

  <p>"And if I choose still to bear the name I have always done?"</p>

  <p>"Then you will not be able to go to college, or to enter any of the
  professions," my father answered. "You can do neither under an assumed
  name."</p>

  <p>I walked up and down the room for a minute or two thinking. My mind was
  soon made up.</p>

  <p>"I will not bear any name that you do not," I declared firmly. "If my
  grandfather thinks that you are not worthy to bear the name of Devereux,
  neither will I, unless the time shall come when he and the whole world shall
  know the truth, and you shall take your name again: I will never call myself
  anything else but Hugh Arbuthnot."</p>

  <p>My father stretched out his hand, and looked up at me with glistening
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Spoken like a man, Hugh," he said. "God grant, that that day may
  come!"</p>

  <p>"Amen!" I added fervently. "And come it shall!"</p>

  <p>But I did not tell him then the resolve which I had grafted into my heart.
  I did not tell him then that I had sworn to myself that I would roll this
  cloud away from his name, even if I wrung the confession from my uncle's
  dying lips, and if success should be denied to me, I would, at least, find
  some means of bringing down retribution on the head of the man who had
  wrecked and embittered my father's life. By fair means or foul I would gain
  my end. At eighteen years old I devoted and consecrated my life to this
  purpose.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-09"
     id="ch-09"></a>IX. --AN UNEXPECTED VISIT</h2>

  <p class="first">During the next four years of my life there happened to me
  not one single incident worth recording. Our home had been broken up, and we
  had left Devonshire for ever. My father and mother were living abroad at a
  small country town in the south of France, Marian was at a boarding school at
  Weymouth, and I&mdash;I was articled clerk to a very respectable firm of land
  agents and surveyors in Exeter.</p>

  <p>To say that I was contented would be false, but, on the other hand, I was
  not absolutely miserable. The out-of-door life suited me, and I did not find
  the work unpleasant. But apart from that I was by no means satisfied. Day and
  night I carried with me the pale unhappy face of my poor father, his proud
  spirit continually being lashed and mortified by the disgrace which falsely
  rested upon him. I thought of him wandering about in a foreign country,
  exiled from his proper place in the world, from the society of his fellows,
  from all things which men of his kind most esteem. I thought of him bearing
  always in his mind those cruel words of his father's, "Out of my house and
  out of my heart," and it seemed to me a disgrace that I should be leading a
  humdrum life in a quiet country town, instead of throwing all my heart and
  energies into the task which I had placed before me as a sacred mission. But
  how was I to commence it? The combined income of my father and mother was
  barely four hundred a year, out of which I received one hundred, besides a
  trifling salary, which, however, was soon to be increased. Out of this I had
  been able to save a little, but not much. Nothing which would be of the
  slightest service to me in commencing such a task as I had in view. And so I
  did not see what move I could possibly make in the matter which was nearest
  to any heart, although my present inaction was irksome, at times almost
  unbearably irksome to me.</p>

  <p>One night I was working late in my little sitting-room copying some plans,
  when I heard steps on the stairs and the door was quietly opened. I looked up
  in some surprise, for I never had visitors, and my landlady would scarcely
  have entered without knocking. But when I saw who it was standing on the
  threshold I dropped my compasses and sprang up with an eager, welcoming
  cry.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, my boy!" and our hands were locked in a close grasp. Then all of a
  sudden the joy of this unexpected meeting was dispelled, and my heart sank
  cold within me. For from head to foot he was clothed in the deepest mourning,
  and the tears were standing in his hollow eyes.</p>

  <p>"Something has happened!" I exclaimed, in a low voice. "Tell me!
  Mother&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is dead!"</p>

  <p>Then he sank down upon my hard little horsehair sofa, and covered his face
  with his hands, and I waited patiently, though with an aching heart, for
  surely his sorrow was greater than mine.</p>

  <p>Presently he told me more&mdash;told me how she had caught a fever at a
  poor "ouvrier's" cottage, which had never been looked upon as serious until
  too late; and how she would not have either Marian or me sent for when she
  knew that she was dying, but had written us each a dying message, and had
  made him promise to bring the sad news to us himself, and not trust it to a
  letter. But all this has little to do with my story, so I pass it briefly
  over.</p>

  <p>He had told me all that there was to tell, and then I ventured to speak to
  him of the future. I had hoped that he would have settled down in England
  somewhere with Marian and me, but it was a hope which he very soon
  dispelled.</p>

  <p>"Your mother's death," he said, in a low tone when I first began to hint
  at my desire, "has left me free. I shall look to you to make a home for
  Marian, and I shall make over to you for that purpose three quarters of my
  income. For myself I can never live in England. There is one place, and one
  place only, which I could call home, and there I cannot go. My life has been
  for a long time too sedentary a one to be pleasing to me. I am a man of
  action, and I can never forget that I was once a soldier. I must go where
  there is fighting."</p>

  <p>His words were a blow to me, and for a moment or two I did not answer him.
  My heart was too hot for words, full of a burning indignation against the
  cruel slander which was sapping away his life. Notwithstanding the weary look
  in his eyes, and his wrinkled brow, he was still the finest-looking man I had
  ever, or ever have, seen. Handsome after the highest type of the patrician
  Englishman. He was tall, and though slight, magnificently shaped, with long,
  firm limbs and stately carriage. His features, though powerful and strongly
  defined, were delicately carved and of the most refined type, and though his
  hair and moustache were greyer even than when he had left Devonshire, he was
  still in the prime of life. There was the "je ne sais quois" of a soldier
  about him, the air of command and military bearing. And yet there was nothing
  better for him to do with his life than go and throw it away amongst
  foreigners, fighting in a cause for which he could care nothing, and which
  glory and patriotism, the highest incentives of a soldier, could never make
  dear to him.</p>

  <p>A curse upon that uncle of mine! I would have uttered it out loud, but for
  fear of raising a storm which I should not be able to quell. So I breathed it
  to myself, savagely, and none the less emphatically.</p>

  <p>"Let me go with you, father," I begged; "I am sick of this humdrum life,
  and I cannot bear to think of your going wandering about the world by
  yourself; I can fight, and could soon learn the drill."</p>

  <p>He shook his head decisively.</p>

  <p>"It is good of you to want to come, Hugh," he said kindly, "but it is
  quite out of the question. You have your sister to look after, and besides,"
  he added, with a smile, "I do not think my career as a soldier of fortune
  will be a long one."</p>

  <p>"Father, don't talk like that," I cried, passionately. "They say that some
  time or other truth will always out, and I believe it! I believe that the day
  will come when your innocence will be made clear!"</p>

  <p>He shook his head dejectedly, but not without emotion.</p>

  <p>"Little hope of that," he said with a deep sigh. "Two men alone amongst
  the living know the truth about that day, and having once perjured
  themselves, they are not likely to recant."</p>

  <p>"And those two are my uncle Rupert and his servant. What was the servant's
  name?"</p>

  <p>"John Hilton, the man who was at the meeting at Porlock," my father
  answered, with a shudder, at the recollection of that terrible night. "There
  was one other man who might have cleared me; but, as fate would have it, when
  I appealed for his evidence it was discovered that his name was on the
  missing list. He was either killed or taken prisoner."</p>

  <p>"Who was he?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Sergeant Fenwick. Without doubt he was killed, or he would have been
  delivered over to us at the peace. No, unless Rupert confesses, and one might
  as well expect the heavens to fall in, I shall die dishonored and nameless,"
  my father concluded, bitterly.</p>

  <p>I stood up and drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"Father," I cried in a low, intense tone, "have you never felt that you
  must seek out this hound of a brother of yours, and hold him by the throat
  until he has confessed, or until the breath is gone out of his body? I should
  feel like that! I should want to stand face to face with him and wring the
  truth from his lying lips."</p>

  <p>My father's eyes were sparkling, and his whole frame quivering with
  compressed excitement.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Hugh, I have felt like that," he cried, "many and many a time. Do you
  remember the night when we met him on the moor near Dunkerry? If I had been
  alone that night I should have killed him. I know that I should. It is for
  that reason that I dare not seek him out. If I heard him utter that lie
  again, if I saw in his eyes one gleam of pity for me whose life he has
  hopelessly wrecked, no power on earth could keep me from strangling him, and
  so I do not seek to meet him. But if chance throws him in my way again, when
  we are alone, God have mercy on him and me!"</p>

  <p>There was a long silence between us. Then I asked him further questions
  about his present plans.</p>

  <p>"You must not think me unkind, Hugh," he said, gently, "but mine is a very
  flying visit. I cannot breathe in this country. It chokes me! Everything
  reminds me so of home! To-night, in half an hour's time," he added, taking
  out his watch, "I leave here for Weymouth to see Marian. To-morrow afternoon
  I leave England, most likely for ever."</p>

  <p>I tried entreaties, remonstrances, reproaches, but they were all in vain.
  He shook his head to all.</p>

  <p>"I have called at London on my way here," he said, interrupting me in the
  midst of my appeal, "and have made over my account at Smith's to you. Here is
  the pass-book and a cheque-book. Mr. Malcolm, of 18 Bucklersbury, is my
  solicitor, and will pay you three hundred a year. If at any time you desire
  to re-invest the capital you can do so, for it stands in your name. Hugh, God
  knows it is my bitter sorrow that I can leave you nothing better than a
  tarnished name. But remember this: I believe that if you were to go to your
  grandfather, and tell him who you were, and that I had left England with a
  vow never to return, I believe then that he would receive you, and would make
  you his heir. So that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Father, what do you take me for?" I interrupted, passionately. "I will
  live and die Hugh Arbuthnot, unless you before me bear the name and title of
  the Devereuxs. Can you imagine that I would seek out my grandfather and crave
  his recognition, whilst you were wandering about, in miserable exile,
  excluded from it? Father, you cannot think so meanly of me."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand without speaking, but the gesture was in itself
  enough. Then he drew out his watch, and rose.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, my boy, good bye, and God bless you! Where I am going I cannot tell
  you, for I do not know myself. But I will write, and if at any time you have
  news for me and do not know my address, put an advertisement in the 'Times.'
  Take care of Marian&mdash;and&mdash;and God bless you."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He was gone, and save a dull, gnawing pain at my heart, and
  the letter which lay on the table before me, there was nothing to remind me
  of his recent presence. All through the long hours in the night I sat in my
  chair with my head buried in my hands, and&mdash;I see no shame in confessing
  it&mdash;many passionate tears falling on to my spoilt plans. Then, when the
  grey streaks of dawn commenced to rise in the eastern sky, and throw a
  ghastly light into my sitting-room, in which the gas was still burning, I
  fell into a drowsy sleep. When I awoke the sun was shining in a clear sky,
  and the cathedral bells were chiming the hour. It was eight o'clock.</p>

  <p>I stood up half dazed. Then my eyes fell upon the letter which still lay
  before me, and I remembered with a cold chill all that had happened. I
  stretched out my hand for it, and tore it open.</p>

  <p>The handwriting was weak and straggling, and the words were few; but I
  held it reverently, for it was a message from the dead.</p>

  <p>"Farewell, my dearest Hugh, for before this reaches you I shall be dead.
  Take care of Marian always, and be good to her. With my last strength, Hugh,
  I am tracing these words to lay upon you a solemn charge. Your father is
  dying slowly of a broken heart. Year after year I have watched him grow more
  and more unhappy, as the memory of this cruel dishonor seems to grow keener
  and bitterer. He is pining away for the love of his old home, his father, and
  the name which he was once so proud to bear. Oh, Hugh, let it be your task,
  however impossible it may seem, to bring the truth to light, and clear his
  name and your own. Hugh, this is my dying prayer to you. With my last
  strength I write these words, and I shall die at peace, because I know that
  you will bear them ever in your heart, and carry them on with you to the end.
  Farewell! My strength is going fast, and my eyes are becoming dim. But thank
  God that I have been able to finish this letter. Farewell, Hugh!&mdash;From
  your loving Mother."</p>

  <p>Word by word I read it steadfastly through to the end, and then, my heart
  throbbing with the fire of a great purpose, I threw open the window and
  looked out. Below me stretched the fair city of Devon, smiling and peaceful,
  basking in the early morning sunshine, and the air around was still ringing
  with the music of the cathedral chimes. Little it all matched with my mood,
  for my whole being was vibrating with an agony of hate, and with the fervor
  of a great resolution. With the letter clutched in my hands, I stretched them
  forth to the blue, cloudless sky, and swore an oath so fearful and
  blasphemous that the memory of it even now makes me shudder. But I kept it,
  and thank God, without sin.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-10"
     id="ch-10"></a>X. --THE FIRST MOVE</h2>

  <p class="first">My first plans were not easy to form. I was like a blind man
  groping for some object which has slipped from his fingers, and not knowing
  in which direction to search for it first. I had a great and solemn purpose
  before me, a purpose which was my first consideration in life, and which
  nothing but death would cause me to relinquish. But I did not know how to
  start upon it.</p>

  <p>I was in London when the idea occurred to me, save for which this story
  might never have been written. It was simple enough, and very vague. Nothing
  more or less than to try to procure employment near the Devereux estates,
  which I knew were somewhere in Yorkshire.</p>

  <p>My idea was no sooner conceived than I put it into operation. I went to
  the firm of agents to whom my late employers had given me a letter of
  introduction, and inquired whether they knew of any vacancy in Yorkshire,
  either in a land agent's office or on an estate. One of the clerks ran
  through a long list, and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Nothing so far north," he declared shutting up the book. "Two or three in
  Leicestershire, if that would do."</p>

  <p>I shook my head, and, thanking him, turned away disappointed. At the door
  he called me back as though a sudden thought had struck him.</p>

  <p>"Just wait one moment, will you?" he said, jumping down from his stool.
  "There was a letter from Yorkshire this morning which I haven't seen yet.
  I'll fetch it from the governor's room and see what it's about."</p>

  <p>I took a seat, and he vanished into the inner office. Presently he
  reappeared smiling.</p>

  <p>"Lucky thing I noticed the postmark of this letter," he remarked. "Strikes
  me it's just what you want. Listen," and he read it out:</p>

  <p>"'Devereux Court, Yorkshire. "'Colonel Sir Francis Devereux&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"Hullo! what's the matter with you?" he broke off suddenly.</p>

  <p>I mastered myself with a quick effort.</p>

  <p>"I'm all right," I answered, a little hoarsely. "It's a trifle hot in
  here, that's all. Go on."</p>

  <p>He began again</p>

  <p>"'Colonel Sir Francis Devereux is in want of a young man to act under his
  present agent and collaborate with him in the management of his estate.
  Applicant must have some knowledge of farming and surveying, and must be a
  gentleman. Credentials and unexceptionable references required. Salary #250 a
  year and a cottage rent free.'"</p>

  <p>"There, Mr. Arbuthnot, how would that do for you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing could suit me better," I exclaimed&mdash;so eagerly that the
  young man looked at me surprised. "To whom have I to apply?" He consulted the
  letter again.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Benson, solicitor, 19 Bedford Row, has authority to engage you. You
  had better go and see him, I should think."</p>

  <p>I thanked him and hurried out. So nervous was I lest some one else should
  precede me and secure the better chance that I jumped into a stray hansom and
  was driven straight to Mr. Benson's office. There I was informed, to my great
  satisfaction, that Mr. Benson was in, and disengaged, and in a few minutes I
  was shown into his room.</p>

  <p>He was sitting at his desk when I entered, a short, clean-shaven,
  grey-haired man, with a keen but not unkindly face. He motioned me to a seat,
  and kept his eyes fixed steadfastly upon me whilst I explained my
  mission.</p>

  <p>When I had finished he took out a bunch of keys from his pocket, and
  carefully unlocked a small drawer in his desk. For a full minute he seemed to
  be examining something there, glancing up at me more than once. Then he took
  it and passed it across the table to me.</p>

  <p>"Do you recognise that, Mr. Arbuthnot?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>Recognise it? How could I help it? It was a photograph&mdash;and the
  photograph of my father.</p>

  <p>I leaned back in my chair, agitated and disappointed. Mr. Benson watched
  me for a while in silence.</p>

  <p>"I see that you are in mourning, Mr. Devereux," he said, suddenly,
  noticing it for the first time. "Your father is well, I hope?"</p>

  <p>I pulled myself together, and answered him&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I am in mourning for my mother, Mr. Benson. I can't say that my father is
  well, but he is not ill that I know of."</p>

  <p>The lawyer was sitting with his head resting upon his elbow, and his eyes
  fixed upon the photograph.</p>

  <p>"Poor Mr. Herbert&mdash;poor Mr. Herbert!" he said to himself, in a low
  tone.</p>

  <p>Something, perhaps his sympathetic tone, prompted me to ask him a
  question.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Benson, you knew my father. Do you believe that he was a coward?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer looked up at once.</p>

  <p>"I do not," he said, firmly. "I never did, and never will."</p>

  <p>The words were the sweetest I had ever heard in my life.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for those words, Mr. Benson," I exclaimed, warmly. "I can't
  tell you how glad I am to hear them. But don't call me by the name of
  Devereux again, please. I won't hear it, I won't even own it."</p>

  <p>He nodded approvingly, but made no direct reply. Then, in answer to his
  questions, I told him as much of our history as I myself knew.</p>

  <p>"And with regard to your application to me to-day," he remarked, after a
  short pause, "it seems a strange one under the circumstances."</p>

  <p>I hesitated, and then I told him everything&mdash;told him of my father's
  breaking heart, of my mother's last letter to me, and of my vow. He listened
  patiently, and with every sign of strong interest.</p>

  <p>"Yours is a noble purpose," he said, when I had concluded, "and though I
  fear that it is hopeless, I shall throw no obstacle in your way. What I can
  do for you I will. You can go to Devereux, and I shall write to Sir Francis,
  telling him that you are admirably suited for the work, and, from my own
  knowledge, that you are a gentleman. Fortunately Sir Francis is rather
  near-sighted, and as he obstinately refuses to wear glasses there is not the
  fear of his recognising you that there would otherwise be. But I'm rather
  afraid of Mr. Rupert. Fortunately, he's not often at Devereux."</p>

  <p>"I must chance all that," I declared. "After all, a resemblance is very
  different from actual recognition. I shall try to hit upon some way of
  altering my appearance a little."</p>

  <p>"You have my best wishes for your success," declared the lawyer, rising.
  "Write to me, Mr. Arbuthnot&mdash;Mr. Hugh, I may call you. I shall be always
  pleased to hear how you are getting on; and if you need advice or a friend at
  any time, come to me. Good morning."</p>

  <p>I left him feeling almost light-hearted. To have met a man who believed in
  my father was like a strong invigorating tonic to me. That afternoon I
  telegraphed to Marian to come to me at once, and set about making the few
  preparations necessary for our expected move into Yorkshire.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-11"
     id="ch-11"></a>XI. --COLONEL DEVEREUX'S LAND AGENT</h2>

  <p class="first">As yet I have said nothing of my sister Marian. It is
  necessary for me now to do so. They say that a man can never describe or
  appreciate his own sister, and, on the whole, I am not disinclined to lend
  some credence to this statement. I know that Marian was beautiful, for many
  people have told, me so, but to give a detailed description of her as she was
  then I should find an impossible task. I know that her
  beauty&mdash;prettiness always seemed to me the more appropriate
  term&mdash;was of the order evolved by the combination of a trim, shapely
  figure, good features and complexion, plenty of fair hair, and soft grey eyes
  (the latter a heritage from her mother), which knew equally well how to gleam
  with mischief, or to flash with a tenderer and more dangerous light. I feel
  some diffidence in using the term, but I am bound to here place on record my
  conviction that when she left school and, in obedience to my telegram, joined
  me in London, my sister Marian was more or less inclined to be a flirt.</p>

  <p>Of the shadow which rested upon my father's name she knew nothing, nor did
  she know that the name we bore was an assumed one, or anything of the purpose
  which had induced me to fix our temporary residence in Yorkshire. I judged
  her to be of too light a nature to be trusted with a great
  secret&mdash;besides, she would doubtless be happier not knowing.</p>

  <p>Three days we spent together in London making purchases and superintending
  the packing up and forwarding of our few belongings. Then there came a note
  from Colonel Devereux, short but polite, intimating that the sooner I could
  find it convenient to assume my new position the better. On the next day
  Marian and I travelled down to Yorkshire.</p>

  <p>It was dusk when we arrived at the little wayside station at which we had
  been directed to alight. Directly I had helped Marian out of the carriage,
  and we stood together on the platform, a tall, bland-looking man, dressed in
  the soberest black, hurried up to us and took off his hat.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot?"</p>

  <p>I admitted that his surmise was correct, and presumed that he had come
  from Devereux.</p>

  <p>"Just so, sir. Colonel Devereux desired me to present his compliments, and
  if you find that the cottage is not yet habitable, rooms can be prepared for
  you at the court."</p>

  <p>"Very kind, I'm sure," I answered, watching with satisfaction our last box
  safely thrown out from the van. "We're quite prepared to rough it for a day
  or two, however, and I nave no doubt that we shall be able to manage. Have
  you brought anything down for the luggage?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir. Bring them this way, John," he added to the porter, and
  led us through the little booking office out into the road, where a small
  shapely brougham, drawn by a pair of magnificent dark bays, was waiting.</p>

  <p>"I thought it better to bring a brougham, sir," he explained, "as the
  young lady might find it chilly driving across the moor. Londoners mostly
  find it so. There's no need to wait for the luggage, sir. The cart's here for
  that, and I've given orders for them to bring it on. I'll have to intrude
  upon you inside, sir, as far as the cottage, as my master's orders is that I
  don't leave you until I see you in a fair way to be comfortable. I'd have
  come down on the box, but the Colonel is so mighty particular about little
  things that it's more than I dare do to let a carriage leave the yard without
  a man on the box, even at night. This is Knighton, this village, sir. From
  the top of the next hill you'd be able to see a good part of Devereux Court
  if it were only light enough."</p>

  <p>I let him talk on uninterrupted, for I was too full of a nervous internal
  excitement to be able to talk. I was amongst the scenes&mdash;in a few
  minutes I should be in sight of the very house-where my father had spent his
  boyhood. That thought was enough to engross me&mdash;to drive every other
  from my mind, and for once I was devoutly thankful for Marian's ceaseless
  chatter, which spared me from all necessity of speech.</p>

  <p>We dashed through a tiny village, and up a steep hill. "Dashed" is rather
  a clap-trap word, perhaps, but it is not far from correctly expressing the
  rate of our progress. The roads were in good order, it was not yet dark; the
  thoroughbred horses were eager to get home, and quivering with impatience,
  and the coachman seemed to be of the same mind. And so I could see but very
  little of the country. A heather-covered moor, varied by occasional patches
  of pasture land, bordered the road on either side, but in front things seemed
  to be different. I could just distinguish the dim outline of a low range of
  hills, and we seemed to be approaching a wood. Suddenly the carriage came to
  a halt, but it was only for a moment. A pair of great iron gates wore rolled
  open before us, and we proceeded along a smoother road as swiftly as
  before.</p>

  <p>"Are we nearly there?" asked Marian, looking behind at the grey stone,
  thatched lodges, which were as large as moderate sized houses.</p>

  <p>Colonel Devereux's servant shook his head, and, smiled in the light of his
  superior knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Bless you, no, miss; we're only just inside the park. It's six miles from
  the lodge gates to the House" (the capital may seem superfluous, but I'm
  quite sure that the man meant it), "and five and a half to the cottage."</p>

  <p>Marian's grey eyes were wide open in earnest now.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear me! Did you hear that, Hugh? The park six miles from the house!
  This must be a very big place."</p>

  <p>"Big!" Our companion's face grew quite solemn in its impressiveness.
  "There ain't such another place in Yorkshire, nor yet in England, barring
  three. Devereux Court, to my mind, is the finest building I ever set eyes on.
  Why, it's the show place of the county, and we gets no end of visitors from
  all parts to look at it."</p>

  <p>"Colonel Devereux is a very fortunate man," I remarked.</p>

  <p>The man's manner grew a shade more confidential, and I listened with more
  eagerness than I dared show.</p>

  <p>"Well, he should be, sir; but I doubt whether he thinks himself so. You
  see, his family ain't turned out exactly well. He married twice, and each
  wife died within two years of her marriage, and, strangely enough, each left
  him a son. Of course, when they grew up they both wanted to be soldiers. They
  do say, sir, that every Devereux for twelve generations has been a soldier. A
  blood-thirsty race they must be!</p>

  <p>"But, as I was saying, they both became soldiers, and went out together in
  the same regiment for their first campaign. Well, they say that one of 'em,
  Mr. Herbert his name was, the elder of the two, and the old Colonel's
  favorite and heir, disgraced himself. Anyway, he was found guilty of
  cowardice, and turned out of his regiment. It very near killed the Colonel,
  and he's never been the same man since. He's taken a mortal dislike to his
  other son, Mr. Rupert, and, though he makes no secret of it that he's left
  him all his estates and property, he never lets him come down here
  scarcely."</p>

  <p>"Bait the title? He can't leave that to his second son," I said. "That
  must go to the one whom you say disgraced himself."</p>

  <p>"It's just that that's troubling the Colonel more than anything," replied
  the man. "He says it makes him wild to think that the title of Devereux of
  Devereux must be borne by a coward, and that his picture gallery and grand
  old house must go to him, too. At times I have heard him pray that his son
  may be dead, and have died childless; and yet, hard old man though he is,
  it's easy to see, from the way he talks about him sometimes, that he's as
  fond of him as ever, though he'd never confess it. But I'm afraid I'm tiring
  you, sir. Family histories are not very interesting to strangers."</p>

  <p>To strangers! I could scarcely keep a sardonic smile from my lips as I
  echoed the words in my thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," I answered, as lightly as I could; "but I was going to ask
  you who is there living with Sir Francis now."</p>

  <p>"Well, there's no one living regularly with him, sir, except you count old
  Mrs Platts, who really ain't much more than a housekeeper, though I believe
  she's a sort of distant connection. But, just now, there's Miss Maud
  Devereux, Mr. Rupert's daughter, and a friend of hers stopping here. Here we
  are at the cottage, Mr. Arbuthnot."</p>

  <p>The carriage had pulled up, and a tall footman was standing by the side of
  the opened door. I helped Marian out and looked around. A little distance in
  front there was a low wire fencing, and about fifty yards further back, with
  a dark plantation of fir trees immediately behind it, was a long, low, grey
  stone house, with gabled roof and old-fashioned windows. As we approached,
  the door was thrown open, and two smiling countrified-looking servants, with
  neat caps and aprons, stood in a flood of light to welcome us.</p>

  <p>We stepped into the hall, and Marian and I looked at one another in
  astonishment. This was all very different to what I had expected, and my
  first thought was that the few odds and ends of furniture which I had sent
  down would be of very little use in such a place as this. But our greatest
  surprise was to come, for when one of our pleasant-looking servants threw
  open the door of the dining-room, the room was already furnished, and in a
  fashion which made us gaze around in astonishment. In stead of bare boards,
  which we had half expected, our feet sank into a thick Turkey carpet, and the
  furniture, solid and handsomely carved, matched the black oak panelling which
  skirted the walls. A bright fire was burning in a marble grate, and the
  table, covered with a snow-white cloth, and many things more substantial, was
  glittering with cut-glass, flowers, and heavy plate, on which were the
  Devereux arms.</p>

  <p>I looked at Colonel Devereux's servant in an amazement which seemed to
  amuse him immensely.</p>

  <p>"What has become of the furniture I sent down?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It is in the lumber room, sir," was the man's quiet reply. "Colonel
  Devereux's strict orders were that the place should be furnished for you from
  attic to cellar, and there's furniture enough up at the Court which no one
  ever sees, enough to furnish a score of such places as this. I hope I may say
  that you are satisfied, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Satisfied? It's quite too lovely," declared Marian, sinking into a low
  chair. "Isn't it, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"Colonel Devereux has been very kind," I assented, thoughtfully, for I was
  not too sure that I was altogether pleased.</p>

  <p>"And I was to tell you, miss," continued the man, backing towards the
  door, "that the servants here, and also your man, sir," turning towards me,
  "receive their wages from the steward. You'll pardon my mentioning this, but
  it was the housekeeper's strict orders. Good-night, miss; good-night, sir.
  Colonel Devereux will see you to-morrow morning at 11, if you'll be so good
  as to come up to the Court. Good-night, sir."</p>

  <p>This time he really went, and we were left for a moment alone. I am
  obliged to confess that the first thing my madcap sister did was to waltz
  round the room, and wind up by throwing herself into my arms.</p>

  <p>"Isn't this perfectly delightful, Hugh, and isn't the Colonel an old dear?
  I declare I could kiss him! And I am so hungry, and everything looks so nice.
  Do ring the bell, Hugh."</p>

  <p>There was no need, for before she had finished speaking one of our buxom
  servants had entered with the tray, and the other was waiting to show us our
  rooms, which we found no less comfortable. Everything was totally different
  to what I had expected, and for Marian's sake I was pleased. But for my own I
  could not help regretting that I should be forced to accept favors from the
  man who believed my father to be a coward and a liar, and whose cruel words,
  "Out of my house and out of my heart for ever," he carried always with him in
  weary exile.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-12"
     id="ch-12"></a>XII. &mdash; DEVEREAUX COURT</h2>

  <p class="first">At six o'clock on the following morning I was up and in the
  park. I had prepared myself for much, but what I saw exceeded everything. It
  is not part of my role as story-teller to attempt long descriptions. I am not
  an artist or a descriptive writer, and were I to attempt to play the part of
  either I should most certainly fail. But the park and mansion of Devereux
  were one day bound to be mine, even though they brought me pauperdom, and
  despite the sorrow and bitter grief which were bound up in this recollection,
  a curious thrill, in which there was something of pleasure, passed through me
  as I looked upon them for the first time by daylight.</p>

  <p>The cottage&mdash;such a term was surely a misnomer, for it was three
  times as large as the habitable part of our Devonshire home&mdash;stood at
  the extremity of the park nearest to the house. Only a wire ring fence
  separated the gardens from the soft springy turf of the park, which, studded
  with giant oak trees, a revelation to me after the comparatively stunted
  growths of Devonshire, stretched away in one direction as far as I could see.
  Bordering it on one side, close behind the cottage, and curving round as
  though to form a fitting background for Devereux Court, was a low range of
  hills, some crowned with thick plantations of black fir, and others purple
  with the declining glory of the autumn heather. But the house was the
  grandest sight of all. A great architect might have learnedly protested
  against its want of any distinct style and its general want of outline, but
  he would have admired it all the same. It was one of those houses which no
  one can describe, save by making use of such adjectives as picturesque,
  romantic, majestic. It was all these, and more. The style of every age seemed
  represented by the successive enlargements of every century. Every Devereux
  of Devereux had added something to it, until a century ago, and every one
  seemed to have had different notions of architecture. There was something in
  it of the castle, something of the mediaeval abbey, something of the Italian
  villa, and something of the Venetian palace. It was a magnificent medley, a
  striking mass of architectural incongruity&mdash;altogether the finest
  building that I had ever seen. It excited me to look upon it, and at the same
  time it depressed me. Its frowning battlements and gloomily majestic
  weather-beaten towers seemed to breathe out and help me to better understand
  the spirit which had fired the words of the stern, proud, old soldier, who
  had bidden my father leave his home for ever, and bear another name than the
  name of Devereux. For the first time I began to look forward to the
  inevitable interview with my grandfather with some thing akin to
  apprehension.</p>

  <p>At breakfast time Marian's lively chatter drove all such thoughts out of
  my head.</p>

  <p>And before they had had time to crowd in on me again, a man from the
  stables was announced, with whom I went to examine the two horses placed at
  my disposal.</p>

  <p>I loved horses, and it seemed as though Sir Francis Devereux was
  determined to do everything "au prince." Besides a stout useful cob, there
  was an animal with which I fell in love the moment I saw it. The man
  uncovered him gingerly, and took particular care to keep out of the reach of
  his heels.</p>

  <p>"I was to tell you, sir," he said, confidentially, as he came out of the
  box, "that if you wished to change this 'ere animal&mdash;the Black Prince
  they call 'im&mdash;for one a wee bit less spirity, that you was to come up
  to the stables and choose for yourself. There ain't no vice about 'im, but
  he's got a mouth like iron and the devil's own temper."</p>

  <p>"I think I shall manage him," I answered confidently. "Who's been in the
  habit of riding him?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, Miss Maud rode him for a bit, but he used to pull her arms out
  very near, and he gave her one nasty fall, so Sir Francis he's made her leave
  off."</p>

  <p>"I should think so," I answered.</p>

  <p>The Black Prince, fine animal though he was, was certainly not a lady's
  mount.</p>

  <p>"Well, she's a rare plucky 'un is Miss Maud, and a fine seat, too,"
  remarked the man, leisurely chewing a wisp of straw. "You think he'll do for
  you, sir, then?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," I answered.</p>

  <p>Then, glancing at my watch, and seeing that it was but nine o'clock, it
  struck me that I might as well give him a trial at once, and in half an
  hour's time I was careering across the park, my spirits rising at every bound
  the Black Prince made, and my cheeks glowing with the rapid progress through
  the sharp morning air, and with the strain of keeping him in hand. What
  pleasure is there within the reach of man so great as a gallop across an open
  country, with the fresh morning breeze blowing strong in your teeth, and your
  mount a perfect one? I got back to the cottage, just before eleven, and after
  seeing Marian start off for a walk, I set out for Devereux Court, all my
  apprehensions vanished, and I was only eager to stand face to face with its
  master.</p>

  <p>I had not far to go. Up a steep ascent, across a bridge, through some more
  iron gates, and I stood upon the open stretch of gravel in front of the main
  entrance, which was supported by four massive white stone pillars. A
  man-servant was waiting within the glass doors, which were promptly opened
  before me, and on telling him my name, I was led across the vast hall, which
  seemed to me, from its great height, the stained windows, and its size, like
  the interior of a richly-decorated church, into the library. I had never been
  in such a room before, nor have I ever since, but the man gave me little time
  to admire it, for, opening the door of a small ante-room at its furthest
  extremity, which had a far more habitable appearance, he bade me wait whilst
  he informed Sir Francis of my arrival.</p>

  <p>The room seemed to open upon the gardens, for, though the venetian blinds
  were drawn, I could hear distinctly the voices of two girls playing tennis
  just outside.</p>

  <p>"Love, love 15, love 30, love 40. Maud, you're a great deal too lazy for
  tennis this morning!"</p>

  <p>The girl's triumphant voice floated into the room so clearly that at first
  I was surprised. Then, by the gentle swaying to and fro of the blind, I saw
  that the window was open.</p>

  <p>The charge seemed not to be made with out foundation, to judge from the
  languid drawl of the answering voice.</p>

  <p>"I believe I am, Olive. It really is too exhausting without some men to
  look after the balls. Suppose we have a rest for a minute or two."</p>

  <p>There was a laughing assent, and then I heard light footsteps coming
  towards the window. I thought at first that they were going to enter; but
  just outside they halted and seemed to subside into a seat.</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence, during which time I withdrew as far as
  possible from the window. But I was still within easy reach of their voices,
  as I very soon learnt, not a little to my discomfort.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what the new young man's like at the cottage. Have you seen him,
  Maud?"</p>

  <p>I started, and drew further back into my corner.</p>

  <p>"I really don't know," was the very uninterested reply. "By the bye,
  though, I did see a stranger in the park yesterday. Perhaps it was he."</p>

  <p>"What was he like? Fancy not telling me, when you knew I was dying to
  hear. Is he tall or short, dark or fair?"</p>

  <p>A scornful inflection had crept into the languid drawl of the answering
  voice. But it was far from an unpleasant voice to listen to&mdash;"I only saw
  him for a moment, but I remember that he was short, and had red hair, and
  wore glasses. I don't think even you would flirt with him. Olive."</p>

  <p>This was dreadful. I was six foot four, and my eyesight was keener than
  most men's. She must have mistaken some one else for me! But what was I to
  do? I tried a nervous little cough, but they took no notice.</p>

  <p>"Oh! I'm so disappointed. I had made up my mind that he was good-looking,
  and would do to flirt with, at any rate, until the shooting brings some men
  down. Goodness gracious, what was that?"</p>

  <p>Rendered desperate by the mention of my name. I had essayed a more
  determined cough. Now that it had been heard my best course was to reveal
  myself at once. So I walked to the window and drew up the blind.</p>

  <p>Two girls started to their feet at once, and stood looking at me in
  startled postures, one dark, of medium height, decidedly pretty, and with a
  gleam of mischief in her large eyes; the other tall and slim, fair, and
  stately as a young princess, with a cold questioning look in her blue eyes,
  and a slight frown on her proud, delicate face. Something told me that this
  was Rupert Devereux's daughter. And the thought checked the smile which I had
  found some difficulty in repressing.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I startled you," I said, "I am waiting in here to see Colonel
  Devereux, and as I heard my name mentioned I thought it as well to let you
  know that I was here."</p>

  <p>For the life of me I could not meet the laughing gaze of those mischievous
  black eyes without a smile. They seemed to be looking me over from head to
  foot, with an air of decided interest, and finally they looked up into mine,
  as though satisfied with their inspection.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear what we were saying, Mr. Arbuthnot?" she asked, eagerly,
  with a bewitching little smile.</p>

  <p>"How could I help it? I coughed once before, but you did not hear me."</p>

  <p>I glanced for the first time at Maud Devereux, and she inclined her head
  slightly, as though to intimate that she accepted my explanation.</p>

  <p>"It is of no consequence," she said, a little coldly; "we were to blame
  for talking nonsense. I'm ready for another set now, Olive.".</p>

  <p>She turned and moved slowly away to the tennis court without another look
  at me; but the other girl lingered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry for what I said, Mr. Arbuthnot," she remarked. "Of course, I
  didn't mean it, but it is so dull here that one is bound to talk nonsense
  sometimes."</p>

  <p>I bowed, and I am afraid that there was a decided twinkle in my eyes as I
  answered, "Pray don't apologise. You can't imagine how grateful I am for the
  red hair and other etceteras which are to save me from a broken heart."</p>

  <p>She had the grace to blush a little at last, and it made her look
  uncommonly pretty.</p>

  <p>"You're too bad, Mr. Arbuthnot. Good bye."</p>

  <p>And, with a parting glance and smile, she picked up her racket and moved
  away across the lawn towards Maud Devereux, who had never once looked
  round.</p>

  <p>I let the blind fall again, and turned back towards my chair. I had hardly
  reached it before the door opened', and I stood face to face with my
  grandfather, Colonel Sir Francis Devereux.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-13"
     id="ch-13"></a>XIII. &mdash; COLONEL SIR FRANCIS DEVEREUX, BART.</h2>

  <p class="first">For a second everything swam before my eyes, and it always
  seemed to me afterwards a miracle that I recovered myself sufficiently to
  accept his outstretched hand, and mutter some intelligible response to his
  courteous speech of greeting. For the stately, white-haired, military-looking
  man who had entered the room was so like my father that I had very nearly
  called him by name.</p>

  <p>At the sound of my voice he started slightly, and, adjusting an eye-glass,
  looked at me steadily. Then he, too, seemed to receive something of a shock,
  for he turned abruptly away towards the window, and I could see that his long
  white fingers were shaking.</p>

  <p>"I must ask your pardon, Mr. Arbuthnot," he said, suddenly looking round
  and scanning me over again. "The fact is, your appearance recalled some one
  to my mind whom&mdash;whom I have not seen for many years."</p>

  <p>I bowed silently. I understood his emotion better than he imagined, and my
  heart was warming to him in consequence of it.</p>

  <p>"You are welcome to Devereux, sir," he went on, cordially. "I hope you
  find your quarters fairly comfortable."</p>

  <p>I began to thank him for the generosity of his arrangements, but he
  stopped me at once.</p>

  <p>"If you are satisfied, that is well. I hope you will like the place," he
  went on after a moment's pause, "for I think that you will suit me. Mr.
  Andrews will explain what your duties will be on the estate. I don't think
  you'll find them particularly arduous. You shoot, I hope, and hunt, and fish.
  H'm, I thought so. I'm glad to hear it. I wanted some one who would be able
  to show my guests, when I have any, what there is to do about the place, and
  who won't mind a day amongst the stubble with an old man now and then," he
  added pleasantly. "Have you seen anything of the place yet?"</p>

  <p>I told him of my early ride, and that all the impressions I had as yet
  received of the country and its surroundings were pleasant ones. He was
  delighted to hear it, he told me.</p>

  <p>"And your sister. Does she think that she will he able to make herself at
  home here?"</p>

  <p>I assured him that there was very little doubt about that. She had been
  used to the country all her life.</p>

  <p>We talked for a while of the estate, and the share of its management which
  would fall to my lot. There was much that wanted doing, he said, and I was
  glad to hear it, for though I had come here with another ultimate object, I
  had no desire to spend my time in idleness. We talked for a long while, he
  seeming anxious to keep me there, and asking many personal questions which I
  found it not altogether easy to answer. But at last the luncheon bell rang
  out, and then he let me go.</p>

  <p>"I should like to show you round the place myself," he said, as we walked
  down the hall together. "Be ready at three o'clock, and I will call for you.
  We will ride, of course."</p>

  <p>Just as we passed the foot of the great oak staircase which descended into
  the centre of the hall, we came face to face with the two girls who had been
  playing tennis. Sir Francis stopped at once.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Maud, dear, let me introduce you to Mr. Arbuthnot. Mr. Arbuthnot,
  this is my niece, Miss Devereux, and her friend, Lady Olive Parkhurst."</p>

  <p>My cousin bowed very slightly, and scarcely paused in her progress across
  the hall. But Lady Olive lingered to throw a saucy glance at me over her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You two men have wasted a delightful morning gossiping," she said,
  lightly. "Maud and I have been dying with curiosity to know what it's all
  been about."</p>

  <p>Miss Devereux was standing in one of the doorways a little way off, with
  the slightest possible frown of impatience on her face, and looking decidedly
  supercilious at her friend's remark, although she did not take the trouble to
  contradict it. They had both changed their morning gowns for riding habits,
  and though Lady Olive, with her trim, dainty figure and coquettish smile,
  looked sufficiently charming, I could not help my eyes dwelling the longest
  on Maud Devereux. Fair, proud, and cold, with slim yet perfectly graceful
  figure, she reminded me of Tennyson's Princess. It was only for a moment that
  I looked at her, but her eyes chanced to meet mine, and the frown on her
  statuesque young face deepened, as though to admire her even were a liberty.
  I turned away at once, and moved a step nearer the door.</p>

  <p>"We have wasted a beautiful morning, certainly," Sir Francis remarked;
  "but we are going to make up for it this afternoon. Mr. Arbuthnot and I are
  going to ride together on a tour of inspection. Would you young ladies care
  to join us?"</p>

  <p>Lady Olive leaned forward with a beaming smile.</p>

  <p>"I should like it immensely," she declared. "You forget, Olive, that we
  are going to call on the Annerleys this afternoon," remarked Maud Devereux,
  in a cold tone of disapprobation. "Luncheon is quite ready, uncle."</p>

  <p>Lady Olive gathered up her skirts, and, nodding to me with a comical
  grimace, took Sir Francis's arm.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Arbuthnot. I'm so sorry we can't come. I should like to
  see how you manage the Black Prince."</p>

  <p>"You will have plenty of other opportunities," Sir Francis remarked. "Good
  morning, Arbuthnot; be ready about three o'clock."</p>

  <p>And so ended my first visit to Devereux Court.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-14"
     id="ch-14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE BEGINNING OF DANGER</h2>

  <p class="first">Before a month had passed I began to feel quite settled at
  the cottage. My duties, though many, lay within my capacity, and were such as
  I found pleasure in undertaking. It was impossible for me not to see that Sir
  Francis Devereux had taken a great and, to others, an unaccountable fancy to
  me; and occasionally he made such demands upon my time that I found it hard
  to get through my work. But I never grudged him an hour that I could honestly
  spare, for every day the prejudice which I had felt against him grew less,
  and I began to heartily like and pity him. Perhaps this change in my feelings
  towards him arose chiefly from the fact that he was obviously an unhappy man.
  The sorrow which was embittering my father's life and clouding mine had laid
  its hand with almost equal bitterness upon him. And was it not natural? For
  more than twenty years he had never looked upon the face or heard of the son
  whom he had loved better than any one else in the world. The heir of
  Devereux, for all he knew, might have sunk to the lowest depth of vice and
  degradation, and yet for all that, he must bear the title and, if he chose,
  take up his abode in the home where his ancestors had lived with honor, for
  many centuries, and, at the very best there was a deep blot which nothing
  could ever efface. The descendant of a long race of mighty soldiers had been
  publicly pronounced a coward; and yet some day or other, by the inevitable
  law of nature, he would become the representative of his family. To the stern
  old soldier I knew well that the thought was agony, and I longed to reassure
  and comfort him, as I most certainly could have done. But the time was not
  yet come.</p>

  <p>Naturally I saw a good deal of Maud Devereux and Lady Olive, much more of
  the latter than the former, for she appeared to have taken a violent fancy
  for Marian, and was often at the cottage. Conceit was never amongst my
  failings, but of course I could not help noticing that the times she choose
  for coming were those on which I was most likely to be at home, and generally
  when I returned from my day's work I found Marian and her gossiping over the
  fire, or if I was early, indulging in afternoon tea. She seemed determined to
  flirt with me, and I, willing to be amused, let her have her own way. We were
  both perfectly aware that the other was not in earnest, and we both-I
  particularly&mdash;took care not to lapse into the sentimental stage! On the
  whole, we managed to amuse one another very well.</p>

  <p>With Maud Devereux I made but little progress&mdash;in fact, I feared
  sometimes that she even disliked me. She was always the same&mdash;cold,
  unbending, and apparently proud. It seemed impossible to win even a smile
  from her, and the more friendly Lady Olive and I became the more she seemed
  to stand aloof. Once or twice, when I had found myself riding by her side, or
  alone with her for a minute, I had fancied that her manner was changing a
  little. But before I could be sure of it, Lady Olive would bear down on us
  and challenge me to a race, or make some mocking speech.</p>

  <p>Why should it matter to me? I could not tell; yet always at such, times I
  knew that I wished Lady Olive a little further away. Cold and disdainful
  though she was, a minute with her was more to me than hours with Lady Olive.
  And yet she was the daughter of the man whom I hated more than any living
  thing, and on whom I had sworn to be revenged should I fail in the great
  object of my life.</p>

  <p>One evening, when, tired and dusty and stiff, after many hours' riding, I
  walked in to Marian's little drawing-room to beg for a cup of tea before
  changing my things, I had a great surprise. Instead of Lady Olive, Maud
  Devereux was leaning back in an easy chair opposite my sister. Maud, with the
  proud, wearied look gone from her cold blue eyes, and actually laughing a
  soft, pleasant laugh at one of my sister's queer speeches. I stepped forward
  eagerly, and there was actually a shade of something very like embarrassment
  in her face as she leaned forward and held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"You are surprised to see me, Mr. Arbuthnot," she said; "I wanted Olive,
  and thought this the most likely place to find her."</p>

  <p>"We haven't seen her to-day, have we, Hugh?" Marian remarked.</p>

  <p>I assented silently, and spoke of something else. I did not want to talk
  about Lady Olive just then.</p>

  <p>For more than half an hour we sat there sipping our tea, and chatting
  about the new schools which Sir Francis was building in the village, the
  weather, and the close approach of cub-hunting. I could scarcely believe that
  it was indeed Maud Devereux who sat there in my easy chair, looking so
  thoroughly at home and talking so pleasantly. As a rule, the only words I had
  been able to win from her were cold monosyllables, and the only looks
  half-impatient, half-contemptuous ones.</p>

  <p>At last she rose to go, and I walked with her to the gate. It was almost
  dusk, and I felt that under the circumstances I might offer to walk up to the
  house with her. But I felt absolutely timid about proposing what with Lady
  Olive would have been a matter of course.</p>

  <p>I did propose it, however, and was not a little disappointed at the
  passive indifference with which my escort was accepted. But what I should
  have resented from Lady Olive I accepted humbly from her.</p>

  <p>Side by side we walked through the park, and I could think of nothing to
  say to her, nothing that I dared say. With Lady Olive there would have been a
  thousand light nothings to bandy backwards and forwards, but what man living
  would have dared to speak them to Maud Devereux? Not I, at any rate.</p>

  <p>Once she spoke; carelessly, as though for the sake of speaking.</p>

  <p>"What spell holds Mr. Arbuthnot silent so long? A penny for your
  thoughts!" and I answered thoughtlessly.</p>

  <p>"They are worth more, Miss Devereux, for they are of you. I was thinking
  that this was the first time I had walked alone with you."</p>

  <p>"I am not Lady Olive," she said, coldly. "Be so good, Mr. Arbuthnot, as to
  reserve such speeches for her."</p>

  <p>She quickened her pace a little, and I could have bitten my tongue out for
  my folly. But she was not angry for long, for at the gate which led from the
  park into the ground she paused.</p>

  <p>Devereux Court, with its lofty battlements and huge stacks of chimneys,
  toweled above us&mdash;every window a burnished sheet of red fire, for the
  setting sun was lingering around it, and bathing it with its last parting
  rays as though loth to go.</p>

  <p>"What a grand old place it is!" I said half to myself; "I shall be sorry
  to leave it."</p>

  <p>She turned round quickly, and there was actually a shade of interest in
  her tone.</p>

  <p>"You are not thinking of going away, are you, Mr. Arbuthnot? I thought you
  got on so well with my uncle."</p>

  <p>"Ay, too well," I answered bitterly, for I was thinking of my father and
  hers. "There is a great work which lies before me, Miss Devereux, and I fear
  that I shall do little towards it down here. Life is too pleasant
  altogether&mdash;dangerously pleasant."</p>

  <p>"And yet you work hard, my uncle says," she observed; "too hard, he says
  sometimes. You look tired to-night."</p>

  <p>I might well, for I had ridden over thirty miles without a rest; but I
  would have ridden another thirty to have won another such glance from her
  sweet blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"A moment's pleasure is worth a day's work," I said, recklessly, "and I
  have had nearly an hour's."</p>

  <p>She opened the gate and passed through at once with a gesture of
  contempt.</p>

  <p>"If you cannot remember, Mr. Arbuthnot, that I am not Lady Oliver and that
  such speeches only appear ridiculous to me, I think you had better go home,"
  she said, coldly.</p>

  <p>I looked down&mdash;tall though I was, it was not far to stoop&mdash;into
  her slightly flushed face, and through the dusky twilight I could see her
  eyes sparkling with a gleam of indignation. She was-right to say that I had
  better go home&mdash;nay, I had better never have started. What had come over
  me that I should find my heart throbbing with pleasure to be alone with the
  daughter of the man whom I hated? It was treachery to my father, and, as the
  thought of him wandering about in his weary exile rushed into my mind, a
  sudden shame laid hold of me. I drew myself up, and strode along in silence,
  speaking never another word until we reached the gate leading on to the lawn.
  Then I opened it, and raising my cap with a half-mechanical gesture, stood
  aside, to let her pass.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr. Arbuthnot."</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Miss Devereux."</p>

  <p>It might have been merely a fancy, but it seemed to me that she lingered
  for a second, as though expecting me to say something else. And though I was
  gazing fixedly over her head, I knew well that her eyes were raised to mine.
  But I stood silent and frowning, waiting only for her to pass on, and so she
  went without another word.</p>

  <p>I watched her, fair and stately, walking with swift, graceful steps along
  the gravel path. Then I turned my back upon the spot where she had vanished,
  and, leaning against the low iron gate, let my face fall upon my folded
  arms.</p>

  <p>Of all the mental tortures which a man can undergo, what is there worse
  than the agony of self-reproach? To be condemned by another's judgment may
  seem to us comparatively a light thing&mdash;but to be condemned by our own,
  what escape or chance of escape can there be from that! And it seemed to me
  as though I were arraigned before the tribunal of any own conscience. As
  clearly as though indeed he stood there, I saw before me the bowed form and
  unhappy face of my poor father, looking steadfastly at me out of his sad blue
  eyes, with the story of his weary suffering life written with deep lines into
  his furrowed face. And then I saw myself standing at the window of my rooms
  in Exeter, with an oath ringing from my lips, and a passionate purpose
  stirring my heart, and last of all I saw myself only a few minutes ago
  walking by her side with stirred pulses and bounding heart&mdash;by her side,
  whose father, curse him! was the man above all others whom I should hate-for
  was it not his lying word which had driven Herbert Devereux from his home,
  and blasted a life more precious to me than my own! At that moment a
  passionate longing came upon me to stand face to face with him, the man whom
  we had met in the moonlight on Exmoor, and tear the truth from his lying
  throat.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot!"</p>

  <p>I started violently and turned round pale and agitated, with the rage
  which was burning within me. Maud Devereux stood before me&mdash;Maud, with
  the pride gone out from her exquisite face, and the warming light of a kindly
  sympathy shining out of her glorious eyes.</p>

  <p>"I startled you, Mr. Arbuthnot?"</p>

  <p>"I must confess that you did, Miss Devereux. I thought that I was
  alone."</p>

  <p>I had drawn myself up to my full-height, and was looking steadily at her,
  determined that, neither by word nor look, would I yield to the charm of her
  altered manner; It was I now who was proud and cold; she who was eager and a
  little nervous.</p>

  <p>"I had a message to deliver to you, and I forgot it," she said, hurriedly.
  "I was to ask you to dine with us to-night."</p>

  <p>"Does Sir Francis particularly wish it?" I asked. "Because, if not, as I
  have had a long day, and am rather tired&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted me, speaking with a sudden hauteur, and with all the
  coldness of her former manner.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that he particularly wishes it, but he has brought Lord
  Annerley home with him to talk over the Oadby Common matter, so you had
  better come."</p>

  <p>Lord Annerley was the eldest son of a neighboring landholder between whom
  and myself, as agent of Sir Francis Devereux, there had arisen a friendly
  dispute as to the right of way over a certain common, and I knew at once that
  I must not miss the opportunity of meeting him.</p>

  <p>"Very good, Miss Devereux," I answered, "I will go home and change my
  things at once."</p>

  <p>"Without Speaking to me?" I turned abruptly round. Lady Olive had come
  softly over the smooth turf, and was looking up into my face with a
  mischievous smile.</p>

  <p>"How cross you both look!" she exclaimed. "Have you been quarrelling?"</p>

  <p>"Quarrelling! Scarcely," I answered, laughing lightly. "Miss Devereux and
  I have no subject in common which we should be likely to discuss, far less to
  quarrel about. Wherever did you get such beautiful chrysanthemums, Lady
  Olive?"</p>

  <p>She buried her piquant little face in the mass of white and bronze blooms,
  and then divided them.</p>

  <p>"From the south garden. Aren't they lovely? See, Mr. Arbuthnot. I want you
  to take half of them to your sister, if you don't mind. I don't think you
  have any cut yet, and the colors of these are so exquisite. Which do you like
  the better, Maud, the white or the bronze?"</p>

  <p>"The white, of course," she answered, scarcely looking at them. "I don't
  care for the other color at all."</p>

  <p>"And I prefer it," Lady Olive went on, filling my outstretched hands. "Mr.
  Arbuthnot, did I gather correctly from what you were saying when I came up
  that you dine with us to-night?"</p>

  <p>"I am to have that happiness, Lady Olive," I answered; "and if I don't
  hurry off now, I'm afraid I shall be late."</p>

  <p>"Then don't stop another moment," she laughed. "But, Mr.
  Arbuthnot&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I halted resignedly and turned round.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing, only Maud and I expect you to show us this evening whose
  taste you choose to follow."</p>

  <p>"In what respect?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, chrysanthemums, of course! Maud has chosen white, I have chosen
  bronze. We shall both look out eagerly to see whose colors you wear in your
  buttonhole to-night. If you wear a white one, I sha'n't speak to you all the
  evening. Mind, I warn you."</p>

  <p>"What nonsense you talk, Olive!" said Maud, carelessly, but with a slight
  flush rising into her cheeks. "As if it could make the slightest possible
  difference to me which color Mr. Arbuthnot prefers in chrysanthemums!"</p>

  <p>There was a distinct vein of contempt in her concluding sentence, and Lady
  Olive, noticing it, looked at us both in surprise.</p>

  <p>"It is my positive conviction," she declared, with mock seriousness,
  "that, notwithstanding Mr. Arbuthnot's high-flown repudiation, yon two have
  been quarrelling."</p>

  <p>Maud Devereux turned impatiently away, with a scornful shrug of her
  shoulders, and walked slowly towards the house. Lady Olive started to follow
  her, but at the gate she paused.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot, come here, I want to speak to you."</p>

  <p>I retraced my steps, of course, and stood by her side.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>She stood on tiptoe and whispered&mdash;quite an unnecessary proceeding,
  for Maud was a dozen yards away.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot, what have you and Maud been quarrelling about?"</p>

  <p>I turned round so abruptly, that our heads knocked together and my
  moustache brushed her cheek.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot!"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't my fault," I assured her, truthfully.</p>

  <p>"Sure!"</p>

  <p>She was looking up at me with a half coquettish, altogether inviting
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Quite. Shall I show you how it happened?" I asked, stooping down till my
  face was very close to hers.</p>

  <p>"What color chrysanthemums are you going to wear this evening, Mr.
  Arbuthnot?" she asked, rather irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>"Can you ask? Bronze, of course."</p>

  <p>"Well, then&mdash;yes&mdash;I think you may show me&mdash;just so that it
  sha'n't happen again, you know," she added, with laughing eyes.</p>

  <p>And so I showed her, just as a matter of precaution, and received for my
  reward a not very hard box on the ears, and a saucy, mock-angry backward
  glance as she broke away from me and hurried after Maud. Then I strode across
  the park, angry with myself, yet fiercely exultant, for I knew that Maud had
  been lingering in the shrubbery alone, and had seen us. She would know now,
  if she did not before, that the grief which she must have read in my face
  when she had returned so unexpectedly was none of her causing, else had I
  never let my lips rest for a second on Lady Olive's cheek.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-15"
     id="ch-15"></a>XV. &mdash; A FLIGHT FOR LIFE</h2>

  <p class="first">In less than an hour I was back at Devereux Court. The gong
  was booming through the hall as I reached the drawing room, and the little
  party had already risen to their feet. Maud's hand was resting on the
  coat-sleeve of a man scarcely as tall as herself, with a fair insipid-looking
  face and weak eyes&mdash;whom I knew at once must be Lord Annerley. Sir
  Francis, who was suffering from a bad attack of gout, was leaning half on his
  stick, half on Lady Olive's bare white shoulder; but, at my entrance, he
  withdrew his hand, and she stepped back, rubbing her arm with a comical air
  of relief.</p>

  <p>"Just in time, Arbuthnot! Come and give me your arm, there's a good
  fellow. Annerley, this is Mr. Arbuthnot, my agent."</p>

  <p>Lord Annerley returned my greeting with a slightly patronising air, and
  then we walked across the hall to the dining-room, Sir Francis leaning
  heavily on my shoulder.</p>

  <p>Maud had noticed me only by the merest inclination of her stately head,
  and during dinner time she never addressed a single observation to me, her
  attention seeming wholly absorbed by her companion. Lady Olive, although at
  first she rattled on in her usual style, seemed always watching for an
  opportunity to join in their conversation, and when at last she found it,
  seemed almost to forget my existence. They talked of people whom I did not
  know, and subjects in which I had no interest, but I was well content to be
  left alone. I was in no mood for talking, and to answer Sir Francis's few
  inquiries was quite enough for me.</p>

  <p>We were about half way through dinner, when suddenly Sir Francis held up
  his finger and cried, "Hush!"</p>

  <p>Every one stopped talking, and I who had also heard the sound sprung to my
  feet. It came again in a second or two, three sharp reports from the
  direction of the park.</p>

  <p>"Poachers, by G&mdash;d!" exclaimed Sir Francis, angrily, "and in the home
  spinneys, too! The cheeky rascals!"</p>

  <p>I was half way across the room before he had finished speaking.</p>

  <p>"Take care of yourself, my boy," he called out, earnestly. "You'll find my
  revolver in the top drawer of my cabinet in the library. See that it's
  loaded. By Jove, I wish my foot was right! Annerley, I don't know whether you
  care about a row as much as I did when I was a youngster; but if you do, pray
  go with Arbuthnot. My niece will excuse yon."</p>

  <p>Lord Annerley did not seem to find that keen prospect of pleasure in the
  affray, which was doubtless proceeding, that Sir Francis would certainly have
  done, for as I hurried from the room I heard him mutter something about his
  boots being rather thin. An irresistible impulse made me glance for a moment
  into Maud's face whilst he was elaborately excusing himself, and I was
  satisfied. A slight but distinctly contemptuous expression had stolen into
  it.</p>

  <p>I was scarcely a moment in the library, for the revolver was in its place
  and loaded. As I hurried down the hall, Sir Francis hobbled out of the
  drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"Arbuthnot," he called out anxiously after me, "I've just remembered
  Atkins and Crooks are both away to-night; I gave 'em a holiday; so old Heggs
  and his son must be alone in the home spinneys. Those d&mdash;d rascals must
  have known of it. I'll send the men after you, but run, or you'll be too
  late!"</p>

  <p>There was no need to tell me to run. Holding my revolver clenched in my
  right hand, I dashed across the gardens toward the park, leaping over the
  flower-beds, and using my left hand to vault over locked gates and fences. I
  had scarcely reached the park when I heard the almost simultaneous report of
  three or four guns, and immediately afterwards, the moon shining in a
  cloudless sky, showed me the figure of a man leap from one of the dark belts
  of plantation at the head of the slope, and make for the open country. My
  first impulse was to strike off to the right hand and intercept him; but
  before I had gone half a dozen yards out of my way, I changed my intention,
  for from the interior of the plantation came a hoarse, despairing cry for
  help, followed by another gunshot.</p>

  <p>I was a good runner, and I strained every nerve to reach the spinneys. But
  when at last, panting but eager, I dashed up the slope, and leaped over the
  low stone wall, a fear came upon me that I was too late.</p>

  <p>At first it was too dark to see anything, for the moon's light could not
  penetrate through the thickly-growing black fir trees. But close in front of
  me I could hear the sound of muttered curses and the trampling of feet upon
  the dried leaves and snapping twigs. A dozen hasty strides forward, and I
  burst through the bushes into a small clearing, and found myself in the thick
  of the struggle.</p>

  <p>On the ground, only a few feet from me, lay Heggs, groaning heavily, with
  his leg doubled up under him. Close by his son was struggling desperately
  with two powerfully built, villainous looking men, and on the ground were
  stretched the forms of two others, one, an under-keeper, writhing about in
  pain, and the other, whose face was unknown to me, lying quite still, and
  evidently insensible. Two other men were hastily filling a bag with their
  spoil, one holding it open, and the other collecting the birds from a broken
  net on the ground and throwing them in.</p>

  <p>The sound of my rapid approach naturally changed the situation. The two
  men struggling with young Heggs relapsed their grasp for a moment to look
  round, and with, a great effort he wrenched himself free, and stood back
  panting. The others who were filling the bag started up as though to run, but
  seeing I was alone hesitated, and one of them snatching up a gun commenced
  hastily to load. But his companion, who appeared to be the leader, yelled to
  him with an oath to put it down.</p>

  <p>"Put your barker down, you fool!" he shouted. "We shall have the whole
  blooming lot down here if we get using them any more. It's only one of the
  fine birds from the Court! We'll soon settle him."</p>

  <p>One of the men who had been filling the bag sprang up, and, holding his
  gun by the barrel, rushed at me. Suddenly he stopped and cowered back, for he
  looked full into the dark muzzle of my revolver. I would have spared him, but
  the odds were too desperate. There was a sharp report, and the arm which held
  his weapon sunk helplessly to his side. He staggered back with a howl of
  pain, and then, turning away, bounded into the thicket.</p>

  <p>"You are at my mercy," I cried, to the others. "Stay where you are, or I
  shall fife."</p>

  <p>An oath was the only answer, and then two of the men rushed at me, whilst
  another, turning away to escape, was seized, by young Heggs, who had been
  leaning, panting, against a tree. The desperate struggle which followed I
  could never describe in doe tail. One of my assailants I should certainly
  have shot through the heart, but that in the sudden shock of recognising him
  my hand swerved, and the bullet only grazed his cheek. Backwards and
  forwards, amongst the bushes and on the ground, we struggled and fought. But
  for my Devonshire training in boxing and wrestling, I must have been
  overpowered at once, for the men who had attacked me were fighting like wild
  beasts for their liberty&mdash;biting, kicking, and dealing out sledge-hammer
  blows, any one of which, had it struck me, would have sent me down like a
  log. Heggs could render me no assistance, for, wearied with his long
  struggle, he was over-matched himself, and in desperate straits. Suddenly
  there came the sound of voices, and feet clambering over the low stone wall.
  With a giant effort the taller of the two men with whom I had been struggling
  flung me backwards amongst the bushes, and bounded away, leaping the wall and
  scudding away across the park. But in my fall I never relaxed my grasp upon
  the other man, and together we rolled over and over in a fierce embrace, his
  teeth almost meeting in my hand, which held him firmly by the throat.</p>

  <p>It was all over for help had come. Nearly a dozen of the servants and
  stablemen from the Court poured into the enclosure, some taking up the
  pursuit, some making preparations to carry Heggs and the other wounded man up
  to the house, some tying together the hands, and zealously guarding my
  prisoner, and all plying me with eager questions. My recollection of all that
  directly followed is obscure. I remember staggering across the park up to the
  Court, and meeting Sir Francis, anxious yet thankful, in the courtyard. Then
  faint and giddy, the blood pouring from a wound in my head down my
  shirtfront, and my clothes torn and soiled, I sank down upon a couch in the
  hall, whilst Sir Francis, with his own hand, strove to force some brandy down
  my throat. A deadly, sickening unconsciousness was creeping over me; there
  was a singing in my ears, and a buzzing in my head. But although every one
  and everything around me seemed to my reeling senses confused and chaotic,
  one person, I saw as vividly as my eyes could show her to me. First standing
  in the open doorway, then close to my side, I saw her with white, pitying
  face, and an agony of terror in her dimmed blue eyes, gazing at my
  shirt-front soaked with blood, and asking eagerly, with quivering lips, where
  I was hurt. And my last effort was to force a ghastly smile and to utter
  reassuring words, which died away half-uttered and altogether
  incomprehensible upon my lips. Then black darkness surged in upon me,
  blotting her out from my sight, and I swooned.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-16"
     id="ch-16"></a>XVI. &mdash; MY CONVALESCENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">For three days and nights I lay at Devereux Court in danger
  of my life, but at the end of that time the concussion of the brain from
  which I was suffering suddenly abated, and I commenced to make rapid strides
  towards recovery. Everything that skill and kindness could do for me was
  done. Marian was my principal nurse, but often in the afternoons Lady Olive
  and Maud would come and sit with me, whilst more than once I woke up to find
  Sir Francis Devereux himself by my side.</p>

  <p>As soon as I was well enough to talk I asked eagerly whether any of the
  other poachers had been taken. Sir Francis shook his head, and looked
  severe.</p>

  <p>"Not one of them," he declared in a vexed tone. "I scarcely have patience
  to speak about it at the police office, it seems so scandalous. A thick-head
  set of muffs they must be!"</p>

  <p>How surprised he would have been if any one had told him his answer was a
  great relief to me&mdash;and yet it was so. There was one man among that gang
  of poachers whom I did not wish to be caught.</p>

  <p>"And was Heggs much hurt?" I asked. Sir Francis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The old man was cut about a bit, but not seriously injured.
  Richard&mdash;that's the son, you know&mdash;came off very easily, and was
  able to tell us all about it. Can't say much about it, Arbuthnot, my boy, for
  the doctor has given orders that there's to be no talking; but you behaved
  splendidly, just as I should like my own son to have behaved," he added, in a
  somewhat husky tone.</p>

  <p>"What's become of the man they caught?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Remanded without bail until you can give evidence, which you won't be
  able to do just yet," was the reply. "And now you're not to talk any more.
  Not another word, sir," he added, sharply, in a tone of command which he
  often used, and which came naturally from him, as it does from any born
  soldier. And, of course, I obeyed.</p>

  <p>The short period of my illness was made as pleasant for me as kindness and
  every luxury could make it. Marian was given a room close to mine, and Sir
  Francis had also insisted upon sending for a trained nurse from York
  Infirmary. All night she sat up with me, although it was quite unnecessary,
  for all symptoms of the brain fever, which the doctor had feared was
  impending, had disappeared, and I invariably slept well. And all day Marion
  was with me, whilst Lady Olive and, more rarely, Maud Devereux paid me
  occasional visits.</p>

  <p>My most regular, dally visitor, though, was Sir Francis himself. Every
  afternoon I woke up from my doze to see his tall, stately figure moving
  softly about the room, or sitting in the high-backed chair by my side. And
  sometimes I found him with his eyes fixed upon me, watching me with a
  half-curious, half tender light softening his fine stern face. Then I knew
  that he was thinking of my father, and I found it hard to refrain from
  clasping his hand and telling him who I was, and the whole truth about that
  miserable day so many years ago. But I remembered that he had heard it from
  my father, and called him a liar. I remembered that to his soldierly notion
  the court-martial was a court infallible, a tribunal which could not err, and
  I kept my mouth closed.</p>

  <p>To others the obvious fancy which Sir Francis had taken for me seemed
  inexplicable. I alone, could guess&mdash;nay, knew the reason. Marian and
  Lady Olive sometimes jested with me about it, but Maud never referred to it.
  In those days of my convalescence it seemed to me almost as though her wild
  face, when I had lain fainting in the hall, must have been a dream. She was
  kind, but in a proud, languid way; she talked to me, but in a monotonous,
  measured manner, and with a cold gleam in her deep blue eyes. She moved about
  my room with the stately grace of a princess, but of a princess who is
  stooping to perform a conscientious duty which she finds very wearisome.</p>

  <p>And yet, when she was there all was glaring light, and my heart was
  beating with the pleasure of her presence, and, when she was gone, the room
  seemed dark, and cold, and cheerless, and the light went out of my eyes and
  from my heart.</p>

  <p>During those long days of forced inaction many thoughts troubled me. Not a
  single line had I heard from my father since our parting at Exeter, and his
  worn, suffering, face haunted me day and night, and filled me with a vague
  self-reproach. True, little time had gone by yet, and I had already moved one
  step forward towards the accomplishment of my sworn purpose. But Maud
  Devereux, was she not the daughter of the man whom we had met on Exmoor, the
  daughter of my Uncle Rupert, the man who had blasted my father's life and
  thrown a long shadow over my own! It was a thought which made me toss about
  restless and uneasy, and filled me with a vague discontent. I never asked
  myself why&mdash;I doubt whether I knew, but all the same the feeling was
  there.</p>

  <p>One afternoon, just as I was getting a little stronger and able to move
  about, Sir Francis Devereux gave me the opportunity which I had often
  coveted. He alluded indirectly to his son. Summoning up all my courage, I
  asked him a question.</p>

  <p>"Will your son&mdash;Mr. Rupert Devereux, isn't it?&mdash;be down before
  the shooting is all over, Sir Francis?" I asked.</p>

  <p>His face changed at once. From the courteous, sympathising friend he
  became the stiff, dignified aristocrat. His lips were set firmly together,
  and there was a decided contraction of his black-grey eyebrows. Altogether,
  he looked as though he had suddenly remembered that I was a comparative
  stranger, and only his land agent, from whom a personal question of any sort
  was a decided impertinence.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," he answered, curtly, "my son never visits Devereux."</p>

  <p>"And yet it will be his some day," I could not help remarking.</p>

  <p>"It will not be his some day. Devereux Court, at my death, will pass, into
  the hands of another son of mine, or his heir. Would to God it could crumble
  into dust first!" the old man added, with a sudden burst of bitterness.</p>

  <p>I could not tell what answer to make, so I remained silent. But I suppose
  my face must have told him that I was eager to hear more. He rose, and walked
  up and down the room several times, my eyes anxiously following every
  movement. How like he was to my father! Age had wonderfully little bent his
  figure. There was the same grace of limb and carriage that I had often
  admired in my father when we had been striding side by side across the
  heather-covered moors, the same long, finely-carved features, and the same
  look of trouble stamped on the brow. But in my father's case it was developed
  somewhat differently. It had filled his eyes with a weary, long-suffering
  look which seemed to speak of absolute despair, and unvarying, hopeless
  grief. There was more of bitterness and concentrated irritation in Sir
  Francis's face.</p>

  <p>It seemed as though the sorrow would not settle into his being, but was
  continually lashing him into acute and active, wretchedness. Which was the
  harder to bear, I wonder?</p>

  <p>Suddenly Sir Francis stopped short in the middle of the room, and turned
  round to me.</p>

  <p>"Arbuthnot, my boy," he said, kindly, "I'll tell you about my two sons, if
  you care to hear the story, in a few words."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing I should like so well to hear, Sir Francis," I answered
  in a low tone.</p>

  <p>He drew near to me and sat down.</p>

  <p>"I've taken a strange fancy to you, Arbuthnot," he said, slowly; "I feel
  that I should like you to know an old man's sorrow."</p>

  <p>His voice was very low indeed, and it seemed to me that his eyes were dim.
  Then he began speaking in short sentences, as was his wont, but with less
  than his usual curtness.</p>

  <p>I have been married twice, and by each wife I had a son. Herbert was the
  name of the elder, Rupert of the younger. Herbert's mother was the daughter
  of an English nobleman, and he grew up as fine a young Englishman as ever
  walked on God's earth, and a Devereux to the backbone. Rupert's mother was a
  Spanish lady, and he resembled her rather than me. Perhaps you will not be
  surprised when I tell you that, although I concealed it as much as possible,
  Herbert was the son I loved.</p>

  <p>"I made them both enter the army directly they were old enough. Ours is a
  fighting family, and from the days of the Conqueror there has always been a
  Devereux ready to fight for his country. There, in the picture gallery, you
  may see them all, a magnificent race&mdash;ay, though I call them so&mdash;of
  knights and cavaliers and generals. Never has there been a battle fought in
  English history but a Devereux has borne arms in it. I myself was at
  Inkermann, and led my regiment on into Sebastopol. A glorious time it
  was."</p>

  <p>He stopped for a moment with sparkling eyes, and a pleased smile on his
  lips, as though enjoying keenly his recollection. Then his face clouded over
  again, and his head drooped. The change was so complete and such a sad one
  that my heart ached for him, and I turned my head away. He continued in an
  altered tone.</p>

  <p>"Well, I made them both soldiers, and when the time came for them to go
  abroad and see active service I parted with them without a pang. In less than
  six mouths Herbert, my eldest son, Herbert Devereux, returned, disgraced,
  turned out of his regiment&mdash;a coward."</p>

  <p>Never had I heard anything so pathetic as the pang with which he seemed to
  part with this last word. His voice was shaking, and there was a hot color in
  his cheeks. Suddenly he turned his back upon me, and I heard a sob.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe it?" I asked, excitedly. "Was it proved? Was there no
  shadow of doubt?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "None. My oldest friend was bound to pronounce him
  guilty in open court-martial. It was the bitterest duty he ever performed, he
  told me long afterwards. But a soldier's duty stands high above all personal
  feelings. Had I been in his place I should have pronounced the same verdict
  that he did, though my heart had snapped in two."</p>

  <p>"On whose evidence was he convicted?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Sir Francis groaned.</p>

  <p>"On his own brother's. It was Rupert's word which convicted him. Rupert's
  word which has pulled down into the dust the name which through centuries and
  centuries has stood as high in honor and chivalry as any name in Europe. God
  forgive him! He only did his duly, but I cannot bear to look upon his face.
  Not that he wants to come here! He is a foreigner, and he lives in a foreign
  country. He is only half my son! It is Herbert whom I loved."</p>

  <p>"And where is he&mdash;Herbert?" I asked, fearfully.</p>

  <p>"Dead, I hope," he answered, sternly. "Since the day when I heard of this
  disgrace I have never looked upon his face. I never wish to look upon it
  again. For five-and-twenty years no one has dared to mention his name in my
  presence. I have cursed him."</p>

  <p>"But if lie lives, he is your eldest son, Devereux will be his?"</p>

  <p>"A passionate fire leaped into Sir Francis's face.</p>

  <p>"Never. If I thought that he lived and would come here when I died I would
  fire Devereux Court, though I perished in it. I would cram it full to the
  windows with dynamite, and leave not one stone standing upon another, sooner
  than he should enter its doors the head of the Devereuxs. You don't
  understand this feeling, perhaps, Arbuthnot," he went on in a lower voice,
  which was still, however, vibrating with an intense passion, "some day I will
  take you info the picture gallery with me, and then perhaps you will
  understand it a little better."</p>

  <p>"I understand it now, Sir Francis," I told him, "but&mdash;but you are
  sure that your son Herbert was guilty? Think of the difference which his
  disgrace meant to Rupert. It made him your heir, Virtually your only son. If
  he was of a jealous disposition-Spanish people are, they say&mdash;the
  opportunity of getting rid of Herbert for ever and of taking his place might
  have tempted him."</p>

  <p>I am convinced that the idea which I falteringly suggested to Sir Francis
  Devereux had never in the vaguest way presented itself to him before. Nor was
  this wonderful. Courteous and polished man of the world though he was, his
  nature had preserved all the innate and magnificent simplicity of the ideal
  soldier. Falsehood and meanness were so utterly beneath him that he never
  looked for them in others. They represented qualities of which be knew
  nothing. Any one could have cheated him, but if by chance detected, the crime
  would have seemed to him unpardonable, and from him they would never have won
  forgiveness. Herbert, the son whom he loved, had told him a lie&mdash;a
  court-martial of his fellow-soldiers had determined that it was so&mdash;and
  the crime had seemed to him scarcely less black than the cowardice. He had
  never doubted it for one reason, because the decision of a court-martial was
  to him infallible, and for another, because the idea of falsehood in
  connection with his other son had never been suggested to him, and save from
  another's lips could never have entered into his mind.</p>

  <p>I watched the lightning change in his face eagerly. A ray of sudden
  startling hope chased the first look of astonishment from his face, but it
  was replaced in its turn by a heavy frown and a tightening of the lips.</p>

  <p>"We are not a race of liars," he began, sternly.</p>

  <p>"But, if Rupert lied, Herbert was neither liar nor coward," I
  interrupted.</p>

  <p>He looked at me in such a way that I could say no more.</p>

  <p>"There was another witness beside Rupert&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rupert's servant," I faltered, but he took no notice.</p>

  <p>"And I should never dream of doubting the court-martial's decision. I've
  told you this story, Arbuthnot. I don't know why exactly; but I forbid you
  ever to mention it to me again. Ah, Miss Marian, you see I have been keeping
  your brother company for a long while this afternoon."</p>

  <p>He had risen to his feet with old-fashioned courtesy as my sister entered
  the room, and had held a chair for her by my sofa. Then, after a few more
  pleasant words, he nodded kindly to me and went. If he had stayed five
  minutes longer I might have told him all.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-17"
     id="ch-17"></a>XVII. &mdash; A MOONLIGHT RIDE</h2>

  <p class="first">Before a month had passed I was able to get about, and was
  soon as well and strong as ever. I gave my evidence before a full bench of
  the county magistrates, identified the man in custody, and gave descriptions
  in all cases but one sufficiently clear of the men who were still at large.
  The local papers had made a great stir about the whole affair, and when the
  court was over most of the magistrates came up to shake hands with me, and I
  found myself quite a celebrity. For a full month afterwards invitations to
  dinner and shooting parties came pouring in upon me, and Lady Olive was never
  tired of chaffing me about my reputed achievements. But the more friendly
  Lady Olive became, both with Marian and myself, the less we saw of Maud
  Devereux. I told myself that I was glad of it, but I was a hypocrite. More
  than once lately I had reined in my cob, and from a distance watched her
  riding home from a day's hunting, with Lord Annerley by her side, and had
  cursed him under my breath for an insolent puppy. Since the night when he had
  dined at Devereux Court he seemed to have taken a strong dislike to me. I had
  met him afterwards and nodded, and in return had received an insolent stare.
  At first I bad been tempted to lay my riding whip across his face, but I
  quoted Tennyson to myself instead and laughed.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Scorn'd to be scorned by one that I scorn,<br>
  Is that a matter to make me fret?<br>
  That a calamity hard to be borne?<br>
  Well, he may live to hate me yet.</p><br>

  <p>And Lord Annerley did live to hate me, and before very long too, for one
  afternoon as I was riding home in the dusk I met Maud and him face to face at
  one of the entrances to the park. She bowed to me coldly, but Lord Annerley
  looked straight between his horse's ears without even acknowledging my
  salutation. Instantly she turned round to me.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot."</p>

  <p>I pulled the Black Prince on his haunches, and brought him round to her
  side.</p>

  <p>"Are you not going our way? It is a long way round by the road unless you
  want to call in the village."</p>

  <p>I was too surprised to think of any excuse, so I turned my horse's
  head.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose the park's the shorter way. I ought to have remembered it
  for the Black Prince's sake," I remarked. "I'm afraid he's rather done
  up."</p>

  <p>"I thought that you two had met," she said, turning to her companion.
  "Lord Annerley, you know Mr. Arbuthnot, do you not?"</p>

  <p>He turned stiffly round towards me with an angry flush on his cheek.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;yes. How d'ye do, Arbuthnot?"</p>

  <p>I sat bolt upright in my saddle, and looked steadily at Lord Annerley,
  without returning his insolent greeting.</p>

  <p>"My name is Arbuthnot, certainly," I said, coldly, "but your lordship will
  pardon my observing that I am not accustomed to hear it taken such liberties
  with."</p>

  <p>I raised my hat to Miss Devereux, and digging spurs into Black Prince's
  side, rode on ahead. But I had scarcely gone a quarter of a mile before I
  heard a single-horse's hoofs close behind, and looking round saw Maud riding
  up to me, alone, I reined in at once and waited for her.</p>

  <p>She joined me without a word, and we walked our horses side by side in
  silence. There was a change in her face, which puzzled me; a faint tinge of
  pink was coloring her cheeks, and a peculiar smile, half of amusement, half,
  of satisfaction, parted slightly her lips. Her eyes she kept averted from
  me.</p>

  <p>"Where is Lord Annerley?" I asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Gone home," she answered demurely.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've spoilt your ride," I said. "I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," she answered, still without looking at me. "You spoilt his,
  I think."</p>

  <p>"I answered nothing. I dared not. I felt that there was safety for me only
  in silence. And so we rode on, our horses' feet sinking silently into the
  short, green turf as we cantered slowly through the park. From behind the
  dark plantations on our right the moon had risen into a clear sky, and every
  now and then the Black Prince started and shied slightly at the grotesque
  shadows cast by the giant oak trees under which we rode. Where they were
  thickest a few bats flew out and wheeled for a minute or two round our heads
  before disappearing in the opposite, thickets.</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid to talk to me, Mr. Arbuthnot, or can't you think of
  anything to say?" Maud suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>The words which I intended to speak died away on my lips. A subtle power
  seemed to be struggling with my will and intoxicating my senses. I answered
  blindly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I am afraid to talk to you, Miss Devereux, because I have too much to
  say."</p>

  <p>She turned round and looked at me, her deep blue eyes full of a
  half-inviting, half-mocking light which nearly drove me mad. She, at any
  rate, was quite at her ease.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to try and flirt with me, Mr. Arbuthnot?" she asked
  lightly. "I am not Lady Olive."</p>

  <p>Just then the Black Prince shied as we rode across the shadow of a
  gigantic oak tree, and we were so close together that our horses's heads
  nearly touched. One of her shapely hands was hanging carelessly down, toying
  with her whip, and, scarcely knowing what I did, I caught hold of it and held
  it to my lips. She drew it away, but she might have drawn it away a second
  sooner had she chosen.</p>

  <p>"You are a presumptuous boy," she said, looking at me with a curious,
  half-puzzled light in her glorious eyes. "If you don't behave yourself I
  shall begin to be sorry that I sent Lord Annerley away. He wouldn't have done
  such a stupid thing as that, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"He'd better not," I said, fiercely. She laughed mockingly. I would have
  given anything to have been able to keep back the words which were fast
  rising from my swelling heart to my lips, but I seemed to have lost all
  control over myself. A fatal, irresistible impulse was luring me on.</p>

  <p>"Maud&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"''Mr.' Arbuthnot," with, a stress upon the Mr.</p>

  <p>I leaned over to her, and strove to look in to her face, but she kept it
  turned from me.</p>

  <p>"Maud, dearest!"</p>

  <p>She turned round suddenly, with a curious contradiction of expressions in
  her face. Her eyes still seemed to mock me with a delusive tenderness, but
  her lips were close set, and her head thrown proudly back.</p>

  <p>"That is quite enough, Mr. Arbuthnot! Must I remind you again that I am
  not Lady Olive? I have never studied the art of flirting, and I don't think
  I'll begin with you. You're far too accomplished."</p>

  <p>In vain I tried to analyse the look she threw me as she struck her horse
  sharply, and rode away from me. It was contemptuous and tender, angry and
  laughing, serious and mocking. I dug spurs into Black Prince's side; but he
  was done up, whilst she was on her second horse. It was not until we were
  actually in the shrubbery grounds that I caught her up.</p>

  <p>"One word, Miss Devereux," I begged, riding up to her side, "you are not
  angry with me?"</p>

  <p>She looked into my eager face and laughed a low mocking laugh, which
  maddened me to listen to. The moon was shining full upon her loose coils of
  fair hair and exquisite profile, bathing her in its silvery light, and making
  her look like a marvelous piece of statuary, perfectly beautiful, but cold as
  marble. My heart sank as I looked into her face, and I turned away in
  despair.</p>

  <p>"Maud, you are a flirt," I cried.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot," she replied, impressively, "people who live in glass
  houses shouldn't throw stones."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-18"
     id="ch-18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; A STRANGE INTERVIEW</h2>

  <p class="first">The sun had gone down behind a bank of angry, leaden-colored
  clouds, which were fast spreading over the whole surface of the sky. Only
  here and there a stunted, half-grown, and leafless oak tree stretched out its
  naked branches towards the darkening sky, and within a yard or two of me
  there was a miserable apology for a cottage.</p>

  <p>No one, save they had known otherwise, would have taken it for anything
  but a cow shed of the rudest form. It was built of boards dipped in black
  tar, windowless, chimneyless, save for a hole in the roof through which a
  small piece of dilapidated stove piping had been thrust, and without the
  merest pretence of a garden. It stood, or rather leaned, against one side of
  a sharp slope in the moor, and fifty yards from the rude sheep-track which
  did duty as a road, and even in the daytime there was no other human
  habitation within sight, or any sign of one.</p>

  <p>With my arm in the bridle of the Black Prince, I led him down the slope,
  and, grasping my riding-whip by the stock, knocked sharply at what I
  concluded to be the door. I heard the quick sound of a man's startled curse,
  and then there was a dead silence. I knocked again, but no one answered. Then
  I kicked at the loose planks till the place seemed as though it would tumble
  down, like a pack of cards.</p>

  <p>"What d'ye want?" a woman's shrill voice cried trough the open chinks.
  "Who be you?"</p>

  <p>"I want your husband," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Well, he bean't here, 'e bean't coom home."</p>

  <p>"It's a lie!" I shouted back. "Tell him I shall not go away until I have
  seen him, though I kick this place about your ears. Is he afraid? Tell him I
  am alone."</p>

  <p>She withdrew muttering, and I fastened Black Prince as securely as I could
  against the wall. Suddenly the door was opened, and stooping low, with my
  heavy riding whip grasped firmly in my right hand, I stepped inside.</p>

  <p>At first I could see nothing, but just as I was cautiously feeling in my
  pocket for a match, the red flames of a wood fire, which was smouldering on
  the hearth, leaped up and showed me the bare walls and miserable interior of
  the tumble-down hovel, showed me, too, the figure of a tall, evil-looking man
  grasping a thick cudgel in his hand, and peering through the gloom at me with
  a sort of threatening inquisitiveness.</p>

  <p>"What d'ye want wi' me?" the man began, suspiciously. Then suddenly he
  dropped his cudgel and staggered back against the frail wall, with his arms
  stretched out as though to keep me off.</p>

  <p>"God, it's Muster Herbert! It's Muster Herbert's ghost. What d'ye want?
  What d'ye want? What d'ye want here wi' me? Speak, can't you?" he cried out
  in a tone of hysterical dread.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, John Hilton," I said, contemptuously. "I am Hugh
  Devereux, son of the man against whom you swore a lie twenty-five years ago,
  and I have come here to ask you a few questions."</p>

  <p>He kept his eyes fixed upon me in a sort of sullen fascinated stare.</p>

  <p>"First tell me why you swore that lie? It was Rupert Devereux who made
  you."</p>

  <p>The man's brute courage was returning to him slowly. He picked up his
  cudgel and began to beat the side of his legs with it.</p>

  <p>"You know how to command, young sir," he said, sneeringly. "Suppose I say
  I won't answer your d&mdash;d questions?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think you'll be so foolish," I said. "If you don't want to find
  yourself in gaol for poaching before the week's out, you'll do exactly as I
  tell you."</p>

  <p>He swore savagely, and turned his ugly face full upon me.</p>

  <p>"So you was the d&mdash;d young swell that came bursting in upon us when
  we was just a settling things off nice and comfortable t'other night, was
  you? I've a good mind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He had advanced a step or two towards me, and his fingers had closed
  firmly round his cudgel.</p>

  <p>"Put that piece of timber down, John Hilton," I said, firmly; "you've
  tried conclusions with me once at Porlock, and you got the worst of it. So
  you will again if you try the same game. Drop it. Do you hear?"</p>

  <p>I took a quick step forward, and raised my riding-whip. He hesitated, and
  then threw it savagely down.</p>

  <p>"Curse it, what d'ye want to know?"</p>

  <p>"It was Rupert Devereux who made you tell that lie before the
  court-martial?"</p>

  <p>"Ay. 'twas him, right enough. I'll tell yer all about it. Muster Rupert
  Devereux ain't nothink to me! He comes to me that morning t' moment the bugle
  had sounded, and we was in the tents. 'Hilton,' he said to me, 'would yer
  tell a lie to be made a rich man for the rest of your life?' 'Of coors I
  would.' said I. 'Then when you're summoned before General Luxton to-morrow,'
  says he, 'tell him that you saw nothing of my brother during the fight.
  Forget that he ran out to help us against those two black varmint. Do that,
  and I'll allow you two hundred pounds a year as long as yon live.' 'I'm your
  man,' said I. 'That's right,' says he, and turns on his heel and walks back
  again. That were 'ow it war," he wound up defiantly.</p>

  <p>I had hard work to keep my hands off him, but I did.</p>

  <p>"And your two hundred pounds a year?"</p>

  <p>I asked, glancing around and at the bold-looking, slatternly woman who sat
  crouched on a stool watching us. "What's become of that? I presume you don't
  live here from choice?"</p>

  <p>He broke into a volley of horrible curses.</p>

  <p>"I should think I don't," he broke out. "I'll tell 'e how that
  &mdash;&mdash; served, me. I was maybe a bit of a fool; anyways, I was a bit
  strong-headed, and when we got back to England I would live wi' 'im as his
  servant, though he didn't like it, and said I was too rough and clumsy, and
  so I war. But I got into his ways a bit, and live wi' 'im I would, for I
  didn't nohow feel safe about getting the coin, he war always moving about so.
  Often we had rows, and he used to say as he'd send me a packing; but I only
  laughed at 'im. But that 'ere night, down at Porlock, yer remember it, he got
  to hear wot I'd done, and he sent for me. 'Hilton,' he said, 'here's a
  month's wages; and you can go to the devil. I've done wi' you.' ''Ow about
  our little secret, mister?' I said, for I didn't think as he was noways in
  earnest, and' e says, 'You're a fool, Hilton. You think you've got me in your
  power, but it's the stupidest mistake you ever made in your life. You can go
  and tell your secret to any one you like, and I wish you joy of those who'll
  believe yer.' And I saw then as I wor done, for of coors no one would believe
  me. They all said as it wor a bit o' spite because he'd given me the sack,
  and so I went down, down, down, and here I am."</p>

  <p>"A poacher," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"I didn't say nowt about that," he answered sullenly. "Wot more do yer
  want wi' me?"</p>

  <p>"A little family history, that's all. Whom did your master marry?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Saville, or some such name. She war a clergyman's daughter, and she
  died soon after the second child was born."</p>

  <p>"The second child! There is a daughter living at Devereux Court
  now&mdash;is the other one a son?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded sullenly.</p>

  <p>"And where is he?"</p>

  <p>"How the devil should I know! He war at college when I left Muster Rupert;
  ain't 'eard of 'im since!"</p>

  <p>"Or of Rupert Devereux?"</p>

  <p>"No, I ain't 'eard of 'im. D'ye think I reads the sassiety papers down
  'ere to know where all the fine folks is, 'cos I don't."</p>

  <p>I was silent for a few minutes, thinking.</p>

  <p>Of what use was this fellow's confession to me now that I had got it? Who
  would believe the word of such a disreputable vagabond against the word of
  Rupert Devereux? Still, I would have his confession&mdash;some day it might
  be useful.</p>

  <p>"Have you a candle?" I asked.</p>

  <p>The woman rose from her seat for the first time, and, after groping about
  for a moment or two, produced a few inches of tallow dip. I struck a match,
  and, lighting it, thrust it in the neck of a black bottle which she silently
  handed me. Then, in as few words as possible, I wrote down the substance of
  Hilton's confession and handed it to him, with the pencil, to sign.</p>

  <p>"If it only does 'im the harm I wish it will," he muttered, "it'll do.
  Now, mister," he went on, turning towards me half threateningly, half
  whiningly, "wot I wants to know is this&mdash;Be yer going to peach on me for
  that poaching job, and how in thunder's name did yer know where to find
  me?"</p>

  <p>"By accident, the latter," I answered. "I saw you come out of this den
  months ago, when I was riding across the moor to Silverbridge. I thought it
  was a chance resemblance then, but when I saw you in the wood I knew you.
  John Hilton, I am not going to denounce you as one of that gang of poachers;
  on the other hand, I have purposely refrained from handing in your
  description. But you have an account to settle with me."</p>

  <p>He grasped his cudgel again.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"I shall show you," I answered. I turned aside to the woman, who sat
  watching us with a weary, indifferent stare.</p>

  <p>"How long is it since you had anything to eat?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yester forenoon," she moaned. "Him there"&mdash;she pointed to her
  husband&mdash;"he dared na go owt, and I ain't got no money, nor nowt to
  sell. We be starving."</p>

  <p>I put my hand in my pocket and gave her half a sovereign.</p>

  <p>"Take that, and go and get something at once," I said.</p>

  <p>She started to her feet, and her fingers closed eagerly over the coin.
  Then she drew her shawl around her and hurried to the door.</p>

  <p>"I'll be back inside o' an hour, Jack," she called out to her husband.
  "We'll ha' some supper to-night; I'll go to Jones's"&mdash;and she hurried
  away.</p>

  <p>I turned to the man, who stood looking hungrily after has wife.</p>

  <p>"John Hilton, I said that I had an account to settle with you. I have. It
  is through your damnable conspiracy and lying that my father is wandering
  about in a foreign land, a miserable man; that I am here compelled to bear a
  false name and occupy a false position. If you think that I have forgiven you
  this because I gave your wife money and do not cause you to be arrested as a
  poacher, you are mistaken. I don't want your miserable life. I wouldn't take
  it if I had the chance. But I am going to give you the soundest horsewhipping
  you ever had in your life."</p>

  <p>He shrunk back. He was a coward at heart, but he had plenty of
  bravado.</p>

  <p>"Now, look 'ere, young mister," he said, savagely, "you've given my missus
  money when we wanted it lad, and I don't want to hurt you. But you're only, a
  stripling, and if you lay 'ands on me I sha'n't take it quiet, I can tell
  you. Now, keep off."</p>

  <p>He was a tall man, but I was a taller; and though I was slim, my
  out-of-door life had hardened my muscles till they were like iron. But had I
  been less his superior in strength, the passionate hatred and disgust which
  leaped up within me when I remembered what this man had done would have
  helped me to have gained my end. As it was, he was utterly helpless in my
  grasp, and I had wrenched his cudgel from him in a moment. All round the
  little room he struggled, and writhed; whilst holding him by the collar with
  one hand I dealt him fierce, quick blows with my thonged riding whip. Then,
  throwing him from me, panting, and helpless, into the furthest corner of the
  room, I strode out of the shaking tenement to where my horse was neighing
  impatiently outside. He made no attempt to follow me, and in a few minutes I
  had given Black Prince the rein, and we were flying across the moor
  homewards.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-19"
     id="ch-19"></a>XIX. &mdash; MARIAN SURPRISES ME</h2>

  <p class="first">It was eighteen miles from John Hilton's hut to the park
  gates, across a wild country, and I had had two hours hard riding when,
  splashed with bog mud from head to foot, I walked into Marian's little
  sitting-room, which, it seemed to me, after the dark moor, had never looked
  so cheerful and cosy. Marian herself was there, lounging in a low wicker
  chair, with her fair hair scarcely so tidy as usual, and a soft, pleased
  light in her grey eyes, and opposite her was a visitor&mdash;our curate. She
  sprang up as I entered.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, how late you are! I waited dinner nearly two hours. Where have you
  been?"</p>

  <p>I was tired, and hungry, and cold; and I shook hands with our visitor
  without a superabundance of cordiality before dropping into an easy chair in
  front of the fire.</p>

  <p>"A little business, that's all. Did you keep any dinner back?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I did."</p>

  <p>She rang the bell, and I sat still for a minute or two, expecting Mr.
  Holdern to take his leave. But he did nothing of the sort. Presently I
  rose.</p>

  <p>"I'll change my things, and have a wash, I think. You'll excuse me for a
  few minutes," I said to Mr Holdern, curtly.</p>

  <p>He consented readily, without making any movement to go. When I descended
  into our little dining-room, about half an hour afterwards, Marian was not
  there, though she came in almost directly.</p>

  <p>"That fellow Holdern not gone yet?" I asked, surprised.</p>

  <p>"N&mdash;no, Hugh, he's not gone yet," Marian answered, a little
  consciously. "Now, I do hope that partridge isn't done up to nothing. And
  how's the bread sauce? Rather thick, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>I couldn't quite make Marian out. She seemed almost nervous, and after she
  had waited upon me, and poured out a glass of the claret which Sir Francis
  had insisted upon sending down from the house, she stood by my side with her
  arm round any neck, and looking uncommonly pretty.</p>

  <p>"Hadn't you better go in and talk with that fellow Holdern, if he won't
  go?" I asked. "Won't do to leave him in there all by himself."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he won't hurt," she answered, stroking my hair caressingly; "he's
  been here ever since afternoon tea."</p>

  <p>"The deuce he has!" I exclaimed, setting down my glass, and looking up at
  her surprised. "What does he want? A subscription?"</p>

  <p>"N&mdash;no. I don't think so, Hughie."</p>

  <p>Something of the truth commenced to dawn upon me, and sitting back in my
  chair, I caught Marian by the arms, and looked into her face.</p>

  <p>"Marian, you don't mean to say that the fellow's been making love to
  you!"</p>

  <p>She was blushing all over her delicate little face, and she held up her
  hands as though to hide it from me.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I'm afraid he has, Hughie, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And what?"</p>

  <p>"And I've been letting him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed!" I exclaimed, feebly.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a very impressive thing to say, but I was bewildered.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she threw herself into my arms and hid her face on my
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Hugh, you won't be angry, will you? Say that you won't! He is so
  nice, and I'm so happy."</p>

  <p>"I don't know how most men would have felt in my position, but I must
  confess that my first impulse was to go and punch Mr. Holdern's head. But
  when I began to think the matter over a little it occurred to me that this
  was scarcely the proper course lo pursue&mdash;at nay rate, it was not the
  usual one. The more I thought of it, the more natural it seemed to me. I
  remembered now how often I had found Mr. Holdern sitting at afternoon tea
  with Marian when I had come home about that time, and what an interest she
  had been taking in parish matters lately. As far as the man himself was
  concerned there was nothing against him; in fact, I rather liked him. But to
  give him&mdash;a stranger&mdash;Marian, my little sister, who had only just
  begun to keep house for me, the idea was certainly not a pleasant one, and
  yet if she wished it, how could I refuse her?</p>

  <p>"You're too young, you know, for anything of this sort, Marian," I began,
  with an at tempt at severity, which I'm sure she saw through.</p>

  <p>"I'm eighteen," came a piteous voice from the vicinity of my waistcoat.
  "Lots of girls are engaged before they're eighteen."</p>

  <p>This was unanswerable. I tried another line.</p>

  <p>"And you want to leave me, then, Marian, already?" I said, with a
  plaintiveness that was not all affected.</p>

  <p>The arms that were round my neck tightened their grasp, and a tear-stained
  dishevelled face was lifted piteously to mine.</p>

  <p>"I don't, Hugh! You know I don't. We only want to be engaged. We don't
  want to be married."</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose it's all right," I said, with a sigh. "Look here, Marian,
  you run along into Mr. Holdern, and leave me to think about it while I finish
  my dinner."</p>

  <p>She unclasped her hands, and looked at me radiantly.</p>

  <p>"Dear old Hugh! I knew you'd say yes."</p>

  <p>"But I haven't said anything of the sort," I protested, severely. "Don't
  you run away with that idea, young lady. I shall have to hear what Mr.
  Holdern's got to say for himself first," I added, frowning, and assuming an
  air of paternal authority. But she saw through it, and with a final kiss ran
  away laughing.</p>

  <p>Being a somewhat matter-of-fact young man, and keenly conscious of an as
  yet unsatisfied hunger, I finished my dinner before I commenced to think
  seriously over this unexpected incident Then I leaned back in my chair and
  considered it, and in a very few minutes I had come to the conclusion that it
  was about the most fortunate thing that could have happened. I had never
  intended my stay here to be a permanent one, and whilst there were now no
  reasons why I should remain, there were several strong ones why I should go.
  First, I could attain no nearer now, by stopping, to the great object of my
  life; on the other hand, every day I stayed here and remained under the
  fascination of Maud Devereux's presence I stood in greater risk of forgetting
  my oath. Then, whilst here I had no opportunity of meeting Rupert Devereux,
  my uncle, the man from whom, if it came at all, must come my father's
  justification. My father!</p>

  <p>I thought of him in his weary exile, and my heart ached. Not a line had I
  heard from him since our parting, nor had I even the least idea in what
  country of the world he was. If Marian left me, what was there to prevent my
  finding him out and throwing in my lot with his? Together we might accomplish
  what singly each might fail in. The more I thought about it the more I liked
  the idea.</p>

  <p>Leave Devereux I must, though I had grown to love the place, and to feel a
  strange affection for my stern old grandfather. Yet how could I go on living
  here to feel every day the subtle fascination of Maud Devereux's presence
  getting a stronger hold upon me&mdash;Maud Devereux, the daughter of the man
  who had wrecked my father's life and mine, the man whom I had cursed in my
  heart? It seemed to me almost like treachery towards him whom I loved so
  well, and whose wrongs I so bitterly resented, that a glance from her blue
  eyes could madden or elate, me, and that the sound of her voice could set all
  my senses quivering. I must go, I must turn my back upon her for ever, and
  take up the work of my life wherever it might lead me. This thing which had
  happened to Marian made the way clear before me.</p>

  <p>I crossed over to our little drawing-room, and, entering without the
  ceremony of knocking, found Maria a and Mr. Holdern seated on chairs a long
  way from one another, apparently engaged in a minute examination of the
  ceiling. Marian took up her work and left us with a blushing face, and Mr.
  Holdern, without any beating about the bush, stood up on the hearthrug and
  began his tale.</p>

  <p>He was a pleasant-faced, agreeable young fellow, and there was an honest
  look about his eyes and a straightforward manner winch I liked, and which
  convinced me of his sincerity. He had a private income, he told me, and had
  recently been offered a very comfortable living about twelve miles away. "Of
  course," he added, hesitatingly, "he felt some diffidence in proposing to
  take Marian away from me, and thus leaving me to live by myself&mdash;but,
  but, the long and short of it was, he wanted to get married as soon as I
  could possibly spare her. They would not be far away; indeed, if my
  prospective loneliness was an objection, I could take up my abode with them.
  Anything so that I would give him Marian, and give him her soon."</p>

  <p>I did not waste any time in affecting to consider the matter, but,
  pledging him first to secrecy, I told him our history, what was our rightful
  name, and my reasons for not bearing it. If I had had any doubt before, I
  knew by his behavior when I had finished my story that he was a good fellow.
  He held out his hand and grasped mine, with the tears standing in, his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Devereux," he said emphatically, "I don't know how to express my
  sympathy for you. I heard of this sad affair when I was a very little boy,
  and I have heard my father say many a time that he would never believe
  Herbert Devereux to be a coward. I hope to God that you will succeed in your
  quest."</p>

  <p>"I hope so," I echoed fervently. "Marian knows nothing of this, Mr.
  Holdern."</p>

  <p>"Nor need she ever," he answered. "I think you nave been quite right to
  keep it from her! There would have been no object gained in her knowing, and
  women do not understand these things like men."</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything of Rupert Devereux?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "Very little. I have seen him once&mdash;a tall, dark
  man, handsome, but very unlike the Devereuxs. I have heard him spoken of as a
  'Sybarite, and a pleasure-seeker. He is seldom in England, I believe."</p>

  <p>A Sybarite! A pleasure-seeker! I thought of him wandering at will through
  the countries of the world, steeping his senses in every luxury that money
  could buy, and living at ease and in comfort, and I thought of my father,
  also a wanderer on the face of the earth, seeking neither comfort nor
  pleasure nor ease, at war with the world and with himself, with no joy in the
  present or hope for the future, seeking only for a chance to throw his life
  away in the miserable quarrels of any pettifogging country who would accept
  his sword! Mr. Holdern watched me in silence while I walked up and down the
  room for a few minutes almost beside myself with compressed passion. Then he
  walked up to me and laid a hand on my shoulder. "Devereux," he said,
  earnestly, "I can understand your feeling like this, but you must try and
  keep it under control, or I'm afraid there will be trouble soon."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" I asked, turning round and facing him.</p>

  <p>He hesitated, and then answered slowly-"I have just heard that young
  Francis Devereux, your cousin, is expected down here for Christmas."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-20"
     id="ch-20"></a>XX. &mdash; AMONGST THE BULRUSHES</h2>

  <p class="first">It wanted but three days to Christmas, and it had been a
  frost. Upon the bare fields and the shivering landscape had fallen a hand of
  iron&mdash;no gentle hoar-frost, making the fields and country look like a
  glittering panorama, but a stern, merciless, black frost, which had come in
  with the east wind, and lay upon the land like a cruel blight. Agricultural
  work of all sort was at a standstill, and hunting was impossible. The only
  thing to be done out of doors was to skate, and that everyone who owned a
  pair of skates was doing.</p>

  <p>There was a large party at Devereux Court, but I had contrived to see very
  little of them. Two of Lady Olive's sisters, some former schoolfellows of
  Maud Devereux's, Francis Devereux, and some town friends, were all stopping
  there, and Maud was playing hostess, while Sir Francis kept himself partially
  shut up. Once or twice I had come across them in the park, a laughing,
  chattering group, but I had passed with a bow, and had chosen not to see Lady
  Olive's mute command to stop. I had seen him, my cousin, and I hated him.
  What freak of nature had made him the brother of such a sister?&mdash;this
  pale, effeminate-looking man, with leaden eyes and insolent stare, and the
  manners of a fop. "What did Sir Francis think of him," I wonder, "as the
  future head of the family of Devereux?" Bah! It was a profitless thought.</p>

  <p>Early in the morning I sallied out with Mr. Holdern and Marian for an hour
  or two's skating; there was nothing else for me to do. There were two lakes,
  and we chose the smaller that we might have it all to ourselves. No sooner
  had we our skates on that the inevitable happened. Hand in hand Marian and
  Holdern swept away together to the further end where the bulrushes were many
  and the ice was bad, and I was left alone.</p>

  <p>I commenced to make the best of it by selecting a smooth piece of ice and
  setting myself an impossible task in figure skating. Far away on the other
  lake I could hear the hum of many skates and the sound of merry voices, and
  it made me feel lonely and discontented' I would like to have been with them,
  skating hand in hand with Maud&mdash;Maud, whom I had not spoken a single
  word to since our last ride home together; Maud whose face was seldom absent
  from my thoughts; Maud whom, alas! I loved.</p>

  <p>With an aching heart I left off my futile attempt to cut impossible
  figures, and, lighting my pipe, commenced to make the circuit of the lake,
  with long, swift strides. There was something exhilarating in the rapid
  motion, in the desperate hastening over the smooth black ice, and as I came
  round for the second time my cheeks began lo glow and my heart to grow
  lighter. Then suddenly it bounded with an unthinking joy, for close above me
  was a chorus of gay, chattering tongues, and one amongst them I could
  distinguish in a moment, although it was the lowest of all.</p>

  <p>I struck away for the middle of the lake meaning to make my escape, but I
  was just a second or two too late. Lady Olive was calling to me, and I was
  obliged to turn round.</p>

  <p>The whole group were standing on the bank, some carrying chairs, and some
  sledges; and, all except Francis Devereux, skates. Lady Olive was calling to
  me, so I was obliged to skate up to them.</p>

  <p>"Fancy your being here all by yourself, Mr. Arbuthnot! Do you know, we
  were coming down to call on you, the whole lot of us, if we hadn't seen you
  soon. Is it good ice? And come in closer, do; I want to introduce you to my
  sisters."</p>

  <p>There was nothing for me to do but obey, and in a moment I found myself
  being chatted to by two girls not very unlike Lady Olive herself; and my hand
  had touched Maud's for a moment, and my eyes look into her's.. Then some one
  introduced me to Mr. Francis Devereux, and I found myself bowing slightly (I
  had kept my hands behind me, all the time anticipating this, for God forbid
  that I should place the hand of Rupert Devereux's son within my own) to my
  cousin, who looked out at me superciliously from the depths of a fur coat,
  which had the appearance of having been made for the Arctic regions. It was
  too cold to stand still, and we all trooped on to the ice. There were many
  more men than girls in the party, I was pleased to see, and very soon they
  were scattered all over the lake in couples, and I glad enough of it was left
  to myself. Maud alone had delayed putting on her skates, and was sitting on a
  stump close to where I was standing filling my pipe, the centre of a little
  group of men, amongst whom was Lord Annerley. As I threw the match down, and
  turned round to start away again, my eyes met hers for a moment, and she
  smiled slightly. Did she expect me, I wonder, to join the little group of her
  admirers, and vie with them in making pretty speeches, and compete with them
  for the privilege of putting her skates on? Bah! not I. If she thought that I
  was her slave, to be made happy or miserable by a glance from her blue eyes
  or a kind word from her lips I would show her that she was mistaken. If she
  was proud, so was I; and drawing on my glove again, I skated over to the
  other side of the lake, out of hearing and sight of her little court.</p>

  <p>Soon Lady Olive came skating up to me alone, with her hands stuck
  coquettishly into the pockets of her short fur-trimmed jacket, and her bright
  little face glowing with pleasure and warmth.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot, I think you're the most unsociable man I ever knew!" she
  exclaimed. "My sisters are dying to skate with you, but you won't ask them,
  and&mdash;and&mdash;so am I," she added, with a bewitching smile up at
  me.</p>

  <p>Of course I could do nothing but take her little hands into mine and skate
  away with her at once. We passed Maud again and again skating with Lord
  Annerley, and the proud cold light in her eyes as she glanced at us in
  passing half maddened me. Whenever we met her, Lady Olive, out of wanton
  mischief, forced me to look down into her laughing upturned face and bright
  eyes, and to do so without an answering smile was impossible; and yet Lady
  Olive's brilliant chatter and mocking speeches were very pleasant to hear and
  to respond to, reckless little flirt though she was.</p>

  <p>She left me at last to skate with Lord Annerley's brother, who had just
  driven up in a dog-cart with some more men, and then I went to look for
  Marian and Holdern. Instead, I came face to face round a sharp corner with
  Maud leaning back in a sledge and gazing idly into the bulrushes, where one
  of her brother's friends was busy with a penknife. She motioned me languidly
  to stop, and I obeyed her.</p>

  <p>"What have you done with Lady Olive?" she inquired coldly.</p>

  <p>"Resigned her to a more fortunate man," I answered, circling round her
  chair.</p>

  <p>"More fortunate! You haven't much to grumble at! You've been skating with
  her more than an hour, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"Really I don't know," I answered, lightly. "I took little notice of the
  time."</p>

  <p>"It passed too pleasantly, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so! I so seldom have any one to talk to," I could not help
  answering.</p>

  <p>"It is your own fault. You have been avoiding us deliberately for the last
  three weeks."</p>

  <p>I folded my arms and looked steadily away from her.</p>

  <p>"And if I have," I said, slowly, "I think you might congratulate me on my
  wisdom and strength of mind."</p>

  <p>She, laughed a little hesitating laugh, and, with her head thrown back on
  the cushion of the sledge, fixed her eyes upon me.</p>

  <p>"Lady Olive is dangerous, is she?"</p>

  <p>I looked at her for a full minute without answering. From underneath her
  sealskin turban hat her blue eyes were looking full into mine, and a mocking
  smile was playing around her delicate lips. Surely she was beautiful enough
  to drive any man mad.</p>

  <p>"No, Lady Olive is not dangerous to me," I answered, deliberately, "you
  are."</p>

  <p>"I." A curious change came over her face as she uttered the word. The
  mocking smile became almost a tender one, and a delicate flush tinged her
  soft cheeks. But the greatest change was in her eyes. For a moment they
  flashed into mine with a light shining out of their blue depths which I had
  never dreamt of seeing there, a soft, warm, almost a loving light.</p>

  <p>"You are a silly boy," she said, in a low tone, and the color deepening
  all the while in her cheeks. "How dare you talk to me like this?"</p>

  <p>Ah, how dared I? She might well have asked that if she had only known.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," I said, recklessly. "I shall say more if I stay here any
  longer."</p>

  <p>"You? Ah, Captain Hasleton, how beautiful! However did you manage to find
  so many?"</p>

  <p>Captain Hasleton shut up his penknife, and commenced tying the bundle of
  bulrushes together.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you may well ask that, Miss Devereux," he said, laughing; "it would
  take' too long to narrate all the horrors I have faced in collecting them.
  First of all, endless frogs resented my intrusion by jumping up and croaking
  all round me. Then I stood in constant peril of a ducking. You should have
  heard the ice crack! And last, but by no means least, I've cut my finger.
  Nothing but half a dozen waltzes to-night will repay me."</p>

  <p>Maud laughed gaily.</p>

  <p>"Half a dozen? How grasping! I'll promise you two. That reminds me, Mr.
  Arbuthnot," she added, leaning forward on her muff and looking up at me,
  "we're going to dance to-night, and I've persuaded your sister and Mr.
  Holdern to come up to dinner. You will come, won't you?"</p>

  <p>I said something conventional to the effect that I should be delighted,
  and, raising my cap, was about to turn away. But she called me back.</p>

  <p>"How dreadfully tall you are, Mr. Arbuthnot! I have a private message for
  your sister. Do you think that you could bring yourself within whispering
  distance?"</p>

  <p>I stooped down till my heart beat to feel her soft breath on my cheek, and
  I felt a wild longing to seize hold of the slender, shapely hand that rested
  on my coat-sleeve. And these were the words which she whispered into my ear,
  half mischievously, half-tenderly.</p>

  <p>"Faint heart never won anything, did it? Don't, you silly boy! Captain
  Hasleton will see you."</p>

  <p>And then she drew herself up and nodded, and with the hot color burning my
  cheeks, and with leaping heart, I watched Captain Hasleton seize hold of the
  light hand-sledge and send it flying along the smooth surface of the lake
  round the sharp corner and out of sight. Then I turned and skated away in the
  opposite direction with those words ringing in my ears and a wild joy an my
  heart. The cold east wind seemed to me like the balmiest summer breeze, and
  the bare, desolate landscape stretching away in front seemed bathed in a
  softening golden light. For Maud loved me&mdash;or she was a flirt. Maud was
  a flirt&mdash;or she loved me.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-21"
     id="ch-21"></a>XXI. &mdash; RUPERT DEVEREUX</h2>

  <p class="first">If any one had told me that evening, as Marian and Holdern
  and I drew near to the great entrance of Devereux Court, that I was entering
  it for the last time for many years, I should probably have thought them mad.
  And yet so it was, for that night was a fateful one to me. Into foreign lands
  and far away places I carried with me the memory of the stately greystone
  front, the majestic towers, the half-ruined battlements, the ivy-covered,
  ruined chapel, with its stained glass windows, and the vast hall towering up
  to the vaulted roof. Of Devereux Court of all these, I have said but little,
  for my story is rather a chronicle of events than a descriptive one. But they
  made a great impression upon me, as was only natural, for would they not some
  day, if I chose to claim them, be mine?</p>

  <p>We arrived rather early, and leaving Marian and Mr. Holdern in the
  drawing-room with a few of the other guests who had already assembled, I made
  use of my knowledge of the house to go and look for Maud, and I found her
  alone, in the conservatory, leading out of her little morning room.</p>

  <p>Surely God's earth had never held a more lovely woman. I stood looking at
  her for a full minute before speaking. A rich ivory satin dress hung in
  simple but perfectly graceful folds about her slim, exquisite figure, and
  bands of wide, creamy old point lace filled in her square bodice right up to
  her white throat. She wore no ornaments, no flowers, save a single sprig of
  heliotrope nearly buried amongst the lace. Her deep blue, almost violet, eyes
  had lost their cold, disdainful gleam, and looked into mine kindly; but there
  was still the half-mocking smile playing around her slightly parted lips.</p>

  <p>"And, pray, what right have you to come into my sanctum without knocking,
  sir?" she asked, with a soft laugh, which did not seem to me to speak of much
  anger; "and now that you are here, why do you stand staring at me like a
  great stupid?"</p>

  <p>I drew a long breath, and look a step forward.</p>

  <p>"I came to beg for a flower, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, there are plenty in the conservatory," she said, pointing to it.
  "You may help yourself."</p>

  <p>I stood close to her, so close that the faint perfume from the morsel of
  lace which she was holding in her hand reached me.</p>

  <p>"Only one flower will satisfy me," I said. "That sprig of heliotrope. May
  I have it?"</p>

  <p>She laughed again, a low musical laugh, and the tinge of pink in her
  cheeks grew deeper.</p>

  <p>"If nothing else will satisfy you, I suppose you must."</p>

  <p>She unfastened it from the bosom of her dress, and her little white
  fingers busied themselves for a moment with my button hole. So close was her
  head, with its many coils of dazzlingly fair hair, to mine, that,
  irresistibly tempted, I let my fingers rest upon it for a second with a
  caressing touch. She looked up at me with a mock frown, which her eyes
  contradicted.</p>

  <p>She did not speak, neither did I. But a sweet subtle intoxication seemed
  to be creeping over my senses, and slowly, scarce knowing what I did, I drew
  her into my arms, and her head rested upon my shoulder. Then my lips touched
  hers in one long quivering kiss, which she not only suffered, but faintly
  returned, and it seemed to me that life could hold nothing sweeter than
  this.</p>

  <p>Only for a moment she lingered in my arms. Then, as though suddenly
  galvanised into life and recollection, she gently disengaged herself, and
  stood apart from me.</p>

  <p>Maud blushing&mdash;my princess blushing! I had pictured her to myself
  often with a thousand different expressions dwelling in her cold, fair face,
  but never thus! Yet how could she have looked more lovely!</p>

  <p>"Now I wonder what my father would have said if he had come in just then!"
  she exclaimed, holding her fan in front of her face, and looking at me with
  laughingly reproachful eyes over the top of its wavy feathers. "Mind, you
  must be on your very best behavior this evening, and not attempt to talk to
  me too much. He hasn't seen me for five years, and I don't want him to think
  me frivolous."</p>

  <p>"Your father! My God! is he here?" I gasped, leaning back against the
  table, and clutching hold of it with nervous fingers. The room seemed
  swimming round with me, and Maud's face alone remained distinct.</p>

  <p>"He's coming to-night," she said, looking at me in amazement. "What
  difference can it make to you? Why, Mr. Ar&mdash;Hugh, you are ill!" she
  exclaimed, shutting up her fan and moving to my side.</p>

  <p>I held out my hand to keep her away. God forbid that Rupert Devereux's
  daughter should rest in my arms again.</p>

  <p>"Coming here!" I muttered. "Coming here to-night!" The idea seemed almost
  too much for me to realise. How could I sit at the same table with him? How
  breathe the same air without letting him know of my hate? And this was his
  daughter Maud-my Maud, my princess. The idea seemed almost to choke me.</p>

  <p>The second dinner gong boomed out, and I raised myself at once.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I frightened you, M&mdash;Miss Devereux. I won't stop to
  explain now. They will be wanting you in the drawing-room."</p>

  <p>I opened the door for her, and she swept out and across the polished oak
  and rug strewn floor of the hall, lifting her eyes to mine for one moment as
  she passed, full of a strange, sweet light. For a brief while I lingered
  behind; then, with a great effort, regaining my calmness, I followed her.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-22"
     id="ch-22"></a>XXII. &mdash; FACE TO FACE</h2>

  <p class="first">I sat between Lady Olive and her younger sister at dinner,
  and I have no doubt that both found me very stupid and inattentive. I could
  neither eat nor drink, talk nor laugh. Even Lady Olive gave me up at last,
  and devoted her attention to Captain Hasleton, her neighbor on the other
  side. It was not until dinner was nearly over that I was able to rouse myself
  in the slightest degree, and by that time Lady Olive had quite lost her
  temper with me.</p>

  <p>"Skating doesn't agree with you, Mr. Arbuthnot," she whispered, when at
  last Maud had given the signal to rise. "I never knew any one so provokingly
  stupid in all my life."</p>

  <p>I shrugged my shoulders deprecatingly.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Lady Olive," I said grimly, "but if you felt as I do for five
  minutes you'd for give me," which was perfectly true.</p>

  <p>She looked up at me with a pitying glance, and I suppose something in my
  expression told her that I was suffering, for her piquant little face clouded
  over at once.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry, Mr. Arbuthnot. You look as though you had a very bad
  headache. Come to me in the drawing-room as soon as you can, and I'll give
  you some sal volatile."</p>

  <p>I thanked her a little absently&mdash;perhaps without sufficient
  gratitude, for she was a kind-hearted little woman, although she was such a
  terrible flirt. But I was eager to watch Maud go by&mdash;eager even to be
  brushed by her garments as she passed.</p>

  <p>She half stopped as she reached me.</p>

  <p>"I won't allow you to flirt with Lady Olive," she whispered, with a
  bewitching little moue; then added out loud: "Come to us as soon as ever you
  can, Mr. Arbuthnot. We want to commence dancing in good time."</p>

  <p>I bowed, and letting fall the curtain, turned back to the table. Sir
  Francis motioned me to take the vacant place by his side, and filled my glass
  himself from the decanter which stood at his elbow.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, my boy," he said, slowly&mdash;he had got into the habit of calling
  me Hugh lately&mdash;"I'm upset!"</p>

  <p>I looked into his handsome old face, and saw that it was clouded over, and
  that there was a heavy frown on his brow.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, sir," I ventured to say.</p>

  <p>"Thanks. I knew you would be. I don't suppose a man ought to be sorry
  because his son's coming to see him, ought he?"</p>

  <p>It depended upon the son, I thought.</p>

  <p>"Ay, it depends upon the son, of course," he said, thoughtfully, stroking
  his long grey moustache. "There is nothing against Maud's father, nothing at
  all. He's nothing; like that young cub of his down there," he went on,
  jerking his head to where Francis Devereux was talking very loudly and
  drinking a good deal of champagne. "And yet I don't want him here. I can't
  bear to see him in the place. It's a d&mdash;d funny thing."</p>

  <p>"If you feel like that, sir," I said, keeping my eyes fixed upon the
  tablecloth, "depend upon it, it's your son's fault. He's done something to
  deserve it."</p>

  <p>Sir Francis sat silent for a while, toying with his glasses.</p>

  <p>"He has done nothing," he said, half to himself, "and yet I hate the sight
  of him, and he of me. It is twelve years since he set foot within Devereux
  Court. Twelve years! I wonder what his fancy is for coming now. Would to God
  he had stopped away!"</p>

  <p>"Sir Francis," exclaimed a voice from the lower end of the table, "a
  promise to ladies is sacred. We were told that ten minutes was as long as we
  could be allowed this evening, and we have pledged our words. Have we your
  permission?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>Sir Francis rose, and there was a general draining of glasses and a
  stretching of masculine forms, Then we followed him across the hall into the
  blue drawing-room.</p>

  <p>I should have made my way at once to Maud, but a look in her eyes checked
  me, and I turned aside and sat down in an empty recess. I had scarcely
  commenced to turn over the pages of a book of engravings which I had
  carelessly taken up, when I heard a voice at my elbow.</p>

  <p>"As usual, Mr. Arbuthnot, you make me come to you. It's too bad of
  you."</p>

  <p>I put down the book with a start, and stood up. Lady Olive was at my
  elbow.</p>

  <p>"Now, sit down again, and tell me how the headache is," she exclaimed,
  sinking herself into the cushioned recess, and drawing her skirts aside to
  make room for me. "See, I've brought you my favorite smelling salts, and I
  have some sal volatile in my pocket. I mustn't doctor you before all these
  people, though! And now for the question I'm dying to ask. Shall you be able
  to waltz?"</p>

  <p>"Come and see," I said, rising and offering her my arm, for an exodus was
  already taking place from the room. "It's awfully good of you, Lady Olive, to
  remember my headache," I added, gratefully.</p>

  <p>She tapped my fingers with her fan.</p>

  <p>"Don't make speeches, sir. What a grand old place this is, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>We were to dance in the armor gallery, and the whole party were making
  their way there now. The magnificent staircase, bordered with massive black
  oak balustrades, up which we were passing, descended into the middle of the
  hall, and was supported by solid black marble pillars; and the corridor,
  which ran at right angles to it, was lighted by stained glass windows, in
  front of each of which armored knights were grimly keeping watch. One
  corridor led into another, all of noble dimensions, with high oriel windows,
  and lined by a silent ghostly guard of steel clad warriors and polished
  marble statues. A strange contrast they seemed to the gay, laughing
  procession of girls, in their low necked dinner dresses and flashing
  diamonds, and men in their mess jackets and evening coats. Maud alone, moving
  with the slow, stately grace of a princess of former days, seemed in keeping
  with our surroundings.</p>

  <p>Soon the sound of violins reached us, and, pushing aside the heavy
  curtains, we descended two steps and stood in the armor gallery. Maud's
  imagination and many nimble fingers had been busy here, and at first I
  scarcely knew the place. Fairy lights with various colored shades hung from
  the mailed gloves of many generations of Devereux, and the black oak floor
  was shining with a polish beyond its own. But no fairy lights or bracketed
  candles could dispel the gloom which hung about the long lofty gallery, with
  its vaulted roof black with age, and its panelled walls hung with the martial
  trophies of every age and every land. And yet it was a gloom which seemed in
  keeping with the place, and no one found it oppressive.</p>

  <p>I danced with Lady Olive, and then, as we stood talking in the shade of
  one of my armored forefathers, Captain Hasleton came up and claimed her, and
  I was left alone. Nearly opposite me was Maud, standing like an exquisite
  picture in the softened light of one of the stained glass windows. But I did
  not go to her at once. Several men were talking to her, and she was answering
  them with the languid air of one who finds it hard to be amused, and her blue
  eyes more than once travelled past them and looked into mine indifferently,
  but still with a meaning in them. At last I crossed the room and stood before
  her.</p>

  <p>"You promised me a waltz, I think, Miss Devereux. Will not this one
  do?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated for a moment, and then she laid her hand on my coat-sleeve,
  and we moved away. Without a word I passed my arm around her waist, and we
  floated slowly up the room. It was one of Waldteufel's wild, sad waltzes, now
  bursting into a loud flood of music, now dying away into a few faint
  melodious chords. For many years after wards I never heard it played without
  longing to rush away into solitude and recall those few minutes of exquisite
  happiness in that strange, dimly-lit ballroom.</p>

  <p>All things come to an end, and so did that waltz. Maud promised me the
  next but one and was led away by Lord Annerley, and, to while away the time,
  I took a lamp from a bracket on the wall, and, pushing aside the heavy
  curtains, stepped into the picture gallery to look at my father's
  portrait.</p>

  <p>It was not the first time by many that I had done so, for when I had been
  shown over the court soon after my arrival my first visit had been here.
  Bitterly indignant had I felt when, after I had looked for long in vain for
  my father's picture, I had found it&mdash;with its face turned against the
  wall. I had turned it round again during a moment or two when Groves, the
  portly house steward, had been otherwise engaged, and since then it had not
  been disturbed, for Sir Francis no longer made this his favorite
  lounging-place; indeed, he seldom came here at all.</p>

  <p>The sound of the music and of voices&mdash;some fresh ones I
  fancied&mdash;came to me in a faint, indistinct hum through the drawn
  curtains, and for a while I forgot all about them. I seemed in another world,
  amongst those long rows of my frowning ancestors, beruffled ladies in quilted
  gowns and dresses of strange device, armed knights, and beaux of a later and
  more peaceful age with perukes, knee-breeches, and snuff-boxes. But though I
  walked the whole length of the gallery, and glanced leisurely at all of them,
  it was my father's picture at which I lingered longest, and before which I
  was standing absorbed when the drawing of the curtain and the sound of voices
  and feet entering the gallery made me start round and very nearly drop the
  candle which I held in my hand.</p>

  <p>"Why, Arbuthnot, what arc you doing moping in here?" exclaimed Sir
  Francis, in a tone of astonishment. "Why don't you go and dance?"</p>

  <p>I turned round with some excuse on my lips, but it died away when I saw
  who were his companions. Walking by his side was a tall, dark man, with
  iron-grey hair, and pale, delicate face. On his arm was Maud, and, glancing
  from one to another, I knew that this was her father, my Uncle Rupert. Behind
  was my cousin Francis, with Lady Olive on his arm. It was a strange
  meeting.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Arbuthnot, Rupert, whom I was telling you about just now,"
  Sir Francis went on, without appearing to notice my start. "Arbuthnot, this
  is my son, Mr. Rupert Devereux."</p>

  <p>I bowed slightly, and my Uncle Rupert did the same, withdrawing the hand
  which I had affected not to see. God forbid that my hand should touch his,
  even in the most casual fashion.</p>

  <p>"Well, Arbuthnot, we&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sir Francis broke off in his pleasant speech, with his eyes riveted on the
  wall behind me. Slowly his face grew rigid with anger, and his thick eyebrows
  were contracted in a stern frown.</p>

  <p>"Who has touched that picture?" he asked, in a cold, measured tone, which
  I had never heard from him before.</p>

  <p>Rupert Devereux's eyes followed his father's shaking forefinger, and I saw
  a change pass over his face also. His dark eyes filled with a troubled,
  fearful light, and he shrank back a pace, as though to escape from the sight
  of the handsome boyish face which laughed down on him from the massive frame.
  To my eyes, inspired by knowledge, guilt was written in his pale face as
  plainly as nature could write, and with a passionate anger which had lain
  sleeping within me for many weary months leapt out, burning and fierce,
  kindled by his presence. I forgot that I was Mr. Arbuthnot, the land agent; I
  forgot Maud's presence; I forgot everything save that I stood face to face
  with the man who had blighted my father's name and honor.</p>

  <p>That one maddening thought alone held me, and it was only by a great
  effort that I restrained myself from flying at his throat like a mad
  bull-dog.</p>

  <p>I don't think that Sir Francis noticed my agitation. In fact, I am sure
  that he did not; for I was standing just outside the streak of light which
  the moon, shining softly in through the diamond-paned window, was casting
  upon the polished floor.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot," he said, firmly, "might I trouble you&mdash;or Francis,
  you are nearest! Be so good as to turn that picture with its face to the
  wall."</p>

  <p>Francis Devereux dropped Lady Olive's arm, and, advancing, laid his hands
  upon the frame. . Then the devil broke loose within me, and, seizing him by
  the collar as though he had been a baby, I threw him on his back upon the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"Dare to lay a finger upon that picture, you or any one else here," I
  cried, passionately, "and I will kill you!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-23"
     id="ch-23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; IN THE PICTURE GALLERY</h2>

  <p class="first">It is strange that, although so many years have passed, that
  scene remains as though written with letters of fire into my memory-vivid and
  clear. Word for word, I can remember every sentence that was spoken; and the
  different expressions on the face of each I could, if I were a painter,
  faithfully reproduce. Sir Francis gazed at me speechless in a sort of
  helpless apathy, Maud and Lady Olive looked horrified and thunderstruck, and
  my Uncle Rupert, with face as pale as death, was shaking from head to foot,
  with eyes riveted upon me in a sort of fascinated bewilderment, as though I
  were one risen from the dead. Sir Francis seemed to be the first to recover
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Arbuthnot! Arbuthnot!" he exclaimed; "what does this mean?"</p>

  <p>I pointed to my uncle, and he seemed to shrink back from my outstretched
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Cannot you see?" he faltered in a hollow tone. "Look at him and at the
  picture."</p>

  <p>I had moved a step forward unconsciously, and was standing in the centre
  of the broad stretch of moonlight which was streaming in from the high
  window. Sir Francis looked at me, and then gave a great start.</p>

  <p>"My God! Arbuthnot, boy! Who are you? Speak!"</p>

  <p>"Hugh Arbuthnot, son of Herbert Arbuthnot, who once called himself
  Devereux," I answered, proudly, looking Sir Francis steadily in the face;
  "and who would be a Devereux still," I added, "but for that man's villainous
  lie."</p>

  <p>Rupert Devereux turned his head away, as though unable to meet the fire
  which blazed from my eyes. Maud had sunk, half fainting, upon an ottoman, and
  Lady Olive was by her side. Sir Francis stood gazing fixedly at me, as though
  in a dream.</p>

  <p>"It can't be!" he muttered, hoarsely. "He could never have such a son as
  you. He was a coward!"</p>

  <p>"It's a lie!" I thundered&mdash;so vehemently that Sir Francis staggered
  back aghast. "Rupert Devereux!" I cried, taking a quick stride to his side,
  "can you dare you look me in the face and tell me that my father was a
  coward? You, who bribed John Hilton, your servant, into a shameful conspiracy
  that you might step into his place! You, you&mdash;speak, man, and tell me!
  Was Herbert Devereux a coward?"</p>

  <p>He was white to the lips with a fear not merely physical. His senses
  seemed stupefied; and though I waited amidst a deathlike silence for a full
  minute, he made me no answer. I turned my back upon him contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Sir Francis!" I cried, "he could lie to strangers and to you, but to me
  he dare not. Before heaven, I swear that my father is an innocent man,
  shamefully sinned against by him"&mdash;I pointed to my uncle. "Out of a mean
  jealousy, and for the sake of being your heir, he did it&mdash;he perjured
  himself. He to call himself a Devereux, and my father robbed of his name and
  honor by such treacherous villainy! Don't you wonder that I don't kill you?"
  I cried, turning round, a very tempest of passion surging up within me. "God
  knows why I don't do it! Sir Francis, I appeal to you. John Hilton has
  confessed to me that his story was a lie. My father is as brave a soldier and
  a gentleman as ever Devereux was. Tell me that you believe it. Let us make
  that man confess, aye, even though we have to tear his guilty secret from his
  heart!"</p>

  <p>Sir Francis had recovered himself entirely, and was again the
  aristocratic, unmovable soldier.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, my boy, I believe you," he said kindly. "Be my grandson, and I
  shall thank God for it, and be proud of you. But you are mistaken about your
  father. A court-martial never errs."</p>

  <p>The hope which had sprung up in my heart died away, and in its place had
  leaped up a bitter hatred&mdash;hatred of Rupert Devereux, hatred of my
  grandfather, hatred of Maud, of every one who refused to believe in my
  father's' innocence. I drew back from Sir Francis's outstretched band, and
  looked at him proudly.</p>

  <p>"Never, Sir Francis. I will not call myself your grandson, or take the
  name of Devereux, until my father bears it too. I would sooner live and die
  Hugh Arbuthnot."</p>

  <p>Then, without another look at one of them, without even a glance into
  Maud's white face, I turned, and walked slowly out of the gallery and out of
  the house.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-24"
     id="ch-24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; A MIDNIGHT VISITOR</h2>

  <p class="first">Like a man in a dream, I walked with unsteady footsteps down
  the avenue, through the shrubbery, and across the park to the cottage. I had
  forgotten my latchkey, and the servant who answered my ring welcomed me with
  a little cry of relief.</p>

  <p>"John was just a coming up to the house, for you, sir," she exclaimed,
  shutting the door again. "There's a strange woman wants to see you most
  particular. She's been here more than an hour, a fretting ever so because you
  wasn't here."</p>

  <p>"Where is she?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"In your study, sir. I see'd as there was nothink about as she could lay
  'er 'ands on before I let her in."</p>

  <p>I had no doubt but that it was the wife of one of the tenants on the
  estate, though why she should choose such a strange time for her visit I
  could not imagine. But when I walked into the study I saw at once that she
  was a stranger to me. And yet, no. I had seen her face before somewhere.</p>

  <p>She rose nervously when I entered, and pulled her shawl closer around
  her.</p>

  <p>"You'll excuse the liberty I've taken in coming, sir," she began,
  hurriedly. "I 'a come to do yer a service. You doant seem to recollect me.
  I'm John Hilton's wife; him as you comed to see t'other week."</p>

  <p>I recognised her at once, and became more interested.</p>

  <p>"You see, sir, it's like this," she went on. "My Jack, he's had one o' his
  drinking fits on, and he's always mortal mischievous after one of 'em. He
  seems to 'a got a powerful sort o' a grudge agin you, and there's that piece
  o' paper as you wrote out, and he put 'is name to. He says as 'ow he might
  get lagged for that if you showed it."</p>

  <p>"Well, has he sent you to try and get it away again?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Not he! If he know'd as I'd come 'ere at all he'd half kill me."</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it, then?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's just like this," she answered, slowly; "he's a coming himself
  to try and get it back agin."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! And when may I expect him?" I inquired, becoming suddenly
  interested.</p>

  <p>"To-night."</p>

  <p>I leaned back in my chair, and laughed dryly. The woman must be mad.</p>

  <p>'"Tain't no laughing matter, master," she said, sullenly. "You'd a laughed
  t'other side o' your mouth, I can tell 'ee, if I hadn' a chosen ter come and
  tell 'ee. He ain't a' coming to ask you for it. He's a coming to take it, and
  to pay yer back something as yer gave 'im at our cottage&mdash;him and a
  mate."</p>

  <p>I began to see what it all meant now, and to understand why the woman had
  come.</p>

  <p>"And you've come here to put me on my guard, is that it?" I remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Yer gave me money when I was starving, and I felt sort 'er grateful.
  And when I 'eard them two blackguards a planning how they'd settle you I
  thought as they just shouldn't. If you puts a bullet in that 'long Jem, which
  is my man's pal, I shall thank yer for it. Jack's bad enough, specially when
  he's just getting round from a spell o' drinking, which he is now; but he's a
  sight worse. Cuss him. He's always a leading my Jack into something."</p>

  <p>"What time are they coming?" I asked, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I 'eerd 'em say as they'd meet at Cop't Oak, which is a mile from here,
  as soon as it were dark, and hide until you was all a-gone to bed. I'm mortal
  afeard of their seeing me, although I shall go 'ome t'other way."</p>

  <p>I pressed her to stay at the cottage for the night, but she stubbornly
  refused. Her Jack would kill her if he found out that she had been here, she
  declared. But before she went I made her drink a glass of wine, and fill her
  pockets with the bread and food which I had ordered in.</p>

  <p>This promised to be an exciting night for me altogether, I thought, as I
  drew out my revolver from the cupboard and carefully loaded it. I was not
  inclined altogether to believe or altogether to disbelieve this woman's
  story, but at any rate there was no harm in being prepared. If I had gone to
  bed, there would have been little sleep for me with my head still throbbing
  with the vivid recollection of that terrible scene in the picture gallery. I
  dared not think of it, I dared not let my thoughts dwell for an instant on
  the inevitable consequences of what had happened. The excitement of what
  might shortly take place kept me from the full sickening realisation of the
  change which that evening's events must make in my life, but underneath it
  all there was a dull, aching pain in my heart, for had I not lost Maud?</p>

  <p>Presently Marian and Mr. Holdern arrived. I had forgotten their very
  existence, and directly the latter had taken his leave Marian was full of
  eager, agitated questions. Why had I left so suddenly? Had I quarrelled with
  Sir Francis Devereux? What did it all mean? Maud had gone to her room with
  white face and looking like a ghost, and Lady Olive had not again entered the
  dancing room. Sir Francis had apologised to his guests with the agitation of
  one who had received a great shock, and Rupert Devereux none of them had seen
  again; and I was mixed up in it. What did it all mean?</p>

  <p>She threw herself into my arms, and when I saw the gathering tears in her
  soft grey eyes, and her anxious, troubled look, I shrunk from the task before
  me.</p>

  <p>"Not now, Marian; I will tell you to-morrow; wait until then," I begged.
  But she would not wait.</p>

  <p>Then, with a great effort, I braced myself up, and told her everything.
  She listened with ever-growing astonishment, and when I had finished she
  slipped down from my knee and sank upon the hearthrug.</p>

  <p>"Poor papa!" she sobbed. "No wonder you hate that Rupert! Beast! Oh, Hugh,
  Hugh, why could yon not tell me before? I ought to have known," she added
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"It could have done no good," I answered.</p>

  <p>A wave of sudden anxiety passed across her face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Hugh!" she sobbed. "Char&mdash;Mr. Hold&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Holdern knows all about it," I interrupted. "I thought it right to
  tell him when he asked me for you."</p>

  <p>A great relief brightened her face, and she smiled through her tears. Even
  a woman is selfish when she is in love.</p>

  <p>"I am glad he knows," she whispered, looking into the fire. "How strange
  it all seems! Why our name is Devereux; you will be Sir Hugh Devereux. Why,
  Hugh, Devereux Court will be yours some day."</p>

  <p>"Never!" I answered, firmly; "until Sir Francis asks my father's pardon,
  and receives him as a son, I shall never take the name of Devereux or enter
  the Court. I have sworn it, Marian."</p>

  <p>"And it was noble of you to swear It, Hugh," she whispered, coming over
  and kissing me. "They say truth always comes out some time or other. Perhaps
  this will all come right some day."</p>

  <p>"For our father's sake, pray that it may do, Marian dear," I answered,
  gravely. "And now run along to bed, I have some writing to do."</p>

  <p>She lingered by my side.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, what are you going to do now? You will leave here, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I must, Marian. Unless Sir Francis desires otherwise, I shall remain here
  until he has found some one else to take my place, though, but it will be as
  Hugh Arbuthnot, his agent, only, and into Devereux Court I will not go again.
  It will be well for Rupert Devereux, too, that he keeps out of my way," I
  added to myself. "When does Mr. Holdern want to marry you, Marian?" I asked
  her suddenly, changing the subject.</p>

  <p>She blushed up to her eyes, and looked at me half pleased, half
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"Hugh! How could you ask me like that? I&mdash;I don't quite know."</p>

  <p>"Because you'll have to go away with me, you know," I continued. "I can't
  leave you behind."</p>

  <p>She looked serious enough now.</p>

  <p>"Of course you can't, Hugh; I don't think I ought to leave you at all.
  You'll be alone if I do, with no one to look after you."</p>

  <p>I pretended to look serious, as though considering the matter, but her
  piteous expression and quivering lips were irresistible, and I broke into a
  reassuring laugh.</p>

  <p>"Not I, Marian! It is the best thing that could possibly have happened.
  When I have no longer you to look after I shall go abroad wherever our father
  is and share his lot. Country life is beginning to get wearisome to me. I was
  meant to be a soldier, I think. Now, Marian, you must really go to bed. I
  want to be alone."</p>

  <p>It was past twelve, and I was beginning to get anxious. But she still
  lingered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, I had almost forgotten, I have something for you, and a
  message."</p>

  <p>I bent over my desk, lest she should see the light which sprung into my
  face. I did not wish even Marian to know my secret.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" I asked. "Be quick."</p>

  <p>"Why, she came to me like I've never seen her before, as lifeless and
  sorrowful as anything, and said, 'Tell your brother that I think he is
  behaving nobly, and that I hope we shall always be friends."</p>

  <p>"She said that!" I exclaimed, starting round, "Maud said that!"</p>

  <p>My sister looked at me amazed.</p>

  <p>"Maud! I didn't say anything about Maud!"</p>

  <p>"She didn't even speak to me. It was Lady Olive, and she sent you
  this."</p>

  <p>I stretched out my hand for the gold-topped cut-glass little smelling
  salts, which Marian was holding out for me and laid it down before me.
  Disappointed though I was, it was a kindly act of Lady Olive's, and I was
  just in that mood when a man appreciates such a one. For a moment or two I
  felt very tenderly towards Lady Olive; for, reckless little flirt though she
  was, she was generous and warm-hearted, or she would never have done
  this.</p>

  <p>"It is very kind of her," I said, huskily. "Good night, Marian!"</p>

  <p>"Good night, Hughie. Don't sit up late, dear, and don't fret. It makes me
  feel so selfish, Hugh, to think that I can't help being happy
  because&mdash;because of Charlie, but I can't help it. I do love him so, and
  he is so good to me."</p>

  <p>Then at last she went, and I was left alone. First of all I put a heavy
  shade upon the lamp and placed it so that no one could possibly see it from
  outside. Then I finished loading my revolver, and put a life-preserver in my
  breast pocket. Going out on tip toe into the hall, I opened the passage door,
  and also left my own wide open, so that if any one should attempt to enter
  the house from any room I must hear them. This seemed to me to be all that I
  could do, and drawing my easy chair into the corner of the room which faced
  both door and windows, I sat down and waited patiently with my revolver on my
  knee.</p>

  <p>At first the time did not seem long. I had come to a crisis in my life,
  and there was much for me to think about. In the twenties, however dark and
  doubtful the future may be, there is always a certain fascination connected
  with it&mdash;possibilities, however remote, which the sanguine spirit of
  youth loves to peer into and investigate. And so I sat and thought, and
  considered, and longed, without ever getting sleepy, or feeling the spell of
  weariness.</p>

  <p>Two o'clock struck, and of a sudden a curious change came over me. I
  became so violently restless that I could sit no longer in my chair.
  Sober-minded people may scoff at such a statement, but I declare that some
  irresistible impulse compelled me to go to the nearest window and look
  cautiously out.</p>

  <p>The window was not one of the front ones, but was one which looked
  sideways over a strip of garden, a thick privet hedge, into a dark black fir
  plantation, through which ran a private pathway into the gardens of the
  court. At first I could see nothing; then suddenly the blood died out from my
  cheeks, even from my lips, and I stood transfixed, rooted to the
  spot&mdash;my limbs numbed and helpless as though under the spell of some
  hideous nightmare.</p>

  <p>What my eyes looked upon my reason refused to credit. Turning from the
  hand-gate of the plantation, without a hat, and with a wealth of golden hair
  streaming down upon a swansdown cloak was Maud! It was impossible&mdash;it
  was ridiculous&mdash;it was beyond all credence. And yet my straining,
  riveted eyes watched her walk slowly, with her usual stately, even tread,
  down the grass-grown path between the plantation and the hedge of the cottage
  garden, and disappear from sight.</p>

  <p>Though an earthquake had yawned at my feet I could not have moved. Nothing
  but sound can break up such a spell as this sudden shock had laid upon me.
  And the sound came, for suddenly there broke upon the stillness of the night
  such a cry as I had never heard before&mdash;the thrilling, agonised shriek
  of a woman in mortal fear.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-25"
     id="ch-25"></a>XXV. &mdash; COUSINS</h2>

  <p class="first">Like the shock from a galvanic battery did that sound
  breathe life into my frozen limbs. Holding a chair before my face I literally
  burst through the high French windows, crashing the glass and splintering the
  framework into a thousand pieces. With the cry of a wild beast I dashed
  across the lawn and leaped over the privet hedge. Maud, my Maud, was scarcely
  a dozen yards from me, struggling in the grasp of the man who had come to rob
  me of his confession, with his great hand pressed against her wild, beautiful
  face to stop her cries.</p>

  <p>They heard me coming, and he half released her, and with his other hand
  pointed a revolver at me. But passion must have lent me wings, for before he
  could pull the trigger I had dashed it into the air, where it exploded
  harmlessly, and with my clenched fist I struck him such a blow as I had never
  struck before or since. He was a powerful man, with a thick, bullet-shaped
  head, but he went down like a log, and well nigh never rose again. His
  companion, without a word, turned and ran across the park like a hare, and I
  let him go.</p>

  <p>Maud was in my arms, sobbing hysterically, Maud with the moon shining down
  on her blanched but exquisite face, and her white arms thrown around my neck.
  If she were the daughter of a prince of hell she was still the woman I loved;
  and I stooped and covered her cold face and lips with passionate kisses. Then
  I caught her up in my arms, for she was shivering, and ran with her to the
  house.</p>

  <p>Every one had been roused by the sound of my exit, and the report of the
  revolver. Marian, with her dressing-gown loosely wrapped around her, was
  standing trembling at the head of the stairs, and behind her were the
  servants more frightened even than she. When she saw me cross the hall with
  Maud's lifeless form (for her faint seemed almost the faint of death) in my
  arms, she gave vent to one cry of blank amazement and horror, and then
  hurried down to us.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, Hugh," she whispered, clinging to me as I laid my burden down on
  the sofa, and fell on my knees by its side. "Maud here! Maud out in the park
  at this time of night! What has happened, Hugh? What does it all mean?"</p>

  <p>"Can't you see?" I muttered hoarsely, never withdrawing my eyes from the
  white, cold face. "She has had a fright, and has fainted!"</p>

  <p>"But what on earth has brought her here-out at this time of night? And in
  her slippers, too!"</p>

  <p>I was on the point of saying that I knew no more than she, but suddenly
  the truth flashed into my mind. Maud had walked out in her sleep! I had heard
  her say that for a long time she had been obliged to have her maid in her
  room at night, and sleep with locked doors; and that when Sir Francis lay
  dangerously ill not many years ago, nearly every night when she had gone to
  bed thinking of him, she had risen in her sleep and tried to make her way to
  his room. Then she must have been thinking of me! A sudden thrill of joy
  passed through me at the thought, and Marian looked at me in stupefied
  bewilderment to see the smile which for a moment parted my lips.</p>

  <p>"She must have come out in her sleep, Marian," I whispered. "There were
  some men hanging about outside&mdash;poachers, I suppose-and they have
  frightened her. Get some brandy, quick! And tell one of the girls to light a
  fire. We must have some hot water."</p>

  <p>She hurried away, and the door had scarcely closed when Maud changed her
  position slightly, and her lips moved. I bent my ear close over her, and this
  is what I heard:</p>

  <p>"Hugh! Hugh!"</p>

  <p>My heart throbbed with a great joy. Suddenly I stooped down and kissed her
  half open lips passionately. Then I drew back and stood upright, for I saw
  that she was fast recovering consciousness.</p>

  <p>First her breathing became deeper and less fitful. Then, with a little
  sigh, she opened her eyes and raised herself a little on her elbow.</p>

  <p>She looked around in blank bewilderment. Then her eyes fell upon me, and
  the hot color rushed into her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot! Why, where am I? How did I come here? and those men," she
  added, with a shudder, "those fearful men; was it all a dream?"</p>

  <p>She raised her hand to her forehead and looked at me appealingly. I
  hardened my voice as much as possible, and avoided meeting her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I think I can explain to you what has happened," I said. "You must have
  got up in your sleep, and walked clown through the copse. There were some men
  outside; I believe they were going to try and break in here, and one of them
  must have caught hold of you, for when I heard your scream and ran out, you
  were struggling in his grasp. I knocked him down and the other one ran away.
  Then I carried you here, and here you are. Marian has just gone out to fetch
  some brandy."</p>

  <p>Womanlike, her first thought was of her appearance, and she sat up and
  looked at herself eagerly. Evidently she had fallen asleep before preparing
  to retire, for the only change in her dress since the evening was that she
  had exchanged her dinner-gown for a long white dressing-robe, and let down
  her hair. Nevertheless, she blushed as she sat up, and looked at me, pushing
  back the waves of hair from her face.</p>

  <p>"I remember falling asleep in the easy chair," she said, slowly, "and
  after that everything seems like a horrid dream. Those men's fearful faces,
  and you&mdash;oh, how fierce you looked! But it all seems very
  indistinct."</p>

  <p>Then Marian came in, and she turned to her smiling.</p>

  <p>"Miss Arbuthnot, I'm afraid you'll think this a very unceremonious morning
  call. You didn't know I was a sleep-walker, did you?"</p>

  <p>Marian put down the decanter she was carrying with a little cry of
  relief.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, I'm so glad to see you all right again. What an awful adventure
  you've had!"</p>

  <p>Maud smiled placidly. She was her old self again, stately and
  composed.</p>

  <p>"It might have been a great deal worse but for your brother," she
  acknowledged; "I wonder if they've found out at the Court. They'll be getting
  a little anxious if they have."</p>

  <p>"Unless I'm very much mistaken they've found out," I answered.
  "Listen."</p>

  <p>I went out and threw open the hall door. Clearly enough we could hear the
  alarm bell at the Court clanging out with shrill, quick strokes, and the
  whole of the park seemed dotted with men carrying lanterns, looking like
  will-o'-the-wisps, and making the soft night air echo with their hoarse
  shouts. Two figures were rapidly approaching the cottage, and I hailed
  them.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen anything of Miss Devereux?" called out Groves, the head
  butler. "She's out in the park somewhere a-walking in her sleep."</p>

  <p>"She is here," I answered, and then went in and told Maud that they had
  come for her.</p>

  <p>Marian left us to find a warmer cloak, and thicker shoes, and for a moment
  we were together. She turned to me at once with a sweet, sad smile on her
  lips, and a look of regret shining out of the azure depths of her dim
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot, I had quite forgotten, in all this excitement, what
  happened in the picture gallery. We are cousins, are we not?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"It is not a relationship which I shall claim," I answered, slowly. "If I
  should see you again before I go, Miss Devereux, it will be as Mr.
  Arbuthnot."</p>

  <p>Her eyes were speaking to me&mdash;speaking words which her lips could not
  utter, but I avoided them.</p>

  <p>Eager voices were hurrying through the garden, and Maud held out her hand
  with a hurried gesture.</p>

  <p>"At any rate, you will let me thank you for your timely aid this evening.
  But for you I don't know what might not have happened."</p>

  <p>I took her hand and raised it to my lips. Then I let it drop, and moved
  towards the door.</p>

  <p>"I think I ought to thank you rather," I answered, with a pretence at a
  laugh, "for giving me the alarm. If those fellows had got into the house and
  taken me by surprise, things might have been worse for me, at any rate."</p>

  <p>I opened the door and admitted Groves and several of the other servants.
  Francis Devereux was there, too, but he stood on the pathway outside, without
  offering to enter, neither did I invite him. Maud went out to him at once,
  and then I explained to the gaping little crowd what had happened.</p>

  <p>"What became of the one you knocked over, sir?" asked Groves, after the
  little chorus of wondering exclamations had subsided.</p>

  <p>"There now, most likely," I answered, with a start. "I'd forgotten all
  about him."</p>

  <p>We all trooped over to the spot, and there he lay, doubled up in the
  underwood, his face drawn with pain, and still unconscious. To say that I was
  sorry for him would, have been a lie; nay, if Rupert Devereux had lain by his
  side I should have been only the better pleased. But he lay so still and
  motionless that I stooped over him anxiously, and felt his heart. It was
  beating, though faintly, and I felt distinctly relieved when I looked up
  again.</p>

  <p>"He's alive," I declared, "but only just. Better get him some brandy."</p>

  <p>They brought him some from the house, and I poured it between his lips. He
  revived at once.</p>

  <p>"We'd a best take him up to the Court, sir," remarked Groves. "You won't
  want him down here with only yourself in the house."</p>

  <p>So they took him away, and as the long streaks of red light in the east
  slowly deepened until the autumn sun rose up from behind the pine trees like
  a ball of glowing fire, I threw myself down on the couch and slept.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-26"
     id="ch-26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; I GIVE WARNING</h2>

  <p class="first">By ten o'clock in the morning I had written a letter which
  had caused me a good deal of trouble and anxiety. It was to Sir Francis
  Devereux:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"The Cottage, Devereux,</p>

  <p class="letter">"Wednesday morning.</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir Francis
  Devereux</span>,&mdash;You will, I am sure, agree with me that the revelation
  of last evening renders it imperative on my part to leave Devereux at once,
  or as soon as possible. I must ask you, therefore, to accept this note as an
  intimation of my desire to do so as soon as is convenient to yourself.</p>

  <p class="letter">"No one could regret more than I do the necessity which has
  arisen, and I am deeply sensible of all your kindness to myself and to my
  sister. But, under the circumstances, it would be, of course, quite
  impossible for me to remain here as your agent, nor I am sure would you wish
  it. As to the other offer which you were generous enough to make, the answer
  which I gave you at the time is absolutely irrevocable.</p>

  <p class="letter">"With regard to the attempted burglary here last night and
  assault upon Miss Devereux, I shall be prepared to give evidence when the man
  is charged. There are several matters connected with the estate with which I
  will not now trouble you, but which I shall be glad to lay before you or Mr.
  Bensome before I go. My books I am prepared to hand over to my successor or
  to Mr. Bensome at any moment.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Thanking you again for the uniform and, I fear, undeserved
  kindness which I have always received from you, I remain, yours
  obediently,</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Hugh Arbuthnot</span>.</p>

  <p class="letter">"To Colonel Sir Francis Devereux, Bart."</p><br>

  <p>Having dispatched this, I ordered Black Prince, and rode away to a distant
  part of the estate to superintend the felling of some timber. As usual, when
  going any distance, I took some luncheon in my pocket, and ate it on a stile
  whilst the men knocked off for dinner. Just as I had lit my pipe and was
  preparing to start work again&mdash;for I was not afraid of using my hands,
  and used to take a pleasure in getting through as much as any of the
  men&mdash;I heard the sound of horses' hoofs on the smooth, wide, velvet
  sward, and glancing up quickly saw that the whole party from the Court were
  close upon me, all except Maud and the elders.</p>

  <p>I drew back indifferently to let them pass, and bowed lo Lady Olive, who
  was riding by the side of Francis Devereux. She started when she saw me, and,
  detaching herself from the rest of the party, rode over to me.</p>

  <p>"Fancy coming upon you, Mr. Arbuthnot, and hard at work, too! What are you
  doing?"</p>

  <p>"Cutting down trees, Lady Olive."</p>

  <p>"Well, you look in a nice mess," she declared, frankly. "What do you want
  to work yourself for? It's a shame that you should."</p>

  <p>I laughed at her indignation, thinking only that her flushed cheeks made
  her look uncommonly pretty.</p>

  <p>"I like working," I answered, "What would you have me do? Shack about with
  my hands in my pocket all day?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said, hotly. "But when I think of that idle, lazy
  young Francis dawdling his life away, doing nothing except ape a man about
  town; and then think of you working hard every day, and remember who you are,
  it makes me feel angry. Do you know, I longed just now to push him out of his
  saddle. It wouldn't take much, I think."</p>

  <p>I laughed outright, but Lady Olive remained serious enough.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps you'll be pleased to hear that I am going to give up
  working&mdash;here, at any rate," I said. "Of course I can't stop now."</p>

  <p>She looked steadily between her horse's ears, growing a shade paler; and I
  leaned against the stump of an oak-tree wondering how a riding-habit could
  have been made to fit so well, and admiring her dainty little figure.</p>

  <p>"When are you going?" she asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>I shrugged my shoulders.</p>

  <p>"As soon as Sir Francis will let me. I have 'given warning.'"</p>

  <p>She looked down at me, and spoke; a little hurriedly, but with a frank,
  sincere look in her flushed face.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot&mdash;I suppose I must call you Mr. Arbuthnot&mdash;I think
  yours is the saddest story I have ever heard. I want you to let me tell you
  that I feel for you, as much as any one possibly could do, and I think you
  are behaving splendidly, just as I would have my own brother behave if he
  were in the same position."</p>

  <p>I felt more moved even than I should have cared to own, for I was just in
  that mood when kind words are sweet, and I had always liked Lady Olive.</p>

  <p>"You are very good," I said, warmly. "Believe me; it is a great pleasure
  to me to hear you say this."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea yet where you are going?" she asked, "or what you are
  going to do?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"To London, first, and then I shall try and discover my father, and get
  him to let me throw in my lot with his. Somehow I think that I shall end by
  being a soldier. It's in the blood, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot," she said, frankly, stretching out her hand, "may we not
  be friends? I have never asked so much of a man be fore, but, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I took her little hand, and did not at once release it.</p>

  <p>"I shall be always glad to think of you as such," I said, warmly; "but I'm
  afraid it isn't very likely that we shall meet again, after I leave here. My
  life and yours will lie very far apart."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure of that," she answered, with an attempt at gaiety. "I'm
  going to travel about a good deal next year; and&mdash;and Mr. Arbuthnot,"
  she added, coloring a little deeper, "I know you'll forgive me for saying it,
  but my father&mdash;he's ambassador at Rome now, you know&mdash;has a good
  deal of influence in London, and especially at the Foreign Office, and if
  there was anything we could do for you&mdash;oh, you know what I want to
  say," she broke off suddenly, and looking away that I might not see the tears
  in her eyes. "You may want to try and got some appointment abroad or
  something, or even if you decided to go into the army, he might be useful to
  you, and he would do anything I asked him. He is very kind, and&mdash;and it
  would make me very happy to feel that we were helping you a little."</p>

  <p>Was it so great a sin that for a moment I longed to draw that tearful
  little face down to mine and kiss it? I had never been in the least danger of
  falling in love with Lady Olive, bright and fascinating though she was, but
  at that moment it occurred to me that the man who won her would be a very
  fortunate man indeed.</p>

  <p>"Lady Olive," I said earnestly, "I scarcely know how to thank you. I
  cannot tell you how much I feel your kindness. I shall take you at your word,
  and write you if ever I need any help, and if I do not I shall always like to
  think of your offer."</p>

  <p>She smiled down at me beamingly.</p>

  <p>"I am so glad you're not offended. Of course I shall see you again before
  you go, and I will bring you down a card with my address in London. Good bye.
  No, <i>au revoir</i>."</p>

  <p>She touched her horse with the whip and galloped away after the others,
  and the bright winter's day seemed to me less bright when she had gone. I
  watched her out of sight, and at the bend of the grassy road she turned round
  in her saddle and waved her whip. I returned her farewell with my hat, then,
  when she disappeared, I went back to my place amongst the men, and worked
  till the perspiration streamed down my face, and I was obliged to take off my
  coat and hang it on a branch of a fallen tree. But I felt all the better for
  it, for it has always seemed to me, as it did then, that hard physical labor
  is the most magnificent relaxation for an over-wrought mind. When the sun set
  and our day's work was over, I was stiff and my arms were sore, but my heart
  was lighter than it had been since this crisis had come. I stood filling my
  pipe and chatting to the foreman whilst one of the laborers had gone for my
  horse, until he, too, followed the others, and I was left alone.</p>

  <p>At least I thought so, but I was mistaken. A voice, croaking and weak,
  almost at my shoulder, suddenly startled me, and I turned round to find an
  old woman, bent double, leaning on her stick, with her bead-like eyes fixed
  upon me.</p>

  <p>"Who be'st you?" she said. "Be you him as they call the agent?"</p>

  <p>I acknowledged that it was so, and that my name was Arbuthnot.</p>

  <p>"It's a loi," she answered deliberately. "Dost think that Sarah Milsham
  knaw'st not a Devereux when she seest one? Be'st thou Muster Herbert's son?
  God bless him."</p>

  <p>I looked around anxiously, but there was not a soul in sight.</p>

  <p>"Thou be'st a son o' my Mr. Herbert," she muttered. "I knaw'st thou be'st
  so like him that I thought thee was a ghost, boy. What be'st thou a doing
  here? Wheres't thy father?"</p>

  <p>"Abroad, mother, since you know me. Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Who be I?" she laughed, a mirthless, unpleasant laugh. "Why, thee hasna'
  heard of Sarah Milsham? I nursed your father when he were a baby. What be'st
  a doing here boy? Hast come to kill Rupert Devereux?"</p>

  <p>"He deserves it," I cried, hotly.</p>

  <p>"So afore God he does," cried the old hag, tremulously, "and die he will,
  for I ha' seen the mark o' death upon his forehead. But it'll be no by your
  hand, no by your hand, boy. What be'st a doing here? Go to thy father, boy!
  Why hast left him alone?"</p>

  <p>"I am going," I answered. "Please God, I shall be with him before many
  months."</p>

  <p>"Ay, go, boy, go," she quivered out, "and tell him this from me. Tell him
  that sure as Devereux Court is built upon a rock, I, Sarah Milsham, shall
  live to see him here again. Sure as that limb of hell, Rupert Devereux, bears
  the seal of death upon his forehead, so sure the day will come when the whole
  country shall welcome him home again, and old Sir Francis shall be proud t'
  own him for his son. Tell him Sarah Milsham said so."</p>

  <p>She hobbled away into the wood and commenced picking up sticks. I would
  have followed her, but she held out her hand to prevent me, and would not
  answer me when I spoke. So I mounted Black Prince and galloped away
  homewards.</p>

  <p>When I entered Marian's room I saw that she had a visitor. Sir Francis
  Devereux was leaning back in my easy chair, laughing at one of my sister's
  quaint speeches, and she was handing him a cup of tea.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-27"
     id="ch-27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; SIR FRANCIS DEVEREUX'S APPEAL</h2>

  <p class="first">Of all the contingencies which had occurred to me, this was
  one which I had not considered, for only once since I had been its occupant
  had Sir Francis called at the cottage. But his greeting was even a greater
  surprise to me.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, my boy," he said, rising and hold ing out his hand, "I have come
  down to have a chat with you, and Miss Marian has been giving me some
  tea."</p>

  <p>Something in his look, his accent, and his words warned me that the battle
  of last night would have to be fought over again. But for a while he talked
  of nothing, save of last night's strange adventure and minor matters
  connected with the estate, of the turnip prospects, and the timber felling,
  until Marian left us to change her frock. Then, after opening the door for
  her with his usual stately courtesy, he returned to the hearth-rug, and with
  the firelight playing around his tall, slim figure, and with a soft, almost
  appealing light relaxing the hard lines in his face, he commenced
  speaking.</p>

  <p>"Hugh," he said, slowly, "they call me a proud man, but I have come here
  to beg a great boon from you. Nay, let me go on," for I would have
  interrupted him. "Let me say outright what I have come to say," he continued,
  stretching out his hands as though to silence me. "I want to tell you a
  little of my history."</p>

  <p>"You know, perhaps, that I was married twice. To you I do not mind
  admitting that my last marriage was an unfortunate one. Your grandmother was
  the only woman I ever loved, and it was her son who took her place in my
  heart&mdash;not Rupert's mother, much less Rupert himself. Perhaps I am much
  to blame, but none the less it is a fact that the death of my second wife
  gave me little sorrow, and I have never been able to feel towards Rupert as a
  father should feel towards his son. And since that day when I knew that it
  was his evidence (although he was right to give it) which had brought
  irretrievable disgrace upon the name of Devereux, I have never been
  able&mdash;I say it to my shame-I have' never been able to bear the sight of
  him."</p>

  <p>Sir Francis walked restlessly to the other end of the room, and then,
  returning, took up his old position.</p>

  <p>"For twenty years, Hugh, I have been a lonely, unhappy man. Gradually I
  began to loose all pride and interest in our family name, and even the court
  itself, every stone of which was once dear to me. Everything that had made
  life endurable for me and pleasant had gone. My pride in, and love for, my
  son who had gone away with my blessing to be where a Devereux should always
  be, in his country's battles, was suddenly blasted for ever. He disgraced our
  long line of ancestors, disgraced himself and me, and instead of falling on
  his sword, as he should have done, came home here, turned out of the
  army&mdash;a Devereux turned out of the army to beg for my forgiveness!"</p>

  <p>My heart was burning, but I judged it wisest to hold my peace, he had
  thrown his head back, and his eyes were sparkling with anger. His frowning
  face was as stern and hard as marble, and, old man though he was, he looked
  terrible.</p>

  <p>For a moment there was silence, and then he went on&mdash;"Enough of him!
  If it had been Rupert I might some day have forgiven him. But Herbert, my
  eldest son, who at my death must be the head of the Devereuxs&mdash;oh, it is
  a cursed, cruel thing!"</p>

  <p>He turned his back upon me, and I heard a sort of gasping sob. I made a
  pretence of stirring the fire, and when I had finished he was himself
  again.</p>

  <p>"For twenty years," he went on, "I have lived alone with a leaden weight
  of misery dragging me down almost to the grave. And yet I have struggled
  against death for the simple reason that the thought of that disgraced man
  who was once my son calling himself the head of the Devereuxs, and lying down
  to rest within the walls of Devereux Court, has kept me hanging on to life.
  My son a coward! To run away from the enemy! My God, what had I done to
  deserve this?"</p>

  <p>"He was not a coward," I interrupted, passionately. "Rupert lied! I know
  he lied! He was jealous! John Hilton has confessed to me!"</p>

  <p>Sir Francis shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"The word of a servant discharged without a character is worth very
  little, especially when it is directed against his master," he said. "No,
  Hugh, my boy, if you had lived as long as I have, and had been a soldier, you
  would know that a court-martial never errs. It never convicts except on
  overwhelming evidence, and its judgments are absolute. General Luxton came to
  see me when he returned to England, and from him I learned the undoubted
  truth."</p>

  <p>I remained silent. One might as well have talked to the Sphinx as to this
  coldly obstinate, dogmatic old soldier.</p>

  <p>"I have come to make you an offer, Hugh," he went on in an altogether
  different tone of voice, "or rather to make you a request, and I beg you to
  remember that it is one which lies very near an old man's heart. I am
  childless and lonely, and weary of seeing none but girls' faces around me.
  Come and live with me as my grandson! Let that subject, on which we can never
  agree, be buried between us! Why should you go away on a wild goose chase?
  Devereux Court is your natural home. Come and live there."</p>

  <p>I stood up and faced him. He was very much in earnest, I could see, for
  the long white hand which rested upon the chimney piece was shaking, and his
  eyes were eagerly searching my face for its answer; but what it read there
  could not have been encouraging, for I never wavered for an instant.</p>

  <p>"Sir Francis," I asked, firmly, "does a Devereux over break his oath or
  neglect his duty?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "Never!"</p>

  <p>"Neither will I, then," I answered; "my duty would never urge me to
  renounce my father, whose innocence I firmly believe in, and if I did I
  should break my oath, Sir Francis. I feel for you, and I love Devereux. But
  what you ask I distinctly and absolutely refuse."</p>

  <p>He walked to the window, and stood there foe a moment gazing across the
  park, with his hands behind him. Then he turned round suddenly and commenced
  drawing on his dog skin gloves. He held himself up in his usual stiff,
  soldierly manner, but I could see that he was hurt and deeply
  disappointed.</p>

  <p>"More than I have said I cannot say," he remarked, quietly. "Good bye,
  Hugh, make my apologies to your sister."</p>

  <p>I walked with him to the door, and watched him walk across the park with
  head bent more than usual, and slow, weary footsteps. Oh, that I could
  succeed in my life's desire, and bring him home the son he loved! What would
  I not give to attain my end! And yet, save through my Uncle Rupert, how could
  I possibly succeed? My Uncle Rupert! Was it not strange that Maud's father
  should be the man whom I hated more than any one or anything on earth!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-28"
     id="ch-28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; GOODBYE TO DEVEREUX COURT</h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Holdern dined with us that evening, and when he and I
  had the table to ourselves, and little clouds of blue smoke began to curl
  upwards to the ceiling, he made a sudden request to me.</p>

  <p>"I want you to let me have Marian at once," he said. "Why not let us be
  married before you go away?"</p>

  <p>I raised but few objections, for the plan suited me. But Marian, when we
  told her, protested that a month was much too soon. Strangely enough,
  however, when I took her view, and rescinded my consent, she went over to the
  other side; so I gave in, and it was settled as they wished. An aunt of Mr.
  Holdern's was written for, and arrived in a few days in a most excited state,
  with two tin trunks and a box of caps. A dressmaker took up her abode in our
  other spare room and peace at the cottage was at an end. Even in my sanctum I
  was never safe, for Marian would keep waltzing in with her mouth full of pins
  and her hair all disarranged, to beseech me to give my opinion as to the
  draping of a gown, or to inquire shyly with a blushing face, whether I
  thought Charlie would like this or that! Altogether those few last weeks at
  the cottage were not quiet ones.</p>

  <p>Lady Olive came often and assisted eagerly at the grave consultations. But
  I saw her only for a moment or two now and then, for there were many things
  on the estate which needed my attention just then, especially as I was going
  so soon, and I was out most nights till long after our usual dinner-hour.</p>

  <p>Once Maud came, but I did not see her, and I was glad of it. If it had
  been possible, I would have left Devereux without another word with her. But
  that was not to be.</p>

  <p>On the morning before the wedding I saddled Black Prince myself, and took
  him out for a farewell ride. I would sooner say farewell to a man than to a
  horse any day! The Black Prince had been my chief companion at Devereux, and
  a very faithful one, too. He had never been the same to any one else, they
  told me; in fact, he had got the name of being a brute, but whenever I
  entered the stable he would whinny and rub his head against my coat-sleeve,
  holding it there sometimes, and looking up at me out of his mild, brown eyes
  as though imploring me to take him. out. And now I was riding him for the
  last time! For the last time I watched him stretch out his legs for a gallop,
  and felt him bound away under me as he thundered over the turf. For the last
  time he picked up his legs as clean as a Leicestershire hunter, and flew over
  the park railings like a bird. And then who should we meet, as though to
  spoil our ride, but Maud and her father cantering over the moor towards us,
  Maud with flashing eyes and a color springing into her soft cheeks as she
  waved her whip ever so slightly, with a half-imperative gesture. But I would
  see none of it. What had Black Prince and I to do with them? Nobly he
  answered my whisper, and cleared the high stone wall which separated us, and
  left them on their way to the house, whilst he and I flew on towards the
  desolate moorland, heedless whither we went, so that we were alone.</p>

  <p>Three days more and I shall be away&mdash;out of temptation, out of
  Paradise, alone in the world, with my life's work before me. What matter!
  Banish such thoughts&mdash;away with them! Away with that sweet, sad face,
  with its proud lips and sorrowing eyes! What are these to my Prince and I,
  whilst we fly across the moorland, over hedges and fences, with the earth
  skimming beneath and the windswept sky clear and bright above! Live the
  present! Bury the past! Welcome the future! Regrets and haunting memories are
  the plagues of the devil. The Black Prince and I will have none of them.</p>

  <p>Ah! that was a wild ride. The wonder to me now is that we ever reached
  home safely. But we did, and when we got there I led him into the stable
  myself, and took the bit out of his mouth, and the saddle from his back. I
  watched him munch his corn, and daintily thrust his nose into the bucket of
  chilled water, and when I turned away and walked into the house there was a
  lump in my throat.</p>

  <p>A gentleman was waiting to see me in my study, I was told&mdash;and
  without asking his name, and with very little curiosity, I crossed the hall
  and entered the room. Then I gave a great start, and my fingers closed upon
  my riding-whip, for upon the hearthrug, hat in hand, stood my Uncle
  Rupert!</p>

  <p>Had he not been Maud's father I should have taken him by the neck and
  thrown him from the house. As it was, I stood waiting with the door in my
  hand and an angry sparkle in my eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are not pleased to see me, Mr. Arbuthnot," he began, nervously. "I
  did not expect that you would be. But my daughter tells me that she has
  scarcely thanked you for your gallant behavior the other night, and, as her
  father, I trusted that I might be permitted to come and offer you my most
  heartfelt thanks."</p>

  <p>And this was my Uncle Rupert! this tall, thin man with the eager eyes and
  nervous manner, and sad, sweet tone. For, though I hated him, I could not
  help noticing that I had never heard a man's voice more pleasant to listen
  to. Whence had come the affected manners and thinly veiled snobbism of my
  cousin Francis? Not from his father.</p>

  <p>"I fear that Miss Devereux, in her very natural terror, has exaggerated
  the service I was fortunate enough to be able to render her," I answered
  icily. "I trust that she has recovered from the shock."</p>

  <p>"Quite, thank you. Mr. Arbuthnot, there was another reason which brought
  me here. All through my life&mdash;which has been a most unhappy one&mdash;I
  have constantly been troubled with the reflection that, though innocently
  (that you will not believe, but no matter), I was the cause of poor
  Herbert's, your father's trouble. If I could render his son even the
  slightest service it would be a great happiness to me. You are going to
  London, I hear. You know no one there, and you have no friends. Could you not
  make my house your home? You will not take the name of Devereux, I hear, but
  Mr. Arbuthnot would always be a welcome and an honored guest."</p>

  <p>"You have a conscience, then, Rupert Devereux?" I said, quietly.</p>

  <p>He looked at me appealingly, flushing to the very roots of his hair.</p>

  <p>"I scarcely understand," he began, hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"Let me explain, then," I said, looking at him steadily. "It seems to me
  that, having wrecked my father's life by a deliberate conspiracy, you are now
  seeking to expiate that most damnable sin by conferring favors upon his son.
  It will not do, Rupert Devereux!"</p>

  <p>I should have pitied him had he been any other man, for he stood there
  looking distressed and disappointed. But, remembering who it was, I watched
  him with a bitter, sneering smile.</p>

  <p>"Then there is nothing more to be said, I suppose," he remarked, with a
  sigh. "I had better go."</p>

  <p>"You had better go," I echoed. "The only words I shall ever care to hear
  from your lips will be a confession of your villainous lie. I cannot believe
  that you will have the courage to die with that foul sin on your
  conscience."</p>

  <p>He moved his position, and then for the first time I remarked how like he
  was in the outline of the face and the features to Maud. But the niceness
  softened me not one whit towards him, whilst it made me feel harder towards
  her. He moved towards the door with a dejected gesture.</p>

  <p>"You are very hard," he said, in a low tone, "very hard for one so young.
  But I dare say that, according to your view of the matter, you are right,
  quite right. If you won't let me help you in any way, you won't. It's only
  another disappointment in a life of disappointments. I must go, then, Mr.
  Arbuthnot. But if at any time you should change your mind, come to me. I live
  in Mayfair, London."</p>

  <p>He walked out, and, without answering his farewell, I opened the door, and
  let him go in silence. This was my first interview with my Uncle Rupert.</p>

  <p>On the morrow Marian was married to Mr. Holdern. It was a very quiet
  wedding down at the village church, but it went off very pleasantly, and
  Marian looked charming in her plain white satin gown and simple veil. As we
  were entering the church I had a great surprise. Sir Francis Devereux, in a
  black frock coat, and with an orchid in his buttonhole, called me on one side
  for a moment, and asked for permission to give away the bride. I would have
  preferred refusing such an unusual request&mdash;unusual, at any rate, as it
  would seem to those who knew us as Mr. and Miss Arbuthnot&mdash;but he looked
  so much in earnest that I could not find it in my heart to hurt his feelings.
  So, in ignorance of what they were beholding, the villagers of Devereux saw
  Sir Francis give his granddaughter away, whilst I, his grandson, stood a few
  yards behind.</p>

  <p>A woman once told me she always felt inclined to cry at weddings and laugh
  at funerals. I can understand it. There is something in the former
  exquisitely, though covertly, pathetic; whilst in the latter case tears are
  so obviously the correct thing, that sometimes they absolutely refuse to
  come. I feel certain that the tears were not far from Sir Francis's eyes as
  he shook hands with us in the churchyard. Perhaps they were not far from
  mine.</p>

  <p>There were presents from nearly every one at the Court, and a sealed
  envelope from Sir Francis, which, when we opened it, contained a cheque for a
  thousand pounds. I had offered to make over to Marian half of my little
  income, but Mr. Holdern was resolute, and oven peremptory, in his refusal.
  They would have a good deal more money now than they could spend in their
  quiet country home, and eventually, feeling that Holdern was sincere in his
  refusal, I had given way. Money would certainly he useful, nay, necessary,
  for me in carrying out the course of action on which I had decided. And so I
  kept it.</p>

  <p>One day longer I had to spend at Devereux, and a dreary day it was. All
  the morning I was busy balancing accounts, with the solicitor to the estate,
  and In the afternoon I finished my packing. In the evening, after dinner, I
  wrote a note to Sir Francis, bidding him farewell. He would understand, I
  said, why I did not come to him personally. An oath was not a thing to be
  broken, and I had sworn that over the threshold of Devereux Court I would not
  pass save with my father. So I was compelled to write him instead, but I did
  my best to make my letter as cordial and grateful as possible, and within an
  hour an answer came back, short and informal.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Farewell, Hugh, my boy. God bless you, wherever you may
  go, and remember always that though you may call yourself Hugh Arbuthnot, you
  are still a Devereux of Devereux, and this place is your home whenever you
  care to make it so.&mdash;Ever yours,<br>
  <br>
  "<span class="smcap">Francis Devereux</span>."</p><br>

  <p>Through many lands and many years I carried with me that half-sheet of
  thick, heavily-crested notepaper. And yellow with age it reposes now in the
  secret drawer of my cabinet.</p>

  <p>I sent no farewell to Maud. It were better not. My Maud she could never
  be, though never another should take her place. Me she would soon forget; I
  was not vain enough to think otherwise for a moment. Only yesterday I had
  seen her riding with that ill-bred prig, Lord Annerley, the son of a lawyer
  peer, with all his father's innate vulgarity, and never a feather's weight of
  his brains. Let her have him if she would, him or any other&mdash;or let her
  flirt with him, lead him on by the beauty of her dazzling fair face and the
  glances of her deep blue eyes. Let her flirt with him, and then throw him
  over with a light laugh as very likely, she would have done me. A fig for all
  women! An ounce of philosophy would weigh them all down in the scales of
  reason. But at twenty-four that ounce is hard to get!</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-29"
     id="ch-29"></a>XXIX. &mdash; I AM TEMPTED</h2>

  <p class="first">Early on the following morning I mounted for the last time
  into the high dog-cart, which had been kept in the coach-house at the
  "cottage" for my use, and was driven rapidly away with my back to Devereux
  Court. It was a grey, misty morning, and a watery sun was shining feebly down
  from a cloud-strewn sky. It had been raining, and innumerable glistening
  drops of moisture were hanging and falling from the well-nigh leafless trees.
  A desolate morning; with a slight vapory mist rising from the ground and
  chilling the air. But my thoughts were not of the weather, for I was taking
  my last lingering farewell of Devereux Court. As we turned the corner and
  lost sight of it for awhile, a stronger ray of sunlight than any which had as
  yet succeeded in piercing the bank of clouds reached its windows, and
  transformed its whole appearance. A thousand rays of light seemed to be
  smiling down at me from the massive stretching front and the frowning towers,
  all the brighter from the contrast with the black woods above and around. I
  was young and impressionable to anything in nature, especially with my heart
  so full as it was then, and, with a sudden start, I rose up and waved my hat
  in an answering farewell. Then I sat down and would not look round again lest
  the light should have died out from the diamond-framed windows, and the gloom
  from the threatening clouds reign there instead. I was superstitious,
  perhaps&mdash;but I wanted to carry away with me in my heart the memory of
  Devereux Court, as I had seen it a moment ago, with its dark grey front
  softened and its windows sparkling gaily in that chance flickering ray of
  sunlight. And so I would not look round, even when John slackened at the top
  of the last hill, and, pointing with his whip, reckoned that "this wur the
  last I should see of t'ould place. And rare sorry he wur too," he added, with
  grateful recollections of a piece of gold at that moment reposing snugly in
  his waistcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>But I would not look, and, a little offended, he touched the old hunter
  with his whip, and before long we reached the station of Devereux.</p>

  <p>In six hours I was in London, friendless, and I had well-nigh said
  purposeless, for, after I had written out and myself taken to the office of
  the "Times" a brief but imploring message to my father, I knew not which way
  to turn or what to do with myself. London disgusted, sickened me, and at
  every step I took I felt myself longing the more for a strong fresh breeze
  from a Yorkshire moor, and for the sight of a country lane and a few
  ruddy-cheeked, good-natured country folk, instead of this never-ceasing
  stream of pale-faced, anxious men and over-dressed artificial women, and this
  interminable succession of great dirty buildings. I felt awkward, too, and
  ill at ease, for though in the country there had never seemed to be anything
  extraordinary in my stature, here, as I walked down the Strand with my hands
  behind my back, I seemed head and shoulders above everybody else, and people
  looked up at me wonderingly and made laughing remarks to one another, some of
  which I could not help but overhear. At last, in despair, it occurred to me
  that my country costume had some thing to do with it; so I went to a tailor
  in Bond-street, and, with a sigh, abandoned my loose shooting jacket and
  breeches and brown deer-stalker for a black frock coat, dark grey trousers,
  and tall hat. The change was an effectual one, however, for though people
  still stared at me, it was no longer as though I were some wild animal.</p>

  <p>One afternoon during the second week of my stay in London I turned with a
  crowd of other loungers into the Park, and there, to my surprise, I saw Maud.
  She was sitting in a victoria by herself', leaning back amongst the cushions
  with pale face and a light in her cold blue eyes which seemed to speak of
  indifference to everything and everybody around her. As fate would have it,
  there was a block just then, and her carriage, with its pair of restless,
  fuming bays, came almost to a standstill close to where I was leaning over
  the railing. I would have drawn back, but I could not, I seemed fascinated,
  and I remained there with my eyes fixed upon hers, and from that moment I was
  a believer in animal magnetism, for suddenly she looked languidly up, and her
  eyes rested deliberately upon the little crowd of black-coated loungers of
  whom I was one. She saw me, she singled me out from the rest in a moment, and
  instantly the proud, bored look left her face, and she leaned forward in her
  carriage towards me with her lips parted in a slight smile. I obeyed her
  imperious little gesture, and, stepping over the railings, stood by her side
  hat in hand.</p>

  <p>She laid an exquisitely gloved little hand in mine for a moment, and then
  leaned back, looking at me with the old look, half mocking, half tender,
  altogether bewildering.</p>

  <p>"Saul amongst the prophets!" she laughed. "Since when, might I ask, has
  Mr. Arbuthnot become an acclimatised Londoner? Really you ought to feel
  flattered that I recognised you," she added, looking at my black coat and hat
  and the gardenia in my buttonhole.</p>

  <p>"I am only waiting in London until I have news from abroad," I answered.
  "When did you come from Devereux?"</p>

  <p>"Only yesterday. And I had not thought to see you so soon," she said, in
  an altered tone.</p>

  <p>Why was I standing there at Maud's feet? Why had I come into the Park at
  all? I, who was so little of a man that, amidst all this great crowd of
  people I was obliged to struggle hard to keep an unmoved countenance and a
  measured tone. I felt bitterly angry with myself as I answered, with averted
  face&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Nor I you. I had forgotten that Devereux was not your home. You live
  here, do you not?"</p>

  <p>"We are generally here for the season," she said. "We have a house in
  Mayfair. Will you come and see me?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, no, Miss Devereux."</p>

  <p>"You are a Don Quixote, Hugh," she said, half angrily, half reproachfully.
  "How can you be so foolish as to believe that rubbish about my father! Wait
  till you hear how people talk of him, and then you will know how stupidly
  mistaken you have been. And he likes you so much, too. You might come and see
  us whenever you liked, if you would only not be so silly."</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Miss Devereux?"</p>

  <p>She turned round I quickly, and saw Lord Annerley, who had ridden up on
  the other side of the carriage.</p>

  <p>"Lord Annerley! Really, how very surprising! I thought that you had gone
  off to break the bank at Monaco. Francis said so."</p>

  <p>"I had meant to go," he began, twirling his little waxen moustache with
  his small hand, of which he seemed inordinately proud; "but something kept me
  in London."</p>

  <p>"You have not answered me, Mr. Arbuthnot. Is it to be no or yes?"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, Miss Devereux, that I have nothing to add to my previous
  answer," I said, stiffly, for her beautiful smiling face seemed to me like
  the face of a temptress just then.</p>

  <p>"Just as you wish, of course," she answered coldly, with a slight haughty
  inclination of her head. "And now, Lord Annerley," I heard her add, in a very
  altered tone, "I hear that you have a new team. Do tell me all about them.
  Are they greys or mixed?"</p>

  <p>I walked away, nor did I enter the Park again whilst I was in London.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-30"
     id="ch-30"></a>XXX. &mdash; LIAR AND COWARD</h2>

  <p class="first">"It's the book of the day."</p>

  <p>"It's decidedly the cleverest thing of its sort I ever read."</p>

  <p>"Have you read the review in the 'Athenaeum'?"</p>

  <p>"And in the 'Saturday Review.'"</p>

  <p>"They all praise it, even the 'Spectator.'"</p>

  <p>"Who's the author? Whose initials are R. D.?"</p>

  <p>"Why, don't you know? It's Major Rupert Devereux, the man who wrote that
  awfully clever article in the 'Fortnightly' last month. He's an M.P., and a
  great man on committees. Sort of practical philanthropist."</p>

  <p>I was standing in front of a bookshop leading out of the Strand amongst a
  little group of other passers-by, who had halted for a moment to turn over
  the volumes which were out on view, and this was the conversation which I
  beard being carried on almost at my elbow. I listened eagerly for more, but
  the speakers had passed on.</p>

  <p>My Uncle Rupert was a great man, then, I thought, bitterly. Curse him! I
  was scarcely surprised, for there was in his pale face all the nervous force
  of imaginative intellect. What was it he had written, I wondered? I took up
  the "Times," and glanced through its columns. Ah, there it was&mdash;a review
  two columns long&mdash;"Richard Strathdale, novelist," by R. D.?</p>

  <p>I glanced through the review; it was one long eulogy. A profound
  metaphysical romance! The most brilliant work of fiction of the age, and so
  on, and so on. I stopped at a bookseller's, and asked for "Richard
  Strathdale." They were sold out. I tried another with the same
  result&mdash;there had been a tremendous run on it, they told me. But at
  last, at a railway bookstall, I was just in time to purchase their last copy,
  and hurried back with it to my hotel.</p>

  <p>I commenced to read, and I read on deeply interested. There was much that
  I could not understand, much that betrayed an intimate knowledge with schools
  of philosophic thought the names of which even were unknown to me. But there
  was a great deal which, despite my prejudice against the writer, seemed to me
  almost sublime. It was written from a noble, almost an idyllic standpoint.
  There were no carping pessimisms in it, no Nineteenth Century
  disputativeness. It seemed to be the work of a man who believed in all that
  was pure and lofty in nature and in human nature. The spirit of a good,
  high-minded man seemed to be breathing through it in every line. I laid it
  down when I was half-way through with a startled little gasp. Could this be
  my Uncle Rupert! this the man whose life was a living lie! Never had my faith
  in my father wavered for one moment, but just then, every thing seemed chaos.
  I read on until I came to a passage where the hero of the story was speaking
  of another man:</p>

  <p>"An unhappy man! Of course he is an unhappy man! He always will be! Go and
  ask him what it is he desires. He will tell you a larger fortune, or a
  peerage, or something of that sort. He is a fool&mdash;a blind fool&mdash;not
  to have realised by this time that desires expand with possessions, and the
  more the one increases the more ravenous the other becomes. Bah! the
  principle is as simple as A B C. 'Tis the moralists of the earth, be they
  Christians or Chinese, who win here! Logic and philosophy may knock
  Christianity into a cocked hat. But Christianity can make a man happy, which
  is exactly what philosophy won't do. Happiness is internal, not external. It
  must sit in the heart, and not float in the senses. And what gratification is
  there which a man can get out of the good things of the world which can
  strike deeper than the senses? Happiness is a consciousness; it is the
  consciousness of goodness. Dreadfully commonplace talk this, but
  commonplacisms are often truisms!"</p>

  <p>I closed the book, and walked up and down the room restlessly. A great
  bewilderment seemed to be closing in upon me. My faith in my father was never
  really shaken, and yet this book seemed to me to ring with evidences that it
  was written by a high-minded, naturally good man. All my ideas were
  disarranged. A great wave of wondering doubt seemed beating against the
  prejudice which had grown up in my heart against my Uncle Rupert. At last I
  could bear it no longer. With the book still in my hand I hurried out into
  the street. Within ten minutes I stood before Rupert Devereux's house in
  Mayfair, and almost immediately was ushered by the servant into his
  study.</p>

  <p>He was bending close over his writing-desk with his back to me, writing
  fast, and sheets of foolscap lay on the floor all around him. He had not
  heard me announced, and he wrote on without looking up.</p>

  <p>I stepped into the middle of the room and spoke to him:</p>

  <p>"Rupert Devereux," I cried, "it is I, Herbert Devereux's son. Turn round,
  for I have something to say to you."</p>

  <p>He started to his feet, and turned an eager face toward me. Then he
  advanced a step or two, half holding out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, you have come to accept my offer. God grant that you have."</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "I have come to ask a question of the man who wrote this
  book," I answered, holding it out. "I have come to ask the man who writes
  that happiness is the abstract product of a consciousness of right doing,
  whether he is happy? Rupert Devereux, you know what happiness is. Tell me are
  you happy?"</p>

  <p>He sank into a chair and covered his face with his bands. My heart grew
  lighter as I looked upon him.</p>

  <p>"They tell me that you are a successful man," I continued, mercilessly.
  "You are a member of Parliament, and a noted one. You are spoken of as a
  philanthropist, and a zealous one. You have written a book which any man
  might be proud of having written. You are rich, you are well spoken of every
  where. And you are a miserable man."</p>

  <p>"Out of your own mouth you stand convicted," I cried, stretching out the
  book to wards him. "You are not happy because none of these things can bring
  you happiness. You are not happy because you have not that consciousness of
  right doing in your heart. You are miserable because you have wrecked
  another's life that you might gain his wealth. Fool! Villain!"</p>

  <p>Still he did not answer; only he stretched out his hand as though to
  implore my silence.</p>

  <p>"Rupert Devereux," I cried, passionately "It is not too late to make
  amends even now. Confess that lie which you uttered so many years ago, and
  you will be a happier man than you are how! You know it! The man who wrote
  this book knows it. I will forgive you, my father shall forgive you
  everything if you will lift this weight from him which is dragging him down
  to death. You will lose your name, your wealth, your position. But you will
  gain something which none of these can give you. Rupert Devereux, as there is
  a God above us, I charge you to speak the truth this night!"</p>

  <p>Ghastly pale, with the wild agony of his remorse written into his face, he
  tottered rather than rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I admit nothing, I deny nothing," he faltered out in a broken voice. "But
  supposing circumstances were as you imagine them to be, I have gone too far
  to retract. There are my children!"</p>

  <p>"What of them?" I cried. "This is not a censorious generation, and none
  would visit on them their father's sin. Francis is one whom money would make
  happy, and he should have it! Maud, I love Maud, and would make her my
  wife."</p>

  <p>He looked up amazed, and then an eager hope flashed out from his sunken
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"You love Maud!" he repeated. "Then marry her, Hugh; marry her, and I will
  dower her with every penny I have, and go and live anywhere. Only let this
  other matter drop between us. If I have sinned in a mad impulse of folly, I
  have sinned. What is done cannot be recalled! The best years of Herbert's
  life have gone, and by this time he will have become resigned. Let me call
  Maud, or go to her. She is in her room."</p>

  <p>I stretched out my hand, but with a great effort: withdrew it. What should
  I gain by striking this man? I made one last appeal to him.</p>

  <p>"There is but one thing I want from you," I cried, "and nothing else will
  I have. All that I want to know is whether you will go down to hell with this
  lie upon your soul, or whether you will do that which alone can bring you any
  peace of mind. Answer!"</p>

  <p>"I have answered, Hugh," he said, sadly. "What you ask of me I, cannot, I
  will not do. If you will accept nothing else&mdash;I am sorry."</p>

  <p>"Then curse you for a coward!" I cried, springing up. "A liar and a
  coward! Live on your false life, fair before men, but black and corrupt
  within; live it on! But see whether their praises, their admiration, or your
  success will ever lift for one moment from your heart my curse!"</p>

  <p>Then I left him, mad and white with anger, and rushed out into the busy
  streets.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Wearily the days dragged on for me, bringing me no news from
  abroad, no answer to the passionate entreaty which every morning appeared in
  the agony column of the "Times." I grew disheartened and dispirited, feeling
  every day more bitter against my kinsman, whose name seemed to be in
  everyone's mouth, and every day a keener longing to stand face to face with
  my father, and feel his hand clasped in mine. Fool that I had been to let him
  wander off alone, bearing in his heart that dead weight of misery! What if he
  were dead&mdash;had fallen in the petty quarrels of some fourth-rate
  Principality! Had there been war anywhere I should have known where to look
  for him; but Europe was at peace, and I knew not in which country of the
  globe to commence my search.</p>

  <p>One evening I had taken up a society journal, and as usual Rupert
  Devereux's name headed one of the paragraphs. He was giving a fancy dress
  ball to-night, at which Royalty was expected to be present. I threw the paper
  from me in disgust, and a wild storm of anger laid hold of me. Rupert
  Devereux, a great man, a leader of society, everywhere quoted as brilliant,
  talented, and withal kind-hearted; whilst my father, his victim, wandered
  about in miserable exile, holding his life in his hand! It was the thought
  that was with me day and night, but that moment it gained such a hold on me
  as to cry out for action of some sort. But what could I do? All idea of
  physical punishment which naturally leaped first into my mind revolted me,
  for he was a weak man, and would have been like a lath in my hands. And what
  other means had I? Denunciation would make me ridiculous without injuring
  him; for, when a man stands firm in the world's esteem, they are slow to
  believe ill of him. I caught up the paper again, and a sudden idea flashed
  into my mind which I first scouted as ridiculous, then reconsidered, and
  finally embraced. I called a hansom, and drove to several costumiers. At last
  I found what wanted, and returned to the hotel to dress, for I was going to
  Major Rupert Devereux's fancy dress ball.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A suite of reception rooms, decorated like the rooms of a
  palace, and the strains of the Hungarian band floating softly on an air heavy
  with the rich perfume of banks of rare exotics. Distinguished-looking men and
  beautiful women, in the picturesque garb of all ages and nations, gliding
  over the smooth floor. Powdered footmen noiselessly passing backwards and
  forwards over the thick carpets of a succession of satin-draped anterooms.
  Flowers, light, music, and perfume; fair faces and soft words. That night
  seems like a confused dream of all these to me, save for one brief minute.
  One brief minute, when the giver of all these, the flattered recipient of
  endless compliments from noble lips, came face to face with the image of the
  man on whoso misery all these things were built up, came face to face with
  him, in the very uniform, and with the same fiercely reproachful gaze, which
  he had worn more than twenty years ago.</p>

  <p>"It was the heat&mdash;the excitement&mdash;the overwork!" his
  sympathising guests declared, as their host was carried from their midst in a
  dead faint, with his face like the face of a corpse. But I knew better, and I
  laughed as I strode into my room at the hotel, and flung myself into an easy
  chair. Something on the mantelpiece attracted my attention, and I sprang up
  with a quick cry, and caught hold of a thin, foreign envelope. I tore it open
  with trembling fingers, and read:&mdash;"My dear son. Come to me at Palermo,
  if you will&mdash;Yours affectionately, H. D.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It had come at last, then! Thank God! Thank God!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-31"
     id="ch-31"></a>XXXI. &mdash; MY FATHER AND I</h2>

  <p class="first">"My father! my father!"</p>

  <p>We stood on the slope of a wild heath-covered hill, alone, with no human
  being or sign of habitation in sight. Before us towered a dreary, lofty range
  of bare mountains&mdash;on one side was a fearful precipice, and below us on
  the other the blue sea. We had met on the road, my father and I!</p>

  <p>With both hands clasping his, I looked into his face. Alas, how changed it
  was! Thin and shrunken, with hollow eyes and furrowed brow, he looked to me
  what he was, a wreck.</p>

  <p>"You have been ill," I cried, with a lump in my throat and the tears
  springing into my eyes; "Where have you been? Why did you not send for
  me?"</p>

  <p>He pointed to a loose piece of rock a few yards off.</p>

  <p>"Let us sit down, and I will tell you everything," he said, wearily. "I am
  tired."</p>

  <p>We sat down, and I waited eagerly for him to begin. There was a patch of
  brilliantly colored wild flowers at our feet which filled the air all round
  with a dreamy, intoxicating odor. It was a perfume which has lingered with me
  even to this day.</p>

  <p>"Ay, I have been ill," he began slowly, "almost to death, but death would
  have none of me. I have little, very little, to tell you, Hugh, my boy. Since
  we parted in England I have wandered about in many countries seeking to find
  an honorable manner of disposing of my life, but in vain. The dead calm of
  peace which seems to rest all over Europe can be but the hush before a storm,
  but the storm is long in coming&mdash;long in coming.</p>

  <p>"I have done nothing save wander about," he added, after a moment's pause,
  "after the fashion of a tramp, carrying my luggage with me, and calling no
  place home. A few miles from here, about two months ago, I thought that, my
  release had come. I swooned suddenly in a lonely part of yonder range of
  mountains, and when I came to I was still lying on the track, but a fever had
  laid hold of me, and I thought then that surely I must die. I became
  unconscious again, and when I recovered my senses for the second time I was
  no longer lying on the ground, but was in a rude sort of a tent, lying on a
  bed of dried leaves and heath. Ono of the roughest looking men I ever saw,
  dirty, but gaudily dressed, with a brace of pistols stuck in his belt, was
  sitting by my side, and through the opening of the tent I could see more like
  him moving backwards and forwards, and shouting to one another in some
  villainous patois. For a long time I couldn't imagine into whose hands I had
  fallen, but they were very kind to me, and brought me plenty of everything
  they could get&mdash;grapes, and olives, and wild aloes, and wine. At last
  one of them, who seemed to be their chief, and who spoke French, came in to
  talk with me. Then I knew that these men who had taken such care of me were
  really bandits, brigands. They had taken nothing of mine, and would accept
  nothing in return for their kindness. They rob the rich only, the chief
  assured me. I daresay you'll be surprised to hear, Hugh, that when I began to
  get stronger and able to get about, I felt quite loth to leave the place. I
  felt that there I was, at any rate, right out of the world, and secure from
  any casual questioning. And the spot where they have fixed their abode is the
  most lovely I ever looked upon. So I had a talk with their chief one
  day&mdash;Jose his name is&mdash;and it was arranged that I should pay a
  small sum to them for the use of the tent, and for supplies of fruit and
  olives and wine which the peasants bring them in abundance; and, in short,
  that I should live with them, though not be of them. I have felt at rest
  there, though at times the weariness of complete inaction is hard to bear.
  Only a few days ago I travelled into Palermo for the first time. There I
  bought the 'Times,' and saw your advertisement, and answered it, and the rest
  you know. I sent Jose's son, a quick little fellow he is, into the town to
  hunt you out, and bring you here. God bless you for coming, Hugh. It has done
  me good to see you again."</p>

  <p>He ceased, and my heart was very heavy. Through every word he uttered, and
  in his whole appearance, I could trace how thoroughly he had renounced all
  idea of again mixing with the world, and yet what could his present state of
  existence be but a state of living death?</p>

  <p>"And now for my story, father," I said, as lightly as I could. "First,
  Marian is married."</p>

  <p>"Marian married!" He repeated the words slowly, with a sort of passive
  wonderment in his tones.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Marian is married to a clergyman, and a very good fellow, and I,
  father&mdash;I have been in a situation."</p>

  <p>He frowned, and repeated the words slowly to himself, as though displeased
  with it.</p>

  <p>"A situation? What sort of a one?"</p>

  <p>"I have had the management of a large estate. It was pleasant work."</p>

  <p>"Whereabouts?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Father," I said, holding his arm, "I held it as Mr. Arbuthnot, of course,
  at Devereux."</p>

  <p>He sprang up like a galvanised figure, and looked down at me in eager
  amazement.</p>

  <p>"At Devereux! 'At Devereux! Oh, my God, at Devereux!"</p>

  <p>He sat down again, and covered his face with his hands. Thinking it best
  to leave him alone, I remained silent for a while. Suddenly he turned
  round.</p>

  <p>"How does the old place look, Hugh? Tell me all about it. And
  my&mdash;my&mdash;Sir Francis. Did you see him? Is he well?"</p>

  <p>There was such a lingering pathos in his eager questions, that, with an
  aching heart, I turned away and wept. Then, after a while, I told him
  everything. Told him of my recognition, of my grandfather's offer, of
  Hilton's confession, and of my appeal to Rupert Devereux. He listened as
  though every word were sinking into his heart&mdash;listened with an utter
  absorption which was almost painful to witness. I told him of everything save
  of Maud.</p>

  <p>There was a long silence when I had finished. Then he said
  quietly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You have done wrong, Hugh. You should have accepted your grandfather's
  offer. You must go back to England, and go to him."</p>

  <p>"Father," I answered, "an oath is a sacred thing, and I have sworn before
  God that I will not do this thing. Whilst your name is Arbuthnot mine will be
  Arbuthnot. The name of Devereux may die out for all I care! Those who bear
  the name now are not worthy of it&mdash;an obstinate old man, blinded by his
  military notions and his cursed family pride, and a man who has lived upon a
  villainous lie, which he refuses to own to! They may rot before I will go
  near them again, or take their cursed name. You are the only Devereux,
  father, whom I love and respect, and with you I will stop. I swear it."</p>

  <p>His hands were locked in mine, and a wonderful change had softened his
  face. But by degrees the light seemed to die out of it, and he shook' his
  head anxiously.</p>

  <p>"You don't know what you are saying, Hugh. What, you, a young, man, with
  your life all before you, bury yourself with a hermit! Ah, no, it must not
  be. You must retract that oath, and go back to England. I wish it; nay, I
  command it!"</p>

  <p>There is no need to reproduce the arguments he used, or my stubborn
  opposition. We talked till the sun sank down, tingeing the glass-like sea
  into which it sank and the clouds in the western horizon with glowing tints
  of orange and purple and gold. And when the last word had been spoken it was
  I who was unshaken in my resolve, and he who was yielding. For we had agreed
  that for a time, at any rate, we would live together.</p>

  <p>The shades of evening had fallen with a suddenness which to me seemed
  strange, but to which my father was accustomed.</p>

  <p>"We must part for to-night, at any rate, Hugh," he exclaimed, rising. "It
  will be dark in half an hour. I must call young Pietro to guide you back to
  the town, unless," he added, hesitatingly, "you would care to come on and
  rough it with us for a night. I can only offer you a shake-down of dried
  leaves."</p>

  <p>"With you, by all means," I answered, quickly. "One could sleep out of
  doors in this country."</p>

  <p>"Come, then," he said, and, arm-in-arm, we struck over the heath,
  following no path, for the simple reason that there was none, but aiming for
  one of the heights of the range of hills before us, and skirting, at a
  respectable distance, the cleft-like precipice which stretched yawning by our
  side.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-32"
     id="ch-32"></a>XXXII. &mdash; THE BRIGANDS' HOME</h2>

  <p class="first">It was a strange, wild, magnificent spot. A deep gorge
  running inland from the sea, only avoided cutting into the precipice which we
  were carefully avoiding by a strip of turf, a few yards wide, along which we
  passed, and by which alone access could he obtained to our destination. It
  curled in a zig-zag position, sometimes wider, sometimes narrower, towards a
  low promontory fronting the sea for the gorge seemed to take a complete
  circle. As we neared this hill I could see that it was a far more fertile one
  than most of the country around. Up one side stretched a vineyard, and little
  knolls of olive and cypress trees were dotted about on the summit, which
  seemed enclosed by a thick hedge of wild aloes. A keen, piercing whistle
  greeted our approach, to which my father at once replied.</p>

  <p>Then there was silence.</p>

  <p>We climbed right up the side and passed over the summit of the hill
  without seeing a sign of any human being or habitation. I looked at my father
  inquiringly, but he only smiled.</p>

  <p>"Follow me carefully, Hugh," he said, walking on as though to descend the
  promontory on the other side. I did so, along a winding, narrow, path covered
  with loose stones, until suddenly, as we reached a sharp corner, I came to a
  standstill, and could not repress a cry of admiration. Just below was a wide,
  natural plateau jutting out until it seemed to stand sheer over the violet
  sea, and around it at regular distances, close to the side of the hill, and
  overhung by a luxurious outgrowing plantation of cypress trees, were a number
  of rudely constructed brown tents. Lying about on the turf were several men
  dressed in a picturesque medley of bright-hued garments, smoking long
  cigarettes and drinking wine from horn cups. It reminded me of a scene from
  the "Spanish Student," only it was far more beautiful.</p>

  <p>A tall, dark man of swarthy complexion and black eyes, but who was far
  from ill-looking, came forward languidly to meet us. My father spoke to him
  rapidly apart for a moment or two, and then he turned towards me.</p>

  <p>"This is Monsieur Jose, Hugh, whose guest I am."</p>

  <p>Monsieur Jose took off his feathered hat, and made me a sweeping bow.</p>

  <p>"The son of my friend, the Englishman, is very welcome," he said, speaking
  in French. "You would wish to rest, no doubt? If monsieur will seek his tent,
  I will order refreshments to be sent."</p>

  <p>We entered one of the curiously-shaped habitations, and I glanced
  wonderingly around. There was a small chest, a gun, a little pile of books, a
  bed of dried leaves and heath pressed together in a compact form, which gave
  forth an aromatic, agreeable smell, and very little else.</p>

  <p>"Not much furniture, you see," my father remarked. "Now come outside
  again."</p>

  <p>A white cloth had been spread out on the turf, and wooden dishes of
  olives, aloes, magnificent grapes, and some sort of dried meat had been
  arranged on it. Two long-necked bottles of wine and a couple of horn mugs
  were also brought, and then the man who had been making these preparations
  bowed clumsily and withdrew.</p>

  <p>I flung myself on the turf by my father's side, and, for the first time
  for many years, we ate and drank together. Afterwards we lit long paper
  cigarettes, of which there seemed to be no lack, and I stretched myself out
  with a sense of dreamy satisfaction. The warm, balmy air, heavily laden with
  the exquisite perfume of wild flowers and the odorous scent of the vineyard,
  seemed to lull my senses into a sweet, satisfied stupor, and for hours we
  both lay there, scarcely exchanging half a dozen sentences.</p>

  <p>"Father," I said, suddenly, "a man might be happy here."</p>

  <p>He sighed. "It would not be impossible," he assented.</p>

  <p>I thought of London at night, with its endless whirl of excitement and
  hurry; its flaming gaslights, its heated theatres, its hurrying, eager
  crowds, and its hideous vice, and I drew a deep, satisfied breath.</p>

  <p>"One is happiest out of the world, I think, after all. How could any man
  be miserable in a place like this?"</p>

  <p>My father smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>"A certain amount of philosophy is necessary to appreciate solitude," he
  said. "You are too young to have imbibed it. You would be longing to be back
  in the world again before long."</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"Not I. There is nothing in England to compare with this. As for London,
  the little time I spent there seems like a bad dream. To live in a great city
  seems to me the greatest mistake a man can make. All the town people I met
  were artificial in their manners, and in their nature too, I believe. The
  struggle for existence seems to stunt them, and to check their
  development."</p>

  <p>"Yet contact with one another sharpens their wits and energy," my father
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"I doubt whether it improves them morally," I answered. "But perhaps I am
  prejudiced. I hate towns, and I love the country."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur is very wise."</p>

  <p>I turned my head, and saw Monsieur Jose's tall figure standing out against
  the sky.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur is very wise," he repeated. "I, too, have lived in towns, but I
  love best the country, else I should not be here. Monsieur is young to have
  attained to so much wisdom."</p>

  <p>I laughed. "Isn't it a matter of taste rather than a matter of wisdom?" I
  remarked.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders, and leaned for ward on the long gun which he
  was carrying. "With monsieur's permission," he said, "I will tell him a short
  story. It is my own."</p>

  <p>"Delighted," I murmured, lighting a fresh cigarette, and my father gravely
  bowed his head.</p>

  <p>"I was born and brought up in the country," Monsieur Jose commenced, "in a
  small village, about fifty miles south of Paris. When I was sixteen years old
  my father and mother both died, and I was left alone in the world, in
  possession of a small farm. I had to work hard, but I loved the place, and I
  was able to make a good living. I was happy enough, too, until Marie Marteuil
  came to live in our village, and I fell in love with her. I trust Monsieur
  will never know what it is to be in love with a heartless coquette! It was my
  lot, and a miserable lot it was! One day she would single me out from all the
  rest and talk to me only, and at another she would scarcely speak to me at
  all. It was Paris which had done it. Before she went up there to stay with an
  aunt for a while, she was as quiet, and simple, and sweet as ever a maiden
  could be, but when she returned she was, as I say, a confirmed coquette. I
  bore patiently with all her vagaries, and put up with all her saucy speeches,
  for more than a year. Then, when I asked her to marry me, she laughed in my
  face. What, marry a little country farmer! Not she. She would marry no one,
  she said, who did not live in Paris, or who could not take her there. If I
  could do that she would have me.</p>

  <p>"Well, I sold the farm on which I was born, every field of which I loved,
  and with a light heart went up to Paris. They call Paris a gay city! I found
  it a cruel one! I had no idea how to set about making a living there, and
  gradually my little stock of money dwindled away until it was nearly all
  gone. But I would succeed, I swore, for was not Marie waiting for me? At
  last, in despair, I turned blacksmith; I worked night and day until my cheeks
  lost their color, and I began to stoop. But I got on very well, and at last I
  got a forge for myself and took a little house and furnished it. Then I went
  down to my old home, happy and exultant, to fetch Marie. I went to her house
  and saw her, but when I would have embraced her she drew back as though she
  had forgotten me. I was pained, but I thought that she was playing with me,
  and I commenced to tell her my story, and all that I had done, and how I had
  worked for her sake, and about the house I had furnished. And when I had told
  her everything, what do you think she did? She burst out laughing in my
  face.</p>

  <p>"'The idea of her marrying a blacksmith!' she exclaimed, tossing her
  pretty little head. 'It was ridiculous.' Besides, she had changed her mind
  about living in Paris. I had better get some one else to go and live with me
  in the house I had furnished; and when I commenced to plead to her, she shut
  the door in my face. Next week she was married to the man to whom I had sold
  my farm. Does Monsieur wonder that I, too, detest the cities, and love best
  the country?"</p>

  <p>I looked at him sympathisingly, for though he had told his story lightly,
  there was a deep vein of sadness underlying his assumed manner, and his dark
  eyes had a sorrowful look.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it was as well for you that you didn't marry her," I remarked.
  "She must have been a heartless coquette." He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"If our love came from our head, that would would be very good
  consolation. I wish messieurs a very good-night," he added, bowing. Then he
  turned somewhat abruptly upon his heel and walked away to his tent.</p>

  <p>One by one the men around us left the central group, and, curling
  themselves up in their cloaks, threw themselves down to sleep&mdash;some
  inside their tents, some on the threshold, and others where they had been
  sitting. The golden moon had risen high above the gleaming, sparkling surface
  of the still sea, and shone down upon the strange little scene with a full,
  soft light. I looked round at the slumbering forms of the brigands in the
  fantastic dress, and at the dark cypress trees which stood out in strange
  shapes against the clear, star-bespangled sky. I watched the fire-flies
  around the aloe hedge, until my eyes ached with following their erratic
  course. Then I thought of Maud&mdash;wondered whether she was at that moment
  waltzing with Lord Annerley in some heated London ballroom, wondered whether
  she ever thought of me, whether she knew that I loved her!</p>

  <p>And then I closed my eyes, and the sweet, intoxicating perfume which
  floated about on the heavy southern air lulled me to sleep.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-33"
     id="ch-33"></a>XXIII. &mdash; AT PALERMO</h2>

  <p class="first">For a whole week I shared my father's abode in company with
  this band of robbers, and then, finding me indomitable in my determination to
  remain with him, he made another proposition. Such a retreat and such company
  as we were amongst was all very well for him, an outcast from the world: but
  for me it was different. He did not like the thought of my dwelling amongst
  proscribed men; there was no necessity for it.</p>

  <p>At first I laughed at him. Monsieur Jose and I were the best of friends,
  and, though with the other men, I could not exchange even a casual remark,
  for their only language was a vile, unintelligible patois, they were all
  civil enough, and seemed disposed to be friendly. The wild, open life suited
  me exactly, especially in the mood in which I then was, and I had no wish to
  change it for any more luxurious method of living. But as my father seemed to
  have made up his mind upon the matter, I, of course, had little to say about
  it.</p>

  <p>We did not have much difficulty in finding a suitable abode. At the foot
  of the wild gorge which gives access to the mountains amongst which the
  convent of San Martino, and the Cathedral of Monreale lie hidden, we came
  across a tumble-down, half-ruined, grey villa, of which several of the rooms
  were fairly habitable. We took it from its owner, a neighboring farmer, for a
  sum which seemed to us ridiculously low. Then, from the little village of
  Bocca di Falco, we engaged, for wages little above their keep, a man and
  woman, and with the remainder of the old furniture which was in the place,
  and a very few additions from Palermo, we were fairly set up in
  housekeeping.</p>

  <p>I am quite sure that that period was not altogether an unhappy one for my
  father, and, for my part, I found it very far from such. The complete novelty
  of our surroundings and manner of life was full of interest to me, and it was
  with the keenest pleasure, too, that I watched the color come slowly back to
  my father's cheeks and his limbs regain their old elasticity and vigor. He
  could not conceal the change which my coming had brought into his life, and
  he did not attempt to. Many a time did I feel devoutly thankful that I had
  held to and carried out my purpose.</p>

  <p>Our life was simple enough, but pleasant. Some times we spent the whole
  day trying to shoot the only bird there is to shoot&mdash;a sort of wild
  duck; at others we took long walks, exploring the coast scenery, and
  frequently winding up by a visit to our robber friends. Antiquities or
  sight-seeing we neither of us cared much about, but we paid together more
  than one visit to the vast palatial Convent of San Martino and to the
  cathedral of Monreale. Other places of interest we avoided, for my father had
  lost none of his old dread of meeting any of his fellow-countrymen, although,
  as I more than once pointed out to him, the probabilities of their ever
  having heard his story were very far removed.</p>

  <p>Sometimes we rode on mules across the rich intervening plain into Palermo,
  and mingled with the little crowd of priests and soldiers in the cafe, and
  went down to the Casino to glance through the papers. It was I who read
  these, however, for my father carefully avoided them, and perhaps it was as
  well that he did, for more often than not there was some mention of Rupert
  Devereux's name, either presiding at a meeting or heading a subscription
  list, or as one of the committee interested in some great philanthropic work.
  It could not have been pleasant for him to have read such items of news as
  this, and I was thankful that he chose never to read English papers.</p>

  <p>And so our life passed on for more than a year, not at all unpleasantly
  for either of us. My father, in his previous state of complete solitude, had
  developed a taste for profound reading, and seemed to find much pleasure in
  studying abstruse works on Buddhism, the creed of the Mahometans, the
  Confucian teaching, the religion of the Brahmins and the Fetichists, and the
  strange, fascinating doctrine of quietism held by so many of the nations of
  the East. It was a taste which I never pretended to share, the only one of
  our joint interests in which the other did not participate. I feared it,
  although in my ignorance I could do nothing to check it. I had dim ideas that
  to a man circumstanced, as my father was, such study must develop any secret
  leanings towards fatalism, and it was a doctrine which he would have many
  excuses for embracing. But I was too ignorant to argue with him, so I
  contented myself with keeping him from his books always in the daytime and
  often in the evening; for we had improvised in one of the empty rooms a sort
  of billiard table, on which, I am convinced, we executed some of the most
  extra-ordinary strokes that a marker ever gazed upon. Then, too, we played
  chess often, and I tried, by every means in my power, to keep him from
  turning bookworm. And, on the whole. I was not dissatisfied with my
  success.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-34"
     id="ch-34"></a>XXXIV. &mdash; VISITORS FROM ROME</h2>

  <p class="first">It was one of those evenings which, to any one acquainted
  only with our English climate, seems like a foretaste of paradise. I sat
  before a tiny marble table at one of the open-air cafes at the head of the
  Marina, listening idly to the music of the band only a few yards off, and
  gazing over the peaceful, glistening sea which stretched away in front. There
  were many people passing backwards and forwards, but my thoughts were far
  away, and I took notice of none of them. With my head resting upon my arm,
  and my arm upon the low balustrade, I had fallen into a semi-somnolent
  slumber of thought, and the faces of the people who lounged by chattering and
  laughing I saw only as figures in a dream. My cigarette even had burnt out
  between my lips, and the coffee which stood by my side I had not tasted.</p>

  <p>The roadway was completely blocked with the carriages of the Palermitan
  nobility and elite, and the promenade was thronged with a heterogeneous
  stream of fishermen and natives and visitors. All Palermo flocks on to the
  Marina at nightfall&mdash;as who would not?&mdash;to hear the band and
  breathe in the freshness of the sea, and with other objects very similar to
  those which attract promenaders on to the esplanades of English
  watering-places at a similar hour. Often I had amused myself by watching
  them, and looked out for English visitors; but to-night, early in the
  evening, I had seen a Sicilian countess who reminded me slightly of Maud, and
  my thoughts had flashed back to Devereux, and remained there, heedless of my
  efforts to recall them, hovering around one fair face, which sometimes I
  feared was more to me than anything else in the world.</p>

  <p>What should recall them but the glad, amazed greeting of an English voice!
  I sprang to my feet, and before me, her face radiant with pleasure, and her
  little hand stretched out eagerly, stood Lady Olive.</p>

  <p>"Of all the strange meetings I ever heard of, Mr. Arbuthnot, this is the
  most extraordinary!" she exclaimed. "It quite takes my breath away!"</p>

  <p>I held her hand in mine, forgetful of what I was doing&mdash;amazed and
  admiring. A warm climate evidently suited Lady Olive, for I had never seen
  her look so charming as she did then in the airy muslin dress which floated
  gracefully around her slight figure, with a great bunch of light-colored
  violets in the bosom of her gown, and with a decided tinge of color and
  delighted sparkle in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot, am I a ghost that you look at me so without speaking? And
  you really must let go my hand, please."</p>

  <p>I dropped it at once.</p>

  <p>"Lady Olive," I exclaimed, "I never met any one whom I was so pleased to
  see! What ever stroke of good fortune brought you to Sicily?"</p>

  <p>"This," she laughed, laying her arm within that of a tall, bearded
  gentleman who stood wondering by her side. "Papa, this is Mr. Arbuthnot. Mr.
  Arbuthnot, my father, Lord Parkhurst."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand cordially.</p>

  <p>"Very glad to meet you, Mr. Arbuthnot. I have heard my daughter speak of
  you often." We were blocking up the crowded promenade, and so we all three
  turned and walked leisurely along amongst the others. In a few minutes I had
  heard that Lord Parkhurst had brought his daughter and some other friends
  here from Rome in his yacht, and they were uncertain as to their stay. And in
  return I had told them that I was living with my father for a while close to
  Palermo.</p>

  <p>Presently we came up with the remainder of their party, and Lord
  Parkhurst, leaving his daughter in my charge, joined them. A tall,
  good-humored-looking boy strolled, up to us, looking at me questioningly.
  Lady Olive introduced me to her brother, who came over to my side, and seemed
  disposed to stay with us.</p>

  <p>"Now, we're not going to have you, Frank," Lady Olive declared, laughing.
  "Mr. Arbuthnot and I are old friends, and we have a lot to talk about. Go and
  take care of Cissy, do!"</p>

  <p>He laughed good-humoredly, and then, nodding to me, strolled off with his
  hands hi his pockets. Lady Olive rested her little hand upon my arm for a
  moment, and guided me down towards the winter garden, where the throng was
  less dense. There we found a low seat, and sat down with our faces to the
  sea, and our backs to the ever-increasing crowd, the murmur of whose
  conversation reached us in an incessant subdued hum.</p>

  <p>"And now, Mr. Arbuthnot, tell me all the news, please; I want to know
  everything about yourself," exclaimed Lady Olive, making herself comfortable.
  "Quick, please; we haven't more than half an hour before someone will be
  looking for me."</p>

  <p>"Half a minute will suffice to tell you my news," I answered, and I told
  her the little that had happened to me since Marian's marriage. I told her of
  my meeting with my father, and of our quiet life together. She listened with
  more than interest; and very enchanting she looked in the golden light which
  shone upon her upturned, piquant face, and in her dark, tender eyes, which
  had almost filled with compassionate tears when I had finished. For, after
  all, there was something sad about my story.</p>

  <p>"I think it is so good of you, Mr&mdash;Mr. Arbuthnot, to give up your
  life, as you are doing, to your father," she said, softly.</p>

  <p>I laughed at the idea.</p>

  <p>"Give it up! It is no sacrifice. I like being with him; and life isn't at
  all unpleasant out here, I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it a little dull?" she asked, hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"I had not found, it so," I told her; "Perhaps I should when she were
  gone," I added. She made a mocking face at me, and then suddenly became grave
  again.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot, I wonder whether you will mind," she said, looking at me
  very earnestly, "but papa knows your real name and all about you. I couldn't
  help telling him, because I have thought about you so much. You are not
  angry?"</p>

  <p>I smiled down at her reassuringly. Angry! Why should I be? Instead, I must
  confess that I felt a decided glow of pleasure at her eager words.</p>

  <p>"Tell me something about yourself now," I begged, "and some English news,
  if there is any."</p>

  <p>"English news! Well, old Sir Francis is moping worse than ever since you
  left; Mr. Rupert Devereux has written the hovel of the season; Mr. Francis,
  from all I can hear of him, is going to the bad; and Maud&mdash;they say Maud
  is engaged to that little fop, Lord Annerley. Is that enough news?"</p>

  <p>Yes, it was quite enough! Something told me that she was watching for the
  effect of her words, and a sort of stubborn pride held my features rigid, and
  enabled me to answer lightly, and to put the words which I had heard away
  from me.</p>

  <p>We talked for a long time in low tones, exchanging reminiscences and
  speeches, my share of which I have often since repented. But to meet
  unexpectedly a countrywoman, especially so charming a one as Lady Olive, in a
  strange country, when you have seen nothing but strange faces for many
  months, is sufficient excuse for a little more than cordiality creeping into
  the conversation. And then there was the influence of the scene and of the
  night, an influence which no one can properly appreciate who does not know
  what the long summer nights of Southern Europe are like. Everything seemed
  steeped in a sort of languid, evanescent beauty. The dark mountains,
  stretching out like giant sentinels into the silvery, glistening bay, the
  twinkling lights from the low, white-houses, the softened strains of the
  band, the musky air heavily laden with the mingled perfume of the orange
  grove, the hyacinths, and the more distant vineyards, and Lady Olive's
  beautiful dark eyes so close to mine, and flashing with such a dangerously
  sweet light&mdash;all these seemed leagued together to stir my senses and my
  heart. If Lady Olive spoke in a lower tone and with a tenderer accent than
  she need have done, was I to blame, knowing her to be a flirt, if I followed
  suit? The wonder is that I forebore to answer the mute invitation of her
  eyes, and press my lips against the archly tender, oval face, which more than
  once almost touched mine. But for the thought that, gone from me for ever
  though she might be, Maud's kiss was the last upon my lips, assuredly I
  should have yielded to the fascination of that moment.</p>

  <p>Fewer and fewer became our words, until at last we ceased talking
  altogether, and remained silent, drinking in the exquisite enjoyment of our
  surroundings.</p>

  <p>At last Lady Olive rose reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot, we must really go. They'll be coming to look for us
  directly, and, really, if it hadn't been too ridiculous, people might almost
  imagine that we'd been spooning mightn't they?"</p>

  <p>She blushed as she smoothed clown the folds of her white dress, and waited
  whilst I lit a cigarette. Certainly, if people had entertained that very
  ridiculous notion there would have been some excuse for them, for our hands
  had been very close together&mdash;very close indeed&mdash;and there was a
  soft light in Lady Olive's lustrous eyes, which, to any one who had not known
  that she was a flirt, and could command them at will, might have suggested
  love-making. Our <i>tjte-`-tjte</i>, such a it was, was over for the present,
  at any rate for we had scarcely gone a dozen yards when we came upon Lord
  Parkhurst, with Miss Cissy, who, I found out afterwards, was Lady Olive's
  youngest sister, and Master Frank, and a tall, sandy-haired man, with bushy
  eyebrows and an intelligent forehead, whom Lord Parkhurst introduced to me as
  Mr. Burton Leigh.</p>

  <p>We all walked up the promenade together but presently Lord Parkhurst took
  an opportunity to draw me a little behind the others.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he said kindly, "my daughter told me all your sad
  history when she came to me from England. Do you know, I should like to know
  your father, Mr. Devereux, very much. My cousin was in his regiment, and
  always swore that there was something wrong about that court-martial. Do you
  think that he would mind my calling on him?"</p>

  <p>I hesitated, at a loss how to decide.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, let it be until you have asked him," Lord Parkhurst went on
  good-humoredly. "We shall be here for a week or two at any rate, and I hope
  that we shall see a good deal of you. We thought of going to see the convent
  at San Martino to-morrow. Will you join us?"</p>

  <p>"The convent of San Martino?" I exclaimed. "Why you will pass our
  house."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!' Then we will look in and see your father on our way back, if he
  has no objection. You'll come in for an hour?"</p>

  <p>We had reached the entrance to the hotel and Lady Olive was looking behind
  to see that I was following. But I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"I have a six-mile ride over a rough country," I said, "and though the
  patience of mules is supposed to be inexhaustible, experience has taught me
  that that idea is a popular delusion. I've kept mine waiting four hours
  already, and I really must go."</p>

  <p>"If you must, then," Lord Parkhurst said, holding out his hand, "where
  shall we see you to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"I'll come and meet you if you'll tell me what time you'll start."</p>

  <p>They consulted, and fixed upon an hour. Then I shook hands with Lady Olive
  and the rest of the party, and walked back along the now nearly deserted
  Marina to the inn where I had left my mule.</p>

  <p>Jacko was a faithful beast and sure of foot. But he was slow, and by the
  time we had reached home it was past midnight. My father was sitting up for
  me, poring over a musty old volume, which he laid down as I entered.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, my boy, I thought you were lost. Disgraceful hour, sir," he added,
  with a mild attempt at facetiousness.</p>

  <p>I laughed, and throwing my whip into a corner, poured myself out a cup of
  coffee.</p>

  <p>"Father, what do you think has happened?" I explained. "I have met some
  English friends in Palermo."</p>

  <p>"Who tare they?" he asked, nervously.</p>

  <p>"Lord Parkhurst and his daughter. Lady Olive is a friend of Miss Devereux,
  and a very jolly little girl she is."</p>

  <p>My father nodded. '"Glad you've been enjoying yourself," he remarked. "I
  hope they are going to stay for a time. They'll be company for you."</p>

  <p>"And you, too, father," I added quickly. "Lord Parkhurst wants to call and
  see you. He knows all about us, and he seems very anxious to make your
  acquaintance. Do you mind?"</p>

  <p>My father considered for some time before he answered. I could see that
  the idea half pleased him, although he could not quite make-up his mind to
  break through his old habit.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I should mind much, Hugh," he said at last. "But there's no
  one else, is there?"</p>

  <p>"Only a son and two daughters. Lady Olive is quite as anxious to know you
  as her father. Oh! and there's a fellow called Burton Leigh."</p>

  <p>"Burton Leigh!" repeated my father. "Burton Leigh! There is no man whom I
  should like to meet more if it's the same Burton Leigh who wrote this
  treatise on Modern Mahometanism."</p>

  <p>"Same fellow," I declared, without hesitation. "He looks beastly clever,
  and Lady Olive said that he'd lived for years in Egypt with a tribe of Arabs.
  Same fellow for certain."</p>

  <p>"How strange! When are they coming, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," I answered, invoking secret blessings on the head of Mr.
  Burton Leigh. "They are coming this way to San Martino, and I was to let them
  know whether they might call."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-35"
     id="ch-35"></a>XXXV. &mdash; WE ENTERTAIN AT THE VILLA</h2>

  <p class="first">My father and I were sitting at breakfast on the following
  morning, out of doors, on the wooden balcony, when I again recurred to the
  visit which we were to receive.</p>

  <p>Below us stretched a wild, neglected garden, picturesque but overgrown,
  and further away was a flourishing vineyard and a bare stretch of heath, only
  redeemed from absolute ugliness by the brilliant patches of wild flowers and
  frequent groups of olive trees. Although it was early morning, the warm air
  was already laden with the languid, almost oppressive, scent of wild
  hyacinthe and other odorous plants, and there seemed to be every promise of a
  scorching hot day. As usual, our breakfast consisted almost entirely of
  different sorts of fruits and the wine of the country and until we had nearly
  finished and my father had leaned back in his low wicker chair, with the blue
  smoke from a cigarette curling around him, we scarcely interchanged a
  word.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if there's anything in the house for lunch?" I remarked, rather
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>My father looked at me with a mild astonishment, for we seldom asked one
  another questions of that sort, leaving almost every thing to our
  housekeeper.</p>

  <p>"I haven't the faintest idea," he acknowledged, languidly fanning himself
  with his hat. "Better ask Marie. Why this premature curiosity?"</p>

  <p>I shrugged my shoulders. "We may have company," I remarked.</p>

  <p>My father arched his eyebrows, and looked at me incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Company, nonsense! You haven't asked your friends to luncheon, have
  you?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "Haven't asked them, but I shouldn't wonder if they
  weren't here all the same. They are going to San Martino, and it occurs to me
  that by the time they reach here they may be glad of a rest. It's going to be
  a warmish day."</p>

  <p>Marie had come out to take away the remains of our breakfast, and I
  appealed to her. She shrugged her massive shoulders discouragingly, and held
  up her hands. We were not often home for luncheon, and she had provided
  nothing.</p>

  <p>We looked at one another helplessly, my father and I, and then
  simultaneously broke into a short laugh.</p>

  <p>"Let us hope your friends will have had a good breakfast, Hugh," my father
  said. "But, Marie," he added, "surely there were chickens?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, surely, there were chickens, so many that they were becoming a
  nuisance! Pietro should kill some at once, that they might be cooked and cold
  by luncheon time."</p>

  <p>"And omelettes, Marie; you can make omelettes?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>She was half indignant at the idea of there being any doubt about it!
  Omelettes there could be, surely! Were not her omelettes equal to any one's?
  And if the signors were expecting visitors, they need have no fear!</p>

  <p>They might make their minds quite at rest. Lunch there should be, fit for
  any one.</p>

  <p>We both breathed more freely, and decided that Marie was a treasure. Then
  I lounged off into the garden on a very womanish errand&mdash;namely, to
  gather some flowers to decorate the table with, and finally, having seen all
  things in a state of preparation, I mounted Jacko and rode off towards
  Palermo, leaving my father vastly amused at the orders I had given.</p>

  <p>Just outside the city I met them in a heavy native carriage, and, turning
  round, I rode by their side. Frank and Mr. Leigh were also on mules, but Lady
  Olive, in a cream-colored costume, and with a bunch of hyacinths, which I had
  given her the night before, in her bosom, was sitting in the carriage by her
  father's side. She welcomed me with the most becoming blush, and, as I
  touched her hand, I could not help thinking how fresh, and cool, and
  English-like she appeared. Perhaps my eyes told her something of my
  admiration, for she turned hers quickly away, and seemed eager to commence a
  conversation.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arbuthnot, how strange you look on that animal after the Black
  Prince! Aren't you afraid of your feet touching the ground?"</p>

  <p>"Jacko is not to be despised," I assured her. "I'm afraid the Black
  Prince's knees would suffer in this country. Ever ridden one of these animals
  before?" I asked Mr. Leigh, who was by my side. He smiled at the
  question.</p>

  <p>"In very many countries," he answered. "I've crossed the Pyrenees, and
  cantered into Jerusalem on one. They're sure-footed beasts."</p>

  <p>I looked at him with interest. Evidently he had been a traveller, and he
  was doubtless the man whom my father desired to meet.</p>

  <p>"There was not much opportunity for conversation, for the road was such
  that it took all our attention to remain safely in our saddles. Our progress,
  too, or rather the progress of the carriage, was slow, and long before we had
  arrived at the villa Lord Parkhurst began to look hot and Lady Olive a little
  bored. Only Frank seemed to be thoroughly enjoying himself, with that
  indifference to the weather which a hardy schoolboy generally displays,
  galloping around in circles and urging his animal, a respectable and
  highly-disgusted old mule, into the most extraordinary antics. At last the
  ruined front of the villa, half hidden amongst the grove of orange trees
  which stretched behind it, came in sight.</p>

  <p>"What a dear old place!" remarked Lady Olive. "Who lives there, Mr.
  Arbuthnot?"</p>

  <p>"At present, we do," I said, riding up to the side of the carriage. "If
  you would really like to make my father's acquaintance, Lord Parkhurst, we
  should find him at home now, and he would be pleased to see you."</p>

  <p>Lord Parkhurst seized upon the idea with avidity.</p>

  <p>"I should like it, above all things," he declared, "and a change from this
  beastly rackety machine and this broiling sun will be very welcome. What do
  you say, Olive?"</p>

  <p>Lady Olive was quite of her father's opinion, and so in a few minutes a
  halt was made at the rusty iron gales supported by tottering grey stone
  pillars, and we all trooped up the grass-grown avenue.</p>

  <p>My father met us at the door, and welcomed our guests with an air of
  dignified courtesy of which many years of seclusion had not robbed him. He
  brought up the rear, exchanging affable commonplacisms with Lord Parkhurst,
  whilst I, with Lady Olive and the rest of the party, crossed the marble floor
  of the entrance-hall, stained and discolored by age, and entered the larger
  of the two rooms which we had made some attempt at furnishing. The
  close-drawn blinds had kept out the burning sun, and after the fierce heat
  outside, the room seemed cool and pleasant enough, although its decorations
  were faded and its walls in places dilapidated. Lady Olive, stretched in my
  father's easy chair, pronounced her firm intention of remaining where she was
  until the sun had lost some of its fierceness, and Lord Parkhurst, who was
  fanning himself with an air of great contentment, seemed by no means
  reluctant. So we sat there, a merry, chattering party, my father and Mr.
  Leigh deep in the discussion of some vexed point in the latter's book&mdash;a
  discussion in which Lord Parkhurst seemed also interested&mdash;and we
  younger ones talking in a somewhat lighter vein.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-36"
     id="ch-36"></a>XXXVI. &mdash; MR. BURTON LEIGH</h2>

  <p class="first">"Soon after four o'clock Lord Parkhurst suddenly woke up,
  and remembered that the Convent of San Martino was still unvisited. We were
  recalled from the garden, and after a hasty afternoon tea&mdash;a
  l'Anglaise&mdash;the mules were brought round, and we prepared to make a
  start. At the last moment Mr. Leigh, whose conversation with my father had
  never flagged, begged to be left behind and called for on our return, a
  proposition to which Lord Parkhurst at once good-humoredly assented.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure we have to thank you heartily for your hospitality, Mr.
  Arbuthnot," his lordship remarked, as he bade my father farewell. "We came to
  call on you for a few minutes, and have quartered ourselves upon you for the
  day. I do hope you'll return our visit. I've taken the Palazzo Pericilo, in
  Palermo, for a month. Your son'll soon be able to show you where it is, I
  hope," he added, turning to me.</p>

  <p>My father made some courteous but indefinite reply as he walked down the
  hall with his departing guests. To have looked at the two men, any one would
  certainly have supposed the positions reversed, and that my father had been
  the distinguished diplomatist and peer, whose visit was an honor, and Lord
  Parkhurst the man without a name.</p>

  <p>"Your father is a veritable grand seigneur," Lady Olive said to me, as we
  stood at the gate prepared to start. "I never saw a more
  distinguished-looking man." And, though I only laughed at her, I was
  pleased.</p>

  <p>The ride to San Martino was a delightful one. We entered at once, after
  leaving the villa, into a narrow, rugged glen, which led us higher and
  higher, until at last Palermo, with its marvellously beautiful plain, and the
  blue water of the Mediterranean sweeping into its bay, lay stretched out
  behind us like a beautiful panorama. Though we were high up in the mountains,
  we were still surrounded by the most luxuriant vegetation, and a sudden turn
  in the road showed us, thousands of feet below, a beautifully cultivated
  valley in the bed of which were dense groves of orange trees, while its sides
  were laid out as vineyards and wheat-fields. But perhaps the most beautiful
  sight of all was the huge facade of the Convent of San Martino, which we came
  upon unexpectedly, and which seemed to be heaved out of the earth by some
  caprice of nature.</p>

  <p>More than an hour we spent wandering about its vast open corridors and
  magnificent staircases, and, melancholy and silent though it was, its
  grandeur and solemnity, and, above all, the silence which reigned throughout
  the enormous building, made a strong impression upon us. Even Lady Olive
  forebore to chatter, and we none of us felt inclined to speak above a
  whisper. For my part I was not sorry when our tour of inspection was over,
  for the place seemed to me depressing in its vast emptiness, and I think the
  others were of the same opinion, for we all gave a simultaneous gesture of
  relief when we stood again in the open air.</p>

  <p>"We'll go back now, I think," said Lord Parkhurst, yawning. "What do you
  say, Olive? Had enough sight-seeing?"</p>

  <p>Lady Olive was content to do anything, so I handed her into the carriage,
  and we started homewards, with a fresh breeze from the Mediterranean blowing
  in our faces, and the glorious prospect of Palermo at the edge of the most
  luxurious plain of Southern Europe before our eyes.</p>

  <p>In about an hour we reached the villa, and found my father and Mr. Leigh,
  with a pile of books before them, still eagerly conversing. I had promised
  Lady Olive in a weak moment to return and dine with them, but when Lord
  Parkhurst cordially extended the invitation to my father, I could scarcely
  believe my ears when I heard him, after a moment's indecision, accept. But he
  did so, and after a very few minutes' delay we all set out together for
  Palermo.</p>

  <p>That was a very pleasant day&mdash;so pleasant that I felt almost inclined
  to echo Lady Olive's words whispered to me as we lounged about on the Marina,
  pretending to listen to the band, and call it one of the happiest of my life.
  I had never seen my father so thoroughly interested as he was with Mr. Leigh,
  and as we rode home together in the moonlight I asked him about it.</p>

  <p>"I never met a man to whom I took such a liking, or in whom I was more
  interested," my father declared. "He has lived for a long time amongst the
  Arabs, and seems to have been much impressed by them. He is a disciple of a
  very curious Calvinistic doctrine of fatalism, which has a good deal of
  resemblance to the creed of the nomad Arabs. I don't think it ever struck him
  till I pointed it out."</p>

  <p>"He is going back to Egypt, isn't he?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"He is. There is a storm brewing there, and he is going to try and see
  what he can do to prevent mischief. He has asked me to go with him, Hugh," my
  father added quietly.</p>

  <p>"But you won't go," I cried.</p>

  <p>He looked at me with one of his old sweet smiles, which it filled me with
  joy to see again, and he rested his arm for a moment on my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, I have promised to think it over. Before I decide, we will have a
  talk about it; but not to-night, not to-night."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-37"
     id="ch-37"></a>XXXVII. &mdash; CUT DOWN</h2>

  <p class="first">It must have been a little before six o'clock on the
  following morning, when I was suddenly aroused from sleep, and, opening my
  eyes, saw my father, half-dressed, bending over me with his hand on my
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Wake up, Hugh!" he cried, "wake up!"</p>

  <p>I sat up in bed, bewildered and amazed.</p>

  <p>My father, with an anxious face, was rapidly putting on his boots.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" I asked, springing out of bed. "Is there anything
  wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Dress yourself quick and follow me. I am going to Jose's. Pietro has just
  come, and says that there was some desperate fighting last night between the
  brigands and some travellers on their way to Palermo. Two of the brigands
  were killed, but they have captured the man who killed them. Pietro thinks he
  was an Englishman. They will hang him this morning unless we can prevent it.
  Hurry, Hugh, and come after me. You don't know what those fellows are if they
  can lay their hands on any one who has killed one of their band. Sure as
  fate, they'll hang him. I fear that we may be too late now. I shall take the
  mountain road."</p>

  <p>All the time my father had been talking he had been completing a hasty
  toilette, and, now he had finished, he hurried from the room, and directly
  afterwards I heard Jacko cantering down the avenue. In a few minutes I, too,
  was dressed and following him on foot.</p>

  <p>Our villa was four miles and a half from the hill on which Monsieur Jose
  and his friends had pitched their habitation, and it was uphill all the way,
  and a very rough road. The path&mdash;it was a mere mountain track&mdash;was
  covered with loose stones, and in many places was but a few feet wide. Below
  sloped, with the abruptness of a precipice, the green hillside dotted with
  olive trees and aloe shrubs, and above the vegetation grew more and more
  stunted, and great masses of rock jutted out and lay about the barren brown
  summit. I was running towards the sea, and the soft invigorating breeze which
  blew steadily in my teeth seemed to lend me an added vigor, for when I caught
  my father up, close to our destination, I was as fresh as at the start. Side
  by side we reached the chasm-like gorge which separated the range of hills
  which we had been traversing from the solitary one behind which was the
  brigands' dwelling-place. Here we halted, and my father, dismounting, put two
  of his fingers in his mouth and whistled a peculiar screech like whistle,
  which I had often vainly tried to imitate.</p>

  <p>At first there was no answer, save the echoes which came mockingly back
  again and again. Again he gave the signal, and this time one of the band made
  a cautious appearance from behind a knoll of trees, and, see ing who we were,
  came forward and threw a rough bridge, formed from the trunk of a tree,
  across the chasm. We were on the other side in a moment, and I hurried up the
  steep hillside whilst my father remained behind to exchange a few sentences
  with the man whose vile patois I could not pretend to understand. He caught
  me up at the summit and, without stopping, ran down the green footpath,
  calling out to me&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Quick, Hugh, we shall only be just in time. They are going to hang
  him!"</p>

  <p>Below us stretched the deep blue waters of the Mediterranean, gleaming and
  sparkling in the morning's sun, and though we were within a couple of hundred
  yards of our destination, not a sound broke the dead silence, nor was there
  any sign of human life anywhere about. We reached the edge of the cliff and
  half fearfully looked down below. Instantly, the whole view burst upon us,
  and we saw that we were but barely in time. As we looked upon the little
  scene, with its picturesque grouping, it seemed hard to believe that it was
  not some elaborate tableau which met our horrified eyes, rather than a grim,
  ghastly reality. Standing about on the smooth, velvety little stretch of
  turf, which seemed to hang right over the sea like a suspended platform, were
  the brigands, most of them with folded arms, and all with eyes fixed upon the
  little grove of cypresses. Foremost amongst them stood Jose, with a long
  cigarette between his thin lips, and a fierce, satisfied look upon his dark
  face. Simultaneously our eyes followed theirs, and a sickening horror crept
  over me, for, dangling from the boughs of one of the trees, was the
  struggling, quivering body of a man, whose feet, only a few inches from the
  ground, were making spasmodic but vain efforts to reach it. It was a fearful
  sight.</p>

  <p>With a cry which rang out like the angry roar of a lion, my father sprang
  forward. For a moment he balanced himself on the edge of the cliff, and then
  with a single bound, which turned my heart sick to see, he leaped on to the
  plateau below. With fascinated eyes I watched him rush to the tree with the
  gleaming blade of a knife in his hand, and in a second the rope was severed,
  and the man lay in a heap on the ground, and then with a wild cry and a look
  on his face which no mortal painter could have depicted and no words
  describe, my father threw his hands up towards the heavens, and staggered
  backwards.</p>

  <p>I rushed down the narrow path and stood by his side. His whole frame was
  shaking as though with a great horror; but his face, white to the lips, was
  rigid as solid marble. As he felt my touch upon his arm, he pointed with
  quivering finger to the man who lay doubled up upon the ground, although no
  sound came from him. With a new horror my eyes followed his gesture, and the
  man was my Uncle Rupert.</p>

  <p>The momentary torpor into which my father's' sudden appearance and action
  had thrown the little company of brigands had passed away, and with an angry
  exclamation Jose sprung forward.</p>

  <p>"Mille diable! what did the Monsieur Anglais mean by this interference!
  How dared he thus presume to interfere with a simple act of justice?"</p>

  <p>"Carlo! Paulato! String the fellow up again at once," he added, turning
  rapidly around.</p>

  <p>My father seemed to have recovered himself; but, to my surprise, he stood
  stock still.</p>

  <p>"Father, they will hang him again," I cried; but he never moved.</p>

  <p>I looked into his face, and shrunk back terrified. The passionate hatred
  of a lifetime was convulsing and blackening his features, and flashing
  fiercely from his blazing eyes.</p>

  <p>"Let them," he muttered, "let them. A dog's death is fittest for him!"</p>

  <p>One swift thought saved him. He was Maud's father. I hastened forward and
  wrenched the rope from the hands of the men who were binding it together.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Jose," I cried, "tell me for what you hang this man? What has he
  done?"</p>

  <p>"Killed two of my best comrades," was the prompt reply, "and by heaven, he
  shall swing for it."</p>

  <p>The rope was wrenched from my hands and adjusted round Rupert Devereux's
  neck. He was conscious now, but half dazed, and unable to make any
  resistance. Seizing him by the collar, I released him from the men's grasp,
  and dragged him with me to the side of the hill, against which I set my back.
  They sprang after me, but started back with a quick exclamation, for they
  looked into the black muzzle of my father's revolver.</p>

  <p>"You are right, Hugh," he cried, "I was mad! Monsieur Jose, listen to me,"
  he added quickly. "This man is an Englishman, and you know very well what
  that means! To take his life would be to compass your own extermination. He
  is a man of great position, and if you killed him, sure as there is a heaven
  above us, you would he hunted out and hanged, every man of you."</p>

  <p>"Who is to tell of his death?" Jose answered.</p>

  <p>"I shall," was the firm reply. "And if you kill us, your fate is all the
  surer, for we, too, are English and it is known that we have come here. Be
  sensible, Jose. Why kill him? What good will that do you? Why not a
  ransom?"</p>

  <p>The battle was won, but Monsieur Jose, did not yield all at once.</p>

  <p>"He has killed two of my best fellows," he said, sullenly.</p>

  <p>'"What of that? It was done in fair fight, I suppose? He did not attack
  them."</p>

  <p>Monsieur Jose retired and consulted with his men. Presently he
  re-appeared, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Arbuthnot," he said, "we are anxious to oblige a friend whom we
  value so much as you, but, at the same time, we feel the loss of two such
  well-beloved comrades as Pintro and Salino deeply; so deeply, in fact, that
  we cannot see our way to fix the ransom at less than two thousand pounds
  English.</p>

  <p>"They shall have it," groaned Rupert Devereux, lifting his head.</p>

  <p>"Good! Where is the money to be got?" inquired Jose, with twinkling
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"There is as much in Rothschild's bank at Rome. Send one of your men to
  Palermo with a telegram, and let him wait till the money is wired to my
  credit. If you will give me something to write with, I will give him
  authority to draw it."</p>

  <p>It was done, and then, whilst Jose withdrew to consult with his followers
  as to who should be the messenger, my Uncle Rupert turned slowly round and
  looked into my father's face.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-38"
     id="ch-38"></a>XXXVIII. &mdash; AN OMINOUS NOTE</h2>

  <p class="first">It was a strange meeting. Full, of a great throbbing hope, I
  glanced from one to another of their faces. My father's was white and set and
  stern. My Uncle Rupert's was ghastly pale, sad, and expressionless.</p>

  <p>"I owe my life to you and your son," he said slowly. "Would to God it had
  been to any other man!"</p>

  <p>"You speak well," my father answered.</p>

  <p>"You owe your life to the man whose life you have made a living hell.
  Strange things have happened, but none stranger than this! Why, I have prayed
  with a sinking heart, Rupert Devereux, that if chance should bring us face to
  face I might not kill you. And I have saved your life. How came you
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Bound to Palermo with a letter for Lord Parkhurst from England. They told
  me at Rome that he was here, so I followed."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence save for the hum of clamorous voices from the
  little group of brigands. My father's eyes were fixed upon Rupert Devereux's
  white, anguish-smitten, face, full of stern expectation. But neither spoke
  for many minutes.</p>

  <p>"I am waiting to hear what you have to say to me," my father said at last.
  "I have saved your life. 'Tis a deed which most men would deem deserving of
  reward. I ask no reward, but I demand justice of you, Rupert Devereux. For
  the long, weary years of my wasted life you can return me nothing. But you
  can give me back my name to die under and to leave to my son. Speak."</p>

  <p>Like a man who is torn asunder by a passionate indecision, Rupert Devereux
  hid his face in his hands, and rocked himself to and fro.</p>

  <p>"Herbert," he moaned, "would to God you had let me die! Oh, how can I do
  this thing, how can I? It is not for myself I care, but for my son, for my
  daughter. They would never speak to me again. They would hate me.</p>

  <p>"That they should do so would be a just punishment," was my father's stern
  reply. "You have built up your life upon a lie, and this is your reward.
  Rupert Devereux I demand that you make a full confession, and restore to me
  my honor! If you have one single spark of conscience left, you cannot deny
  me. You shall not deny me!"</p>

  <p>He turned away again and groaned. Almost I could have pitied him.</p>

  <p>"I cannot do it. I cannot do it," he moaned. "Oh! think what it means! To
  cut myself off from life and the world. To make myself an object of contempt
  for all men. To forfeit everything that I have won. To endure the everlasting
  scorn of my children. Oh! Herbert, will you really ask me to do all
  this?"</p>

  <p>"Ask! No! I demand it!" my father thundered. "Think of my sufferings;
  think of my five-and-twenty years, the best part of my life, hidden away in a
  secret corner of the earth, never setting eyes on my country or the home I
  love&mdash;a stranger to my children and a stranger to my father. What can
  you suffer more than this? Speak, Rupert Devereux, and quickly, or I shall
  kill you where you stand."</p>

  <p>He turned around white and resolute.</p>

  <p>"Kill me, then. I wish for nothing else. There is not a more miserable man
  than I on earth. You talk of your wasted years and weary exile, and yet you
  have not suffered as I have. You have had a clear conscience; I have had a
  guilty one. Everything I have won, every success, every joy I have stretched
  out my hand for has tasted like ashes between my teeth. Yours has been a
  passive sorrow&mdash;my life has been one long hell of remorse. But I will
  not do this thing. I will not pull down with my own hand what it has taken so
  many years to build up. I will not make my children hate me. Go your way,
  Herbert, or kill me if you like&mdash;I am indifferent."</p>

  <p>I saw my father's arm lifted to strike him, but the blow never fell.
  Instead, his arm sank to his side and he turned away.</p>

  <p>"Hugh," he said to me, in a low, hollow voice, "let us go. Let us go now.
  God keep him and me apart. I thought I saw him at that moment dead! murdered
  by me! I will not kill him! I will not kill him!"</p>

  <p>Jose came hurrying out to us.</p>

  <p>"Messieurs," he said, anxiously, "I must ask of you for a pledge before
  you go. Not to a soul will you mention the presence of that gentilhomme in
  our tents, and you will attempt no rescue, or to interfere with the ransom.
  You must swear this."</p>

  <p>"Ay, I swear it," said my father, and I echoed his words.</p>

  <p>"It is good," Jose declared, smiling and twirling his long black
  moustachios. "Messieurs will oblige me by accepting a cigarette. No. Very
  good. Monsieur will allow me, at any rate, to render him my most hearty
  thanks for having prevented us from committing an act of great folly. This
  ransom will be a gift from heaven. It will enable me to leave this country,
  and seek a more stirring life. Life here is dull&mdash;very dull."</p>

  <p>My father nodded, and passed on.</p>

  <p>"Good day, Monsieur Jose," he said, briefly, and then we strode away to
  where Jacko was still patiently waiting. He mounted, and rode on, leaving me
  far behind, for the sun was high in the heavens, and the heat was great. When
  I reached home he had gone to his room, and on trying the door softly I found
  it locked. So I stole away again again downstairs and waited.</p>

  <p>Hour after hour passed, but still he did not come down. At last, to my
  inexpressible relief, I heard the door of his room open, and he slowly
  descended. He opened the door and stood before me, gaunt and hollow-eyed, but
  with an air of resolution about him which struck me with a chill
  foreboding.</p>

  <p>I greeted him cheerfully, and asked whether I should have some lunch
  brought in for him, but he took no notice.</p>

  <p>"Hugh," he said, quietly, "I wonder whether you would mind riding into
  Palermo with this letter and bringing me an answer."</p>

  <p>I rose up and took it at once, glancing nervously at the address. As I had
  feared, it was directed to Burton Leigh, Esq.</p>

  <p>"I will go, father," I said; and with a heavy heart I saddled Jacko and
  started off. In the grounds of Lord Parkhurst's villa, fast asleep in a
  miniature kiosk, I came, upon Mr. Leigh. I woke him and gave him the
  note.</p>

  <p>He read it through, and when he had finished smiled as though well
  pleased.</p>

  <p>"Tell your father," he said, "that I will breakfast with him to-morrow
  morning. You are coming up to the villa?"</p>

  <p>But I shook my head and turned away. I was in no mood for Lord Parkhurst's
  kindly talk or Lady Olive's merry chatter. Already I began to see that a
  great trouble was looming before me.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-39"
     id="ch-39"></a>XXXIX. &mdash; MY FATHER'S RESOLUTION</h2>

  <p class="first">The whole of the following morning my father spent with Mr.
  Leigh, who arrived in answer to his invitation soon after nine o'clock.</p>

  <p>When I returned to lunch he was still there, and it was not until evening
  that I found myself alone with my father.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, I have something to say to you," he began, gravely, "something
  important."</p>

  <p>I waited in silence, preparing to do battle with a sinking heart. But as I
  looked into his worn, sad face, I saw there was a change in it which favored
  little the chances of my opposition. The vacuity of hopeless weariness had
  gone, and in its place shone the light of a great resolution. How should I
  hope to bend it!</p>

  <p>"Hugh, my boy," my father, began, "I owe to you a greater debt than father
  ever owed son."</p>

  <p>I would have interrupted him, but he held up his hand with an imperative
  gesture, which I could not choose but to obey. And so I listened in
  silence.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to speak of this black cloud, which fate seems to have
  decreed should never be rolled away from my head," he went on. "What would be
  the use? Twelve months ago I tasted the very bittermost depths of misery. It
  seemed to me then that I must either go mad or take my life. It was your
  letter, Hugh, which saved me from either fate. God bless you for it!"</p>

  <p>He turned away as though to watch the sun shoot down its parting rays on
  the brown hillside. But I knew that he had another reason for looking away,
  and a womanish longing came over me to seize his hands and breathe out fond
  words. But somehow I could not. I don't know how others find it, but it
  always seems to me to be as difficult for a man to give vent to his feelings
  as it is for women to conceal them. Between man and man there is always a
  curious shrinking from the displayal of any emotion, more especially when it
  takes the form of affection. To me, at any rate, it has always seemed so,
  and, though my heart was full of a wild sympathy, and there was a great lump
  in my throat, I said nothing.</p>

  <p>"From the moment when you came to me, Hugh," my father proceeded, "life
  began to be endurable. The months which we have spent together here have been
  by far the brightest I have ever known since we were all together in
  Devonshire. But we cannot go on for ever like this."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" I dissented. "Life is very pleasant here to me, at any rate.
  Where could we find a better dwelling place?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Life is not given to us to drone away," he answered. "A man's life should
  include a career, should be always shaping itself to wards a definite end. It
  is a crime against nature, against our great destiny, for a young man like
  you to live as we are doing; and it must not be."</p>

  <p>"What would you have me do?" I cried. "Cannot we do something
  together?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head with a sad, yet pleased smile.</p>

  <p>"I have already decided," he said, gravely. "Chance has been kind to me,
  and has thrown in my way the man most likely to be of use to me. I will tell
  you more of this presently. For me the field of choice has not been
  large&mdash;for you it is illimitable. Hugh, this is what I chiefly want to
  say to you. It is my wish, my strong heartfelt wish, that you should accept
  your grandfather's offer and take your rightful name and position."</p>

  <p>I looked at him incredulous, bewildered, hurt. Of all things I had least
  expected this.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he wont on, speaking more rapidly, and with a deep earnestness in
  his tone and manner, "it is my great wish. Do not think, Hugh, my boy, that I
  have not appreciated your chivalrous renunciation of it. The thought has been
  very dear to me, that my son has preferred poverty and obscurity out of mere
  resentment for my bitter wrongs. But of late I have seen this matter in a
  different light. Between my father and I, Hugh, there has been no injustice.
  He was hard, but he is a soldier, bred and born with all a soldier's
  instincts. He has honestly believed me guilty, and I bear him no resentment.
  He, too, must have suffered, Hugh, for I was his favorite son."</p>

  <p>Suffered! Aye, I knew that he had suffered; but what were all his
  sufferings to me compared with my father's!</p>

  <p>"Hugh, it has become a bitter thought to me that, innocent as I am of all
  offence against him, I am keeping away from him by keeping you with
  me&mdash;a great consolation; and not only that, but I am keeping you away
  from a great name, and a great position. It has grown upon me, Hugh, this
  bitter thought, and now I pray you, I command you as my son, that when you
  leaves me, as leave me you must, you go to him."</p>

  <p>"Why must I leave you, father?" I asked. "Let me go with you where you are
  going?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is absolutely Impossible. I am going, Hugh, with Mr. Leigh, to travel
  in Northern Egypt. There is no race in the world in whom I have fell more
  interest, and Mr. Leigh has strengthened it. He has spent long years with
  them, living with a tribe of Arabs in a tent, and sharing their life. He
  knows their language and their customs. He has been as one of themselves,
  and, save in the forms of their religion, he has become one of them, and now
  he has had disquieting news of his favorite race. False prophets are working
  upon their imagination, and stirring them up to no good end, striving to
  incite them to rise against their best friends, the English! Matters are fast
  coming to a crisis, and Mr. Leigh is going back to his old tribe to try and
  regain his former influence with them, and to keep them, at any rate, out of
  the troubles which are fast arising. He has asked me to go with him, Hugh,
  and I have consented. It is the sort of enterprise which I most desired.
  There is a little danger, it is true, but if the worst should happen I shall
  end my days not by my own hand, as one day I had feared that I should, but
  sword in hand with a clear conscience. Could a soldier wish for anything
  better?"</p>

  <p>"I will go with you," I cried, passionately. "Father, yon shall not leave
  me thus!"</p>

  <p>He left his chair, and, coming to me, laid his hand upon my shoulder. He
  had drawn himself up to his full height, and stood looking there every inch a
  soldier, stately, imperious, and commanding.</p>

  <p>"Hugh," he said, firmly, "you have been the best son to me a father ever
  had, and you will not thwart me now. Go with me to Egypt you cannot. I forbid
  it. Command you to take your rightful name, I cannot; but I desire it above
  all things. Take a day to think it over, and let me know your decision
  to-morrow. Shall we leave it like that?"</p>

  <p>Sorrowfully I bowed my head, and then I left the room, wandering,
  aimlessly out into the twilight, I cared not whither. Down the grass-grown
  avenue I went, and out on to the white road, with a great weight of grief
  upon my heart, and a dull despair numbing my senses. It seemed to me that the
  crisis of my life had come at last, and whichever way I looked black clouds
  were looming before me. Almost I wished that I might die.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-40"
     id="ch-40"></a>XL. &mdash; A HORRIBLE MISTAKE</h2>

  <p class="first">What led me there I cannot imagine, save it was a wild
  desire to escape for a brief while from the thoughts that were tormenting me,
  but an hour or two later I was on the Marina, mixing with gay throngs of
  merry pleasure-seekers, stalking amongst them like a Banquo at a feast. And
  whom should I meet there but Lady Olive! Lady Olive alone, for her brother
  and sister had left her for a moment to buy bon-bons.</p>

  <p>She greeted me with some laughing speech, but her face grew grave as she
  looked into my face.</p>

  <p>"Something has happened, Mr. Arbuthnot?" she said, quickly; and then, as I
  made no answer, she placed her hand in my arm, and led me away from the
  people down towards the seat on which we had sat the first evening of our
  meeting there.</p>

  <p>It was a night which mocks description. The sweet, subtle perfumes with
  which the soft night breeze was laden, the dark boughs of the cypress trees
  over our heads, the glittering, sparkling sea stretching away before us to
  the horizon, the picturesque town with its white villas and rows of houses
  standing out clear and distinct in the brilliant moon light-all these had a
  softening effect upon me. I looked into Lady Olive's dark, expressive eyes,
  and I felt as though I must weep.</p>

  <p>I do not believe there lives a man who has not, at some time or other of
  his existence, felt a longing for a woman's sympathy. There is an art and a
  tact in its bestowal which only a woman properly understands. A man may speak
  words of comfort in a rough, hearty sort of way; but the chances are that he
  will strike the wrong vein and leave unsaid the words which would have been
  most efficient. He has not the keen, fine perceptions which a woman has in
  such matters, and which have made it her peculiar province to play the part
  of comforter.</p>

  <p>I was not then, or at any other time in love with Lady Olive. But as I
  looked into her dark, eager eyes as we sat side by side on the seat under the
  cypress trees, I could not help thinking that it would be very pleasant to
  win from her a few kind words and the sympathy which I knew was there waiting
  to be kindled, and so, when she asked me again what was the matter, I
  hesitated only for a moment, and then told her.</p>

  <p>She knew most of my history; why should she not know all? And so I told
  her, and she listened with all the gaiety gone from her face, and her eye's
  growing sadder and sadder. When I had finished there were great tears in
  them.</p>

  <p>"What can I say to comfort you?" she whispered, softly. "Tell me, and I
  will say it&mdash;anything!"</p>

  <p>My sorrow had blunted my senses, or I must have seen whither we were
  drifting; but I was blind, blind with the selfishness of a great grief, and I
  caught at her sympathy like a drowning man at a straw.</p>

  <p>"I am alone in the world, Lady Olive, or I shall be in a week or two's
  time," I said. "Tell me what to do with myself."</p>

  <p>"How can I tell you?" she answered, with streaming eyes. "But you must not
  say that you are alone in the world. My father would be your friend if you
  would let him&mdash;and so would I."</p>

  <p>I took her hand, which yielded itself readily to mine, and raised it to my
  lips. I felt just then as though I dare not speak, lest my voice should be
  unsteady. I looked instead into her face gratefully, and it seemed to me that
  a change had come over it, a change which puzzled me. The lips were
  quivering, and out of her soft, tender eyes the laughing sparkle seemed to
  have gone. It was another Lady Olive, surely, this grave, sweet-faced,
  tremulous woman, with her eyes cast down, and a faint pink glow in her
  cheeks! Nothing of the gay, light-hearted, chattering little flirt, with her
  arched looks and piquant attitude, seemed left. I was puzzled. Was she,
  indeed, so tender-hearted?</p>

  <p>"And do you really mean," she whispered, stealing a glance up at me, "that
  if your father goes away, there is nothing left in the world, which could
  give you any pleasure? Nothing you would wish for?"</p>

  <p>I thought of Maud&mdash;when was I not think ing of her?&mdash;and sighed
  bitterly!</p>

  <p>"Only one thing," I said, "and that I can not have."</p>

  <p>"Won't you tell me what it is?" she asked, hesitatingly, with her eyes
  fixed upon the ground.</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "I think not. No; it would be better not."</p>

  <p>There was a short silence. Then she lifted her beautiful eyes to mine for
  a moment, and dropped them again instantly, with a deep blush. I was puzzled.
  There was something in them which I could not read, something inviting,
  beseeching, tender. Knowing what I know now, it seems to me that I must have
  been a blind, senseless fool. But it is easy to be wise afterwards, and my
  own sorrows were absorbing every sense.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me this?" she asked. "Does this one thing include somebody
  else?"</p>

  <p>She had read my secret, then; she knew that I loved Maud. Well, it was not
  very strange that she should have guessed it after all!</p>

  <p>"Yes, you have guessed it, Lady Olive," I said, quietly, with my eyes
  fixed upon the line of the horizon where a star-bespangled sky seemed to
  touch the glistening, dancing sea. "You have guessed it; but, remember, I
  never told you."</p>

  <p>I felt a soft breath on my cheek, and before I could move a pair of white
  arms were thrown around my neck, and a tear-stained half-blushing,
  half-smiling face, with a mass of ruffled hair, was lying on my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;why have you made me guess, Hugh? Why could you not tell me?
  You know that&mdash;that I&mdash;I love you!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Father, I have decided."</p>

  <p>I stood before him dishevelled and weary, for I had been out all night,
  seeking to ease my heart of its pain by physical fatigue.</p>

  <p>He turned and looked at me in surprise&mdash;a surprise which changed into
  a look of grave sorrow as his eyes dwelt upon me.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, you have been up all night," he said reprovingly; "you will be
  ill!"</p>

  <p>I laughed recklessly.</p>

  <p>"What matters? Do men die of a broken heart, I wonder? I would that they
  did?"</p>

  <p>He came to me, and laid his hands upon my shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, my boy, do you want to break mine?"</p>

  <p>I turned away, and buried my face in my hands. This last sorrow, which had
  come to me filling me with shame, with self-reproach, with pity, had been the
  filling of my cup.</p>

  <p>Lady Olive's white, horror-struck face, as my blundering words had told
  her the truth, had been before me all the night, and like a haunting,
  reproachful shadow, seemed as though it would never leave me. I was unnerved
  and weak, and before I well knew what was going to happen, the hot tears were
  streaming from my eyes.</p>

  <p>I was the better for them. When I stood before my father again I felt more
  like myself.</p>

  <p>"I have decided," I said, calmly. "I have prayed you to let me go with
  you, and you have refused. God knows I would rather go with you; but, if you
  will not have me, I must stay behind. I will take the name of Devereux, since
  you wish it, and since you say that my taking it will make you happier. But
  into Devereux Court I will not go. I have sworn it before heaven, and I will
  not break my oath!"</p>

  <p>"But you will see your grandfather?"</p>

  <p>"I will see him anywhere else but at Devereux; I shall write him and tell
  him so. And as to my future, I have but one desire-to enter the army."</p>

  <p>A look almost of peace came into my father's face.</p>

  <p>"You have made me very glad, Hugh," he said simply. "But about our home?
  Supposing your grandfather and I both die, and you became Sir Hugh
  Devereux?"</p>

  <p>"Then my oath ceases, and I shall go there. But whilst he holds out his
  hand to me, and not to you, I will not take it. That will I not depart
  from."</p>

  <p>My father said never another word; but I knew that he was satisfied.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-41"
     id="ch-41"></a>XLI. &mdash; TWO YEARS AFTER</h2>

  <p class="first">"Colonel Sir Francis Devereux to see you, sir."</p>

  <p>I turned away from the window of my room, whence I had been gazing idly
  into the dreary barrack square below, and advanced to greet the stately,
  grey-headed old man who stood in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Surprised to see me, Hugh, eh?" he asked, sinking into my one easy
  chair.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect you in town again so soon," I acknowledged. "But I'm very
  glad to see you. You know that."</p>

  <p>"Are you?" he said shortly. "Then why the devil can't you come and see me
  sometimes? A nice thing to bring an old man over seventy years of ago a
  couple of hundred miles whenever he wants to have a word or two with his
  grandson! Damn it, sir, you're as obstinate as a mule!"</p>

  <p>I did not answer him. He knew very well why I would not go to Devereux.
  What was the use of treading all over the old ground again?</p>

  <p>"More rumors in the 'Times,' this morning, I see, about Burton Leigh and
  Mr. Arbuthnot," he remarked, after a short silence. "They say they've been
  handed over to the Mahdi, now. Don't believe a word of it!"</p>

  <p>"I hope to God that it's not true," I groaned; "but in any case they must
  be in terrible danger. The Mahdi is gaining fresh followers every day, and
  they must be in the very centre of the most perilous district. Why on earth
  the Government doesn't make a decided move, I can't imagine!"</p>

  <p>Sir Francis looked at me for a moment, half sadly, with an expression on
  his face which I scarcely understood. Then he sighed.</p>

  <p>"I have brought you news, Hugh," he said, slowly.</p>

  <p>"News!" I repeated; and then a sudden light flashed in upon me.</p>

  <p>"Tell me quick," I cried. "You have been with Lord Cannington?"</p>

  <p>My grandfather nodded.</p>

  <p>"I left him only a quarter of an hour ago, at Whitehall, and came down
  here as fast as a hansom could bring me. The 17th, 19th and 21st are ordered
  out. 'Twill be in tonight's 'Gazette'."</p>

  <p>I could have shouted, done any mad thing, in my great joy. But I sat quite
  still in my chair, grasping its sides, and struggling to conceal my
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"Thank God!" I murmured, fervently, "this is what I have prayed for. I am
  sick of playing at being a soldier, of lounging about here, whilst
  he&mdash;others&mdash;were in such mortal peril."</p>

  <p>He sat looking at me, nodding his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"He! others! Ah, well! But I have more news for you, Hugh. Who do you
  think is appointed to the colonelcy of the 18th?"</p>

  <p>"Utterson? Haigh?" He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Your Uncle Rupert."</p>

  <p>I was not surprised, for I had heard rumors that it might be so. But it
  seemed very strange when I thought it over. Were we three to meet again, I
  wondered.</p>

  <p>"Yes," my grandfather went on, with a shade of sadness in his tone, "I am
  to be left quite alone again, you see."</p>

  <p>"Miss Devereux will be with you, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Maud! Oh, yes, Maud will be with me. What's come to her, I don't know.
  She's refused Lord Annerley and Captain Bryant, and I don't know how many
  others, and seems settling down into an old maid. Hugh, I'm getting a nervous
  old man, I think, but I shall have no peace till you get back again. When I
  think that if anything happened to you&mdash;which God forbid&mdash;that
  dissipated, low young cub of a nephew of mine would be my heir, it makes me
  feel sick. I'd burn Devereux Court above my head rather than that should
  be."</p>

  <p>"It is not likely than anything will happen to me, grandfather," I said,
  bitterly. "There is one who should be dearer to you than I, who stands in
  greater peril."</p>

  <p>He shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"He is nothing to me; nothing. He is your father, Hugh, and I have never
  blamed you for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And he is your son," I interrupted. Sir Francis looked at me sternly.</p>

  <p>"He is nothing to me. I disowned him."</p>

  <p>"Ay, disowned him! I know that. You disowned him. You believed that
  accursed lie against your own son's words."</p>

  <p>"I believed in the decision of the court-martial," he said with all his
  old severity of tone and manner. "And if the same thing were to happen over
  again with you, Hugh, I should do exactly the same. I would never look upon
  your face again."</p>

  <p>"I am in no danger," I answered, bitterly. "I have no younger brother who
  would gain a fortune by my ruin."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, sir?"</p>

  <p>"What I say. 'Tis simple enough! I tell you now, what I have told you
  before, that your son Rupert forged that lie against my father that he might
  take his place as your heir. Or was done in a mad impulse of jealousy, and
  thank God, his conscience has punished him for it! Look at his life! Can't
  you see that there is something amiss with it? Has he not always seemed like
  a man haunted by some guilty shadow? From one career he has passed to
  another, never, satisfied, never happy. He made two great speeches in
  Parliament, and then resigned his seat to travel abroad. He became famous as
  a writer and novelist, and now never touches a pen. Can't you see it written
  into his face&mdash;a guilty conscience? Why, if it had not been for that, I
  should have killed him, on my word and honor, grandfather. I have heard him
  with his own lips acknowledge it, and in my desk there is the confession of
  John Hilton, whom he bribed. Grandfather, chance may bring him and me
  together before long. You know in your heart that the man who is braving all
  the worst terrors of death amongst a fanatical people to save them from
  bloodshed and to urge them against a hopeless struggle, you know that this
  man is not a coward! Go into the clubs and listen to what they are saying
  about these two Englishmen who have pushed their way alone into an unknown
  country amongst a savage people. Say that you believe Burton Leigh's
  companion to be a coward, and you will be ridiculed. Grandfather, if he
  escapes&mdash;they say that escape is almost impossible for them&mdash;but if
  fate does bring us together again, may I take him a message from
  you&mdash;one word?"</p>

  <p>"You may not."</p>

  <p>The words came with a hard and cutting distinctness. I drew back chilled
  and bitterly disappointed.</p>

  <p>"You are blinded, Hugh, by your love for your father. I do not blame you
  for it, but I am sorry, that you re-opened this subject. When a court-martial
  shall reverse the decision of five-and-twenty years ago, then and then only
  will I crave my son's pardon, and welcome him back to Devereux. Enough of the
  subject."</p>

  <p>Proud, obstinate old soldier! For a moment my heart leaped with anger, but
  it died away again almost immediately. Surely it was more his misfortune than
  his fault that his military training and instincts should have made him a
  soldier first and a father afterwards, and I thought of his long, cheerless
  life, and of the agony under which he had writhed because of the blot upon
  the name which he loved, and I pitied him.</p>

  <p>"Will you dine with me at the Army and Navy, Hugh?" he asked, in an
  altered tone. "I must see as much as I can of you now."</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"Dine away from mess to-night? Why, not a man will do that with this
  glorious news to talk about! You must mess with us, sir!"</p>

  <p>He smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"Glorious news, indeed! Because you're going out to cut a lot of
  half-naked savages to pieces! Well, well, perhaps it's a good thing it's
  nothing more serious. The more chance of seeing you home safe and sound. Yes,
  I'll mess with you if you like, and if your mess will not mind an old fogie
  like me."</p>

  <p>He spoke lightly, for no one knew better than he that Colonel Devereux,
  V.C., would have been a welcome and an honored guest at the table of any
  regiment in Great Britain.</p>

  <p>"Give me your arm down these infernal stairs, Hugh," he said, rising and
  making his way to the door. "I have some commissions to do for Maud, and I
  want to see my lawyer, so I must be off. I'll be back before seven."</p>

  <p>I watched him cross the square, with his head thrown hack and his
  shoulders very slightly stooped, notwithstanding his seventy five years. Then
  I returned to my room to think over the great news.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-42"
     id="ch-42"></a>XLII. &mdash; A TRAITOROUS LOVE</h2>

  <p class="first">In three days we were to leave England. In three days I
  should be started upon the journey which would lead me into the land where,
  above all others, I desired to be. And, where was I? Standing on a Yorkshire
  moor, with a wild west wind blowing in my face and singing in my ears, a wind
  that came booming up the hollows and across the open country towards me like
  the sound of a cannonade within the earth. But what cared I for the wind, for
  was it not bearing towards me on its bosom her whom I had come to see?</p>

  <p>On she came like a phantom shadow out of the twilight, for her horse's
  hoofs sank noiselessly into the soddened earth. On she came with her golden
  hair streaming in the wind, and her habit flying wildly around her. Fair and
  proud as ever was her exquisite face, and blue as ever her flashing eyes. But
  it seemed to me that she was pale and thin, and my heart leaped with a sudden
  joy; and then stood still.</p>

  <p>Maud! my princess! my beloved! Would she see me? Would she pass me without
  a word, with only a tightening of those proud lips, and a haughty flash from
  those beautiful eyes?</p>

  <p>I had meant to look upon her and come away. There may be men who could
  have done it. I could not. As she came upon me, I stood out from the shadows
  upon the dark moor, and right in her path.</p>

  <p>Fool that I was! Back on his haunches reared the Black Prince, trembling
  with fright, and she&mdash;she must have fallen, but that I sprung forward
  and caught her. The Black Prince galloped away into the darkness, and she, my
  Maud, lay in my arms.</p>

  <p>A great madness came upon me. Every thought save one was blotted out from
  my memory. Maud was in my arms, with her face close to mine, and bending
  down, our lips met in one long, passionate kiss.</p>

  <p>"Hugh!"</p>

  <p>"Maud!"</p>

  <p>No sound but the sound of Black Prince's furious gallop as he tore across
  the country moor! No one in sight, no one near, I was alone with Maud, my
  Maud, by the color which had chased the ivory pallor from her cheeks, and the
  love-light which shone in her eyes. "Why have you kept away so long?" she
  whispered softly.</p>

  <p>Why had I come at all! His daughter in my arms yielding herself to my
  embrace, and her lips to my wild kiss! Oh, it was madness! I was a
  traitor.</p>

  <p>"I should not have come," I groaned, "but to bid you farewell. We sail for
  Egypt in three days. I struggled hard to keep away; but I could not."</p>

  <p>"Why should you wish to, Hugh?" she whispered, burying her face on my
  shoulder. "Do you hate me so much?"</p>

  <p>"Hate you!" I drew her unresistingly into my arms again, and again my
  traitorous lips touched hers. Never a thought of a miserable exile dwelling
  amongst a strange people in deadly peril under a scorching sun, or of a
  hermit sybarite with the blast of fame in his ears, and all the luxuries of
  wealth ready to his touch, and a black lie burning in his heart! Never a
  thought of any save of her! Weak traitor that I was.</p>

  <p>What is there so maddeningly sweet as to love and be loved again! The
  world died away from me and time ceased, whilst Maud, with her lovely face
  wet with tears, and happy with smiles, stood clasped in my arms on the wild
  open moor. The wind howled around us, and the driving rain and mist beat in
  our faces, and the twilight deepened into darkness; but what did we care! The
  only light I looked for was the gleam in her soft eyes, and the only touch I
  felt was the beating of her heart against mine. But the time came when memory
  swept again into my mind, and I trembled.</p>

  <p>She saw the change pass over my face, and with a woman's marvellous
  quickness she divined what had caused it. But she clung the closer to me.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, is this to be the end of it?" she cried. "When you leave me, will
  you never come back?" and I turned away with a great sob.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that you were another man's daughter, Maud!" and she was
  answered.</p>

  <p>Black clouds were driving across the sky, and a black cloud settled upon
  my heart. The words rang in my ears. Never come back!' Never come back! Never
  come back!</p>

  <p>A dark shape stole up to us, and stood by our side. Then there was a glad
  neigh and a prolonged snort. The Black Prince had recognised me, and was
  rubbing his nose against my coat-sleeve.</p>

  <p>"I must go, Hugh!" Slowly I lifted her in to the saddle, and stood by her
  side in silence because I could not speak.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, kiss me once more!"</p>

  <p>She stooped down and held a white, strained face close to mine. One
  clinging kiss I pressed upon her quivering lips, and then I drew aside. But
  as she rode away into the darkness, she called to me a wild sobbing cry,
  which the wind dashed into my ears.</p>

  <p>"Come back to me, Hugh, my love. You will come back to me," and scarce
  knowing what I did I answered her passionately:</p>

  <p>"I will! I will!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">We were together on H.M.S. <i>Orontes</i>, eastward bound,
  her father and I, but though we sat opposite one another at the captain's
  table, we never spoke. Sometimes I caught him looking at me wistfully, and
  then I remembered that I had saved his life. But I wanted no thanks for it,
  and from him I would receive none.</p>

  <p>"Queer lot those Devereux," I heard one of my brother officers remark,
  unconscious of my presence. "Uncle and nephew, and don't speak! Must be
  something wrong, I should think."</p>

  <p>"Looks like it. If the Colonel hadn't written that tremendously clever
  book, I should think he was a bit cracked."</p>

  <p>"Might be further from the mark, I think. The young 'un isn't such a bad
  sort, only he's so confoundedly proud and close. Most unsociable fellow we
  ever had in the regiment!"</p>

  <p>"He's a bit of a prig, I must say, but I don't dislike him. Splendid
  family, you know, and rolling in money. By the by," dropping his voice a
  little, "wasn't there something queer about one of 'em? This one's father, I
  believe?"</p>

  <p>"Hush! Yes, I'll tell you all about it presently;" and then they strolled
  up the deck, and I heard no more.</p>

  <p>Something queer about one of them! I turned away with the old pain at my
  heart. Would the something queer ever be made right? Yes, and the time was
  not far distant.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-43"
     id="ch-43"></a>XLIII. &mdash; EXPIATION</h2>

  <p class="first">Whether it was the stifling desert air or the anticipation
  of the morrow's battle, I cannot tell; but sleep for me was a thing
  impossible. We were encamped on the outskirts of a mighty plain and within an
  hour's march the Mahdi lay entrenched awaiting our attack. Outside my tent
  all was bustle and stir in preparation for the morrow's light, and a yellow
  moon was shining with a grim, ghostly, light upon our white tents, and the
  figures moving silently about.</p>

  <p>There were many other reasons why I should be restless. We were within a
  day's march, they could not be further away, and they might be nearer, of my
  father and Burton Leigh. Every day came tidings of the two white men on whose
  heads the Mahdi had set an enormous price, and who lived in deadly peril for
  fear of the treachery of their wavering friends, and to-morrow their fate
  would be decided, for if the tribe of the Asarees seceded to the false
  prophet and joined in the fight, then they were most surely doomed. But if,
  on the other hand, they held aloof from the fight, then would my father and
  Burton Leigh have succeeded in their daring mission, and would reach us in
  safety to be received as heroes.</p>

  <p>A shadow darkened my tent, and an orderly stood before me, saluting.</p>

  <p>"Colonel Devereux would like particularly to see you in his tent,
  sir."</p>

  <p>What could it mean! Neither word, nor glance had passed between us since
  we left England on board the same ship. I followed the man with beating
  heart.</p>

  <p>The vision of a man physically weak who, after a mortal struggle with some
  fiendish sin, has cast it from him and come out of the fight dying but
  triumphant, with a spiritual joy; it seemed to me that this was what I saw
  when I stood face to face with my Uncle Rupert. Ghastly pale, but firm, with
  deep lines suddenly engraven across his forehead, but with the light of a
  great calm resolution in his eyes, he stood before me, and I trembled, for
  strong and clear the conviction of the truth flashed upon me. The day for
  which. I had longed with such a sickening desire had come.</p>

  <p>"Hugh," he said, quietly, "to-night is my last on earth. People may scoff
  at presentiments who never feel them. Like a still whisper from another
  world, have heard the truth. In to-morrow's fight I shall die."</p>

  <p>I would have spoken, but it was impossible. The words stuck in my
  throat.</p>

  <p>"One word about this sin of mine, Hugh," he went on in a strange, calm
  tone, "it was done in a mad impulse of jealousy&mdash;in a moment of madness
  which a lifetime of misery has not expiated. Every one knows that I have been
  an unhappy man. Success and fame have only been glow-worms leading me on into
  a marsh of discontent. With a guilty conscience no man on earth can be
  happy!"</p>

  <p>He took up a roll of papers from a table by his side and summoned his
  servant.</p>

  <p>"Greasely, go to General Fielding's tent and tell him I am ready."</p>

  <p>I stood there still in silence. My uncle sank into a low chair and half
  covered his face. In less than a minute the opening to the tent was lifted,
  and our commander-in-chief, followed by a younger officer, entered.</p>

  <p>"Colonel Devereux," he said, kindly but promptly, "in accordance with my
  promise I am here, and I have brought Captain Luxton. I can spare you five
  minutes."</p>

  <p>Like a gaunt spectre my uncle came out from the shades of the tent, and
  his sad, weary tone moved even my pity.</p>

  <p>"Three will be sufficient," he said. "General Fielding, a quarter of a
  century ago you heard me commit perjury against my brother; and your father,
  Captain Luxton, pronounced the sentence. It is for this reason I have asked
  you to witness my confession. You have already read it."</p>

  <p>He took up his pen and signed the roll of paper. General Fielding and
  Captain Luxton immediately followed suit, and the former took possession of
  the document.</p>

  <p>"General Fielding," my uncle continued, with a voice that commenced to
  shake a little, "I am already your debtor, inasmuch as you permit me to
  retain my commission until after to-morrow's fight. But I ask you still
  another favor."</p>

  <p>The General bowed, and there was a decided gleam of compassion in his
  stern face.</p>

  <p>"Let this matter be cleared up immediately after to-morrow's fight. If my
  brother be found alive, which God grant that he may, let my confession be
  read in open court-martial, however informal, at once," he pleaded.</p>

  <p>"It shall be done. Luxton, we must be off. Gentlemen, good night."</p>

  <p>"We were alone, my uncle and I. His unnatural, calm seemed to be breaking
  up, and the look of agony on his face filled me with compassion&mdash;aye,
  compassion even towards him.</p>

  <p>"There is something still troubling you," I said quietly. "You are
  thinking of Maud."</p>

  <p>He looked at me wildly. I knew that I was right.</p>

  <p>"Maud's future will be in my hands," I told him in a low tone. "She loves
  me, and she will be my wife."</p>

  <p>At first he seemed dazed, then, as he began to realise my words, a great
  sob of relief shook him from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"And Francis," I added, after a short pause, "I will remember that he is
  my cousin&mdash;and my brother."</p>

  <p>He stood up like one who has passed through the Valley of the Shadow of
  Death, yet with a look almost of peace upon his spiritualised face.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, will you take my hand?"</p>

  <p>I took it, wrung it warmly, and left him. What more could I have done? He
  was better alone.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Like the sands of the desert before a fierce sirocco, the
  followers of the false prophet were flying far and wide. It had been a fierce
  fight. They had come down upon us like a whirlwind, with their lances
  gleaming like silver in the sunlight, and wild cries of "Allah! Allah!"
  bursting from their lips. But the maddening enthusiasm of fanatical zeal had
  quickly burnt itself out. We had driven them behind their trenches, only to
  carry them at the point of the bayonet and drive them out into the desert.
  The victory was complete.</p>

  <p>With my broken sword still in my hand, and my face streaming with blood
  and perspiration, I kneeled with wildly beating heart by the side of my
  father's prostrate body. For I had found him lying white and still at the
  bottom of one of the trenches, and&mdash;oh! the horror of it!&mdash;with a
  great gaping wound in his side.</p>

  <p>"My father! My father, speak to me!" I cried. "O God! if this should be
  death!"</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes slowly, and, dimmed though they were, he recognised me
  at once.</p>

  <p>"Hugh, Hugh, my boy. Thank God!" he faltered out.</p>

  <p>"You are wounded," I sobbed. "Are you in pain? Tell me, father."</p>

  <p>A spasm of agony passed over his face, but he answered me in a while.</p>

  <p>"My side&mdash;a spear-head. 'Twill soon be over."</p>

  <p>I passed my arm around him, and gazed into his face with streaming
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Father, you must live," I sobbed. "Rupert Devereux has confessed. All is
  known!"</p>

  <p>He nodded, and smiled faintly. "I know, Hugh. He was first over the
  trenches. They were murdering me. He fought like a devil. There they
  lie&mdash;five of them. He saved my life, and crawled here as he was
  dying&mdash;told me&mdash;everything. I forgave him. See."</p>

  <p>I looked around, and there, scarcely a yard away, lay my Uncle Rupert,
  with a calm peace in his white face, turned to heaven, which in life he had
  never known.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A strange scene. General Fielding, with a little crowd of
  officers around him, at one end of the tent, and a little distance away my
  father lying on a stretcher, with a surgeon on one side striving to stanch
  the blood which flowed from that hideous, gaping wound, whilst on the other I
  knelt clasping his hands and anxiously watching his face.</p>

  <p>General Fielding had done all in his power. He had read my Uncle Rupert's
  confession, and had formally rescinded the verdict of General Luxton. The
  black stain of dishonor no longer rested upon my father's name. But this
  greatest of joys had surely come too late; for the hand which I held
  passionately clasped in mine was growing colder and colder every moment, and
  the surgeon's face was very grave.</p>

  <p>"Is there hope?" I faltered out. But the doctor shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Very little, I fear," he whispered. "I am expecting hemorrhage every
  moment."</p>

  <p>A deep silence reigned in the tent, a silence which seemed ominously like
  the silence of death. Suddenly he reopened his eyes, and a feeling of
  sickening agony stole over me, for there was a deeper film than ever upon
  them.</p>

  <p>He smiled very faintly and struggled to speak, but the words died away on
  his lips. I bent closer still, and strove to catch his meaning.</p>

  <p>"Hugh&mdash;my&mdash;s&mdash;." The fingers of his right hand were moving
  nervously about, and I knew what he meant.</p>

  <p>"General Fielding," I said, standing up, with hot, burning eyes, and with
  a choking in my throat, "he wants his sword."</p>

  <p>The General stepped forward, and, unsheathing his own, held it by the
  blade, and my father's long fingers, trembling with eagerness, wound
  themselves around it. Then he sank back with a little satisfied gasp, and I
  knew that he was at rest.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-44"
     id="ch-44"></a>XLIV. &mdash; HERO</h2>

  <p class="first">I had kept my vow, for though I was again within the park of
  Devereux, and in sight of the grand old mansion, my father was by my side. A
  splendid constitution had saved him from the very jaws of death, and he had
  recovered to find his country ringing with his name, and himself a hero. Our
  journey had been like a triumphal progress. Distinguished men, amongst whom
  old General Luxton, had met us at London to welcome my father back to his
  country, and all the way down we had been besieged by newspaper reporters,
  and little knots of people were gathered on the platform at every station, to
  gaze at us and shout a welcome; and at the little wayside station such crowds
  of the country folk were gathered together that progress along the narrow
  winding lane was almost an impossibility. And now we were at the last sweep
  of the drive, surrounded by lines of shouting tenants and servants, who stood
  uncovered as we approached, and made the air vibrate with lusty Yorkshire
  cheers.</p>

  <p>It was one of those days which a man may live to be a hundred years old,
  and never forget; and yet it would dwell in his mind, less by its actual
  events than by the effect which it left. I remember a noble-looking,
  grey-haired old man standing out in the sunlight, with outstretched hands and
  a great joy in his face, and I remember a deep hush falling upon the
  assembled crowd as father and son met after so many years&mdash;a hush which
  lasted until they stood there, hand grasping hand, and the first words were
  spoken&mdash;then it gave place to a shout which seemed to shake the air.</p>

  <p>And I remember Maud's greeting&mdash;how could I ever forget it? Cold she
  was at first, cold but kind&mdash;after the manner of the days when I was
  Hugh Arbuthnot, a presumptuous boy. But when I told her of my interview with
  her father on the night before the battle, when I took her into my arms with
  words of passionate love and bade her recall our last parting, then she
  yielded and became my Maud, and mine she has been ever since.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Had I told this story of mine as a professed story-writer,
  there are many things now omitted which would in their proper place have been
  recounted. I should have said more of Marian, the happiest of young wives,
  and of the joy with which she welcomed us home. I should have told of Lady
  Olive's brilliant marriage to the Earl of&mdash;&mdash;, and of Francis
  Devereux's reformation and success at the bar, and of Burton Leigh's
  extraordinary reappearance in the world after having long been mourned as
  dead, and of my father's joy at meeting again his old companion. There are
  other things, too, which should have been told, but let them pass! One more
  incident alone shall I relate.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Again I stood in the grand old picture gallery of the Court,
  amongst the shades of many generations of Devereux. We three were
  there&mdash;Sir Francis, my father, and I; Sir Francis out of sight, my
  father and I bending over a curious piece of armor.</p>

  <p>Suddenly we both looked up. Out of the dark shades of the lower end of the
  chamber my grandfather was coming towards us, walking steadily down between
  the long rows of pictures, with measured military tramp and head thrown back.
  But we could see by his fixed gaze and the strange rapt look on his face that
  something was wrong, and almost simultaneously we sprang forward to him.</p>

  <p>We were just in time. Suddenly he threw up his arms over his head, and
  cried out with a loud voice: "It was a lie! It was a lie! Thank God, Herbert,
  my son! Hugh, my boy. God bless you both!"</p>

  <p>He sank back into my arms. And the moonlight, streaming in upon his face,
  showed it gentle and peaceful as a child's. Death struggle there was none.
  With a calm, satisfied smile of perfect happiness the life seemed to glide
  away from him, and with his last breath we heard him murmur softly:</p>

  <p>"Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace&mdash;in peace."</p>
