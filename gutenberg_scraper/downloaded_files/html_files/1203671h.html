POLE.</a></h2>
<br>
<h3>CHAPTER I.&mdash;MERELY INTRODUCTORY.</h3>
<p>Readers may remember the story told by an ancient mariner
which was published last November. This was an account of a
cruise which Capt. Reynolds, of New London, Conn., made in the
South Seas twenty-six years ago. This voyage, so far as the South
Seas were concerned, ended at the South Georgia Islands, where
the captain and his crew remained until driven out by the
ice.</p>
<p>These islands are situated exactly 1,000 miles east of Cape
Horn, with an oceanic current running directly from the southern
end of the American Continent to them. Here is the most beautiful
harbor in the world&mdash;the Cumberland. It is surrounded on
three sides by lofty mountains which rear their heads straight
upward 16,000 feet above the sea, and down whose sides five
cataracts flow. But wild and rugged as are those mountain peaks
and tempestuous as may be the ocean out beyond, no storms are
ever felt within the harbor, although looking upward the sailor
can see them raging around the mountain tops.</p>
<p>Resting on the bosom of the placid waters, his ship scarcely
moving by the gentle waves, with golden sunshine falling all
around, looking upward tornadoes, rain and snow will be seen
raging among the upper cliffs.</p>
<p>But there is another harbor on this island of quite a
different character.</p>
<p>Capt. Reynolds and his crew anchored in Frenchman's Bay and
there found a house built of ship's cabin timber, every inch of
which was carved with the history of four men, who had been lost
off Cape Horn and their vessel carried by the current to this
island. They had been lost twenty years before, and had lived in
this house for seventeen years, according to the records which
they carved upon its walls.</p>
<p>After the seal rookery had been visited, the captain organized
a volunteer investigation party to explore the interior. Coming
to the top of a mountain range, they let down John Sands, who was
lost in the Arctic Ocean on the ill-fated Narvach, to find a path
for them. He called back that he thought a way could be found,
but they had better leave the rope hanging in case they were
obliged to return by it. The whole party descended, but soon were
obliged to repeat the performance, and when they reached the
valley, half a dozen ropes were hanging down the mountain
side.</p>
<p>It was well they left them, for on examining the valley into
which they had descended, they found that it was walled in by
precipitous mountains, and that this one point upon which they
had stumbled by accident or by fate was the only place they could
be crossed. And if those ropes had not been left, they probably
would have died in that lonely place, for this cave was cut off
from the ocean, as well as from the rest of the island. All along
in front were breakers which rendered the approach of any boat
impossible. The beach was thirty miles wide and was strewn with
the wrecks of a thousand ships, which had been lost off Cape Horn
and drifted to this place with the current. Once in this cove, it
was impossible to leave it.</p>
<p>During the afternoon of the first day which the party passed
in this place, one of those thrilling occurrences which sailors,
in either the Arctic or Antarctic Oceans, are always on the
lookout for, happened.</p>
<p>As the little party of adventurous men were exploring the
valley, Capt. Reynolds saw in the distance what he thought was
the work of human hands, but whether it was the portion of a ship
which had escaped the anger of the breakers and been tossed up on
the shore, or was really a human habitation, he could not say.
But, approaching, they found that it was a hut, rudely and
imperfectly yet warmly constructed out of ship's timber. Many a
time, and in most unlikely places, had such habitations been
found by the crew during this cruise. The first thought of every
man was to examine and see if there was any one living in it,
although with but little hope, for if the four men who had been
cast in Frenchman's Valley could not survive, what chance could
there be for any one in this deserted spot?</p>
<p>And yet it was inhabited. As they drew near the cabin, a man,
bearing no evidence of starvation or of hardship, and with the
manners of a refined gentleman, came out and addressed them.
There was nothing in his conversation or his actions which would
indicate a shipwrecked man, or one pining in loneliness in that
solitary place.</p>
<p>On the contrary, he had the appearance of a man well satisfied
with his surroundings, and he greeted the men politely and
cheerily, but not with that joyous gratefulness which they were
accustomed to find in men rescued from such a situation.</p>
<p>He received their salutations there as coolly as if the
meeting had occurred in the center of civilization. They entered
his hut and he entertained them frugally, of course, but as
politely as if the meeting had been in New York.</p>
<p>Of course, their first inquiry was as to how he came there,
and from what ship he was lost, and to these queries he replied
briefly:</p>
<p>"My name is George Wilding. I was shipwrecked off Cape Horn a
year ago. Our ship was a whaler, homeward bound. Ten of us
escaped in the long boat, but I alone survived. After weeks of
drifting, my boat was thrown upon the reefs in front of this
cove, smashed to pieces, and I borne in to shore by the
tide."</p>
<p>This was all he told them then, but he afterward left this
record of strange adventure.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.&mdash;THE FIGURE OF A MAN.</h3>
<p>As to who I am, a very few words will be sufficient. Three
years ago I left a seaport town on the Atlantic Coast for a
whaling voyage in the South Seas. When in latitude 65, and almost
directly south of Cape Horn, our ship was wrecked, and after
various disasters I found myself alone in a boat drifting rapidly
southward. Icebergs could be seen in every direction, and on the
tenth day after the wreck I sighted one straight ahead which
appeared immovable and extending to the horizon on the east and
west. All day I floated in sight of this towering mass of ice,
each hour some feature of it growing more and more distinct,
until at last, as night came, I feared, with good reason, that my
frail boat would be dashed against it and I lost.</p>
<p>All that night I remained awake, watching the great mass as it
drew nearer and nearer, or rather as I drew nearer to it. But the
contact did not come that night. When morning broke I was still
at some distance from it, and could now see that instead of an
iceberg floating in the sea, it was all one solid mass, its cold
peaks of glittering ice towering mountain high before me.</p>
<p>In many places these peaks arose precipitously from the ocean,
against which the long billows broke themselves with steady
sweep. But here and there I could detect openings which had all
the appearance of bays, or inlets, into a continent of ice.</p>
<p>I managed to row into one of these, and found that the ice
sloped gradually down to the level of the water as on a beach. I
landed, and drawing my boat up, fastened it to a jagged piece of
ice, and started out upon an exploring expedition.</p>
<p>Climbing to the highest elevation, I found in front of me a
long, level plain of ice, extending as far as the eye could
reach, and I determined upon exploring it. So, returning to my
boat, I managed by pushing and hauling, to draw it far enough up
the sloping ice to be above the tide, and there left it in a sort
of cove, which was so shaped as to block it from slipping back
into the ocean and becoming lost. For I never dreamed but that I
would soon return to the boat, possibly for the purpose of rowing
out to some whaler which might drift into this latitude.</p>
<p>And yet I knew ours was the only ship which ever had come that
far south, and it was driven there by the storm. However, living
is hope in the human breast!</p>
<p>There was I, a thousand miles from any known land! Out of the
track of vessels. All alone on a great continent of ice, with
scarcely provision to last a week, and yet making fast my boat
for a return to an unknown ship which common sense should have
told me would never come.</p>
<p>Having then made my boat safe, I tied together a cask of water
and some provisions and started on my exploration, dragging them
over the slippery ice behind me. I chose my direction as nearly
south as was possible, for what reason or why I was moved to do
so I could not then have told, but I learned later. I had
traveled probably five miles, and the polar sun was sinking down
for a few hours, dip below the horizon, for this was the season
of long days and short nights, when I was startled by seeing far
ahead, in the dusky twilight, what appeared to be a rude hut.</p>
<p>Could it be that other unfortunates had been wrecked on this
part of the great iceberg? flashed through my mind. Anyway, I
resolved to push forward as rapidly as possible and see. Even
should I find no inhabitant, the hut would at least provide me
shelter and a chance for rest and sleep.</p>
<p>And here, the first of the strange happenings which occurred
to me in this strange land, was brought to my attention. I
plainly heard in my ears, as if some one standing close to me had
spoken, the words:</p>
<p>"Courage. Seek the house and all will be well."</p>
<p>Those who have seen the great fur coats and caps which Arctic
whalers wear, will readily understand how a person might slip up
near another from behind, or the side, without being seen, and I
turned around to look at the person who spoke. But, although I
turned completely around and surveyed all points of the compass,
I could see nothing but ice.</p>
<p>Not a living being of any kind was in sight.</p>
<p>At first I was overwhelmed with astonishment, then the
astonishment turned into gray fear.</p>
<p>"The cold and the trials and the weariness of the journey had
affected my brain," was the thought which came to me.</p>
<p>A few minutes came another shock which nearly completed the
work of terror the first had begun.</p>
<p>Ahead of me, not more than fifty paces, I saw the figure of a
man standing out clear and distinct against the boundless expanse
of white snow and ice.</p>
<p>But the next instant it was gone! It did not move from the
place it was standing, did not disappear behind a hillock of ice,
for the great plain was as smooth as a floor. It simply
disappeared.</p>
<p>I was so overcome with fear&mdash;not at any idea of ghost,
although sailors are notoriously superstitious&mdash;but from
fear that my mind was wandering. I was so overcome, I say, that I
stood stock still, and this exhibition of terror, I afterward
learned, was the means of saving me from seeing the apparition
again&mdash;a sight which, I believe, would have completely
crazed me. But although I saw nothing again, I heard the voice a
second time bidding me press on to the hut with all haste, and at
the same time, I cannot tell how, there came new strength in my
body and new vigor in my brain. I walked rapidly on, and within
half an hour reached the hut.</p>
<p>It was a veritable house that I saw as I drew nearer. But so
strange had been my journey that at no time would I have been
surprised to see it suddenly disappear from the icy plain and
leave nothing but a mound of ice to mark the goal of my
pilgrimage.</p>
<p>It was a small building, not more than 10x12 in dimensions,
but strongly built of logs, a fact which surprised me greatly, as
there certainly was no timber in that icy region.</p>
<p>The interior was comfortably fitted up with a bed, a table,
some chairs and a stove, in which a hot fire was burning. To the
latter I rushed and held my benumbed hands close to its
comfortable sides.</p>
<p>I tell you, after days of drifting on a stormy polar sea, and
a day's travel over frozen fields of ice, a fire is a rare
comfort.</p>
<p>After getting the chill off the outside of me, and my joints
loosened up a little, I took a more careful look at the cabin,
and then noticed that the table was laid for supper and that
there was only one plate. But this was no time for ceremony. The
man for whom the meal was provided would well excuse a
shipwrecked mariner for devouring it. I sat down with a clear
conscience and did so.</p>
<p>After my hunger was satisfied I sat thinking. It is a true
fact that a man seldom thinks until his animal wants are
satisfied. I mean, think in the common use of the word, which is
merely recalling memories. When he is in a tight place he
reasons. I am using these words now in the vulgar, not the
scientific sense.</p>
<p>So I sat thinking. The man whom I thought I saw must have been
the owner of this place and no doubt he had stepped behind some
icy hillock and so disappeared. But the words I heard? Well, I
was too tired to speculate upon them, and after waiting a decent
length of time for the owner of the hut to return, I threw myself
upon the bed and fell asleep.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.&mdash;I WISH TO TURN BACK.</h3>
<p>When I awoke, after ten hours of sleep, such as I had not
enjoyed for many a day, the cabin was as I had left it when I
turned in, except that the fire was burning low. Everything else
remained the same. No one had entered while I slept. Food for
breakfast I found in a cupboard behind the stove, and as I was
preparing my meal I saw a placard on the wall which I was quite
certain had not been there the night before. It read:</p>
<p>"This hut was erected for shipwrecked mariners. When you have
rested, travel due south."</p>
<p>That was all, but the meaning was plain. There must be people
living somewhere in this country. Hence I was on what many
geographers had supposed this great mass of ice to be&mdash;a
frozen continent.</p>
<p>But if there were people living on it, then some portion of it
cannot be covered with ice.</p>
<p>After preparing and eating a hearty breakfast, I set out for
the south, guided by my pocket compass, which, fortunately, I had
placed in the boat before we left the ship. I traveled ten hours
that day, and again came to a cabin which I entered and found
provisions for a meal. No one met me, and a second time I lay
down and slept. A similar placard was on the walls of this hut
also, directing me to continue my journey southward.</p>
<p>After five days of travel over the snow, I thought I could
notice a change in the atmosphere for the warmer, and in a couple
of days more saw unmistakable evidences of a change of climate.
By and by the snow and ice disappeared and bushes sprang up just
as I had found them doing in going south when exploring the north
polar zone, and coming down the shores of Alaska. And at regular
intervals, during all this journey, I found huts furnished with a
bed, a fire, provisions, and the usual placard.</p>
<p>One morning, after I had been traveling over ground, instead
of ice, for several days, a startling thing happened to me. I had
found my cabin, as usual, eaten and slept in it. But in the
morning, after breakfast, I was astonished to see a small slip of
paper lying on the table, where I had eaten a few minutes before.
I was quite certain it was not there while I ate, as I had sat at
the table for quite a while. Who, then, could have placed it
there? So far in my journey I had met no one, neither had I seen
any evidence of human beings. I opened the paper and found it was
a note, saying:</p>
<p>"At your next station you will meet a guide who will conduct
you to the city."</p>
<p>Very kind and hospitable of them, I thought to myself. And
from the wording of the note and the placards on the cabin walls
no doubt they are civilized.</p>
<p>The information that another day's journey would bring me, if
not to the end of my travels, yet at least to the beginning of
the end, and that I would meet with human beings, spurred me on
and I walked more rapidly than any previous day.</p>
<p>Queer things had happened to me during my brief sojourn to
this ice-bound continent, but a stranger event still was to
happen this day, an event which, perhaps, had much to do with
molding my life, perhaps the future of a great nation I was
approaching. Indeed, I am almost inclined to believe its effects
may possibly, as I was afterward told, be so far reaching as to
include the whole globe.</p>
<p>It is thus that at every turn in life the little things bear
in their turn incalculable results.</p>
<p>You will not have forgotten the man whom I saw for a moment
that first day on the summit of the iceberg, but who disappeared
so suddenly that I was feign to believe him an image of my
demented brain. You may remember, also, the voices which I heard
speaking to me in the awful silence of glittering ice and
infinite depths of sky. And the cottages, or huts, strung at
regular intervals in which I was fed by mysterious hands! But the
most mysterious of all to me was the finding of the note upon the
table, where, half an hour before, I knew it had not been. All
these were full of mystery, but the crowning mystery and, I may
add, crowning glory, came to me this last day of isolation.</p>
<p>When I had walked for probably five hours, and the landscape
was growing more and more like that of an inhabitable country,
with here and there struggling trees and shrubs, I saw in the
distance a human being&mdash;a woman.</p>
<p>She was standing still, out on the plain, which was now no
longer a field of ice, and looking toward the north. At first I
stopped in amazement, and then quickening my pace, hurried on
toward her. She remained motionless, as if awaiting my coming,
and when I approached to within a few rods, so that her face
could be distinguished, she smiled a welcome and lifted her hand,
as if beckoning me to her.</p>
<p>Let me pause here and describe this image, which, from that
moment, became my ideal of womanhood and which since then has
ever been enshrined in my heart.</p>
<p>She was tall. Not the tallest woman in the world I had ever
seen, but slightly above the common height. Her figure was
compactly built, with hips slender as a boy's and as graceful,
and with the bust rounded out in the curves of budding
womanhood.</p>
<p>As to her face! It was long and oval, but not with a high
brow. Her complexion clear pink and white, and her hair the
softest of dark brown, fine spun and floating. And her
eyes&mdash;not brown nor black nor blue, but of that clear gray
which are the most beautiful God ever made. They are so beautiful
that He entrusts them to but few, even of women.</p>
<p>I loved her from the first moment her face appeared to me on
that barren plain.</p>
<p>As I drew nearer to her she smiled again and said in a sweet
voice:</p>
<p>"Welcome to our land," and although it was the most
commonplace phrase, no music ever sounded sweeter in my ears. For
had her voice not been most musical and her face and form
perfection of artistic grace, these were the first human words I
had heard since the day of the shipwreck. The first human words,
I say, because those I heard out on the ice fields, coming from
no visible person, I could not reckon as human.</p>
<p>I never have been very forward with women&mdash;on the
contrary, rather diffident&mdash;but I felt no bashfulness with
her. Instead, I rapidly stepped up to her side and asked her one
question after another as to where I was and what land I was
approaching, all of which she answered, still smiling my heart
into her own keeping.</p>
<p>"I am Winnifred, and you are approaching the city of Theon,
the capital of the state, and will reach it to-night. You are now
in the borderland between the state and the land of the ice.
Follow me. I came to lead you."</p>
<p>We walked along after that side by side, she plying me with
questions as to my journey across the ice, although even then I
had an impression that she was doing so merely to hear me talk,
rather than because she did not know every detail of it already.
I noticed, also, that while she talked with me freely and with
perfect ease, she kept, with what I considered needless prudery
at the time, several feet away, and never allowed me to approach
near enough to touch her.</p>
<p>After we had traveled together for an hour or more, we came to
the summit of a range of mountains which sloped gently downward
to a great, level plain, filled with luxuriant vegetation, and in
the center of which stood as fair a city as ever I set eyes upon.
This mountain range appeared circular in shape, surrounding the
plain on all sides, except that far to the south there appeared
on the horizon what looked like the ocean.</p>
<p>Noticing my expression of wonder, she explained:</p>
<p>"You are looking down into the land which surrounds the south
pole, and which contains the oldest nation on the face of the
earth. So old is it that all of art and science which man has
ever been able to think out is there treasured. And it is as you
suspect, surrounded by a wall of mountains, and then of eternal
ice. And the water which you see in the distance is really a
great inland sea, salt as the ocean, although seemingly entirely
cut off from it. Yet it is not cut off. There is a small outlet,
that is, small compared with the great ocean outside, where the
water passes in and out underneath a glacier which towers miles
high and from which are continually dropping the giant icebergs
which float in the southern seas."</p>
<p>"Winnie, Winnie," I repeated half to myself, as we stood
looking down upon the fair valley below. "What a pretty name. But
it is so English that I am surprised. Are some of the inhabitants
of this country of yours descended from the English?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no," she replied, looking at me with her gray eyes in a
way which made my heart beat faster. "You will find all
nationalities represented here in names, for, as I told you, we
combine all of art and learning of all ages of the world. That
surprises you, does it not? You will understand it when you have
been with us a few days. My name was chosen for me by my mother
because she fancied it as a quaint old-fashioned name in an
English book she was reading when I was born."</p>
<p>At this moment I drew nearer and attempted to take her hand in
mine. I did grasp it, but when I did so found I was clasping
empty air.</p>
<p>I stepped back in horror. Was this a land of ghouls that I had
come to? She stood for a moment looking at me at first in
surprise and then in sorrow, and then faded quickly from my
sight.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;MORE CONFUSED THAN EVER.</h3>
<p>When the figure of the girl who had been walking and talking
but a moment before disappeared, I will confess that I was
afraid. Imagine a shipwrecked man who had drifted for days on an
angry ocean, who had climbed icebergs and traveled over ice
fields for days, who had heard mysterious voices, been
mysteriously provided with food and shelter, seen that which he
could explain in no other way than as spirit, who had received
notes in places where no human hands could have placed them. A
man alone in a mysterious land which civilized portions of the
globe had not believed to exist.</p>
<p>What could the strongest man, under such circumstances, do but
stand in fear and anguish? What was this strange land; was it the
entrance to the infernal regions, or peopled with shades of the
departed? Or was I losing my mind and imagining all these
things?</p>
<p>The latter I rejected after the first thought, for the food
and the lodging were too substantial for me to have dreamed them.
And the first was almost as unreasonable, for with whatever this
land was peopled they certainly had no evil intention toward
me.</p>
<p>I stood there on the summit of the mountain range for half an
hour meditating upon these strange things and turning over in my
mind what to do. To turn back I was most strongly inclined, but
there was something which drew me down the valley. What that was
I could not say then, although I learned afterward. In spite of
prospective dangers and mysteries, I felt impelled to proceed
instead of going back.</p>
<p>Step by step I went down the valley, noting at almost every
step new indications of a different clime. Vegetation began to
spring up and the air assumed a softer temper. Animals and birds
could be seen, flowers appeared, and as I descended farther I
came to cattle grazing and fields of grain and corn.</p>
<p>As I reached the last descent before coming into the valley,
or down to the plain, I saw a man approaching, a man who seemed
in figure strangely like the one I saw for a brief time out on
the ice fields, and I will confess to a feeling of fear again.
But this time there was no disappearance. We gradually drew near
each other until within hailing distance, when he called out in a
cheery voice in English telling me to hasten and bidding me
welcome. But while I did not stop, yet I did not hasten, and I
viewed him with ill-concealed suspicion until he reached out and
grasped my hand in a hearty handshake.</p>
<p>Then I realized that whatever mysterious experiences I had
gone through I had met at last a human being, and then&mdash;all
the strength which had held me up for days gave way and I sank
down upon the ground and cried. Yes, cried. And any one else
would have done the same thing under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>"Poor fellow," I heard the stranger saying in a sympathetic
voice. "The strain has been too great upon him," and he walked a
little ways from me until I recovered myself. Then he
returned.</p>
<p>"Never mind, my friend. You have had a hard time of it, but we
will soon be at home, where you can rest. You shall go direct to
my house and remain in absolute seclusion until you are
thoroughly yourself again, which I do not believe will be many
days."</p>
<p>"But where am I? What is this country? We never believed there
were human beings around the south pole."</p>
<p>"You are really in an inhabited country, and you will find it
equally as attractive as your own, I hope. But it may be as well
for us to talk of these things later. Come, let us go home."</p>
<p>I arose and with him continued my journey for half an hour
more, when we came to a mansion in the center of a well-kept
park. We entered the house and proceeded at once to a large,
comfortable bed chamber, where he left me, saying:</p>
<p>"You had better lie down for a while. I will have some
refreshments sent to you," and with these words withdrew.</p>
<p>That hour of rest I can never forget, although it was
disturbed by many queries as to my surrounding. Have you ever
gone through a long mental strain, of fear, of danger, of
expectation? And then, when all was over, how peaceful was the
relaxation! I gave myself up to the enjoyment of it; lay back
upon the couch and rested, gazing idly out at the branches of the
trees in the park gently swaying with the breeze.</p>
<p>A servant entered with a lunch and a strong cup of coffee, and
after I had eaten and drank he returned again with a suit of
clothes of American cut which fitted me very nicely. And again at
the end of an hour, when my host supposed I was sufficiently
rested, the same servant appeared and invited me to descend to
the parlor, which I did.</p>
<p>It was a quietly, comfortably furnished room, with a curtain
suspended across the entrance to another, and as I stood in the
center surveying the apartment the curtains parted and Winnie,
the beautiful figure I had seen that afternoon, appeared between
them.</p>
<p>She was smiling as when I first saw her out on the barren
plain, and came forward with hand extended to greet me. But
noticing that I drew a step back and, as she afterward told me,
that my face grew pale, she cried out in a cheery voice:</p>
<p>"Will you not allow me to welcome you to our home? I am
Winnifred, your host's daughter," and coming close to me took my
hand in hers.</p>
<p>I could say nothing, only looked at her in astonishment. There
could be no doubt but this was the exact image of the girl I had
seen on the barren mountain plain, and I defy any man not to have
been completely nonplussed under the circumstances.</p>
<p>"Are you not satisfied that I am I? and that you see very
flesh and blood?"</p>
<p>"But," I stammered, "this afternoon I saw some one so like you
that I thought for a moment that you were she."</p>
<p>"Ah. You have been meeting ladies already, have you? Tell me
who this one was. What was her name? Where did you meet her? And
was she really anything like me?"</p>
<p>"The exact image, and she told me her name was Winnifred."</p>
<p>"That is strange. I must inquire who this double of mine is,"
and she laughed it off quite sweetly, although the laugh was the
same as my Winnie's of the afternoon.</p>
<p>"But which of the two do you like the better?" she asked after
a moment.</p>
<p>"My Winnie of the afternoon," I replied. "But you are so near
alike that I will always confound you."</p>
<p>She looked thoughtful at this, but at the same time pleased,
and said:</p>
<p>"I like your answer, and some day may tell you why."</p>
<p>And that also puzzled me.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V.&mdash;ENTIRELY EXPLANATORY.</h3>
<p>Of course I was all on the qui vive until I could have a
private talk with my host, whose name I had learned was Costa,
and hear from him, if he would give it, an explanation of the
mysterious country in which I had landed. For by this time I had
given over all idea of fear. There was a soothing presence in the
very atmosphere about me, and I could not believe that any harm
was meant me. And yet all these mysterious events called for an
explanation.</p>
<p>Consequently the next morning I took advantage of a quiet hour
in which we were walking through the park, smelling the fragrance
of the trees and flowers, that I asked him:</p>
<p>"Mr. Costa, will you please relieve me from this suspense
which you must know is weighing upon me, and tell me where I am
and who you are?"</p>
<p>He smiled at the question, but replied:</p>
<p>"Yes. I think you are so far recovered from your terrible
experiences in shipwreck and crossing the ice land, that I may.
To be brief and to the point, you are on the South Polar
continent&mdash;a land I know your geographers have often
conceived, but have believed uninhabited, even if it really
existed, which the most learned of them doubted. What you want to
know next, is how you were rescued. I will tell you.</p>
<p>"Every now and then ships have ventured or been blown by storm
to our part of the world, and occasionally some of the mariners
have ventured upon the icebergs. To save them we have established
outposts along the edge of the icebergs, houses where men, such
as you, may find shelter, till we can rescue them."</p>
<p>"But do you keep fires burning continually in them? If not,
who lights them? And how is it that I never saw the attendant who
looked after my wants?"</p>
<p>"I see, Mr. Wilding, that I must enter into my explanation
more deeply than I had intended at first, hoping to wait a few
days and let the information gradually sift into your mind, until
you should learn more of us and our manners by observation.</p>
<p>"My daughter told you you were in a land where all art and
science of the world was treasured. If you are a student your
mind will at once revert to Egyptian and Assyrian learning, which
is supposed to have been lost. It was lost to the outside world,
but treasured up here. Your mind will dwell upon the ages when
man, looking up into the deep, clear blue sky, studied God's work
in them. You may think of Joseph, the dreamer. You may think of
the stars and their influence upon man."</p>
<p>"I don't believe they have any," I replied.</p>
<p>"We will let that pass," he said with a smile. "This is merely
incidental anyway. I do not mean to tell you of a star gazing or
a dream explaining people, only to remind you that there was a
high civilization in the past which vanished from the knowledge
of your races in other climes.</p>
<p>"Coming further down the history of nations you will recall
the Hindoos, the people who 'think,' who withdraw themselves into
themselves and spend long years in meditation. You have heard
that they have power to do queer things&mdash;almost
miracles.</p>
<p>"They can. This is nothing but the power of thought&mdash;of
mind. The man who thinks is able to do all things. For mind is
supreme. God is mind. The more freedom, the more power you
develop in mind, and the nearer you are to God. That
is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That is?" I repeated.</p>
<p>He passed over my repetition and continued:</p>
<p>"If morality is considered also, soul power is developed by
purity."</p>
<p>He said this as if he were reverently quoting from the Bible.
And I afterward learned that this strange people considered
purity as one of the essentials of man as well as woman, and
practiced it.</p>
<p>"But," I exclaimed, "you tell me nothing of the strange things
which have happened to me in this strange land. Pardon me, but I
do not see the connection between your remarks on mind and morals
and my being fed and warmed on an iceberg. It does not tell me
where I am and who you are."</p>
<p>"You are in the land of Theos. In the suburbs of the capital
city of Theon. I am the 'Costa.' There you have your answer." He
stopped as if he proposed to leave me in darkness if he was not
allowed his own way of explaining.</p>
<p>"But I heard voices."</p>
<p>"Yes, you heard voices, or rather one voice&mdash;mine.</p>
<p>"I was the guard, if so you choose to call it&mdash;I who was
on guard watching for shipwrecked mariners from the ship which
was storm tossed upon our shores.</p>
<p>"I saw you out on the ocean. I saw your boat driven toward a
certain part of our coast and made ready for you. It was I who
lighted the fires and who warned you which way to travel to reach
the nearest hut."</p>
<p>"Why did you never appear to me?"</p>
<p>"I did once, and it caused such fright in you that I never did
so again."</p>
<p>"But the voices, you seem to know I heard them, as you say the
words were from you. How could you speak and I not see you? Were
you hidden any place near? But the voices seemed at my very ear.
You have not explained the mystery yet? How could you speak and I
not see you? How could you attend to my wants, light my fires and
cook my suppers and I not see you?"</p>
<p>"Yet I was ever close by your side. I spoke to you. I was your
guard."</p>
<p>"Then you must be a spirit," I fairly shouted.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am," he calmly replied.</p>
<p>After a moment he continued, having seen the effect his remark
that he was a spirit had made upon me.</p>
<p>"Every man is spiritual as well as physical. He has both the
eternal and the mortal in him. Could the spirit but secure
control over the mortal it would be free. By long years of study,
of culture and privation, men in your lands have secured this
freedom from the body. We, in a sense, inherit it. Have you never
heard of those wise men of all ages, who, at the present time, so
far as your people know, are confined to the thoughtful Hindoo
race? Have you never heard of those inhabitants of India, who,
after long study and privation, have been able to separate their
souls from their bodies, and send them wheresoever they
will?"</p>
<p>I had heard some such stories, although I never had believed
them, and I told him so.</p>
<p>"What those few men can do," Costa replied, "we do. You have
come to a nation of men and women, adepts in all the intricacies
of the occult sciences. We have gained such power over our bodies
that we can leave them at any time and in our astral bodies fly
in an instant of time to any quarter of the globe. Many of those
adepts of India visit us and are visited by us in return. It is
as easy, nay easier, than a journey in one of your ships which
any storm may wreck. No storm ever wrecks the soul of the mahatma
in its flight.</p>
<p>"Are you not gaining any idea of the land to which you have
come? It is a land of theosophists, a land in which each
inhabitant possesses greater power than those few men we have
spoken of. Why? Because we and our forefathers have been
studying, learning, practicing for centuries, yea, for centuries
before the present history of man evolved itself from Myth,
according to your feeble reading of history. It is but the work
of a moment to disconnect the soul from the body and allow it to
wander at will through space. This is why we are able to watch
over and save you.</p>
<p>"When in one of my astral flights I saw your ship beaten by
the storm and drifting this way, I paused to watch your course,
as in your small boat you drifted against the icy guardians of
our land.</p>
<p>"We are a people of mercy, else we could not retain our power.
A selfish man gives hostages to the flesh and loses in spiritual
power. I saw you land upon the icy coast and at once, by the
odylic force which each of us possesses, kindled the fires in the
hut for you. Then, still in my astral body and invisible, I drew
you toward it, whispering in your ear words of encouragement and
advice. Then, when you were safe in the first hut and in
condition to make your way unaided to our land, I left you and in
an instant was in my home."</p>
<p>"And did you tell them of my coming?"</p>
<p>"Tell them of your coming? There was no need, for was I not in
constant communication with them?"</p>
<p>"In communication with them? How could that be? There was no
one to carry a message, and surely you have no telegraph across
those icy fields?"</p>
<p>Costa smiled.</p>
<p>"Have I talked so vainly? Or is the thought so foreign to you
that you cannot grasp it? What can fly swifter than thought? What
is more powerful in the universe than mind? Then how could man
have better means for communicating with another than when his
soul, freed from his body, is left at liberty to exercise all its
power untrammeled?"</p>
<p>"When I returned home we watched your course, and at the last
hut in which you slept, projected a note which fell upon your
table and told you that would be your last stopping place."</p>
<p>"And the placards?" I gasped.</p>
<p>"Projected in the same manner."</p>
<p>"Then my daughter, Winnifred, who had taken a great interest
in your journey, wished to become your guide the rest of the way,
to make your acquaintance as it were, and I consented that she
should project her astral body to the borderland and conduct you
to our home. But you, you touched her notwithstanding all her
precaution, became frightened and she was obliged to leave you.
Then, so great was your fear, I believe you would have turned
back had I not exercised my will to draw you onward."</p>
<p>"That, then," I muttered, "was the force that drew me on."</p>
<p>"Yes. Then I met you in the flesh, reassured you and conducted
you home."</p>
<p>"Then it was really your daughter who met me on the barren
plain? But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But what?" he asked smiling, as I hesitated.</p>
<p>"But I understood her to say it was not she who so met
me."</p>
<p>"Did she really deny it?"</p>
<p>"No," I replied after considering. "She did not in so many
words, but at least she gave me that impression."</p>
<p>"Sometimes it is necessary to veil the truth for a moment
until the pupil is strong enough to bear it. Had she acknowledged
her identity last night when you met at my house the effect upon
you might have been disastrous. A falsehood is a great crime. But
under the circumstances I connived at the concealment of the
truth. It was nothing more."</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI.&mdash;I GO HUNTING.</h3>
<p>During my visit I had noticed that every day we were
bountifully supplied with fresh fish and game, and one day,
commenting upon its excellent quality, asked my host if he never
indulged in the fascinating sport of angling or hunting. The
blank look of astonishment with which he received my question,
and replied that such work was left to the servants, surprised
me, and I changed the subject. However, a few days later I
broached the subject to Manuel, the servant who supplied the
table from the market, and stated that I would like to go out
fishing some day, if he would tell me where would be a good
place. He also looked astonished, but not so much from the fact
that I wished to go fishing as that I should ask where a good
place could be found.</p>
<p>"Any place where there is water," he replied, "but, of course,
the work is more difficult where there are no fish than when you
go to a place where they are plentiful." And he readily made
arrangements for me to accompany a fisherman the next day.</p>
<p>We started with a fish basket, and I supposed my companion
would secure lines and bait or a net as we went through the town,
but he did not, and then I conjectured that there was some one on
the seashore who made a business of providing them. But in this
also I was mistaken.</p>
<p>At the seashore he sat down upon a rock and fell into what I
took for a very peculiar fit of absent-mindedness, as he said not
a word, neither did he make any attempt to begin fishing. In the
meantime, I walked up and down the shore in some
astonishment.</p>
<p>After sitting in this position for some time he arose, and,
wading out into the water for a short distance, picked up a fine
fish with his hand. It must have weighed about ten pounds, and
was what I would have called a small-mouthed bass at home.
Throwing it up on the bank, he picked up another, and still
another, until he had enough to fill the basket. Then he waded
out and announced that we would return.</p>
<p>So puzzling was his whole demeanor that when I reached home I
sought my host and eagerly asked him for an explanation. He
seemed surprised at first, but, smiling, replied:</p>
<p>"Your pardon, my friend. I forgot that you did not understand
many of our ways. We are so accustomed to them that I forgot.
When we need fish for food we send our servant to get them,
because it is considered beneath us to do that kind of work."</p>
<p>"But I want to know why and how he picked up those fish with
his hands, as if it was the most common thing in the world."</p>
<p>"He did as all do when fish is needed for food. He went out,
sat down on the seashore and hypnotized the fish. When they are
near it is an easy matter, but when they are at a distance the
work is difficult, and sometimes he is away half a day before he
can fill his basket."</p>
<p>"I do not understand."</p>
<p>"He hypnotizes them. Gets them under the influence of his
will, compels them to come to shore, when he picks them up."</p>
<p>This was quite a puzzle to me for several days, but at last I
began to understand both what my host told me and also how the
fisherman caught his fish with neither net nor hook.</p>
<p>In connection with this I might mention a similar incident
with regard to hunting. When at home I had been fond of this kind
of sport, and whenever on land took a trip through the woods for
squirrels and along the waterways for water fowl. This may seem a
queer pastime for a sailor, but for thirty years I was a landsman
and during that time acquired a love for sports which any number
of years on the seas would never take away.</p>
<p>Consequently after being in Theon a few weeks and becoming
fully rested and restored to health, my old longing returned. But
by this time I knew that it would be accounted, if not sacrilege,
at least a very low down enjoyment, to go out hunting with my
guns, even if they would be of any use, so I decided merely to go
along with a hunter of the country and watch his manner of taking
game.</p>
<p>Arrangements were made this time by my host, who was
thoughtful, and after the fishing episode, remembered that I was
desirous of learning all the ways of the country. He even went a
short distance with us and honored us by bringing down a fine
partridge himself. I call it a partridge because that was what it
looked most like, but the natives gave it an entirely different
name.</p>
<p>As upon the fishing occasion, we took with us nothing but a
bag for carrying the game, and as we went along my host explained
to me as he did with regard to the fish, that none but the lower
classes made a living in this manner. When they acquired a
greater degree of will power they gave it up and entered upon a
more honorable business. This, he explained, was because it was
easier to work upon animals than intelligent human beings.</p>
<p>After walking out of the city about a mile we stopped and sat
down under a tree bearing a resemblance to our oaks. Here my host
and the hunter immediately fell into an abstracted condition and
at the expiration of about five minutes I observed a well made
hare approaching us. It stopped within a rod, and the hunter,
after making a few passes with his hands, caught it. After
killing it he placed it in the bag and sat down for more
game.</p>
<p>At this point my host, who had in the meantime brought down a
very fine specimen of wild turkey, asked me if there was any
particular animal I would like to have caught. After thinking it
over a little I expressed a desire to secure a specimen of native
monkeys which I had seen springing from tree to tree over our
heads. This desire, I explained, was not from a wish to taste
monkey flesh, but to tame the animal. My host replied:</p>
<p>"You have asked me to do an almost impossible thing. The
monkey is one of the most intelligent of the lower animals. At
first, centuries ago, our records tell us many of them were
caught, but after a time they began to combat our will power with
their own, and now have become almost impervious to our efforts.
However, I will make a trial. In fact, it would be quite a
triumph over the lower animals if I could secure one, and so I am
very glad to make the attempt, knowing there will be no disgrace
in failure."</p>
<p>This speech greatly interested me, and I asked:</p>
<p>"Are there any other animals which thus combat your superior
intelligence?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied my host, "there are several. One species of
bear has developed its will power until it is rare that we ever
ensnare one. However, they have become so much under our
influence that there is no danger from them. While we cannot
compel one in the wild state to come to us, yet the mental force
has proven so great that if one meets us face to face we are able
to exert enough influence to keep it from harming us."</p>
<p>With this he stopped talking and concentrated all his efforts
upon one sprightly little monkey which he pointed out skipping
from branch to branch over our heads and chattering as if all the
gossip of a sewing society had to be retailed before we got
away.</p>
<p>"Please note that one," my host said, "for while I cannot say
that I have much hope of bringing it down, yet I expect to exert
some influence over it, and you may be interested in noting the
effect."</p>
<p>We then remained silent, and I kept pretty close watch upon
the animal. Soon its chatter grew less and it became more quiet
in its movements.</p>
<p>"That," said my host, "is the first step in monkey
hypnotism&mdash;to get it to stop talking. And I might observe it
is the same in affecting the human mind. The first step with a
chatterbox is to get it to stop its chatter. Just what connection
there is between this and the intellect you may figure out
yourself. But the conclusion is quite evident. Mesmerism works on
the brain and you must get the brain to work on first."</p>
<p>Again he lapsed into silence and I watched the monkey. Its
chatter ceased entirely and it became motionless. But at this
stage the other monkeys to whom it had been talking noticed the
change and gathered around it. At first they had paid no
attention to its silence; for even a monkey does not talk all the
time. But when it ceased talking entirely they knew something was
wrong, and being aware, of course, of our presence, suspected
that one of us was working upon their companion. At first they
chattered to him and, gaining no answer, at length fell upon him
tooth and nail and gave him such a pulling as no monkey could
stand and not resist. He resisted. He fought. His friends made it
a running fight, and in this way our victim was drawn away. My
host's mind could have worked at any distance, he explained to
me, and at another time he might continue the experiment even
after his victim had disappeared, but just now he had an
engagement in the city and was obliged to leave. He also
explained that in such cases absence from sight was a
disadvantage, as one was obliged to bring mesmerism into play
also.</p>
<p>After my friend left I paid more attention to the hunter who
already had his game bag half full. On our way home he told me
that hunters were examined once a year as to their fitness for
the work, and were appointed to the position by the government.
They had rules and regulations as we have in our country and
which we call game laws. Thus a hunter is obliged to hunt so many
hours a day and so many days a week to supply the patrons who are
allotted to him, the whole city being divided into districts. If
he should fail to secure the required amount of game in that time
he was known to be failing in power and was censured, and if his
decline continued, was degraded to some more menial work. But
this rarely happened, as the exercise of the will power, like the
exercise of the muscle, causes it to grow so that hunters
frequently graduate into higher trades. Fishermen were of a lower
grade, as were some classes of shepherds. Those who had care of
sheep were of the very lowest class, it requiring very little
brain to control and keep them in bounds. On the other hand, a
herder of cattle or hogs was of higher class, as requiring more
brain power, and ranked next below the hunters in point of
intelligence.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII.&mdash;A SOUTH POLAR WEATHER BUREAU.</h3>
<p>A few days after my fishing and hunting excursions some one
spoke of a trip to an island about ten miles from Theon, which
was described as very beautiful by a young man whom I had met
several times, and I expressed a desire to visit it.</p>
<p>Or, no, was it I or the young man whom I just mentioned?
Judging from what I learned afterward I am now half inclined to
think it was his suggestion.</p>
<p>This young fellow, who was known by the euphonious name of
Buda Earn, was a handsome fellow, clean built and pleasant in his
manners. He had been extremely agreeable to me at all times and
evinced a great interest in my welfare. Consequently I was
surprised to see that both Costa and his daughter seemed at all
times averse to our intercourse.</p>
<p>When the subject of visiting this island was broached I was
eager to go, and at first it seemed as if my desire would be
gratified. But after a moment's consideration Mr. Costa said:</p>
<p>"It would be a delightful trip, but really, we have no way, on
the spur of the moment, of getting there, and will have to
postpone the trip a few days."</p>
<p>"Will not your boat hold me as well as you?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"Not the boat we travel in," he replied with a smile. "Do you
know, Mr. Wilding, that there is not a boat, a railroad or a
carriage in this whole country?"</p>
<p>"Do you never travel about? But of course you do, for you have
just been speaking of taking a trip to this island. Really, Mr.
Costa, you talk in enigmas."</p>
<p>"After all I have explained to you!" he exclaimed in mild
reproach. "Pause and think, my friend. What need have we of
carriages or railroads? When we wish to take a journey, we step
into our bed chamber, lock the door to prevent intrusion and
possible disaster, lie down on our couch and project our astral
body whithersoever we wish. Now, if it were not for you, we would
each do this and, in a second of time, gather upon that
delightful island where I and my family have passed many a happy
day. By the way, Winnie, did you send that message to Ackra?"</p>
<p>"No, father, I was so busy that I did not get time to do
so."</p>
<p>"Never mind now. I will send a letter instead. My agent must
have it this morning."</p>
<p>Now I had heard that Ackra was fully sixty miles from Theon
and was curious to know what my host meant by sending a letter,
after telling me there was no such thing as railroads. Perhaps,
however, he meant a telegram. So I asked:</p>
<p>"But you have the telegraph here, I suppose, or you could not
communicate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>He looked at me as a master might at a very dull pupil with
whom he wished to be indulgent.</p>
<p>"Again, Mr. Wilding, again? Have you forgotten your experience
on the ice fields and the messages sent to and from them? This is
a land of no telegraph, for the simple reason that we need none.
When we wish to communicate with friends or business connections
in distant cities we merely fix our minds upon the message to be
sent and it is at once transmitted and impressed upon the mind of
the one for whom it is meant."</p>
<p>"But you spoke of a letter."</p>
<p>"Yes, and to explain to you our primitive postal system I will
send one now. I wish to communicate with one of my agents in
Ackra. If you will excuse me for a moment I will write it." And
seating himself at a desk he wrote for a few minutes and then,
turning to me, said:</p>
<p>"Here is a note I have just written to my agent asking him to
come to Theon to-morrow on a matter of business. We will receive
an answer in a few minutes, as I know he is always at his office
at this time of day and will receive my note at once."</p>
<p>So saying, he arose and, holding the letter lightly in one
hand above his head, stood in silence. I watched him closely out
of curiosity, for I thought he was acting strangely. He stood
there for a moment and then&mdash;the letter disappeared.</p>
<p>"There, it is gone," he said, sitting down. "In five minutes
we should have an answer."</p>
<p>Then we chatted together about a variety of things and I had
nearly let the incident slip from my mind when a note fluttered
down from I know not where, and fell at his feet.</p>
<p>"Ah, there it is," he said, opening it. "Yes, he will be here
to-morrow," and passed the note to me. It was not in Costa's
handwriting.</p>
<p>The agent really did appear the next day and I met him,
although Mr. Costa warned me not to approach near or attempt to
touch him. From which I gathered that his visit to us was made in
his astral body.</p>
<p>A land without railroad and without telegraph and yet where
business was carried on as rapidly as in my own land. No
conveyances because people had no need of them. Messages were
sent swifter than by electricity, for what can fly faster than
one's thoughts? Notes were projected by some mysterious force to
their destination, even though it were miles away. I alone was
isolated and cut off from communication with the rest of the
world.</p>
<hr class="short">
<p>It was decided that by the third day a boat could be built to
make the trip to the island, and that day being fixed upon for
the excursion, Winnie asked the next morning before the agent
arrived:</p>
<p>"Father, have you noticed what kind of weather we will have
that day? It would never do to start out on a pleasure excursion
and have it rain."</p>
<p>"Yes, dear," Costa replied, "I looked last night. It will be a
fair day."</p>
<p>I smiled at their childlike trust in the weather prophet, and
said:</p>
<p>"So you have almanacs and weather prophets in this country,
too?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he replied. "We could do nothing without our weather
bureau."</p>
<p>"Do you really believe that they can predict the kind of
weather you will have on a certain day?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, certainly not," Costa replied. "They do not predict. They
make the weather."</p>
<p>"Make the weather?" and I laughed, thinking he meant his
remark as a joke.</p>
<p>"Yes," he continued, quite seriously. "Our weather bureau has
quite different duties from those in your country. There they
study conditions and predict what may possibly come. Here the
bureau is composed of the strongest minds in the nation, and
their duty is to decide upon the proper kind of weather for
certain seasons and days and then see that the country has
it."</p>
<p>My smile at his speech was so pronounced that he could not
help noticing my skepticism and entered into an explanation.</p>
<p>"The matter is quite simple and entirely in line with
theosophy. The human mind can control the elements, bring storm
or sunshine as it wills. Hence our bureau is chosen with direct
reference to ability of mind. It decides upon the proper kind of
weather for certain seasons, and all is worked out with
mathematical precision. For instance, we have found that a
certain amount of rain is necessary for growing crops. The ground
should have sufficient moisture in it before planting and then at
regular intervals thereafter rain should fall if the crop is to
be a success. We have no droughts as in your land, where it may
be a month or two before rain falls. Our bureau looks over the
country, learns what kind of grain is to be grown in different
sections, and decides upon the amount of rain needed for the
sections. Another point in our favor. Sometimes your lands are
swept by hot winds just as the grain is ripening. We never allow
them here. You can see the benefit of such a system. We wish to
go upon a pleasure excursion day after to-morrow, and I had but
to look in the report of our weather bureau to learn whether the
bureau had decided upon rain or sunshine for this part of the
nation on that day."</p>
<p>The third day our boat was finished, and in it I made the
journey with Costa and Winnie. At first Buda Earn had insisted
that he and I go alone, but this proposal was rejected
emphatically by both my host and his daughter. When we were on
the water, I rowing, Costa said:</p>
<p>"My friend, I wish to warn you against that young man. He
means to do you an injury. Avoid him as much as possible, and no
account ever trust yourself with him alone."</p>
<p>I looked my surprise before I replied:</p>
<p>"You astonish me. He has been so pleasant and agreeable. He
would be the last one I would suspect of doing or wishing me an
injury. Are you sure you are not mistaken."</p>
<p>"As sure as fate. We have read his mind ever since you came to
our home, and there is nothing but evil in it for you. But he is
trying to deceive us. None but the Great Dissembler could do
that."</p>
<p>"I have heard you mention that person several times and I am
curious to know who he is and why he bears that name. You always
speak of him in the highest terms as to ability, and yet with a
tone in your voice as if he was not&mdash;what shall I call
it&mdash;quite as you would like him to be."</p>
<p>"The Great Dissembler is the greatest man in the state, and if
you ever have need of help in this country which I cannot give I
advise you to go to him. At the earliest opportunity I will
introduce you, for I fear you may have need of him before we are
through with Earn. That fellow surely means you mischief. And the
trouble is, he has ability."</p>
<p>Long I pondered over the reasons for this young man's enmity
to me. That evening as Costa and I were walking upon the shore of
the little island the mystery was partially explained. Borne to
us on the evening breeze came the words:</p>
<p>"Winnifred, you cannot deny that you might have become my wife
if this stranger had not come between us."</p>
<p>The words were Harn's. What her answer was I did not hear, for
very promptly my host turned away, so that we heard no more.</p>
<p>Earn was jealous.</p>
<p>Had he any reason for it?</p>
<p>My heart beat a trifle faster as I meditated upon the
supposition.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;SOUTH POLAR POLICE BUREAU.</h3>
<p>Next morning my host told me that a gang of robbers had been
arrested the evening before, and if I cared to do so we would go
to the police court to witness the trial.</p>
<p>"Whose house did they break into?" I cried.</p>
<p>He looked at me in astonishment for a moment, and then,
remembering how ignorant I was of the customs of Theon very
courteously concealed his astonishment and explained to me:</p>
<p>"There is seldom any crime committed in this country. The
great mistake nations in other parts of the world make is in
waiting until a crime is committed before steps are taken to
prevent it. You have a proverb about it in your
language&mdash;'Locking the stable after the horse is
stolen.'"</p>
<p>"But how can you prevent it?"</p>
<p>"Have you been so long with us and not learned that we are all
mind readers?"</p>
<p>"But," I queried, still far at sea, "you have police
patrolling the streets. I have seen them, and a fine looking body
of men they are."</p>
<p>"Yes, of course. We have our police system, and it is very
nearly perfect. But policemen here are to prevent crime, not to
catch the criminal after it is committed."</p>
<p>"I am sure I do not follow you."</p>
<p>"It is very simple. As I said, we are all mind readers. Now,
if we always knew what man was inclined to rob us we could read
his mind and learn when. But take my case. I cannot spend my time
reading the minds of every person in the city to see if my
property is safe. So we have police to do it for us. They
constantly patrol the streets, reading the minds of those they
meet, and a report is made of each suspect when guard is
relieved, which occurs about every three hours. Of course they do
not mentally interrogate every one they meet on the street, that
would be impossible; but in the course of a month, with the help
of the reserve guard, which is stationed in the inner court,
every person in the city passes under their scrutiny.</p>
<p>"But this attention is centered chiefly upon the 'suspects.'
When a person falls under suspicion he is kept under constant
surveillance. To make it plain to you: While we are sitting here,
suppose I read in your mind that you had a desire to steal my
watch. (I beg your pardon for even hinting at it in way of
illustration.) I would report the fact to the chief of police,
and an officer would be detailed to take you under his
surveillance. Not one thought of yours could be concealed from
him, and if you determined upon the theft, you most likely would
be arrested before you could commit the crime."</p>
<p>"But what would you do with me? I would have done nothing that
a court could sentence me for!"</p>
<p>"You would not be punished. We seldom are called upon to do
that, and when we are, the ceremony is made a very solemn one,
indeed."</p>
<p>"But you have judges and courts equal to any I have ever seen
in America."</p>
<p>"Yes, but not for the same purpose. Let us follow the
illustration of yourself. When you were arrested you would be
taken into the court and your record produced by the policeman
who had been watching you. From this the judge would decide, not
as to your guilt, but as to how far inclined towards crime your
intellect had become, and would sentence you accordingly."</p>
<p>"Still I do not see how that would not be punishing me for
something I had not done."</p>
<p>"Not at all, I assure you. If you were shown to be not really
bad, you would be committed to reformatory No. I, as it is
called. You would not be imprisoned. On the contrary, you would
at once be set at liberty and no restrictions whatever placed
upon you. But you would be under the tutelage of the reserve
judges of the inner court. They are chosen from the purest men
and most powerful minds in the country. In other words, they are
the clergy of the land. To them your case would be made known and
your record given. Each one would take you under his supervision
for an hour a day and would, during that hour, direct the whole
power of his mind upon yours to drive from it every evil thought.
There would not be a moment of the day when their minds were not
working upon yours. It is very seldom that this course does not
succeed in reclaiming the suspect."</p>
<p>"But if it should not?"</p>
<p>"This is seldom the case. But when it does fail, if the man
grows worse, he is committed to the mental hospital and there
given a course of treatment."</p>
<p>"I am curious to hear more."</p>
<p>"He is committed to the hospital for a certain length of time
which the judge determines upon, according to the violence of his
disease. But he is not punished. On the contrary, his
surroundings are the most pleasant. He has pure companions, and
is treated according to his disease."</p>
<p>"His disease? May I ask what you mean?"</p>
<p>"Suppose his disease is drunkenness. The disgrace of it is
placed before him by one physician for an hour. Then succeeds
another who impresses upon his mind the respectability of
sobriety. Other physicians give him general moral tone."</p>
<p>"O, you mean he must spend his time listening to lectures. I
shouldn't think that would be a very good way of reforming a
criminal."</p>
<p>"No, no. Lectures would be the last thing we would think of.
The patient knows nothing of his treatment except that it is
going on. He seldom, if ever, sees his physicians. They, as the
judges in the first case, work upon his mind entirely and try to
drive out the evil and fill it with good thoughts."</p>
<p>"And do they always succeed?"</p>
<p>"If a man sets his will against them he can combat the wills
of his physicians and receive no benefit from their
treatment&mdash;if his will is stronger than theirs. We have had
a few such instances."</p>
<p>"And then?"</p>
<p>"They redouble the corps of physicians."</p>
<p>"You spoke of his pleasant surroundings."</p>
<p>"Yes. That is under the supervision of his nurses. Each nurse
has one or more patients under his or her care. They look after
the surroundings, the environments, see that they are proper and
conducive to his reform. And to them a great deal is due. They
become his friends, and attempt to lead him by moral suasion away
from evil. They look after his books. They see to it that time
does not drag or the life in the hospital prove irksome. They
look after his amusement and see that his mind is kept in a
healthy condition, so as to be receptive of good thoughts from
his physicians."</p>
<p>"It all seems very strange to me."</p>
<p>"Yes, no doubt it must to one who has never been taught that
all crime and all evil is a disease which must be treated as such
as much as any ailment of the body."</p>
<p>During this conversation we had been preparing to leave the
house, and at the conclusion of my host's last remark were
walking down the broad path to the gate. As we pursued our way
along the street my mind was busy revolving the things he had
told me. One point seemed a little incongruous, where so much
pains was taken to reform a criminal before he had committed a
crime, it did not seem quite consistent that his case should be
tried in open court and visitors allowed to be present to hear
the evidence, for in my own land when we wish to save a young man
who has been tempted we try most of all to keep his fault from
becoming known. The more I thought of this the more inconsistent
it became and my friend, no doubt reading my thoughts, said:</p>
<p>"Were these not old offenders who are to be tried to-day we
would not be permitted to witness the examination, for when a man
is first brought before the court and sent to reformatory No. I,
the whole proceeding is managed so very quietly that few need
know of it. But after a man has been under the supervision of the
seven judges of the inner court and then turns out bad, we
consider it for the best interests of society that the public at
large know what disease he is inclined to in order to protect
itself against him. The men whose trial we are about to witness
have passed through this stage, and hence their trial will be
public."</p>
<p>When we reached the temple of justice I found a large marble
structure, the interior of which, while very simple in design,
gave one the idea of loftiness and grandeur. At one end, upon a
platform, stood the judge's desk, behind which sat one of the
criminal judges, of which there were ten in the state.</p>
<p>The prisoners were seated in front of him, with no guards
near, at which I expressed my surprise. But my host told me in a
low tone that the odylic force which was being concentrated upon
them was of such power that they could move only as the judge
desired.</p>
<p>There was really little examination of the witnesses
themselves, the principal part of the trial consisting of the
policemen's testimony. As we entered, the sergeant of the platoon
which had the burglars in surveillance was speaking.</p>
<p>"Six months ago," he said, "these men were brought into the
inner court and the records read concerning them. Three at that
time were friends and conspiring to rob. The minds of the others
were tainted with the same disease, but as yet had formed no
combination. Since then I and my division have been keeping them
under constant surveillance. Each possesses a strong will, which
he placed in opposition to that of the seven judges. Three months
ago the whole band drew closer together. They had not at that
time settled upon any particular house to rob, but frequently
held communication with one another upon the injustice of some
men being rich while others were poor, and some men honored with
office while others were but common citizens in a land which
teaches the equality of man. Gradually this idea grew in their
minds until they determined upon an equal division of wealth, and
to carry out this idea decided upon robbing the wealthiest man in
the city. Every preparation had been made and the robbery would
have occurred last night had we not arrested them."</p>
<p>"Is this true?" asked the judge of the prisoners.</p>
<p>"It is," they replied. For in court where there can be no
deceit and where mind reads mind, there are no spoken lies.</p>
<p>Sentence was immediately passed by the judge. The three
original conspirators were committed to ward I of the burglary
hospital, two of the others to ward 2 of the same institution,
and the rest, whose minds were not so badly diseased, to ward 3.
As soon as sentence was passed the men arose and, without guards,
marched directly to the hospital, the odylic force, my host
explaining, compelling them to do so.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX.&mdash;THE GREAT DISSEMBLER APPEARS.</h3>
<p>I had an illustration of how Buda Earn loved me before we left
the island that day, but I did not realize it until we had
returned home.</p>
<p>We four had been standing together upon a hill sloping down
toward the sea when Earn turned the conversation toward the power
of mind over nature. I was somewhat skeptical, although Costa had
hinted at it several times.</p>
<p>"Do you mean to tell me or try to make me believe you have any
power over that tree yonder, other than physical?"</p>
<p>"Certainly we do," replied Costa. "You shall see an exhibition
of it at once. I shall not leave your side, and yet that tree
shall fall to the earth. Be silent."</p>
<p>We all remained for the space of a couple of minutes, and I
knew Costa was concentrating his mind upon something, and I
imagined it was the work he had laid out. In a moment more the
tree began to lean heavily toward the south, and then came down
with a crash.</p>
<p>"You see," was all Costa said, and I was dumfounded.</p>
<p>Soon after that I strayed away from the others for a moment
and stood alone a few rods from there and was gazing out over the
water. Suddenly I heard a cry of warning, and was just in time to
spring away from a giant boulder which was rolling down upon
me.</p>
<p>"Whatever loosened that?" I asked in some surprise as it
rolled by me and plunged into the sea.</p>
<p>The faces of both Costa and Winnie grew grave, and they looked
at Earn suspiciously, but said nothing. Soon after they proposed
that we start upon our return to Theon.</p>
<p>Nothing was said about the narrow escape I had from death
during the journey, but after we had reached home Costa drew me
into the parlor and said:</p>
<p>"Wilding, it is as I feared. Your life is in danger as long as
you remain in this land."</p>
<p>"I see nothing in the rolling of a boulder more than I might
expect in any land," I replied.</p>
<p>"And yet there was more. And sometimes I grow almost impatient
with your obtuseness. After the exhibition I gave you of the
power of mind over nature, has not the suspicion come to you that
that rock was rolled downward on purpose to cause your
death?"</p>
<p>"Well, no, I can't say that it has."</p>
<p>"Well, I am certain that it was. In fact, I have very good
proof that it was."</p>
<p>"And, of course, you suspect Earn?"</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>"But if he was exerting his mind to encompass my death at that
particular moment, why was it that you could not read it in his
thoughts and so prevent it?"</p>
<p>"Because he was not the direct cause, which makes your danger
all the greater."</p>
<p>"If he was not the direct cause, then who was? I confess my
obtuseness allows me to be puzzled by your explanation."</p>
<p>"Either Winnie or I was reading his thoughts the whole day.
Only once was there anything suspicious in it, and that was a
moment before the rock fell. Then he sent a message to some one,
I know not whom, which merely said:</p>
<p>"'Now is the time.'</p>
<p>"What those words meant we would have been unable to guess if
it had not been that the rock came crashing down the instant
after."</p>
<p>"My dear sir," I interrupted, "are you not too
suspicious?"</p>
<p>Costa's face clouded.</p>
<p>"Really, you irritate me. Perhaps it would be as well to leave
you alone to your destruction."</p>
<p>His manner was so pained that I at once was sorry to have
offended so good a friend, and pleaded with him to bear with my
stupidity and I would try not to offend him again.</p>
<p>"What we fear," he continued, "is that he is in collusion with
a band of men which the police has had an inkling of for some
time, a sort of revolutionary club which has sprung up during the
last ten years. I have pretty good evidence that he is a leader
in it, and we fear that he has enlisted it or some of its members
to assist him in compassing your destruction. If this were the
case it would have been easy for him to have arranged for several
of them to be on the island that day waiting an opportunity to
kill you in a manner which could not be laid upon him. As he was
with us, he knew we would be upon the alert, and would know that
he exerted no power himself. Then if his friends could accomplish
his purpose no charge could be made against him."</p>
<p>"But if others were there on the island, how could they
conceal themselves so effectually? You saw no one when the rock
fell?"</p>
<p>"You forget that they were all in their astral bodies, and
that the astral body is invisible at will."</p>
<p>"To-day I will make an investigation and learn if any of the
people I suspect were away on a journey to-day, and if so, will
consider my suspicions correct."</p>
<p>The next evening Costa came to my room and said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Wilding, six of the revolutionary society I spoke of were
absent yesterday. This affair of yours has become so complicated
that there is only one help for you. We must apply to the Great
Dissembler. I will introduce you to him this evening."</p>
<p>Accordingly we sallied out and walked to a villa about a mile
from the Costa residence. We found a man whose head and face
denoted power more strongly than any head and face I had ever
seen. And yet the face was a perfect blank, as to expression. It
was a sphinx head. I could no more have told from it what the man
was thinking of or whether we were welcome or the contrary than,
to use a common expression, I could fly.</p>
<p>Costa stated the case to him and he said:</p>
<p>"I will take the matter under advisement and let you know from
time to time what not to do."</p>
<p>"What not to do?" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Yes. In your case there is nothing to do. The thing is to
avoid doing anything. There will be a pretty stiff fight, and
just what the end will be I cannot tell. It may overturn the
world."</p>
<p>This time it was Costa who was shocked.</p>
<p>"I mean it," the Great Dissembler reaffirmed. "This is not a
little love affair between two men and a girl. We have the whole
revolutionary society arrayed against the state for its
overthrow. Your matter is but an incident in the war which is
coming upon us as fast as mundane affairs can come. But I will
keep an eye upon you, and I would recommend that you never
venture out without my friend Costa or his daughter, for a time.
You see, you cannot fight with the weapons of Theos, where 100
minds may be concentrated upon you, moving even the rocks and
trees for your destruction. Why, man, those fellows could lure
you to your destruction and you never realize it. Have you never
had any longing to return to your boat on the icebergs?"</p>
<p>"Yes, strange to say, that has been in my mind almost
continually for the past three days."</p>
<p>"I thought so. Well, forewarned is forearmed. They would
entice you away to perish of cold in the ice fields. But we will
see to that."</p>
<p>All this was Greek to me and I said so.</p>
<p>"Influence of mind upon mind, my child," the Great Dissembler
replied. "With 100 minds willing you to go wandering out on the
barren ice fields, how can your one poor, weak mind resist?
Costa, you must help him counteract this force."</p>
<p>It will be needless to follow all the machinations of Earn and
his friends against me, for they were, as the Great Dissembler
said, but incidents in the great war which was gathering. It is
enough to say that for weeks there was not an hour of the day in
which some new danger did not menace me. And how nobly Costa and
his daughter stood by me, words cannot express. It was after one
of these trials that Winnie said to me:</p>
<p>"Do you remember the first conversation we had when you
arrived at our home? You told me you liked the Winnie of the
plains, the Winnie who faded away from you better than the one
you saw before you in flesh and blood then. And I told you I was
glad you did. You did not understand it then."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"It was because you loved my soul, as it was, free from the
body, better than with its earthly casing. That meant that you
cared more for me, myself, as I really am. For the soul without
the body shows what one really is, better than when hidden by the
body."</p>
<p>That night I wrote this:</p>
<p><b>SONG TO WINNIE.</b><br></p>
<p>Dear gracious hand I bend o'er thee<br>
With reverence deep as ever knee<br>
Was bent before the virgin's shrine<br>
By devotee of her divine.<br>
<br>
With reverent heart I bend over thee,<br>
Dear gracious hand so kind to me,<br>
And love's sweet kiss on the impress;<br>
I dare no more, I can no less.<br>
<br>
Dear gracious hand of fairest shape,<br>
O dear, white hand, whose fingers tape;<br>
May that day come, full soon, I pray,<br>
When you may never slip away.</p>
<p>One day I called upon the Great Dissembler and in the course
of our conversation asked him:</p>
<p>"How have you succeeded in eluding the surveillance of the
police and the judges of the inner court?" I asked of the
dissembler. He laughed lightly and replied:</p>
<p>"It is almost suicidal for me to tell you, for in order to do
so it will be necessary for me to keep my mind on the business,
in which case the officers who may have their minds directed to
me may read the whole story. But I will chance it. I am known as
the Great Dissembler because no one has ever yet been able to
make out what I was thinking of or what I proposed doing. My plan
is this: Early in life I saw that for a bright young man to
succeed in this benighted country, it would be necessary for him
to have his wits about him, and to be able to dissemble his
thoughts. For, suppose I should invent a life-saving or a
labor-saving machine, what was to keep some other fellow from
stealing my idea before it was perfected? Or, suppose I should
write a beautiful poem. There is no law in this country for
copyrighting one's thoughts, and so any one who was keeping tab
on me could write the same poem and either get it printed first
or claim mine was a forgery. You see the difficulties which meet
a talented young man in this country."</p>
<p>I intimated that I did.</p>
<p>"So, in early life, as I observed a few minutes ago, I decided
to put my wits to work to outwit every other man in the land. It
was a big undertaking, but I did it by concentrating my will and
learning to think one thing when I meant something exactly
opposite, and learning to think of half a dozen things at the
same time. Thus, when I have been planning any particular work of
devilment, I give it only a moment's thought at a time, and then
let my mind wander off into the paths of virtue. Unless I happen
to be under the surveillance of the police, the chances are one
in a thousand that any one should be reading my mind at the exact
time that thought flashes through it. And if they do, as it is
succeeded almost immediately by the most beautiful and virtuous
thoughts, they take it as merely a temptation of the evil one
which I have nobly driven away. In this manner I have no doubt I
have often won the respect and regard of those high up in morals
and the state.</p>
<p>"Then I cultivated the habit of jumbling up my thoughts into
the worst mess you could imagine, and would let them fly from
philosophy to poetry and from morals to immortality and back
again that no one could fasten upon them. One second I would be
planning to stop the moon in her career, and the next formulating
a new prayer for the temple or an ode to purity. In this way I
secured the name of the Great Dissembler.</p>
<p>"You wonder that I did not go crazy. Well, an ordinary mind
would. But I had so strengthened mine by every known means that
it stood the strain, and now if any weak mortal has a bit of
deviltry he wants done, he comes to me and I do it for him. But
always with the understanding that he never thinks of me or it
again. To insure this, I tell him I will have nothing to do with
it.</p>
<p>"And I don't, unless it is something that will give me
amusement.</p>
<p>"If, however, a person comes to me a second time and I know he
cannot keep his mind off the subject, I put him into a hypnotic
sleep until the business is over.</p>
<p>"It helped me in politics, too, as none of my opponents could
ever tell what I was going to say or do. In this way I won my way
to the leadership of politics and became a power in the state. It
is true that many people have suspicions of me, and look upon me
askance. But what of that? They never can catch me. For weeks at
a stretch I have had officers on my trail and, well, I led them a
merry dance. I believe their brains were somewhat jumbled up at
the end of the week. Yes, I rather believe so. How I kept their
poor brains on the rack! One minute it would be an abstract
problem in mathematics, and the next one in philosophy. Then a
line or so of poetry, and next a dip into morals and theology.
They never could catch me. And then I had the pleasure of
laughing at them the next time we met and pointing out a few
mistakes they had made in their report to the chief. Oh, yes,
this life of mine has had its relaxations, if it is a hard
one.</p>
<p>"Then, too, I have a contrivance into which I can retire
whenever it is necessary for any prolonged thinking. I will show
it to you."</p>
<p>Opening a door, he conducted me into a small room, and closing
the entrance, bid me sit down.</p>
<p>"This room," he explained, "is thought proof. As you must have
learned by this time, thought messages travel through a thin,
imponderable ether, which fills all space; travels as sound and
light do through air. Now, if you can create a perfect vacuum,
there could be no sound. So, if you could create a perfect vacuum
as to this ether of which I speak&mdash;and which I call ether,
because there is no other name by which you would understand me
as well&mdash;if we could create such a vacuum, then no thought
could pass through it. This is one of my early inventions. There
is a perfect vacuum all around this room, which is built of
glass. Whenever I have a particularly difficult problem to study
out, I retire into this room. Then 'my friends' who are keeping
tab on me to catch me, are dumfounded, for I have mysteriously
disappeared!</p>
<p>"There have been many of these mysterious disappearances
lately. When I retire into this room, not all the police and
inner judges in the world can trace me. They do not know whether
I am on the confines of the earth, floating through space, or
down at the south pole. It always amuses me after one of these
periods of retirement to pay a visit to the police court and have
a chat with 'my friends' and ask them how things have been going
while I was away. It amuses me and does no harm."</p>
<p>All this was so confusing, coming upon the heels of the
display of power I had seen in arresting criminals before they
committed the crime, that I asked the Great Dissembler:</p>
<p>"Why do not the police detect these fellows?"</p>
<p>"Because the police belong to their club. Half the judges are
with them."</p>
<p>Then I realized that my case was precarious. The Great
Dissembler said the state of the state was desperate.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X.&mdash;I LEAVE THEOS.</h3>
<p>But from that time on to the end events moved rapidly.</p>
<p>The revolutionary club gathered themselves for a grand, final
effort, coming out from their secret working, if such a thing
could be said to exist in that country, and plainly hurled
defiance at the rest of the state. It was then found that they
numbered, as was stated, many of the police force and several
judges of the country.</p>
<p>But I can only describe the warfare as a gigantic battle of
the elements, for not a sword was flashed, not a gun was fired,
and there was no political wrangling. To a stranger visiting the
country it would seem as if nothing was going on.</p>
<p>And yet there was a strange force at work throughout the whole
state, mind working upon mind, all the rest and quiet overturned,
and men's worst passions brought to the surface.</p>
<p>It was like the atmosphere, hot and oppressive, charged with
electricity before a thunderstorm.</p>
<p>But after the battle had been waged for several days, whether
by choice of force, the revolutionary club and its followers
retired to the opposite side of the inland sea and encamped upon
a charming plain directly across from Theon.</p>
<p>Then came the Great Dissembler's final move, a move worthy of
a great general. One evening, when I called upon him, he said,
with as much of a gleam in his eye as he would allow, that he had
the enemy exactly where he wanted them.</p>
<p>"They are located exactly across from us, the South Pole being
directly between us and them. Are you enough of an astronomer to
know concerning the precession of the equinoxes as it is commonly
called, by which the direction of the poles to the earth's plane
is changed? This also causes a change in the zones of the earth.
In the legends of the earth there have been one of these, at
least. Ages ago the North Temperate zone was a barren ice field,
and countries now covered with ice were inhabited. The change
which is about to take place will bring back the old order of
things. Climate will change all over the world.</p>
<p>"The wrench here at the pole will be sudden, but the changes
in other parts of the world be more gradual. In your own home in
the United States there will be cyclones and tornadoes and
earthquakes. These will gradually increase in number and
intensity until the climate becomes warmer and at last merges
into the tropical.</p>
<p>"But all this has nothing to do with the state of affairs
here. What it means is that by the position of the revolutionary
force it will be utterly destroyed. They are on the side of the
pole where the reaction will come when we jar the pole from its
mooring.</p>
<p>"There will be a general breaking up of the ice barriers in
that direction and a change in the surface of this inland sea,
which will wash that shore with tidal waves against which none
can stand."</p>
<p>"Not even a spirit?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, if those rascals wish to project their astral bodies
out into space they can do so, but that will really mean passing
into the spirit world. With life once gone from their bodies,
they can never re-enter them."</p>
<p>"But will not they know of the change?"</p>
<p>"They know it may come soon, but not that it will come to-day.
I alone of this whole people really know the exact hour in which
this change will come, for the reason that during all these ages
a discrepancy of several days has come in our method of keeping
time. Neither do I think that those fellows have any idea of its
suddenness. Few of us were living when the last one came!"</p>
<p>"When do you calculate it will occur?"</p>
<p>"In just one hour from now."</p>
<p>I was startled, but he assured me there was no need of fear.
"I will look after you, but you may be obliged to leave
here."</p>
<hr class="short">
<p>Winnie and I had been a little more confidential than usual
the evening before, and in the course of the conversation she
said:</p>
<p>"I feel as if I ought to warn you of the Great Dissembler. We
really know not on which side he is."</p>
<p>"Have you any cause to doubt him?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, that is just the trouble. No one ever has. But this we do
know, that the revolutionary forces count him on their side. He
is playing a deep game."</p>
<hr class="short">
<p>But we were wrong in our suspicion. The Great Dissembler was
truly our friend, although he failed in his calculation, and the
wreck of the South Pole did not come as he expected. The day
passed and no change came. Then we found that those rascals on
the other side had a purpose in going to the place they did. They
proposed to keep the pole where it was! And were making a
combined effort with the odylic force at the command of each to
retain it in position. Whether they had any power, or whether the
time had not yet come when the precession of the equinoxes should
get down to work, I cannot say. But it was not until the next day
that the change came, and then the Great Dissembler had his
forces arranged in Theos and was fighting his great battle.</p>
<p>The wreck came, and with it the defeat of the revolutionists.
They perished to a man. But in the great commotion of which was
to change the climate of the whole world, turn ice fields into
pastures and green fields into barren wastes, just as had been
done ages ago, there was such a tremendous earthquake that a rift
was made in the ice walls around us and after days of terror and
suffering, I found myself once more near the place where I had
first landed. There was a ship near, which had landed a boat and
was exploring the bergs for seal. They were from New London, and
took me aboard, much against my will. I protested that I wished
to return to the city of Theos, but they took this merely as the
ravings of a shipwrecked mariner who had been wandering upon the
ice. And recent events had so dazed me that there was some excuse
for their belief.</p>
<p>We sailed north at once, and after touching at a few islands
between the great Antarctic continent and the Horn, met a severe
storm which wrecked our ship. We put off in the boats, but for
all I have ever heard they were wrecked also, except the one I
was in. It carried me here to this harbor, my mates dying before
we reached it.</p>
<p>You will wonder why I have been so resigned on this
island.</p>
<p>I was right. They began their search almost as soon as I
disappeared, and shortly after I arrived at this island the Great
Dissembler located me and appeared in his astral body one
afternoon.</p>
<p>"My boy," he said, and there was no coldness in his tones. "I
am glad to see you. We have been hunting for you ever since you
disappeared." And then he related to me in detail the story of
Theon after the great revolution and of the daily solicitude of
Winnie and Costa for my welfare.</p>
<p>"You have won the love of a noble woman, my boy, and we must
get you back to us."</p>
<p>Some time later both Winnie and her father visited me, and
their visits have been continued at frequent intervals, sometimes
the Great Dissembler coming with them, and sometimes alone. They
provided me with means of living and keeping warm, and with their
frequent visits my sojourn in this place has not been lonely.</p>
<p>But when I will find means of joining them I cannot say,
although the Great Dissembler bids me hope that it will not be
long now until they will have built some kind of a ship or
contrived some other means of getting me back to Theos.</p>
<p>"And when you are once there, a day shall not pass until
Winnie is your wife."</p>
<p>And as both Costa and his daughter have intimated their full
acquiescence in this proposition, I have no doubt but that it
will be so.</p>
<p>Of course, these dear friends can visit me in their astral
bodies, and, perhaps, in time, might teach me how to exercise the
same freedom. But that would not bring us really any nearer
together. For theosophists have no way of transporting the
material body.</p>
<p>But, as I said, the Great Dissembler is confident that he will
have me with them soon, and I have learned to have confidence in
him.</p>
<p>And so, here's waiting for her, Winnie.</p>

<h1>The Indestructible Story.</h1>
<h3>By</h3>
<h2>CHARLES CURTZ HAHN.</h2>
<hr>
<h2><a name="THE_INDESTRUCTIBLE_STORY" id=
"THE_INDESTRUCTIBLE_STORY">THE INDESTRUCTIBLE STORY.</a></h2>
<p>A party of five, all newspaper men, were seated in a small
restaurant on Fifth avenue, Chicago, about 3 o'clock one morning.
It was a dingy place, and the lunches served were not dainty
ones, yet it was a favorite among night men because of its
nearness to the three great dailies, the <i>Times,</i> the
<i>Herald</i> and the <i>News,</i> while the <i>Tribune</i> was
only a couple of blocks away.</p>
<p>The quintet consisted of Chase, of the <i>News,</i> Brown and
Kent, of the <i>Times,</i> and Hanklin and Brandon, of the
<i>Herald,</i> and they were seated at a little round table in
the rear of the room finishing a plebeian lunch of switzer
cheese, bread and beer, before going home.</p>
<p>"Did you ever hear of Landstreet's 'indestructible story?'"
Chase asked, during a lull in the conversation.</p>
<p>"What was it?" This from Kent. "One that long-continued
'respectfully declined' had no effect upon?"</p>
<p>"No; not quite. And yet that had something to do with it, for
Landstreet always had half a dozen MSS. out and never a one
accepted. At last he went crazy on the subject; at least, that is
what his friends thought, although I had an idea that perhaps the
old fellow possessed a vein of humor we never suspected."</p>
<p>"What did he do?"</p>
<p>"He conceived the idea that if he couldn't get into print, he,
at least, would write one story that would live forever, and the
way he went about it showed unfailing symptoms of lunacy
or&mdash;humor. I don't know which it was, and have long ago
given up guessing. Sometimes I think he must have possessed a
grim sense of humor, and was planning a stupendous joke on us; at
other times I think he must have been stark, staring mad."</p>
<p>"Never mind going into the philosophy of the matter; what was
his scheme, his little joke, or his particular form of
lunacy?"</p>
<p>"I thought I said it was an indestructible story," Chase
answered testily, for the question irritated him. "That is all.
He determined to give the world one sketch which should live
forever, and, as editors refused, with startling unanimity, to
recognize his genius, he cast about for some other means of
preserving his stuff. At length he hit upon the scheme of making
a sheet of paper that no force could destroy, no fire burn. If he
could just secure that, he would be able to produce something
that would live in spite of his friends, the editors."</p>
<p>"By George! What an idea! Did he succeed? If he did there was
a mint of money in it. How did he make it go?"</p>
<p>"I can't tell you exactly, but he went about it with a good
deal of common sense, if common sense could be used in such a
crazy scheme. He first looked for some substance that could not
be destroyed by fire, and this he found in asbestos, but it would
not do, as it could be pulled to pieces too easily. Still,
Landstreet saw that it would make a good foundation to work upon,
and began looking around for some ingredient to mix with it. The
next I heard of him he had been consulting a chemist, and when we
met he said he had found what he wanted. It was aluminum. At that
time this substance was worth only about &pound;10 a pound, and
for a couple of dollars he secured enough for experimenting. It
is the most indestructible thing in the world, as you all know.
You can pull it and twist it, but it will not tear or break; and
it requires great heat to melt it. Well, Landstreet melted it,
mixed it with a lot of asbestos, and then rolled the mass out
into a thin sheet. It was about as nearly indestructible as
anything you could find. It would roll and bend, but the asbestos
kept it from stretching and from melting, except under the
hottest of fires.</p>
<p>"One would have thought that his work was done now, but
Landstreet was not satisfied. The idea came to him, perhaps, that
some villainous editor of the twentieth century, who might come
across his indestructible story, could make short work of it with
a pair of office shears; for, as yet, his paper could be cut. Oh,
how he hated an editor and a pair of shears and a blue pencil! I
don't know what he did, what he used, but he intimated that it
was largely a composition of diamond dust. But, whatever he hit
upon, it was a fine, shining powder, and, after heating his
former composition, he sprinkled this powder over it. The result
was a thin sheet which would not tear, break or melt to such a
degree as to lose its shape. He had secured the material for his
'indestructible story.'"</p>
<p>"Well," said Hanklin, after a pause, "what became of it? Where
is his wonderful sheet? Who has it?"</p>
<p>"That's more than I know," Chase replied. "Landstreet showed
it to me, but I never heard what he wrote or what he did with it.
In fact, I haven't seen him for months."</p>
<p>"Probably I can finish your story." It was Kent who spoke.</p>
<p>"What! Do you know of it, too?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Landstreet and I have been friends for the last five
years&mdash;<i>were</i> friends, I should say, for he is
dead."</p>
<p>"Dead?"</p>
<p>"Dead. Died three months ago. I met him when he first came to
Chicago, and brought in his first 'special' article to the
<i>Times</i> to sell. He didn't sell it, and I gave him some
pointers. Whether they did him any good or not I cannot say, but
it was the means of getting us acquainted. I pitied the poor
fellow, he had such bad luck. Some of his work was better than
any that ever appeared in our paper, and yet he never could sell
it. Strange how some men never can succeed! We've had a hundred
changes in our force since then, but Landstreet could never get
on. Some green fellow who could not write a decent article, and
who was certain to be 'fired' within three months would be
preferred to Landstreet every time.</p>
<p>"He never told me about his 'indestructible story,' as you
call it, until just a few nights before his death. He and his
wife and two little girls lived over on the west side in a
miserable little tenement-house&mdash;had only two rooms, I
think. Anyway, they were in as hard luck as one could wish to
see. I used to stop occasionally to cheer him up a little.</p>
<p>"A few nights before he died I stopped on my way down to the
office, and he told me of his scheme; but from his manner I could
not have understood, at first, whether he was concocting some
practical joke, thought he could invent something that would be
of value, or was really insane. He had succeeded, to all
appearances at least, in producing a sheet of paper that would
neither burn nor tear. We tested it as well as we could, that
night. He also took up a knife and attempted to cut it, but that
was impossible. He had invented a perpetual indelible ink, too,
with which to write upon his paper. He did not explain its
ingredients. Before I left he went to a table drawer and brought
back a little roll, which he gave to me, saying: 'Don't open this
till you hear I am dead.'</p>
<p>"I supposed it was some directions with regard to the poor
fellow's wife and children, and so took it without much surprise.
I knew he could not live long. After his death, I opened it. Here
it is."</p>
<p>Kent pulled a small roll from his pocket and passed it over to
Chase. It consisted of a number of lead-colored sheets of paper,
which had the appearance of having been oiled. Upon it was
written:</p>
<h3>STRANGE STORY OF A COIN.</h3>
<p>When this MS. is read its writer will be beyond the stars, in
paradise, purgatory, or hell. Judging from my luck in this world,
I consider my prospects brighter for the last-named place.</p>
<p>What I am about to relate is no carefully studied tale. Three
months ago it was entirely unknown to me. As some of my
friends&mdash;Kent, for instance, who is a great
babbler&mdash;will no doubt publish it to the world, I have been
working for months upon an indestructible sheet of paper, upon
which I proposed writing an indestructible story&mdash;one which
would live forever in spite of various editors of Chicago. I even
had a dainty prose poem blocked out for it, when there came a
revelation which turned the current of my thoughts in another
direction and decided me to give this story to the world instead
of one of more literary value, which I could have written
myself.</p>
<p>I have always had bad luck from the time when a teething babe
I got a canker in the mouth by biting on an old coin, down
through the days when I was thrashed regularly by my school
teacher for other boys' misdemeanors, down to the present time
when, kicked by editors and spurned by 'devils,' I am about to
bury myself in a country newspaper office in Southern
Illinois.</p>
<p>Three months ago, lacking seven days, I learned the cause of
all my ill-luck. You will laugh when you read what it was, but
before you finish this story your laugh will change to
astonishment.</p>
<p>Mention was just made of an old coin upon which I cut my first
set of teeth, and got a canker in the mouth at the same time.
That coin was the cause of all my misfortune. I have had it in my
possession&mdash;much of the time in my pocket&mdash;for
thirty-five years; but not until a few weeks ago did I learn its
history, or the evil influence it has carried with it for
centuries. I looked upon it only as an interesting relic of my
distinguished babyhood, and&mdash;perhaps, one of value to be
'put up' on a rainy day. Many rainy days have come, but I have
never parted with it. I wish I had; wish I had pawned it long
ago, and lost the ticket. Or, rather, I wish I had made a present
of it to one of those conceited editors.</p>
<p>The reader may trust the following as historically correct. It
is history, all of it, and each statement can be substantiated by
reference to well-known writers, of unimpeachable veracity. But
in telling my story I shall reserve the right to tell it my own
way; and the first part of the history of this miserable piece of
silver will be omitted until I am ready to give it.</p>
<p>Last fall my eldest brother, who still lives at the old
homestead, sent me a bundle of manuscript, accompanied by the
following letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rocky Fork, Sept. 3, 1889.&mdash;Dear Brother:</p>
<p>I found this bundle of papers stowed away in the attic, tied
up in an oil cloth and sealed in a tin box. When I brought it
down, father, although he is very forgetful, remembered it. He
said it was left here nearly thirty-five years ago by a young man
who stopped over night with us. He was a melancholy-looking
fellow, and gave you a queer bit of silver to cut your teeth on.
We kept the box for some time, thinking he would return. He never
did, and it was laid away for safety. By and by it got hidden
away in the attic, and has just come to light. I glanced over the
papers, and finding them rather curious, will send them to you.
They may make the foundation of a story for you. Your
brother,</p>
<p>John Landstreet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A foundation for a story! It proved the plot of a tragedy!</p>
<p>The papers were of all shapes and sizes, and in various
handwritings. Some were of comparatively recent date, but others
had been written centuries ago, and in a phraseology hard to
decipher. I could make this story very
effective&mdash;'artistic,' perhaps, were I to copy these records
verbatim. But I have lost my desire to make a sensation. All I
care for is to give the strange history to the world. Besides,
the documents are lengthy, and my sheets of indestructible paper
are numbered. I will merely give the young man's own manuscript
and then weave the others into a connected story. The last owner
of the accursed piece of silver wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I shall go mad if I do not get rid of this infamous Thing. It
has brought ruin, desolation, disgrace upon me, and now I feel
that my mind is giving way. I shall add my testimony to the ones
already in the box, and then at the first opportunity leave both
coin and records in some one's possession. Who am I that I alone
should bear the burden? Whoever opens the box may rest assured of
the truthfulness of every word contained in it. The damnable
piece of silver * * * has been traced down from the day when * *
* until it came into my hands. How this record was kept the
inclosed papers will explain. In some cases they were made by the
men and women who suffered; in others, by learned men, whose
attention had been attracted to the fatal coin, and who took
pains to search it out. Early in its existence it became a matter
of history. Earlier still&mdash;aye, the very day it became
infamous, it was marked, indelibly marked, in such a manner that
none can mistake it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then followed explanations which were necessary to prove the
authenticity of the manuscript, but which I will not give now.
The records will be preserved carefully for any who may care to
examine them.</p>
<p>And now, as I said, I propose to tell my story in my own way,
and I will begin with this ill-gotten piece of silver at a time
when its evil story had become well known in the world, reserving
to the last my description of it, and my account of how and why
it is possessed of such a curse.</p>
<p>The first scene opens in Rome&mdash;Christian Rome&mdash;in
the days of Julian, the Apostate. But he was not always 'the
apostate.' In early life he was a follower of the humble
Nazarine, and not until his cousin Constantius died did he
forsake the faith. Why did he take the course that branded him
with infamy? The secret archives of Rome mention that in his
possession was a curious coin with certain peculiar marks upon
it. Those marks are upon the coin in my possession, and the curse
fell upon him even more heavily than it did upon me. Within a
year after Julian, the Christian, found that ancient piece in the
catacombs of Rome he had become Julian, the Apostate.</p>
<p>From the time of Julian the records give a long list of
names&mdash;some well known, others mere names; some Roman and
Italian, others German, Spanish and French; showing that the coin
had traveled much. In 1100 it found its way to England, and for
years it remained in an abbey, until at last it came into the
possession of Thomas a' Becket. History tells how the good man
met his false charges, his imprisonment and death. Again the coin
sinks into obscurity, to rise into greater disaster, after a
silence of fifty years. In 1871 the records say it was given to
Henry II. of England, and remained in his cabinet during those
eighteen bitter years of his life&mdash;years marked by revolt
after revolt of his own sons, until at last the rebellion of his
youngest broke the father's heart. Again it is traced back to
Italy; not only to Italy, but to Rome; not only to Rome, but to
the Vatican itself. By some means it found its way to the library
of Pope Boniface VIII. Is it needless to recount how he was
imprisoned, insulted and killed by Philip the Fair, of France?
And note how the curse rested upon his successors as long as it
remained in their possession. Benedict IX. lived but a few
months, Clement V. was obliged to remove to Avignon, and for
seventy years the successors of St. Peter were exiles.</p>
<p>Back and forth, back and forth, from Rome to England, and from
England to France, this piece of silver, with its flowering rod
upon one side, and its pot of manna on the other, traveled.
Driving a Christian ruler into apostasy; driving the popes from
Rome to Avignon; bringing the saintly Becket to his death!
Wherever it went its blighting effects were visible. And as the
famous Archbishop of Canterbury could not escape its dark
influence, neither could the great cardinal. All unconscious of
its dreadful history, Wolsey also received it; received it from
the hands of an enemy, who knew its evil power; received it while
on the crest of popularity's wave. How quickly he sank, as a ball
of fire glowing in the sky falls, and is extinguished in the
depths of the sea.</p>
<p>Was it fate or merely God's hand molding the affairs of men,
that the great cardinal's successor, Sir Thomas More, should meet
with such reverses. He, too, held the accursed piece in his
possession for one year&mdash;a year of imprisonment and trial
ended with death.</p>
<p>Most tragic of all was the fate of Jacques Molay, the last
grand master of the Templars. To him also the fatal coin
descended and in its wake came ruin and banishment, torture and
death for the greatest body of warriors which ever fought for
Christendom. At last the ill-fated grand master, after seeing his
army disbanded, was bound to the stake, and from the flames
summoned his two enemies, the pope of Rome and the king of
France, to meet him at the bar of God within a year. Before a
twelve-month both were dead.</p>
<p>The reader would weary were I to enumerate each one who
suffered. Let me but mention lovely Mary, queen of the Scots.
Lady Jane Grey, Charles Edward, the 'Pretender,' Charles I., Joan
of Arc. Each was in turn the possessor of this piece of silver,
and each in turn suffered.</p>
<p>It is also said that Henry VIII. possessed the evil talisman,
which accounted for his many wives, but there is little data for
the belief.</p>
<p>The scene changes again&mdash;this time across the seas to the
American shores. The war of the revolution was being fought and
the evil talisman came across the ocean in a British man-of-war.
It was in the possession of an English officer, the unfortunate
Major Andre. He, too, met his fate. But before he died he was
allowed to send a package to his family, and among other
valuables it contained the fatal pocket piece. See how justice is
sometimes meted out. Arnold had seen this strange piece of money
in Andre's possession during one of their brief interviews. The
piece was stolen from Andre's widow, and found its way to a
London pawnshop. One day the man without friends or
home&mdash;the traitor, Arnold&mdash;entered the shop and
recognized it. With some feeling of remorse, and we know of not
what other sentiments he purchased it. Cursed as his life had
been, doubly cursed was it afterward.</p>
<p>One scene more. No one has ever really known the secret of
Napoleon's fall. Remembering his triumphant march through France,
gathering a regiment in every village as he returned from a
previous captivity, it is hard to understand why, after Waterloo,
he gave up so entirely. Once before he had not only been
conquered, but had been a prisoner, yet he broke his prison
chains and ascended even higher heights of glory. Why did he fail
at Waterloo? You have all read of the 'red man'&mdash;the devil,
some called him; others, the shadow&mdash;who visited Napoleon
before each battle and dictated what he should do. On the eve of
the battle of Waterloo he came as usual, and Napoleon bade him
begone. The 'red man' replied: "I will give you the whole world
but St. Helena. Thither I will retire. See that you follow me
not. Take this talisman as a parting gift. It has shown power
before; it will show power with you. Keep it near you." It was
the accursed piece. Napoleon took the coin, Waterloo was lost,
and Napoleon never lifted his head again.</p>
<p>And now we have reached the last generation, when the coin
fell into the hands of the young man, who fled from its baneful
influence and left it with me. Some time, if I live, I may write
his life, but there is not time now. The question remains to be
answered.</p>
<p>What was this coin, and why did it carry with it such a curse
that centuries have been marked with it?</p>
<p>The piece was an uneven circle; on one side was a pot of
manna, and on the reverse a flowering almond. Around the edge
were Hebrew characters meaning "Holiness unto the Lord." It was
an ancient Jewish shekel, coined by the Maccabees.</p>
<p>It is needless to write further. Every antiquarian, every
numismatist, every student of history knows what that coin was.
It was one of the thirty pieces for which Judas Iscariot betrayed
his God.</p>
<p>He went out and slew himself. The high priest would not allow
'the price of blood' to return to the treasury, and marking each
piece with a cross, purchased with them a potter's field. They
paid the money to one Jabnael. Legend has it that before twelve
months had passed he died a horrible death. To Simon Magus some
of the money passed, and holy writ gives a succinct account of
his tragic end. And so on, down to Julian, each man who held one
of the fatal pieces was doomed. In time they became scattered,
and it was impossible to trace them; but I have no doubt but that
each one of those blood-stained thirty is still in the world,
bearing with it the curse of God. I have traced but the one.

GHOST</a></h2>
<p>Ever since there has been a ghost in the world, children have
been interested in them, but the only chance the little things
ever have of hearing about them is at night, when some
kind-hearted servant girl takes pity on them during the absence
of the old folk. Parents have frowned upon their children hearing
about ghosts and this may be in part because no properly written
ghost stories have ever been published for use in the nursery.
This is a great oversight on the part of literary caterers to the
children's page of the newspapers.</p>
<p>The following ghost story has been compiled for the purpose of
filling this long felt want and providing the nursery with a
genuine, simon-pure ghost story, to which no parent can
object.</p>
<p>There was once a family that had a ghost, more correctly
speaking, the house they lived in had one, for the family were
renters and the ghost was entailed with the house.</p>
<p>The ghost gave the various tenants a great deal of trouble,
and in consequence none of them had ever staid (stayed) very long
in it. People who rent like all the modern conveniences and
luxuries thrown in, but they do not like ghosts. They are airy
and keep such late hours. Still, every one who saw this
particular spirit had a sort of a kindly feeling for it, because
it was a baby ghost. People would rent the house, stay a night or
two, and see a baby in airy night clothes creeping about and
moaning dismally. Then they would leave. They never got angry at
the ghost, but they did at the landlord (who was an Irishman),
for not telling them that the place was rented already. As to the
spectral baby, they only felt sorry for it.</p>
<p>Still, they would not stay in the house.</p>
<p>The family under whose reign the ghost left the house was
named Otto&mdash;a good old German name such as I love to hear.
They had been in the house a week before they saw the ghost, for
it had been ill with colic and had to stay in bed.</p>
<p>But when it did appear, it created a sensation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Otto was for leaving at once. She said that she was not a
proud woman, but that she was exclusive. She did not mind
treating even a beggar politely, but when it came to receiving
people in her bed chamber she was compelled to be exclusive and
she drew the line on ghosts. Besides, she added, she did not need
a baby ghost, for she had several young infants already.</p>
<p>This caused a parley. The cook wept when she heard of the
manifestation, and said that the poor thing ought to be treated
kindly, for no doubt it had died unbaptized and so was compelled
'to walk.'</p>
<p>But then the ghost did not pass its nights in her bedroom.</p>
<p>But to the parley, which occurred at night, as all intelligent
persons well know, for a ghost never appears in the day time.
People could see through it too plainly then.</p>
<p>Well, the Otto family were all in bed, father and mother Otto
side by side, and the three little Ottos ranged in a row in the
trundle bed at the foot. All were asleep, and at 12 o'clock the
clock struck and all awoke.</p>
<p>Mamma Otto turned over and asked what the children wanted, and
father Otto turned over and asked why the little brats could not
keep still. Mamma Otto then began a curtain lecture, but it was
broken off suddenly and she cried:</p>
<p>"Oh, James, what is that?"</p>
<p>"By my soul," said James, "it is the baby ghost."</p>
<p>"Oh, mamma," screamed the three little Ottos, "see that baby
all in white like me! But, oh!&mdash;I can see right through it,
and it hasn't any insides. Who is it?"</p>
<p>Papa Otto looked out and saw the baby creeping around upon the
floor and making a moaning noise. He was tenderhearted toward
babies, but he did not feel particularly friendly toward their
ghosts. So his speech proved a mixture of tenderness and
roughness.</p>
<p>"Look here," he began quite fiercely&mdash;then:
"Chick-a-biddie, what do you want?"</p>
<p>At the first word the spectre did not pay any attention to
him, but at the magic baby words, "Chick-a-biddie," it looked
up.</p>
<p>"Dear 'ittle baby," said Mrs. Otto, trying to pacify it, "'ot
doo 'oo 'ont?"</p>
<p>"Shut up, you fool," exclaimed Mr. Otto. "Can't you talk sense
even in the face of a spectre? Let me talk."</p>
<p>"I say," he said to the white gown, which was now trying to
climb into bed with his children, "what do you want?"</p>
<p>"I 'ont a dwink."</p>
<p>"Good Lord! Have they nothing to drink where you live?"</p>
<p>"I 'ont to go to bed," continued the infant, not minding what
he said.</p>
<p>"Well, go to bed then," said Mr. Otto. "Who is keeping you
from it? Haven't you beds in your ghost world? Who are you,
anyhow?"</p>
<p>"I'm a baby ghost."</p>
<p>"So I know you are. But what do you want to be one for? Out
here in America we don't have ghosts unless there is some reason
for them. But you are so young, you never did anything wrong.
What reason have you for prowling around in this way?"</p>
<p>"I'm a baby ghost."</p>
<p>"A baby ghost!" repeated Mr. Otto, becoming excited. "What
excuse is there in that? If you're a ghost, you're a ghost, and
it don't make any difference what kind. One is as much a spirit
as another, even if it isn't quite so big. You don't have to come
here unless you want to."</p>
<p>"But where else can I go?"</p>
<p>"Where else can you go? Why, go home. Haven't you any friends
or relatives in the other world to take care of you?"</p>
<p>"My father was murdered in India and has 'to walk' there; my
mother was murdered in England, and has 'to walk' there; and I am
left an orphan ghost in America. Please tell me where I am to
walk and I will go there."</p>
<p>"Seems to me you talk pretty well for a baby. How comes it
that you can talk so plain when you want to?"</p>
<p>"Ghost babies know more than other babies."</p>
<p>"So I should think, and I believe you are shamming."</p>
<p>Well, the end of the parley was that the Ottos felt downright
sorry for the ghost, and would have done anything for it but let
it live with them.</p>
<p>"Why," said Mrs. Otto, "the next thing it would be coming to
me for its dinner."</p>
<p>As a compromise they at last agreed to let it crawl around on
the floor if it would not bother the children, but the ghost said
it liked babies above everything else, and would not live without
them.</p>
<p>"Then why don't you die?" said Mr. Otto.</p>
<p>"Because I can't."</p>
<p>"Then if you can't die, I guess you can live without
babies."</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose I can; but I won't."</p>
<p>That ended the parley, and the Ottos decided to move, not
because they disliked the ghost, but because the children did not
like it for a bed-fellow. Besides, it had such a dismal way of
moaning.</p>
<p>When the landlord, Mr. Mulligan, heard that his new tenants
were about to leave, he said:</p>
<p>"Oi wish the divil would take the cursed ghost an' be done wid
it. It's no good. It damages me property. It's bad. To h&mdash;l
wid it, Oi say!"</p>
<p>The ghost heard him and went to his house to live.</p>
<p>About I o'clock that night he called to it and asked what it
meant by coming over and bothering a decent man in that
manner.</p>
<p>"Because you cursed me," said the baby ghost naively, and then
fell to moaning and creeping about the floor again.</p>
<p>"Sure an' Oi did," said Mr. Mulligan. "But Oi'll fix ye
to-morrow."</p>
<p>There was no more sleep in that house the rest of the night,
but Mr. Mulligan did not pass his time parleying. A wise man was
Mr. Mulligan, and he had his plan.</p>
<p>Early in the morning he put on his hat and went over to Mr.
Otto's.</p>
<p>"Good-mornin' to yees," he said, quite politely. "Oi came to
speak to yees about yer ghost. An' how did yees rest last
noight?"</p>
<p>"Very well, indeed. Her babyship did not put in an appearance
at all."</p>
<p>"No wonder, and Oi'll tell ye why and perhaps give ye a
pointer that'll rid ye of it altogether. Ye know ghosts can be
exorcised. Oi knew one to be laid by Father O'Neill, over in owld
Ireland wonst. They can't stand a cursin'. Yesterday Oi got a bit
angry and as landlord of th' house gave this bit o' a spectre a
downright cursin' an' see, it did not appear to yees at all last
noight. Oi thought likely an' so came over to see about it. Now,
phat Oi would riccommind would be this&mdash;that yees do the
same and curses all the curses ye can think of on th' poor
thing's head."</p>
<p>That night Mr. Mulligan went to bed chuckling to himself over
his scheme, and fell asleep with the conscience of a man who will
see no ghosts. But not long did he sleep before he was awakened
by a low cry.</p>
<p>"The divil take the brat. Phat does it want now? Pat, shut
your noise."</p>
<p>But Pat did not shut his noise, and Mr. Mulligan rolled out of
bed in a passion. There at his feet was the baby ghost crawling
about and moaning in a most heartrending manner.</p>
<p>"Oi beg your pardon," Mr. Mulligan said; "Oi didn't know it
was you. Oi thought it was that boy Pat and got up to give him a
batin'. Phat can Oi do for me little leddy?"</p>
<p>But the 'little leddy' made no reply.</p>
<p>The next morning the first thing Mr. Mulligan did was to hurry
over to Mr. Otto's a second time to inquire why he had not
exorcised the ghost. When he learned that Mr. Otto had done his
best at heaping curses upon the poor baby's head he was
completely non-plussed.</p>
<p>"Phat was the matter with the scheme?" he said to himself. "It
was a good one, Oi know. Something must hev gone wrong."</p>
<p>That night was a repetition of the two previous ones, with the
exception that Mr. Mulligan, knowing what he might expect,
decided to sit up and await the arrival of the new addition to
his family. Promptly on time the 'little leddy' appeared.</p>
<p>"An' phat can Oi do for your leddyship this avenin'," said he
very politely, hoping to get on the good side of the ghost.</p>
<p>"I 'on't to go out."</p>
<p>"Go out, is it?" said Mr. Mulligan, with alacrity. "Sure,
then, ye can, me darlin', and welcome," and he opened wide the
door. But the baby never moved an inch.</p>
<p>"It's cold out there," it moaned and started to creep under
the bed clothes with the children.</p>
<p>"Howly Vargin presarve us," cried Mr. Mulligan. "It's going to
scare the poor children to death. Get out of there, ye spalpeen.
What are yees doing here anyhow? Why aren't ye over hantin' Mr.
Otto. Indade he towld me this mornin' that he cursed ye
royally."</p>
<p>"So he did," replied the baby ghost, as it crept from the
trundle bed and lay down by the fire.</p>
<p>"Warmin's its shins, by the howly Moses!" ejaculated Mr.
Mulligan, "though how it can do that same Oi can't see." Then to
the baby:</p>
<p>"But how comes it that ye are here and not over there if Mr.
Otto cursed ye?"</p>
<p>"You put him up to it."</p>
<p>"Oh, murder! Then Oi'm to have ye here in the house wid me
until Oi die!"</p>
<p>"And maybe afterward."</p>
<p>"But suppose Oi move away?"</p>
<p>"I will go with you."</p>
<p>"St. Patrick an' all the sants, hear that, will ye! An' can Oi
do nothing to get ye to lave?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm a baby ghost. My father was murdered in India and has
'to walk' there; my mother was murdered in England and has 'to
walk' there, and I am left an orphan ghost in America with no one
to take care of me," and the baby ghost began to cry.</p>
<p>"Whist! whist! Don't cry," said the kind-hearted man. "Don't
cry, an' we will try to fix up something for ye. Can't ye
sleep?"</p>
<p>"Ess," replied the ghost, calmed by his words and dropping
back into baby language. "Ess, in the daytime."</p>
<p>"Well, suppose we fit up a noice little room wid a bed in it,
couldn't ye git along doorin' th' noight alone?"</p>
<p>"No, no. I want to be with the babies. I'm a baby myself."</p>
<p>Well, they kept it up all night without coming to an
agreement, Mr. Mulligan making offers and the baby ghost finding
excuses, so that by morning the former was too tired to work and
too nervous to sleep. As a final resort he called upon Mr. Otto.
His manner was not quite so hilarious as usual, but he did not
forget his customary politeness.</p>
<p>"An' how did ye rest, Mr. Otto?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Very well, indeed, Mr. Mulligan, and I must thank you for it.
Your advice was good. The ghost hasn't been in the house for two
days."</p>
<p>"Indade, an' Oi'm delighted to hear it. But O'im sorry,
too."</p>
<p>"Why so?" asked Mr. Otto in surprise.</p>
<p>"Because that same ghost has come to live wid me. It doesn't
cost much for board, but Oi wouldn't room it for a fortune, not
if Oi had a palace an' rooms to throw away. Indeed an' Oi don't
know phat to do."</p>
<p>"With you, is it? Well, well. What made it go to you?"</p>
<p>"Oi can't say, but Oi'm thinking it has a likin' for me
youngest gurl, Maggie, (ah, she's a swate crature). But Oi can't
stand it! And the thing has promised to sthay wid me all me life
and go into th' spirit world wid me."</p>
<p>"You won't mind it so much, then."</p>
<p>"Thrue for you, Mr. Otto. But how'm Oi to git along in th'
meantime?"</p>
<p>"I tell you what, I will go over to your house to-night, and
we will try to induce the thing to go over to England to its
mother."</p>
<p>"Oi always sed yer honor had a clear head. Oi'll be expectin's
ye."</p>
<p>That night, according to promise, Mr. Otto passed at the
Mulligan residence, and prompt on time the spectre appeared.</p>
<p>After a very polite salutation on the part of Mr. Mulligan,
Mr. Otto asked the ghost if it did not think it would like to see
its mother, and if so, how it would like a trip across the water
to England.</p>
<p>The ghost said that was just what it would like to do.</p>
<p>"Then ye shall start to-morrow," cried Mr. Mulligan
impetuously.</p>
<p>"Who will go with me?"</p>
<p>"Who will go wid you?" said the astonished man. "Why, you will
go alone, of course."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid to go alone."</p>
<p>And there they had to leave it.</p>
<hr class="short">
<p>And did Mr. Mulligan have to be haunted all the rest of his
life by the baby ghost?</p>
<p>Oh, no; he got rid of it.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>He engaged steerage passage and took it over to England
himself.</p>

<p>Thursday, June 1, 18&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<p>I never did fancy the idea of staying in the city until driven
out by heat. I am going to Lake Superior next week. For June is
the most delightful month in the year to spend in the country, so
why wait until August, and exchange a month of pleasure for mere
comfort? I prefer being sensible to being fashionable, and so go
north by Tuesday.</p>
<p>Roy goes with me. It seems strange I should pick up a boy I
have not known three months, and take him off as my companion for
the summer. But then, if we are satisfied, I do not know as it
concerns any one else; he was delighted with the idea, and his
father gave consent&mdash;so we go. Roy is a little black eyed,
black haired school boy I met here in Schenectady soon after, in
my Bohemian wandering, I settled down in the place. A new fancy
has taken me away now, and it takes Roy with me.</p>
<p>Thursday, June 8.</p>
<p>To-day we reached our camping ground, Roy and I. We left the
train at the lazy little village of Chickar, and there chartered
an old horse and spring wagon to bring us and our traps down to
the lake. Our camp is in a beautiful place. The cool pine forest
extends to the shore, which at the particular spot we have chosen
to pitch our tent upon, slopes gently down to the water. Half a
mile further on the banks are high and steep, and the pine trees
are growing on top of the bluff fifty feet from the waves.
To-morrow night I shall take the boat and ride out for a
moonlight view of those sentinels.</p>
<p>I find a boy can be of considerable use, Roy especially. In
fact, I fear he did more work to-day than I, peace to his tired
limbs?</p>
<p>We reached the lake about noon, and, after eating a lunch, set
out to look for a location. I should have chosen the bluffs, but
Roy argued me into stopping here within easy reach of the water.
Before we leave, however, I intend to have my own way about it,
and go up and down those bluffs on a rope ladder. After lunch we
put up our tent, and Roy carried rocks and built a fireplace,
while I (having just resurrected 'Consolation' from the bottom of
my trunk) sat under a pine tree and smoked. After the tent was
up, and a small flag stuck on top by the boy, and our goods
stored away, we took a stroll around the place and down to the
water. While in Chickar I ordered a boat to be sent around
to-morrow. It is late, and I will stop.</p>
<p>Friday, June 9.</p>
<p>The boat came to-day, and the man who came with it brought us
some bread and our mail. The boat had no name, and (as I have
found I shall be compelled to do in everything) I consulted the
boy as to the one we should give it.</p>
<p>"Don't men sometimes name boats after women?" he asked, in
reply to my inquiry.</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, wondering what he was driving at.</p>
<p>"Then I say, name it Daisy Dalrymple."</p>
<p>Daisy is a young girl friend of his. I met her while in
Schenectady. She is a fairly good-looking girl, about 17 years
old, has a good form, red lips and cheeks, smooth forehead, well
shaped nose (I always look at the nose), and deep, girlish brown
eyes and brown hair. Besides this, she wears a jaunty little hat
that becomes her. I probably would not have noticed this last if
she had not exchanged with another girl one day, and I wondered
that I had bestowed a second glance upon a girl with no more
taste, although why I should have given it a passing thought I
don't know. The two went to school together and were great
friends&mdash;Roy and her, I mean. I like to watch these boy and
girl friendships, they are so free from suspicion and full of
happiness. Let them enjoy themselves. After a year or so they
will have enough of scheming and deceit. Let life have some of
honest love for them.</p>
<p>But I'm straying from the boat. Of course I vetoed such a
name. Not that I really object to it very much as a name, but how
would it sound if that boy should write home (as he would be sure
to do) and tell his father that the boat we sailed in every day
had been christened 'Daisy,' after Daisy Dalrymple. Besides, come
to think of it, I don't want to name a boat after her.</p>
<p>Tuesday, June 13.</p>
<p>The youngster has been swinging in his hammock between the two
pines he chose as his own when we first pitched our tent here,
and now that he has dropped off into sleep, I have lighted
'Consolation' anew and will write up the day. There isn't much
worth chronicling. We botanized until evening, and then after
supper went down to the shore and pushed out the 'Kelpie' for a
float on the lake. It was the first ride we have taken together
in the evening, except when fishing. But to-night we went out for
pleasure, and so, after having rowed some distance from land, we
leaned back and let the boat rock on the waves while we enjoyed
the twilight. There is more in that boy than I thought. In fact,
I am beginning to believe, that down deep in every boy there is
hidden what we rarely consider him capable of possessing. Anyhow,
Roy enjoyed that twilight on the lake more genuinely than any
grown person of my acquaintance would. The moon rose while we
were out, and, actually, as we rocked in the great, broad stream
of light which fell upon the waves, that boy spoke of it as the
golden ( I cannot say for certain whether it was golden or
silver) road up to heaven, and suggested the idea of how
beautiful it would be if the gates of heaven were really open out
there at the horizon, and that flood of light flowing out of
them, and we rowing up the road to the eternal gates. Now, I
never would have thought of that! Why is it? Has his religious
education been so much better than mine? Hardly. It must be that
I have lived a worldly life so long these things have dropped
out. But when I asked him if he was ready to row across and out
into the infinite beyond, his boyish nature asserted itself over
the spiritual, and he shook his head.</p>
<p>"No; not until our vacation is over." Alas? school is not
paradise to boys!</p>
<p>The twilight and the moonlight made us confidential, and,
while resting out there, I told him my story of Francesca. Not as
having any connection with myself, though! I have too much desire
to keep his respect to place myself before his eyes in the light
of a deceived man. So I told him of my trust and her deceit as if
it had been the story of some third party I had met in my
wanderings. But I can't help feeling that those boyish eyes
changed during the story, and that, if not fully confident, he
has a pretty good idea of who the hero was. I must take steps
to-morrow to relieve him of any such ideas. Oh, yes, one more
item.</p>
<p>When I had finished I looked at him, lying back in the stern
of the boat, and asked:</p>
<p>"Well, what do you think of her?" and that boy said:</p>
<p>"I think Daisy Dalrymple wouldn't have done so?"</p>
<p>Confound the boy! I believe he really loves that girl.</p>
<p>We have been here a week. Roy is developing a new trait. He is
becoming affectionate! Actually he has laid his head upon my
shoulder twice in the last two days. I like it. I am not very
affectionate, but a boy I do like, and a boy's love I would
rather have than anything else, for a boy's love is honest and
genuine. You know just how far you can depend upon him. If he
likes you, he will seek your company; if you lose your wealth or
friends, it makes no difference to him; he will stick to you.
What a pity it is there are no more boys in the world! For, take
them as they are, rich or poor, dressed in broadcloth or rags, a
genuine boy is something to tie to.</p>
<p>Saturday, June 17.</p>
<p>To-day the fisherman came around again with his bread and
mail. Among the letters was one for Roy, and the writing I
noticed looked very much like a note I saw once with 'Daisy'
signed to it. Wonder if it is from her? We are living a very
quiet life now. We hunt and fish and botanize. Roy is getting
along famously at the latter. Besides, we do some reading, have
finished 'Pickwick,' 'Ivanhoe' and 'Alhambra,' and are now half
way through 'David Copperfield.' I, having read it before, prefer
the character of David, but Roy is fascinated with J. Steerforth.
Well, isn't it all right? Steerforth had many noble qualities. He
sinned, it is true, but&mdash;let us do as he asked, and think of
him at his best! I asked Roy if the character of Agnes reminded
him of any one, and expected him as usual to bring up the name of
that girl of his, Daisy. But he simply said "No!" And that
reminds me, he hasn't mentioned her name since that night on the
lake when I told him of Francesca and my wandering life on
account of her. But he stares at me at times, with his wondering
black eyes, in a way I don't like. I verily believe his boy wits
have fathomed my story.</p>
<p>Tuesday, June 28.</p>
<p>To-day Roy asked me a question that has set me to wondering
again. What a boy he is! We were out fishing, and he was silent
almost the whole afternoon, but just as we were preparing to go
back to shore, he burst out all of a sudden with:</p>
<p>"Say, Mr. Dallas, suppose a girl&mdash;who is a good
girl&mdash;if a girl should love a man&mdash;a man who is good
and noble also&mdash;and be true to him&mdash;and that man should
know of it&mdash;what ought he to do?"</p>
<p>"Never suppose such a case, my boy," I calmly replied. "Girls
don't love&mdash;they speculate. Everyone speculates. Men in
stocks; girls in men. You don't know them!"</p>
<p>"But," he persisted, in his boyish way, "suppose she should
love him&mdash;truly&mdash;all her life, and never give him
up?"</p>
<p>"What has made you grow sentimental all at once, Bub? Has
Daisy proposed to you? Don't trust them," I continued, in a
fatherly way; "they are all frauds; she won't love you long. You
are young now, and trustful, and I don't like to give the thing
away to you, but you must learn it some time. Never think a girl
will love you as you love her. It is simply absurd! She will only
stand by you and fool you until she finds a richer man or&mdash;a
bigger fool. There, don't be offended&mdash;no insult intended,
my boy. Those books we have been reading have put too much
nonsense in your head, I see, and we must stop them. Love your
Daisy as much as you want to. You will get over it in time, and
no harm will be done." This last I said as I saw the poor boy was
actually feeling badly.</p>
<p>He did not say any more until we were near the shore. Then he
took it up again in the same hesitating manner.</p>
<p>"Aren't men deceived by bad women sometimes, and don't that
make them distrustful of others who may be good?"</p>
<p>"At that still, are you? What can be the matter with the boy!
Love your Daisy if you want to," I said, sorry for the boy's
feelings being so tender. "Love your Daisy. I will take it all
back and swear by the sun, moon and stars that she will be true
to you&mdash;as long as you want her to! There, does that not set
your mind at rest?"</p>
<p>"I know it without your swearing," he quietly answered, as we
pulled the boat up on the sand and started for camp.</p>
<p>Wednesday, July 6.</p>
<p>I have smoked three pipes and am now cool enough to write.
To-day we were out in the boat, and by some blunder or other it
upset. Before I could get the water out of my mouth and eyes and
get my bearings, Roy was several rods away. I swam to him, got
him on my back and swam to land. He had a good drenching, but
that was all. He sat by the camp-fire drying his clothes. I
noticed from my pine tree, where I sat smoking, that he carefuly
held a sheet of paper near the flame. I watched the boy
curiously, he seemed so very important. After it was dry, he got
up, came over to me, and putting the paper in my hand, said:</p>
<p>"I wish you would read that, I think you ought to know what is
in it," and went back to his place by the fire.</p>
<p>I opened the paper and found this letter, written in a round,
girlish hand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Dear Roy,</p>
<p>Your letter, telling me about your camp and how you live, came
a few days ago, and I have brought some paper to school to write
to you on, and will answer it before recess. I hope Miss Knapp
won't see me, for if she does there will be another lecture, and
lectures are tiresome in hot weather. But, then, school is out
this week. Everything is quiet as usual. Jack was turned out of
school the week after you left, and Harry has no recess the rest
of the term, because they tied a cat up to the bell rope by the
tail. I am glad you are enjoying yourself. I often think of what
a happy time you must have, and, Roy, I wish you would tell me
all about Mr. Dallas, for, Roy, I believe I love him, love him,
love him better than my life. Do come back soon and&mdash;here
comes Mrs. Knapp! Good-by.</p>
<p>Your friend,</p>
<p>"Daisy."</p>

<p>That was the end of it all! I got up and went over to the boy,
and put my arm around him, and he responded by putting his arm on
my shoulder and laying his cheek against mine.</p>
<p>Tuesday, July 7.</p>
<p>We start for Schenectady to-morrow. The fact is, I don't like
to run the risk of having Roy drowned, and so I have agreed to go
to Chickar to-night, send a man for our tent, and take the early
train for home in the morning. Think I will try one summer in the
city for a change!</p>

<h2>The End.</h2>

<h1>Penelope.</h1>
<h3>By</h3>
<h2>CHARLES CURTZ HAHN.</h2>
<hr>
<h2><a name="PENELOPE" id="PENELOPE">PENELOPE.</a></h2>
<p>"Robert," said Aunt Christine to her brother, "I want to speak
to you about that girl. I am all out of patience with her."</p>
<p>"What has poor Nell been doing now?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. That is the trouble. Nothing, when she ought to be
getting married, or getting ready to do so."</p>
<p>"Perhaps she doesn't wish to," answered Uncle Rob, with a
light laugh at his sister's vehemence.</p>
<p>"That's it! Here she is, rich, good-looking and intelligent,
and at the age of 26 still unmarried; and when I spoke to her
to-day about Senator Tredennis and Lord Richland, wanting to know
which she intended to marry, she quietly informed me that she
hadn't the slightest intention of marrying any one at present!
Sometimes I wish that uncle of hers had not left her that money.
I shouldn't have so much to worry over if she were the poor girl
she was ten years ago."</p>
<p>"By the way, I wonder where she is?"</p>
<p>"In the parlor refusing Lord Richland very likely."</p>
<p>"Well, suppose I go and stop it?"</p>
<p>He smiled to himself as he walked down the piazza, at the
novel idea of him preventing anything Helen wanted to do. Helen,
who had been his pet from the time she had waded bare-footed in
the surf and built mimic forts in the sand!</p>
<p>But Aunt Christine was wrong in her surmise this time, for
when her brother entered the parlor he found it occupied by both
the Senator and the Lord, as well as Helen. She was more
beautiful than ever, thought Uncle Robert as he looked at her.
And still it would be difficult to name in what her beauty
consisted. Her face was fair, but no more. And yet there was
something about her which compelled one to admire. Perhaps it was
her uniform ladylike calmness and reserve. There are some women
who can so hedge themselves in with pride that men will worship
them as divine. Helen was busy with a mass of blue and white
floss, deftly weaving them into some fancy work, and Mr. Alison,
as he stood at the door, heard the Senator saying:</p>
<p>"We used to wonder in Washington what it was Miss Winter was
knitting. Col. Monks once said it reminded him of Penelope's web;
at least it was never finished."</p>
<p>Mr. Alison was surprised to see a delicate color spread over
the girl's face as if the remark had touched her heart.</p>
<p>After a few minutes the two gentlemen stepped out upon the
piazza and left Mr. Alison and his niece alone.</p>
<p>"Now," thought Mr. Alison, "is the time to have it over."</p>
<p>"Helen," he began solemnly, but Helen slipped her hand into
his arm, and by a pleading look quite put to flight all ideas of
rebuke he might have had.</p>
<p>"There, Uncle Robert, I know all you intend saying. Aunt has
been talking to you. Are you going to turn against me, too?"</p>
<p>"Just as I knew it would be," said Mr. Alison. "I came in with
all sorts of arguments ready&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"For the California mansion or the English castle? Be at rest
concerning the first; I do not fancy the land of oranges."</p>
<p>"And the castle? Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Uncle," said Helen, quietly, "I do not love either of them.
Would you have me marry them without love? I have a home; I need
not marry for that." And to Mr. Alison's surprise again a tear
fell upon his hand as she bent over and kissed him.</p>
<p>"Can it be Col. Monks," he wondered to himself, but only said
aloud:</p>
<p>"Forgive me, dear, and we will drop the subject. And by the
way, I have a new acquaintance for you. I used to know him years
ago when you were a child, but for the last five years he has
been in Australia. Lately he returned, and to-day I met him down
at the Cliff House, he is boarding there for a few weeks while
making some studies along the shore."</p>
<p>For the second time, that evening, the delicate color flushed
over the girl's face, and her uncle went away deeply puzzled at
such an unusual circumstance. Helen stood for a moment where he
had left her and then walked across the room and looked at her
image in the long mirror.</p>
<p>"Penelope's web!" she said, softly: "I wonder if she kept her
beauty all those twenty years of waiting! Five years are not so
long, and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;I wonder if my web will ever be
done. Am I giving up my life to a fancy? How aunt would cut me if
she knew! Five years for a fancy." Then, as she turned to leave
the room, "If five years, then it will be a life."</p>
<p>That night Judge Mammon gave a ball. Helen had just been
dancing with one of her twenty suitors, and at her request had
been led back to her aunt's chair. Mr. Alison was just presenting
a friend to his sister, and then, turning suddenly, John
Warrington looked into the face he had been dreaming of for
years.</p>
<p>"Mr. Warrington and I hardly need an introduction," said Helen
gracefuly, extending her hand as she spoke. Again Mr. Alison was
nonplussed, and his faint suspicion vanished. How was he to know
that every nerve in the girl's body was tingling, and that it
required all the effort she could exert, in spite of her years of
training in coldness, to make the greeting calmly.</p>
<p>Could it be that five long years had passed since she had
gazed into those earnest eyes, or heard the quiet voice saying,
precisely as so often long ago, "Are you happy to-night, Miss
Winters?" Why had he chosen these words for his greeting? she
found herself asking over and over. And as she stood silent for a
moment, dimly conscious that her aunt was making one of her
quaint speeches to the old friend, and that Lord Richland was at
her side claiming her hand for the next waltz, a scene flashed
before her eyes which carried her back to childhood.</p>
<p>There was a quiet stretch of beach and the ocean rolling up at
her feet; in the background a tumbled-down house&mdash;her
home&mdash;and she, herself, a bare-footed girl, playing with
sand and waves, happy as the day was long. An artist, who
consituted her world outside her home, sketching sea and land.
She stopped to wonder if he remembered a certain picture he drew
once of a little girl standing upon the shore and looking out
over the sea. He had given it to her, and she had preserved it
all these years.</p>
<p>The memory of happy days upon the sunny beach suddenly gave
way to another. A room in the tumbled-down house, and in it a
little girl tossing restlessly upon a bed and moaning in
delirious fever. The village doctor standing helplessly by; her
poor old father crying quietly to himself. The artist enters the
room and kneels by her bed. She seems at once to realize his
presence. He takes her hand and speaks to her, lowly but
earnestly. His voice recalls her from her wondering, as it had
called her to him so many times before when wandering upon the
beach. To-night the music of the dream-waltz they were playing
seemed a fitting accompaniment to those words which were still
ringing in her ears&mdash;"Do not worry any more, Helen; rest and
be happy." In all her life afterward she had never once thought
of the words as being strange.</p>
<p>"Happy!" That seemed to be the burden of his wishes for her,
and she, tired child, obeyed the call, and rested, happy, because
he was with her.</p>
<p>And now she was a woman, and, thanks to an uncle she had never
seen, the belle of the season. Ah, the belle of the season,
thinking her wealth would be well spent could she but bring back
that happy life!</p>
<p>It was only for a moment. Then she spoke to Warrington.</p>
<p>"Have you finished your picture?" she asked.</p>
<p>He smiled, as if it were the most commonplace remark, instead
of one bridging over a gulf of five years.</p>
<p>"How quickly you go back to our old life, as if we had parted
but yesterday. No, I have not finished it. As you know, I went to
Australia soon after I saw you last, and there I did not use my
brush much. Besides, I could not finish the picture," and he
broke off abruptly.</p>
<p>"You will tell me why some time, perhaps," she said softly.
"Tell me now what you have been doing."</p>
<p>Many times had John Warrington run over in his mind the manner
in which he would meet this girl and tell her why his career as
an artist had been broken so suddenly, and these years spent in
business. It was one of the bright dreams of his Australian life.
But fate had willed differently from what he hoped.</p>
<p>"My story is short, little Helen." He called her by her old
name, placing them again in the position of child and man, and
she liked it. "I went out to seek my fortune. Found it. Lost it.
And have come back as poor as I went. Now I begin with my brush
where I left off five years ago."</p>
<p>"Left off five years ago!" she repeated to herself. They stood
silent for a moment, he thinking of the barrier between them
which his five years had meant to break down, and she wondering
if that old 'rest and happiness' was never to be realized
again.</p>
<p>Then Aunt Christine claimed Warrington's attention, and they
parted.</p>
<p>Warrington's success during the next six months made him often
question whether it would not have been better had he remained at
his studio instead of dropping five years of his life across the
seas. The world needs but a little start to send it worshiping,
and good Mr. Alison put it in motion toward Warrington&mdash;that
is, the part of it represented by the city in which he had
established his studio.</p>
<p>One day a party of friends visited him. Helen and Lord
Richland were among the number, and the latter had determined to
know his fate before he left the studio. The answer he received
was the same that Penelope gave to all her suitors, but he was so
thoroughly in earnest that Helen was sorry for him and gave him
her hand. He stooped to kiss it, and then Helen saw that
Warrington was standing in the entrance to the room. He turned
away immediately, but Helen called to him.</p>
<p>"Mr. Warrington, will you show us the picture you have just
completed?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," he answered. "It is in this room;" and, drawing
aside a curtain, displayed a picture still resting upon the
easel.</p>
<p>"It is called 'Penelope,'" he said, quietly.</p>
<p>Helen gave one look at the canvas and her face turned
crimson.</p>
<p>Not the Queen herself could have been more lovely than the
face portrayed upon the canvas, and yet, idealized through it
all, she saw herself. Once, long ago, Warrington had spoken of
her knitting as a perfect 'Penelope's web,' and had begun the
picture which was unfinished when she received her fortune and he
departed for Australia.</p>
<p>The painting came to her like a revelation, and as the party
was about to leave she went up to Warrington and said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Warrington, will you please make no disposal of your last
picture until you see me again? Will you call to-morrow?"</p>
<p>He looked surprised, but assented. Was it to tell him of her
engagement, he wondered.</p>
<p>Helen was sitting in the library when he came the next
afternoon, and he noticed that her work was in her hands. She was
too deeply in earnest to talk of common topics, but went directly
to her subject.</p>
<p>"Mr. Warrington, do you remember a little sketch you made
nearly fifteen years ago? You gave it to me, and now I want your
'Penelope' to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What picture?" he asked; "not the one I drew of you upon the
beach?"</p>
<p>She handed it to him.</p>
<p>"And you have kept this all these years? Do you really care
for it, little Helen? Do you ever think of those days now? You
were but a child then, but I would give all my life to live that
summer over again. I never thought I should be so mad as to say
this. I have loved you ever since that happy summer when I
brought you back to life. Then, when this fortune came to you,
being proud, I went away. I could not bear the name of having
been a fortune-hunter, and was afraid you would think, as others
would, should I, a poor, penniless artist, ask you to be my
wife&mdash;and I would not stand that! I went away hoping to be
able to come to you without a shadow of doubt. I came back as
poor as I went. I finished my picture, thinking it would be my
renunciation, and when I saw you and Richland in the studio I
knew it was so. But now I cannot help telling you I have loved
you, and you will believe me now, will you not, little
Helen?"</p>
<p>"You told me once to be happy, and I obeyed you, because you
were with me. Why have you not trusted me long ago?"</p>
<p>"Trust you? You do not mean, Helen, that you have loved me all
these years? I dare not believe it! Others have wooed
you&mdash;others far better than I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, dear, but Penelope waited for Ulysses!"</p>

SHE DO?</a></h2>
<br>
<h3>I.&mdash;AN OLD MANUSCRIPT.</h3>
<p>I am a newspaper reporter and a poor one at that, I sometimes
think as I examine my not very plethoric pocketbook.</p>
<p>A few years ago the <i>Daily Capital,</i> published in Topeka,
changed management, and among other schemes of the newly
organized company was one to establish a branch office in Kansas
City. Being out of work, and having some influence with the
business manager, I secured the position and was sent down to
take charge of the new venture.</p>
<p>My office was in the Chamber of Commerce and I occupied a room
with two grain men and a dealer in pork. Desk room had been
secured for me, and a neat sign placed on the door beneath the
others, calling the attention of visitors to the fact that within
could be found the representative of the Topeka <i>Capital,</i>
who was ready at all times to receive them in every capacity. My
duties were various. Each morning I noted the various changes on
'Change, and each afternoon took a trip to the stockyards to note
the state of the market there, all of which observations were
duly telegraphed to the Topeka paper in the evening. In addition
to this I was expected twice a week to write a commercial letter
giving the exact state of the markets of the world and
prognosticating the same for a week to come. Then there was a
daily news letter, the use of the 'wire' in case of emergency (I
was the Associated Press reporter), and the soliciting of
advertisements.</p>
<p>With all this on my shoulders little else could be expected,
and yet I found time for one little affair which came to my
knowledge and which I now propose to give to the public. When I
was installed in my office I was given an old, time stained desk
which had once done duty in the editorial rooms of the <i>Kansas
City Times.</i> There were a number of old papers in the drawers,
and one day after returning to the office a little earlier than
usual I began clearing them out. Among many worthless newspaper
scraps (evidently laid away by some reporter for future use) I
found the following manuscripts, which I sent to my chief for
publication and which I here insert.</p>
<h3>II.&mdash;THE HAUNTED HOUSE.</h3>
<p>[Written for the Sunday Capital.]</p>
<p>It was under no ghostly circumstances that I first saw the
place&mdash;that is, after it became haunted.</p>
<p>Fifteen years in India had made me feel almost like a stranger
in my own land, and after a brief visit to the remnants that were
left of my family, I took the first train for a little hamlet in
Ohio whither I proposed bringing my household gods and settling
down to pass the remainder of my life in peace.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful morning and I came upon the house in the
early sunlight.</p>
<p>It was built upon the colonial plan, with a mixture of Swede
and Norwegian; the founder evidently had first built a square
house of four rooms, with an immense hall running through it, and
afterward added a hen coop here and a dormer window there, a
lean-to on the left and a "T" on the right, until he had but to
slope the roof down to the hillside and the house was complete.
It may have been a model of architecture once, but it most
assuredly was a first-class model of inconvenience and
uncleanness then. The whole place was sadly neglected. The gate
was broken, the fence demoralized, and the garden grown up with
weeds. The orchard was unpruned and the ground strewn with dead
branches; the stable dilapidated and the fields barren. But none
of these makes a house ghostly.</p>
<p>There are three circumstances under which a house will seem
supernatural, but it must not be gone to ruin. On the contrary, a
field of grain ready to cut, but with no reapers in it; a neat
yard and a house in good order, with all the necessities of life
in it, standing solitary and silent on a hot August day when the
sunlight comes down in a shower of blinding rays&mdash;such a
place will, in my opinion, make the most courageous speak in low
and reverent tones. The family, one may know, have only gone to
the village to lay in their week's supply of groceries, but the
effect is the same.</p>
<p>The other hours are at night or early morning, when the house
is full of loved ones. There is something awful in passing by the
face of a sleeper, and, looking upon that quiet face which knows
us not, to be conscious that our nearest and dearest is, though
bodily present, far away, wandering in the realms of the unknown;
entering the field of spirits, meeting, perhaps, with angels whom
we know not. Added to this feeling of care, which steals over one
as he contemplates the face of the sleeper, comes also a slight
tinge of jealousy and of fear, lest when the sleeper does awaken
the dream visitants may not leave the friend of yesterday exactly
the same to-day; we are conscious also that the other part of our
life, lying there so silent, is now in that oblivion, the type of
the deeper one we all must enter later! For her lying there, the
world is nothing. The book is finished, the music silent, the
work done! It is as if she were not.</p>
<p>This sensation will come at any time when we gaze upon the
sleeping faces of a household, but more strongly does it come in
the early hours of morning light. Coming into the room, ready for
work, we feel the sleepers should be back in the world also, and
are surprised that they are not; and because they do not respond
to our silent presence by awakening we shudder and draw back.</p>
<p>A house with no one in it may be ghostly, but it must be as
nearly human as possible. If there are no traces of human hands
about, the spectres of the departed are not near so easily
conjured up.</p>
<p>So, as I said, it was under no ghostly circumstances that I
saw the house; in the cool autumn morning it seemed as
commonplace as any other rickety shed. Yet I knew it was
haunted!</p>
<p>I went on by to the next farm house. They, also, knew it was
haunted. I did not need to ask the question from the farmer who
was just coming from the barn, but I did. He looked at me, shook
his head, leaned up against a convenient tree, and answered:</p>
<p>"I say nothing."</p>
<p>"Then you know it is?"</p>
<p>"Well, I wouldn't live in it."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>In a slow, matter-of-fact manner he went on, without a
particle of emotion, or a shade of emphasis, as if he were
repeating a half-learned lesson.</p>
<p>"If I wanted all the doors opened with no one to open them,
and tramping overhead and in the next room, and lights and white
objects flitting around, why, then, I would!" From which I
gathered that all these things were in the habit of occurring in
the old place.</p>
<p>"Something is seen, then?" I said. "What is it? What causes
the racket?"</p>
<p>"A woman in white."</p>
<p>"Have you seen her?"</p>
<p>The man crossed himself and said nothing, which imparted to me
the information that he was a Roman Catholic, and superstitious.
It also left me in doubt as to whether he had seen her, and
crossed himself lest she should again appear, or whether he had
not, but feared that on mention she might come up and stand
between us to reprove me for my lightness.</p>
<p>But I took the house, or rather moved into it, for I already
held the deed, and that week found us comfortably settled.
Comfortably, did I say? In a manner.</p>
<p>It was late October. Already the leaves were putting on their
dying colors of red and scarlet or turning into autumn brown.
Besides the family (my aunt and myself) I brought with me a deaf
man of all work (an Englishman), a cook, and a waiter girl.
Together we went over the house, I taking the lead as lord and
master, and John bringing up the rear. Into the parlor, with its
faded grandeur, and into the sitting room, now bleak and bare as
an old granary; into the bedrooms, with their torn paper and
shaky windows, and into the long dining room, with its walnut
casing and broken cement.</p>
<p>Mixed up with rooms and halls were queer little alcoves and
closets and wardrobes, stairs and lofts, scattered about
promiscuously and in the most unexpected places. Upstairs there
was the same air of decay and loneliness. But I must confess that
a different feeling came over me when I approached a little room
at the rear of the house. It was an unseemly, uncomfortable
looking place, with one window opening out upon the kitchen roof
and making an easy escape to the hill back of the house. When I
opened the door, the room was empty; yet even to my unimaginative
mind came a dim feeling of awe, as if I were suddenly stepping
back into the past. The thought of ghosts did not enter my head,
yet I felt as if the room was not empty. It looked as if there
was something in it. This was the room the lady in white visited.
So, at least, said the farmer. I chose it for my bedroom.</p>
<p>For the better preservation of peace in the house we had
agreed to say nothing to the servants about its ghosts. But
before night we had got into a perfectly supernatural groove, in
which we seemed very likely to run the rest of our sojourn.</p>
<p>I had an idea that I kept all outsiders away, but catching a
glimpse of my Romish neighbor's wife slipping out of the shed and
cautiously winding her way around the hill, I understood that all
my precautions had been in vain. The cook and the waiter knew it!
The house was haunted! By an hour after dark the latter had seen
eyes gleaming at her out of the misty corner of the great hall,
and she began developing strange physical faculties I had never
dreamed one small woman could possess. Before supper was served
the traces of a white robe fluttering from my bedroom window had
been seen by the cook, though what possessed her to go out on the
hill and gaze up over the kitchen roof at my window, I never
could fathom. And our meal, which I always want to eat in peace,
was twice broken in upon by the strange actions of the waiter,
who suddenly became afflicted with a disagreeable habit of
stiffening from her toes upward at the most unexpected moment,
and remaining with eyes fixed upon me in the most deadly manner
imaginable, until we resuscitated her. Both times, Jane, the
cook, was called in to administer restoratives, and each time was
found diluting herself with tears and murmuring about the
ghost.</p>
<p>So we went on. "Woman in white!" According to the waiter and
cook, there were fifty of them, and not confining themselves to
their proper sporting place, my bedroom, they swarmed over and
filled the whole house. The cook has seen her wandering around in
the outhouse at the same instant that the waiter stiffened over
her white robes in the dusky parlor.</p>
<p>Noises! I myself have sat in the parlor and heard such noises
as nothing but Bedlam could have produced, I thought. The whole
house would take a streak of groaning and creaking and I could
have sworn that I heard steps overhead. So matters went on from
bad to worse. The servants were continually going around ready
primed for a swoon at any minute, and I can vouch for picking up
the cook three times in one half hour as she made three
unsuccessful attempts to get up into the second floor after
dark.</p>
<p>It was in vain that I laughed at their fears or removed the
cause. If I showed the white woman in the parlor to be a streak
of moonlight once, I did so fifty times, and each time the cook
only looked incredulous and said: "Yes, I see," and the
'Stiffner' glared at me more fiercely than ever. But when I
suggested buying a few rat traps to settle the noises, the two
arose at once and declared that it was flying in the face of
Providence to suggest such a thing and that they would not stand
it.</p>
<p>At last our little company became so completely demoralized
that one morning after breakfast, at which the steak had come up
burnt black and the coffee bitter and cold, I turned to my aunt
and said:</p>
<p>"Aunt Chris, I begin to fear we will have to give it up." But
my aunt, who is a woman of spirit, replied:</p>
<p>"No, James, we will not give it up. Turn off the women and we
will run the house ourselves; or, rather, send them away, and we
will have only ourselves to wait on."</p>
<p>Like many another innocent male victim, I had never thought of
getting along without these faithful incumbrances. But, as I
always do, I assented to my aunt's plan, and the servants
departed.</p>
<p>It was now getting along toward the holidays. In the early
autumn, when we first thought of this winter residence, we had
rashly invited a company of friends to spend some time with us.
They, not being aware of the supernatural visitants of our home,
and the present defenseless condition of its inmates, we passed a
day in writing to them and explaining the situation. Being of
sound minds, they all came.</p>
<p>We drew lots for rooms, and each bound himself or herself to
wage unceasing warfare upon all spiritual visitants, and in the
last night of the holidays to gather in the great dining room,
heap up the table with nuts and apples, build a roaring fire in
the old-fashioned fireplace (which was one of the additions to
the home, and entirely outside of the dining room), and there,
under the mellowing influence of a jug of good cider, confess
what we had seen. Until then, silence. Of course, as holding the
white lady's chief camping ground, I stood the best chance of
lifting the company's hair when 'twelfth night' came. And so the
days passed on.</p>
<hr>
<p>But the house was really haunted. I was soon as thoroughly
convinced of the fact as I was skeptical of it at first.</p>
<p>The first change that I noticed in my room was on the 19th of
December. I was standing before the mirror on my dressing table,
brushing my hair before going down to breakfast. As I looked in
the mirror, I was astonished to see that I was smoothing the
hair, not of a staid gentleman of thirty-seven years, but the
obstinate capillary adornment of a boy. I shut my eyes for a
moment, and when I opened them found the boy gone and a young man
looking straight into my face. His eyes had a faraway, familiar
look about them, as the eyes of an old friend just called up from
the past, half recognized, half strange. The apparition remained
until I turned away and went down to the breakfast room.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of it. And after a beginning was once
made I had not a night's peace. From that time I was led about
into the wildest and most fantastic escapades imaginable. I
remember that very same night I had blown out my lamp, gone to
bed, and was lying, looking out at the hill, white with moonlight
as if covered with snow. I had lain there but a few minutes when
a lady in white came in and seated herself by the window.</p>
<p>With a motion hardly perceptible she indicated that she wished
me to follow her, and no power on earth could have held me back.
Out upon the old roof, down to the white hill, and through the
ravine, we went at a rate defying competition. In an incredibly
short time we were miles away and in a little white
school-house.</p>
<p>When we left the school-house we were tramping through the
woods, which were no longer bare and brown from autumn days, but
green with spring, and our feet trod among violets and
bluebells.</p>
<p>There was a large city which I traversed till I knew every
street. There was a house and an office and a desk, and in and at
these I was compelled to sit and add long columns of figures and
post imaginary books.</p>
<p>So the week went by. One night, I remember, was passed in
wandering over the fields and through the woods, which under this
ghostly chaperonage was bright with flowers and green with leaves
and grass. And I spoke in terms of love to the little lady in
white who accompanied me.</p>
<p>The nights of the 22d and 23d were passed in the same manner,
and we planned a life together as full of idyllic days as were
these evenings. But the night of the 24th, Christmas eve, as the
little princess came into my room and I was preparing to start
upon another trip, I found other influences were at work. The
more she entreated me to come, the less able was I to obey, until
at length I saw reflected in the shaky looking glass at the foot
of my bed, a strange shape that had not intruded upon us
before.</p>
<p>I do not remember distinctly what happened then. But this I do
know, that the second shape drew me away from her serene highness
and out into the night. The next I knew I was crossing the
ocean.</p>
<p>Then I found myself in a quaint old town, with queer houses,
and still queerer people. In an hour more I was among the ruins
of Rome, and then I scaled the Pyramids of Egypt; I talked tea to
a Chinaman and coffee to a Java Islander. I was imprisoned in
Siberia and ran a race with a Hottentot. It was wonderful what
flights I took in an hour's time.</p>
<p>When I got back to my room the little princess was gone.</p>
<p>During the whole of the Christmas day I went around in a dazed
manner&mdash;drawn into myself, as my friends said. That was
another Christmas day which I did not enjoy. I looked forward to
the night, although I knew the little woman would not appear to
me again. She never did appear to any one in that room but
myself, and she never came to me after that Christmas eve.</p>
<p>Ah! that haunted room! No phantom ever trod upon that floor or
floated in the air but the fleeting phantom of my own early
dreams. No ghost ever haunted that room overlooking the kitchen
roof other than the ghost of my own childhood, the ghost of my
early manhood, the ghost of my own airy dreams. Many a time have
I pursued the phantom, always following, never reaching, never
holding, never with these man's steps to overtake it, never with
these man's hands to grasp it, never with this man's heart to
inclose it. And for the ten nights I followed it, followed with
more earnest desire, and with stronger outstretched hands than
when a boy, yet only for a second time to find it as before in
boyhood&mdash;only a shadow never to be realized.</p>
<p>Ah, well! How much is left after five years of love and ten of
wandering&mdash;coming back to find love gone&mdash;for the man
of forty to follow but phantoms.</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;THE QUESTION.</h3>
<p>My life has been somewhat of a bohemian one, I must confess,
and consequently I have met a great many different classes of
people. Just why it is that I never could remain long in a place
has always been a mystery to me never fathomed. In the few years
of my life (I do not want to make myself out an old man) the
press from Maine to California has become familiar to me, and
many are the offices which have known me for a day and forgotten
me the next. But that has nothing to do with my story.</p>
<p>In all my wanderings I never met with but one woman who
embodied all the graces which I had in my mind ascribed to the
fictitious person who should at some time be my wife. But while
in St. Louis on the <i>Globe-Democrat</i> I met a lady who
interested me strangely. She was married, and that, of course,
placed her beyond my reach, although she was such a one as I
would have desired as a wife.</p>
<p>I was introduced to her three years before I went to Kansas
City, and in these three years was so far favored as to become an
adopted son in the family and to be allowed to call this woman
mother. Yet she was scarce ten years older than myself.</p>
<p>I wish I could describe her better, for, as I have said, she
was to me the embodiment of all that was womanly. Cold and
reserved, she allowed no one to be familiar and she had no
intimate friends, though many adored her. She was cold and
reserved, and yet I have known her to be very tender to a poor
sick person or one in distress. Then she was small, and had a
face which once seen would be remembered by its proud,
aristocratic look. She was a little autocrat. Perhaps that is why
I, bohemian that I am, loved her.</p>
<p>One evening after my reports had been sent to Topeka, and I
was busily engaged upon a news letter which was to be sent by the
ten o'clock mail, a man nearly forty years of age entered my
office and inquired if I was the <i>Capital</i> reporter. I
replied in the affirmative, with my usual agreeable advertising
smile, and asked what I could do for him. In reply he drew a
chair up to my desk and asked:</p>
<p>"Are not you the gentleman who recently sent a paper headed
'The Haunted House' to the <i>Capital?"</i></p>
<p>I answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p>"I am the writer of it, and for a year have been anxious to
have it published in a Missouri paper. Six months ago I left it
with the editor of the <i>Kansas City Times,</i> but by some
strange fate it has fallen into your hands and you have done me
the favor of publishing it. I now wish to ask an additional
favor. If you ever hear any inquiries for the author will you
please notify me." And he laid a card on the desk before me, and
then after a few remarks and adieus departed. I looked at the
card. It bore the commonplace name of John Warrington, with the
address, Palmer House, Chicago.</p>
<p>A few weeks after John Warrington's visit I took a trip to St.
Louis, and, of course, stopped with my little mother. She, too,
had read the story of 'The Haunted House,' for I sent her the
<i>Capital</i> daily, as became an affectionate son. To my
surprise she was very curious about it and asked me innumerable
questions, among them the author's name. And then she took me
into her confidence and told me.</p>
<p>"Paul, did it ever occur to you that I did not love my
husband?"</p>
<p>I confessed that, viewing her well ordered house, it never
had.</p>
<p>"And yet it is true," she went on. "You think me cold, and I
am, but you have never thought that it was studied coldness, a
coldness which was not natural to me. And you think I am happy!
Well, so I have been, in a measure. But what will it be now? You
are my boy, and I can tell you what I am thinking to-night. I
would give all my life for one day of fifteen years ago. When I
was a girl I loved a young man, but he was wealthy and I poor,
and his parents managed to separate us. We were engaged at the
time. No harsh means were used&mdash;we were simply parted.</p>
<p>"I lived in the neighborhood for several years and then came
West and married. Why did I marry? When you are older you will
understand better, perhaps. It is woman's nature, her fate to
marry. Some do not? Yes, I know it, but that very fact sets them
up as guide boards pointing young girls to matrimony.</p>
<p>"When John did not return and I heard nothing from him, I at
last began to think that he had forgotten me. That was a hard
time, Paul. Life seemed worth very little. Then I met my husband,
and he was kind and good, and I thought at last that I might grow
to love him. At least there would be a deep respect which would
make life bearable, and I wanted some one for my own. So we were
married, and our life has been happy, or rather peaceful. But I
have never loved him and he knows it. I am sorry, oh! so sorry
for him. We have often talked it over, and, Paul, he is very good
to me. I do love him in a manner.</p>
<p>"Now comes that story in the <i>Capital.</i> I knew it at
once. The picture of the old house is perfect, and the story is
quite like John. He never could be solemn for any length of time,
but was always running off into some extravagance. But under all
the lightness there is a sad strain, the sketch of his life and
mine before we were separated. And do you know, Paul, I believe
that he wrote that story for me, so that if I should read it, I
should at least know that he loved me all these years. I wonder
what he looks like now?"</p>
<p>And then I told her all about John Warrington's visit and his
appearance.</p>
<p>And so the fantastic tale I had resurrected from my old desk
in the branch office was the story of my little mother's love.
And she was not happy! These two thoughts clung to me with
persistence as I went my daily rounds. That there was a pain in
them for me I cannot deny, but perhaps my story has been so
poorly told already that there is no need of the confession.</p>
<p>What was best for me to do? The question bothered me for days,
and then I wrote to John Warrington. It was not a week until he
called upon me&mdash;at evening, when I always had the office to
myself, and that night he, as had my little mother, told me the
story of his life and hers.</p>
<p>Years before, when he was young, he had loved her, but they
had separated. He was given an appointment the other side of the
world, and although he wrote frequently he never heard again from
his lady love. Years passed, and he had concluded that she had
forgotten. Then he came back and visited the old home to find it
gone to decay and rendered uncanny by the story that it was
haunted. He fitted up the little back room that had once been his
when a boy and there passed the winter holidays. During those
weeks he was haunted, haunted by sad memories which clung to this
room of his happy boyhood.</p>
<p>There he had lived and grown to manhood, and there, after the
house was wrapped in slumber, he had tossed upon his bed, as most
of us have done some time or other, and run over in his mind the
day's work, how he had passed a sweet afternoon with his love,
his visit to the little school-house, their rambles through the
woods, and afterward of his days in the city counting room. Now
that he had come back to the place after ten years exile, each
night brought to him a review of those days.</p>
<p>The story of the house being haunted gave the idea for his
story. Yet even here, where he should have been pathetic, he must
needs be ridiculous. He himself told me that he knew that if
'Nellie' should see it she would understand, as for anyone else
he did not care. There are such persons&mdash;I have often met
them&mdash;who cannot speak of their private feelings in any
other than a light manner for fear of ridicule, and can we blame
an old bachelor for his little crochets? So he tried to make the
story comic. Ah! well, old man, you may sneer, but I knew from
the first that last paragraph came from the heart which treasured
the love of that country school ma'am as sacredly then as it did
ten years before.</p>
<p>And the little woman?</p>
<p>He returned, believing that she had forgotten and had learned
to love another. He heard that she had gone West and had married,
and he took this means of finding her, or at least letting her
hear from him. He confessed to me that night that he had secretly
hoped to find the report of her marriage untrue.</p>
<p>And now he had found her, and she loved him. But she was a
wife. The wife of a man she had never loved, and the old love was
tugging at her heart.</p>
<p>What were they to do?</p>
<p>That was the question he put to me that night. I went to a
Catholic priest and laid the story before him, omitting the later
developments since the lover's return. His answer came clear and
decidedly.</p>
<p>"Marriage is a sacrament, not a legal contract, and if she did
not love her husband the sacrament was void."</p>
<p>"What shall she do?"</p>
<p>"Renew her vows privately, or leave her husband."</p>
<p>"But she does not now love her husband! Shall she secure a
divorce and marry her lover?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Such was the decree of the church. I gave it to the lover.</p>
<p>To him and to you I leave it. "What shall she do?"</p>

<p>How Clarence Bradford ever came to win the wife he did had
always been a mystery to me. He was a country boy of fair ability
when he came to St. Louis to study medicine, but there was
nothing brilliant to distinguish him from a score of other
students. His wife, on the other hand, had been one of the
society buds of the city, the daughter of one of the wealthiest
and proudest men in St. Louis, and how Bradford ever had a chance
to win her I could not understand.</p>
<p>When I first met him, however, they had been married several
years, and he was on the road to a reputation as a physician. At
first I did not know of his early poverty, but one evening after
we had been acquainted for a year or more he told me something of
his struggles to secure an education, and that set me to
wondering about his wife.</p>
<p>But it was a long time before he spoke to me about her, and
when he did it was while driving home from the medical college in
which he had graduated and in which he was now delivering
lectures.</p>
<p>He did not look or act like himself that day, and as we drove
home he told me why. Strange as such a confession would seem,
coming from such an experienced physician, he had been unnerved
by the sight of the body of a young woman on the dissecting
table.</p>
<p>"Come in to dinner," he said, as the carriage drew up at his
home, "and afterward we will go into the office and I will tell
you why no amount of experience can accustom me to the dissecting
table when the subject is a young woman."</p>
<p>I accepted the invitation, and after a dinner served in
irreproachable style we shut ourselves in his office, or rather
his study, for he had a downtown office, and while smoking our
after-dinner cigars he told me the story of his life. I say of
his life because the winning of his wife was the turning point in
it.</p>
<p>"I have no doubt but that you have often wondered how I, a
poor medical student, came to marry the daughter of Henry
Arnold," he began.</p>
<p>I nodded assent, and he continued:</p>
<p>"The story is a queer one, and if I were not able to give
unimpeachable testimony to its truthfulness I would not dare tell
it, even to you, so certain am I that most people would set me
down as an Ananias.</p>
<p>"The first year that I was in the medical college I secured a
position as nurse in one of the hospitals, both for the training
it would give me and for the money it would bring in.</p>
<p>"It was there that I first saw Edith. She came regularly to
bring flowers to the patients, and we always exchanged a few
words. She was so kind, so sweet, so gentle with the sick, that
no one seeing her going from cot to cot could help admiring
her.</p>
<p>"I did more. I loved her.</p>
<p>"But, as you may imagine, any hope of making her my wife was
out of the question. It was condescension enough for the daughter
of the wealthy Arnold to visit the sick in a public hospital. It
would have been madness to have thought for a moment that she
would become the wife of a penniless medical student whom she
found there."</p>
<p>"I am surprised that she did even that much," I remarked as he
paused in his narrative, as if the recollection of those days was
too pleasant to be passed over hastily. "Wealthy girls are not in
the habit of carrying flowers to the hospitals."</p>
<p>"That is true," he replied, with a mingling of pride and love
in his voice, "but my wife is an exceptional woman.</p>
<p>"After several months," he continued, "she failed one week to
pay her customary visit, and I was wretched. The next week she
did not appear, and then I made inquiries concerning her.</p>
<p>"She was very ill, and ten days later I heard that she was
dead. The day after I attended her funeral, followed the body to
the cemetery and saw it interred in the family vault.</p>
<p>"I should have told you that for several years I had been
interested in telepathy and kindred subjects. You know I was
quite old when I entered the medical school&mdash;was twenty-five
during the first term. These studies had resulted in my becoming
a firm believer in the theory that one mind can influence
another, no matter how great the distance.</p>
<p>"The night after the funeral of Edith I went to my room and
sat down to make an experiment wilder and weirder than any I had
ever read.</p>
<p>"It was an attempt to bring to me, by the exercise of my will
power, the spirit of my loved one, if such a thing were possible.
In life we had been immeasurably divided, but in that new world
to which she had gone the conditions which had bound us would no
longer exist; she would know that I loved her, and, at least,
would not be angry, even if she cared nothing for me. So I
reasoned.</p>
<p>"Now you are thinking of me as a spiritualist, but I am not
and never was. I am simply a firm believer in the power of mind
over mind&mdash;and matter. And that night I merely desired to
bring into play the principles that would have been used in
working upon a living person. If I could influence one in the
flesh, why could I not influence one who would be more sensitive
because freed from the body?</p>
<p>"The first thing to be done in my experiment was to find my
loved one's soul. I leaned back in my chair and began a mental
search, but it seemed as if my mind was strangely refractory. I
could not keep it from the sad events of the day. Again I saw the
coffin in the church as the burial service was sung, and followed
it step by step to the cemetery and the vault. I believe now that
I must have been in some kind of a cataleptic state at the time,
but I did not realize it then.</p>
<p>"The whole funeral passed before me in as vivid a manner as if
I were witnessing it again.</p>
<p>"But I was not entirely discouraged with the experiment, for I
thought perhaps to find the spirit of Edith, it might not be
amiss to follow her dear body.</p>
<p>"For, who knows? It might be true, as ancient legends tell us,
that the soul lingers around its cast-off tenement for a time.
You know this belief was the origin of draping public buildings
for thirty days, the length of time the Jews used to believe the
spirit remained near its earthly home before taking its flight
into the great unknown world of space.</p>
<p>"There is also another Jewish legend to the effect that the
soul hovers near the grave in which its body is interred for a
space of three days.</p>
<p>"I was conversant with all these old legends, and as no effort
to turn my mind in another direction was effective, I let it
go.</p>
<p>"If Edith were out somewhere in the wide universe, away from
earth, but would in time prove susceptible to my call, it made no
difference how far or how near she might be. If I kept my mind
fixed on her I would find her. And if this should prove
impossible, what was better than remaining in thought close to
all that was left of her on the earth?</p>
<p>"I had been in this condition for several hours when suddenly
the vault and the coffin burst open, as if a brilliant gleam of
sunshine had broken the bars of death, and I saw her body as
plainly as I now see you. Walls of rock and doors of iron were no
barrier, and as I looked upon the form I loved, the realization
came that this vision of my lost love was not a waking dream.</p>
<p>"And then a great hope flashed up.</p>
<p>"What if I had found Edith's soul, and it was still lingering
around her body? Then I could draw her to me and tell her that I
loved her.</p>
<p>"But that very moment the vision faded, and, try as I might,
it was but groping in the dark to attempt to find her. I could
not recall the vision. Happy even in its sadness, nevertheless it
was gone! I confess that there was a loneliness about it that I
never want to experience again.</p>
<p>"Still I could not resist the belief that for a few minutes I
had established a communication with Edith. That seemed a fact
not to be disputed. But&mdash;I had lost her.</p>
<p>"As you may imagine, I did not give up my search. What lover
would?</p>
<p>"I continued to keep my mind fixed on her in the hope that she
might again appear and that I might draw her spirit into converse
with mine.</p>
<p>"And at last I succeeded. But where, and under what
circumstances, do you suppose?</p>
<p>"I saw her body in a light covered wagon driven rapidly along
the streets of the city. As I followed, the way became familiar
and I saw that she was being taken to the college I was
attending. And when the wagon stopped I saw her lifted from it
and borne up to the dissecting room.</p>
<p>"Then it seemed as if she called my name.</p>
<p>"You can guess what I did. Within half an hour I was climbing
the stairs to the dissecting room. A white-covered body was lying
upon a table in the centre of the room, and the professor and one
or two students were standing near.</p>
<p>"I hastened up to the silent figure and drew down the sheet
from the face. It was Edith.</p>
<p>"I called the professor to one side and informed him whose
body it was, and could see that he was not only surprised but
shocked, as he had no idea where the men engaged for the purpose
had secured his 'subject.'</p>
<p>"Very quickly I added that I had reason for believing that
life had not yet left the body, and while confessing to be unable
to give him any reason which might prove satisfactory, begged him
to send the other students away and make an experiment. I was so
much in earnest that he consented.</p>
<p>"When we were alone with 'my dead,' as I fondly thought of it
in that moment, he said:</p>
<p>"'We will try blood letting. If there is any life in the body,
as you think, she may regain consciousness&mdash;that is, if
there is any blood to let,' he added, the professional side of
his character coming uppermost.</p>
<p>"He took his dissecting knife and made an incision in the
arm.</p>
<p>"Blood did flow and Edith returned to life and we took her
home to her parents.</p>
<p>"But when she first regained consciousness she reached out her
arms to me and said:</p>
<p>"'I knew you would come, for I saw you and called to you. I
knew you were searching for me.'</p>
<p>"And after that there was no question but that she would be my
wife."</p>

WATER.</a></h2>
<p>Once upon a time, it may or may not have been a long time ago,
a fair young girl came to an old country house in which dwelt a
philosopher and author. Whether or no he could, as yet, lay just
claims to the latter name there might be a difference of opinion,
but he was most certainly the first, if conscientious study and a
well balanced mind make one a philosopher. But, although a
philosopher in the truest sense of the word, he was not an old
man.</p>
<p>Ten years at the university, three in Germany, two in travel
and then five in study in his old home were all that had passed
since Gerald Leslie first left that home, a bright, merry
school-boy.</p>
<p>He owned houses and lands and bonds, and so he could afford to
bury himself in the large old farm-house, there to pursue those
studies in which he took greatest delight and labor, upon the
great work that was to make his name famous through all time.
Whether he was an author or not an author was to rest upon this
work. For all these years he had thought of nothing else, written
nothing else, save now and then a stray article for some
review.</p>
<p>His life in the last five years had been a quiet one, for,
besides a young giant who served him, his household was
restricted to an elder sister and her little girl.</p>
<p>And now, this day of which I write, the quiet life was to be
interrupted by the advent of the fair young girl. A month before,
Gerald had received a letter from an elderly friend to whom he
was bound by many ties, and in it were these words: "I am dying,
Gerald, dying; but I know that you will give a home to my
motherless Gracie."</p>
<p>For Victor Shirlaw to make this request was the same to Leslie
as if he had promised to look after his friend's child, and he
accepted the trust with a purpose which was as solemn as a vow,
and would be as religiously fulfilled.</p>
<p>The day was wet and disagreeable, and as Leslie's servant
entered to announce that it was time to drive to the station for
Miss Shirlaw, the former shivered in the raw air that came in by
the open door and looked with but ill-concealed envy at the burly
form before him.</p>
<p>A man so strong and firm, so perfect in health, the embodiment
of good nature, a man able to stem the storms and make his way in
the world, while he, Gerald, shuddered at the faintest draught of
chill air! And yet this man was unlettered, could read neither
Greek nor Hebrew, knew nothing of philosophy, nay, even so little
of his own language that he could not have legibly copied a page
of the philosopher's researches. And yet Leslie looked upon him
with ill-concealed jealousy.</p>
<p>"You must not go, Mr. Leslie, indeed, you must not," said the
brawny man as Gerald made a feint of rising.</p>
<p>The latter again cast a jealous look at his servant. Was this
man, who knew nothing of science, art or literature, his
superior? A great soul had Gerald, but it was annoyed by having
been cast in such a puny body, while this great hulk held only a
common soul that knew nothing beyond the confines of the farm and
the road to the station.</p>
<p>Gerald sank back in his chair and allowed the man to go upon
his errand alone, and all during the time the latter was on his
way to and from the little station, two miles away, Leslie
remained where he had seated himself, indulging in a reverie.</p>
<p>"Is he greater than I?" he asked himself. "Pshaw! Why should I
think of it. Is not the brain the ruler of the body? And he has
no brain. Shall I, wealthy and educated, become jealous of a
common farmer who happens to have muscle and health?"</p>
<p>The reader must not infer from this that Gerald was of an
envious disposition. Among his equals he was ever genial and
ready to applaud or help, and with his inferiors he was the most
courteous of men. But of late he had become envious of this
faithful John Brent's superior health. It was not a little hate,
nor the jealousy of a small soul. It was rather the chafing of a
strong spirit in a frail body, because a less learned soul
possessed one capable of more endurance. He loved John.</p>
<p>"Good-evening, Mr. Leslie."</p>
<p>The voice startled him from his reverie. The early winter
evening was approaching and the library was lighted only by the
last rays of the autumn sun and by the fitful gleams of the fire
in the grate. Turning his head, he saw, standing in the bright
glow of the evening sun, the 'fair girl' who had come to
interrupt his quiet life. He arose and offered his hand to
Gracie, and after a few words of welcome seated her in an easy
chair opposite the other side of the chimney. While listening to
the story of her journey he watched her face closely.</p>
<p>"She is a fair girl," he said to himself. "A fair girl, and
that is all."</p>
<p>He was right. Gracie was neither beautiful nor
handsome&mdash;not even pretty. But she was fair to look upon,
and a certain grace made her fascinating. And there was in her
manner something that said in later years she would be very
dignified.</p>
<p>The days passed quickly. Leslie was engaged upon his great
work and Gracie was left much to herself. John Brent proved a
good source of amusement, and the two were often seen together,
now picking apples in the orchard, now hauling in great pumpkins
and squashes and storing them away in the cellar. Later in the
winter they sat before the great fireplace in the sitting-room,
cracking nuts, roasting apples and drinking cider. In these bouts
John told her many a queer story of country life she had been
unused to.</p>
<p>Still, never a day passed but that she was with Gerald for an
hour or so. She would have stayed longer had she not thought that
he did not care for her company. She was attracted to the man who
was so powerful in mind, and had he given her a little
encouragement, shown her somewhat of his great heart, she would
soon have loved him so passionately that she could have given up
her life for him or for his love.</p>
<p>Women love strength, whether it be of body or intellect,
passion or will. Gracie was attracted to Gerald on account of his
strength in intellect and will. Had he only showed her how strong
he could be in love, also, he might then have won the girl's
heart, and the ending of this story might have been different.
Poor man! that he did not know a woman's heart may be won in many
ways, and that she quickly learns to reverence strength of mind
as much as strength of body.</p>
<p>But he repulsed her.</p>
<p>Why, I cannot say. But my opinion is that he thought she could
not love such a physical wreck as he. If he had only known that
he might have won her, and that she would have followed him to
the ends of the world and have been happy only to be with him!
But he did not know it.</p>
<p>So, crossed and repelled by her guardian, she became the daily
companion of John Brent. Let me correct a mistake which my use of
the word servant has doubtless led the reader into. John Brent
was not a servant, as we use the term in America. He was a man
who belonged with the homestead. His father had been there before
him, and his grandfather before his father. He had lived there
all his life, and had known and expected to know no other home.
He served, but not as a servant, a hostler, a gardener, or a man
of all work. But during Leslie's absence he had managed the
affairs of the estate, and since the student's return had
scarcely given up the reins. He was Leslie's aide-de-camp and
took his master's orders. He was his private secretary and
assisted the philosopher in the library. He was such a man as
Bunner depicts in Zadoc Pine, only with more refinement.</p>
<p>And so the winter months grew on apace. Each day Gracie passed
a longer or shorter time with Gerald, and each day he repelled
her more and more. Each day he loved her more, but each day he
concealed his passion. And each day she left Gerald's coldness
for John Brent's hearty kindliness and found&mdash;not what she
sought&mdash;but warmth and home life.</p>
<p>And yet Gerald tried to win her, in his own way. But in this,
as in many a case, the man's way was not the woman's way. He
loved her. She wished to love him, but his own actions drove her
away from him.</p>
<p>But John's courtship, if, indeed, he meant it to be courtship,
was entirely different. He let the girl follow her own sweet
will. She might drive to the station with him or help him in
marking out the great snow paths from house to road; she might
come to him when she chose or leave him when she was weary. He
let her come and go, work or ride, as she pleased. Whatever she
wished was hers, and in him she always found welcome and
friendship.</p>
<p>At length, however, the passion in Gerald's heart became so
strong that it could not be repressed, and he decided to at least
try to win the girl for his wife. That was late in December.</p>
<p>On Christmas eve he looked out of his library window and saw
Gracie, his Gracie, coming up the snow-banked walk with John
Brent's arm around her.</p>
<p>I can conceive of but one worse agony to be felt, and that is
for a husband to see his wife in another man's arms. Monasteries
have been filled from these two causes.</p>
<p>What Leslie suffered that night no mortal ever knew. But the
struggle with his own passions and sense of honor left him so
haggard that faithful John Brent was moved to say when he saw him
the next morning:</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Leslie, you must stop this late night work. It will
kill you. Stop it. Go away for a rest, or stop work and let us
nurse you back to health."</p>
<p>The words were kindly spoken, kindly meant, and Leslie knew
it, but despite his night's struggle and his resolution to be
honorable he could not help feeling that beneath the kindness
there was a hidden comparison between the young giant's superior
strength and his own weakness. So he answered, stiffly:</p>
<p>"When I have need of your advice I will ask for it. Please ask
Mary to bring in my coffee."</p>
<p>The giant departed without a word.</p>
<p>Leslie had, in the lonely night watches, given up his love,
but he was not yet ready to yield up that which had of late
become his spectre, his mania. He saw, or believed, that the
strength of body which he had so envied had won the woman whom he
loved, and he did not like to acknowledge to the victor that he
was weak. Why, was he not the superior of all whom he had met in
the mental arena? Was not his intellect as keen as man's
intellect ever becomes? And had he not nearly completed the great
work which would move the whole thinking world? Was he to count
himself inferior to a man who knew only how to manage a farm?</p>
<p>Filled with these moody thoughts, after breakfast he essayed
to walk out into the cold but to a stronger man bracing air, and
went out upon the porch, which ran the full length of the front
of the mansion. From it he stepped cautiously to the walk which
led down, between ice and snow laden pine trees, to the road.
Faithful John followed, quietly and unseen, with Gracie by his
side. A rod from the house there stood a great native elm tree,
which had grown close to the walk and had never been removed,
although all the other trees stood in straight rows, several feet
farther back, on each side. It was the only obstruction in the
great avenue from road to house. When Gerald reached this he felt
his strength beginning to leave him and leaned against it to
rest. A moment later, and a small drop of purple fell from his
lips to his coat. He brushed it aside, but his limbs began to
tremble.</p>
<p>John's love could no longer be restrained. He ran forward and
placed his arm around his master. Gerald looked up and fiercely
exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Will you leave me alone. Cannot I have a moment's peace? Can
I not even take a walk without you dogging my steps? Stand back,
I say."</p>
<p>But John did not step back.</p>
<p>"Mr. Leslie," he said, "you are ill. Let me help you to the
house."</p>
<p>What reply might have been made cannot be known, for just
then, as Gerald attempted to push him back, a gush of blood
flowed from his lips, and together John and Gracie carried the
student and recluse to his room.</p>
<p>One night&mdash;it was Twelfth night, I believe&mdash;Gerald
was very ill and Gracie was attending him. He had been writing
during the day upon his 'great work,' and had added a chapter to
it. But toward night he had become restive, had walked to and fro
across his library floor, and at length sank back exhausted into
the depths of an easy chair beside his study table, upon which
were ranged sinister looking volumes, note books, blocks of paper
and the last pages of his manuscript.</p>
<p>As the early winter sunset sent its last tinted rays in at the
western window and upon his writing table he said to himself:</p>
<p>"'Written in water!' One once told me, when I talked of high
ambition, that men's names, who had such high desires, were often
written in water. We were at the seashore then and were tracing
our names in the sand. The tide washed them away half an hour
later. He said that was fame; to write one's name upon the earth
and have it erased before an hour had passed. 'But how many
others,' he added, 'write their names in water, this is me,' and
he went forward a rod and with his cane wrote his name in the
rolling wave. It made no mark even for the instant. 'This,' he
said, 'is what many of us will do.' But I replied:</p>
<p>"'A name may be writ in water, sand or granite, and I shall
choose the granite.'</p>
<p>"'Do not be too sure,' he said.</p>
<p>"How true he foretold the future. In water it has been
written, for I am the last of my family, and I, the last of the
Leslies, have lost the woman I love. No son will ever be born to
keep up the old name.</p>
<p>"And my book! Well, it is not finished, but my life nearly is.
I shall never live to write the last page. As far as fame is
concerned, my name has been written in water. It has left no mark
even for the short instant of my own life."</p>
<p>At six o'clock John Brent brought in his dinner, but he could
scarcely touch it. At seven, Gracie came to sit with him.</p>
<p>"Gracie," he said, "I do not wish to leave my workshop in
disorder if&mdash;if&mdash;anything should happen. There are some
papers upon that shelf&mdash;loose papers, you will see. Please
bring them to me."</p>
<p>Gracie brought them to him.</p>
<p>"Yes, these are the ones&mdash;useless&mdash;I want them
destroyed. Please put them in the grate."</p>
<p>Gracie did so.</p>
<p>"Now, these few I have been scribbling to-day. They are
foolish, and I do not wish to leave them behind me. I may die,
you know."</p>
<p>"Oh, Gerald, you must not, you shall not die. Send for a
physician, or go south or to California. You are ill, but do not
give up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>But he interrupted her.</p>
<p>"Put them in the grate."</p>
<p>And Gracie obeyed him.</p>
<p>They were no sooner cast into the flames than John Brent
entered. He glanced at the blazing fire and then the shelf where
he knew the manuscript upon which Gerald had labored so long
rested.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Leslie! Oh, Gracie! What have you done?" he
cried.</p>
<p>"We have burned some useless papers," Gerald answered.</p>
<p>"It was your great work&mdash;your book."</p>
<p>"My great work! It was never finished. But my life is. Both
have been 'written in water.'"</p>
<p>I do not think, after Leslie died, that any one, save John,
ever knew truly what he meant by those words.</p>
<p>At least, Gracie never did.</p>

<p>The Rev. Alfred Brown, rector of St. Mark's, Quincy, was a
most exemplary man and husband. He did his duties as a priest,
and loved his wife. This did not hinder Mrs. Brown from being
insanely jealous. She was one of those uncomfortable women who
are always trying to find trouble for themselves and others. As
an article of the Athanasian creed she added what was not
generally recited&mdash;a belief in the absolute depravity of
mankind in general and of husbands in particular. The fact that
Mrs. Brown never caught her husband sinning was only the more of
an incentive for watching him closely. Because he was always good
and open and loving, she put him down as artful, and, behind
that, she had a shrewd tricky man to deal with. And this, not so
much because she was spiteful or unhappy, but because she was
jealous of him and of his reputation.</p>
<p>One reason for this jealousy may have been that she was eleven
years older than her husband and of a plain complexion.</p>
<p>She would never allow any one else to doubt or speak ill of
him, and she herself would not do the latter to his face. But she
held it as her divine right to do the former and keep a watch
over him on the quiet.</p>
<p>Only once had she ever been able to secure even a suspicion of
her husband. He had once, several years before, shown great
interest in a girl of his parish who had gone to the bad. No one
else ever thought of the Rev. Alfred Brown in connection with her
disappearance, but his wife decided that he needed watching.</p>
<p>There were certain seasons of the year when Mrs. Brown's
jealousy became abnormally active. They were in the spring and
fall, when the Bishop of Chicago summoned his clergy to meet him
at St. Paul's Cathedral in solemn semi-annual conclave, and to
these convocations the Rev. Alfred Brown was wont to go,
although, not a member of the Chicago diocese. It was his one
recreation, and they always asked him to address the meeting.</p>
<p>As a general thing, Mr. Brown took his wife with him on these
occasions and the couple stopped with a friend on Cass street,
near St. James. But in the spring of 1888 this friend was obliged
to take a trip to California and Mr. Brown was obliged to seek
quarters elsewhere. A bachelor friend hearing of his difficulty
wrote asking him to put up at the North Side Clubhouse during his
sojourn in Chicago. Mrs. Brown did not like to trust her husband
among a lot of ungodly club men, but the spirit of economy was
almost as strong in her breast as was the spirit of jealousy, and
she at last allowed him to accept the invitation. Mr. Brown
accepted her decision with a species of chastened, holy joy,
which filled the good lady's soul with fears. He was up to
something, she knew. An incident which occurred only a few days
before he was to leave, heightened her suspicions. Her husband
came in one morning with a long face and a solemn tone of voice,
and said:</p>
<p>"My dear, I have just heard of a distressing affair. Mary
Candee has run away, and it is feared that she has gone to marry
that scapegrace John Smith, who is connected with a saloon in
Chicago. I feel very sorry for her, and I hope that I may run
across her while attending the spring convocation. If so, I may
be of assistance to her or her husband."</p>
<p>"Alfred," replied Mrs. Brown, with a most austere look, "if
you speak to the abandoned creature you will degrade yourself,
and I forbid it."</p>
<p>"Why, my dear," the good rector replied, "you must be beside
yourself. It is my duty as a priest of the church to help even
the lowest. Of course I shall do all that I can to find the poor
girl and help her in her trouble."</p>
<p>"Convocation, indeed," Mrs. Brown said to herself, when the
rector had departed to his study. "A pretty convocation it will
be. Why couldn't he take me with him instead of going to a
disreputable bachelor clubhouse? He meant to meet that girl all
the time, and I haven't a doubt but that he wrote to that old
curmudgeon and asked for a room with him so that I could not go
along."</p>
<p>On Monday of the next week the rector of St. Mark's departed
for Chicago, sent on his way with the kindly wishes of the whole
parish, and accompanied by his senior warden and a churchman of
wealth and piety, who also wished to attend the ecclesiastical
meeting.</p>
<p>No sooner was he gone than Mrs. Brown received the means of
verifying her suspicions. Monday afternoon the carrier brought
her a letter from an old school friend asking her to pass a week
or so at her home in Chicago. The invitation was for herself and
husband, but she knew she could give a good excuse for going
alone, and accepted the invitation as a godsend. Besides, her
friend was the wife of an old army officer, and would enjoy
hearing of the matrimonial troubles of a friend. So she sent a
friendly note Tuesday morning accepting the invitation. The
letter reached Chicago at 2.30 in the afternoon, and just as Mrs.
Brown was sitting down to tea a Western Union messenger brought
her the following dispatch:</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Charlie is away for months. Called suddenly. Come at once. Am
dull. CARRIE BROPHY.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Mrs. Brown's arrangements were soon made, as they had to be of
necessity, for the convocation was to last only from Wednesday
till Thursday of the next week. She packed a small valise and
took the night train for Chicago, arriving there Wednesday
morning. She found her old friend a woman who troubled her
husband with her sanctimonious airs. He was an easy-going
Episcopalian, who believed that all he had to do was to attend
church occasionally and talk back to the preacher according to
book, while she was a Simon-pure Baptist, who believed in
conversions, baptism, and a godly life.</p>
<p>Owing to the diversity in their ages, the wife had good reason
for being jealous of him. So the two ladies enjoyed themselves
all Wednesday afternoon and evening, the one telling of her
husband's derelictions, and the other telling of her
suspicions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all unconscious of his wife's close proximity, the
Rev. Alfred Brown was enjoying himself immensely. His bachelor
friend knew the north end, and was able to give him surprising
knowledge with regard to that part of the city. They drove in a
carriage to the principal points of interest, visited Lincoln
Park and saw the bears in the bear pit. Only two things marred
Mr. Brown's happiness. He thought of his wife, lonely in Quincy,
and of Mary Candee's sad future. Before a day had passed he had
another trouble. His former parishioner, the girl who had gone
wrong, followed him. She had seen him in a cab, had followed and
dogged him on every trip, begging for half-dollars. He wished to
help her, but her persecutions almost made him decide to take his
friend's advice and hand her over to the police. But Mr. Brown
was soft-hearted.</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown inherited from her Puritan ancestors a horror of
the theatre, but her old school friend overcame her scruples
enough to induce her to go and see Irving in 'Faust.'</p>
<p>"It is improper," the rector's wife said.</p>
<p>"But the moral is good," her friend replied.</p>
<p>So she went, and saw her husband in a box on the opposite side
of the theatre.</p>
<p>"Look at him!" she said.</p>
<p>"Look at who?" her friend said.</p>
<p>"At my husband! See him&mdash;the priest, the rector, who came
up to attend a convocation of clergymen."</p>
<p>"My!" said her friend; "I did not know your husband was in the
city."</p>
<p>"You didn't? Where did you suppose he would be when there was
a church convocation in Chicago. You must know, Mrs. Brophy, that
my husband has official duties which call him to church councils
continually. Still, I will say to you that I don't quite like
seeing him with a couple of ladies in a theatre box."</p>
<p>And she nursed her wrath in silence till the curtain fell.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" her friend cried. "Where are you
going?"</p>
<p>"I am going to follow my husband."</p>
<p>"But you can't."</p>
<p>"I can," replied Mrs. Brown, firmly. And she did.</p>
<p>She followed her reverend husband out of the theatre and saw
him assisting two young ladies into a carriage. They were nieces
of the Bishop, but of course she did not know it.</p>
<p>Just as he was turning away a young woman came up and
evidently asked him for money. He gave her half a dollar and was
turning away, but she clung to him with a persistency which was
annoying, if not compromising.</p>
<p>"You ought to hand her over to the police," said the rector's
bachelor friend. "The girl went to the bad long ago. I have seen
her here, and know what she is. If she troubles you again forget
that you are a clergyman and hand her over to an officer."</p>
<p>The Rev. Alfred agreed, and his friend engaged a Pinkerton
detective to follow and protect him.</p>
<p>The next day the Bishop had decided that the afternoon should
be passed in the different parks, and that at six o'clock the
clergy should assemble at his home on Ontario street for
dinner.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown's bachelor friend accompanied him, and, together
with the Bishop's nieces, they went to Lincoln Park, visited the
hothouses, viewed the gardens, rowed on the lake, and looked at
the bears.</p>
<p>Expecting some disturbance, Mr. Brown had told his fair
friends about his trouble and what might be expected.</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown was on his track.</p>
<p>For a few moments he left his company to look at the deer in a
separate pen nearer the lake, and when he returned found the
Bishop's nieces in a peculiar frame of mind.</p>
<p>"You may take us both to the Bishop," they said.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" the clergyman asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing," one of them replied, "only the girl you told us
about came up and denounced you as her husband."</p>
<p>"This is really too much to bear," Mr. Brown replied. "I
wanted to help the poor girl, but if she cannot respect her
friends I must give her over to the police."</p>
<p>Accordingly, after taking the young ladies to their uncle, the
Bishop, he called the detective and gave him instructions to
watch closely and arrest any woman who followed or annoyed him or
his companions.</p>
<p>Soon after the detective whispered in one of the nieces'
ears.</p>
<p>"Beg pardon, miss, but I am a detective. Is that woman yonder
the one who annoyed you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is."</p>
<p>"All right. Hope you'll excuse me," and the detective went
over and led the woman to the police station.</p>
<p>The Rev. Alfred Brown passed a pleasant afternoon after that
and enjoyed himself at the Bishop's dinner, which was good and
served in true Episcopal manner. After dinner there were speeches
and a social, and it was not until nearly midnight that the
convocation adjourned.</p>
<p>When the Rev. Alfred Brown reached the club-room he found a
telegraphic message:</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>"Come at once. Am in trouble.</p>
<p>"Theresa Brown."</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>"Holy Chasuble! Something awful must have happened! I wonder
if thieves have broken in."</p>
<p>The good father never stopped to look at the date, which was
at the North Side police station, but prepared to go down to
Quincy.</p>
<p>While he was eating salmon and enjoying ice cream at the
Bishop's palace his wife had been enjoying the hospitalities of
the police court. When the police magistrate loomed up before her
on the morning after her brilliant debut in Lincoln Park, he
said:</p>
<p>"What's she up for?"</p>
<p>"Trying to extort money from the Rev. Alfred Brown, of Quincy,
Ill."</p>
<p>"You lie!" the reverend gentleman's wife forgot herself so
much as to cry. "He is my husband."</p>
<p>"What, this detective?"</p>
<p>"No; the Rev. Alfred Brown."</p>
<p>How she managed to work her way out of it we need not inquire,
as it is a delicate subject. But work out of it she did, and the
next evening, while her husband was supping on a cold meal and
wondering why none of the twenty telegrams he had sent that day
had brought an answer from his wife, she walked in on him.</p>
<p>"Good heavens, Alfy! what are you doing here? I thought you
were in Chicago!"</p>
<p>"I was, as you know, Theresa, but this dispatch called me
back."</p>
<p>"This dispatch; why," and she read it over. "What could have
been the matter with you? Couldn't you read? This is dated at the
North Side police station in Chicago. Ah! I see, my dear, beloved
husband; you got this the night of the banquet and you had taken
a cup of wine too much to be able to read straight. Take my
advice and don't go to any more of them."</p>
<p>Mr. Brown was mystified, and Mrs. Brown never troubles him
with jealousy since. She does not care to watch him any more, and
he has never learned who sent him that deceptive telegram.</p>

<h2>I.</h2>
<p>I have been thinking for several years that some time I will
get on the cars, and, after a ride across half a dozen States,
stop at a large city on the borders of our great Western
prairies; that there I will take the one daily train, which goes
down a hundred miles across the prairies, until I come to a
little Western town that I have not visited for years. There is
nothing to draw me on such a long journey, except some sad
recollections; but I feel that if I should walk along the banks
of a little stream which flows south of the town, climb among the
rocks and visit again a low-roofed farm-house just beyond, I
would feel as if I were reading over again a sweet, sad poem
which I had once read, long ago, and laid aside.</p>
<p>It is a busy little Western town. To the north the open
prairie, but the other three sides are shut in by small streams,
and a broad, smoothly flowing river. Across the little stream
stood a low farm-house, with a long porch in front and tall shade
trees around it. It was picturesque and gave a very comfortable
feeling of relief after all the new, unpainted pine houses on the
other side. It marked an old settler also, for on the frontier
one desires first only to live; after a living is secured, and
not till then, does the go-ahead Western man attempt to make his
house homelike.</p>
<p>I liked this place from the first. Afterward I loved it for
the sake of 'the little girl, now a woman,' who lived there.</p>
<p>Soon after moving to Winfield, father was taken ill, and for a
week I watched by his bedside every night. Then one evening, in
order to get some much needed rest, I laid down for a couple of
hours, and had just dropped into a light sleep when mother came
and asked me to get up again and give directions to a man who had
come to nurse father.</p>
<p>"He is so deaf that I cannot make him hear, and so
near-sighted that he cannot see anything. See if you can make him
understand what is needed," she said.</p>
<p>So I got up and went into father's room, and there, for the
first time, saw Tom Mell, about as queer a specimen of humanity
as I ever met.</p>
<p>He was sitting in a low chair, rocking to and fro in an
absent-minded sort of way, like one entirely cut off from the
world. His forehead was flat and low, and his eyes had the
peculiar squint common to near-sighted people. His nose looked as
if it had a small bone in the end, and that the skin was drawn
from it to the forehead, with a slight depression in the middle.
I afterward learned that it was solid, but the thin, almost
transparent cuticle never let me fully realize the fact. His hair
was neatly oiled and polished, but it had a queer way of slanting
backward on one side and forward on the other that no amount of
oil or polishing could rectify. His whiskers consisted of a thin,
wiry mustache and a moderately heavy crop under his chin, of
which Tom was very proud.</p>
<p>Just awakened from sleep, I could not help smiling as I
shouted the directions in his ear and in return received a low,
thin answer that would have done credit to one in the last stages
of consumption. He smiled, and seemed so completely taken with
the idea that he smiled on all through the interview. And when he
bent over me at three o'clock in the morning to wake me, he was
smiling still.</p>
<p>This was our first meeting, and after the kindness shown us, I
took pains to cultivate his acquaintance. At first he always
touched his old straw hat when we met, and smiled that peculiar
smile of his, but as we grew more intimate, he ceased the former
and I forgot to notice the latter.</p>
<p>One evening I visited him in his room, which was up over a
hardware store on Main street, and was approached by a dark entry
with irregular steps, and boxes and boards in the passage, which
rendered it a dangerous route for inexperienced travelers, even
at midday. It was a regular bachelor's den, with a bed and
cooking-stove and other necessary furniture for keeping
house.</p>
<p>Tom was at supper when I entered, and after he had finished
his solitary meal we drew our chairs close together and he told
me the story of his life. It was sad, and yet it was lonelier
than sad. At an early age he had been taken with a disease which
had left him nearly deaf. No sooner had he recovered from his
sickness than he began another fight with
disease&mdash;consumption. In a comic manner that was pathetic,
he told me that night of his illness and of the 'cheerful words'
his friends gave him. His uncle especially amused him with the
doleful remark:</p>
<p>"You may get well&mdash;in fact, I think you will; but you had
better be a very good boy!" which he repeated at the close of
every visit. And when he went on to relate how he left home,
determined to support himself, how he lived his solitary life,
although in the same village with his father and step-mother, of
his struggles and failures, I felt something tugging in my
breast, and grew ashamed of what I had considered trouble.</p>
<p>It is always so. There are in every village, no matter how
small, characters whom God has made for daily lessons to the
unsatisfied ones&mdash;persons bearing such heavy burdens so
manfully that we grow ashamed of our own complaining and dare not
speak of our own little crosses to them.</p>
<p>"I have always tried to get a little ahead," he said in his
low, thin voice; "but it seems as though I cannot. I used to
think I would some time go to college, and I worked hard to do
so&mdash;but&mdash;I had to give it up."</p>
<p>I knew Tom was considered quite a genius in his own way, but I
had not expected to hear this from him.</p>
<p>"That was the hardest cross of my life," he continued after a
little pause. "No one, unless he has gone through it, knows how
blank it leaves a life to strive for years after something that
will elevate his condition, and then have his plans fail and know
that his whole life must be passed in the same low position."</p>
<h2>II.</h2>
<p>Coming home one stormy evening about a month after this, I
passed the village church. The outer door was open a little way,
and, hearing the organ, I went in; for I knew Tom's habit of
passing his evenings alone in the church, sending out into the
darkness as true hymns of praise as ever were heard.</p>
<p>I opened the inner door quietly and walked up the aisle
unseen. I had often heard Tom play, but never as now when he
thought himself alone&mdash;alone with God. The storm gathered
and broke, and the thunder shook the windows of the church, but
Tom was all unconscious. His heart was going out on the strains
of a joyful Te Deum; as for the noise, I doubt if he even heard
it, and as for the darkness, blind people do not mind that. Once
a streak of lightning lighted up the church for several seconds,
just as he came to the passage:</p>
<p>"Thou art the King of Glory, O Christ,<br>
Thou art the everlasting Son of the Father."</p>
<p>He was filling the whole church with the strain, and as the
lightning came I saw his face was turned toward the cross in the
chancel, and shone as if he was looking straight up into the eyes
of God.</p>
<p>I bowed my head reverently, for I could feel that his soul was
going out in every note, and that the truest of heart worship was
ascending to the Eternal and Invisible King. A tender feeling
stole over me, there in the darkness, listening to this one cut
off from society by his infirmities, solacing himself by this
communion with the Father. What heartaches, what burdens were
here soothed and lifted and borne away.</p>
<p>The Te Deum died away, and then, without a pause, he commenced
that grand evening hymn:</p>
<p>"Lead kindly light, amid the encircling gloom&mdash;<br>
Lead Thou me on.<br>
The night is dark and I am far from home&mdash;<br>
Lead Thou me on."</p>
<p>I would like to have remained concealed longer; but, at the
close of the hymn another bright flash of lightning illuminated
the church for an instant, and Tom, seeing me, called out in a
cheery voice:</p>
<p>"Why, hallo! You here? I didn't see you," and came down from
the organ loft.</p>
<p>He would not play any more, so we sat together in the pew and
talked until the storm was over. I had that day been across the
little stream south of the village and met the daughter of the
house. She had interested me greatly, and during one of the lulls
of the conversation I asked Tom about her. Much to my surprise,
for he was always courtly, he replied brusquely:</p>
<p>"I would rather not talk about her."</p>
<p>"That interests me, Tom. Go on."</p>
<p>"I might as well tell you, I suppose," he replied after
thinking for a moment, "but you must not mention it. She has had
a pretty hard time of it&mdash;was engaged, and the match broken
off. It isn't talked about now, but I tell you, only you must
keep it quiet. You see, there was something the matter&mdash;I
don't know what&mdash;but the two were together for several
years, and then her lover went away. All I know is that he loved
her, and she loved him&mdash;but she can never marry."</p>
<p>"How do you know?" I asked abruptly, for I never liked these
tragedies.</p>
<p>"The man was satisfied," Tom answered briefly.</p>
<p>"And she loves him?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Where is he now?"</p>
<p>"In Australia."</p>
<p>"Who was he?"</p>
<p>"My brother."</p>
<p>I kept silent. How rude of me to draw him out in this manner
when I had heard that his brother was now on the other side of
the world! So, mortified at my careless stupidity, I leaned back
in the pew and waited for Tom to break the silence.</p>
<p>But he did not say anything for some time, and when he did
speak It was more to himself than to me.</p>
<p>"She loved him," I heard him saying. "She will never marry.
... A woman loves but once; a second love with them isn't real
love . . . and Mamie is too much of a woman to give anything else
to a man. . . . Neither one was to blame. They had to part, and
so they did. ... She loved him!"</p>
<hr class="short">
<p>One night Tom was ill and I was by his bed. We had no light,
and the twilight made him confidential; or, perhaps, it was his
mind wandering.</p>
<p>"There was a little girl once, Paul," he said as he lay on his
rough bed in that rough little room. "We used to play together;
and one afternoon, I remember, we played keeping house, and I was
the man and she was my wife. I often think of that
afternoon&mdash;we talked then of living together when we got
big! I wonder if she has forgotten it. She never speaks of it.
But then, it never could be. This sickness came, and now I am
nearly deaf and blind. No one wants to be with me. It's a lonely
life, Paul! No one feels the want of a home more than I do. And I
am entirely cut off from one. Sometimes I feel that if that
little girl, now a woman, would only come into my room
once&mdash;if she would sit down by my bed only once, as you are
sitting&mdash;I would be more satisfied; my life would be
happier. The old room wouldn't look so lonesome if she had been
in it once. I have given her up, but&mdash;I love her still. It
seems the wider apart we drift, the more my thoughts turn to her
and that one summer afternoon."</p>
<p>I had never thought of Tom having any such sad memories in his
breast. It was hard enough, God knows, to live his lonely life
without any broken dreams to look back to. He did not tell me the
name of the 'little girl, now a woman,' and I did not ask him.
But I sat in the darkness and thought of poor Tom meeting her,
perhaps, daily upon the streets of the little village; of his
thoughts and repressed longings, as he did so; of the two now
separated, going their own different ways, the one, perhaps, not
dreaming of the care the other had for her&mdash;maybe courted
now by another&mdash;at least, enjoying all the pleasures of
society; all of which poor Tom must see and be pained by, having
for himself only the bittersweet memory of a long faded
dream.</p>
<p>I sat and watched by him in silence, and I knew that in my
place by his side he was dreaming another one sat, who, if she
only would come, but for a moment, would do more for him than all
else in the world.</p>
<p>After a while he dropped asleep.</p>
<h2>III.</h2>
<p>Poor Tom was dying. I had been with him for a week, doing what
I could to make him comfortable. We were alone the most of the
time, for he wished it.</p>
<p>One Sunday evening he was more restless than usual.</p>
<p>"Paul, I want to see her before I die. Can't you bring her to
me?"</p>
<p>"Who is it, Tom?" I asked, thinking his mind was
wandering.</p>
<p>"I've never told you. I didn't want to. But now I must see
her. I haven't talked to her for eight years. It will do no
good&mdash;we never could be more to one another, but I want that
little hand in mine once again before I die. We have been apart
so long&mdash;so long, Paul!"</p>
<p>"Is she good and kind? Will she come? You know this is hardly
the place for a young lady."</p>
<p>"Yes, she will come if you ask her. She is good and true, or I
would have forgotten her. But even if she were not, I should like
to see the little girl&mdash;Mamie."</p>
<p>I put on my hat and prepared to go upon the errand.</p>
<p>"Who did you say it was, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Mamie Crowell. You know it all now. She loved my brother, but
they were separated. I couldn't help loving her still, but I kept
it a secret. Oh, Paul! you understand all of the loneliness of my
life now!"</p>
<p>I went out and left him alone. I met Miss Crowell on her way
to church and she came back with me. I opened the door of Tom's
room and let her pass in; and then turned away.</p>
<p>At last, Tom's dream of happiness was realized. His loneliness
was over. For a short time, as he had so often wished, his
boyhood's love was with him. I knew she would sit down and lay
her hand in his, although she might only dimly guess the truth.
She did not love him as he wished, yet hers was also so sad a
life that she could sympathize with him. And perhaps her woman's
heart would fathom the truth&mdash;that, to him, this twilight
hour was a repetition of that summer afternoon so long ago. And
for him&mdash;to have her with him once again was enough.</p>
<p>I walked along the streets for half an hour, and then went
back. Tom was lying on the bed with her hand in his. There was a
sad look on Mamie's face, but Tom was smiling. He was dead.
Another life had gone to God&mdash;a life dreary and sad and
lonely. But the passing had been made happy by 'the little girl,
now a woman,' and by the old dream lived over again for a brief
half-hour.</p>

<h1>A Chicago Romance.</h1>
<h3>By</h3>
<h2>CHARLES CURTZ HAHN.</h2>
<hr>
<h2><a name="A_CHICAGO_ROMANCE" id="A_CHICAGO_ROMANCE">A CHICAGO
ROMANCE.</a></h2>
<p>The last man I expected to meet as I was going down State
street was George Danvers, for the last time I had seen him was
in Paris, and he had then informed me that he never expected to
return to America. Ten years before we had both been residents of
Chicago, and the greater part of these ten years had been passed
by him in the Old World. He had a comfortable fortune and could
indulge in whims. And one of his whims was travel, although I
never could understand just why he wished to exile himself so
much as he did.</p>
<p>There was a good deal of surprise in my greeting on State
street, and I did not know but I had reason to be offended, as
only a week before I had received a letter from him, in which he
had made no mention of revisiting Chicago. Whether he detected
this, he at once said:</p>
<p>"Well, old boy, you are surprised to see me, arn't you? I
haven't time now to tell you why I am here, but I want to repose
a bit of confidence in you. I never have had but one secret from
you in my life, and if you will dine with me at the Palmer House
to-night I would like to tell you that one."</p>
<p>His invitation was accepted, and at seven that evening we were
seated at a table in a private room. Soup went the way of all the
world, fish followed the soup, and a roast duck was on its way
after the soup and fish, but George said nothing of his secret.
Our talk was all commonplace, about men and women we had known,
and as the dessert was served he said:</p>
<p>"Do you ever hear anything of Mrs. Archer?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Archer! No, I do not remember her."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Fred Archer. Her maiden name was Lawson, Helen
Lawson."</p>
<p>"Oh! that flirt. Yes, I remember her now. She jilted a dozen
good men. She had no conscience, no principle, and I always
disliked her."</p>
<p>"There, my boy, don't get excited," George replied. "For my
secret is concerning her."</p>
<p>"Ah! then you were really smitten by the jade? I saw you were
quite attentive, but I never believed that she had added your
name to her list of victims. And is that the reason of your long
exile in foreign lands?"</p>
<p>"Partly so, yes. But not just as you imagine. I did not love
Helen Lawson, but I do love Mrs. Fred Archer."</p>
<p>"The&mdash;deuce! I did not know you had ever met the lady
since her marriage."</p>
<p>"Neither have I."</p>
<p>"And yet you say you love her!"</p>
<p>"Shall I relate the story of my passion to you now? Do you
think you are sufficiently cool to hear it? Shall I order a
seltzer for you first?"</p>
<p>"If you wish any fire over the dead embers of that flame, my
advice is to send for a bottle of cognac for both of us."</p>
<p>"I see you are cool enough and will proceed. You knew Tom
Jones?"</p>
<p>"Yes. He was the poor fellow she treated so badly. He blew out
his brains soon after she dismissed him. I never spoke to her
after it happened."</p>
<p>"Well! You know Tom was my chum at college."</p>
<p>"I believe I do remember something about it."</p>
<p>"When she treated him so badly my curiosity was excited. I
wished to see what power she had over men. Now that I am
confiding in you, I might as well confess the whole truth&mdash;I
thought I would test my flirting powers against hers!"</p>
<p>"You decided to make her love you, and ended in becoming an
exile from unrequited love. George, forgive me for speaking so
lightly. I am very sorry for you!"</p>
<p>"You forget," George interposed, "that I said I never loved
Helen Lawson."</p>
<p>"I don't understand you. Go on."</p>
<p>"After poor Tom's death, I placed myself in her way. Did not
seek her&mdash;paid her no attention. Only continued to meet her
as if by accident. And when we did meet, I treated her
coolly&mdash;as I would treat one in whom I could not possibly
have any interest. She heard of my expressed dislike for her, and
after a time began to draw me out. I would treat her courteously,
but never allowed myself to become her wooer. She was always left
to make the advances. I never acted as if I thought she was a
flirt. Never mentioned poor Tom's name. Of course that worried
her and one evening she lost her temper.</p>
<p>"'You are a heartless brute,' she said to me.</p>
<p>"I pleaded guilty to being an animal, insomuch as I was a man,
and she laughed and then cried.</p>
<p>"It isn't pleasant to see a woman in tears. And&mdash;it isn't
safe. You know what some old philosopher has said about a woman
always having her way with a man when she begins to weep! So I
thought I would better retire gracefully.</p>
<p>"I think I said a few farewell words courteously and was about
to withdraw. But before I reached the door she had flung herself
in front of me.</p>
<p>"'You shall not go,' she said. 'You are a brute.'</p>
<p>"'So you informed me before,' I replied, 'and I agreed with
you.'</p>
<p>"Well, whatever was the cause, I do not know, but the next
moment her arms were around my neck and her head on my bosom.</p>
<p>"'I love you,' she said. 'I cannot let you go. I know you
despise me. But I love you. My pride is all gone. You have
conquered me. I love you.'"</p>
<p>"Well?" I queried, as he stopped.</p>
<p>"Well? My curiosity and my desire for revenge were both
satisfied and I left for Europe on the next steamer. In three
months I heard of her marriage to Fred Archer. It seems that they
had been secretly engaged for several years and Chicago society
was very much astonished that she kept her word with him."</p>
<p>"Where were you?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Well, old boy," he replied. "As I am in the confessional box
I may as well acknowledge that I believe she married Fred out of
pique, in hopes of reinstating her pride and showing me she was
trying to deceive me also."</p>
<p>"Slightly egotistic," I said, "but I can understand your
feelings and pardon it."</p>
<p>"All right!" he answered. "For two years I thought of Helen
Lawson in that way. The third I began to imagine her as really
loving me&mdash;of the glorious possibilities in her&mdash;of
what she might have developed into had she married the man she
loved. Then I censured myself for my heartlessness (I was in
India then), and during the seven years which have followed I
have loved her."</p>
<p>"And you have never seen her?"</p>
<p>"No. A month ago I heard that Fred was dead, and I came back
at once. To-morrow I call upon her and will ask her to be my
wife. Dine with me here to-morrow night and we will drink to the
health of the future Mrs. Danvers."</p>
<hr class="short">
<p>The next evening I kept my appointment with George. The dinner
was more elaborate than the previous one, and I saw that my host
had a superb bottle of wine at his right hand.</p>
<p>"This is to pledge the future Mrs. Danvers in," he remarked as
we sat down.</p>
<p>The dinner passed and after dessert he poured a glass of
choice wine for each.</p>
<p>"Let us drink to the health of the future Mrs. Danvers," he
said. "And forgive me for keeping you so long in suspense. But
she has never been born."</p>
<p>"Never been born?" I cried. "Have you been playing me another
Marjorie Daw trick?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly. I called on Mrs. Archer this afternoon. She was
so much changed that I did not recognize her. But she knew me at
once, and assured me that she was Helen Lawson Archer.</p>
<p>"'It was very kind in you to make me this visit of
condolence,' she said. 'You were quite fond of me once, were you
not? But that was long ago, and early loves are not, as a usual
thing, very lasting. I never realized that I could have any
genuine affection until I married Fred.'"</p>
<p>"How does she look?"</p>
<p>"Matronly, and rather stout. She has five children."</p>
<p>"And you did not propose?"</p>
<p>"No. I had no chance."</p>

BAY.</a></h2>
<p>Three years ago I was detained for several months along the
Pacific coast near San Francisco. Business of the house I am
connected with in New York sent me across the continent, and
after visiting our correspondent in San Francisco I found that I
would be obliged to remain some time in the State. I took
advantage of this opportunity to make a run down the coast branch
of the Central Pacific to San Mateo and visit an old friend. Down
this road, between the bay and the sea, are a number of stations
near which the millionaires of San Francisco reside. San Mateo is
the first town of any importance, and it is made so only by the
location there of a semi-military, semi-church school, St.
Matthew's Hall.</p>
<p>But before going farther with my story I ought to go back and
give a paragraph to my journey across the Rockies.</p>
<p>After leaving Omaha, in spite of Pullman palace cars and
attentive porters, our journey was a dreary one. A party across
the aisle engaged in daily games of euchre; the party in front of
me struck up a flirtation with the young man opposite. In like
manner all seemed to find companions in misery except myself and
a boy who occupied a berth over the rear bumpers. My stock of
books and magazines lasted me until we were approaching Ogden. On
the last afternoon before we reached that city, at which we
changed from the Union to the Central Pacific, they failed, and
by a fortunate occurrence I fell in with my bumper companion. We
were both braving one of the mountain outlaws, yclept innkeepers,
and I was out of change. My traveling companion offered to make
it and trust me to Ogden. So we became acquainted, and while
waiting at Ogden took a stroll together through the town. On
returning to the station we secured berths near each other and
together sat upon the rear platform and watched the sunset on the
salty sea. By the time we were ready to be ferried across the bay
to San Francisco we had become good friends and had agreed to put
up at the same hotel. He had also communicated to me the fact
that he was the son of a professor in Cornell University, and was
out hunting specimens for his father's museum.</p>
<p>A month afterward I returned from a short trip south, met him
at the Brooklyn House, and together we went to see Barrett, in
his alleged talented representation of Richelieu&mdash;a
character which, in my opinion, he never could correctly
impersonate should he study it until the craque o' doom. At
midnight my friend's vessel was to sail northward with the tide,
in search of sea lions, and we parted in the midst of the second
act. So much for introduction.</p>
<p>One day my San Mateo friend informed me that a society of
which he was a member had arranged for a day on the seashore, and
invited me to go along, provided I would furnish a conveyance for
myself. I accepted, and one cool June morning we started across
the foothills to Spanishtown. Five miles from the shore we were
three hundred feet above the level of the sea and saw below us a
narrow trail across the sand and the ocean beyond. Upon the shore
was a straggling village inhabited by 'greasers,' and, as we drew
nearer we could detect several small cabins near the sea. These,
we afterward found, were occupied by wreckers, who were then
engaged in raising a vessel which had sunk half a mile off
shore.</p>
<p>Spanishtown is situated at the southern extremity of Half Moon
Bay, a peaceful bit of sea in calm weather. When there was no
storm the waves rolled up with long graceful curves, but when
storms swept over the bay it was a dangerous place for vessels,
and the Government had stationed a light ship at the entrance to
warn sailors of the rocky coast.</p>
<p>As we strolled upon the sand, gathering seaweed and starfish,
the Pacific was very calm, indeed, but as the tide came in at
close of day the waves rolled up against the rocks we climbed
upon at midday in perfect security, we realized the terribleness
of a calm body once moved to anger.</p>
<p>Toward evening a black cloud arose from the western horizon.
The wind freshened and with it came tokens of a storm at sea.</p>
<p>Off a mile from the coast, where we could just see the top of
her masts, was anchored the beacon ship, a goodly sized schooner,
manned at that time by three persons, who nightly trimmed the
lamps which no doubt kept many sailors from going down to 'Davy
Jones' locker.' My San Mateo friend said that they had been there
for years and during that time had been the means of saving many
lives.</p>
<p>Before the tide turned four of our party had climbed to a
shelf of the cliff, some twenty feet above the beach, and so
occupied had we been in watching the waves lap up one after
another of the rocks we had a few hours before been walking upon,
that we did not notice that the tide had cut us off from our
friends. There we were, half way up the cliff, and a storm rising
in front of us. This bit of carelessness delayed our return home,
and afterward I was glad of it.</p>
<p>Gradually the storm increased. Instead of the long majestic
billows which characterize the Pacific, the waves, aided by the
tide, became terrible in their proportions. The sky grew dark
with dense clouds; the waves rolled in with what seemed an angry
dash; they lapped up the sand foot by foot; they reached the
rocks beyond, beat upon them, broke with fury against the barrier
and returned frothing to tell the others of their unfriendly
greeting.</p>
<p>In the midst of the storm a body was cast up by the waves and
fell at our feet. A rope had been fastened to a stake on the top
of the cliff and hung down to the ledge to assist adventurous
climbers, but so far we had not cared to make use of it, although
warned several times by the wreckers to do so.</p>
<p>We did an ungallant act. We sent a lady up the rope with
instructions to cut it when she reached the top. She did so, and
the rope fell at our feet. My friend seized it, tied one end
about my waist and lowered me to the sea. Half blinded by the
salt water, I managed to secure the body, tied it to my own by
means of a few feet of rope left free for that purpose, and by
the combined muscles of my friend and the lady with him we were
drawn up to a place of safety.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise on reaching the shelf to find the body we
had rescued was the body of my overland companion, the young
specimen hunter. By this time the lady who had ascended and cut
the rope had brought several wreckers to our assistance, and we
were, one by one, drawn up to the top of the cliff. There we
brought my friend back to life and, partly in the wreckers' cabin
and partly in a dingy little room in Spanishtown, that night he
told me the following story, which he amplified the next day when
he was stronger.</p>
<p>After leaving me the night of the opera he had found smooth
sailing for twelve hours. Then a storm came up and he found that
his crew was entirely useless. One man only, the one from whom he
had engaged the sloop, understood anything about navigation. The
rest of the crew were veritable landlubbers when it came to
danger. When the storm struck them they were near the shore, and
there being no harbor the captain gave orders to put to sea. The
men refused to obey, and several entered a boat and rowed for
shore. Their fate my friend never learned. The sloop, left half
manned, blundered before the storm, drifted southward and at
length lost her rudder. For days they drifted, now here, now
there, at the mercy of the sea, now inward with the tide, now out
to sea again. Gradually, however, they floated southward. Once or
twice they sighted outgoing ships, but so far away that their
signals were not seen.</p>
<p>On the sixth day the captain advised my friend to take one of
the boats and, with two sailors, endeavor to reach land or some
ship and send succor to the sloop.</p>
<p>This was done, but the first night out the wind freshened and
the boat was swamped. From that time on until early in the
morning my friend was unconscious. An hour before sunrise he
found himself still in the boat, which was half full of water but
still able to float. The oars were gone and neither of the
sailors could be seen. On to the southeast he saw a dark line
which he knew was the coast, and after bailing out the boat he
took the helm and steered as well as he could for it.</p>
<p>Just before sunrise he was surprised and gladdened to see a
schooner standing straight up out of the sea, half a mile to the
south. He steered for it, and, the tide flowing in, was able to
reach it.</p>
<p>But when directly under the vessel, which was strangely
motionless, he saw no signs of life about it. He called and no
one answered, but seeing a chain hanging down the side, he let
his boat go and climbed by it to the deck.</p>
<p>He expected either to find the vessel deserted or the crew all
below. On the contrary, he was met by a man in officer's dress
the moment he stood upon the deck. This man's face was as
emotionless as a Sphinx, and the greeting he gave my friend was
as cold as a New Yorker could give a poor relation from the west.
No one else appeared on deck, and without inquiring into the
manner in which he had been shipwrecked, or evincing any interest
in him, the officer led him to the cabin, where food and a change
of clothes were given him. On board everything was supernaturally
quiet. The waves lapped against the vessel's sides and that was
all. No figures moved upon the deck, and the vessel itself was
absolutely motionless.</p>
<p>Within a few hours the rescued man was able to move about, and
he made an attempt to reach the upper deck.</p>
<p>He found his cabin door barred.</p>
<p>Calling for help, his call was answered by the man who met him
on the deck of the mysterious vessel. His replies to my friend's
questions were short and unsatisfactory, but this much the latter
soon learned&mdash;that he was a prisoner. Why, he could not
conjecture. Who his jailer was he could not imagine.</p>
<p>For two days he remained in his cabin and to him was given
every necessary attention, although in a non-committal way, the
reason for which he could not understand.</p>
<p>The third day his jailer announced that he was sufficiently
recovered to go on deck, and after an hour in the sea air he was
given another berth. This one, however, proved to be less
securely fastened than his former one, and during the night he
was able to open the door and pass out. Approaching the captain's
cabin he heard voices, and stopping, listened.</p>
<p>"We worked it well again&mdash;the United States cove has made
his inspection and learned nothing."</p>
<p>"Six months more of rest," responded a female voice.</p>
<p>"Yes, but what are we to do with this fellow we picked
up?"</p>
<p>"Are you growing weak? Drownd him!" in the same cool female
voice.</p>
<p>Silence followed, and after a time my friend knew that both
speakers were asleep. Although the reason for his imprisonment
was still as much a mystery as ever, the short conversation he
had heard gave him to understand that foul play was to be
expected, and he took advantage of his liberty to explore the
vessel. After creeping about for half an hour he heard a man's
voice, and approaching the place from which the sound came asked
who was there. The reply nearly took my friend's breath away.</p>
<p>"I'm the captain of this vessel, and that she-devil's
husband!"</p>
<p>A conversation in undertones ensued, and the following story
was told by the man in prison in that strange ship.</p>
<p>"Ten years ago I came to this vessel, the Beacon Light of Half
Moon Bay, as its captain. I brought with me my wife and my best
friend. A year passed happily, and then I overheard a
conversation between my wife and my friend. I heard that my wife
loved him. Aye, worse, that he was her first lover, and that I
had been duped into hiring him as my assistant.</p>
<p>"The next day I met the guilty pair and charged them with
their sin. They said not a word, but that night I was drugged and
caged.</p>
<p>"For a year I have been in this cage and they live as man and
wife. Every six months the United States inspector comes to visit
the ship and bring provisions, but by some means they have always
been able to hide me from him.</p>
<p>"Go back to your berth, lock the door and appear ignorant of
everything. But escape when you can and bring me help."</p>
<p>Such was the substance of the story told my friend. He crept
back and managed to leave his door as he found it. The next night
he left his berth again, secured a small boat and left for the
shore. With what success, you know.</p>
<p>We stayed in Spanishtown the next day, and there was a
terrible storm. An old greaser said it was the worst he had ever
seen. The waves beat high and the wind blew a hurricane. At night
we saw the beacon ship moving in a strange manner, and suddenly
its light went out.</p>
<p>The next morning boats were sent out and they picked up two
dead bodies. One was a woman and the other a man, but the vessel
went down.</p>
<p>A month after, I visited Spanishtown and found the wreckers
busy. They had been searching for the beacon ship and had found
her, and in her they had found a cage, and a man's body in
it.</p>
