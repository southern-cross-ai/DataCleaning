<blockquote>PRODUCTION NOTES:<br>
<br>
The original book was deficient in two respects: First, it had
two CHAPTER Vs; This led to all chapters beyond the first CHAPTER
V being renumbered by adding I. Second, neither the French
original nor this translation had any illustrations. In this
case, a selection of illustrations has been taken from the
accompanying French edition.<br>
<br>
The material used was a scanned image from Google; it had poor
definition and blots in places, and was missing pages 48-9. These
deficiencies have been remedied by scanning another copy. OCR
software was used to generate the text.<br>
<br>
Where a name of major character in the narrative (e.g. Governor
Phillip) is spelled more than one one way, the correct spelling
has been used. Where this has involved the inconsistent use of
French accents, the unaccented version is given (e.g. F.
Peron).<br>
<br>
The few footnotes, denoted by an asterisk, are placed at the end
of the paragraph in which they occur. Obvious spelling errors
have been fixed, but most of the archaic usages, e.g.
"surprized", have been retained where they occur; likewise
"surprised" has been left unchanged.<br>
<br>
Many geographical names are obsolete; these have not been
changed, e.g. "Bay of Sea-dogs". The liberty has been taken to
add a few brief explanatory comments bearing on geographical
nomenclature at their first mention, to give the present names,
e.g. "Shark Bay".<br>
<br>
A few other brief salient comments have been added in square
brackets.<br>
<br>
The intention is to translate about ten pages, towards the end of
the French edition, bearing on early Sydney-Town and Dr. T.
Arndell, and add them to this book in the near
future.<br><br>
<br><b>The political context, aims and achievements of this voyage of discovery,
led by Commander Nicolas Baudin (never named by Peron), are all discussed in detail
in Ernest Scott's <i>Terre Napoleon: A History of French Explorations and Projects in Australia</i>,

<h3><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>SUBSTANCE OF THE REPORT</h3>
<br>
<h4><small>MADE TO</small><br>
<br>
THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT<br>
<br>
BY<br>
<br>
THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE,<br>
<br>
<small>ON THE</small><br>
<br>
VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY TO THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE.</h4>
<p align="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>ON the return of the second vessel belonging to this
expedition, a preliminary report was presented to the Institute,
describing the riches which she had brought for the Museum of
Natural History. Other particulars were afterwards published, of
the discoveries which this expedition has effected in geography,
botany, and mineralogy.</p>
<p>But as the subjects of zoology and anthropology are not yet
perfectly arranged, though all the descriptions are revised and
ready for the press, Messrs. <small>PERON</small> and
<small>LESUEUR</small> have requested the Class to examine the
state of their labours, and it has imposed this task upon us.</p>
<p>Of the five zoologists appointed by the government, two
remained in the Isle of France: two others who were taken ill at
Timor, died through the fatigues of the second campaign, before
they were able to reach, as it were, the shores which they were
to explore. <small>M. PERON</small> being, therefore, the only
one of his colleagues who was left, redoubled his zeal and
activity. <small>M. LESUEUR</small> joined his efforts with those
of his friend, and by the exertions of both, was prepared the
valuable zoological collection which we now possess. More than
one hundred thousand specimens of animals, large and small, are
contained in it; amongst which are several important genera.
There are also many more to be described, and the number of new
species, according to the report of the professors of the museum,
is upwards of two thousand five hundred. Thus by referring to the
amount of those discovered by <small>COOK</small>, in his second
voyage; as well as <small>CARTERET</small>,
<small>WALLIS</small>, <small>FURNEAUX</small>,
<small>MEARS</small>, and even <small>VANCOUVER</small>, we shall
find that Messrs. <small>PERON</small> and <small>LESUEUR</small>
alone, have discovered more new animals than all the naturalist
voyagers of our times.</p>
<p>Owing to an irregular or false method of description, which
has been introduced into science, its progress has been much
retarded. Travellers, and particularly some of those of the
school of <small>LINN&AElig;US</small> have adopted it as more
expeditious, and easy; the consequence has been, that they Lave
only acquired <i>relative</i> descriptions, scarcely sufficient
for scientific explanations at the epoch when they studied, and
which become the more useless in proportion as new subjects are
discovered:&mdash;<small>M. PERON</small> knew how to get over
this error. His descriptions, according with a constant and
regular plan which had been formed, embrace all the details of
the exterior organization of the animal, explain all Its
characters in an absolute manner, and will, in consequence,
survive all the revolutions of methods and of systems.</p>
<p>The manners and customs of the animals, the names given to
them by the natives, the uses to which the latter apply them, and
the modes of hunting or fishing which they adopt, to catch them,
have also attracted the attention of our travellers. Hence, after
having described a great number of new species of
<i>Holothuri&aelig;</i>, they prove that the animals of this
class, so despised on the shores of Europe, are, in India, an
interesting and advantageous article of commerce. Numerous fleets
of Indian ships annually employ several thousand men in the
preparation, or rather desiccation of these animals. Whole
cargoes of them are put up, and from the burning shores to the
north of New Holland, they are transported at a great expence, to
China, where old people purchase them with avidity, under the
idea that they impart new vigour to their exhausted
constitutions.</p>
<p>Equally interesting are <small>M. PERON</small>'s descriptions
of the numerous <i>Phoc&aelig;</i> and cetaceous animals of the
Southern Ocean; for which we shall refer the reader to the text
of his volume. His labours have been ably seconded by the
ingenuity of <small>M. LESUEUR</small>, who, with extreme care,
has produced no less than fifteen hundred drawings or paintings
of the subjects collected by his colleague. These drawings, which
were in general taken from the living animals, will ultimately be
deemed the most complete and valuable collection that has yet
been made by any company of philosophers: for every experiment
which it was possible to make was tried, and its results noted
down by these gentlemen.</p>
<p>Hence it is impossible to do adequate justice to the labours
of these scientific investigators. They are, we do not hesitate
to declare, infinitely superior to all those of the same kind,
that have yet been performed under similar circumstances, whether
national or private.</p>
<p>Hitherto we have only alluded to the zoological labours of
<small>M. PERON</small>, because such being the special object of
his mission, he felt it incumbent upon him to pay, them the
greatest attention, and he has amply fulfilled the wishes of the
government.</p>
<p>Besides these active and connected researches, which occupied
the attention of our philosophers, they were not inattentive to
others of great importance. Their interesting experiments on the
temperature of the sea, and their examination of the
petrifactions of the southern lands, as well as their remarks on
the conformation of the Hottentot women, and on the English whale
fisheries in the southern ocean, have already been laid before
you, and have received your unqualified approbation.</p>
<p>To the Society of the School of Medicine at Paris, <small>M.
PERON</small> has also presented very interesting memoirs on the
dysentery which prevails in hot countries; on the use of the
betel nut; and on the utility of applying meteorological
knowledge to naval tactics&mdash;memoirs which have been strongly
recommended by the Society, and which obtained for the author the
distinction of being enrolled among its members.</p>
<p>Independently of these works, already published or
communicated to the Society in MS. <small>M. PERON</small>
possesses materials for numerous other publications on the most
important subjects: such as observations on the phosphoric
qualities of the sea; and meteorological experiments, repeated
four distinct times in twenty-four hours, each time as opposite
as possible for that period to afford; and over a space
consisting nearly of one-third part of the globe. But the most
material object that still remains for this gentleman to
communicate certainly is, the account of the voyage itself to
which he was attached; the editorship of which was entrusted to
him by the Minister of Marine, and of which the first volume is
now published. We have no doubt that the voyage it describes will
be deemed one of the most useful and interesting that has ever
been performed.</p>
<p>To render a rapid account of the principal events of a voyage
so long and difficult; to describe successively Van Diemen's
Land, and all that vast range of coast which forms the S.W. part
of New Holland; the lands of Nuyts, of Edels, of Endracht, and of
de Witt; to analyse the physical composition of the immense
plains, for the most part sterile and inundated with fresh water;
to display the divers productions natural to places so
circumstanced; to unite all the observations that have been
hitherto published respecting New Holland, in order to form a
general history of the social condition and varied particulars of
that continent; all this has been the plan and intention of the
work of <small>M. PERON</small>. The same method is pursued in
the history of Timor, an island 300 miles long, which, for want
of being known, has heretofore been, considered unworthy the
attention even of those geographers and naturalists who have
minutely examined places of much less utility and importance.</p>
<p>The different regions of which we have spoken, are inhabited
by people of various descriptions. To ascertain their history has
been the particular object of <small>M. PERON</small>. Their
physical constitution; their customs, their manners, their
ornaments, their games, their dances; their exercises, rural and
warlike; their arms; their combats; their hunting and fishing
parties; their prevailing maladies; their habitations and
clothing, and their navigation, have been the subjects of the
labours of the author at every period of his voyage. He has also
formed an interesting vocabulary of the language of the natives;
and such of the English colonists as are distinguished for
information, have indulged him with the fruit of their
experience, and enabled him to make his report as ample and
correct as can possibly be wished.</p>
<p>In the midst of the regions which <small>M. PERON</small>
traversed, whatever he formed establishments, he encountered
rivals on whose veracity no reliance can be placed. He therefore
applied himself in the most particular manner, to every detail,
and qualified himself to give a critical account of a continent
of such extraordinary magnitude and interest. You may have
perceived by his memoir on the subject of the <i>Phoc&aelig;</i>,
with what particularity he investigated subjects of importance,
and with what wisdom he exposes them to the attention of the
public. On the whole, his labours appear to be of the utmost
consequence both to the statesman and philosopher. Perhaps a work
more curious or interesting has never been presented to one or to
the other. Never, perhaps, has the example of law and authority,
shown such a dominion as it has done over the despised colony of
those distant people who inhabit Botany Bay. Never, perhaps, has
there been so conspicuous a specimen of the <i>effect</i> of good
laws upon a criminal people, and the result of which has been to
reform the most abandoned vagabonds, and transmute the most
ignominious robbers of Great Britain into honest and peaceable
subjects!</p>
<p>While <small>M. PERON</small> occupied himself in gaining the
elements of the history of the country and the people which he
visited, his friend <small>LESUEUR</small> was performing his
part of the operations with equal assiduity. All the manners and
customs, the instruments of music, of war, or of hunting and
fishing, have been drawn by him with the utmost accuracy. Besides
these undertakings, he has furnished an admirable atlas of all
the lands and bays which were met with in the voyage.</p>
<p>These candid remarks form a summary of the contents of the
excellent volume which the government has ordered to be printed.
We have to close them with a lamentable catalogue of disasters
which happened to the gentlemen who accompanied the expedition.
<i>Out of twenty-three persons recommended by you to the</i>
First Consul, <i>only three, have returned to their country</i>,
after performing the entire voyage. Some of them being soon
disgusted with their employment, were landed, and left in
different parts; others remained in ill health, at various
places&mdash;but the rest are no more!</p>
<p><small>M. PERON</small> and his friend, however; have overcome
every difficulty, and though they have hitherto received no
reward, but the public estimation and applause, we deem them
worthy of the recompense granted by the government to travellers
who have devoted themselves to such objects as we have described;
being convinced that their works will prove an important
advantage to the study of natural history and philosophy.</p>

Voyage.</b></i><br>
<br>
<small>[<i>From the</i> 22<i>d of March to the</i> 19<i>th of
October,</i> 1800.]</small></p>
<br>
<p>SINCE discoveries in the sciences have been with reason placed
amongst the chief records of the glory and prosperity of nations,
a generous competition has been established, and a new field
opened for such a rivalship among governments; so much the more
honourable, as it is of general utility to all. The exertions of
England have of late years been particularly distinguished; and
in the glorious struggle, it is France alone that has any title
to dispute the superiority.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it must be allowed that the learned English,
placed on the immense theatre of a fifth part of the globe, might
in many respects decide the opinion of Europe in favour of their
own country. The successive labours of Banks, Solander, Sparman,
the two Forsters, Anderson, Mainziez, White, Schmidt, Collins,
Patterson, &amp;c. &amp;c. have attracted the attention, and
given interest to the studies of all the friends of
science.&mdash;How many curious objects have been brought from
this southern continent&mdash;how many valuable observations on
it have in so short a time been written!</p>
<p>In this state of things, the honour of the nation and the
progress of science amongst us combined together to require an
expedition of discovery to the Southern Hemisphere, and the
Institute of France thought it a duty to lay the proposition
before the government.</p>
<p>War at this epoch seemed to rage with redoubled fury; the
political existence of France was in danger; her territory was
usurped; but Buonaparte was first consul; he received, and was
interested in the proposition of the Institute, which, some years
before, had been gratified in nominating him one of its members;
and even at the time when the army of reserve was on the move to
cross the Alps, he gave the order to hasten the execution of this
great undertaking.</p>
<p>In a short time twenty three persons, nominated by him, on the
presentation of the Institution, were appointed to make
scientific enquiries: never had there been such an assemblage of
talent in any prior voyage of discovery; never had there been
such preparations to ensure success.&mdash;Astronomers,
geographers, mineralogists, botanists, zoologists, draughtsmen,
horticulturists, all were found ready, in number double, treble,
or even quintuple.</p>
<p>This part of the object of the expedition must have acquired
considerable interest from the nature of the regions which they
were about to visit. Under latitudes correspondent to those of
our own climates, on a vast continent, and on the numerous
adjoining isles, it was impossible not to discover useful
vegetables, and many interesting subjects in animal life, if
brought into European countries, might easily be naturalized, and
supply new resources for our wants, new auxiliaries to our arts,
and new luxuries for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>Whatever advantageous results were promised by the arrangement
of this voyage, the plan of its operations seemed to ensure all
that the experience of other navigators had acquired on the
subject of the regions we were about to visit until the present
time; all that theory and consideration could deduce thereupon,
and add thereto, had served as a base to this important
undertaking; the irregular winds, the monsoons; the currents had
been calculated in so exact a manner, that the contrarieties
which in the end we experienced were principally occasioned by
the obstinacy of our commander [Nicolas Baudin, <i>never
named</i>], in departing from these valuable instructions.</p>
<p>According to this plan we were to touch at the isle or France,
and take from thence a third ship, smaller than either of ours,
and then to direct our course towards the southern extremity of
Diemen's land, to double the South Cape&mdash;to visit every part
or the straits of Dentrecasteaux&mdash;to go up all the rivers of
this part of Diemen's land, as far as possible,&mdash;to
reconnoitre all the eastern coast of this large island&mdash;to
penetrate into the strait of Bass by that of Banks&mdash;to
ascertain the entrances and outlets of the first of these
straits&mdash;to complete the discovery of the Hunter isles, and
then to stand right in the S.W. coast of New Holland, and
lengthen our course as far as the point where admiral
Dentrecasteaux had proceeded before us&mdash;to go to the back of
the isles St. Pierre and St. Francois,&mdash;to explore that part
of the continent which lies behind those islands, where it is
conjectured there may be a strait supposed to communicate from
this point with the grand gulf of Carpentaria, and which
consequently would divide New Holland into two large islands of
nearly an equal size.</p>
<p>This first part of our labour being terminated, we were to
reconnoitre cape Leuwin, and the unknown part of the coast to the
north of this point; afterwards to ascertain the principal points
of the land of Leuwin, those of Edels and Endracht, which had
been best vaguely mentioned by the first navigators, and the
geography of which consequently partakes of all the imperfection
of the mode of navigation and the instruments of their times; we
were therefore to go up the river of Swans, as far as it was
practicable; to take a particular chart of isle Rottnest and part
of the neighbouring coast; to visit the redoubtable Abrolhos, so
fatal to Pelsar, to obtain a perfect knowledge of the great bay
of Sharks, to determine the different bearings of the land of
Witt, and the rest of the coast N.W. particularly the entrance of
King William's river, the Rosemary isles, &amp;c. and at length
to end this first long cruise at the cape N.W. of New Holland;
making sail from this last point for the Moluccas, we were to
winter at Timor or at Amboyna.</p>
<p>From one or other of these two islands, in passing to the
north of Ceram, we were commanded to make the coast S.W. of New
Guinea, and to explore it as far as captain Cook had done before
use and where it is supposed there may be a strait dividing New
Guinea into several isles; thence turning towards the strait of
Endeavour, we were to make the land at the eastern point of the
great gulf of Carpentaria, where we were to reconnoitre the
principal places, and determine the position of several islands
which are found in old maps. To explore the mouths of the many
pretended rivers which are crowded together in the old plans of
this gulf, and into which no traveller has for a long time
penetrated; and from thence to go the length of coast from
Arnheim, and that of Diemen on the north, we were to terminate
this second cruise at the same cape to the N.W. where we had
ended the first: crossing the Indian sea, and determining the yet
extremely uncertain longitude of the islands called Trials, we
were then ordered to go into port a second time at the Isle of
France, from whence on our return to Europe, which was calculated
to be made in the spring, of the year 1803. we were to explore
that part of the eastern coast of Africa of which geographers are
still in uncertainty; and this last object was to terminate our
long voyage.</p>
<p>Such was the general plan marked out by government to our
commander, the literal execution of which would have made this
voyage one of the most speedy, and fruitful of information that
ever had been undertaken. I shall successively show, according to
the dates when they took place, the different modifications which
this plan experienced; it may however be seen by the succinct
account I have here given, how very important the object of this
expedition was, under the consideration of the improvement of
navigation and geography: above five thousand leagues of coast
that was hitherto but little known were to be explored, Never had
any navigator, Vancouver alone excepted, a more difficult,
mission. In fact, it is not voyages in the open ocean, however
long they may be, that have in their train, such misfortunes and
shipwrecks; it is those, which confined to unknown shores and
savage coasts, have continually new difficulties to encounter,
and new dangers to experience. These difficulties and dangers,
sad appendages to all expeditions calculated and designed to make
particular geographical discoveries, received a more eminent
character from the nature of the shores we were to explore: no
country has yet been discovered that is more difficult to
reconnoitre than New Holland, and every expedition which has been
made to that part of the world has been marked with misfortune,
or very fruitless attempts: thus Pelsar on the western coast, was
one of the first victims to the dangers of these shores: Vlaming
mentioned the remains of wrecks that covered isle Rottnest, when
he landed on that island in the year 1697. And there have been
found there more recently, similar traces of calamity. The brave
captain Dampier, with his long experience, was nearly stranded on
the N.W. coast of this same continent, where Vianen had been
shipwrecked. On the east, Bougainville, surrounded by dangers,
was compelled precipitately to make sail from these parts. Cook
escaped these shores by a kind of miracle; the rock on which his
ship struck, being there incrustated, which alone prevented the
vessel from going to the bottom; on the S.W. Vancouver and
Dentrecasteaux were not more fortunate in the attempt which they
each of them made to determine the geography; and the French
admiral was very near losing both his ships on the same coast.
But a few years have elapsed since the discovery of the strait of
Bass, to the south, and already most of the islands of this gulf
are spread over with pieces of the wrecks of ships which have
been lost on the coast. Very recently the French ship Enterprize
was wrecked on the dangerous isles which lie at the eastern mouth
of the strait.</p>
<p>The history of our voyage, and the dangers to which we were
exposed will also show the extent of these difficulties; and the
loss of the two ships under the command of captain Flinders, who
was sent by the English government to rival our endeavours, will
but too well furnish an additional and deplorable proof.
Notwithstanding so many unfavourable circumstances, the
geographic part of our labours will be greatly interesting to the
European world, and it will doubtlessly be easy for me to show by
the details of our operations, how highly honourable they were to
the French service.</p>
<p>Two ships in the port of Havre had been prepared for this
expedition; the Geographer, a fine corvette of 30 guns, drawing
from 15 to 16 feet water, an excellent sailer, but rather too
slightly built for such service; and the Naturalist, a large and
strong built store-ship, drawing much about the same water as the
Geographer, not so good a sailer, but more seaworthy, and on that
account much superior to the corvette.</p>
<p>Particular care had been taken that the stores might be
abundant, and of the best quality. The naval stores at Havre were
entirely at the disposal of our commander; considerable sums were
granted him for the purchase of supplies of fresh provisions,
such as wines, liquors, syrups, sweet-meats of different kinds,
portable soups, Italian pastes, dry lemonade, extract of beer,
&amp;c. some of the filtering vessels invented by Schmidt,
hand-mills, stoves, apparatus for distilling, &amp;c. &amp;c. had
been shipped on board each of the vessels, with particular
written directions for the preservation of health, by M.
Keraudren, first physician to the navy. Our numerous instruments,
astronomical, surgical, meteorological, geographical, &amp;c. had
been constructed by the most celebrated artists of the capital.
Every thing necessary for chemists, painters, and draughtsmen,
were carefully selected; a numerous library, composed of the best
works in marine subjects, astronomy, geography, natural history,
botany, and voyages, was collected for each ship. All the
instructions relative to scientific researches were written and
prepared by a committee of the Institute, consisting of M. M.
Fleurieu, Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de, Laplace, Bougainville, Cuvier,
Jussieu, Leli&egrave;vre, Camus, and Langl&egrave;s, which is
sufficient to prove, how complete and valuable our instructions
must have been. M. Degerando, a member of the same learned
society, prepared for us an interesting work on the rules to be
followed to the observation of barbarous nations; a national
medal was struck to preserve the memory of this great
undertaking; we were furnished with the most flattering passports
from all the governments of Europe; unlimited credit was open to
us on the principal colonies in Asia and Africa; in a word, the
august chief under whose auspices this important voyage was
planned, had commanded that nothing should be omitted that might
ensure the health and safety of those who were engaged, assist
their labours, and every where secure their independence. In
short, the most liberal promises, repeated in every page of the
instructions of the government, seemed to ensure to our labours,
those honourable rewards, those flattering distinctions, which
have ever been the recompense of similar voyages, and which alone
can indemnify a deserving man for the privations and miseries
which he has experienced.</p>
<p>On the shores to which we were destined were many interesting
nations. It was the wish of the first consul, that as deputies of
Europe, we should conciliate these uninformed people, and appear
among them as friends and benefactors. By his orders the most
useful animals were embarked in our vessels, a number of
interesting trees and shrubs were collected in our ships, with
quantities of such seeds as were most congenial to the
temperature of the climates. The most useful tools, clothing, and
ornaments of every sort, were provided for them, even the most
particular inventions in optics, chemistry, and natural
philosophy, were contributed for their advantage, or to promote
their pleasure.</p>
<p>These numerous arrangements being thus settled, and the ships
fitted out, the naturalists received orders in the early part of
September, 1800, to attend at Havre; I was of the number; a fifth
place of zoologist, bad been given me, from the recommendation of
several illustrious and learned characters.</p>
<p>The officers of this expedition were chosen with the greatest
care; those who aspired to the distinction submitted to the most
strict examinations to obtain admission among us, and all were
worthy of the preference. Not only among the officers was this
regulation observed, but the most inferior rinks of our company
were thus selected, and many young men of respectable families in
Normandy joined our crews, attracted by the ardent wish of youth
for information, and the particular desire of sharing in the
dangers of a distant voyage, which always conveys an idea of
something great and extraordinary, which commands respect, and
which usually obtains for them the honourable mention they
deserve. Among these interesting young men was my worthy
assistant, my estimable friend, M. Lesueur, the dear companion of
all my dangers, of my privations, and of my zeal.</p>
<p>Independent of the officers of the Naturalist, there was on
board this ship, a person well known, called A-Sam, a Chinese
native of Canton, who was made prisoner by a French cruiser, from
on board of a ship belonging to the English Company. A-Sam bad
been successively removed from prison to prison, till he came to
that of Val-de-Grace. The presence of a Chinese in the capital
produced such a sensation, that the chief consul was at length
informed of it. From that moment A-Sam was happy and free; every
comfort was lavishly bestowed on him during his stay at Paris;
and to fill up the measure of his beneficence, the first consul
commanded that A-Sam should be restored to his country and to his
family; he was embarked on board our ships, he was treated like
an officer, and the governors of the Isle of France received an
order to continue to him the same care and respect, till a proper
opportunity occurred of conveying him to China. Happy it is for
those nations, where such care is bestowed on the unfortunate
stranger.</p>

<p align="center"><i><b>Passage from Havre to the Canary
Islands.&mdash;Stay at Teneriffe, &amp;c.</b></i><br>
<br>
<small>[<i>From the</i> 19<i>th Oct. to the</i> 13<i>th Nov.</i>
1800.]</small></p>
<br>
<p>ON the 19th of October, in the morning, the wind and tide
being favourable, order was given for our two ships to depart;
the American frigate, the Portsmouth, returning to the United
States with the ambassadors who came to conclude the peace, went
out with us. At nine <small>A.M.</small> we passed the tower of
Francois the first; a band of music played on, the summit, and
cheered our departure; an immense crowd from all parts covered
the shore, and with one voice and gesture each of the spectators
addressed us with their last adieus and wishes for our safety;
all seemed to express, "Ah, may you, more fortunate than Marion,
Surville, St. Allouarn, La Perouse, and Dentrecasteaux, return
once more to your country, and the gratitude of your
fellow-citizens!"</p>
<p>At ten o'clock we were out of the pier, and took our powder on
board, and sailing towards the English frigate, Proselyte, which
was cruising at the mouth of the port, we communicated our
passports to the commander, and pursued our course.</p>
<p>On the 25th the diminution of the fogs which we had
continually experienced in the channel, and the rising of, the
thermometer, sufficiently proved that we were getting into warmer
climates. The thermometer progressively rose front 8 to 12; we
were then in the gulf of Gascony, almost in the latitude of
Bourdeaux.</p>
<p>On the 27th, at noon, we reckoned ourselves to be in the
latitude of cape Finisterre, which forms the most western point
of Spain and continental Europe. We soon found ourselves off of
Lusitania, which the elegant and sensible author of Telemachus
has celebrated with so much fascinating eloquence, for its
fertility and happy state. The sky was clear, the air was pure,
the sea was calm, the temperature was soft and healthful: in a
word, every object seemed to unite to recall the smiling scenes
of Fenelon. The thermometer at that time was at 15&deg;, the
barometer, since our departure from Havre, had progressively
sunk, it was not up to more than 28 5*.</p>
<blockquote>[* The author not having given a description of the
scale or principle of the thermometers and barometers which were
used, it is not easy to understand the temperature, which he
states to be from 8 to 12. In the original, the height of the
barometer is thus designated, "28<sup><small>i</small></sup>
5<sup><small>l</small></sup>", which must, of course, mean, 28
inches, 5 lines.&mdash;ED.]</blockquote>
<p>On the 30th we passed the mouth of the straits of Gibraltar;
and all that day and the following we continued our course along
the coast of Africa, at the distance of about fifty leagues.</p>
<p>At length, on the 1st of November, at 6 <small>P.M</small>. we
were in sight of the peak of Teide, the mount Nivaria of the
ancients. In the midst of the isles of Palma, Ferrol, and Gomera,
on the west, and those of Canary, Fortaventura, and Lancerot, on
the east, this famous point, known by the name of the peak of
Teneriffe, raises its lofty head. Its large base was at the time
enveloped in clouds, while its top, illuminated by the last rays
of the setting sun, appeared majestically above them. It is true
this mountain is not, as some travellers have asserted, the
highest in the world, in fact, is is not more than 2000 fathom
above the level of the sea, and consequently is exceeded in
height in Europe, by Mont Blanc, and several mountains in Sweden
and Norway; and in America by ten or twelve points of the Andes,
some of which, such as the Antisana, the Chimboraco, &amp;c. are
more than one-third higher; but, it must be allowed that the
insulated situation of this mountain, in the middle of the sea,
its proximity to the celebrated islands which it announces from
far, the recollections it brings to mind, proclaiming by its very
appearance, catastrophes, of which it is itself a prodigious
effect, all concur to give it an importance above all others on
the globe.</p>
<p>While every eye was fixed on this stupendous mountain, to
which we every moment drew nearer, we presently discovered the
islands Lancerot, Fortaventura, and Great Canary, which appeared
in the horizon as an immense cone, much flattened on the top.
Favoured by a leading wind, we hoped to reach anchorage in the
course of the same evening, but we were disappointed in this
expectation, and determined to stretch along shore during the
night. The next morning, at day break we stood in for the land,
which we approached very fast.</p>
<p>The coast appeared steep, blackish, and washed by torrents
into deep furrows, and without any other appearance of vegetation
than a few stunted stalks of the cacalia, the caxtus, and the
euphorbia. Beyond these inhospitable shores were several high
mountains rising one above another, and equally destitute of
verdure, with pointed projections, barren, and in confused rocky
heaps; and again, beyond all these mountains, the peak, raising
its lofty head far above them. Such was the appearance of
Teneriffe from the point Anaga, where we made the land; and from
thence as far as Santa Cruz, where we anchored, the same barren
and wild scenery was displayed. A few miserable habitations at
the foot of these dismal rocks, only served to add to the
melancholy aspect of this part of the island. This account is
certainly very different from the delightful representations of
the Fortunate isles, drawn with such elegance of language by
Horace, Viana, Cairasco, the immortal author of the Jerusalem,
and the author of the poem Dell' Oceano; but these soft
illusions, these cheerful pictures, require the veil of mystery,
and the interest which age and distance give, to support them
against the reality. The Canaries, now stripped of these
brilliant titles of their ancient glory, are no longer truly
interesting but for their wines, and the advantageous situation
of the physical and political revolutions of which they were the
theatre.</p>
<p>In lengthening the coast of Anaga at a little distance from
land, we soon discovered the anchorage and the town of Santa
Cruz. At ten <small>A.M.</small> we cast anchor in 2 fathom
bottom of volcanic sand, oozy and black.</p>
<p>I had yet to complete too great a voyage to remain long at the
Canaries. The situation of these islands, in the midst of the
Atlantic ocean, has submitted them to the observations of a great
number of modern travellers, whose talents and veracity are
equally deserving of respect; there is, besides, a Spanish work
in three volumes octavo, on this archipelago by Joseph de Viera y
Clavijo, who seems to have exhausted all that is interesting of
the ancient and modern history on this subject, including the
revolutions in the Canaries, physical and political, their
population, their several productions, their temperature, &amp;c.
The history of the conquest of these islands necessarily occupies
a great part of the work of Clavijo. In fact, what can be more
interesting and affecting than that of the unfortunate Gouanches,
who, armed only with clubs and staves, fought during almost a
whole century, against the French Portuguese, and Spanish;
opposing courage and perseverance to the number of their enemies,
to the superiority of their arms, and the strength of their
cavalry; making them purchase the possession of these then
wretched isles, with more battles and more blood, than the
conquest of a new maid has since cost them.</p>
<p>From all these considerations I shall confine myself to a few
details, which seem for have escaped the numerous authors who
have written on the subject of this archipelago.</p>
<p>The most general distempers, which we may regard as endemic,
are obstinate bowel complaints, putrid and chronic
diarrh&oelig;as, fevers, scorbutic cachexies, cutaneous eruptions
of different kinds, and the itch, with which most of the
inhabitants are terribly affected: this disorder is much more
dangerous than, but similar to the elephantiasis. These
distempers, with which the lower class of the people are more
particularly afflicted, seem to proceed from the common
cause,&mdash;the unwholesome food which is in general use in the
country. This food consists of a sort of paste called gofio,
which is almost entirely a substitute for bread, and which as
said to be an ancient food of the Gouanches. It is prepared of
barley-meal, or of torrified wheat, ground, then mixed with
water, milk and honey. The rest of their food consists chiefly of
salt fish dried in the sun, and which is caught on the Barbary
coast; they deposit this salt fish in vast storehouses, where the
want of proper care, and the heat occasioned by heaping it in
large quantities, soon causes it to putrify, in a greater or less
degree. The infectious smell which continually exhales from these
heaps of fish in a state of fermentation, is insupportable to
strangers, and annoys them in every part of the town. The very
low price of this salt food makes the consumption of it
prodigious in of the Canaries; but this advantage is miserably
counterbalanced by the many distempers of which it is the
principal cause.</p>
<p>It is probably the same cause that produces the greasy and
livid physiognomy which is remarked in the inhabitants of Santa
Cruz by most travellers. The quality of the water which is
generally used in these islands, is perhaps another cause of
these maladies; and in fact, the scarcity of the springs, which
generally dry up during the hot season, compels the inhabitants
to preserve the rain water in large cisterns, where it remains
for several months, and must consequently imbibe qualities more
or less deleterious to the animal economy.</p>
<p>With regard to venereal complaints, they are very common at
Teneriffe; the cause of which may be ascribed to the heat of the
climate, the indolence of the inhabitants, their excessive
uncleanness, the great number of troops, the quantity of money
which the sailors spend who arrive from all quarters of the
world, the absolute want of any kind of police, the little skill
of the greater part of the officers of health in the country, and
above all, the disgusting amount of the population of common
girls, who in the streets, on the quays, and even in the places
of worship, annoy strangers with offers of destructive and
deceptive pleasures, the source of a long and cruel remorse. The
complaints of this description are indeed more dangerous in this
country than elsewhere, as they are more frequently, attended
with inveterate ulcers.</p>
<p>The ancients, who knew but little of the Canaries, having made
them the abode of the blessed, some enthusiastic authors fancy
themselves obliged to repeat all the ideal and poetical
descriptions of the pagan mythology, when writing on the subject
of these islands. Hence we have recently seen the fertility of
the Canaries celebrated in a manner which is totally repugnant
both to reason and experience.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the first elements of fertility, namely,
water, is so scarce in all the Canaries, that none of them,
properly speaking, have any river; and the springs during the
summer are generally so dry, that the inhabitants are every where
compelled to make use of cisterns to obtain water for their
drink. This scarcity of water is particularly attached to the
general disposition and physical nature of the soil, which
difficulty is not by any means to be removed. The small
dimensions of these islands, their long and narrow form, the
stupendous height of the mountains which cover them in every
direction, the depths of the valleys, their steep declivity
towards the sea, all concur to prevent the formation of rivers,
or even of streams, however inconsiderable. At the same time, the
nature of the soil, which is almost every where basaltic,
prevents the filtration of the waters into the bowels of the
earth, and those which fall on the surface soon evaporate, from
the action of a warm climate.</p>
<p>These physical obstacles to the general fertility of the
Canaries are so obvious, and their effects so powerful, that more
convincing proofs are unnecessary to refute all the exaggerations
of the enthusiastic writers on this subject. In fact, the
contrary to all this has been proved by the following axioms of a
work, the original of which is in my possession, and which was
sent me by one of the best informed merchants of this
archipelago.</p>
<p>1st, That Teneriffe, the most considerable of these isles, as
well as Palma, and Ferrol, do not produce sufficient subsistence
for their miserable population.</p>
<p>2dly, That Canary, and Gomera produce only enough for their
own consumption.</p>
<p>3dly, That Lancerot and Fortaventura are the store-houses of
the Canaries; but that the <i>ungrateful and sandy soil</i> (I
use the expressions of the manuscript) requires abundant rains to
produce the crops; and that when these fail, want of bread and
famine reign throughout the archipelago.</p>
<p>4thly, That even when the harvests are most abundant the
Canaries have no surplus to export; but, on the contrary, they
are compelled almost every year to import large cargoes from
Spain, America, or even from the north of Germany, for the
purchase of which great part of the wines of the archipelago are
employed.</p>
<p>The Canaries, in their actual state, far from enriching their
metropolis, cost it a considerable sum for the support of their
fortifications and garrisons; but, in the hands of the English,
these colonies would soon become valuable, dependently of their
situation. Great Britain would be in a great measure freed from
the heavy duties it annually pays to France, Spain, and Portugal,
for the wines and brandies which these three powers import from
thence. This was, doubtlessly, the principal reason which induced
the English government to attempt the conquest of the Canaries
during the last war. A numerous fleet under the command of
admiral Nelson, appeared suddenly before Teneriffe in the year
1796; but this attack concluded very differently from that in the
year 1657, when admiral Blake succeeded in the attempt. Nelson
lost an arm in the enterprise; part of his troops and stores,
were taken by the Spaniards, or sunk by the artillery of the
forts. In vain, by favour of the darkness, did he succeed in
making a landing, and even is taking possession of the armoury;
repelled on all sides by the Spanish militia and troops, he was
compelled to capitulate, and to sign an agreement to leave the
archipelago. The Canarians still show with pride, the British
flags which they look on this occasion, depending from the dome
of their principal church; they also show the long-boat of
Nelson's ship, on board of which he lost his arm. In this
honourable defence the crews of several French ships
distinguished themselves, who at the time of the appearance of
the English, hastened to take arms, and who contributed much, by
their example, to excite the courage of the militia and troops of
the country.</p>
<p>Since this attack of Nelson on the Canaries, the garrisons of
these islands have been considerably reinforced. At the time we
were there, they reckoned 4500 regular troops well disciplined
and maintained; most of these troops are at Teneriffe, which can
also furnish near 8000 militia. Independent of this increase in
the number of their troops, an attack on Santa Cruz would now be
very difficult, from the commanding situation of a new fort,
which the last governor built on a steep rock, and the batteries
of which are pointed downwards to the roadstead, and cross the
fire of the square tower which defends the mole.</p>
<p>The nature of our mission, the good intelligence between the
two governments, the late successes of France, the recent peace
with America, all concurred to ensure us the most obliging and
flattering reception from the Spaniards. Our brave allies were
particularly pleased in interrogating us on the subject of our
last campaign in Italy, the passage of the Alps, the battle of
Marengo, and the rapid succession of prodigies of which we
happened to give them the first account. All seemed to vie with
each other in shewing every demonstration of their respect and
admiration for France. Ah! if it is ever permitted for an honest
man to be proud of hie country, it doubtlessly should be in such
circumstances, when, far from his fellow-citizens, he sees among
strangers that every idea of greatness, glory and power, is
attached to the very name of his country!</p>
<p>Among those with whom I had the honour of being acquainted at
Teneriffe, and from whom I received particular attention, I ought
to mention the duke of Bethancourt, colonel of the Ultonia
regiment, a descendant of the famous Jean de Bethancourt, a
Norman nobleman, who was at once the conqueror and legislator of
the Canaries, one of the greatest men of the fifteenth century,
which was so prolific prodigies. John of Bethancourt had all the
heroism, all the romantic enthusiasm of his time, without its
ignorance, fanaticism and ferocity. His memory, eternally dear to
the Canarians, will be, for his latest descendants, an
unalienable title to the most flattering consideration; and the
man of whom I speak, is entitled to the esteem of the worthy, for
his own particular merits.</p>
<p>The marquis de Nava possesses a beautiful botanic garden at
the Orotava; this nobleman dedicates a part of his large income
to naturalize in these isles every species of vegetables which
might extend their commerce, enrich their soil, adorn their
vallies, and clothe their naked and barren mountains with
verdure. The marquis de Nava ought to secure the esteem and
notice of all good men, as one of the benefactors of his
country.</p>
<p>At Laguna, M. Savignon, physician to the government, it much
respected for his general character, and his extensive knowledge
in his profession.</p>
<p>M. Cologant, in whose respectable family, benevolence to
French travellers seems to be hereditary, gave us every
information on the subject of the last eruption of the volcano of
Cahorra; and also lent us a tinted drawing, which he had himself
made, of the appearance of the volcano at the time: this was at
the service of every one among us who wished to copy it. On my
return to Europe, happening to notice this representation in a
work of M. Bory, I was sorry not to see the addition of the name
of the real author, because omissions of this kind, however
involuntary they may be, are often sufficient cause of changing,
or even destroying the liberal confidence of strangers towards
European travellers, a confidence of which I have received so
many generous proofs in the course of this voyage.</p>
<p>During our stay at Teneriffe, the barometer continued without
any particular change at from 28<sup><small>i</small></sup>
3<sup><small>l</small></sup> to 28<sup><small>i</small></sup>
4<sup><small>l</small></sup>; the thermometer on board our ships
in the shade at noon, varied from 17 to 20, and gave me then for
the mean 18.5.&mdash;results conformable to the precedents
obtained by Lamanon, and by M. Labillardi&egrave;re, at the same
place, and under the same circumstances.</p>
<p>Of all the hypotheses to which the traditions of the ancients
on the Canaries have given rise, doubtlessly the most singular,
and the most generally admitted, is that of the existence of a
large continent, of which these isles were a part; and which,
under the name of Atlantides, then occupied the vast ocean which
now separates. Africa from the New World. This opinion has been
maintained by some travellers, who are themselves deceived by the
authority of Plato, or by the sophisms of several modern writers.
Volumes of compilations and citations have been made on this
subject, and yet the truth remains still in obscurity, and we are
bewildered in dissertations and hypotheses, instead of comparing
the actual physical constitution of the countries which they
pretend were formerly connected. In this last point of view, M.
Bailly, one of our fellow-travellers, considered the Canaries,
and discussed the important question of the existence of the
Atlantides. I shall here present the interesting observations of
this enlightened mineralogist.</p>
<p>"Several celebrated writers (says M. Bailly), from the
authority of Plato, have spoken of the existence of the
Atlantides, the greater part of whom, who admit the fact, affect
to see in the Canary isles, described by the ancients under the
name of the Fortunate islands, the remains of that land which,
according to many, could not have occupied a less space than what
is comprised between Africa and America, and probably made part
of these two continents uniting them by its isthmus. The chain of
mountains described by the name of Mount Atlas and which
stretches along the north part of Africa, serves very much to
support their opinions on this subject, for they see only in the
isles of which we are treating, the continuation of that chain,
which by an inconsiderable winding could have been connected with
the Azores. They might as easily have proved a connection between
the Cape de Verd islands, and the mountains of the interior of
Africa. The same authority which thus confounded the Canaries,
the Azores; and the Cape de Verd islands, might have justified
the reunion of all the other Atlantic isles to the lost
continent, such as Tristan d'Acunha, Ascension, St. Matthew,
Trinidad, St. Helena, Noronha, &amp;c.; for it would not
certainly be a bolder conjecture than that of extending the
limits of a larger tract of land (according to the high priest of
Sa&iuml;s) than Asia and Lybia together, as far as the last
mentioned isles.</p>
<p>"For the establishment of a reunion so extraordinary and
important, we are, however, to this day confined to some vague
traditions of the ancients; for an inspection of the charts does
not assist. The physical state of the pretended remains of the
Atlantides, and of the continents to which we would connect or
assimilate them, has never been compared; it is this circumstance
which I propose here to point out.</p>
<p>"All travellers agree in opinion, that the chains of mountains
which run through Africa and America are essentially primitive;
that the lands situated between them are of secondary or tertiary
origin, and that those parts which are subject to subterranean
fires are comparatively few.</p>
<p>"It is not so with respect to the islands dispersed in the
Atlantic ocean; these are all exclusively volcanic, whether they
are isolated, like Ascension, St. Helena, Trinidad, Madeira,
&amp;c. or in clusters, like the Azores, the Canaries, the Cape
de Verd islands, Tristan d'Acunha, and those which surround it,
&amp;c. These isles appear to have risen from the bottom of a
deep sea; their coasts are very steep, and almost perpendicular;
the channels which separate them are unfathomable; the banks and
shoals which are so common in other archipelagos, are not to be
found among these. If sometimes an isolated rock is observed, it
either seems to be attached to some neighbouring island, or else
it is entirely distinct; in either case, the same observations
which apply to other larger Atlantic islands will also apply to
these. There is not to be seen in any of them granites or real
porphyrys, or any such primitive stones; and the calcareous
substances which are found in some of them are merely shells
collected together, or other similar productions.</p>
<p>"From these simple observations it evidently results, that a
difference so general and absolute as that between the actual
constitution of the Atlantic isles, and that of the neighbouring
continent, should exclude every idea of an origin in common, or
even of their being connected in former times. From the same
facts we may also conclude, that the hypotheses on which they
attempt to establish the opinion that the Atlantic isles are the
remains of an ancient continent, is not to be supported, for all
these islands being exclusively volcanic, it follows that the
Atlantide must have been a continent entirely volcanic, or else
that the volcanic parts of this continent were spared in the
catastrophe which swallowed all the rest: both one and the other
of these suppositions are equally improbable."</p>

<p align="center"><i><b>Passage from the Canaries to the Isle of
France.</b></i><br>
<br>
<small>[<i>From Nov.</i> 13<i>th,</i> 1800, <i>to March</i>
15<i>th,</i> 1801.]</small><br></p>
<p>ON the 13th of November, in the evening, after shipping the
provisions for which we had staid at the Canaries, we prepared to
continue our voyage. At four o'clock we passed the little town of
Candelaria, celebrated for the miracles of the virgin of that
name. All this part of the island of Teneriffe appears to be as
wild and barren as the coast of Anaga. In the evening we
discovered the isles of Gomera and Palma, which we left to the
west, and passed in the night.</p>
<p>On the 15th we were already under the tropic of Cancer. Op the
18th we concluded ourselves to be in the latitude of the Cape de
Verd islands. From this point till we approached the Gambia, the
wind was favourable, and we made considerable way, but we now
experienced some obstinate calms, which prevented us from
crossing the equator before the 19th of December, and in 21&deg;
6' only of west longitude.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the attempts of our commander to pass the line
by 10&deg; or 12&deg;, all his man&oelig;uvres to effect this
were constantly counteracted by the calms, the currents, or the
winds. It is worthy of remark, that admiral Dentrecasteaux, nine
years before, endeavouring to follow a like course to cross the
equator by 16 or 18, experienced the same obstacles, and was,
like us, driven by the winds and currents as far as under the
26th degree of west longitude.</p>
<p>On the 30th of December we passed, for the first time, the
tropic of Capricorn. From the 23d to the 24th of January, 1801,
we cut the meridian of Paris, in 36&deg; south latitude.</p>
<p>On the 3d of February we doubled the Cape of Good Hope, at the
distance of eight or ten leagues. We easily distinguished the
mountain called the Table, notwithstanding the fogs with which it
was at that time enveloped.</p>
<p>From the 3d to the 4th of March we experienced sudden and
violent squalls, which, however, did not continue more than 24
hours, but they were so violent that the barometer during the
time sunk 10 inches 8 lines. The Naturalist received some damage
in her sails. We now found ourselves off the Mozambique channel,
a latitude where violent storms are very frequent. On the 10th of
March we again crossed the tropic of Capricorn. At length, on the
13th, in the evening, we were in sight of the mountains of the
Isle of France, after a voyage of one hundred and forty-five
days, reckoning from the time of our departure from Europe, which
made this one of the longest passages we could make in a voyage
of the kind. The obstinacy of our commander in ranging the coast
of Africa, was the chief cause of this delay, and as it had,
throughout the whole of our operations, the most fatal influence,
I think I ought to dwell an instant on the subject.</p>
<p>Two courses naturally present themselves to the navigator who,
on leaving Europe, intends to double the Cape of Good Hope: the
one which may be called the coasting voyage, consists in ranging
the coast of Africa, and crossing the equator as much to the east
as possible. By the other course, on the contrary, after having
reached the latitude of the Cape de Verd islands, steering to the
west, and making for the eastern coast of America, so as not to
cross the line but in 25, or even 30 degrees longitude west from
the meridian of Paris.</p>
<p>Being arrived at about the 33d degree of south latitude, we at
first found the wind N.W. then west, by favour of which we could
rapidly make to the eastward, to double the famous cape of which
we have spoken.</p>
<p>Doubtless if we had only to compare the absolute distance of
these two courses, we should not hesitate to chase the coasting
voyage along the shores of Africa; but the well-informed
navigator takes into his calculation other circumstances than the
idle consideration of relative geographical positions: he is not
ignorant that the most considerable distances in appearance make
little against him if he is but favoured by the wind and tides;
that the shortest passage, on the contrary, may be retarded for
weeks and months, if the same winds and currents oppose
themselves to its progress, or what may retard him still more,
obstinate calms, which keep his vessel almost immoveable on the
surface of the waves.</p>
<p>Hence all these inconveniences are attached to the coasting of
the N.W. shores of Africa. In fact, experience teaches us that
the currents which prevail in this part of the Atlantic, set to
the N.W. and in fine, that of all the known seas, the one which
washes the equatorial part of the western coast of Africa, is
most subject to calms. All well-informed navigators agree on the
subject of these facts, and capt. Dampier, whose writings are the
fruit of a long experience, and extremely valuable for their
exactness, has particularly developed this subject in his
treatise on the winds.</p>
<p>By the course, standing out to sea, the currents which are so
fatal to the coaster, are favourable to those who bear away to
the west: and the calms which am so dreadful on the African
shores are seldom experienced in the open ocean, and never last
long in the middle of the Atlantic. Whether the shelter of a
large continent produces or occasions them in its vicinity, or
that this phenomenon may be ascribed to any other physical cause,
I cannot decide: in short, the westerly winds which the navigator
wants on his way back, towards the 33d or the 35th degree south,
are so constant in these last latitudes, that he may very fairly
calculate on their assistance.</p>
<p>It is for good reasons that experienced navigators prefer the
western course, although it appears to be the longest; that this
course is certainly the best, has been sufficiently proved, ever
since the first voyages of Schouten. This celebrated traveller
relates, that during his first voyage from Europe to the Indies,
in the year 1658, the captain of the vessel in which he had
embarked, and who was an experienced seaman, had a dispute with
the commander of another ship belonging to the Dutch company,
which sailed as consort with him to Batavia. Schouten's captain
being influenced by the reasons I have stated, chose to steer to
the west; the other, on the contrary, deceived by appearances and
his own inexperience, persisted that it was best to lengthen the
coast of Africa. Thus, divided in opinion, each pursued a
different course; but the experiment was so much in favour of
Schouten's captain, that he gained near two months on the
inexperienced coaster.</p>
<p>It is from a well-founded knowledge of all these
circumstances, that the English ships which are bound to the
Indies are in the habit of steering towards the coast of Brazil,
so as not to cross the line but in 28&deg;, 30&deg;, or even in
33&deg; west longitude; and the Company's ships have not in that
respect different system from that of private vessels.</p>
<p>Farther, it is not only in doubling the Cape of Good Hope that
they have occasion to fear the currents, and the calms on the
coast of Africa; the voyages even which arc: every day made to
Malembo, to Loango, or the coast of Angola, frequently encounter
the most irksome delays; and here again experience teaches us,
that to avoid the calms it is necessary to stretch as far as
possible from the gulf of Guinea, and consequently to stand to
the west, to return back, and sometimes even to the south, to
make the point of destination; the same precaution should be
taken by those who go from Loango for the Antilles. Captain
Dampier, in fact, says, that it is necessary in such a
navigation, to stand right to the westward, for the space of
30&deg; or even 35&deg;, before attempting to cross the line to
return northward, and to take afterwards a course N.W. This
route, he observes, is that of the most able navigators, and
however long it may appear, it is however much shorter in
reality, for those who cross the equator too far to the east to
coast the shores of Africa, and stand first to the N.W. are
almost always obnoxious to obstinate calms, and assailed by
tempests, which are more frequent and more dangerous in the
neighbourhood of the coast of Guinea than in the midst of the
Atlantic ocean.</p>
<p>In short, M. de Granpr&eacute;, whose evidence we may produce
here, because he has traversed these seas for a long time,
exclaims with a just severity against those ignorant or timid
commanders, who, notwithstanding the fatal experience of other
navigators, continue even yet to coast along the shores of
Africa. He relates, among other examples or this sort, that of a
vessel, which, detained by the calms, and obstructed by the
currents, remained eleven months in its course from France to the
coast of Angola. In a word, if it was not foreign to the nature
of my work to prolong the discussion, it would be easy to produce
such a number of facts and observations in favour of the course
to the west, as would amount to demonstration; but it is
sufficient for my present purpose, to enable the reader to judge
of the extent of the fault of our commander, in persisting to
steer along the coast of Africa. We shall soon find, that from
this preposterous obstinacy, which was necessarily followed by a
consequence plain to foresee and easy to evade, he was forced
from the beginning of the voyage to disturb and discompose all
the regularity of the operations which had been prescribed for
him to follow: Thus, in the execution of the most important
undertakings, the slightest faults produce consequences at once
grievous and irreparable!</p>
<p>Doubtless, the relation of a passage to the Indies seems to
promise but little that can now be interesting, or to furnish any
new observations at a time when so many vessels of every nation
have so often repeated the voyage in the course of the last three
centuries. This, however, is not the fact, and to prove it, we
have only to cast an eye over the many relations of the sort that
have been written at different periods, We shall there see, that
almost every navigator occupied exclusively on the most general
or trivial objects, has only repeated what his predecessors had
said a hundred times before him, neglecting every new subject of
observation which this immense scene continually presents,
comprising at once the whole length of the Atlantic ocean, the
Indian sea, the two temperate zones, and the whole of the
equinoctial line. Moreover, the subject will always furnish many
interesting observations on the comparison of the temperature of
the atmosphere in different latitudes of both hemispheres, on the
variations of the barometer and the hygrometer in similar
circumstances; the temperature of the sea on its surface,
compared at different times of the day and night, with that of
the atmosphere, &amp;c.&mdash;Does not this view of the subject
present a new field for the investigation of the learned
traveller? while the heat of the ocean in great depths below the
surface, is another fruitful source of observation and experiment
that is highly interesting. Are we not still unacquainted with
the depths of the seas, and the relative proportions of the
saltness of their waters? Are we not still uncertain of the real
cause of the phosphorescence of the ocean, a phenomenon so
astonishing, so common, and nevertheless so little understood:
and if we carry our investigations still farther, we shall
discover an astonishing number of pelagians, animals hitherto
unknown, marine plants, and zoophytes, which seem assembled as it
were to present new wonders to the observer, of their
organizations, and to the naturalist, of their properties.</p>
<p>It may be preferable to occupy one's self at this day with
other objects than flying-fish, gold fish, sharks, &amp;c.
&amp;c. and it is voyages of this description, and these alone,
which are capable of furnishing the valuable materials of a
physical and meteorological chart of the seas; a chart of which
science stands so much in need, and where hitherto we have sought
in vain for the simple elements, amidst a crowd of subjects which
continually multiply themselves, and reproduce each other.</p>
<p>In extending my researches to each of the subjects I have
mentioned, I have wished rather to point out this new pursuit,
which I do not pretend to have gone through; but the results I
have gained from my first attempts appear to be of such utility,
that I think it my duty to give a slight sketch of them here,
reserving all the details of the observations of which they are
the fruit, for a future time and for a future work.</p>

of the Thermometer&mdash;State of the Hygrometer&mdash;Of the
Barometer&mdash;Agreement between them&mdash;The
Winds&mdash;Their Agreement with the Barometer&mdash;Atmospheric
Phenomena&mdash;General Results.</b></i><br></p>
<p>THE meteorological observations were made with the
thermometers of Dolland and Mossy; barometers made by the last
mentioned artist, and hygrometers by Richer. To compare them as
exactly with each other as possible, I made it an invariable rule
from the beginning of our voyage to take an observation four
times each day, at the hours most opposite; that is to say, at
six in the morning and at six in the evening, at midnight, and at
twelve at noon in the open air, and on the poop of our vessel,
and as often besides as I conveniently could. This first series
of my labours furnished me with the the following general
results:</p>
<p>1st, The temperature of the thermometer rose progressively as
we drew near the equator.</p>
<p>2d, It sunk progressively as we went from the equator.</p>
<p>3d, The proportion of its rising and sinking was not equal in
both hemispheres, the mean degree of the heat in the southern
hemisphere having been weaker than in the correspondent northern
latitudes.</p>
<p>4th, In other respects, every thing being as usual, the
temperature of the atmosphere between the tropics is weaker in
open sea than in the interior of the continents or even oil the
islands. We did not really experience more than 23&deg; of heat
under the line, and the mean degree is much below this last
point.</p>
<p>5th, The variations of the temperature become weaker, and not
so frequent the nearer we approach the equator, and <i>vice
versa</i>.</p>
<p>6th, Not only the variations of the temperature are more
inconsiderable from one day, or even from one month to another,
between the tropics, and in open sea, but also, in general, there
is but little difference between the temperature of the day taken
in the shade at noon, and that of the night at midnight: thus,
forty observations of this sort, taken from the 22d of November
to the 1st of December,1800, produced me a sum total of 909,
6&deg; of heat: noon produced 233, and midnight 222, 7, which
makes scarcely one degree of difference for each day; a
phenomenon so much the more remarkable, as it is known from the
experiments of Miller, Beze, Pison, Halley, Lister, &amp;c. that
the difference of heat in the day and night is greater in the
equinoctial regions, on shore, and that we ourselves should have
occasion to draw conclusions from these facts suited to the
objects of our enquiries.</p>
<p>We shall now proceed to describe the state of the hygrometer,
being the first time that this valuable instrument crossed the
seas: it was thought beforehand that its observation would
furnish many important results; and we shall see that these
expectations were well founded.</p>
<p>7th, Every thing in other respects being as usual, the it
hygrometer shews a proportion of humidity so much the stronger,
the nearer we approach the equator.</p>
<p>8th, The absolute proportion of the atmospheric humidity
becomes so much the less, the nearer we approach either of the
poles.</p>
<p>9th, The variations of the hygrometer are so much the weaker
and less frequent, as we observe this instrument nearer the
equator, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<p>10th, The hygrometer, in the midst of the equatorial legions,
remains almost invariably in a state Of extreme saturation. We
proceed next to the state of the barometer.</p>
<p>11th, The barometer in general sinks the more we approach the
equator.</p>
<p>12th, It rises progressively as we go farther from the
equator.</p>
<p>13th, The variations of the barometer are neither frequent nor
striking, when this instrument is observed near the equator, and
<i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<p>14th, The equality of level of the place where the observation
is made, the distance or absence of every cause of perturbation
foreign to the atmosphere, gives to the barometer at sea, a more
regular action, more easily admitting of comparison in its
variations than it would do in the midst of a continent. That
instrument in this respect is eminently useful to mariners, and
our own experience leaves us no doubt on this head.</p>
<p>On the subject of the agreement between the hygrometer and the
barometer we observe:</p>
<p>15th, That the variations of the barometer have an
incontestible agreement with those of the hygrometer.</p>
<p>16th, The falling of the mercury corresponds in the greatest
number of cases with the increase of humidity. It appears as much
more considerable as the other becomes greater.</p>
<p>17th, The rising of the quicksilver almost always corresponds
with the diminution of the humidity of the atmosphere; it is as
much greater (other circumstances not interfering); as that
diminution is marked more considerably by the hygrometer.</p>
<p>18th, The winds become by degrees lighter and more constant,
as the navigator approaches the equinoctial regions, and <i>vice
versa</i>.</p>
<p>The agreement of the wind with the barometer is as
follows:</p>
<p>19th, The winds appear to exercise a real action, altogether
independent of the variations of the barometer, for I have
noticed frequently that the mercury fell almost suddenly 3, 4, 5,
6, or even 8 lines, in spite of the rapid diminution of, the
humidity of the atmosphere; a circumstance which, after the two
exclusive theories of Deluc, ought to have occasioned, on the
contrary, the ascension of the mercury.</p>
<p>20th, This effect of the winds upon the barometer (other
circumstances not interfering) appeared to me to be generally in
a ratio composed of their least temperature, and of their
celerity.</p>
<p>On the atmospheric phenomena I made the following
observations:</p>
<p>21st, The vaporous appearance of the sky, to be observed
towards the middle of the day, in all the seas of the equinoctial
regions, and denominated by navigators, grey sky, thick horizon,
vaporous horizon, &amp;c. &amp;c.; the astonishing splendour of
the rising and setting sun in the same climates; the serenity of
the sky during the night, so strongly contrasted with the
vaporous state of the atmosphere during the day; the frequent,
and almost instantaneous formation of the menacing clouds,
described by so many voyagers; of the tempests known by the name
of equinoctial squalls; the prodigious power of the humidity,
from which it is almost impossible to preserve any thing, however
valuable; the abundance of the rains, and the size of the drops
which fall; all these phenomena, inexplicable even to this day in
equatorial meteorology, appear to me to depend almost entirely on
the hygrometrical state of the atmosphere in these parallels of
latitude; and the theory of atmospheric refractions seems to me
to depend in an important degree on such observations.</p>
<p>The general results of the above observations are:</p>
<p>22d, If we add to our own observations those of M. de
Humboldt, on the diminution of intensity of the magnetic force
towards the equator, it follows that all the great physical
phenomena experience modifications, the more important in
proportion as we approach towards that point: thus, the force of
the weight, and the intensity of the magnetic virtue diminish;
the barometer sinks, the thermometer rises; the action of the
hygrometer tends to the point of saturation. The winds become
lighter and more constant; the action of all the instruments
becomes at the same time more regular, and their variations in
consequence are less.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<p align="center"><i><b>Temperature of the Sea&mdash;Saltness of
the Water&mdash;Its Phosphorescence&mdash;Observations on Natural
History.</b></i><br></p>
<p>UNDER similar circumstances, and at the time of my
meteorological observations, I entered on a course of experiments
on the subject of the agreement between the temperature of the
sea on its surface, with that of the atmosphere; the results of
which experiments I have made known to the Institution.</p>
<p>With an apparatus, such as I judged most proper for the
purpose, I attempted to make, at the same time with my friend and
colleague, M. Depuch, some observations on the temperature of the
ocean, at great depths from the surface, and soon began to doubt
the gradual and progressive coldness of the waters of the sea, in
proportion as we penetrated deeper into its abyss. I shall have
occasion, in the sequel, to recur again to this part of my
labours. Among the most important observations on the physical
history of the sea, we must doubtless reckon those whose object
is to determine the relative and absolute proportion of the
saltness of the waters in different latitudes, and at different
depths; unto this time, however, few experiments of the sort have
been made, and even these first attempts appear to me to be
totally wrong in their primary principles, and not of any
essential use in their results. In short, the specific weight
taken for the basis of their experiments by Ingenhouz,
Labillardi&egrave;re, and M. Humboldt, in my opinion, is a method
incapable of furnishing any given rule, because of the immense
quantity of animalcule, often microscopic, which breed And
multiply in sea-water, and which, though themselves distinct from
the salts, perhaps do not in a less degree affect the specific
weight of the liquid in which they are suspended, or rather, in a
state of solution, on account of the gelatinous mucus which
transudes from every part of their surface, and which gives to
the purest sea-water that character of viscosity which it is
always found to possess.</p>
<p>To collect sea-water, and keep it in bottles, like Sparman, is
a still worse method; the putrefaction to which these waters are
liable, cannot fail to change all the constituent principles, and
thus produce, as we have already said, by the spontaneous
decomposition, innumerable animalcul&aelig;.</p>
<p>To obviate these difficulties, it was my intention to collect,
in every five degrees of latitude, a sufficient quantity of sea
water, 100 pounds for example, to filter it through paper, and
thus determine the specific weight with the areometer of
Nicholson; a very defective method, as I have before observed,
but which, being only accessary to my other experiments, was so
much the more useful, as the water, by filtering, would be
previously separated from the greatest part of other substances
not connected with it. After this first operation, I proposed to
put the water into one of the alembics which we had from
government, and to carry on the evaporation to the point of
drawing together as much as possible all the saline substances
which it might contain in solution, and then reuniting the
remainder of each of these distillations, in one or more vessels,
hermetically sealed, proposed at my return to confide such
valuable objects of experiment to M. Fourcroy, who would
doubtless have analysed them correctly. This method of
investigation, independent of the exact results which it appears
to be capable of demonstrating, has the additional advantage of
requiring only a succession of operations very easy to be pursued
even on board a ship, and it the same time to render unnecessary
all those minute details of fine analysis which cannot be
properly attended to in the midst of the inconvenience that is
necessarily attendant on a voyage.&mdash;Unfortunately, I was
compelled in this instance, as in many others, to yield to the
spirit of opposition in our commander; and I should have avoided
the mention of this proposed course of experiments, if it had
not, appeared to me to be necessary to engage the interest of the
philosopher and traveller on the subject of so curious a part of
the history of the seas, and to make known to them so easy and
correct a method of making similar experiments.</p>
<p>The phosphorescence of the waters of the ocean is another
curious and interesting subject of astonishment and
investigation, and which has, ever since the days of Aristotle
and Pliny, engaged the attention of the voyager. However
extraordinary the slight sketch which I have here given of the
principal phenomena of the phosphorescence of the sea, may appear
to the reader, there is not one single word that I have not
borrowed from the observations of those not liable to either
enthusiasm or exaggeration. It will suffice to mention Cook, La
Perouse, Labillardi&egrave;re, Vancouver, Banks, Sparman,
Solander, Lamanon, Dapr&eacute;s de la Manvillette, Le Gentil,
Adanson, Fleurieu, Marchand, Stavorinus, Spallanzani, Bourzeis,
Linn&aelig;us, Pison, Hunter, Byron, Beal, Adler, Rathgeb,
Martens, De Gennes, Hierne, Dagelet, Dicquemarre, Bacon,
Lescarbot, Loeflingius, Shaw, Sloane, Tachart, Dombey, Ozanam,
Barter, Tarnstr&ouml;m, Marsigli, Kalm, Nassau, Pontoppidan,
Morogue, Phipps, Poutrincourt, Heittmanne, Kirchmayer, Anson,
Frezier, Lemaire, Van-neck, Rhumpe, Rogers, Drake, &amp;c. How
numerous and varied are these phenomena! Here the surface of the
ocean sparkles and shines as far as the eye can reach, like a
sheet of silver, when electrified in the dark&mdash;there it
unfolds its waters in immense sheets of sulphur and flaming
bitumen; in another place if resembles a sea of milk, the
extremities of which are not to be perceived. The minuti&aelig;
of these great phenomena are not less to be admired than the
grandeur of the whole. Bernardin de Saint Pierre has described
with enthusiasm those shining stars which seem to dart by
thousands from the bottom of the waters, and of which, he justly
adds, those of our artificial fire-works are but a feeble
imitation. Others have made mention of those masses of fire which
roll on the waves like so many enormous red balls, and of which
we ourselves saw some that did not appear to be less than twenty
feet in diameter. Many seamen have observed fiery parallelograms,
cones of light inverted, whirling about on their points, shining
garlands and luminous serpents. In some places of the seas are to
be perceived sparks of fire springing from the surface; in
another part bodies of light and phosphorus are seen moving on
the waves in the midst of darkness. Sometimes the ocean appears
as if ornamented by an immense steep of moving light, whose
undulating action seems to reach the edge of the horizon; all
these phenomena, and many others which I forbear to mention,
however marvellous they may appear, are nevertheless
incontestible. They have been many times described by navigators
of undoubted veracity, and I have myself observed most of the
appearances which I have described, in different parts of the
seas.</p>
<p>How many theories have been written in explanation of these
prodigies. Sometimes, the supposed spirit of the salts, the
bitumen, the petroleum, and animal oils, have been mentioned as
the causes of these phenomena; sometimes, the spawn of the
fishes, and other marine productions; the remains of marine
animals have been thought sufficient to produce these
extraordinary effects: the gelatinous mucus which continually
transudes from fish, zoophytes, &amp;c. &amp;c. are by others
said to occasion such brilliant appearances. Some naturalists
have admitted a kind of moving putrefaction in the superficial
beds of the sea, while some have thought it to proceed from the
motion of light and shade; and others have considered it as
occasioned exclusively by reflection. Electricity has also
supplied some celebrated voyagers with ingenious conjectures on
the subject; and more recently, phosphorus and similar
productions have opened a new field for new hypotheses; some have
supposed these phenomena totally distinct, others have attributed
them to the influence of hydrogen. In a word, there is no sort of
conjecture, probable or even absurd, which has not been adopted,
and nevertheless the best naturalists remain still in uncertainty
of the real cause of such grand phenomena of nature.</p>
<p>In the physical and meteorological part of my work, I shall
have occasion more particularly to discuss each of these
theories, and I hope I shall easily demonstrate the futility of
each of them, one only excepted. I shall here merely mention a
few of the results of my experiments and long study on this
subject.</p>
<p>1st, That phosphorescence essentially belongs to all waters;
it is observed in the midst of the waves of the Mediterranean, in
the Norwegian seas, those of Siberia, and those of the antarctic
poles.</p>
<p>2dly, The phosphorescence is generally stronger and more
constant between the tropics, or near the tropics, than in
latitudes nearer the poles.</p>
<p>3dly, The temperature, almost continually higher in the
equinoctial seas, seems to be the <i>mediate</i> cause of this
difference.</p>
<p>4thly, The phosphorescence is greater and more constant along
the coasts, in confined seas and straits, than in the middle of
the ocean, and at a distance from land.</p>
<p>5thly, In general this phenomenon is so much the more visible
as the sea is more agitated, and when the darkness of the night
is more profound.</p>
<p>6thly, We may, nevertheless, observe, that when the sea is
calm, and when the moon shines bright and clear, it does not
always eclipse the phosphorescence.</p>
<p>7thly, All the phenomena of the phosphorescence of the waters
of the sea, however multiplied, however singular they may appear,
may be nevertheless deduced from one single principle:&mdash;the
phosphorescence peculiar to marine animals. My numerous
observations, and the beautiful collection of coloured
representations of phosphoric animals, by M. Lesueur, will, I
hope, place this beyond a doubt.</p>
<p>8thly, This active phosphorescence of animals, very different
in every respect from that faint brightness produced in certain
cases by putrid decomposition, is so dependent on the
organization, and of life, that it increases, grows weaker, and
becomes extinct with the latter, so as never to be reproduced
after death.</p>
<p>However various my physical and meteorological observations
may have been, they did not occupy the whole of my time; so many
undisturbed hours may be devoted to study when on a voyage, far
from the noise of cities, and entirely abstracted from all the
duties belonging to family or to friendship, and even from every
connection with so, tidy. The study of marine zoophytes, &amp;c.
particularly engaged my attention in my leisure hours; this bad
been more especially recommended to me by M. Cuvier, whom we may
esteem as the author of this classification of the animal
kingdom, and whose advice and instructions served me as a rule in
my investigations. My colleague, Maug&eacute;, and my friend,
Lesueur, acted in concert with me, and we had the satisfaction of
making discoveries of this kind, both interesting and numerous.
But it shall suffice here to sketch slightly the picture of some
few of these animals, so long neglected by naturalists, and
which, from the strangeness of their form, the singularity of
their organization, the beauty of their colours, and the variety
of their character, so well merit the attention of the natural
philosopher.</p>
<p>At the head of this class of animals I shall place the
Physalis, a kind of zoophyte, which, by means of a membrane or
bladder, similar to that of certain fish, floats always on the
surface of the water. A kind of membraneous muscle in folds or
plaits fixed longitudinally on the back of the airy, vesicle,
furnishes the animal with a real sail, which it can at pleasure
expand or contract, in suitable proportions to the force or
direction of the wind. From this singularity, it has frequently
been named, the frigate, the galley, the schooner, &amp;c. by
these names it is generally known to the seamen of every nation.
This vindictive animal spreads on the surface of the waves its
sinewy snares or nets, several feet in length, and of a pure and
lively ultramarine blue. Woe to the hand which attempts to seize
them the sensation of burning is not quicker than that of the
venom which is concealed in these instruments of, prey. This
sensation is attended with an intolerable smarting in the part
touched by them, with a kind of numbness or stupefaction of the
whole limb, such are the almost instantaneous effects of the
slightest touch of the physalis. Sometimes an appearance on the
skin, similar to that produced by stinging nettles, is the
consequence; this is accompanied by extreme pain, which generally
continues twenty-four or thirty-six hours. What can we think of
the nature of this subtile poison No direct experiment has yet
been made on the subject, and all that I can say from my own
experience, is, that when this animal was plunged in water
strongly acidulated, with any kind of acid, but especially with
the sulphuric, or muriatic, the beautiful blue colour of the
sinewy nets became immediately red, as if the principle of the
colour was really of a vegetable nature. I ought also to add,
that the poison seemed to exert a more particular stupefying
power on those animals which seemed to be the food of the
physalis, for it is impossible otherwise to conceive how an
animal so small, could contain in its nets, and in some sort
devour alive, fish of four or five inches in length, as we had
often opportunity to observe. In devouring its food, the physalis
makes use of a prodigious number of suckers or feelers which
depend from the lower part of the airy vesicle, and which is
surrounded by the venomous snares already described.</p>
<p>Next to the Physalis may be mentioned the Physsophoris, a
gelatinous and soft species of animals, of the most beautiful
colours, which support themselves on the surface of the waves by
means of a vesicle shaped like a very small olive, with a thick
gelatinous coat or skin, the inside of which is generally filled
with air. When the animal would dive into the ocean, immediately
a valve opens, the air with which the vesicle is filled is let
out, the specific weight of the animal increases, and it plunges
into the depths of the waters; when the animal would again rise
to the surface, a new bubble of air seems to swell out, or rather
to be formed instantaneously, the small reservoir is filled
afresh, the valve shuts, the physsophoris again is lessened in
weight, and rises again on the bosom of the waves.</p>
<p>In the Vellelles, the next of the class, the means differ, but
the results are the same. On the hack of the animal, resembles
the form of a little skiff overturned, there rises obliquely a
kind of crest, extremely thin, light, transparent and
cartilaginous; this is a large sail, which serves the animal to
direct its motions, to alter or hasten them; always close-hauled,
this beautiful azure vessel makes its way through the water,
changes its course at pleasure, and rarely fails to catch its
prey, which it holds fast in its numerous nets or snares with
which it is surrounded, and soon devours by the help of the
innumerable suckers which depend from its lower surface. The
elegant shape of this animal, the transparency of the sail, the
beautiful azure blue colour with which it is adorned, all unite
to make it one of the most beautiful species of the class to
which it belongs, and it is very picturesque to observe in calm
weather, thousands of these zoophytes manoeuvring on the surface
of seas, which seem like so many beautiful flotillas in
miniature, directed according to the principles or our naval
tactics.</p>
<p>In the Bero&euml;s, nature seems to have exhausted all that
elegance of shape, richness of colour, and variety of motion, can
present of grace and beauty. Their substance, more transparent
than the purest crystal, is generally of a fine rose colour,
opal, or azure; their form is always more or less spheroidical;
eight or ten longitudinal, sides are disposed in a circumference,
each formed by a prodigious number of small transverse leaves or
folds, excessively thin, and capable of astonishing motion; these
constitute the essential organs of the animal's, movements. It is
with the help of these small oars, moving at pleasure, that the
animal guides itself towards its prey, escapes from its enemies,
whirls about on its own axis (if I may be allowed the
expression); in a word, performs all its necessary evolutions.
What is still more admirable in the motions of the bero&eacute;s,
is, that the light, being separated by the effect of these rapid
and changeful motions, all the longitudinal sides become so many
living prisms, which seem to enclose the animal in eight or ten
animated undulating rainbows, of which language, or even
painting, can give but a very imperfect idea.</p>
<p>How shall I be able to describe the next species of zoophyte,
which like a beautiful garland of azure-coloured crystal, moves
on the surface of the waves, successively raising its transparent
folds, which resemble the leaves of ivy; its beautiful
rose-coloured feelers are stretched oat, seeking the prey on
which the animal feeds, which is no sooner caught than it is
enveloped in a fatal net. This zoophyte immediately contracts
itself, forming a sort of circle around the animal it has
conquered; thousands of suckers, like long leeches, spring at the
same instant from under the leaves which I have just described,
and which in a state of repose serve to cover and protect these
suckers. In few moments the prey, however large, is devoured. I
cannot avoid mentioning the admirable phosphoric property so
general among most of the animals of this class, and which in
that I have now described, is more lively and brilliant than in
others, and causes it to appear in the midst of darkness like a
beautiful garland of flame and phosphorus!</p>
<p>In what terms shall I describe those Janthines of a purple
colour, which move on the surface of the sea, suspended by a
white bunch of airy vesicles! Or what can I say of those numerous
legions of Salpa, of rose-colour, azure, or opal, which form
banks of thirty or forty leagues in extent, and which glitter in
the midst of darkness! Or of those Medus&aelig;, equally
phosphoric; which present so many singular forms in their
organization, so many delicate shades in their colour! Or those
Pyrosom&aelig;, which are formed like the finger of an enormous
glove, and which do not appear to have any of the organs of
locomotion, digestion, respiration, or even reproduction, but
which nevertheless cover the sea with their innumerable swarms.
The substance of these animals is so brilliant, even in the
darkest night, that it has the appearance of red hot iron! Nor
should I omit to speak of the beautiful Glaucus, of a fine
ultramarine blue, with a stripe of silver on the back: these
resemble so many small sea-lizards, their limbs branching out in
ramifications like shrubs, serving at the same time as fins and
lungs: Nor of those Pneumoderm&aelig;, which the celebrated M.
Cuvier (for whom I had intended several of the curious marine
animals) considers as constituting a new order in the class to
which they belong; these have their organs of respiration in the
hind part of the back! The Hyale&aelig;, which abound in the
neighbourhood of the Cape of Good Hope, are also a curious
animal, protected only by a shell, which is extremely thin,
fragile, light; transparent, and of a horny appearance. These are
to be seen playing on the stormy waves of the southern ocean. As
they unfold their beautiful purple fins, they might be taken for
so many little tortoises in miniature, and indeed by this name
they are generally called by the seamen.</p>
<p>Here I may be allowed to mention the discovery of the living
Spirulea, which at length resolves the problem of the formation
of these singular shells with several apartments, and which under
the name of nummulites, belemnites, horns of ammon, hippurite,
lenticular stones, turrilite, &amp;c. &amp;c. bear no
inconsiderable part in the history of the revolutions of our
planet, of which so small a quantity appear to have escaped the
great catastrophes of nature, and of which species not any of the
living animals have been hitherto known to naturalists.</p>
<p>I shall venture to speak of those azure-coloured Porpites, in
the membraneous head of which species, the learned M. Cuvier
thought he had discovered the type of some kinds of nummulites,
with concentric spires, which are found in a state of
petrifaction on the summit of the highest mountains of our
continent. But I must conclude this subject; for to point out
only the new and interesting objects which we collected during
this long from Europe to the Indies, would exceed the bounds
which I have prescribed to myself. It most suffice to add, that
our collection consisted of upwards of eighty new species of
different animals; and that among these is a remarkable fish, not
only for being variegated with brilliant gold and purple, but
also for the pustulous conic vesicles with which its teguments
are bristled, and which compel the animal to float continually on
the surface of the seas.</p>

<p align="center"><i><b>Our Stay in the Isle of
France.</b></i><br>
<br>
<small>[<i>From the</i> 15<i>th of March to the</i> 25<i>th of
April,</i> 1801.]</small></p>
<br>
<p>AFTER so long a voyage, the sight of any portion of land Is
doubtless delightful to the traveller; but how much more does it
appear interesting, when he knows that he shall find on it the
men, manners and language of his native country. Besides, the
picturesque appearance of the Isle of France, the singular shapes
of its mountains, the verdure which clothes the whole surface of
the island, the numerous habitations which he discovers at a
distance, all contribute something to the charm of having reached
the first goal or resting place of his voyage.</p>
<p>The Isle of France was first discovered by the Portuguese, who
named it Cern&eacute;; it was afterwards in the possession of the
Dutch, who called it Isle-Maurice; it now belongs to the French,
who again changed its name to that it is now known by, the Isle
of France. It is a small island in the Indian sea, and is
generally called a part of Africa; it is situated near the
tropics, being only three degrees from that of Capricorn; it is
of an irregular oval form; its greatest length is not above
eleven leagues; it is in breadth hardly eight; the circumference
is reckoned about forty-five, and the surface, according to the
abb&eacute; de Lacaille, is 432,680 toises; it is thirty leagues
N.E. of the Isle Reunion, the soil of which, like that of the
Isle of France, is entirely volcanic, but the mountains are more
lofty; one of them is also a burning volcano. The prevailing
winds at the Isle of France are, the E.S.E. the S.E. and the
S.S.E.; that is to say, the most pleasant and healthy that we can
possibly have in these latitudes. Those which blow from the N.
and the W. and particularly the N.W. are generally rainy and
almost always attend the hurricanes which from time to time lay
waste the colony. But it is said that these hurricanes happen but
seldom since the lands have been so much cleared. The hurricanes
of these latter days, which have been most spoken of, are those
which happened in the years 1786, and 1789. The first took place
on the 15th of December, when the sea rose three feet eight
inches above the level of the highest tides; the barometer sunk
W, 3 lines; and there fell in the course of twenty-four hours, 73
lines of rain water; and independent of the thunder and
lightning, which was almost incessant the whole tithe of this
dreadful hurricane, there appeared a meteor like a globe of fire,
which followed the direction of the wind, which was then N.W. and
went behind the mountains of Mocha. This meteor was very high in
the atmosphere, and appeared, half as large as the moon.</p>
<p>The second hurricane, still more disastrous than the former,
happened at the same time in the month, namely, on the 15th of
December, 1789; it lasted about twenty three hours, during which
time the barometer sunk 14, 9 lines; and the mercury in the tube
was so strongly agitated, that oscillations were considerable,
and there rose from its surfaces sparks of pale light, which
filled all that was empty of the tube. The sea raged horribly,
and the waves were so impetuous, that several ships were driven
on the rocks and wrecked; some were even overset that were at
anchor in the middle of the port. The quarters of Mocha, of
Flacq, of Pamplemousses, and the Riviere du Rempart, were more
particularly devastated by this last hurricane, during which
there fell 104 lines of rain water.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the momentaneous disasters which are the
consequences of these hurricanes, experience seems to prove that
they are a real benefit to the Country; and that this sort of
periodical revolution gives new strength to the soil, and makes
the atmosphere more salubrious. Thus Nature, benevolent in all
her works, makes evil itself one of the most powerful agents in
producing good.</p>
<p>Earthquakes happen but seldom in the Isle of France; but in
the morning, on the fourth of August, 1786, two strong shocks
were felt, which, however, did not do any damage.</p>
<p>As in our own climates, it thunders in the hottest months,
that is to say, it generally happens in October; November,
December, and January. The mean term of nine years' observation
on this subject, gives about fifteen days of thunder in each
month.</p>
<p>Hail is a phenomenon which rarely happens, but, nevertheless,
there are same instances; for example, it hailed in the plains of
Mocha on the 10th of December, 1799.</p>
<p>Rain falls very frequently, and in great abundance. At the
N.W. port, the days of rain amounted in a year, from 105 to 140,
and in the plains of Mocha they were still more numerous. In the
year 7 of the revolution, they were reckoned at 198; in the year
8, 193; which, on an average, makes above half the days of the
year rainy.</p>
<p>This frequent rain, the height of the mountains, the forests
which cover the summits, and the basaltic nature of the soil,
which prevents the earth imbibing much of the water to any great
depth, seem to be considered as the chief causes of the
multiplicity of the rivers, of which there are above forty,
independent of smaller streams, springs, and numerous torrents in
every part of the island; the rivers, indeed, are not very
considerable, but they nevertheless contain an immense quantity
of water, if we suppose them collected together in one mass. This
great number of rivers and streams power, fully assists the
natural fertility of the soil, and that strength of vegetation,
of which we cannot have a perfect idea in mates not so much
favoured by nature.</p>
<p>However abundant the rains may still be in, the Isle of
France, it is the general opinion of the country, that they have
much diminished in the course of the last twenty-five or thirty
years, and the clearing of the lauds, which latterly is
particular, has been done without proper consideration, is
universally thought to be the principal cause of this diminution.
And the oldest and best-informed agriculturists assert; that the
rivers convey much less water than formerly; that several springs
have dried up, and that vegetation is not so quick; and this last
effect is ascribed not so much to the soil being exhausted, as to
the deficiency of its natural humidity. It is certainly not
impossible, that the inconsiderate act of clearing the forests
may have been one great cause of the diminution of the quantity
of rain; but it is also possible, that if the quantity be still
the same as formerly, it may not now be sufficient for the
vegetation, because the first effect of the denudation of the
soil, is to occasion a quicker and greater evaporation. But
whatever weight this last observation may have, it is
nevertheless incontestable, that the clearing of the lands, has
been followed in most parts of the island by the effects above
mentioned. In the environs of the port N.W. there are now scarce
any woods, and M. Cer&eacute; told me, that he had seen in his
youth the whole of the great plain, of Pamplemousses covered with
forests; it is now crowded with habitations.</p>
<p>The temperature of the Isle of France is not so hot as its
latitude seems to denote, for after a course of daily
observations during three years, made with particular attention
to the subject, on the estate of Minissy, belonging to one of the
brothers of the family of Monneron, a name as much respected in
India as in Europe, I found that the maximum of heat was scarcely
22&deg; in the year 7; 21&deg; 81 in the year 8; and 22&deg; in
the year 9; the minimum was from 13&deg; to 14&deg; for each of
these same years. It is generally in the summer as high as from
18 to 20&deg;, and during the winter from 15 to 18&deg;. Thus, in
all this part of the island they are generally in the habit of
lighting fires in winter; the evenings particularly are very
cool, and I have myself felt cold for want, of more covering in
the night.</p>
<p>In the plains of Pamplemousses, the temperature is not hotter
than in the plains of Wilhems and Mocha. M. Cer&eacute;, who for
thirty years carefully observed the variations of the
thermometer, told me that this instrument very seldom rose so
high as 25&deg;; that this scarcely happened once in a year for
five years together; that it was still seldom that it rose to
26&deg;, and that in this case it happened during the time of
very extraordinary heats, violent storms, or even hurricanes.
When exposed to the heat of the sun, several times at twelve
o'clock at noon, his thermometer did not rise higher than
40&deg;. This remarkable circumstance of the little elevation of
the temperature of the Isle of. France, in the interior of the
country, depends, First, on the small size of the island;
Secondly, on its isolated situation in the middle of the seas;
Thirdly, on the nature of the prevailing winds; Fourthly, from
the high mountains which cover part of its surface; Fifthly, from
the forests, which in the interior are yet very extensive;
Sixthly, from the frequent and abundant rains; and Seventhly,
from the multiplicity of the rivers and springs, which usually
occasion a cool air in the valleys.</p>
<p>To the N.W. of the port the temperature is much warmer than in
the rest of the island; in fine, from a long course of
observations on this subject by M. Lislet correspondent of the
Academy of Sciences, it appears that the maximum of heat
experienced in the city of the port, is annually 28&deg; 29, and
even 29&deg; 5. The thermometer however never rises so high as
30&deg;; at least M. Lislet himself never observed it at that
height. The months of December, January, and February, are the
hottest. It is not only from the temperature being warmer, that
the atmosphere of the port N.W. occasions lassitude and fatigue;
it is caused more by the stagnation it sometimes suffers, and
which increases sensibly as The heat of the imprisoned air
becomes greater, land locked as it is on all sides by the
mountains of La Decoveste, Du Pouce, Du Pittes-both, and the long
mountain, a disposition which prevents the immediate action of
the fresh and salutary gales from the and S.S.E. of which I have
spoken.</p>
<p>Except in the time of a hurricane, the barometer, in the N.W.
part of the port remains generally from 27 inches 9 lines, to 28
inches 3 and even 4 lines; but in the more de, voted plains of
Mocha, the barometer rarely ascends above 27 inches, and it is
almost always below this point.</p>
<p>These considerations on the physical situation of the Isle of
France, are not only necessary to be known as Connected with the
meteorology, they also apply particularly to the health of the
inhabitants. It is easy to conceive, that from ail these
observations, the elasticity, freshness, and lightness of the air
in the vicinity of Mocha, the plains of Wilhems, &amp;c. is much
more salutary to persons in an impaired state of health, or to
convalescents, than the close air of the port N.W.; and that for
the same reason, the elastic air of the plains of Wilhems is not
so proper for those individuals who suffer under any stomach
complaint. Experience confirms the justice of these observations.
Notwithstanding this objection, it would be very unjust to think
it a cause of complaint, because it is to these qualities of the
air that the particular salubrity of the Isle of France is to be
ascribed, as well as the climate being free from the dreadful
fevers which are so common in Batavia, the Philippines, the
Moluccas, Madagascar, and most of the countries near the
equator.</p>
<p>We must not, however, believe with some enthusiasts, that all
endemic distempers are unknown in the Isle of France; for
unfortunately there are several, so, much the more to be feared,
as they seem difficult to be avoided. In fact, independent of
stomach complaints, which are here very frequent, and of the
leprosy, which, although formerly unknown in this island, now
prevails among many even of the white population, all the
distempers of the urinary passages affect the inhabitants to an
extraordinary degree: they seem to proceed from the quality of
the water, which, according to the chemical analysis of M.
Delisse, contains a great proportion of carbonate of lime.</p>
<p>I have thus, from my own particular observations, and
according to the general results which I could deduce from those
of Messrs. Cer&eacute;, Monneron, and particularly those of M.
Lislet Geoffroy, hastily given a meteorological sketch of the
Isle of France. The geological and meteorological de, tails which
follow, appear to me to be equally new as inter resting; they are
the observations of our mineralogist, M. Bailly.</p>
<p>"The Isle of France is entirely volcanic; but many centuries
have elapsed since the fires have become extinct; and a great
revolution seems to have changed the original state of this
ancient crater. Indeed all the mountains of this, island surround
if like a girdle of immense ramparts; they have all a declivity
more or less towards the sea-shore, whilst towards the centre of
the island, they each present an irregular mouth or cup, which
cavities are often on the peak or top.</p>
<p>"All these mountains are formed of parallel strata inclined
towards the sea from the centre of the island. These strata
correspond exactly one with another, and wherever you see them
interrupted by valleys or deep fissures, they are again
observable on the other side of the mountains which they form.
From these observations it is incontestably proved, that they
have all the same origin, and that they may be dated from the
same epoch; that, united in fewer ages, they could only have been
since separated by some sudden and violent revolution of
nature.</p>
<p>"Let us consider a moment what this last revolution could have
been. Every fact proves, that in former times the whole island
was but one enormous burning mountain; and that exhausted by the
eruptions, and sunk down by its own weight, it swallowed in its
abyss the greatest part of its own mass, and that of this immense
vault there now remains only the foundations of which the
half-open, broken parts in different places, form the present
mountains of the islands. Some points or peaks of a conic shape,
which rise towards the centre of the country, bear the character
of an origin posterior to the sinking of the crater, and seem to
have been the last spiracles or vents through which the
subterranean fires exhaled their vapours.</p>
<p>"Such, in general, is the physical organization of the Isle of
France. I shall not unnecessarily enlarge on the subject, but I
must take notice of the rocks which compose the soil: they
generally belong to the class described by M. Dolomieu under the
name of argilo-ferruginous lava: these are more or less porous,
almost always porphyritic, with crystals of a green colour in
divers shades.</p>
<p>"These rocks are easily broken, and the earthy particles
driven by the rains, form in the low places of the island, beds
of some thickness, of a sort of clayey, reddish earth, which is
used in the potteries, for water coolers, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>"There is to be found in the pores and cavities of some of the
strata, carbonated and crystallized lime of various shapes and
different sorts. In some low marshy places a species of iron is
found, in grains as large as nuts; in these places mines were
formerly attempted to be worked, but a scarcity of wood, and the
great price of manual labour, soon caused the attempt to be
abandoned.</p>
<p>"To conclude this geological account of the Isle of France, I
ought to add, that it is surrounded on every side by a girdle of
madrepores, which makes the landing very dangerous. These
madrepores become every day more extended; several small islands
are formed therewith, and others are continually forming of the
same elements; while the principal island is also thus enlarging
more and more. We have ourselves seen a remarkable instance of
the rapid increase of the zoophytes. The port admiral's ship was
stranded some time after our departure; and at our return, that
is to say, two years and a half after, the madrepores had
increased in such a manner all over the hull of the ship, that it
had become but one substance with the rock on which it
rested."</p>
<p>The soil of the Isle of France is, as we have noticed,
essentially volcanic; but at the same time very different from
that of Teneriffe: it is almost every where covered with a bed of
earth, which at once absorbs the waters and assists the
vegetation. If I can judge from my own observations on this
subject, it appears to me evident, that the principal source of
this valuable earth is derived from the lava itself, decomposed
by the united powers of time, heat, moisture, vegetation, &amp;c.
I have seen in the compact masses of lava, which form the
mountains of the island, a progressive change, which, from the
hardest basalt by a number of intermediate modifications, became
vegetative earth. The action of a strong fire on this earth
changes it to the colour of deep red ochre, which is doubtless
caused by a stronger oxydation of the iron it contains, which is
almost in a metallic state in the basalt.</p>
<p>But whatever may be the origin of this vegetative earth, it is
nevertheless of a very excellent quality, and where it is of any
considerable depth, vegetation is produced with an extraordinary
degree of vigour; and the number and quantity of plants
cultivated with success in the Isle of France is truly
prodigious; and what is still more remarkable in the midst of
this abundance, is, that almost the whole of the vegetables are
foreign to the soil, and yet all succeed equally well. To have a
just idea of this fertility of the country which is the subject
of these observations, we ought to visit the gardens of the
government in the plains of Pamplemousses; where the respectable
M. Cer&eacute; has skilfully naturalized, in the space of thirty
years, a prodigious number of trees and shrubs, some from the
ardent climates of Africa, others from the humid shores of
Madagascar; some from China and Pegu, and again, others are
natives of the banks of Indus and the Ganges; several are the
produce of the summits of the Ghauts, others flourished
originally in the rich valleys of Cashmere; and in the isles of
the great archipelago of Asia, Java, Sumatra, Ceylon, Bouro, the
Moluccas, and the Philippines: Ta&iuml;ti itself has contributed
to the richness and beauty of this garden. The Canaries, the
Azores, the orchards and groves of Europe, and the forests of
America, are there combined, and we may there also find several
plants of Arabia, Persia, Brazil, of the coast of Guinea,
Cafraria, &amp;c. and we ourselves added to the collection
numerous specimens of the curious vegetables of the south. In
this garden we may ramble: through, long and silent walks,
contemplating these inestimable natives of different shores
assembled together, a subject of pleasing astonishment. Here we
see the giant of the equinoctial forests, they teak, with which
ships are built in India, almost unperishable; the bread-fruit
tree, with the produce of which all the population of the
countries in the southern ocean are; supplied with food; the
rafia of Madagascar, a valuable species of palm, which furnishes
a delicate kind of sago; the nutmeg-tree, which, lately imported
by the respectable M. Poivre, may soon be expected to free us
from the duty we yet pay to the Dutch monopoly; the clove-tree,
whose innumerable and beautiful red fruit so much delight the
eye, and which also already supply our isles with a mach greater
quantity of cloves than is necessary for our own consumption; the
badam-tree, with large leaves of beautiful verdure, and which
bears a small almond of a long shape, and of a finer flavour than
any of our nuts; the ebony-tree, which produces the wood so
valuable for its beautiful polish, and shining black colour; the
Pamplemousse tree, with fruit which is a species of orange, of
the size of a small melon, of the rind of which is made excellent
sweetmeats; the tamarind tree, bearing a fruit well known as
being both pleasant to the taste, and medicinal; the dwarf orange
tree of China, only one foot in height, and the fruit of which is
scarcely so large as is of the coffee-tree, but which, like that
of the coffee, is red. This tree is remarkable for its agreeable
scent, similar to that of the lemon; The hymen&oelig;a, a
beautiful tree, bearing leaves by two and two, opposite to each
other&mdash;the symbol of a happy union; the areka tree, which
produces the areka nut, so much in estimation on account of the
betel, of which these nuts are the principal ingredient; the
carambole, the fruit divided into four projecting quarters,
containing a quantity of lightly acidulated juice; the jacquier,
not unlike the bread-tree, and which bears a very large fruit of
the shape of a long gourd, or pumpkin, and is the valuable food
of the slaves; the litchi, whose tough swelling coat contains a
pleasant scented pulp; the mangoustan, originally from China, in
these regions thought to be the finest fruit in the world; the
coffee-tree, so well known in Europe, whose little berries,
containing two seeds each, are covered with a husk of fine
scarlet; the mango, similar to our pear and which improved by
culture, produces numerous varieties; the banana tree; whose name
alone makes the mouth water of any one acquainted with its
excellence; the cocoa tree, so celebrated in the writings of all
travellers, and which produces such effect in equatorial
landscape; the palmist, or cabbage tree, which only bears once in
its life, the choice fruit which ends the existence of the tree,
and which is used in so many different ways; the velongos of
Madagascar, whose fruit is disposed in large regular branches,
representing an enormous bunch of lobsters; the jambos, whose
ripe fruit is not unlike the damson, but much sweeter in smell
and taste; the jam-malac, of which is formed the most beautiful
hedges; the thorny bamboo, for impenetrable enclosures; the
raven-tsara, the leaves and fruit of which would furnish a very
cheap and agreeable spice; the avocacier, the fruit of which
somewhat resembles our mellow pears, but being more insipid,
requires some addition to make it pleasant to the taste; the
guava tree, which in the midst of woods furnishes a wholesome
refreshment; the cinnamon tree of Cochin China, the bark of which
is not inferior to that of Ceylon; the baobab, or monkey bread,
the famous Adansonia, the grandest and largest kind of tree
known; the vacois, whose branches wantonly descend, and again
take root: the leaves of this tree are collected for many, useful
purposes; the frangipane tree, whose beautiful corollas, white as
alabaster, exhale a sweet and delicate perfume; the cotton tree,
which yields a soft and admirable down, after the maturity of the
seeds which it covers; the valuable tree of the iron-wood, which
is of such rapid growth, and which thrives in the most barren
soil as well as in our southern climates; the attier, whose fruit
contains under a thick hard rind, a delicious pulp, compared by
many travellers to sugared cream; the rose tree of China, which
growing wild in fife middle of the woods and forests, unites its
flowers with those of the jasmine and the beautiful pervench of
Madagascar; the papaw tree, the milky and caustic juice of which
is used as an excellent vermifuge, and whose fruit is seen at the
best tables; the ravinal, or the traveller's tree, so named from
the singular property which it has of producing a large quantify
of very good soft water, when the base of the leaves is pierced:
the jam-rosa, which bears fruit of a fine rose colour, from which
is obtained by fermentation and distillation, a finely scented
alcohol; the cassia tree, which furnishes medicine with one of
its most gentle and innocent purgatives; the date tree, the
caroub tree, the myrobotan, the behen tree, the varnish tree, the
frankincense tree, the tallow tree, the tea tree, the coffee of
Eden, the wax tree of Cochin China, the soap tree, the cubeb
tree, the cacao tree, the tree of Cythera, the milk tree, the
roucon tree, the velvet tree, &amp;c. &amp;c. But such is the
profusion of useful vegetables which industry and activity have
brought together in so small a theatre, that it would much exceed
the limits of this chapter to continue the enumeration; and when
we consider that this prodigious multiplication of interesting
vegetables, is the result of a few years' experience and labour,
we cannot avoid being penetrated with gratitude towards the
authors of such benefits to society, at the head of whom appear
Labourdonnais, the immortal Poivre, Hubert and Cer&eacute;,
Commerson, Du Petit-Thonars, and Martin. The importation of the
cherry immortalized the name of cullus among the Romans, and it
is esteemed among as to the present day. Bow many modern
naturalists have done a hundred times more than Lucullus for the
human species, and nevertheless have lived unfortunate, and have
died unknown, even among their own countrymen!</p>
<p>To conclude this general account which I have sketched, it
remains for me to mention the animals and inhabitants of the Isle
of France, for other climates and other people must be the
subjects of our farther observations: let us therefore finish
what remains to be said of our stay in this island. However the
individuals belonging to our expedition were pleased with the
reception they experienced from the inhabitants of the colony,
our commander had reason to repent having touched at this places
but without entering into the sad details of this part of our
story, it shall suffice to say, that the third ship which was to
have. joined us there, was refused us, and that we could not
procure any of the most necessary provisions; that we lost forty
excellent seamen, who here deserted, and that a great number of
officers, naturalists, and artists belonging to our two ships,
already tired and disgusted with the ill usage they had
experienced from our commander, or justly alarmed for the future,
chose to remain on the island.</p>
<p>It is generally allowed, that the wood of hot climates is
heavier and stronger than those, of more temperate regions. The
experiments of M. Lislet support this opinion; and in fact, it
proved that the European oak, thus compared with 22 kinds of
equatorial wood, is but 17l for the weight, and 19l for the
relative strength. See the following table;</p>

<p>Experiments to decide the relative strength of the woods may
be made several ways: that used by M. Lislet was, choosing the
pieces, as much as possible, of an equal size in every respect,
of each of the sorts of wood which he wished to compare, and then
to fix them by the two extremities on two substantial points of
support&mdash;for example, two notched posts&mdash;and then to
suspend from the middle of each of the pieces of wood, a weight
of sufficient force to break them. The agreement between this
quantity of weight determines that of the strength of the wood,
For example, if to break a piece of timber of the black fir, it
requires a weight equal to 3872, and to produce the same effect
on a similar piece of oak, it only requires a weight equal to
1702, it appears that the strength of resistance of these two
timbers ought to agree, as 3872 with 1702; or more simply, that
the strength of the oak is to that of the black fir as 1 is to
2.22.</p>

<p align="center"><i><b>The Passage from the Isle of France to
New Holland, Leuwin's Land, &amp;c.</b></i><br>
[From Mauritius to Australia; about Cape Nauraliste to Cape
Leeuwin, W.A.]<br>
<br>
<small>[<i>From April</i> 25<i>th to June</i> 19<i>th,</i>
1801.]</small></p>
<br>
<p>ON the 25th of April we took our departure from the Isle of
France, to direct our course towards New Holland. We were
scarcely under sail, when we were informed by our commander, that
from that time we should have but half a pound of new bread once
in ten days; that instead of the allowance of wine, we should
have three-sixteenths of a bottle of bad rum of the Isle of
France, bought at a low price that colony; and that the biscuit
and salt provisions should be our general food. Thus, from the
first day of a voyage which must necessarily be both long and
difficult, we were abridged, all at once of bread, wine, and
fresh meat&mdash;a sad prelude, and chief cause of all the
miseries we in the end experienced.</p>
<p>On the 26th and 27th, we had some squalls and rain; on the
29th, we found ourselves in 25&deg; south latitude, and the
barometer rose from 28<sup><small>i</small></sup>
3<sup><small>l</small></sup> to 28<sup><small>i</small></sup>
4<sup><small>l</small></sup> 5<sup><small>l</small></sup>: all
night of this day we had a small continual rain. From the 30th of
April to the 5th of May, we proceeded as far as the 29th degree
of latitude, and to the 64th degree of east longitude. From the
5th to the 11th, we had constantly dark, moist, and rainy
weather, occasioned by the winds from the N.E., the N., and the
N.N.W., which at length ended with a gale of wind that lasted
three days, and during which the barometer sunk nine lines. The
night of the 9th instant was particularly bad: the sea was high,
with a prodigious mien; the wind blew in impetuous squalls; and
heavy rains succeeded, that continued till the following day at
noon.</p>
<p>From the 11th to the 15th, we continued our course under the
parallel of about 33&deg; of latitude, the barometer being from
28<sup><small>i</small></sup> 4<sup><small>l</small></sup> to
28<sup><small>i</small></sup> 5<sup><small>l</small></sup>, and
the thermometer having successively sunk from the 22d to the 12th
degree. The temperature of the sea, on the surface, was very
little different from that of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>From the 15th to the 20th we made but little way towards the
south, being only on this last day in 35&deg;; but our longitude
was 100&deg; to the east of the meridian of Paris, and
consequently, we were not more than about 150 leagues from the
west point of New Holland, where our commander had determined to
land.</p>
<p>In fact, the length of our passage from Europe to the Indies,
and our stay in the Isle of France, which was certainly longer
than it ought to have been, had lost us part of the favourable
season for our expedition. Our commander feared to be driven
towards Diemen's Land, and therefore resolved to begin his
exploration by reconnoitring the N.W. of New Holland, reserving
for the ensuing spring the voyage to the South. This important
determination gave us much concern, because it was not absolutely
necessary from our actual situation. The season, though advanced,
was not so much so as to prevent us from doubling the South Cape;
and as from this point we should be getting nearer the
equatorial, regions, it appeared to us more prudent to pay
respect to the instructions we had received from government,
which we well knew were the result of the most learned
deliberations and the most extensive knowledge on the subject. We
shall see in the end the consequences produced by this first
deviation from our orders.</p>
<p>From the 21st to the 25th of May, we continued to approach the
western shore of the continent which me had come thus far to
explore. We were, however, still at the distance of more than 100
leagues, but our meteorological instruments already began to shew
the influence of the land we were approaching. During the first
part of our voyage I had observed that the east winds constantly
produced moist weather; that they were almost always attended by
thick fogs and rains, which sometimes fell in torrents. All. the
instruments had varied with the state of the atmosphere By these
same winds the thermometer rose, the hygrometer changed to the
point of saturation, and the mercury sank in the tube; but no
sooner were we sheltered by New Holland, than these winds, which
could only reach us in crossing the whole breadth of this land,
appeared to have an influence totally contrary to that which I
have mentioned; for when these winds prevailed the atmosphere was
pure and serene, the hygrometer indicated a progressive
diminution of humidity, the barometer rose; the thermometer alone
remained at the same temperature, or hotter. Surprised at so
sudden and so entire a change in the action of meteorological
phenomena, I considered all the circumstances, and thought that I
might draw the following singular conclusion&mdash;that the part
of New Holland which we were drawing near, was in general a low
country, with no high mountains, or extensive forests, and with
but little fresh water. It does not belong to my present subject
to enter on the details of the memorial which I then made on the
matter: it is sufficient to say, that our commander, the
astronomer, and all those of my friends to whom I communicated
the work several days before we saw the land, although struck
with the agreement of the consequences with the phenomena,
refused however to admit the conclusion, until experience
compelled everyone to acknowledge the importance of this new
method of applying the meteorological observations to the
physical character of large continents. I shall at a future time
return to this subject, as towards the southern extremity of New
Holland we experienced from the N.W. winds the same phenomena as
those we here experienced from the E. and N.E.</p>
<p>On the 27th at day-break we made New Holland; a blackish
stripe from the north to the south, was the humble profile of
this continent: we endeavoured to near the land; but the winds,
and currents were so contrary, that the remainder of the day was
spent in useless efforts. In the evening we lay to; my colleague,
Maug&eacute;, and myself profited by this circumstance, and threw
out the drag; this instrument, which is more particularly used in
fishing fur coral, is so constructed that it will; bring from the
bottom of the sea to the surface, every thing which it there
finds. We hoped therefore by this means to obtain the first
objects of our southern collection, and we were gratified beyond
our hopes.</p>
<p>Deceived by the charts which had been put in our hands In
Europe, we believed that we should double Cape Leuwin in the
evening of the 28th. This cape forms the most western point of
New Holland; on the north of which the unknown part of Leuwin's
Land, which we were to explore, immediately begins. This
important cape should have been placed, according to these
charts, in 34. 7. 50: south latitude, and, 142.26 east longitude
from the meridian of Paris; but in the course of our labours we
were convinced that in this first discovery of land we were
mistaken with respect to the point which might really to be
considered Cape Leuwin.</p>
<p>On this day, the land which we bad in sight appeared to below,
sterile, sandy, and of a dark colour, mingled with some whitish
specks. Several whales passed very near our ships. About midnight
we again cast the drag, which brought up a collection of
interesting curiosities, which to draw and describe, occupied M.
Lesueur and myself ail the remainder of the night, as similar
descriptions had done the night preceding.</p>
<p>During the whole of the 29th. we sailed along the coast at a
very little distance, which had almost entirely the same
appearance as it had on the preceding days. My estimable friend,
M. Depuch, describes it in the following terms:&mdash;"All the
length of land which we coasted appeared to be low, or at least
very little raised; the inequalities of the shore are gradual,
the coast is in some parts so regular, that a line slightly
undulated would describe a considerable portion of it. Near the
shore are many hills of gentle declivity; these appear blackish
and barren. In many places we observed whitish spots, of more or
less extent; one of which spreads above half a mile from the
shore, up the land and makes it an excellent landmark for the
navigator. In my observation of this point I remarked all the
characters of a sandy soil; a property which seemed to belong to
the whole of this unknown coast. The blackish aspect which is
pretty general, is occasioned by a dark and languishing
vegetation; the parts without any vegetation are of a whitish
colour."</p>
<p>On the morning of the 30th, we doubled a cape, a-head from
which projected is reef where the sea broke with violence, and
which stretched out into the sea above a quarter of a league. We
soon discovered that it formed point of entrance south of a large
bay, which, from the name of our principal corvette, we named
Geography Bay; the cape I have just mentioned, received the name
of Cape Naturalist: it lies in 33&deg; 28' south latitude, and
112&deg; 33' 7" east longitude. Farther out, and almost in the
middle of this bay, is a reef which stretches to a great length,
and is very dangerous; this we called Naturalist Reef. In the
evening, about five o'clock, we cast anchor, towards the entrance
of the bay which we had just discovered. The barometer during the
last five days remained at from 28<sup><small>i</small></sup> 3,
5, to 28<sup><small>i</small></sup> 6, 0; the thermometer varying
from 14 to 17&deg;, and the hygrometer from 78 to 90&deg;. The
atmosphere was perfectly clear and pure, thanks to the cold
drying winds from the south, which prevailed at that time.</p>

<b><small>1. Plans of King George Harbour (left) and Geography
Bay, W.A. (right)</small></b></p>
<p>On the 31st, in the morning, our commander sent the chaloupe,
under the orders of M. Picquet, to discover determinately, the
real situation of Cape Naturalist. M. Boulanger, who was employed
on this occasion, says as follows: "We found this point protected
on every side by large rocks, against which the sea broke with
much violence these breakers extended the length of one part of
the coast in the bay; and some of them even stretched out a good
way into the sea. We endeavoured to find a passage in the Midst
of these breakers, but the attempt was vain, the shore was every
where inaccessible; we were thus compelled to pass the remainder
of the day, all the night, and part of the next day, without
being able to regain the ship, from which the wind had
incessantly driven us, carrying us out to sea."</p>
<p>While our unfortunate companions, overcome with fatigue, and
drenched with the sea-water, were thus contending with the waves,
a second boat under the command of M. H. Freycinet, at length
reached the shore. Messrs. Depuch and Ri&eacute;dl&eacute; were
the only two who had gone in this boat, and were the first
Europeans who had the pleasure of touching three unknown shores.
They could only remain there a few hour's, during which they made
many observations on the physical nature of the soil and the
vegetable productions. We shall have occasion to return to this
subject more particularly another time; it will suffice at
present to say, that M. Depuch found in the bottom of the creek
where we landed, a very fine sort of granite, which formed
numerous regular beds, a disposition of such substances
conjectured by Saussure, but before this time much disputed. This
remarkable phenomenon gave a particular interest to this part of
Geography Bay: we thought it but right to name it after the
Naturalist who first had occasion to observe, and describe it; we
therefore called it Depuch Cove, it is, a small distance E. of
Cape Naturalist.</p>
<p>On the first of June, after having manned our chaloupe, we
prepared to continue our voyage to explore the south coast of
Geography Bay. At noon we met with a large point, which we named
Point Picquet, after one of our most estimable officers. At seven
o'clock we cast anchor towards the farther end of the bay. Until
this time we had not perceived any trace of these melancholy
shores being inhabited, but on this very evening there appeared a
large fire beyond the downs, which convinced us that some of the
human race were the inhabitants of this barren spot.</p>
<p>At this period we experienced the most singular and
extraordinary effects from the looming of the coast. Sometimes
the most level and the lowest parts of the land appeared to us to
be raised above the surface of the waters, and then to be torn to
pieces; sometimes their very summits seemed overturned, and thus
to remain on the waves, and every instant we thought we saw out
at sea long chains of rocks and breakers, which seemed to retire
before us as fast as we approached them. This phenomenon, in
other respects so curious, had its bad consequence, as it
naturally affected the refraction of the atmosphere, to which
astronomical observations in a greater or less degree owe their
correctness: it therefore followed, that all our observations at
the time partook of the deception. These of the evening, for
example, gave us more way to the E. than those of the morning.
This phenomenon of the looming of the land, appeared to me to
depend particularly on the prodigious variations of the
temperature and humidity which at the same time acted on the
state of the atmosphere of these regions, in a manner which I
shall have occasion more particularly to enlarge on
elsewhere.</p>
<p>On the 2d and 3d we continued to explore the bay: on the last
mentioned day we anchored at eight o'clock in the evening, about
two leagues from the land, in 12 fathom water, with a bottom of
fine whitish sand.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 4th I set off in our little boat,
commanded by M. Breton: M. Leschenault, botanist, accompanied us.
As soon as we landed on the beach I ran towards the interior in
search of the natives, with whom I had a strong desire to be
acquainted. In vain I explored the folk rests, following the
print of their footsteps, of which I saw here and there the
recent traces. All my endeavours were useless, and after a three
hours fatiguing walk to no purpose, I returned towards the sea
shore, where I found my companions waiting for me, and rather
alarmed at my absence. We now embarked to return to our ship,
which, however, we could not reach before six o'clock in the
evening; so much were the currents and the calm against us.</p>
<p>Messrs. Bernier, Ri&eacute;dl&eacute;, Depuch, and
Maug&eacute;, had also landed on another part of the coast, and
returned to the ship soon after us. They had been more fortunate
than us, as they had found one of the natives fishing on the sea
shore, very near the spot Where they landed. This native seemed
to them to be an old man; he was bearded, his skin was of a brown
colour, and he was entirely naked, excepting that he had the skin
of a kangaroo over his shoulders, which hang about half way down
his back. The appearance of these Europeans did not seem to give
him any great concern at first, but soon perceiving that they
meant to join him, he gathered together hastily three sagaies
which he had laid on the ground, and then presenting himself
before them with great spirit, he addressed them in a very
animated manner, pointing often to our vessels, and seeming to
desire us to return to them: much surprised at the countenance of
this new Scythian, the warmth of his harangue, and the boldness
of hit gestures, our comrades one and all made a stand, that they
might not interrupt him. When he had finished, M. Depuch advanced
towards this savage, alone and unarmed; calling to him:
<i>ta&iuml;o, ta&iuml;o</i>, a friend, a friend; at the same time
presenting hint a glass necklace, the shine of which appeased to
excite the most lively admiration in the old man, but
nevertheless he shewed the same unwillingness to come any nearer,
and when M. Depuch himself attempted to advance, he retreated,
and disappeared with a degree of swiftness that astonished our
party. While this was passing on one part of the shore, five or
six other savages had approached the chaloupe, which at that time
was only guarded by a single seaman: at the appearance of these
wild people, he hallooed with all his might, to proclaim his
fears to his companions. At their approach the savages set off
full speed, and fled with the same rapidity as the fisher had
done before.</p>
<p>M Ri&eacute;dl&eacute;, in the course of walk made a tolerable
collection of plants, and this tax levied on these shores, here
turned by sowing some wheat, maize, barley, pear-trees;
apple-trees, apricot-trees, peach-trees, olive-trees; and a great
number of different sorts of European palse and culinary
plants&mdash;An interesting exchange, which might always serve as
the basis of a friendly intercourse with different nations, and
which we ourselves practised in divert places where we
landed.</p>
<p>Following the example of our commander, captain Hamelin had
sent some boats to reconnoitre it bay, to the S.S.E. The officer
of one of these boats, M. Heirisson, reported on his return, that
he had discovered the mouth of a river which seemed to go a
considerable way up the land. This intelligence was received with
so much the more pleasure, as we had not been able to find any
appearance of fresh water in Leuwin's land, and we were not
ignorant that those navigators who had been before us on
different parts of the coast N.W. of New Holland, had not been
more fortunate than ourselves. It was therefore determined that
on the morning of the following day, the chaloupe of the
Geographer, under the command of the captain of the Lebas
frigate, and the little boat belonging to the Naturalist, with
captain Hamelin, should reconnoitre this river, and go up it as
far into the interior of the country as was possible. Messrs.
Depuch, Leschenault, Ri&eacute;dl&eacute;, Lesueur, and myself,
were permitted to take part of this expedition, in which our
doctor, M. L'Haridon, chose to join.</p>
<p>As we drew near the shore, our two captains agreed that the
chaloupe drawing too much water for an expedition of this kind,
should be moored under the care of a few men, and that part of
the crew should on foot pursue the banks of the river, while the
little boat should go up as far as it could navigate.</p>
<p>As soon as these preliminaries were settled left my
companions, to pursue the shore; the water was low, and the tide
propitious for me to collect its produce. I hastened to procure a
number of new subjects, among which was a beautiful species of
living Orbulite. It is well known that the orbulites are a small
kind of hard zoophyte, which before the time of M. de la Marck
was confounded with the real nummulites, and that these
extraordinary animals had never been found but in a fossil state.
This discovery is not the only one of its kind which we shall
have occasion to lay before our readers in the course of this
relation. The shores Of New Holland often furnished us with
additional proofs of the great catastrophes of nature.</p>
<p>However, the desire of viewing the inhabitants of these these
regions soon drew me from the banks. I passed the sands, and
found myself stopped by a marsh, the borders of which were every
where covered with Salicorne, and on whose salt waters were
several companies of black swans, sailing with great elegance.
Beyond this water, the supposed river, whose mouth my friends
were in search of, bent its Course. A great number of the marks
of the footsteps of the natives, seemed to declare that several
of them had recently passed that way, and I resolved to seek them
on the opposite side. While I was in search of a favourable place
to cross over, I heard a gun at a little distance and thought I
might find among these hunters some of my adventuring companions;
but Messrs. Levillain and Bailly, to whom I spoke on the subject,
far from being willing to share my enterprise, endeavoured to
dissuade me. I had taken my resolution; I undressed, crossed the
river in their sight, and plunged into the forest, which extended
along the shore on the other side. It was about eleven o'clock,
the sky was serene, and the air pleasant: with these
circumstances in my favour, my ardour increased, and full of the
hope of soon meeting with some of the natives of these shores, I
endeavoured to follow their steps, when a singular discovery
stopped my course for a time.</p>
<p>At a little distance from the place where I landed, I
perceived a valley, which, extending towards the interior, seemed
to describe the course of a small stream; I thought that it was
an indispensable duty to ascertain the truth of this conjecture;
unfortunately I was soon undeceived, and I was going to continue
my way when my attention was attracted by a thicket of large
trees, which by their colour seemed to be very different from
others that were near. They were all white, from the roots upward
to the very extremity of their branches.</p>
<p>Surprised at the appearance, I went hastily towards this
extraordinary kind of scenery, which had strongly excited my
curiosity, but which was considerably increased when I observed
twelve large trees, irregularly intermingled with several others
of a smaller size, forming a half circle, with the extreme points
almost reaching the banks of the river. All these trees were of a
new species of Melaleuca, with a very thick rind or bark, and an
extraordinary degree of moisture on the inside: this bark adheres
so slightly to the wood, that it may be easily stripped of in
long bands from the bottom of the trunk to the very ends of the
branches. It was thus that these trees had been stripped of their
bark, and as the wood underneath was of a shining white, and all
those which were on the exterior of this half circle had been
thus cleared of their rind, it appeared as if they had all been
of the same colour.</p>
<p>In the open part of this half circle of white trees, were
three more semicircles, one within the other, whose concavities
also turned towards the banks of the river. The first of these
was formed by a sort of green bank, about two feet in breadth,
raised only six or eight inches above the ground, and made of a
soft, short, and fine herbage, that grows in great abundance on
the spot; this kind of green seat was scolloped on that side that
faced the river; each of the spaces between two of the scollops
had evidently been the seat of one person, and twenty-seven
scollops seemed to point out the places of twenty-seven
individuals.</p>
<p>In front of this green bank, was a semicircular clear space,
about two feet and a half in breadth; which was covered with a
black sand, found in great abundance on the sea shore, and which
makes a part of the soil of the interior; it appeared to have
been trodden by the feet of those who had sat on the green
bank.</p>
<p>A border of rushes separated this second half circle from the
third; these rushes, which were planted between them in regular
lines, had been out off about six inches above the ground.</p>
<p>The third and last half circle was larger than the others, and
newly covered with the kind of sand which I have already
mentioned, and which is to be found in many places on the shore,
and distinguished at a distance by its shining whiteness. On this
fine smooth sand, had been planted a great number of rushes, all
placed at equal distances one from another, and so distributed as
to form a succession of figures, or rather of regular characters;
all these rushes had been burnt down to the edge of the soil, so
as to present so many black points, made round, which so
separated them from the groundwork of white sand, where they were
planted, that the characters designed by these were distinguished
in the clearest manner.</p>
<p>These figures, however odd and coarsely executed, had,
nevertheless, much of design and originality, which struck me
very forcibly; they represented a number of triangles, lozenges,
and irregular polygons, some parallelograms, very few regular
squares, and not any circles.</p>
<p>The rest of the spot, as far as the river side, was covered
with fine grass; and on the very edge of the water was a large
tree, the venerable patriarch of this wood; its white trunk
inclining towards the waves, spread majestically above them, and
its branches, displayed more horizontally, formed a sort of
verdant terrace. This remarkable tree seemed to have been more
elegantly ornamented than any of the others, for it had not only
been whitened like them, but the trunk and the principal branches
had also been decorated with garlands of verdure.</p>
<p>The river formed the boundary of the landscape, adding to the
beauty of the scene its cool and limpid waves softly lowing
towards the ocean the numerous fish that sported on the surface,
the lively verdure which covered the banks on each side, all
united in this simple but charming landscape, to call forth the
softest emotions of the heart. Oh! with what pleasure I gave
myself up for a few moments to the reflections such a scene
naturally inspired. "This charming place", I repeated to myself,
"is probably dedicated to some public or private mystery. The
worship of the gods may be the particular object. It is from this
river and the marshes adjoining, that the inhabitants of these
shores in a great measure derive the food for their
subsistence.&mdash;A new race of Egyptians, who probably like the
ancient inhabitants of the Nile, have consecrated by their
gratitude the stream which supplies their wants. Perhaps on
particular solemn occasions, they assemble on its shore to pay
the debt of gratitude, and offer up their thanksgivings!"</p>
<p>Recurring again to the singular figures so ingeniously traced
on the sand, I recollected those famous Ruric characters,
formerly used by the nations of the north of Europe, and which,
like these, consisted of a succession of figures roughly
designed, of circles, squares, triangles, &amp;c. which were
nevertheless, by different combinations, capable of transmitting
all the ideas of the people who made use of them; like those
which I had now discovered, they were traced on the earth, on the
barks of trees, and on the rocks; these last alone have reached
posterity and descended to our time: I also recollected those
hieroglyphics with which the Mexicans conveyed their ideas, and
by which they used to write the annals of their history; several
of these consisted only of figures roughly formed, of circles,
squares, parallelograms, &amp;c. I called to mind also those
grotesque designs discovered by captain Phillip, on the rocks and
on the trunks of trees, towards the southern part of the
continent of New Holland; those also, which, at the southern
extremity of Africa, the Bosjesmans are in the habit of engraving
in the depths of the caverns; with those, still more to be
admired, and much more ancient, which are to be found in many
parts of Ceylon, and are the curious monuments of a people who
seem to have no existence in these days; and from these
recollections I drew the conclusion&mdash;that the desire of
communicating our ideas and sensations is general among all
nations, in all climates, and in all ages; and that the valuable
art of writing belongs to a time muck more remote than can now be
traced, either from tradition, or any historical monuments that
may remain to the present day; and I much regretted that I could
not discover in the characters before me, the ideas and
sentiments of the rude race who had formed them.</p>
<p>After having examined this wood with all the attention it
deserved, I turned from the shore and sought the interior of the
forest. The way was plain and easy, as there were but few trees,
and the surface of the earth was generally covered with a short,
fine, light grass, but I could not discover any fresh water. In
some places, where the earth appeared to be moist, I dug into the
soil, and there oozed out some brackish water. This saline
quality of the land seemed to have driven from thence every kind
of animal, at least I did not see any, and the traces of the
kangaroo were but seldom observed on the sand. Even the insects
seemed banished from these shores, with the exception of the
black ant, which was very numerous, and extremely troublesome. Of
these I collected several new species, one of which was
remarkable for its size, and very similar to the Formica Guloso
of Fabricius; but the history of these animals shall be treated
of more at large in another part of this work.</p>
<p>A second remark that I made on this extraordinary soil, is,
that notwithstanding the prodigious variety of trees and shrubs
of which the vegetation chiefly consisted, there was not to be
seen any fruit that seemed at all proper for foods either for men
or animals. We had occasion to make the same remark on all the
rest of the vast continent of New Holland, and this almost
without any exception. Is it not owing to this extraordinary
scarcity of eatable fruit, that we must attribute the
non-existence of animals which are entirely fructivorous, on the
continent which we are now describing? It is certain, that to
this day, no species of the kind have ever been seen there, nor
even the smallest vestige of any such. The monkey, for example,
which in such innumerable legions, covers, almost every other
part of the world, which is seen on so many islands, and as we
shall soon have occasion to mention, is found in such numerous
troops in all the Moluccas, and consequently, very near to New
Holland, does not appear to exist on this vast continent; and
indeed it would be difficult to conceive in what manner animals
of this kind could subsist. We will now return to the interesting
subject of the nature of the soil, with its divers
productions.</p>
<p>However, the chief object of my present excursion seemed to
avoid me as I advanced. The small pathways from the river side
had disappeared; and I could now only discover the mark of a
footstep here and there: no habitation presented itself to my
sight; the most profound silence reigned throughout the interior
of this vast forest, and nothing proclaimed it to be the usual
abode of any of the human, race. But as it were to make me amends
for this disappointment, I every where found burnt trees and
extinguished fires, near some of which I observed a kind of
mattrass, made of that singular sort of bark of Melaleuca which I
have before mentioned, and which seemed to have served as a bed
to some of the natives, either together or singly. In a word,
every thing confirmed me in the opinion, that the savages had not
settled their habitations in this situation, so far in the wood,
but that they resided in preference on the borders of the salt
river, and the adjoining places near the sea, where they could
more easily procure their necessary food, for it was exclusively
in, those parts that any of their huts were to be found, or their
wells or springs of brackish water, to the use of which we
ourselves were very soon reduced.</p>
<p>Determined by these reflections, and the time of the day,
which began to decline, I returned towards the river, which I
reached after walking about an hour and a half: I again stripped
and crossed the stream with the same ease as before; but it was
not so with the marshes on the other side, one of which was so
deep, that at one moment I feared for my life. On reaching the
sea shore I could no longer find our chaloupe. This alarmed me so
much the more, as it was now five o'clock, while the weather,
which had been so fine in the morning, had changed, and a strong
wind from the sea now beat against the shore. I knew that
exploring the river, as it had appeared to be, could not have
taken up much of the time of our geographers and seamen, for I
had proved to a certainty, that this river was nothing more than
a sort of very narrow creek, which went a few leagues into the
interior of the land, the bottom of which was oozy like that of
the neighbouring marshes, and of which the waters had no other
sensible motion than that of the flux and reflux of the sea, with
which it had an immediate connection by the sort of mouth we
mentioned before; moreover, the waters were all as salt as those
of the marshes. From all these circumstances I had reason to
think that my shipmates had concluded their reconnoitring for
that day at an early hour, and I was afraid that I was too late
to embark with the rest. How agreeably then was I surprised to
meet my friend Lesueur, and M. Ronsard, who were also seeking our
chaloupe, which had during our absence unfortunately gone too
near the mouth of the river, and by this bad seamanship, had got
embayed on a lee shore.</p>
<p>Messrs. Lesueur and Ronsard had just had a somewhat
extraordinary interview with a female savage, and M. Lesueur
hastened to tell me the following particulars: Independent of the
small boat belonging to the Naturalist, commanded by captain
Hamelin, in the course of the day there had followed another boat
from the same ship, which, under the command of M. St. Cricq, was
going to return on board, when Messrs. Lesueur and Ronsard went
down to the beach. While they were conversing with the men of the
Naturalist, they discovered at a distance two persons who were
coming towards them along the sandy shore. At first they took
them for some of their own sailors, but were soon convinced that
they were two of the natives. The savages on their part,
believing doubtless that they were among their own countrymen,
continued to advance without any suspicion of the contrary. When
they were near enough to give us the hope of being able to join
them, Messrs. Lesueur, Ronsard, St. Cricq, and some others, ran
precipitately towards them, but with all their speed they could
not prevent one of the two, whom they observed to be a man, from
getting over the sands, running among the brambles, and
disappearing in the middle of the marsh. The other was a woman,
who was very far advanced in a state of pregnancy. Despairing
from her situation of being able to escape from strangers, whom
she saw running full speed, she stopped from the first moment,
and sitting down on her heels and hiding her face with her hands,
she remained as one stupefied and overcome with fear and
astonishment, perfectly without motion, and seemingly insensible
to all that passed around her. This wretched woman was entirely
naked; a small bag, made of the skin of a kangaroo, and tied
round her with a kind of string made of rushes, hung on her back.
Our friends found nothing in this bag but a few bulbs of the
Orchidia, of which the poor inhabitants of these shores appeared
to be extremely fond, but which, unfortunately, are very scarce
and very small, the largest among those we had seen being
scarcely as large as a common nut.</p>
<p>The colour of the skin, the nature of the hair, the proportion
of the body, of this woman, perfectly resembled that of other
savages of New Holland, as we shall have occasion to describe
more at large hereafter. In other respects she was horribly ugly
and disgusting. She was uncommonly lean and scraggy, and her
breasts hung down almost to her thighs. The most extreme
dirtiness added to her natural deformity, and was enough to
disgust the meat depraved among our sailors.</p>
<p>After viewing this miserable child of nature with all the
interest such an object naturally inspired, our friends offered
her numerous presents: they gave her biscuit, some looking
glasses, knives, snuff-boxes, necklaces, &amp;c. and what was of
more value, a hatchet and two handkerchiefs. But she continued
her position on her heels, and indeed the poor creature seemed
totally stupefied, and it was impossible to make her accept of
any of their presents, as when they left her these were left also
on the spot near her.</p>
<p>As we were still but a little distance from the place where
this scene had passed, M. Lesueur conducted me to the spot, but
the woman had disappeared, leaving behind her the most
unequivocal proofs of her great trepidation, and which, as it
appears, is manifested among savages the same manner as among
more civilized people, by the same spontaneous evacuations.
Moreover the frightened creature had not taken with her any of
the presents which had been placed around her, and to which we
now made several additions.</p>
<p>We now, M. Lesueur and myself, again returned towards the
shore, where we hoped to find the chaloupe; the night advanced,
and we had near two leagues to go to rejoin her; we were
therefore obliged to hasten our steps, and notwithstanding this
forced march, I could not avoid feeling extremely cold, as my
clothes were wet. On the way M. Lesueur informed me that he had
seen several huts of the natives, which were all built on the
humid banks of the salt marshes that covered the shore on the
right side of the river; that they were roughly constructed of
slender branches of trees stuck in the ground and fastened
together at the points, somewhat like an arbour, and covered on
the outside with the useful sort of bark which I have before
noticed; that they were each about three feet in height*, about
the same in breadth, and five or six feet in length. In front of
each of these huts were observed the remains of extinguished
fires; and among the ashes some remnants of fishes, of kangaroos,
and some beaks of black swans. M. Lesueur had made a drawing of
these miserable cabins, which he shewed me, and I was of opinion
that it was impossible to find elsewhere more wretched
habitations; I was nevertheless mistaken in this respect; for we
were far from having seen the last stage of ignorance and misery
in these wigwhams, and other particulars of physical and social
existence observable on these shores.</p>
<blockquote>[* This description of the <i>height</i> must
evidently be erroneous; but it is so stated by the
author.&mdash;ED.]</blockquote>

<b><small>2. Native Huts on Peron Peninsula, W.A.</small></b></p>
<p>My companion also informed me, that he had seen several holes
dug in the earth, which were some feet in depth, and which served
as wells for the inhabitants; near these holes were generally
found a sort of small tube, which doubtless served to raise up
the water; these were the pipy parts of a wild and scarce sort of
celery, which is to be found in some places near the bay. M.
Lesueur made use of one of these tubes to taste the water of the
wells, but he found it so brackish, that he thought it impotable;
we shall soon see, however, that we were glad to have such for
our own use.</p>
<p>As we continued our forced march, we perceived a group of our
companions, walking before us at some distance; these were
captain Hamelin, with most part of the crews of the chaloupe and
the small boat belonging to the Naturalist, and also my two
colleagues, Depuch and Leschenault, the doctor, L'Haridon, and
the horticulturist, Ri&eacute;dl&eacute;.</p>
<p>We learnt from these gentlemen, that the chaloupe was so much
embayed on a lee-shore, where the wind set in strongly, that it
was not possible for her to turn to windward with any advantage;
it was therefore resolved to bring her up to the party, while
part of the crew, the officers, and the men belonging to the
Naturalist, walked on foot along the shore. As the chaloupe made
way very slowly, and the wind was very fresh, we thought proper
to get to the downs while we waited for her, and to light a large
fire. Every hand was employed in this work; and in an instant we
had an enormous pile in a blaze. Some of our friends had killed
birds of different kinds, and these were sacrificed to satisfy.
he hunger of the party.</p>
<p>While this frugal repast was preparing, Messrs. Depuch and L.
Freycinet, related to me all the particulars of their incursion,
and their account confirmed me in the opinion I had previously
formed of the river. In fact, they were both convinced that it
was nothing more than an immense marsh which went some leagues
into the interior of the kind: they had had some difficulty, even
in the small boat, in clearings dangerous bar at the mouth of it,
and after going four or five miles up into the interior, they
were compelled to return, as the water was then become too
shallow for them to proceed farther.</p>
<p>This wearisome incursion produced nothing to any purpose,
except a long and extraordinary interview with the savages. M.
Depuch, whose name and exertions are so often mentioned in this
work, having related the particulars at the time, in his words I
shall give this remarkable episode of our adventures in Geography
Bay.</p>
<p>"After attempting in vain to land on the left side of the
river, which we were exploring, captain Hamelin thought proper to
return the same way we had come; and we were going to land on the
right side, opposite the point which we supposed to be a small
island, when shrill and repeated cries made us turn towards the
forest which stretched out from the other shore; we there
perceived several savages, who appeared to look at us with much
curiosity; their cries were directed to us; captain Hamelin
steered towards them, but the shallowness of the water soon
stopped our progress; the natives kept their eyes upon us; and
ran about on the shore in every direction, continuing to scream,
and make a great noise. With the permission of captain Hamelin,
Messrs. Freycinet, Leschenault, L'Haridon, Heirisson, and myself,
jumped into the water, and fording the space that lay between us
and the shore, we soon came to the spot where we had seen the
natives; but they had now gone into the forest. M. Freycinet and
myself without hesitation directed our steps towards the borders
of the wood, which was at this part of the shore about two or
three hundred paces from the beach; our companions followed at
some distance, so as always to keep sight of the spot where we
had landed. We had scarcely reached the edge of the forest, when
we again heard the voices of the natives, who seemed to be
calling to each other; they spoke in haste, and extremely quick,
and I could only distinguish the word, <i>v&eacute;lo&uacute;,
v&eacute;lo&uacute;</i>, which they repeated often. We also
thought we heard the barking of a dog; but soon we seemed to
think that the animal was commanded to be quiet, and the barking
ceased.</p>
<p>"To make these men, understand that we had not any hostile
intentions, we all immediately laid on the places that were most
in their sight, some looking-glasses, knives, and other trifles.
We then retreated, leaving by design some few similar objects
here and there, as we went. But we soon perceived seven or eight
natives, each armed with two sagaies and a club-stick; these were
advancing in a hasty manner to cut off our retreat towards the
river. Fortunately we were in time to prevent the execution of
this man&oelig;uvre; but as we were very near together we united
our forces, and kept our daring adversaries at bay, who were
doubtlessly unacquainted with our formidable weapons: we thus
stopped them at the distance of sixteen or eighteen paces. They
brandished, their sagaies with all their strength, shaking their
clubs at us in a threatening manner, and calling in a terrible
tone of voice, <i>mouy&eacute;! mouy&eacute;!</i> In their
gestures they appeared to invite us to retrace our steps; they
even seemed to point out the way we had come, and that which we
supposed led also to the sea: however, pressed as we were by
these savage people, there was not a moment to lose; it was
necessary either to fire immediately, or to make good our
retreat: we preferred the latter, determined however to answer
the first attempt on us, by a discharge of small shot, and to the
second by a few bullets, giving them thus the advantage of the
first blow, against the superiority of ear arms."</p>
<p>It is here to be observed, that we did not know that these
sagaies, however weak and simple in appearance, were really very
formidable weapons, and our company were very far from even
suspecting the extent of their danger: it is, in fact certain,
that at the distance which they were from the savages, they must
all have been victims to the first discharge of these weapons,
for the attack of which they so generously waited, before they
had intended to fire. The particulars which we shall have
occasion to detail hereafter, on the singular arms of the people
of New Holland, will leave no doubt on this subject.</p>
<p>"Not knowing how the number of the natives who assailed us,
might increase, and convinced that it was easy for another party
of them to surround us and entirely cut off our retreat, we
continued to draw back by degrees, facing the savages the whole
time, and answering their gestures, their menaces, and their
savage howling, by gestures not so violent, but which
nevertheless left no doubt of our perfect security and,
disposition to repel violence by violence. In, this manner we
reached the spot where we had landed, without any accident,
notwithstanding we were opposed with so much animosity.</p>
<p>"However, neither the noise nor the menaces had ceased;
sagaies threatened us nearer and nearer, and the clubs were
brandished at us with more violence than before. We continued,
our retreat through the river in the same order, and with the
same courage. We were in the water almost up to the waist, but we
were certain of the river being fordable in this place. At this
time the savages had come very near; all our guns were in
readiness, and our safety, which had been for some time at
hazard, had put us to the necessity of repelling the attack we
were just on the point of meeting, when we perceived captain
Hamelin, followed by the boat's crew, who having landed on the
other side of the island, were coming in haste to our
assistance.</p>
<p>"At the sight of this powerful reinforcement the savages
halted, and we made use of the moment to join our friends. We
were now together, only separated by the small arm of the sea or
river, which we had just crossed, and which was every where
fordable. Nevertheless our enemies seemed to pay some respect to
this insignificant barrier, but they continued making the same
noise, and calling out as before, <i>mouy&eacute;!
mouy&eacute;!</i> and daring us to return. To all which, we
replied by signs of friendship; shewing them the presents which
we had left for them, and those which we designed for them; and
invited them to come and fetch them, by laying down our arms; but
no means we used seemed to inspire them with any confidence.
However, one of them, who seemed to be the youngest, and
consequently had more temerity, advanced to a third part of the
distance between us and then, taking the attitude of a warrior,
placing one sagaie behind his back with club, and brandishing
another sagaie with all its force and suppleness, looking at us
with much assurance, and at the same time with great contempt,
seemed to provoke us to single combat; the other savages at first
were disturbed at this bold proceeding of their companion, but
soon applauded him with all their voices and actions. At every
pause we cried out to him, <i>ta&iuml;o, ta&iuml;o!</i> a friend,
a friend! He repeated the word to himself, as if to try and guess
at the sense, and then repeated it to his companions, who also
repeated it, at the same time laughing, with all their might. We
again called to them in a few words of French, which they
repeated, looking at each other as if asking the meaning, and
again laughing heartily, they repeated our words with great
exactness; those which they pronounced best, was, <i>oui</i>,
<i>non</i>, <i>viens ici</i>, <i>amis</i>, and many others. Some
one called to them, <i>pourah</i>, (go your way; or let us
alone): the manner in which they received this word of the
Malabar language, seemed to imply that they were not quite so
unacquainted with it as the French; nevertheless they did not
move, and their champion kept his post, and maintained the same
contemptuous and martial air.</p>
<p>"Willing to try the last method of conciliation that was left
us, I advanced as far as the edge of the river, and laid down my
arms at some distance, showing them to this native, who watched
my motions with great attention. After this I approached him,
carrying in each hand the branch of a tree. I proceeded thus
about half the distance between him and myself; and then called;
<i>ta&iuml;o, ta&iuml;o!</i> a word well understood among most of
the inhabitants of the South Sea: and at the same time making all
the signs of friendship that I could devise, or that I thought
might create any confidence, but all was in vain, the savage
retired by little and little before me; and his companions
immediately joined him, menacing us at the same time as before.
On our part, we repeated our invitations, and demonstrations of
friendship: we laid down our arms, and carried green boughs in
our bands, with white handkerchiefs; bat nothing could, overcome
the obstinacy with which the natives repelled every attempt of
ours to become better acquainted with them. We again shewed them
looking-glasses, &amp;c. &amp;c. and making signs that these
things were for them, and that we were going to leave them, which
in fact we did. Curiosity determined two of them to pass the
water, the hero who had defied as, and another who was remarkable
for the redness of his hair and beard: they both advanced with
great precaution, picking up as they went the things which we
hill left for them, particularly a very handsome pocket
handkerchief, which they threw down again, not seeming to care at
all for any of then. It was the savage with red hair who picked
up the looking-glass: surprized at seeing his face, he hastily
turned it on the other side, but finding nothing there, he threw
it on the ground in a pet, appeared more provoked than before;
and menaced us with more passion than ever. Captain Hamelin then
shewed them a red snuff box, which seemed to surprize and
interest them, as appeared from a very loud exclamation. Captain
Hamelin threw it towards him who was the nearest, and we retired
to give him the opportunity of picking it up, which he
immediately did, but he had to no sooner taken it, than the noise
and menacing gestures were renewed with as much frenzy as
ever.</p>
<p>"We were then on the same land as the savages, and all our
attempts to obtain their confidence, had only served to redouble
their audacity, which, so much increased, that it became
absolutely necessary to fly or give fire; reduced to such an
alternative, we hastened to our boat, and all of us got into it
without any attempt of the savages to prevent us. Probably it was
what they wished, and perhaps they were impatient to examine the
rich presents which, we made them.</p>
<p>"The savages we had seen on this occasion, were entirely
naked, excepting a sort of cloak, made of the skin of a dog, or
kangaroo, which covered the shoulders of a few of them; the
others had only the natural parts concealed, and a sort of girdle
round their loins. Several were tallowed; and they all appeared
to us to be of a middling stature. I did not observe any that
were very well shaped, or at all fat. In colour they seemed to me
to be not so black as the Africans; their hair was short, smooth,
straight, and glossy; their beards were long and black, and their
teeth very white."</p>
<p>I have here preserved all the particulars of the account given
by M. Depuch, to enable the reader to judge of the obstinacy of
these people in avoiding, or even repelling strangers. We shall
have occasion elsewhere to recur to this peculiarity of
character, so different from the eager solicitude with which all
the nations of the Pacific Ocean meet and receive Europeans who
visit their shores for the first time, and which may also be
observed in most of the savage hords, when they first see
navigators among them.</p>
<p>M. Depuch had scarcely finished his relation of the
particulars of this extraordinary interview, when we saw one of
the seamen belonging to our chaloupe, who came to tell us the sad
news of her being driven on shore by the waves, and that the men
who had been left with her to guide her, had much ado to save
themselves. From that moment we thought no more of the frugal
supper which was preparing for us; the affliction was general;
but as the imminence of the danger left no time for reflection,
we immediately set off all together, seven or eight persons, with
captain Hamelin, to go to the place where they told us this
misfortune had happened. The night was dark the sky very cloudy,
the wind blew, with much violence, and the sea was very rough
These circumstances added much to the unpleasantness of our
situation. We were not long before we met with captain Hamelin's
little boat, which was coming along shore towards our fire, whose
light had served to direct them. Captain Hamelin ordered them to
go and wait for him opposite this same fire, and to moor off the
shore, that it might be safe from a similar accident to that
which had occasioned the loss of the chaloupe belonging to the
Geographer. We soon came to the place where she was, where we
found our unfortunate seamen, who had been left in charge of her:
they related that the winds blowing very hard and strong on
shore, and the current setting in at the same time, it had not
been possible to keep her off; that they had in vain thrown out
the graplin and veered away the hawser; that a heavy sea, in
passing over the chaloupe, had thrown her on her beam ends, and
that at the same moment another wave had filled her and upset her
on her side; and that all they had been able to do, with much
trouble and danger, was to save a barrel of powder, a small
quantity of biscuit, which had been wetted by the sea water, and
a few pounds of rice; but that all their endeavours to right the
chaloupe, had been totally in vain, and it was to be feared, that
if it could not be done immediately, it would soon be filled with
the sand which every sea threw into her as it passed over.</p>
<p>Captain Hamelin, after examining her situation with,
attention, judged it impossible, without some assistance from on
board, to save this valuable boat; and the state of the waves
made him fear that if some succour did not soon arrive to the
men, who were now compelled to remain on shore, something yet
more deplorable might happen, he therefore thought it proper for
himself to depart immediately, to return on board the Geographer,
explain to the commander the distress of our situation, and to
send directly some prompt and effectual assistance. According to
this resolution, he took the way to his boat, and gave orders to
the rest of the crew to come and join us.</p>
<p>It was ten o'clock at night by the time we were altogether; we
were then about twenty-five men, all eager to save the chaloupe;
but the sea ran so high, and the waves broke with such violence
on the coast, that we were convinced that it was in vain to
attempt it till the next morning. When we had come to this
resolution, we thought only of making a great fire, around which
we all lay down to pass the night, after preparing our arms, and
placing sentinels to prevent any surprise from the savages, whose
howlings were still heard from the interior of the neighbouring
forest.</p>
<p>On the morrow, which was the 6th of June, we were all on foot
very early; we again examined our chaloupe, but it was already
partly filled with sand, and buried under the waves, which broke
over it with a degree of violence, with which it was in vain to
contend. The sea rose more and more; the winds blew with great
force; and during the whole day we could not distinguish any
trace of our two ships, or discover any boat coming to our
assistance.</p>
<p>Moreover it became absolutely necessary to construct some kind
of habitation or shelter, for the preceding night had been so
extremely cold, that not one of us had been able to sleep even
for a moment, notwithstanding our great fatigue. A tent was
formed with the sails of the chaloupe; but unfortunately among
our wants, that of a shelter from the weather was not the most
pressing at the moment; as I before said, nothing could be saved
from the chaloupe but a few biscuits, soaked in the sea water, a
small quantity of rice, three bottles of arrack, and twelve or
fifteen pints of water; such a small stock of provisions would
not furnish a meal for so many persons; it was therefore agreed
that some of us with fusils should go out shooting, while others
with lines and hooks should fish on the banks of the river: our
botanists and our doctor went themselves to seek some vegetable
production of the earth which might serve for food; end some to
examine the wells of the natives, to discover if it was not
possible to find some water that was potable. In the mean time we
each received a very small allowance of biscuit, a little arrack,
and half a glass of water.</p>
<p>These different cares occupied us almost the whole day; but as
if misfortune attended all our endeavours, they were all alike
unsuccessful; our huntsmen only brought, with them one worthless
go&euml;land; our anglers lost their lines, which were all
carried away seemingly by a large kind of voracious fish which
they found in the river, but of which they could not catch one. I
was of the number of those who went to seek water, but we could
not discover any that was drinkable, and we were reduced to the
necessity of filling our vessels with that detestable brackish
sort which I have mentioned before; and glad enough to find even
that, bad as it was, in our present cruel situation. At length
out botanists and doctor brought us a very small quantity of a
bad kind of wild celery which they had found in the woods, and at
the same time told us, that we must not depend on any other
resource than that of a certain kind of salicornia, which grew on
the banks of the marshes, and on the right shore of the river.
This plant is well known to contain a strong proportion of soda
and a very acid juice.</p>
<p>All these discouraging accounts spread sadness among us;
moreover, it became absolutely necessary to eat something; and as
we had no choice of food, we filled a large porridge pot, which
had been saved from the wreck, with the salicorne I have just
mentioned, adding to it a little rice: this was put on the fire
with some of the brackish water which we had brought. Hunger made
us put up with the badness of our provisions, which caused
violent colics and stomach complaints, with which I myself was
attacked in the course of the night.</p>
<p>All this time we received no news from our ships; every eye
was directed towards the beach, in hopes of seeing some boat
coming to our assistance. In vain we looked, for no help
appeared, and the evening surprized as in this cruel state of
anxiety, Oh! how many sorrowful reflections we had time to make
during this long and tedious night. The sea rose higher and
higher, the wind blew hard, and was extremely cold; it was
impossible for us to sleep, and the noise of the waves, which
came as far as the foot of the sand-banks against which we had
rested our tent, would alone have been enough to deprive us of
rest. We were every instant picturing to ourselves our
unfortunate ships compelled to set sail, and abandon us on this
inhospitable shore.</p>
<p>On the 7th our anxieties continued to increase; no news of our
ships, no boat to bring us the succour of which we stood in so
mach need. Captain Lebas now proposed, that chose among is who
felt strong enough to undertake it, should go to the end of the
bay, and get on one of the highest sand-banks, and there light a
great fire, as a signal to the ships of our distressed situation.
Messrs. Depuch, Leschenault, Ri&eacute;dl&eacute;, Lesueur, and
myself, offered to go, preferring leaving the seamen on the
shore, that they might be ready, if occasion served, to raise the
chaloupe. We departed directly to gain the spot agreed upon, but
by the way M. Leschenault found himself so much affected by the
sad effects of the food which we had eaten, that he was unable to
walk, but fell down every instant, sighing deeply, and seeming to
suffer extreme agony. The greatest number of us were not much
better; but necessity impelled us to exert the remains of our
strength, and we at length succeeded in reaching the spot to
which we had been directed.</p>
<p>With what pleasure we perceived our ships; but at the same
time we were much concerned to observe them so distant, for we
could scarcely see the tops of the masts. We lighted a great
fire, and also stuck a long pole in the sand with several of our
handkerchiefs and shirts tied to the top. At length we perceived
one of the vessels setting sail, and steering towards the land;
we soon knew her to be the Geographer, and overjoyed we descended
the bank, to go and proclaim this happy news to our afflicted
companions. But before we had reached the tents the Geographer
had been perceived by them all, the wind setting so strong in
shore, and driving the ship towards us with great rapidity. They
soon fired a few guns, the sound of which echoed in out hearts. A
few moments after we saw the Naturalist following the Geographer;
at length, about four or five o'clock in the evening we observed
our long-boat standing towards us. It was commanded by M. de
Montbazin, an officer of known prudence and courage, who,
unwilling to trust his boat to the violence of the waves which
broke on the beach, kept off the coast. He had the charge of
landing some men, among others the carpenters of the ship, to
discover if it was possible to save the chaloupe; for this
purpose they brought a great quantity of cordage, graplins,
hogsheads, tackle, &amp;c. At the same time M. Montbazin called
to us, that he was ordered by our commander, to take on board the
Naturalist's men, who were on shore. I did not hesitate,
notwithstanding the state of the sea, to lay hold on the rope, by
means of which they had landed the things which have mentioned,
and was drawn on board the boat by the seamen, through the waves,
which covered me every moment, and several times had nearly
carried me away. I comforted myself under this fresh
mortification, with the hope of enjoying some hours rest on board
the ship; which was so much the more necessary to me, from my
having spent the two nights preceding our unfortunate shipwreck,
in describing the interesting subjects of our nocturnal
fishery.</p>
<p>M. Montbazin was extremely glad to see me again; he informed
me, that captain Hamelin, after embarking as we have before
related, with his two officers, Messrs. Freycinet and Heirisson,
to regain his ship, had been hindered by the state of the sea,
and the strength of the winds and currents; that not being able,
in the middle of a dark night, to steer his course aright, he had
lost the ships, and had been forced both himself and his
officers, to row the whole of the night, and encounter great
peril; that during all the next day he had to contend with the
same obstacles; that it was as much as two men could do to bale
the water out of the boat with their hats, as it filled, and that
if was eight o'clock in the evening before they reached the ship,
all of them overpowered by fatigue and famine, not one of them
having either ate, drank, or slept during thirty-six hours, all
which time they been on the open sea; subjected to the severest
labour, and in a miserable skiff always half full of water; it
was not till this time that those on board were informed of the
loss of the chaloupe; they had never ceased firing guns during
the whole of the preceding night; they threw up sky rockets, and
carried lanthorns at the mast head, &amp;c. On the day after the
return of M. Hamelin, at three o'clock in the morning, the
commander sent out the long-boat to our assistance, but it was
compelled to make the Naturalist; the commander then made signal
for this ship to set sail, but perceiving that they could not get
up the anchors, he himself made sail towards the coast; the
anxiety on board, was general, and so much the greater, as the
barometer after our departure, had sunk 5 lines a half, and the
sky threatened an approaching storm.</p>
<p>The waves, in fact, were already so rough that it was very
difficult to make any way against the wind, notwithstanding the
continued exertions of the long-boat's crew; nevertheless we got
on board about ten o'clock at night. I was then in such a state
of debility, and so extremely ill, that my friends scarcely knew
me, so much had I suffered from the want of sleep, fatigue, and
the colic, occasioned by the unwholesome food.</p>
<p>I found our commander in the greatest affliction; at his
request I gave him an account of all the particulars of our
unhappy adventure, and frankly told him that our chaloupe was in
such a situation that it appeared to me to be impossible to get
her off. He was so much the more anxious concerning the
consequences of this event, as it was impossible to be mistaken
in the appearance of a violent storm, which threatened to rage
before the men onshore, of whom them were now a considerable
number, could be brought on board. He therefore ordered M.
Bougainville to be called, whose zeal and courage he well knew,
and commanded him to go on shore at three o'clock the next
morning, with more help, and to bring the people all on board
without fail; in case the chaloupe could not be raised in the
course of the day. The boat of the Naturalist, under the command
of M. Freycinet, jun. had similar orders, and departed at the
same time with our long-boat.</p>
<p>I shall here introduce the account given me by my worthy
friend M. Freycinet, senior, of the dreadful situation of captain
Hamelin and his companions, in the boat, on the night and during
the time they were endeavouring to make the ship.</p>
<p>"Our men were therefore obliged constantly to labour at the
oar. Several times in the day we were obliged to moor, that they
might rest. Their strength was almost exhausted, and they were
faint to an extremity; their dejected appearance, and the livid
colour of their flesh, sufficiently shewed the state of famine
they were in; their persevering exertions only exhausted them
more and more. At one time, they sunk from their seats, overcome
with want and fatigue, perishing with emptiness, and almost
bereft of sense. Their strength no longer assisted their will,
and all our attempts to animate: them, were in vain. At this time
our little boat become the sport of a turbulent sea, was adrift
in the open ocean. Our situation was truly terrific, and although
we had now the sight of our corvette, she was still near three
leagues distant from us. It was necessary to make one last effort
to reach her, or to decide on the alternative of perishing in the
sea. The hope of succeeding did not quite forsake us, so true it
is that hope always assists the unfortunate. We laid hold of the
oars ourselves, assisted by the feeble, endeavours of some of our
men. At sun-set, the wind fell a little, and the sea became
something smoother. We now perceived that we drew nearer the
corvette, which we at length reached in the course of the night,
being all entirely exhausted, and appearing like so many risen
from the dead. Several times we were on the point of giving
ourselves up to the fury of the waves, preferring death itself to
the sufferings occasioned by our uncommon exertions. The weakness
of our boat's crew in consequence, was so extreme, that most of
them never entirely recovered from the effects of their
sufferings; some of them were afflicted with grievous distempers,
and some died of them."</p>
<p>We will now return to our narrative: All the day of the 8th
instant was spent in the greatest anxiety on board our two ships.
The sea continued to rise, the barometer sunk more and more, the
wind increased, the horizon was darkened with heavy clouds, and
our guns were fired every hour to hasten the return of boats. At
length, about ten o'clock at night we had the pleasure of seeing
them both. All our companions were in the same deplorable
situation as myself, and such had been the effects of the food,
and the brackish water which we had used, that we appeared like
so many men just out of our beds after a severe illness; and I
had not doubt but that a very few days living on such food would
have sunk us all into the grave.</p>
<p>Independent of the chaloupe, we were obliged to leave on shore
about thirty fusils, several sabres, and pistols, with a barrel
of gunpowder, a number of cartridges, all the sails of the
chaloupe, the cordage, the casks, the tackle, and other things
which had been brought for the purpose of raising the chaloupe,
besides a small quantity of provisions, and an excellent hunting
dog. But what was most deplorable in this last disaster, was the
loss of one of the best seamen belonging to the Naturalist, whose
name was Vasse, a native of the town of Dieppe. Three times
carried away by the force of the waves at the moment when he was
endeavouring to embark, he disappeared in the midst of them,
without there being any possibility of affording him assistance,
or even being assured of his death: the violence of the waves,
and the darkness of the night being so great at the time. And as
every circumstance united to make his death inevitable, not one
person of the expedition retained the least doubt on the subject,
till the time when a paragraph was published repeatedly in all
the French newspapers, that interested the public in the fate of
the unfortunate Vasse, and awakened some hope in the breasts of
his companions.</p>
<p>It was asserted in this paragraph that having escaped if by
miracle from the fury of the waves, Vasse, after the departure of
the two ships, joined the savages of that part of Leuwin's Land,
adopted their manners, learnt their language, and thus passed two
or three years with them. This paragraph then made him meet with
an American vessel, three or four hundred leagues south of the
part where he had been wrecked; that he had been received on
board this ship, which some time after fell in with an English
cruizer; and it was even added, that he had arrived safe in
England, where, contrary to the law of nations, he was
detained.</p>
<p>However improbable such an adventure might seem to be, Messrs.
Freycinet, Lesueur, and myself; thought that we ought not to
neglect enquiring into the truth of each a public rumour; we
therefore hastened to call the attention of the ministry to an
event, which in every respect, would have been so interesting if
it had been true. Unfortunately, this pleasing delusion was soon
removed by the result of the enquiries made by the orders of the
minister at the head of the naval department of the state; the
whole of the account in the article concerning our unfortunate
companion was entirely fabulous. To preserve the memory of his
misfortune and our sorrow, we named the river or creek which
occasioned us so much misery and such losses, the River Vasse.
But lot us return to the narrative of the continued dangers which
we experienced in this fatal bay.</p>
<p>When our boats had returned, as I have before said, we
endeavoured with all speed to get them on board; there was not a
moment to lose; the pitching and rolling were so violent, that we
had much ado to prevent our long-boat from beating to pieces
against the side of the corvette. At half past ten o'clock we
were under sail. The Naturalist had lost one of her anchors in
the evening, and another at the instant of getting under way. At
half after three in the morning we reached the cape, with all the
reefs of the main topsail taken in. Just at this time the wind
blew in squalls; there fell a small rain, and the thickness of
the fog was such that we could not distinguish any object around
us. It was at this time that we lost company of the Naturalist,
which not going so well to windward as ourselves, could not
double the point of entrance into the bay. We only succeeded by
encountering great danger, and by steering in a perilous
navigation of no more than from 12 to 20 fathom water.</p>
<p>On the 9th the storm continued through the whole day; and the
winds still blew violently, and carried us towards the dangerous
and inhospitable coast which we wished to avoid. In putting about
when it was requisite, we were its imminent danger, every
moment.</p>
<p>On the 10th we saw several large whales, which played about in
the midst of the troubled waves; one of them, which we met with
about ten o'clock in the morning, was fighting with a swordfish,
and the rage of the combatants seemed to increase with that of
the tempest. This same day at noon, we thought during a clear
interval, that we perceived Cape Leuwin, which then bore about
nine miles to the west. The barometer at this time had sunk to
the lowest point, and remained at 27 inches, 7, 5 lines; it
consequently had sunk 10 lines 9 tenths, since the 5th of June,
which agreed very well with the violence of the storm and its
duration. At six o'clock in the evening, a sadden alteration in
the soundings, added to the nature of the rocky bottom on which
we found ourselves, increased our fears; we were running on that
dangerous reef which we had discovered on the 30th of May, and
which we had then named after the Naturalist. We had much
difficulty in avoiding this reef, and, to succeed, we were
obliged, notwithstanding the squalls, to set all our sails at the
risk of losing our masts.</p>
<p>From the 11th to the 16th, this horrible storm continued
without interruption; the sea ran so high, that the water came
over the gangway to leeward; it was almost impossible to keep our
feet on the deck, and several of our seamen and officers, and our
commander himself, had some severe falls.</p>
<p>On the 16th, at noon, we found ourselves in 32&deg; 42' 57"
south latitude, and in 111&deg; 46' 14" east longitude. M.
Maug&eacute; and myself profited by a few minutes calm to throw
our drag once more on these shores, and this attempt procured us
some new marine riches, and particularly a curious kind of
sponge, of a bright purple; out of which a liquor of the same
colour issued on the slightest pressure, and which liquor, when
spread over different substances, entirely resisted the action of
the air, and even that of several kinds of alkali.</p>
<p>On the 17th, in the morning, the sky became clear and pure,
the sea calm, and the winds from the N.N.E. a pleasant breeze. So
many favourable circumstances seemed to promise us an opportunity
for making interesting discoveries; but another chain of breakers
in the first place, and afterwards a storm of wind from this same
N.N.E. again compelled us to bear away from the coast. The part
of the land that we had had in sight, was like all the rest,
fiat, without any particular form, but not quite so barren as
that in Geography Bay: and in a second prospect, we distinguished
a ridge of hills or mountains, higher than any we had seen, but
almost as regularly lengthened as the shore.</p>
<p>The 18th neither brought us back the fine weather, not the
smooth sea, which we so much wanted: our ship labouring
considerably, it was resolved to carry her to the north: at two
o'clock, we perceived the isle Rottnest; we then reckoned
ourselves to be at the distance of 6 or 7 leagues. As this was
the first rendezvous appointed by captain Hamelin, we had always
intended anchoring, either to meet or wait there for news of our
consort, concerning which we were very anxious, as her being so
bad a sailer subjected her the more to the dangers we had
experienced in Geography Bay. How great then was our
consternation and surprize, when at the very time that we first
discovered this island, we heard our commander give orders to
steer our course to the bay of Sea-dogs, in Endracht's Land. From
this time we despaired of ever seeing any more of the Naturalist
during the rest of the voyage, and this presentiment was but too
well fulfilled.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the wind changed from the W. to the W.S.W.
the heavy rains began again; the squalls became violent, and our
masts were often in danger. At eight o'clock in the evening, the
wind having all at once changed to the S.E. the rain fell in
torrents; flashes of lightning succeeded each other without
intermission; and the noise of the thunder added to the horrors
of the darkest night: it appeared impossible to imagine a more
dreadful situation. Nevertheless, a greater and more imminent
danger soon threatened us, and overwhelmed us with new
terrors.</p>
<p>From 25 fathom water, with a sandy bottom, the soundings
diminished so rapidly, that at half past nine we drew no more
than 12 fathom with a rocky bottom. This created a general
consternation; there was not a moment to lose; officers, the
scientific men, and the seamen, all rushed in haste upon deck.
Never were man&oelig;uvres performed with more expedition; never
was the zeal of every individual manifested in a more striking
manner. And indeed it required the united exertions of every
individual to evade the dangers that threatened us during this
dreadful night.</p>
<p>The next day, which was the 19th of June, the sea still
continued to rage and swell exceedingly, and the crew were so
much exhausted by fatigue, that the commander resolved at length
to quit these fatal latitudes, and to bear away towards those
that lay nearer the equinox, and which were consequently warmer
and less liable to storms.</p>
<p>Thus ended our first discovery of Leuwin's Land, on which I
made several observations that are worthy the attention of the
reader; but as we shall have occasion to visit these shores
again; I shall defer the particulars till the time when I may
return to the subject of the great southern continent.<br></p>

<p align="center"><i><b>Endracht's Land, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.</b></i> [From about Onslow to Perth, W.A.]<br>
<br>
<small>[<i>From the</i> 19<i>th of June to the</i> 12<i>th of
July,</i> 1801.]</small></p>
<br>
<p>AFTER having made the island Rottnest, as I have just said, we
bore away to the N.&frac14;N.W. to avoid the Abrolhos of
Houttmans, so unfortunately celebrated front the unhappy
shipwreck of Pelsar, and on the 22d of June, in the morning, we
perceived Endracht's Land. This part of New Holland presents much
the same kind of aspect as Leuwin's Land, that is to say, a
lengthened flat coast, almost level, sandy, barren, with reddish
or grey earth, furrowed in different places in the form of
superficial ravines, almost every where pointed, defended often
by unapproachable reefs; in one word, very well justifying the
epithet of Iron Shore, given it by Boulanger.</p>
<p>The following days we lengthened the coast of the great island
of Dirck-Hartighs, even yet more barren and inhospitable than the
space of which it seemed to form a part: with the same natural
characters, it did not appear less inaccessible, and the surf
broke furiously the length of the coast westward.</p>
<p>Presently after we made the Isle of Dorre, if possible more
wild than that of Dirck-Hartighs; then doubling to the northward
a second sterile island, which, in the general system of the
nomenclature of that part of the country of Endracht, M. L.
Freycinet has called the Isle Bernier. On the 26th of June, is
the evening, we found ourselves at the north entrance of the
great bay of Sea-dogs.</p>
<p>On the 27th, in the morning, we ran in left of the continent,
having on the right the isles Dorre and Bernier: the appearance
of the continent in this part was as barre as that we had seen on
the preceding days. We observed not the least appearance of
mountains, rivers, streams, or even torrents: the shore consisted
of either white or red sand, and had no other verdure than here
and there a few miserable looking shrubs.</p>
<p>To this dismal sterility of the continent and the isles, may
be pleasantly contrasted the productions of the sea, which are
astonishingly numerous and in very great variety. We were every
where surrounded by shoals of Salpa, Doris, Medus&aelig;,
Bero&euml;s, and Porpites; different kinds of testaceous animals,
and zoophytes, of which we have made some mention in the third
chapter, and of which we shall have to speak hereafter. The
amazing number of these animals, their strange and whimsical
forms, the beauty of their colours, the facility of their
motions, and the agility of their evolutions, furnished an
agreeable spectacle to all our ship's crew, and to myself, and my
friends Lesueur and Maug&eacute;; their number and diversity
abided an inexhaustible fund of pleasure, and were the subject of
philosophical enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Among these numerous and harmless animals, were also a great
many venomous reptiles, which gliding lightly on the surface of
the waves, seemed to be eager in the pursuit of a shoal of small
Clupe&aelig;, which fled precipitately towards the open sea.</p>
<p>These sea-snakes or serpents, of which we shall often have
occasion to speak hereafter, are so little known to natural
philosophers even at this day, or even to voyagers themselves,
that it is indispensable for me to enter into some more
particular description of them in this place. All these marine
animals differ from land reptiles by their flattened tails,
somewhat in form of a small oar; by their bodies, which are like
that of an eel, and in the lower parts almost angular; some of
them are entirely of one colour, either grey, or yellow, or
green, or bluish; others are striped in rings of white, red,
green, black, &amp;c.&amp;c. some are varied with large spots,
more or less regularly disposed; others again are beautifully
marked with very small specks all over the body. One species is
particularly remarkable for the colour of the head, which is of a
bright purplish red; this is the sea-serpent with the red head,
mentioned by Dampier, who first discovered it in these latitudes.
Like land reptiles, they are some of them perfectly innocent, and
others appear to be armed with venomous stings. With respect to
their size, we found some that were from 12 to 16 inches in
length, and others from 9 to 12 feet.</p>
<p>They do not invariably live near the shore; we observed
numbers at the distance of three or four hundred miles from any
land; and what is still more astonishing, is, that we never saw
any of them either on the continent or on the islands. From this
observation I do not pretend to assert, that they do not live on
land, but that we never saw any of them; and when animals so
remarkable and so little known, are the subject, the impartial
observer ought not to omit any fact of importance, though at the
same time he may be unable to understand or explain it.</p>
<p>It is in seas in the hottest part of the globe, particularly
in the Indian Ocean, in the Persian Gulf, in the Red Sea, and in
that which washes the shores of the N.W. and N. of New Holland,
that these sea-serpents are exclusively found; at least, such is
the result of my own observations, and of the numerous researches
which I made on the subject in the accounts of other voyagers.
The warm temperature of these seas, the calm weather which
generally reigns, with the multiplicity of animals which
propagate in the waters, and which are the food of the
sea-serpents, seem to me to be principal reasons for their
predilection for the equinoctial seas.</p>
<p>On opening the stomach of several animals of this kind, I
generally found them filled with small fish, and divers
crustaceous sea productions; but they also in their turn become
the prey of numerous sharks, which live in these seas; in fact, I
several times had occasion to observe sea-serpents in the
stomachs of these fish, more or less changed by the action of
digestion.</p>
<p>It was difficult at first to conceive how such nimble animals
could become the food of large fish, whose motions are
comparatively so heavy and slow; but afterwards observing a
greater number of these reptiles, I thought I discovered the real
cause of this phenomenon. These serpents were often to be seen
asleep, floating on the surface of the waves; their sleep is so
profound, that our ship sometimes passing quite close to them,
did not awaken them, neither by the noise of her motion, the
strength of the swell she made, nor by the constant singing-out,
as it is called, of the seamen. It is doubtless in this state of
lethargy that they become a prey to the unwieldy shark, at least
it appears to me to be impossible to account for it any other
way. As to the cause of this deep sleep, it may probably proceed
from the kind of stupor which may also be observed in several
kinds of land reptiles, and is occasioned by fulness and the
operation of digestion.</p>
<p>These sea reptiles swim and plunge with equal facility; many
times when we thought we could catch them with our nets, they
suddenly disappeared, and sinking deep into the water, remained
half an hour or more without appearing again on the surface, or
coming up; except at a very great distance from the spot where we
had seen them plunge.</p>
<p>All these remarkable propensities, all these diversities in
their organization, combine to mark the difference between the
sea-serpents and those of the land; I therefore think they ought
to constitute distinct species: we shall see in another part of
this work, more particular reasons for this classification.</p>
<p>While the general attention was still occupied on so many
different objects, we discovered all at once a vast shoal of
whales, which came towards its with great rapidity. Never had we
seen so extraordinary a spectacle. The amazing number of these
sea monsters, their gigantic size, their quick evolutions, and
their spouting up the water, all appeared to me to be surprizing,
but still less so than to see these mighty Colossi springing
perpendicularly above the waves, and standing, if I may be
allowed the expression, on the extremity of their tails,
spreading their vast fins, and then falling again on the bosom of
the waters, and thus sinking beneath the waves in the midst of
torrents of foam and eddies. Presently a numerous company of
these whales seemed to advance in a line; and we might have said,
that they were contending for superiority in swiftness and
activity; sometimes, on the contrary, some of them crouded into
the rank of the others, and swam together in a sort of calm,
alternately plunging under the waves, and re-appearing op the
surface. And often we saw them two and two playing together, and
seeming mutually pleased, which made us conjecture that it might
be the season of their amours.</p>
<p>The evening wasted fast while we were observing these
stupendous objects; and eight compelled us to let go the anchor,
when every eye was still fixed on the whales sporting on the
ocean.</p>
<p>However formidable these animals may be, from their size and
the strength of their fins and tails, as well as front the
swiftness of their natation, nature has nevertheless given them
some rivals, and the terrible sword-fish abounds on these shores,
to contend with them in perpetual and implacable warfare. This
sword-fish of the South Seas differs particularly from that of
the North, by two long fringes or lashes; which are from 9 to 12
inches in length, and more than proportionable in breadth; these
are placed on the sides of that saw, towards the middle, and
float in an easy manner in the midst of the waters. Like that of
the North, the sword-fish of the South Seas grows sometimes to an
enormous size, and several among those I have seen, appear to be
from 12 to 15 feet in length. In. the chapter on Leuwin's Land, I
have already mentioned a battle between one of these animals and
a whale; and in the bay of Sea-dogs we saw another; it happened
in the course of the night, the sky was clear and the moon shone.
The two adversaries, which were very near our ship, appeared
animated with equal fury. The whale in particular repeatedly
leaped to an astonishing height; spouting up water, almost
without intermission; it seemed much fatigued with the exertions
of the contest. We could not see the issue of the combat, as the
champions insensibly got to a great distance from the ship.</p>
<p>The extraordinary number of whales in the bay of Sea-dogs,
cannot fail at some future day, to be of great importance, from
the consideration of the fishery; which would there be as easy as
lucrative. For the whales in these parts are fearless of man, and
do not know from experience that he is an enemy; they have not
learnt to fly from his presence, or fear his appearance; and such
was their confidence with respect to us, that as we sailed in the
interior of the bay, we, were often in fear that oar boats might
be struck by these enormous animals which came even close to us
at times when they wanted to breathe.</p>
<p>The absolute want of fresh water is unfortunately as general
on all this part of Endracht's Land, as in other parts of the
same continent, and this is probably the only reason why no
settlements are established, the produce of which might be as
considerable as certain. This obstacle, however, is not
insurmountable, and we shall see hereafter, that captain Hamelin,
by distillation of the sea-water, procured with only one alembic,
above forty quarts of fresh water daily, and thus supplied most
part of his crew with water for their daily consumption. It would
belong more particularly to our merchantmen of the Isle of
France, to practise this hitherto untried branch of commerce; and
if the nature of this work did not exclude all particulars
relative to an undertaking of the kind, it would be easy for me
to prove that it would be a speculation both honourable and
lucrative; but let us return to our passage towards the interior
of the bay.</p>
<p>On the 28th of June, we anchored opposite the Isle Bernier, on
which I landed the following day. It is along narrow island,
about 15 miles in length, and 5 or 6 in breadth. Its western
coast is every where exposed to the rage of the winds from the
sea, and is armed with breakers the whole length of the shore,
over which the surf breaks with a frightful noise. At a small
distance from the northern extremity is the little island Koks, a
barren sock, which a long reef seems to unite to the principal
island. All the eastern coast is broken and steep; but the waves
do not break against it with so much violence as on the west;
therefore it is easy enough to land on this side in some of the
small creeks.</p>
<p>The sand of the shore is mingled with a large proportion of
calcareous particles. The substance of the isle itself in its
lower beds, is of a sort of brownish calcareous stone, but
sometimes whitish and sometimes reddish, which lies in horizontal
strata, of a thickness from 7 to 11 inches, and which being all
equal in length, might be very useful as stones already hewn by
nature for building.</p>
<p>The shells encrusted in these solid rocks almost all
univalves: they belong more particularly to that species of
shellfish described by M. de Lamarck, and have some similarity to
the almost motionless species which are found alive at feet of
these rocks. They have doubtless been in this state of
petrifaction for many centuries; for, besides that it is very
difficult to separate them clear from the middle of these strata,
with which they are so immediately connected, they may also be
seen 150 feet above the actual level of the sea. Whatever
regularity there may be in the general formation of these banks,
they are not however all of them homogeneous in their substances;
there is in particular, a remarkable variety in the structure of
these rocks. This consists of a sort of calcareous pebble, which
is incorporated in the sandy earth, which adheres to them so
strongly, that it is scarcely possible to separate the earth from
the pebble, without breaking the latter. These pebbles are of a
globular form, and are composed of a great number of concentric
zones, which are spread round a central nut, of a brownish
sparkling stone. These different stripes are narrow, and display
beautiful shades of colour, from the deepest red to the palest
yellow. The general formation of this pebble gives it therefore
some rough similarity to the globulous granite of the isle of
Corsica; and from its concentric striped divisions, it has also
some resemblance to the Agathes-onyx. It is moreover capable of
taking the finest polish, and therefore might be used to make
many ornamental articles of luxury.</p>
<p>The banks of brownish stones which I mentioned above,
constitute, generally speaking, the entire mass of the country;
but, even on the rocks there is a bed of sand more or less deep,
which sand spreads over the whole surface of the island, rising
towards the sea shore in a sort of girdle of moveable downs, from
60 to 80 feet in height; This sand, of the same nature as that on
the beach, is very calcareous, and of a very fine grain, which
gives the winds the power of easily whirling about these masses,
and thus to change at the sport of these tornadoes, the
appearance of the surface of the island according to their
violence. We shall soon see how nature counteracts this power,
and prevents such revolutions.</p>
<p>The mineralogical account I have thus sketched of the isle
Bernier, is strictly applicable to the isles of Dorre and
Dirck-Hartighs; the account of the animals and vegetable
productions will also apply to each of these islands. Under this
head, its history becomes more general, more interesting, and
well deserves the particular development which I have thought
proper, here to give to each of the subjects of which it
consists. Let us only add to these first considerations, that
there is not to be found any fresh water, nor any signs of
settled humidity. On such a soil it is easy to perceive that the
vegetation must necessarily be languishing and poor; nevertheless
it is not so much so as at first might be thought. For we find
there various kinds of shrubs and small trees, among which is a
sort of fig-tree, the fruit scarcely so large as a nut, and very
insipid; two or three kinds of small Mimosa with beautiful and
sweet smelling blossoms, a small Melaleuca, a few of the
Atriplex, a Rumex, &amp;c. But of all the vegetable productions,
there are three on which it appears to me to be necessary more
particularly to enlarge, as their description is connected with
that of the soil itself.</p>
<p>The first of these three plants is a kind of Spinifex, at
least it was thought to be so by our botanists. It grows in the
most barren places, and displays a sort of moss that, sometimes
spreads over the ground to a considerable extent, and which
describes a thousand agreeable forms, here spreading into long
regular walks; these again presenting a number of little waving
paths, describing at the same time divers figures that are more
or less whimsical, resembling, in a word, the most picturesque
and diversified parterre. This extraordinary plant is composed of
an innumerable quantity of leaves, capillary, radical, sessile,
inflexible, and so thorny, that it is impossible to touch any of
these thickets of verdure, without being immediately pierced with
a number of small darts which remain in the flesh, and cause a
considerable degree of pain. The prodigious thinness of these
leaves, or rather of these thorns, makes them liable to a
decomposition as rapid as absolute; and this plant may be a
principal cause of there being so small a quantity of vegetative
earth in some parts of the island.</p>
<p>The second species of extraordinary plants which thrives on
these shores is a Mimosa, whose stunted knotty trunk scarcely
rises to the height of 2 or 3 feet above the ground, but which
bears a great number of branches from 15 to 100 feet in length,
which spread horizontally a small height above the soil, and
which arc so thick and entangled one among another, that the
small animals which go thither to find shelter, are forced to eat
their way to the middle of this inextricable network of branches,
leaves, and boughs.</p>
<p>While by such extraordinary means the vegetative bed is thus
prepared, while the plants unfold themselves and spread over the
surface of the earth to brave the fury of the winds, and in some
sort to concentrate the rains and dews under their shade, the
moveable downs of sand are also thins confined and kept within an
immense natural netting, of green cordage. These are the
spreading roots of a large kind of Cyperus, whose brittle stalk
rises not more than 2 or 3 feet above the ground, and is
terminated with a globulous bearded ear, about the size of a
man's fist. This species of Opamen or cow-grass, the knowledge of
which is so much the more valuable as it produces a farinaceous
grain, something similar to that of wheat, is also found in many
parts of New Holland; unfortunately most of its flowers are
abortive, and sometimes there are not more than four or five
seeds in each of these large ears. Probably this plant might,
become valuable in a more congenial soil; but without enlarging
on a subject that is so doubtful, we will content ourselves with
the observation, that the acquisition of this kind of grass would
not be without advantage to European countries; and certainly it
would be worth while to take from the sterile shores of New
Holland these natural networks, capable of confining the
devastating sands of the environs of Cadiz and Bourdeaux. The
worthy Ri&eacute;dl&eacute; had entertained this useful design;
bet death selected that estimable industrious man for his first
victim, and many projects equally ingenious died with him.</p>
<p>Whatever may be thought of these particulars on the subject of
the vegetation of the isle Bernier, it must be allowed that it
shews a succession of phenomena that is worthy of Observation.
These thick and capillary plants, which form the vegetative soil,
these singular shrubs spread on the surface of the land like so
many immense parasols, to concentrate their rain water and the
dews; this depression of all the plants, which alone could
encourage their growth, on so moveable a soil; these downs of
sand raised all around the island, as if to protect the weak poor
vegetation from the rage of the winds from the sea; these chains
of strong roots, usefully confining the sands; all these curious
singularities present interest, and possess charms for the
botanist, and might throw light on the science itself; from this
consideration, no country probably is more curious than that
which it our present subject.</p>
<p>These shores are totally uninhabited, nor did we perceive any
trace of a human being having ever been on this island.</p>
<p>One single species of Mammifer&aelig; was all we remarked;
this was the striped Kangaroo (Kangurus faciatus, N.) the
smallest and most beautiful among the species of this
extraordinary kind of animal in New Holland; this species is
characterized more particularly by the conic form of the body, by
the disproportion of the feet, and by the pouch in which the
young ones are carried and suckled.</p>
<p>The species we now describing, as distinguished at first sight
from all those which were hitherto known, by twelve or fifteen
stripes across the back; these are narrow, and of a
reddish-brown, not so regular or straight on the shoulders, where
the appearance of these bands or stripes begin, but becoming more
distinct and browner towards the tail, at which part they
terminate. These bands do not continue on the sides, and there is
not the least appearance of them on the belly; the face and the
feet are yellowish, and the abdomen of a whitish grey; the rest
of the coat is of the same greyish colour as the skin of a hare,
lighter or darker in different individual animals. The ears of
this species are proportionally shorter than those of the other
kinds; the tail also is shorter and weaker, and without hair,
which makes it have a similarity to the tail of a large rat. In
every other respect it resembles all other kangaroos in the conic
form of the body, the disproportion between the fore and hind
feet, the number of fingers, nails, &amp;c. &amp;c. All these
particulars will be noticed more at large in the zoological part
of this work. It is at present sufficient to have mentioned the
chief particularities of this pretty little animal.</p>
<p>The striped kangaroo breeds in great numbers on the three
islands of Bernier, Dorre, and Dirck-Hartighs, but we could not
discover any of them on any part of the continent, or on the
other islands which we successively explored. We shall see
hereafter, that a similar observation may be made on every other
kind of kangaroo; that is to say, that we see each separate
species placed by nature on such or such islands, and on such or
such land, without any individual kind appearing to be any where
beyond the limits peculiar to their species.</p>
<p>Like all other animals whom nature has left unprovided with
the means of attack or defence, these kangaroos are mild and
timid. Like the hare of our climates, the slightest noise alarms
them&mdash;sometimes even the whistling of the wind will put them
to flight. For this reason, it was very difficult to catch them
on the isle Bernier, although they there abound in such great
numbers. In the impenetrable thickets which I have described,
these animals could safely brave the skill and activity of our
sportsmen. If compelled to forsake one of these asylums, they get
out by ways not perceived, and quickly dart, under some other
neighbouring thicket, while it is impossible to imagine how they
so easily disappear out of one and get into the middle of another
of these inextricable bushes; but it was soon discovered that
they had small covered ways through each of these thickets,
which, from divers points of the circumference, meet in the
centre, and thus furnished different ways out, according as they
found themselves invaded from such or such point. From the moment
this discovery was made, their destruction was certain; our
sportsmen collected themselves together, and while some heat the
hushes with long sticks, others were on the watch at the entrance
of each little path, and the animals flying through the usual
places of retreat, thus became the victims of enemies inevitable.
The flesh of this animal much resembles that of a wild rabbit, as
Dampier, remarked before us, but more aromatic, which is probably
occasioned by the peculiar property of the plants it feeds on,
and which are almost all odoriferous. It certainly, was by much
the finest flavoured flesh of the kangaroo that we ever tasted,
and therefore this species would be a valuable acquisition to
European countries.</p>
<p>At the time when we were on these shores, all the full grown
females had each a young one of a tolerable size, which they
carried in their pouch, and endeavoured to save from harm with a
degree of courage that was truly admirable: if they themselves
happened to be wounded, they fled, carrying their young one in
the pouch, and never abandoned, them till they were overpowered
by fatigue, and exhausted, by the loss of blood. When from these
causes they were no longer able to bear their weight, they
stopped, and squatting, on, their hind paws, they, with their
fore feet, helped the young ones to get out of the maternal bag,
and endeavoured by some means to shew them the places of retreat,
where they might have the best chance of saving themselves: they
then continued their flight with as much speed as their exhausted
strength would permit; but if the pursuit was given up, or even
relaxed, they immediately returned, to the thicket, which
protected their nursling, calling them by a sort of grunting
noise, which is peculiar to them, and caressing their young
affectionately, as if to dissipate their fears, and replacing
them in their pouch, sought with their precious burden, some new
thicket, from which the sportsmen might neither drive nor
discover them. The same proofs of sagacity and affection, appear
in a still more affecting manner in the actions of these poor
mothers when mortally wounded: all their cares are directed
towards the preservation of, their nursling; far from
endeavouring to save themselves, they stand still and receive the
blows of the sportsmen, and, their last circles are to save their
young. The history of, animals in general furnish so many
examples of this generous impulse, that we arc sometimes
compelled to acknowledge them as superior to us in parental
affection.</p>
<p>During our stay on the isle Bernier, we caught several of
these young kangaroos, but most of them were too helpless, and
died soon after their captivity. One only lived and became
familiar; this animal was fond of bread, and particularly seemed
to enjoy the sweet water we gave him. This preference appeared so
much the more extraordinary, as none of the islands where these
animals are natives, have any kind of fresh water. This young
kangaroo was killed by accident at Timor: his loss was not so
much regretted as having but one, we could not have any hope of
naturalizing the species in Europe; but this first attempt is
sufficient to prove to a certainty, that this kind may easily be
tamed, and would thrive with a little care; and I repeat, that it
would be a valuable acquisition.</p>
<p>On this wretched island there are very few kinds of animals
except some that are troublesome and hurtful; these we shall
proceed to mention; and first, of the birds, for example, there
are some cormorants, with divers kinds of petrels, go&euml;lands,
sea eagles; &amp;c. which multiply their voracious species on
these barren rocks. Of land-fowl there are only a few
fly-catchers and speckled magpies: but, however, there is a
beautiful species of tom-tit, with a blue ring round the neck,
which deserves particular notice.</p>
<p>The reptiles consist of a kind of Scinque (Scincus Tropisurus,
N.) one of the largest of the species with such a short thick
tail, that at first sight, the animal appears is have two heads;
a beautiful species of Tupinambis (T. Endrachtensis, N.) which is
four or five feet in length, and a Gecko (Gecko Dorreensis, N.)
about four or five inches long. The history of these species,
which are all three new, shall be given in the zoological picture
of New Holland, with all the particulars.</p>
<p>Probably no country in the world abounds with fish so much as
the great bay of Sea-dogs; but near the shores of the isle
Bernier there are but few. It is in the depths of the
neighbouring harbours, that these animals seek their food and
enjoy the calm; we shall return to them at a future time; we will
only add here, that our fishery was almost without success, and
that to our collections of this kind, we only added about six new
species.</p>
<p>In the midst of the crags of the rocky shores of the isle
Bernier, are found many different species of the Polypus, some Of
which grow to an amazing size; I saw several that were not less
than three or four feet in length when the arms were spread
out.</p>
<p>In these latitudes are found many testaceous animals; bet if
we except the muscles and oysters, which abound also the rocks
and breakers, all these shell fish were univalves. In the depths
of the bay, among the mud and sand, are many sorts of beautiful
bivalves; these at a future time we will drag from their quiet
retreats; but not to anticipate the natural order of the facts,
we shall here only slightly notice a few of the most remarkable
shells which we on the shores of the isle Bernier.</p>
<p>Of all the species of muscles yet known, that which I here
discovered, is incontestibly the most beautiful and brilliant it
stripped of its marine clothing, it exhibits all the most lively
colours of the prism, and the brilliancy of precious stones; if I
may be allowed thus to express myself, I have described this
muscle under the name of Mytilus Effulgens. The oyster of these
latitudes, (Ostrea Scyphophilla, N.) also deserves particular
mention; the under shell is a sort of cone, about six or seven
inches long, and more or less regular in form. Fixed an the rock
by the point of this cone and one of the sides, it is covered by
the upper shell, which is very similar to that of our common
oysters, and which serves as an operculum or cover to the kind of
horn which I have described. The oyster does not fill the whole
depth of this remarkable shell, but is confined in the upper part
of the cone, all the lower part of which is occupied by a great
number of small partitions transversely placed; these something
resemble watch-glasses, and are continued to the very extremity,
the point which fixes the shell to the rock. Their concave face
is turned upwards, leaving a space between each, filled with a
sort of gelatinous fluid, the nature of which it would, be
curious to determine. How extraordinary soever this oyster may
seem to be, it is nevertheless a great delicacy, and was thought
delicious by every one of our ship's company.</p>
<p>Among the curious univalves which belong exclusively to this
part of Endracht Land, I ought to mention a beautiful species of
Trochus or Sabot (Trochus Smaragdinus, N.) of the deepest and
most lively green; also a kind of Patelle, which from its size,
named Gigantea; a very beautiful Volute (Voluta Nivosa) covered
with small white spots, which look like so many little flakes of
snow; and particularly a Cone Or Rouleau (Conus Dorreensis, N.)
about an inch and a half in length, of a light orange colour, and
distinguished by a narrow stripe which winds round each of the
turns of the spiral shell, and which when quite fresh is of the
brightest blue. In the interior of the island, is found an
astonishing number of land shells; one of these was a kind of
small Helix, the other belonged to the genus Bulima of M. de
Lamarck.</p>
<p>Crustaceous animals on these shores are not very numerous, but
there are two of genus Portunus, of M. Latreille (Portunus
Pleuracanthus et P. Enchromus, N.) which abound on the rock in
great numbers. Some of these crabs are 4 or 5 inches in breadth;
and the meat being excellent, they might in times of necessity
supply an inexhaustible store of wholesome food.</p>
<p>Of insects on this island there are but few kinds, with the
exception of the ants, of which there are 5 op 6 different
species, and are to be seen in millions on every part of the
land. After the Ants, we should mention the Blattes, or
Kancrelas, which are a kind of worm or moth, such as eat cloth,
&amp;c.; one species of these are large. The Grass-hoppers, the
Crickets, &amp;c. furnished us with some species that were
curious. I should on this subject observe, that the class of the
Orthoperes, which generally abound most in dry barren places,
presents numerous kinds on the continent of New Holland, and each
of these kinds appears to be amazingly multiplied. We shall have
occasion more than once to point out the interesting agreement of
the nature of the soil with its divers productions.</p>
<p>In the midst of the rugged rocks which I have described, are
also several species of Oursins, which are sometimes very
difficult to be separated from the calcareous places in which
they seem to be incrustated. In the same places are also to be
found several kinds of star-fish, of the genus, Ophiura; one of
these (Ophiura Telactes, N.) is distinguished by its long arms,
which are from 8 to 10 inches in length, articulated, fragile,
and standing upright like little thorns. Hid in the fissures of
the rocks, this animal spreads out its long arms, and with much
address seizes and drags the prey to the bottom of its little
cavern. A second species of Ophiura (Ophiura Phosphorea, N.)
shines during the night like a bright star, by means of five
glands or tubercules, placed on its disc.</p>
<p>Among the class of hard zoophytes, besides a few kinds of
Millepora, is a branching Madrepore, 6 or 8 inches in height; the
points of this, when it is quite fresh, are of a very beautiful
rose colour.</p>
<p>From all the observations I have made on the zoology of the
isle Bernier, it results, that of land animals there are but few;
and those of a noxious kind, with the exception only Of the
kangaroo; that, on the contrary, the sea abounds almost beyond
conception, from the whale down to the microscopic polypus. All
the classes of the animal kingdom in this island, present
numerous and interesting families; and where, in another part, of
this work, we shall notice the many productions of the great
gulf, at the entrance of which we will now rest, it will
doubtless be admitted, that few parts of the setts are richer
than those which wash the shores of New Holland.</p>
<p>All these observations, with the collections which I have here
described, are the fruits of many labours, and many dangers,
which twice had nearly cost me my life. I have mentioned that on
the 29th of June, in the morning, I landed on the isle Bernier,
with the commander and several of my friends. While they were
occupied on the sea-shore, I went alone towards the interior of
the island, to pursue my researches for the divers productions,
and on the nature of the soil. Impelled by my zeal, and the
pleasure I had in the important discoveries which I was making,
if I may be allowed the expression, at every step, I lengthened
my course almost as far as the southern point of the island. The
sun already began to sink beneath the horizon, when I perceived
the necessity of returning to the spot where our long-boat was
moored. Unfortunately night comes hastily upon us in these
latitudes, and to add to the misfortune, I missed my way among
the downs and brambles. Although I was loaded with different
subjects, which I had collected, I walked at a great pace till
about eight o'clock in the evening; but instead of finding myself
at the eastern point, where I had set out, I discovered by the
dashing and force of the waves that I was on the western shore. I
felt myself exhausted by fatigue, and fell to the earth
overpowered by weariness and emptiness, not having either eaten
or drunk since the morning, end having walked the whole of the
day. The extremity to which I was reduced, for an instant
re-animated my courage and strength; I rose and continued my
course to the east, by crossing the north point, and again
pursued my way until eleven o'clock at night; when entirely
overcome by fatigue, and perspiring at every pore, I again sunk
on the ground, and, totally unable to proceed, I resolved to pass
the rest of the night on the spot, even though I might perish in
the midst of this frightful desert. I soon fell into a sound
sleep, and did not awake till three o'clock in the morning, when
I was almost frozen with cold; the air was extremely sharp, and
though it was as much as I could do to raise my benumbed limbs
from the earth, I determined to continue my way.</p>
<p>The twilight began to appear, when I heard the report Of a gun
at a distance. This filled my heart with emotion and joy, and
renewed my hopes and my courage; and about six o'clock in the
morning, I found myself among my friends. I then learnt, that
finding I did not return in the evening, and expecting that I had
lost my way, they had requested the commander to let same of them
remain on shore to wait for me; and that M. Picquet, the ship's
lieutenant, had been ordered to stay on the land till the rising
of the moon, which would be about ten or eleven o'clock at night,
and then they were to repair on board, whether I had returned or
not; that, notwithstanding these orders, M. Picquet could not
resolve to abandon me; but had caused great fires to be lighted
in every direction, to shew me my way, and that, as soon as the
day broke, himself at the head of his men, bad set off to seek
me, all determined not to quit the island till they had lost all
hopes of ever seeing me again.</p>
<p>These particulars made me sensible, how much I was indebted to
the generous zeal and affection of my shipmates; and the
contrivances which their foresight had suggested, deserved my
most grateful acknowledgments.</p>
<p>The Naturalist did not appear, and our commander resolved to
go farther into the bay of Sea-dogs to seek or to wait for her.
Therefore, on the 30th of June, in the morning, we set sail for
that purpose. During the whole day we made but little way,
sailing all the while in the midst of great shoals of fish, of
which we caught a considerable number, though we were under sail;
all the different kinds were new to us, and be. longed to the
classes Labrus, Balistes, Cortes, Ostracions, Chetodons, &amp;c.
All the evening of this same day, we were in sight of an amazing
number of whales, many of them came very nigh our ship. We also
saw several sea-serpents that were five or six feet long.</p>
<p>On the 2d of July, in the evening, we cast anchor in Dampier's
Bay, which is situated north of a land, which we, like former
navigators, took for an island; but which M. L. Freycinet has
since discovered to be a large peninsula, as we shall have
occasion to mention in another place. We had scarcely time to
moor, before the sky was overcast with heavy clouds; and on the
next day, which was the third of July, we were attacked by such a
violent squall, that we were, obliged hastily to set sail and go
to the north, from whence we had come but the evening before.
From this hurricane we experienced great danger during the whole
of the night, because in avoiding the islands on the west, we
were thrown do the numerous shoals on the eastern coast, in the
midst of which we were obliged to turn to windward till the
morning: and if we had missed stays in going about, we must
infallibly have been lost on the point of the high land, which
forms Cape North in the Bay of Dampier.</p>
<p>Fortunately this hurricane was as short as it was violent, and
on the morrow, which was the 4th of July, we again anchored
opposite the isle Bernier, where our commander resolved to wait
for the Naturalist, which we now expected every day. According to
this determination we pitched, two tents on the other side of the
downs, one for the naturalists and astronomers, and the other for
the commander himself.</p>
<p>On the 6th at day-break, I set off to visit the eastern shore
of the island, which being more sheltered from the fury of the
winds, seemed to promise some numerous and important additions to
our collections. In this respect I was not deceived; but, as if
the isle Bernier was to be fatal to me, I nearly escaped being
buried there under the waves. After having walked about, on
different parts of the shore, without finding any of the
beautiful species of trochus, patelles, cones, and volutes, which
I formerly mentioned, except a few that were dead and shrunk, I
resolved to go beyond a dangerous reef which projected some
distance out into the sea, and in the clefts of which, I hoped to
find some of these shells that were alive. In truth, there were
great numbers, but while was busily engaged in carefully
detaching them from the rock, a strong surge broke with such
force over the top of the breaks, that I was driven against the
neighbouring rocks, and over these frightful reefs; all my
clothes were in a moment torn to pieces, and I was in an instant
covered with wounds and weltering in blood: I recovered myself;
however, and exerting all my strength to escape from the surge,
which, as it retreated, would have carried me back against the
reefs, I clung to the point of a rock, and thus succeeded in
avoiding this last misfortune, which doubtless would have been my
destruction. Having thus got clear of the waves, I with great
difficulty reached the shore, where I sank fainting, with pain
and loss of blood. In this condition I remained till might, not
having strength to walk, or to attempt to reach our tenth. My
right knee in particular was much torn and very painful, which
made it at first impossible to walk; but insensibly the pain
became more supportable; I again took courage: a great fire on
the summit of a sand-bank directed my footsteps, and about
midnight I was once more among my companions.</p>
<p>On seeing me thus covered with wounds and contusions, and
weltering in blood, several of my friends even shed tears, and
the commander himself seemed touched with my deplorable
situation. I was soon attacked by a fever, which at first was
very violent, but most of my wounds, being but slight, I soon
recovered, and if not quite able to continue my researches, I was
at least well enough to make a suite or observations, and curious
experiments be the temperature compared with the atmosphere and
the interior of the soil, at different hours of the day and
night: the results will be produced with more interest, at the
time when we shall speak or the natives of Endracht Land and
their curious habitations.</p>
<p>In the mean time our labours had drawn to a conclusion; our
astronomers had from numerous observations, determined the
situation of the island un which we were encamped. Messrs.
Boulanger and Maurouard, in a long and troublesome voyage, had
reconnoitred all the eastern coast; all the productions of the
soil had been collected by my colleagues and myself. Nothing,
therefore, now detained us on these shores, but the expectation
of being joined by the Naturalist, and she did not appear: at
length it was decided that it was in gain to wait longer, and on
the 12th of July, we set sail to the north, to reconnoitre
Endracht Land.</p>
<p>On the same day we doubled a large cape, which forms the N.E.
point of the great bay of Sea-dogs, and which appeared like a
great bastion; we called it Cape Cuvier, in honour of the learned
naturalist of that name.</p>
<p>From the 14th to the 15th of July, we for the fourth time
passed the tropic of Capricorn: the thermometer remained, at from
15 to 18&deg;, and the barometer at from
28<sup><small>i</small></sup> 1<sup><small>l</small></sup> to
28<sup><small>i</small></sup> 3<sup><small>l</small></sup>. The
part of the land which we now lengthened, was like the rest of
these shores, naked, barren, low, level, sandy, and of a whitish
colour. The 15th at noon, we thought ourselves to be about
22&deg; 17' south, 110&deg; 46' east longitude.</p>
<p>From the 18th to the 22d, we were in sight of King William's
river, which does not on any account deserve the consequence one
might be tempted to attach to it from the old charts of this part
of New Holland. The mouth of it is narrow, and barred by reefs,
impeded by rocks, and from the direction it seemed to take, made
me think that it was only a sort of canal, like all the other
supposed rivers of this continent, through which the waters of
the sea penetrated more or less into the interior of the lands.
Besides, we did not observe any change in the colour of the
waves; at its mouth we experienced no sort of current as we lay
off thin canal or river, and the continent shewed us the same
appearance of sterility and monotony, which I have so often been
obliged to present to the reader.</p>
<p>The environs of the cape N.W. of New Holland, of which we had
a sight on the 22d of July, bore the same barren aspect: this we
named Murat. A-head of this cape projects a long reef, against
which the sea broke with great force. To the north, and, as we
may say, on the same line are seven sandy islands, low and
barren, which were called the isles of Rivoli, in remembrance of
the celebrated battle of that name. These isles are but small,
the largest being not more than three leagues in length; but they
are easily reconnoitred by navigators, and their situation a-head
of the great cape Murat, gives them a more particular degree of
importance.</p>
<p>Immediately beyond this cape and these isles, the Land of De
Witt begins. Our labours and dangers on this new theatre will
following the subject of the following chapter.</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<p align="center"><i><b>Land of De Witt.</b></i> [From about Port
Hedland to Barrow Island, W.A.]<br>
<br>
<small>[<i>From the</i> 23<i>d of July to the</i> 16<i>th of
August,</i> 1801.]</small></p>
<br>
<p>ALL that part of New Holland, which from the cape N.W. extends
as far as the cape N. of this vast continent, is comprised
generally under the name of the Land of de Witt, including also
about 10&deg; of latitude by 15&deg; of longitude; it was first
discovered, according to general opinion, by William de Witt, a
Dutch navigator, who gave it his name; but the precise time is
not generally ascertained: some make it as far back as the year
1616; others bring it to the year. 1623, or even to 1628. This
last date is also said to have been the time when the shipwreck
of Vianen happened on this coast. In 1699, Dampier appeared on
these shores; but repelled by the same obstacles that so soon
multiplied around us, he was compelled to quit them. At length,
in the year 1705, three Dutch ships were sent from Timor to
reconnoitre the Land of de Witt, and Diemen's Land, to the north;
but the account of this last voyage never having been published,
all the particulars are yet unknown. It appears only, that it is
to this enterprise that we are indebted for the very imperfect
accounts from which this pare of Nevi Holland is pointed out in
the charts. From this epoch, a century had passed away since any
European vessel had appeared in these seas, and we shall soon be
able to judges that it was not without reason, that voyagers had
so long abandoned so dangerous a navigation.</p>
<p>On the 23d of July, we passed in sight of a low barters
island, about three leagues in length, which was called isle
L'Hermite, froth the brave sea officer of that name.</p>
<p>From the 23d to the 25th there was but little wind, and
sometime dead calms, which prevented us making muck way, and the
currents drove us so far from the lands, that we no longer, had
them in sight. The temperature of the sea on the surface, was at
that time at 20&deg; of Reaumur, and numerous animals multiplied
beneath the waves. For independent of a prodigious number of
Medus&aelig;, Salpas, Porpites, &amp;c. we were surrounded by
fish of many different kinds, particularly Balistes, Chetodons,
Clupe&aelig;, &amp;c. which we may place at the head of
equatorial fish. Our ship was every instant surrounded by large
sharks, and whales and tortoises were seen in great numbers: we
also observed two new species of sea-serpents, one of which was
from 8 to 10 feet long, of a green colour spotted with red and
brown: the other was only from 3 to 4 feet in length, of a darker
green, and distinguished by large spots of yellow and black on
the back.</p>
<p>On the 27th, we were in sight of a small cluster of islands,
which were named Forestier's Archipelago, in honour of the
minister at the head of the first division of the naval
department of the administration. These isles, which we have
since reconnoitred in a more particular manner, are a small
distance from Rosemary island, and the archipelago of Dampier. We
reckoned six principal ones, neither of which were more than 3 or
4 leagues in length; they were generally low and barren, like
those of Rivoli; but one of them which we called Depuch Island,
and which lies in 20&deg; 35' 30" latitude, and in 115&deg; 12'
50" longitude, appeared to be deserving of being noticed in a
more particular manner; out commander, consequently sent M.
Ronsard with the long-boat, but though permission was earnestly
entreated, none of the naturalists were permitted to go on
shore.</p>
<p>M. Ronsard returned on board the next day about tea o'clock he
reported that the island Depuch was not above 4 or 5 miles in
length; that the landing was easy for a boat; and that, from
several marks of the tide on the rocks, the maximum of their
variations seemed to be about 25 feet, &amp;c.</p>
<p>From the aspect alone of this island, it was easy to perceive
that it was of a different nature from all those we had already
seen; the lands were higher, and the shape of these highlands
more decided: as we approached nearer, the difference was still
more to be observed. Instead of that length of level coast,
without any eminence or elevation on this island, we saw pointed
rocks, standing alone, which resembling so many needles, seemed
darting out of the surface of the land. This island was entirely
volcanic; prisms of basalt, generally with five sides, and heaped
one on another, laying most on their angles, constituted the
entire mass of the soil. In one place, standing upright like
walls of hewn stone; in other places, might be seen a sort of
basaltic pavement, similar to those of the famous Giant's
Causeway. In some places are to be seen excavations more or less
deep, where the waters from the adjoining parts collect together,
and thus form so many natural cisterns, in each of which our
people found a small quantity of excellent ferruginous water. In
these humid parts, vegetation was more active; we might here see
many beautiful shrubs, and some larger trees, making very
pleasant little groves; the rest of the island being of a
different character, presented a coup d'&oelig;il as different.
Among these confused heaps of lava there is an absolute
sterility; and the black colour of the volcanic rocks add to the
melancholy aspect and monotony of this little island. Walking is
here very uncomfortable, on account of the basaltic prisms, which
laying horizontally on the ground, present their sharp projecting
angles upwards. "The colour of this basalt", according to the
account of my esteemed friend Depuch, who had several specimens
in his possession, "is of a bluish grey; its contexture is very
compact, the grain fine, and apparently petro-siliceous, or of a
transparent yellow; little brilliant and irregular waves are
dispersed through the whole mass; it makes no effervescence with
acids, and does not sensibly affect the magnetic needle; its
exterior part experienced something of an alteration produced by
the ferruginous particles. This decomposition does not extend
ordinarily to any great depth."</p>

<br>
<b><small>3. Plan of Depuch and Ronsard Island,
W.A.</small></b></p>
<p>M. Ronsard supposed, from the general conformation and colour
of part of the neighbouring continent, that it was of a similar
nature, and also volcanic. This would certainly have been so much
the more important to ascertain, as, till that time we, had seen
nothing of the kind on the shores of New Holland, and we have not
since found any production of the sort; but our commander paying
little attention to a phenomenon which, however, belongs
essentially to the geography of New Holland, gave orders for us
to continue our course.</p>
<p>Depuch Island is the most western of those which constitute
the archipelago of Forestier, and is also one of the smallest;
but its volcanic nature gives it a more particular degree of
importance. It is not constantly inhabited: but it seems that the
savages of the main land sometimes pass over, for M. Ronsard
found some remains of fires that had formerly been made on the
ground, and some pieces of basalt newly broken, which must have
been done by some human effort. Only one quadruped was, seen,
which seemed to be a dog, a conjecture so much the more probable,
as this animal is frequently found in every part of the
neighbouring continent. One of the seamen also thought he saw a
small kangaroo. The birds consist of only a few kinds of
fly-catchers and water-fowls: we also saw a grey serpent, about
five feet in length, of the <i>Boa</i> kind. There were numerous
kinds of ants, grasshoppers, crickets, and particularly a small
species of flies, which from their great numbers were very
troublesome to our people. Among the shells we must mention a
beautiful species of Pyrule (Pyrula Eospila, N.), which is
elegantly adorned with small blue spots.</p>
<p>Behind Forestier's archipelago, the continental lands seemed
to form a great bay, which we also named Forestier's Bay.</p>
<p>On the 28th of July, about five o'clock in the evening we
discovered a large shallow, which we had some difficulty in
avoiding; the sea broke over it with much force, and the
soundings had decreased so rapidly as we approached, that in a
few moments we drew less than eight fathom water: we named this
shallow after the Geographer.</p>
<p>On the same day we had sight of land at different points:
these lands appeared less elevated than those we had seen on the
preceding days; and although we were sailing in only ten fathom
water, we could scarcely perceive them from the deck of the ship.
We, nevertheless, distinguished here and there some large columns
of smoke, which, convinced us that these melancholy shores were
inhabited.</p>
<p>On the 30th, in about 19&deg; 33' S. and about 116&deg; 31'
45" we discovered a low sandy island, which we named the Isle
Bedout, in honour of the brave officer of that name, who
sustained on board the Tyger one of the most glorious combats
which the French navy can boast.</p>
<p>On the 31st we again had sight of land, which we were soon
obliged to abandon on account of the shallows, which were
perfectly similar to those on the preceding evening, and were
only distinguished above the waves by a bluish line: we also saw
here some columns of smoke.</p>
<p>On the 1st of August we met with a violent storm, during which
I had an opportunity of observing some Medus&aelig; of an amazing
size, most of them being near two feet in diameter, and weighing
fifty or sixty pounds. Several species of the same kind furnished
us some valuable observations for the history of the
phosphorescence of the sea.</p>
<p>At that time we found ourselves in eighteen degrees south
latitude and consequently near the equator; and notwithstanding
the temperature in these latitudes was scarcely from 14&deg; to
17&deg; Reaumur, which gives a mean term less than that which we
had taken in corresponding latitudes in the northern
hemisphere.</p>
<p>The barometer, on the contrary, remained at from
28<sup><small>i</small></sup> 2<sup><small>l</small></sup> to
28<sup><small>i</small></sup> 3<sup><small>l</small></sup>, which
gave a mean term warmer than that which the same instrument had
given in corresponding northern latitudes.</p>
<p>At this same epoch, we had also the opportunity of confirming
from our own experience, a valuable remark of Dampier, on the
atmospheric variations of these climates: strong winds arose from
midnight till about six in the morning, blew fresh part of the
day, began to calm towards the evening, and during the night Were
succeeded by a dead calm. These singular circumstances in the
meteorology of these latitudes add much to st he dangers of
reconnoitring them, particularly at this time of the year.</p>
<p>Similar observations will also apply to the general serenity
of the atmosphere in these regions. Never, indeed, had the the
sky appeared so clear, so entirety free from vapours and
humidity. This phenomenon did not escape the observation of the
celebrated navigator have just mentioned: "From the time of our
departure from the bay of Sea-dogs," says Dampier, "we had always
tine weather, and this continued for some time, the sky being all
the while perfectly clear and serene, and without a single
cloud."</p>
<p>These meteorological observations I shall not enlarge upon
here; we shall return to them in another place, where we shall
find them in an extraordinary manner connected with the natural
history of the vast continent which makes so great a paid of oar
subject.</p>
<p>On the 3d of August, during the whole day, we sailed in very
shallow water; however, we did not see the lands, even when night
drew near, which induced our commander to continue the course
towards them; but about ten o'clock at night, the appearance of a
great fire on the coast, made us sensible of our danger; we
hastened to tack about, and lay to, the rest of the night.</p>
<p>On the 4th, we were constantly in sight of land, but obliged
to keep at a great distance because of the shallows; indeed,
often our lead drew but 8, 7, 6, and even 5 fathom, which
compelled us to keep away. The lands which we had in sight,
though they were generally low, level, sandy, and whitish,
seemed, however, not so barren as all those we had successively
reconnoitred before, and the other side the downs was pleasantly
shaded by a curtain of verdure, and diversified with shrubs.
These shores appeared to have more numerous inhabitants, and if
we might judge from the multiplicity of fires that were alight on
the coast, and by their spreading to a distance, we might have
supposed them to be so many forests on fire. On this point the
coast forms a large bay, which we called Gulf Laplace, from the
celebrated, scholar of that name, to whom natural history and
astronomy are indebted for so many useful and valuable
discoveries.</p>
<p>On the 5th we discovered another group of small sandy islands,
but nevertheless covered with some verdure, which we named the
Lacepede Isles. These isles, of which we shall bare to speak
elsewhere, have four principal, which are situated a little
distance from the continent; the largest has not more than three
leagues in length, they develop themselves from the north to the
south on a line of more than twelve miles in breadth. The
situation of the vessel at noon was about 16&deg; 43' 30", and in
the longitude of 119&deg; 33' 30".</p>
<p>From the Lacepede Isles projects a long reef and immense
sand-banks, which we named the Whale Shoals, on account of the
great number of those animals which we found there; we saw also
during the day, quantities of Molusques, various fish and
sea-serpents. Our collection was considerably increased by
numerous species of each of these classes of animals.</p>
<p>To the north of the Lacepede Isles, appears a large white
clifted cape, which we called Cape Borda, from the great
geometrist, who by the perfection to which he brought the
reflective circle, acquired to himself such due honours from the
grateful recollection of navigators of every country.</p>
<p>Cape Borda is situated about 16&deg; 36' south latitude, and
120&deg; 8' longitude east from the meridian of Paris.</p>
<p>The 7th of August, we found ourselves very near the
continental coast. It appeared to us at this point extremely low,
sterile, and sandy. There was a small deep bay, which we called
Berthond Bay, from the estimable artist to whom the navy owes its
best chronometers.</p>
<p>The north point of this bay is formed by a very large cape,
which we named Cape Mollieu. Here all at once the coast changes
its direction, to turn more to the east.</p>
<p>In front of Cape Mollieu is a small island, and several
sand-banks, which we saw very near on the 8th; we called them the
Geographic isles and banks, from the name of the vessel, which
would be the first to make them known to Europe.</p>
<p>The 9th and the 10th of August we lengthened an archipelago of
islands, which we named the Archipelago Champagny; all the isles
of which it is composed, are sterile and chalky; the greater part
of them present a bizarre and picturesque conformation; one of
them particularly remarkable for its form, which perfectly
resembles a bowl reversed. We gave it the name of Freycinet Isle,
from those two much esteemed brothers to whom our expedition was
indebted for so many useful labours. It is easily distinguishable
from all the other isles, not only by its singular form, but also
by its height being greater.</p>
<p>Not far from the Isle Freycinet, there is another which
presents the appearance of the top of an immense edifice, and
which we named the Isle Lucas, in honour of the captain of the
vessel, who signalized himself in the engagement of the
Redoubtable against the Victory.</p>
<p>Some other islands of this archipelago received the names of
the Isle Forbin, the Isle Commerson, the Isle Agnesseau, the Isle
Dugueslin, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>All the isles of the Archipelago Champagny are small; the
largest of them is little more than three leagues in length, and
we counted fifteen or sixteen, of which several were scarcely
half a league. The continental coast which is discernible beyond
these island, represents the same uniform, tiresome, and
invariable picture of sterility.</p>
<p>Every part of the sea hereabouts abounds with fish, and our
collections were increased by numerous species of Balistes,
Chetodons, Lophies, crustaceous productions, and soft
zoophytes.</p>
<p>The 11th, in about 14&deg; 47' 50" of south latitude, and
122&deg; 11' 32" east longitude, we discovered another group of
islands, before which we came to anchor. An officer was
immediately sent to reconnoitre it nearer, and to seek a landing
place; but in vain did M. de Montbazin prolong his stay to
explore these formidable islet; he found them defended at every
point by long chains of shoals, against which the sea broke with
violence, and which did not leave any passage between them. These
islands are of the number of ten or twelve, and make a part of
the great north west archipelago of which we shall speak
hereafter more in detail. They were called the Arcole islands,
and the most remarkable among them received the names Of Colbert,
Isle Buffon, Isle Desaix, Theraudien, Isle Bernouill&eacute;,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>During the time that we were anchored off the Arcole Islands,
we found from the difference of the soundings that the tide rose
from 20 to 25 feet, an observation which seemed to confirm that
of M. de Ronsard at the Isle Depuch, and which is also in
agreement with that of Dampier. That celebrated navigator, as we
have been told, must have been the victim of these extraordinary
tides, his vessel being high and dry at the same place, where the
evening before he had five fathoms water. This circumstance adds
considerably to the danger of the navigation in these seas, and
seems to be the principal cause of the violent currents which are
here experienced.</p>
<p>The 12th, we continued to lengthen the great archipelago,
which we had reconnoitred at all points the evening before. It
presented an aspect altogether the most whimsical, and savage, at
all parts raising itself in a thousand different shapes of sandy,
sterile, and chalky isles, many of them resembling immense
antique tombs; some of them appear united by chains of reefs,
others protected by immense sandbanks, and all, that one could
see of the continent, displayed the same sterility, and the same
monotony of colour and appearance.</p>
<p>In the midst of these numerous islands, there is not any thing
to delight the mind. The soil is naked, the ardent sky seems
always clear and without clouds. The waves are scarcely agitated,
except by the nocturnal tempests of which we have spoken; man
seems to by from these ungrateful shores, not a part of which, at
least as far as we could distinguish, had the smallest traces of
his presence. The dismayed and astonished navigator turns away
his eyes, fatigued with the contemplation of these unhappy isles
and hideous solitudes, surrounded as he views them with continual
dangers; and when he reflects that these inhospitable shores
border those of the archipelago of Asia, on which nature has
lavished blessings and treasures, he can scarcely conceive bow so
vast a sterility could be produced in the neighbourhood of such
great fecundity. In vain would he seek the cause from the
ordinary laws of nature, the true principle of a contrariety
which he cannot discover, nor even conjecture; but this is not
the only phenomenon in the natural construction of New Holland,
and we shall find the same subjects for astonishment and
meditation in each oldie various parts of the history of this
vast continent.</p>
<p>The 13th of August, we continued to lengthen the archipelago
N.W. passing successively fifteen or twenty larger or smaller
islands, absolutely resembling those we had seen the preceding
days, and which we named Isle Forbin, Isle William Tell, Isle
Suffrein, Isle Berthier, Isle Tournefort, Isle Corvisart, Isle
Jussieu, &amp;c. &amp;c. We may see in the large chart of New
Holland every thing which may concern the exact or relative
positions of these numerous isles, and M. L. Freycinet in his
nautical account, will give all the details of their
situations.</p>
<p>The 14th, we confirmed to range near the coast, which amazed
to make a part of the archipelago, every where bordered with
reefs and quick-sands, against which the sea struck with
violence, and varied itself as it were in sheafs of foam.</p>
<p class="poem"><small>"Object&aelig; salsa, spurnant aspergine
cantos."<br>
                        VIRGIL'S &AElig;NEID</small></p>
<p>Never was such a spectacle before presented to our
observation. "These breakers", says M. Boulanger in his journal,
"seem to form several parallel lines at the shore, and little
distant one from the other, above which the waves are seen
raising themselves, successively breaking with great fury, and
forming a horrible cascade of about 15 leagues in length.["]</p>
<p>We navigated at this time is the midst of shallows; the lead
found only at times six fathoms. Then, though more distant from
the land, we were not out of sight of it. At noon the calm having
become settled, the currents drove us against the reefs; we let
go an anchor, in which we lay until six in the evening. It was
not until after we had anchored, that we could reconnoitre the
extent of the dangers we had just escaped. The current formed two
knots, and we were close upon that horrible chain of rocks which
I have just described. This part of New Holland is truly
frightful; all the islands that we could reconnoitre, presented
alike hideous characters of sterility. The more considerable
among them, were named Isle Mollieu, Isle Monge, Isle Laplace,
Isle Cassini, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>During the whole of the day on the 15th, we continued to sail
in the midst of shallows and sand-banks, compelled repeatedly to
tack, and avoiding one danger only to fall into another.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the difficulty of this navigation, our
perilous situation did not deter M. Lesueur and myself from our
usual labours, and this day was marked by a discovery of some
value, a new genus of fish (Balistapodus Wittensis, N.) something
resembling the Balistes, but differing by being totally without
the ventral bladder: this peculiarity makes them the first
specimen of a new order in the Ichthyological system of my
celebrated master, M. de Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de. This learned
naturalist does not confine himself, in his general
classification of fish, to give all the species known to this
day, but rising to considerations more philosophic and general,
he compares all the particular agreements in the organization of
these animals, determines all the possible combinations of the
principal of their exterior organs, and afterwards analyzing all
these combinations which were hitherto known, he from thence
deduces the existence, or at least the possibility of the
existence of those, which to us, are still without example; in
nature; thus, anticipating both, time and experience, he dares in
his descriptions, determine the place which each of these unknown
groups will one day occupy. His great work on the subject of fish
in general was not then finished, and, on these distant shores,
many of his bold conceptions were realized.</p>
<p>On the 16th, during the night, there arose a strong wind from
the E.S.E. which forced us to set sail at day-break; this wind
continued till the 18th; but we had finished reconnoitring the
grand archipelago of the N.W. called Bonaparte Archipelago, in
honour of the chief magistrate of our native country, and the
august protector of our expedition.</p>
<p>At this period our privations lay very heavy on us; the
detestable food to which we bad been reduced ever since our
departure from the Isle of France, had affected the health even
of, the most robust among us; the scurvy increased its ravages,
and many of our seamen were much afflicted, a melancholy presage
of the evils which this scourge was soon to bring upon us.</p>
<p>Our allowance of water began for fail, and we had arrived at
the sad certainty of the utter impossibility of taking in any on
these shores.</p>
<p>The time of the change of the monsoons approached, and the
hurricanes which always follow must of necessity be avoided; in
short, it was requisite to procure us a new chaloupe, to effect
our reunion with the Naturalist, &amp;c.</p>
<p>All these considerations determined the commander to finish
his researches on the Land of De Witt, at the same place where
the great archipelago, called after Bonaparte terminates, that is
to say, in 13&ordm; 15' south latitude, and 123&ordm; 30' east
longitude, from the meridian of Paris.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>CHAPTER X.</h3>
<p align="center"><i><b>Length of our Stay at Timor.</b></i><br>
<br>
<small>[<i>From the</i> 18<i>th of August to the</i> 13<i>th of
November,</i> 1801.]</small></p>
<br>
<p>TWO days after we had left the barren shores of New Holland,
we observed the high mountains of Timor. Three tier of lofty
rocks parallel to the length of the island, formed a triple
amphitheatre, the last gradations of which lay back into the
interior of the lands, which were by much the most elevated. The
form of these mountains, though high, was not rugged, but
lengthened progressively and uniformly, and the lofty summits
regularly descended insensibly by slight undulations which
continued down to the sea beach.</p>
<p>All the other side of these mountains were covered with
natural vegetation; and the vallies might be described as so many
extensive forests of verdure, above which appeared in every
direction the lofty tops of cocoa trees, areka, &amp;c. the
beautiful productions of equinoxial climates.</p>
<p>We quickly passed the shores of Amarassi, and were soon at the
mouth of the strait which forms, with Timor, the isle Rotti
(P&uuml;l&uuml; Rotte) more celebrated for the beauty of the
women than for its mines of copper. On the 21st of August, in the
morning, we crossed this strait, and doubling the north point of
the small island, Landou (P&uuml;l&uuml; Lando&euml;), which in
the maps, is, with many others, confounded with Rotti, we
discovered the entrance of another strait which forms the isle
Sim&acirc;o (P&uuml;l&uuml; Simaw&uuml;), by bending towards the
western point of Timor. In two hours we cast anchor in the middle
of this strait, and opposite a fine bay which belonged to the
island of Sim&acirc;o. Probably it would be difficult to find a
more beautiful and picturesque situation than that which we then
enjoyed: surrounded on all sides by the lands, we seemed as if in
the middle of a beautiful lake, on every side clothed with the
richest colours. Numerous and various kinds of fish, the happy
inhabitants of these peaceful waters, multiplied their species in
the waves, and on whichever side we turned our eyes, the picture
of the most amazing fecundity seemed to be renewed with
additional charm and interest, so great was the contrast between
the beauties of such a situation, and the sterile and monotonous
neighbouring shores north-west of New Holland!</p>
<p>As soon as we had cast anchor, M. H. Freycinet went with the
long-boat to Coupang (K&uuml;pang), the chief settlement of the
Dutch at Timor. It was necessary to present our passports to the
governor of the country, and to take a pilot to conduct us to
anchorage in the bay of Babao, on the south coast of which is
situated the town of Coupang. M. H. Freycinet did not return to
the ship till the next day. He informed us that he had
experienced many difficulties from the different kings of the
country, who not having any knowledge of our nation, confounded
us with their enemies the English, and for a long time opposed
our entrance into the bay. This officer also told us, that the
island abounded in provisions and fresh stores of every kind, and
that we might procure them at a very cheap price.</p>
<p>The pilot, who soon came on board, was a Frenchman, and native
of the environs of Bourdeaux; he was a gunner in the Dutch
company's service, and had resided in these distant regions
fourteen or fifteen years. He related to us, that some years
before, the English having conquered Timor, had by their violence
and oppression forced the inhabitants to take up arms against
them: that the fort Concord, into which they had retreated,
having been taken by assault, seventy or eighty Englishmen had
been cut in pieces and paten by the savage Malays: that from that
moment the most implacable hatred had subsisted among the whole
of the Malay nation towards the English, and towards all that
could remind them of these conquerors.</p>
<p>While our old countryman was relating these particulars, we
were employed in getting under weigh, when we immediately set
sail to leave the strait of Sim&acirc;o, and proceed to the
roadstead near Coupang. Nothing could be more pleasant than this
short voyage: between Timor that Sim&acirc;o the channel is but
two leagues in width, so that we were at a pretty equal distance
from these islands, and perfectly distinguished the two shores.
Each cape which we doubled changed the scene and varied the
landscape, presenting to our sight a difference in the prospect;
but every change was delightful and beautifully romantic and
picturesque. At seven o'clock in the evening we moored in the
roadstead of Coupang, opposite fort Concord.</p>
<p>On the following day, which was the 23d of August, we went in
a body to pay our first visit to M. Lofstett, governor general of
the island of Timor, and the archipelago belonging to it: he
received us with extreme politeness, and offered us every
accommodation we could possibly desire. From that very day two
large houses were appropriated for us: the commander, with the
geographer and the astronomer, Messrs. Petit and Lesueur, took
possession of one of them, and all the naturalists were
accommodated in the other.</p>
<p>We are now come to one of the most remarkable epochs of our
voyage. No country perhaps is more interesting to know, and is at
the same time so little known as the great island of Timor.
Placed by nature in the midst of equinoctial countries, every
where covered with the most useful and estimable fruits of the
earth, and the most valuable animals, situated half way between
New Holland and the other islands of the great archipelago of
Asia, it presents in its atmospheric and geologic constitution,
in its various productions, as well as in its natural and
political revolutions, many interesting subjects of study and
research.</p>
<p>Three distinct races of the human species are here to be found
united, who, placed on these shores from an epoch, the date of
which is almost lost in the obscurity of times long past, still
present themselves to the observation of the philosopher, with
all the originality of character of the ancient nation to which
each of them belong.</p>
<p>The first of these distinct races may be traced to the
aborigines, who, driven into the interior of the lands, are still
almost entirely unacquainted with any social institution, and are
yet armed with the bow, the arrow, and the club of Camoung; sworn
enemies to the Malays, swift in the course, concealed in hollows
of the rocks, or in the depths of the forests, living exclusively
on the fruits of the earth, and the produce of the chase, always
in arms, always at war, either among themselves or with the
Malays, ferocious in all their customs and habits, anthropophagi,
as it is said, and in short, uniting all the characters of the
negro race, such as the short woolly hair, the black colour,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>To the second class of the inhabitants of Timor, belong the
Malays with long hair; these are of a red copper colour,
descended from those ferocious inhabitants of Malacca, the
ancient conquerors of the grand archipelago of Asia: the people
of this race still preserve their original character of
independence, boldness, and ferocity, which distinguished their
ancestors.</p>
<p>Next to, these brave people appear the Chinese, settled for
many ages on most of the islands of the great archipelago; expert
batters, indefatigable dealers, but weak and pusillanimous, they
neither merit, nor have ever obtained any superiority.</p>
<p>Independent of the three classes I have just mentioned, and
which, properly speaking, comprise all the population of the
country, there are found at Timor a few mongrel Portuguese, the
miserable remains of the first conquerors of Asia, and die
pitiable witnesses of the vicissitudes of nations, and the
revolutions of empires!</p>
<p>At length the conquerors of the Portuguese again appeared on
these shores, sustaining with difficulty the former glory of the
Batavian name, and only preserving by their policy or by the
favour of the people, the dominion which were in former times
purchased by so much heroism and courage.</p>
<p>In the midst of so many interesting objects, I endeavoured not
to neglect any pursuit that might make our long stay at Timor
useful to science. I collected the divers materials of the
general topography of this large island; above all, I gave
particular attention to the history of these indigenous people of
the great archipelago of Asia, of which are found the remains and
monuments in the interior of most of the large islands of this
archipelago, at Sumatra, Borneo, Macassar, Timor, Ceylon,
Magindanao, the Philippines, &amp;c. &amp;c. But this part of my
labour ought to be the subject of a particular publication; I
shall therefore confine myself in this chapter to present a few
particulars which belong more immediately to our own story.</p>
<p>As we have before said, the existence of the French nation was
then entirely unknown to the people of Timor, and not one
individual recollected having ever seen the French flag at
Coupang; our acquaintance With the natives therefore began under
the most unfavourable auspices, and distrust uniting with the
natural ferocity of the Malays, against us, we were for some days
as if isolated in the midst of them; but it was soon perceived by
them, from the respect and deference we received from the Dutch
governor and those employed under him, that we belonged to some
powerful and respectable nation: this reflection became the first
pledge of amity between us; and the frank and generous character
which we did not fail to display in all our correspondence with
them either in business or friendship, succeeded in gaining all
their hearts, and we are certain that the French name will long
be cherished by the brave men with whom we now became acquainted
for the first time.</p>
<p>In the morning of the 25th of August I went down to the beach;
the sea was low, and great numbers of the Malays were busy on the
shore gathering up the divers animals which had been left there
by the waves.</p>
<p>Never till that moment had I ever seen such a picture of
fecundity; fish, mollusques, testaceous and crustaceous animals,
&amp;c. &amp;c. all seemed to multiply by thousands on these
shores; but nothing could equal the profusion and singularity of
the spectacle which the solid zoophytes presented; these are
generally known by the name of madrepores; all the shore was
covered With them; all the rocks on which we then walked dry
shod, were alive and moving, and appeared under so many
extraordinary and strange forms, with so many rich colours, so
varied and so bright, that the eye was dazzled by them. In one
place we see the beautiful animal, the Tubipora Musica, which,
proud of the brilliancy of its habitation, spreads out its
beautiful green fringed tentacules above the waves. The great
masses of these demi-globular animals appear like so many spots
of green moss on a bed of coral; in another place appear
projections of enormous madreporic rocks, from 15 to 20 feet in
diameter, as hard as marble, and exhibiting many delicate
beautiful colours. These form the chief part of the soil of the
bay of Babao, a remarkable phenomenon of which we shall speak at
a future time. Of these gigantic masses are formed all the small
islands of this bay, and which are every day extending more and
more from the same causes that first produced them. In the midst
of the mountains in the interior of Timor, in the very heart of
the deep vallies and torrents, we every where find the remains of
these astonishing animals, although it is utterly impossible for
the mind to conceive how or by what means nature has raised these
large madreporic plots to such great heights above the present
level of the seas.</p>
<p>But this is not the only phenomenon which is observed in
studying these productions of nature. In the "<i>Memoire sur
quelques Observations Zoologiques applicables a la Theorie de la
Terre</i>," which I have laid before the Institution, and that
learned society honoured with their approbation, I have described
several others; and we shall have occasion to mention some that
deserve particular notice, in the account of Timor, and also in
the zoologic part of our work.</p>
<p>On the 26th, Messrs. Depuch, Bernier, Lesueur, and myself,
made an excursion into the environs of Coupang. After walking
some little time we came opposite to a delightful habitation; it
was situated in the midst of a fine plantation of cocoa trees; a
stream of fresh water ran murmuring under their shade, and the
house, surrounded with a simple peristyle, but extremely neat,
appeared like a small antique temple, at the end of a long avenue
of orange trees, bananas, pomegranates, and the odoriferous and
beautiful trees.</p>
<p>Enchanted with the appearance of this habitation, we went to
introduce ourselves by the front door, which was then open, when
a Malay, armed with a long sagaie, came and placed himself in the
door-way, and contended the passage; his air was fierce, and his
countenance haughty and disdainful. While we were endeavouring to
make known our desire of seeing the beautiful plantation of palms
which stood in front, another slave ran towards us, armed with a
javelin like the first, and gave us to understand, in a more
insolent manner than the former, that we should not advance any
farther; we therefore departed with a strong sentiment of
prejudice against the owners of this delightful spot.</p>
<p>However, as we went farther into the interior of the island
our collections increased so rapidly, that we were soon obliged
to seek for some place to rest ourselves: a Malay house appeared,
where we were received with all the frank cordiality which so
strongly marks the character of the inhabitants of Timor:
<i>"Doudou, doudou, ba&eacute; oran di France</i>"; "sit down,
sit down, good men of France", was the first word said by him who
appeared to be master of the house. We asked for some fresh
cocoa-nuts; a young man immediately climbed with inconceivable
agility into one of the nearest cocoa trees, gathered four nuts,
and taking two of them with his teeth, and two others in one
hand, he then came down with as much promptitude as he had
mounted.</p>
<p>While we were admiring this singular manner of climbing to the
top of such high trees, and which I shall more particularly
describe in another place, the Malays examined us all with much
attention; our physiognomy seemed to please them, and our youth
appeared to interest them much in our favour: <i>Bae oran
mouda</i> (good young men) passed in a kind of whisper from one
to another.</p>
<p>One of their sagaies engaged my attention. I drew near to
examine it, and wishing to know in what manner it was made use
of, I asked one of the men who were present, to shew me. The
demonstrations of friendship which he had the complaisance to
express to us, seemed to remind him forcibly of the late warlike
events which had taken place on the island: <i>Oran ingress, oran
bounou</i>, (English men, assassins) he repeated, with great
animation: <i>Oran djt&acirc;h&acirc;t</i> (wicked men), and
brandished his sagaie with violence, and became almost furious:
taking one of the cocoa-nuts he placed it on the point of his
spear, and showed us by the most unequivocal gestures, that after
having cut off the heads of the English, they had carried them
about the points of their spears; that the war-dance had then
been danced round them, and afterwards having cut in pieces the
bodies of these unfortunate Europeans, they had then devoured
them.</p>
<p>We will leave this horrible anthropophagi, once general in all
the Asiatic islands, and which the Europeans have succeeded in
abolishing almost every where, but which here remains without
excuse, as no people could be more happily situated in the midst
of the most bountiful gifts of nature, than those who are the
subjects of our present observations. I shall only add, that it
is impossible to bear a stronger hatred, or to thirst for
revenge, more than that which the Malays entertain against the
English. In this respect they entirely justify all that
historians have said of the character of their ancestors.</p>
<p>To this scene there succeeded another of a very different
kind: all the young women, at our approach, had hid themselves in
the sort of seraglio, which was their usual abode, and which I
may describe hereafter. More curious than timid, they continued
peeping at us through the interstices of the bamboo which formed
the partitions of the house; and as we ourselves had naturally
our eyes directed often towards the harem, our good natured
Malay, who appeared more and more pleased with his new
acquaintances, and who doubtless wished to give us a strong mark
of his confidence, without waiting for us to express our wishes,
made signs to the women to come; there were five of them, the
oldest not being above twenty-five years of age; they were all
well proportioned, easy in their mien, and their features were
fine, and particularly expressed that affectionate softness,
which seems a generous appendage and beauty belonging to the
young women of these shores.</p>
<p>The sight of so many young strangers seemed to make a lively
impression on these women; but they soon overcame their natural
timidity, to receive the different presents which we offered
them. Soon after we took leave of these good people to return to
Coupang.</p>
<p>They shewed us every testimony of affection and friendship at
our departure; even the young women no longer feared to lift up
their large black eyes to regard us with kindness; and from a
remarkable kind of gallantry, they each made us a small
present.</p>
<p>On the 28th of August we had a visit from a king of the island
of Sabou (Saw&uuml;) whose name was Amadima; he was a man of
middle stature, good figure and lively manner, about forty-five,
or fifty years of age. We received hire in a room which I had in
common with my friend M. Depuch, but we both had reason to repent
this civility; for the princes and attendants who accompanied
this monarch nearly stripped the apartment of all that it
contained. This propensity to stealing is a sort of passion among
the Malays, and such is their address and cunning on these
occasions, that there were as many dupes among us as there were
individuals on shore. They have this vice in common with all
savage nations, and those who are but little civilized; which
sufficiently proves, that it is not without reason that
legislators have determined the right of property to be the
foundation of all social and civilized institutions.</p>
<p>Of all the different things which we skewed to the good
Amadima, the phosphorus created the greatest astonishment: its
spontaneous inflammation, the quickness of its combustible
properties, the colour of the flame, all together appeared so
extraordinary to the simple monarch, that he spared no entreaties
nor endeavours to induce me to give him the bottle, in which
there was some ounces. After having in vain offered me a great
number of fowls, pigs, and sheep, he seemed determined to make a
last attempt to bribe me to comply. With an air of confidence he
called one of his principal officers, who brought him a pretty
betel bag, in the bottom of which was found a small linen parcel,
which he unfolded and took out a Spanish dollar, and presenting
it to me with an air of assurance so ridiculous as is not easy to
be described, he seemed to say, "At this price it is impossible
you should refuse me." But to his great astonishment, I continued
to refuse, and the poor king not being able to obtain the bottle,
was reduced to the necessity of asking for only a piece of the
phosphorus which it contained. In vain I attempted to give him an
idea of the dangers which attended such substances: Amadima
continued his entreaties in such an affecting manner, that, to
keep his friendship, I at length consented to oblige him, well
persuaded beforehand, that his present, as much to be feared as
that of Medea, would soon cure him of his passion for phosphorus.
I therefore gave him a piece about two inches long, and
cautioning him not to rub it, I wrapt it up in wet linen, and it
was given to the care of the Malay prince, who deposited it in
his fine betel bag, and after embracing me, after the custom of
the country, he disappeared with all his numerous suite. But we
soon saw him again in a state of utter consternation; the
phosphorus had taken fire, as I had predicted, the king's betel
bag had been consumed, and several of the most officious
courtiers had burnt their fingers.</p>
<p>M. Depuch and myself had some difficulty in soothing the
affliction of Amadima; we each offered him a pocket handkerchief,
to make him amends for the loss of his royal betel bag, which had
been destroyed by the phosphorus, and which from that time had
the name of <i>&acirc;pi tacoup</i> (fire which makes one
fear).</p>
<p>This last act of generosity entirely made my peace, and
procured me the friendship of the king of Sabou. "Man Peron",
said he to me as he departed, "you are the good friend of
Amadima, and to-morrow I will send you a pig"; which he certainly
did, at the same time coming himself to present it. We kept him
to dinner: the French cookery seemed to please him, for he did it
honour by eating voraciously. As we had been entirely without
wine ever since our departure from the Isle of France, he was
obliged to drink our bad rum, which nevertheless he said was
excellent; at least, he drank it with so much pleasure, that we
had some difficulty in preventing him from getting absolutely
drunk. In other respects he behaved with that air of dignity and
ease, which is the natural result of superiority of situation,
and particularly characterizes those who are accustomed to
command.</p>
<p>On the 29th of August, while Messrs. Ri&eacute;dl&eacute;,
Depuch, Lesueur, and myself, were exploring a new part of the
interior of the island, our commander, accompanied by some others
of our companions, went to pay a visit to the widow of the former
governor of Timor, madame Van-Esten. This lady was a native of
Amboyna, and descended from the race of Malays; she was about
forty-five, or near fifty years of age, much inclined to the
<i>em-bon-point</i>, and her figure shewed both nobility and
dignity. Sole heir to the wealth of her husband, she was in
possession of an immense fortune: she had fourteen or fifteen
hundred slaves, and the richest plantations in the country
belonged to her, but unfortunately, several of them were the
fruit of the oppression and violence exercised by her husband.
Her own character was mild, her conversation cheerful and
agreeable, and she was generally beloved by the natives; and the
Dutch governor, M. Lofstett, although jealous of a fortune that
enabled this lady to live in much greater splendour than himself,
had great respect for her, and it was him who introduced our
companions in the visit I have just mentioned.</p>
<p>"The country house to which we were conducted", said M.
Boulanger, "is situated on the sea shore. In going thither, we
crossed a most delightful country, watered by running streams on
every side; it might be called a continued wood of cocoa trees,
bananas, mangoes, and numerous other trees not known in Europe.
As we approached the habitation, these trees stood farther apart,
leaving a space between them that formed a large and beautiful
avenue, the middle of which was paved, and sanded with care:
farther on, in a green arbour, was a large square bason, in the
refreshing limpid waters of which, played numerous carp and other
fish. Beyond this we came to a grate enclosed in a kind of
arbour, which was supported by stone columns, which was the
entrance to the house. Opposite to this grate was a large
peristyle, which formed a sort of double penthouse, supported by
columns, the lowest of which resembled a beautiful Chinese
pavilion. Beyond this peristyle was a court, at the farther end
of which was the house itself, protected from the heat and sun by
two rows of galleries on the outside; these were also supported
by columns. The floor of these galleries was painted and rubbed
like our apartments in Europe; they were also ornamented with
very handsome easy chairs of cane and large vases of bronze,
which are in every apartment in these countries, where they are
perpetually chewing betel.</p>
<p>"The mistress of the house, a Malay, and a native of Amboyna,
waited to receive us, standing under the gallery: she was dressed
in a rich and beautiful pagne or wrapper. On her left hand stood
about thirty young women, elegantly clothed in cotton wrappers
and white corsets, with their long black hair platted and folded
round the head. On her right, stood several male slaves in
jackets and white pantahlons: in the lower gallery were other
male slaves in long red cloaks. This regular order, these
singular uniform costumes, the young girls dressed with so much
neatness, and who appeared like so many young nymphs surrounding
their goddess, the beauty of the scene, the coolness of She
adjoining forest, the soft murmur of the stream, the view of the
ocean, on the shore of which this delightful habitation was
situated; in short, all united to present at once every thing we
could conceive of noble, grand, beautiful and picturesque, in a
manner that perfectly enchanted us.</p>
<p>"After the usual ceremonies and compliments, the spectacle
became all at once more interesting: the young women retired for
a moment, and re-appeared, each carrying part of a rich and
elegant collation: one of them brought an elegant Chinese tea
equipage; another presented us with sugar of different sorts and
colours; a third poured out the tea; in short, a great number of
them in quick succession presented each in their turn, pastry,
sweetmeats, preserves, fruit, &amp;c. of many different kinds.
Their manlier of bringing this collation, their graceful motions,
the regular ceremonials which they successively performed, their
profound silence, all helped to remind us Frenchmen of the
beautiful scene of the toilet of Venus in the ballet of
Paris.</p>
<p>"The ceremony of this visit being prolonged till nine o'clock
in the evening, we began to think of returning, and feared we
should be obliged to find our way in the dark, when in a moment
the slaves in the red cloaks appeared, with each a long torch
made of the leaves of a certain tree, which spread a great light
like so ninny flambeaux. We might at the time have fancied
ourselves with Orpheus in his descent to the infernal regions,
for our conductors, with their torches, their costume, and their
colour, resembled the devils of the opera: their doleful piercing
cries, repeated at regular intervals, added another trait to this
similarity. And it was with this singular and romantic escort
that the governor and ourselves entered the town of Coupang."</p>
<p>On the 3d of September, M. Ronsard, who had the charge of
building a new chaloupe from our commander, to replace that which
we had lost in Geography Bay, succeeded at length in getting it
on the stocks; the indolence of the Malays, and the very small
number of our carpenters, who were besides daily falling sick,
made this work very tedious and difficult, notwithstanding the
zeal of the officer charged with its direction.</p>
<p>Among those whom I had occasion more particularly to be
acquainted with during our stay at Timor, was a respectable old
man, whose noble and frank physiognomy interested me every day
more and more. He had observed my taste for the productions of
the sea side, and often came to oiler me something of the kind
which he had fished up or found. The manner in which I received
and acknowledged his kind attentions, had entirely gained me the
esteem of the good old man; I was his <i>sobat ati</i>, (the
friend of his heart). He had many times invited me in the most
pressing manner, to visit his habitation, but ray pursuits had
not yet allowed me to gratify him in this particular. But on the
4th of September I went with my friends, Depuch and Bernier, to
Oba, a charming walk in the vicinity of Coupang, where the house
of the old Malay was situated: one of his young sons was our
guide. We soon came opposite to the beautiful habitation from
which use had been so rudely repelled in one of our first
excursions at Timor. I had since learnt that it belonged to
madame Van-Esten, and it was the very same that M. Boulanger had
described in such brilliant colours. I was surprized that our
young guide seemed to be leading us thither, when all at once he
turned into a small path in another direction, which brought us
opposite a little hut, similar to these inhabited by the poorest
Malays of this country. The simplicity of this kind of humble
cabin, seemed to add a new charm to the delightful landscape
which surrounded it on every side: numberless birds clothed in
the most beautiful colours and varied plumage, played among the
branches of the trees, and a refreshing stream ran at a little
distance front this simple abode.</p>
<p>The old man whom we came to visit, was seated at the entrance
of his cottage, and was amusing himself by playing on the
sasounou; a younger son than the one who had boat our guide,
accompanied him on the sort of flute peculiar to the country; his
wife, a few paces distant from him, was spinning the mate, which
these people use to weave their pagnes; and his daughter, who did
not appear to be more than twelve or thirteen years of age, was
preparing small rice cakes, which she was to carry on the next
day to the basar, (the public market).</p>
<p>At our appearance all the family rose; and their joy was
expressed in every possible way: "Sit down, good men of France",
was the first exclamation from every mouth. The weather was hot,
and the walk had put us all in a perspiration; they brought us a
long cylinder of bamboo tilled with buffalo's milk, which was
still warm, and of which myself and companions drank each a large
draught, when we presented each of our hosts with some present.
The mother accepted a red handkerchief; the young girl some
ribbons, a looking glass, with some pins and needles; the two
boys received each a file and a knife; and the father of the
family a small saw and a hatchet. Such generosity gained us their
entire respect and esteem, and the most lively expressions of
pleasure animated every face.</p>
<p>This amiable family interested us so much, that we wished to
know more of them. We learnt that our respectable old man was
called Ne&acirc;s; his mild companion, Sor&eacute;zana; his
daughter, Elzerina; his eldest son, Pone; and the youngest
Cornelis. This last was of a delicate constitution, a fine form,
with a countenance full of candour and expression; he was of a
quick and lively temper, and seemed to have all the good
qualities and defects which generally belong to such a character,
at the same time he possessed great goodness of heart, with a
quick comprehension, and great good sense.</p>
<p>Pone, on the contrary, was of a much stronger make and habit
of body; his countenance was stern and martial; his disposition
was thoughtful and serious; the goodness of his heart was like
that of Cornelis, but it was hid under a manner less
conciliating. Elzerina possessed in herself all the charms with
which nature in this country has adorned the amiable companions
of man; brought up under the eyes of her good parents, she was
modest and timid, and appeared still more tender and affectionate
than her brothers.</p>
<p>While we were congratulating the aged Ne&acirc;s on the good
qualities of his children, we observed tears fall from his eyes;
and in a moment of sorrow, he said, in a tone of voice which
penetrated us to the heart: <i>Oran di France ada ba&eacute;</i>,
(men of France, you are good). Here he abruptly stopped, but his
eloquent silence seemed to say to us, "All Europeans are not like
you." At this time we did not enough under, stand the Malay
language, to continue the conversation, but the language of
gesture which Ne&acirc;s used, and which among uncivilized and
savage nations, has so much force of expression, did not leave us
much in doubt of the cause of his sorrow and tears; and in the
course of our stay, and during the second time of our touching at
Timor, I learnt all the particulars of the history of this
interesting old man.</p>
<p>Ne&acirc;s had been the king of Coupang; and the magnificent
plantation which we have before described, and in the middle of
which was the residence of madame Van-Esten, had belonged to him.
This part of the coast, as may be perceived from my description,
and that of M. Boulanger, is one of the richest and most
beautiful in the whole island. The Dutch governors had for a long
time coveted the possession of it, but the ancestors of
Ne&acirc;s, naturally attached to the inheritance of their
fathers, had constantly refused every kind of proposal on the
subject; and Ne&acirc;s, from the same sentiment, had followed
their example: M. Van-Esten had therefore found means of making
him suspected by the government, and thus deprived him of his
dignity; and next compelled him, by menaces and ill-treatment, to
give up and forsake his rich and beautiful heritage, with the
exception only of the humble dwelling we have so lately
described, and a small enclosure adjoining.</p>
<p>Thus deprived of the title and fortune of his forefathers,
Ne&acirc;s preserved in his misfortunes the courage of a great
and strong mind. Every day this good old man went down to the
shore to seek his bread, and that of his family. His children
often accompanied him; I sometimes met with them, and the
rencontre always filled rue with sadness and compassion: and
indeed, if it behoves a good man to feel for those who are
oppressed by power and injustice, he must more particularly be
affected, when he sees them exerted to oppress individuals who
are at once so amiable and respectable. Fortunately, we see on
these distant shores, as well as on our own, that crime meets its
just punishment. M. Van-Esten died miserably, execrated by the
Malays, who with reason accused him of having given up their
country in a cowardly manner, to the English, to preserve his own
fortune; and despised even by that nation, who notwithstanding
their engagements with them, had had a hand in the conspiracy, of
which they (the English) were the victims.</p>
<p>All these particulars attached me more and more to the good
king Ne&acirc;s; and our friendship was mutual, for I was
obliged, at his earnest solicitations, to change names with him.
I shall shortly have occasion to enlarge on the subject of this
affectionate custom of the Malays.</p>
<p>Cornelis was my greatest favourite of the children of the old
man: he often came to see me at Coupang, and every time that I
went to Oba, he accompanied me part of the way on my return. One
day he asked me many questions concerning the country of France.
I asked him, if he should like to go with me there: his natural
vivacity made him at first answer without reflection, in the
affirmative; but a moment after he began to reflect in silence on
the proposal I had just made him, and addressing me again on the
subject, he spoke a long time without my being able to understand
half his discourse. Chagrined to find he did not make himself
well understood, he stopped, and turning towards me, he said,
"Man Peron, observe what I am going to do"; he then piled up some
heaps of sand, every one bigger than the last, and spoke in the
following manner, at the same time using such expressive
gestures, that it was impossible to misunderstand the true sense
of what he wished to say. "At Coupang, man Peron, thou art the
friend of Cornelis; but in France a man will come to you and say,
'Sell me this red man', and will shew you money as big as that",
pointing to the smallest heap of sand. "You will answer, 'the red
man is the friend of the man Peron;' thou wilt make the same
answer to those who come and offer thee money as big as these
other heaps;" and he successively shewed them to me, going from
the smallest to the largest, and making me understand by his
gestures, that my refusal would become less and less positive as
the other might be increased; "but at last", said he, "one will
come and offer money as big as that last heap of sand; and you
will then say, that the red man shall be a slave; and then, man
Peron, I shall never see you any more, and they will make me work
very hard, and the poor Cornelis, far from his father Ne&acirc;s,
and his brother Pone, will die of grief and sickness."</p>
<p>In saying these last words, this amiable youth was so much
affected, that his eyes filled with tears, and I myself was but
too much struck with the justice of the reasoning, and quickness
of understanding of Cornelis, not to feel a similar emotion. I
however endeavoured to convince him that slavery was unknown in
France; but as he knew that the Dutch, the Portuguese, the
Spanish, and the English, who are all more particularly known in
these seas, have slaves, he very naturally concluded that the
French must also have some; and as (with the exception of
Batavia) they are ignorant of the countries to which those who
are taken from Timor and the neighbouring isles are sent, but
know that they are carried very far, very far
(<i>dj&aacute;&oacute;, dj&aacute;&oacute;</i>), they are
generally persuaded that they are transported to Europe, where
they are all employed in the most laborious and unwholesome kinds
of work. I have detailed this extraordinary anecdote with all the
particulars, as it may serve for a proof of the natural
understanding of the inhabitants of this region, and as it also
proves the ill opinion which these people entertain of
Europeans.</p>
<p>As we formerly observed, the scurvy, which had began to shew
itself among our crew, had been one of the principal reasons
which had induced our commander to refresh at Timor: ten men
affected with this cruel distemper had been sent on shore at
Coupang the day after we arrived, and were settled in a ruinous
storehouse belonging to the Dutch Company, which was appointed
for our hospital, independent of these ten men who were so
extremely affected by this distemper, we had a great number whose
gums were more or less corroded and bleeding; I myself was of
this number: but these slight symptoms soon disappeared by the
use of fresh provisions and living on shore: and at the time of
which I am now speaking, I found myself perfectly free from any
appearance or symptom of the scurvy.</p>
<p>On the 5th of September, they made signs in the pass of the
strait of Sim&acirc;o, that there were two English frigates, and
some smaller ships of war; the alarm soon became general in the
country, and they were preparing to call together the formidable
Malay militia of the interior, when the disappearance of the
squadron calmed the fears of the colony.</p>
<p>From the 9th to the 15th I was employed in making experiments
with the dynamometer, to ascertain the relative strength of the
people we were among. The interesting results shall be given in
another place.</p>
<p>On the 10th of September I had occasion to make an interesting
observation, which I must acknowledge I was much to blame for not
pursuing further. Among those individuals who came to see us,
there were two who had their front teeth plated with silver of
some thickness, and which adhered so firmly to the enamel, that I
found it impossible, though I tried with my nails, to shake or
move any of these small silver plates. The men who wore them ate
in my presence, without seeming to feel the least inconvenience
from this strange ornament. They assured me that they had
remained thus firmly fixed during five or six months, and they
never separated till they were worn out. We were at a loss to
conjecture what means these men could have used to fix in so firm
and strong a manner, such plates to the enamel of the teeth, or
what could be the substance which could thus resist the
dissolvent property of the saliva and food. Our dentists are
unacquainted with any such substance; they are obliged to make
use of metals, particularly lead, to protect the carious parts of
the teeth, and they have no means of fastening any substance to
the polished enamel of their surface.</p>
<p>The mastich of the Malays would therefore have been in every
respect, a valuable acquisition to European countries, but
occupied as I was in so many different pursuits, I neglected to
get the information which doubtless I might have obtained on the
subject, and I should now omit it altogether, if it was not to
call the attention of other voyagers to investigate a matter
which I much regret that I myself neglected. In the particular
history of Timor, and in describing the kind of fishing-tackle
used by the Malays, I shall offer some conjectures on the nature
of the substance to which I allude; and I have some reason to
believe, that in endeavouring to ascertain the truth of these
conjectures, I may be able to throw some light on the
subject.</p>
<p>On the 11th of September, king Amadima, who seldom passed many
days without paying me a visit, came to see me at a much earlier
hour than usual, and said to me, "Friend Peron, come and eat rice
in my house." His manner at this moment appeared more
affectionate than usual, and besides, there was something
mysterious in his address, which attracted my attention: he took
me by the hand, and I went with him. On entering his palace or
cottage (for either name may with equal propriety serve for this
royal habitation), I perceived a great number of slaves dressed
as is customary on holidays. A whole sheep was roasting under a
shed at a little distance, and several women belonging to the
king were busied in the cookery I could not imagine what was
intended by such great preparations; but soon after our arrival,
the mutton was served up with some rice: Amadima cut up the
sheep, and helped me to a piece of five or six pounds at least,
and himself to one still larger, and began to tear it to pieces
with his nails and teeth in the most expeditious manner. I had no
ambition to contend with him in appetite and voracity, but I ate
as much as I could on the occasion.</p>
<p>When the first edge of our hunger was taken off, the good
Malay king made signs to one of his slaves to bring him a bottle
of rum, and having poured out a large quantity in a vase or cup
made of a cocoa-nut, he said, "Man Peron, thou art the good
friend of the king Amadima; the king Amadima is the friend of the
man Peron; man Peron, the king Amadima gives thee his name; wilt
thou give him thine?" This extraordinary proposal reminded me of
the affecting custom of changing names, which Cook discovered in
most of the islands of the Southern Ocean, and which is also a
custom on the humid foggy shores of New Zealand; I therefore took
care not to refuse this affectionate testimony of the friendship
of the Malay prince, but answered without hesitation, "The man
Peron gives his name to the king Amadima." This change seemed to
fill him with joy, and we cemented our friendship by drinking rum
several times out of the same cup. From that moment I became the
Touan Amadima (lord Amadima); he himself never after called me by
any other name; and on my part I called him the Man Peron:
however, as I had not been in the habit of calling him so, I
often made mistakes; but Amadima, preserving the same <i>sang
froid</i> throughout the whole scene, set me right every time
with great kindness, and never forgot to call me the lord
Amadima; and all his slaves, to whom this change of names was
declared with great solemnity, had orders to regard one as the
friend of the heart of their master, and to call me always Touan
Amadima.</p>
<p>Since that period I have had occasion at many different times
to change my name; the ceremonies were always as simple as that I
have here described.</p>
<p>A similar custom is practised at Madagascar, but with more
formality. The particulars of this ceremony at Madagascar never
having been published, and as it in a manner belongs to this part
of our own observations, I shall here introduce some details
which I have read in a manuscript journal of a voyage made in
1787 to the Valley of Amboula, by the same M. Lislet Geoffroy, to
whose brilliant talents have before paid the just tribute of
respectful mention and admiration.</p>
<p>"Ramafoulak", says M. Lislet, "is the chief of this part of
the valley of Amboula, and resides at Anounoub&eacute;: he
received us very politely, from the recommendation which bad been
sent to him by Dian Louve. All his captains made us presents, as
the friend of their king. As I was resolved to depart on the next
day early in the morning, the time would not permit me to accept
the oath which this chief proposed to make with me, as also one
of his captains whom he presented to me. This oath is a kind of
alliance between two people: they promise and engage mutually to
love and protect each other; each has his godfather or surety, in
this ceremony; each have the stomach scarified in seven places,
ad take seven drops of blood from each, which they receive in a
vase, which previously contains brandy or some other strong
liquor; they next put in it a gun-flint and a bullet, and then
dip the points of their swords or lances in the cup, after which
they present each other with seven spoonfuls of this liquor,
which they swallow. They then give each other their hands, and
grasp them affectionately. The inhabitants of Madagascar observe
religiously all the promises which they make on such occasions,
even at the hazard of their lives; and ever after regard each
other as brothers."</p>
<p>The 12th of September had nearly been a fatal day to M,
Lesueur. While he was in pursuit of a troop of monkies among the
rocks which obstruct the course of the river of Coupang, a
venomous reptile bit him in the heel. Soon after he felt a sort
of numbness in the whole of his leg, which made him but too well
guess what he had to fear from this bite. M. Lesueur hastened
back to the town, but before he could get there his leg was stiff
and much swelled, and he could scarcely bend his knee.</p>
<p>To retard the action of the venom, he bound his thigh tight
round above the knee, but this ligature had little effect; the
thigh itself swelled to such a degree, that it was as much as my
poor friend could do to reach the house. As soon as M. Lesueur
got there he laid himself down on his bed, over: come by fatigue
and pain, and already experiencing all the symptoms of a violent
fever. I was at the time absent from the town, but our doctor, M.
L'Haridon, hastened to him, and without delay cauterized the bite
of the reptile very deeply; and applying to the part a compress,
wetted with ammoniac, he then gave a strong dose of the same drug
to the sick man, recommending him to keep perfectly still and
quiet. He was soon in a profuse sweat, and the pain abated; and
in a few days M. Lesueur felt no more of the wound, except a
stiffness and difficulty of bending his knee, which remained a
long time, and which he still feels at times, particularly in the
variations of the weather. What was most remarkable in this
accident, was the effect of the poison on the person; such was
the rapidity of its deleterious power, that on the evening of the
day on which M. Lesueur was bitten, all the lower extremity
corresponding with the affected heel, became of a green colour,
like flesh that was corrupted. What could have been the nature
and properties of these particles of virus, to make it have such
power in the animal economy, we cannot conjecture. This accident
convinced us that the Malays had sufficient reason for their
extreme fear of reptiles.</p>
<p>In the zoological part of our work, we shall have to speak
more particularly on this subject, and shall make mention of a
great number of these formidable animals.</p>
<p>On the 15th of September, all the scorbutic patients were
entirely cured; but a much more dangerous distemper had begun its
ravages. Eighteen men were already confined to their beds, all
severely and dangerously ill with a most cruel dysentery. Among
this number were my amiable friend M. Depuch, my colleague
Maug&eacute;, and the good and active Ri&eacute;dl&eacute;.</p>
<p>This last was already much broken down by the distemper; but
impelled by his zeal, he still continued his distant excursions
in a destructive and scorching climate. In vain I used every
means I could devise, to engage him to remit his exertions, and
afford himself some respite from his labours. All my prayers, all
those of our physician, M. L'Haridon, were in vain: every morning
at day-break, he set off to make new collections, without seeming
to care at all about his disorder, entirely absorbed by his
desire to justify the confidence he had been honoured with by the
First Consul and the Institution. Amiable and unfortunate man!
who thought he might depend on the strength of his constitution,
already tried by the climate of the Antilles; how much he was
mistaken.</p>
<p>In the mean time our anxiety for the fate of the Naturalist
increased every day; we had not yet obtained any news of her, and
with sorrow we reminded each other, that at the moment when we
first lost sight of her, she seemed to fall to leeward. Probably
she might have been embayed on a lee-shore by the violence of the
storm; or possibly some other. misfortune of the same kind might
have happened to her in the time of our long separation. This
cruel uncertainty grieved us all; we began to lose all hope, and
to despair of ever again seeing our friends, when on the 21st of
September, in the morning, a signal was made that the Naturalist
was entering the bay of Coupang. The joy was general, and we were
soon among our companions, who not having found us at the two
rendezvous, were not themselves without great anxiety on our
account.</p>
<p>The Naturalist, during the time of her separation from us, had
made some interesting discoveries on the lands of Edels and
Endracht; M. L. Freycinet had completed reconnoitring the
supposed bay of Sea-dogs, &amp;c. In the two following chapters
all the particulars of these labours will be given with so much
the more exactness, as this distinguished officer has offered to
take on himself the trouble of writing them.</p>
<p>Captain Hamelin, on his arrival at Timor, had on board but two
men affected with the scurvy; this advantage was the result of
their long stay on shore at different places, and the particular
care he had taken of the health of his crew, added to the great
experience of my esteemed friend, doctor Bellefin, in distempers
of this sort. M. Bellefin had derived great advantage in his
treatment of the distemper, from the use of warm baths of sand;
these were first tried by M. Roblet, the doctor of the Solide, in
the voyage of captain Marchand round the world, and which M.
Fleurieu has mentioned with so much just praise, in many pages of
the excellent account he has given of that voyage.</p>
<p>A few days after their arrival, the officers and naturalists
of our consort, settled on shore in a third house procured for
them by the governor. Our colleague, M. Levillain, preferred
living with us; he was then in perfect health, and little thought
that the term of his youth and existence was nearly at an
end.</p>
<p>From the 25th of September to the 1st of October, our
commander, who had been for some time ill with a dangerous ataxic
fever, experienced successively three such violent attacks, that
for some hours he was thought to be dead. There was not a moment
to lose in giving him the bark, in large doses; but as that
belonging to our ships was of a very inferior quality, I shared
with him the small quantity which I had brought from Europe for
my own use. This medicine operated in a manner that seemed almost
miraculous. It stopped this terrible fever, and in all appearance
saved the life of our commander. During the whole course of this
distemper, his physician, M. L'Haridon, was at once his
comforter, nurse, and friend. To say what was the reward for his
care and humane attention, would shock every generous mind.</p>
<p>The 7th of October was a day of sorrow and affliction to both
ships: M. Picquet, one of our most deserving officers, was sent
to Batavia, arrested by order of our commander, whom he had had
the misfortune to offend. He was for above six weeks confined in
the Dutch fort, and the most severe orders were given, that on
arriving at Batavia, he might be confined in one of the
unwholesome dungeons of the citadel of that town. On this
momentous occasion, the principal officers of both ships gave M.
Picquet the most flattering testimonies of their friendship and
esteem. Every day one of our officers, with one of the
Naturalist's, went to keep him company, and to partake with him
such dinner as we were able to send him. At the moment of his
departure, every one was eager to give him letters and proper
attestations to refute the calumnies which might be repeated to
his prejudice. On his arrival at Batavia, M. Picquet was declared
at liberty by the Regency, notwithstanding the letters and
misrepresentations of our commander; and immediately on our
return to France, he was promoted from the rank of enseigne de
vaisseau to that of lieutenant. This was sufficient to prove that
he had been in no way deserving of punishment.</p>
<p>On the 11th of October, our shipmate, the unfortunate
Ri&eacute;dl&eacute;, was very ill; he had been confined to his
bed for several days; the inflammation had spread from the rectum
to the rest of the intestines, and the pains he suffered were
horrible. M. L'Haridon, who had placed him in his own room, that
he might be always at hand to afford him every care, was soon
convinced that those cares were in vain; and from this very day
his death was but too certain, and our grief extreme.</p>
<p>The 12th, we lost one of our gunners, whose name was Frantz he
was the first on the long and fatal list of deaths, which we
shall hereafter have to enumerate and lament.</p>
<p>On the 18th, a second man of our crew died.</p>
<p>On the 21st, the unfortunate Ri&eacute;dl&eacute; departed
this life; and on the 22d he was buried with all possible
solemnity, considering our present situation. The crew of both
vessels, all his friends and shipmates, assisted at his funeral;
the coffin was carried by four Dutch soldiers; two officers, and
two naturalists held the four corners of the pall. The Dutch had
wished to take part in our affliction, therefore all the soldiers
of the fort were under arms. The governor and all the officers of
the company appeared in mourning. During the whole time the ships
had all their yards across and their colours lowered; the guns
fired every quarter of an hour, and several vollies were tired
over his grave, where was raised a stone, rough indeed, but
which, hallowed by affection and universal sorrow, would honour
the memory of our friend as much as those superb monuments often
raised by pride or adulation.</p>
<p>This simple tomb received additional interest from a
circumstance which was rather remarkable, and which deserves to
be mentioned. The adventure of captain Bligh is well known; he
was sent to fetch from Ta&iuml;ti some plants of the bread fruit;
his crew, seduced by the women of those countries, mutinied, and
took possession of his frigate: and in the ship's boat, with a
small quantity of provisions, captain. Bligh, with eighteen men
who had not taken part in the mutiny, had crossed immense seas,
escaped the darts of the savages, and at length, as if by
miracle, had gained the bay of Coupang. A few days after his
arrival, his botanist, Mr. Nelson, died in consequence of the
hardships he had suffered in such a perilous voyage, and was
inhumed in the cemetery of the Dutch. On the recollection of this
circumstance I thought it would be easy to discover the spot
where Mr. Nelson had been buried, and I went to speak to the
commander on the subject, who ordered me to make the necessary
enquiries of the governor. A Dutch soldier, who bad assisted at
the funeral of Mr. Nelson, conducted me to the spot, and the
grave of our unfortunate companion was dug by the side of that of
the English botanist. The monument I have before mentioned, was
thus made to preserve the memory of the two naturalists united in
the same tomb.</p>
<p>Thus perished in the flower of his age, Anselme
Ri&eacute;dl&eacute;, principal botanist of our expedition. Every
moment that he could spend on shore had been devoted to labours
that were well deserving of a better fate. His collections of
dried plants, seeds, and samples of different kinds of wood, were
very numerous, and had always been preserved with the greatest
care. He had before made a voyage to the Antilles, and had
brought from thence the most beautiful and the richest collection
of living plants, that had ever been seen in Europe. It is to be
regretted, that the green-house where these plants are preserved,
has not been dedicated to this estimable philosopher.</p>
<p>On the 23d of October, we were again alarmed by the appearance
of an English squadron, and with more cause than the first time;
for, about the middle of the day, we really saw the Virginia, a
beautiful English frigate, who entering the strait between
Poulou-Sim&acirc;o and Poulou-Kea, seemed to be steering towards
the anchorage where we were. The Batavian governor hastened to
give the necessary orders for the defence of the fort and the
roadstead; large companies of soldiers, drawn, from the environs
of Coupang, were called together, and soon came down from the
tops of the neighbouring mountains; but they did not dare to fire
the alarm gun, at the noise of which the militia of the interior
of the island would assemble together at Coupang, because these
troops consist of ferocious and sanguinary men, who are
formidable even to the Dutch themselves.</p>
<p>All these preparations were happily as unnecessary as on the
former occasion. The captain of the English frigate, after seeing
our passports, which were carried to him by M. Montbazin, one of
our officers, declared himself totally ignorant of the nature of
our mission, but that having learnt at Delly that two French
ships were at anchor in the roadstead of Coupang, he had supposed
them to be merchant ships, and therefore had resolved to go
thither and make prizes of them, in spite of the Dutch cannon,
which he seemed to care little for. This officer, whose name I
regret that I do not know, behaved to us with the greatest
politeness. Having heard that our commander was sick, he offered
M. Montbazin some bottles of excellent wine for him, which he did
not think himself authorized to accept. Moreover he told him,
that Ternate, one of the most considerable Dutch settlements in
these latitudes, had experienced the same fate as Amboyna and
Banda; and that an English 74 gun-ship had recently taken fire in
the roadstead of Amboyna, and had blown up.</p>
<p>Thus, after having conversed some time with our officer, the
English captain regained the strait of the bay, and sailed away
without firing a single gun, though he was so near the fort and
town of Coupang, that he might with advantage have given them
each a few broadsides. In thus abstaining from all hostility, the
English captain gave us a particular mark of his esteem and
consideration for the object of our voyage. It appeared also,
that the climate of these regions had not spared his crew, for M.
Montbazin thought he could perceive that they were much
encumbered with sick between decks.</p>
<p>The dysentery continued its ravages among the crews of both
our ships, the number of sick were considerable, and daily
increased, some of them died every day, and others were very ill.
In a private memorial which I have laid before the medical
college of Paris, I have given my opinion on the cause of this
scourge, to which so many successively were the victims. It will
suffice here to observe, that all the cares of Messrs. L'Haridon,
Bellefin, and Taillefer, constantly failed in contending with
this formidable epidemic. They had the goodness to invite me to
their consultations: we opened the bodies of several that died:
we successively tried every means that seemed to take most
effect; all was in vain; and whoever was attacked with any degree
of violence by this terrible disease, infallibly died. It pursued
us, as we shall soon see, to the extremity of the globe, and
strewed the seas with our dead bodies.</p>
<p>All our most valuable friends were seized by this malady my
industrious colleague, Maug&eacute;, had been long confined to
his bed. This worthy man had, when we first settled on shore,
incautiously given way to the excess of his zeal for the service,
and he soon died a victim.</p>
<p>I before mentioned, that soon after he came on shore, our
colleague, M. Levillain, had come to lodge with us: the dreadful
climate of Timor soon began to affect him with the same distemper
as that which had destroyed our companions. He was soon unable to
leave his bed, and took to it to rise no more.</p>
<p>At the same time, our botanist's first assistant, Sautier, who
also lodged in our house, was mortally attacked: and to fill up
the measure of our miseries and misfortunes, my dearest friend,
M. Depuch, received by my side the fatal stroke which was to
precipitate him to the grave.</p>
<p>M. Boulanger, our geographical engineer, and M. Lesueur, were
also confined to their beds; one by a violent fever and
inflammatory cholic; the other by the dreadful dysentery, the
general distemper. Even our domestics were all sick, and confined
to their beds; and consternation reigned on board our ships.</p>
<p>In the midst of such sorrow, and among so many disasters, I
was in perfect health, and I was the only one up among all those
who lived in the same house. This precious advantage was
certainly not produced by repose; for no one, I can appeal to
every individual belonging to our two ships, exerted himself with
more zeal, or suffered more fatigue, than I did; and I had made
an innumerable collection of the most beautiful subjects of every
kind, with much labour and many arduous exertions; and with still
stronger reasons I could not ascribe my health to the strength of
my natural constitution, for it was weak and delicate. At a
future time I shall give my opinion on the causes of the
dysentery in hot climates, and shall also shew by what simple
though efficacious precautions, I was enabled to avoid this cruel
epidemic; and have ascertained the sad certainty that most of my
friends, if they had subjected themselves to the same regimen as
myself, might have been still living.</p>
<p>In these unhappy circumstances our physician, M. L'Haridon,
distinguished himself not only by his great assiduity in
attending the sick, but still more by his generous conduct in
other respects. Tired and affected at the repeated refusals which
he every day experienced, of the most simple demands, he spent
all the money he had, and sold all that would fetch money, and
even part of his clothes, to purchase necessaries for the sick
under his care; thus giving a double example of the humanity and
generosity which ought to distinguish the physician. This is not
the only trait of the kind which we shall have to mention in the
character of M. L'Haridon, and which we shall make known with so
much the more pleasure, as general esteem will be the flattering
reward; and to multiply that esteem the greatest honour we can
bestow.</p>
<p>On the 6th of November, thanks to the assiduous attention of
M. Ronsard, our chaloupe was finished and launched into the
water. The day which gave us a boat, of which we were so much in
want, was to us a real time of rejoicing; and we had not the
least conception that she was to experience a similar fate to
that of our first chaloupe.</p>
<p>The loss of M. Picquet was not the only one among our
officers; M. St. Croix Lebas, the captain of our frigate, was
landed as sick a few days before our departure, and settled at
the Dutch fort, there to wait the recovery of his health, and an
opportunity of returning to Europe.</p>
<p>At length, on the 12th of November, in the evening, we went to
take leave of the governor; and on the next day, in the morning,
we set sail from the bay of Coupang, going out by the strait
between Poulou Kea and Sim&acirc;o. We had been at Coupang
eighty-four days, and our stay there, under all considerations,
had been very fatal; we had lost a great deal of time; death had
robbed us of several of our shipmates, and we were encumbered by
a great number of sick on board each of our vessels. Such were
the deplorable consequences of this long stay at Coupang: it even
appeared very probable, that a farther residence in this island
would have lost us all the remainder of the crews of both ships.
Which of us would not have thought at the time, that we quitted
these destructive shores for ever.</p>

<p align="center"><i><b>The Discoveries of the Naturalist, at
Edel's Land*.</b></i><br>
[From about Perth to Cape Naturaliste, W.A.]</p>
<blockquote>[* This and the following chapter were written by M.
L. Freycinet.]</blockquote>
<p align="center"><small>[<i>From the</i> 8<i>th of June to
the</i> 6<i>th of July,</i> 1801.]</small></p>
<br>
<p>THE gale of wind which had forced us to set sail with such
precipitation from Geography Bay on the night of the 8th of June,
had nearly proved fatal to the Naturalist. This vessel not being
by any means so good a sailer as the Geographer, and in other
respects an inferior ship, we could not without great difficulty,
keep her clear of the land, towards which she was continually
driven by the violence of the winds and currents. The excessive
rolling of the vessel at this time, and the necessity we had of
carrying sail, made us in fear every instant that our masts would
go by the board, and the smallest damage of that sort must
inevitably have caused the loss of the ship. Every two hours we
were obliged to tack, and for three whole days were compelled to
do so, without being able to take a moment's rest.
Notwithstanding so many efforts, there was one instant when we
gave ourselves up for lost, and every one expected inevitable
death, when a slight variation in the wind permitted us to clear
the land, and to double the southern point of the bay.</p>
<p>On the night of the 9th, we entirely lost sight of our
consort, the wind continuing to blow with great violence; and it
was not until the 13th that we were able, without danger, to
carry any more sail. We made use of this opportunity to bear away
to the isle Rottnest, which was the first place of rendezvous
appointed by the commander, and we arrived thither on the 14th.
The Geographer, contrary to our expectation, was not there; we
therefore resolved to wait for her; and captain Hamelin, to make
good use of the time, sent different boats to find an easy
landing place, and to see what were the different productions of
the isle Rottnest. At the same time one of the boats was sent
under the command of M. Heirisson, to reconnoitre the mouth of
the river of Swans, and to go up it as far as was possible. Six
days' provisions were granted him for this expedition.</p>
<p>On the 17th of June, Messrs. Millias and Levillain departed to
visit the isles to the S.S.E. of the isle Rottnest, and on the
same day I was sent in the little boat with M. Faure, to
reconnoitre more particularly the isle Rottnest, and to ascertain
its situation.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic-4" id="pic-4"></a><img alt="" src=

<br>
<b><small>4. Plan of Rottnest Island and the River of Swans,
W.A.</small></b></p>
<p>When we departed the weather was tolerably fine; but a strong
breeze from the N.W. rising all at once, the sea soon increased
to a terrible height, and the waves, which broke with fury
against my little skiff, threatened its destruction every moment.
In this extremity I could not return on board, on account of the
wind being contrary; I therefore wished to get to windward of the
isle Rottnest, which, from a long chain of breakers that run out
to sea a great length, was impossible; and to save ourselves, we
had no other resource than to run the boat on shore, to avoid
being swamped. A small sandy beach appeared a-head, of which we
took advantage to run her on land, whither the surf carried her
with great rapidity. We threw ourselves all into the water, and
uniting our efforts, endeavoured to save our skiff, by drawing
her up to the beach; the attempt was vain, for it was soon
covered by the waves, and with difficulty we saved some pounds of
biscuit, for all the rest of our provisions disappeared with the
boat.</p>
<p>Thus situated it was impossible for M. Faure and myself to
prosecute the labour we were sent with the boat to perform, we
therefore attempted to execute our commission on shore, by making
the tour of the island on foot; but the rocks which stretched
along the coast on the north, were too steep for us to attempt to
get over them: we were therefore obliged to go into the woods,
which were so thick in this part that we could proceed but
slowly, and with difficulty.</p>
<p>Chance conducted us to a delightful valley, at the bottom of
which were several ponds; we went down to the brink of one of
them; a prodigious number of bivalve shells of one single
species, formed a sort of beach round it, about the breadth of 15
feet. The water of these ponds is salt and brackish.</p>
<p>After giving a few moments' attention to the observation of
these salt ponds, which we named Duvaldailly's Ponds, from the
name of the young cadet who accompanied us, we continued our way
to get nearer the beach, hoping to have passed the rocks, which
bad at first stopped our course, but we were soon convinced that
they stretched almost without interruption as far as Cape
North.</p>
<p>In traversing these rocks we observed a piece of wood, which
created some painful reflections: it was the cross piece of the
bitts, belonging to a vessel of from 300 to 350 tons burthen, on
which might easily be distinguished the marks of the friction of
the cables; and several iron bolts, which left us no doubt of the
certainty of a recent shipwreck.</p>
<p>This unforeseen circumstance much increased our anxiety for
the fate of the Naturalist, which we knew had moored, during the
storm, a-head of some dangerous reefs; it also made us more
sensible of our own perilous situation, which every moment became
more and more alarming. Black and threatening clouds had gathered
together on every part of the horizon; the squalls were
impetuous, and the thunder reverberated with great violence in
the adjacent valleys; a heavy rain fell in torrents, and the
waves broke with noise and violence against the rocks on the
shore; and to add to our distress, we knew that it was impossible
for captain Hamelin, without a chaloupe, and without any boat
that could live, to send us any assistance, while the storm
lasted.</p>
<p>A few moments we yielded to these sad reflections on our way
to the shore, which we did not reach till long after it was dark.
We feared we should find our boat gone to pieces, the sea having
constantly beat over her on the spot where she was aground: we
saw, however, with pleasure, that she had stood the shock, and
that only one plank had been stove in. To add to our good luck,
the tide was now high, and we went into the water to endeavour to
draw her on the beach, in which endeavour we at length succeeded,
to our great satisfaction.</p>
<p>Our boat being thus in safety, we studied how to procure water
for our necessities. There did not seem to be any on the island,
and we were therefore obliged to find other means of supplying
this want. We spread out the sails of our boat to catch the rain
water as it fell; this expedient succeeded, and the whole night
was devoted to the same labour. We also killed on this day and
the following, several phoc&aelig;, or sea-calves, the flesh of
which was well tasted.</p>
<p>On the 19th of June, we perceived the Naturalist under sail; I
observed her a long time with my glass, and I judged from the
circumstance, that she was endeavouring to get nearer the island.
We immediately lighted a large fire, to let her know on what part
of the coast we were. However, no assistance appeared all that
day, and our situation was now very critical, and would have been
much worse if the rain water had failed us. I studied to devise
some means of repairing our boat, so that we might get on board.
The want of nails made rue think of unripping some of the lining
of the boat of least consequence, and thus to replace the planks
which had started. I was next to devise some method of caulking
the seams: I deferred this part of the labour till the next day,
and in the mean time the remainder of this was employed in
untwisting some pieces of cordage to make oakum, for the purpose
of stopping the leaks in the boat. I had the design of paying the
seams with a mastich composed of the grease of sea-calves and
ashes; and I had no doubt but that our boat thus repaired would
take us safely on board. Fortunately all these labours were
unnecessary; the wind having much abated during the night of the
19th, the captain lost no time in sending us some provisions; and
judging that our boat must have suffered some serious damage, he
also sent us a caulker to repair it. This work being done we
embarked, and got on board the vessel about three o'clock in the
afternoon. I then learnt that the chaloupe, which was sent on the
17th to reconnoitre the isles situated to the S.S.E. of our
mooring, had been wrecked on the continent; that the long-boat
sent to the river of Swans had not yet returned; that every one
was anxious for her safety; and that on the 18th, at two o'clock
in the evening, they had descried the Geographer from the
mast-head, making sail to the north under her top-sails; she was
at the distance of about eight leagues. We were all at a loss to
conjecture why the commander, after having himself fixed the
rendezvous, did not come thither to meet us. As for captain
Hamelin, without his chaloupe, his two boats, and the chief part
of his crew, he was not able to get under sail to join the
Geographer.</p>
<p>On the 22d of June our boat returned, after fulfilling her
mission in the river of Swans. The following particulars of this
exploration was given by M. Bailly, who accompanied M. Heirisson
in the voyage.</p>
<p>"The river of Swans", says M. Bailly, "discovered in 1697, by
Vlaming, was thus named by him, from the great number of black
swans which he there saw, and of which he carried two alive to
Batavia. On the 17th of June, at eight o'clock in the morning, we
perceived the mouth of the river; it was obstructed by a bat of
rocks, which almost denied us a passage; however, after being
aground on them three times, we succeeded in clearing them, and
from that time the depth increased rapidly. An amazing number of
pelicans had fixed their abode near this part of the river: we
could only catch one of them.</p>
<p>"The beach was covered with a great quantity of white
mollusques, or jelly-fish, transparent and gelatinous, which bad
been left there by the tide, and which was the food of the
numerous fowl which frequented these shores. The soil is here
composed of downs of sand, some higher than others; the rock
which terminates them at the sea-side is of a calcareous nature,
mixed with sand full of excavations and hollows, which seemed to
be the effect of the waters. On these downs grew many different
kinds of shrubs, several of which were in flower. The Eucalyptus
resinifera, is to be found there in great quantities, and numbers
of land birds, particularly beautiful perroquets, played in the
branches of the trees, and enlivened, these unknown, wild, and
desert shores.</p>
<p>"At a little distance from the sea the left bank of the river
becomes steep and perpendicular, and discovers a bed of sandy and
calcareous rocks, disposed in horizontal layers; farther up the
steepness is on the other side of the river, and appears like a
great circular wall crowned with verdure. Every where on the
banks are seen evident traces of the former bed of the sea; the
rock is almost entirely composed of incrustations of shells,
roots, and even trees in a state of petrifaction; a phenomenon
that is often seen in many parts of New Holland. In other
respects the country is here flat, and has no elevation of any
consequence except some at a considerable distance from the sea
shore. Beyond this circular wall, which I before mentioned, the
steepness again appears on the left shore, and presents the same
resemblance of ruins, and the same geological constitution which
I have already described.</p>
<p>"We soon came to a large bason formed by a low ground, on
which the river expanded to a greater extent: almost the whole
breadth of this bason was a shoal; on the left, side we observed
a sort of branch or creek, which seemed to open another
communication with the sea, and we named it Moreau Entrance, from
the cadet of that name who accompanied us in this short
voyage.</p>
<p>"After doubling a low cape which ran out from the left shore a
good way into the bason, we intended to land and pass the night
at the foot of a high bank on the right shore; this bank, which
was very steep, had at the base a small flat shore of sand, where
we pitched our tent; here we were in perfect safety, with the
boat afloat and moored to a tree, and her head among the herbage
that grew on the beach; it was impossible to come near us without
crossing the river, or descending the hill, at the foot of which
we were situated, which could not be done without difficulty, on
account of the steepness.</p>
<p>"On ascending to the top of this hill we were charmed with a
beautiful prospect. On one side we discovered the upper course of
the river, which went up towards a range of fiat mountains in the
distance, and on the other we could follow its course down to the
sea-shore. The banks of the river appeared almost every where
covered with beautiful forests, which extended a considerable way
into the interior of the country. The rock, which sometimes
appears naked, is of the same nature as all those which I have
before described; that is to say, it is calcareous, composed of
sand and shells, and covered with a bed of sand mingled with the
remains of dead vegetation, which thus manures the forests.</p>
<p>"On the 18th of June, at the break of day, we re-embarked to
continue our voyage. On leaving the place where we had spent the
night, we again met with great numbers of pelicans, which came
and flew about us; we killed two of them, after which, pursuing
our way for about half an hour, we found ourselves aground on a
shoal of soft mud extremely greasy and sticky: we had great
difficulty in dragging our boat off this shoal, which at length
we did after much labour. The course of the river is here almost
closed by a string of small low wet islands, which we have
described in our chart of the river of Swans, under the
denomination of the Heirisson Isles, from the name of the officer
who at this time commanded us.</p>
<p>"It was near the Heirisson isles that we first saw some black
swans; they swam majestically, on the water; we killed several of
them; their plumage was totally black, except the quill feathers,
which were white, the beak red, and the feet black. We observed
that a short time after they were dead, the beak lost its fine
red colour, and became black. The whole of the country which we
saw from this part till the evening was low and almost under
water, with a bed of coarse sand, which seemed to come from a
rock of ancient formation, covered with a bank of thick clay,
which is reddish and sticky. Some other phenomena correspond with
this change in the nature of the soil. Confined by the bed of
clay, the rain water and the dews remain on the surface of the
ground, and filtering through the coarse sand we have mentioned,
form muddy pools of stagnant water, and a sort of small lakes, or
else run in little streams towards the river, whose waters from
that moment begin to lose something of their saltness, which till
then were as salt as the waters of the sea.</p>
<p>"The same evening we pitched our tent near the river, in an
angle of the land formed by that stream, and a small arm, up
which Messrs. Heirisson and Moreau went on foot for about half a
league, where it terminated. They were here surprized at the
appearance of the print of a man's foot, of an extraordinary
size.</p>
<p>"On the 19th of June, after filling our casks from a sort of
little well which I had discovered the evening preceding, and
which I thought was not the work of nature, we proceeded up the
river; from which the spot where we then were, seemed to bend its
course towards a chain of mountains that appeared to be at no
great distance from us: this circumstance made us hope we might
be able to reach its source; unfortunately we were mistaken in
the distance of these mountains: for, after sailing the whole
day, we discovered that they were still very distant. The river
from this time became narrower very rapidly; but its depth was
still from 7 to 8 feet, without any sensible difference.</p>
<p>"In the mean, time we had thus been exploring the interior of
New Holland, our provisions began to run short; in fact we had
scarcely enough remaining for our return to the ship; we were
therefore obliged to give up our first intention, of lengthening
our voyage to the foot of the mountains; and on the next day,
which was the 20th of June, we began to go down the river.</p>
<p>"On the 21st, in the morning, we found ourselves on the shoals
which had stopped us on our way up; we now thought we might avoid
them, by keeping towards the right shore of the river, but we
were mistaken, for before we had gone a quarter of a league we
were aground. In vain did we attempt to get her of; every means
were in vain, and we were obliged to make a sort of raft, and
lighten our boat of its heaviest articles, such as the graplin,
the water casks, &amp;c. we then all went into the river, and
pushing with all our strength, at length succeeded in getting
afloat about two o'clock in the afternoon. Our joy was as short
as it had been great; we were again stranded on a sand-bank,
which was not more than half a foot under water; we were now
obliged to labour hard for several hours to get over this last
obstacle; and we should never have succeeded if a brisk wind had
not sprung up very apropos to extricate us from so critical a
situation, for we were all sinking with faintness and fatigue;
for above thirteen hours we had been in the mud up to the waist,
striving ineffectually the whole time to save our boat; we had
now scarcely provision sufficient for one meal; and as it was
totally impossible to reach the ship in less than twenty-four
hours, we could not recruit our strength by the means of food. In
the midst of these increasing distresses and dangers night came
upon us suddenly; and we were preparing to land and dry
ourselves, and recruit our exhausted strength by a little rest,
when all at once we heard a terrible noise that filled us with
terror; it was something like the roaring of a bull, but much
louder, and seemed to proceed from the reeds which were very near
us. At this formidable sound we lost all desire to go on shore;
and, though benumbed with cold, we preferred passing the night on
the water, without food, or being able to close our eyes, and
suffering the whole time from the rain and the weather.</p>
<p>"On the 22d, at day-break, we all got into the water to launch
the boat, which was again aground; the rising tide was in our
favour, and we succeeded after some labour and difficulty. Soon
after this last effort we landed and made a large fire to warm
our frozen limbs, and take some refreshment. We continued our way
down the river, and at length reached its mouth. We now kept
along shore on the left, and in the evening we got on board,
cruelly harassed with fatigue, and almost famished."</p>
<p>The importance of M. Bailly's relation has obliged me to
detail all the particulars at length, as they are so much the
more valuable because they make part of the natural history of
New Holland; and all that can add to our knowledge on the subject
of the interior of this extraordinary continent, must be
particularly acceptable to natural philosophers and
geographers.</p>
<p>In the mean time the chaloupe, which had been wrecked on the
neighbouring coast, had been much damaged; it was therefore
necessary to send carpenters thither to repair her. Four entire
days they were employed in this work; and it was not till the
22d, in the night, that they came on board. We then learnt the
following particulars of the labours and misfortunes of our
shipmates.</p>
<p>They left the ship on the 18th of June, to reconnoitre the
islands which lay S.S.E. of our mooring. At first they lengthened
a bed of rocks of great extent, and next drew near a small barren
island, which we named Isle Bertholet. South of this they
discovered a third, which was almost as large as the isle
Rottnest, and to which we gave the name of the Isle Buache. On
this last island was a great number of phoc&aelig;, who kept
their ground at a little distance from the shore, and seemed to
dispute the way with our seamen. This bold, ness cost them dear,
for they killed a great number of them.</p>
<p>Compelled to re-embark precipitately on account of the N.N.W.
winds which blew in squalls, our shipmates worked to windward all
night among breakers; the waves beat against the chaloupe with so
much force, that it was as, much as three men could do to bale
out the water. At three o'clock in the morning, exhausted by
fatigue, and not knowing which way to steer to avoid the
breakers, which surrounded them every way, they determined to
throw out the graplin. From the break of day they got ready to
tack towards the north, and endeavoured to make towards the ship,
but soon the main-mast of the chaloupe was broken by the violent
squalls, and came by the board into the sea, with her sail; it
was not in their power to remedy this misfortune, or contend with
the fury of the winds. From this moment they were driven by the
waves against the breakers, and our unfortunate comrades took the
resolution of throwing themselves on the shore. Wrecked as they
were, with the chaloupe broken to pieces against the rocks, yet
they were all saved; and even succeeded in hauling the vessel on
the beach, and thus saved her also from being totally lost.</p>
<p>Thus confined on this desert shore, our shipmates, while they
waited for assistance from the ship, made several incursions
towards the interior of the country; in one of these journies
they discovered a species of almond of the size of a walnut, and
they were eager to gather some of them. Roasted in the ashes
these almonds tasted very much like roasted chestnuts; but all
who ate of them soon experienced the fatal effects of the
deceitful repast. They were attacked by alarming and painful
vertigos, and dreadful vomitings; and they all thought that they
were mortally poisoned. These grievous symptoms, however,
gradually, disappeared, and no one died. "For my part," said M.
Levillain, who had eaten four or five of these almonds, "I was
extremely ill; after bringing up the small quantity of food which
I had on my stomach, I continued to strain and retch till I
brought up two large glasses of blood, at the same time suffering
the most excruciating pains." Ever since," added he, "I have
continually felt great pains in the stomach." What a dreadful
alternative for navigators; in such situation's they are reduced
to the necessity of either suffering all the pangs of famine, or
being obliged to eat such food as may be poisonous and
destructive.</p>
<p>The pleasure of seeing the boats Once More together on board
the ship, obliterated in a great degree the recollection of the
disasters and fatigues; but the general anxiety for the absence
of the Geographer increased every day.</p>
<p>Captain Hamelin could not be persuaded that the commander
would neglect to come to the rendezvous appointed by himself, our
captain therefore determined to prolong his stay on this
dangerous coast. Our gentlemen made use of the opportunity to
make excursions on the neighbouring islands, and M. Bailly made
many observations on the geologic nature of their soil.</p>
<p>"On the 23d of June, in the morning," says this naturalist, "I
went with the long-boat to the isle Buache; we did not reach this
island till towards the evening. On our way we recollected the
Reef Giraud, which is distinguished by the shape of one of its
rocks that much resembles a shoe. This rock is the more
remarkable for the great number of sea-fowl which are always to
be seen there. A little farther is the isle Bertholet; this is
small and barren. All these isles and rocks, which are here and
there dispersed a little distance from the shore of the
continent, are connected together by a shelve of rocks, which
extends near three leagues out from the main land. The isle
Rottnest itself is connected with these reefs; the sea breaks on
many places of this shoal; and in some parts it is impossible for
the smallest boat to find a passage.</p>
<p>"The isle Buache is composed of calcareous rocks, more or less
mingled with sand, and containing some remains of shells; these
are disposed in horizontal beds of but little thickness, which
seemed to go some way into the interior of the land. Instead of
appearing in separate hillocks, these rocks form long continued
ridges, which on each side have a regular declivity or slope: the
soil, although entirely composed of calcareous sand, nevertheless
supports a strong an healthy vegetation. We could find no fresh
water on this island; and it is not to be wondered at,
considering the nature of the soil which I have described; for
the sand, which covers or rather forms the beds on the surface,
lays On a calcareous rock, whose contexture is so porous; that
the water easily soaks through it."</p>
<p>On the 27th of June M. Bailly landed on the isle Rottnest,
where he made the following observations:</p>
<p>"On this shore we find a number of calcareous and sandy rocks,
of a greyish white, which are exclusively composed of the broken
remains of shells petrified. The hills which are nearest the
beach, are of the same nature, but covered by downs of calcareous
sand. Beyond these sand hills are pieces of water separated by
little elevations of sand; the water which they contain is as
salt as that of the sea. The tide is sensibly observed in these
ponds; the sand which forms the soil in the environs, is so soft,
that it is not unlikely that this alone may be the cause of the
phenomenon I have just mentioned, and indeed it is not easy to
account for it any other way, there being no direct communication
between these ponds and the sea. We found here two species of
small shells, the one univalve, the other bivalve, and of a tine
rose colour. The borders of most of these ponds were entirely
covered with these shells, which were the only living beings we
could discover on this island. The banks of these ponds were
steep, and appeared to have their origin to some great sinking of
the soil. Among them is a large rock standing alone, which, by
its form, its situation, and the horizontal disposition of the
neighbouring rock, evidently shews, that it formerly belonged to
a hill which occupied the place of this pond, and which formed a
continuation with the other hills, which cross the whole length
of the isle Rottnest. This assertion is supported on the exact
correspondence of the beds of this solitary rock, with the hills
that still remain. The soil is entirely calcareous, white, and
full of shells in good preservation, which are disposed as if in
families.</p>
<p>In the mean time the days fixed by captain Hamelin to wait for
the Geographer, were expired, and we had heard nothing of her;
nor did it now appear likely that we should obtain any news of
her by staying any longer on this coast: we therefore determined
to sail for Endracht's Land, leaving on the isle Rottnest, a
flag, and a bottle with a letter for the commander, in case he
should touch there.</p>
<p>On the 28th of June we set sail for the second rendezvous
which had been appointed. But before we pursue the history of our
voyage, we shall take a general view of the part of Edel's Land,
which we are now going to leave.</p>
<p>The isle Rottnest does not lie very high; the shore is
generally steep, and composed of grey, calcareous, and sandy
rocks, which have between them some creeks of very white sand.
This island is well wooded; the soil, though every where sandy,
seems to supply an abundant and healthy vegetation. The interior
aspect of the country, dissected by numerous hills, is very
beautiful. But the island does not appear to have any fresh
water, nevertheless in cases of necessity, a brackish water that
might be potable, might probably be procured by digging wells two
or three feet deep, at a small distance from the ponds of
Duvaldailly.</p>
<p>We here observed a small species of Kangaroo, about two feet
high, which were very numerous: we also saw another species of
quadruped, about the size of a large rat, which the Dutch
navigators supposed to be really a rat, but which, according to
the observations of our naturalist, M. Peron, belongs to a new
and remarkable species, the description of which will be found in
the zoologic part of the works of this deserving and industrious
naturalist. A great number of phoc&aelig; or sea-calves, appeared
on different parts of the shore. These animals were to be seen
sometimes in the interior of the forests, which lay at some
distance from the coast. We saw several of them that were very
large; these were generally grey; others were reddish; and some
of them were black. These last were smaller, and probably were
the youngest; for we had seen a female of an ashy grey, suckling
a young one which was itself black. The fat of these animals,
when it is fresh, is very good to eat; we often made use of it to
fry our fish, &amp;c. and never found it had any disagreeable
taste or smell. The furs of these animals are mostly fine and
thick, and would be a valuable commodity, as a rich cargo might
easily be procured.</p>
<p>Of reptiles there are numbers on isle Rottnest; we found
several that were four or five feet in length, and an inch and a
half or two inches thick; colour is like that of unpolished
steel. The isle Rottnest also produces an extraordinary species
of lizard, in which my friend M. Peron found a combination of
toes, which till then was totally unknown in any species of
lizard. The kind which I am now describing, had two on the fore
feet and three on the hind.</p>
<p>This island is uninhabited, and it did not appear that any of
the natives of the continent had ever found their way
thither.</p>
<p>The winds, during our stay in the roadstead, blew successively
from every quarter of the horizon. In general the east wind was
mild, and when it was in this quarter, the weather was always
fine; while the winds from the W. the S.W. and the N.W. on the
contrary always brought hail and rain.</p>
<p>We here caught plenty of excellent fish, but on some days we
could not catch one of any kind: I remarked that this generally
happened when the winds and waves were most calm. Probably the
fish at that time went farther out to sea, and did not return
till the roughness of the waves drove them where the water was
more shallow and the waves stiller.</p>
<p>We particularly observed, that there were always a great
number of sharks, that never left the ship for a moment, and most
of them were of an enormous size. We caught one which had the
mouth much more pointed than others; it was thirteen feet long
and ten in circumference, and weighed near 1300 pounds. We saw
some that were twice the size of this one, from which we may
naturally conclude, that no other part of the seas produce
animals of this kind that can be stronger or more formidable. We
also observed some sea-serpents about the ship, generally when
the water was still.</p>
<p>The isle Bertholet is entirely barren, and surrounded by rocks
and breakers, particularly on the south. There is on the N.E. a
small flat shore, on which a landing might be made.</p>
<p>The isle Buache had an aspect that nearly resembled that of
isle Rottnest, and is surrounded by shelves, which make it
difficult to find a landing; place, though a small sandy flat
shore was to be observed every here and there. The interior is
very woody; the trees are generally strait and lofty; there are
also several beautiful shrubs; vegetation also is here very
active, although the lands are generally covered with sand. I
here saw some partridges and ravens, of a smaller kind than those
of Europe, but of a delicate flavour: the phoc&aelig;, or
sea-calves, abound here more than on the isle Rottnest.</p>
<p>The river of Swans cannot be considered as proper to supply
the water necessary for a ship; in the first place, it is
difficult to enter, and its course is obstructed by many shoals
and sand banks; and secondly, the distance from the mouth up the
river, is too great before we can find any fresh water.</p>
<p>On leaving isle Rottnest we sailed towards the north,
intending to sail along shore at a little distance, if the wind
continued favourable; but the breeze having veered to the north,
we were under the necessity of making several tacks out to sea,
to keep off the land. After several attempts, however, we
contrived to keep near enough to distinguish the general
constitution of the soil; and on all this part of Edel's Land, we
saw the same melancholy appearance as that on the shores of
Leuwin's Land; but thus impeded by the contrary winds, and
pressed by the desire of rejoining the Geographer, we could not
give to this part of our geographical labours all the time which
it would have required; we therefore contented ourselves with
making such surveys of the coast, as were necessary to correct
the Dutch manuscript chart, which had been given us at the time
of our departure from Europe, and which, in many respects, we
discovered to be very erroneous.</p>
<p>On the 8th and 9th of July, we were in sight of the Isles of
Turtel-Duyf and the Abrolhos, on which Pelsar was wrecked in the
year 1629. We thought, according to our observations, that the
islands of the Abrolhos were, in the maps which had been given
us, placed too far out from the maim land; they did not appear to
us to be more than eight leagues distant. We had intended to sail
between them and the continent, to determine the distance which
lay between, with more accuracy; but the wind being contrary to
the course we must have steered in that case, we only ascertained
the situation of this formidable group of islands. At 10 or 12
leagues from the main land, the Abrolhos seemed to belong to it;
these isles have a barren appearance; they are but little
elevated, but are surrounded by a steep red coast, against which
the sea constantly breaks with great force; but these breakers do
not run out towards the sea so much as the Dutch maps indicate.
However, as the sea was calm at the time when we were in sight of
the Abrolhos, it is possible that the breakers on the west of
these isles did not appear to us to run out so far as they really
do.</p>
<p>On the 16th of July, we were a-head of the Thorny Passage,
which is on the south of the isle Dirck-Hartighs. We lengthened
the coast of this island at the distance of about two miles; it
is terminated by a long chain of red and steep breakers, which do
not run far out. At eight o'clock in the morning we found
ourselves in the strait formed by the isle Dirck-Hartighs, and
the isle Dorre; the soundings shewed a good sandy bottom, and
there we anchored.</p>

<p align="center"><i><b>Observations of the Naturalist on
Endracht's Land.</b></i><br>
<br>
<small>[<i>From the</i> 16<i>th of July to the</i> 21<i>st of
September,</i> 1801]</small></p>
<br>
<p>OUR first care, when we had anchored in the bay of Sea-dogs,
was to find if the Geographer was there moored, or whether she
had left on the neighbouring isles any indication of her passage.
The accounts brought by the boats which were sent to make this
investigation, gave us no satisfaction; and we were persuaded,
that she had not yet appeared on these shores. In such an
embarrassing situation, captain Hamelin thought it his duty to
consult and advise with his officers; consequently we were all
summoned. We now made an exact recapitulation of our voyage since
we kit Geography Bay, and concluded that it was not likely that
any accident had happened to our consort; that it was still more
improbable that the Geographer had returned towards the south.
From these considerations we concluded to wait here eight or ten
days, and then to continue our voyage, if in the mean time the
Geographer did not arrive. Captain Hamelin then gave us an
account of the particular instructions which he had received from
the commander: he had given the most positive order to wait for
him in the bay of Sea-dogs, till he should come there and join
us. According to these orders there was no room for deliberation;
and it was not without great mortification that we found
ourselves doomed to waste our time on these desolate shores, if
the Geographer should not at last come hither to meet us; which
the character of our commander made us think very probable.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic-5" id="pic-5"></a><img alt="" src=

<br>
<b><small>5. Map of the Bay of Sea-Dogs [Shark Bay,
W.A.]</small></b></p>
<p>Having formed this determination, captain Hamelin resolved at
last to sail to the farther part of the bay of Sea-dogs, for
greater shelter; but in the first place he sent three men on
shore on the isle Dirck-Hartighs, with orders to make signals to
the Geographer, if she should appear at the entrance of the
bay.</p>
<p>Our chief coxswain, on his return from the island of
Dirck-Hartighs, brought us a pewter plate, of about six inches
diameter, on which was roughly engraven two Dutch inscriptions;
the first dated the 25th of October, 1616, and the second dated
the 4th of February, 1697. This plate had been found on the
northern point of the island, which for this reason we named Cape
Inscription. When found, it was half covered with sand, near the
remains of a post of oak wood, to which it seemed to have been
originally nailed. The following is the translation of these two
inscriptions.</p>
<blockquote>"1616<br>
<br>
"On the 25th of October arrived here the ship Endraght,<br>
"of Amsterdam: first supercargo, Gilles Miebais Van<br>
"Luck; captain, Dirck-Hartighs, of Amsterdam. She<br>
"again set sail on the 27th of the same month. Bantum<br>
"was second supercargo; Janstins first pilot; Pieter Ecoores<br>
"Van Bu ... in the year 1616."<br>
<br>
"1697<br>
<br>
"On the 4th of February, 1697, arrived here the ship<br>
"Geelvinck, of Amsterdam, captain commander Wilhem de<br>
"Vlaming, of Vlielandt; assistant, Joannes Bremer, of<br>
"Copenhagen; first pilot, Michel Bloem Van-Estight, of<br>
"Bremen: The dogger vessel, the Nyptangh, captain Gerrit<br>
"Colaart, of Amsterdam; assistant, Theodorus Hiermans,<br>
"of the same place; first pilot, Gerrit Gerritzen, of<br>
"Bremen: The galliot Net Weseltje; commander, Cornelis de<br>
"Vlaming, of Vlielandt; pilot, Coert Gerritzen, of<br>
"Bremen. Departed from hence with our ships, and sailed<br>
"again from the southern shores, being bound to
Batavia."</blockquote>
<p>After having carefully copied these two inscriptions, captain
Hamelin had another post made, and erected on the spot, and
replaced the plate in the same place where it had been found.
Capt. Hamelin would have thought it sacrilege to carry away this
plate, which had been respected for near two centuries, by time,
and by all the navigators who might have visited these shores.
The captain also ordered to be placed on the N.E. of the island,
a second plate, on which was inscribed the name of our corvette,
and the date of our arrival on these shores.</p>
<p>On the second of August we departed from the isle
Dirck-Hartighs, and came to anchor near the island called the
Middle by Dampier. On the same day I received orders to set out
to determine the geography of part of the bay; that, is to say,
to explore the eastern coast of the isle Dirck-Hartighs from the
N.E. point, as far as, and including the southern part; then to
examine the southern and eastern lands of the bay; after which I
was to return to the north of the Isle Middle, where the
Naturalist was to wait for me at anchor. In the nautical and
geographical part of the voyage, I shall give all the particulars
of this passage: here I shall only present the chief heads.</p>
<p>During the whole day on the 2d, it was so calm that we could
not make much way. I lengthened the eastern coast of the island
Dirck-Hartighs, and doubled a small cape that was somewhat
remarkable, which, from its form, I named Looming Corner: I then
discovered a small bay and a little island, which I named the Bay
and Islot of the Tetrodons from the immense quantities of fish of
that species which we found there, and of which our seamen caught
a great number. Here we found such a quantity of whales, that I
was often obliged to turn out of my course, to avoid being run
down by these enormous fish; I also saw some tortoises, and many
small squales or sea-dogs. I passed the night on the south point
of the Bay of Tetrodons, which I named Point Refuge, for a reason
which will soon appear.</p>
<p>On the 4th I doubled Cape Ransonnet, which forms the southern
point of the isle Dirck-Hartighs, and completed the geography of
the Thorny Passage, so named by Dampier, from the dangerous
breakers which lay detached from the coast S.W. of the island. As
the night approached, I went into a small bay near Cape
Ransonnet, where I observed several holes about the size of a
man, and which I found to be so many burrows. It would be
difficult to conjecture by what kind of animal these were made,
the largest quadruped we had seen on this island being not quite
so large as a rabbit.</p>
<p>All the day of the 5th was lost in beating to windward; and I
was at length obliged to seek an asylum for the night on Cape
Refuge.</p>
<p>The contrary winds and bad weather continued all day on the
6th, and exposed me to great dangers among the shallows which are
at the mouth of the harbour, which I shall soon have occasion to
mention.</p>
<p>On the 7th, after sailing all day over a sand-bank, where
there was scarcely enough water to float my boat, in the evening
I landed opposite a small islot, which was not more than a
gun-shot distant from the beach. In the sand I observed several
traces of the footsteps of the savages, but however none of
inhabitants were now to be seen. Around several extinguished
fires we observed the remains of shells and fish, but not any
bones of quadrupeds; which made conjecture that they derive the
chief part of their food from the sea.</p>
<p>Not far from the islot I have just mentioned, we found a large
quantity of pearl oysters; and our seamen collected a great
number, in some of which they found pearls, but they were very
small.</p>
<p>On the 8th, just after we had set sail, and were about the
distance of two gun-shots from the shore, we observed one of the
natives, whom we had sought so long in vain on the preceding
evening: he looked at us with attention for some time, and then
returned with great indifference towards the interior of the
lands. We soon came to an opening, which I supposed might be the
mouth of a river: I made several attempts to go up it, but in
vain; a continued sand-bank closed the entrance, and prevented me
from convincing myself of the fact. This river, real or supposed,
con have no particular interest to navigators, from the
impossibility of landing there. It is pointed out in my map by
the name of the Supposed River.</p>
<p>After doubling a large cape, which, from the name of one of my
comrades, I called Cape Heirisson, I observed a creek of some
size, whose direction was nearly from north to south. On going up
this creek, we soon came into a very pretty small harbour, but
which unfortunately being closed in by a sand-bank on which there
is not more than three feet water, it can never admit a vessel of
any size. For this reason I named it Useless Harbour. The north
point of this harbour is formed by a large cape, which I have
described under the name of Cape Bellefin, from the name of the
worthy doctor of our corvette.</p>
<p>On the 10th, after reconnoitring Useless Harbour, I bore away
to the south, to continue my labour from the spot where I had
began my course on the 7th. I landed towards the evening on a
small barren and solitary islot, where we passed the night. We
found there a great number of sea-fowl, which, as soon as we had
set foot to ground, took flight, screaming aloud; they hovered
over our heads for some time, all the while making a great noise.
The appearance of this cloud of birds was singular enough; their
whiteness enabled us to distinguish them when they were high in
the air, notwithstanding the darkness of the night. We killed
several of them, and found great numbers of their eggs, but
neither one nor the other were good: the eggs, although quite
fresh, were scarcely eatable. At day-break I left this place,
which I called Islot Lefebvre, after our coxswain, who was an
excellent helmsman.</p>
<p>On the 11th I discovered another creek, towards which I in
vain endeavoured to direct my course, the wind being contrary: I
also observed ten or twelve islots which projected a-head of a
low barren sandy cape, which forms the south point of the large
creek which I have just mentioned, and which from the name of one
of my esteemed companions, I called Point Giraud. In traversing
the environs of the spot where we had landed, I perceived several
places where fires had been made, and I also observed the traces
of the footsteps of the natives; some of these prints had been
made by a very large foot: I measured one of them, which was 12
inches in length.</p>
<p>In the course of the day on the 11th, I steered towards the
mouth of the opening which I had observed on the preceding
evening; I named it Depuch Entrance, from one of our most
amiable, and most unfortunate shipmates. I also discovered some
small islots, in every respect similar to those we had seen on
the preceding days. I again thought I had discovered the mouth of
another river; but, as on the 8th, I found that a great sand-bank
shut up the passage. I then doubled Point Giraud, to get towards
the south: among many small islands, I observed two that were
larger than the others, and did not appear so sterile. I landed
towards the evening on the largest of these two islands, which I
named the Island with Three Bays, from its triangular form, and
from the three sides being each incurvated, and forming a small
sandy cove, where small vessels might in all weathers find safe
shelter. This little island is tolerably well wooded; and oysters
and fish may always be procured on the shore; it is about a mile
in extent.</p>
<p>On the 13th of August, after sailing about in every direction
through the whole of the great bay for several days, I began to
return towards the north: soon after I discovered more islots,
and a small island which I named Isle Leschenault, after one of
the botanists belonging to our expedition. It was not more than a
league in length, and seemed to be totally barren.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 14th, after sailing past a fine bay, I
doubled a point which was remarkable for two little islots which
projected out a-head: I named this Point Moreau, after one of our
young companions. All the rest of the day was spent in
reconnoitring the coast in sight; and I was convinced that what
we had till then called, according to Dampier, Middle Island, was
certainly a long peninsula. We soon came to Cape Lesueur: the
land in this spot turns short to the N.E., and I perceived our
corvette, the Naturalist, at anchor in a bay which we named
Dampier's Bay, from the celebrated navigator who first discovered
it. Meeting the ship in this manner, was an additional proof that
the land opposite was the same which till that time we had taken
for an island. I came on board in the evening, after an absence
of fifteen days, during which I had sailed about through more
than two-thirds of the vast cove, so improperly called the Bay of
Sea-dogs. The harbour which I had just reconnoitred runs about 30
leagues into the land: I named it H. Freycinet Harbour, in
compliment to my brother, lieutenant of marines on board the
Geographer; and the large peninsula which forms the eastern shore
of it, I named after my friend M. Peron.</p>
<p>During my absence from the ship, several events had happened,
of which I shall now give a succinct account.</p>
<p>On the 3d of August, captain Hamelin had moored to the north
about seven or eight miles distance from the peninsula Peron; the
next day a great smoke rising all at once above the neighbouring
lands, the captain sent Messrs. St. Cricq and Bailly to discover
the cause, who on their landing were attacked by about thirty
savages armed with long sagaies and clubs: these ferocious men
advanced, at the same time making a hideous noise, and prepared
to strike the first blow, when M. St. Cricq determined, though
very unwillingly, to fire a gun over their heads. An explosion of
this sort being quite new to them, occasioned such great surprise
and terror, that they altogether ran towards the shore, climbed
over the downs, and fled into the midst of the thickets. The
smoke that had been seen from the ship, proceeded from a large
fire which these savages had just made.</p>
<p>On the 6th of August, the observatory was established on the
neighbouring peninsula, and M. St. Cricq was appointed to
ascertain the movements of the chronometers; but the variations
of the temperature were so violent on shore, that he was in a few
days obliged to bring the watches again on board.</p>
<p>On the same day, the 6th of August, our chaloupe, which had
been only temporarily repaired when she was aground near isle
Rottnest, was now hauled on the sands to undergo a thorough
repair. All our carpenters and caulkers were employed in this
work. There were also sent a sufficient number of seamen to cut
wood, and collect together as much as we wanted for every
purpose. By this means, we had a small camp of about thirty
persons. As it was necessary to provide them with water, and a
perpetual trouble to bring it them from on board, we had our
alembic on shore to distil the sea water. "I was charged", says
M. Bailly, "with this duty, and notwithstanding some defects in
the construction of the apparatus, succeeded in procuring about
forty quarts a day, which was more than sufficient for the thirty
persons onshore. The sea water thus distilled is not
disagreeable; it has merely a smoky taste, which it would be
easily got rid of, by exposing it to the air; it appeared to us
besides to be preferable to the bad water so often used on board
ships."</p>
<p>The advantage which resulted to us from the use of alembics,
sufficiently shows how very valuable that chemical apparatus must
be in the Navy, and which indeed ought to be regarded as
indispensable in voyages where they may have to explore a dry
coast destitute of soft water, like that of New Holland; and in
case of shipwreck this apparatus would be the means of saving
many hundred lives.</p>
<p>The 22d of August Messrs. Faure and Moreau were dispatched in
the barge to pursue the exploration of the neighbouring coast
near our anchorage: they were to begin their researches at the
spot where I had terminated mine; that is to say, at the point
named by M. De St. Allouarn, High Land Point, following
afterwards the eastern coast of the peninsula Peron. They were to
return on board after having lengthened the coast until they came
abreast of the point of which I have just spoken. This expedition
returned the 31st inst., and we then learnt from our friends,
that to the south of High Land Point, they had discovered a
little bay, since named the Bay of Attack: a larger point, which
terminates it towards the south, was called Point Guichenault,
from the name of one of the two companions of M. Peron in the
hardships he experienced, and of which this account will give the
details. Farther on, and always advancing towards the south, the
party found a second bay, which we called L'Haridon Bay. The
southern point of this bay received the name of M. Petit, one of
our unfortunate comrades. In the east part of Cape Petit Messrs.
Faure and Moreau discovered a tolerably large island, the western
coast of which they contented themselves with visiting. This
island we since named Isle Faure, from that geographer, who first
saw it from the ship, and drew the plan. From hence continuing to
go southward, Messrs. Faure and Moreau sounded the bottom of a
large harbour, which is only separated from that of which I have
already spoken, by an isthmus, which we called Isthmus Taillefer,
from the second doctor of the corvette Geographer.</p>
<p>In going up afterwards towards the north, the party met with
some large sand-banks, which at this season of the year they
found covered with turtles, and which, for that reason, I have
described in my general chart under the name of Turtle Bank.
Invited by the facility with which they could be taken, our party
landed on the Isle Faure, and procured in less than three hours
fifteen turtles, some of which weighed from 122 to 147
kilogrammes; that is, from 250 to 300 pounds; and thus laden with
this precious cargo, they effected their return on board. The
large harbour which they had discovered, was unanimously
dedicated to captain Hamelin. This harbour is not so deep, but is
much larger than the one to the westward.</p>
<p>Our provisions were now nearly expended, and we had not as yet
any news of the Geographer. The captain had done every thing that
was possible to effect a junction with that ship; he had not
neglected to pursue that rigorous discipline prescribed to him by
the orders of government and of his commander. There remained no
hope of his falling in with the Geographer but at the place from
which they set out. He determined therefore to, return thither
without further delay.</p>
<p>After this determination, we got under way the 4th of
September for Timor, after having passed forty-nine days in the
Bay of Sea-dogs, or rather what we took to be a bay, and of which
it remains to us to give a general description.</p>
<p>After Dirck-Hartighs and Vlaming, the first European who
visited the Bay of Sea-dogs, was Capt. Dampier, who in the time
he lived, was a skilful navigator. It was to him that Europe owed
its first and only correct notions of these countries, until the
epoch of our expedition. Dampier anchored to the north of the
peninsula Peron, which he himself mistook for an island, and gave
the name of Shark's Bay (or Bay of Sea-dogs) to all that space
comprized between the isles westward and the continent, without
having discovered the form or breadth. Can it be wondered at,
that after Dampier, in general so exact in all his labours,
should have given the name of a bay to a heap of gulfs, harbours,
and coves, which have only the general appearance of what is
understood by that denomination, we should preserve it, however
improper it may be, to the end of avoiding the risk, always
serious, of alterations in nautical nomenclature?</p>
<p>St. Allouarn, with the flute Le Gros Ventre, visited these
shores in the year 1772, and made himself acquainted with the
land to the north of the peninsula; gave the name of High Land
Point to the cape farthest north of this peninsula; and took his
departure, without having done any thing towards settling the
geography of that interesting portion of Endracht's Land.</p>
<p>It results from our labours, that we have nearly ascertained
that the supposed Bay of Sea-dogs forms a great bight of about
fifty leagues in depth, taking it from Cape Cuvier towards the
north, unto the southern extremity of the gulf Freycinet; that
all the eastern coast is exclusively formed by the continent;
that the western is composed of the islot of Koks, of the isle of
Done, of the isle Bernier, of Dampier's Reef, of the great island
Dirck-Hartighs, and of a part of the continental shore. All the
middle part of this opening is occupied by the grand continental
peninsula, to the east and to the west of which are the harbours
of Hamelin and Freycinet.</p>
<p>I shall not chuse to present again to the reader in this
place, the miserable picture of the sterility of these shores.
All the details of that exhibition have been given with as much
preciseness as interest, in the Sixth Chapter of that relation.
It will suffice to observe, that all that M. Peron could say of
the physical constitution, and of the different productions of
the isle Bernier, is strictly applicable to the neighbouring
parts of that continent, and to the isles. Every where calcareous
rocks support layers of sand, more or less elevated; every where
the same scarcity of soft water, the same dryness, the same
defect of vegetation, the same failure of produce. The animal
productions of the sea are the same, and those of the land
present no shade of difference, except in the species of
kangaroo, which are larger on the continent than in the islands,
and is in them also more rare: indeed, the last possesses
exclusively the breed of dogs, and the human species is peculiar
to it. Weak and thinly scattered, the inhabitants present in
themselves the same natural and social character, and of which we
shall have occasion to take notice elsewhere.</p>
<p>Considering the matter as a navigator, this part of Endracht's
Land presents a good anchorage in the Bay of Dampier. It could
also furnish wood, and a valuable supply of food from the
turtles. And with respect to what concerns commercial interests,
the number of prodigious whales seen there, seem to promise any
speculation would be attended with success, which had for its
object a fishery of those animals, while the use of alembics
would furnish water sufficient for the consumption of the people
employed. The fish and the turtle would afford them also an
abundant and healthy nourishment, and the pearls might perhaps,
with a little industry in seeking for them, abundantly recompense
those who would engage in the enterprise.</p>
<p>I have said before, that the 4th of September we set sail from
the Bay of Sea-dogs for Timor. The same day at two o'clock we
were in the middle of the passage of the Naturalist, and in the
evening we lost sight of the isles Dorre and Bernier.</p>
<p>The 15th September we perceived at a great distance the isle
of the New Sabot (Sawii) to the south; it bore N.N.E. three miles
and an half. The 16th, at day-break, we made the Great Sabou
(Sawii), and steered to pass between that and the little island
Benzoard. At nine o'clock in the morning we were in the strait
which separates the two islands. The southern part of the Great
Sabou is very high: its mountains, which become lower towards the
sea-shore, are covered with habitations and beautiful forests,
from the midst of which present themselves a prodigious quantity
of cocoa and palm trees. A great number of these trees are to be
seen close to the beach; their roots are watered by the waves. We
coasted this shore near enough to distinguish several natives who
walked along the beach. It is about six leagues in depth. The
coast N.W. is still higher, and appeared to us still more fertile
and pleasant.</p>
<p>The island of Benzoard, opposite to the Great Sabou, is only
five leagues in length in its greatest dimension; it is lofty,
well wooded, and inhabited.</p>
<p>On the 20th of September at day-break, we had sight of the
Isle of Sim&acirc;o (Semawii) to the east of us, and beyond which
we discovered at a great distance, the lofty mountains of the
island of Timor. In the evening, at sunset, we perceived also the
islands of Tico and Rotti (Rotte).</p>
<p>The lands of Sim&acirc;o, although high, are less so than the
lands of Great Sabou. This island is woody, and intersected by
chains of mountains in different directions. The soil of the
southern parts is of a strong reddish hue.</p>
<p>Rotti is also elevated. The small isle of Tico is low, but
well wooded: it appears to be surrounded by a fine flat sandy
shore.</p>
<p>Generally, these lands, in form and in the healthy appearance
of the vegetation with which they are covered, present the most
striking contrast to the low, sterile and desert appearance of
the shores of New Holland.</p>
<p>On the 21st of September we sailed to the north of Rotti, to
gain the roadstead of Coupang. At a quarter past six we were near
enough to observe a three-masted vessel at anchor in the harbour.
At half past seven I was sent with the long-boat to inform the
governor for what purpose we touched at Coupang. I was already at
some distance from the ship, when I saw coming from the shore a
boat with the French flag; it was commanded by my brother. I then
learnt that the Geographer had been at Coupang more than a month,
and that from the moment of our separation in Geography Bay, they
had suffered the greatest anxiety on our account. At length, at
one o'clock in the afternoon, we anchored near our consort. Thus,
by chance, met once more two ships, which, destined to act always
in concert with each other, would never have suffered so long and
distressing a separation, but for the false calculations and
mismanagement of the commander appointed to direct their general
co-operations.</p>

Diemen's Land.</b></i> [Tasmania]<br>
<br>
<small>[<i>From November</i> 13<i>th,</i> 1801, <i>to January</i>
13<i>th,</i> 1802.]</small></p>
<br>
<p>WE have seen in the Fifth Chapter of this work, that, from the
very commencement of the voyage, our commander had disturbed the
whole of the general plan of operations which had been traced out
by government: that instead of doubling the Cape South, he had
reconnoitred Cape Leuwin, and that all the time of his first
cruize had been spent on the N.W. coast of New Holland:
circumstances, and the season, recalled us therefore to the
southern extremity of Diemen's Land, and to that point we
directed our course on leaving Timor. Long opposed by the calms
and winds, we had much difficulty in doubling Cape Leuwin: we
however succeeded in the beginning of January: at the same time
we met with the strong winds from the W.N.W. which drove us
rapidly on the southern shores of Diemen's Land; and on the 13th
of January, we first had sight of the foggy lands of this large
island.</p>
<p>In the succinct account I am about to give of the principal
events of this toilsome voyage, I have thought it my duty
particularly to mention and describe the sea animals which fell
under our observation, as their description furnishes particulars
equally valuable to the naturalist and the navigator. For the
particular latitudes in which these animals constantly abound,
may often furnish the navigator with useful knowledge on the
distances from such or such lands. The immortal Cook always
esteemed observations of this greatly interesting, and M. de
Fleurieu, in his valuable Appendix to the Voyage of Marchand,
enlarged on this subject in a manner which proved the particular
consequence he attached to it. This part of his work; which may
be considered as a summary of pelagious zoology, is certainly the
best guide of the kind that can be chosen by. the enlightened
navigator, or even the naturalist himself.</p>
<p>On the 14th of November the sky was thick, the barometer was
scarcely so high as 28<sup><small>i</small></sup>
1<sup><small>l</small></sup>; the thermometer was at 23 5; the
hygrometer pointed to 97&deg; of humidity. Our numerous sick
suffered much from this warm and moist temperature: and on this
same day, died on board the Naturalist, Savary, the boatswain's
mate.</p>
<p>On the 15th, we ourselves lost the unfortunate Sautier, our
horticulturist's first assistant; an active and industrious
man.</p>
<p>On the same day, we saw a water-spout at a distance: on the
16th, in the evening, we saw a second water-spout, and in the
night we ran past Great Sabou.</p>
<p>On the 17th, in the morning, we were off the Isle Benzoard,
and soon after we passed it, we discovered New Sabou. It rises
but little above the waves which break against its shores; its
surface has every where a chearful appearance, and seems covered
with verdure; here and there may be distinguished clumps of
beautiful shrubs. This small island is uninhabited, and is
particularly remarkable for an enormous rock, which stands near
one point of the isle, and which at a distance seems as if
pierced with a large hole.</p>
<p>The unhealthy temperature of the preceding days continuing,
our sick people became worse, and about eight o'clock in the
evening we lost Francois Courroyer, one of the strongest men of
our crew, and one of our best helmsmen.</p>
<p>At this period our ships were surrounded by great flocks of
the birds called boobies, which seemed to come from the adjacent
islands. From this time to the 30th of November, these birds
constantly attended us; they must therefore, with us, have ranged
the whole of the sea between the tenth and fifteenth degree of
south latitude, which must be about 125 leagues distant from the
shores. This observation confirms, certainly, the remarks of
Lafeuill&eacute;e, Cook, and Forster, on the uncertainty of the
indication of the nearness of the lands, deduced from meeting
with birds of this description: it is, however, certain, that we
never in open sea observed any of these birds flying in flocks,
and the passage of which I am speaking is a proof it. In fact,
after having passed the islands of Sabou, we kept at a great
distance from any land, and we saw no more of these sea-fowl till
we again drew near Diemen's Land, when legions of them appeared
in sight, almost immediately after we perceived the lofty
mountains of that great island; we may look on the appearance of
these birds, with few exceptions, as a general and probable
indication of being near to some land; and this, to the navigator
particularly, who sails in the midst of unknown seas, is an
indication of some value. This species of booby being new, I have
described it under the name of <i>Sula Sabuensis</i> (the booby
of the Sabou isles).</p>
<p>On the 18th of November, Marie Hubert, gunner, died on board
the Naturalist.</p>
<p>On the 19th we ourselves committed to the sea one of our best
seamen, whose name was Pougens. Al this period we were so much
oppressed by the heat, and our allowance of water was so short,
that some of our unhappy men were seen to drink their own urine!
Every remonstrance of our doctor, to increase our allowance of
water for the present, and to diminish it the more when in cooler
latitudes, was in vain. It is with great regret that I have to
mention these particulars, but in voyages of this description,
misfortune itself gives a lesson that should not be lost: the
most celebrated navigators, at the head of whom must be placed
Cook, La Perouse, and Vancouver, were of decided opinion, that
the want of water was the chief cause of the scurvy in long
voyages; and as we were soon after this period afflicted to a
great degree with this terrible distemper, can I justly
dissemble, or pass over in silence, a circumstance so
particularly connected with this afflicting epidemic?</p>
<p>On the 20th of November, we found on the surface of the sea a
great number of those physalis which I described in the Third
Chapter of this work. This kind seemed to me to differ from that
of the Atlantic Ocean: I described it by the name of Physalia
Australis, and I made many observations on the organization of
these extraordinary animals, all the particulars of which will be
given in the zoological part of our work.</p>
<p>On the 22d of November another of our unfortunate gunners,
named Mentelle, died. Consternation now reigned on board:
twenty-five men lay sick, and among them were Messrs. Depuch and
Maug&eacute;: happily, as we got more to the south, the heat
became less oppressive, and the health of our sick seemed to
amend as the thermometer sunk.</p>
<p>On the 24th we saw for the first time some sea-gulls
(<i>Procellaria Pelagica</i>, Lin.) We were now in the fourteenth
degree of south latitude; on the 7th of December, in the
seventeenth, and on the 1st of January, in the thirty-fourth, we
again saw some of these birds, which are rarely seen in this
latitude.</p>
<p>Or the 25th of November we caught a shark about ten feet in
length, which gave us an extraordinary proof of the prodigious
irritability of these fish, after the head was cut Off, and the
heart and entrails taken out and thrown into the sea, and we were
dragging it forward to wash it at the pump. The animal, while we
drew it along by the tail, made vies. lent motions, and raised
its body with such strength and quickness, that several persons
had nearly been thrown down. In our passage from Europe to the
Isle of France, I had before seen, in an animal of the same kind,
this irritability remain for a still longer time. For above two
hours the shark had been gutted and the head taken off, when a
sailor came to cut off the tail; but the knife had not penetrated
the flesh more than half an inch, when the fish contracted itself
violently and leaped several times on the deck, and this
irritability continued till the tail was entirely taken off with
an hatchet.</p>
<p>On the 26th, in the evening, on speaking with the Naturalist,
we learnt that they were not more fortunate than ourselves with
respect to the sick on board; that independent of those we have
already mentioned to have died, they had since lost Bourgeois, of
the city of Havre, a young man of distinguished education and
amiable qualities: this day they committed to the deep a seaman
named Yves, and captain Hamelin informed us that he had still
eighteen on the sick list. M. Levillain was among these, and
every day became worse. In return for this sad news, we gave them
the melancholy account of our own losses, and our two ships
parted to continue a voyage under these very sad auspices.</p>
<p>On the 27th we saw numerous companies of flying fish: we again
saw some on the 30th of November, the 1st and 2d of December, in
the latitudes from 14&deg; to 19&deg;.</p>
<p>On the 2d of December, in 15&deg;, we observed the first bird
of Paradise (<i>Ph&aelig;ton &AElig;thereus</i>, Lin.), the most
beautiful of equatorial sea-birds: on the 22d we saw more of
them, and on this day we passed the tropic of Capricorn. Thus
these observations agree with what is so elegantly said by
Buffon, on the limits of the climates in which these beautiful
birds are seen: "Following the chariot of the sun in the burning
zone between the tropics, ranging continually beneath that ardent
sky, without ever exceeding the extreme boundaries of the rout of
the mighty star of heaven, it announces to the navigator his
approaching passage under the celestial signs."</p>
<p>On the 11th of December we found ourselves in 21&deg; south
latitude, and 101&deg; east longitude from the meridian of Paris.
Here we saw a <i>Procellaria Capensis</i>, the most beautiful of
antarctic sea-fowl, the description of which is so often repeated
in the relations of ancient and modern travellers.</p>
<p>On the 13th of December we saw more of these beautiful birds,
and as on the same day we saw some phaetons, it follows that, we
might have seen at the same time, and in the same place, two
animals, one of which, the exclusive inhabitant of the antarctic
seas, delights in cold, in fogs, and storms; whilst the other,
following, according to Buffon, the chariot of the sun, enjoys
the calm of the tropics and their ardent temperature. From these
observations, and from those of Cook, who in his second voyage
found the former of these birds on this side of the 30th degree,
it follows that the limits fixed by Linn&aelig;us for the resort
of these animals, ought to be nearer the equinoxial parts of the
globe than those of 40&deg;, beyond which the celebrated Swede
has thought fit to confine them. We also saw numbers of than the
whole length of Leuwin's Land, and even in Geography Bay, in
33&deg; of latitude.</p>
<p>On the 12th of December we passed the tropic of Capricorn for
the fifth time, to get into the temperate southern regions. The
temperature was already not above 17&deg;; the barometer from
28.1, had risen progressively to 28.3. On this day we lost our
master sail-maker, a very respectable man, and who was much
esteemed by our officers and crew.</p>
<p>On the 25th we saw some grey petrels (<i>Procellaria
grisea</i>, Lin.): on the 29th, the 30th, and 31st, we saw more
of them, in latitude from 32&deg; to 33&deg; south. It is here
that Linn&aelig;us says they are first to be seen: Cook, however,
in his first voyage saw none of them till he was in 50&deg; south
latitude.</p>
<p>On the 29th of December the sea appeared covered with
Janthines, the most beautiful of the testaceous mollusques this
jelly-fish, by means of a bunch of small vesicles filled with
air, floats on the surface of the waters, as we have before
remarked in the Third Chapter of this work.</p>
<p>On this shining shell I discovered a new kind of crustaceous
animal, of a beautiful ultramarine blue, like the shell. I knew
this to be a Pinnothera, and I have described it under the name
of <i>Pinnothera Janthin&aelig;</i>. This discovery is so much
the more interesting, as it does not appear that any of these
adhesive animals were ever found before in univalve shells.</p>
<p>On the same day, the 29th of December, died my colleague, M.
Levillain. To the cruel dysentery with which he had been
afflicted ever since our departure from Timor, was added a
dangerous diaphoretic fever (<i>V. diaphoretica de Torti</i>),
the fourth fit of which deprived him of life. His body was
committed to the ocean, which by an unfortunate fatality, had
already been the grave of his father and eldest brother. This
death was deeply lamented by all on, board our two ships: M.
Levillain was of a mild and amiable disposition, which had made
him beloved by all who knew him. During his stay in Dampier's
Bay, he had made a fine collection of shells and petrifactions,
which form long banks on these shores, and which are so much the
more interesting, as most of them seem to have their living
resemblances at the feet of the same rocks which are composed of
these petrified shells.</p>
<p>On the 3d of January 1801, the gentle winds and dead calms
were succeeded by a strong gale from the W.N.W.; the barometer
sunk rapidly from 28.3 to 27.10: the sky was covered with thick
black clouds, and in the night we had a violent storm of rain. On
the next day, the 4th of January, the winds continued to blow in
impetuous squalls; the sea rose horribly, and we pitched much:
but the rapidity with which we sailed reconciled us to these
hardships, so unavoidable in weather such as we now experienced.
In the midst of these raging waves we saw swimming two monstrous
whales, which passed very near the ship: I was not able to
distinguish of what particular kind they were, because they only
appeared at times on the surface of the sea, and then as quickly
disappeared, leaving a great swell behind them.</p>
<p class="poem"><small>"Assurgunt longo properantes agmine
fluctus,<br>
Miscenturque vadis imis."<br>
                  STAT.</small></p>
<p>On the 5th we were in 37&deg; latitude and 117&deg; east
longitude. Here disappeared the great equinoxial petrel
(<i>Procellaria equinoxialis</i>, Lin.); we had first seen it on
the 11th of December, in about 21&deg; latitude, and since that
time it had been constantly seen flying round our ships. It
consequently follows, that we have seen this beautiful bird in an
extent of more than 19&deg; on the limits of the southern
equinoxial regions, and in most part of the temperate regions of
this part of the globe; and if we add to these observations of
out own, the authority of Edwards, Brown, and Linn&aelig;us, who
all extend the limas where the petrel is seen, as far as the Cape
of Good Hope, and even to New Zealand, it must doubtless be
allowed, that it would have been difficult to give to this
species a name less applicable than that of equinoxial, which
seems to apply exclusively to an inhabitant of equatorial
countries.</p>
<p>On the 6th and 7th of January, the stormy weather of the
preceding days continued; and on the last of them we found
ourselves in 39&deg; latitude and 120 east longitude; the
thermometer was not at more than 10&deg;, and the cold made us
take to our winter clothing.</p>
<p>We now first saw the species of albatross, described by
Forster under the name of the chocolate-coloured albatross
(<i>Diomedea spadicea</i>). We had seen since the 4th, in 35&deg;
latitude, the common albatross (<i>Diomedea exulans</i>, Lin.),
the largest of antarctic sea-fowl; and we had observed the two
varieties of white and brown, which probably ought to make them
be considered as two distinct kinds, as I shall endeavour to
prove in another place. Some of those we saw, when the wings were
extended, were above ten feet from the point of one to the point
of the other. The chocolate-coloured albatross appeared to me, as
to Forster, to be less than the exulans. As far as the shores of
Diemen's Land these birds followed our vessels, and their number
seemed to increase as we drew nearer the cold foggy climates, in
which, they more particularly abounded.</p>
<p>The 9th presented to my observation several interesting
animals, first those large brown go&euml;lands (<i>Larus
cataractes</i>, Lin.), which the seamen call shoe-makers, Port
Egmont fowls, &amp;c. Cook saw great numbers of them as far as
the middle of the frozen regions in the 64th degree of south
latitude. These go&euml;lands are, next to the albatrosses, the
most powerful sea-fowl of the antarctic extremity of the
globe.</p>
<p>The other flights of birds which we saw in the course of the
day on the 9th, all belonged to the genus of sea-swallows
(<i>Sterna</i>). I distinguished three kinds, the first seemed to
be the <i>Sterna obscura</i>, Lin.; the second was new. I have
described it under the title of <i>Sterna melanosoma</i>, from
the black colour of the body; the third was also unknown to
naturalists, and from its similarity to the <i>Sterna Caspia</i>,
Lin., I gave it the name of <i>Sterna Caspio&iuml;des</i>. On
this same day we perceived in the waters, at a small distance
from the ship, an enormous species of sepia, which had a great
similarity to the genus of the calmar, or cuttle fish
(<i>Loligo</i>, Lamarck), as big as a ton: it rolled with great
noise in the midst of the waves, extending its long arms on the
surface of the waters, moving them, that they appeared like so
many enormous reptiles: each of the arms were six or seven feet
in length, and seven or eight inches in breadth. Doubtless it is
some animal of this kind that Don Pernetty describes as having
such prodigious dimensions, and being of such an amazing weight,
that according to him, it is able to obstruct the working of a
ship, and by climbing up the cordage, to drag it to destruction
and cause it to founder. This is doubtless an idle tale, and a
ridiculous exaggeration, but probably it may be founded on the
appearance of some such monstrous animal.</p>
<p>On the 10th of January the stormy weather still continued. I
discovered a new species of sea-gull, which I have described by
the name of <i>Larus melanopterus</i>, from its black wings. On
the same day, for the first time, we saw eating on the surface of
the waves some quantities of the <i>Fucus gigantinus</i>. It is
not without reason that this vegetable bears this specific name,
for I have seen some stalks or branches of it, that were 200 or
300 feet in length; and in the course of this work, we shall shew
by what means nature raises these long branches from the bottom
of the seas, and how they are thus made to float on the surface
of the waves.</p>
<p>On the 11th, I described under the title of the dolphin with a
black muzzle (<i>Delphinus leucoramphus</i>), a new species of
dolphin, which M. de Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de has, in his History
of Cetaceous Animals, called by my name (<i>Delphinus
Peronii</i>). The remarkable disposition of all animals to become
white the nearer their habitations are to the high latitudes, is
an extraordinary phenomenon. Thus in the same northern regions
which produce white foxes, white bears, &amp;c. there is also a
kind of white dolphin (<i>Delphinas leucas</i>, Lin.): and in the
high southern latitudes, besides the <i>Delphinus
leucoramphus</i>, which I have just mentioned, there is a second
species of the same genus, which was first observed by Commerson,
and afterwards by Forster, the body of which was totally white,
with the exception of a few bluish-brown spots.</p>
<p>On the 12th of January we reckoned ourselves to be in 44&deg;
of south latitude, and 141&deg; 27' east longitude, and
consequently we were not far from the cape S.W. of Diemen's Land.
In the course of the night there was ranch hail and rain: on the
next day, early in the morning, after a voyage of sixty-one days,
we first discovered the shores of this large island.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-18" id="ch-18"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>
<p align="center"><i><b>Southern Part of Diemen's
Land.</b></i><br>
<br>
<small>[<i>From</i> 13<i>th January to the</i> 17<i>th of
February,</i> 1802]</small></p>
<br>
<p>ON the 13th of January, at day-break, we first had sight of
land, which then appeared to bear from N.N.E. to E.N.E. At, eight
o'clock we were off the cape S.W., and soon came in sight of the
small isles of Witt, and the solitary rock Mewstone. From eight
o'clock till noon, we rapidly lengthened all the southern
extremity of Diemen's Land, and at twelve we doubled the south
cape, the last point of the globe in the eastern hemisphere. The
rocks of Scilly, and the Eddystone, were at this time to the
south, and almost out of sight.</p>
<p>Every eye was now fixed on the land: we admired those lofty
mountains, which nature has placed like so many ramparts of
granite to oppose the rage of the stormy sea: these mountains
extend as far as the frozen antarctic pole. We observed with
admiration those large plains in the inter of of the island,
which rise in amphitheatres over the whole surface, and are
covered with immense forests. The sea all this time was stormy
and rough; the winds blew violently and in squalls from the S.W.;
the temperature was cold; the sky thick; and long clouds of
vapour gathered round the grey sides of the woods and mountains.
This fog was succeeded by heavy rains, hail, and boar frost:
innumerable flights of boobies, go&euml;lands, cormorants,
swallows, &amp;c. flew from the neighbouring rocks and encircled
our ships, mingling their piercing cries with the noise of the
angry waves; along rank of white muzzled dolphins, with several
large whales, played around us; in a word, every thing seemed to
unite in giving a sort of solemnity to our arrival off these
shores, and all proclaimed that we touched the extreme boundaries
of the southern world.</p>
<p>At half past twelve o'clock we had sight of the Boriel Isles,
which form the most southern point of Storm Bay. Our commander
made signal to captain Hamelin to make sail, and enter the
channel of Dentrecasteaux. This manoeuvre was scarcely performed,
when we perceived a large bank of rocks, which forced the
Naturalist to haul the wind on the starboard tack, to get more
sea-room, and we followed their example. During this time the
rain and sleet continued; the squalls became more violent, and we
were obliged to take in most of our sails; but at length we
succeeded in doubling the ridge of rocks which lay out a-head of
those sterile isles; then directing our course towards Cape
Bruny, we ran through the channel, keeping near Point
Labillardi&egrave;re. At half past four o'clock we had moored in
the great cove in twenty-three fathoms, oozy bottom to the east,
and one mile only from Partridge Island.</p>
<p>Of all the modern discoveries made on Diemen's Land, that of
the channel of Dentrecasteaux is doubtless the most singular and
the most important. After successively escaping Tasman, Furneaux,
Cook, Marion, Cox, Hunter, and Bligh, the French admiral himself
only discovered it by a mistake, which, though it proved
fortunate, might have been fatal.</p>
<p>In the general description which in another place I shall give
of Diemen's Land, I shall more particularly enlarge on the
channel of Dentrecasteaux: at present it shall suffice to mention
the particulars of our stay, and our operations on this spot.</p>
<p>The chief end of our touching at this extreme point of
Diemen's Land, was to take in fresh water: our commander hastened
to send several boats to different parts to seek a watering
place. M. H. Freycinet received orders to go on the morning of
the 14th to the mouth of the river Huon and the port of Swans: M.
Lesueur and myself accompanied him.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock we passed the small isle nearest the mouth of
the port: the whole surface, covered with verdure, trees, and
shrubs, made this spot appear like a beautiful grove. At half
past nine we came to the port of Swans: of all the places which I
had seen during the whole course of our long voyage, this
appeared to me to be the most picturesque and pleasant. Seven
ranges of mountains rise as by degrees too wards the interior of
Diemen's Land, and form the perspective of the interior of the
port: to the right and left, the rising hills enclosed it on
every direction, and presented as we sailed along, a number of
small well rounded capes and romantic little creeks. In every
direction the most active vegetation spewed its various
productions: the shores are covered with lofty trees, always
green, and growing so close together, that it is almost
impossible to penetrate the forests. Innumerable flights of
parrots, cockatoos, &amp;c. with the most varied and beautiful
plumage, inhabited their lofty branches; and the tom-tit, with a
beautiful ultramarine blue ring round its neck, played in the
shade of the boughs.</p>
<p>The sea near this spot was extremely calm, and its surface
covered with innumerable legions of black swans, which sailed
about with great elegance and majesty.</p>
<p>While we were occupied in the pleasing contemplation of this
picture, we were disturbed by some cries which we heard on the
right shore of the port, whither directing our eyes, we perceived
two savages who ran towards the beach, both of them shewing the
most extraordinary gestures of surprise and admiration. One of
them carried in his hand a kind of torch of lighted bark. We
answered them by some shouts, and endeavoured to approach the
shore, but instead of wait in for us, they ran into the forest
and disappeared.</p>
<p>In pursuing our course we came to a small creek, at the bottom
of which is a beautiful valley, that seemed to promise a stream
of fresh water: this consideration determined M. H. Freycinet to
land there. We had scarcely set foot on shore before two natives
appeared on the top of a hill: at the signs of amity which we
made, one of them seemed rather to spring from the top of the
rock than to descend from it, and in the twinkling of an eye was
in the midst of us. He was a young man of from twenty-two to
twenty-four years a age, of a strong general appearance, having
no other defect than the looseness of the joints of his arms and
legs, characteristic of his nation, and of which we shall take
occasion to speak in the conclusion of our work. His physiognomy
had nothing fierce or austere, his eyes were lively and
expressive, and his manner displayed at once both pleasure and
surprize. M. Freycinet having embraced him, I followed his
example, but the air of indifference with which he received this
testimony of good will and friendship, made us easily perceive
that to him it had no meaning. What appeared at first to interest
him most, was the whiteness of our skin, and doubtless, wishing
to ascertain whether the rest of our bodies was of the same
colour, he successively crud our jackets and shirts, and
expressed his astonishment by loud exclamations of surprize, and
by very quick motions of his feet.</p>
<p>Moreover, our chaloupe seemed to attract his attention still
more than our persons, and after examining us some minutes, he
jumped into the boat: there, without troubling himself with, or
even noticing the seamen who were in her, he seemed quite
absorbed in his new subject. The thickness of the ribs and
planks, the strength of the construction, the rudder, the oars,
the masts, the sails, he observed in silence, and with great
attention, and with the most unequivocal signs of interest and
reflection. At this moment, one of the men an the boat, willing
to add to his astonishment, presented him a glass bottle filled
with arrack, which made part of the allowance of the crew. The
shining of the glass at first made the savage utter a cry of
astonishment; he took the bottle and examined it a few moments,
but his curiosity soon returned to the chaloupe; he threw the
bottle into the sea, seemingly without any other intention than
to rid himself, of an object that was perfectly indifferent to
him, and immediately returned to his examination of the boat.
Neither the exclamation of the seaman, who was vexed at the loss
of his bottle of arrack, nor the haste with which one of his
comrades threw himself into the water to fish it up again, seemed
to give him any concern: he made several attempts to push off the
chaloupe, but the small hawser which fastened it, made his
efforts of no avail, he was therefore obliged to give up the
attempt and to return to us, after giving us the most striking
demonstrations of attention and reflection which we had ever seen
among savage nations.</p>
<p>When we came to the top of the hill we have before mentioned,
M. Freycinet and myself met with the second native; this was an
old man of above fifty years of age; his beard was partly grey,
as was also his hair; his countenance as well as that of the
young man, was frank and open; notwithstanding some unequivocal
signs of fear and disquiet, it was easy to discover kindness and
candour. This old man, after having examined both of us with as
much surprize and satisfaction as the first native; after having
determined, like him, the colour of our necks, by drawing aside
our jackets and shirts, made a signal to two women a little way
off, to approach: if they hesitated for some instants, when the
oldest of them came to us; the youngest followed, more timid and
disturbed than the first, who appeared to be about forty years of
age; and large furrows on the skin of her belly shewed beyond
contradiction, that she had been the mother of many children. She
was entirely naked, and appeared, like the old man, kind and
friendly. The young woman was about twenty-eight years of age,
and was of a robust make, like the other: she was also entirely
naked, with the exception of the skin of a kangaroo, wherein she
carried a little female infant, to which she give suck; her bosom
already a little sunk, appeared otherwise well formed, and
abundantly supplied with milk. This young woman, like the old man
and woman (whom we took to be her father and mother), had a very
interesting countenance, her eyes had an expression and fire
which astonished us, and which we have never since observed in
any other female of that nation. She appeared besides to be
extremely fond of her little infant, and her care of it had all
that kind and affectionate character which is acknowledged by
every body as the peculiar attribute of maternal love.</p>
<p>M. Freycinet and myself offered various presents to this
interesting family, but every thing which we offered them was
received with an indifference that surprised us, and which we had
often occasion to observe among individuals of the same
country.</p>
<p>In the mean time, M. Freycinet desiring to determine as soon
as possible his conjectures of the existence of a rivulet of soft
water in the bottom of a valley which we saw at a little
distance, set out with some of the crew. M. Lesueur, prepared to
go in search of the animals of the forest, and for myself I
remained among the savages, occupied in observing them, to
describe their natural habits, and in endeavouring to collect
some words of their idiom. The young man having observed that our
seamen wished to light a fire, hastened to collect together the
branches of some trees near us, then with a kind of torch which
he had placed near the spot where we were, he procured for us in
a few moments an immense large fire, which was the more
acceptable, as the thermometer was scarcely at 9&deg;. At this
instant the young woman shewed some evident marks of
astonishment, of which the cause was frivolous enough, but which
I ought not nevertheless to pass over in silence, because it is
precisely from those little details that we acquire a right
judgment of the state of a people placed so far distant from
social intercourse: one of our sailors wore a pair of fur gloves,
which in approaching the fire he drew from his hands and put in
his packet, at the sight of which the young woman uttered a
scream, which at first alarmed us, but we were not long at a loss
to guess the cause of her fright, and we could not doubt from her
gestures, but that she had taken the gloves for real hands, or at
least for a sort of live skin, which he could thus take offend
put into his pocket or replace at pleasure. We laughed heartily
at this singular mistake, but we did not enjoy so well the old
man's carrying away from us a bottle full of arrack, which, as it
contained a great part of our stock, we were obliged to make him
restore, at which he seemed to express a great deal of
resentment, for he left us, together with his family,
notwithstanding all that we could do to make them remain with us
longer.</p>
<p>I went afterwards to the beach: it was low water, and in two
hours I gathered more than forty new species of mollusques,
shell, crustaceous, and other fish. In the zoological part of the
description of Diemen's Land, I shall describe several of these,
which by their size, colour, and general economy, or their
particular importance to the naturalist, may appear to merit
attention.</p>
<p>On returning to the spot where our chaloupe was moored, I
learnt that M. Freycinet had not been able to find any appearance
of soft water, although he had made a long and laborious journey
in search of it. M. Lesueur had been more successful; he brought
back a dozen kinds of birds, three of the perroquet species, and
the beautiful tom-tit, with the blue head and neck, of which I
have spoken. The sailors during our absence had prepared our
frugal meal; we ate it in haste, and set out immediately to visit
another part of the shore, where we had some hope of finding soft
water. We presently discovered a but belonging to the natives; it
was simply a shelter of bark disposed in a half circle, and
supported against some dry branches: so slight a shelter could
have no other object than that of protecting the inhabitant from
the action of the cold wind. I observed that its convexity was
effectively opposed to the S.W., which on these shores is the
most constant, the most impetuous, and the most severe. Before
this wretched but we discovered the remains of a fire recently
extinguished; large heaps of oyster shells, and of <i>Haliotis
gigantea</i> were at a little distance, from which exhaled, from
the corruption of the remains of the animals left in the shells,
a putrid and nauseous odour.</p>
<p>On the beach we observed two canoes, each formed of three
pieces of bark clumsily joined together, and fastened by straps
or slips of the same bark. At a future time time I shall speak on
the subject of this unskilful attempt at the art of navigation:
M. Lesueur made a correct drawing of these canoes.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic-6" id="pic-6"></a><img alt="" src=
"1203691h-images/pic-6.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b><small>6. Native Navigation: East Coast of Schouten Island,
Tas.</small></b></p>
<p>These huts, these recently extinguished fires, these remains
of shellfish, and these canoes, left us no doubt that the family
we had just seen inhabited this part of the shore, and indeed we
soon saw the same party coming along the sandy beach towards us.
As soon as they observed us they shouted for joy, and mended
their pace to join us. Their number was now increased by a young
girl about sixteen or seventeen years of age, a little boy of
four or five years, and a little girl of three or four years.
This family thus consisted of nine individuals. The most aged of
them seemed to be the father and mother, the young man and his
wife seemed also to be brother and sister, and we supposed the
young girl to be also the sister of these last: the four children
concluded might be the offspring of the young man and woman.</p>
<p>The family were returning from fishing, in which they had been
fortunate, for each was loaded with shell-fish, of that kind
belonging to the large species of marine ear, peculiar to these
shores. The old man taking M. Freycinet by the hand, made signs
to us to follow him, and conducted us to the poor hut we had just
quitted. Fire was lighted in an instant, and after repeating
several times, <i>m&eacute;di, m&eacute;di</i> (sit down, sit
down), these savages themselves squatted down on their heels, and
began each to eat the produce of their fishery. The cookery was
neither tedious nor difficult; these large shells were placed on
the fire, where, as in a dish, the fish was baked, and afterwards
eaten without any other preparation or seasoning. On tasting this
food we found it succulent and well flavoured. While our good
Diemenese thus enjoyed their simple repast, the idea of treating
them with a little music entered our heads, not so much to amuse
them, as to see what effect our singing would have on our
audience. We chose the hymn which was so unhappily prostituted
during the revolution, but which is nevertheless so full of
enthusiasm and spirit, and so likely on this occasion to produce
effect. At first the savages appeared more affected than
surprised, but in a few moments they lent an attentive ear: their
meal was left unfinished, and they expressed their satisfaction
by divers contortions and so many odd gestures, that we could
scarcely restrain our risibility. On their part, they with
difficulty checked expressing their enthusiasm while we sung, but
no sooner was there a pause, than exclamations of admiration
issued from every mouth: the young man particularly seemed as if
beside himself, he pulled his hair, he scratched his head with
both hands, he threw himself into a thousand different positions,
and shouted with pleasure at the end of every verse. After this
martial tune, we sung some of our tender airs: the savages seemed
to comprehend the sense of these, but it was easy to perceive
that sounds of this kind did not much affect them.</p>
<p>Their repast being ended, the scene at once took a new and
more interesting character. The young lass whom I mentioned
attracted our more particular attention by the softness of her
manners, and by the affectionate and expressive regard with which
she appeared to observe us. Our&eacute;-Our&eacute;, like her
parents, was entirely naked, and did not seem at all to be aware
that any person could imagine there was any indecency or
immodesty in this absolute nudity. Of a constitution and form
more delicate than her sister and brother, she was also more
lively and animated. M. Freycinet, who sat next her, seemed to be
more particularly the object of her regards, and it was easy to
perceive in the manners of this innocent pupil of nature, that
delicate shade, which gives to the most simple playfulness, a
character of serious preference: coquetry itself seemed to be
called in to the assistance of the natural attractions of the
sex. Our&eacute;-Our&eacute; shewed us for the first time the
nature of the fard or paint of these regions, and the particular
method of using it. Taking some of the burnt charcoal in her
hands, she crushed it so as to reduce it to a fine powder, and
keeping this dust in the left hand, she with the right rubbed
some of it first on her forehead and then on her cheeks, and made
herself most frightfully blacks and what astonished us still more
particularly, was the air of satisfaction with which this young
girl seemed to regard us after this method of adorning herself;
and which seemed to give an additional degree of
self-satisfaction and confidence to the expression of her
countenance. Thus it seems, that a fondness for ornament and a
sentiment of coquetry prevails in the hearts of the whole
sex.</p>
<p>While this was passing, the young children imitated the
grimaces and gestures of their parents, and nothing could be more
curious or diverting, than to see these little negroes making
motions with their feet while we sung: they insensibly became
very familiar, and before we parted, they were as much at their
ease with us, as if we had been long acquainted. Every little
present we made them delighted them extremely, and increased
their attentions to us: general these children appeared to us to
be lively, merry; and a little mischievous. It is curious to find
at the extremity of the globe, and in this unformed state of
social intercourse, these amiable and affecting characters which,
among us, also distinguish the days of infancy. We have here also
pointed out similarities in the character of women in general
from the manners of those in these regions: we shall hereafter
find room for other analogous remarks, and adding to our own
particular observations those of other navigators, and deduce the
conclusion, that the characters of women; and children are much
more independent than those of men; that they are less affected
by the influence of climates, physical causes, or the improvement
of society.</p>
<p>The household furniture and utensils of the family were simple
and few: a leaf of the <i>Fucus palmatus</i>, with two ends bent
together with a small pin of wood, served them as a vessel: for
their drink, a split fragment of granite was used as a knife, to
take off the bark from trees, and to make points to their
sagaies, and a spatula of wood which seemed more particularly
designed for the purpose of raising the shell-fish from the
rocks; Our&eacute;-Our&eacute; alone, carried a bag made of
rushes, which was prettily and curiously constructed, and which I
much wished to obtain. As this young girl had also shewn me some
marks of regard, I ventured to ask her, for this little trifle,
and immediately without any hesitation she put it into my hand,
accompanying the gift with an obliging smile and some tender
expressions; which I was sorry I could not understand. In return,
I presented her with a handkerchief, and a hatchet and hammer, at
the same time shewing her brother how to use it, which was the
subject of much astonishment and exclamation to the whole
family.</p>
<p>In the mean time the evening approached, and we prepared to
rejoin our chaloupe, to get farther into the port, where we
intended to pass the night. As soon as our new friends perceived
our intention, they rose to accompany us; but after some
observations from the old man; the old mother, the young woman
with all her children, except, the eldest, remained in the hut,
the others attended us. M. Freycinet took Our&eacute;-Our&eacute;
by the arm; I walked with the old man; M. Lesueur gave his hand
to the young one, and M. Brue, our cadet, conducted the child.
The way we went Was full of brambles and shrubs; and our poor
savages being naked, were much scratched by them; we particularly
pitied young Our&eacute;-Our&eacute;: but without seeming to mind
the numerous scratches which coveted her thighs and belly, she
walked on through the midst of these thickets, chatting with M.
Freycinet, without any chance of being understood; but provoked
at not being able to convey her ideas, or to understand him, she
accompanied her discourse with so many winning gestures, and
gracious smiles, that her coquetry was very expressive.</p>
<p>As we drew near the place of our lauding, we heard several
reports of a gun, which much frightened our companions; poor
Our&eacute;-Our&eacute; particularly, trembled excessively, and
M. Freycinet had some difficulty in calming her terrors; her
fears soon increased at the sight of a numerous body of our
shipmates from the Naturalist, who were coming to meet us, and
who did not at all expect to find us on this spot. They were
Messrs. L. Freycinet, Faure, Breton, and Bailly, who had come to
reconnoitre the Port of Research, and who from thence had arrived
at that of Swans, in search of fresh water, and who like us had
not been able to discover any. After we had told these gentlemen
of the kind reception we had experienced from the natives, they
were all eager to load them with presents; but nothing pleased
them so much as a long red feather, which M. Breton presented to
Our&eacute;-Our&eacute;: she actually jumped for joy; she called
to her father and brothers; she cried, she laughed; in a word,
she seemed quite intoxicated with delight and pleasure.</p>
<p>We at length came to the beach, and embarked in our two
chaloupes. Our good Diemenese did not leave us for an instant,
and when we put off, their sorrow was expressed in the most
affecting manner: they made signs to us to come again, and as if
point out the spot, they lighted a large fire On the hill which I
before described: it even appeared that they passed the night at
this place, as we saw the fire till the morning.</p>
<p>Thus ended our first interview with the inhabitants of
Diemen's Land; the particulars of which I have given with the
greatest exactness, and doubtless it would have been difficult to
resist the sentiments which such adventures must necessarily
inspire. The confidence which the inhabitants shewed us, the
affectionate testimonies of good-will which We could not but
understand, the sincerity of their demonstrations, the frankness
of their manners, the affecting ingenuousness of their caresses,
all seemed to unite in developing the kindest and most
interesting affection and friendship. The general anion of the
several individuals of the family; the kind of patriarchal life
which we had witnessed, had strongly affected our feelings: I saw
realized with inexpressible pleasure, those charming descriptions
of the happiness and simplicity of a state of nature, of which I
had so often ready and enjoyed in idea. I was at the time far
from conjecturing the many privations and miseries to which such
a state is liable.</p>
<p>On leaving our good Diemenese, we steered our course towards
the end of the port, and settled to pass the night in a small
creek, where we hoped to find fresh water; but we were again
disappointed, and on the next day, as soon as it was light, we
continued our course to explore every corner of the port. We soon
observed great numbers of black swans sailing with much majesty
and swiftness on these peaceable waters. As the motion of our
chaloupes seemed to alarm them, we landed some sportsmen, and I
also went on shore to explore the interior of the country.</p>
<p>The immense forests of trees that seem coeval with nature
itself, and where the sound of the axe was never heard, present
an extraordinary spectacle to the eye of the traveller. Here
vegetation is continually enriched with its own spontaneous
productions, and every where expands without controul; and where
at the extremities of the globe, such forests are exclusively
formed of trees totally unknown to the European world, and
vegetable productions that are extraordinary both in their
organization and their great variety, the scene becomes still
more interesting. Here a mysterious and perpetual shade obscures
the light of the day, an extreme coolness, a penetrating humidity
is constantly felt. These large trees sinking into the earth with
age, again produce many healthy suckers: the aged trunks now
decomposed by the united effects of time and humidity, are
covered with different kinds, of moss and adhesive herbage; the
interior harbouring numerous reptiles and swarms of insects;
these fallen trunks obstruct every avenue of the forest, crossing
each other in a thousand different directions; they oppose the
passage like so many protectors of the boundaries, and multiply
the obstacles and dangers which surround the footsteps of the
traveller: often they sink under the weight of his body, and thus
he falls among the perishing remains, and still more frequently
the moist and putrid bark slips, from under his feet: sometimes
their heaps form natural banks from 25 to 30 feet in height; in
other places they have fallen over the bed of the torrents, and
across the depths of the valleys, thus forming so many natural
bridges, on which it is dangerous to step without great
caution.</p>
<p>This picture of disorder and the ravages of time, these scenes
presenting devastation and destruction, are counterbalanced, if I
may be allowed the expression, by the beauties of nature; all
that its creative power can display that is most majestic and
beautiful, here delights the eye and the contemplative mind. In
every part we see crowded on the surface of the soil, those
beautiful Mimos&aelig;, those lofty Metriosideros, those Correa,
formerly so totally unknown in our country, but which now are the
pride of our groves. From the sea-shore to the very summits of
the highest mountains of the interior, we see the lofty
Eucalyptus, the gigantic trees of the forests of the south, many
of which are not less than from 160 to 180 feet in height, with a
circumference of 25 or 30, and even 36 feet. The Banksia of
diverse kinds, the Protea, the Embothrium, the Leptosperm&aelig;,
expand their ramifications as in a charming border to these
impervious woods. In another place the landscape presents the
Casuarina, so remarkable in its foliage, so valuable for its
solidity, and the rich and beautiful marbled veins of its wood;
the elegant Exocarpos spreads out its waving branches, like those
of the cypress; and farther we seethe Xanthorea, whose single
stalk shoots 12 or 15 feet above a scaly and stunted trunk, and
from which distils an abundant quantity of an odoriferous resin.
In some places are seen the Cycas, whose kernels enveloped in
scarlet skin, are so deceitful and poisonous. In every direction
are charming groves of Melaleuca, Thesium, Conchyum, and Evodia,
all equally beautiful either for their majestic appearance, the
lovely verdure of their foliage, or the singularity of their
blossoms and fruits. In the midst of so many interesting objects,
the mind is astonished, and can only wonder at this
inconceiveable fecundity of nature, which supplies so many
different climates with productions peculiar to each, and which
at the same time are always so rich and beautiful.</p>
<p>On my return to the sea-shore, I learnt that our sportsmen had
been unsuccessful, the swans having kept quite out of reach, we
therefore got on board our chaloupes, and pursued them to the
very end of the port, where we killed two of them. We now landed
again to eat our repast, and to seek for fresh water: while M.
Freycinet and several of our companions in this pursuit walked
along the neighbouring shore, I resolved to cross some large
marshes, which in this place form the termination of the Port of
Swans. I hoped, and indeed succeeded in finding a number of
interesting subjects; but I hardly escaped being buried alive in
these vast marshes. Nevertheless, I succeeded in reaching the
opposite shore, and determined to return to our place of mooring
by crossing a valley which lay between the mountains, and which I
thought might be the bed of some stream. In this hope I was not
deceived, and I had the pleasing satisfaction of being the first
to discover a delightful little river, which produced great
plenty of trout of a new kind, and which running from the N.N.W.
to the S.S.E. seemed one end to reach as far as the foot of the
neighbouring mountains, and the other to lose itself among the
marshes, without having any apparent communication with the sea.
Its course was narrow, and in this place was not above three feet
deep; but the water was very sweet and clear. After going up this
river for a few minutes, I again bent my course to where our
chaloupes were moored. Our gentlemen had already returned,
without having discovered any appearance of fresh water. I
communicated to them my discovery, and they all immediately went
to ascertain the truth of it. During their absence, I sat down to
eat some muscles which our sea-men had cooked in sea-water; these
I found very good: all the rocks abounded with them, and I had
the pleasure of discovering a new kind of Pinnothera. These
muscles were also of a kind unknown to naturalists, as were most
of the zoological productions of these shores.</p>
<p>On the return of my companions from their walk to the little
river, they told me that they had followed it some way into the
interior of the land, on the banks they had found three or four
huts similar to those we had seen on the preceding days: they
were of the same opinion with me, that if not impossible, it was
at least very difficult, to get water from this river, on account
of the marshes, over which it would first be necessary to make a
causeway, whereon we might roll our water casks. They farther
told me, that they had also seen great numbers of trout, and
brought a few which they had killed with their guns.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the difficulty occasioned by the marshes which
makes this river so inaccessible, the discovery of it is
nevertheless of consequence, as The Port of Swans must sooner or
later become the site of an European settlement: and in this case
the river would supply water for a colony throughout every season
of the year. The causeway we have mentioned would easily be made,
and ships also might then water there.</p>
<p>We named the river, Fleurieu, in compliment to the celebrated
hydrographer of that name, who was also the chief compiler of the
excellent plan of our voyage, of which have given the particulars
in the First Chapter of this work.</p>
<p>It was four o'clock in the afternoon when we set sail to
return to our ships; at this moment the Port of Swans appeared
with additional charms to our delighted view: the serenity of the
atmosphere; the last rays of the setting sun reflected on the
waves; the shade of the forests; the darkened tinge of their
verdure; the grand appearance of the mountains in the interior,
the tops of which appeared above the clouds; the numerous little
creeks and small bays here and there to be seen on each shore;
the companies of elegant black swans sailing with majestic
motion; the numbers of beautiful perroquets, with varied plumage;
the lovely tom&shy;tits with blue necks, and sparrows of many
colours, flying about the woods, singing their evening song: all
seemed to unite in adding to the natural charms of so delightful
a spot: every eye was fixed on the prospect, and every one seemed
to leave with regret this interesting scene.</p>
<p>As night approached we were so becalmed, that our sea-men were
obliged to row without resting from six o'clock in the evening
till half past two in the morning; the chaloupe belonging to the
Naturalist, which we lost in the course of the night, must have
been still longer in reaching the ship. I learnt at my return,
that on the 15th in the morning, the little boat belonging to the
Geographer having been fishing on the Isle Bruny, the natives had
appeared in great numbers; that, loaded with presents by our
companions, they had spent the most part of the day among them;
that M. Maurouard, one of our cadets, wishing to ascertain from
his own experience, the degree of strength so generally ascribed
to savage nations, had proposed to one among them, who appeared
to be the most robust, to wrestle with him; the Diemenese having
accepted the challenge, was several times thrown by the young
Frenchman, and compelled to acknowledge his inferiority: from
that moment till their departure, several hours had elapsed,
without any appearance of the good-will and friendly disposition
of the natives towards them being in the least changed; and being
presented with new gifts by our friends at the very moment when
they re-embarked, it was impossible to have the smallest
suspicion of any change in the sentiments of the savages; when in
a moment a long sagaie, thrown from behind the neighbouring
rocks, struck M. Maurouard on the shoulder. This clumsy weapon
had been thrown with so much force, that after having grazed the
whole surface of the blade bone, it had cut through the flesh
between the neck and the shoulder. The boat's crew, provoked at
the perfidious and cowardly brutality, would have pursued the
savages and punished them as they deserved; but they had already
escaped among the rocks, or hid themselves among the brambles.
"This accident", said M. St. Cricq, who was on shore with M.
Maurouard at the time, "was a lesson to us in future; and we took
every precaution that no such thing should happen again:
nevertheless, these precautions were not sufficient, for in
another part of the channel, a few days afterwards we were again
attacked by the savages with a shower of stones: fortunately no
one was hurt."</p>
<p>In the meantime we had in vain sought fresh water On this part
of the coast: the result of our search convinced us that at this
season of the year all the springs are dry; we therefore resolved
to depart, that we might seek water in some other place. On the
17th we set sail to get more towards the interior of the channel,
but we had no sooner doubled the point Ventinat, than we were
forced by a calm to let fall the anchor in nine fathoms water,
oozy bottom. I immediately landed on the isle Bruny, with Messrs.
Freycinet and Montbazin: on this part of this large island the
soil is not very fertile: the trees here are so widely dispersed,
that objects two or three hundred paces distant may be easily
distinguished: the earth is light, sandy, and superficial; it
lays on a bed of rocky granite, of which I collected many
beautiful samples. Divers kinds of <i>Coleopter&aelig;</i>, among
which, two appeared to me to belong to a new genus; some
beautiful lizards, of a somewhat similar form to the scinque or
crocodile, but materially differing in the elegance of shape and
the agreement of proportion, and several beautiful sea and land
shells, were the produce of this incursion: but of all the new
subjects which we found on the isle Bruny, the most valuable was
a quadruped, the description of which will be found In the
zoological part of our Work.</p>
<p>A short time after our return, the commander himself came from
a short incursion which he had made on the mainland with captain
Hamelin, and Messrs. Leschenault and Petit. These gentlemen had
again met with the natives, and this interview had again ended
with a violent aggression on their part: for M. Petit having
drawn a representation of several of these savages, the party
prepared to return to the ship, when one of the natives sprung on
the artist, and attempted to take from him the drawings he had
just made: M. Petit resisted, and the furious savage seized a log
of wood, with which he would have knocked down our unarmed
companion, if the rest had not run to his assistance. Far from
endeavouring to avenge the attempt, they loaded the aggressor
with presents, in hope of calming his ferocity by this generous
conduct, and to obtain his good-will as well as that of his
countrymen: but these savage people no sooner saw our men busy in
getting on board, than they went into the wood, and immediately
we were assailed by a shower of stones, one of which hit our
commander near the lower part of the back, and caused a large and
bad contusion. Notwithstanding this perfidy, our companions
continued their generous conduct. In vain did the savages appear
on the beach, brandishing their sagaies and threatening our men
by their gestures: not a gun was fired at them. "These
hostilities", said our unfortunate botanist, M. Leschenault,
"were committed on the part of the natives, without our having
given them the least provocation; on the contrary, we haul loaded
them with presents and civilities, and nothing in our conduct
could have given them any offence; and I am astonished, after so
many examples of cruelty and treachery which are related in all
voyages of discovery, to hear sensible people aver, that men in a
state of nature are not wicked; that they may be confided in
without fear; that they are never the aggressors except provoked
to revenge, &amp;c. Unhappily, many voyagers have been victims to
these vain sophisms. For my part, I am of opinion, from all that
we have seen and experienced, that we cannot be too much on one's
guard against men whose nature has not been softened by
civilization; and that great discretion ought to be used in
landing on shores inhabited by such people. On the day after the
attack which I have just described, captain Hamelin having
embarked in his small boat, went to reconnoitre the shore, and
approached near enough to see what was passing there. It seemed
as if the adventure of the preceding evening had disturbed the
savages, or that they were determined to assault us if we landed
again on their coast; for the captain saw thirty-six men walking
along the shore, in parties of five or six, one in each group
carrying a bundle of sagaies; and at the head of this little army
was a man with a lighted firebrand in his hand, setting fire,
here and there, to the bushes which covered the land. This seemed
to be a precaution which they thought necessary, that they might
observe our motions from a greater distance, or to deprive us of
the means of hiding ourselves and surprizing them."</p>
<p>On the 19th, at six o'clock in the morning, we again set sail
to gain the Port N.W. where we designed to anchor: we
successively passed the isle Sattelite, the point Riche, the bay
of the Isthmus, the cape Legrand, the point Giquet; and about six
in the evening we moored in the port as we intended. This short
voyage between the two shores of the channel was very pleasant,
and the prospects very picturesque. "On whichever side we turned
our eyes," as M. Labillardi&egrave;re justly observed, "we saw
spacious bays where the navigator, beaten by the storm, may find
a safe shelter. The number of these harbours is so great, that
they might with ease contain all the fleets of maritime powers."
In another view, these peaceable waters enclosed between two
lands; these mountains crowned with clouds, the little hills, the
valleys clothed with the most luxuriant vegetation, the legions
of birds, whose varied notes might be distinctly heard on board
our ships; the naked savages, whose black tribes could be easily
distinguished on the white sandy shore; all together presented a
romantic picture: but what still more astonished us, was the
multiplicity of fires which we perceived. In every direction
immense columns of flame and smoke arose; all the opposite sides
of the mountains, which form the bottom of the port N.W. were
burning for an extent of several leagues.</p>
<p>Thus were destroyed these ancient and venerable forests, which
the scythe of time had respected through the course of so many
centuries, only to fall a sacrifice to the destructive instinct
of their ferocious inhabitants.</p>
<p>On the 20th at day-break, I embarked in a boat which was going
to fish on the isle Bruny: I collected about twenty new kinds of
fish, among which were two species of Lophies, two Ostracions, a
Uranoscopos, a Cottus, a Raie or skate, two Scien&aelig;, the
Antartic Chimera, and a second species of the same genus, which
was very remarkable from a bone on the top of the head shaped
like a club; a Syngnathus adorned with several floating
membranes, resembling so, many streamers. I also collected a
dozen or fifteen kinds of shells, either entirely new or very
rare, among which I found a valve of trigonia (<i>Trigonia
Antarctica</i>, N.) a kind of shell never till now known to be a
living subject; and which in our climates form such long banks of
petrifactions; and the beautiful Venus, with transverse ribs
extremely fine and thin, brittle, and slight; as also divers
Phasianelles of the greatest beauty, some elegant trochus,
several turbots, one of which I have described under the name of
<i>Eustomiris</i>, reflected the most brilliant and lively
prismatic colours; some kinds of patches, fissurelles, and
oscabrions, &amp;c. &amp;c. were the produce of this day's
research. At the sight of this numerous collection of curious
subjects, my unfortunate colleague M. Maug&eacute;, absolutely
wept, and notwithstanding his consumptive weak state of health,
he determined himself to go on shore on the morrow, and to seek
some of these interesting animals: but alas! he only considered
his zeal and courage; his dying frame was unequal to such an
effort. He was scarcely landed on the beach when he fainted; and
we were obliged to carry him again on board, in such a weak
state, that at one time we feared he would die on the way. This
was the last effort of his strength and zeal; he went no more on
shore till he was taken there to be buried in the bosom of the
earth.</p>
<p>As M. Freycinet will better explain in another part of this
voyage, the geographic labours of admiral Dentrecasteaux on
Diemen's Land are so very complete, that it would probably be
impossible to find any thing better executed; and M.
Beautemps-Beaupr&eacute;, their principal author, has by them
acquired an unalienable claim to the esteem of his countrymen,
and the gratitude of navigators of every country. Wherever
circumstances permitted this experienced artist to make
sufficient researches, he has left nothing for his successors to
do, The channel of Dentrecasteaux, the bays and numerous ports
which belong to it, are particularly correct. Unfortunately, as
the portion of Diemen's Land which lays north east of the
channel, was but very superficially visited by the French
admiral's boat, his work on this point is incomplete. We shall
successively in this and the following chapter, endeavour to
perfect the geographic account.</p>
<p>Our instructions from government, as we have specified in the
first chapter, were to go up as far as possible every river that
seemed to be of any importance. The North river was the only one
in this part of the Southern Hemisphere which, in this
particular, deserved reconnoitring: this care was committed to M.
H. Freycinet, and I obtained permission to accompany him. We left
the ship on the 24th of January, about three O'clock in the
morning; but opposed alternately by the calms, the currents, and
the winds, we were obliged to row along shore on the eastern side
of the river, to keep under the shelter of the land. At eight
o'clock we moored, not being able to stem a strong current which
carried us to the south: we here saw great numbers of pelicans,
boobies, cormorants, and puffins. The lofty Plateau mountain was
covered with fogs, which resolved into a very thick cold dew. The
forests in this part of Diemen's Land are not so thick and large
as in the interior of the channel; they appeared also to have
been partly destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>After passing the Plateau mountain, which seemed to be covered
with only small stunted trees, and whose steep sides, furrowed by
numberless torrents, presented the appearance of a basaltic
rampart, we continued our course up the river. At noon we were
off the large hill, at the foot of which the boats of admiral
Dentrecasteaux had stayed: this mountain seems to be formed, in
the higher parts, of horizontal beds; the base, however, appeared
to me to be of primitive origin. Beyond this hill, the river
certainly forms a remarkable elbow, but does not turn suddenly to
the west, as is indicated in the French chart&mdash;it continues
its general direction towards the north.</p>
<p>We had no sooner doubled the point formed by the great hill,
than we observed a prodigious number of black swans&mdash;the
river was in fact covered with them, and we soon killed above a
dozen, and then continued our course till we were aground on a
shoal of mud and herbage, which, with all our strength, we in
vain tried to get over. This unforeseen obstacle did not
discourage M. Freycinet; and on the morrow, at day-break, he
landed with some men well armed, and the necessary instruments,
to reconnoitre and survey the river by land, which he despaired
of accomplishing in the boat. I accompanied him till, impelled by
a desire to see more of the interior of the country, I separated
from my companions to go farther up the lands. I soon came to the
edge of a deep ravine, which was perpendicular to the course of
the river the left side was very steep, and it was with great
difficulty I climbed it. Near this kind of natural rampart, were
fourteen huts or sheds of bark, similar to those which I had
before seen: several fires were still burning in front of these
huts, and I could have no doubt but that they had just been
abandoned by the natives, who doubtless were frightened at the
sound of the guns, which our comrades fired from time to time as
they went along the bank of the river. In front of these huts I
found several bones of kangaroos and birds; and some flat stones,
warm and greasy, on which I concluded they had broiled their
food: I picked up some of the hatchets and knives used by the
natives; which were simply fragments of a sort of granite, very
fine and hard, and more or less in thickness, according to the
use it was designed for; with this substance the savages also
make their weapons, which are a sort of tomahawk, and their
pointed sagaies. In the particular history of these people, all
these details will be recurred to more at large.</p>
<p>I was still engaged in the examination of those simple
habitations, when on a sudden, I heard some piercing cries in the
bottom of a neighbouring valley: I was alone and unarmed; I
therefore made haste to get farther from the spot, and pursued my
course parallel to the river. I was soon at the foot of a high
mountain, which I climbed, and from the summit I discovered the
whole course of the North river, which after making a great
elbow, is lost among a lofty chain of mountains which lay towards
the north west. Beyond these planes of mountains, were to be
distinguished some very high peaks, some of which appeared to be
yet covered with ice and snow; at least they were remarkably
white: and my conjectures on this subject are corroborated by the
observations in the voyage of Dentrecasteaux, from which
observations it results, that several high mountains on Diemen's
Land are always covered with snow, even in the hottest seasons of
the year.</p>
<p>After some time enjoying the delightful prospect before my
eyes, I came down to the right bank of the river, and at half
past four o'clock I had reached the place where M. Freycinet had
left our boat under the care of our cadet, M. Brue and a few
seamen.</p>
<p>At half an hour past seven, M. Freycinet himself with his men
returned: after having gone above four leagues into the interior
of the island, keeping always the course of the river, he was
then obliged, on account of the thickets and marshes, to climb a
neighbouring mountain: "From whence," said he, "I perfectly
distinguished the course, of the river, which at length lost
itself in the mountains, its chief direction to the point where
it is lost in the narrow passages among the mountains, was
S.E.&frac14;S. and N.W.&frac14;N. The farther went, the saltness
of the water indeed diminished, but so in, sensibly, that it was
not till I came to the foot of the mountain, where I ended my
survey, that it was at all potable."</p>
<p>On the 25th, at day-break, we again set sail, to attempt a
passage over the mud-shoal; we now knew that it was not above two
or three hundred paces in breadth, and that beyond, this our boat
would find water enough to take us much higher up the river, from
the spot where we had been in the first instance obliged to moor.
A brisk ward from the N.N.W. and, the tide being in our favour,
we were in hopes to overcome this obstacle; but after seven hours
excessive labour and fatigue, we were obliged to give up any
ulterior attempt, and return to the shore, carrying with us the
sad certainty, that the river Could not be of any advantage to
navigation, or assist the voyager in any respect.</p>
<p>Our labours having been until now, more particularly directed
to the geography of this part of Diemen's Land, we had not been
able hitherto to give so much attention to the study of the
natives, and The subjects of natural history. This part of our
work being finished, M. Freycinet and myself resolved to land on
different parts of the shore, as we returned, and to make some
incursions up the country, to collect some now subjects, or to
have sonic communication with the natives.</p>
<p>The manners of the people in this part, appeared to be still
more savage than in the interior farther up the channel; and
though we perceived here and there a few of them, it was
impossible to join them, as they all when they saw us, fled into
the middle of the woods. With more circumspection and
perseverance on our part, we hoped to overcome their terrors, and
remove their distrusts: the attempt did not succeed, as we shall
presently see.</p>
<p>It was about two o'clock when we arrived off a small bay,
which was almost in front of the high hill on the left shore,
which we before mentioned: from hence we beheld a similar
spectacle to that which we saw at the time of our entrance in the
port N.W. In every direction, black columns of smoke arose; and
wherever we turned our eyes, we beheld the forests on fire: the
savage inhabitants of these regions appeared to wish, even at
this price, to drive us from their shores. They had retreated to
a high mountain, which also appeared like an enormous pyramid of
flame and smoke from this spot. Their shouts were distinctly
heard, and the people who flocked to them seemed to be very
numerous. We resolved to walk thither, and to spend the rest of
the day in that difficult undertaking.</p>
<p>After giving the necessary instructions to M. Brue, for the
erection of the tent and the care of the boat, M. Freycinet and
myself, with five men all well armed, directed our course
westward towards this burning mountain. The spectacle was
horrible: the flames had destroyed all the herbage; most of the
small trees and shrubs had experienced the same fate; and the
tallest trees were burnt to a considerable height; in some places
they had fallen to the earth by the violence of the flames, and
vast fires raged among the rubbish: it was with great difficulty
and fatigue that we advanced.</p>
<p>The nearer we approached the top of the mountain; the more the
noise increased, and we expected immediately to be attacked by
the savages, when in a moment the cries ceased: we came to the
spot, and we saw with astonishment that the natives had fled,
leaving their miserable huts. After picking up several weapons
which they had left behind them, we for some time pursued our
course in the same direction, and successively climbed three
mountains, without meeting any of the savages whom we were in
search of; at length, overcome with weariness and hunger, we took
the way to our tents, where we arrived at night-fall.</p>
<p>On the morrow at day-break we re-embarked, to continue our
voyage towards the ships; but we were now without water, and were
in immediate necessity of a supply, when about eight o'clock in
the morning we perceived a valley, which, from its enclosed
situation, and the freshness of the adjoining forests, we thought
might probably contain some springs of fresh water; and, indeed,
we soon found the bed of a stream, but unfortunately, at this
time it was almost dry, and we despaired of finding fresh water
here; but on a farther examination we discovered some deeper
cavities, which were still full.</p>
<p>While M. Freycinet was engaged in having our casks filled, I
walked into the interior of the country, going up the pleasant
valley, at the entrance of which we then were: The sun shone, the
air was cool and refreshing, and the dews, of the morning were
rising from the ground; thousands of different species of the
myrtle were in blossom, perfuming the air with their sweets,
while numberless birds played among the foliage. I particularly
distinguished among then the beautiful white cocatoo, with the
yellow tuft: this was twice as large as that seen in the
Moluccas. Here was also the large black cocatoo, with elegant
transverse stripes of bright blue under the tail. I also saw
thousands of those perroquets of the south, which,
notwithstanding the cold temperature of these countries, rival in
beauty the most brilliant kinds of those belonging to the
equinoxial climates. I successively remarked the cuckoo
<i>Xanthogastre</i>, the blackbird with a yellow ring round the
neck, and a bird of the same species that was reddish; the lovely
Tangara, of a lilac colour, the bulfinch with a red tail, the
woodpecker, and the tom-tit with a blue neck, and great numbers
of other birds, which I have before observed in many parts near
the channel. In the zoological part of our work, the particular
description of these will be given more at large.</p>
<p>On our return to the boat, we embarked, to go back to the west
side of the river, where we hoped to find some of the natives. At
noon we entered a small creek, which is situated directly to the
east of the middle of the Plateau mountain: here we saw a new
scene of conflagration, similar to that we had observed on the
preceding evening. "This conflagration", said M. Freycinet, "made
us hope, that we should find the natives collected together
somewhere near the spot; we therefore landed, and immediately
proceeded towards the neighbouring mountain. We had scarcely
reached the ascent, when we beheld the country, which we at first
thought so pleasant, with a totally different aspect: it now
appeared to be only a large desert, ravaged by fire&mdash;the
other side of the mountain was in flames."</p>
<p>In this incursion, I only collected some specimens of jasper,
granite, and another sort of rock, which my friend, M. Depuch,
thought to be a sort of porphyry. I also collected several kinds
of lichens that were very beautiful; several fungi and mosses, a
genus of plants, of which I had begun to form an interesting
collection from the first moment of our stay on the channel, and
which I have since continued at every opportunity during our
voyage.</p>
<p>As we returned towards the sea-shore, I followed the winding
of a small creek: on this spot, all the pebbles were of basaltic
rock, mingled with volcanic scoria. The existence of productions
of this kind, in a country that is essentially primitive,
possessed another charm in the petrifaction of Shells, some of
which I had collected on the preceding evening, at the height of
600 or 700 feet above the level of the sea, on one of the
mountains. From these circumstances it appears, that in this
extremity of the eastern world, the terrestrial globe has
experienced its revolutions and catastrophes; and there has been,
as in other places, ravages by the devastating fires of volcanos,
and lands swallowed up by the seas!</p>
<p>As we quitted our fourth place of mooring, M. Freycinet and
myself proposed to land again on other parts of the coast; but
the wind, which blew from the N.E., having freshened all at once,
and the sky threatening a storm, we made for the port N.W., where
we joined our ships at seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
<p>My industrious friend, M, Lesueur, now informed me, that
during our absence he had added a great number of curious fish to
our collection and also had been on shore, where he had met with
ten different kinds of birds which we had not before seen.</p>
<p>The situation of the channel of Dentrecasteaux at the
extremity of the globe; the multiplicity of its magnificent
ports; its harbours and beautiful bays; the variety of its shores
and bottom, is the occasion of its being at all times extremely
full of fish; and when storms, which are so frequent in these
latitudes, disturb even the very depths of the seas, the timid
myriads of divers kinds of fish, resort from distant parts of the
ocean to shelter in these peaceable waters: they must doubtless
resort here in still greater numbers, when the cold brings the
polar ice as far as on this side of the 50th degree of
latitude.</p>
<p>At this inclement season of the year, all the sea animals
hasten towards the north, seeking in more temperate climates the
food and shelter necessary to continue their existence,
Innumerable shoals of fish resort at these seasons to the channel
of Dentrecasteaux, towards Port Jackson, and to latitudes still
nearer the equator, and thus pay to the starving inhabitant of
the eastern shores of New Holland, the same annual tribute which
the shoals from the north pay to us in European countries.</p>
<p>It is also at this season of the year that great numbers of
sea-calves take possession of the isles in the straights of Bass,
and of most of those which are situated along the eastern and
western shores of New Holland it is in the same inclement season
that the whales from the south make a similar migration, the
ocean is at times covered with shoals of these enormous fish. "In
every part," said the captain of the English ship the Britannia,
in his voyage from the cape south of Diemen's land to Port
Jackson, in 1791; "the whole surface of the sea was covered with
whales, as far as we could see, even to the very edge of the
horizon: these large fish were crouding and following each other
in shoals."</p>
<p>The southern extremity of Diemen's Land projecting like a
large cape a-head of innumerable shoals, cannot fail of abounding
in all kinds of marine animals: to confine myself to the mention
of the fish only, I shall first observe, that their numbers and
great varieties were equally astonishing to us during our stay in
the channel, and consequently we could catch any number at any
time we caught several skate of six or eight feet in length five
species of these were new; raies of three or four hundred pounds
in weight, and some species of the same genus that were smaller
and of a very delicate flavour: we also caught divers kinds of
labres, spares, scienes, and etox: the uranoscopes, the
pleuronectes, the cottes, and the polynemes, were very numerous
in every part of the channel, and supplied us daily with plenty
of an excellent and wholesome kind of food. Among those kinds Of
fish which were of least utility, but that were also singularly
curious, were three kinds of ostracions, two of which were very
prickly; the armed chimera, which I have mentioned before, two
tetrodons, two lyngnathes, and a great number of other kinds, all
new, which M. Lesueur and myself collected, described, painted,
or preserved with the greatest care; but in general our
acquisitions were so numerous and so various, that it would be
impossible to particularise them, without exceeding the bounds of
this work, and of this chapter.</p>
<p>The twenty days which intervened between my return from the
North river till the departure of the two ships, were almost all
employed in making incursions, shorter or longer, on different
parts of Diemen's Land and the isle Bruny. I had often the
opportunity; during these walks, of observing the miserable
hordes of these countries, and to collect some interesting
particulars on the subject of their manners, customs, weapons,
ornaments, language, &amp;c. &amp;c. all these observations are
so immediately connected with the natural history of these
people, that here I shall only mention some particulars of one of
our most remarkable interviews.</p>
<p>On the 31st of January, early in the morning, I landed on the
isle Briny. A boat from the Naturalist and our long-boat, had
brought a considerable number of people on shore on this island,
either to fish or to get wood for the ships. The tide was low,
and I immediately left the people, with the intention of walking
as far as I could round the circumference of the island, at the
same time keeping along the shore. I had got out of sight of the
boats, when after doubling a large point; I perceived about
twenty savages coming along the shore, as if to meet me. I
without hesitating a moment turned back, warned by experience of
the danger of such rencontres.</p>
<p>As I thus retreated, I met M. Heirisson, officer of the
Naturalist, and M. Bellefin, the doctor of that ship, who were
amusing themselves by shooting on the borders of the forest. I
told them the reason of my retreat, and they offered to rep turn
with me and face the savages, that we might endeavour to have
some communication with them. Our number and our arms being now a
sufficient protection against their ill-will, if they should be
disposed to offend us, I accepted the proposal of my friends. We
were at this time at only a small distance from the company, when
in a moment they again disappeared among the trees of the forest.
We now climbed the downs, and without pursuing the natives, which
the swiftness of foot peculiar to these people would have made
hopeless, we contented ourselves with calling to them, showing
them several different things as presents, and at the same time
waving our handkerchiefs. At these demonstrations of friendship
they hesitated an instant, and then stopped, as if to wait for
us. We now discovered that they were women, and that there was
not a single male among the party. We were advancing nearer, when
one of the oldest of them leaving her companions a few steps in
the rear, made signs to us to stay where we were, and to sit
down, calling aloud to us <i>m&eacute;di, m&eacute;di</i> (sit
down, sit down); she seemed also to desire us to lay down our
arms, of which they seemed to be in some fear.</p>
<p>These preliminaries being settled, the women squatted on their
heels, and from that moment seemed to shew all the natural
vivacity of their character without the least reserve, and
speaking altogether, asked us a number of questions, seeming
often to criticise our appearance, and laugh heartily at our
expence, making a thousand odd gestures and contortions. M.
Bellefin began to sing, at the same time using a great deal of
action: the women immediately kept silence, observing with as
much attention the motions of M. Bellefin as they seemed in give
to the sound of his voice. At the end of every verse some
applauded him with loud acclamations, others laughed heartily,
while the young women, being more timid, kept silence, and
expressed their surprise and satisfaction only by their looks and
gestures.</p>
<p>These women, with the exception of some few who had the skin
of it kangaroo over their shoulders, were all entirely naked; but
without seeming to think at all of their nudity, they so varied
their attitudes and postures, that it would be difficult to give
any just idea of all that this interview presented of the
whimsical and picturesque. Their black skin disgustingly greased
with the fat of the sea-wolf, their short woolly hair, which was
black and dirty, and which some of them had powdered with red
ochre; their figure besmeared with the dust of charcoal; their
shape generally lean and shrivelled; with their breasts, which
were long, hanging down: in a word, all the particulars of their
natural constitution were in the highest degree disgusting. From
this general picture, however, we must always except two or three
young girls, of fifteen or sixteen years of age, in whom we could
perceive an agreeable form, and pleasant features, with a round
well formed bosom, though the nipples were rather too large and
long. These young girls had also something ingenuous in the
expression of the countenance, something soft and tender in their
manners, as lithe most amiable qualities of the mind were always,
even among the most savage hordes of the human species, the more
particular appendages of youth and beauty. Among the most aged of
these females, some were ill-formed and clumsy; others, but these
were few, looked sulky and ferocious; but in general, we observed
in them all a something unhappy and depressed on the countenance,
which, misery and servitude always print on the faces of those
who are compelled to bear the yoke. They were besides, almost all
of them covered with sores, the sad consequences of the ill
treatment they had received from their ferocious husbands: one
only, among all her companions, had preserved any degree of
confidence, with a lively and merry temper: this was she who had
imposed the preliminary conditions which I mentioned above.</p>
<p>After M. Bellefin had concluded his song, she began to mimic
his action and the tone of his voice, in a very pleasant and
truly original manner, which much diverted her companions: she
next began herself to sing, with such a rapidity of expression,
that it would be very difficult to give any idea of music, such
as it was, so different from the general principles of any
European music.</p>
<p>Their tunes seem entirely to accord with their language for
these people speak with such quickness and volubility, that it is
impossible, as we shall shew hereafter, to distinguish their
pronunciation with any degree of precision: it is a sort of
rolling sound, for which our European languages do not furnish
any expression of comparison or analogy.</p>
<p>Excited by the sowed of her voice, which we did not fail to
applaud with much warmth, and doubtless wishing to obtain our
admiration in other respects, our jovial Diemenese began to
dance, and to throw herself into divers attitudes, some of which
might be thought very indecent, if in this state of society, men
were not still absolutely strangers to all the delicacy of
sentiment and conduct, which among is is only the consequence of
complete civilization.</p>
<p>While all this was passing, I employed myself in minuting all
the particulars which I have here given, and many Other
observations, which will with more propriety be produced at a
future time. I was doubtless observed by this same man, who had
exerted herself so much to entertain us; for she had no sooner
finished her dance, than she came close to me, and taking from a
bag made of rushes, such as I have before described, some
charcoal which it contained, she crushed it between her hands,
and with an obliging air she began to apply it on my face, as is
customary in these regions. I willingly submitted to this
obliging piece of caprice: M. Heirisson had the same
complaisance, and was ornamented with a similar mask. We now
seemed to be very much admired by these women; they appeared to
regard us with a degree of sweet satisfaction and pleasure, and
seemed to congratulate us on the acquisition of such an addition
to our beauty. Thus it appears that the fairness of skin, of
which Europeans are so vain, is an absolute defect, and a sort of
deformity, which, in these distant climates, must yield the palm
of beauty to the blackness of coal, or the colour of red
ochre.</p>
<p>The deference which we had shewn for these women, and probably
the additional charms for which we were obliged to their kind
care and attention, seemed to increase their good will and
confidence in us: but, however, nothing would induce them to come
any nearer. At the least movement we made, that seemed to imply
an inclination to break through the conditions, they all sprung
up from their position on their heels, and ran away: we were
therefore obliged to conform entirely to their wishes, that we
might longer enjoy their company. After loading them with
civilities and presents, we thought proper to rise, and return to
our boat; and our Diemenese ladies seeming to intend taking the
same direction, the two parties set off, but we were again
obliged to submit to the regulations of these inexorable
women&mdash;we were to walk on the sandy beach, while they walked
on the downs of sand in a parallel line.</p>
<p>As they probably were on their return from fishing when we met
with them, they all had some large crabs, a kind of lobsters, and
some other sorts of shell-fish which they had broiled on the
coals, and which they carried in their bags of rush. These bags
were fastened round the forehead with a sort of string, and hung
on their backs: some of them were very heavy, and we pitied them
sincerely for having such burdens to carry.</p>
<p>We were as merry on the way as we had been during the whole
time of our interview; and from the top of the downs they played
many tricks, and practised many drolleries, to which we
endeavoured to reply as expressively as we could devise; and we
should have longer continued to divert ourselves in this innocent
manner, if one of the women had not on a sudden uttered a loud
cry of terror, which was repeated by all the rest&mdash;it was
our boats and comrades, of which they had just got the first
sight. We strove to calm their fears, assuring them that, far
from having any thing to fear from our friends, they would again
receive some presents; but our remonstrances were in vain, and
the whole party fled into the forest, when the same woman, who
was almost the only one who had endeavoured to entertain us,
seemed to recollect herself, and to change her mind. At the sound
of her voice, the rest seemed to hesitate a moment: she spoke to
them for an instant, but, as it appeared, could not prevail on
them to follow her. She sprung from the top of the downs atone,
and walking on the beach before us at a little distance, with
great courage, and even with a degree of stateliness; she seemed
to ridicule the timidity of her companions, who now, in their
turn, appeared to be ashamed of their want of courage: they by
degrees seemed to overcome their fear, and at length determined
to return to the beach. With this numerous and extraordinary
escort, we arrived at the spot where our boats were moored, and
where, by a chance it was impossible to foresee, all the husbands
of these poor women had arrived together but a few minutes
before.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the most unequivocal testimonies of the good
will and generosity of our companions, they still maintained a
sulky generosity expression of countenance their looks were
fierce and menacing, and their attitude showed something of
constraint, malevolence, and treachery, which they in rain
endeavoured to conceal: we thought we could perceive, that they
were mortified at their own inability to contend with us in their
divers attacks; at the same time, they seemed to dread our
vengeance.</p>
<p>At this unexpected rencontre, all the unfortunate females who
had followed us, seemed greatly terrified; and their savage
husbands gave them such looks of rage and anger, as were not at
all likely to re-assure them. After having deposited the fish
they had brought at the feet of these men, who immediately
divided them among themselves, without offering any to the women,
these humiliated wives placed themselves in a group behind their
husbands, who were seated on the farther side of a high down of
sand; and here, during the remainder of our stay, these
unfortunate women did not dare to speak, or smile, or even lift
up their eyes from the ground: but this is only a slight sketch
of the picture which we shall present to the reader hereafter. A
few days after, I had the pleasure of meeting the same woman who
had so much attracted our attention: I then learnt that her name
was Arra-Ma&iuml;da. M. Petit, at my request, drew a likeness of
her, and which is a very correct resemblance: in the features may
be easily discovered that expression of courage and superiority,
which so eminently distinguished her from her companions. The
last time I met with her, she had a young child at her back.</p>

<b><small>7. Arra-Ma&iuml;da</small></b></p>
<p>On the 3d of February, I landed again on the isle Bruny, with
three of our officers, the two Messrs. Freycinets and M.
Montbazin; and we soon saw two women, who, from the top of a
neighbouring mountain, were directing their steps towards the
sea-shore. Eager to see them nearer, my companions ran after
them; but they had not run above two hundred paces, before the
women, whom they imagined they should easily overtake, were quite
out of sight: this I had told them would happen, having before
been convinced that the inhabitants of these shores were, in
general, much more swift of foot than Europeans. As we drew near
the beach, we found a large fire, which doubtless had been made
in the night, and was still burning. Around this fire were
strewed almost all the presents which we had given to the
natives, and those which they had stolen, even at the risk of
their lives. We had before found some of these things scattered
here and there in the woods; and we were convinced that, after
having satisfied a puerile curiosity, these uninformed men threw
away what no longer pleased or amused them.</p>
<p>In the mean time, our business on Diemen's Land was ended: we
had obtained wood sufficient; the small river which ran at the
termination of the N.W. port had supplied us with plenty of
water, which was, however, rather brackish; time-keepers had been
regulated by our astronomer, M. Bernier; and lastly, M. Faure had
returned from exploring the N.E. of the channel, and brought back
the following interesting particulars:</p>
<p>In the east of the North Bay is marked, on the chart admiral
Dentrecasteaux, a second bay, which, by the name of Bay
Frederick-Hendrick, opens into a third, which, in the same chart,
is called Bay Marion. The channel of communication between these
two last bays, is correctly shewn in the French chart. Our
commander, immediately on our arrival in the N.W. port, sent the
geographic engineer, M. Faure, to reconnoitre this channel, and
to determine whether the passage was of sufficient extent for our
ships to go through with safety.</p>
<p>Eleven days had been spent in this work, from which it was
proved, first, that the plan of the North Bay, as it was found in
the chart of Dentrecasteaux, is incorrect. M. Faure, indeed,
discovered, in the innermost part of the bay, a piece of water
that was rather shallow, but of great extent: this was so
sheltered, that it might at all times be a safe place of mooring
for small vessels and boats. Here he also discovered a small
river, which, situated in the north of the Point Renard, was
navigable for near two leagues up the country; but all the water
was brackish. However, M. Faure succeeded in finding a supply in
some small lakes of fresh water which were near the shore, or
rather in the very bed of the river, which was at the time almost
dry.</p>
<p>2d, That the second bay, which lays S.E. of that of the north,
and which is but vaguely pointed in the chart of Dentrecasteaux,
is in fact a safe and spacious port, with excellent mooring.</p>
<p>3d, That there is not, as has been asserted, any channel of
communication between Marion's Bay and that of
Frederick-Hendrick.</p>
<p>4th, That what was at that time pointed out under the name of
the Isle of Tasman, in the French chart, is not an island, but a
large peninsula, which joins Diemen's Land by an isthmus of 100
fathoms in breadth at the narrowest part, and about 300 fathoms
in length.</p>
<p>5th, That this isthmus is not at all connected with the Bay of
Marion, or that of Frederick-Hendrick, as the chart indicates
precisely, but belongs to another bay, which is situated more
towards the south.</p>
<p>6th, That the name of Frederick-Hendrick is erroneously given
to the bay which lays S.E. of that in the north, which makes it
utterly impossible, according to the knowledge since acquired of
this bay, that Tasman could have known or have seen any part of
it.</p>
<p>7th, For the same reason, the name of Frederick-Hendrick,
given by the French to the small island which lays to the west of
the Point Joannet, should not be preserved, because in ascribing
the pretended discovery of this part of Diemen's Land to Tasman,
it helps to preserve an opinion that is not founded on fact.</p>
<p>8th, That the name of the Isle of Tasman, used by
Dentrecasteaux, ought also to be corrected.</p>
<p>9th, It appears, therefore, from the labours of M. Faure, that
the Bay of Frederick-Hendrick, not being where it is placed in
the French chart, it must be necessarily sought elsewhere; and we
shall see in the following chapter, that it will be found, thanks
to our exertions, in the true place, and in what manner it is at
all connected with that of Marion.</p>
<p>From all these considerations, we have, in the relation of our
discoveries, adopted the following names: preserving to the North
Bay that which was given to it by the French admiral, we have
given the name of Port Buache to the great bay which is described
so erroneously under the name of Frederick-Hendrick; the Isle
Tasman, of admiral Dentrecasteaux, we have called the peninsula
of Tasman; we have also agreed with M. Beautemps-Beaupr&eacute;,
in substituting the name of St. Aignant instead of that of
Frederick-Hendrick, as the name of the isle which lays west of
the Point Joannet. We called the piece of water at the farther
end of the North Bay, Ransonnet-Bason, and the small river whose
mouth is situated N.W. of the Point Renard, we named Brue-river,
from the name of one of the two cadets of our expedition, who
were both very estimable characters.</p>
<p>All our labours being thus terminated on this part of Diemen's
Land, we unmoored on the 5th of February, and made every
preparation to set sail as soon as the wind became at all
favourable. In the evening of the same day, the disk of the sun
at its setting appeared of the most beautiful and bright red
colour: the wind was then N.E. but in the course of the night it
changed to the north, and blew in impetuous squalls, which lasted
tilt ten or eleven o'clock on the following morning. These
squalls were so violent, that in the course of a few hours the
barometer sunk seven lines three-tenths; they were at the same
time attended with such a sudden and extraordinary degree of
heat, that in a few moments the temperature rose from 11&deg; to
22&deg; of Reaumur, and it was scarcely possible to breathe even
in the open air: the wind seemed like the heat from a furnace,
and immediately all the surface of the sea appeared to smoke; an
immense quantity of water spread throughout the atmosphere, and
during the rest of the day we were as if plunged in a bath of hot
vapour. Some of our people, among whom was our commander, thought
these effects of nature might be caused by the conflagrations of
the neighbouring forests; but independent of the insufficiency of
such an explanation, even in the present instance, we shall
hereafter see that these hot winds are also experienced on the
west shores of New Holland, with circumstances perfectly similar:
and on the eastern coast of the same continent, they are felt and
attended with effects that make them still more dreadful;
thousands of animals are sometimes suffocated in the course of a
few hours, and in an instant all the vegetation becomes withered.
We shall at present only observe, that these hot winds are felt
as far as the southern extremity of Diemen's Land; there also
these winds come from the north. In one of the following chapters
some curious observations will again occur on this subject, with
more particulars which are connected in an interesting manner
with the natural history of this large continent.</p>
<p>On the 17th of February, having a light breeze in our favour
from the east to the E.S.E. we set sail from the channel of
Dentrecasteaux, after a stay of thirty-six days, toward the
southern extremity of Diemen's Land.</p>

<br>
<small>[<i>From the</i> 17<i>th to the</i> 28<i>th of

<br>
<p>WE were scarcely out of the channel, when the wind changed to
the south, and compelled us, during the whole day, to tack
between the peninsula of Tasman, the isle Willaumez, and the isle
Bruny, without making any way. The night was calm, but about two
o'clock in the morning a fine breeze sprung up from the W.S.W. We
took the advantage of it to bear away to the S.S.E. At day-break
we passed Cape Raoul, which was peaked in every part with jutting
projections of prisms, and points of rock that appeared to be
basaltic. At seven o'clock in the morning we were off the Isle
Tasman, which is a large sterile plain, whose blackish sides rise
from the bosom of the waters like volcanic ramparts: the south
point, like Cape Raoul, was covered with immense columns of
basalt. On Cape Pillar, the same constitution, the same broken
appearance is to be observed; and on the cape which lies to the
west of the rocks of Hippolytus, and which we named Cape
Ha&uuml;y, in honour of the celebrated mineralogist of that name,
the appearance of these fragments is horrible. At the distance of
some miles, this cape appears like an immense organ standing on
the surface of the waters. The rocks of Hippolytus are connected
with this grand system of disorder and broken chasms: these rocks
are three in number, and the largest of them something resembles
the Coin-de-Mire of the Isle of France.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic-8" id="pic-8"></a><img alt="" src=

<br>
<b><small>8. General Map of the South-East Part of Diemen's
Land</small></b></p>
<p>After doubling Cape Ha&uuml;y, we found ourselves off a small
bay, but very pleasant. On the right and left of this bay, large,
black, and sterile masses raise their heads: these summits are
broken, and as if cut into teeth like a saw: towards the farther
end of the bay is seen a beautiful verdant border, which makes a
most striking contrast to the naked and barren sides of the dark
mountains by which it is enclosed. Beyond these first elevations,
in the distance, is seen a lofty mountain, whose summit is
terminated by a triple peak. We named this bay Dolomieu Bay, and
pursued our course towards the north, ranging at a short distance
a steep coast, washed by a deep sea. We now began to perceive,
that the land was not here quite so barren; and the lofty head of
the Eucalyptus appeared above these ramparts.</p>
<p>A short distance to the north of the Bay Dolomieu, we soon saw
a large opening, which M. Faure ascertained to be the Eastern
bay, opposite to the Port Buache, and which we mentioned in the
preceding chapter. This identity is so much the more
incontestible, as our engineer, at the time he was exploring,
after having crossed the isthmus, had found himself at the
farther end of this new bay, and from this point he had observed
the rocks of Hippolytus, so situated as to determine this fact.
We named this Monge Bay, in compliment to the illustrious scholar
to whom the mathematics, and other sciences, are indebted for so
many valuable discoveries. The isthmus which separates Monge Bay
from Port Buache, appeared low and sandy. Beyond this isthmus,
and on a second elevation, we discovered a chain of grey
mountains, which at first appear lower than those of the
peninsula of Tasman, but which, rising rapidly towards the north,
make a second peninsula, which we shall have to speak of in
another part of this work. A large rounded cape, of a brownish
tint, terminates Monge Bay to the north: the whole of this cape
towards the sea, is barren; but on the top are some green trees:
several reddish rocks projected out a-head, like so many small
points; the constitution of these seemed to be volcanic. This
remarkable cape was named Cape Surville, in memory of the
unfortunate French navigator of that name.</p>
<p>From Cape Surville to that of Frederick-Hendrick the lands are
very high, almost perpendicular at the base, and rounded into
large domes towards the summits: their appearance is of a dark
green colour; here and there might be distinguished a very few
low trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>Immediately to the north of Cape Frederick-Hendrick is the
large Bay of Marion, which we crossed without any stay; and about
five o'clock in the evening we anchored in the channel which is
situated between Diemen's Land and the Isle Maria, opposite to
Oysters Bay.</p>
<p>On the 19th of February, at day-break, the long-boat of our
ship, under the command of M. Maurouard, was sent to make the
tour of the Isle Maria, to draw the plan of it, and to ascertain
whether there was any fresh water.</p>
<p>Our geographic engineer, M. Boulanger, although scarcely
recovered from the distemper he had at Timor, was ordered, on
this service: I obtained leave to go with him, as I wished to
make observations on the island and its productions, of the
nature of the soil, the temperature, and the inhabitants.</p>
<p>We soon reached the most southern cape of this isle, which our
geographers have named Cape Peron: a-head of this cape there
rises a solitary rock of granite, of the height of from 150 to
200 feet, rent by the waves, and something resembling a sort of
obelisk; we therefore named it the Pyramid.</p>
<p>From this point, the coast turns short to the N.N.E. We
steered along shore at a little distance: it is from end to end
almost perpendicular, like an immense rampart of granite: on some
parts of this coast is an appearance resembling the remains of a
line of ancient fortifications. Several kinds of adhesive plants,
among which were particularly distinguished some lichens of a
tine brimstone colour, or a bright red, growing against these
ramparts, the tops of which were seen through the shrubs like the
parapet of citadel: in many places there were some resembling the
appearance of towers and battlements.</p>
<p>The bottom was deep all the length of this coast; but as it is
exposed to all the rage of the winds from the south, which meet
with no obstacle between this and the Antarctic Pole, it is
incessantly beaten by the turbulent waves, that break with great
noise and violence against the walls of granite which protect the
shore.</p>
<p>Arrived at the eastern point, which we named Cape Maurouard,
from the name of the cadet who now assisted M. Boulanger in his
geographic studies, we observed that the direction of the coast
turned to N.N.W.: here the mountains declined rapidly, and soon
the chain was broken to form a large bay, into which we steered,
and soon after landed on the isthmus which separates it from
Oysters Bay.</p>
<p>It was now about two o'clock; and while they were busied on
the beach in their geographic labours, I proceeded towards the
north coast of the bay, and thus got into the interior of the
country. At first I could walk but slowly, as I was obstructed by
the numerous shrubs which covered almost the whole surface of the
land: in some places the bushes were so thick and strong, that it
was impossible to pass. I was on the point of determining to
retrace my steps, when I perceived, at some distance, a path
which had been trod by the natives: into this path I turned, and
soon the trees were more dispersed; and I arrived, in less than
half an hour, at the top of a little hill, from whence I
discovered the two bays of the Isle Maria, the isthmus which
separates them, and the mountains of Diemen's Land, the highest
acclivities of which could scarcely be distinguished in the midst
of the vapours which enveloped them. Divers kinds of beautiful
grass made a pleasant verdant carpet: the <i>Melaleuca</i>, the
<i>Correa</i>, the <i>Fagara</i>, the <i>Conchyum</i>, the
<i>Styphelia</i>, the <i>Metrosideros</i>, &amp;c. here and there
formed pleasant thickets, above which appeared the lofty
globulous <i>Eucalyptus</i>, the immense <i>Leptosperma</i>, the
<i>Exocarpos</i> with leaves like cypress, the fibrous
<i>Casuarina</i>, the <i>Banksia</i> with silver, and a number of
other trees peculiar to the southern climates. At the foot of
this hill ran a small stream of fresh water; on the banks of it
were several kinds of <i>Pteris</i>, <i>Limodorum</i>, a new kind
of Everlasting with white blossoms; the beautiful <i>Aletris</i>
with red flowers; the tall Parsley of these shores; and a small
kind of <i>Daucus</i>, of a savour similar to that of our common
carrot.</p>
<p>While I enjoyed the beauties of this charming spot, and as I
looked around with a sort of pleasing inquietude, I perceived at
a little distance a monument, whose construction excited a
considerable degree of curiosity: I approached the place hastily,
and the following is the account of what I observed.</p>
<p>On a large spot of verdure, under the shade of some ancient
<i>Casuarin&aelig;</i>, a cone was raised, which was roughly
formed of the barks of trees, stuck in the ground at one end, and
fastened together at the other by a large wisp made of the same
substance. Four long poles, fixed in the earth by one end, served
as a prop and support to all the bark under which they are
placed: these four poles appear also to have been designed as an
ornament to the edifice; for, instead of being joined together at
the upper end, like the pieces of bark, and thus to form a simple
cone, they cross each other a little above the middle of their
length, that is to say, exactly where they project through the
top of the monument. In this manner they form a kind of tetraedre
pyramid, the point of which exactly meets the point or top of the
cone. This contrast of shape, and the opposition in the two parts
of the edifice, produces an effect that was pretty enough, and
was increased by an additional ornament of a long strip of bark
on each of the four sides of the pyramid, which was bent
together, and the two ends of each of these strips of bark were
also confined by the large wisp, by which, as I have before said,
all the others were bound together at the top; these strips thus
formed a kind of oval, pointed at the lower part, which was where
the ends were attached to the top of the cone. As each of these
ovals corresponded with each of the sides of the pyramid, it is
easy to conceive that such an edifice must have some appearance
of elegance, and be very picturesque.</p>
<p>I considered this monument for a few moments, but could not
imagine its use. I determined to examine it more strictly; I
therefore pulled off several large pieces of bark, and easily
penetrated the interior: all the upper part was unoccupied; but
at the bottom was a large flattened cone, made of fine soft
herbage, disposed with much care in concentric layers of a
considerable depth. . . . My curiosity increased with my
uncertainty on the subject. Eight small hoops of wood crossed
each other over the top of this green heap, and served to confine
it: the ends of each of these were stuck in the earth, and
fastened there by the pressure of a large flat stone of
granite.</p>
<p>So many precautions occasioned me to entertain hopes that I
should make some interesting discovery, and I was not deceived. .
. . I had no sooner taken off some of the upper layers of
verdure, than I perceived a large heap of white ashes, which
seemed to have been gathered together with great care. I put my
hand into the middle of these ashes, and felt something of more
substance, which I drew forth&mdash;it was the jaw-bone of a man,
to which there yet adhered some remains of flesh . . . I
shuddered with a sensation of horror . . . Nevertheless, on
reflecting a few moments on all I had observed in the
construction of this monument, I soon began to experience
sensations of a different kind: this verdure, these flowers,
these protecting trees, this thick bed of green herbage, which we
carefully had covered these ashes&mdash;all united to convince me
that I had discovered a place of burial.</p>
<p>As I removed some of the ashes, I perceived a black coal,
friable and light, which I soon ascertained to be animal coal: as
I found some that still chewed remains of flesh, in which might
be distinguished parts of the large blood vessels lilt of
calcined blood. I next found parts of the bones, that were easily
known to belong to the vertebrae, the shoulder, the leg, &amp;c.
all were much changed by fire, and some of them easily crumbled
into powder. These bones were not, as I had at first thought,
laid simply on the surface of the earth; they were all collected
together in the bottom of a circular hole of sixteen or eighteen
inches diameter, and eight or ten inches in depth: we shall prove
that these observations are of some consequence.</p>
<p>I probably might have omitted to mention a circumstance, not
uninteresting, on this subject, if, in another burial place which
I discovered on the following day, I had not made the same
observation. At the foot of the hillock on which, as I have
before said, the monument was raised, ran a stream of fresh
water, cool and limpid, which in this season of the year is an
advantage that is to be found in very few places. The banks of
this rivulet were covered with several kinds of herbage, among
which were divers species of <i>Orchis</i>, <i>Ophris</i>, the
<i>Richea glauca</i>, the <i>Apium prostratum</i>, and a sort of
carrot peculiar to these regions.</p>
<p>With what pleasure, seated on the side of this stream, I for a
few minutes indulged the following reflections, naturally
produced by so many united circumstances: "Among these terrific
rocks, in the depths of these venerable forests, nature has yet
preserved some of her rights, since the first monument which we
discover of the uninformed and savage race who inhabit them, was
consecrated by Nature herself."</p>
<p>The semicircular grove which I had formerly observed on the
barren western shores of New Holland, now recurred to my
recollection. I remembered the interest I felt at the appearance
of this wood on the left shore of the river Vasse, and I
exclaimed, "This monument, the only one which we discovered on
those shores, seemed also to have been consecrated by affection."
Thus it appears that the first impulse of devotion was inspired
by nature, and the first altars raised by filial piety, by
affection, and gratitude.</p>
<p>I extended this analogy between the two subjects: the grove of
Geography Bay was situated on the border of the Salt River, which
seemed, with the marshes that surrounded it, to supply, in a
special manner, the food of the inhabitants of these inhospitable
shores. The tomb which I had just discovered was placed near that
part of the East Bay which alone produced any fresh water: on
this spot also, shell fish was to be found in greater plenty, and
it was the daily food of the natives. This presumption of the
situation of the monument being chosen, was strengthened by an
observation which I made on the following day, in Oysters Bay, on
a construction of the same kind, which also was placed on an
eminence, at the foot of which ran a small stream of fresh water,
the only one we had discovered through the whole extent of this
last mentioned bay. "Thus it appears, that the same principle
which dedicates these monuments also raises them in situations
that are most interesting and Sear to those who visit those
places, impelled by their daily wants, and where they must
experience in a greater degree the sentiments of gratitude and
attachment."</p>
<p>Other ideas occasioned new meditations: I considered what
could be the origin, on these distant shores, of the custom of
burning the dead. Isolated from the rest of the universe,
confined to the extremities of the globe, the inhabitants of
these shores could not have had the idea by communication with
any other nation, it must therefore be incontestably their own.
But wherefore in this case have they adopted it in preference to
any other? is this preference a simple effect of chance; or is
there a physical reason for the customs derived from the very
nature of circumstances, and the particular mode of social
organization belonging to these people, which may have
established the custom, and which still continues the observance?
These queries, in discussion, require that I should, in a few
words, retrace the essential traits of the actual state of
society of the inhabitants of Diemen's Land, with which those of
the Isle Maria are connected in every respect, as we shall
hereafter demonstrate.</p>
<p>Almost entirely strangers to every principle of social order,
without any governors, laws, clothing, or cultivation of any
kind, destitute of any certain means of existence, and without
any fixed habitation, knowing no other weapons or implements of
any sort than his sagaie and his club, both of which are
imperfect and roughly formed; wandering in families on the
sea-shore, from whence the chief part of his daily subsistence is
derived; it is there he longest fixes his abode, and to that spot
he more frequently returns, where the shell fish is to be found
in greatest plenty, and where also the vicinity of some stream of
fresh water more conveniently may supply this necessary for
himself and family.</p>

<br>
<b><small>9. Native Habitations, Diemen's Land</small></b></p>
<p>What I have here said of the individual, in general may be
applied to the whole of the people who are the subject of these
observations: in such circumstances, the resources of the horde
end with those of each individual of its members.</p>
<p>These principles being granted, suppose one of these men to
die, a respectable old man, the father of a numerous family, he
is surrounded by his children, among whom he has just drawn his
last breath&mdash;What will they do with his corpse? Can they
forsake it? he was their father, he had loved them&mdash;and
shall they leave his body to be devoured by wild beasts? a
reflection like this makes even a savage shudder with horror.
Besides, the putrefaction of the corpse would become offensive,
and the scattered bones of their parent would not only be a
reproach to them for their ingratitude, but would also be an
unpleasant and disgusting spectacle.</p>
<p>To cast it into the sea appears at first to be the most
natural and simple expedient, but it was possible the corpse
might again be thrown on the shore by the currents and the tide;
and probably the putrified members of their parents might have
been fished up by their own hands among the shells which supplied
their daily food.</p>
<p>To embalm the body is totally beyond their means or
conception.</p>
<p>To bury it is a labour so much the more difficult, as the soil
is generally hard and flinty, and the absolute want of every kind
of tool makes it almost impossible for them to dig any kind of
grave. However, it is probable that these people would have had
recourse to this expedient, if another was not more ready,
easier, and at the same time more convenient in every respect,
than all those which I have before mentioned: this expedient is
to burn the corpse: here every thing concurs with the facility of
the execution; every thing agrees both with the general habits of
these people and their particular situation. The terrible and
powerful element, fire, from which they derive such various and
indispensable helps, cannot fail to excite among such people,
some of those sentiments of veneration which most of the ancient
nations had consecrated by so many religious ceremonies and
monuments.</p>
<p>Fire in these countries, although probably not worshipped as
formerly, seems to be esteemed as something very superior to all
other objects of nature, and these primitive ideas have doubtless
not a little contributed to the idea of burning the dead. This
opinion once formed, it became a duty to adopt it. The necessary
materials were always ready; it required neither reflection nor
labour; no tool was requisite; the execution was quick and easy
to be done; it prevented both the putrefaction and the consequent
infection; a few bones was all that remained after this duty was
performed, and the ashes of the fire were sufficient alone to
cover them. The whole ceremony, at most, required only a few
hours, and the preparations had also a tendency to make this
ceremony more solemn and sacred.</p>
<p>Thus, therefore, this custom of burning the dead does not
appear to be the pure effect of chance: according to all the
physical and local circumstances, it seems evidently to have been
occasioned by them, and if the nature of this work would allow me
to enlarge on the subject, it would be easy to prove, that this
important part of the customs of nations is in many respects more
connected with the quality and nature of the soil than might be
supposed. Is it not very remarkable, for example, that the two
countries of the world that are most celebrated for their
mummies, and the art of embalming the dead, namely, Egypt and
Teneriffe, should also be distinguished by the general character
of the continual dryness of the soil and atmosphere, and by the
facility of procuring there the divers aromatic, astringent, or
resinous ingredients, which make the essential part of their
embalmings. But, leaving all ulterior discussion on this subject,
let us here conclude what we have farther to say of the curious
monument of the savages of the Isle Maria.</p>
<p>The discovery I had just made pleased, me so much the more, as
no object of this kind had yet been observed in these latitudes.
Riche, in one of his excursions, had indeed discovered on
Diemen's Land, a piece of a human bone, to which adhered some
remains of half burnt flesh; and M. Labillardi&egrave;re justly
imagined from this discovery, that the inhabitants burnt the
dead: but this conjecture was founded On a circumstance so
equivocal, that it dill not deserve any kind of confidence. On
the contrary, we may now regard as a fact, all that belongs to
the curious chapter on the history of the inhabitants of those
regions.</p>
<p>I mentioned a second tomb which we saw on the following day in
Oysters Bay, opposite to that of the East. To conclude entirely
all that belongs to this subject, I shall anticipate the order of
the dates, and in a few words point out what I thought worthy of
particular mention. Situated on an eminence, at the foot of which
ran a stream of fresh water, the only one to be found in this
bay, this monument differed but little from that which I have
already described: it was only more ancient; the form was not so
regular; the poles which had supported the bark had fallen to the
ground; the herbage which had covered the ashes was much changed
by the humidity of the atmosphere; but in other respects the
bones and ashes were disposed much in the same manner as in the
monument in the East Bay. The only particularity which I
observed, and which certainly deserves to be preserved, was, that
on the under side of some of the largest pieces of bark, were
rudely engraven some characters, similar to those on the arms of
the natives who have been tatooed.</p>
<p>To what I have now said I must add one last observation, which
is, that from the nature of these monuments, it is not a matter
of any surprize that we meet with so few of them, for the bark of
which they are constructed is soon destroyed by the power of the
atmosphere, or scattered by the winds. The fine herbage which
covers the ashes presently decays, and even the ashes, which arc
soon partly dispersed, can Only then leave the appearance of a
fire having been made on the spot; and as the bones are collected
together in a hole, they of course remain buried, which
sufficiently explains why we never see any of them on the surface
of the earth. To this last circumstance let us add the complete
calcination they have undergone, to make the decomposition more
rapid and annihilation more complete.</p>
<p>In the mean time my companions had finished their geographical
labours, and when I rejoined them they had been waiting for me
some minutes: we now re-embarked, and proceeded to take soundings
in the interior of the bay. There was almost every where in this
bay, water sufficient for anchorage, but the bottom being
generally of bard rock, it is not very safe: it is besides, too
open, and too much exposed to the winds from the south and by
east. It is doubtless, to this quality of the bottom of the bay
that we may ascribe the abundance of sea-grass, which forms on
several parts of the surface truly floating meadows, in the midst
of which innumerable flocks of go&euml;lands, puffins,
cormorants, &amp;c. continually resort to seek their food.</p>
<p>After having thus completed reconnoitring the great Eastern
Bay, which we named Ri&eacute;dl&eacute; Bay, in memory of the
worthy naturalist whom we had lost at Timor, we again landed on
the island to pass the night, and on the morrow, which was the
20th of February, we left the island at four o'clock in the
morning, to continue our exploration of the Isle Maria.</p>
<p>After doubling the point north of the Bay
Ri&eacute;dl&eacute;, we saw the land turn to the E.N.E. as far
as off Cape Mistaken, which forms the most eastern point of the
island. From this cape, as far as the Cape North, the coast lays
in the direction of W.N.W. All this part of the island, between
the East Bay and the North Cape, is really terrific. Lofty walls
of granite, 300 or 400 feet high, and almost perpendicular,
protect the whole length of this coast: in these thick walls are
vast caverns, in which the waters rush with a great noise,
somewhat similar to distant thunder. The shore is every where
inaccessible: the sea here rolls its tumultuous waves; and one
cannot help trembling for the fate of ships driven on this
inhospitable shore.</p>
<p>Such a constitution doubtless depends on the general situation
of the Isle Maria, which in this point is exposed to all the fury
of a stormy sea. This presumption becomes a certainty, by the
comparison of the western coast of the island with the eastern
shore which we have just described; for no sooner had we doubled
the Cape North, which, from the name of our engineer, was called
Cape Boulanger, than the land sank rapidly, and spread into a
long, flat, sandy shore, under the shelter of Diemen's Land,
which continues without interruption to the farther end of
Oysters Bay. In a word, every thing to the east proclaims the
ravages of the winds and waves; while to the west, every
appearance declares the repose of nature, and of a more tranquil
climate.</p>
<p>A-head of Cape Boulanger is a large rock, which is connected
with the Isle Maria by a dangerous reef: beyond this rock is a
large islot of granite; it is rather law and barren. There is a
narrow passage between this islot and the land, where small boats
only can pass: we called this, North Islot.</p>
<p>I have mentioned shoals of sea-grass which spread over part of
the Bay Ri&eacute;dl&eacute;: their extent had before surprised
me, but in lengthening the coast N.E. of the island, this sort of
vegetation was a subject of still greater astonishment. The whole
surface of the sea was covered with it at intervals; and it was
not without difficulty that we disengaged ourselves from one of
these shoals, on the edge of which we had got entangled, and we
were some hours contending with this singular obstacle. These
enormous banks or shoals are composed of only one kind, namely,
the <i>Fucus gigantinus</i>, the largest, doubtless, of all kinds
of sea vegetation, for we measured some of it that was from 250
to 300 feet in length. To raise these immense long stalks to the
surface of the waters, and to support them there, nature finds a
simple and effectual method. Here and there each stalk produces a
leaf of a considerable size, indented at the edges, and crinkled
all over: where this large leaf is joined to the stalk, is a kind
of large vesicle or bladder, in form somewhat like a pear, about
two or three inches in length, and one inch in diameter in the
thickest and most inflated part. All these vesicles, filled with
air, are like so many little balloons, which raise the stalks to
the surface of the sea, and also keep the leaves open and spread
on the waves. Several of these leaves are very large: I measured
some that were ten or twelve feet in length.</p>
<p>It is not only on account of their curious organization, or
their enormous proportions, that these plants engage the
attention of the voyager. Sometimes torn from the depths of the
sea by the violence of the storm, these shoals of <i>Fucus</i>,
or sea-grass, are carried by the currents into the interior of
the Bay Ri&eacute;dl&eacute;, and are soon buried under the
sands, and considerably help to choak up the bay, and to enlarge
the isthmus which separates it from Oysters Bay. Thus; in this
distant part of the world, we see realized the grand system of
the influence of marine plants in increasing the land&mdash;an
effect which Linn&aelig;us has before particularly noticed; but
without extending this digression, we will return to the subject
of our voyage round the Isle Maria.</p>
<p>After doubling Cape Boulanger, we ran along the whole length
of the coast N.W. of the island, which is, as I have before said,
low and sandy. Vegetation flourishes but little near the
seashore; but in the interior of the country we observed some
beautiful forests, and the opposite side of the mountains
appeared to be covered with lofty trees. About five o'clock in
the evening we passed Middle Islot, which we had thus named from
its situation, being between Diemen's Land, and Isle Maria. This
islot is only a rock of granite, of about 120 toises diameter,
and not more than 30 or 40 feet above the surface of the waters:
it is naturally very barren; and the natives who pass from the
main land to Isle Maria, being in the habit of resting there,
have destroyed by fire every appearance of vegetation.</p>
<p>It being now almost dark, our farther survey of this coast
became more and more uncertain and difficult; therefore, when we
had doubled Cape Lesueur, which forms the north point of the
entrance of Oysters Bay, we prepared to land, with the intention
of passing the night on shore, when we perceived a company of 25
or 30 savages, who came towards us, armed with long sagaies, and
shouting aloud. This numerous company at this time was very
mal-a-propos, as we were much fatigued with being two days on the
sea, and really wanted rest; therefore, as we had no inclination
to pass the night watching with arms in our bands, we determined
to get farther into the bay, persuaded that the savages would not
follow us: and in fact, they continued their course towards the
west, and were soon out of sight, when immediately we went on
shore.</p>
<p>Early in the morning on the 21st we renewed our survey of
Oysters Bay, which at the farther part is so shallow, that we
were several times in danger of being a-ground, although we were
a considerable distance from the shore. Notwithstanding this
inconvenience, we terminated our survey of the bay, and were
going to double the south point at the entrance, when we heard
the sound of a gun from the ships . . . and at regular intervals
we heard the same sound repeated, so that we could not be
mistaken in the cause . . . The last of my colleagues, M.
Maug&eacute;, was certainly no more, and his remains had that
moment been committed to the earth. He died the day after we had
left the ship, universally regretted by all on board both the
vessels. He was deservedly esteemed for many good qualities, and
his zeal for the success of our expedition. His body was interred
on Isle Maria, at the foot of a large <i>Eucalyptus</i>, against
which a plate of lead was fixed, whereon was inscribed the sad
particulars of his death; and the name of Point Maug&eacute; was
given to the part of the island, where the remains of our
unfortunate companions were deposited.</p>
<p>On leaving Oysters Bay we stood, directly towards the western
part of the island, which we had not entirely explored; after
which we bent our course towards the ship, and reached it on the
21st of February, in the evening.</p>
<p>On the next day, early in the morning, I again left the
Geographer, intending to cross the isthmus, and to visit again
the monuments on the East Bay. M. Petit, our draughtsman,
accompanied me. A little boat, known to French sailors by the
name of <i>pousse-pied</i>, was at my command; it held only three
men, and our only protection was a single musket, which M. Petit
had secretly taken with him: for, although we had on board our
vessels a thousand tithes more ammunition than was necessary for
an expedition of this kind, our commander had absolutely given
orders, that the men belonging to any of the boats should be
without arms, under the pretext that they used too much
powder.</p>
<p>On the evening preceding this very day, two carpenters
belonging to the Naturalist, who were attacked on Isle Maria,
narrowly escaped the blows of the natives. This recent
occurrence, and my solicitations, had no effect on the determined
resolution of our commander; and as there was no alternative
between exposing ourselves unarmed to the probable attacks of the
savages, and staying on board doing nothing, I determined to goon
shore at all hazards. We shall soon see to what imminent danger
we were exposed, from the captain's obstinacy.</p>
<p>We were not long before we discovered, on the coast south of
Oysters Bay, a large fire, which, as it could only have been made
by the savages, gave us hopes of meeting with some of them on
that part of the land; we therefore landed near the spot, and
were not disappointed in our expectations. Fourteen natives, who
were seated round the fire, received us with transport, which at
the same time seemed to express surprise, admiration, and
pleasure. <i>M&eacute;di, m&eacute;di</i> (sit down, sit down),
were the first words addressed to us. We seated ourselves, and
they gathered round us. They were most of them armed with long
sagaies: others had clubs, which they laid down by their sides;
and M. Rouget, our cockswain, who had landed with us, and was
armed with the musket, also laid it by him, keeping eye
constantly on it, for fear that some native should carry it away
into the woods&mdash;a precaution which we had learned from
experience while in the Gut of Dentrecasteaux.</p>
<p>The arms being thus disposed of, we mutually surveyed each
other for some minutes. The natives would examine our skin, and
so far we permitted them to satisfy their curiosity; and repeated
exclamations of astonishment at the whiteness of it, were the
results of that examination. Presently, however, they wished to
pursue their researches somewhat farther: perhaps they might
doubt whether we were beings formed like themselves, or perhaps
they wished to satisfy themselves of our sex: whichever it might
be, they solicited this singular investigation with so much
warmth and obstinacy, that we found it extremely difficult to
refuse them; when perceiving at length our determined repugnance,
they insisted no longer with respect to us, but pursued their
inquiry with one of our young sailors, who by his youth, and
being without a beard, seemed to be the more proper object for
verifying their conjectures, or removing their doubts. This youth
having, at my solicitation, consented to give them the
satisfaction they required, the savages seemed transported with
pleasure; but scarcely were they convinced that he was formed
like themselves, than they set up a cry of joy and acclamation
that perfectly stunned us.</p>
<p>Whilst the natives were engaged in these particular
observations respecting us, I applied myself to the consideration
of them with particular attention. Most of them were young
people, from about 16 to 25 years of age; two or three appeared
to be from 30 to 55 years; one only older than the rest, appeared
to me to be from 50 to 55 years of age: he alone had a skin of a
kangaroo upon his shoulders&mdash;the others were perfectly
naked. In general, most of them were of a stature sufficiently
high for their ages. Among the grown men, there was one who was
not less than five feet six inches; but he was thinner and lanker
than his companions: all the others varied in their stature, from
about five feet two to five feet four inches. There was one among
them who had his hair powdered with red ochre: this was a young
man of 24 or 25 years of age, called Bara Ourou, of a more
handsome make than the others, though he himself had the same
defects of proportion common to his race; that is to say, an
enlarged head, large and bony shoulders, a large breast, large
and brawny buttocks; the extremities lank and weak, particularly
the legs; the belly, also, too large for the rest of his
body.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic-10" id="pic-10"></a><img alt=""
src="1203691h-images/pic-10.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b><small>10. Bara-Ourou</small></b></p>
<p>The physiognomy of these savages was abundantly expressive;
the passions were strongly marked, as they succeeded each other
in a rapid succession; and their whole figure was changed and
modified with their affections. Fierce And ferocious in their
menaces, they appear at once suspicious, restless, and
perfidious. In their joy, the figure displays a convulsion that
has the appearance of madness; among the aged there is an
expression that is at once sad, sullen, and severe; but in
general, among all these people, there is to be noticed at some
moments an insincerity and ferocity, which cannot escape an
attentive observer, and which but too well corresponds with their
character.</p>
<p>After having thus given some time to the surprise occasioned
by the examination of our party, M. Petit displayed before the
natives some feats of slight of hand, which diverted them very
much, and which drew from them the most whimsical demonstrations
of joy and enthusiasm; but nothing surprised them so much as to
see M. Rouget run a pin into his flesh, without shewing any sense
of pain, and without its being followed by a single drop of
blood: at this prodigy they regarded each other in silence, as if
to impart their mutual astonishment, and then all together they
began to shout like so many madmen.</p>
<p>Unluckily for me, among our other presents were some pins,
which indeed they had asked for; and one of the natives being
willing to satisfy himself, whether I possessed the like
insensibility which was so mach the object of their admiration,
came behind me unawares, and run one of the pins into the calf of
my leg so dextrously and decidedly, that I could not help crying
out.</p>
<p>In the mean time, M. Petit and myself endeavoured to profit by
their good-humour, and whilst he was engaged in sketching one of
them, most distinguished by the regularity of his features, the
development of his form, and the expression of his physiognomy, I
applied myself, with the assistance of some words which I had
collected during our stay in the Gut of Dentrecasteaux, and with
the aid of gesture, to make known our friendly sentiments towards
them, and of which they acquired the meaning with a degree of
sagacity which astonished us much.</p>
<p>It was now that our interview became truly interesting:
crowded together among the ashes of their fire, we appeared quite
at home and satisfied with each other. I seized this favourable
opportunity to ask them numerous questions, addressing myself
particularly to those whose comprehensions seemed to be quickest.
In this manner I successively obtained an answer to the words
yawning, laughing, weeping, whistling, blowing, tying, untying,
burning, spitting, making water, going to stool, breaking wind,
striking a blow, wrestling, tearing, strangling, &amp;c. &amp;c.
In general, they appeared to me to understand easily, and to be
quick in apprehension they soon conceived the meaning of my
gestures, and, indeed, they seemed from the first moment to be at
no loss, but in a good natured manner repeated those words which
I had at first pronounced wrong, and often they laughed heartily
at the mistakes I made in the endeavour to repeat them
aright.</p>
<p>I cannot pass over in silence an observation I made at the
time; it is, that they appear to have no idea of the action of
embracing . . . In vain I addressed myself to several of them in
turn, to make them understand what I wished to know&mdash;on this
subject it was impossible; and when, to leave no doubt of what I
wished them to comprehend, I approached to embrace them, they all
had that look of astonishment which any unknown action occasions
in ourselves. This observation I had before made, when among the
natives of the Gut of Dentrecasteaux; and when I really embraced
them, by way of making myself understood, saying at the same
time, <i>gou&aacute;narana</i> (how do you call that)?
<i>nidego</i> (I do not know, I do not understand), was the
invariable reply. The idea Of caressing seems to be entirely
strange to them: in vain I attempted to make myself understood by
such gestures as were likely to characterize the
action&mdash;their surprise declared their ignorance, and
<i>nidego</i> again served to convince me that they had no
corresponding idea. Thus it appears, that the two actions which
to us have so many charms, and which seem so natural, namely,
kisses and tender caresses, are entirely unknown among these
savage nations. However, I do not positively assert as a fact,
what may only be a conjecture; but I can assert that I never saw,
either on Diemen's Land or New Holland, any savage embrace
another of his own sex, or even of a different sex.</p>
<p>I have before noticed the changeableness of the character of
these ferocious people, and we soon had an additional and
singular proof of this trait.</p>
<p>While M. Petit and myself were busily engaged in our different
pursuits, we on a sudden heard some shouts from the interior of
the neighbouring forest. At this noise the savages rose
precipitately, seized their arms, and turning their eyes, with
looks of surprise mingled with ferocity, tor wards the sea, they
appeared much agitated, when we discovered a boat belonging to
our ships, which was going along shore at a little distance: I
had no doubt but that it was this boat, discovered by their
sentinels or their wives, from the rocks or from the trees, which
had occasioned their agitation and alarm. In a short time these
shouts were repeated, and as they certainly signified that the
boat was now getting farther from the shore, the fears of the
natives seemed to subside a little. I took advantage of this
opportunity to endeavour to make them understand, that the people
whom they had seen were, like us, their friends, and that they
therefore had nothing to fear, but, on the contrary, they might
expect from them many presents and much kindness: they seemed to
comprehend my meaning, and again laid down their arms. M. Petit
and myself then endeavoured to proceed as before&mdash;he to
finish his drawing, and myself to acquire a few more words of
their language; but they became more and more uneasy and
inattentive to us, and would no longer answer my questions: M.
Petit also experienced much difficulty in finishing the sketches
which he had begun.</p>
<p>By degrees these people seemed to become bolder: they talked
to each other with much emotion, and as they looked at us, they
appeared to meditate some violence against us; but M. Rouget's
musket, and his countenance, which was very handsome, and at the
same time had the expression of great intrepidity, seemed to keep
them in some awe. Whether it was curiosity or treachery, they
teazed him every moment to fire at some birds that were on the
neighbouring trees; but we were aware that the musket was a bad
one, and we thought our situation too critical to run any, risks
in complying with their desires, and our refusal was another
cause of suspicion and disquiet.</p>
<p>Their audacity increased with their distrust. One of them
wanted the jacket I wore, which, from the brightness of the
colours, had attracted his attention: he had already asked me for
it several times, but I had refused him so positively, that I did
not suppose that he would return to the charge. It however
happened otherwise; for in a moment, when my attention was
engaged another way, he seized hold of my jacket, and directing
the point of his sagaie towards me, he brandished it in a
threatening manner, and seemed to say, "Give it to me, or I will
kill you." It would have been rash to provoke him, situated as I
was; for the wretch would certainly have pierced me with his
sagaie: I therefore affected to take his menaces as a joke; but I
nevertheless took hold of the sagaie, and turning the point away,
I shewed him that M. Rouget was presenting his musket at him, and
I added one single word of his own language (<i>mata</i>), death:
he understood me, and laid down his weapon with as much
indifference as if he had done nothing to offend me.</p>
<p>I had no sooner escaped this danger than I found myself
engaged in a manner, which, if not so perilous, was however very
unpleasant. One of the large gold rings which I wore in my ears,
was coveted by another of the savages, who, without speaking a
word, slipped behind me, and putting his finger slyly into the
ring, pulled it so violently, that he would infallibly have torn
my ear, if the lock had not opened.</p>
<p>Let us now recollect that all these men had been loaded with
presents by us; that we had given them looking-glasses, knives,
beads, handkerchiefs, snuff-boxes, cups, &amp;c.; that for them I
had putted off almost all the buttons from my clothes, which, as
they were of gilt copper, had appeared to them to be of great
value because of their brightness; let us also remember that we
had given way to all their fancies and caprices, without
requiring any return for all our gifts, and thus we may judge how
unjust and treacherous their conduct was towards us; and I really
believe, if it had not been for M. Rouget and his musket, that M.
Petit and myself would have fallen victims to the ferocity of
these savage people.</p>
<p>Certainly no one ever was more disposed, both from character
and principle, to conciliate and oblige these men, and to submit
to their caprices; but I must declare frankly, that the whole
tenor of their conduct chewed a treacherous disposition, and a
degree of ferocity that disgusted both me and my companions. In
comparing what we had now seen with what had before happened in
the Gut to several of our shipmates, we derived this inference,
that it is not prudent to go among these people without
sufficient means of defence against their attacks; and farther,
that this principle does not only apply to the people whom we
have just described, but may with equal propriety be applied to
all savage or uncivilized nations, as may be easily proved by
reading the accounts of voyagers.</p>
<p>In those very places, where the inhabitants are said to
possess the greatest gentleness and mildness of character,
unprotected Europeans have experienced many great dangers, and
very often have fallen victims to their own generous confidence;
but this discussion is not so immediately connected with our
narrative, as to permit me to enlarge on the subject, or to give
the many interesting particulars which I could produce, and which
I mean to collect in some future work.</p>
<p>Tired of all the unpleasant manners of the savages of Isle
Maria, I determined to end this perilous interview; but wishing
at any rate to repeat some experiments which I had began to make
in the channel, on the development of the natural strength of the
people of these countries, I therefore had the dynamometer of
Regnier brought from the boat, where till then it had been left;
hoping that the form of this instrument, and its use, might
probably engage the attention of the savage people on whom I
wished to try the experiment. In this conjecture I was right;
they all seemed to admire the instrument, and all wished to touch
it at the same time, and I had some trouble to prevent its being
broken.</p>
<p>After making them comprehend its use, by a number of trials
which we made for that purpose, we prevailed en them to try their
own strength on the instrument, and seven of them agreed to make
the experiment; when one of those who had first tried, and who
had not been able to move the beam of the dynamometer so far as I
had done, seemed provoked at his want of strength, and, as if to
give the lie to the instrument, he took hold of my fist in a
passion, and seemed to defy me to disengage it: after a few
efforts, however, I succeeded; but having, in my turn, seized him
with all my strength, and finding he could not get free by any
exertion he made, he appeared much ashamed, and very
irritated.</p>
<p>Until this moment, the old man I had before mentioned had kept
a profound silence; but after what had just passed; he spoke a
few words to his countrymen, without any very particular
expression of countenance: these few words, however, produced
such an effect, that from that moment not one of them would touch
the dynamometer.</p>
<p>Before we departed, I thought proper to leave them some fresh
marks of our friendship and good-will; I therefore approached the
old man, and taking him affectionately by the band, I presented
him with a glass bottle, a knife, two gilt buttons, a white
handkerchief, &amp;c. and made signs that we were going, but that
we should return with more presents for him and his companions.
The old man seemed so much the more pleased with these trifles,
as he saw we were preparing to depart: he smiled at me with an
air of satisfaction, that was still mingled with something of
uneasiness and ferocity.</p>
<p>While I was thus taking leave of the old man, M. Petit, who
wished to have a sagaie, had bought one with a looking-glass: I
also wished for one of their clubs, which I had obtained, when
the savages, changing their tempers in a moment, again seized
their weapons, and shouting all together, menaced us in such a
determined manner, that M. Rouget was obliged to point his musket
at him who appeared to be most incensed against me: this was that
same Bara Ourou, whom I mentioned as being the handsomest fellow
of the whole company, and of whom M. Petit had been taking a
likeness.</p>
<p>After this last outrage, there was not a moment to lose in
getting to our boat; but, fearing that these savage people would
pelt us with stones or lance their sagaies at us in our retreat,
as had happened several times before in the channel, we therefore
resolved to retire slowly and with caution: M. Petit and myself
walked first, while M. Rouget calm behind with his musket. These
precautions succeeded, and we gained our boat without any
accident, and bent our course towards the farther part of the
bay. The natives took the same direction on the beach for some
time, but perceiving two boats belonging to our ships, which were
dragging for oysters, they disappeared in a moment among the
trees of the forest, and from that time none of them appeared any
more on this part of the coast.</p>
<p>I have given all the particulars of this long interview with
the natives, that the reader may be the better enabled to judge,
how many difficulties and dangers are experienced by voyagers in
their communications with the people belonging to these savage
nations, and how impossible it is to conquer the natural ferocity
of their character, and their prejudice against us.</p>
<p>On leaving the savages we steered our course towards the
farther part of Oysters Bay, intending to land there, and
crossing the isthmus, to proceed on foot to the monuments, which
M. Petit promised to draw very correctly: all this we
accomplished in a short time, and then returned on our way to the
ship, which we reached that night.</p>
<p>While we were thus exploring the Isle Maria, and studying the
character of the natives, three boat belonging to our ships were
almost at the same time exploring all the nearest parts of
Diemen's Land, and the isles adjoining. One of these, under the
command of M. Freycinet the elder, had orders to bear away to the
south, and to visit all that part of the coast of Diemen's Land
which lays between the cape opposite to the point south of the
Isle Maria, which we had named Cape Bernier, and that of
Frederick-Hendrick, where our vessels had terminated their
surveys. In this space the bays of Marion and Frederick-Hendrick
ought to be connected, taking the chart of Tasman to be correct,
as we really found it to be.</p>
<p>M. Freycinet the younger, having the second boat under his
command, also made Cape Bernier the point of his departure, and
bore away to the north as far as the parallel of the most
southern of the Schouten islands, where he was to reconnoitre all
that part of Diemen's Land which also was opposite to Isle
Maria.</p>
<p>The third boat, with our engineer M. Faure, was to determine
the geography of the Schouten isles, which had been but slightly
surveyed by Tasman: M. Bailly also shared this labour.</p>
<p>We shall now shew what were the results of each of these
expeditious.</p>
<p>M. Freycinet the elder, was absent eight days, and brought the
following account: between Cape Bernier to the north, and that of
Frederick-Hendrick to the south, is the great bay Marion. Exposed
to all the winds from the south and by east, it is properly but
an open roadstead, not very safe for ships, though there is
generally plenty of water, and good bottom for anchorage. All the
north coast of this bay, from Cape Bernier as far as the point
Ressac, is formed of high lands; the coast may be ranged at a
very little distance, and there are several small creeks where
boats may shelter when the east wind is not very strong. From the
point Ressac as far as the entrance of the bay of
Frederick-Hendrick, is a flat sandy shore, extremely low, and
describing a slight but regular curve. "The east wind which at
that time prevailed," said M. H. Freycinet, "caused a frightful
surf on this long sandy shore: the sea broke violently against it
on every part, and even as far out as several cables length.
However, wishing to stretch along shore as near as possible, I
suffered myself to be driven towards the sandy beach, but I soon
found myself so surrounded by such strong and heavy seas, that I
was obliged to get farther out with all speed."</p>
<p>In the farther part of Marion Bay is an opening which
communicates with the bay of Frederick-Hendrick. This passage is
narrow, and the eastern extremity is protected by breakers,
against which the sea beats with great force: nevertheless, it is
not so dangerous as it at first appears, and M. H. Freycinet
found there above three fathom water. The interior of the bay, is
obstructed by large sandy shoals, which are dry at low water: the
south part is where the water is deepest, and where the anchorage
is safest. In the southeast is a small river of fresh water; it
is on this account so much the more to be valued, as there was
not to be found at this hot season of the year any fresh water
elsewhere, either on the neighbouring parts of the continent or
the adjacent islands. This advantage was the greater on account
of the abundance of fish in this bay, and the ease with which we
procured wood: unfortunately large vessels cannot come here
because of the shoals.</p>
<p>On comparing these last labours of M. H. Freycinet with those
of the engineer Faure, which we have mentioned in the preceding
chapter, it appears,</p>
<p>1st, That Frederick-Hendrick Bay is really situated as Tasman
describes it.</p>
<p>2ndly, That what is described under the name of Marion Bay, is
only a roadstead, which is situated off the Bay
Frederick-Hendrick, and to which Tasman had neglected to give any
particular name.</p>
<p>3dly, That the Bay Frederick-Hendrick is absolutely distinct
from that which is so denominated in the gut of Dentrecasteaux,
and which we ourselves have named Port Buache.</p>
<p>4thly, That the bay and the port are separated by an isthmus
sufficiently elevated and large, that the sea cannot at any time
go over it.</p>
<p>5thly, That there is not any appearance of a channel of
communication near this spot, as pointed out in the chart of
Dentrecasteaux.</p>
<p>6thly, That the chart of captain Flinders is more correct in
this particular, as he has not pretended to shew this imaginary
passage, but is defective in other respects, as he places the bay
of Frederick-Hendrick in the situation of the bay north of the
French chart: a position which an examination of the course of
Tasman, and an inspection of his chart, will prove to be
wrong.</p>
<p>7thly, From this exploration of M. H. Freycinet, it appears
also that the charts of Tasman and Marion, of this part of
Diemen's Land, are more exact than those of modern
navigators.</p>
<p>8thly, From these observations it follows, that Marion made no
discovery in this part of Diemen's Land; for, without the
consideration that it was not possible for Tasman to reconnoitre
the bay Frederick-Hendrick, and to make the plan of it which we
now have, without crossing, and consequently discovering Bay
Marion, his tract shews that he anchored in the last bay; in
addition to which, we may convince ourselves by comparing
Tasman's work with ours, that the plan of the bay called Marion
is more correct in the Dutch navigator than in Marion himself;
but as it has been at all times so considered, we confine the
name of the bay Frederick-Hendrick to the little port visited by
M. H. Freycinet, and the name of Bay Marion is applicable to the
great roadstead which extends before that port, and which is
comprised, as we have said elsewhere, between the Cape Bernier to
the north, and that of Frederick-Hendrick to the south.</p>
<p>9thly, From the whole of our labours on this part of Diemen's
Land, it is at length proved, that all that part comprised
between the Bay Monge, the Port Buache, Bay Marion, and that of
Frederick-Hendrick, makes a new peninsula, which towards the
south is connected with that of Tasman by the isthmus described
in the preceding chapter, and which towards the north is joined
to the rest of Diemen's Land by the isthmus I have just
mentioned. This second peninsula, to which we have given the name
of Forestier's Peninsula, is formed of high lands, which decline
almost suddenly towards the two isthmuses: on this singular
conformation we shall here make a few observations.</p>
<p>On slightly looking over the chart of the southern extremity
of Diemen's Land, we are at first astonished at the great number
of isthmuses which appear on the eastern coast: for example, the
isthmus Bruny, that of the north, that of Tasman, Forestier's
isthmus, and that of the Isle Maria, are, if I may be allowed the
expression, crouded together; and we shall also find another
among the supposed isles of Schouten, which has been mentioned by
navigators who bare preceded us in these latitudes. All these
isthmuses are extremely low and narrow, at the same time that, on
the contrary, the lands to which they join are generally formed
of high mountains. These different conformations make it
necessary to reconnoitre these shores very near, to determine
their real form and situation. In fact, if we keep ever so little
out at sea, it is scarcely possible even to conjecture the
existence of these isthmuses, or to believe otherwise than that
the lands which they connect, are perfectly distinct one from the
other. We shall now see that the most celebrated navigators,
Tasman, Furneaux, and Flinders, are themselves deceived in this
particular; and there is no doubt but that the error in the chart
of Dentrecasteaux may be ascribed to the same cause. In fact, we
may conceive that his draftsmen not having gone beyond the point
Renard, and not having from this point either a sight of the very
low isthmus which is situated at the farther end of the Bay
Frederick-Hendrick, or that of any other land beyond, as in fact
there is only the open sea, we may conceive, I say, that they
might or must have concluded that there was a direct
communication of the north bay, in which they then were, with the
Bay Frederick-Hendrick of Tasman, which they also knew to be near
and in the same direction. Thus it is, that physical and
geological observations, which are too much neglected by
geographers in general, may often throw a light on and sometimes
resolve difficulties of this sort that are of consequence to the
navigator.</p>
<p>The mission of M. Freycinet the younger, was not so difficult
to execute as that of which I have just given the results;
neither did it occupy so much time, and this young officer, who
left the ship on the 20th of February, returned on the 22d in the
evening.</p>
<p>At a short distance to the north of Cape Bernier he discovered
a large salt marsh, which by a narrow opening obstructed by
stones, communicated with the sea. Beyond this marsh, and off the
north islot, he had also reconnoitred a small port, into the
farther end of which several streams of brackish water discharged
themselves, some of which might probably supply fresher water
during the rainy season. He named this bight Port Montbazin: he
then continued his course to the north; he was in a short time
off a large point, which he called Cape Bougainville. Here the
coast takes a direction to the N.N.W. and forms, off the southern
extremity of Schouten Island, a small deep cove, but exposed to
the winds from the south and by east. At this point terminated
the survey of M. L. Freycinet. It now remains to give some
account of the mission of M. Faure to the Schouten islands.</p>
<p>To the north of the Isle Maria, appears on all the charts of
this part of the world, a long chain of islands, which under the
name of the Schouten Isles, project on the eastern aide of
Diemen's Land, leaving a large channel, or rather a long strait
between this land and the islands. These isles were first
discovered by Tasman, in the year 1642: they were more
particularly explored by Furneaux in 1770, and captain Flinders
in 1799 reconnoitred them still nearer. The united labours of
three navigators so justly celebrated, left us net the least
doubt of the existence of these isles; but as none of them had
gone into the strait which must lie between them and Diemen's
Land, M. Faure was ordered to make this discovery.</p>
<p>After having, in the course of the day on the 19th of
February, ranged the coast of Diemen's Land as far as off Cape
Bougainville, he bore away on the morning of the 20th to the
N.E., that he might stand right in for the most southern of the
isles which he was to reconnoitre. At eleven o'clock be
discovered an islot which was situated in the very direction he
was steering. "It was at this time", said M. Bailly, "that we
began to smell a strong and most unpleasant odour; it increased
as we drew nearer this islot: when we had come within a short
distance of its shores, we found them covered with an amazing
number of sea-cows; the largest of them, which were of a yellow
colour, occupied the higher lands, while those which were
smaller, and which appeared to be black, filled the cavities
which were in the lower part of the rock. The shores of this
islot were rather steep, so that when any one of the sea-cows on
the higher part would descend lower, it generally slid down,
carrying with it those that were lower. A deep sea surrounded
this rock: at two boats length from the shore the soundings, were
fourteen fathom, and the bottom was full of fucus and sea-weeds,
which rose to the very surface of the water."</p>
<p>At four o'clock in the evening M. Faure landed in a small
creek near the cape S.W. of Schouten Island, which, from the name
of this geographer, we named Cape Faure. "This island", continued
M. Bailly, "is entirely formed in the eastern part of lofty
granitic mountains, which are very steep, and where there is but
very little appearance of vegetation, the rock being almost every
where naked. The western shore is more level and more pleasant:
it is composed of a soil disposed in horizontal beds, and is well
wooded, and the tout ensemble makes an agreeable prospect: the
sandy beach which spreads before it makes the landing easy, while
on the contrary, the eastern coast is very steep." In the E.S.E.
of Cape Faure are seven little islots, which project a-head of
the south-east point of Schouten Island: we named these Taillefer
Islots, from the name of the worthy physician whom we shall
presently have to mention in a more particular manner.</p>
<p>After having reconnoitred all the western coast of the
Schouten Island, in the course of the morning of the 21st of
February, M. Faure found himself off the narrow strait which
separates this island from another laud which he supposed was one
of the other isles of Schouten. "This channel", continued the
companion of M. Faure, "is very deep, affording good room for
working to windward between the steep shores, at the foot of
which there is never less than eighteen fathom water." We have
described it in our charts by the name of Geography Straits, thus
to preserve the memory of the expedition to which we owe the
discovery of this part of Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>On crossing Geography Strait, M. Faure intended to bear away
towards the north, to reconnoitre the eastern coast of the
Schouten islands, and to return by the strait supposed to lie
between these isles and Diemen's Land: but all of the 21st, and
22d days of this month were spent in the same vain research; he
could discover no such passage, and was therefore obliged to
return on the 23d to the Geography channel, to stand right in
west for the same lands of which he had just lengthened all the
eastern coast. About noon he landed in a small creek situated
towards the southern extremity of what he then supposed was the
second isle of Schouten; and as, since the preceding evening, it
had been terrible weather, he determined to rest there till the
next morning, the crew being exhausted with fatigue, not having
been on shore for two whole days.</p>
<p>M. Bailly took this opportunity to make some useful
observations on this point of land. "High granitic mountains,"
said he, "whose summits were almost entirely bare, formed all the
eastern coast of this part of Diemen's Land; that rose suddenly
from their base; the land which lay between them being extremely
low, and cannot be seen at sea at any great distance. It is no
doubt to this singular conformation, that we must attribute the
error of navigators who had preceded us in these latitudes, and
who had taken these lofty mountains for so many islands. We have
said that the eastern shore of these supposed isles is steep,
wild and barren; that on the west is low, pleasant and well
wooded; this contrast, which any friend M. Peron has also seen in
the general constitution of the Isle Maria, doubtless proceeds
from the same physical causes. This part of Diemen's Land has
inhabitants; for we observed in several places the remains of
their fires and the fragments of their meals."</p>
<p>The 24th of February was spent in steering again towards the
north, in coasting the western shore of the Schouten isles: but
the impetuous squalls being come in from the south, our voyagers
had only time to shelter under the lee of a small island, which,
from its being an asylum in this critical moment, they named the
Isle of Refuge. According to M. Bailly, it is about a quarter of
a league distant front the coast, and is only a granitic fiat,
which rests only a few feet above the waves; it is covered with
trees of a middling size; but there is not any appearance of
fresh water.</p>
<p>On the 25th was completed the survey of the western coast of
the supposed Schouten isles: the remaining doubts on the subject
of these isles were at this time entirely removed in the most
positive manner; for after having successively explored several
deep coves separated from the eastern shore by some low sandy
isthmuses, on one of which they discovered a large pond of fresh
water, our companions found themselves at the extremity of a bay,
which they carefully examined on every side. Its extent,
according to M. Bailly, is near fifteen miles long, and about
four leagues across the month: the bottom is of a good quality;
and the soundings always gave from five to fourteen fathom: it is
sheltered from every wind, except those from the south by east to
the south east; and these are in a great measure broken by the
Isle Maria, and by the islot of Sea-cows. Its extent makes it
capable of receiving any number of vessels of any size; and wood
may also be procured there, the shore having good landing for
small boats, and the interior abounding with forests. Fresh water
may also be supplied from the large pond on the peninsula. The
appearance of this bay is besides very picturesque; two chains of
lofty mountains parallel to each other encompass this land,
giving it the appearance of a beautiful valley surrounded by the
waves.</p>
<p>If we now state the results of these divers labours, it
appears,</p>
<p>1st, That instead of the five or six isles of Schouten,
described in all the charts till this time, there is in fact only
one.</p>
<p>2ndly, That the part of the coast which extends from the cape
north of this Schouten island as far as 41&deg; 6' south
latitude, consists of a new peninsula, which we named Freycinet
Peninsula.</p>
<p>3dly, That there is really no other strait, nor other channel,
than that which runs between Schouten Island and Freycinet
Peninsula.</p>
<p>4thly, That all the space between the supposed Schouten isles
and Diemen's Land forms a large and very, fine bay, to which we
gave the name of Bay Fleurieu, in honour of the illustrious
scholar to whom France and her navy are so much indebted for so
many valuable and honourable works.</p>
<p>5thly, That Diemen's Land, previously enlarged by us, with the
peninsula of Tasman, and that of Buache, is also farther
increased, by these last surveys, with all the Schouten isles,
one only excepted.</p>
<p>From all these results it follows, that our work has so
specifically embraced all the particulars of the geography of
this part of Diemen's Land, that it may be esteemed as correct as
is possible to be made in an expedition of this kind.</p>
<p>All these labours being thus terminated, we set sail on the
27th of February in the afternoon, and steered our course to
describe the south side of the Isle Maria. But before we quit it
entirely, let us draw a slight sketch of its physical
constitution; this appears to me to be the more indispensable, as
most of the particulars may also be applied to the neighbouring
lands, and more particularly to Schouten Island and Freycinet
Peninsula.</p>
<p>The Isle Maria, first discovered in the year 1642 by Abel
Tasman, is situated on the east side of Diemen's Land, in the
great Southern Ocean; it lays in 42&deg; 42' south latitude, and
in 145&deg; 54' east longitude from the meridian of Paris; its
form is very irregular: larger and more elevated towards the
south, it has also the same appearance towards the north, while
the middle being more compact, from the east to the west it forms
only a small isthmus of from 250 to 300 paces in width, that is
scarcely raised 30 or 40 feet above the level of the sea. The
geographic situation of this island, its being exposed to the
polar winds from the south, the smallness of its extent, the
elevation of the N.E. and S.E. parts, the vicinity of the lofty
mountains of Diemen's Land, the form of the island being so
extremely narrow towards the middle, that the interior is almost
entirely occupied by the waters, finally the large marshes which
are situated on the north coast of Oysters Bay, are so many
circumstances likely to diminish the proportion of heat in this
island. And in fact, though we were at the time in the midst of
the hottest season of these countries, the extreme term of the
temperature which we experienced during our stay, never exceeded
15&deg; R. and the mean term was from l2&deg; 9' R. The nights
particularly were very cool; and the thermometer, at four o'clock
in the morning was scarcely at 8&deg;. The same causes which we
have here pointed out, as being capable of diminishing the beat
of the temperature of this isle, on the contrary, increase the
humidity of the atmosphere: the vapours also are constantly very
great; and evening and morning, the tops of the mountains are for
a long time enveloped in mist.</p>
<p>The soil also partakes of this general quality of the
atmosphere: it is every where humid where the sand and the rocks
are not too naked: in lower places it is marshy.</p>
<p>Fresh water is very scarce on the Isle Maria; and if we
reflect on what I have said of the nature of the country, and of
its particular constitution, we may easily conceive the cause of
this scarcity. We could only discover in Oysters' Bay one very
small stream of fresh water on the south coast, and a few holes
dug by the natives on the borders of the marshes on, the north
coast: the water of these last was stagnant and bad. In
Ri&eacute;dl&eacute; Bay I discovered two very small rivulets,
the one at the foot of the hill on which was the tomb; the other
on the same shore, but a little nearer the spot where we landed.
The water of these small rivulets was good, but as it is very
dangerous, if not impossible to anchor in the east bay, these two
streams are of little use to navigators.</p>
<p>The barometer varied much during our stay; it sunk several
times from 28<sup><small>i</small></sup>
4<sup><small>l</small></sup> to 27<sup><small>i</small></sup>
10<sup><small>l</small></sup>, and even
27<sup><small>i</small></sup> 9,5<sup><small>l</small></sup>.
With respect to the atmospheric constitution, it is not unlike
that of the latter end of autumn in our climates.</p>
<p>The mineral productions of the Isle Maria are not numerous;
the general granitic nature of the soil, excludes, as I may say,
every other substance. The granites which we collected are of two
kinds: the one of a dark green colour with small specks, forms
the rocks of the south point and of the south-east: this kind is
also seen on the southern coast of Oysters Bay, and towards the
north point of the same bay, but only near the farther part:
finally, it appears to be the base of all the rocks that are not
high.</p>
<p>The second kind of granite which is seen on Isle Maria, is
remarkable for its large crystals of yellowish feldspar, and for
the greenish colour of the mica or dust which is found intermixed
between the crystals of feldspar. This beautiful granite, which
M. Bailly has since found in the Furneaux isles also, I first
observed in the Bay Ri&eacute;dl&eacute;, under the hill of the
tombs. All the masses of rock in the vicinity of the second
rivulet of fresh water, are formed of this kind of granite, and
all the high peaks of the N.E. part seem to be of the same
substance.</p>
<p>Among the sorts of free stone we also remark two kinds: the
one of a close substance and fine grain, of a homogeneous
quality; whitish and sparkling; form masses of a very large size;
obstruct the valleys which leave the granitic rocks between them
some of the breakers appear to be composed of this freestone.</p>
<p>The other kind of stone is brittle and calcareous; it forms
horizontal beds, which lie in a regular manner on the summit of
the granitic ramparts on the eastern shore; their origin seems to
have been produced by a long succession of calcareous
deposits.</p>
<p>Among the mineral productions of the Isle Maria, we must not
omit to mention a sort of iron ore of a peculiar kind, of a fine
red colour and of an earthy grain. It is found on many parts of
the island, and supplies the natives with the principal
ingredient which they use to colour their hair red.</p>
<p>The vegetative earth, though of little depth on the hills and
mountains, is, on the contrary, of considerable depth in the
valleys, very rich, black, and greasy; and when it is much heated
it becomes red, which indicates its having a strong acid
property.</p>
<p>In the marshy places which are found near the north shore of
Oysters Bay, this same earth, formed almost entirely of
decomposed vegetation, has an appearance similar to that of a
sort of turf.</p>
<p>The sands of the shore of the Bay Ri&eacute;dl&eacute;, are
blacker, and contain a great proportion of the decomposition of
marine plants: that of Oysters Bay, mingled with the remains of
shells, is whiter, finer, and more calcareous.</p>
<p>There does not appear to be any trace of volcanic substance on
these shores.</p>
<p>Vegetation does not appear to be so healthy on the Isle Maria
as on Diemen's Land: the eastern coast is too steep and
mountainous, and too much exposed to the rage of the winds to be
very fertile: that on the west is either too sandy or too marshy.
Nevertheless, taking it all together, this western side of the
island is pleasant enough in its appearance: it seems to be well
wooded, and in some places the grass is of the finest quality.
Among the plants peculiar to this isle is a new kind of Typha, of
the stalks of which the inhabitants of the Isle Maria make their
canoes, which gives them a great superiority over those of the
channel of Dentrecasteaux.</p>
<p>In the data of mammiferous animals, I only saw one kind of
Dasyurus, that was scarcely as large as a mouse. I obtained one
that was alive, in exchange for a few trifles, of a savage who
was just going to kill and eat it.</p>
<p>The marine mammali&aelig; were very numerous on these shores;
and we saw great shoals of dolphins and whales, and innumerable
legions of sea-cows. These last animals alone give some
importance to the Isle Maria. We shall hereafter have occasion to
return to this subject.</p>
<p>The birds almost all belong to the different species which we
had observed in the channel, with the exception of a kind of
perroquet and a beautiful bulfinch, which we saw for the first
time on the Isle Maria.</p>
<p>Among the reptiles, we caught some different kinds of lizards;
one of them belonged to a new genus, and was not unlike the
Scincus, or land crocodile.</p>
<p>Of fish I found several new species, as, also of insects and
crustaceous animals: among these last was a large kind of Maia or
crab, of which me caught such numbers every day, that they were
distributed to the crews of both ships.</p>
<p>Of testaceous animals our collections were enriched with the
wavy volute (<i>Voluta Undulosa</i>, N.) several Turbo, a
rose-coloured Casea, of the most extraordinary beauty, with can
elegant Telinus, and a great variety of Phasianell&aelig;, which
formed extensive banks on different points of Oysters Bay, with
an intrinsic shell, which seemed to constitute a new genus
neighbouring on the Trochus, and of which a somewhat similar
species of fossil is found at Grignon, near Paris. Among the soft
zoophytes I have collected three new kinds of sponge, an elegant
Medusa, several Ascidi&aelig;, and a beautiful Actinius; but I
must repeat, that the enumeration of these different objects,
however succinct it might be, would lead me much farther than the
nature of my present work would admit.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-20" id="ch-20"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>
<p align="center"><i><b>The Eastern Coast of Diemen's Land. The
Straits of Banks and of Bass.</b></i><br>
<br>
<small>[<i>From the</i> 28<i>th of February to the</i> 29<i>th of
March,</i> 1802]</small></p>
<br>
<p>WE have seen in the preceding Chapter, that the islots
Taillefer lay off the Schouten Island: there are seven of them,
five being only so many large rocks that rise more or less above
the waves. Beaten continually by the stormy sea, these, islots
are naked, barren, broken, whimsically shaped, of a dark reddish
colour; one only of them, which is the largest, has a few stunted
languishing trees; the substance of these islots seems to be
granitic, like that of Schouten. Island, from which they are
separated by only a narrow channel, but which nevertheless is
very deep.</p>
<p>Schouten Island itself, is in every respect one of the most
remarkable points of these regions: it is entirely composed of
lofty black mountains, which leave between them several deep
valleys: their declivities toward these valleys are rapid and
smooth, and less steep towards the sea; but nevertheless, always
inaccessible. The eastern side of these lofty and barren hills,
is absolutely without the least appearance Of verdure: their
summits may in many parts be distinguished by granitic peaks,
which one would be tempted to take for so many columns raised by
the hands of men.</p>
<p>Towards the north part, of the island, one of these rocks
bends so as to form the appearance of an immense hook. A deep sea
washes this terrific coast.</p>
<p>Between the Schouten Island and Freycinet Peninsula is
situated Geography Strait, which we described in the preceding
Chapter.</p>
<p>Diemen's Land is terminated on this point by a large cape two
or three hundred feet in perpendicular height: this we named Cape
Degerando, in honour of the estimable scholar of that name.</p>
<p>Beyond this cape the lands rise higher and higher: two groups
of mountains seem to spring from the bosom of the waters: these
are joined at the base by a low sandy isthmus, which can only be
seen at a short distance; farther off they appear like two
distinct islands. These high mountains are primitive and very
large; their colour is that of brown earth; the declivities are
rapid, naked, and cleft in many parts: here and there on the
surface are a few sharp points, in several places their borders
are formed like ramparts.</p>
<p>The Bay Thouin is narrow and not deep, open to the east, and
lays between two masses of mountains which project out a good way
beyond, forming two large capes at the entrance or mouth of the
bay. That on the south projecting farthest, and being most
remarkable for its height and the grandeur of its form, we gave
this the name of Cape Forestier: it is situated in latitude
42&deg; 11' 23".</p>
<p>From Cape Forestier as far as that which we had named Cape
Lodi, the coat forms several, small sandy creeks, In this last
space the lands are not so high as those on, the south, but
become again more elevated, towards the Point St. Patrick, of
Furneaux: in this part they, seem well wooded, and pleasant
valleys may be distinguished, between the mountains. All this
part of the coast was covered with fires and smoke when we passed
it. From Point St. Patrick to that of St. Helena, the lands
continue high, and, rise in elevations, one above another, the
last of which lay far back in the interior of the country. Some
peaks, appear at distances on this long chain of mountains: one
of them, we named the Peak of Arcole: its top is very pointed,
and appears in form like a three-sided pyramid. The most
remarkable of these peaks seems to be above 513 toises in height:
it rises like an immense cone five or six leagues in the interior
of the lands. We named this Peak Champagny: it is situated to the
south-west of the Point St. Helena.</p>
<p>At a short distance to the south of this same point, in
41&ordm; 23' 30" south, is a little island, which deserves the
more particular mention, as, in times when, most of the springs
of fresh water on the main land, were dried up, it could furnish
that article to our unfortunate companions, whom, as we shall
soon see, we were forced to abandon on these inhospitable shores.
We named this Isle Maurouard, from the name of the cadet who
commanded the long-boat at the time when this disaster
happened.</p>
<p>The Bay of Fires, of Furneaux, occupies the space between the
Point St. Helena and that of the Eddystone: it, is large, not
very deep, and open to all the winds from the east. The shores of
this long bay consist of lofty mountains, covered, to their
summits with verdure: Cape Eddystone is itself, very high and
steep.</p>
<p>From this point to Cape Portland the coast sinks rapidly: in
many places it is only, formed of level and sandy, downs;
however, there are some mountains in the interior or the country,
but the farther we go north the more distant, they, are from the
sea shore.</p>
<p>A short distance beyond the Eddystone is a narrow creek, but
very deep: it is entirely full of breakers.</p>
<p>Farther on we see two groups of rocks, a mile in extent, and
of very odd appearance; one might almost suppose them, to be the
ruins of two large villages, and this illusion is so perfect,
that we fancy, we see the steeples of these villages, which are
represented by the lofty points of granite that rise, above the
other rocks.</p>
<p>From Cape Degerando to the Eddystone Point, the eastern coast
of Diemen's Land; follows the general direction from north to
south; but beyond the Eddystone it runs. N.N.W and S.S.E. as far
as off Cape Portland, where it terminates to the N.E. This part
of the coast is very low, and the navigation dangerous, from a
great number of rocks, many of which, are level with the
water.</p>
<p>Cape Portland itself is very low, and almost under waves, as
we shall have to demonstrate more particularly hereafter: it
forms the south point of the entrance of the straits of banks.
Let us rest a moment at the mouth of this strait, to conclude all
that concerns the reconnoitring of the eastern coast of Diemen's
Land.</p>
<p>Furneaux was the first who discovered and visited this coast
in 1773 but retarded by bad weather, he could not complete to
advantage the work in which he had engaged. We do not find,
besides, in his relation, any detail either respecting the
topography, or the navigation of this part of Diemen's Land; he
has even neglected to make those observations which were
necessary to the construction of his chart.</p>
<p>Captain Flinders in 1779 [<i>sic</i>] lengthened this coast
near enough; but however, he made no alteration in the work of
Furneaux, and did not himself give any nautical or topographic
particulars on the subject of this part of Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>Our work will henceforth leave nothing to be desired on the
subject: for the unfortunate circumstances which I have to
relate, placed us in a situation that we returned to this coast
several times, and explored, the whole of it so near, that it
impossible for any particulars of consequence to escape us.</p>
<p>The reader will doubtless recollect, that on the 27th of
February, in the morning, we set sail from Oysters Bay to explore
the eastern coast of the Isle Maria. Until this time we had been
fortunate in all our labours on Diemen's Land, and we hoped still
that our good luck would not forsake us, but we were much
mistaken, for we had no sooner doubled Cape Peron, than the winds
became contrary; and the strong currents bore us away to the
south; and when the wind seemed to be changing in our favour, it
ceased on a sudden, and the most dead calm kept us immoveable: on
the surface of the water. All these united obstacles opposed us
in such a manner, that we, did not reach the coast of Schouten
Island until the 6th of March in the morning.</p>
<p>During the whole of these eight days we were almost
continually enveloped in a thick fog and moist atmosphere, so
that our two ships could scarcely see each other, and several
times we were obliged to make the necessary signals to the
Naturalist with the guns. All our decks ran with water, even in
the day, and during the night the more condensed mists dissolved
into such a penetrating moisture, that nothing could escape its
power. The temperature was from 10&deg; to 14&deg;, though we
were still in the hot season of these countries. This deplorable
state of the atmosphere much increased the suffering of those who
were yet sick.</p>
<p>On the 6th of March, in the course of the morning, we passed
at a great distance the Schouten Island and the islots Taillefer.
About noon we were off Cape Forestier, when our geographer, M.
Boulanger, went in the long-boat; commanded by M. Maurouard, to
take a nearer survey of all the particulars of the coast. The
ship was to take a parallel direction to that of the long-boat,
and not to lose sight of it; but M. Boulanger had scarcely been
gone a quarter of an hour, when our commander, all at once,
without any kind of apparent reason, stood out farther to sea,
and we soon lost sight of the boat. It was not till night that we
put about again towards the land: a strong breeze had sprung up
which blew fresher every moment, and our proceedings were very
undecided: night came upon us, and we lost sight of the coast on
which we had so lately forsaken our unfortunate companions.</p>
<p>The two following days were spent in seeking them, but we
could not discover any thing of either men or boat: to complete
the misfortune, the Naturalist was separated from us by the
squalls which we had experienced in the night of the 7th instant.
This day we sent out our chaloupe: she made a useless cruize, and
when she returned, the sea was so rough that it was with great
difficulty we could get her again on board: two of her planks
were stove in against the side of the ship.</p>
<p>In so critical a situation, our commander called together the
principal officers on one side, and the muster and his mates on
the other, to consider what was most proper to be done. "To seek
our companions", was the unanimous reply. This search was the
more difficult, from the absence of the Naturalist, the want of
the long-boat, the damage of the chaloupe, and the extreme
roughness of the sea. Under these circumstances, we had no other
means of making the search than with the ship itself; and it was
certainly a very dangerous enterprise to steer with a large
vessel close along the bendings of a wild and unknown shore. Our
commander was ill, and shut himself in his cabin, after having
given the command to his lieutenant, M. H. Freycinet, and ordered
him to make the search required, by the crew and principal
officers. All the day on the 9th of March we were anxiously
working along this terrific shore, and M. Freycinet managed this
business with a degree of coolness, intrepidity, and precision,
that was deserving of the greatest praise.</p>
<p>This search was notwithstanding as fruitless as those
preceding; and as there remained no hope of finding our friends
except towards the north, we bent our course fly the straits of
Bass. During our stay on this coast, we had time to be convinced
that the sea is generally very rough, the least wind is
sufficient to make it absolutely tempestuous, and unsafe for
boats. A wind from the offing no sooner began to rise than we
immediately saw the waves foaming up to the very horizon, and in
a few moments the swells were so great, and followed each other
in such quick succession, that our ship laboured very much;
notwithstanding it still was the fine season these climates.</p>
<p>While we were bearing away towards the strait, we discovered,
all at once, on the 10th of March, a small ship bearing downs
upon us. We joined her, and her captain coming on board us, we
learnt that he had left Port Jackson twenty days, to take
sea-cows on the shores of the Isle Maria: that the English colony
on New Holland was in a very flourishing state, and already
supplied not only all the necessaries, but many of the luxuries
of life; and also, that we had been expected there every day for
some time; that orders had been given to the English government
for our reception, with all the consideration and respect due to
the nature of our mission, and the dignity of the nation to which
we belonged. In return for this agreeable news, we told the
English captain of the loss of our chaloupe, and requested, that
if he discovered any trace of our unfortunate companions, he
would give them all the assistance in his power, which he
promised. We descried and pointed out to hint the situation of
the islot of sea-cows in Bay Fleurieu, as one of the places most
favourable for his present pursuit: we then parted and continued
our way to the north.</p>
<p>We were again impeded by the same obstacles as when on the
eastern coast of the Isle Maria, and it was not till the morning
of the 17th that we saw the Isles Furneaux, which form with the
north-east point of Diemen's Land, one of the passes of the great
strait of Bass, of which I must say a few words before I
proceed.</p>
<p>It is sometimes the case in geographical discoveries, as with
discoveries in other sciences, that after having escaped the
efforts of genius, all the researches and perseverance Of the
learned scholar, they at length present themselves, as it were,
to those who have never made these researches, of busied
themselves in such studies and labours. Thus the discovery of the
famous strait which separates New Holland from Diemen's Land,
attempted in vain by so many celebrated navigators, was reserved
for the surgeon of an English ship. And what is perhaps not less
astonishing, that the discovery was not made till the year 1798,
that is to say, ten years after the establishment of the colony
of Port Jackson, notwithstanding its proximity to this
settlement.</p>
<p>This strait is about 50 leagues wide from north to south and
of nearly an equal length from east to west: the eastern month is
considerably lessened by the Two-Sisters, the Furneaux Isles
whose number and size are not yet thoroughly known, the Isle
Clarke, Isle Preservation, the Isle Swan, and the little islet
belonging to it. Between Diemen's Land, the Isle Swan and its
islot on one part, and all the other isles on the other part,
there is a channel ten miles in breadth: it is to this principal
pass that captain Flinders, who first discovered it, thought
proper to give the name of Banks's Straits. Between the isles
Furneaux to the north, and the promontory of Wilson, which forms
the southern point of New Holland, and which projects above
twenty miles towards the interior of the strait, is situated
Kent's group, the numerous rocks of the promontory, the pyramid,
and several other very dangerous rocks, which obstruct the great
path north of the mouth of the strait. To the west appear the
Hunter Islands, flanked with a great number of rocks, shoals, and
terrible reefs. More towards the north, and exactly in the middle
of the western mouth of the strait, is situated the large island
King, the islots of the New-year, the Elephants' rock, and
several reefs which are connected with the particular plan of
this group. I shall have occasion in the course of this work,
successively to describe in detail each of these lands; it will
suffice at present to observe, that abstracting all the physical
circumstances, besides those which I have just mentioned, the
navigation of the straits of Bass must be difficult and
dangerous; and when I add that strong currents prevail in this
strait, and that it is subject to terrible gales from the
south-west, the reader will be less surprised at the succession
of imminent perils to which our ships were exposed every time we
entered this passage: he will also be able to judge of the
frequency and cause of the shipwrecks, of which we shall have to
give an account in another place.</p>
<p>I have already said, that on the 17th of March we first came
in sight of the Furneaux Islands; these are very high mountains,
which in favourable weather may be discovered easily at the
distance of twelve or fifteen leagues at sea: they present, in
every respect, the same wild scene as the Schouten Island. One of
the following chapters will give a more particular account of
them.</p>
<p>We had no sooner got into the strait of Banks than the sky
became covered with dark and heavy clouds: however, we pursued
our course. During the night, rain and wind succeeded each other
without intermission.</p>
<p>On the 18th we sailed along all that part of the coast which
lays between Cape Portland and Waterhouse Island. This part of
Diemen's Land, as we have before observed, is extremely low, and
almost under water in many places; but in the interior of the
country may be perceived a lofty chain of mountains, in the
direction from the N.N.W. to the S.S.E.; a circumstance
constituting a sufficient reason for the prodigious difference
between the S.E. and N.E. points of Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>Until this time we had some hope of finding our long-boat or
meeting with our consort; but after having in vain spent two days
in search of them, we despaired seeing them again through the
remainder of our voyage, and the event but too well justified our
fears on the subject.</p>
<p>In the course of the day on the 20th we saw a great number of
dolphins, and several whales from forty to fifty feet in length.
I neglected to observe in another place, that off Cape Lodi, we
had before seen an immense shoal of large fish.</p>
<p>From the 21st to the 26th of March we experienced one of the
strangest gales that we had ever encountered in these seas;
several of our sails were carried away by the squalls, and we had
nearly been lost in the night of the 21st on the Isles of
Furneaux. To escape this misfortune we were obliged,
notwithstanding the force of the tempest, to carry all our sails,
and in the course of the morning of the 22d instant, we succeeded
in clearing the strait by the pass between Kent's group and the
promontory. At nine o'clock in the morning we doubled the
pyramid, an enormous rock, which at a distance has the appearance
of a gothic ruin: then standing right in to the west of the isles
of Kent's group, we succeeded in doubling them, though with much
difficulty, luffing up very near these islands. These terrific
granitic rocks presented a majestic and dreadful spectacle, naked
and barren: the roaring waves broke against them with such noise
and force, as seemed to threaten every instant to bury them under
torrents of foam. The chart of capt. Flinders, although generally
correct, is incomplete in this particular, for he points out but
twelve of these islots, and we counted sixteen at least.</p>
<p>On the 24th of March the storm still continued, and on this
day we saw an immense number of whales. I have already mentioned
the abundant number of these large fish which are seen near the
shores of New Holland: I shall hereafter enlarge on the subject
of these extraordinary animals.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 27th the hurricane ceased, and we
hastened to enter the straits again, as we were impatient to make
the south-west coast of New Holland, one of the principal objects
of our mission. In the course of the morning we ranged a part of
the land, which, from the Ramshead, extends as far as the
promontory of Wilson: they are not so low as the chart of
Flinders seems to make them.</p>
<p>In the environs of Kent's group we discovered a few more
islots, which are not marked in the chart: one of them was in
shape and colour like a brioche*, and we called it by that
name.</p>
<blockquote>[* Brioche, a sort of French bun.]</blockquote>
<p>In the middle of the day on the 28th, we were in sight of the
islots which project a-head of Wilson's promontory: we
successively surveyed about twenty of them, large and small, but
all steep, barren, and broken by the waves. The English chart
does not mark near so many, and therefore, in this, respect, is
defective: it is still more so in the situation in which it
places the promontory: in this chart it is marked as being in
38&deg; 57' south latitude, and in 144&deg; 41' east longitude
from the meridian of Paris: while our own observations place the
most southern extremity of this promontory in 39&deg; 10' 30"
south latitude, and 144&deg; 20' east longitude. So great a
mistake must be ascribed to the incorrectness of the means used
by capt. Flinders to determine this important point. This
celebrated navigator says, indeed, that Bass not having in his
cruize round the promontory made any exact observation, he
himself could not determine the situation of it but by the
reckoning; and this method, as Flinders observes, cannot be much
depended on in latitudes where such strong currents prevail as in
the straits of which we are here giving an account. Before I
conclude this article I must observe that the islots of Kent's
group also appeared to us, in this chart, to be marked as lying
too far towards the east: but I can only slightly take notice of
all the results of our observations; they will be given by
Freycinet, with the particulars which their importance requires.
But let us return to our subject.</p>
<p>The lands of the promontory are very high, and present two or
three elevations of mountains which rise towards the interior of
the country. All the length of this coast there is a great deal
of water, and the navigation appeared to us to have no other
dangers than those occasioned by the currents, and the proximity
of the islots and rocks which I have noticed before.</p>
<p>The promontory of Wilson forms a large cape in the West, to
which Bass gave no particular name: this cape is scarcely marked
in the chart of Flinders. A-head of this cape are six large
islots, one of which is nearly a mile and, a half in length.</p>
<p>Directly to the north is a very large and deep bay, which we
named Bay Patterson, in honour of the worthy English voyager and
scholar of that name, and the intimate friend of Mr. Bass.
Several lofty peaks were to be seen on the east coast of this
bay, and in the distance we perceived a chain of high
mountains.</p>
<p>On the 29th of March, at day-break we began to explore a
second bay, which is also, like the preceding, to the north-west
of the promontory; this was named the Bay of Venus, from a vessel
commanded by capt. Bass, and which will make part of our subject
hereafter. The lands of this second bay are high towards the two
points, but all those which form the contour are much lower. In
the interior of the continent we see the same long chain of
mountains of which the lands of the promontory seems to be the
extreme point.</p>
<p>On the same day in the afternoon, we were off the isle which
closes the fine port Western, discovered by Bass, but of which
the particular geography was completed by our consort, as we
shall hereafter see.</p>
<p>Here finish the labours of the English navigators, and at this
same point began our long exploration of Napoleon's Land.</p>

<p align="center"><i><b>Napoleon's Land.</b></i> [From about
Spencer Gulf, S.A. to Western Port, Vic.]<br>
<br>
<small>[<i>From the</i> 29<i>th of March to the</i> 8<i>th of
May,</i> 1802.]</small></p>
<br>
<p>UNDER the name of the south coast and south-west coast of New
Holland, is generally comprised all that part Of this continent
which stretches from the 33d to the 39th south latitude, and
which from the 112&deg;, stretches out as far to the east as the
144th degree of east longitude, thus forming an immense scarp of
800 or 900 leagues in length, of which the two extremities are
connected, the one with Cape Leuwin to the west, and the other to
Wilson's promontory towards the south.</p>
<p>Of this large space, that part which from Cape Leuwin to the
isles St. Pierre and St. Francis, was all that was at all known
at the time of our departure from Europe. Discovered by the Dutch
in the year 1627, it had been visited in our days by Vancouver
and Dentrecasteaux; but this last navigator not having gone
beyond the isles St. Pierre and St. Francis, which form the
eastern boundary of Nuyt's Land, and the English not having
carried their researches towards the south farther than Port
Western, it consequently follows, that the whole of the coast
laying between this last point of Nuyt's Land, was entirely
unknown at the time we arrived at these shores; and as the point
in question was nothing less than to resolve by this exploration
the problem of New Holland being a continent, and to discover if
there was any large river belonging to that continent, we every
one felt an additional degree of zeal and courage.</p>
<p>On the 30th of March, at day-break, we steered towards the
shore, which we soon made. A large cape which was called Cape
Richelieu, projects out a-head, and forms the entrance of a deep
bay, which we named Bay Tallyrand. On the eastern coast of this
bay, and almost at the farther part, is a port, of which every
winding may be perceived from the mast-head: we described it by
the name of Debut Port; but having afterwards learned that it had
been already more particularly reconnoitred by the English brig
the Lady Nelson, and that at that time it was named Port Phillip,
we preserved this name with so much the more pleasure, as it
reminded us of that of the founder of a colony in which we
received such generous and effective assistance.</p>
<p>At three o'clock we were off a large cape, which is situated
in 38&deg; 42' latitude, and 141&deg; 49'; this we named Cape
Suffrein. The lands here are high, but rise still higher as we
steer towards Cape Marengo, which place terminated our Survey of
this coast.</p>
<p>On the 31st we stood in for the land from the first appearance
of day-break. The sky was serene and clear, the sea smooth, and
the wind favourable: so many advantages gave us opportunity of
ranging the coast very near, and thus our geographic observations
were made with the utmost precision. All that portion of land
which from Cape Marengo stretches along the western shore as far
as Cape Desaix, a space of about twelve miles, is very high, and
Cape Desaix itself is well wooded: but at this point the aspect
of New Holland changes all at once, to a steep beach almost
perpendicular, of a greyish or yellowish hue, without any
appearance of verdure or vegetation, which forming a number of
small capes and little creeks of no great depth, describes in the
distance an appearance of a long chain of regular fortifications,
or rather something like the gigantic wall which separates China
from Tartary. Cape Volney, near which we were about noon, is
remarkable for a chain of rocks which stretches a good way out.
Beyond this we discovered a portion of land which seemed detached
from the main land, and which we named Isle Latraille, in honour
of the worthy and learned naturalist of that name.</p>
<p>As we continued our course along the shore, we came a-head of
a peak of a conic form, to which we gave the name of the Peak of
Reconnoissance, and the nearest cape we called Mount Tabor
Cape.</p>
<p>At this period the barometer remained at from
28<sup><small>i</small></sup> 7<sup><small>l</small></sup> to
28<sup><small>i</small></sup> 8<sup><small>l</small></sup>, which
was higher than we had observed it until this time: the
atmosphere is also very serene and clear. The thermometer, in the
course of the day, varied from 13&deg; to 15&deg;, and in the
course of the night sunk to 10&ordm;.</p>
<p>A-head of Cape Desaix, in the Bay Daubenton, and at a short
distance to the west of Cape Folard, we perceived smoke in
different directions&mdash;an almost certain indication of
inhabitants being on these inhospitable shores. We observed
several kinds of thrushes, go&euml;lands, boobies, and puffins;
but, with the exception of some flying fish, all sea animals seem
to have deserted this coast, which affords them no shelter, and
against which the troubled waves beat incessantly. Our
collections were therefore confined to a few kinds of new and
singular fucus. One of these, which I described by the name of
<i>Fucus phylophorus</i>, seemed to me to be particularly
remarkable for the curious disposition of the leaves: on each
side of a large flat stalk grow, at equal distances, plain
pointed leaves; from the edges of these leaves proceed others of
a similar shape, and each supported by a separate bulb: in some
instances, even a third rank of leaves proceed from these
secondary leaves. I could not determine the precise end of this
sort of generation, which is so much the more singular, as the
real organs of the reproduction of the plant, the globules,
common to most kinds of the focus, are very much spread in this
species, and grow on a long pedicle at the base of the
mother-leaves.</p>
<p>At eight in the morning, on the 1st of April, we discovered a
small isle, which we named Isle Fourcroy. This island is almost
quadrangular, slightly indented on the edges of the shore: it is
low, regularly level, of a sad greyish colour, sterile like the
sea shore of the continent: it is situated in 38&deg; 26' 15"
south latitude, and 139&deg; 52' east longitude. A remarkable
cape appears off this isle, which we named Cape Reaumur.</p>
<p>About noon we had got into a very large bay, which was called
Tourville Bay. We soon discovered another blackish island, which,
like the former, was steep, barren, and low, separated by a small
space from two islots of the same description. We named it the
Dragon Island, because of its whimsical form; for towards one of
the points it is shaped like the half-opened mouth of an enormous
reptile. The waves which wash its shores, and the islots which
belong to it, abound with innumerable unfledged sea-fowl, too
young to make use of their wings; these animals appear for the
space of above three quarters of a league, as if heaped one upon
another. Their prodigious number, the deafening and confused
noise which they continually make, the tender solicitude of the
parent birds, which fly in thousands over the heads of their
young, at the same time screaming with terror at the sight of our
vessel; the strange appearance of the islots which serve as a
refuge to those hordes of sea birds; all together present an
interesting and picturesque scene.</p>
<p>Cape Montaigne terminates west of the large Bay Tourville:
beyond this appear the barren shores of Cape Duquesne, which are
low and of a yellowish colour; but now the darkness made our
farther survey very uncertain, and therefore we suspended our
researches when we came in sight of this cape.</p>
<p>All that part of the coast which we had just reconnoitred,
appeared low and barren, like that which we had seen on the
preceding evening; we must, however, except the part which lies
between the Dragon Island and Cape Duquesne, where the land here
and there presents a few stunted shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>At the farther part of the Bay Tourville, we again observed
large quantities of smoke.</p>
<p>The barometer on this day was at from
28<sup><small>i</small></sup> 6<sup><small>l</small></sup> to
28<sup><small>i</small></sup> 7<sup><small>l</small></sup>, and
the thermometer gave 15&deg; as the mean term of heat, a
temperature similar to that of the spring in our own country.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 2.&mdash;Beyond Cape Duquesne appears the great
Bay Descartes, terminated towards the west by another cape,
which, from the name of the immortal author of the Spirit of
Laws, we called Cape Montesquieu. It was nine o'clock in the
morning when we came off the Bay Descartes, and we began to enter
it, when we were becalmed, and compelled to suspend our
operations.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that since we had made the land on
this coast, the same phenomenon had happened every day at the
same hour. A brisk wind from the N.N.E. and varying; to the N.E.
sprang up at break of day, and insensibly abated from eight to
nine, and from nine to ten o'clock, and about eleven or twelve a
dead calm succeeded. Soon after, the wind changed from the east
to the southeast, blowing fresh, and thus we were enabled to
extend our labours and researches. Probably it may be attributed
in a gnat degree to the breezes from the east and by south, that
every attempt made to reconnoitre the coast, until this time,
coming from the north-west to the south-east, have always been in
vain.</p>
<p>We continued our course the instant the calm ceased. The sea
broke violently against the white sandy clowns which form the
beach. Beyond these downs, three or four leagues up the country,
we perceived three peaks, the largest we named Mount St. Bernard:
it has some resemblance to the Table Mountain. A neighbouring
cape we called by the same, Cape Mount St. Bernard.</p>
<p>While we thus pursued our discoveries, as we imagined in
perfect security, we perceived on a sudden a long chain of
breakers, which we escaped by observing the reflection of the sun
sparkling on their surface. We were so near that We had scarcely
time to stand eastward on the larboard tack, and double them at a
very little distance. During all these man&oelig;uvres we dared
not heave the lead for fear of alarming the seamen. This reef was
in fact a frightful spectacle; did breakers extended a length of
several miles off the coast, which was of a yellowish sterile
appearance. These rocks were indented like the teeth of a saw,
and were scarcely to be distinguished in the midst of the foaming
waves and the eddies. Towards the western point of these
breakers, which we named the Carpenters, are two small whitish
islots. Cape Boufflers, in sight of which we ended our researches
on the 2d of April, is situated some miles to the north-west.
Divers kinds of go&euml;lands and sternes were the only animals
we observed, and on the waves we perceived several Medus&aelig;,
besides a large sea-cow which swam sleeping on the surface.
Towards the farther end of the Bay Descartes, we saw the smoke of
some fires rising from behind the downs; but in general the
barren nature of the whole of this coast must drive from thence
all the human race, as it does not appear to produce sufficient
but for a very small number.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 3<i>d,</i> 4<i>th,</i> 5<i>th, and</i>
6<i>th.</i>&mdash;From Cape Belidor to Cape Boufflers, the coast
is diversified with a number of pleasant little creeks; it then
sinks farther in, to form the Bay D'Estaing, terminated to the
north-west by a large cape which we named Cape Buffon. From this
point as far as the Bay Rivoli, in a space of above forty miles,
the continent has no bay, nor any kind of shelter even for the
smallest vessel. Exposed on every side to the impetuous winds
from the south-west, and beat against incessantly by the waves of
the Immense Southern Ocean, this part of New Holland is still
more terrific than those which we have hitherto described. An
immense surf broke the whole length of this shore, making a
dreadful noise, which was heard even in the time of a dead calm.
On several points where we approached nearer the coast, we
observed this surf foaming under the surge of the waves: the most
hideous sterility is seen in every direction, and there is not
the least appearance of there being even the smallest stream of
fresh water. We may judge of the wretched situation, of
navigators who are so unfortunate as to be lost on these
frightful shores.</p>
<p>Such however had nearly been our fate in the course of the day
on the 6th of April. At three o'clock in the afternoon, at a
moment when we were most occupied in our geographic labours, we
were close to a shoal of rocks so level with the surface of the
water, that we could not perceive them, till the instant we were
almost a-ground.</p>
<p>During this last part of our researches, (that is to say),
from the 3d to the 7th of April, we observed some sea-cows on the
waves, also a new species of Bero&euml;, (<i>Bero&euml;
dactyl&ouml;ides</i>, N.), a species of Salpa, (<i>Salpa
oct&oelig;dra</i>, N.); and in the evening of the 4th of April,
the sea appeared covered with a beautiful species of portune,
which was particularly remarkable for the rose-coloured head, and
the bright blue colour of the eyes. I have described it by the
name of <i>Portunus cyanophtalmus</i>, N.</p>
<p>The temperature of the sea on the surface, was at the time at
14&deg; of Reaumur. Independent of these animals, on the morning
of the 5th of April, we saw a numerous shoal of dolphins; and on
the same day we met a shoal of scombres, a species of fish of the
mackerel kind, (<i>Scomber thynnus</i>, Lacepede). The sea,
during the whole of the night, was extremely phosphorescent; the
sky was dark and cloudy; and the barometer was only at 28&deg;
3'. These atmospheric variations seemed to correspond with the
changes of the wind, which was at that time N.W., and which
consequently brought with it the fogs from the Indian sea. At the
farther end of the Bay of Rivoli, we observed the smoke of some
fires on the coast.</p>
<p><i>7th of April.</i>&mdash;This bay appears in form of a large
oval, which goes eight or ten miles into the land, and is
terminated to the south by Cape Lannes, to the north by Cape
Jaffa: near this last point is a large chain of reefs, which much
contracts the entrance. About 50 miles from Cape, Jaffa, is
another bay, the mouth of which is from six to seven leagues in
extent, and goes still more into the lands; we named this bay,
Lacepede. Cape Bernoulli, which forms the eastern point, has a
very dangerous reef runs out a-head, which, as we approached,
brought us into a depth of but six fathoms rocky bottom; it was
not without difficulty that we doubled this reef. To describe the
particular constitution of this new part of New Holland, we must,
if it is possible, increase the inhospitable appearance of,
monotony and sterility, which is so general on these shores. The
human race seemed, nevertheless, numerous on this coast; if we
might judge from the numberless fires which we saw at the farther
end of Lacepede Bay. Innumerable flights of cormorants, the
inhabitants of some islots near Cape Bernoulli, appear to be the
exclusive possessors of these terrific rocks.</p>

<br>
<b><small>11. Seven Topographic Profiles of Napoleon's Land,
Taken from the Ship</small></b></p>
<p>On the 8th of April at noon, we reckoned ourselves to be in
36&deg; 1' 10" south latitude, and 137&deg; 7' 40" longitude. We
had now reconnoitred a length of coast of 944 miles, measuring
all the headings of the shore, from Wilson's promontory to the
point where we now were. Soon after this hour, and at a little
distance from Cape Villars, we perceived towards the bounds of
the horizon, a shoal of dolphins, of such a great length, that at
first, we thought them to be an immense chain of reefs; but their
swift progress soon convinced us of our error, and we then began
to think of making war on them, while the poor animals seemed
inclined to assist our wishes; several detachments, like an
advanced guard, preceded the principal body; these doubled oar
ship very near: the quickness of their evolutions, the boldness
of their leaps, engaged our attention so much the more, as we had
never before seen such an amazing number of these large fish at
one time. It appeared difficult to us to imagine how these
thousands of dolphins could find sufficient food in seas which
seemed not at all to abound in fish of a smaller size, or how
they could play and sport without dashing one another to pieces,
from being so astonishingly crowded together. In a few minutes we
killed nine immense large ones with our harpoons, and such a
quantity of fish, seemed to us like a gift from heaven; for at
this time the scurvy had begun the most terrible ravages among
us, and the salt provisions, which had become almost putrid, and
to which we had been reduced for several months, increased this
dreadful distemper every day more and more.</p>
<p>We had but just finished our fishing, when signal was made at
the mast-head, of a sail being in sight. At first, every one
thought it was the Naturalist, and our joy was general; but as we
came nearer the ship, we soon perceived, that it was not our
consort. As she made for us with all sail set, she was presently
under our stern, when she hoisted the English flag, and we at the
same time hoisted French colours, and lay to, in imitation of
their example; the English captain now hailed us, and asked if we
were not one of the two ships which had sailed from France, to
make discoveries in the Southern Hemisphere? On our answering in
the affirmative, he hoisted out a boat and came on board us; we
now found that he was captain Flinders, the same who had already
made the circumnavigation of Diemen's Land: that the name of his
ship was the Investigator; and that it was then eight months
since he had sailed from Europe, with the intention of
reconnoitring the whole coast of New Holland and the archipelago
in the South Seas: he had been for the last three months off the
coast of Nuyt's Land; and having been prevented by contrary
winds, he had not been able to get at the back of the Isles St.
Francis and St. Pierre, as he had intended. We also understood,
that at the time of his departure from England, he had another
ship with him, from which he had been separated by a storm, and
that a few days preceding, hit had been attacked by the same
squall of wind from the equinox, which had driven us into
imminent danger in the strait of Bass, and had lost his
long-boat, with eight of his best seamen and his first officer.
This singular coincidence in misfortune, may serve as a proof of
the perils always attendant on expeditions of this sort.</p>
<p>In giving us all these particulars, captain Flinders shewed
great reserve on the subject of his particular operations; we
only learnt from some of his seamen, that he suffered much from
those winds from the south, which had been so favourable to us;
we now knew properly how to appreciate the excellent instructions
we ourselves had received. After conversing with us above an
hour, captain Flinders returned on board his own ship, promising
to come on board us again on the morrow, and bring us a
particular chart of the River Dalrymple, which had lately been
published in England.</p>
<p>On the 9th of April captain Flinders returned according to his
promise, and brought with him the chart, and soon after we
parted, to continue our geographic researches.</p>
<p>We now came to a part of Napoleon's Land, where the
constitution of the soil, hitherto so simple, was so complicated,
that it would be impossible for me to detail the particulars,
however interesting they may be; it is therefore by the more
prominent features that we must describe the new subjects which
will here be presented to our view. Beyond a bay of about ten
miles in width at the mouth, and which was called Bay Mollieu, we
first discovered the peninsula Fleurieu, which is 15 or 16
leagues in length, formed of very high lands and elevations of
mountains, which all proclaim that they are of a granitic
nature.</p>
<p>To the west of this peninsula appears a gulph, which goes
above 100 miles up into the interior of the lands, and which, in
honour of our august empress, we named Gulf Josephine; a-head of
this gulf, and almost across the mouth of it is the Isle
Decr&eacute;s, of 210 miles circumference, separated by the
strait of Colbert from the peninsula Fleurieu, on the east, and
by the strait of Lacepede on the west; from a second peninsula of
120 miles in length, which we named the peninsula Cambaceres: the
archipelago Vauban, composed of eight small islands, is situated
near the western point of this peninsula. Beyond Cape Berthier,
which terminates to the west the peninsula Cambaceres, New
Holland is intersected to form the Gulf Buonaparte, which runs
across this continent for a length of more than 200 miles, and
its shores spread over an extent of above 600 miles. This vast
gulf appears at the mouth like a large river, and insensibly
becomes narrower towards the end. On the western shore of this
gulf and near the entrance, is the port Champagny, one of the
finest and safest harbours of all New Holland: the bottom is in
every part good; the soundings even close in shore, are from ten
to twelve fathoms; and the extent of this port is so large, that
there is sufficient room for very numerous fleets. Off the mouth
of it is the Isle Lagrange, which is about four or five leagues
in circumference, and which, situated exactly opposite the middle
of the gulf, leaves on each side a passage of two or three miles
in width, in which it is both easy and safe to work to windward.
Finally, as if nature particularly favoured the port Champagny,
the general appearance of sterility is here no longer to be seen,
but the lands are high and clothed with thick forests. It is
nevertheless true, that we could not discover any fresh water,
but the strength and healthy appearance of the vegetation, and
the height of the lands, strongly indicates that there must be
some streams, or at least, some considerable springs. On this
most favoured part of Napoleon's Land, there doubtless exists
numerous tribes of inhabitants, for the whole coast appears as if
covered by the fires. So many superior advantages belonging
particularly to the port Champagny, insures it a very great
degree of importance, and we may without hesitation, assert, that
of all the points of this land, this is the most proper for the
establishment of a European colony.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic-12" id="pic-12"></a><img alt=""
src="1203691h-images/pic-12.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b><small>12. General Map of the Gulfs of Napoleon and Josephine,
S.A.</small></b></p>
<p>Off this port is situated the archipelago of Leoben,
consisting of eight small islands, of which, the largest is very
long and narrow. Another archipelago occupying the middle of the
mouth of the gulf, we named Berthier's Archipelago. The principal
isle of this last group, has the form of a large hook. Besides
all these islands, there are above twenty others, disseminated
about the environs of the western part of the gulf and at the
entrance; we gave to each of these one or other of the honourable
titles, which our country has been pleased to bestow as the
reward of merit.</p>
<p>Not far from the gulf Buonaparte, New Holland forms a large
cape, which we named Cape Brune, then goes back for a space of 60
miles, and again advances as far as Cape Correa. Near this point
is situated the group of the Jerome isles, which are nine in
number; the largest of them we called Isle Andreossy; it is not
less than twelve or thirteen miles in length. Farther on is the
Bay Lemonnier, protected by a chain of dangerous rocks. Then
passing the small Cuvier isles, we came off the Bay Louis, which
developes a coast of more than 50 miles: in this large space we
observed many of the fires of the natives.</p>
<p>At this last point of Napoleon's Land, the isles appear very
numerous, and first, the archipelago St. Francois presents its
thirteen or fourteen barren islands, which lay at the distance of
about 25 miles from the continent. A short distance N.E. of this
group, are the Isles St. Pierre, these are three in number, and
the soil and appearance very similar to the preceding. Still
farther, and very near the continent, are situated the Isles
Josephine, among numerous shoals and breakers. The Rambarde, a
frightful chain of reefs, occupies almost all the space which
separates these isles from those of the archipelago St. Pierre,
leaving however a good passage between them and the southern
extremity.</p>
<p>To the west of the group Josephine, are the Geography Isles,
forming a small group of four isles among several islots. Twenty
miles farther to the N.W., we discover the three small islands,
Jean-Bart: from this last point, to reach the Isles La
Bourdonnais, it is necessary to steer near 50 miles to the west;
and from thence, as far as the group of the Isles of Montenotte,
to bear away near 40 miles toward the S.S.W.</p>
<p>If we reckon with these last islands, all those which from
Wilson's promontory are spread abroad on Napoleon's Land, there
are more than 160: but all these isles are low, barren, and of a
sombre hue: most of them do not produce a tree or even a shrub;
the lichens alone, seem to creep over the surface of the ground.
On the largest, and also on that which has not quite so sterile
an appearance, the Isle Decr&eacute;s, for example, which is not
more than 70 leagues in circumference, and on which in the
interior, are such large forests, we could scarcely discover or
obtain, even by digging into the sandy earth, and collecting with
care all the watt which issued from the rocks, enough of this
precious element to fill a few casks; and all the other isles
appeared to be totally without any fresh water of any kind . . .
Can we therefore be surprised, that there did not appear to be
any inhabitants on these islands, or that we found no trace of
the human species on these numerous archipelagoes so near the
continent? But let us return to the continent itself, which we
have forsaken awhile, to take notice first of the adjacent
isles.</p>
<p>The reader will doubtless recollect, that one of the objects
more particularly recommended in our instructions, was, to
penetrate to the back of the Isles St. Pierre and St. Francois,
and to reconnoitre very particularly all that part of the
continent which was partly concealed behind this archipelago. On
this point was supposed to be a strait, which intersecting New
Holland into two large islands, would open into the end of the
Gulf of Carpentaria. On this point also, the best informed
naturalists, not supposing it at all probable that so large a
continent should be entirely without any rivers, have placed the
mouth of such as they thought must be somewhere in New Holland;
and this hypothesis is authorized, we must allow, by the immense
gulf which is situated on the S.W. coast of this vast continent.
Unfortunately this ingenious supposition has not been confirmed
by experience, for there are really, no rivers at the back of the
Isles St. Pierre or indeed St. Francois, or any other part of
Napoleon's Land.</p>
<p>In fact, beyond the Cape Lavoisier, which forms the N.W. point
of the great Bay Louis, which we have already mentioned the coast
behind these two archipelagos, is indented into a number of
inconsiderable bays, and then inclines towards the Isles
Josephine, forming with them a large bay, which we shall describe
more particularly hereafter, and which we named Bay Murat. From
thence as far as the Cape of Adieux, where we terminated our
survey of this coast, and which is situated in 32&deg; 19' south
latitude, and 128&deg; 42' longitude, the shore of the continent
again, displays a number of small and inconsiderable bays,
without any appearance of a strait, or even a river. All this
last part of New Holland, although of a somewhat more varied
aspect than the rest of Napoleon's Land, appears quite as
sterile, and whatever part of it we visited on shore, had but too
much conformity to this general appearance.</p>
<p class="poem"><small>Sterilis profundi squalet soli,<br>
Et f&oelig;da tellus torpet &aelig;terno situ.<br>
            Seneca, in Herc. fin.</small></p>
<p>I have thus given a hasty sketch of the general appearance of
Napoleon's Land. How many dangers and arduous labours did we
endure in the research of these particulars! At two different
seasons we visited these dangerous shores: hurricanes and storms,
shoals and breakers, threatened us perpetually with destruction,
and from which we several times very narrowly escaped. Twice with
the Geographer, we attempted to penetrate to the farther part of
the Gulf Buonaparte, and twice we there had nearly perished. The
Casuarina, however, reconnoitred the whole of this gulf, eight
months after this period.</p>
<p>The 13th of April was particularly marked by extreme danger:
attacked by dreadful squalls of wind, we were obliged, through
the whole of the night, to beat to windward in the east gulf,
having several times not more than a few feet water, and drawing
six or seven knots.</p>
<p>The night of the 19th of April was still more dreadful. At
that time we were in the Gulf Buonaparte: impetuous winds from
the W.S.W., blew with terrible violence; the sky was covered with
thick black clouds; torrents of cold rain, like melted snow,
fell, accompanied by flashes of terrific lightning; the ground
swells were so violent and so sudden, that we were obliged to
tack continually till day appeared. And happy were we, that we
had been able, by dint of incessant labour and exertion, to
escape the numerous perils of that dreadful night!</p>
<p>These dangers, however, were not to be compared with the
shocking ravages which the scurvy spread among our people.
Several of our men had already been committed to the deep:
already more than the half of our seamen were incapable of
service: only two of our helmsmen were able to get on deck. The
daily increase of this epidemic, was alarming to an extreme
degree. And in fact, how should it be otherwise? Three quarters
of a bottle of stinking water was our daily allowance: for more
than a year we had not tasted wine; we had not even a single drop
of brandy; for those liquors, so indispensable to European
seamen, and particularly in such voyages as ours, was substituted
three sixths of a bottle of a bad sort of rum, which is made in
the Isle of France, and which is there only used by the black
slaves. The biscuit served out to us was full of insects; all our
salt provisions were putrid and rotten; and both the smell and
taste were so offensive, that the almost famished seamen,
sometimes preferred suffering all the extremities of want itself,
to eating these unwholesome provisions, and even in the presence
of the commander, they often threw their allowance into the sea.
. . .Besides, there were no comforts of any kind for the sick;
none of the necessaries allowed by authority; none of those
consoling attentions from the superior, which are so grateful to
the feelings of all men, and which are certainly great
alleviations in times of such painful and afflicting privations,
these comforts were totally unknown. The officers and
naturalists, strictly reduced to the same allowance as the
seamen, suffered with them the same afflictions of body and
mind.</p>
<p>Such was the melancholy state of our ship, when in the morning
of the 30th of April, we came in sight of the Isles St. Pierre
and St. Francois; eager to get at the back of these islands, and
at length resolve the grand question, whether New Holland was
really an entire continent, or whether there was behind these
islands any river that intersected it? but our attempts for eight
days successively were in vain; the hurricanes, calms, and
currents, alternately drove us from these shores; and our crew
being in so exhausted a state, could only make ineffectual
attempts. We were therefore compelled to defer this important
discovery to a future time, and endeavour to make the nearest
place to refresh. In the following chapter, we shall see how
immediate the necessity was for this determination.</p>
<p>Thus terminated our first survey of Napoleon's Land. In the
course of 43 days, we had reconnoitred above a thousand leagues
of coast; including in this general calculation, all the isles
and the numerous bays which we successively had coasted, from
Wilson's promontory to the south, to Cape Adieux to the N.W. But,
several points of this immense space had certainly escaped us:
the geography of the Isles Decr&eacute;s was not completed: we
had not reached the ends of the two gulfs; the port Champagny had
not been explored, and the question of the entireness of the
continent, which was an essential object of our mission, was
still undecided. A second cruize to Napoleon's Land was therefore
indispensable, and this consideration ought to have made our
commander bend his course to the south, that we might winter in
Port Jackson.</p>

<br>
<p>THE winter had now set in in these southern latitudes; the
frequency of the storms and squalls of wind, the roughness of the
sea, had convinced us of this truth, during the latter, part of
our stay on Napoleon's Land: these imperious circumstances
concurred with the epidemic that reigned on board, to make the
want of rest the more urgent, it therefore appeared natural to
steer the nearest way for Port Jackson, and consequently to cross
the Strait of Bass, to get into the great Southern Ocean: our
commander, however, was of a different opinion, and without any
kind of apparent reason, gave orders to steer to the southern
extremity of Diemen's Land. So extraordinary a resolution, spread
a general consternation among us, and the melancholy
presentiments which it inspired, were soon justified by
successive misfortunes.</p>
<p>On the 9th of May, a brisk wind from the N.N.E., carried us a
good way to the south: during the whole of the night on the 9th,
the horizon appeared all on fire, the flashes of lightning
followed each other in such quick succession; and we had also
very heavy rain.</p>
<p>From the 10th to the 15th, the weather was dreadful; the sky,
always loaded with heavy clouds, incessantly poured down torrents
of cold rain; the winds blew in squalls, and with great violence:
a thick and penetrating fog darkened the atmosphere, and almost
choaked our men. Our unhappy scorbutic crew were covered with
ulcers and putrid sores; every day increased the number of the
sick, those appointed to attend them, were themselves affected by
the same cruel distemper, and our doctor himself, M. l'Haridon,
was ill.</p>
<p>We now saw a number of albatrosses, the perpetual inhabitants
of the South Seas, and the thermometer had already sunk to
8&deg;. This quick change of the atmosphere compelled us to take
to our winter clothing, and our sick companions painfully
experienced this alteration of the temperature of the air.</p>
<p>On the 19th, in the morning, we discovered Diemen's Land; at
noon we saw the Mewstone Rock; at four o'clock in the afternoon,
we were off the Isles of Swilly; and we hoped, before night, to
be in the channel Dentrecasteaux; but the winds deceived us: we
lay-to under the Isle Bruny.</p>
<p>On the 20th in the morning, we found ourselves very near the
land, but we could hardly distinguish it through the thick fog,
with which it was covered; at nine o'clock we discovered the
entrance of the Bay of Adventure, and the lofty reddish columns
of the Fluted Cape risen (if I may be allowed the expression),
from the depth of a stormy sea; these columns appear four or five
hundred feet above the surface of the water, like an enormous
causeway of basaltic prisms, against which, the tumultuous waves
driven hither, from the frozen ocean of the pole, by the south
wind, break with great noise and violence. This basaltic
constitution, which we have before had occasion to remark on the
Isle Tasman, and on some other points of Diemen's Land, or the
adjacent islands, is so much the more extraordinary, as there
does not appear to be any volcanic substances, even in those very
places where this constitution was observed.</p>
<p>A-head of the Fluted Cape, projects the Isle of the Penguins,
a barren rock, thus named by Furneaux, from a species of
<i>Aptenodytes minor</i>, which this navigator discovered here,
and which he mistook for a penguin. This mistake, though of but
little consequence in geographic nomenclature, is, nevertheless,
an error to be remarked, as it is connected with the knowledge of
natural history. It is, in fact certain, that all the species of
the penguin genus, are confined to the cold seas of the Northern
Hemisphere: while on the contrary, the Aptenodytes minor, are
found near the still colder waters of the Antarctic
Hemisphere.</p>
<p>After passing the Isle of Penguins, we came opposite to the
anchorage, in the Bay of Adventure. Here the appearance of the
lands changed all at once; the Isle Bruny is in this part formed
of lofty mountains, and the valleys extend to the sea shore;
numerous streams descend from the mountains, which are clothed
with thick forests to the very summits, while the coast is
adorned with beautiful trees and shrubs, that are evergreen. The
stillness of the waves at the farther end of the bay, the verdure
and coolness of the adjacent forests, formed a delightful
contrast with the barren aspect and sombre hue of the Fluted
Cape, and the noise of the waves, which were still to be heard in
the distance.</p>
<p>We had no sooner cast anchor, than several boats were sent for
wood and water, and to carry on shore those of our sick who could
bear the motion. I myself, went with my friend M. Bernier, and we
spent the day together, in exploring the farther end of the
bay.</p>
<p>On the 21st, at four o'clock in the morning, I again went in
search of subjects for my collection, and was well rewarded for
my labour. At length, in the morning of the 22d, our commander
gave orders to set sail: so exhausted was the state of our crew,
that we were above four hours in raising the anchor. As soon as
this labour was ended, we steered our course to the N.N.E.,
bearing away towards the Isle Maria, which we gained in the
course of the evening. But before we return to the account of our
voyage, I shall give a few particulars on the subject of the Bay
of Adventure.</p>
<p>The Bay of Adventure was discovered in the year 1770, by
captain Furneaux, who named it after the ship which he commanded.
This bay is connected with the eastern coast of the Isle Bruny,
which forms, with Diemen's Land, the grand channel
Dentrecasteaux; the isthmus St. Aignant, which is situated N.N.E.
of the Fluted Cape, separates it from the channel. The lands of
the isthmus being very low, and the breadth being not more than a
few hundred paces, it seems astonishing that the discovery of
this channel, successively escaped both Furneaux and captain
Cook, who, a long time before admiral Dentrecasteaux, had made
some stay in the Bay Adventure: the latitude is 40&deg; 20' S.,
and the longitude 145&deg; 12' E. of the meridian of Paris. The
topographic plan of this bay, drawn by the ingenious French
artist, M. Beautemps-Beaupr&eacute;, is particularly to be
valued, for its peculiar correctness in every particular.</p>
<p>Of all the particular parts of Diemen's Land, and the adjacent
isles, that which we are now describing is doubtless the best
watered, and for that reason, is the most interesting to
navigators: it is probably the only part, where one or more
vessels could be supplied with fresh water. This advantage
appeared to me, to depend less on the height of the mountains,
and the thickness of the forests, than on the nature of the soil,
which is entirely composed of granitic rock, of a very fine
grain, and a bed of clayey earth, which itself, laying under the
vegetative land, spreads over the whole of that part of the isle
where we then were. From this disposition, it consequently
results, that the rain-water and the dews, and the still more
abundant water of the mists and the clouds, condensed by the
mountains, not being able to sink deep into the soil, are thus
forced to run on the surface, where they form the numerous
streams I before mentioned, besides several ponds and marshes,
large enough to support several sorts of fresh water fish, which
are found in great plenty.</p>
<p>From the few meteorological experiments that I was able to
make in Adventure Bay, I found that Reaumur's thermometer, ashore
in the day-time, varied from six to ten degrees: that the mean
height of the barometer, was 28<sup><small>i</small></sup>
1<sup><small>l</small></sup> 4: while the hygrometer fluctuated
from 92 to 97; and the temperature of the sea at its surface, was
very little different from that of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>After what I have said of our acquaintance with the
inhabitants of Diemen's Land, it will be perceived that those of
Isle Bruny belong to the same race; and they occasionally pass
from one isle to the other. It is probable, that at the time of
our anchoring in Adventure Bay, they were all on the main land;
for we could not discover any traces of them ashore. The reason
why they seldom frequent Isle Bruny, I attribute to the scarcity
of the large oysters, turbots, and other fish, that form their
principal food.</p>
<p>On doubling Isle Maria to the south, we passed in the morning
of the 24th Geography Strait, Capes Degerando, Tourville, &amp;c.
and arrived off Cape Lodi; where we were visited by tremendous
weather. Every day produced hurricanes and tempests; and so thick
a fog surrounded us, that we could scarcely distinguish the
highest mountains of Diemen's Land. It likewise often thundered,
and in the morning of the 3d of June we had a storm of very large
hail; a circumstance the more singular, as neither the season nor
the state of the atmosphere indicated the approach of such
phenomena.</p>
<p>The number of our sick increased every hour; and every day we
had to commit some of our unfortunate companions to the deep;
while from the diminution of our numbers, all hands were required
above deck to manage the ship; and the fatigues they underwent,
exhausted the few who were in health. At length, there were only
six who were able to keep the deck; the sick below made the
vessel re-echo with their painful cries, and a general
consternation prevailed. We could now no longer direct the ship:
all the tackle gave way, and we had not hands enough to repair or
to shift the sails. There was not a moment to lose, and we saw
that our commander had too long delayed coming to anchor. In
short, it was necessary to quit these stormy seas at the
extremity of the globe, and hasten towards Port Jackson. "Then,"
said the commander in his journal, and the fact was too fatally
evident; "we had but four of the crew capable of doing duty on
deck, including a midshipman." It may be guessed from this slight
remark, what ravages had been made amongst us by the scurvy!
indeed, not one of us was free from it; and it even extended to
the domestic animals, particularly two rabbits and a monkey,
which died of this disease. Amidst all these disasters, our
second physician, M. Taillefer, paid the kindest attention to all
who were in want of his assistance.</p>
<p>Till the 5th of June, the storm had not entirely ceased; but
as we made much way to the northward, its violence gave us less
trouble. During the night, we passed the southern point of New
Holland, which is called by Cook the Ram Head. On the 7th died
our purser, Racine, who was one of the most respectable of our
company.</p>
<p>From the 7th to the 15th of June, the stormy weather was
incessant. On the night of the 14th we had much thunder and hail,
and the lightning was so vivid and constant, that we were almost
blinded with its refulgence. At length, on the 17th, the man at
the mast-head sung out, that a ship was in sight and preparing to
board us, and shortly the vessel was alongside; when the captain
informed us, that he had only been two days from Port Jackson on
his way to New Zealand to catch whales; that captain Flinders had
been some time in that harbour; that the Naturalist had been at
anchor there several days, but had gone out in search of us; that
the long-boat which we had been obliged to abandon on the eastern
shore of Diemen's Land, had been fallen in with by an English
ship from Port Jackson, and that its whole crew were safe on
board the Naturalist: he concluded with saying, that we were
expected with the utmost anxiety in the colony, where the orders
of the English government had been received, commanding the
governor to shew us every kind of attention, and adding, that we
should be sure of meeting with every possible accommodation. He
also apprised us that, only a few days before he sailed, an
official account had been received of the conclusion of peace
between England and France.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this pleasing intelligence, we were obliged to
tack for many days off Port Jackson, without being able to enter
it, on account of the debility of the crew, who were unable to
perform the necessary man&oelig;uvres. Our joy, however, became
incomprehensible, when, on the 20th we perceived a large English
sloop coming towards us. We soon learned from the commanding
officer, that for three days we had been perceived by the signal
posts on the coast, and that the governor supposing from our
man&oelig;uvres, that we were in great distress, had sent off the
sloop, with a pilot and the necessary number of hands to conduct
us into the harbour. Full of gratitude for this assistance, we
very shortly came to anchor.</p>
<p>Thus terminated this long navigation, one of the most fatal
with which naval histories can furnish; one which had deprived us
of nearly the whole of our crew. At this critical period, nearly
all our scorbutic patients were so ill, that it would have
required several days to convey half of them on shore: two of
them died the day after we anchored; but all the rest recovered
to rapidly, as to strike us with astonishment; not one of those
who had been landed died, and in a few days, those who were
actually on the brink of the grave, recovered their health. We
were, in short, lost in wonder at the magical effect of the
country and the vegetables upon a disorder, to counteract which,
all the medicines on board ship, all the most active operations,
and energetic attentions, had proved fruitless.</p>
<p>Happily the means of preventing these disastrous epidemics are
now better known; for natural philosophy and chemistry have
afforded great aid to the system of nautical medicine. The
diseases, however, which afflicted us, must afford a dreadful
lesson to future navigators; in fact, they arose from no Other
cause, than the contempt of our commander for all the precautions
that were indispensable to preserve the health of the crew. He
despised the liberal orders of government in this respect; he
disdained all the instructions that had been given to him in
Europe; and oppressed his whole company with the most horrible
privations. May his conduct be a warning to his successors, and
save them from regret and remorse.</p>

<br>
<small>[<i>From the</i> 8<i>th to the</i> 19<i>th of March,</i>

<br>
<p>THE reader will doubtlessly recollect the separation of the
Naturalist and the Geographer, on the eastern coast of Diemen's
Land. Before we give the details of our residence at Port
Jackson, where the Naturalist came to anchor a few days before
our arrival, it appears necessary, that the order of occurrences
may not be interrupted, to expose first the result of the labours
of the philosophers, during this last part of their navigation.
Messrs. Boulanger, Freycinet, and Bailly, shall be the principal
narrators of the events that happened.</p>
<p>"Notwithstanding our eagerness to follow the route of the
Geographer, we could not, says. M. Freycinet, keep her in sight.
The superior sailing of that vessel, and the multiplicity of
tacks she made, without making any of the usual signals, together
with the bad weather that prevailed, sufficiently account for our
separation.</p>
<p>"On the 8th of March we made towards land, in the hope of
discovering the Geographer. At four in the afternoon a sail was
perceived in the E.S.E., which we immediately took for our
consort, but on coming up, we discovered her to be an English
brig. The captain informed us, that she was called the Endeavour,
and that she had been a fortnight out from Port Jackson to Isle
Maria, to catch Phoc&aelig;. This brig had been built in the port
just mentioned; her hull was made of the wood of the Casuarina,
and her masts of the Eucalyptus. We gave this vessel some account
of the roads to which she was proceeding, and pointed out the
parts where the sea-cows most abounded.</p>
<p>"On the 10th, early in the morning, we observed another sail,
which we discovered to be making towards us, and that she was an
English brig. What was our surprise on recognizing the long-boat
of the Geographer, with Messrs. Boulanger, Maurouard, and the
eight sailors who had followed them. We were astonished at the
danger they had escaped, as we had no doubt that they rejoined
their ship on the 6th of March. We learned that M. Boulanger,
having in vain on the evening of the 6th endeavoured to rejoin
the Geographer, M. Maurouard and he had resolved to keep close to
the shore; that the 7th had been occupied by them in coasting
along it, and continuing their geographical observations, but
being forced to pass another night in the open air, they had
suffered much from the cold and rain, with a violent breeze from
the S.W. The honor of our situation at this period, said M.
Boulanger, may be conceived: the small portion of provisions and
water which we had received as our day's allowance on leaving the
ship, was exhausted, and we were sinking under fatigue, from
being incapable of sleeping, and soaked with sea water. On the
8th however, we caught a number of cormorants, and had the
happiness to discover the Isle Maurouard, where we found fresh
water, and passed the night. On the 9th, continued M. Boulanger,
we proceeded along the shore, till we came in sight of the
Furneaux Isles, when we fell in with an English brig, the
Harrington, commanded by captain Campbell. This generous
Englishman received us in the kindest manner, and gave us every
assistance: he supplied us with abundance of provisions,
particularly salt beef and potatoes of Port Jackson, and the
biscuit made there; his brig had been built in the colony, and
had come to Banks's Strait, to load with seals and sea-cow skins,
collected there from various parts, by men who reside for this
purpose on King's and Furneaux Isles. Nevertheless, captain
Campbell obligingly offered to take us to Port Jackson, if during
the few days he should be visiting the River Dalrymple and Port
Western, we should not discover our ships. If this should not
happen, he proposed to land us on the Furneaux Isles, and take us
up on his return. We, however, declined giving up the search for
our ships, on which this generous captain offered to furnish us
with tables of the setting of the sun, to direct us in our route,
as well as a supply of powder and ball, for shooting fowl.</p>

<b><small>13. Sea-elephants or "Phoc&aelig;" at King Island,
Tas.</small></b></p>
<p>"On the 10th of March we prepared to leave captain Campbell,
to cruise before Banks's Strait, when from the mast-head we
perceived a large ship, which we soon discovered to be the
Naturalist; therefore taking leave of our host, we got into the
boat and made for the French ship, on board which we soon
arrived; happy at having thus escaped all the calamities which
generally happen on such a separation."</p>
<p>The account of M. Boulanger leaving no doubt that the
Geographer was still to the southward, captain Hamelin resolved
to wait for her in Banks's Strait; in, consequence of this
decision, he came to anchor on the 10th, off Swan Island, and on
the 11th, Messrs. Boulanger, Freycinet, and St. Cricq, were
dispatched to Cape Portland, to determine its position, while the
other gentlemen were sent to Kent Bay for similar purposes.</p>
<p>Preservation Isle was one point to which Messrs. Faure and
Bailly were sent. This isle, says the last-mentioned gentleman,
from its situation at the end of Kent Bay, which it protects from
the westerly winds, is surrounded by a great number of rocks and
islots, which form the retreat of an abundance of Phoc&aelig;.
The island itself, is nothing but a large granitic plain, about
100 feet above the level of the sea: its shores are every where
intersected by sandy creeks, at the months of which are rocky
breakers, against which the sea dashes with great fury, and which
seem to have been placed there by nature, expressly to prevent
the entrance of the waves. Most of these rocks form breakers only
a few feet under water, while others rise a little above the
surface.</p>
<p>The granitic rock, which forms the whole substance of
Preservation Isle, is covered with a thin stratum of vegetable
mould, merely sufficient to produce a few slight shrubs and thin
grass, beneath which is found a prodigious number of the white
and blue <i>Aptenodytes minor</i>; these birds have their nests
in pairs, and build them in burrows formed by the roots of shrubs
and a kind of thick grass. In those parts where the grass does
not grow, they form their nests in the soil. It is difficult and
fatiguing to walk on the ground where these nests are made,
because it is so hollow, that the feet of the passenger sink at
almost every step, even knee deep; during the day these birds
remain squat, and as it were, benumbed in their nests: but as
soon as night arrives, they rush in crowds towards the shore to
search for fish and other animals, on which they feed; and from
these excursions they do not return till break of day; to keep
their nests from cold, they cover them with dry leaves and
feathers; in these nests they rear their young, till they are
strong enough to walk to the shore and feed themselves.</p>
<p>These birds are not very bold, and only defend themselves by
making a few blows with their beaks, at those who attempt to take
them; they appear to be very fond of heat, for, during the night,
they came in great numbers towards our fires, till many of them
were burned. One of our sailors who had wrapt himself in a
blanket, was so assailed by them, that he could not close his
eyes, as they attempted with the utmost obstinacy to get under
his covering; and though in a rage he wrung the necks of several,
yet the rest returned incessantly to the charge. These birds have
a very shrill cry, similar to that of wild ducks; as we were not
here in their time of laying, we could not procure any of their
eggs, but almost all their nests contained in each two young
ones, tolerably fledged; this circumstance seemed to indicate,
that every covey of this kind of bird is not more numerous. Their
flesh has a very disagreeable taste, and their fat is a kind of
oil, which liquefies on applying the slightest heat, but which,
penetrating the whole substance of the animal, communicates to it
an oily taste and a nauseous smell. Roasted, or rather broiled on
live coals, these birds have a taste similar to red herrings, and
this was the only way of dressing them, which rendered them
eatable.</p>
<p>The north eastern coast of Preservation Isle, is at once the
most healthy and the best sheltered. The southern coast, on the
contrary, is covered with breakers and shoals, which render it
inaccessible. A vast quantity of the wrecks of ships of different
sizes, which cover the surface of the isle, prove the frequency
of storms, and their deplorable effects. The shipwreck of the
Sydney, a vessel belonging to the colony of Port Jackson, is
remarkable from the following circumstances. Of the whole crew,
only seventeen men were saved. After remaining some time on
Preservation Isle, they resolved to get to the continent of New
Holland, and return by land to Port Jackson; they succeeded in
reaching Wilson's Promontory, whence they went on foot to the
English establishment, a distance of six hundred miles. On their
way, they experienced all the horrors of hunger and thirst, and
were much annoyed by the hordes of savages who inhabit those
inhospitable shores, with whom they were obliged to have many
battles. From these terrible obstacles, only three of the
unfortunate mariners reached the end of their journey, the other
fourteen having perished by the fatigues they underwent, or been
killed by the savages.</p>
<p>We soon left Isle Preservation for Clark's Island, and shortly
found ourselves at the mouth of Kent Bay. This bay does not
afford the advantages which might be expected from its position
and size; in fact, a sand bank, which does not contain water
enough to float a canoe, obstructs the whole of the eastern
parts, and occupies nearly one half of the total extent of the
bay; while on the western side are rocks, which render the
navigation dangerous, and the anchorage difficult. This is not
the case with a small harbour which lies between Clark's and
Preservation Isles: it is safe and convenient, being about three
miles long, by a mile and a half wide, and having from six to
fifteen fathom of water, with a sandy bottom.</p>
<p>On the 17th of March, in the morning, we proceeded to join the
Naturalist, at the anchorage where we had left her; but this ship
not being there, and the thick fog not allowing us to remain long
in the offing, we disembarked on Swan Island, and after a few
hours rest, we sailed to Waterhouse, the place of our rendezvous
with the Naturalist. This part of Diemen's Land is inhabited by
great numbers of small animals, similar to kangaroo rats; we
caught one which unfortunately we could not keep: we also saw a
species of small animal, which our crew did not fail to call
rats, though it was evident that they belonged to a genus, or
order quite different. They had long and silky hair, their colour
was a yellowish grey, and they were so little timid, that they
came amongst us to pick up the remains of our meals: one of the
sailors even caught one in his hand without affrighting it.
Waterhouse Isle is frequented by a great number of Phoc&aelig;,
some of which are of an enormous size: there are also great
numbers of dead whales, which are cast ashore by the waves.</p>
<p>The next day we made every effort to discover the Naturalist,
but without avail: our uneasiness therefore became general; and
we formed the most melancholy conjectures of its fate and our
own, when we suddenly discovered that ship tacking off
Waterhouse. We immediately made sail, and in a short time joined
our companions; happy in having escaped the dangers of every
kind, which for five days had surrounded us.</p>

<br>
<p>AS the Geographer was not visible in Bass's Straits, and as
every thing still seemed to prove that she must be to the
southward, captain Hamelin resolved to go in search of her. He
therefore sailed on the 21st of March, and for six days tacked
along the eastern coast, without discovering the least trace of
the commander: but all attempts at a junction were impossible,
for the Geographer had begun her survey of Napoleon's Land.</p>
<p>Disappointed in his researches, but retained by the precise
orders of his chief, captain Hamelin, on the 1st of April, again
appeared off Waterhouse; and that he might not make a useless
stay in Bass's Strait, he sent Messrs. Faure and Freycinet to the
River Dalrymple, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness
of the English chart. These gentlemen were engaged in their
investigation till the 7th; M. Freycinet reported, that very
strong currents set in at the mouth of that river, and that its
navigation was rendered very difficult by banks of rock and sand.
He found the chart of captain Flinders to be, on the whole, very
correct; and he corrected such slight errors as he had time to
discover. The soil on its banks is rich, and the vegetation
vigorous; much timber is produced there, but it does not appear
fit for naval purposes. So high as they went, they found the
water of the river to be too brackish for the relief of
navigators.</p>
<p>Captain Hamelin next proceeded to cruise off Waterhouse Isle;
and M. Boulanger was sent to reconnoitre Wilson's Promontory,
while M. Faure proceeded to Western Port, to revise the English
chart. These occupations took up eight days, and the result was,
that they discovered the English charts to be very incorrect in
every respect: that a sort of peninsula, as it is laid down in
Flinders's chart, is a real island; that Western Port has two
entrances, one to the eastward, which cannot be entered by large
ships, and the other to the west, having two distinct mouths;
that the harbour has a good anchorage, and sufficient space to
contain a great number of vessels: there are also several
currents of fresh water, which would afford abundant supplies to
navigators. In short, Western Port is one of the finest that can
be met with; and combines all the advantages that would be
necessary for forming a valuable establishment.</p>
<p>During our stay at Western Port, our companions had an
interview with the savages of this part of New Holland. The human
race appears very scanty in this quarter. Such of the natives as
they saw, appeared suspicious, diffident, and treacherous; and
their language seemed to bear no other resemblance to that of the
people of Diemen's Land, than the excessive rapidity of its
pronunciation. In other respects, such as by their whole shape,
the conformation of their heads, and their long and thin hair,
the inhabitants of the promontory, are eminently distinguishable
from those of the canal of Dentrecasteaux. Their teeth are
handsome and well placed, and they have not the custom of pulling
out one from the front. Their food is almost entirely shell fish,
and they paint their bodies and faces in white and red stripes,
circles, crosses, &amp;c. they also perforate the cartilage of
the nose, through which they pass a skewer six or seven inches
long, like the inhabitants of Port Jackson, and they wear a sort
of collar, made from a number of tubes of very thick straw; and
also, like the people of Diemen's Land, they bedaub their bodies
and faces with charcoal. Of thirteen savages, whom our company
saw, only one was covered with a black skin: the rest were
entirely naked. When they want to warm themselves, or probably
from mere amusement or indifference, they set fire to a wood,
which produces the most disastrous conflagration. These are all
the observations which our people could make concerning the
savages of the southern point of New Holland: however imperfect
they may be, they apply so exactly to the different nations,
whose curious history we shall hereafter have to describes that
no doubt can remain, as to the whole of the hordes having
descended from the same race.</p>
<p>At this period captain Hamelin found himself in a very awkward
situation: he had just finished his survey of every part of
Bass's Straits, without having discovered any trace of the
Geographer; his provisions were exhausted, or rather, he had not
at the utmost, more than would last him till he could put into
some port in the Indian ocean, and before he could get to which,
he was ordered to make a survey of the whole south western coast
of New Holland. In this exigency, he could not do otherwise than
make for Port Jackson; he therefore crossed the strait, doubled
Cape Stower on the 20th of April, and on the next day, was is the
latitude of Mount Dromedary, precisely on the same day, and at
the same hour, that it was discovered thirty years before, by the
immortal Cook. At length, on the 24th of April, he came in sight
of Port Jackson, and on the following day he anchored in that
beautiful harbour.</p>
<p>This being a period when war raged in all its fury between
Great Britain and France, captain Hamelin conceived that he
should not be allowed to put into the port, or that at any rate,
the assistance of which he was so much in need, would be refused
him. But his alarm was soon dispelled; for the English received
him instantly, with that charming generosity which the height of
European civilization can alone explain, and is alone capable of
producing. The most distinguished houses in the colony were
thrown open for our crew, and during the whole time we remained
here, we experienced that delicate and affectionate hospitality,
which is equally honourable to those who confer it, and those who
are its objects. All the resources of the country were at the
command of the French captain, and M. Hamelin had already begun
to lay in a complete stock of provisions, previous to sailing to
survey the south western coast, when the arrival of captain
Flinders at Port Jackson gave a new turn to his ideas. He then
learned, that the Geographer had been for several months on that
very coast, and as the commandant had several times asserted that
his intention was to proceed, after that campaign, to the Isle of
France, he himself resolved to go thither in quest of him.
Accordingly he redoubled his activity, and on the 18th of May he
set sail, leaving ashore his first lieutenant, M. Milius, who was
sick.</p>
<p>A few days before the departure of the Naturalist, official
intelligence had been received, of the conclusion of peace
between England and France: this event, however, could not
increase the kindness which the English displayed towards us, but
it was for them a subject of exultation; we should have been
equally delighted, if we had not had reason to reflect on the
futility of human hope: the demon of war had not yet assuaged his
passion, and it was a mere chance, as will be afterwards seen,
that our consort did not become his victim. Captain Hamelin, in
short, set sail, and doubled the southern point of Diemen's Land;
but from the 5th to the 20th of June, the weather was so
tempestuous, that after getting to 47 degrees south, he found
that his survey would occupy twice the time on which he had
calculated when taking in his provisions; besides this, as the
scurvy had begun to appear amongst his crew, he resolved to put
back. In short, on the 27th of June, in the evening, he again
came in sight of Port Jackson, into which he entered on the
following day; but, owing to contrary winds, he could not come to
anchor till the 3d. of July; when he found that we had got there
a few days before.</p>
<p>Thus, for the second time, and after inconceivable dangers,
two ships came together, whose difficulties had arisen entirely
from the obstinacy of the commander, who had forced them at two
periods to separate, when it would have been most advantageous
for them to act in concert.</p>
<p>Our arrival at Port Jackson did not excite so much surprise
amongst the colonists as might have been expected; but for
ourselves, we were completely astonished at the flourishing state
in which we found this singular, and distant establishment; the
beauty of the port at first attracted our whole attention. From
an entrance, says commodore Phillip (whose description is not in
the least exaggerated), of not more than two miles across, Port
Jackson gradually opens, till it forms a spacious harbour, with
sufficient depth of water for the largest ships, and room enough
to contain, in perfect safety, all that could on any occasion be
collected. Even a thousand ships of the line might man&oelig;uvre
here with ease. The bay takes a western direction, extends to the
distance of thirteen miles inland, and has at least a hundred
little creeks, formed by very narrow tongues of land, which
afford excellent shelter against winds, from any point of the
compass.</p>
<p>Towards the middle of this magnificent port, and on its
southern bank, in one of the principal creeks, rises Sydney Town,
the capital of the county of Cumberland, and of all the English
colonies in this part of the world: seated at the base of two
hills, they are contiguous to each other; and having the
advantage of a rivulet, which runs completely through it, this
infant town affords a view, at once agreeable and picturesque. To
the right, and at the north point of Sydney Cove, you perceive
the signal battery, which is built upon a rock, difficult of
access: six pieces of cannon, protected by a turf entrenchment,
cross their fire with that of another battery, which I shall
presently mention; and thus defend, in the most effectual manner,
the approach to the harbour and the town. Farther on, appear the
large buildings that form the hospital, and which are capable of
containing two or three hundred sick. Amongst these buildings,
there is one particularly worthy of notice, as all the parts of
it were prepared in Europe, and brought out in commodore
Phillip's squadron; so that in a few days after its arrival,
there was an hospital ready to receive such of the crews as were
sick. On the same side of the town, at the sea shore, you observe
a very fine magazine, to which the largest ships can come up, and
discharge their cargoes. In the same direction are several
private docks, in which are built brigs and cutters, of different
sizes, for the purpose of trading, either inland, or beyond the
colony. These vessels, which are from fifty to three hundred tons
burthen, are built entirely with the native wood; even their
masts are obtained from the forests of the colony.</p>

<b><small>14. Wide View of the Southern Part of
Sydney-Town</small></b></p>
<p>The discovery of the strait which separates New Holland from
Van Diemen's Land, was made in a simple whale sloop, commanded by
Mr. Bass, the surgeon of the Reliance. This vessel may be said to
have been consecrated to that great discovery, and hazardous
navigation; for it is preserved in the harbour, with a sort of
religious veneration: some snuff-boxes have been made out of its
keel, of which the possessors are both proud and jealous; and the
governor himself thought he could not make a more acceptable
present to our chief, than a piece of the wood of this sloop,
enchased in a large silver tooth-pick box; round which were
engraved the principal particulars of the discovery of Bass's
Straits.</p>
<p>It is at the spot called Hospital Creek, that the ships of
individuals unload their cargoes. Beyond the hospital, in the
same line, is the prison, which has several dungeons, capable of
holding from an hundred and fifty, to two hundred prisoners; it
is surrounded by a high and strong wall, and has a numerous guard
on duty, both by day and night, A short distance from the prison
is the store-house, for the reception of wines, spirituous
liquors, salt provisions, &amp;c. In the front of it is the
armoury, where the garrison is drawn up every morning,
accompanied by a numerous and well-composed band, belonging to
the New South Wales regiment. The whole western part of this
spot, is occupied by the house of the
lieutenant-governor-general: behind which is a vast garden, which
is worth the attention both of the philosopher and the
naturalist, on account of the great number of useful vegetables
which are cultivated in it, and which have been procured from
every part of the world, by its present respectable possessor,
Mr. Paterson, a distinguished traveller, and member of the Royal
Society of London. Between the house and the magazine, just
mentioned, is the public school: here are educated in the
principles of religion, morality, and virtue, those young
females, who are the hope of the rising colony; but whose parents
are either too degenerate, or too poor, to give them proper
instruction. In the public school, however, under respectable
matrons, they are taught, from their earliest years, all the
duties of a good mother of a family. Such is one great advantage
of the excellent colonial system established in these distant
regions.</p>
<p>Behind the house of the lieutenant-governor-general, in a
large magazine, are deposited all the dried pulse and corn,
belonging to the state. It is a sort of public granary, intended
for the support of the troops, and the people, who receive their
subsistence from the government. The barrack occupy a
considerable square, and have in front several field-pieces; the
edifices, for the accommodation of the officers, form the lateral
parts, or ends of the building; and the powder magazine is in the
middle. Near this, in a small private house, the principal civil
and military officers assemble. It is a sort of coffee-house,
maintained by subscription, in which there are several
amusements, but particularly billiards; which any person may
play, free of expence. Behind the armoury, is a large square
tower, which serves for an observatory to those English officers
who study astronomy: at the base of this tower, the foundation of
a church has been laid, of which the building, just mentioned, is
intended to form the steeple; but a structure of this kind,
requiring considerable time, labour, and expence, the governors
have hitherto neglected to carry it into execution; preferring
the formation of such establishments as are more immediately
necessary for the preservation of the colony. While waiting,
however, for the erection of a church, divine service is
performed in one of the apartments of the great corn magazine.
Two fine windmills terminate on this side the series of the
principal public edifices. Over the rivulet that intersects the
town, there was a wooden bridge, which, together with a strong
causeway, may be said to occupy all the bottom of the valley. We
passed over this bridge, in order to take a rapid view of the
eastern part of Sydney Town. Before our departure, the wooden
bridge was destroyed, to make way for one which they were about
to build of stone; at the same time, a water-mill was built here
by the government, and strong locks had been formed, either to
keep in the water of the rivulet, or to stop that of the marshes,
which runs to a considerable distance into the valley, and might
be advantageously employed in turning the mill.</p>
<p>At the east point of the creek is a second battery, the fire
of which crosses that of the signal station. The one of which I
am now speaking, was dismantled at the time of our arrival at
Port Jackson; but it has been put in order since our departure.
On the shore, as you approach the town, is a small salt-pit,
where the Americans, who were allowed to settle for the purpose
at Port Jackson, in 1795, prepared most of the salt used in the
colony. Farther on, and towards the bottom of the harbour, is the
part called Government Creek, because it is reserved for the
agents, and vessels of the state. Between this creek and the
salt-pit, is the place for docking and careening the ships. The
natural quays are so perpendicular, and well formed, that without
any kind of labour or expence on the part of the English, the
largest ships might be laid along them in perfect security. Near
the Government Creek, are three public magazines, one of them
contains all the articles necessary for the various purposes of
domestic life, such as earthenware, household furniture, culinary
utensils, instruments of agriculture, &amp;c. The number of these
articles that is here amassed, is truly astonishing, and the mode
in which they are delivered out, is wise and salutary. In this
distant country, the merchandizes of Europe bear so high a price,
that it would have been next to impossible for the population to
procure such as are indispensable to the common wants of life;
the English government has therefore anticipated these wants, by
filling large store-houses with every article that can be
required, all of which are delivered to the colonists at fixed
prices, that are extremely moderate; sometimes even below what
they cost in Europe. But in order to prevent avaricious
speculations, or waste, no one is admitted into these
dep&ocirc;ts without a written order from the governor; in which
are specified the articles that the bearer is in need of. In
another house are preserved the different uniforms and clothing
for the troops and convicts, as well as vast quantities of
sail-cloth and cordage, for the government-ships. The last of the
three buildings just mentioned, is a kind of public manufactory:
in which are employed female convicts. Behind these magazines is
the governor's house, which is built in the Italian style,
surrounded by a colonnade, as simple as it is elegant, and in
front of which is a fine garden, that descends to the sea-shore:
already in this garden may be seen, the Norfolk Island pine, the
superb Columbia, growing by the side of the bamboo of Asia:
farther on is the Portugal orange, and Canary fig, ripening
beneath the shade of the French apple-tree: the cherry, peach,
pear, and apricot, are interspersed amongst the Banksia,
Metrosideros, Correa, Melaleuca, Casuarina, Eucalyptus, and a
great number of other indigenous trees: beyond the government
garden, on the other side of a neighbouring hill, is the
windmill, the bake-house, and the state ovens, that are used for
making ship biscuit these are capable of furnishing from fifteen,
to eighteen hundred pounds per day. Not far from a contiguous
creek, at a spot which the natives call Wallamoula is the
charming habitation of Mr. Palmer, the commissary general; a
rivulet of fresh water runs before it, and empties itself into
the creek, which here forms a safe and convenient basin. Here,
Mr. Palmer has built several small vessels, which he employs in
whale fishing, and catching Phoc&aelig;, or sea Elephants, either
at New Zealand, or in Bass's Straits. The neighbouring
brick-fields furnish a considerable quantity of bricks and tiles,
for the public and private buildings of the colony.</p>

<br>
<b><small>15. Plan of Sydney-Town</small></b></p>
<p>A short distance to the southward of Sydney Town, to the left
of the great road that leads to Parramatta, you observe the
remains of the first gibbet that was erected on the continent of
New Holland. The increase of habitations having caused it to be,
as it were, surrounded, it has been succeeded by another, that
has been erected farther off, in the same direction, and near the
village of Brick-field. This village, which consists of about two
score of houses, contains several manufactories of tiles,
earthen-ware, crockery, &amp;c. its site is agreeable, and the
soil, less sterile than that of Sydney, is better adapted to the
different kinds of cultivation that have been introduced into
these distant regions.</p>
<p>The great road just mentioned, passes through the middle of
Brick-field; while a small rivulet intersects it, in an opposite
direction. Between this village and Sydney Town, is the public
burying-ground, which is already rendered an object of interest
and curiosity, by several striking monuments that have been
erected in it; and the execution of which, is much better than
could reasonably have been expected from the state of the arts,
in so young a colony.</p>
<p>A croud of objects, equally interesting, demanded our notice
in every direction. In the port we saw, drawn up together, a
number of Vessels that had arrived from different parts of the
world, and most of which were destined to perform new and
difficult voyages. Some of them had come from the banks of the
Thames, or the Shannon, to pursue whale-fishing on the frigid
shores of New Zealand: others, bound to China, after depositing
the freight which they had received from the English government,
for this colony, were preparing to sail for the mouth of the
Yellow-river; while some, laden with pit-coal, were about to
convey that precious combustible to India, and the Cape of Good
Hope. Several smaller vessels were on their way to Bass's
Straits, to receive skins, collected by a few individuals, who
had established themselves on the isles of those straits, to
catch the marine animals that resort to them. Other ships,
stronger built than those just alluded to, and manned by more
numerous and daring crews, who were provided with all kinds of
arms, were on the point of sailing for the western coast of
America. Laden with various sorts of merchandize, these vessels
were intended to carry on, by force of arms, a contraband trade
on the Peruvian shores, which could not fail to prove extremely
advantageous to the adventurers. Here they were preparing an
expedition, to carry on a skin trade, with the people of the
north-west shores of America: there all hands were engaged in
sending off a fleet of provision ships to the Navigators, the
Friendly, and the Society Islands, to procure for the colony a
stock of salt provisions. At the same time the intrepid captain
Flinders, after effecting a junction with his companion-ship, the
Lady Nelson, was getting ready to continue his grand voyage round
New Holland; a voyage, which was soon afterwards terminated by
the greatest misfortunes. In short, at this period, the harbour
of Port Jackson had become familiar to the American navigators,
and their flag was continually flying in it, during our
residence.</p>
<p>All these great maritime operations gave to the place a
character of importance and activity, far beyond what we expected
to meet with on shores, scarcely known to Europeans, even by
name, and the interest we took in the scene, was only equalled by
our admiration.</p>
<p>The population of the colony, was to us a new subject of
astonishment and contemplation. Perhaps there never was a more
worthy object of study presented to the philosopher;&mdash;never
was the influence of social institutions proved in a manner more
striking and honourable to the distant country in question. Here
we found united, like one family, those banditti, who had so long
been the terror of their mother country: repelled from European
society, and sent off to the extremity of the globe; placed from
the very hour of their exile, in a state between the certainty of
chastisement, and the hope of a better fate; incessantly
subjected to as inspection, as inflexible as it is active, they
have been compelled to abandon their anti-social manners; and the
majority of them, having expiated their crimes, by a hard period
of slavery, have been restored to the rank which they held
amongst their fellow-men. Obliged to interest themselves is the
maintenance of order and justice, for the purpose of preserving
the property which they have acquired; while they behold
themselves in the situation of husbands and fathers, they have
the most interesting and powerful motives for becoming good
members of the community in which they exist.</p>
<p>The same revolution, effected by the same means, has taken
place amongst the women: and those who were wretched prostitutes,
have imperceptibly been brought to a regular mode of life, and
now form intelligent and laborious mothers of families. But it is
not merely in the moral character of the women, that these
important alterations are discoverable, but also in their
physical condition, the results of which are worthy the
consideration, both of the legislator and the philosopher. For
example, every body knows that the common women of great
capitals, are in general unfruitful; at Petersburgh, and Madrid,
at Paris, and London, pregnancy is a sort of phenomenon amongst
persons of that description; though we are unable to assign any
other cause, than a sort of insusceptibility of conception: the
difficulty of researches, as to this subject, has prevented
philosophers from determining how far this sterility ought to be
attributed to the mode of life of such women; and to what degree
it may be modified or altered, by a change of condition and
manners. But both these problems are resolved, by what takes
place in the singular establishment that we are describing. After
residing a year or two at Port Jackson, most of the English
prostitutes become remarkably fruitful; and what, in my opinion,
clearly proves that the effect arises much less from the climate,
than from the change of manners amongst the women, is, that,
those prostitutes in the colony, who are permitted by the police
to continue in their immoral way of life, remain barren the same
as in Europe. Hence we may be permitted to deduce the important
physiological result, that an excess of sexual intercourse
destroys the sensibility of the female organs, to such a degree,
as to render them incapable of conception; while, to restore the
frame to its pristine activity, nothing is necessary but to
renounce those fatal excesses.</p>
<p>While we were reflecting on these numerous and interesting
subjects, all the officers and principal citizens of the colony
were unremitting in their assiduities towards us. Our numerous
sick were received into the government hospital, where the
English surgeons paid them all possible attention. Doctor
Thomson, the chief physician of the colony, directed, the mode of
treatment with the greatest tenderness: and whatever we were in
need of, that the place could furnish, was put at our disposal.
The governor-general gave us an unlimited credit on the public
treasury, and our commodore was furnished with royal printed
checks, to fill up, with any sum that he might wish for; and
these checks, without any other security than the signature of
the French commandant, were accepted by the inhabitants, with a
confidence highly honourable to the government of our country.
Our salt provisions, spirits, and biscuits, were exhausted; but
by means of these checks we obtained fresh supplies; and several
times the magazines of the colony were open to supply us with
articles which our agents could not procure. Thus, by this
generous relief, we were enabled to reclothe our crews, who were
in want of every thing; repair our ships, purchase one, instead
of that we had lost; and be completely prepared for continuing
our voyage.</p>
<p>At the same time, our scientific researches met with every
encouragement; a guard of English soldiers were appointed
expressly to protect our observatory, which we placed on the
north point of the eastern bank of Sydney Cove. The whole of the
country was open to the excursions of our naturalists, and we
were even permitted to wear our arms, as were the persons of our
suite: while guides and interpreters were furnished us for our
longest journies. In short, the English government behaved to us
with such generosity, that they acquired our warmest
gratitude.</p>
<p>The principal object of our stay at Port Jackson, was, that we
might devote proper attention to every part of the surrounding
country. While our crews were repairing the damages the ships had
sustained, and getting in fresh supplies of provisions, the
naturalists extended their researches to every branch of the
physical history of this interesting country. The scurvy, which
had affected all my joints with swellings and stiffness, had
already begun to yield to the influence of diet and the climate;
and as soon as I was able, I went down to the coast of Botany
Bay, the harbour of which is situated some leagues to the south
of Port Jackson. A large and commodious road leads from Sydney
Town to this great bay: all the intermediate country is sandy and
barren, and appears unfit for any kind of cultivation;
consequently one does not meet with any European habitations.
After passing the high hill, at the foot of which is the
establishment of Mr. Palmer, the country opens upon a sandy
plain, which extends as far as the swampy banks of Cook's River.
Various species of Hakea, Styphelia, Eucalyptus, Banksia,
Embothryum, and Casuarina, grow amidst these sands, and large
spaces are occupied entirely with the Xanthorea, the gigantic
stalks of which grow to the height of from eighteen to twenty
feet. In the distance may be perceived the smoke of a few huts,
belonging to those unfortunate hordes of natives who exist on
these desolate shores.</p>
<p>As you approach towards Botany Bay, the land gradually sinks,
till you reach the dangerous swamps formed by the brackish waters
of Cook's River, towards the north, and of George River to the
south. These marshes are so extensive, and often so deep, that it
is impossible in many parts to pass them, if you want to reach
the sea. On their banks, and all along the two rivers just
mentioned, vegetation is very active: a thousand species of trees
and shrubs, which cover the surface of the soil, afforded to that
part of the country which we occupied, a delightful appearance;
it was this circumstance, which deceived captain Cook and his
brave companions; for they supposed the land to be unparalleled
in point of fertility. It would have been well, however, if this
bay, so celebrated by those navigators, had justified the great
ideas which they formed of it. Obstructed by large banks of mud,
and open at the south to the easterly winds, it does not afford
to vessels that security which they are often in need of; while
the marshy nature of the soil in its environs, renders it at once
unhealthy, and scarcely fit for ordinary cultivation. Hence,
commodore Phillip, after reconnoitring Port Jackson, was induced
to abandon Botany Bay; and since that period, there has been no
other establishment at it, except a kiln for the preparation of
lime, which is made from the shells that abound on this part of
the coasts. Botany Bay, and its environs, are called by the
natives, Gwea, and to this country belong the tribe of savages,
called Gwea Gal, who acknowledge Bennil-long for their chief.</p>
<p>Twenty-five miles, or thereabouts, to the west of Sydney Town,
is the town of Rose Hill, or Parramatta; which I took the
earliest opportunity of visiting; The principal physician of le
Naturaliste, M. Bellefin, accompanied me; a serjeant of the New
South Wales regiment acted as our guide and was ordered by
colonel Paterson, to obtain for such facilities as we might
require, to pursue our researches. A large road leads from
Sydney-Town to Parramatta; it is not paved, but is well made, and
kept in good condition. It is almost every where wide enough for
three, carriages to pass abreast, and bridges have been thrown
over such parts of it as are interrupted by the waters; so that
the traveller meets with no obstacle on his journey. Having been
opened through vast forests, that were never before assailed by
the axe, this grand road appears at a distance, like an immense
avenue of foliage and verdure. A charming freshness, and an
agreeable shade always prevail in this con continuous bower, the
silence of which is interrupted only, by the singing and chirping
of the richly-plumed parroquets, and other birds which inhabit
it.</p>
<p>The whole ground, over which you proceed to Rose Hill, is
flat, with the exception of a few insignificant hillocks. In
proportion as you recede from the sea-shore, the soil becomes
less barren, and affords great varieties of vegetation. In some
parts there are large spaces between the trees, which is covered
by a very fine and sweet-scented grass, that forms a beautiful
verdant carpet, and affords pasturage to numerous flocks of
excellent sheep. The mild temperature of the climate, the absence
of all kinds of ferocious beasts, together with the particular
species, and agreeable odour of most of the vegetables, have been
so favourable to these useful animals that the finest kinds of
Spain and England, thrive as well here as on theirs native soil.
Already the wool of these antarctic animals is found to be
superior to the rich fleeces of Asturias; and the English
manufacturers pay dearer for it; because they are convinced of
its superiority. This discovery will probably soon open to Great
Britain, a branch of commerce as easy as it is lucrative.</p>
<p>Woods here and there open to the view, and the traveller
perceives amidst them, spots which have been cleared by the
settlers; and some of which are extensive: he discovers on them,
many pretty habitations, shaded by beautiful trees; and
contemplates with pleasing emotion, these new fields, where the
feeble grass of the north rises from the decay of the powerful
Eucalyptus; he discovers with delight on these distant grounds,
the most useful animals of his own country; the bulls frisk about
with a vigour equal, or even superior, to that of the cold
meadows of Ireland; while the cow, more fecund, gives a greater
quantity of milk in these mild climates, than in ours. The
English horse also, appears with the same strength and spirit
that he exhibits on the banks of the Thames; while the European
hog is improved, by numerous crosses, with those of the South-sea
islands; which are superior in size, as well as quality of fat
and lean. All kinds of poultry have succeeded as well as the
larger animals, and the farm-yards are stocked with different
varieties of geese, ducks, turkies, pheasants, &amp;c. several of
which are preferable to the finest of the European species.</p>

<br>
<b><small>16. Another View of Part of Sydney-Town and Port
Jackson</small></b></p>
The traveller receives additional pleasure on visiting the
interior of the habitations. Beneath their agreeable roofs, in
the midst of vast forests, live in perfect tranquillity, those
banditti, who but a short time before were the terror of Europe,
and who, familiarized with guilt, were in constant expectation of
the punishment of death: here now live those numerous robbers,
rogues, and pickpockets, those criminals of every kind, who in
the mother-country appeared to increase in proportion to the
progress of civilization. All these unfortunate wretches, who
were the disgrace and odium of their country, have become, by the
most inconceivable metamorphosis, laborious cultivators, and
happy and peaceable members of their community. Indeed, murders,
or robberies, are scarcely ever heard of amongst them; so that in
this respect the most perfect security prevails throughout the
colony; a happy consequence of laws as severe as they are
beneficent.
<p>In order to enjoy at our ease these striking scenes, M.
Bellefin and I often entered the rural habitations. We were every
where received in the most obliging manner; and when we observed
the tender cares of the mothers towards their children, and
reflected that only a few years before these very women,
destitute of every tender affection and delicate sentiment, were
disgusting prostitutes, the sudden revolution in their moral
conduct gave rise to reflections of the most gentle and
philanthropic nature.</p>
<p>At length we arrived in sight of Parramatta: it is seated in
the middle of a fine plain, on the banks of a river of the same
name, which can be ascended by small vessels, as high as the town
itself. It is not so large as Sydney Town; but contains about a
hundred and eighty houses, which form a grand street, parallel
with the river, and intersected at right angles by another
smaller street, which, at one end, terminates with a stone
bridge, and has at the other the church; the latter edifice,
which is built in a rude and heavy style, was not quite finished
at the time of our visit; indeed, the building is conducted with
less rapidity than it might be, because the governors of the
colony attach, with reason, more importance to the other branches
of their administration; such as the hospitals, prisons, public
manufactories, the clearing of land, the fisheries, navigation,
&amp;c. for which they reserve proper funds and disposable
hands.</p>
<p>At one of the extremities of the great street of Parramatta
are barracks, capable of accommodating from two hundred and fifty
to three hundred infantry. They are built of brick, in the form
of a horse-shoe, and have in front, a well-gravelled parade,
where the troops of the garrison go through their ordinary
exercises: these troops consisted, at the time of our visit, of a
company of an hundred and twenty men, belonging to the New South
Wales regiment, under the command of captain Piper.</p>
<p>The whole population of Parramatta, including the garrison,
and the inhabitants of the neighbouring farms, is estimated at
from fourteen to fifteen hundred souls; nearly all of whom are
employed in the cultivation of land, the rearing of cattle, and
the exercise of a few of the mechanical arts. The town contains
an hospital, which is well regulated and of which the principal
physician is Mr. D'Arcy Wentworth; a strong prison, a house of
industry for female convicts, a public school for the young girls
of the colony, &amp;c. This town is also the chief residence of
the justice of the for the county of Cumberland, and will become
in time the seat of the whole civil administration of the colony;
those branches which relate to navigation, commerce and war,
being already established at Sydney.</p>
<p>Towards the western extremity of the grand street of
Parramatta, you discover the elevation called Rose Hill, from
which the town first received its name; but it was afterwards
called Parramatta; that being the appellation which the natives
give to this part of the country, and which has generally
prevailed amongst the English themselves. The whole eastern front
of Rose Hill, which is towards the town, is a very gentle
declivity, on which appears the fine garden belonging to the
government, in which many interesting experiments are made, with
a view to naturalize foreign vegetables: here also are collected,
the most remarkable of the indigenous plants, intended to enrich
the famous royal gardens of Kew. It is from this spot that
England has, at various times, acquired most of her treasures in
the vegetable kingdom; and which have enabled the English
botanists to publish many important volumes. An enlightened
botanical professor, who combines modesty with indefatigable
exertion, had just arrived from Europe at the time of our visit,
to superintend the garden of Parramatta; and the learned colonel
Paterson, to whom New South Wales is indebted for this
establishment, has never ceased to taken lively interest in its
success.</p>
<p>The part of Rose Hill that is opposite to Parramatta presents
an abrupt section, and forms a grand crescent, which one might,
at first view, suppose to be the work of man. At the base of this
singular hill, runs a rivulet, which, in common weather, is not
remarkable; but when the inundations occur, which are so frequent
and terrible in these regions, it becomes a source of disasters
to the neighbouring plantations.</p>
<p>At the summit of Rose Hill, is the government house of
Parramatta, which is called the Crescent; it is simple, elegant,
and well laid out, though it derives its principal importance
from its situation, which overlooks the town, as well as from its
meadows, its forest, and river. This mansion is generally
uninhabited; through its capacity and internal regulations are
such, that whenever the governor-general and lieutenant-governor
come to it for a few days, they can have every accommodation for
themselves, and their whole suite.</p>
<p>To increase the natural charms of so fine a site, the English
governors established at Rose Hill the first Vineyards of the
colony: if the vine could have flourished at the back Of the
crescent I have mentioned, the government-house would then have
been buried, as it were, in a rich amphitheatre of vines and
verdure; but experience proved, that this position was, of all
those that might have been fixed on, the most unfavourable for
the culture that was intended. In fact, this part of Rose Hill is
exposed to the N.W., and nothing is more dreadful than the winds
which blow from that point in New Holland.</p>
<p>Hence, notwithstanding the success which seemed to be ensured
to plantations of this kind, by the climate and the nature of the
soil, the greatest sacrifices have hitherto only been attended
with the most discouraging results. In vain has the English
government caused to be brought to New South Wales, the finest
plants of the Cape of Good Hope, the Canaries, Madeira, and
Bourdeaux; in vain has it caused to be planted, at a great
expence, European vineyards at Port Jackson; the activity and
information of these men, have been rendered nugatory by the
north west winds. During a second journey which I made with
colonel Paterson to Parramatta, I had frequent opportunities of
interrogating those vine-growers, two of whom were natives of
Bourdeaux: they were uniformly of opinion that the climate and
soil were perfectly congenial with the vine, but it appeared to
them impossible that that plant could succeed, as long as the
vineyards were confined to Rose Hill. "In no part of the world",
said they to me, "does the vine shoot with more rapidity and
vigour than here: all its appearances for two or three months
combine to promise the most abundant harvests; but the moment the
slightest breeze sets in from the north west, then all our hopes
are dissipated&mdash;blossoms, buds, and leaves, nothing can
resist its devouring rage."</p>
<p>Profiting by experience, governor King at length resolved to
remove the vineyards to another part of the country, which the
vine-growers themselves had fixed upon, and which appeared to
them likely to justify their high expectations. But whatever may
be the result of this new attempt, it is certain that the English
government will not abandon the culture of the vine till the last
extremity, and that it will make every sacrifice to ensure
success, which would soon be of the greatest advantage to its
country. In fact, by one of those chances which are
inconceivable, Great Britain is the only one of the great
maritime powers, which does not cultivate the vine, either in its
own territory or its colonies; notwithstanding the consumption of
wine on board its fleets and throughout its vast regions is
immense. Compelled to derive the vast supply from Portugal,
France, Spain, and even from Holland, it sees with regret, a
great part of the capital of the nation absorbed every year, by
purchases of this nature, and aspires with ardour to the means of
liberating itself from such an enormous tribute. And it is with
this, view that it has attempted the conquest or possession of
the Cape of Good Hope and the Canaries. But we will return to the
disappointment which the English have experienced in their
exertions for this purpose at Botany Bay, where the north-west
winds afford numerous phenomena which are peculiar to New
Holland, and the explanation, or even the existence of which,
seems to contradict the most incontestible principles of the
general philosophy of the great continents, and their
meteorological history.</p>
<p>Cumberland county, which comprises all the present
establishments of the English in New South Wales, is bounded to
the east by the great Southern Ocean; to the north by Broken Bay
and Hawkesbury River, of which we shall soon have to give a
description; to the south by, Botany Bay and George's River; and
to the west by a chain of mountains which envelopes the whole
county in a sort of semicircle. This range of mountains is only a
small part of the grand chain, which, from the most northern
chain of New Holland, stretches along the eastern coast of that
continent, as far as its southern extremity, and unites itself by
the group of Kent and the Furneaux isles, with the lofty hills of
Diemen's Land, which appear to be at once the prolongation and
the extreme point of the chain. In their arrangement, these
mountains present a singular similarity to that of the Andes of
South America. Indeed, what nature has done for the latter
country she has reproduced here, but in a manner absolutely
inverse. It is to the eastern coast of New Holland, that the
mountains in question belong; for scarcely any traces of them are
discoverable along the western shores of the continent, besides
which, all that has been observed of this last portion, indicates
that there exists at that part, plains similar to those of
Guiana, Brasil, and Paraguay. Unfortunately there is a wide
difference between the latter plains and those of New Holland;
the former, clothed in every direction with a stratum of rich and
deep vegetable mould, and watered throughout by grand rivers and
innumerable streams, display at all times a prodigious fertility,
while the melancholy shores of the western parts of New Holland,
covered with unprofitable sand, and having no kind of river, but
merely a few simple streams of fresh water, seem to have been
devoted by nature to the most afflicting barrenness. From this
comparison, I shall proceed to speak of the Cumberland mountains
in particular.</p>
<p>These mountains, though commonly known by the names of
Carmarthen and Lansdown Mountains, are so generally called the
<i>Blue Mountains</i> by the English colonists, and others who
have written concerning them down to the present time, that I
consider it indispensable to speak of them under this last
denomination. On a clear day, these mountains are easily
distinguished from the upper parts of Sydney Town, that is to
say, at the distance of about fifty miles they then appear like a
bluish curtain, rising but little above the horizon, and
preserving a considerable uniformity. When seen from Castle Hill,
that is, at about twenty miles' distance, their summits are less
regular, and a few of them are more prominent than the rest;
their plains are distinguished by several lines, which seem to
rise more and more proportion as they advance towards the
interior of the country, and their colour becoming much darker,
indicates that their constitution is harsh and barren. On
observing them from the environs of Hawkesbury, a distance of
eight or ten miles, they seem, according to the account of M.
Bailly, like a vast curtain, which bounds the horizon on the
N.W.: there is no fracture or peak to break their uniformity; but
a horizontal line, beneath which is perceivable regular plain of
a brownish colour, completes the melancholy aspect. On advancing
to the bases of these mountains, M. Bailly recognised them to be
completely uniform throughout their whole extent; the only
fracture which appeared in this quarter, was one, front which
issues Grose River, the source of which has not been discovered,
but which appears to come from a great distance in the interior
of the mountains, and which forms, by its junction with the River
Nepean, the famous Hawkesbury River, of which we shall have many
occasions to speak in the sequel of this history.</p>
<p>The height of the first range of Blue Mountains, is scarcely
more than from two to three hundred fathoms; and the substance of
the first plains is entirely composed of the Same species of
quartzous freestone, as forms all the environs of Sydney Town.
Every part to which the English have proceeded abounds with
nothing but this stone; and though they have travelled more than
forty miles in a right line across the mountains, they have not
found any species of primitive rock. Nevertheless, from the
collections made by Messrs. Depuch and Bailly, in the deep bed of
Hawkesbury River, it is evident that the Blue Mountains are of
primitive thud granitic origin.</p>
<p>The small apparent height of these mountains, and their
uniformity, prevented the English from perceiving all the
difficulty that would attend any survey of them: they therefore
contented themselves on the first establishment of the colony,
with sending men to escalade their summits. At the same time
several convicts wishing to liberate themselves from their
slavery, attempted to pass over this shocking chain: some of the
unfortunate men met their death in the attempt, and the rest were
constrained to abandon it.</p>
<p>It was not till the month of December 1789, that the
government thought proper to take any particular notice of the
Western Mountains. At this period, lieutenant Dawes set off to
reconnoitre them with a large detachment of troops, and
provisions for six days; but, after encountering nine days of
fatigue and danger he returned to Port Jackson, without being
able to proceed more than nine miles in the interior of the
mountains. According to his report, his course had been stopped
by impassable ravines, and chains of rocks which were high and
precipitous.</p>
<p>Eight months after the expedition of lieutenant Dawes, namely,
in August 1790, captain Tench set off with a strong party of
soldiers and all the necessary articles for passing the
mountains; but this excursion was attended with no better success
than the former. These failures having discouraged the English
government, three years passed away before another enterprise of
this kind was attempted; and excepting some few journeys of
individuals, not less abortive than the preceding, nothing was
done to ascertain the nature of the Western country. At length,
however, the attention of the public was recalled to the Blue
Mountains by the celebrated colonel Paterson, who was authorised
to undertake a new expedition, of which every circumstance seemed
to indicate the success. This gentleman, after having
reconnoitred the entrance of Broken Bay, was to ascend Hawkesbury
River, as far as it was navigable, and thus arrive at the very
base of the mountains over which he was to pass. To facilitate
this navigation, there were built two canoes, extremely light and
thin, on board of which were embarked an abundance of provisions,
ammunition, rope-ladders, graplins, cordage, &amp;c, A strong
body of soldiers accompanied the colonel, and there were selected
for his suite several bold and hardy Scotch Highlanders; while
some natives of Port Jackson, were to serve as guides and
interpreters. Colonel Paterson, in short, having been accustomed
from his infancy to climb the most difficult mountains it
Scotland, his native country, and being familiarised with all
kinds of privations arising from such an enterprise, in
consequence of his arduous travels through the deserts of Africa,
seemed to be capable of ensuring all possible success to the
experiment, with the arrangements that had been made.
Nevertheless, all these precautions could not overcome the
obstacles that presented themselves; and Mr. Paterson, like his
predecessors, was obliged to yield to the prodigious difficulties
of his mission. At length, after having discovered <i>the
Grose</i>, which empties itself into the Hawkesbury, above
Richmond Hill, the colonel continued to advance for about the
distance of ten miles, passing several cataracts, one of which
had a rapid, at the rate of ten or twelve miles an hour. Soon
afterwards, the navigation became impracticable, and one of the
canoes was sunk, while the other struck on the trunks of trees
that obstructed the passage of the river. In vain did the
travellers attempt to continue their route towards the interior
of the mountains: their difficulties increased at every step: one
of these mountains was not less than four hundred feet in
perpendicular height: frightful precipices every where presented
themselves; and no sooner had one summit been escaladed, than
others appeared still more barren and difficult of access; till
at length it was necessary to retrace their steps. From the point
at which they had arrived, the English saw before them an immense
peak, which the colonel named Peak Harrington. It was also during
this excursion that they had an opportunity, for the first time,
of conversing with the <i>B&eacute;-dia-Gal</i>, a singular race
of people, who live in the forests contiguous to Hawkesbury
River, and who differ from the natives of Port Jackson and Botany
Bay in their manners, language, mode of living, and particularly
by an extremely remarkable characteristic in their physical
constitution. All the individuals of this race have their arms
and thighs of an inordinate length, comparatively to the rest of
their frame: but our remarks on this topic will be given with
more interest in another part of our work.</p>
<p>A year had scarcely elapsed since the enterprise here
mentioned, before some other individuals ascended the Western
Mountains. In August, 1794, one Hacking, quarter-master of the
Sirius, a bold and spirited man, went out with a few intrepid
fellows like himself, to pass those impregnable barriers. Their
efforts were not altogether useless: they penetrated about twenty
miles farther than those who had preceded: but after having
cleared several very high summits, Hacking himself was
constrained to retrograde. Beyond the different peaks, which they
reconnoitred, the mountains presented new shapes and summits,
which he conceived less accessible than those he had attained.
From north to south these mountains formed an immense and
impregnable bulwark, most frightfully barren. The mass of these
interior peaks was apparently constituted of a reddish and
ferruginous freestone; and amongst these terrific mountains they
only saw a single savage, who fled precipitately on observing
them; nor did they meet with any quadruped, except a species of
red kangaroo, not yet known to naturalists, and which will
doubtlessly prove to be one of the most curious species of this
genus, being remarkable for its peculiar manners and physical
conformation.</p>
<p>Amongst the most interesting characters who have yet appeared
in the southern colonies of England, must be placed Mr. Bass, the
surgeon of his majesty's ship Reliance, the same who in a slight
whale sloop, adventured in an unknown sea, and discovered that
famous strait to which public gratitude has affixed his name.
This extraordinary man also attempted to pass the Blue Mountains;
and in the month of June 1796, he set off, accompanied by a small
number of men of courage and skill. Never was more hardihood
displayed than on this occasion. With his arms and feet protected
by iron crotchets, Mr. Bass several times escaladed horrible
perpendicular mountains: being often stopped by precipices, he
caused himself to be let down by ropes into their abysses. But
even his resolution was of no avail, and after fifteen days of
fatigue and unparalleled danger, he returned to Sydney,
confirming, by his own failure, all that had been asserted of the
impossibility of going beyond those extraordinary ramparts. From
the summit of one very elevated peak, Mr. Bass saw before him at
the distance of forty or fifty miles, a second chain of
mountains, much higher than any of those which he had passed; and
the intermediate space presented neither less dangers nor
obstacles than what he had already encountered. During this
perilous excursion, Mr. Bass and his troop had to suffer a want
of water; their provisions were exhausted, and these barren
mountains affording them no means of a supply, they were reduced
to a state of the most devouring thirst. "If, by chance," said
this intrepid traveller to me, "we met with a small portion of
moist earth, or even some mud in the holes of the rocks, we were
glad to apply our handkerchiefs to the surface of such
substances, and suck them as hard as possible, in order to obtain
what little humidity they possessed."</p>
<p>Such had been, previous to our arrival at Port Jackson, the
different attempts that had been made to open a passage over the
Blue Mountains; and such were the unfortunate results. Disgusted
by so many sacrifices and useless efforts, the English government
for several years were indifferent as to this object. My
companions and I, however, succeeded in persuading governor King,
during our stay, to order a new expedition to the Western
Mountains: this was in the month of October, 1802, and the
conducting of it was entrusted to M. Bareillier, a French
emigrant, who was engineer to the colony, and aid-de-camp to the
governor. I was very anxious to make one of this interesting
expedition; but governor King did not think himself justified in
so far extending his complaisance. In addition to all the
precautions which had been taken on the previous enterprises, the
ingenious one was adopted, of establishing a chain of posts at
moderate distances, which, the farther the expedition advanced,
were stationed at shorter stages: thus, by means of these men an
active line of communication was kept up between the main body of
the troop and the nearest of the English establishments. M.
Bareillier was not, however, more fortunate than those who had
gone before him; it even appeared, that he could not get as far
as some of his English predecessors, and the only result of his
expedition was, the procuring of a small number of specimens of
freestone, similar to what appeared on the sea-shore, and which
is reproduced on the whole extent of the country, surrounded by
the mountains.</p>
<p>What is most singular in the history of these mountains is,
that the natives of the country are as little acquainted with
them as the Europeans: they all agree in the impossibility of
passing that western barrier; and what they relate of the
countries which they suppose to exist on the other side, clearly
proves that those countries are totally unknown to them. They
assert that there is an immense lake, on the banks of which live
white people, like the English, who dress in the same manner, and
have large towns, with houses built of stone. We shall afterwards
see, that the existence of this great lake, this sort of Caspian
sea, is as improbable as that of the white people and their
civilization: I shall merely observe, that it is likely these
ideas of the natives have been inspired by the establishment of
the English colony.</p>
<p>In other respects, the savages of these parts have a sort of
religious terror for the Blue Mountains: they think them the
residence of a kind of evil spirit, whom they represent by a
variety of grotesque figures. They suppose that this terrible
d&aelig;mon hurls amongst them from the summits of the mountains,
thunder, inundations, and burning winds, which lay waste their
territories. However ridiculous this belief may be in itself, it
nevertheless has its cause in their observations of the natural
phenomena: for it is in fact, from the tops of these mountains
that proceed all the plagues which infest the country. Considered
in this point of view, most, of the religious ideas of people in
general are equally worthy, of the attention of the naturalist
and the philosopher and we shall furnish new and interesting
proofs of this great truth.</p>
<p>I have now given a rapid sketch of the general history of the
mountains of the county of Cumberland: this digression, was
indispensable, in order to obtain exact information respecting
the extraordinary phenomena which are presented by the north-west
winds, and which phenomena are inconceivable when the origin of
those winds is compared with them.</p>
<p>We have just seen that all the western and north-western parts
of this portion of New Holland, are occupied by a very extensive
chain of mountains, the height of which appears to be equal to
that of the most elevated chains already, known. Who would not be
induced to think, from such a constitution, that the winds which
pass over these mountains must be characterised by a colder
temperature? This, consequence is so natural and so conformable
to all the principles of natural philosophy, that it would seem
not to admit of any kind of modification; and, nevertheless, it
receives, in the case in question, the most decided and absolute
exception; as if the atmosphere of New Holland, as well as the
animals and the vegetables of this singular continent, has its
peculiar laws, which differ from all the principles of our
sciences and all the rules of our systems.</p>
<p>Far different, in fact, from the greater or less degree of
cold which they might seem to be obliged to acquire from the
immense mountains which they pass, the north and north-west winds
are, in the county of Cumberland, real fiery currents compared to
those of the most dreadful kind which occur in Africa. Their
devouring heat destroys whatever happens to be exposed to its
action: nothing can resist the fervor of the austral-campsin; in
a few moments it parches up the most active vegetation; under its
powerful influence the springs and rivers become dry; and even
the animals perish by thousands when opposed to its fatal career.
But as in this part of the world, effects cease to bear any
relation to their causes, it is on experience alone that we must
rely; and in this respect, after the unanimous evidence of the
most observant inhabitants of New South Wales, we must believe
the authority of the most enlightened historian which this
country has yet acquired.</p>
<p>In the month of February, 1791, Collins made the following
observations: "At this period," said he, "most of the torrents
and rivulets were dried up, and they were obliged to hollow out
the bed of Sydney River, in order to procure scarcely as much
water as would supply the town. On the 10th and 11th of this
month, the heat became so great, that at Sydney Town Fahrenheit's
thermometer rose in the shade as high as 105,0&deg;, being equal
to 32,44&deg; of Reaumur. At Rose Hill the heat was so excessive,
that thousands of large bats perished; in many parts of the port
the land was covered with different species of birds, some just
suffocated, and others absolutely reduced to charcoal by the
heat, while several were seen to drop dead in their flight. The
streams which were not yet dried up were so much infected by the
great number of those birds and bats, which, having descended to
slake their thirst, had expired on their banks, that the water
for several days was corrupted by them. The wind then blew from
the north-west, and did great injury to the gardens, consuming
all before it. Persons who were obliged to go out on
indispensable business, declared that it was impossible to stand
with their face for five minutes towards the point from which
this wind proceeded." This is only a small portion of the
statement given by Collins in his Account of New South Wales. The
facts which he mentions are also confirmed by the observations of
Phillip, Hunter, Watts, Tench, King, &amp;c. and from the whole
of which we may deduce the following consequence.</p>
<p>The winds which pass over New Holland from north-west to
south-east, appear in the county of Cumberland with the double
character of extreme dryness and heat, notwithstanding the extent
and the height of the mountains over which they pass before they
reach the colony.</p>
<p>These results and others which are analogous, may be applied
with interest to the solution of the grand problem of the
physical state of the interior of New Holland. We shall now
pursue our description of the territory of Parramatta.</p>
<p>I have already observed, that the numerous woods in the
vicinity of this town, the abundance of herbage, and its
excellent quality, are calculated to form an immense pasturage in
this part of New South Wales, proper for rearing all kinds of
cattle. Such an advantage could not escape the attention of the
English government; and from the first foundation of the colony,
it sent hither all the large domestic animals which could be
spared from the stock of the new establishment. They have since
so rapidly multiplied; that in the divisions belonging to the
state alone, there were a short time before our arrival at Port
Jackson, 1800 horned cattle, of which 514 were bulls, 121 oxen,
and 1165 cows. The breeding of these animals is so rapid, that in
the space of only eleven months, the number of oxen and cows has
been extended from 1856 to 2450; which gives for the whole year
an increase of 650 head, or one-third of the entire number. If
the increase be calculated in this proportion for a period of
thirty years, it is evident that though half the number might be
annually consumed, New Holland would be covered with innumerable
herds of cattle.</p>
<p>The sheep have been still more fertile; indeed so rapidly do
they breed in these distant pasturages, that captain Arthur, one
of the richest landholders in New South Wales, does not hesitate
to assert, in a memoir which he has just published on this
subject, that in twenty years New Holland alone will be able to
furnish England with all the wool which she now imports from
other countries, and for which she pays annually about
1,800,000<i>l</i>. sterling. Captain Arthur himself, is the owner
of more than 4000 sheep: I have seen several of his flocks, and
they appear to me to be uncommonly beautiful. The farm of captain
Arthur, which is in the finest possible state, comprises 3400
acres of land, of which 3160 are pasture, 40 sown with wheat, and
the rest is occupied with various kinds of less important
cultivation. He has also on his farm 27 horses and mares, and 182
horned cattle, of which three are bulls, 55 oxen, and 124 cows.
"The climate of New Holland", says the captain, in his
interesting memoir, "is particularly favourable to the
multiplication of sheep with fine wool, and when the unlimited
extent of the fine pasturages is considered, it is evident that
in a few years, millions of these animals might be raised without
any other expence than the payment of the shepherds. I have
calculated, that with proper attention, my flocks would multiply
thirtyfold in thirty months, and experience has already proved,
that this calculation is below their actual increase. Specimens
of their wool", continues he, "have been submitted to the
examination of the best judges in England, who admit that they
are equal to those of Spain, and even appear to be finer than
most of the latter."</p>
<p>Captain Arthur is not the only person who has derived in an
honourable way the greatest advantages from the sheep of New
Holland. In the course of my different excursions, I had frequent
opportunities of seeing flocks as remarkable far their beauty and
number as those of this gentleman. Mr. Palmer has about 800
sheep, which he feeds on 392 acres of pasture. Mr. Marsden has a
much greater number, and most of the other colonists have their
particular flocks, wandering in the midst of woods, without
enemies of any species, and ignorant of the frosts of winter, or
the cold humidity of the autumn of our climates, protected from
the heat of the sun by the shades of the forests which they
inhabit, and feeding always on the most delicate and aromatic
herbs, these flocks acquire a degree of strength and beauty which
given them a perfection hitherto unknown. On the other hand, the
greatest advantage has arisen from crossing the hairy sheep of
the Cape and of Bengal with those of the woolly kind from England
and Spain: thus, in less than ten years they have succeeded in
transforming the hair of the animals from Africa and Asia into a
wool which is not yet very long, but is remarkable for a great
degree of fineness, and for its soft and silky quality. "The
following fact", said Mr. Arthur "proves the astonishing rapidity
of this amelioration: I have the fleece of one of my sheep of the
common kind, which the manufacturers value at 9<i>d</i>. per
pound but when I shewed them the fleece of a lamb proceeding from
this name sheep and a Spanish ram, they valued it at 3<i>s</i>.
per pound. But it is not merely in the quality of the wool that
this amelioration is observable; the advantage is also in the
weight of the fleece: for example, the heaviest of those fleeces
in 1800 weighed scarcely 3 lb. 8 oz.; in 1802 their average
weight was 5lb.; and at this time the beauty of the wool was so
great, that each pound fetched 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>With respect to the sheep of the Spanish breed, which form the
principal stock of the numerous flocks of New South Wales, they
proceed from a considerable number of fine Merinos which the
English government has transported to Port Jackson at different
periods; and thirty rams of the most beautiful kind, which were
sent by the court of Spain to the viceroy of Peru during the last
war, form a part of this invaluable stock, they haying been taken
by an English ship within sight of the port at which they were be
landed.</p>
<p>In the course of my journies to the environs of Parramatta, I
succeeded in procuring a variety of animals as beautiful as they
are various. Upwards of 150 species of new insects had been
gradually added to my collections of this kind, and amongst those
species were forty butterflies mostly of the grandest colours
that can be conceived. Amongst the <i>Coleopter&aelig;</i> is an
admirable <i>Cetonia</i>, to which I have given the name of
<i>Cetonia Orpheus</i>, on account of the golden lyre, which
appears in the most regular form on the back of this insect, the
general colour of which is exactly that of as emerald.</p>
<p>The family of Lizards, which in every part of New Holland
appears in so many singular species, has afforded me several of
much interest. One of these lizards belongs to the genus
<i>Stellion</i>, of Cuvier, and is distinguished by the
extraordinary flatness of its body, which is no more than ten
lines thick, though four inches long and five inches broad, which
gives the body of this animal some slight resemblance to that of
cramp-fish. Its &aelig;rial goitre, which is extremely large, is
of a deep blue colour.</p>
<p>Among the Scinca of the new genus, similar to that which have
thought it necessary to establish under the same of
<i>Scincoida</i>, as well as amongst the Tupinambis and the
Geckoes Parramatta afforded me several very remarkable species. I
these procured that singular lizard which the celebrated Shaw has
described under the name of <i>Gecko Platurus</i>, or the Gecko
with a large tail; but it appears to me so different in its
conformation and habits from the Gecko, properly so called, that
I have chosen to separate it, in order to make it a type of a new
genus, which, under the name of <i>Geckoides</i>, N. will
immediately follow that of the Geckos in the natural order, as
well as in that of the classifications of modern naturalists.</p>
<p>I also collected two species of frogs which were hitherto
unknown, and one of which I have described by the name of <i>Rana
pustulosa</i>, the other by that of <i>Rana pollicefera</i>,
became it has at its hind feet a little projecting appendage,
which at first view might be taken for a sixth toe. The toad
genus also afforded me two new species, which I named <i>Bufo
Leucogaster</i>, and <i>Bufo Proteus</i>; the individuals of the
first species have a brilliant white belly, and those of the
second display a great variety of colours. The protean toad is
one of the smallest that is known, as it measures scarcely one
inch in length; while, by its agreeable and varied colours, it
seems to be separate from the disgusting genus to which it
belongs. I also collected a number of new species of <i>Hyla</i>,
to which I have given such names as accord with their respective
appearance. Amongst the terrestrial and fluvial shells I likewise
made several interesting discoveries; as also amongst the worms,
and the fish of the river of Parramatta: but such was the
abundance of new objects that came before me, that I was obliged
to sacrifice particulars, in order to admit the general and
simple enumeration which it was necessary for me to make.</p>
<p>Having thus finished my labours, I returned with my friend, M.
Bellefin, to Sydney Town: but, before leaving Parramatta, it may
perhaps be amusing if I say something of the singular host with
whom we lodged during our stay in this town. This man was a
French Jew, named Larra, who, as he told me himself, had been a
thief and a forger of bank notes, and as such, had been
transported to Port Jackson, in the fleet under commodore
Phillip. After having fulfilled his time of condemnation and
slavery, Larra became a free and good citizen. Corrected by
misfortune, of a vice, the results of which had been so serious
to him, he courageously devoted himself to labour, which alone
could prevent him from experiencing misery. Having obtained a
grant of land, he began to cultivate it with much success, and
soon joined his fate to that of a woman of his own nation and
religion, who, like him, had been transported for her infamous
conduct, but who had also been brought by exile and misfortune,
to an inclination for labour, as well as to a more honest line of
life. Supported by the generous aid which the government lavishes
on individuals who conduct themselves well, this couple jointly
tilled a fertile portion of soil, and an abundant harvest was the
fruit of their labours. Larra then directed his industry to other
objects, and engaged in commercial speculations; which succeeded
beyond his hopes. In short, by the most honourable means, he
gradually acquired a fortune; and he is now generally considered
as one of the richest landholders in New South Wales; while the
regularity of his conduct, and the honesty of his character, have
caused him to be respected by the principal civil and military
officers of the colony.</p>
<p>It is necessary to add, that Mr. Larra does not keep a
<i>public</i> tavern, or inn, though all persons who have
business at Parramatta, and wish to be well treated, put up at
his house: we were recommended to him by colonel Paterson, who
had written to him without our knowledge, desiring him to treat
us with all possible respect, the same as if he were present, and
not to accept from us any remuneration. This recommendation of
the lieutenant-governor-general produced such an effect upon our
host, that, during the six days we remained at Parramatta, we
were served with an elegance, and even a luxury, which we could
not suppose obtainable on these shores. The best wines, such as
Madeira, Port, Xeres, Cape, and Bourdeaux, always covered our
tables; we were served on plate, and the decanters and glasses
were of the purest flint; nor were the eatables inferior to the
liquors. Always anxious to anticipate the taste or wishes of his
guests, Mr. Larra caused us to be served in the French style; and
this act of politeness was the more easy to him, because amongst
the convicts who acted as his domestics, was an excellent French
cook, a native of Paris, as well as two others of our countrymen.
However, notwithstanding the letter of colonel Paterson, we had
many instances, while with Mr. Larra, that in his quality of, our
countryman, he consented to receive, even from us, the price of
his hospitality; for which Mr. Paterson displayed a great
resentment against him. For us and our guide he charged
14<i>l</i>. 6<i>s</i>.; though this sum does not appear too much,
considering the sumptuous manner in which we were
entertained.</p>
<p>To return to the three Frenchmen who ire Larra's domestics,
they appeared to us to be overcome with melancholy and remorse:
but this was not the case with another Frenchman, named Morand,
who lived at Sydney Town, and whose history is so singular, that
it deserves to be recorded.</p>
<p>"<i>My only crime", said he, "was that I wished to be a
partner in the Bank of England, without putting in any
stock:</i>" he related his adventure with that sort of easiness
and consequence which could only proceed from the most
extravagant fanaticism. "The war", said Morand, "had just broken
out between Great Britain and France; the forces of the two
nations were opposed; but it appeared to me more easy to destroy
our rival by finances than by arms: I therefore resolved, like a
good patriot, to undertake this ruin, and to complete it in the
very heart of London. If I had succeeded," he exclaimed with
enthusiasm, "France would have erected altars to my memory; but
how has it happened, that, instead of being treated like a thief,
I have not been proclaimed the avenger of my country! Scarcely
had I arrived in England, before I began my operations, and they
succeeded beyond my utmost hopes. Being ably seconded by an
Irishman, not less clever than myself, and who, <i>influenced
like me, by a noble patriotism</i>, showed still more hatred
towards Great Britain, I soon succeeded in counterfeiting the
Bank Notes with such great exactness, that it was even difficult
for ourselves to distinguish from the real ones, those which
issued from our presses. I was beginning to triumph; all my
arrangements were made for inundating England with the produce of
our manufactory; I only waited for some private information with
respect to the manner in which they were to be numbered, when my
companion, whom I had hitherto considered as a <i>very honest
man</i>, took it into his head to <i>steal</i> from our
dep&ocirc;t, a handful of these notes, before I had given them
certain, finishing strokes, which, though trivial, were
indispensable. The consequence was, that he was very soon
apprehended; and as he had not hesitated to <i>forfeit his
honour</i> on one occasion, he had no compunction at acting the
second time like a villain. He disclosed every thing; and I was
taken up and sent with him to a dungeon: all our instruments, all
the contents of our manufactory, were seized; and Great Britain
was saved from the ruin which I had prepared for her!</p>
<p>"Although the proofs of our project were sufficiently clear, I
did not despair, thanks to the nature of the criminal laws in
England, of escaping death; but such was the pusillanimity and
terror of my graceless <i>associate</i>, that I could not doubt
our common fate, if I were obliged to appear at the bar to
confront this weak-minded creature. To prevent my own fate, which
could not interfere with his, <i>I resolved to prevail upon him
to disencumber himself of me</i>; besides, as the author of our
misfortunes, it was very right that he should suffer for them.
The following were the means I took to effect my purpose: in a
very pathetic discourse, I undertook to prove to him, that as our
fate was inevitable, it became us only to think of the means by
which we might prevent pain and ignominy; and that as we were to
die for each other, it would be better to fall like men of
honour, than to expire under the hands of a public executioner.
The Irishman was shocked at my proposal, but could not make up
his mind on the subject: I therefore remonstrated with him, that
if he did not care for his own infamy, he ought to feel for his
children, and spare them from the reproach of being the sons of a
man that was hanged; and that if he could not leave them a
fortune, he ought to have firmness enough to keep them from
shame.</p>
<p>"These last reflections inflamed the Irishman with a noble
resolution! We procured some corrosive sublimate; I pretended to
swallow it, but he took his portion in reality, and there was an
end of him! Being thus released from this <i>weak-minded
knave</i>, I avoided the effect which his appearance would have
against me, and was only sentenced to transportation to this
colony, where I am condemned to pass the rest of my days. The
time of my slavery has expired, and I follow with advantage two
of my early trades, those, of goldsmith and watch-maker. The two
<i>thieves</i> who work with me triple my profits. In a few years
I shall be one of the richest men in the colony; and I should
even now be one of the most happy, if I were not incessantly
tormented with regret at having so unfortunately failed in such
an <i>honourable</i> enterprise, and to see myself on this
occasion regarded like a vile criminal, even by such of you, my
countrymen, who cannot make allowance for the noble principles
that influenced my conduct."</p>

<h3><a name="ch-25" id="ch-25"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>
<p align="center"><i><b>On the remarkable Hydrographical and
Meteorological Phenomena of New Holland.</b></i></p>
<br>
<p>WE apply generally, in Europe, the denomination of
<i>rivulet</i> to the junction of several springs, which
constitute, together, a continued current of fresh water; which,
after a limited course, either empties itself into particular
reservoirs, or into the sea; but which almost always mixes itself
with other currents of the same nature. From this confusion of
several rivulets is formed what we call a <i>river</i>; which,
besides the characters just described, has a more rapid course;
runs to a greater distance over continents, or large islands;
and, in most cases, falls in with similar bodies of water: thus
constituting a third order of currents, for which the French are
the only people who have a distinct appellation, namely, that of
<i>fleuve</i>, or great river. The character of the latter,
besides that of emptying itself immediately into the sea, is,
that it must have a very extensive course, and consist of a
voluminous mass of water.</p>
<p><i>Torrents</i>, however considerable they may be, differ
essentially from rivulets, rivers, and <i>fleuves</i>; as their
course, which is subordinate to the order of the seasons and the
vicissitudes of the atmosphere, is not continual, but merely
periodical. These general notions being well established, we
shall make the application to the particular hydrography of New
Holland; and we have for our consideration a new series of
phenomena, not less singular, perhaps, than those which arise
from the Blue Mountains and the north-west winds.</p>
<p>In the first place, throughout the whole extent of this vast
continent, which comprises more than an hundred thousand square
leagues of solid surface, there is not yet known a single river
of the size of the Marne or the Allier, admitting, however, the
definition which. I have given of the word <i>river</i>. In vain
the navigator, who sails along the shores of this immense land,
hopes that he is frequently about to discover the mouth of a new
river; in vain does he sail to a distance in the continent, with
strong boats, or even with large vessels: the salinity of what he
misconceived to be a river does not diminish, and at length he
perceives that the water has no other motion than what is
imparted to it by the ebbing and flowing of the sea.
Nevertheless, the depth of the water is so considerable, its
width is so great, and it extends so far into the country, that
the illusion is kept up. The navigation is pursued still farther;
numerous creeks are seen, which appear like large rivulets; the
vessels enter them, but no where can fresh water be met with.
Disappointed hope is however still sustained by the imposing
appearance of the principal branch, which continues to afford all
the characteristics of a great riser. Already has the navigator
got to the distance of sixty or eighty miles, and imagines that
he can go much farther! Judge of his disappointment, when he
suddenly finds this majestic river terminate in a miserable
stream of brackish water, incapable of bearing the slightest
boats, and the aqueous contents of which, at some periods of the
year, are scarcely a few inches broad. The astonished voyager
stops his course, and when he discovers that the ebb and flow are
almost as strong at the end of the river as at its mouth, he
cannot conceive how, in so great a space, the declivity of the
land is so insignificant.</p>
<p>Such is the general picture presented by all the rivers of New
Holland: there is not one to which the above description is
inapplicable, without any other modification than what results
from its greater or lest extent. Thus the river George, Cook's
river at Botany Bay, that of Parramatta at Port Jackson, that of
Hawkesbury at Broken Bay, the river Hunter, Endeavour river, all
those in the gulph of Carpentaria, recently discovered by captain
Flinders, the rivers or harbours in the Bay of Sea Dogs, that of
the Swans, that of Geography Bay, that of King George's Harbour,
of the gulphs of Buonaparte and Josephine, of Ports Phillip,
Western, &amp;c. all reproduce a series of phenomena analogous to
those which I have just described. Diemen's Land, notwithstanding
the difference of its geological constitution, affords the same
singularity in all its rivers. Thus the river Huon, the Port of
Swans, with North and Dalrymple rivers, &amp;c. are nothing but a
sort of gulphs, more or less narrow or deep, but all of them
essentially saline, subject to the influence of the tides,
borrowing from them their principal motions, and terminating in
feeble rivulets, which in the hot season are almost entirely
dry.</p>
<p>However singular may appear all the facts that I have
mentioned respecting the rivers of New Holland, they are not the
only particulars that present themselves to our notice; the
character of their inundations is a new theme for meditation and
research; but I must first finish all that relates to my journey
to Parramatta.</p>
<p>It is not only by the opening of agreeable and convenient
roads, that the English government has endeavoured to facilitate
the communications between its colonies and the southern ports of
the country: at the end of 1793, there were established on the
river of Parramatta, a kind of packet boats which daily sailed
between the last-mentioned and Sydney Towns, conveying people and
every sort of merchandize. The passage money is a shilling for
each individual and each hundred weight of goods, and a whole
boat may be engaged tor six shillings.</p>
<p>Besides these means of conveyance, the government keeps
several little vessels, most of which are very elegant and
convenient; they are appropriated exclusively either to the
state, or the principal officers employed by it. M. Bellefin and
I returned to Sydney in one of these vessels; we embarked
opposite the barracks of Parramatta, a part where the river
contains sufficient, water for large sloops, while two hundred
paces farther it is nothing bat a miserable stream, incapable of
bearing the slightest canoe.</p>
<p>In proportion as we leave Parramatta, the bed of the river
extends and becomes deeper, and we soon find ourselves in eight
or ten fathoms water. On both banks one's attention is attracted
by a number of little creeks running up the country, and the
courses of which are agreeably marked out by fine forests. Here
the European has already shown that he exists, by his habitation
and the extensive portions of soil which he has cultivated. Here,
at the verdant entrance of a stream, is discovered the humble
cabin of a new colonist; while the distant sound of the hatchet
announces his efforts and activity: farther on, the eye is
attracted by a natural meadow, in which wander the oxen, cows,
and horses, of a seedy established farm; and the picture is
completed by the first ripening harvests of newly cultivated
fields. Often on the summit of a picturesque hillock, may be
discerned a large and elegant mansion, surrounded by more
considerable cultivated lands, and covered by greater numbers of
flocks and labourers&mdash;all indicating it to be the property
of a rich and industrious owner. The one in question belonged to
Mr. Coxe, the paymaster of the colony, to whom I had been
introduced at colonel Paterson's. As soon as he perceived M.
Bellefin and me, he got into a boat belonging to his farm, and
coming to our vessel, invited us in so pressing a manner to pass
the night at his house, that we could not resist his friendly
solicitation.</p>
<p>While they were preparing, a hasty dinner, we amused ourselves
in going over his farm, every department of which was to us a new
subject of surprise. It was not, however, the only possession of
this kind, which Mr. Coxe had acquired on these banks, for, on a
second voyage which I made to his estate, with colonel Paterson
and his lady, and Mr. Laycock, junior, a lieutenant in the New
South Wales regiment, Mr. Coxe took us all to dinner to another
farm still more rich and elegant than that I have just described;
it is situated more inland, on the side of Castle Hill. The road
which leads from one to the other of these farms, is so wide and
convenient, that we went over it in a carriage: it is between six
and seven miles in length, and to make it, immense loads of
rubbish were necessary. The whole of Mr. Coxe's land amounts to
860 acres, of which more than 300 were sown with wheat, fifteen
with maize, six with barley, and twelve with oats; 349 acres were
reserved for the pasturage of the cattle, which comprised five
horses, three mares, and twenty-seven horned cattle, besides 800
sheep of the finest breeds.</p>
<p>After expressing our gratitude to Mr. Coxe and his lady, for
all the kindness they had shown us, M. Bellefin and I again
embarked, and in a few hours got to Sydney Town.</p>
<p>While I was making the various observations that have just
been committed to print, my worthy friend M. Lesueur had been
employed in forming a rich ornithological collection; he had
killed and prepared no less than 200 birds, and had amassed in
our repository 68 quadrupeds; besides which, a great number of
sketches and paintings had been executed.</p>
<p>In the mean while our crews, exhausted by long privations and
horrible epidemics, were not capable of man&oelig;uvring our
ships, and experience had proved to us, that those ships were too
large and strong for the geographical operations which we had to
pursue both on the south-west and north-west coast of New
Holland. It was therefore resolved to send the Naturalist to
France, after withdrawing front that ship almost all the able
seamen which she possessed, and replacing them by the
convalescent and valetudinarians of the Geographer. A cutter of
thirty tons was then building in the dock-yard of a ship builder
of the colony: this was bought for our service, and the command
of it was given to M. L. Freycinet, the acting lieutenant of the
Naturalist, and the principal author of the geographical labours
which were performed on board that vessel. Captain Hamelin
himself was to return to Europe, and to lay before the government
the results of the voyage.</p>
<p>M. Lesueur and myself being forced by these new determinations
to occupy ourselves incessantly is arranging the subjects which
were to go in the Naturalist to France, we suspended all our
intended researches, and for three weeks employed ourselves day
and night in this delicate and difficult branch of our duty. It
may be imagined what we had to undergo, when it is known that we
arranged in the most methodical manner more than 40,000 animals
of all sorts and descriptions, collected in various parts during
a period of two years. Thirty-three large packing cases were
filled with these collections, which were more valuable and
numerous than any voyagers had ever sent to Europe, and which,
when only partially displayed in the house which I occupied with
M. Bellefin, excited the admiration of all the learned Englishmen
in the colony, particularly of the celebrated naturalist colonel
Paterson.</p>
<p>Of known countries there is not, perhaps, one where the
electric phenomena are so frequent and so terrible as in this
climate. While we were crossing the isles of Montenotte to Port
Jackson, we were surprised by the continuity of these phenomena,
in the midst of a season, and during a state of the atmosphere,
so little favourable to their existence; but towards the end of
our stay at Sydney, we witnessed such frequent and violent
storms, that our astonishment was inexpressible. Never had we
heard such dreadful thunder claps, nor seen such vivid,
lightning. In one of these storms, a thunder-bolt struck the
English ship the Perseus, which had no conductor, and had nearly
caused the loss of that ship.</p>
<p>On the 7th of October we witnessed a phenomenon of this kind,
to which I know nothing similar in the records of meteorology.
The whole morning the weather had been very fine, the sky and the
sea were equally calm; but in the afternoon the wind suddenly
veered to the north-west, and blew fresh and in squalls; an
enormous quantity of large black clouds, driven by those winds
from the summits of the Blue Mountains, were precipitated into
the plain. These clouds were so heavy, that they skimmed, as one
might say, the surface of the ground. The heat was suffocating:
Reaumur's thermometer suddenly rose from 18&deg; to 27&deg;. The
clouds soon opened with a horrible noise; the lightning was
blinding, and the thunder was seen to roll along the atmosphere
in serpentine shapes, of a blueish colour. At this period of the
tempest, the winds blew from all points of the compass, and their
violence increased in consequence of their thus clashing.
However, as a few very heavy showers of rain began to fall, we
hoped that the storm would soon cease; when, from the midst of a
very high cloud, blacker than the rest, there suddenly fell an
abundant hail, much more remarkable for the form of its grains
than from their size: some of them weighed nearly an ounce, and
each of them, instead of the more or less globular shape of the
hail of our climates, was of an elongated figure, irregularly
prismatic, and the proportions of which, in the largest specimen
which I could discover, was 29 lines long by 17 wide, and eight
thick.</p>
<p>However novel we might consider hail of such a shape, it did
not surprise the English, who, since their establishment on these
shores, had witnessed several such showers, but never with such
prodigious characters as in the month of December, 1795, the
particulars of which are described in the work of Collins, p.
445: this storm also came from the north-west. What other climate
of the globe presents such a series of remarkable phenomena?</p>
<p>As soon as we had finished the arrangement of our collections,
I returned with colonel Paterson to visit the establish went of
Castle Hill. After having ascended the river of Parramatta, to
the height of three leagues, we landed with a few soldiers, to
begin our researches in natural history. Amidst those various
trees which time or the axe had brought down, we found at every
step, under their fungous and putrid bark, beautiful
Coleopter&aelig;, and various species of lizards and reptiles, of
which we made a fine collection. On proceeding into the wood,
beyond the parts to which the English had extended fire and
steel, we found that the insects were much more scarce than in
the parts that had been cleared; and this singularity appeared to
us to be caused by the custom of the savages setting fire to the
forests, and thus destroying an enormous quantity of eggs, as
well as larvae and perfect insects.</p>
<p>Of all European vegetables, that which has succeeded best in
New South Wales is the peach tree; the cause is either the nature
of the soil, which is generally sandy and light, or that the
state of the climate is highly favorable to its vegetative
faculties. We may see whole fields covered with peach trees, and
their fruit is so abundant, that great quantities of it are
dried: several of the colonists prepare from it an agreeable kind
of wine; others distil from this wine a good-tasted spirit; and
it is not unusual to see the farmers fatten their hogs with
peaches.</p>
<p>On reaching Parramatta, Mr. Paterson and I went to the
government house, and the next day we made a second expedition in
search of objects of natural history, in which my philosophic
colleagues, Messrs. Paterson and Cayley, kindly enriched me with
contributions of such as I had not been able to meet with.</p>
<p>During these little excursions, I made an observation which
had struck me several times before, and which deserves particular
attention. In the deep vallies which we often crossed, there ran
some streams of fresh water, so feeble, and narrow in their beds,
that the widest of them we could step over with ease; and yet at
fifteen or twenty feet above their habitual course, we observed
on the soil and on the trees, evident proofs that the water had
frequently risen to that elevation. My companions confirmed this
remark, and gave me some interesting details, which with the
observations I had made at Port Jackson, enabled me to present
the singular history of the overflowing of the rivers in this
part of New Holland. All the facts which it may be necessary to
state are, that all the rivers in Cumberland county overflow
their banks at certain periods, like the Nile, and roll in
devastating torrents over the neighbouring fields. The English,
who first fixed their residences on these banks; being aware of
such inundations, sustained great injuries, and were reduced to
the necessity of either removing their habitations from those
dangerous banks, or establishing them in more elevated parts,
inaccessible to the water. But notwithstanding this double
precaution, the cultivators on the banks of Hawkesbury River
never feel themselves secure front such a disaster; as the water
often rises from twenty-five to forty and fifty feet above the
ordinary level of the river; while these inundations, which bear
no relation to the season, recur at often as ten or twelve times
in a year. This last fact is well worthy of philosophical
investigation, as it is in direct contradiction to the laws which
regulate the swelling and drying up of rivers in equatorial
climates; while the periods of inundation are so irregular, that
sometimes one has not occurred in six months, and at others,
there have been three or four in a month. The only cause which we
can assign is; the frequency and force of the rains which fall
from the mountains in which it takes its course; but even under
this idea, how astonishing it must appear, that even those heavy
torrents can raise the waters of a feeble current to the height
of thirty, forty, or fifty feet. What an immense extent of
country the rain must have fallen upon at one and the same time;
what a rapidity must the course of the water have acquired in its
passage down the mountains, to unite from so many points, and
almost instantaneously, in such prodigious masses! It must
therefore be owned, in respect to these and other phenomena, that
New Holland baffles all our analogies, and shakes those
scientific opinions, which are the most scrupulously admitted. In
short, whatever we may have to say of this singular country, so
justly called by the English the <i>unparalleled continent</i>,
we shall state Many other natural phenomena equally strange and
incomprehensible.</p>
<p>With respect to the river Hawkesbury, if by its inundations it
alarms the agriculturists in its vicinity, what benefits does it
not confer on the country which it overflows. Carrying with it
from the summits of the mountains and the interior of the
continent, all the vegetable mould which it meets with in its
course, it brings it to the vallies, and deposits it the
inundated fields, where it settles into rich strata, some of
which, according to the report of Mr. Marsden, are not less than
thirty; forty, and even sixty feet in depth, affording an
inexhaustible manure for the most active and varied cultivation.
Hence, nothing can be compared to the fertility of the banks of
this antarctic river: without any labour, and almost without
ploughing, the land in these parts produces the richest
harvests.</p>
<p>The singular sketch which I have just given, is not merely
applicable to the river Hawkesbury all the other rivers, and even
the rivulets of Cumberland county, are subject to similar swells,
and which appear to have their common origin in the abundant
rains that fall on large tracts of high lands.</p>
<p>Mrs. Paterson having expressed a wish to go with her husband
and me to Castle Hill, had come to join us in her carriage at
Parramatta; we therefore set off to Mr. Cox and his family, at
the farm which he occupies on the banks of the river, and which I
have already described: here we slept, and the next morning
early, we set off for the place we were to visit.</p>
<p>Of all the establishments in New South Wales, Castle Hill is
the most recent: at the time I was there, it was scarcely three
years old. The infant town then only consisted of a dozen houses;
but already were to be distinguished on the neighbouring hills
vast tracts of cultivated land, while several handsome farms were
settled in the vallies. Six hundred convicts were continually
employed in felling trees, to open roads through the forests and
in twenty quarters might be seen rising, immense volumes of flame
and smoke, produced by the burning of new concessions. Most of
the body of convicts just mentioned, were Irishmen, who have been
transported on account of their revolutionary principles; and it
was these very men who, a short time after our departure, the
English papers stated to have risen, and joined other bodies of
their countrymen in the colony. The insurgents, 1300 in number,
then marched against the town of Parramatta, and had a sanguinary
battle with all the English troops, by whom they were defeated,
and then they accepted the promises which the governor held out
to them.</p>
<p>The English government had long wished to prevent those
destructive conflagrations of the forests, and required that the
soil should be cleared by simply cutting down the timber: it was
expected that the projecting remains of the roots and suckers,
decomposed by heat and moisture, so far from impeding
agricultural labour, would become a valuable manure. This mode is
employed with advantage in many parts of America; but the result
has been ascertained to be quite different in New Holland, as if
experience of every kind is always to be overturned in this
singular part of the world; for example, the wood of the
Eucalyptus, which is so seldom met with in a sound state in the
growing tree, and which appears to be so easily decomposible.
This wood, probably on account of its resinous quality,
withstands, when cut down, every destructive operation of the
atmosphere; and every where may be seen the remains of trunks
which were out down fifteen years ago, perfectly as sound as when
they were growing, while their roots form insuperable obstacles
to the progress of the cultivation.</p>
<p>These unforeseen difficulties having compelled the English to
abandon this first method of clearing the land, they have adopted
that of fire, which they perform in the following manner. After
separating by a large abattis the portion of the forest that is
to be burned, they set fire to it in several parts, and in a few
days are devoured those products of nature which have required
her operations for centuries to bring to perfection. This last
method, besides the advantage of quickness and ease of execution,
also has that of extirpating all plants different from such as
are to be introduced; at the same time it imparts to the soil a
fertile heat, which disposes it to produce a rich harvest, while
the ashes of the vegetable that is burned on the surface; afford
an additional and salutary manure.</p>
<p>After taking refreshment at Castle Hill, our party set off to
visit a neighbouring habitation. "I wish", said Mr. Paterson, "to
introduce you to one of your countrymen, who is a friend of mine:
he is the baron De la Clampe, formerly a French colonel, who
honourably served his country in the war in India, and who
afterwards, being forced by your revolution to seek an asylum in
England, refused to bear arms against his nation. At length,
disgusted with a life of indolence, so little congenial with his
inclination and former habits, he solicited permission to
establish himself in this distant climate. His wish was not only
complied with, but several advantages were granted him, which
will secure to him for the rest of his life, an existence, if not
splendid, at least competent and peaceable. During three years
which he has resided at Castle Hill, he has only come once to
Sydney Town; he shuns the world, and refuses the most pressing
invitations of his best friends, in order to devote himself
entirely to agriculture. But you shall yourself judge", added Mr.
Paterson, "of his information and activity."</p>
<p>Having walked about a quarter of an hour through a thick wood,
we discovered the modest habitation and the fields of the poor
French colonel. At the head of six convicts, furnished to him by
the English government, almost naked like himself, he set them
the example of labour and fortitude. The unexpected arrival of
such a numerous party disconcerted M. De la Clampe, who appeared
mortified at our seeing him so miserably dressed, that it was
difficult to distinguish the master from the criminals that
laboured under his orders. He ran precipitately into the house to
make himself decent, and soon afterwards joined us.</p>
<p>The interior of this rural mansion, to which we were soon
introduced, presented the agreeable union of extreme simplicity
and a sort of elegance, which proved the delicate taste of its
owner, at the same time that he was an utter stranger to every
sort of luxury.</p>
<p>Colonel Paterson soon apprised the baron who I was, and the
nature of my visit to the colony. At the name of a Frenchman, the
unfortunate emigrant advanced towards me, and embracing the with
transport, "Ah! Monsieur," said he, "how goes on our dear
France?" With the highest satisfaction I related to this
interesting countryman all the prodigies which a great man had
performed for the happiness of our nation. He heard my recital
with ecstacy, and when I had finished, he animatedly offered up
his vows to heaven for the happiness and preservation of the
first consul.</p>
<p>After a frugal repast from the provisions which the colonel
had caused to be brought, we set out to visit the possessions of
our host, himself serving as a guide: he amused us with
particulars of his operations and their result; but of all that
he showed us, nothing interested me so much as a fine plantation
of cotton and coffee trees, which he had planted, and which bore
the most promising appearance. M. De la Clampe assured me, that
after a long series of experiments, he had succeeded in making
his cotton trees produce cotton of various colours, and
particularly that of the fine Indian nankeens, which no European
had hitherto been able to imitate, either by growing the cotton
or dyeing it. "Either I deceive myself," said the French
emigrant, "or in a little time I shall have created for this
colony two branches of commerce and exportation equally valuable:
I have only this means of acquitting myself of a sacred debt of
gratitude towards the people who received me in the time of my
misfortune, and I shall do every thing to hasten the period of
the performance of this duty and wish of my heart&mdash;a wish so
agreeable to my ideas of delicacy and patriotism."</p>
<p>While I was thus pursuing the enquiries peculiar to every
department, over a great portion of this singular colony, two oaf
my colleagues, Messrs. Depuch and Bailly, the mineralogists of
the expedition, visited Tongabee and Hawkesbury, the two last
towns of Cumberland county, and advanced as far as the base of
the Western Mountains.</p>
<p>They examined the bed of the river of Parramatta, ascertained
that the stratum of freestone, under Sydney Town, extends beyond
Parramatta, but at which latter place it covers at the depth of
several feet, strata of bituminous schistus, full of the
impressions of plants. This schistus is disposed in horizontal
layers, alternately with freestone and puddings impregnated with
a blackish and bituminous substance. The inference they drew from
these observations was, that a vast quantity of coal might be
found under the soil of Parramatta; a presumption which is
strengthened by the discovery that has already been made of this,
substance At Port Stevens, to the north, and Port Hacking, to the
south of Port Jackson.</p>
<p>There is a fine road that leads from Parramatta to Tongabee,
which the government causes to be kept in constant repair. To the
distance of three or four miles beyond Tongabee, the lands are
almost entirely cultivated, and are covered pith houses and
farms. In all this part of New South Wales, they raise quantities
of cattle, and to prevent them from damaging the cultivated
grounds they enclose them in meadows, like the people of North
America.</p>
<p>Our mineralogists did not discover in any of the lands
occupied by the English the slightest vestige of carbonated lime,
and the inhabitants are every where reduced to make use of the
small quantity only which they procure by the calcination of
shells, particularly those of oysters, which latter are found at
Botany Bay in vast abundance. The governors have in vain offered
large rewards to those inhabitants who may discover any bank of
limestone; and there is no reason to believe that such a
discovery will be made. They in many parts observed the hematite
oxide of iron, which they think might be made to produce an
excellent iron: there is also a great abundance of crystalised
native muriate of soda, in great masses; the governor has a
specimen which is a foot in diameter.</p>
<p>[About 10 pages of detail in the French version have been
adequately summarised in this volume, in the two preceding
paragraphs. This missing detailed material is of insufficient
general interest and has therefore not been translated.]</p>
<p>On the whole, it appears that it is only in respect to its
mountains, rivers, winds, and storms, that New South Wales
presents a series of grand phenomena: amongst the vegetables and
animals, nature has likewise multiplied her singularities, and
the history of the natives affords many peculiar subjects for
investigation, while the fine system of colonization pursued by
England in these distant lands, is equally, to be admired. But
the extent to which I have carried this chapter, precludes me
from entering into farther details, I most therefore defer the
reflections which remain to be made, and now terminate the
account of our residence Port Jackson.</p>
<p>I have already stated, that the Naturalist, having on board
the scientific collection and the valetudinarians of both ships,
was immediately to return to France with captain Hamelin. In
consequence of this resolution, Messrs. Leschenault, Faure, and
Bailly, those of my colleagues who remained on board that ship,
came over to the Geographer, which on the other hand lost the
interesting M. Depuch, who was too much reduced to continue the
continue the campaign, together with Messrs. Bougainville,
junior, Maurouard; and Brue, cadets of the first class: these
three gentlemen had the misfortune to incur the hatred of our
commander, who had condemned them to be sent home, as well as our
second surgeon, M. Taillifer, who had so nobly and courageously
attended us in all our illness.*</p>
<blockquote>[* It is an agreeable task to add, that our three
companions, as soon as they returned to Europe, were made
officers, and that they all three distinguished themselves in the
late battles. M. Taillefer was promoted by vice-admiral
Decr&eacute;s, the Minister of the marine, to be surgeon major of
the battalion of the marine imperial guard.]</blockquote>
<p>These final and much to be regretted arrangements having been
made, we set sail on the morning of the 18th of November, after
having been 152 days at New South Wales. The particulars of the
remainder of our voyage will form the substance of my second
volume: I shall therefore conclude the present with a few remarks
on the physical strength of the savages of the county Of
Cumberland, and those of Diemen's Land and Timor.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-26" id="ch-26"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>
<p align="center"><i><b>Results of various Experiments to
ascertain the Physical Strength of the Savages Of Diemen's Land
and New Holland, as well as of the the Inhabitants of Timor.
Conclusion.</b></i></p>
<br>
<p>THAT singular period it still recent, in which we saw many
celebrated men led away by an ardent imagination, or with
dispositions soured by the misfortunes inseparable from our
social state of existence, unite to ridicule that state, and
despising the benefits it confers, attribute to savages all the
sources of happiness and every principle of virtue. Their fatal
eloquence led astray the public opinion, and for the first time
sensible men were seen to tremble at the progress of
civilization, and to sigh for that miserable condition
illustrated in our days by the seductive title of a <i>state of
nature</i>! Happily modern travellers, by successively describing
various savage people, have enabled the world to form a just
opinion of those ridiculous sophisms: and our expedition may in
this respect still farther contribute to the progress of true
philosophy.</p>
<p>Of all the benefits which the apologists of man in a savage
state have brought forward in his behalf, his physical strength
is that on which they insist most particularly and constantly. As
the constant attendant of a vigorous state of health, physical
strength would be, in fact, one of the first claims to
superiority, and if it were to be the exclusive, or even most
particular appendage of the savage state, civilization, it must
be admitted, has deprived us of one of the most certain means of
happiness. Hence, the detractors of social order have made the
most eloquent declamations, to prove that this kind of
degradation applies to civilized men, and they have striven to
cause their sentiments to be believed. Till lately, however, we
had no means of contradicting them, by not knowing how to compare
with accuracy the physical strength of individuals and nations:
but at the time of our departure from Europe, this branch of the
history of mankind had excited the interest and zeal of
philosophers.</p>
<p>The recent invention of the <i>Dynamometer</i> by Regnier, had
just given a new turn to observations of this kind. Without being
perfect, or being capable of proving the precise degree of
absolute strength, this instrument affords the means of direct
approximations: it renders the effects comparable, and from the
numerous experiments which I have been able to make with it
during three years, I have ascertained that in this respect it is
much more accurate than was at first imagined. I had the
advantage of being the first who carried it beyond the seas, and
employing it amidst the hordes of the Southern Hemisphere. I
omitted no opportunity of trying it, and I can vouch for the
accuracy of the results which it has afforded.</p>
<p>My first experiments with this instrument were made on
Diemen's Land. Here, as well as on the neighbouring Isle Maria,
there exists a race of men entirely different from the people of
the continent of New Holland. In height they are similar to
Europeans, but they differ in their singular conformation. With
an uncommonly large head, particularly remarkable by the superior
proportion of its length over its breadth, with broad and
expanded shoulders, well formed loins, and sizeable buttocks,
almost all these individuals have at the same time lank and
feeble extremities; they show scarcely any muscle, while the
abdomen projects and seems inflated like a balloon. In other
respects, without any regular chiefs, without laws, or any form
of government, destitute of every kind of art, having no idea of
agriculture, of the use of metals, or animals; without clothing
or fixed habitations or any other retreat than a miserable
pent-house of bark, to protect him against the south winds,
without any other arms than the tomahawk and the sagaie; always
wandering in the midst of forests or on the sea shores; the
inhabitant of these regions unites all the characters of man in
an unsocial state, and is, in every sense of the word, <i>the
child of nature</i>. How different is he in his moral and
physical capacities, from what he is described in those seductive
accounts which have been given of him by the enthusiastic
imaginations of system-mongers, who have laboured to make him
appear superior to man in a civilized state!</p>
<p>With such a barbarous people, our experiments have been, if
not rare, at least difficult and dangerous, and most of our
interviews have terminated in aggressions on their part. Hence,
my dynamometrical observations on these shores have been few and
imperfect, as it was not possible for me to induce the people to
try the strength of their loins. My experiments were tried
chiefly upon savages in the most vigorous part of life, viz. from
eighteen to forty years; and the result has been, that the
average strength of the savages in Diemen's Land and the
neighbouring isles, is far inferior to that of Europeans, who
have been tried in the same parts of the world.</p>
<p>The results of five series of experiments on the people of
Diemen's Land, New Holland, Timor, the French, and English, is as
follows: the figures expressing our French kilogrammes.</p>

<p>From which it results, that</p>
<p>1. That the inhabitants of Diemen's Land, the most savage of
all, and <i>the real children of nature</i> of the modern
philosophers are the weakest of any.</p>
<p>2. That those of New Holland, who are little more civilized,
are weaker than those of Timor.</p>
<p>3. That the latter are in every respect, loins, hands, &amp;c.
weaker than the English.</p>
<p>Hence we may infer, that physical strength is not diminished
by civilization, nor is it a natural consequence of a savage
state.</p>
<p>It was my wish to pursue these experiments to a much greater
extent, particularly by making them on the Hottentot race at the
Cape of Good Hope; but the interests of science compelled me to
sacrifice my valuable instrument at the Isle of France. I gave it
to M. Chapotin, the government physician of that colony, who has
promised to try with it a number of people, of all nations, who
come to that island, and his remarks will doubtlessly throw an
important light on this new branch of science. For my own part,
it is sufficient gratification for me to reflect, that, I am the
first man who has laid open, by experiments in distant parts,
this wide field of observation, and opposed direct experiments
and numerous facts to that dangerous opinion so generally
promulgated and believed, <i>that the physical degeneration of
man is in proportion to his state of civilization!</i></p>
