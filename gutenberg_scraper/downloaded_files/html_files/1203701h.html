<h3>LETTER, with ENCLOSURE, from MAJOR WARBURTON, relative to
EXPLORATION in the neighborhood of LAKE TORRENS.</h3>
<br>
<p align="right">No. 199-58.               Police Commissioner's
Office, Adelaide, December 10, 1858.</p>
<p>Sir&mdash;Since I had the honor of transmitting my report of
the 3rd instant, I have read Mr. Babbage's official Despatch of
the 21st November, 1858. The annexed extract from that Despatch
requires some notice from me, because, either I, by the
suppression of truth, have assumed to myself a credit which is
not due to me, or else Mr. Babbage, by a direct statement of what
is not true, has endeavored to conceal his own incapacity by
robbing others of such credit as might fairly belong to them. I
have underlined* the particular portion of Mr. Babbage's Despatch
to which I solicit your attention&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><small>[* This portion is printed in
italics.]</small></p>
<blockquote><i>Extract</i>.&mdash;"I pointed out this place to
Major Warburton, explaining my reasons for my belief, and offered
to accompany him in an examination of it. As this proposal did
not appear to suit his plans, I requested him to let one of my
late party, Jones, accompany me, that I might examine the country
in this direction, and if I found it practicable, return to
Adelaide by Eyre's tracks, on the eastern side of the Lake; and
that, if not, I might, at any rate, have a companion in the long
ride to Port Augusta, <i>via</i> the Elizabeth, Pernatty, and
Beda. The Major, however, refused my request, and <i>I had no
alternative but to leave to others to reap the fruits of my own
labors.</i>"</blockquote>
<p>It would appear from Mr. Babbage's account that the
"<i>labor</i>" of discovering a passage across Lake Torrens was
his, whilst I have reaped the fruits of labor not my own. I am
compelled to give an emphatic contradiction to Mr. Babbage's
statement, and I leave you to judge on whose side the
preponderating evidence shows the truth to rest.</p>
<p>In the first place, I make my plea, by declaring solemnly and
sincerely, on my honor as a gentleman, that in finding the
crossing of Lake Torrens, I received <i>assistance</i> from no
one excepting my immediate companions, Mr. A. J. Baker and
Corporal Coward.</p>
<p>The views I had <i>previously formed</i> received
<i>confirmation</i> by what Mr. Forster told me on the 2nd
October; he stated, that, when at Stuart's Creek, the native had
wished Mr. Stuart and himself not to go further, but to return
direct to the northern settlements.</p>
<p>Before leaving Adelaide, I had determined to <i>try</i> to
find a passage, but whilst on board the Marion, it struck me that
Corporal Burtt of the Mounted Police, stationed at Angepena,
might, if I succeeded, be useful in conveying the intelligence to
Adelaide, and for this purpose I suggested his being sent to the
westward side of Mount Nor-west. You will observe that I did not
want the Corporal's aid to <i>find</i> a passage. I neither
suggested nor wished that he should go a foot beyond Mount
Nor-west, but, as I then thought it probable that my own duties
might not allow me to complete the line of communication, I
wished the Corporal to be present, so that by our actual meeting
on the supposed eastern side of the lake, the Government might
feel indisputably certain that the passage had been found. I am
not a likely person to select a work for myself, and then allow
either my juniors or my subordinates to take it out of my hands.
I may readily be believed when I say this, for my conduct to Mr.
Babbage (which he states deprived him of the fruits of his
labors) proves it, and I may candidly confess, even though I
incur public odium by the admission, that I would not have
permitted Mr. Babbage to go across.</p>
<p>If anyone is entitled to share with me in the credit due for
finding a passage across Lake Torrens, it is Corporal Burtt; I
believe we were both on the crossing at the same time; and though
my instructions were not followed as they ought to have been, yet
I gladly give up to Corporal Burtt any share of credit he, or
others for him, may claim.</p>
<p>I will now state a few facts as regards Mr. Babbage. Mr.
Babbage did not open the subject of there being a passage to me;
I opened it to him on the 5th November. When I opened it, he at
first dissented from my views, stating that he did not think
there was any passage <i>there</i>.</p>
<p>I then showed him a different map, and repeated to him what
Mr. Forster had told me; <i>after this</i> Mr. Babbage changed
his opinion, admitting that there might be a passage, and adding
that he had ascended his "Hermit's Hill", from which he thought
he could see at least fifteen miles (he appealed to his
brother-in-law to confirm this extensive range of vision), and no
lake was visible. From this hour, it would seem that Mr. Babbage
cherished the extravagant idea not only of superseding me in
carrying out <i>my own plans</i>, but of expecting me to furnish
him with the means of doing so!!</p>
<p>Next day, whilst on the march, Mr. Babbage hinted to me his
dislike of travelling in my company, or with the party of which
he had lately been the head&mdash;he thought it looked as though
he were being led captive. I readily understood his sentiments,
and <i>offered</i> to let him have his brother-in-law to go down
with him. Shortly after this, my well-meant offer was adroitly
turned against myself, by Mr. Babbage saying, that as I had
offered him a companion he should proceed eastward, and endeavor
to find a passage across Lake Torrens; upon this plan I at once
placed my decided veto. I informed Mr. Babbage that he should
have any one he liked to accompany him to Adelaide by any direct
and known route, but that I could not assist him in prolonging
his exploration in any direction, and most certainly not in the
one I had marked out for myself. Mr. Babbage replied that it was
of no consequence, that he would go by himself. I avoided
prolonging the discussion, thinking it best to let Mr. Babbage
sleep a night on the intention of going alone. Next morning I
expressed my hope that Mr. Babbage had changed his mind about
going alone, and pointed out what I conceived to be the danger of
such a proceeding. Mr. Babbage gave up his plan.</p>
<p>It is true that Mr. Babbage did offer to accompany me, and
that I staved off the invitation he gave himself as civilly as I
could.</p>
<p>I think it was on the last morning we were together, that Mr.
Babbage came to the camp-fire where Mr. Baker, myself, and I
believe some others were sitting, and said, as nearly as I can
remember the exact words, "Major Warburton, do not let us
misunderstand each other, you will understand distinctly that I
have expressed my desire to go and find a passage across Lake
Torrens, and my reason for wishing to do so is, that the public
will say it is an additional proof of my <i>incapacity</i> that I
was on the best spot for finding the passage, and yet took no
steps to find it." I replied, that "It was very probable the
public would say what Mr. Babbage supposed, but that it was no
fault of mine that the time for his exploring was past; that the
idea of finding a passage never entered his head till I put it
there, and that he could not expect me both to give him the idea
and the means of carrying it into execution to my own prejudice."
This, I believe, ended our conversation on the subject.</p>
<p>Mr. Babbage did point out his Hermit Hill to
<i>me</i>&mdash;that is, he produced a number of scraps of
tracing paper, and, after some search, selected the bit he
wanted, on which, I believe, the Hermit Hill was laid down. I
took no note of its bearings, and, in truth, neither observed nor
cared anything about its position, and for this simple reason,
that, the <i>day before</i> I met Mr. Babbage, I had selected the
hill from which I intended to commence my search, and all the
Hermit Hills in the Colony would not have turned me from my
purpose.</p>
<p>Whether the hill from which I started was really Mr. Babbage's
Hermit Hill or not I cannot say positively, for it would appear
that the whole range is named the Hermit Range, because it stands
alone. If its component hills are all little Hermits, also
enjoying themselves in social contiguity with their neighbors,
then, no doubt, I, as well as Mr. Babbage, ascended a Hermit,
Hill; but I can positively assert that there were no tracks about
the hill, and, if Mr. Babbage ever went to that hill, or to any
other near it, he must be a wonderfully short-sighted explorer
not to have seen the extraordinary accumulation of springs which
almost surrounds the hill in question And I must further observe,
supposing our hills to be one and the same, still that I received
no assistance from Mr. Babbage; because, I had selected mine for
an express purpose, before I saw Mr. Babbage&mdash;whilst Mr.
Babbage himself either visited the hill without any definite
object, or failed to draw any definite conclusion from his visit
until I had broached the subject to him. He left the hill, went
in another direction, and, when I met him, was, as he himself
tells us, bound for the Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Mr. Babbage, in his letter of the 17th October, 1857, gives us
his views of where the crossing (and the <i>only</i> crossing) of
the lake was&mdash;Mr. Gregory found this crossing. Where and
when did Mr. Babbage enunciate any other opinion upon this
subject until I had put one into his mind?</p>
<p>Did Mr. Babbage ever express his intention of looking for a
passage across the lake?&mdash;No. When on a favorable spot for
finding the passage, did he make any attempt at it?&mdash;No. Why
not? Was it not a valuable piece of exploration, and one strictly
within his instructions? Mr. Babbage's own words afford the
strongest presumptive evidence against him. His map showed Eyre's
track to be thirty miles east of his Hermit Hill, and as he and
his brother-in-law agreed that they could only see fifteen miles
from the top of the hill, there remained unseen an equal
distance, and ample room for a Lake Torrens&mdash;why, then,
should he at that time, <i>when he had never been to
Tarawurta</i>, suppose that there was no lake? He says he
<i>expected</i> to see it; and, when I first spoke of crossing,
he still thought the Lake was there&mdash;it was only when I
showed him a corrected map, on the 5th November, that he
<i>then</i> found, for the first time, how near he had been and
then came the fear of its being taken "<i>as an additional proof
of his incapacity</i>" (his own words)&mdash;a fear from which he
seems to have been previously free, as he was again going past
the place without trying for a passage. Mr. Babbage's "own
belief" about the Lake is given on the 21st November&mdash;<i>I
was on the crossing-place</i> on the 9th November.</p>
<p>What are the labors, the fruits of which I have taken from Mr.
Babbage? He climbed his Hermit Hill&mdash;what then?&mdash;He
thought he saw fifteen miles, and came down again. The Hermit
Hills, truly have been in labor&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><small>"<i>Parturiunt montes, nascetur
ridiculus mus</i>."</small></p>
<p>I enclose copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Baker, and I
transmit his answer, which I did not open till my own letter was
signed.</p>
<p>I trust Honorable Sir, that, as Mr. Babbage has charged me, in
an official paper submitted to Parliament, with having acted in a
manner repugnant to the feelings of a gentleman, you will do me
the justice to give the same publicity to this, my emphatic
denial of the truth of Mr. Babbage's statement.</p>

<p><small>Sir&mdash;I beg to transmit, for your perusal, an
extract from an Official Report of Mr. Babbage's, presented to
Parliament, and as I think you were present on two occasions when
the subject referred to in this extract was under discussion
between Mr. Babbage and myself, I should feel obliged if you
would favor me with a statement, as nearly as your memory will
permit, of what you on these occasions heard.</small></p>

<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<p align="right"><small>Kent-terrace, Norwood, 9th December,
1858.</small></p>
<p><small>Sir&mdash;In reply to yours of this date, enclosing an
extract from Mr. Babbage's Official Report to Parliament, which I
have read&mdash;I beg to state that the conversation which I
heard between Mr. Babbage and yourself was quite the reverse of
the extract now before me, and hereunto annexed. The following
is, as near as I can remember, an exact statement,
viz.:&mdash;You had been giving Mr. Babbage a description of the
springs and country you had discovered, and then went on to
describe your plans, and stated that you intended to try and find
a practicable route from Stuart's Creek into Parry's Country, so
that stock might be brought through from the northern runs, and
avoid that horrible desert via Beda and the Pernatty Plains. At
this time Mr. Babbage would not entertain the idea of a
practicable crossing over Lake Torrens; nor did he appear to have
any faith in your plan, until you told him that the blackfellow
who accompanied Stuart and Forster had tried to persuade them to
return that way.</small></p>
<p><small>The next day, on our march back to Stuart's Creek, Mr.
Babbage said to me that he intended to ask you to allow him to
have one man and sufficient provisions to enable him to reach the
nearest stocked run east of Lake Torrens.</small></p>
<p><small>On the Monday morning, before leaving Stuart's Creek,
Mr. Babbage came down while we were at breakfast, and before the
whole of the men belonging to both parties, asked you to allow
him to have one man and sufficient provisions, that he may try
and cross Lake Torrens and return to Adelaide by that
route.</small></p>
<p><small>Your reply was&mdash;"My instructions were to recall
you, Mr. Babbage, not to prolong your exploration duties, as I
should be doing were I to allow you to seek for a crossing over
Lake Torrens; nor do I think I could, in justice to myself and
party, send you to reap the credit of my plans, should there
prove to be a practicable crossing; nor do I think you ought to
expect me to do so, knowing, as you do, that you had no idea of
looking for a crossing until after I had laid my plans before
you. By any known route you can return; and I shall be happy to
allow you to take any one of your late party with you you
choose." Mr. Babbage then offered to accompany you, which offer
you refused, stating&mdash;"That I cannot at present say what
course I shall take; in fact, I shall most likely go back by the
Elizabeth, after satisfying myself as to the practicability of
crossing Lake Torrens. I have desired Mr. Chas. Gregory to plant
stores for me at the Elizabeth; I therefore think, for the sake
of your own property left at the Elizabeth, you had better return
there&mdash;however, you are welcome to go by any known route you
please, and I shall be most happy to render you every assistance
in my power to make your journey agreeable."</small></p>
<p><small>Mr. Babbage then made this reply aloud, and before the
whole of the men&mdash;"But, Major Warburton, only consider what
the people of Adelaide will say, when they hear that I have been
within a few miles of this crossing for the last three weeks, yet
never went to explore it&mdash;they will bring this against me as
another proof of my incapacity."</small></p>
<p align="center"><small>I have, &amp;c.,</small></p>
