<h3>WHAT THIS STORY IS ABOUT</h3>

<p class="first">As a writer of thrillers Arthur Gask is
preeminent. Foremost critics of the great national and
provincial press have unanimously praised his many books: H.G.
Wells confessed to reading him in the small hours. His Gilbert
Larose is outstanding amongst memorable characters in mystery
fiction as such novels as <i>The Tragedy of the Silver Moon</i> and
<i>The House on the Fens</i> clearly demonstrate.</p>

<p><i>The Beachy Head Murder</i> is true to form. It tells the
absorbing story of a crime perpetrated and atoned for, and of
the later sequel in which the all but perfect murder was
committed. Larose, however, was not deceived. Gifted with a
profound insight into human nature and possessed of astonishing
powers of observation, he identified the murderer and, in the
dramatic climax, dispensed his own brand of justice.</p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. &mdash; THE NARRATIVE OF JASON
BROWN.</h2>

<p class="first">
IF everything about me were known, I am quite aware the
greater number of people would insist that I must be by nature
an evil man.</p>

<p>The thought of which amuses me, as in these latter years I
appear to so conform to all the generally accepted ideas of
solid British respectability.</p>

<p>At only thirty-five I am a well-to-do landowner, the squire
of our village and the youngest Justice of the Peace in my
country. I open Flower Shows, I give away prizes at the local
sports and I am on the Boards of Management of several public
institutions. Also, coming of good stock&mdash;my father was the
grandson of an earl&mdash;I am held to be a worthy example of
that class which in Britain's glorious history has done so much
to win for her her world-wide greatness.</p>

<p>But I was not always so esteemed. I was a hunted man once.
There was a reward of five hundred pounds for my capture and,
for ought I know, the offer is still open. I was a thief, and
worse than that, I killed the man who had been sent to catch
me.</p>

<p>I don't deny I did very wrong, but I do plead in extenuation
that I did my utmost to atone for my offences. Also, there was
no premeditation about my crimes.</p>

<p>It was through one single foolish action, not in itself
criminal, that I was drawn into the vortex of all that trouble.
I always find consolation, too, in the thought that when I took
that man's life I was sure I was only acting in self-defence. He
gave me no chance, and I believe he was intending to murder me
to obtain that bank-wallet. I did not dream he was a
detective.</p>

<p>Of course, I know there are many who will always condemn
irrevocably directly one false step is taken, but I hold such
people are nearly always hypocrites. After all, wrong-doing is
so often only a matter of courage, and in all probability the
majority of those who would now be most bitter against me
because of that theft, in similar circumstances would be just as
bad as I was&mdash;if they only dared.</p>

<p>Yes, Nature has shaped us all very much in the same
mould.</p>

<p>I mean who among us would care to write down for everyone to
read all that his thoughts have been, all that he has longed for
and all that he would have done if he had dared?</p>

<p>So many things which are forbidden are natural to us, and I
always hold that every man, at heart, is more or less a
criminal. In the lives of all of us, at one time or another,
there must be many so-called crimes we would have liked to carry
out, and we have only been prevented from doing so by the
restraining influences of education, convention and the laws
under which we live for our mutual protection.</p>

<p>And the more courage we have the greater must have been our
temptations. The more mastery we have obtained over the affairs
of life and the more successes we have had, the more we are
inclined to exert that mastery and continue those successes
wherever our inclinations may lead us. Remember, the timid man
never digs deep into crime. He may rise to the paltry heights of
a petty pilferer and sneak-thief, or a cheater of people where
he is sure he will never be found out, but he never gives the
authorities much trouble in bigger ways.</p>

<p>We cannot get away from it, that all his life long, from his
earliest days, it has been the natural inclination of Man to
take what is appealing to him. The wish, however, of itself,
does not make him an evil person.</p>

<p>For example, I am devoted to Margaret and do not believe that
any wife could be more beloved by her husband than is she.
Still, I often see other women whom I would like to make a fuss
about and whose lover I should not mind being.</p>

<p>Only the other day a young girl came to me in great distress.
She was of my own class and very pretty. For the services I
rendered her, it would have been hard for her to be unresponsive
to me, if only out of gratitude, had I made any advances. She
was about to be married to a man for whom I fancied she did not
much care. It was, however, from a money point of view, going to
be a splendid match for her, but her terror now was that an old
flame was threatening to spoil everything with some letters of
hers he was holding.</p>

<p>Feeling very sorry for her, I paid the man an unexpected
visit, gave him a well-deserved thrashing, and practically took
the letters from him by force. Then, for my reward I contented
myself with the relief I saw in the girl's eyes. I admit frankly
it was hard for me, as she seized my hand and kissed it
fervently in her gratitude.</p>

<p>Then again, another thing I would like to do. There's a man I
could cheerfully murder, if I only let myself go. I hate him,
not only for his general mode of life, but also in particular
for his treatment of his young wife. There is always murder in
my heart whenever I meet him, but I have to repress all signs of
my feelings and even be more than civil to him, because I am
continually meeting him in the course of my public activities
and, besides, because he is very wealthy and helps our charities
a lot.</p>

<p>Yes, I am for ever repressing my longings in one way or
another, and I have not the slightest doubt that all people go
through repressions in the same way. So no one must be judged by
what he or she would like to do.</p>

<p>To come, however, to the story I am going to tell.</p>

<p>Ten years ago I was working in a stock-broker's office in the
city. My salary was four guineas a week and of this I paid
thirty-five shillings to a boarding-house in West Kensington. My
fares and lunches cost me another fifteen shillings. So, when I
had paid for cigarettes, newspapers and clothes, there was not
much left for amusements. Still, I managed to get in an
occasional Saturday afternoon at the races, and from time to
time to take a girl out to a cheap dinner in Soho and a cinema
afterwards. I thought I was seeing life when I ordered a
two-shilling bottle of claret with the meal, and later, kissed the
girl in the park.</p>

<p>One summer I had saved up nearly ten pounds for my holiday
and resolved to go for a walking tour along the South Coast. So,
on the Sunday after the August Bank Holiday, I took the evening
train to Brighton, intending the next day to tramp the twenty or
more miles to Eastbourne.</p>

<p>I was travelling very light, my luggage consisting of only a
brush and comb, a tooth-brush and a mackintosh. I had also
brought a book, <i>Winwood Reade's Martyrdom of Man,</i> to read
in the evenings.</p>

<p>The next morning, setting out early from Brighton, I happened
to pass a small bicycle-repairing shop and saw by the door a
bicycle ticketed 'only four pound.' The idea came into my mind
instantaneously what a good investment it would be. I could use
it for the greater part of my holiday and then sell it again. At
most, I thought, I should lose thirty shillings by the
transaction, as it could be easily resold anywhere for two
pounds ten.</p>

<p>So, having made sure the machine and tyres were in good
condition, ten minutes later I was blithely pedalling along the
Newhaven Road. The day was fine and hot, but there was the
feeling of thunder in the air. I had bought a pair of cheap dark
glasses to keep out the glare of the sun. At Seaford I bought
some sandwiches and, a few miles farther on, turned off the main
Eastbourne Road, to reach the sea at Birling Gap and have a
bathe.</p>

<p>I had had my swim, redressed and had just finished my
sandwiches, when I heard a car pull up upon the low cliffs above
and a couple of minutes or so later two men came down on to the
beach, with towels thrown over their shoulders. The older of
them was stout and red-faced, he was carrying a big leather
wallet about a foot square. I noticed, subconsciously, that he
had pushed the wallet carefully out of sight under his clothes
directly after he had started undressing.</p>

<p>Then he angered me intensely by throwing a stone at some
seagulls near him and laughing with great glee when they flew
off, with one of them dangling a broken leg.</p>

<p>"Damned good shot that," he exclaimed boisterously, "but then
I'm always pretty good at it. I got one last week, at home in
just the same way. I detest the squealing crows."</p>

<p>I was furious with him for his cruelty, and always inclined
to be hasty-tempered, for very little would have told him what I
thought of him. He looked such an arrogant and over-bearing
brute.</p>

<p>Wheeling my bicycle back up the Gap, I started off leisurely
upon the winding road which runs by the cliffs towards Beachy
Head. Not having ridden a bicycle for some time, my legs were
already beginning to feel stiff and tired and I had to go
slowly.</p>

<p>I had gone a little over a mile and was just under the old
Belle Toute lighthouse when I heard a car coming up behind me. I
did not look round, but the hooter was sounded in such fierce
spasmodic jerks that, although the road was both wide and clear
in front of me, I instinctively veered to its extreme side. Even
then, the car, travelling at a great pace, roared by so
unpleasantly close to me that I could distinctly feel the wind
it made as it passed.</p>

<p>It was an open sports car and I swore angrily as I saw one of
its two occupants turn his head round and grin. He evidently
thought it good fun that I had been almost run off the road, and
I was not at all surprised when I recognised him as the red-faced
man who had been stoning those seagulls at the Gap.</p>

<p>Then, just when the grinning fool had got his back to me
again and the car could only have been about a hundred and fifty
yards farther on, I saw some object fly out over the back and
bump on to the road. Arriving to where it lay, I recognised it
at once as the big wallet the red-faced man had tucked under his
clothes while he had been undressing.</p>

<p>Picking it up, I drew in a deep breath as I read upon the
small brass plate attached to it, "Southern and Sussex Bank,
Brighton Branch."</p>

<p>"Whew, money!" I whistled. "Perhaps thousands of pounds in
notes!"</p>

<p>The car had by this time roared away out of sight. I was in a
deep dip in the Downs and there was not a soul to be seen
anywhere. About half a mile inland there was a flock of sheep,
and the sheep and some wheeling seagulls were the only signs of
life about.</p>

<p>Now I can never quite understand exactly what impulse urged
me to make such a quick decision, but, instantly, I looked round
for somewhere to hide the wallet. I really think my only idea
then was to spite the red-faced man. He had been wantonly cruel
to that seagull, and it had undoubtly been of sheer malicious
purpose that the car had been driven so close to me. He had
approved of it by his grin.</p>

<p>On both sides of the road, all the way along, there were a
large number of big lumps of chalk, of varying sizes, scattered
about upon the turf, and laying down my bicycle, I ran over to a
big flat one about twenty yards away and pushed the wallet
underneath.</p>

<p>Then I remounted my bicycle and started to ride up the road
towards Beachy Head, chuckling at what I had done. The red-faced
man would be in a great state when he discovered his loss and it
would serve him right. He deserved to be punished and I did not
mind if he never found the wallet at all. If he did find it, it
would only be after a lot of trouble and he would never learn
how it came to be placed under the lump of chalk.</p>

<p>Proceeding slowly along, I happened to glance round again at
the flock of sheep, and to my annoyance, and in some way to my
consternation, saw there was now a man moving among them. He
must, I thought, have been bending down when I had first looked
that way and it gave me a certain pang of uneasiness that
perhaps he had seen my hurried run across the turf to hide the
wallet. But I dismissed the idea as improbable. If, however, he
had seen me, in all probability he would not have been
interested and perhaps only thought I had been running after
some paper which had fluttered away in the wind.</p>

<p>I pedalled on and then, when about half a mile farther upon
my way heard a roar in the distance and saw the sports car
tearing back towards me. Evidently the loss of the wallet had
been discovered and they were returning poste-haste to find
it.</p>

<p>The car was jerked to a standstill when it reached me. "Hi,
you there!" shouted the red-faced man brusquely, as I dismounted
from my machine with some reluctance. "Have you seen a bag on
the road?" and his frowning eyes seemed to search me up and
down, as if to make sure I had not got it tucked up under my
jacket.</p>

<p>"No, I have not," I replied surlily, not liking the curt
maimer in which he was addressing me, and without a word he
threw in his clutch and roared the car back towards Birling
Gap.</p>

<p>I grinned in delight at his discomfiture and rode on, but
then, suddenly, a horrid fear gripped me. Suppose that man with
the sheep <i>had</i> noticed everything, had saw me pushing
something under the lump of chalk, after I had gone had run over
to find out what it had been! Suppose, too, that the men in the
car were, even now, stopping to speak to him, which they would
certainly be doing if they encountered him anywhere near the
road! Of course he would tell them he had seen a man on a
bicycle hiding the wallet and then&mdash;good God, it would be a
matter for the police!</p>

<p>My blood ran cold. What a fool I had been! By that silly
action, taken thoughtlessly and upon the spur of the moment, I
had put myself in a dreadful position, for it could only look as
if I had hidden the wallet with the intention of coming back
later to steal its contents.</p>

<p>And how could I hope to escape being caught? Things might
happen very quickly and any moment the car might be coming back!
A solitary cyclist, a young man all by himself, would be a
conspicuous object, and even if I got among the crowd, nearly
always to be found at the top of Beachy Head, I might easily be
recognised and picked out.</p>

<p>I was always quick in my decisions, often too quick, and in
less than a minute had turned off the road and thrown myself and
the bicycle down behind a clump of blackberry bushes about
twenty paces away.</p>

<p>Almost to the second as I flattened myself upon the turf, I
heard a car in the distance, and not half a minute later the
two-seater sports re-appeared. I had been only just in time.</p>

<p>It tore past me at an even more furious pace than ever, and I
imagined the red-faced man was looking viciously angry.</p>

<p>What had happened, I asked myself with my heart pumping hard?
Had they met the man with the sheep and, from what he told them
he had seen, had they recovered the wallet? Or, had they gone
the whole way back to Birling Gap and, encountering no one upon
the road and yet not finding the wallet, had suddenly come to
realise that I must have had something to do with its
disappearance?</p>

<p>Either of these two things might have occurred, but they had
been so quick in returning that I was inclined to think they
must have met the man with the sheep. At any rate, their furious
haste now could only mean that they were after me. They wanted
the man on the bicycle and I expected they felt confident they
would catch him.</p>

<p>For the moment I felt absolutely sick with consternation and
then a thought leapt into my mind. Unless they saw me with the
bicycle, surely they would not be able to recognise me again? If
I got rid of my bicycle they could only have a very incomplete
idea of what I looked like. When they had stood talking to me
for those few seconds I had had the big sunglasses on and the
peak of my cap pulled well down over my eyes because of the
glare of the sun.</p>

<p>Then there was nothing either of the cycling tourist about my
appearance. I was wearing perfectly ordinary clothes, with long
trousers, the ends of which were tucked into the tops of my
socks. So, in a few seconds I could become a pedestrian again,
and with my trousers put straight, my sun-glasses back in my
pocket, and my cap turned round, the cyclist would have
completely disappeared.</p>

<p>I was so certain that by hiding that wretched wallet I had
put myself in a most compromising position that I adopted no
half measures. I determined the bicycle should vanish
altogether, or at any rate not be found until it was too late to
do me any harm.</p>

<p>The cliff three hundred and more feet high was only a few
yards behind me and in a few seconds my newly-acquired machine
was toppling over on to the rocks below. The tide was almost at
its full and I knew there would be no one underneath. The
five-mile stretch of beach between Beachy Head and Birling Gap is a
dangerous place to be caught at all high tides, as in many
places the sea washes right up to the foot of the cliffs.</p>

<p>At that very moment drops of rain began to fall, and it
seemed to make sure my salvation. I put on my mackintosh and,
with it well buttoned up to my chin, walked confidently along
the edge of the cliff to the Head. It was still raining when I
reached there, but only a fine drizzle and not enough to keep a
goodly number of holiday makers from standing round to gaze down
at the waves breaking upon the rocks so many hundreds of feet
below.</p>

<p>I mingled with them, but the rain beginning to fall more
heavily now, most of us soon began to move off towards the hotel
about a hundred yards away. I saw no signs of the red-faced man
or his companion. I had a drink in the crowded bar, remaining
there for about half an hour.</p>

<p>The rain was continuing, but now only in an unpleasant
drizzle, as I went outside again. I thought it best to be in no
hurry to leave the Head in case a watch should have been set all
round. Then, seeing a large empty char-a-banc parked by the side
of the hotel, I approached the driver and conductor who were
having a smoke inside, and enquired if they would have room to
give me a lift when, later, they left to return to the town.</p>

<p>They told me there was plenty of room but that they would not
be leaving for another hour. I said that would suit me nicely,
and getting inside out of the rain, sat smoking and talking with
them.</p>

<p>Then I began to think I had been much too hasty in getting
rid of my bicycle in the way I had done. It looked very much to
me now as if the two men had got back their wallet and, while
they would have liked to have cursed me, they could not have
done more. After all, they had no proof that I had touched the
wallet and it would have been the shepherd's word against mine.
Apart from that, too, as bank officers, they would certainly not
have wanted it to come out how careless they had been. So, I
began swearing at myself for having smashed up a perfectly good
bicycle and wasted four pounds, a loss that I could ill afford.
At any rate, I ought to have had the sense to have left it
behind the blackberry bushes and gone back to fetch it later on
when the coast would have been quite clear.</p>

<p>For a few minutes I felt furious at my stupidity, but then,
suddenly, and all in a matter of seconds, I came to realise I
had done the right thing.</p>

<p>I heard a car in the distance and, looking round, saw two
coming from the direction of Eastbourne. Even before the first
was close enough for me to be certain, my heart bumped, for an
instinct told me it was that of the red-faced man. Both cars
pulled up within a few yards of us and everyone jumped out.
There were three men in the second car.</p>

<p>"'Tecs," whispered the driver of the char-a-banc excitedly to
his mate. "That tall one's Joe Whitburn, a smart chap. I know
him. What's up?"</p>

<p>After a glance in our direction, the man he indicated,
followed by the others, came up. "Hullo, Henderson," he
exclaimed addressing the driver. "Now do you happen to have
noticed a young fellow going by on a push-bike towards the town?
He's by himself, is wearing big sun-glasses and has got his cap
pulled down low upon his forehead."</p>

<p>The driver considered. "Not that I took any notice of, Joe."
He jerked his head in the direction of the cliffs. "But there
are several cyclists over there."</p>

<p>The red-faced man was looking very worried. To my delight he
hadn't given me a second glance. Evidently I was safe, I told
myself, with a sigh of great relief. As I thought, they would
not be able to recognise me unless I were with my bicycle.</p>

<p>The detective nodded his thanks and they all moved off
towards the cliffs. I saw them again presently, and they all
looked very glum. They had a short conversation by their cars
and then drove off again in the direction of the town. An hour
or so later, when we left, we passed a policeman at the cross-roads.
He had obviously been stationed there to keep a look-out.</p>

<p>It was not until a couple of weeks later that I learnt all
that had happened that eventful afternoon. Following upon the
dreadful tragedy which took place so soon afterwards, reporters
came down in droves and very quickly their newspapers put
together a full story.</p>

<p>It appeared the red-faced man was the manager of the Brighton
Bank and his destination that afternoon had been their
Eastbourne Branch. His companion had been one of the bank clerks
and they had turned off the main road, as I had done, to have a
dip in the sea at Birling Gap.</p>

<p>They had missed the wallet just before reaching Beachy Head,
and realising at once that it must have bumped out of the car,
had turned back without a second's delay to recover it. After
having spoken to me, they had been quite certain they would pick
it up before they reached the Gap. Then, having arrived there
and not seeing it anywhere on the road, and, moreover, meeting
no one upon their return journey, they had suddenly come to the
conclusion that I must have picked it up, for they now
remembered seeing the wallet in the car just before they had
come upon me the first time.</p>

<p>So they had raced back to the Head, and seeing no signs of
me, had stopped at the hotel to put through a telephone call to
the Eastbourne police, informing them what had happened and
asking that a cordon be instantly drawn round the whole
district, so that I should not escape. They said the wallet
contained upwards of seven thousand pounds in treasury
notes.</p>

<p>The call put through, they had continued on the road towards
Eastbourne, with very little hope, however, seeing they had lost
so little time, that they would find I had got in front of them
there. Their surmise proving correct, they had driven on to the
police-station in Eastbourne and returned to Beachy Head
accompanied by the three detectives.</p>

<p>And that's where the story ended for that day, the police
being, however, quite certain no man on a bicycle had got away
with the wallet. Their cordon had been flung so quickly and so
wide they were positive of that. Their opinion was I had hidden
the bicycle and got away on foot. Moreover, they had no hope of
catching me, as neither the bank manager nor his clerk could
give any useful description of me. All the two last could say
was that I was of medium height and build, was very sunburnt,
had my cap pulled well down over my forehead, and was wearing
big sun-glasses. They could not remember anything particular
about my clothes.</p>

<p>As I say, at the time I knew nothing about any of these
things, but I was feeling perfectly confident that I was safe
from any recognition. I had got out of what might have been a
very ugly situation with only the loss of my bicycle.</p>

<p>Arriving in Eastbourne, I put up at Benger's Hall, an
old-fashioned coffee tavern in the poorer part of the town. It
looked clean, and was certainly cheap. Anyhow, it was the best I
could afford now, with my finances so depleted by the loss of
the bicycle. There was no trouble about my having no luggage, as
at the Coffee Hall you paid for your night's lodging in advance
and your meals as you had them.</p>

<p>Originally I had meant my walking tour should extend right
round the coast as far as Whitstable, and was not intending to
stop longer than one night in any town. The next morning,
however, I altered my plans. I found my bed at the coffee tavern
very comfortable and the food good, indeed, I doubted if I
should find as good a place anywhere along the route I had
selected to follow.</p>

<p>So I resolved to remain on in Eastbourne for a few days,
helped, too, to form this decision by something which had
nothing to do with the coffee tavern. I had learnt that the
local paper, the <i>Eastbourne Chronicle,</i> came out on the
Wednesday morning and I wanted to see if there was any reference
in it to the loss of the wallet. I wanted to know if the wallet
had been found.</p>

<p>Besides, like the murderer whom, tradition says, always
returns to the scene of his crime, I could not tear myself away
so easily from Beachy Head. If there were no mention of the
wallet in the morning in the <i>Chronicle,</i> I must go and see
if it were still where I had hidden it. I could safely walk
along the cliffs as far as Belle Toute and cock my eye round in
passing. I remembered distinctly the flattish lump of chalk and
would be able to pick it out at once.</p>

<p>So I lounged about all that morning, watching the people and
listening to the band. In the afternoon, I spoke to two rather
pretty girls who were walking on the promenade by themselves.
They proved smilingly agreeable to my society and at first I was
inclined to congratulate myself upon my charm. But soon finding
them very greedy in the consumption of iced drinks, and, later,
both of them informing me most pointedly of their firm intention
to keep together for the whole time of their stay in the town, I
came to the conclusion that the adventure would not be
profitable to pursue any farther and so bade them good-bye. They
had cost me four and sixpence.</p>

<p>The next morning, the moment the <i>Chronicle</i> appeared on
the streets, I bought a copy, and proceeded to scan down its
columns, for some reason with certain feelings of apprehension.
A two-inch advertisement at once caught my eye.</p>

<br>

<p class="cp"><b>&pound;100 Reward</b>.</p>

<p class="quote">The above sum will be paid to
anyone providing information leading to the recovery of a
leather bank-wallet and contents, dropped about two thirty-five
p.m. on Monday last from car on the cliff road between Birling
Gap and Beachy Head. Apply Southern and Sussex Bank,
Eastbourne."</p>

<p><br>
A shiver ran down my spine. So they had not recovered the
wallet, and from the wording of the advertisement, they did not
consider it had been 'Lost.' They knew it had been stolen! Then
without doubt the police were working frenziedly to pick up my
trail! There were eyes on the lookout all around me and if my
identity were uncovered it would mean penal servitude for
me!</p>

<p>My knees began to totter as I furtively wiped the
perspiration from my forehead. Then, all in a second, a fierce
glow of relief and thanksgiving surged through me. I was a fool,
for what had the missing wallet now to do with me? It was not in
my possession and there was nothing to link me up with its
disappearance. Certainly, I had been in danger once, but I had
slipped through their cordon and was now quite safe. Yes, I was
quite safe! I need not be disturbed in the slightest. Things
were only amusing.</p>

<p>And I continued in the same frame of mind for all the
remainder of the day. I was hugging to myself a great secret in
which no one had a share and it was most gratifying. I chuckled,
too, with glee, thinking how I had repaid the red-faced man,
both for his cruelty to the seagulls and the caddish, low-down
trick of his car having been driven so dangerously close to
me.</p>

<p>The next morning I went for a long walk over the Downs
towards East Dean, first making my way round to where I had seen
the man with the sheep. I sat on the edge of a big chalk-pit
there, looking across the little valley which lay between me and
the old lighthouse on the farther ridge of down and deliberating
whether it would be safe to go and see if the wallet were where
I had left it.</p>

<p>Different from the last time I had been there, quite a number
of people were about, and, after a few minutes' rest, I strolled
over towards Belle Toute. I walked round the lighthouse and then
started in the direction of Beachy Head, proceeding quite
leisurely and with my eyes upon the ground.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in picking out the big slab of chalk, but
to my annoyance saw at once that I could not be sure if the
wallet were there unless I lifted it up. The slab seemed to be
resting quite evenly on the turf.</p>

<p>I did not dare stop, for there was a picnic party not fifty
yards away, and if they saw me disturbing the stone, their
curiosity might become aroused and when I had left they might
come over to see what had been interesting me.</p>

<p>My conscience, but the fat would be in the fire with a
vengeance then!</p>

<p>So I set off for Eastbourne again, resolved, however, I would
return again after dark. From complete indifference as to what
would happen to the wallet, I was now cudgelling my brains as to
how I could capitalise my knowledge of where, if no one had
taken it away, it could be found. I thought I ought to get the
reward, if only because the red-faced man would probably have to
pay it.</p>

<p>Yes, I would come back that night and, all being well, carry
the wallet away to another hiding-place, one to which I could
direct the bank without any difficulty when I thought fit to let
them regain their property. Some hazy idea was forming in my
mind of writing to them anonymously, offering to return the
wallet intact if the reward were paid and no questions asked. I
just mention that to show that up to then I had no thought of
interfering with the contents of the wallet.</p>

<p>I had intended to start off for Belle Toute about eight
o'clock that evening, but soon after six it started to rain
heavily and I had to put the expedition off. I did not fancy a
ten-mile trip over the Downs upon a stormy night. Besides, I
must have the moonlight to enable me to find the wallet.</p>

<p>So, instead of going out after tea, I sat on in the coffee
tavern and studied a sporting paper. I knew something about
racing and looked to see what horses were running at the
Brighton fixture upon the following Saturday. My interest
quickened at once when I saw that Ashanti Gold was down to run
in the six-furlong sprint.</p>

<p>The horse was an old favourite of mine, but only after the
silly way so many little bettors have. I had never had any
particular information about him, but had often backed him
because a grandfather of mine had fought in the Ashanti War.
Ashanti Gold, an aged gelding now, had won only a few times in
his rather undistinguished career, with very long intervals in
between. Still, when he had won it had been invariably at good
odds, twenty to one and over.</p>

<p>I wished sadly I were going to Brighton on Saturday, for with
his many failures he owed me quite a bit of money in a small
way, and I thought it about time the old boy popped up
again.</p>

<p>The next day was bright and fine, and with the wallet more
than ever in my mind, I was eagerly awaiting the coming of
evening. I bought a small electric torch to equip myself for the
adventure.</p>

<p>Then that morning I did a very silly thing which might easily
have got me into trouble. I knew where the police-station was,
and walked round to it to see if by any chance there was a bill
posted up outside about the wallet.</p>

<p>Sure enough there was, and like a big gaby, I was not content
to read it once but must have done so quite half a dozen times.
It was worded almost exactly the same as the advertisement in
the paper, except that on this notice people were now asked to
come to the police if they had any information.</p>

<p>The bill was more conspicuous than the other notices upon the
board, because it stood at one end all by itself. It quite
fascinated me, and I stood grinning to myself at the thought of
what a surprise I could cause if I went inside and told them
what I knew.</p>

<p>Then, out of the tail of my eye, I saw a man come through the
open door of the police-station, about a dozen paces away, and
proceed to walk leisurely in my direction. I cursed under my
breath at the reckless folly which had allowed me to be seen
anywhere near the station, for I recognised him instantly as one
of the detectives who had spoken to the driver of the char-a-banc
that eventful afternoon upon Beachy Head. He was the 'tec
whom the driver had said was Joe Whitburn, 'a smart chap.'</p>

<p>But if I am prone to silly mistakes, I am always like
lightning in my attempts to avoid their consequences, and now I
composed my features instantly to a wooden expression and
continued to stare on at the poster. Then, as if I had felt
rather than seen the detective walking up to me, I turned myself
half round to regard him casually and with no special interest.
It happened I had got an unlighted cigarette in my hand.</p>

<p>"Could you oblige me with a match, sir?" I asked, after a
moment, as he, too, stood looking at the poster.</p>

<p>He regarded me pleasantly. "Certainly!" he smiled, and he
made to feel in his pockets for a box. Then he smiled as if
rather amused. "But I'm afraid I can't. I don't appear to have
got any. Oh, come inside, will you? I'll give you one," and he
jerked his head towards the doorway from where he'd just
come.</p>

<p>I frowned. "What, into the police-station?" I asked. I looked
down at his big boots. "Then you're a detective are you?" I
forced a grin to my face. "Do you want to take me up?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "No, no, why should I?" He seemed to think it a
good joke. "You've not done anything wrong, have you?"</p>

<p>"Plenty of things," I laughed back. I pretended to look very
knowing. "But I haven't been found out yet."</p>

<p>With great good humour he led the way into the station and I
dared not back out. My heart was thumping like a sledge-hammer,
but I kept my wits about me, and to give colour to my being
without matches, while following behind him made a lightning
transference of a box of matches from my trouser pocket to the
top of my jacket. People never carried matches there.</p>

<p>The detective led me into a big room, untenanted except for a
stout policeman seated behind a tall desk. "Got a match, Bob?"
he asked and, the policeman handing him a box, he passed it over
to me to help myself.</p>

<p>Then when I had struck a match and was in the act of lighting
my cigarette, with quick movements and before I realised what he
was going to do, he had passed his hands in turn, over both my
trouser pockets and the side ones of my jacket.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" I called out angrily, and stepping back a pace or
two. "What are you up to? Are you giving me the once over?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," he laughed, "but I thought it funny that, as a
smoker, you'd got no matches on you."</p>

<p>"I'd forgotten them," I replied surlily. "I left them at
home."</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, I saw the whole expression of his face alter,
with the pleasant, easy-going smile all in a few seconds
changing into a hard frown. "Here, I say," he asked sharply,
"where have I seen you before?"</p>

<p>I shook my head sullenly. I intended him to think I was
annoyed at his touching my clothes. "I'm sure I don't know," I
replied. I spoke sarcastically. "You might have seen me anywhere
in the town. I have not been going about in disguise."</p>

<p>"You're a visitor to Eastbourne, of course?" he glared.
"Well, how long have you been here? Since Monday! Then where
have you been staying?"</p>

<p>I glared back at him. "Mind your own business," I snapped.
"What's that to do with you?"</p>

<p>He spoke sternly. "You don't care to say? That's it, is
it?"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," I swore rudely. "If you must know, I'm
stopping at Benger's Coffee Hall and my name's plain Brown." My
anger rose. "But what the hell do you want to know for?"</p>

<p>He took out his handkerchief and blew his nose violently.</p>

<p>"Steady, steady," he reproved, "no offence is intended and,
of course, no one has anything against you." He walked over to
the window overlooking the road. "But you just come over here
and I'll explain." He was smiling again as he pointed outside
and went on. "You see, when any of us here happen to notice
anyone staring hard at that noticeboard, and staring for a long
time, one of us generally goes out to give him a glance over and
see what he's looking at so particularly." He shook one fat
forefinger playfully. "Now you might be one of those missing
husbands who's posted up for deserting his wife, mightn't you,"
and he laughed heartily at his own joke.</p>

<p>"And what did you paw me over for," I asked as if still
angered, "to see if I'd got a gun on me?"</p>

<p>He made a wry face. "When you asked me for a match I thought
it might just have been a bit of a bluff on your part to make
out you were quite unconcerned, just an excuse to appear quite
cool."</p>

<p>I was now really amused myself, not because of the trick he
had played on me, but because of the trick I had played on him.
All the same, I was still feeling a bit uncomfortable, for I saw
the stout policeman had left the room, and was wondering if his
going had had anything to do with me.</p>

<p>The detective, however, continued to be most amiable and,
forcing upon me one of his cigarettes, related quite a good
story of how an absconding bank cashier had once been caught in
that way, having shown too much interest in his description, as
posted up on the noticeboard. The policeman returned during the
recital of the story, and I would have sworn the detective
instantly took his eyes off me to flash a quick glance at his
subordinate. We parted a minute or two later on very friendly
terms, Whitburn insisting upon my keeping the entire box of
matches.</p>

<p>When I got back to the Coffee Hall for the midday meal, one
of the waitresses told me someone had rung up for me during the
morning, and upon learning I was out, had stated it didn't
matter and that he would ring up again. He hadn't given his name
and had left no message.</p>

<p>My heart went down into my boots. Of course, it was the
police station ringing up! Directly I had told that Whitburn,
the detective, where I was living, he had somehow 'given the
office' to the stout policeman to get on the 'phone and find out
if there was a Brown staying at the Coffee Hall.</p>

<p>Then why had Whitburn been suspicious about me? Ah, I had it!
The bank manager had probably described me as young and sun-scorched,
and so anyone young and looking at all sunburnt was
liable to fall under suspicion. Then should I be shadowed now I
asked myself? Should I be watched and followed so that it would
be dangerous for me to make that journey to Belle Toute I was
intending?</p>

<p>A moment's thought and I realised how foolish my fears were.
There must be thousands of sunburnt young men in Eastbourne at
that moment, in fact everybody one met showed evidences of the
hot sun. Besides, and I felt very pleased with myself there, the
very fact that I had given my correct name and address would
have cleared me at once. No, I had nothing to be afraid of and
they would never give me another thought.</p>

<p>I left the Coffee Hall that night about an hour before dark,
knowing that it would be quite all right, whatever time I
returned. It was an easy-going place and the side-door always
was kept open, with a dim light always burning in the passage
until dawn.</p>

<p>I did not take the direct road, but went up on to the Downs
through the Old Town and made for the chalk-pit where I had
rested two days previously. It was a good hour and a half's
quick walking by the way I had come, and night had well fallen
when I arrived there. Still, the moon was up and, in its second
quarter, gave plenty of light. I looked round everywhere with an
intent gaze, but as far as I could make out I was the only
person anywhere about, and so, taking my courage in my hands,
but with my heart beating rather quickly, I proceeded to make my
way to where I had left the wallet.</p>

<p>Now I will pass over, as quickly as possible, the happenings
of the next few minutes, as there are special reasons which make
it most uncomfortable for me to dwell upon them. I found the
wallet, but with more difficulty than I had expected, and, in my
search for the particular slab of chalk, had to flash my torch a
great deal longer than I liked. Apparently the wallet had not
been touched and carrying it away under my arm, it was too bulky
to tuck up my jacket, I started to make my way back in the
direction of the chalk-pit. It was in my mind then to hide the
wallet under the stones of a ruined shepherd's hut that I should
pass, about two miles farther on my way home.</p>

<p>I reached the chalk-pit and was just skirting round the top
when something, I shall never know what it was, made me suddenly
turn round and look behind me. I never think, to this day, that
I had heard anything and always believe it was sheer instinct
which made me look round, the instinct of the hunted animal,
which, although it had not come home to me as yet, I had really
become.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I looked round and saw, not twenty paces away, a man
tearing after me. The sound of his running had been deadened by
the soft turf. Panic-stricken and with my heart in my mouth, I
dashed off like a hare, but instantly there came the report of a
pistol, and I heard the hiss of a bullet close near. I knew I
had not been hit, but the firing had unnerved me and, tripping
over in my frantic haste, I found myself floundering on the
ground.</p>

<p>I struggled to regain my feet, but my pursuer was upon me the
fraction of a second too soon, and grabbing the wallet from me
with one hand, with the other struck a fierce blow at me with a
heavy stick. The blow caught me on the arm and the pain of it
infuriated me. I hurled myself at his knees and threw him over
backwards. Then, snatching up the stick by it's end, I swung a
fearful blow at his face and felt it crash home upon his
forehead with a sickening thud. He gave one deep groan, his head
lolled sideways, and then he lay quite still.</p>

<p>The whole happening from start to finish could not have taken
a minute.</p>

<p>With glaring eyes and heaving chest, I stood over the
prostrate man, intending to strike again if he made the
slightest movement. But I realised all at once that the stick I
was still holding, a big nobbed walking one, had a loaded end
and it came to me with a feeling of dreadful horror that I had
done more than stun him. I had crushed his forehead in.</p>

<p>The ghastly wound I had made stood out clear in the
moonlight, and although so few seconds had passed, it was now
ceasing to well with blood.</p>

<p>Almost choking in the quickly succeeding terror, I let the
stick fall from my shaking hand and knelt down to bend over him.
I moved his head ever so slightly with my fingers, but it sagged
back directly I took the fingers away. His mouth had now dropped
open and saliva dripped out of one corner.</p>

<p>I realised he was dead.</p>

<p>Then, strangely enough, my nerve all suddenly came back. The
horror of what I had done was submerged all in an instant by the
terror of the consequences which might follow upon me for what I
had done.</p>

<p>I was a murderer and should hang for it if I were found out!
I must save myself! I must keep my wits about me! But who was
this man&mdash;a terrible thought came to me&mdash;and was he
alone?</p>

<p>Snatching up the loaded stick again, I crouched down and
peered furtively around. There was not a moving object in sight,
and not a sound to be heard anywhere, except for the moaning of
the distant sea.</p>

<p>I looked down at the dead man again. He was middle-aged and
burly. I noted the greying hair over the temple on the
unbloodied side of his head. His clothes were good and he was
wearing big, stout boots. His jacket was buttoned up tightly to
the chin. One of the side-pockets bulged with a small bulky
object. I passed my hand over it. It was a pair of binoculars.
A-ah, then he had been watching for me to come!</p>

<p>My breath came jerkily again. Of course, he was a detective!
The police had guessed the wallet had been hidden somewhere not
far from the Birling Gap road, and, failing to find it
themselves but certain it would be picked up later by the hider,
had posted a detective to wait for him to come.</p>

<p>For quite a long minute I considered breathlessly what I must
do. Of course, the dead man would soon be missed and a search-party
at once sent out to find him but&mdash;a thrill of hope
surged through me&mdash;the search upon the Downs would always
be half-hearted because the idea would be always uppermost in
the minds of the searchers that he had fallen over the cliffs.
Those cliffs with their sheer drop of three hundred feet were
always very dangerous, and if any accident had happened, then
the body might so easily have been washed out to sea.</p>

<p>I quickly made up my mind what I would do. The longer it was
before the body was discovered, the safer I should feel, and so
I must hide it as effectively as I could. The chalk-pit was only
a few feet away and, overcoming my repugnance to handle the
body, I seized it by the heels and, dragging it to the pit-side,
toppled it over. But that was not enough, I told myself, as any
passer-by, peering over the top, would see it at once. I must
cover it over with loose pieces of chalk.</p>

<p>But, running round to the entrance to the chalk-pit, I saw
some thick bramble bushes in a corner and dragged the body well
behind them. It would be quite out of sight there.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time since I had turned to see the man
running after me, I thought of the wallet, but now feeling so
sick at heart because my folly in first hiding it had brought
upon me such dreadful consequences, I would have liked to have
left it where it was. I realised, however, that that would be
about the worst thing I could do, for the finding of the wallet
at the top of the chalk-pit would lead, naturally, to an
intensive search of the chalk-pit itself for the missing man,
if, as I thought, he were a detective concerned in its
recovery.</p>

<p>So I ran back to where the wallet was, and picking it up,
with one long last look round to make sure that I was still
unobserved, started off at an ambling run in a direction away
from the cliffs and towards the ruined shepherd's hut.</p>

<p>My run, however, soon subsided to a brisk walk. I wanted to
think, and think hard. The shock of having taken the man's life,
whoever he was, was not oppressing me so much now, as I argued
to myself that after all I had been acting only in self-defence.
I had not realised then that he represented the Law&mdash;I was
not even certain of that now&mdash;but he had shot at me and
then struck with that heavy stick. I had had to defend myself
and it had been by chance only that my one blow had killed
him.</p>

<p>So my conscience was all at once much easier about his death.
My terror, too, was not nearly so great, as I felt I should be
reasonably safe if I got back to the Coffee Hall without having
attracted the notice of anyone. But, of course, I must leave
Eastbourne the first thing in the morning. The body <i>might</i>
be found very quickly, a policeman <i>might</i> notice me going
to the Coffee Hall at nearly one o'clock in the morning, for
that would be about the time I should get home, and that
detective, Whitburn, <i>might</i> have his suspicions aroused
again about that sunburnt fellow, Brown.</p>

<p>Still, if all these things happened there would be nothing to
connect me with this man's death. I could not have left any
finger-marks upon his clothes. A-ah, and a horrible thought came
to me! But what about his boots when I had dragged him along
and, worse still, what about that loaded walking-stick which I
had hidden behind the bramble bushes, too?</p>

<p>For a few moments I again felt sick with apprehension, but
then I reassured myself. The loose chalk would have scraped
against the heels as I had let go and any finger-marks upon the
stick would hardly have survived the dirt behind the bramble
bushes. Still, I would leave as little to chance as I could, and
the Brown of the Coffee Hall would have vanished to-morrow.</p>

<p>I reached the shepherd's hut and saw at once I couldn't have
chosen a better place. I could push the wallet between the
stones of the wall, and no one would find it, unless they had
been told where to look for it. I was just going to get rid of
it when I saw by the light of my torch that the small attached
brass plate had gone, and the thought flashed instantly into my
mind that it might not be the same wallet I had picked up on the
road.</p>

<p>I whistled. Then had the real wallet been found after all and
this dummy one been put there to catch the returning thief
red-handed when, thinking all was safe, he would come to get it?</p>

<p>I snapped my teeth viciously together at the thought of the
trick which might have been played upon me. Well, I would soon
see if I were right or not, and my pocket knife was out in a
trice. I did not attempt to tamper with the lock, but cut round
the leather and in a few seconds the wallet was open.</p>

<p>Whew, it was chock full of bank-notes and treasury ones, all
done up in neat little bundles, held together with elastic
bands!</p>

<p>My heart beat painfully. What a fortune! Why, a man might
exist in comfort for his whole life upon what the wallet
contained!</p>

<p>My breath came hard and quick. Yes, it was a real fortune and
the miserly bank was offering only &pound;100 for its recovery. Their
meanness was disgraceful!</p>

<p>I found myself swallowing hard. What should I do&mdash;my
heart raced like a piston&mdash;what dare I do? At any rate one
hundred pounds belonged to me, the amount of the reward! Well, I
would take that and later on let the bank know in an anonymous
letter where the wallet with the rest of the money was to be
found. It would not be theft, just the taking for myself the
reward which I could not claim in an open way.</p>

<p>Of course, I know this was all rotten reasoning, but my mind
was not then in a state to reason correctly. I was just bluffing
myself that I was not acting dishonourably.</p>

<p>I took a bundle of one-pound treasury notes, which I judged
rightly would be a hundred, not new notes but ones which from
their appearance had been well in circulation. Then hiding the
wallet between the stones, I set off for Eastbourne.</p>

<p>My journey back was quite uneventful until I actually reached
the Coffee Hall and then, to my intense mortification, a man
arrived, exactly at the same time as I did, at the side door. He
was one of several others who were staying at the Hall. He was
small and foxy-looking, and of dark and foreign appearance. He
had always looked so oily and greasy at meal-times that I had
made the mental comment that he might well be working at a
fried-fish shop. He had tried to become friendly with me, as
indeed he had tried with everyone who was there.</p>

<p>"We are naughty boys," he now leered familiarly, smelling
horribly of beer. "Our mums would spank us if they learnt we had
been out so late," but I just muttered a curt good night and
went up to my room.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find myself falling asleep almost at once.
I slept heavily and dreamlessly, not waking up until the half-past
seven bell was sounding. My first thoughts were very
worried ones, but I was relieved to see through the window that
a drizzling rain was falling. It would be good-bye to any of my
finger-marks being found in the chalk-pit.</p>

<p>I went into the bathroom to wash, taking good care to carry
all my clothes with me. Then, back in the bedroom and just
before going down to breakfast, I took the bundle of notes from
my breast-pocket and started to count them.</p>

<p>I was in the middle of the counting when I heard footsteps in
the passage outside and, before I could hide the notes away, the
door was flung open and the foxy-looking man had burst
unceremoniously in. "Oh, I'm sorry, old man," he apologised
quickly. "I've made a mistake in the room. I mistook this for
mine," and he went out, but not nearly as quickly as he had come
in.</p>

<p>I had made no remark, but was furious in my dismay, for I had
seen his eyes boggle in amazement at the notes I had been
holding in my hand.</p>

<p>It was with an intense feeling of relief that about an hour
later I found myself in the Brighton train, intending to try my
fortune at the races there that afternoon. I had taken a return
ticket to throw any enquirers after me off the scent. I had no
idea whatsoever of returning to Eastbourne.</p>

<p>I was smoking a sixpenny cigar and travelling first-class. I
told myself I was going to start a new life.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. &mdash; THE NARRATIVE CONTINUED.</h2>

<p class="first">
AS I stepped out of the train at Brighton I felt like a man
who had been reprieved from death. The doors of the condemned
cell had been opened for me and the shadow of the scaffold was
no longer near. Looking back now, I realise how extraordinary it
was that I should have imagined the few short miles between
Eastbourne and Brighton constituted an effective barrier between
me and all the threatened dangers.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I did imagine it, and for the time being, the events
of the previous night had been put well into the background of
my mind. I had a week or more holiday before me, I had plenty of
money to spend, and I was going to make a fortune by backing
Ashanti Gold. To-day was going to be the start of a new
life.</p>

<p>Intending to frequent coffee taverns no longer, but to put up
at quite a decent hotel, I realised I must provide myself with
some luggage. So I bought a good quality second-hand suit-case
at a pawnbroker's, and proceeded to stock it with a pair of
pyjamas, some new shoes, collars, a couple of smart ties, and
some odds and ends. I also treated myself to a fashionably-shaped
felt hat. I put the suit-case in the cloakroom of the
railway-station, intending to select my hotel after I had been
to the races. I had a good lunch at a first-class restaurant,
and then took a taxi up to the race-course upon the Downs.</p>

<p>Now I always regard that afternoon as the most thrilling one
I ever spent upon a race-course. It looms out as a scarlet patch
upon all the racing days I have had later in my life. In recent
years, I have been the guest of owners of world-wide known great
thoroughbreds, I have hob-nobbed with racing peers of the realm
and I have even won a modest hurdle race myself, but never have
I experienced the thrills I did that day.</p>

<p>It was all exactly like a scene out of an exciting melodrama.
There was I, a young fellow in a very ordinary ready-made suit
operating with stolen money and with my hands, metaphorically
speaking, still red with blood, conducting myself as if I had
not a care in the world and were as trouble-free as the
lightest-hearted race-goer there.</p>

<p>Of course, moralists will say I ought to have been borne down
with the load of a guilty conscience, I ought to have been
keeping furtively in the background all the afternoon, and
regarding every policeman as a possible and even probable enemy.
But no, my conscience was not troubling me in the very least, I
was not worrying at all about the future and was supremely
confident all would go well.</p>

<p>Patronising the one-pound enclosure, I at once fixed upon the
bookmaker with whom I would make a big bet. He was Lew Hanner
and standing, as I had read he did at all race-meetings, by the
rails adjoining the Members' Enclosure. He was well-known and
very popular in the racing world, and it was said you could have
a fifty thousand pounds win with him and be quite sure of
getting your money. He betted, however, in a small way as well
as a big one.</p>

<p>Ashanti Gold was running in the second race, and I was
delighted to see he had drawn number three, close to the rails.
I felt very hopeful about his chances, as the last time he had
won it had been at Epsom, and Brighton, like Epsom, has a good
down-hill finishing run.</p>

<p>I lost a pound on the first race and, really, was glad I had
not won, for I told myself I could hardly expect to start off
right away with two winners in succession.</p>

<p>The numbers for the next race having gone up in the frame,
feeling decidedly shaky in my excitement, I took my stand near
Lew Hanner to note how the betting was going. The runners, there
were twenty-two of them, went down to the starting-post, but I
delayed making any bet until the market had well settled down. I
soon realised that Ashanti Gold was not fancied as old Lew was
not calling his name at all. Lew was doing a good business and
pencilling tickets as quickly as his clerk could put down the
bets. Fivers, tenners and even fifties were being invested, as
well as the humble one-pound note. Sun God, ridden by the crack
jockey, Dicky Jenkins, was the favourite.</p>

<p>"What price Ashanti Gold?" I asked at last, getting in my
question quickly.</p>

<p>"A hundred to three," he snapped and he jerked out a big fat
hand in anticipation of taking my bet.</p>

<p>I had got twenty one-pound notes ready, and stripping away
five of them, handed him the rest. "Five hundred to fifteen," I
said boldly.</p>

<p>He grabbed the notes without comment and after counting them
with the expertness and rapidity of a bank cashier, called the
bet out to his clerk and handed me a ticket. I felt already a
millionaire. I remained on standing by Lew, noting with interest
the bets he called out. Sun God was being heavily supported, and
his price soon shortened from twos to six to four; Venom was
five to one, and Sweetheart of Mine next to him, at sevens.
There seemed to be little demand for any of the others. An
aristocratic-looking man approached the rails from the Members'
Enclosure side and I heard Lew book him a bet of six hundred to
four hundred the favourite. Big fish and little fish were all
the same to the jovial-looking bookmaker.</p>

<p>Presently, a pretty dark-eyed girl with long sweeping
eyelashes came up to the little crowd round Lew, and waving the
others aside, Lew immediately proceeded to give all his
attention to her. "And what can I do for you, Missy?" he asked,
his face all smiles.</p>

<p>"I want a bet on Royal Realm, please, Mr. Hanner," she said
in a sweet girlish voice. "What are the odds against him?"</p>

<p>"Eight to one, Missy, but ten to one to you," replied Lew.
"How much do you want on?"</p>

<p>"Five shillings, please," said the girl, and Lew made out a
ticket with extra care, and handed it to her with a gallant
bow.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Hanner," nodded the girl, and Lew raised his
hat with a flourish as she turned away.</p>

<p>"Business after pleasure, gentlemen," announced Lew to his
other clients. "Who wants fifteen hundred to a thousand the
favourite," and one man immediately took six pounds to four.</p>

<p>Business slackened in a minute or two and then Lew looked
round for more clients. "Seven to one Sweetheart of Mine," he
called out stentoriously, "fives Venom, tens Lovely Day, twelves
Jehu and fifteens&mdash;&mdash;" His eyes fell upon me and he
held out his hand in my direction. "Want another bet, sir.
Twenty-fives Ashanti Gold!"</p>

<p>It was a challenge and I immediately took it up. "A hundred
to four," I said, and as I was peeling off the notes from a
little wad, he called out briskly, "Take it twice, sir?"</p>

<p>I nodded and, giving him the eight pounds, he handed me
another ticket.</p>

<p>I drew in a deep breath. I should win seven hundred pounds if
only Ashanti Gold got his head in front at the right moment. In
my opinion it seemed quite a simple thing for him to do.</p>

<p>But it did not seem quite so simple when, worming my way up
on to the top of the grandstand, I saw the twenty-two horses
lining up at the barrier on the other side of the
racecourse.</p>

<p>"Whew," I whispered, "what a mug I've been! Among all that
crowd any horse, however good he is, can easily get squeezed
in." I sighed. "There goes twenty-three pounds all in one
go."</p>

<p>As a rule I was not much good at picking out colours, but now
I could easily pick out those of Ashanti Gold, as they were most
appropriately green and gold. The old horse was standing as
quiet as a sheep in his allotted place.</p>

<p>"They're off," roared the crowd and the horses seemed to
avalanche forward in an unbroken line. "It'll soon be all over,"
I thought. "The six furlongs won't take them long and I shall be
out of my misery, one way or the other." A few tense moments of
comparative silence followed and then voices were raised
everywhere and the names of particular horses began to be
called. Royal Realm was leading, Belinda and Venom were in close
attendance and&mdash;oh joy!&mdash;Ashanti Gold was running
fourth. The whole field was, however, bunched and running very
close together.</p>

<p>The horses swept round to face us and I could see the green
and gold prominent as they commenced the descent down the hill.
A blanket would have covered the first five or six.</p>

<p>Then, as I had so fondly hoped he would do when approaching
the end of his journey, Ashanti Gold shot forward like an arrow
out of a bow. To my dismay, however, Sun God came with him too.
It was a horrible moment! They ran neck and neck together, and
stride by stride, the coming of them both was like the coming of
one single horse. The crowd roared with excitement and then when
within fifty yards of the winning-post&mdash;the anguish of the
damned for me&mdash;something happened to Ashanti Gold! He
faltered and almost came down on to his knees, allowing Sun God
to draw right away from him and win easily by three or four
lengths. Ashanti Gold just managed to take second place by the
very shortest of heads from Royal Realm.</p>

<p>I stood stunned, and almost choked in my disappointment as I
saw the numbers ten, three and eighteen hoisted into the frame
above the judge's box. I had been so near to winning all that
money and the cup had been dashed from me when almost at my very
lips. It was a dreadful blow.</p>

<p>I went down into the bar and had a double brandy. The place
was crowded and I had to fight my way in. Everyone seemed to be
talking at once, but for two or three minutes as far as I was
concerned, their shouts and laughter fell upon deaf ears. I was
in a deep reverie, with my thoughts now harking back
unpleasantly to that chalk-pit near Beachy Head.</p>

<p>"What!" I heard an incredulous voice exclaim, "you say the
all right's not gone up! Jenkins can't draw the weight!"</p>

<p>"That's what I heard," replied a man who was making his way
towards the counter. "At any rate there's a big crowd by the
weighing-room door and they say Jenkins has weighed out short by
three pounds."</p>

<p>With my heart in my mouth, I elbowed myself outside as
quickly as I could. So there was a chance even yet! I had still
a hope of getting the money!</p>

<p>I came in sight of the judge's box and saw the hoist with the
numbers on it had been taken down. Then, even as I stood stock-still
with gaping mouth, up went the frame again and number
three was at the top!</p>

<p>Ashanti Gold had been given the race!</p>

<p>A buzz of excitement ran round and there were glum faces
everywhere. Sun God had been backed so heavily that his
starting-price turned out to be even money. The big bettors had
plunged on him.</p>

<p>What had happened was that a three-pound weight had dropped
out of the favourite's saddlebags, but no one could explain how
it had come about. Certainly, he had weighed out correctly but,
returning to scale, he was nearly three pounds short. The
stewards were investigating the matter.</p>

<p>I allowed myself a couple of minutes or so to calm down and
then, assuming a phlegmatic air, approached Lew Hanner to
collect my winnings. I expected him to look glum at having to
part with so large a sum but, instead, he greeted me with a
smile.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you won, sir," he said heartily, "I was deep in on
the favourite, with very heavy money," and he proceeded to hand
over to me fourteen crisp new fifty-pound notes, all in a
sequence, and two tenners and a fiver.</p>

<p>I folded the notes carefully and put them in the breast-pocket
of my jacket, stuffing my handkerchief well down on top.
Then, I did one of the wisest things I could have done. I went
to the top of the grandstand and let the next three races go by
without a bet. I had no particular fancy running in any of them,
and had I betted at all, should only have been guided by popular
opinion and backed the favourite.</p>

<p>And as it turned out it was a good thing I had kept my money.
Everyone of the three favourites went down like ninepins, with
none of them being even placed. Then, on the sixth and last race
I thought it about time, according to the law of averages, that
a favourite should win.</p>

<p>So I came off the grand-stand and started backing Man of War
at two to one. I had intended having only five pounds on him,
but, the idea coming to me all at once that it would be a good
thing to rid myself of the incriminating one-pound notes I had
taken from the wallet, I invested ten of them with each of six
different bookmakers, in each case getting the same odds, two to
one. So I stood to win another one hundred and twenty pounds if
Man of War won.</p>

<p>And win all right, he did, easily and never giving his
backers a moment's anxiety. In every instance except one, the
bookmaker gave me the fifteen due in the form of three five-pound
notes. So I reckoned that by the time I returned to
London, I should have all clean money upon me.</p>

<p>Recovering my suit-case from the railway-station cloakroom, I
put up at the Regent Hotel, a good-class old-fashioned hotel
upon the front.</p>

<p>There I passed three peaceful, uneventful days, in the main
considering what use I should make of my newly acquired wealth.
As much as possible I tried to put altogether out of my mind all
that had taken place in Eastbourne, but of course, in spite of
all my efforts it was often recurring to me. I was not, however,
particularly worried about it, being more curious than worried.
I wondered if the body had been discovered. Somehow I hardly
thought it had, although, of course, I scanned the newspapers
both morning and evening, for any news. Monday and Tuesday
having passed, I thought everything was quite safe, confidently
imagining it might be months or even years before it was found
out what had happened to the man I had killed.</p>

<p>On the Wednesday morning, however, I got a rude shock and
could hardly choke down a morsel of breakfast. Not only had the
body been found, but the <i>London Daily Messenger</i> had made
a scoup and got hold of the whole story, actually linking up the
murder, not only with the missing bank-wallet, but also, in a
most positive manner, with the cyclist the bank officers had
passed upon the road.</p>

<p>It was woeful reading for me, and the farther I read down the
newspaper story the more uncomfortable I felt.</p>

<p>It appeared that at first the police had by no means been as
sure as the bank officials that the solitary cyclist had been
responsible for the missing wallet. They argued that an object
leaving a rapidly travelling car might easily have been flung
much farther away than the road itself, and therefore, that the
wallet would probably be found somewhere in the turf by the
roadside or in one of the many little channels and depressions
lying on either side of the road.</p>

<p>So a party of them, in a police car and attended by the two
bank officials in their own car, had gone, as they thought most
carefully over the whole stretch of road as far as Birling Gap.
Their mistake had been that they had ridden in a car instead of
walking, because they had remained seated when passing the
exposed parts of the Down, only getting out to investigate more
closely when they came to places where the wallet might have
found a resting-place in one of these channels or depressions.
They had never thought of looking under the lumps of chalk
scattered everywhere about in full view for anyone to see.</p>

<p>Not finding the wallet, however, and no cyclist having been
caught with it in his possession, they had yielded to the
insistence of the red-faced bank manager from Brighton that the
cyclist had hidden it somewhere and would return later to
retrieve it from its hiding-place.</p>

<p>So on that Monday evening a number of plain-clothes men,
provided with powerful binoculars, had been placed in hiding,
well away from the Beachy Head-Birling Gap Road, on the look-out
for anyone on foot, on bicycle or in car, who appeared to be
acting suspiciously. The watch had been kept up night and day.
Nothing, however, having happened by the Thursday morning, the
bank people had been notified that the watching men had been
withdrawn, it now being the police opinion that it was waste of
time to continue any longer.</p>

<p>Declining to take that view, the Bank Association in London
had then, themselves, moved in the matter and engaged two
private detectives to continue the watch. These men, who had
many times carried out private investigations in Bank circles in
London, had taken lodgings in the little village of East Dean
about two miles inland from the place to be watched. One had
taken the day duty and the other, Matthew Brendon, the night
one.</p>

<p>Nothing had happened on the Thursday and the Friday but, upon
the second man, Henderson, going to relieve his colleague on the
Saturday morning at the rendezvous agreed upon, a small coppice
of trees about a mile from Belle Toute lighthouse, had been
rather disturbed when Brendon did not turn up.</p>

<p>An hour passed, two, and there being still no appearance of
Brendon, Henderson became extremely uneasy and rang up the
Eastbourne police from the Beachy Head coastguard station.</p>

<p>The Superintendent of the Eastbourne Police was not inclined
to be much interested and advised a longer wait, but Brendon not
having turned up by the evening, Henderson motored down into the
town and insisted he should be helped in his search for the
missing man.</p>

<p>The Eastbourne Superintendent was now more willing to listen,
as he had just received a telephone message from the Beachy Head
coastguard station stating that two boys had reported seeing a
smashed-up bicycle upon the rocks at the foot of the cliffs,
midway between the Head and Birling Gap. The Superintendent was
wondering if it had anything to do with the disappearing cyclist
of the previous week.</p>

<p>So once again a police search-party was sent up on the Downs,
but it being got together so late and the inevitable rain
beginning to fall heavily again, very little ground had been
covered before the darkness and the storm made further search
most difficult.</p>

<p>Henderson had been very angry at the procrastination, as he
called it, of the local police and that night telephoned to his
employers in London that he was not being given the assistance
that he should. He also added the information about the smashed-up
bicycle which had been found and gave it as his opinion that
the whole business had an ugly look. It seemed more than
probable, he said, that Matthew Brendon had met with foul
play.</p>

<p>The Bank people at once put pressure upon Scotland Yard and
the following morning, the Sunday morning, two men of the
Criminal Investigation Department had been motored down,
accompanied by two highly trained police dogs. The Downs had
then been systematically gone over, yard by yard, and the dogs
sent into every place where it was possible a body could have
been hidden.</p>

<p>No success had rewarded the police efforts until the
afternoon, and then they had made a horrible discovery. In a
disused chalk-pit about half a mile from Belle Toute lighthouse,
they had found the dead body of Matthew Brendon, with his head
terribly battered in. Close near him was his own walking-stick
and, from its bloodied state, there was no doubt he had been
bashed to death with its heavily loaded end.</p>

<p>But that had not been all the police had found. Scouting
about upon the Downs round the chalk-pit they had come across,
first, the dead man's automatic pistol, with one cartridge
discharged, and then the small brass plate inscribed 'Southern
and Sussex Bank, Brighton Branch' which had been affixed to the
missing wallet.</p>

<p>Such was the story the <i>Daily Messenger</i> dished up for
its readers, and then it proceeded to elaborate the story and
speculate as to all that had happened to lead up to the finding
of Matthew Brendon's body.</p>

<p>My blood ran cold at the accuracy of its deductions.</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">"A young man," it began, "was bicycling along
the Beachy Head road upon that fateful Monday morning. He was
undoubtedly a holiday-maker, because, at the particular hour of
that day when things began to happen about two o'clock, anyone
in business would not have been free. Besides, his face was
sun-scorched, which suggests he was not as a general rule accustomed
to much sunshine and fresh air. So we can take it for granted he
was upon holiday, and be almost certain again&mdash;because he
was carrying no luggage upon his machine&mdash;that he was
staying in the neighbourhood. Therefore, it is not unreasonable
to presume he was making his headquarters in Eastbourne.</p>

<p class="quote">"So we now have a young man cycling along, but
unhappily, because he was wearing big sun-glasses and had his
cap pulled low down over his forehead, we can give no
description of him except to say that he was of medium height,
was not of stout build, and had this very sun-scorched face.</p>

<p class="quote">"Well, this young man is passed by a motor-car
going at a good speed and, when it has gone by, he suddenly sees
a biggish object flung out from it at the back, without the
occupants of the car noticing it has gone. Picking it up, he
sees it has a bank's name on it, on a small brass plate, and he
guesses at once it contains money. He decides, and he decides
quickly, for Mr. Stormer, the Brighton Manager, is sure not more
than five minutes elapsed between his being first overtaken and
later his being asked if he'd seen anything of the wallet. He
hides it and, most probably, if we only knew, in some very
simple place, a place so simple that no one thought of looking
for it there. Most likely under a stone&mdash;a big chalk
stone&mdash;for there are plenty lying about all over the Downs
very close to the road. He tells himself he will return and get
it another day.</p>

<p class="quote">"He cycles on and presently the car comes
rushing back. He is questioned and replies surlily in a
monosyllable. The car goes on. Then he probably realises that
things are not going to be as easy for him as he expected. The
men in the car will not find the wallet and they will be back in
a minute to question him again. They may become suspicious of
him as he is the only person they have encountered upon the
road. They may want his name and address, and put the police on
him to find out all they can about him. Perhaps he already has a
bad record, perhaps where he lives he is a known bad egg.</p>

<p class="quote">"At any rate, he gets uneasy and anticipates
their quick return, darts off the roadway and hides himself
behind a big clump of blackberry bushes near the cliff. We are
not guessing wildly there, as will be seen in a moment. The car
comes tearing by, and he gets more than uneasy. He gets
frightened. He is playing for big stakes and is afraid now he
will lose them. Everyone will be looking for a man with a
bicycle. Then what does he do? He cuts himself away from the
bicycle by toppling it over the cliff, over the cliff, mind you,
exactly behind that big clump of blackberry bushes we have just
mentioned. That's how we came to state so definitely he had been
hiding there.</p>

<p class="quote">"What happens next? He gets back to Eastbourne
unchallenged, and he sits tight and waits. Oh, he has patience,
this young fellow! We are getting to know something of his
character by now. Well, he waits all Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, and then he thinks it will be quite safe for him to go
and get the wallet. He knows it had not been found, at all
events up to the Wednesday morning, because there is a reward
advertised in the local Eastbourne paper that morning. Yes, he
will go and get it, but whether he is intending to keep its
contents or just claim the &pound;100 reward, we do not know. From his
subsequent actions we should say he was going to adopt the
former course.</p>

<p class="quote">"To continue. That night after darkness had
well set in, he makes his way to where he had hidden the wallet
and retrieves it, but he is seen by Matthew Brendon and pursued.
He attempts to escape by running away. We know that because
Matthew Brendon fired one shot at him, which the detective would
certainly not have done had he been at close quarters, as he was
armed with that heavy loaded stick.</p>

<p class="quote">"What took place then we may, perhaps, never
learn, but there was undoubtedly a fierce struggle, ending in
Brendon being battered to death with his own weapon. It is
certain the struggle took place at the top of the chalk-pit,
because the detective's pocket knife and a shilling and two
pennies were found lying upon the turf there. Also, from the
marks upon the body when found, and the condition, too, of the
clothes, there is no doubt the dead man was pushed over the pit
side before being dragged behind those bushes in the corner.
Another thing, the brass plate from the wallet was picked up
close to where the coins lay."</p>

<br>

<p>The <i>Daily Messenger</i> went on:</p>

<p class="quote">"That is where our story ends, and what has
happened since only one person, the thief-murderer of Beachy
Head, knows. What has he done now? Has he secreted his
bloodily-acquired plunder in another hiding-place, prepared to bide
his time once again until he can return to it in seeming safety?
Where is he himself? His holiday over, has he faded back into
his usual routine work, perhaps even in this great city of ours?
Is he an unassuming clerk in some office, or an obsequious
assistant in some shop? Who knows? Shall we ever know? Indeed,
this tragedy of Beachy Head may turn out to be yet another
mystery never to be solved. To conclude, there are still,
however, certain points worth remembering which, with the
intelligent co-operation of the community may help the
authorities to yet bring this thief and assassin within the
meshes of the Law.</p>

<p class="quote">"The police are looking for a young man who, as
we have said, was most probably upon his annual holiday last
Monday week, who was in possession of a bicycle then, but who
has not one now, or has one different from that he formerly had.
Also, they want people to keep a look out for a young fellow
who, returning from his holiday, is noticed to be flush with
money. Unhappily, and the fact seems to be no secret, the
numbers of none of the missing notes are known, as they were
none of them of a greater value than &pound;10 and all had been in
circulation before. So no help can be expected there. As for the
disposition of the wanted man, he must be shrewd and with plenty
of courage and determination. We can be quite sure of that.
Therefore, knowing even this little that we do about the wanted
man, let us all think hard and see what we can do to assist the
authorities. It is not a pleasant thought that such a dreadful
crime as murder can be committed and the miscreant escape
scot-free."</p>

<p><br>
I put down the paper with a sickening feeling in my stomach.
This wretched newspaper had put, literally, millions of private
investigators upon my track and I realised to the full how wary
I must be not to excite suspicion in anyone.</p>

<p>To begin with, I must leave Brighton at once. With that
bicycle now in the possession of the police, there were
decidedly dangerous possibilities as to where it might lead
them. They would notice it had been recently repainted and had
new tyres and new rubbers to the pedals, and they would see it
could have covered only a very small mileage since it had been
done up. So, they might start enquiring at bicycle shops in all
directions, and at the one where I had bought it, obtain a good
description of me. To my horror I suddenly recollected I had
bought my cheap sun-glasses there, at the same time.</p>

<p>I left Brighton that morning by the eleven-o'clock train and
went straight back to West Kensington, having resolved to spend
the last remaining days of my holiday at home. My boarding-house
was kept by two hard-working middle-aged sisters who were of a
most incurious disposition and who, as long as their boarders
paid up punctually never seemed to take the slightest interest
in what they did. So they showed no surprise at my unexpected
return.</p>

<p>I was glad to be home again, and in the peace and quietness
of my own room considered over and over again what I should do
with the money, which to me seemed a huge sum, now in my
possession. I had come back with more than nine hundred pounds
and was keeping it always on me, in a money belt I had bought at
Brighton. Eight hundred pounds was all my own, but the remaining
one hundred pounds I was intending to return to the bank. I
still argued to myself that I was entitled to it, but believed
now its retention would bring me bad luck. Amusing as it may be
to anyone reading this I wanted, too, my conscience to be
clear.</p>

<p>With the eight hundred pounds I intended to speculate and,
working in a broker's office, I considered I stood the best of
chances of increasing my capital. I must, however, be very wary
in what I did. Tips, which it was confidently assumed would
bring great and speedy wealth, were continually being passed
round. Some, of course, were quite worthless, but several times
I had heard of others which if they had been followed up would
have turned out to be splendid investments, and we in the office
never forgot the small fortune one of our number had made, only
a couple of years back, by a lucky plunge in some cheap, and at
the time, very despised gold shares.</p>

<p>With a capital of less than one hundred pounds, he had
plunged and plunged confidently, in the six weeks of a small
boom, making more than twelve thousand pounds. We always sighed
with envy when we thought of him.</p>

<p>Thursday, the day following upon my return, was very wet, and
I stayed at home all day, finishing my book. <i>The Martyrdom of
Man,</i> with the intention of changing it that evening at the
Fulham Public Library.</p>

<p>The newspapers had still a lot to say about 'The Beachy Head
Murder,' but there was really no fresh news and, apparently, the
police had picked up no clues. I fervently hoped they hadn't,
and was in quite a happy frame of mind when I went out about
seven o'clock to change my book.</p>

<p>Then, my complacency received a nasty jar when, upon entering
the Library, I passed a man whom I recognised at once as the
dark oily-looking fellow who had been staying at the Coffee Hall
in Eastbourne when I had been there. It was he who had burst so
unceremoniously into my room and had seen me counting those
notes.</p>

<p>He gave no sign of recognition, which made me most uneasy,
for I knew he must have seen me and was, of all kinds of people,
the last one who would not want to renew the acquaintanceship
unless he had some very particular reason for keeping away.</p>

<p>I felt my mouth grow dry in apprehension. It was a most
calamitous encounter and my imagination instantly went soaring
in conjecture as to how it happened he was there and, worse
still, why he had pretended not to see me.</p>

<p>I took a long time selecting the book I wanted, to let myself
calm down and, also, in the hope that I should not run up
against him again when I went out. In this last respect I was a
little bit relieved, for I saw no signs of him. Still, I walked
home by a roundabout way and many times stopped to look in shop
windows, giving a furtive look back to see if I was being
followed. But I never saw anyone like him in sight, and arrived
at the boarding-house much easier in my mind.</p>

<p>It was just a coincidence, I told myself. Of course, the man
had to live somewhere and no doubt his home was in Fulham.
Happily Fulham was a big place and the chances were I should
never see him again. No, I had nothing to fear.</p>

<p>My confident state of mind lasted until I got into bed and
picked up the new book I had just got from the library,
intending to have a comfortable read until I felt ready to go to
sleep. Then the big staring label on the cover suddenly caught
my eye. 'Fulham Public Library' in large blue lettering on a
white background! Good God, and I had sat opposite to him at
meals reading <i>The Martyrdom of Man</i> in an exactly similar
cover!</p>

<p>I could feel the cold shiver run down my back and my teeth
almost chattered in my dismay. To my guilty conscience
everything was now as plain as day, and my mind leapt from
stepping-stone to stepping-stone over a dark stream, the farther
shore of which held arrest and the scaffold for me.</p>

<p>The man had seen me come home late upon the very night of the
murder and the next morning he had seen me counting a fat wad of
notes! He had gone to the police and told them, and he had added
the information that I had been reading a book taken out from
the Fulham Public Library!</p>

<p>Oh, how plain it was! He had been posted at the Library to
watch for my coming! Detectives had been there with him and he
had pointed me out to them and it was they, not he, who had
followed me home to see where I lived! The house was being
watched now and in the morning I should be arrested!</p>

<p>I was panic-stricken in my terror and if the police had only
arrived then, I am sure I should not have had the strength of
mind to deny anything, but should have broken down and weakly
confessed to all that had taken place.</p>

<p>But the police did not arrive, the house was as quiet as a
church, and gradually everything fell into its proper
perspective. What had I to fear if the police did come? They had
nothing against me, no proof of anything, and if I stuck to my
story, they could not get behind it.</p>

<p>So I became thankful for my good fortune in having time to
prepare what I would say, and point by point, I went over what
my story would be. It was a good story, because so much of it I
could prove, both with chapter and verse. As far as I could see
my one and only danger was that they might trace the bicycle
back to the shop where I had bought it and the man who had sold
it be able to give an accurate description of me. Certainly the
bicycle itself was a nondescript sort of machine for anyone to
recognise and remember, but those new rubbers to the pedals plus
the two new tyres would be most damning aids to both recognition
and remembrance of everything relating to its sale.</p>

<p>As events proved I was quite right it was a danger, and
months afterwards I was to learn how narrowly I had escaped.
Some years later, too, a well-known detective wrote his memoirs
and a copy of the published book happened to fall into my hands.
Speaking of 'The Beachy Head Murder' he wrote that the police
had been most unlucky in everything relating to the bicycle the
murderer had ridden.</p>

<p>As I had thought they would, they had seen at once that the
bicycle could only have been ridden a few miles since the new
pedal rubbers had been put on, and accordingly, an S.O.S. call
had been sent out to every police-station in the Southern
Counties to find out from the bicycle shops in their particular
districts if anything were known about a machine which had been
fitted with them.</p>

<p>Then, the little bicycle shop in Brighton had been located
within twenty-four hours, with the wife of the proprietor
certain the bicycle had been recently sold from them for four
pounds. She could not, however, give the exact day as she had
been upon a visit to London when it was sold, only returning on
the previous Thursday to help nurse her husband who had been
taken ill with pneumonia, and who had passed away the very
morning of the day the police called to make enquiries.</p>

<p>Of course, at the time I knew nothing of all this but it
continued to worry me, more or less, for a long time.</p>

<p>As can be well imagined, I got very little sleep that night
after seeing the oily-looking man in the Public Library, but the
next morning I felt quite fresh and perfectly resolute in my
determination to play my cards well, if what I was so
confidently expecting really happened. If it were going to
happen I hoped it could come soon, while I was buoyed up to
concert pitch.</p>

<p>I had not long to wait. I had had my breakfast and was back
in my bed-sitting-room, when writing a letter to a married
sister in Scotland, the only relation I have, when I heard
footsteps on the stairs, and the slatternly little maid rapped
on the door and opened it.</p>

<p>"Two gentlemen to see you, Mr. Brown," she called out, and
without ceremony she ushered them in, and shuffling back into
the passage, closed the door behind them.</p>

<p>I regarded my visitors with a frown. One, apparently, in the
late thirties, was big and inclined to be stout, while the
other, about the same age, was tall and lean. They both returned
my frown with interest. They looked men of authority, as indeed
they were, and destined to become in a very few years time two
of the most important men at Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>The stout man spoke first, quite quietly, but with a stern,
hard note in his voice. "We are from the Criminal Investigation
Department," he said, producing a card. "I am Inspector Stone
and this gentleman is Inspector Carter. We want a word with
you."</p>

<p>I affected to gasp in astonishment. "You're from the police!"
I exclaimed. My voice shook without any need of pretence. "But
haven't you made a mistake? My name is Brown."</p>

<p>"Quite so," he commented grimly, "and you're the man we
want." His eyes bored at me like gimlets. "You've recently been
staying at Eastbourne, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," I faltered, "up to last Saturday!"</p>

<p>He nodded. "Exactly, and we believe you can tell us something
about that bank-wallet which was lost on Beachy Head."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;tell you about the bank-wallet?" I stuttered. My
very astonishment steadied my voice. "But I don't know anything
about it!"</p>

<p>He nodded again. "No, of course not! But for all that you're
coming with us to headquarters to answer a lot of questions
we're going to put." He produced a paper from his pocket. "Now
I've got a search-warrant here and we're going through this
room. I understand it's the only room you occupy in this house."
He spoke sharply. "Got any fire-arms?"</p>

<p>My confidence was beginning to come back and I laughed
derisively. "No, not even a sub-machine gun. Then, do you think
I'm a gangster?"</p>

<p>He ignored my question. "Any poison on you?" he asked.</p>

<p>I held my hands above my head. "Search me if you want to. No,
of course, I've got no poison."</p>

<p>He pointed to a chair. "Well, you sit there and don't you
move whilst we look round." He eyed me intently. "Is there any
money here?"</p>

<p>I grinned. "Yes, plenty."</p>

<p>He spoke sarcastically. "A few shillings and some coppers I
suppose you'll tell us!"</p>

<p>I grinned again. "No, hundreds of pounds. As a matter of fact
I've got more money in my belt than either of you'll earn,
perhaps, in three or four years."</p>

<p>His eyebrows straightened in a heavy frown. He didn't know
whether to believe me or not. So frank an admission was
evidently not what he'd been expecting. "Then where did you get
it from?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Betting," I replied laconically.</p>

<p>He grunted contemptuously. "Of course! It's always got in
that way." He lifted one hand warningly. "Well, you sit on
exactly where you are and don't move an inch. Keep your hands
out of your pockets."</p>

<p>Then for perhaps twenty minutes and longer, I sat watching
those two clumsy-looking men search the room and go through
everything in it. But there was nothing clumsy about their
movements and they did everything quickly and with method.
First, they went through the contents of the wardrobe, holding
every garment up to the light and scrutinising it most
carefully.</p>

<p>"Looking for blood-stains?" I asked mockingly.</p>

<p>For a long moment, with one of my jackets upraised in his
arms, the stout inspector stood motionless as a graven image,
with his eyes, as hard as flint, searching mine. "So, so," he
exclaimed at last, "then you know what it is possible we may
find?"</p>

<p>I laughed lightly. "I know what it is certain you would like
to find," I retorted. "Blood-hounds want blood, don't they? And
that's what, as detectives, you are after." I spoke brusquely.
"Goodness gracious, do you think I don't read the newspapers and
haven't seen that the thief who stole the wallet is supposed to
have killed that man in the chalk-pit too? Why, that's been the
only thing of interest in the papers lately and imagine how
interesting it's been to me, considering I was in Eastbourne
when it all happened."</p>

<p>The inspector withdrew his eyes very slowly from my face and
went on with his search. He stopped to ask me only one more
question and, that one, when he was examining the soles of a
pair of my shoes. "Where do you keep your bicycle?" he asked
casually and, as if with some certain evidence under his eyes, I
should not dare to deny I had recently been cycling.</p>

<p>But I did deny it, with contemptuous amusement. "I haven't
got one," I replied. "So I don't keep it anywhere. I haven't
cycled for years."</p>

<p>He made no comment and went on with the search. Chest of
drawers, cupboard, writing-desk and the mattress of the bed all
came in for his attention. Then the mats and linoleum were
lifted and the floor-boards most carefully examined.</p>

<p>"You're wasting all your time," I warned them, "and after
I've been questioned you'll realise what ninnies you've been,"
but they took not the slightest notice of me and went on poking
about everywhere.</p>

<p>At last, however, they had finished and then Inspector
Stone&mdash;he had taken command of everything, with the other
inspector not saying a word&mdash;motioned me to get up. "You're
not going to give us trouble?" he asked. "You'll come
quietly?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will," I replied. I smiled. "I'm looking forward
to going with you. It will be an adventure. How are we
going?"</p>

<p>"We've a car outside," he said, "just round the corner."</p>

<p>"And how'll I get home again?" I asked. "You'll surely not
make me bus it or train it back?"</p>

<p>He smiled for the first time. "We'll see about that, later
on, my son. Now I'm going to lock your door and take away the
key."</p>

<p>I really quite enjoyed that ride. I had always lived a very
humdrum life and I was now dipping deep into high adventure. I
was still not a bit afraid I should be found out. I had only to
keep a bold front, I told myself, and they had absolutely no
proof of anything against me. The Daily Messenger had stated
most distinctly that the two bank men in the car could give no
proper description of me, and as for the man in the shop where I
had bought the bicycle, well, even if they did succeed in
getting in touch with him it was hardly likely he would remember
what I had looked like. It was getting on for a fortnight ago
now, and he had only seen me for about five minutes.</p>

<p>Arriving at Scotland Yard, Inspector Stone disappeared,
leaving me in charge of his brother inspector, but he was only
gone a few minutes, and then, returning, we all three went into
a spacious and well-furnished room where a soldierly, good-looking
man of just beyond middle age was seated behind a large
desk. I wondered, instantly, where I had seen him before.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said politely, "I am Sir Hubert Brabazon,
the Commissioner of Police." He motioned me towards a chair
standing in front of the desk. "I have sent for you because I
want to ask you some questions." He smiled pleasantly. "I
understand you have said you are prepared to answer them, and
have come here quite willingly."</p>

<p>I smiled back. "Well, sir, I was told I had to come and so I
made the best of a bad job and said I should be very pleased to.
Yes, I am quite willing to answer anything you want me to."</p>

<p>He nodded his approval. "That's the proper way to take it and
you're not being under arrest and no charge having been made
against you, there is no need for me to give you the usual
cautionary warning about what you say." He shrugged his
shoulders. "Of course, if you decline to answer any of the
questions I am going to put to you, then I shall have
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I tell you, sir, I do want to answer," I broke in
quickly. "There is a great mistake somewhere and I want to clear
everything up. I have done nothing to be ashamed of."</p>

<p>"Good!" he commented. "Then if you have nothing to hide you
can answer freely and without any reserve. Now first, you are
Mr. Jason Brown and you work in an office in the city! Which
office and what's your work?"</p>

<p>"Messrs. Flavell and Hunt, Ariel Street, Lothbury," I
replied. "They are stockbrokers and I am one of their junior
clerks. I have worked there for four years."</p>

<p>He bent forward slightly towards me. "Now Inspector Stone has
told you we have reason to believe you are mixed up with the
disappearance of that bank-wallet. Certain information which has
reached us leads us to suspect you. Inspector Stone informs me,
however, that you declare your complete innocence."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I replied, "I know nothing about it."</p>

<p>He frowned. "But, of course, you have read all about it being
lost in the newspapers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," I exclaimed, "every line about it that I could get
hold of. I mean that I know nothing more about it than everyone
knows. I have no inside information." I smiled. "I have not got
it myself."</p>

<p>He looked very grave. "When did you go to Eastbourne?"</p>

<p>"On the Sunday, the day before it was lost," I replied.</p>

<p>"And you put up straightaway at this Coffee Hall." He looked
down at a paper upon his desk. "Benger's Coffee Hall I see it is
called."</p>

<p>I plunged resolutely into deep water. "No, I didn't put up
there until the next day. It was hot and sultry and I slept out
on the beach that night," I explained quickly. "You see I caught
the seven-thirty train from Victoria for Eastbourne that Sunday
evening, and it didn't get in until a quarter to eleven. I went
straightaway for a walk along the sea-front to get some fresh
air. At midnight I found myself right at the far end of the
promenade, towards Beachy Head, and seeing several lots of
people sleeping about under the cliffs, I thought I'd do the
same." I nodded. "I'm an old Territorial and a night under the
stars is nothing to me."</p>

<p>"And you went to the Coffee Hall the next morning?" asked the
Assistant Commissioner.</p>

<p>"No, the next evening, after tea."</p>

<p>He eyed me intently. "You had no luggage with you when you
arrived. What had you done with it?"</p>

<p>"All I had was in the pockets of my mackintosh; a comb and
small brush, a safety razor and tooth-brush, another collar, a
pair of bathing trunks and a spare pair of socks. I was
travelling very light because I had intended to go upon a
walking tour over the South Downs, finishing up at Brighton on
the Saturday."</p>

<p>"And what made you alter your decision and stay the whole
week in Eastbourne."</p>

<p>"The weather became very uncertain, and the Coffee Hall was
cheap and clean and the food good. I made up my mind to stay on
there until the weather became more settled."</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner spoke carelessly. "And how much
money had you on you when you put up at the Coffee Hall?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-seven pounds ten," I replied promptly, "besides some
loose change."</p>

<p>"And you left Eastbourne on the following Saturday
morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I took the train to Brighton and put up there at the
Regent Hotel. I left there the day before yesterday and came
straight home."</p>

<p>The next question was asked very slowly, and deliberately,
and the Commissioner's eyes were steely cold as he put it, "And
with how much money did you return home?"</p>

<p>I looked at him smilingly and replied equally as slowly,
"Nine hundred and thirty-two pounds and some odd shillings." I
tapped my body-belt. "I have it all upon me here."</p>

<p>A dead silence followed, a long deep silence, with the
Commissioner's face the picture of an amazement he made no
attempt to hide. His lips were parted, his eyes were staring and
he was frowning hard. I looked round at the two inspectors, and,
although I had told them when in my room at the boarding-house
that I had a large sum of money upon me, they looked equally as
astonished. I made my amusement quite plain. I went on
conversationally. "Yes, it's quite an interesting story. I had
been saving up months to have a plunge one day upon a great
favourite of mine, an aged gelding called Ashanti Gold. He is
not a very good horse, and all I know about him is what I have
read in the newspapers. But my grandfather, General Sir Jason
Brown, won his V.C. in the Ashanti War and that is what has made
me back him whenever he has run. I have lost quite a lot of
money on him, but when I saw he was entered in a sprint race at
Brighton, last Saturday, I thought my chance had come to get it
all back. He has only won twice before in the past two years,
but both times upon a downhill course, once at Epsom and the
second time at Brighton last Spring. So I had fifteen pounds on
him on Saturday and won seven hundred pounds in one hit, on him
alone. My luck held good, and in the next races I made another
two hundred and twenty pounds."</p>

<p>I stopped speaking on purpose to make the Chief Commissioner
say something and after a few moments he said very quietly,
"Show me this money, please."</p>

<p>Briskly pulling up my waistcoat and shirt, I dragged out the
money-belt and passed it over the desk. The belt was of stout
canvas with three long pockets. Without a word, he beckoned to
the two inspectors to approach close and proceeded to unbutton
the pockets.</p>

<p>"Fourteen fifty-pound notes, all in a sequence," I said in
business-like tones. "Seventeen ten-pound notes, eight fivers,
eighteen ones and eight halves. Nine hundred and twenty pounds
represents my winnings and the other twelve pounds what I
brought back of the twenty-seven pounds ten I arrived at
Eastbourne with." I spoke with enthusiasm. "Quite a nice little
fortune for a clerk who earns only four guineas a week!"</p>

<p>Another silence followed and then the Commissioner, looking
up from the heap of notes upon his desk asked sharply, "And, of
course, you can give us the name of the bookmaker from whom you
won this money."</p>

<p>"The bet on Ashanti Gold I had with Lew Hanner," I replied,
"and he'll remember it quite well, as when I went to collect he
told me it was the only good bet he had made on the horse. Lew
Hanner is well-known everywhere and he's on the 'phone in the
Strand as well as at his private house in Earl's Court. About
the other bets, I had them with several other bookmakers,
Hunkin, Billy White, Anderson, and a couple more whose names I
don't remember."</p>

<p>The Commissioner spoke dryly. "But your explanation of how
you come to be holding all this money here is no help to us in
finding out how you came to be in possession of your original
capital, the money you started betting with."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that," I exclaimed instantly, "but if you come to
learn I am spending money freely, it does not mean that you need
necessarily think I have stolen it." I spoke warmly. "You will
have no cause to imagine it is money I took from that lost
wallet."</p>

<p>The Commissioner went on another tack. "Did you go up to
Beachy Head any time during your stay in Eastbourne?"</p>

<p>"Every day except the Thursday," I nodded, "and I didn't go
then because it was raining."</p>

<p>"Did you go as far as the old Belle Toute lighthouse upon any
of these occasions?"</p>

<p>"Only on the Wednesday and then because I had seen a notice
in the <i>Eastbourne Chronicle</i> offering a hundred pounds
reward for the recovery of the bank-wallet which had been lost
on the Beachy Head-Birling Gap road. I thought I would try out
my luck."</p>

<p>"And find what a score of experienced searchers had already
failed to do?" suggested the Commissioner sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked sharply. "Everyone of that score would not
have gone over every place. Only one man would have gone over
the one particular part which had been given him to search and I
was reckoning one single pair of eyes might easily have missed
something. As for the searchers having been, as you put it,
'experienced,' would they have been any more experienced than
I?" I pressed home my point. "Surely only once in a man's
lifetime does he go tramping over the Downs to look for
something which has been lost, no one seemed to quite know
where."</p>

<p>Again the Commissioner altered his line of questioning. "When
you were at that Coffee Hall," he asked, "did you keep early
hours?"</p>

<p>"As a rule," I nodded. "I was generally in bed by eleven or
thereabouts."</p>

<p>"And that last night you were in Eastbourne, did you go to
bed early?" he asked.</p>

<p>I shook my head. "No, it was the only night I was really very
late. I went to the fishing part of the town and sat on the
beach watching the boats leave for the fishing grounds. It was
nearly one in the morning when I got home."</p>

<p>"Were you by yourself?" was the next question.</p>

<p>"Yes, as I was always by myself when in Eastbourne," I
replied. "That night I didn't speak to a soul."</p>

<p>For a few moments the Commissioner regarded me very
thoughtfully. Then, all suddenly, his whole expression changed,
the lines of his face hardened and he snapped his teeth together
as if, at last, he had come to some decision. He glared at me
with the utmost sternness.</p>

<p>"I am not satisfied with your story," he snapped. "It is
plausible and no doubt has been carefully thought out. But it is
not convincing and has not cleared the suspicions from my mind.
On the contrary it has strengthened them." He raised his
forefinger menacingly. "You tell us you left upon a holiday with
nearly twenty-eight pounds in your pocket, and yet you went to
lodge at a poor-class Coffee Hall where the charge is only two
shillings a night. With all that money at your disposal, you yet
started so ill-equipped for a walking tour that you had not even
provided yourself with a knapsack. Then you give a most
unsatisfactory account of how and where you passed that Sunday
night. You know we can't check up on it, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't help your not being able to check up on it," I broke
in hotly. "If you can't show I was anywhere else, then you must
accept what I state&mdash;as truth. As for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" ordered the Commissioner. "I'll return to that in a
minute." He went on, even more sternly than before. "Then that
last night you spent in Eastbourne&mdash;&mdash;" He paused a
long moment and almost hissed out his words. "Has it not struck
you that you are most unfortunate in being unable to produce any
corroboration as to where you were at a most vital moment of
that week?"</p>

<p>I kept a bold face. "Of course, it has! But it didn't strike
me until Inspector Stone here told me I was suspected of
stealing that wallet. Then I knew he thought I was a murderer as
well. I haven't been reading the newspapers for nothing." I
spoke with some irritation. "It isn't for me to prove I was not
somewhere on some particular night. It's for you to prove that I
was." I shook my head. "You have absolutely nothing against
me."</p>

<p>The Commissioner glanced significantly at the watch upon his
wrist in the manner of a man who has another appointment, or at
any rate was waiting for something or somebody. Then he looked
back at me and spoke very quietly. "And so you think, Mr.
Brown," he said slowly and emphasising every word distinctly,
"that the man in that bicycle shop in Tower Street, Brighton,
will not recognise you as, the purchaser of that second-hand
bicycle for four pounds." His voice was silky in its softness.
"Remember," he smiled grimly, "it was only the morning of last
Monday week."</p>

<p>I am sure I have never been so astounded in my life as I was
then. I was so astounded that my first reaction was only one of
intense curiosity. How had they managed to trace the bicycle so
soon? How, indeed, had they really managed to trace it at all?
Surely it could have only been that the address of the bicycle
shop had been stamped upon the tyre-repair outfit I had bought
as an extra and put in the tool-bag?</p>

<p>For the moment, I say, I was only astonished and I have been
sure ever since that it was that expression of astonishment upon
my face, unmingled with any trace of fear, which was my
salvation. I had not been knocked out by the stunning blow.</p>

<p>I stared back at the Commissioner and then, suddenly, a clap
of thunder seemed to burst upon my ears as I realised what his
statement meant. If the man in the bicycle shop could identify
me, then I should surely hang. His testimony would be damning,
and would show me to be a liar as to where I stated I had spent
that first Sunday night, then all my carefully built up story of
what had subsequently taken place would be contemptuously
rejected. Then was it worth while my continuing to keep up any
longer the pretence of perfect innocence? I set my face hard as
a flint to think.</p>

<p>Then I heard the sound of a door opening somewhere and turned
my head sharply to see if anyone else had entered the room. But
no, the door was still shut. Then, bringing my head back, my
eyes happened to fall upon Inspector Stone and I saw that he was
regarding me, not as I expected with the triumphant look of one
who had just scored a great success, but with the very anxious
one of a man who was in grave doubt about something. His face
was the picture of uncertainty, and worried uncertainty, too.
Very puzzled, I looked at Inspector Carter. He was undoubtedly
uneasy, too.</p>

<p>What was happening? I looked frowningly at the Commissioner
and saw that there was no confidence there, either.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Mr. Brown," said the latter, "it will make it
easier for yourself if you tell us the truth," and I sensed
there was cajolement and entreaty in his voice rather than
command.</p>

<p>Instantly it flashed into my mind that an attempt was being
made to trick me somehow. They wanted to bluff me into admitting
what they could not prove. Certainly, they had found out where
the bicycle had been bought but&mdash;had the man then said he
was prepared to identify me? At the time, he had not struck me
as possessing much intelligence, and, besides, he had been so
obviously short-sighted. He had been wearing very strongly
magnified glasses, and they had made his eyes look like those of
an owl.</p>

<p>I took heart again all at once.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Brown," went on the Commissioner speaking now
quite sharply, "let's have no more nonsense. It can't benefit
you in any way. Tell us the honest truth now."</p>

<p>"Sir," I replied coldly, "it does not seem honest truth which
you want. You are trying to fasten that robbery and murder upon
me and don't like what I have told you because it doesn't fit
in." I scoffed contemptuously. "All the men in all the shops in
Brighton will not be able to identify me as having bought a
bicycle from them, however much you may hope they will."</p>

<p>I saw his face had fallen, but he said grimly, "Well, we
shall have to see about that."</p>

<p>"Yes, and see about it at once," I retorted hotly. "If you
are dissatisfied as you say with my answers, I tell you straight
I am dissatisfied with your questions." My voice rose in anger.
"Do something straightaway. Either arrest me here and now, or
else confess honestly that you realise you have absolutely
nothing to justify your suspicions of me." I assumed a very
puzzled air. "How you came to suspect me at all and follow me
all the way to West Kensington, for the life of me, I can't
understand."</p>

<p>He appeared now to want to justify himself. "But can we think
them only coincidences, Mr. Brown," he asked very solemnly,
"that upon the particular nights we want so specifically to know
where you were&mdash;you cannot tell us?"</p>

<p>"But I have told you," I retorted instantly.</p>

<p>He nodded grimly. "Yes, you've told us, but what we want is
proof that what you have said is true. And that is what you
won't or can't give us. Think! Upon the only two occasions when
it is vital for you to produce proof&mdash;you cannot do it." He
spoke sarcastically. "Does not the same thing happening twice
seem more than a coincidence?"</p>

<p>"No, it doesn't," I replied sharply. "The most extraordinary
coincidences are often cropping up in the lives of every one of
us." I nodded triumphantly. "And I'll give you an example of a
coincidence which will startle you and prove what I say." I
spoke with the utmost emphasis I could. "When I came into this
room half an hour ago, I had no idea I'd ever seen you before.
But after a few minutes I began to think your face familiar,
although I couldn't understand how it could be. Now, however, I
remember everything. On Wednesday afternoon when I'd just come
off the Brighton Express at twelve-thirty and was outside
looking for a taxi, you drove up in one with a young lady who
had grey eyes and was wearing a grey dress and a small grey hat.
A porter took her suit-case and hat box, and I heard you tell
him you wanted the twelve forty-five Portsmouth train. I got in
that same taxi where the seat was still warm from where you had
been sitting." I grinned. "Now what do you say to that for a
coincidence?"</p>

<p>He made no reply and I rubbed it in. "Think of it! Of all the
millions of inhabitants of London, I ran up against you, you,
who were to put all these gruelling questions to me in less than
thirty-six hours! Why, it's almost incredible."</p>

<p>A long silence followed. The Commissioner was in a quandary
and he looked it. "Well," he announced curtly at last, "we shall
detain you for the present."</p>

<p>"But if it's going to be for long," I said boldly, "I know I
have the right to get legal help, so I'll want to telephone to
my employers to send me a lawyer."</p>

<p>He nodded. "That'll be all right."</p>

<p>"But what about my money?" I asked. "You're not going to keep
that!"</p>

<p>"For the present we are," he said, and Inspector Stone,
beckoning me to come with him, I was led from the room.</p>

<p>Somehow, I wasn't feeling at all depressed. That there was
some hitch somewhere I was quite certain, for they wouldn't all
three of them have looked so depressed when I had called their
bluff.</p>

<p>One day I was to learn exactly what had happened that morning
when I was being so sharply questioned. They had believed they
had a good case against me&mdash;in parts, but only in parts.
However, they had been quite confident they would be able to
make me fill in the missing portions myself. They had thought
that when I saw how much they had against me I should give in
and admit the rest. But they were quite aware that if I refused
to confess there were some very nasty snags for them to get
over.</p>

<p>To begin with, the red-faced manager of the bank was more
hopeless than ever as to what my appearance was like, and it was
the same with his companion. They now admitted frankly that they
would not be able to identify me, even if brought face to face.
All they were really certain of were my scorched face, my dark
glasses and my low-down pulled cap.</p>

<p>The second snag was, of course, as I have already mentioned,
that the man who had sold me the bicycle had died suddenly, and
they couldn't have been more at a dead end there. Added to those
difficulties, they had only the statement of the oily-looking
man that when he had burst into my room at the Coffee Hall that
morning I had been handling so thick a wad of notes that there
must have been at least a hundred of them there.</p>

<p>Well, I was detained at Scotland Yard, alone in a small
waiting-room, until about four o'clock that afternoon, expecting
every moment to be called out and lined up among a row of other
men, with the bank manager or the shop keeper or both of them,
trying to see if they could pick me out.</p>

<p>But nothing happened, and I was left monotonously by myself.
I was not, however, treated badly. I was given some magazines to
read, I was allowed to smoke and a good dinner brought in.</p>

<p>At last Inspector Stone appeared, bringing my money with him,
and to my great surprise, handing it to me with a smile. He told
me I was free to go away now, as they were quite satisfied and
did not want me any longer. He sat down and chatted pleasantly
while I put the belt on. He said, of course, it was all a
mistake but then Scotland Yard had always to act on information
received. When I asked him how it was they had come to know
anything about my having been in Eastbourne, he patted my
shoulder and replied, still with his pleasant smile, that that
was one of the things he was not allowed to tell. He said the
Yard never gave away anyone who had tried to help them.</p>

<p>Then he went on to say that he was afraid they would never
now get the man they wanted. He had had too much start and would
probably never be caught. Instead, he would be enjoying his
ill-gotten gains in peace and security and, perhaps, never do
another day's work in his life.</p>

<p>Yes, the inspector was very nice to me, indeed, so nice, that
when he had put me in a car to be driven back to West Kensington
and was waving me a smiling good-bye, I suddenly became
suspicious.</p>

<p>Was all this friendliness put on, were they still suspecting
me, and only just trying to lull me into an over-confidence so
that they could trip me up and catch me later on?</p>

<p>I felt amused and, at the same time, uneasy. They were
shrewd, clever men at Scotland Yard and knew what they were
about. I must be very careful.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; THE NARRATIVE CONCLUDED.</h2>

<p class="first">
DURING the course of the next three months many things
happened to me. I went in for high adventure, and taking
dreadful risks with the eight hundred pounds I had won at the
races, came out of everything well on the way to fortune.</p>

<p>There were hectic days upon the Stock Exchange then. One of
the periodical booms in rubber had set in, and those who threw
caution aside and plunged boldly made big money. I got in early
and was well into my stride before the public generally,
realised what was happening.</p>

<p>When I had finally made up my mind in what shares I would
invest I thought I would deal with our own firm, and shall never
forget the amazement upon the face of our senior partner, old
Flavell, when one morning I walked into his office, put down my
fourteen fifty-pound bank-notes and asked him to buy me seven
hundred pounds worth of Kuala Lumpur Consolidated on a
two-shilling cover. I told him I had had money left me.</p>

<p>"But you're mad," he exclaimed angrily. "You, getting only
four guineas a week, risking all that money. Why, it's
criminal."</p>

<p>"I've more to fall back upon if I lose that," I laughed, "and
I'm determined to have a good gamble."</p>

<p>"Then I won't help you," he said firmly. "We'll have nothing
to do with one of our employees losing so much money."</p>

<p>"But I shan't lose it, sir," I protested. "There is every
indication that the market is going up and up. Please do what I
ask you, sir. If not, it will only mean my going to another firm
and I shan't feel so confident, whoever they are."</p>

<p>He called in the other partner, Mr. Hunt, and for a few
moments his colleague stared at me open-mouthed. But Mr. Hunt
was more business-like than old Flavell and at once took a
sensible view of the matter. "Then we'll treat you as an
ordinary client, Mr. Brown," he said&mdash;I was greatly amused
at the 'Mr.,' as hitherto I had always been plain 'Brown,' and
that, often not too politely, either&mdash;"and not lose our
commission because we are naturally disinclined to see a young
fellow in our employ playing ducks and drakes with his
money."</p>

<p>"But it isn't playing ducks and drakes, sir," I remonstrated.
"The financial editor of <i>The Times</i> says this morning that
shares in all sound rubber companies should be a good
investment."</p>

<p>"Well, we shall see," nodded Mr. Hunt. "Now, at the present
prices of Kuala Lumpur Consolidated, round about fifteen
shillings, your seven hundred pounds should buy somewhere near
nine thousand shares, operating upon a two-shilling cover. I'll
see what I can do at once," and he smiled as if he were very
amused at the whole transaction.</p>

<p>Upon the ensuing settling day he smiled again, but no longer
in amusement when he had to hand me a cheque for more than two
thousand three hundred pounds. Kuala Lumpur had made a
spectacular jump to eighteen shillings and sixpence.</p>

<p>Then in the course of the next two months, I plunged again,
replunged and plunged for the fourth time, with each settling
day adding to my capital. In the end I possessed no less than
thirty-seven thousand pounds. I was minded to go on still
longer, and should probably have doubled the thirty-seven
thousand pounds if I had done, as I left off well before the
boom was at the crest of the wave.</p>

<p>There were days of frenzied speculation and huger fortunes
than mine were made by many, with a start of much less capital
even than I had had. Still, I never regretted giving up when I
did. The excitement and anxiety had been getting too much for
me.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, while I had been speculating so heavily I had
been remaining on where I was as the clerk at four guineas a
week. When, however, I received my last cheque running into more
than ten thousand pounds, I told the partners that, of course, I
should now be leaving them. Whereupon they suggested that if I
cared to buy in with them and become a junior partner, they were
quite agreeable. It appeared Mr. Flavell was intending to take
less active part in the business very shortly, and not only had
my enterprise in playing up my gains so boldly, taken their
fancy, but also they had been greatly impressed by my strength
of character (as they called it) in ceasing from further
speculating when I thought I had made enough.</p>

<p>I considered their offer for a few days and then accepted it.
So, three months almost to the day, from when I made my first
venture, the firm became 'Flavell, Hunt and Brown.' And all the
time I had heard nothing more from Scotland Yard, but although
that was so and the so-called 'Beachy Head Murder' was now never
mentioned in the newspapers, I was not, somehow, satisfied that
a watch was not being kept upon my movements. I had never
forgotten that sudden friendliness on the part of Inspector
Stone and how he had seemed to want to impress upon me that the
police had now very little hope of discovering the thief-murderer,
and that consequently the latter would be able to
enjoy all the money he had obtained by his crime.</p>

<p>I was arguing they were still holding a trap ready for me.
They thought that, in the first instance, I had only taken one
packet of notes to go on with and then hidden the wallet in some
secure place to where I should return when I wanted more money.
They reckoned they would catch me in the end, if only they had
patience and bided their time.</p>

<p>So I believed that no doubt I was being watched, particularly
on Saturdays and Sundays, because they would be sure I had not
dared to bring the wallet back with me to London, but had hidden
it somewhere near Eastbourne. Then it would be only at week-ends
that I should be free to go back for it. That they were still
upon my track was such an obsession with me, that for the time
being I resolved to do absolutely nothing in relation to the
wallet. I would not write to tell the bank where it was to be
found and I would not even return the one hundred pounds until
some months had passed by.</p>

<p>It came to me many times that I was acting very stupidly in
worrying myself so much, but one day I was to learn I had not
been very wide of the mark in my imaginings.</p>

<p>Directly I had become a partner in the firm, I began altering
my whole mode of life, and started to get some real enjoyment
out of my money.</p>

<p>I left the West Kensington boarding-house, and put up at a
private residential hotel in Fitzroy Square. Also, I bought a
motor-car and took to going away every fine week-end either into
the country or to some sea-side place. I knew I could not now be
followed so easily, and so one Saturday morning went down to
Brighton.</p>

<p>I felt quite sure that no one would be likely to recognise me
after all these months and, accordingly, made a detour in
entering the town and went up the street where I had bought that
four pounds bicycle. Then, to my astonishment, I saw there was
no longer any bicycle shop there. I knew I could not be
mistaken, for it had been right at the corner and now a grocery
and provision shop occupied the place where it had been. The
outside of the grocery shop, painted a bright scarlet colour,
was so fresh and clean-looking too, that it had obviously been
only recently established.</p>

<p>Very curious as to what had happened, during the afternoon I
strolled round the neighbourhood and went into a small public-house
in the same street. Presently the one bar-man and I were
alone in the bar, and I enquired casually if he happened to know
what had become of the bicycle shop that used to be at the
corner.</p>

<p>"Oh, old Bloxon died," he replied, "and no one took it on.
Died rather suddenly, inflammation of the lungs, I heard.
Working in his shop one week and dead as a door-nail the
next."</p>

<p>I steadied my voice with an effort. "I knew the old chap
slightly," I said. "When did he die?"</p>

<p>He considered. "Let me see, last August, I think. Yes, not
long after the Bank Holiday, a couple of weeks at most." He
lowered his voice significantly. "They say he'd done something
he shouldn't, although no one knew what it was. At any rate the
police were pretty busy at his shop the day after he died and
bothered his missus a lot."</p>

<p>I felt quite shaky as I walked back to my hotel. Whew, what a
narrow escape I'd had, and what a mighty part Chance plays in
all our lives! Strangely enough, I was to realise that more than
ever the following day.</p>

<p>The next morning, emboldened by the knowledge that now,
whatever happened, I could never be identified as the missing
cyclist, I thought I would just go and make sure the wallet was
still where I had left it. It was now getting on for four months
since I had hidden it and there was no possibility, I knew, that
I had been shadowed to Brighton by the police. There had not
been a taxi or another motor-car to be seen anywhere in Fitzroy
Square when I had driven away the previous day and so I could
not have been followed.</p>

<p>I proceeded along the so-well remembered road, but having
passed Seaford, did not turn off this time at East Dean, towards
Birling Gap. Instead, I drove straight on, intending, when I had
gone a mile or so farther, to park my car by the roadside and
saunter across to the shepherd's hut, less than half a mile
across the Down, as if I were bent only upon enjoying the
view.</p>

<p>I was not very far from the point where I intended to pull up
when I saw a man come out of a small farm-house on the same side
of the road as the shepherd's hut, holding two dogs in leash.
They were not above a hundred and fifty yards away and close
enough for me to see that the dogs were Alsatians and big ones
at that. They were straining hard at the leash and I made a
mental note that they were not particularly nice animals to be
about upon the Downs among so many flocks of sheep. Also, I was
disgusted that the man with the dogs had appeared, as I had
certainly no intention of approaching the hut when there was
anyone about to see me go in.</p>

<p>So, waiting until the man was hidden by a fold in the Downs,
I turned my car and went back to East Dean, determining to leave
my car there and walk to the hut on foot.</p>

<p>I parked my car in the yard of the village inn and in order
to give the man with the dogs time to get well out of the way,
went into the bar to have a drink. I was served by a stout
woman, who had been busy knitting when I came in.</p>

<p>She was inclined to be chatty, and for a minute or two we
discussed the weather and what little rain we had been having
lately. Then, just for something to talk about, I brought up the
two fine-looking Alsatians I had just passed upon the road.</p>

<p>"They may be fine animals," she commented sharply, "but they
are not the kind we want up here, and the farmers are very angry
about it."</p>

<p>"But doesn't the man who owns them live at that farm?" I
asked. "Isn't he a farmer?"</p>

<p>"A farmer!" she scoffed. "Not he or the man who lives with
him, either." She nodded significantly. "They look like
policemen to me."</p>

<p>My heart beat unpleasantly. "But what are they doing there?"
I asked.</p>

<p>She nodded again. "That's what a lot of us would like to
know," she said. "It's all a mystery. One week old Jevons was
farming there with a couple of hundred or so of sheep, and the
next he had gone&mdash;lock, stock and barrel&mdash;and no one
knew to where. He never said good-bye to a single soul."</p>

<p>"Do you think he'd been arrested?" I asked, and in spite of
myself I could hear my voice falter.</p>

<p>"Certainly not. The day before he went he came in here to buy
a bottle of whisky, and he was looking very pleased with
himself. No, everyone is sure he was handed a good sum to give
up his lease."</p>

<p>"But what did these men want the farm for?" I asked. "Are
they running sheep?"</p>

<p>"Not a single one. They don't want the land for anything. All
they're using is the house, and the first thing they did was to
put a telephone up there. A nice expense, that. Yes, everything
is very mysterious, for it was done so suddenly. Only a few days
before he left, Jevons started to rebuild that stone hut on the
hill. He took his cart and a lot of cement and stuff there and
was going to repair the walls. Then, as I tell you, he dropped
everything as if he'd been taken with a fit."</p>

<p>My heart was beating like a sledge-hammer. I wanted to close
my eyes and think. Surely I could guess what had happened. This
old sheep-man, Jevons, had found the wallet and given it up to
the police. Then they, certain that the thief was also the
murderer, had made all plans to catch him. They were sure he
would one day return for the rest of the money, even if it were
a matter of months. So, taking a long view of the matter, they
had bundled the sheep-man off with the greatest possible secrecy
and installed two watchers in his house. They had brought the
police dogs with them, in case they should be needed to run
their man down.</p>

<p>"And when did this all happen?" I asked huskily. "When did
the farmer go away?"</p>

<p>"Oh, months ago," the woman replied; "three or four, I should
say. Yes, I remember it was only a few days after that detective
was murdered in the chalk-pit." She nodded disgustedly. "And a
nice mess the police made of that business. My niece married a
policeman in Hammersmith and I've heard he's said they know who
the murderer is. They've actually had him in their hands but he
was too clever for them, and they couldn't get the evidence
against him they wanted. So he's walking about free, with all
that money he stole to spend."</p>

<p>I could not get away from East Dean too quickly. Oh, what an
escape I'd had! But for that man happening to come out with
dogs, just when I was passing, I might by now have had the
handcuffs on. I had no doubt my description was well known to
these men upon the farm.</p>

<p>Back in town again I breathed a quiet sigh of relief. Once I
had returned the hundred pounds to the bank I could put the
whole matter out of my mind and never allow myself to think
about it. Indeed, I was so anxious to finish with it and have no
more planning to do, that the following week I mailed the needed
number of notes to the Brighton Bank.</p>

<p>With gloved hands, so that by no mistake should I leave any
finger-marks, I did them up in a little brown-paper packet,
addressing it with single letters cut from a newspaper and
gummed on. It amused me to gum on at the back of the packet
'From a Friend.'</p>

<p>When I had dropped it into a pillar-box I was sure that at
last all my worries were over and I had made what restitution I
could. Almost at once, however, I found I was very much
mistaken, for I suddenly began to think of the man I had
killed.</p>

<p>I had not given him very much thought before, but now it came
to me uneasily that I owed some restitution there. Certainly, it
had been partly his own fault that he had come to such a
dreadful end, but there was no hiding the fact from myself that,
but for my stupidity, in first meddling with that wallet he
would almost certainly have been still alive.</p>

<p>Had he left any wife or children, I asked myself, and if so,
were they in need? If they were&mdash;I thought of my own
prosperity&mdash;how easily I could help them without any
deprivation at all.</p>

<p>I remembered his name, Matthew Brendon&mdash;should I ever
forget it?&mdash;and looking it up in the previous year's
Telephone Directory saw he had been living at number thirteen,
Trevor Road, Finsbury Park. So, that evening I went to look at
the house, wondering if anyone to do with him were still living
there.</p>

<p>I found the house was one of about twenty in a row, not of
poor class but of the apartment kind, and I was not at all
surprised to see a card in one of the ground-floor windows,
announcing there were rooms to let. I went into a newspaper and
tobacconist shop round the corner, and buying some cigarettes,
enquired of the man who sold them to me if he could recommend
any apartments close near. I mentioned I had seen a card up in
number thirteen Trevor Road, and asked him if it happened he
knew anything of the people there.</p>

<p>He was quite enthusiastic at once. Yes, he could certainly
recommend a Mrs. Brendon, at number thirteen. She was a widow
with one daughter, and a very nice lady. Poor creature, she had
recently met with a great misfortune, her husband having been
killed in an accident. Being left badly off, she had been trying
to let part of her house. Hitherto, however, she had not been
very fortunate with her tenants, as the few who had come to her
had only remained a few days. Still, he was sure that anybody
who went there would be made most comfortable. Both she and her
daughter were very superior people.</p>

<p>With no definite plan in my mind, I pressed upon the bell of
number thirteen, and my heart began to bump as I heard footsteps
approaching inside. I was about to stand face to face with the
woman whose husband's death lay at my door. I had killed the
bread-winner of the family and here was I approaching them now
as one, whom no doubt, they would be glad to shelter in their
home.</p>

<p>A pleasant-faced woman, approaching middle-age, opened the
door. She seemed quite flustered when she learnt what I had
called about. Yes, she had some very nice furnished rooms to
let, in fact the first floor was almost a self-contained
flat.</p>

<p>Proceeding to show me over, her voice shook as she explained
things to me. It seemed to me at once that she was desperately
anxious to obtain a let, indeed, I was to learn later that they
had been then almost at the end of their resources, not knowing
which way to turn for ready money.</p>

<p>"I am asking three guineas a week," she said nervously, she
hesitated, "but, of course, if you think that too much, perhaps
I might reduce it a little."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," I commented, "if I take them, they are well worth
that money and I shan't mind paying it."</p>

<p>"I am a good cook," she went on, "and I am sure you would be
comfortable here. There would only be my daughter and myself and
you would find it very quiet."</p>

<p>I really did not know what to do. I had come there without
the slightest intention of taking any rooms, being quite
satisfied where I was at the residential hotel, and now found
myself in a most uncomfortable position. I hated disappointing
the woman. She looked so intensely eager and was watching me
with such anxious eyes. How could I possibly say the rooms were
not quite what I wanted? How could I put her off without
disappointing her?</p>

<p>Then it came to me suddenly that the rooms were certainly
very nice and comfortable-looking. It might not be altogether a
bad thing for me to live here. I was alone in London and I might
like it to have someone taking an interest in me. Besides, by
coming to the rooms I should be helping the woman and her
daughter in a practical way, and getting to know them would
enable me to see how I could extend that help further, if
necessary. Poor women, what distress I had unwittingly brought
upon them. I made up my mind instantly.</p>

<p>I nodded smilingly to her. "All right, I'll take them," I
said. "I'll come for three months and see how we get on. Three
guineas a week and I'll move in on Saturday."</p>

<p>Oh, the thankfulness upon her face. It was so apparent that I
couldn't help seeing it. She got hot and flushed, and stammered
once again that she was sure I should be comfortable.</p>

<p>I took out my pocket-book. "Now, my name is Brown, Jason
Brown," I said, "and I'm connected with the Stock
Exchange&mdash;Flavell, Hunt and Brown, of Lothbury is our
firm&mdash;and, of course, I try to be business-like." I smiled.
"So to settle the matter, here's ten pounds on account," and I
handed her two five-pound notes.</p>

<p>She got redder than ever, and her thanks, which she tried to
make formal, were quite embarrassing. We chatted for a few
minutes and I came away with the impression that she was quite
an educated woman, and moreover, one of great refinement. I did
not see her daughter, but from the sound of movements in the
direction where I guessed the kitchen would be, the slight
rattle of crockery, I thought she must be in the house.</p>

<p>I arrived with my belongings on the Saturday afternoon, but
still saw nothing of the daughter. From what I remembered,
moreover, of the photograph of her father, which had appeared in
the newspaper after the discovery of his body, and from the
appearance of her mother, I was thinking she would probably be
rather a pretty girl.</p>

<p>In the evening I saw her, and I got something of a shock.</p>

<p>She came to tell me that my dinner was served, and on the
instant I got hot with annoyance and shame that I had, perhaps,
showed a little of my astonishment.</p>

<p>Imagine a girl, slightly on the small side, with a perfect
little figure, an oval face with a good profile and long-lashed
deep grey eyes. Add to these a beautifully shaped mouth with a
provoking dimple at the corner and you would say she must have
been pretty. So she was, a lovely girl in all the pride of her
young womanhood, except that covering almost the entire forehead
and extending a little way down the nose was a large disfiguring
port-wine stain of a horribly deep colour.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Brown," she said in a calm, melodious
voice, "your dinner is ready;" and I gulped down my astonishment
and thanked her with a smile.</p>

<p>She made way for me to precede her into my dining-room, and
then waited until I had sat down before she removed the cover of
a soup-tureen. "When you want me," she said, pointing to a small
bell upon the table, "will you please ring that?" and she left
the room.</p>

<p>"Good God!" I exclaimed when the door was shut, "what an
awful infliction for her. It makes her look almost
repulsive."</p>

<p>I shall never forget those first feelings of repugnance, and,
as I sipped my soup, I should have been literally aghast if
anyone had told me I had just seen the woman destined to be the
mother of my children. It must be understood the blemish was not
an ordinary one, but of such a hideous colour and stood out so
pronouncedly upon an otherwise attractive face, that the first
effect of seeing it was most unpleasant. No wonder, I thought,
if Mrs. Brendon's other tenants had been at all of a sensitive
nature, they had not wanted to stay long.</p>

<p>The dinner was excellent and beautifully served, and,
recovering a little from the shock of the girl's appearance, I
enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Late in the evening Mrs. Brendon came in to ask if she could
do anything more for me, and then went on to mention, as I had
been rather expecting she would do, her daughter's affliction.
She told me what a terrible trial it was to the girl and how it
had ruined all her life. She, Margaret, never went out except at
night and then heavily veiled. She had become the more and more
sensitive about her appearance as she had grown older, and would
not be brought to understand that people who saw her often soon
became accustomed to how she looked and thought no more about
it.</p>

<p>Of course, I knew that last remark was intended for me, and,
although I did not believe her, I agreed at once with what she
had said. However, soon settling down comfortably in my new
home, I came to realise that what she had said turned out to be
perfectly true. I did get accustomed to Margaret's appearance
and could soon greet her with a pleasure which was not in any
way put on.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly a very nice girl, she was very shy with me at
first, and did not want to have any conversation at all, but I
made myself chatty and very gradually drew her out. Her great
passion, she told me, was music&mdash;I thought it would have
been better if she had called it consolation. She said that the
piano was her favourite instrument. I told her that it was mine,
too, and I could play a little. When I asked her why it was I
had not heard her playing, she at once turned away her eyes and
said their piano was away, being repaired; but I guessed she was
fibbing and that they had had to sell it.</p>

<p>By then I had got a good idea as to how they were
circumstanced, mainly from little chats with the friendly
newsagent around the corner. He told me how pushed for money
they had been and how grateful Mrs. Brendon was for his having,
as they all imagined, sent me to them. He said my coming had
been their financial salvation.</p>

<p>I learnt a lot of their family history, too, from him. Mrs.
Brendon had known much better days, her husband at one time
having been quite well off. He had been a mining engineer by
profession and had had large interests in a mining company in
Russia, which had been left to him by his father.</p>

<p>Everything, however, had been lost in the revolution which
had broken out there in the World War.</p>

<p>He had fought in the war himself and attained the rank of
Major. The war over, and with only his gratuity to fall back
upon, he had been most unfortunate in everything he undertook.
He had been unable to get work in his own profession and had
gone into partnership with another man in a small manufacturing
business. The latter had absconded with all the available assets
and he had become penniless again.</p>

<p>Finally, he had taken up private inquiry work and had been
doing reasonably well until he had met with sudden
death&mdash;in an accident. Mrs. Brendon was the daughter of a
country doctor and Margaret was the only child she had had.</p>

<p>I felt a great compassion for these two poor bereaved women,
and, my conscience troubling me more than ever, in many ways
tried to make things easier for them. I ordered much larger
portions of meat and fish than I could eat myself, and made it a
standing rule that nothing was ever to appear twice at the
table. In the matter of chickens and game, too, I followed the
same course, in that way ensuring there would always be plenty
for them to eat. I was pretty well sure that the three guineas a
week I paid was all they had to live upon.</p>

<p>I could well afford any extravagance, for the firm was doing
remarkably well, and already, I was drawing a good steady income
from my junior partnership. About three months too after I had
come to Trevor Road I made a very lucky investment which, later,
was destined to enable me to retire from the City and live the
life of an independent gentleman in the country.</p>

<p>For a thousand pounds I bought a half share in a new form of
carburettor which a small inventor had patented. He had hawked
his invention round half London without receiving any
encouragement, until a young automobile engineer in whom I had
great faith had persuaded me that it possessed enormous
possibilities. I took an option on it and then paid a good fee
to have it reported upon. The report was most favourable,
indeed, it was enthusiastic, and in consequence I invested my
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>As the weeks passed on I became the more and more pleased
with my new home and the more friendly with both Margaret and
Mrs. Brendon. Ostensibly for my own convenience, I got in a
refrigerator, and had an electric heater installed in the
bathroom.</p>

<p>Then I announced I was buying a small grand piano, and it
gave me a great thrill of pleasure to see the delight in
Margaret's face when I told her that, of course, she was to use
it whenever she liked. The piano was one of the best which money
could buy, and I smiled to myself that anyone, who could play
only as well as I was able to, should have bought such an
expensive instrument. Still, although I was nothing of a player
myself, I could appreciate others who played well, and I was
most curious to find out what Margaret's playing was like. I was
certain she would play well, for she had most beautiful hands. I
had often regarded them covertly as she was waiting upon me at
meals. They were certainly, I was sure, the hands of an artist
or a musician.</p>

<p>Several times I asked her to let me hear her play, but she
always declined smilingly and with heightened colour, saying
that she did not dare, as an audience always made her
nervous.</p>

<p>One morning, however, returning unexpectedly to pick up some
papers I had forgotten, as I opened the front door with my
latch-key I heard the piano being played upon, and walked very
quietly up the stairs to listen. The door of the room was ajar
and I stood outside.</p>

<p>She was playing a soft nocturne, but just as I had taken up
my position she finished and started a new piece. I repressed a
shudder, for of all things she had chosen Chopin's 'Funeral
March.'</p>

<p>As I have said, I had thought she would be a good player, but
I never expected what I had heard then. She played divinely.
There was mastery and soul in every chord she struck, and the
imperishable beauty of Chopin's masterpiece hallowed round that
room like music from Heaven.</p>

<p>I peeped round the door. I knew her back would be turned
towards me and that I should be quite safe. Then, realising she
was so engrossed in her playing, I ventured to tiptoe into the
room and sink down into an arm-chair. Then for half an hour I
had a delightful treat. She was playing with no music before
her, and went from piece to piece with the ease and abandon of
long familiarity.</p>

<p>"Good heavens," I murmured, "how she must have suffered,
being deprived of her music!" and I felt a great lump come into
my throat.</p>

<p>She stopped playing suddenly and, rising to her feet, turned
round in a quick movement to face me. Her eyes were bright with
excitement and her cheeks were flushed. "I knew you were there,"
she said, and her lips quivered and her voice faltered. "I
didn't hear you come in but I saw you reflected in the polish of
the piano. Still, somehow I didn't want to stop playing. You had
been wanting so often to hear me and I know I had been
ungrateful in refusing." She smiled a nervous but pretty smile.
"Now, you've only to thank yourself for what I've inflicted on
you."</p>

<p>"Bless your heart!" I exclaimed. "You've given me the
greatest treat I've had for a long time." I spoke with
enthusiasm. "By Jove, you can play. You've the soul of a real
artist."</p>

<p>That night I brought home for her the whole operatic score of
'Lohengrin,' and her gratitude was quite pathetic. It
embarrassed me, and I was glad when she had left the room.</p>

<p>After that I often induced her to play for me. Sometimes her
mother came up with her into my room, but more often she came up
by herself. Mrs. Brendon, no doubt, was quite sure that no one
would want to flirt with a girl with such an awful blemish upon
her face. I, too, never gave the idea of flirtation a thought. I
liked Margaret's company because her playing delighted me, and
also because it pleased me to think that in showing my interest
in her I was doing something to brighten her life.</p>

<p>She had never spoken to me about the condition of her face,
and of course, I had never made reference to it. Moreover, when
talking to her I took good care to never let my eyes wander to
that dreadful stain. I always looked her straight in the face
and held her eyes with my own.</p>

<p>We were now on the best of terms, and she did many little
things for me that I would never have dreamed of allowing her to
do when I had first arrived at the house. She kept the papers in
my desk tidy for me, she pressed my clothes, and, when she knew
beforehand that I was dining out, she always had everything laid
out ready for me. She did the mending for me, too, and never in
all my batching days since my poor mother died had it been so
nicely done.</p>

<p>The repair of a badly torn driving-glove once was quite a
work of art and could not have been done better if by a glove
expert.</p>

<p>"A labour of love!" I remarked jokingly to myself, and then I
sighed to think that the poor girl would never have a lover. How
could anyone ever so forget that awful blemish upon her face as
to make love to her? No, it was destined she would never know
the greatest of all thrills in life. She would be maiden and
childless to the end of her days.</p>

<p>One Saturday in late spring when she was bringing up a
rather, for me, early lunch, I noticed she was looking pale, and
I said sternly, "See here, Margaret, your cheeks have got no
colour in them. It's sunlight you want. Those walks at night are
not enough for you." I hesitated just a moment. "Now, what about
coming out for a ride with me this afternoon? I have to go down
to Haslemere on business and the fresh air will do you good.
It's going to be a lovely afternoon and we'll have the hood
down."</p>

<p>Her eyes opened very wide and her cheeks reddened like fire.
"But I&mdash;I couldn't. I couldn't," she gasped.</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked. "You're not afraid of me, are you? I
won't bite you. You can leave your veil on if you want to, and
pull it up when we get out into the country. My business in
Haslemere will only take me a few minutes, and you needn't get
out of the car. Yes, you've got to come. Go and ask your mother
if she'll let me take you. Come back and tell me at once."</p>

<p>But it was a good ten minutes before she returned, and then
her voice was quite steady. "Mother says I may come," she said
demurely, "and she thinks it very kind of you."</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said quickly. "I hate driving by myself, and
any kindness done will be done to me. Now, I'll bring the car
round at two o'clock and you be ready as near then as you
can."</p>

<p>So at the time arranged it was a very dainty-looking young
woman who came tripping down the steps of number thirteen. I am
bad at describing women's dresses and all I can say is that she
looked smart, with everything in good taste. She had a scarf
covering part of her forehead, making the stain not nearly so
conspicuous.</p>

<p>As I had said it would be, it turned out to be a lovely
afternoon, and when we had got out of town the smell of the
countryside was delicious. The splendour of approaching summer
was in the air and something of the glory of everything must
have entered into our hearts. Margaret forgot her shyness and
was chatty and animated, and I put out of my mind all
recollection of the horrible port-wine stain and remembered only
that I had a girl of most charming disposition by my side.</p>

<p>My business with our client in Haslemere took me much longer
than I had expected, and it was past five o'clock before we
started upon our return journey home. Then, getting near town, I
suggested telephoning Mrs. Brendon that we should be dining out
and that she need not prepare anything for me. Margaret was very
much against the idea at first, but I told her I knew of a quiet
little restaurant in Soho, where we could be almost by ourselves
at the end of a long narrow room.</p>

<p>"And you must shake off this idea, young lady," I said
emphatically, "that you never intend to go about anywhere
because you are afraid people will look at you. What does it
matter if they do? It won't hurt you." I warmed up in my
enthusiasm. "Forget your little trouble, Margaret, and don't be
so sensitive about it. I know you've got courage, because of
that determined little chin of yours. Be brave, now."</p>

<p>And she was brave, the poor girl, as with a little choke in
her voice she agreed to come with me. I did not learn until
later, moreover, how much courage it needed on her part, for she
had allowed herself to be seen openly in no place of public
entertainment since she had been sixteen. She had not been to
any theatre, picture palace, concert or restaurant during the
last six years.</p>

<p>Now, I always flatter myself that that night I made the
ordeal much less trying than she thought it was going to be.
Arriving quite early at the restaurant, I was able to get the
very table I wanted, right at the end of the room, and she sat
with her back to all the other diners.</p>

<p>I ordered some champagne and insisted upon her having a
glass. Unaccustomed as she was to wine, it brightened her up at
once, and soon she was talking across the table to me as
animatedly as if we two were alone together in the room, and the
best and most intimate of friends. The food was good and there
could be no doubt about her enjoying herself. Her eyes sparkled
and her face was continually lightening up into smiles. I
thought, with great sadness, she would be really beautiful but
for that ugly disfiguring stain. We lingered over our meal so
long that it was half-past nine before I drove up to Trevor
Road. I was dropping her at the front door before taking my car
round to its usual garage.</p>

<p>When she had alighted from the car, she held out her hand and
I shook it for the first time.</p>

<p>"Thank you so very much for the beautiful time you've given
me," she said sweetly. "It was the most wonderful treat I've had
for years;" and I fancy she returned ever so slightly the gentle
squeeze I gave her hand.</p>

<p>I thought quite a lot about her that night, but it was only
compassion I was feeling for her. That ugly stain, I was sure,
would prevent any man from ever making love to her.</p>

<p>It seemed rather funny, and to me at all events just a little
bit awkward, when she brought in my breakfast the next morning,
with the animated companion of yesterday falling back into her
place again as the server-up of meals. Fortunately, we both had
a sense of humour and we smiled things off.</p>

<p>"Feeling all right this morning?" I asked. "None the worse
for the fresh air?"</p>

<p>"It did me a lot of good, and made me think I was quite young
again," she replied, "and I can still smell the heather of the
Hindhead Hills;" and I felt foolishly happy that I had given her
such pleasure.</p>

<p>The following week I invited her to come to the Opera with me
to hear 'Lohengrin.' I invited her mother as well, but the
latter said she would rather not come.</p>

<p>"I am not musical, like Margaret," she said. "She gets that
from her father," and then she added gratefully, "you are being
so very kind to Margaret, Mr. Brown, and if you do bring her
dreams which, of course, can always only remain dreams, with a
girl of her disfigured appearance, you are still doing her a
world of good. Before you came here it had begun to trouble me
she was falling into a melancholy which would end up in her
becoming a dreadful invalid."</p>

<p>Mrs. Brendon's remarks, for a moment or two, made me a little
uneasy. Surely, I thought, Margaret had more sense than to think
I should ever fall in love with her, and sense enough, too, not
to let herself be ever anything more than grateful to me. No, I
was not playing with fire and leading the girl on! She knew
everything was only just kindness on my part, and was quite
aware I took other girls out, as she had seen the flowers I had
brought home to give them. Yes, everything was quite all right,
I frowned. Trying to make her life happier and brighter was but
a small part of repayment of the debt I owed both to her and her
mother for the evil I had brought upon them. I had long since
come to the determination that while I lived they should never
want.</p>

<p>Upon the night of the Opera when Margaret came upstairs to
announce she was all ready to go with me, I felt quite delighted
with her appearance and frankly told her so.</p>

<p>Of course, by no possibility could she hide altogether the
dreadful stain, but she had now made it decidedly less
noticeable by fringing her hair quite low upon her forehead.
People would still stare at her. That was to be expected, but
they would probably not stare for so long.</p>

<p>"You look very nice," I said, "and just don't let it worry
you if people stare a bit." I nodded significantly. "I'm sure if
you had no birthmark at all they would stare much longer,
particularly the men," and I could tell by her blush that she
appreciated the compliment.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Opera House and walking down to our seats,
she seemed quite at her ease, showing, at all events, no outward
signs of any nervousness. Rather amused at my conceit, I was
flattering myself it was in part due to the fact that she had so
presentable an escort. I am by no means a bad-looking man, well
set-up and very healthy looking in appearance. So it would be
consoling her to think that the other women there must realise
that, at any rate, some man thought her nice enough to become
her escort.</p>

<p>Of course, she was thrilled with the rendering of the opera,
and so was I. Once, in one very beautiful part, I let our hands
touch on purpose, and whether she noticed it or not, she did not
draw hers away. I was very angry with myself about it
afterwards. It was exactly as if I were flirting with her.</p>

<p>Looking back in after days, I am sure that night marked an
epoch, although at the time it did not enter into my mind. At
any rate, from the very next morning I noticed some subtle
change in Margaret's attitude towards me. She no longer looked
at me when she spoke to me, and when I was speaking to her, she
took to averting her eyes. Also, she seemed to have become
nervous again, and always anxious to get out of my way.
Certainly, she was not unmindful of my comfort in any way.
Rather the opposite, for never had my clothes been better looked
after or little services for me more thoroughly done. But she
was different somehow. Her attitude towards me had changed, and
I was quite sure about it.</p>

<p>About a week later, I suggested she should come up and give
me some music after dinner, and, although she agreed, I noticed
she had hesitated for quite a few moments before doing so. Then,
later, she stopped playing much earlier than was her wont, and
had slipped from the room almost before I had realised she was
going. And it was the same, too, upon several subsequent
occasions when she played for me. She did it, but she did it
reluctantly, and seemed glad to get away.</p>

<p>This state of things went on for about a fortnight, and then
one night, thinking things over as I lay awake in bed, it came
to me in a blinding flash of realisation that I had been most
foolishly encouraging the girl, until she had become really fond
of me. Then, suddenly realising what her feelings were, she now
wanted to pull herself up before things went any further. Her
common sense, of course, told her it could only end in one way,
as no man would want to marry a girl with such a terrible
disfigurement as hers.</p>

<p>I took no pride at all that I was in the way of making a
conquest of her. Instead, I felt terribly mortified and grieved.
I ought to have had more sense than to make a fuss of her. I was
the only man friend she had ever had, and with her lack of
experience of the other sex, there was no triumph in that she
was becoming attached to me.</p>

<p>Of course, now the only thing for me to do was to go out of
her life as quickly as I decently could. I would leave their
house, but before doing so would send them, anonymously, a sum
of money which would place both her and her mother beyond the
reach of want for many years.</p>

<p>Still, I would do things gradually, I told myself. I must not
alter my whole mode of life all at once, and must give reasons
for any change in it that would seem quite natural to them.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the following two nights I dined out and did not
come home until very late, with the explanation that we were
very busy at the office. On the third night, however, I was home
as usual for dinner at seven and, to give no inkling of what was
in my mind, when Margaret was clearing away asked her if she
would come up later and give me a little music. She hesitated,
exactly as she had been so continually doing of late, but upon
my pleading that I had got a headache and that music would help
it pass off, she said at once she would be up at nine
o'clock.</p>

<p>So just before nine I got everything ready as usual, lighting
the two candles upon the piano and turning out the other lights.
We always did that, Margaret preferring to play with no glare
behind her and I loving the peace and rest of a partly darkened
room.</p>

<p>Margaret appeared to time and then, after she had been about
half an hour at the piano, when she began playing a soft little
piece from a book of miscellaneous music which I had recently
bought for her. I got up from the arm-chair in which I had been
lying back, and walked over to see what piece it was. It was new
to me, but of a most appealing melody. I saw it was a Hungarian
love-song.</p>

<p>I stood behind her while she played it through. It died away
so softly, that for a moment I hardly realised the last note had
been struck. Margaret dropped her hands into her lap and let her
head bow ever so slightly forward. Her attitude seemed unusual
to me, and without thinking what I did, I put my hand under her
chin and lifted it up until I could see her face. Her eyes were
filled with tears.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Margaret?" I asked. "What's upset you?"
but she made no reply and just shut her eyes. A tear fell on to
her cheek.</p>

<p>"You poor baby!" I said compassionately and then upon the
impulse of the moment, with my hand still under her chin, I
tilted it up still further and bending over her, kissed her
gently upon the lips.</p>

<p>Although I wasn't the least bit in love with her, the kiss
was very pleasant to me. Her lips were soft and warm and moist.
I kissed her again, this time not quite so softly and the kiss
was a longer one. "Now kiss me back," I whispered and, on the
instant, not only were her lips responsive but, flinging up her
arms around my neck she pulled me tightly to her. I lifted her
up fiercely and carried her over to the arm-chair in which I had
been sitting.</p>

<p>Then for a long minute our oblivion lasted, until, with a
little startled cry, she unloosed her arms in a quick movement
and made to push me from her.</p>

<p>"Oh, what have you done?" she whispered hoarsely. "You don't
mean anything by it."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't I?" I cried, stung to a dreadful feeling of
remorse by her distress. "I mean a great deal."</p>

<p>"But you'll never want to be my lover!" she exclaimed. "You
only kissed me out of pity." Her voice was broken in her misery.
"Who'd be the sweetheart of a girl with a face like mine?"</p>

<p>As in a flash of lightning I realised what the position was.
By her so passionate a return of my kisses I had drawn from her
an avowal of what her real feelings were, an avowal so
unmistakable that it would be degrading to my manhood for me to
pretend to ignore it and pass it by. I had made her fond of me,
and then, just in a careless moment of pity, had so acted that
she had been taken off her guard and had confessed that fondness
without shame.</p>

<p>I saw it all so plainly. I had been quite aware of my danger
and yet had deliberately walked into it with my eyes open. Now I
must prove myself to her to be either of a decidedly despicable
nature or else one of the best of men, which no doubt she had
been imagining me to be. I caught my breath. Ah, I was to bring
a wonderful happiness into her life or I was to add to the
sorrow I had already brought upon her and her mother!</p>

<p>I had only the fraction of a second to decide. Her kisses
were still warm upon my lips; I was still holding her supple
body in my arms and I could feel the wetness of her tears still
upon her cheek, so close to mine.</p>

<p>I crossed the Rubicon and, crossing it, crossed it manfully
and with the determination never to turn back.</p>

<p>There and then I asked her to marry me. I fibbed it was no
question of pity, but that I loved her sincerely with the love
that every man should have who asks a woman to join her life
with his.</p>

<p>At first, she would not believe me but I convinced her in the
end and when we parted for the night, it was in the small hours
of the morning. I felt a great happiness that at last I was
really doing something which was a sacrifice for me to do, in
atonement for the great wrong I had committed.</p>

<p>And I take it to my credit that from that time to this I have
never let her or her mother learn that in those early days I
thought I was making any sacrifice at all.</p>

<p>By the next morning, after only a few hours of very troubled
sleep, I had all my plans cut and dried, and subsequently
induced Margaret and her mother to agree with them.</p>

<p>We would be married almost at once, within a month, and
whilst we were away upon our honeymoon, Mrs. Brendon was to
arrange everything so that when we returned home we were all to
continue to live on in Trevor Road until I had chosen another
house, probably a little way out of London. Mrs. Brendon,
however, was to engage a maid to make the work much lighter.</p>

<p>So less than four weeks later I entered into my married life,
with the greatest respect for Margaret, but fully anticipating I
should always have to be playing a part. I never believed I
should have the slightest passion for her.</p>

<p>We were married early one morning in the first days of a
glorious September and, straight away from the very church door,
started upon our motoring honeymoon. We were intending to tour
round the beauty spots of Scotland. We reached York that evening
and hesitatingly suggesting to Margaret that we should put up at
the popular and generally crowded Minister Hotel, greatly to my
surprise she agreed at once.</p>

<p>"But there'll probably be a lot of people there, dear," I
said. "The tourist season is still not far off its height."</p>

<p>She smiled brightly. "I don't mind how many are there, my
husband," she replied. "Anyone can stare at me as hard as they
like," she nodded happily, "as long as I have you with me. No,
I'm never going to worry about people any more." She laid her
hand affectionately upon my arm. "When they look at my poor face
and then look at you they're sure to think that I must be a very
charming girl to have landed such a handsome and
distinguished-looking husband." She seemed amused. "So don't you
ever worry about my feelings. I promise you they are not going to
trouble me."</p>

<p>And sure enough she didn't seem to mind anything. When, that
night, we walked down the crowded dining-room to our seats, she
held her head high and was as bright as if she were the best-looking
woman there. In the days which followed too, it filled
me with a great tenderness when I saw how proud she was of being
a married woman. She flashed her wedding-ring upon every
occasion as if it were in truth the symbol of her deliverance
from the pre-nuptial slavery of her dreadful affliction.</p>

<p>Looking back, I think it was this courage I saw I had
inspired in her which, even in the course of our first wedded
days, began to arouse in me feelings of real love and passion
for her. Every action of hers showed how fond she was of me, but
there was always a restraint in her expressions of affection and
she never pushed them unduly. She always waited for some
manifestation upon my part, first.</p>

<p>In the beginning, my advances were a little forced, hard as I
tried to hide it, but very soon I found myself groping for her
in the night to make sure she was by me.</p>

<p>I had intended to be away only a fortnight, but I was finding
such happiness had come to me that I prolonged the honeymoon for
another week and, returning home, could hardly credit the change
in my feelings.</p>

<p>I had started away from the church upon my wedding morning
with really no love and, certainly, no passion for my wife and I
had returned&mdash;a devoted and passionate lover. The
appearance of that dreadful birth-mark no longer troubled me. I
didn't notice it when I looked at her.</p>

<p>We had been home a little over a month, when one afternoon it
was brought home to me most unpleasantly that I should never be
able to bury the past as deeply as I had fondly thought.</p>

<p>We were at a chrysanthemum show at the Botanical Gardens,
Margaret, her mother and I, when Mrs. Brendon exclaimed
suddenly, "Oh, I see an old friend of my husband over there! I
must introduce you to him. I met him last week and told him all
about Margaret's marriage." She laughed. "I told him so many
nice things too, about you, that he said he would like to meet
you." She whispered so that Margaret should not hear, "He
thought you must be a very fine man to be making my dear
Margaret so happy, in spite of that poor face of hers. Wait
here. Don't go away. I'll go and fetch him."</p>

<p>She disappeared among the crowd and I turned my thoughts
again to the flowers. In a minute or two, however, she came back
with a man, whom, to my consternation, I recognised as Inspector
Stone. "This is Mr. Brown," she said, and she added proudly,
"Margaret's husband." She turned to me. "This is Inspector
Stone, who was a great friend of Margaret's father."</p>

<p>The inspector glared at me with an annoyed frown. I do not
know who was the more astonished, he or I, but certainly it was
I who recovered first.</p>

<p>"How do you do, very pleased to meet you," I said, and I held
out my hand. He half hesitated and then took it reluctantly. He
turned to Mrs. Brendon and seemed about to say something to her,
but I gave him no chance.</p>

<p>"Let's go and have some tea," I went on, and taking hold of
Mrs. Brendon's arm I led her towards the Pavilion, leaving
Margaret to follow with Inspector Stone. I knew the inspector
would never dare to speak to Margaret about our former meeting,
but I was not nearly so sure he might not do so to her mother.
So I determined I would not leave them alone together for one
minute, if I could possibly help it.</p>

<p>The little tea-party was a great success. Certainly, the
amazement upon the inspector's face took quite a little time to
die down, and at first his attitude towards me was inclined to
be cold and distant. Then, perhaps because he saw how proud and
happy Margaret was, he seemed to begin to think better of it,
for his manner thawed and his big heavy face broke into a
pleasant smile.</p>

<p>"So you've been married two months, have you, Margaret?" he
asked. "Well, and how is your husband treating you?" and he
looked at me with a frown that was intended to be pretence, but
which I knew was very stern reality.</p>

<p>Margaret laid her hand upon my arm. "He's the best of
husbands, Mr. Stone," she replied, "and I'm the happiest woman
alive." She nodded smilingly. "With this poor face of mine I
never thought any man would ever fall in love with me"&mdash;her
eyes sparkled&mdash;"but one did."</p>

<p>The inspector's deep voice boomed. "Well let's hope he keeps
it up. Some of us married men soon begin to think we want a
change," but the twinkle in his eyes robbed his last statement
of all sting.</p>

<p>After that everything went brightly and, when the inspector
took out his watch and said he must be going no one was more
sorry than I, for he had shown himself to be a most entertaining
companion.</p>

<p>He said good-bye to Margaret and her mother and then, last,
to me. Then, when he had gone a few paces he stopped and,
turning round, beckoned to me. "One moment, Mr. Brown," he
called out, "I've got a little secret to tell you."</p>

<p>I went over to him and, linking his arm friendlily in mine,
he led me well out of ear-shot of the others and turned his back
to them, evidently so that they should not see the expression
upon his face. "Look here, my friend," he almost snarled, "I
don't know what your little game is, and how you've come to
marry that girl, but I tell you this"&mdash;his eyes were
menacing and hard as steel&mdash;"if ever I learn she's unhappy,
then I'll come and murder you on the quiet. I'll shoot you one
night with a pistol with a silencer on it. You make no mistake.
I'm quite capable of it."</p>

<p>My heart went out to him for his consideration of Margaret
and I said quickly and warmly, "And I shall deserve it, sir, and
will gladly take my punishment." I shook my head. "No, don't be
anxious about her. It's a real love-match and I'll see she's
happy." I added as an afterthought, "It must seem extraordinary
to you that she's married me, but believe it or not, it was
quite a coincidence that I met her."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," he said instantly. His face lost its
hard look. "Still you may be a better man than I took you for
once and have a bit of a conscience after all. You may never
have meant to kill her father, and I don't forget that you sent
back the hundred pounds to the bank."</p>

<p>"Steady, steady," I said sharply, "you're a good-intentioned
but a very obstinate man. You've been quite mistaken all along,
and you never had a shred of proof against me."</p>

<p>"No," he grunted, "that was the trouble. You were too clever
for us." He scoffed. "I'll believe you only when Margaret loses
that birth-mark she's got." He patted my arm smilingly. "Well,
good-bye, and be a good boy."</p>

<p>"What did Mr. Stone want to tell you?" asked Margaret when I
returned to them.</p>

<p>I pretended to look very mysterious. "Well, if you must
know," I said dropping my voice, "he said he would like to be
god-father to our first baby," and Margaret blushed
prettily.</p>

<p>I have not seen Inspector Stone again since that day, but he
sent me his kind regards when he happened to meet Margaret's
mother again a few weeks later. No doubt she had given him a
good report of me.</p>

<p>And now I come to another extraordinary happening in my life,
showing once again how extraordinary Chance can be and what a
great part it may play in our lives.</p>

<p>We had been married less than six months and one night were
dining out at a fashionable restaurant.</p>

<p>Margaret, as usual, was supremely unconscious about her
appearance and did not mind people staring at her, which of
course they always did, some rudely and persistently, but others
with only a fleeting and sympathetic glance.</p>

<p>We were half through our meal when I saw a distinguished-looking
man get up from a table close near us and proceed to
walk to the entrance door. I had noticed he had glanced several
times at Margaret, but had taken great care only to do so when
her eyes were not in his direction.</p>

<p>He had passed out of sight when a waiter came up to our table
and presented a small folded piece of paper on a salver.</p>

<p>"What's this?" I asked. "It's not for me."</p>

<p>"But it is, sir," said the waiter, "from that tall gentleman
who was sitting at the table by the pillar and who has just gone
out. He told me to give it to you directly he had gone."</p>

<p>Very curious, I picked up the piece of paper and unfolded it.
Upon it was written in pencil, "That birth-mark upon the young
lady's face could be removed, but there is only one man in the
world who can do it. He is Professor Lebrun of Geneva." There
was no signature to the note.</p>

<p>I read it through twice and then, rather amused, handed it
across the small table to Margaret. She read it with a slight
smile and shook her head. "No good. Father took me to Sir Donald
Stewart years ago and he said nothing could be done for it. It
would always be there and always be the same."</p>

<p>She dismissed the matter with a pretty shrug of her
shoulders, and we said no more about it that night, but it kept
on recurring to me in the succeeding days and I could not get it
altogether out of my mind.</p>

<p>Finally, I made enquiries from a medical friend about this
Swiss professor and was told he was a well-known specialist in
diseases of the skin and patients flocked to him from all parts
of the world for treatment. There and then I made up my mind I
would take Margaret to him, but before that would obtain an
opinion from the best man in London.</p>

<p>Accordingly one day we visited a great specialist in Wimpole
Street, but he shook his head at once and stated that he did not
think any treatment would be beneficial. I asked him what he
thought about Professor Lebrun and he was quite enthusiastic. "A
great man," he said, "but I don't think he would give you any
help either. Still you might consult him and, if you like, I'll
give you an introduction. I know him very well."</p>

<p>A fortnight later found us in the beautiful city of Geneva,
and interviewing the Swiss professor. He was of small size only
a little over five feet in height, but he struck me at once as a
man of dynamic energy. 'A pocket eagle' was how I described him
to myself. He spoke in staccato and imperfect English.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me, dear me," he exclaimed, "and ze pretty lady has
gone all zese years like zat. Twenty-two years you say she is.
Can I do anyzing? Let me see, let me see?" And for a solid hour
he examined Margaret under powerful glasses and many different
coloured lights. Then he sat silent for a long time, staring
hard at her with a very thoughtful expression upon his face.</p>

<p>At last he spoke and his face broke into a reassuring smile
with his first words. "Ye-es, I sink it can be cured. It vill
take two months and she must come into my hospital. No callers,
no visitors, just me, ze nurses, and ze ozer patients."</p>

<p>"Two months," I exclaimed, "but she will be very lonely," and
then I told him she was expecting a baby in the autumn, and such
a long time in hospital would be bad for her all by herself.</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all," he protested animatedly. "She vill
be gay as a vild bird." She smiled. "She is musical zis little
one. I can see it by her eyes and zose beautiful hands. Vell, I
have Schairn, ze greatest pianist in ze world at present in my
hospital and he vill be zere ze whole time she is. He play to ze
ozers every day and zey worship him. No, she vill not be lonely,
and I sink&mdash;&mdash;" he raised his eyes
impressively&mdash;"I sink I vill restore to you a very
beautiful voman in two months." He laughed merrily. "If all goes
vell, it vill be a new vife I shall bring to you."</p>

<p>We made up our minds quickly and so two days later I left
Switzerland by myself, a very lonely man with a great gap in my
life. We were to write to each other every third day, not more
often, so that our letters would be days of great expectancy to
both of us.</p>

<p>Those two months in London proved to be very exciting for me.
A great American corporation was negotiating for the patent of
the carburettor in which I had a half share, and every day
almost there were consultations with engineers and lawyers. My
partner in the patent was for selling at any price, provided it
was a good one, but by this time I knew we were on a good thing
and was strong for holding out until they agreed to pay one
hundred thousand pounds.</p>

<p>It seemed an enormous sum to ask, but they were very keen on
the carburettor, and that money would be a flea-bite compared
with their annual turn-over. Still, they hung fire and made out
sixty thousand pounds was their utmost limit. I tried a big
bluff and said the deal was off then, making as my last and
final proposal eighty thousand pounds.</p>

<p>We heard nothing from them for a fortnight and I was feeling
very despondent that my bluff had failed when over came a cable
closing with the offer.</p>

<p>The cable arrived the day before I was to start for Geneva to
fetch Margaret and following upon her letter, I was filled with
a great happiness. Margaret had not written that she had got rid
of the birth-mark but she had said it had been improving with
every week of treatment. Still, I read between the lines. She
was keeping back the best in order to surprise me.</p>

<p>How can I describe my meeting her? It was as if I were in a
dream that day, and in a way it is a dream to me still. I have
never quite got over it.</p>

<p>Arriving at the hospital, I saw the professor first. He was
all smiles. Yes, his treatment had been successful and it had
been quite a triumph for him, 'just a leetle one' he said
modestly. Still, by far the greatest pleasure to him about it
was that he was giving a very beautiful lady her proper position
in society. Oh, yes, it was possible I should hardly recognise
her, she was so changed.</p>

<p>Then, for a moment, when she came in and stood demurely
before me, I really was not certain it was she. She had
purposely had her hair done differently and was wearing, too, a
dress I had never seen.</p>

<p>Gone was the disfiguring stain and she stood before me, at a
few yards distant, a beautiful woman with a perfect, flawless
face.</p>

<p>She threw herself into my arms and burst into a flood of
tears. I heard the click of the closing door behind me. The
professor had left us alone.</p>

<p>Yes, the birth-mark had entirely vanished, leaving the skin
from where it had gone very little different from that of the
rest of her face. It was a little more ivory-looking and that
was all.</p>

<p>Grateful beyond any adequate expression, I asked the
professor what his fee was. "Two hundred guineas of your English
money," he replied. He smiled. "Viz any von else it vould be
five hundred"&mdash;he bowed gallantly&mdash;"but I have had ze
ozer money in ze pleasure I have had in vaiting upon your
beautiful lady," and, in parting, he gave Margaret a diamond
brooch, the buying of which must have made a big hole in the two
hundred guineas.</p>

<p>And now I am at the end of my story. I gave up my occupation
in the City and, buying a property here in Essex, settled down
as a gentleman farmer. That was more than eight years ago.
Margaret has presented me with three children and there are not
a more happily married couple, than are we, to be found
anywhere.</p>

<p>Why have I troubled to write all this down? I do not know.
Perhaps I have done it because Margaret and the children are
away and I was lonely and wanted something to occupy my mind. I
realise it is foolish to raise up the ghosts of the dead past,
but for a long time I have wanted to recall everything and get
the proper perspective of these extraordinary days. Having taken
that first step in wrong-doing was it by chance only that I was
saved from continuing upon my downward course? Shall I ever
know?</p>

<p>To-morrow I shall read right through this manuscript and make
up my mind what to do with it. I must be careful, for it would
be as deadly as a bomb if it fell into unfriendly hands.</p>

<p><br>
WELL, I have read it, and in ten minutes I shall consign it
to the flames. Everything I have written is true and I have
bared my soul to myself. One thing, moreover, amuses me.</p>

<p>I wrote in the beginning that primeval forces are strong in
every one of us and that I should like to murder a certain man.
Strangely enough, that very man has just rung me up asking me if
I will dine at his house the day after to-morrow. For political
reasons I have thought it expedient to accept and so, in a few
hours from now, I shall be sitting at his table, eating his food
and drinking his wine. That is the way of the world, deception
and hypocrisy running like a scarlet thread through all our
lives. How seldom do we dare to be our own true selves?</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; THE DEATH OF A SCOUNDREL.</h2>

<p class="first">
SIR ROGER HAKE, Member of Parliament for the Saffron Walden
Division of Essex was a self-made man and very proud of it. Of
humble origin, his father had been a coal-miner and his mother a
domestic servant; he had worked his way up from an errand-boy at
eight shillings a week when fourteen years of age to be, at
forty-five, the sole proprietor of a hundred and more shops
known from Glasgow to Penzance as Hake's Chain Stores.</p>

<p>A man of considerable wealth, it was his favourite saying
that he should be a happy one, too, because money would buy
everything. And certainly it seemed to be so in his case. He had
a town house in Berkeley Square, a large and historic estate,
which he had renamed Hake Court, near Saffron Walden, he owned
Wonder Boy, by far the best two-year-old in training, and, to
many people, above all he had married the lovely Mary Hellister,
more than twenty-five years his junior.</p>

<p>He was a fine, well-set-up man and undeniably handsome, in a
bold, coarse way. He had a big head, big fearless bull-like eyes
and big bushy eyebrows. In his strength and courage he was just
typical of that predatory Britisher of centuries ago, who had
wakened up half an hour before anybody else, and grabbed most of
those parts of the world which were worth having.</p>

<p>Of an over-bearing and masterful disposition and subject
occasionally to most violent outbursts of temper, he had bullied
his way to success, trampling over all who barred his way
without the slightest pity, conscience or remorse. He had known
what he wanted and he had generally managed to get it.</p>

<p>He had engaged the butler who was now with him, and whose
third year of service had nearly run to its end, in a way which
was all his own and betrayed the true Hake touch.</p>

<p>"'Ow much have you been gettin'?" he snarled at their first
interview. "Two pounds! Well, I'll give you seventy bob, but
mind"&mdash;and his fierce eyes glared&mdash;"I'm buying you for
that. Understand? What I tell you to do comes before everything,
and you're to see nothing and hear nothing that I don't want you
to. You're to keep your mouth shut like a trap. All right, then,
you can start straightaway." He nodded menacingly. "Now, don't
you forget what I've told you. I never tell anybody twice. You
keep your mouth shut. That's the main thing."</p>

<p>And certainly Huntley, the butler, a refined-looking man of
polished manners, had seen much during his stay with Sir Roger
about which it was so obviously expedient to know and say
nothing.</p>

<p>His master had a great fondness for a pretty face, no matter
in what walk it was to be found, and if its owner could be
tempted sufficiently then the face was bought. No woman,
however, reigned long in Sir Roger's life, one succeeding
another in quick succession. Apparently it was the acquisition
which so appealed to the knight, for once the victory was won or
purchased he soon tired. From time to time he had trouble, too,
with boy-friends, fathers, and even husbands, but the
all-conquering cheque-book generally seemed to have put things
right, quickly.</p>

<p>An unpleasant man, Sir Roger, with the weaknesses that so
often accompany great strength of character!</p>

<p>With a man of such temperament and inclination, as can be
easily imagined, Lady Hake did not have a very happy life. From
the very beginning it would never have been imagined by anyone
who knew her that her marriage to the knight had been the
outcome of any affection for him. Certainly, he himself, at the
moment, had been consumed with a most devouring passion for his
young bride, but there had been no love or passion on her side,
and he had just bought her as he had bought everything else he
wanted.</p>

<p>Her father, a hard-up captain on retired pay, had sold her
for the three hundred pounds annuity Sir Roger had settled on
him. It had been a callous and shameful transaction, on both the
parents' part, and Mary, a gentle, clinging girl, had not then
developed enough strength of character to refuse to be a party
to the transaction.</p>

<p>Of course she had, no doubt, been dazzled in a way by the
prospect of being Lady Hake, and very fond of her parents, had
been thankful that her father's debts would be paid and he and
her mother comfortably settled for life. So, after some
persuasion, she had allowed Sir Roger to slip the heavily
bediamonded ring upon her finger, and had resigned herself to
his ardent caresses.</p>

<p>The wedding had been celebrated with great pomp at St.
George's, Hanover Square, and she had had an expensive but
unhappy honeymoon in the South of France, to return home very
glad that the holiday was over, as the nervous chatelaine of
Hake Court and the ornate mansion in Berkeley Square.</p>

<p>As she had expected, her life was not a happy one. Apart from
having no love for her husband, she soon ceased to have even any
gratitude or respect for him. He had tired of her quickly, and
before a year had passed had lost most of his interest in her.
Her coldness infuriated him, and he started sneering at her
people, referring to her parents as paupers living upon his
charity. More than that, she knew&mdash;he hardly made any
secret of it&mdash;she was by no means the only woman in his
life now, and that most people were quite aware of it, too. So
she had begun to hate him and was always terrified she might one
day bear him a child, the heir, as he had put it in his
occasional jocular moments, to his 'spot of cash.'</p>

<p>So things were when, one evening towards the end of June, Sir
Roger was giving a small dinner-party, to be followed later by
some bridge. The knight was a great gambler and, lucky as well
as shrewd, he would sometimes boast that his winnings at cards
formed no small part of his income.</p>

<p>As a Member of Parliament, for political reasons he was
obliged to entertain lavishly, but this particular party was one
a little out of the ordinary, and where he knew he would be able
to play for high points. Apart from Lady Hake, there would be
only men present at the dinner and again, only those, too, who,
as Sir Roger grinned, could afford 'to drop a bit.'</p>

<p>All the invited guests, save one, had residences in his
constituency, but, although they were his staunch political
supporters, he did not care much for them. As a matter of fact,
they none of them cared much for him, either. Still, another
general election was shortly coming on and they were quite aware
he was about the only man who could retain the seat for their
party. Splashing a lot of money about upon charities and
institutions, and subscribing to everything he was asked to, he
was the ideal member for a proverbially shaky seat.</p>

<p>When, however, the guests took their seats at the dinner
table that evening, they were not all the ones he had originally
intended, for that very afternoon one of those he had invited
had 'phoned up to say he was not feeling well enough to come.
So, to fill the vacancy, to make up the required number for the
two tables of bridge, Sir Roger had had to rope in his private
secretary, Avon Harland, a young fellow of twenty-two and who
had only been with him for about six months. Sir Roger was very
annoyed at having to ask him to play because it was a rule of
life with him never to be over-friendly with those he employed.
Still, upon this occasion, he realised there was no help for
it.</p>

<p>"And see here, Harland," he explained frowningly, "we shall
be playing for much higher points than you can afford. So I'll
be responsible for both your winnings and your losings.
Understand, I'll hand over one hundred pounds to you and what
you lose won't cost you anything, and what you win you will pay
over to me."</p>

<p>From his expression, the secretary did not seem to like
altogether the arrangement, but good jobs were hard to get and
the salary of three hundred pounds a year would be difficult to
pick up anywhere else. So he acquiesced with a frown.</p>

<p>The guests arrived at the time appointed, half-past seven,
but the knight was by no means in the best of tempers during the
meal which followed, and accordingly vented his ill-humour upon
the weakest person present, his wife. He was cold and frowning
to her, and once made her blush with shame by remarking
generally upon the way everyone tried to sponge upon him because
he'd made a bit of money. He added sneeringly that he was now
expected to keep every one of 'his damned relations.' No one
commented upon this remark and the subject dropped. Everyone,
however, knew quite well that he was referring particularly to
his wife's parents, as the story of the marriage was well
known.</p>

<p>The meal over, Sir Roger conducted his guests to the library,
and they all took their seats for the bridge. It would be well
at this stage to enumerate who the six guests were.</p>

<p>Commander Vanraven was a typical naval man, bronzed and with
deep blue eyes. He had a merry, happy-looking face, but his firm
lips and square jaw would have warned anyone it would be
dangerous to play any tricks upon him. He was just over thirty
years of age.</p>

<p>Byles Chater was a well-known King's Counsel. In the early
'forties, his was the type of face so common to many great
advocates. Lean, clean-shaven and with large brooding eyes, his
mouth was wide and his lips were kept pressed tightly together.
Of decisive speech, he was cynical in his outlook upon life.</p>

<p>Dr. King-Harley was an eminent specialist in diseases of the
mind, and it was said laughingly that he regarded everyone as
more or less insane. His expression was thoughtful and rather
stern, but those who knew him best held him to be one of the
kindest and most sympathetic of men.</p>

<p>Then there was Hector Norton whose property adjoined Hake
Court, and whose herd of Jersey cows was one of the finest in
the land. He was the envy of all other breeders, generally
sweeping up, as he did, all the most valuable prizes, north,
south, east and west in all the English shires. He was said to
be making a fortune from the sales of his stud bulls.</p>

<p>The fifth of the players was Paxton-Smith, the newspaper
proprietor who had hacked his way to fortune with the same force
and energy as had done his host, but in a far nicer way and with
consideration for all he had had dealings with.</p>

<p>Last of them all was Martin Leeder, one of the best known of
the Newmarket trainers. He was a man of good reputation and
respected by all who knew him. It was said he had been most
fortunate a little while previously when one of his own horses
had won the City and Suburban handicap. He had backed it heavily
and at prices starting at fifty to one.</p>

<p>The play started, they were all keen players and the points
being shilling ones, an intense silence filled the room. The
night was hot and oppressive. All the curtains were drawn and
the windows were wide open. Two electric fans seemed to do
little to cool the air.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock there was a sharp shower of rain, but it
was too short to bring any cooling down with it. The play went
on for about half an hour and then came a most vivid flash of
lightning, followed almost instantaneously by a tremendous peal
of thunder, which seemed to rock the very foundations of the
house. All the lights went out and the room was plunged into
pitch darkness. The rain now poured down heavily.</p>

<p>"Keep your seats," called out Sir Roger. "The lights will
come on again in a few seconds. We often get this trick played
upon us here."</p>

<p>But a couple of minutes or so passing and the lights not
coming on, Sir Roger swore angrily. "Why the hell Huntley
doesn't come in with candles I don't know," he called out.
"Perhaps it's only one of our fuses which has gone. I've got an
electric torch in my study and I'll get it and see."</p>

<p>His study was the room adjoining the library and there was a
door in the library leading into it. He lit a match to enable
him to pick his way across the room, and disappeared. The others
sat on in the darkness with peal after peal of thunder
following. Some minutes went by and then, suddenly, the lights
went up again.</p>

<p><br>
AT two minutes after midnight the Saffron Walden police
station was rung up and the sergeant in charge galvanised into a
fierce excitement by the message the constable who had answered
the 'phone brought to him.</p>

<p>"God!" he exclaimed hoarsely. "What do you say? Sir Roger
Hake's been shot and it looks like murder!"</p>

<p>The constable jerked his thumb behind him. "Man at the other
end says so. He's still there."</p>

<p>Sergeant Houseman darted to the 'phone. "The sergeant here!
Repeat what you said&mdash;Oh, oh!&mdash;Who is speaking? Doctor
King-Harley!&mdash;Are you sure he's quite dead?&mdash;Where are
you speaking from?&mdash;And there's no sign of the party who
killed him?&mdash;Well, don't touch a single thing!&mdash;Leave
everything exactly as it is and don't let anyone leave the
house!&mdash;You understand?&mdash;All right, then!&mdash;We'll
be up as quickly as possible!"</p>

<p>Hake Court was nearly three miles out of Saffron Walden but
very soon two police cars had arrived at the lodge-gates,
bringing with them the Superintendent of the Saffron Walden
police, the police surgeon and police photographer and two
plain-clothes detectives. The lodge-keeper, a morose and
surly-looking man, was waiting just inside the drive, ready to
unlock the gates.</p>

<p>"How long have these gates been locked?" asked the
Superintendent sharply.</p>

<p>"Since about half-past nine," grunted the gate-keeper.
"They're always locked as soon as it begins to get dark."</p>

<p>"What for?" jerked out the Superintendent. "This is a new
idea, isn't it? I've not heard of it being done here
before."</p>

<p>"We've done it ever since we've had the dogs," said the man.
"The dogs are let loose at dusk and they go about the grounds
all night. There they are!"</p>

<p>Three huge dogs had loomed out of the darkness on to the
drive in front of the cars, and brought themselves to a
standstill. They looked savage creatures, with their big massive
jaws and big eyes.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed the police surgeon who was new to
the district. "What has he kept them for? They're Livonian
wolf-hounds, and as dangerous as hell."</p>

<p>"Only to those they don't know," said the lodge-keeper. "He
kept them because he was assaulted by two strangers, one night
in the grounds."</p>

<p>"It wasn't reported," commented the Superintendent sharply.
"We heard nothing about it."</p>

<p>"No," said the man, "Master dealt with them himself." He
nodded. "Master thought they had been punished enough. They had
to be helped to get back to their car."</p>

<p>"Drive on," said the Superintendent to his driver, and he
added in a frowning aside to the surgeon. "Sir Roger made a lot
of enemies. He was too fond of the other sex and thought he
could pick where he chose. He wasn't popular with everyone."</p>

<p>Arriving at the Court, the police-party were taken at once to
the study where the dead man was lying outstretched upon the
carpet. He was upon his side, with his head surrounded in a
little pool of congealed blood. There was a bullet-hole in the
right temple. The police surgeon said he would have died
instantaneously and that in his opinion death had taken place
just over an hour previously.</p>

<p>Dr. King-Harley, who alone of the card-players had
accompanied the police into the study, quickly put the
Superintendent in possession of all the salient facts as far as
they, the card-party, were concerned.</p>

<p>He said they had been playing uninterruptedly until, it was
computed, about half-past eleven. Then the lights had failed
suddenly, following upon a loud burst of thunder. Waiting a
couple of minutes or so to see if the lights would go up again
and nothing happening, Sir Roger had left the room, as he had
stated, to get his electric torch from his study and find out if
the fuse had gone in the hall.</p>

<p>That was the last any of his guests had seen of him alive.
The lights had gone up again in a few minutes and they had sat
chatting together, awaiting his return to resume the play. A
quarter of an hour or so had passed and then they had begun to
get impatient, particularly so Commander Vanraven who said he
had to be on the golf-course for some important match at nine
the next morning. At last the Commander had rung the bell and
the butler appearing, he had been asked if he knew where his
master was.</p>

<p>Shaking his head, the man had appeared most surprised and had
started at once to look for Sir Roger. Proceeding into the
study, the first place he had thought of, he had switched on the
lights and then shouted instantly for the others to come to him.
Running in, they had seen Sir Roger lying exactly as he was now,
prone upon the carpet and with his head in a pool of blood and
the bullet-wound in his forehead.</p>

<p>Dr. King-Harley continued that no weapon had been seen lying
about and no one had heard a cry or a report of any rifle or
pistol, but that could be understood in view of the noise of the
thunder-claps which had followed upon Sir Roger's departure. He,
the doctor, had gone up to Lady Hake and broken the news to her.
She had put on some clothes and was now waiting in the drawing-room.
She had not been allowed in to see the body.</p>

<p>The Superintendent was a man of quick decisions and, after
some whispered orders to his subordinates, a few words with Lady
Hake and a couple of minutes' conversation over the telephone,
he went into the library where the guests of the evening were
still waiting anxiously for permission to leave for their
homes.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he announced curtly, "but none of you can go
away to-night. I have communicated with Scotland Yard and
officers from there will arrive within a few hours to question
you all. Until then Lady Hake says she can provide you with
sleeping accommodation. But one thing first, please. Before you
leave this room I shall want to search you all."</p>

<p>From dismay at learning they were not going to be allowed to
return home, the expressions upon the faces of those present
turned to annoyance.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Commander Vanraven, voicing the opinions of
the others, "then do you think any of us had a hand in his
death?"</p>

<p>"I don't think anything," snapped the Superintendent. "It's
my business to deal only with facts," and he eyed them very
grimly, "and fact number one is that Sir Roger was shot by
someone inside the house. There is no doubt about that."</p>

<p>"Good God! man, have you no imagination?" scoffed Byles
Chater. "Isn't it almost certain he was shot by someone firing
through the open window?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," snapped the Superintendent. "The certainty is
in quite another direction. He was shot by someone standing well
inside the room." He smiled coldly. "I smelt cordite directly I
went in there. I happen to be a non-smoker and my sense of smell
is very keen."</p>

<p>"But couldn't whoever he was have leant over the windowsill
when he fired?" asked the gaunt K.C. sarcastically, almost as if
he were prompting a little child.</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't," retorted the Superintendent, "or he'd have
left his footmarks on the flower-bed under the window." He
smiled his cold smile again. "We police think of things, just
the same as you outside people do." He looked very stern. "No,
this killing was done either by one of you seven gentlemen here,
the butler, one of the eight maid-servants or by Lady Hake
herself."</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Byles Chater again, and with his face
in obvious distress now, "leave Lady Hake out of it, if you
please."</p>

<p>"I leave out nobody," said the Superintendent. "It's my job
to suspect everyone until the guilty party is found." He spoke
in most business-like tones. "Now, I'll first take all your
names and addresses, and then it will be pleasanter for everyone
if you make no fuss and let one of my men and me just give you a
quick once-over. Of course, I don't expect to find any of you
with a pistol on you now."</p>

<p>Shortly after, they were told they could go to bed and young
Harland showed them the rooms which had been assigned to them.
Late as it was then, however, they did not part at once, but
stayed talking until nearly another hour had passed.</p>

<p>It had been arranged they should be down for breakfast the
next morning at half-past eight, and anxious to get things over
and leave the Court as soon as possible, all were punctual to
the meal. The butler waited upon them and gave them all the
news. Certainly, some of it was very startling.</p>

<p>Directly it had become light Sir Roger's own pistol had been
seen lying in full view upon the lawn in front of the study
window and there was no doubt it was the weapon with which he
had been shot! The police had been watching in the Court all
night to make certain no one should leave! Two of the Big Four
of Scotland Yard, Inspectors Stone and Gilbert Larose, had just
arrived and were to take charge of the investigation! The
failure of the electric light had been general over the district
and had lasted exactly six minutes!</p>

<p>"And when do you think, Chater," asked Commander Vanraven
when the butler had left the room, "we shall be allowed to
go?"</p>

<p>The K.C. looked gloomy. "Certainly not before the afternoon,
and perhaps, not until the evening," he replied. "These two men
are very thorough. I've seen them in several cases."</p>

<p>There was a knock upon the door and a big, stout man, with a
pleasant smiling face entered the room. He closed the door
carefully behind him.</p>

<p>"Pardon my disturbing you, gentlemen," he said, "but I should
like to make myself known to you now you are all together. I am
Inspector Stone from Scotland Yard and, together with my
colleague, Inspector Larose, shall be shortly having a little
talk with all of you individually." He looked round, and his
glance lingered on the King's Counsel. "Good morning, Mr.
Chater," he smiled. "So the tables are going to be turned in a
few minutes, sir, and instead of you asking me questions, I
shall be questioning you."</p>

<p>"Quite all right, inspector?" smiled back Byles Chater. "I
shall be ready to help you all I can."</p>

<p>"That's the spirit," nodded Stone. His eyes took in everyone
there. "And I am sure all of you will be anxious to do the
same." He spoke very sternly. "You must understand, gentlemen,
that you are all under suspicion, very grave suspicion, for
already we are certain that the dreadful crime was committed by
someone inside the house. We have not the slightest doubt about
it."</p>

<p>"But even if that is the case, Inspector," asked Dr.
King-Harley, "how can you be so certain Sir Roger was killed by one
of us or one of the servants?"</p>

<p>"Or by Lady Hake or Mr. Harland," supplemented the inspector
solemnly. His tones were grave and heavy. "Because, sir, no one
left the house after the murder had been committed. There are no
strange footmarks anywhere on the sodden ground around the
house. Besides, those fierce dogs would have seen to it if any
stranger had been about in the grounds." He shook his head. "No,
I regret to say, gentlemen, that the murderer will be found
either among you six here, the secretary, the butler, Lady Hake
or the six maid-servants. Unhappily, there is no getting away
from it."</p>

<p>"Well, leave his widow out of it," scowled Commander
Vanraven. "She's only a child."</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed the inspector instantly, as he rose up to
go, "and so we're leaving her until the last, hoping it may not
be necessary to question her at all. We'll be taking the butler
first."</p>

<p>The enquiry was being held in the library, at the end away
from where the card-tables had been set out the previous
evening. Nothing in the room had been interfered with and it was
exactly as it had been when the card-players had left it to go
to bed. Superintendent Roberts and the inspectors sat behind a
small table, with Inspector Stone presiding. Gilbert Larose, the
international detective, was just then at the very height of his
reputation, it being only a few months before, as the husband of
Lady Ardane, he was to retire altogether from the Criminal
Investigation Department.</p>

<p>The butler came in looking rather nervous, but Inspector
Stone at once helped to put him at his ease.</p>

<p>"Look here, Huntley," he began, "if you didn't kill your
master, you've no need to worry at all. We're not very
formidable and all we want is to get at the truth. So all you've
got to do is to answer truthfully all the questions I am going
to put to you. Now, I understand you've been here nearly three
years. Was Sir Roger a good master to you?"</p>

<p>The butler evaded the question. "He paid me well, sir. I've
been getting seventy shillings a week."</p>

<p>Stone frowned. "Seventy shillings a week!" he exclaimed.
"That's a lot. Then you were more than an ordinary butler to
him!"</p>

<p>Huntley shook his head. "No, sir, I wasn't. My duties were
just the ordinary ones, but I was paid so well so that I should
be very careful to do nothing that would ever cause me to lose
my situation."</p>

<p>"Which means?" demanded Stone sharply.</p>

<p>Huntley coughed. "That I was never to talk about Sir Roger's
private affairs, sir. I was to keep my mouth shut, the master
ordered me. He said he was buying me."</p>

<p>Stone looked round at his colleague and then back at the
butler. "Hush-money!" he exclaimed. "Then what was going
on?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing sir! Nothing very important! Only, for one
thing, I was never to mention the visitors who called."</p>

<p>The stout inspector glared. "Visitors! Do you mean women
ones?"</p>

<p>Huntley nodded. "Yes, sir." He coughed again. "The master was
fond of the ladies and he knew quite a number of different ones.
He used to bring them home, particularly in Berkeley Square, for
champagne and sandwiches quite late at night."</p>

<p>"Did her ladyship know?" snapped Stone.</p>

<p>The butler spoke quickly. "I hope not, sir, but I can't say.
Her ladyship is very quiet and retires early and both the Court
here and number seven Berkeley Square are very large houses.
What goes on in one part is not necessarily known in
another."</p>

<p>"Who were these women?" asked Stone. "Tell us their
names."</p>

<p>"I don't know them, sir. The ones who came at night I often
didn't even see. I only heard them laughing, and smelt the
perfume they had on them, after they had gone."</p>

<p>"But didn't Sir Roger send you off to bed when he had these
visitors? He wouldn't have wanted you about."</p>

<p>"But he did, sir. I was never allowed to go to bed until
after he had gone, however late it was. You see, sir, Master was
very peculiar in some ways. For one thing he was very afraid of
fire, because I've heard tell some fortune-teller once told him
he'd one day be burnt to death. So he was terribly afraid that
when he was lively&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When he was drunk, you mean?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"No, sir, he was never drunk. But when he'd had plenty he
became careless and would then throw matches about, or leave the
fire dangerous or the geyser still alight in the bathroom. So, I
had to be always about."</p>

<p>Stone considered. "But you haven't answered my first question
yet. Was he a good master?"</p>

<p>The butler hesitated, as if he were unwilling but not unable
to answer the question. Then he took the plunge boldly and
emphatically, with obvious bitterness in his tones. "No, sir, he
was not. His temper was very uncertain and he mostly spoke to me
as if he were speaking to a dog. He was not a pleasant gentleman
to work for."</p>

<p>Stone lifted his eyebrows. "And yet you've remained with him
for three years."</p>

<p>The butler gave a wan smile. "With the seventy shillings a
week, sir. That's what kept me here." He nodded. "Besides,
sometimes the tips are good. The gentlemen at the parties are
often generous."</p>

<p>Larose interjected a question here. "Then you are not sorry
he's dead?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I am, sir! I mayn't get such a good place again.
Except for the late hours, the work is light. I have two
parlourmaids under me."</p>

<p>Stone looked down at the paper upon the table. "Well, now
coming to last night. Give us your version of everything."</p>

<p>"I have not much to tell you, sir, beyond what you already
know. It was Master's invariable rule that I should never come
into any room where he was unless I was sent for, so I was
sitting where I always sit at night when there is any company
here, in that little room just off the hall and near the front
door, when the library bell rang. I was reading a newspaper, and
happening to glance at the clock as I got up, I saw it was about
three minutes to twelve. I went into the library where all the
gentlemen were and Mr. Chater asked me if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment," interrupted Stone, "we're getting on too
quickly. Where were you when the lights failed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in the same place, in that little room, sir, and it was
most unfortunate as I found I had got no matches on me. So, I
had to feel my way into the kitchen and then I couldn't lay my
hands upon a box, anywhere. I was in a great flurry, expecting
to hear Master shouting for me any moment. I was upset, too,
because I don't like thunderstorms as I am always so afraid the
house may be struck. There are iron deposits in the earth not
very far from here and with that and the big trees surrounding
the Court I am always expecting&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind about the trees," interrupted Stone testily. "We
want to know where you were all that time when the house was in
darkness."</p>

<p>The butler had a pained expression upon his face. "I was
telling you, sir. I was looking for some matches and I couldn't
find any anywhere. I tried the kitchen, the scullery and my
pantry, feeling about all the time because the whole house was
inky black and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But hadn't you got a torch?" snapped Stone.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and I crawled up to my bedroom to get it, but
things were most unfortunate there, too. Emma, one of the
housemaids, had turned out my room that morning, and she had not
put back the torch where I usually keep it. It took me a long
while to grope for it and then, just as I found it, the lights
went up again."</p>

<p>"How do you know they went up just then?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"Because from the window of my room, sir, I suddenly saw two
broad beams of light shine up over the lawn. They were from the
library windows."</p>

<p>"And you mean to tell us," asked Stone, "that the whole of
the time the house was in darkness, exactly six minutes we are
told, you were looking for matches or your torch."</p>

<p>The butler's reply was very firm. "Yes, sir, I was. The time,
too, seemed longer than six minutes to me. I should have said it
was nearer ten."</p>

<p>"And you never went near the library when the lights did go
up?" asked Stone incredulously. "Why was that?"</p>

<p>"Master was a hasty man, sir, and he might have been furious
with me. I was glad he was having time to calm down."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Stone. "You had come to where Mr. Chater asked
you where Sir Roger was."</p>

<p>"I told him I didn't know but would go and look and I crossed
the library to go into Master's study, as the first place where
I thought he might be."</p>

<p>"Was the door between the two rooms shut?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, but it was pushed close to. The room was in
darkness, and I felt for the switch and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But good heavens, man," broke in Stone impatiently, "if you
found the room all dark why should you have imagined your master
would be there?" He spoke very sternly. "Come, come, that wants
some explanation."</p>

<p>The butler looked him unflinchingly in the face. "Sir," he
said slowly, "Lord Leighton, my master before Sir Roger, and I
was with him eight years, died suddenly in an apoplectic fit. He
was just such a man as Sir Roger, ruddy-faced and in perfect
health up to the very minute of his death. I found him dead in
his armchair one evening, hot and sultry such as was last
night." The man spoke very solemnly. "That is why, sir, I looked
for my master in the unlighted room. I was always thinking he
might die one day in a fit of temper."</p>

<p>Stone altered his line of questioning. "Now about this pistol
he was shot with. You knew he'd got it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, everyone did. It was kept openly in one of the
pigeon-holes of his desk."</p>

<p>"How long's he had it?"</p>

<p>"Since last April, sir, after two men had attacked him one
night in the grounds. He beat them off but he bought the pistol
the next day. No, sir, we none of us know who the men were. We
all think it was a private quarrel and I, myself, believe it had
to do with a lady, because when he came indoors after the fight
I heard him mutter something about a little trollop. He often
muttered to himself when he was very put out."</p>

<p>Stone frowned thoughtfully. "Now about these gentlemen at the
card-party. You know them all? They have been here often before?
They were real friends of his?"</p>

<p>The butler hesitated. "Well, sir, speaking frankly now he's
dead, I don't think he had any real friends. He wasn't a man
whom most people liked. Still, it suited many to keep in with
him either for political or business reasons. For instance, Mr.
Chater's brother was his solicitor and must have had hundreds of
pounds out of him in the course of the year. Then Mr. Martin
Leeder trained his horses for him, and Mr. Paxton-Smith and
Commander Vanraven supported him politically, to keep the
Saffron Walden seat for the Conservative Party. Mr. Norton kept
in with him because he got a bit of help from him for the
Saffron Walden Hospital where Mr. Norton is the chairman of the
Board of Management. So you see it was like that; they had an
axe to grind by keeping friendly with him."</p>

<p>"But whom of the lot would you say he knew best?"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps Mr. Norton," replied the butler. "His estate
adjoins ours and is less than a mile away." He smiled. "Mrs.
Norton is a very beautiful lady, and Sir Roger has been greatly
taken with her. They're both great rose-growers and the master
has often been over lately to look at her flowers." His smile
broadened. "Of course, people have been talking, but I should
think Mrs. Norton could take care of herself."</p>

<p>"Now another thing, Huntley," said Stone. "With all this
unfaithfulness on his part, upon what terms was Sir Roger with
his wife?"</p>

<p>The butler hesitated. "Well," he said slowly, "I don't think
he ever struck her, but short of that he wasn't a good
husband."</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed Stone. "Then did they quarrel?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Huntley quickly, "her ladyship's not a
quarrelling sort. I mean he wasn't kind to her. Like me, she got
all his bad temper. Even if he wasn't in a bad temper, he often
didn't take any notice of her for days on end together. Then,
some nights after dinner he'd talk to her quite a lot,
especially after he'd had champagne. It was a week of neglect
and then, perhaps, a day or a couple of days of being kind to
her."</p>

<p>"Did they occupy separate bedrooms?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he started that a few months after they had been
married. He'd soon taken to being away quite a lot. He said it
was on business."</p>

<p>"But you don't think it always was?" queried Stone.</p>

<p>The butler shrugged his shoulders. "Well, it included a lot
of week-ends, anyhow."</p>

<p>Stone frowned. "And her ladyship, did she have many
visitors?"</p>

<p>"No, her own people were never invited to the house and she
spent her time mostly with her painting. She's a very quiet and
gentle lady."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then Stone said sharply, "Well,
Huntley, you're an intelligent man, and so in your own mind, you
must have formed some opinion as to who killed your master.
Whatever you say will be treated with confidence." He regarded
him intently. "Now who do you think fired that shot?"</p>

<p>The butler shook his head. "I can think of no one, sir. I
know I didn't do it, Mistress is incapable of it and certainly
no one among the gentlemen could have done it without the others
knowing." He nodded. "If it were possible I should have said he
shot himself accidentally. He was very careless about the
safety-catch of that pistol and several times I've found it
raised. Once he even passed it over to me to clean, with the
catch up and the magazine half loaded. When I pointed it out to
him, he told me I was a fussing fool."</p>

<p>Inspector Larose now took his turn at the questioning. "I'd
like to put something to you, Mr. Huntley," he said most
politely. "Now I've just had a look round the rooms on the
ground-floor here and I notice there is a mixture of the old and
new. For instance, in the kitchen you have a modern electric
cooker and yet a very ancient looking kitchen range with that
big hook hanging down in front. Surely you don't ever use the
old-fashioned turning-spit?"</p>

<p>"But we do," nodded the butler. "Master had all the joints
cooked that way to keep in the flavour of the meat."</p>

<p>"Very wasteful in the way of coal, wasn't it?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>"In both coal and coke," agreed Huntley. "To roast with the
spit required a big fire and it made the kitchen unpleasantly
hot in warm weather."</p>

<p>"And you had a joint roasted last night, of course," queried
Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, saddle of mutton, sir. A large one!"</p>

<p>"And dinner started what time?"</p>

<p>"A quarter to eight. We always have it at that time."</p>

<p>"And that being so, Mr. Huntley," went on Larose, and he
spoke much more sharply now, "with the large fire which you say
was always necessary for roasting when the spit was used,
wouldn't some of its embers have been still alight when, as you
tell us, you groped your way into the kitchen to feel for
matches? Wouldn't the kitchen have not been completely dark and
couldn't you, at any rate, have lit a piece of paper at the
fire?" His voice rose. "Answer me quickly, please."</p>

<p>But the butler did not answer quickly. His face went a dusky
red and he took quite an appreciable time before he replied
huskily. "It was quite dark, sir, as I have told you, and there
wasn't even a glimmer of light." He spoke reproachfully. "Do you
think I would lie to you, sir?"</p>

<p>Larose was all politeness again. "Not necessarily," he said.
He smiled. "I was only curious. That's all."</p>

<p>Stone asked a few more questions and then the butler was
dismissed, with the intimation that he was to ask Mr. Harland to
come in when he heard the bell ring, which would be in a minute
or two.</p>

<p>Then Stone turned to the others. "Well, what do you think of
him?" he asked. "What's the verdict?"</p>

<p>"He was lieing about looking so long for those matches,"
replied Larose, "and you see when we come to question the cook
we shall find out he's been prompting her what to say."</p>

<p>"Then should we have the cook in at once, before he's had the
opportunity to speak to her?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "It wouldn't help us. It wouldn't
clear up what he'd really been doing. No, let him warn the cook.
It will confirm our suspicions of him." He nodded. "It is quite
possible he shot his master, but we shall have great difficulty
in proving it. He is a clever man."</p>

<p>"One thing," commented Stone. "It's quite plain he hated his
master and there may turn out to be a much deeper reason than
for the way he says he was always treated by him."</p>

<p>Avon Harland, the youthful-looking secretary, came in looking
very calm and collected. Well below medium height, he was on the
small side and of slight physique, but he was decidedly good
looking, with an aristocratic and refined appearance. He held
himself erect.</p>

<p>He said he had been Sir Roger's secretary for nearly six
months. He did not complain of him as an employer, although his
manner was by nature a very discourteous one. They had not been
in any way friends, their relations being strictly business
ones. He had his own two rooms and an office at the Court, and
was Sir Roger's agent as well as secretary. Sir Roger owned
considerable property in the neighbourhood, and there were
always a lot of things to look after. He had occasionally had
lunch with Sir Roger, but then it had only been when the latter
had been pressed for time and wanted to discuss business with
him. The previous night was the first time upon which he had had
dinner with him, and he had only been present then because one
of the invited guests having defaulted at the last moment, he
had been roped in to make up the eight players at bridge.</p>

<p>He then gave his version of the happenings in the card-room,
which tallied exactly with that given by Dr. King-Harley to the
Superintendent of the Saffron Walden police. Stone asked him to
indicate which chair he had been occupying when the lights went
out and he told him. It was the one nearest to the door leading
out into the lounge hall and farthest away from that leading
into the dead man's study.</p>

<p>"And are the card-tables and chairs exactly as they were last
night when you were playing?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>Harland regarded them carefully and nodded. "Yes, and the
packs of cards are exactly as they were then, too," he said. "I
was just about to deal."</p>

<p>Stone spoke in brisk and business-like tones. "Well, Mr.
Harland, as I have told the others, unhappily there cannot be
the slightest doubt Sir Roger met his death at the hands of
someone inside this house, and I am sure you must share that
opinion, too." He raised his hand to emphasize the seriousness
of his question. "Now can you swear none of you gentlemen left
this room when it was in darkness last night?"</p>

<p>"We are all positive of it," replied Harland firmly. "We were
all in our proper places at the card-tables when the lights came
on again, all in the same places we had been occupying before
they went out."</p>

<p>"But one of you might have been out and come back," suggested
Stone.</p>

<p>"How could he have done it?" asked Harland sharply. "Even if
he had managed to slip away unnoticed, in the darkness, which I
doubt, how on earth could he have crawled back and found his own
chair again without disturbing anyone? Remember it was black as
ink here."</p>

<p>"And, of course, you all talked together as you sat in the
darkness?" was Stone's next question.</p>

<p>"Certainly, we did, and, discussing things afterwards, we are
sure that everyone of us joined in the conversation."</p>

<p>"And I take it," went on Stone, "that everything had been
just ordinary and uneventful at the card-tables until the lights
went out. I mean there had been no quarrel or dispute of any
kind about the play."</p>

<p>Harland shook his head. "None whatever. Everything was just
as ordinary and quiet as it could be."</p>

<p>"You all came into the room, you played those hands of bridge
and none of you left the room?" Harland nodded and Stone went
on, "And about the other players, had you met them all
before?"</p>

<p>"No, only one of them, Mr. Norton, and I had become
acquainted with him because of some business connected with the
estate."</p>

<p>"Then you have formed no opinion of their characters?"</p>

<p>Harland smiled. "Not sufficiently to determine whether any
among them would be a murderer."</p>

<p>Stone spoke sharply. "Now, I won't beat about the bush, Mr.
Harland, but having been associated for six months with Sir
Roger you must have formed some idea as to what his character
was. Of course, you have! Well, whatever his business abilities,
he wasn't a nice man in private, was he? To put it plainly, he
didn't make a good husband for a young girl like Lady Hake, now
did he?"</p>

<p>Harland's face hardened. "No, it is common property he did
not."</p>

<p>"And you can no doubt supplement what the public know by what
you have yourself observed in private since you came here."</p>

<p>Harland was silent, and Stone went on persuasively, "Come,
come, Mr. Harland, you had better tell us. We are bound to learn
all about it in the end, but we shall be better able to
determine its value coming from you, an educated man, than from
the tittle-tattle of the servants. Now Sir Roger was interested
in many women, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>The secretary spoke bitterly. "He was a satyr, a beast, and
the pursuit of women was a mania with him. He carried on with
them here and in town, and I am certain that's what he kept a
secret cottage on the coast in Essex for. I wonder someone
hasn't shot him long ago."</p>

<p>Stone spoke very thoughtfully. "Then you think he was killed
out of revenge, do you?" He shook his head. "But everything
points to the crime having been committed by someone in the
house!"</p>

<p>"And that most probably was so," snapped Harland, he nodded
significantly, "by someone who was in hiding in the Court." He
spoke quickly. "Looking back, in my opinion the mistake was that
the house wasn't searched at once. We were all too ready to
accept the idea that he was killed by someone who was actually
living here."</p>

<p>Stone's eyes opened very wide. "That's a funny idea, isn't
it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not so funny as it seems when you consider it," said
Harland. "This house is old and rambling and covers a lot of
ground, the front door is always kept open during the day, and
there would be plenty of places to hide, once anyone got in. As
for getting away again, the dogs were chained up before six this
morning and there are several places where it would be quite
easy to climb over the wall. I've heard the village boys do it
often enough to come after the fruit."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then Stone asked, "And what
about this secret cottage, where is it, and what do you mean by
calling it secret?"</p>

<p>"It's near the little village of Bradwell, and on the estuary
of the River Blackwater, and I call it secret because he'd
bought it, or was leasing it, under another name. He's known as
William Hale down there, and I believe that's where he's been
going for many of those week-ends when he's supposed to have
been up North."</p>

<p>"And how did you come to know about it?"</p>

<p>"Quite by accident. A receipt for Council Rates, paid in cash
the previous Saturday, got mixed among some other papers he
brought me one Monday, and when I handed it back to him, he
seemed confused enough to make me curious. So the following
Sunday, having nothing better to do, I went down that way on my
motor-bicycle, and nearly ran into him. He was staying there
with a companion, a young woman. I saw them both in the
distance."</p>

<p>Stone made a gesture of disgust. "And do you think he managed
to keep all these adventures from coming to the knowledge of
Lady Hake?"</p>

<p>Harland's face at once took on a wooden expression. "I should
hardly think so, but I really can't tell you. I have been
brought in contact very little with Lady Hake, but from what I
have seen of her, I am sure she would prefer to hide her
troubles from everyone. She is of a reserved and proud
disposition."</p>

<p>After the secretary had left the room, several minutes
elapsed before the bell was rung again. The three men considered
what he had said.</p>

<p>"Think anything of that idea that some stranger was hiding in
the house?" Stone asked the Superintendent.</p>

<p>The latter looked uneasy. "Don't know what to say," he
frowned. "Of course, it is easy to see now it would have been
just as well to search the house, but"&mdash;he shrugged his
shoulders&mdash;"with so many possible suspects, as it were
right under my very nose, I didn't dream of looking beyond
them."</p>

<p>"A very honourable admission, sir," nodded Stone, "and your
making it does you credit. Of course it is possible, although
not in the slightest degree probable, that someone was hiding in
the house. Myself, however, I think the idea quite fantastic."
He turned to Larose. "Now, my son, what do you think of young
Harland?"</p>

<p>"Only one comment at present," nodded Larose, "and that is
why was he curious enough to track down Sir Roger to that lonely
village on the Essex coast? That strikes me as peculiar, as he
looks a gentlemanly man. I mean, in the ordinary way, I can't
think of him troubling himself with any of Sir Roger's private
affairs." He shook his head. "No, there's something there which
would probably interest us if we found it out."</p>

<p>Dr. King-Harley was the next to be questioned, but all he
added to what he had told the Superintendent the previous night
was how he had broken the news to Lady Hake. Accompanied by the
head-parlourmaid, he had gone up and knocked upon Lady Hake's
bedroom door, and upon her opening it, had told her her husband
had met with an accident.</p>

<p>"I had to start breaking it to her that way," he explained,
"as it would have been too awful to tell her right out he had
been murdered."</p>

<p>"Was she asleep when you knocked upon her door?" asked
Stone.</p>

<p>"No, she was in the bathroom, fomenting her arm. She had been
stung by a dragon-fly in the afternoon, and had worn a small
bandage at dinner."</p>

<p>"How did she take it?"</p>

<p>"Very badly. She was terrified. I never saw anyone more
frightened. She was prostrated at once, and I didn't feel it
wise to allow her to be by herself for one moment afterwards. I
made her have one of the maids with her all night."</p>

<p>Stone cleared his throat. "But was she&mdash;" he
hesitated&mdash;"was she as devoted to her husband as all
that?"</p>

<p>"It was not a question of devotion, at all," said the doctor
sharply, "but the fact that a murder had been committed in the
house. It was enough to terrify the strongest woman."</p>

<p>Stone spoke carelessly. "Still, would you say she was happy
in her married life?" he asked.</p>

<p>The doctor elevated his eyebrows. "Well, would you say it
after what the butler has just told you." He smiled a cold, grim
smile. "Oh, yes, Huntley's been telling us he kept nothing back,
and I think the man was glad to speak his mind. He must have
detested his master."</p>

<p>Stone spoke very sternly. "But don't you realise Doctor
King-Harley that in saying that you are suggesting that he is the
murderer?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," scoffed the doctor. He looked amused. "Why,
when he came into the library last night, in answer to our ring,
I could smell he'd just had beer and cheese. And I ask
you&mdash;would an ordinary man, whose trade was not murder go
in for beer and cheese just after he'd made his first kill?"</p>

<p>Stone shook his head. "Human beings are strange creatures,
Doctor, and you can never&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But good God, man!" exclaimed the doctor testily, "don't you
know that minds are my speciality and I'm what they call 'a mad
doctor'? Well, you've not a hope in the world of fixing that
murder upon Huntley. I tell you that, I, who can sum up a man's
mental equipment in half a split second. Bless my soul, until
Huntley had switched up the study lights and seen his dead
master lying there, he was the cool, unruffled gentleman's
servant. Then&mdash;then he went all to pieces."</p>

<p>Stone seemed impressed by the doctor's earnestness. "Well,
well, Doctor, we'll leave that for the moment. Now tell us, have
you any suggestion to make, in strict confidence of course?"</p>

<p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders. "Only what we all think
now, that someone who was hiding in the house shot him and got
away this morning."</p>

<p>"Who first started that idea?" snapped Stone.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Oh, yes, I believe it was Mr. Norton. He
brought it up at breakfast and"&mdash;the doctor
laughed&mdash;"we all seized on to it like drowning men. We were
relieved to have an explanation that would clear everybody in
the house."</p>

<p>When the doctor had gone out, Larose remarked, "Certainly
that butler may not have been the one to use that pistol, but I
am still sure he was lieing to us about what he was doing during
those six minutes the lights were out. If he'd been having his
supper, as the doctor suggests, I'm certain he'd have mentioned
it to us."</p>

<p>The King's Counsel came in next. He was sarcastic and cynical
and added nothing to what the inspectors already knew. As for
Sir Roger's private life, he said that, of course, there were
lots of rumours about, but how many of them were true no one
knew. Perhaps there were stories going round about himself. He
had two pretty typists in his Chambers and had made them
presents of flowers and chocolates and, occasionally, had taken
them out to lunch. Who had committed the murder he couldn't
hazard the faintest guess. If the butler had done it, then he
was the most consummate actor he had ever seen.</p>

<p>"Now for this Mr. Norton," said Stone as he rang the bell
again, "and we may get some meat there if we find Sir Roger had
been carrying on with his wife."</p>

<p>The door opened and a pleasant-looking man in the middle
'thirties entered the room. Stone's eyebrows came together in a
heavy frown. "But it was Mr. Norton we asked for
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Norton," smiled the newcomer. "There is no mistake.
You've got the right man."</p>

<p>Stone's face relaxed into a smile. "Well, your beard makes
you look naval, sir, and I quite thought you were Commander
Vanraven."</p>

<p>The inspector might easily have been forgiven for his mistake
as Mr. Norton had all the appearance of a naval man. He was
smart and alert in appearance, with his neatly trimmed beard,
strongly suggestive of the bridge of a man-of-war. A puzzled
expression came into Stone's face. "But haven't I seen you
somewhere before?" he asked. "Your face seems vaguely
familiar."</p>

<p>Mr. Norton laughed lightly. "Well, you saw me a little while
back in the breakfast-room. I was with the others when you came
in."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," laughed back Stone, "I ought to have
remembered that." His face sobered down. "Now, Mr. Norton, can
you tell us anything to help us?"</p>

<p>But apparently Mr. Norton could not, and his testimony was
exactly that of the others who had preceded him Then Stone
asked, "You were a great friend of Sir Roger, were you not?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly a great friend," replied Mr. Norton, "but I knew
him pretty well."</p>

<p>"And you liked him?" queried Stone.</p>

<p>The other smiled. "In parts." He explained. "You see,
although, as we understand the butler has told you, one side of
his nature was very detestable, still the other had many good
points. He was most generous, for instance, in his charities,
and helped the district a lot."</p>

<p>"So you put up with him," nodded Stone.</p>

<p>"Yes, we all did," nodded back Mr. Norton. He smiled. "We had
to, if only for financial and political reasons. He was a good
member for the division, in his way."</p>

<p>"But he wasn't liked among his own class?" suggested
Stone.</p>

<p>"Not particularly. But then he was never a man's man. He was
too masterful, too brusque and over-riding."</p>

<p>"But he was popular with the ladies?" went on Stone. "Did
Mrs. Norton like him?"</p>

<p>"Y-es, in a way. She was proud that she thought she could
always wheedle a bigger subscription out of him than anybody
else could."</p>

<p>"Did he visit your home?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious, yes. It's barely a mile away from here. He
was always popping over to compare his flowers with ours."</p>

<p>"Did he bring his wife with him?"</p>

<p>"Very seldom. Their marriage was a great mistake. She is
gentle and refined and shrinking, and he was coarse and rough,
and soon tired of anything he'd got."</p>

<p>Stone frowned. "You don't give him a good character, Mr.
Norton, and yet you allowed him, as you say, to be 'always
popping over.' Weren't you afraid of his annoying your
wife?"</p>

<p>Mr. Norton seemed very amused. "So that's what you've been
trying to get at, is it? Wondering if I were the jealous husband
and had put that bullet in him!"</p>

<p>Stone got rather red and looked down his nose. "Not at all,"
he said. "I was only curious, that knowing him to be the man he
was, why you allowed him to come to your house when you yourself
were probably not always about."</p>

<p>Mr. Norton shook his head. "Oh, he always behaved quite
properly when with my wife. He knew he had to there."</p>

<p>"And is your wife friendly with Lady Hake?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"Not as friendly as she would like to be, but then they're
both women of a reserved disposition and don't seem to want
friends. Besides, Sir Roger purposely kept his wife in the
background and we thought my wife trying to push herself in
there would have made things harder for Lady Hake. I tell you,
the man was of a peculiar temper."</p>

<p>Stone proceeded to question him about the happenings of the
previous night but, as with all the others, was soon up against
a stone wall. Next, Larose asked casually, "And what do you
think, sir, about this idea of Mr. Chater's that someone who had
been hiding in the Court killed Sir Roger?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't Mr. Chater's idea," protested Mr. Norton at once.
"It was mine. I thought of it in the night." He nodded. "And I
still think it the only possible explanation."</p>

<p>He left the room a few minutes later and Stone turned to the
others. "Another shrewd one," he remarked with a deep sigh. "He
came in all prepared with an answer to every question he thought
we might put." He frowned. "Anything to say, Gilbert?"</p>

<p>"Only that perhaps you fell too easily for his explanation of
where you'd seen him before," smiled Larose. "You golloped it
down without an instant's thought and he seemed very pleased you
did. He had one of his hands clenched when he first came in, but
he unclenched it at once then and didn't clench it again."</p>

<p>"You're too subtle, Gilbert," frowned the inspector. "Your
imagination's always running away with you." He turned to the
Superintendent. "Know anything about this Norton, Mr.
Houseman?"</p>

<p>The Superintendent smiled. "I should rather think I did. He's
a Justice of the Peace here and I often see him on the Bench. He
does a lot of public work, too, and is greatly respected. As for
Mrs. Norton, as the butler said, she's a very beautiful woman,
round about thirty, I should think."</p>

<p>Stone seemed disappointed and rang the bell for Martin Leeder
to be brought in. The trainer told the same story as the others
had done and the inspector was on the point of dismissing him
when Superintendent Houseman exclaimed suddenly, "Oh, one moment
if you please, Mr. Leeder! Now how long have you been training
Sir Roger's horses? Oh, four years. Then tell us the true story
of the shooting of Molly's Darling, the year before last."</p>

<p>The trainer frowned. "What's that to do with Sir Roger's
death?" he asked.</p>

<p>The Superintendent could show himself just as important as
the men from Scotland Yard, if need be, and perhaps, he was glad
of the opportunity of doing so now. "That's what we want to find
out," he said firmly. "I want to know the truth of that, and as
Sir Roger's trainer, you can give it me. One moment, though." He
turned to Inspector Stone. "In case you've not heard of it, the
story is this, Inspector. Lord Barham had that wonderful little
mare, Molly's Darling. Perhaps you remember her? A little bit of
a thing, but she won lots of races and was a great favourite
with the public. But Lord Barham died, and at the sale of his
horses, Sir Roger bought the mare. Then one day he backed her to
win a big packet at Sandown Park, but she was crushed with her
heavy weight and just failed. She was taken back home to Mr.
Leeder's stables and then, two days later, it was given out that
she'd dropped dead at exercise. That was what the public was
told, but I heard later"&mdash;the Superintendent spoke
scowlingly&mdash;"that Sir Roger pistolled her in cold blood,
out of spite." He turned to the trainer. "Now is that so, Mr.
Leeder?"</p>

<p>The trainer looked him straight in the face. "I decline to
say."</p>

<p>Inspector Stone spoke very sternly. "Come, come, Mr. Leeder,
that's not helping us and you must realise we can find out in
other ways if you won't tell us now. It was a dreadful thing if
Sir Roger did shoot the mare, and we don't want to make a public
scandal of it and bring discredit upon the racing world. We can
subpoena you to attend the inquest and then have you asked
there."</p>

<p>But the trainer still remained silent, and Larose added his
plea to that of the others, but he did it with a smile upon his
lips and no threat in his tones. "Don't you see what you are
doing, Mr. Leeder?" he said. "You are depriving us of a motive
for the murder! Here are you, one of the most respected men upon
the turf, with a three-year-old grievance against Sir Roger for
his dreadful cruelty to a beautiful animal! You wait your chance
and then pistol him just as he killed the mare! See, by your
silence you make us think you're guilty."</p>

<p>The trainer looked defiant. "I thought that was what you were
trying to get at, but I didn't shoot the man." He nodded to the
Superintendent. "Yes, sir, your story is quite true. Sir Roger
killed her himself. I was down with pneumonia at the time and
didn't hear until a week afterwards. Then when I saw him, my
fury had cooled down, but I've had no love for him ever
since."</p>

<p>"But you've still appeared friendly with him?" said
Stone.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I've had my living to get," snapped Leeder. He
sighed. "But I often work for men I don't like."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Leeder," said Larose, and, no more questions
being asked, the trainer left the room.</p>

<p>"Another suspect," grunted Stone, "though he doesn't look the
type!"</p>

<p>"Well, we're not looking for a type," commented Larose
thoughtfully. "I'm thinking the party who killed this beast will
be a very respectable sort of person to look at. Just a very
ordinary individual, whipped up by sudden passion to commit the
crime."</p>

<p>From Commander Vanraven and Paxton-Smith, they learnt
nothing. Certainly, the Commander seemed most unaccountably more
nervous than any of the others had been, so much so, that Stone
commented afterwards that if looks counted for anything, then he
was surely the guilty man. As for Paxton-Smith, his attitude was
one of annoyance more than anything else, as if he were annoyed
at having been inveigled into coming to the card-party and then
been let in for all the subsequent scandal.</p>

<p>"Take the maid-servants before Lady Hake," suggested Larose.
"We can go through them quickly. I don't suppose we shall get
much."</p>

<p>And, certainly, they gleaned nothing of any importance from
them as to the actual occurrences of the previous night, as it
appeared they had, everyone of them, either been awake at the
time of that first peal of thunder, or else had been awakened by
it, and could all give one another alibis. They could none of
them have been near the study during the time when the lights
were out.</p>

<p>When the cook, however, came to be questioned, they learnt
several interesting things. A woman about forty, she had been
with Sir Roger since the death of his first wife, two years
previously; she was shrewd and intelligent, if inclined to be a
bit talkative. She made no secret of her dislike of her dead
master.</p>

<p>"But I had nothing to do with him," she said, "or I probably
wouldn't have stopped a week in the house." She smiled. "But
then I was too old for him to be interested in me. I'm not young
and pretty."</p>

<p>"Mr. Huntley doesn't seem to have been too fond of him,
either," suggested Stone with the idea of leading her on.</p>

<p>"No, he wasn't," she agreed, "but he never discussed him with
us. He knew it was as much as his place was worth if it had ever
got back to the master." She nodded significantly. "But perhaps
he thought he had a special reason for not liking him."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Stone at once. "Come, you
must see it can do you no harm now, whatever you say," and he
smiled in a most friendly manner.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it's like this," she said. "We used to have a
pretty girl here, one of the parlourmaids, called Elsie Bane,
and Mr. Huntley was very taken with her. Master admired her too,
and often used to speak to her. One day she was put on the staff
in Berkeley Square, under Mrs. Rawson, the housekeeper there,
whom Mr. Huntley hates. Then the girl left London suddenly, and
we were told she had taken another place in the country on her
own account. No one was supposed to know exactly where she had
gone, but Mr. Huntley doesn't believe it. He thinks Master knew
and had something to do with her going off." She nodded
vehemently. "I think so, too. The housekeeper looked very funny
when I asked her about it. But she has always been very thick
with Sir Roger and wouldn't say anything."</p>

<p>Stone made no comment, but proceeded to ask her about the
relations between Sir Roger and Lady Hake.</p>

<p>"Poor little mistress," sighed the cook, "she's had a bad
time. From not wanting to have her out of his sight once.
Master's been hardly taking any interest in her lately. He
blamed her too, for every little thing which went wrong in the
house. He was angry with her yesterday about something, and one
of the girls heard him storming at her. Yes,"&mdash;she lowered
her voice darkly&mdash;"she's supposed to have got a dragon-fly
bite, on her arm yesterday, but Betty saw her without the
bandage and says it looked more like a bruise."</p>

<p>A short silence followed as Stone looked round at the others.
But their faces were quite impassive and he turned back to the
woman and asked her, "Now, has Huntley told you what we asked
him about the kitchen fire last night?" She nodded. "And he told
you to say he hadn't, if we asked you?" She nodded again and
Stone smiled. "Well, you say we didn't ask you. See?" and she
smiled back. He went on. "Well, what do you think? Would there
have been any embers burning at about half-past eleven?" and she
replied, "I should say so but of course, I can't be sure. I
certainly had had a good fire burning all the evening."</p>

<p>She was dismissed with the intimation to talk as little as
possible about what had been asked her. Then Stone turned once
more to his colleagues. "And what now?" was his question. "I
suppose we must have that poor little widow in!"</p>

<p>"No," said Larose, "I'd like to have the butler in again
first."</p>

<p>Stone pushed the bell, remarking at the same time, "Well,
don't give him any more reason why we are suspecting him."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," said Larose, "I'm going to ease his mind
there."</p>

<p>The butler came in as self-possessed as before, but his eyes
roved quickly round upon all the three men there, in turn.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Mr. Huntley," said Larose, "did you know Sir Roger
had a cottage or bungalow or some sort of house at Bradwell upon
the Essex coast, and that he used to go there at week-ends?"</p>

<p>The man looked very surprised, his eyes opened very wide and
his jaw dropped. "No," he replied slowly, "I've never heard
anything about it." He was most respectful. "May I ask, sir, who
told you?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "You may ask, but I'm not going to
tell you. Still we believe the information to be quite correct.
Now for another matter. Was Sir Roger methodical in his
habits?"</p>

<p>"Certainly he was," replied Huntley, "most methodical in
everything."</p>

<p>"Well, what was the last thing he generally did at night,
just before he went up to bed?"</p>

<p>"Locked up his desk in his study, and saw that the door of
the safe was shut. He was always most particular about
that."</p>

<p>Larose spoke very solemnly. "So that if anyone knew his ways
and wanted to lie in hiding and be pretty sure of catching him
alone, he would be waiting for him in his study the last thing
at night?"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed the butler, with his eyes fixed intently upon
Larose's face.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Larose. "That's all I wanted to ask you,"
and the butler left the room slowly and as if reluctant to do so
because his curiosity had not been satisfied.</p>

<p>"So, Gilbert," frowned Stone when the door was shut again,
"then you're falling for the idea now that some stranger was
hidden in the house?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," said Larose, "but what the cook told us
about that missing girl, the parlourmaid I mean, has made me
realise we can't altogether leave it out. What about Sir Roger
having wronged her and she waiting for him in the study to have
her revenge. She could easily have hidden behind that thick
curtain by the window."</p>

<p>Stone looked sceptical. "For the matter of that," he
commented dryly, "what about her ladyship having been waiting
there to avenge that bruise upon her arm?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "Exactly, anyone who knew Sir Roger's ways
might have filled the bill there!" He frowned. "So now we'll ask
Lady Hake to come here."</p>

<p>"One moment!" said Stone. "Let me think."</p>

<p>"What about?" asked Larose, rather impatiently.</p>

<p>"That fellow Norton," replied Stone. He held up one hand for
silence. "Gosh, I've heard that voice somewhere and it's
associated in my mind with something disappointing!" He shook
his head. "But no, I can't recall him! I'll have to worry about
it later. It's sure to come back." He heaved a big sigh as he
put his finger on the bell. "Now for her pretty little ladyship.
Let's hope she didn't fire that shot."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; THE WHITE SLAVE.</h2>

<p class="first">
WHEN in answer to the inspector's ring the butler appeared in
the library and Stone learnt that Lady Hake was in the drawing-room,
he requested him to ask her if they could come and speak
to her there.</p>

<p>"Less of an ordeal for her," he nodded to the others when
Huntley had left upon his errand. He made a grimace. "She must
realise we only want to question her because we believe it is
possible she may have been the one to shoot her husband."</p>

<p>The Superintendent scoffed. "You won't think that when you
see her. She's only just over nineteen. She was eighteen when he
married her." He nodded. "She is a very pretty girl."</p>

<p>Stone shook his head. "Youth and good looks are no bar to
crime, and particularly so in a woman. I knew a girl once, with
the face of an angel, who poisoned the man who jilted her, and
she wasn't even eighteen."</p>

<p>"Mad?" queried the Superintendent.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," laughed Stone. "As sane as you and me, and
clever enough, too, to wheedle the jury into acquitting her. The
old judge was furious. He was as certain as we were that she had
done it. It was a sure thing, though the evidence was only
circumstantial."</p>

<p>"What became of her?" asked the Superintendent.</p>

<p>"Became of her!" exclaimed Stone. "Why she married another
man." He laughed. "I met her twenty years afterwards and she was
a most respected woman. Four children and a husband who thought
the world of her." He nodded. "I would have forgiven her if she
hadn't used strychnine. The man she poisoned died a terrible
death."</p>

<p>The butler returned to say that his mistress was waiting to
see them and, accordingly, with no delay the three men were
ushered into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Now if the two inspectors had been imagining a girl of doll-faced
beauty they were very much mistaken. The Mary, Lady Hake,
was a very different being from the Mary Hellister of maiden
days. The short year of married life had effected a great change
in her, but its unhappiness, instead of crushing her, had
developed a force of character which not even her parents had
suspected lay latent in her. It had given strength and decision
to her face and, acutely sensitive of the shame her husband had
brought upon her, pride had come to her aid and taught her to
hide her misery under a mask.</p>

<p>So, it was a proud and very self-possessed young woman who
now greeted the inspectors and Superintendent Houseman and
motioned them to be seated. Certainly, Stone thought, she was
very lovely with her clear-cut profile, her beautiful colouring,
her eyes of deepest blue and her exquisitely moulded lips and
chin. With all his acquaintance with the worst side of life, he
wondered how any man, becoming so recently possessed of such a
treasure, could have allowed his tenderest emotions to stray
elsewhere.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have to trouble your ladyship," he began in
most sympathetic tones, "but it is our duty to learn where
everyone was last night. Of course, in your case it is only a
matter of form." He went on briskly, "Now I understand you did
not see your husband again from the moment he left the
dining-room after dinner?"</p>

<p>Her voice shook ever so little. "No, I did not see him
again."</p>

<p>"And you came here into the drawing-room and remained by
yourself until you went off to bed? Did anyone see you were
here?"</p>

<p>"Phoebe, my maid, who brought me a cup of tea at about ten
o'clock," she replied, she hesitated just a moment, "and Mr.
Harland who came in at my husband's request to fetch a box of
cigarettes which had been left here."</p>

<p>Stone frowned. "What time did Mr. Harland come in?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but it was some while after I had finished my
cup of tea and before eleven, because I went up to my bedroom
then."</p>

<p>"Was that early or late for you?"</p>

<p>"Neither; my usual time."</p>

<p>Stone was still frowning. "And Doctor King-Harley says that
he did not come up and tell you what had happened until after he
had rung up the police-station at Saffron Walden. That would
make it after midnight and yet you were still not in bed. How
was that?"</p>

<p>Her voice was quite steady. "I had sat at the window watching
the storm and did not begin to undress until it was over."</p>

<p>Stone eyed her very intently. "Doctor King-Harley tells us
you were fomenting your arm when he knocked upon your door."</p>

<p>She nodded carelessly. "Yes, a dragon-fly had stung me that
afternoon."</p>

<p>Stone was all sympathy at once. "A nasty insect to be stung
by!" he exclaimed. He rose to his feet. "May I look at the
place?"</p>

<p>"But you won't be able to see much now," she said, "I've put
grease and powder on it, so that it doesn't show. My skin
discolours easily and it was disfiguring."</p>

<p>She held out a beautifully moulded arm for his inspection and
for a few seconds he bent over it. "It must have swollen up a
lot," was his comment, given thoughtfully and very slowly.</p>

<p>"It did," she said, "but it quickly went down."</p>

<p>He resumed his seat and his questioning. "And after you once
went up to your room you did not leave it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, I did not come downstairs again until"&mdash;she
hesitated&mdash;"until I was told the police were in the
house."</p>

<p>"Now, another thing, your ladyship," went on Stone, "had your
husband any enemies, do you think?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "I expect so. Successful business men always make
enemies, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but any particular ones, I mean. Did Sir Roger ever
mention to you that he was in danger from anyone?"</p>

<p>"No, never!"</p>

<p>"But you knew he'd bought a pistol."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he used to practise in the garden with it." She
shook her head wearily. "It's no use your asking me anything
about my husband's business affairs or who his rivals were,
because I knew nothing of them. He never talked to me about
them."</p>

<p>A moment's silence followed and then Stone asked, "Well, you
can make no guess as to who killed him? None whatever? You don't
think your butler can have done it?"</p>

<p>Her eyes opened very wide. "Why? Huntley had nothing against
him. My husband was sharp-tempered and irritable sometimes, but
Huntley understood him, as we all did. We didn't take any notice
of his moods." She smiled a reluctant smile. "No, Huntley is
much too polite to have killed him. He's been a gentleman's
servant all his life and it's his nature to put up with
everything from those who employ him."</p>

<p>The three men returned to the library and resumed their seats
in silence.</p>

<p>"Well," asked Stone at length, "what about it?" He answered
his own question with a frown. "She's quite different from what
I expected. She's got spirit and we can't leave her out."</p>

<p>"I'm a bit suspicious, too," nodded the Superintendent. "I
expected to find her a gentle woe-begone creature, but
instead&mdash;" he spread out his hands&mdash;"why she's quite
capable of punishing any man's brutality to her."</p>

<p>"Ay, and he was brutal," scowled Stone. "He'd gripped that
beautiful arm of hers and that was a bruise right enough." He
drew in a deep breath. "Yes, I'm glad the man's dead! She'll be
able to have some happiness in life now and&mdash;" he sighed
deeply&mdash;"give some decent chap a taste of heaven too."</p>

<p>"One thing," went on the Superintendent slowly, "when she
said young Harland had come in to get that box of cigarettes I
noticed by your frown that you remembered Harland had told us
none of them had left the room at all during the evening."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," nodded Stone, "but I don't think I attach any
importance to it." He turned to Larose. "What do you think,
Gilbert?" A thought seemed to come suddenly to him. "Ah, what if
she showed Harland her bruise then and it made him so furious
that, in the white heat of passion and before he'd had time to
calm down, he followed Sir Roger into the study and shot him
dead." His eyes opened very wide. "Now that's an idea."</p>

<p>"Who's got the imagination now?" laughed Larose. "In one
breath you think the girl shot him and in the next, young
Harland." He shook his head vexatiously. "No, we've got a lot to
think out before we can concentrate upon anyone in
particular."</p>

<p>Stone winked at the Superintendent. "Our friend Gilbert
Larose is incurably romantic and it would be torture to him to
have to place the cuffs on Harland if the young fellow were in
love with her pretty little ladyship."</p>

<p>"I wonder how she'll be left off?" queried the
Superintendent. "She may be a great catch now."</p>

<p>"So she will be," nodded Stone. "I got out of Huntley
directly we arrived here this morning that Arnold Chater was Sir
Roger's lawyer and I rang him out of bed at once. He'll be down
here any moment now to see Lady Hake, but he told me definitely
that she inherits everything by a Will signed directly after the
marriage."</p>

<p>He rose from the chair. "Well, I suppose we'll have to tell
those card-players they can go now, and to-morrow have the
inquest adjourned until we're more ready." He frowned. "We're
going to take no scalps back with us to town to-day."</p>

<p>The two inspectors arrived back at Scotland Yard late that
afternoon and Stone at once sought out his old friend and
colleague Inspector Carter. "See here, Elias," he said, looking
very troubled, "we've been all day on that Sir Roger Hake case
and done no good. I see the evening newspapers have already
nosed out a lot and I expect you've read all about it. Well, one
of those seven card-players, who all swore they had never left
their seats when the lights went out, is worrying me a lot. I'll
stake my life I've seen him before, but I can't think
where."</p>

<p>"Can't he help you?" asked Inspector Carter.</p>

<p>"Help me!" scoffed Stone. "Not he! He won't! That's it!
There's something fishy about when and where we met before.
Well, this chap is quite a big bug down there, a magistrate and
all that, and I've got a photograph of him opening a Flower Show
last year. It's been lent me by the local newspaper, the
<i>Saffron Walden Chronicle."</i></p>

<p>He produced a fair-sized photo from his bag. "Now here he is
in this group. The fellow with a naval beard, next to the Mayor
with his chain. Now, do you ever remember seeing him? He's
associated with something unpleasant to me. He's a gentleman,
good looking and very nicely spoken. He's very confident and
bold in all he says, very sure of himself and always ready with
an answer. He's got a nicely modulated voice."</p>

<p>Inspector Carter scrutinised the photo, long and carefully,
through a big magnifying-glass which he took out of his desk. He
breathed heavily, he stared hard and he thought. "I've seen
him," he said at length, "and I've seen him when I was with you.
What's his name, Norton! No, we didn't know him by that name. It
was a much commoner one."</p>

<p>"Smith, Jones, Martin," prompted Stone anxiously, "Thompson,
White, Black, Anders&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" interrupted Carter sharply. "I have it. It was Brown.
Yes, and the Christian name was something very funny, a name
that you see carved on stones in the British Museum. Ajax,
Pluto, Jupiter&mdash;ah&mdash;Jason. That's it, Jason Brown.
Now, who the dickens was he?"</p>

<p>Stone flopped down on to another chair and snatching out his
handkerchief began to mop his forehead fiercely. "Oh, Elias,
Elias!" he exclaimed weakly, "with all your poor intelligence
and third-rate brain-power, you're a perfect treasure of a man
to work with. Who was Jason Brown?" he asked with gathering
strength. "Why, man alive, he was that man we couldn't get the
evidence against in the Beachy Head murder case of ten or eleven
years ago." He sprang up in his excitement. "Oh, what a
revelation! Of course, it was he, older, more sure of himself
and with more authority about him because of his public
position. By Jove, how he must have chuckled at my not placing
him."</p>

<p>Carter's eyes were still upon the photograph. "Yes, it's
Jason Brown right enough&mdash;and so now he calls himself
Norton."</p>

<p>"Hector Norton," laughed Stone in great glee, "another
heathenish name in all conscience." He seemed delighted with
himself. "And I just told you this had been a blank day!"</p>

<p>"Cool down a bit, Charlie," warned Carter frowningly, "now
you know who he is, how is it going to help you? If he's been as
slick now as he was on Beachy Head, you won't be able to land
him."</p>

<p>Stone's face fell. "Oh, he's slick, right enough. He had
every answer ready before I'd even asked the question." His face
brightened. "But we'll have Gilbert in and see what he
says."</p>

<p>Larose listened most intently to the story of the Beachy Head
murder, and of Jason Brown's subsequent marriage to the daughter
of the man he was supposed to have killed.</p>

<p>"But he's not got that wife now!" exclaimed Stone angrily,
"the Saffron Walden Superintendent told me his present wife is a
beautiful woman, whereas poor Margaret Brendon, his first wife,
was disfigured with a dreadful red birthmark covering half her
face. No, he's probably killed her and married again." He
snapped his fingers together. "Once a murderer, always a
murderer if only chance comes your way."</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do now?" asked Carter. "There
seems to be plenty to find out about the man, though it may have
no direct bearing upon the Hake Court murder."</p>

<p>"To-morrow," snapped Stone, "I'll send two of our men down to
Saffron Walden and we'll find out on the quiet all about this
precious Hector Norton, when he came to live there, where he
moved from, when his first wife died, when she was buried and
what the death certificate says she died from." He nodded
viciously. "With that information in our hands we'll have
something to go upon."</p>

<p>"And I'll go down to that bungalow in Essex," said Larose,
"and find out what I can about the woman or women Hake's been
meeting there." An idea struck him. "Did you by chance, happen
to find out from the Superintendent what the present Mrs. Norton
is like?"</p>

<p>"I didn't find out by chance," frowned Stone irritably. "I
enquired particularly what sort of woman she is, and Houseman
told me she is of medium height, good looking, with grey eyes
and beautiful teeth which she makes the most of when she smiles.
She's away from home just now or I should have gone and seen
her."</p>

<p>"Good," laughed Larose, "then I'll look out for a grey-eyed
beauty with a good mouthful of ivories."</p>

<p>The following morning he motored down across the dreary Essex
marshes to the little village of Bradwell which lies almost at
the extreme northern end of that lonely stretch of land between
the rivers Blackwater and Crouch.</p>

<p>"It looks all right, now," he muttered, as the road ran in
and out across the marshland, "but, Heavens&mdash;what a place
to be in the winter. I'll bet the whole shore is blanketed then
for days on end in fog."</p>

<p>He parked his car in the yard of the village inn and strolled
into the bar to have a drink. He was served by a bright-faced
young fellow who looked only just out of his teens. 'Couldn't be
better,' ran his thoughts. 'He'll know everything and everybody
in the district.'</p>

<p>"Where's Mr. Hale's place?" he asked over a glass of
beer.</p>

<p>The young fellow pointed through the window. "Over there," he
replied. "It's the last bungalow at the end, right on the shore.
It's about a mile from here." Then he added, "He's not there to-day
though his wife is, so I expect he'll be coming this week-end."</p>

<p>"Oh, his wife's there, is she?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, she came into Mr. Powell's place, he's the grocer, this
morning for the newspaper and some other things."</p>

<p>"Has she got a car?"</p>

<p>"No, a bicycle." The boy laughed. "You want a bicycle in
these parts when it's been raining. The road is bad across the
marsh."</p>

<p>"Then you get the newspapers here?" said Larose.</p>

<p>The boy laughed again. "Rather, the postman brings them out
from Southminster before eight o'clock. We're quite up to date
except for people who go and build bungalows a long way from the
proper roads."</p>

<p>"I haven't seen Mr. Hale for years," said Larose
meditatively. "He used to be a fine, healthy-looking man."</p>

<p>"So he is now," said the boy. "I saw him motoring through
here last week. He has to come this way when it's wet because of
the road, but if it's fine he takes a short cut and turns on to
the marsh lower down."</p>

<p>"What's Mrs. Hale like?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Oh, a good-looking lady, very handsome."</p>

<p>"Do they keep a servant there?"</p>

<p>"No, there's no servant. You see they only come there every
now and then. Still, when they do they sometimes bring down a
woman with them to do up the house, but she only stays during
the day and then Mr. Hale drives her back to Southminster to
catch the last train at night."</p>

<p>Larose asked a few more questions, and then announced he was
going to take a stroll to stretch his legs, but would be back
later for another drink and some bread and cheese.</p>

<p>He did not cross directly over the marsh to the Hale bungalow
but made his way round by the sea-shore, thus approaching it
from the side. He judged it contained only four rooms.
Stretching away from the front verandah was a little plot of
grass which ran down almost to high-water mark.</p>

<p>Turning the corner of the house, he came with great
suddenness upon a woman lying back in a big deck-chair upon the
verandah. Upon her lap was a newspaper. Apparently, she had her
eyes shut, for she took no notice of his approach. His footsteps
were deadened by the sand, so she did not hear him, either.</p>

<p>Arriving to within a few yards of her, he stopped and then
coughed to attract her attention. The effect was electrical.
Obviously she had not been asleep, as she sprang like lightning
to her feet and faced him with all the terror of a cornered
animal.</p>

<p>She had evidently been crying recently, for her eyes were red
and swollen, and her face was wan and tear-stained. Her hair,
too, was all dishevelled. He drew a deep breath, as he saw that
upon ordinary occasions she would have been a very handsome
woman and that&mdash;the colour of her eyes was grey.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to trouble you," he began, "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who are you and what do you want?" she almost shrieked at
him. "Don't you know you are upon private property?"</p>

<p>"My name is Larose," he said quietly, "and I want"&mdash;he
had realised it would be wisest to come straight to the
point&mdash;"to speak to you about the late Sir Roger Hake." He
pointed to the newspaper she had flung to the ground. "I see you
know what has happened to him."</p>

<p>The woman's bosom rose and fell in her emotion, her mouth was
opened wide and her grey eyes seemed more grey than ever in her
dreadful terror.</p>

<p>Larose put as much sympathy as he could into his voice and
went on very quietly, "But I want to give you as little distress
as possible. I only&mdash;&mdash;" He broke off suddenly and
asked, "You are Mrs. Norton aren't you, Mrs. Hector Norton?" He
spoke a little sharply. "Now, no prevarication, please."</p>

<p>The woman spoke hoarsely. "What's it to you whoever I am?"
Her voice rose in anger. "I refuse to discuss anything with
you."</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "But you can't do that. I'm an
inspector from the Criminal Investigation Department of Scotland
Yard and I'm enquiring into the murder of Sir Roger Hake."</p>

<p>Her face went pale as death and she tottered back and sank
into the deck-chair. "But I can't have had anything to do with
it," she wailed. "I've been staying here since Tuesday. They can
tell you that in the village."</p>

<p>"I know that," nodded Larose assuringly. "We're not
suspecting you. We are quite aware you've been here all the time
and we have nothing against you. Still, we think you can help us
to find out who the real murderer is." He spoke sternly. "Now,
when you've been coming down here it's been as Sir Roger's wife,
hasn't it? You two have been passing as Mr. and Mrs. Hale."</p>

<p>She was more composed now and a little defiant. "You say so,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no getting away from it, is there?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>He spoke sharply. "Now does your husband know you've been
here?"</p>

<p>She flashed him a sarcastic smile, showing a row of perfect
teeth. "What do you think?" Her face sobered down to fear. "He'd
kill me if he knew."</p>

<p>"As he probably killed Sir Roger," snapped Larose. He went
on, "Does he suspect you? You're sure he doesn't?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he does."</p>

<p>"Are you separated from him?"</p>

<p>She nodded and then her defiance rose again. "You can do what
you like," she said angrily, "but I'll answer no questions. If
my husband killed Sir Roger, then just you prove it. It's
nothing to do with me and you can't compel a wife to provide
evidence against her husband."</p>

<p>And that was all she would say. She picked up the newspaper
again, and pretending to read, took not the slightest notice of
him, even to ignoring his polite good-day when, realising it was
hopeless, a few minutes later he took his leave.</p>

<p>"Poor creature," he meditated, "she was evidently fond of
him." He sighed heavily. "Why is it the worst of men so often
make such an appeal to really nice women? This one here is no
wanton. She has quite a good face and would be as faithful as a
dog to the husband who treated her properly." He scowled. "That
fellow Norton, or Brown or whatever his name is, was probably a
brute to her and yet"&mdash;he frowned&mdash;"he didn't look a
bad sort of man to me. I rather liked his appearance."</p>

<p>After a few enquiries at the railway-station at Southminster
Larose returned to town, his next visit being to the Hake
mansion in Berkeley Square to interview the housekeeper there.
He found her a hard-faced angular woman of middle age, with cold
fish-like eyes, and thin lips, pressed very tightly together.
She had very little to say for herself and everything had to be
dragged out of her by close questioning. She volunteered nothing
of her own accord. Asked if she knew Sir Roger had any enemies,
she replied laconically, "Plenty&mdash;business ones."</p>

<p>Questioned as to if she knew the identity of any of the
ladies Sir Roger, as the butler had said, sometimes brought home
for champagne suppers late at night, she professed to know
nothing about them. She had always believed the midnight
visitors to be gentleman ones. As for the parlourmaid, Elsie
Bane, she gave her a bad character. The girl was sly and could
not be trusted, and to where she had gone and with whom she had
gone&mdash;she nodded significantly here&mdash;no one could say.
She had taken herself off one morning at an hour's notice,
apparently being in possession of sufficient money&mdash;there
was more nodding here&mdash;to be quite indifferent to the
month's wages she was forfeiting.</p>

<p>Asked about the bungalow upon the Essex coast, she raised her
eyebrows and appeared most surprised. She knew nothing about it,
which last statement amused Larose quite a lot, seeing that the
description he had got in Southminster of the woman who had been
occasionally brought down to clean up the bungalow tallied
exactly with that of the housekeeper now before him.</p>

<p>'An out-and-out liar,' he told himself as he left the house.
'Of course, she was hand in glove with Sir Roger in his love
adventures and if any harm came to that poor little Elsie Bane,
then she knew all about it.' He made a gesture of disgust. 'She
looks a typical procuress to me. Cold, cruel and sexless, it's
my opinion she would do anything for money.'</p>

<p>Arriving at Scotland Yard, he found Inspectors Stone and
Carter in earnest consultation with the two plain-clothes men
who had been sent down to Saffron Walden and had just returned
with what information they had been able to gather about Mr.
Hector Norton, of Crane Park, of Crane village, about three
miles from Saffron Walden. It appeared he had bought the park
about eight and a half years previously, having moved, it was
believed, from Hampstead. He had been then married to his
present wife and they had arrived with one child about a year
old. They had now three. His wife's maiden name had been
Andover. Her Christian name was Wendy, or at any rate he called
her that. As for his previous wife, nothing could be learnt
about her, no one, indeed, being aware that he had been married
before. He was now a gentleman of independent means, making,
however, a very profitable hobby of breeding prize Jersey cows.
He had once been connected with the Stock Exchange and it was
said he had made a fortune in the rubber boom of ten years back.
His wife was a very good-looking woman, only two or three years
younger than he was, and they appeared to be living on the best
of terms. She occasionally went away by herself, it was said to
visit her mother who lived near Edinburgh. She was away at the
present moment and had been away for a fortnight. She was
expected back any time now.</p>

<p>"And what were her relations with Sir Roger Hake?" frowned
Stone.</p>

<p>"As far as we can gather," replied the plain-clothes man who
was the spokesman of the two, "they were very friendly with each
other. It was a joke among the servants that one day they would
be running off together."</p>

<p>The plain-clothes men were dismissed and Stone turned to
Carter and Larose. "Exactly," he snapped, "that wretch got rid
of poor Margaret Brendon in some way and married this other
bit!" He thumped his fist upon the desk. "Ay, and he must have
got rid of her quickly too, to have turned up in Essex eight and
a half years ago with a child, a year old by this new wife, when
ten years ago he had only just married the girl whose father he
had murdered on Beachy Head." He thumped again upon the desk,
"We must get hold of this Wendy at once. Perhaps, if she was
very gone on Hake, she'll round on her husband and put us in the
way of getting evidence against him. That's
what&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But doesn't it strike you, Charlie," broke in Carter
quickly, "that if this man is what we take him to be he may,
already, have made certain she will not speak. She may already
be out of our reach. She may be dead too."</p>

<p>"No, she's not," said Larose. He nodded very solemnly. "I
spoke to her only a few hours ago."</p>

<p>For the moment the two colleagues were too astounded to make
any comment and he went on: "She is staying at that bungalow on
the coast near Bradwell. She was waiting for Sir Roger to come
down this week-end, but learnt of his death from the newspaper
this morning. She was prostrate with grief," and then he
proceeded to relate everything which had taken place that
morning.</p>

<p>"And she told at once who she was?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>Larose laughed. "I sprang it upon her and she was so amazed I
knew who she was that she couldn't deny it."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" exclaimed Stone. He frowned. "But how much
nearer does this bring us to arresting Jason Brown?" He nodded.
"Still, we've got the motive for his killing Sir Roger&mdash;Sir
Roger ruining his wife."</p>

<p>"But can we prove he knows she was unfaithful?" asked Larose.
"Don't forget that when I asked her if her husband knew, she
said he'd kill her if he did." He nodded. "Yes, and she was not
acting then. She meant it."</p>

<p>"But, of course he knew," protested Stone. "The thought was
uppermost in his mind when we were questioning him, and knowing
we should sooner or later find it out, he tried to forestall us
and cut the ground away from under our feet by sarcastically
bringing it up first." He turned to Carter. "That's just what
the Jason Brown of ten years ago would have done, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," agreed Carter. "He was always a little bit
ahead of all our questions."</p>

<p>"One moment!" exclaimed Larose. "You've told me this Jason
Brown wasn't altogether a bad lot. You say he returned the money
to the bank and showed repentance for having killed the husband
and father by helping the widow financially and marrying the
daughter who was so hideously disfigured that no other man would
have taken her."</p>

<p>"That's so," frowned Stone, "I couldn't understand him then."
He stuck to his prejudice. "But he couldn't have cared tuppence
for the girl by marrying the other woman so quickly." His voice
rose. "Good God, man, she could hardly have been cold in her
coffin before he took this second wife!"</p>

<p>"And Margaret Brendon may have died quite naturally," went on
Larose. "There may have been nothing suspicious there."</p>

<p>"Well, that's what we've got to find out," said Stone, "and
if it turns out there was anything wrong, then the evidence
against him will have become cumulative." He thumped upon the
desk for the third time. "Don't you see it is cumulative
already, for it must be far more than a coincidence that he is
mixed up in two murders, first that of Beachy Head and now that
of Hake Court. No, when a man's suspected of one murder, a
suspicion which in our country happens to less than one person
in a million, it may be just chance or bad fortune
but"&mdash;the stout inspector clenched his fist&mdash;"when a
man's suspected of two murders, with years passing between them,
then depend upon it it's neither chance nor bad fortune but only
what he deserves."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet with a grim smile upon his face. "To-morrow,
boys, we will all three go down to Crane Park and just
try to bounce the fellow into a confession and he'll be so
surprised to see us that it is just possible he'll throw up the
sponge."</p>

<p>The following morning soon after nine o'clock the three
inspectors left Scotland Yard in an unofficial-looking police
car. Carter was pensive, because he never counted his chickens
before they were hatched and Larose was doubtful, because he'd
rather liked the look of Hector Norton, but Stone was most
hopeful and very careful to see there had been a pair of
handcuffs put in the pocket of the car.</p>

<p>Larose drove, and passing through Saffron Walden they soon
reached Crane village, with Crane Park just on its outskirts.
"Whwew," whistled Stone as they passed through the open park
gates and saw the house nearly half a mile away in the distance,
"but murder seems a paying business! This chap's got a lovely
place. Go slowly up the drive. Don't let it appear as if we are
in a hurry." He looked uneasy. "I hope to goodness we find him
at home."</p>

<p>Just as they had reached the end of the drive and were
slowing down to pull up at the big hall door, a man attired in
breeches and leggings and carrying a short riding-whip stepped
out. He stopped and looked enquiringly at the approaching
car.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" exclaimed Stone softly. "We're in luck. It's the
assassin himself!"</p>

<p>The car was brought to a standstill and Stone jumped briskly
out. "Good morning, sir," he said curtly, "we want a word with
you."</p>

<p>Mr. Norton looked frowningly at the watch upon his wrist.
"Well, it must be a short one," he said, "unless you don't mind
waiting about an hour. I have some important business with my
bailiff and am just riding over to meet him."</p>

<p>Stone came straight to the point. "We know who killed Sir
Roger now and that's what we've come here about."</p>

<p>There was no doubt in the minds of the three inspectors that
Mr. Norton was astonished and most disagreeably so, too. His
face went a little pale and his jaw dropped.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Jason Brown," went on Stone fiercely, "you're
returning with us for another little talk at the Yard and it
won't end in the way the last one did." He nodded vehemently.
"My strong advice to you is to give no trouble. You shot Sir
Roger because he's got your wife away from you and you'd found
out."</p>

<p>If the inspector had been confident the man before him would
be amazed and overwhelmed, presumably by the unmasking of his
identity and their knowledge of him having committed the crime,
he was certainly not going to be disappointed. For the moment
Mr. Norton was too amazed to speak.</p>

<p>"There's no getting away from it this time," went on Stone
truculently. "We've got the evidence we want and you'd better
admit everything straight away. It's no good your attempting to
deny it."</p>

<p>The man who called himself Mr. Norton found his tongue at
last. "Don't you be a fool," he cried angrily. "You're talking
arrant nonsense. I didn't shoot Sir Roger and you can't have the
slightest evidence that I did. As for my wife"&mdash;he smiled
scoffingly&mdash;"Sir Roger has no more got her away from me
than you have." He lifted his head and laughed scornfully. "Oh,
what another mare's-nest you've discovered." He spoke very
sternly. "But see here, Inspector Stone, no tricks upon me now.
I'm not a friendless boy, remember, but a public man and one of
His Majesty's Justices of the Peace. You'll ruin your whole
career if you lay a finger on me."</p>

<p>His words, so confidently spoken, fell upon Stone's ears like
a cold douche, but for all that the stout inspector kept up a
brave appearance of assurance. "Oh, and you'll tell us, too," he
retorted, "that you are not masquerading under a false name and
that Hector Norton is your real one."</p>

<p>"So it is," was the quiet reply. "Nine years ago, my aunt,
Mrs. Edwin Norton of Chichester, bequeathed to me her whole
estate upon the condition that I changed my name to Norton,
which I accordingly did. As for the Christian name, Hector, I
was baptised Jason Hector Brown, but when I changed the Brown to
Norton by deed-poll I dropped the Jason. I'd never liked the
name, and Hector Norton sounded better." He laughed lightly.
"Very easily explained, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"But the explanation is a bit late, isn't it?" snarled Stone.
"Why didn't you tell us all this the day before yesterday, when
we were questioning you at Hake Court?"</p>

<p>"But why should I have explained everything to you then?"
asked Mr. Norton sharply. "I am under no obligation to you for
any kindness shown to me, and I want to forget the most
undeserved nightmare you thrust upon me."</p>

<p>Stone turned the conversation brusquely. "Where's your wife?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I shan't tell you that," replied Mr. Norton firmly. He spoke
bitterly. "I don't want her to know her husband has been
suspected of murdering her father."</p>

<p>"Her father!" exclaimed Stone in scorn. "Why, you wretch,
she's not the girl you were married to when I last saw you."</p>

<p>But Mr. Norton made no reply. The sound of a car had been
heard in the distance and all, turning round, fixed their eyes
upon one coming up the drive.</p>

<p>"God, here she is!" exclaimed Mr. Norton after a few moments
in the most obvious dismay. He turned like the strike of a snake
upon Stone. "You dare to mention her father to her," he cried
fiercely, "and I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll what?" derided Stone, because he'd stopped speaking.
"More thoughts of murder in your heart, eh?"</p>

<p>Mr. Norton spoke very quietly. "I'll knock you down if you
do, or at any rate I'll try to." He corrected himself quickly.
"No, I won't. There'll be no need to. With all your harshness, I
know you to be too much of a gentleman to bring it up to
her."</p>

<p>The car arrived to where the four men were standing and a
woman jumped out. "Hullo, Jim, how are you?" she called out
brightly, and ignoring the presence of the others, she ran up to
Mr. Norton and kissed him.</p>

<p>"Quite all right, Wendy," was the smiling reply. He pointed
to Inspector Stone and added gaily. "But look here. There's an
old friend of yours. Don't you remember him?"</p>

<p>Margaret, for of course it was she, turned in the direction
he indicated and instantly uttered a little cry of pleasure. "Of
course, I do," she exclaimed, stepping forward and holding out
her hand. "How are you, Mr. Stone? I've often thought of you and
wanted to see you again. Mother was speaking about you only last
week."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;" began Stone.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember me?" she asked, as the inspector made no
attempt to take her hand. "Why, I am Margaret Brendon that was,
then Margaret Brown and now"&mdash;she laughed
merrily&mdash;"Margaret Norton. The last time we met was at a
Chrysanthemum Show at the Botanical Gardens. I introduced you to
my husband then."</p>

<p>"You, Matthew Brendon's daughter?" exclaimed Stone, looking
really astounded. "Why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, how stupid of me," she broke in. "Of course, I forgot
you knew me when I had that dreadful birthmark. But it's all
gone, as you see. A wonderful professor in Geneva took it away
more than nine years ago, so long ago that I'm continually
forgetting now I ever had it." She laughed gaily. "Now don't you
remember me?"</p>

<p>Stone's frowning face at last relaxed and he shook her hand
warmly. "Of course, I do," he said, he made a grimace, "and I
see I've made a great mistake. I jumped to conclusions too
quickly."</p>

<p>He turned sharply to Larose. "This is not the lady you saw
yesterday?" and Larose, who had been looking most uncomfortable,
shook his head and replied instantly, "No, and not a bit like
her, either."</p>

<p>"But what are you here for, Mr. Stone?" asked Margaret
curiously.</p>

<p>The inspector hesitated and her husband broke in quickly.
"It's about Sir Roger," he began, "and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, wasn't it awful about him!" interrupted Margaret. "I
didn't know anything about it until yesterday morning. I was up
in Scotland near Loch Doon and I left the children with Mother
and started to come back, within an hour." Her voice shook. "And
fancy your being in the house at the time!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the trouble, dear," said Mr. Norton. "Because of
your being away, a stupid tale got about that you had left me
because of Sir Roger and that I had shot him in revenge."</p>

<p>"How abominable!" exclaimed Margaret. She smiled at Stone.
"But I suppose you had come to investigate it?"</p>

<p>The inspector nodded uneasily. "Y-es, that's it,
Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;" he hesitated&mdash;"Mrs. Norton. In matters
like this we have to investigate everything we hear."</p>

<p>Larose stepped forward and raised his hat. "I am very sorry,
Mrs. Norton," he said, "but I am afraid it is all my fault that
we are here. My name's Larose and I'm another inspector from
Scotland Yard." He shook his head vexatiously. "I've been badly
taken in. Yesterday I went down to a little village on the coast
and met a lady there who admitted to me she had left her husband
for Sir Roger Hake. She led me to believe she was a Mrs. Norton.
Naturally, I thought she must be you. Then when she went on to
say her husband would commit murder if he knew about Sir
Roger,"&mdash;he made a grimace&mdash;"we began wondering if he
had found out, and so had to come down here and enquire."</p>

<p>Margaret had listened with widely opened eyes. "But why did
she say she was me?"</p>

<p>Larose hesitated. "We-ll, it was I who first suggested it and
then she let me think I was right." He spoke quickly. "You see
I'd had a description of you," he smiled, "as being grey-eyed
and of very nice appearance. So when I saw the lady whom I had
already learnt was a great friend of Sir Roger had grey eyes and
was very pleasant to look at, I jumped to the conclusion she
might be you. Then, of course, to prevent my knowing whom she
really was she let me fall into my own trap."</p>

<p>"But it's all right now, sir!" exclaimed Mr. Norton
laughingly. "You needn't look so apologetic, for I'm sure my
wife will forgive you since you've referred to her as
good-looking."</p>

<p>Everyone laughed and the tension at once relieved, Mr.
Norton, unmindful now of his appointment with his bailiff,
insisted they should come into the house and partake of some
refreshment. When they took their leave a little later everyone
was smiling and on the best of terms.</p>

<p>"Very sorry, you two," apologised Larose as they were driving
away. "I came a bloomer, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Never mind, son," said Stone. "Those two men I sent down
were fools. Fancy them telling us Margaret Brendon's name was
Andover, just because her mum is Mrs. Andover now! It never
entered into their silly heads that the mother might have
married again. Now, as quick as you can go to Bradwell and we'll
be darned lucky if that other woman is still there."</p>

<p>But they were not lucky, as she had locked up the bungalow
and left the previous afternoon. Stone was impatient to get back
to town but, greatly to his annoyance, Larose alighted in the
village, and according to Stone's watch, spent no less than
seventeen and a half minutes gossiping in the little general
store where the newspapers were sold.</p>

<p>"What did you find out in all that time?" he growled.</p>

<p>"Quite a little bit," nodded Larose. "Mr. Hale has had the
bungalow for about six months but only three people, all
females, have been noticed to come there, his wife, the woman
who does the cleaning and, if you please, one of his daughters.
This daughter was the first one to come there and the woman
describes her as being small, with auburn hair and very pretty.
She says the girl only came once and only stopped two days,
going off on the bicycle one afternoon when her father was
having an afternoon sleep. He came enquiring for her in the
village when he woke up, and was very angry to find she wasn't
there. He hadn't known she was going away and said she must have
got tired of the loneliness."</p>

<p>Stone nodded significantly. "Some tragedy there, I should
say." He made a gesture of disgust. "We're looking for the
murderer to get him hanged and yet it really ought to be to give
him a reward."</p>

<p>Inspector Carter made one of his rare contributions to the
conversation. "Our morning's not been altogether wasted," he
remarked thoughtfully. "Certainly, it's exploded the particular
motive we thought we'd found for Norton's killing the man, but I
wouldn't say he mayn't have had another, for of one thing I'm
certain. If he didn't kill him, he knows who did. When you said
you had found out who was the killer his face got pale and he
looked downright ill. Then when you went on to accuse him,
because Sir Roger had taken his wife, he was relieved at once.
He saw you were right off the target there."</p>

<p>"Good for you, Elias!" exclaimed Stone heartily. "I noticed
the change in him, but hadn't thought of it long enough to work
out the reason as you have done. What do you say, Gilbert?"</p>

<p>Larose considered. "I think Elias is right. At any rate, this
Norton's not off my list yet, although, as I confess, I rather
like the man. Well, I'll drop you both at the Yard and then I'm
going down to the Court again. I've got another idea, and
besides I can give them back the key of the study door. It's no
good keeping the room locked up any longer."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; THE GUTTERED CANDLE.</h2>

<p class="first">
LATER, that same afternoon, when Larose arrived at Hake
Court, as he had expected it was Huntley who opened the door to
him. "Here, I want a word with you," he said smilingly. "No, you
needn't look worried. It's not about yourself this time but
about that young girl who used to be here, Elsie Bane, the
parlourmaid."</p>

<p>For the moment the butler's face had changed from uneasiness
at the reappearance of Larose to annoyance, seemingly, at the
mention of the girl's name, but he quickly resumed his habitual
air of respect and proceeded to lead the way into a small room
opening out of the big lounge hall.</p>

<p>"What do you want to know about her, sir," he asked quietly.
"Why do you come to me?"</p>

<p>"I want to find out where she is," replied Larose, "and I
came to you because I've heard you and she were good
friends."</p>

<p>Huntley nodded. "We were friends, sir," he sighed, "and I
would give a lot to know where she is now. I'm afraid something
has happened to her."</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it," said Larose, "and I'll see what I can
do. Let me know exactly what happened."</p>

<p>"She left here, sir, on February eighth," said the butler.
"Mrs. Rawson, the housekeeper in Berkeley Square, had sent away
one of the maids there and she said she couldn't get another
suitable one for the time being. Elsie didn't want to go,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Were you and she engaged?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Not exactly, sir, but we were soon going to be. Well, sir,
Elsie went up to town and I never had a line from her
afterwards, although she had promised to write often. Then, less
than a fortnight later we heard she had suddenly dismissed
herself and no one knew where she had gone. That is the last
anyone has heard of her."</p>

<p>"And you don't believe this story of her going away herself
is true?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"No, sir, no one believes it," replied Huntley. "It wasn't
like Elsie. She wasn't that kind of girl. She was sensitive and
very gentle."</p>

<p>"And what do you think?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>The butler looked very stern. "I haven't the slightest
evidence in proof of it, sir, and it would have gone badly with
him long before this if I had," he spoke very slowly, "but, I
believe, sir, my late master had something to do with it.
Unfortunately, he had become attracted by her appearance."</p>

<p>"Did she tell you that herself?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Not exactly, sir, but she said he had lately taken notice of
her and been very polite. You see, she was very clever in
arranging flowers and Mistress used to give her all those which
came in from the garden to arrange in the vases. That brought
her in Master's way."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then Larose asked. "Have you
tried to find her?"</p>

<p>Huntley shook his head. "I didn't know where to start, sir.
She came from the Wanstead Orphanage and had never heard of her
parents. She hadn't a relation in the world that she knew
of."</p>

<p>"But hadn't she any friends to whom she may have gone?"</p>

<p>"She had only one friend that I know of, and I don't know her
name. It was a girl she'd met when she was at Wanstead and this
girl had married and gone to live somewhere in Norfolk, I don't
know where."</p>

<p>"Have you got a photograph of Elsie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, would you like to see it? I'll go and fetch
it."</p>

<p>The photo proved to be an enlarged snapshot, and showed a
decidedly pretty girl of graceful figure, standing against the
wall of a small back garden. "She gave it to me, sir," said
Huntley, with a choke in his voice, "only about a month before
she left. It was taken just before she came into service here,
and when she was staying in Norfolk with this friend I have
mentioned."</p>

<p>"She looks clever as well as pretty," commented Larose.</p>

<p>"Oh, she is clever, sir! She always said the Orphanage people
never ought to have put her into private service. She was very
artistic and was always drawing roses and lillies and other
flowers. As for being pretty, sir, this photo doesn't do her
justice. Her colouring was so good, with auburn hair and blue
eyes."</p>

<p>Larose lowered his own eyes and frowned uncomfortably. Auburn
hair and blue eyes! That was the description he had got in
Bradwell village of the girl whom Sir Roger had given out was
his daughter! Good God, what a tragedy for this man before
him&mdash;if he only knew!</p>

<p>It was almost as if the butler had sensed what was in
Larose's thoughts, for he went on with deep feeling: "If only I
could get her back, sir, I wouldn't mind what had happened to
her. I know she would never have gone wrong on her own
account."</p>

<p>Larose eyed him very sternly. "And you want me to find her at
any cost?" he asked.</p>

<p>"At any cost, sir?" queried the butler, looking very
puzzled.</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Larose in great surprise, "haven't you
realised that our only interest in finding her will be with the
idea that it is she who shot Sir Roger? He had wronged her and
she came into the house that night to avenge herself upon
him."</p>

<p>The butler's face was a study and Larose thought that if ever
there were a case of a man thinking before he spoke, he had one
before him now. Huntley was searching hard and furiously for an
answer. At last he said, and he spoke very quietly, "I am not in
the least afraid, sir, for I know she would never have done
it."</p>

<p>"But she may not be able to prove that?" snapped Larose.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she will, sir," said Huntley, "for, of course,
there will be people who will be able to swear where she was
that night." Just the faintest suspicion of amusement came into
his face. "I haven't the slightest fear there, sir."</p>

<p>"All right," nodded Larose, "then you take the consequences.
Now let me have the photograph for a few days. Oh, one more
question! Of course, the story of why Elsie left Berkeley Square
came from the housekeeper there? And you don't believe it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, not a word of it. Mrs. Rawson is a bad woman and
would do anything Sir Roger told her to&mdash;for money. If
Master harmed poor Elsie then I'm certain she made it easy for
him."</p>

<p>"Well, that finishes you, Mr. Huntley," smiled Larose; "at
any rate for the time being. Now will you please go and ask her
ladyship if I can speak to her. You may tell her I will only
keep her a very few minutes."</p>

<p>Larose was left waiting for quite a quarter of an hour and
then, instead of being taken to Lady Hake, she came to him
herself.</p>

<p>She looked pale but very pretty, and he thought with a pang
of the questions he was going to ask her. "I'm very sorry to
come to you again so soon," he said, "but, unhappily, I can't
help it."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose you can't," she said wearily. "I know I've got
some dreadful times before me, but, of course, I shall have to
put up with them."</p>

<p>"But they won't be so very dreadful," said Larose, "and if
you are quite frank with us there will probably be no need for
you to be called at the adjourned inquest."</p>

<p>"I have been quite frank with you," she said sharply.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you have," nodded Larose, "and I only want you to
go on being so. First, it's about that Elsie Bane I want to ask
you. Now do you give her a good character?"</p>

<p>"Elsie Bane!" exclaimed Lady Hake. "What do you want to know
about her for?"</p>

<p>"Because we are wondering if she came into the house and
fired that dreadful shot. You see, she would know where the
pistol was, she would know Sir Roger's habit of going into his
study the last thing at night, and she would know where to hide
herself away afterwards."</p>

<p>Lady Hake's voice was cold and cutting. "What should she want
to shoot my husband for?"</p>

<p>Larose turned away his eyes. Now for it, he thought. He would
have to speak very plainly. He spoke as casually as if he were
speaking about the weather. "Because he may have wronged her,"
he said. "Of course, we know there have been many of the other
sex in Sir Roger's life and a man cannot go on for ever like
that without making enemies." It seemed almost as if he were
stifling a yawn. "So we are wondering if Elsie Bane was
one."</p>

<p>A long silence followed, with Larose continuing to keep his
eyes turned away. Then Lady Hake said calmly and with no trace
of emotion. "Elsie was a good girl and I can't imagine her
shooting anyone. She was of a superior class."</p>

<p>"Was it you who had her transferred to Berkeley Square,"
asked Larose.</p>

<p>The answer was slow in coming. "No, my husband and Mrs.
Rawson arranged that."</p>

<p>"Then didn't you think there was something strange about her
dismissing herself and going off in the way Mrs. Rawson has made
out she did?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did."</p>

<p>"You were suspicious?"</p>

<p>"I was; it wasn't like Elsie."</p>

<p>"But you asked no questions?"</p>

<p>"What was the good? No, I had learnt to shut my eyes. You
can't alter a man's nature by letting him see you suspect
him."</p>

<p>"Now another thing. Do you like Mrs. Rawson?"</p>

<p>"No, certainly not!" The answer was emphatic there. "I shall
dismiss her at once when I get things into my own hands."</p>

<p>Larose was still looking out of the window. "About that
bruise you have on your arm which you made out was a dragon-fly
sting, of course Sir Roger gave it to you?"</p>

<p>A long silence followed and then came a faint 'yes.'</p>

<p>Larose turned his head sharply and his eyes were now fixed
intently upon her as he asked his next question with great
sternness. "And when Mr. Harland came in to fetch those
cigarettes that night you showed him the bruise and told him
your husband had done it?" He raised one forefinger warningly.
"Now answer truthfully, understanding I am going to put the same
question to Mr. Harland."</p>

<p>Her face went pale as death, her eyes stared and her mouth
opened. Larose watched her without a muscle of his face moving
and his eyes narrowed under his frowning brows. She looked
terrified. He rose to his feet and walked over to the
window.</p>

<p>"Poor little woman," he murmured, "but I had to ask her."</p>

<p>Quite a minute passed before he turned round. The face of the
young widow was now quite composed, and its ashy-grey appearance
had passed away.</p>

<p>"Well," he asked, "you haven't yet answered my question."</p>

<p>"Was there any need for me to answer it?" she asked coldly,
and then she added with some spirit: "Surely you should have
seen enough of me by now to realise I am not the sort of woman
to expose my shame to a man who is almost a stranger." Her eyes
flashed. "I have learnt to keep my troubles to myself."</p>

<p>"And that's the best way," nodded Larose.</p>

<p>"Now," she went on sharply, "you shall go and ask Mr. Harland
himself&mdash;" she looked contemptuous&mdash;"as you said you
intended to."</p>

<p>She pushed upon the bell and, after a short silence, which
Larose made no attempt to break, the butler appeared.</p>

<p>"Mr. Harland is in the office?" she asked. "Is he alone?"</p>

<p>"I think so, your ladyship," replied Huntley.</p>

<p>"Then take this gentleman in to see him, at once," she
ordered, and Larose was dismissed with a curt bow.</p>

<p>It was quite a long way to the secretary's office, and Larose
realised for the first time what a lot of ground the house
covered. They went down one long passage, up a few stairs, along
a short passage, down some stairs, and then along another long
passage right to the very end. Also Huntley took his time, and
did not walk quickly. Once, too, he stopped and pointed out
through a window. "That's the old chapel over there, sir," he
said. "It's said to be four hundred years old." He smiled. "It's
not been used much lately," but Larose was not interested, and
motioned him to walk on.</p>

<p>The door of the office was ajar when they reached it, and
young Harland was speaking upon the 'phone when Larose was
ushered into the room. The secretary raised his eyebrows ever so
little at seeing the detective and then, pointing out a chair to
him, continued his conversation on the 'phone. The telephone was
a desk one.</p>

<p>"Certainly . . . Yes!. . . Yes!. . . Of course, of course!. .
. Naturally things will be very unsettled for a little while. .
. Well, good morning."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and turned to Larose. "Well, sir," he
said a little brusquely, "what is it you want to know now?"</p>

<p>Larose pointed to the 'phone he had just been using. "A house
one?" he suggested smilingly, and a faint pink suffused the
young man's face as he noddingly admitted that it was. "And may
I ask who was speaking to you?" asked Larose very politely.</p>

<p>"One of the gardeners," replied Harland. He dismissed the
matter quickly, and forced a smile upon his face. "Now, Mr.
Larose," he asked, "what more questions are you going to ask
me?"</p>

<p>"One very important one," said Larose, "and it is this." He
paused a long moment, noticing that young Harland had stiffened
himself in his chair, was assuming a wooden expression and was
clenching his hands tightly together. He went on slowly. "Do you
remember hearing Mr. Norton join in the conversation when the
lights were out? Don't forget he was sitting next to you."</p>

<p>The secretary's hands unclenched, his whole body seemed to
relax and the expression upon his face became a definite one. He
spoke slowly and emphatically. "I do remember. I am certain I
heard him speak. I am quite sure about it."</p>

<p>"Still, that doesn't prove," commented Larose, "that he
didn't shoot Sir Roger. I am still unconvinced that it was
impossible for anyone to have left that room. So he may have
done it and come back." He regarded Harland intently. "You know,
if Mr. Norton did not kill him, I'd almost stake my life he
thinks he knows who did."</p>

<p>Harland shook his head slowly. "But I don't see how that's
possible," his face brightened, "unless whoever did it has
confessed to him."</p>

<p>"But why should he have confessed to him?" queried Larose.
"Whoever was the murderer, why should he have confessed to
anyone, unless he were proud of it and intending to give himself
up?"</p>

<p>Harland shook his head again. "It's no good your propounding
such puzzles to me, Mr. Larose, for I'm not equal to them." He
spoke sharply. "But just take this in, sir, once and for all,"
his voice rose slightly, "you can't accuse me or Mr. Norton or
anyone of the others in the card-room that night, unless you
accuse the whole lot of us. Either we are all innocent or else
we are all guilty. As I have told you, we talked the matter
over, fully, and are all convinced that no one left the room
after Sir Roger went out."</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "Then that leaves only her ladyship, the
butler, and the suppositious person hiding in the house, with
the strength of suspicion against them in that order, Lady Hake
being most suspected, then Huntley, and last 'an unknown
murderer.'"</p>

<p>Larose had expected a violent outburst of protest from the
young fellow, but nothing of the kind happened. Instead, Harland
just smiled contemptuously. "The evidence of Doctor King-Harley
will definitely clear her ladyship," he said. "She absolutely
collapsed when she was told of her husband's death, and the most
consummate actress in the world cannot make herself pulseless,
as the doctor says she was, at will."</p>

<p>"Then the butler?" suggested Larose, wanting to turn Harland
inside out, now the latter seemed to be in the mood.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing there, either," frowned Harland. "We'll all
swear that his surprise was a hundred per cent real."</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door and upon the secretary calling
out 'come in,' to the amazement of them both, Lady Hake entered.
She gave a quick, peculiar little look from one to the other of
them, and then, after a slight nod to Harland addressed Larose.
"I wanted to be sure and catch you before you left," she said.
She spoke very coldly. "If you still doubt my word when I told
you Elsie Bane was a girl of good character, the thought has
just come to me that you couldn't do better than apply to the
Superintendent of the Wanstead Orphanage. She was there for two
years, first as one of the orphans and then, later, as a private
maid to the Matron. They will speak for her and, perhaps," she
looked sarcastic, "you are more likely to believe them than
me."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Larose politely. "I am sure I am very much
obliged to you. I'll do as you say." Then, wanting to detain her
and see how she and the secretary acted when they were together,
he went on quickly, "But now you're here, Lady Hake, you may be
able to help me in another way. We were discussing Mr. Norton
when you came in, and tell me&mdash;would you say he was
friendlily disposed towards Sir Roger?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he have been?" she asked frowningly,</p>

<p>"We-ll!" hesitated Larose, "I was wondering if they were
rivals in any way."</p>

<p>"You mean for Mrs. Norton's affections?" she asked. "You
think Mr. Norton was jealous of my husband?" She spoke
cuttingly. "That's your trouble, Mr. Larose, you think too
much," and with a curt little bow she let herself out of the
room.</p>

<p>Larose looked meaningly in the direction of the door. "She
came in to see if we were quarrelling," he smiled. "Funny how
the sharpest people sometimes give themselves away!" Then, as
the secretary made no comment and had turned his eyes upon some
papers on his desk as if he were anxious to get on with his
work, he continued, "She's got plenty of spirit, that girl, and
would be quite capable of anything." He sighed. "And if she did
shoot him, I shouldn't altogether blame her."</p>

<p>Harland looked up instantly. "Who would?" he demanded. Then,
seemingly annoyed with himself for his remark, he added quickly:
"But she didn't. That is quite impossible!"</p>

<p>Larose drew a bow at a venture. "And do you know, Mr.
Harland, you have just put an idea into my head. You said you
card-players were either all innocent or all guilty." He bent
forward significantly towards him. "Now why shouldn't you all be
guilty?"</p>

<p>Harland regarded him, frowning heavily. "What do you mean?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Larose smiled blandly. "Well, one of you shot the man and the
others are perjuring themselves to save him." He looked amused.
"You see, I am being quite frank with you."</p>

<p>"Frank's not a suitable word," said Harland quietly. "If it
would not be rude I should suggest, 'mad' as being more
appropriate." He raised his voice scoffingly. "And you think six
level-headed, disinterested men would risk their skins to save a
seventh whom they hardly knew? None of us there were really
friendly with one another and we most of us were mere
acquaintances." He shrugged his shoulders. "Speaking for myself,
I had never even seen three of them before that night."</p>

<p>"But why particularise yourself?" asked Larose, eyeing him
very intently.</p>

<p>Harland was quite candid. "Because you've got me in your
mind, of course." He laughed. "You've not come down here to ask
me about Mr. Norton. You've come to get a line on me myself." He
warmed up. "No doubt you think here's a young man who knows a
pretty girl is being very badly treated. He's on the spot and
must guess a lot more even than he actually sees. So, what is
more natural than that he should have been the one to shoot the
beast of a husband?" He spoke bitterly. "I'm not a fool. Of
course, I should be the one to be most suspected!"</p>

<p>"You think so?" asked Larose quite pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I do," replied Harland. He nodded. "But you're a bit puzzled
all the same. You've got Lady Hake and Huntley in your mind,
too." He looked Larose straight in the face. "But I didn't do
it, and neither of them did it either."</p>

<p>Larose smiled. "Well, who are we to fasten it on to?" he
asked. "It must have been someone."</p>

<p>The secretary bent forward earnestly. "Do you realise, sir,
that you may have started off wrong from the very beginning?" He
raised his hand impressively. "You have banked everything on
that Superintendent's nose. He says he smelt cordite directly he
was taken to see the body, and therefore that the pistol must
have been fired in the room. But what if he was wrong? Look at
the possibilities it opens up. He may have been shot by someone
outside, who left no footmarks on the gravelled drive?"</p>

<p>Larose looked sceptical. "But how would anyone have managed
to get into the study to get the pistol without leaving
footmarks in the flower-bed under the window?"</p>

<p>"The pistol mayn't have been in the study at all. Sir Roger
may have left it in the summer-house. I've known it left there
before. The target he used to fire at is on a large oak tree
about twenty yards away. Sometimes, if it was raining, he would
sit in the summer-house and fire from the seat there. Everyone
here can tell you that."</p>

<p>Larose frowned. "But what about those dogs? We are told they
would allow no stranger in the grounds."</p>

<p>"But how can they be everywhere?" asked Harland. "The walled
grounds cover nearly fifty acres and from what I've seen of the
animals, directly they're loosed, they go and stand with their
noses poked through the bars of the gates. A man across the road
breeds cocker-spaniels, and these Livonians here are interested.
Another thing, too, directly it rains the dogs take cover. They
go into the summer-houses, there are four of them, or else into
the sheds. They always seem to keep together."</p>

<p>"Hum!" remarked Larose very thoughtfully. "You're
interesting, young fellow!"</p>

<p>"And do you still think I did it?" asked Harland, now smiling
for the first time.</p>

<p>Larose considered. "Yes&mdash;and no," he replied. He smiled.
"But now, more no than yes." He spoke quickly. "And one more
question." He took in the good-looking face, the aristocratic
profile, the eyes which spoke of courage, the firm strong chin
and the sensitive, yet withal, humorously tender mouth. A nice
boy, he thought, and one of whom any girl might be proud and by
whom she would be made happy. He rapped out his question
sharply. "Are you in love with her?"</p>

<p>Harland smiled sadly.</p>

<p>"What man who has seen her is not?"</p>

<p>Larose got briskly to his feet. "Well, I'll just go and have
one last look round the study and then give up the key. We
shan't be wanting it any more. Now the way back to the hall is
right along the passage, up those few steps
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," interrupted Harland, "that's a long way round.
Don't go up those steps at all. Take the first turning to the
right. It's much shorter," and they shook hands in parting, in a
most friendly way.</p>

<p>Larose met the butler in the hall. "Here," he said sternly,
"what the devil did you take me all that way round for?"</p>

<p>"To show you that chapel, sir," replied Huntley most
politely. "I thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you thought all right," snapped Larose, "and that's
why you did it." He spoke very sternly. "You were listening at
that door, Huntley, when I was talking to your mistress."</p>

<p>Huntley looked very aggrieved. "I wouldn't think of doing
such a thing, sir. I know my place better than to dream of doing
that."</p>

<p>Larose did not labour the matter. He had no proof and knew he
would never get any. Really, he told himself, he was suspecting
everyone of everything. "I'm going into the study," he said,
"and when I've finished I'll give you the key to take to your
mistress."</p>

<p>Entering the room, it smelt close and musty, but he did not
open the windows and neither did he draw up the blinds. Instead,
he switched on the lights and, sinking back into an armchair,
let his eyes rove round everywhere. Except for the body having
been taken away and a rug thrown over the blood-stain upon the
carpet where the body had lain, the room was exactly as it had
been left when the investigating detectives had finished with
it.</p>

<p>He began talking softly to himself. 'There, through that door
came the murdered man, not murdered then but in the pride of his
strength and lust of life. He came in cupping a lighted match in
his hand, for without doubt a breeze had risen with the coming
of the rain, and there was a draught blowing from the open
window. For the same reason, no doubt, he would have pushed to
the library door behind him. He picked up the torch upon his
desk and lit one of those candles on the mantel-shelf, the one
nearest to the library door. We know he did that because it is
guttered by the draught from the window; the drops of wax have
run down one side of the candle, the side away from the window.
The parlourmaid, Janet, yes Janet is her name, is sure it was
not guttered before that night or she would have noticed it and
picked off the blobs of untidy-looking wax. Then&mdash;what did
he do next?'</p>

<p>Larose half closed his eyes and let his thoughts have full
rein. Then, suddenly, he frowned, a slightly puzzled frown at
first, which soon, however, became a very puzzled one. He opened
his eyes widely, and sat up straight in his chair. 'Gad,' he
exploded suddenly, 'but why the devil did he light that candle
at all? He had said he was coming in for his torch and there it
was all ready to his hand upon the desk. He didn't even pick it
up. We know that because there was not a single finger-mark upon
it. The girl had rubbed her duster over it in the morning. Then
why didn't he pick it up, if he had come in expressly for
it?'</p>

<p>A thought striking him, he rose quickly to his feet and,
striding over to the desk, picked up the torch. He pressed on
the button, but nothing happened. The light did not come on. He
stood staring at the torch, with his mouth open. Almost, it
might have been thought, he was expecting it to speak.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he whistled. 'Gad,' he exclaimed again, 'he did
pick it up, but he found the batteries were dead and so lit the
candle. That accounts for the second match we found in the
grate. He had to strike another one to light the candle.' He
caught his breath. 'Oh, hell, and as there were no finger-marks
upon this torch, it means that someone had wiped them off, wiped
them off because he had perhaps picked it up himself and was
making sure he should leave no clue behind! Now, let me think.
Let me think.'</p>

<p>He threw himself down in the armchair again. 'So he lit that
candle, but he did not take it in his hand to light him from the
room because, again, there are no finger-marks upon the
candlestick. Janet had dusted that, too, that morning.'</p>

<p>He thought hard. 'What happened? I have only three minutes to
account for, as the darkness lasted six minutes and it is
computed Sir Roger spent the first three of them in the library,
waiting with the others for the lights to go up. He must have
been shot during those second three minutes of darkness, because
if he had been alive when the lights had gone up
again&mdash;surely he would have returned to the card-players.
Besides, it was no longer thundering when the light came
on.'</p>

<p>He pressed his hands over his forehead, springing up
suddenly, however, to stride over to the mantel-shelf and
examine the candles, both of them this time. Then, with a low
quick intent movement, he moved the two candlesticks together,
so that they stood side by side. He noted with a frown that the
guttered one must have been burning quite an appreciable time
longer than the other. A moment's consideration and he lit the
unguttered candle, taking out his watch to time how long it
would take for it to burn down until it was exactly level with
its fellow. To make the surroundings as near as possible to
those of the fatal night, he opened the window.</p>

<p>'Quite a little breeze,' he nodded, 'and this other candle
will gutter in the draught.' He sat down to wait.</p>

<p>The minutes passed slowly and the room was very quiet and
still. Oh, if only the walls could speak and give up the secret
which they held! What would their story be? A white-faced woman,
with blazing eyes, killing in a white-hot passion for her
revenge, or a man in cold fury carrying out a righteous judgment
as if it were an act of God, or, yet again, a wronged husband
avenging his wife's stolen honour? Who would ever know.</p>

<p>The time dragged on slowly until after twenty minutes he was
at last satisfied that the candles were now of equal height,
with the guttering almost identically the same.</p>

<p>'Now let me reconstruct everything,' he murmured, 'as far as
it is possible from what we know. At eleven-thirty-two the
lights failed and did not come on again, until eleven-thirty-eight.
Of those six minutes of darkness it is estimated Sir
Roger passed three in his chair by the card-table. In the course
of the next three he went into the study, lit the candle and was
shot during that last loud peal of thunder, just before the
lights went up. He must have been shot during that peal of
thunder as, otherwise, with all the inmates of the Court
awakened with their windows wide open, the noise of the firing
would certainly have been heard by someone. Yes, we can be quite
sure that it was by the light of that candle the assassin took
aim and shot him. Then what happened?'</p>

<p>He leant back in his chair and thought hard. 'Why,' he asked
slowly, 'was that candle left burning for twenty minutes?
Knowing as we do that Sir Roger lit it when he went into the
study, say at eleven-thirty-five, those twenty minutes would
bring us up to eleven-fifty-five, only seven minutes before the
telephone rang in the police-station?' His eyes were all screwed
up in his perplexity. 'Then that means that when Huntley opened
the study door he would have instantly seen his murdered master
lying right before him, without any switching on of the light.
But, with the door open, the interior of the room was in part
view of all the seven card-players, and they all confirm
Huntley's testimony that the room was in pitch darkness when he
went in. Then are they all lying, Huntley and these seven
men?'</p>

<p>His thoughts ran on. 'But, in any case, that does not explain
why the candle was still left burning after the lights went up.
It leaves things just as unexplainable as&mdash;&mdash;' But he
suddenly snapped his fingers together in exultation. 'I have it!
I have it! The candle was not put out because, in his hurry to
escape from the room, the murderer did not switch off the
electric light, and with that on, he would not have noticed that
the candle was still burning!'</p>

<p>His exultation was, however, short-lived, and he was soon
looking as puzzled as ever. 'But who was it,' he asked ruefully,
'who did put out both the candle and the electric light? Did the
murderer, remembering his mistake, creep back in the very nick
of time and plunge the room into darkness again, just before
Huntley came in? Oh, what a mystery! What a puzzle!'</p>

<p>He thought for a long time and at last gave it up for the
time being. 'And it's no good my waiting here any longer,' he
sighed. 'I've found out something, but just what it means I
don't know. I'll have to think it over.'</p>

<p>He let himself out of the room, and locking the door behind
him, looked for a bell in the hall so that he could summon the
butler and pass over the key to him to take to his mistress.</p>

<p>Then all at once Lady Hake herself appeared from the dining-room,
so suddenly that the idea instantly flashed into his mind
that she had been waiting for him. Greatly to his surprise, she
smiled graciously when he gave her the key.</p>

<p>"You must be tired," she said. "Would you like some
refreshment? Would you like a cup of tea?" and something in the
way she spoke suggested to him that she wanted him to say
yes.</p>

<p>So he smilingly accepted, and greatly to his surprise again,
she had some with him and they sat on either side of a small
table in the big lounge. They talked of the weather and of the
flowers in the vases for a few minutes, and he thought many
times, that with all her sad expression, how really lovely she
was. He told himself he would like to go on looking at her for
hours. Then suddenly she said apologetically, "I'm afraid I've
been very curt with you, Mr. Larose, but you must overlook it in
the great trouble I am going through."</p>

<p>"I've nothing to overlook," smiled Larose. "I expected you
would be much more put out than you were at the questions I had
to ask you."</p>

<p>"I realise now it's no good my pretending I'd been living
happily with my husband," she went on. She spoke bitterly.
"Everyone seems to have known I was a very miserable woman." She
looked him straight in the face. "Tell me, are people saying I
shot him?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head and fibbed resolutely. "Certainly not,"
he said. "No one would think that. The shooting was no woman's
work."</p>

<p>Her eyes were still intently upon him. "And do you suspect
Mr. Harland?" she asked, and he could sense she was holding
herself in with a great effort.</p>

<p>Then, on the instant, it came to him in a most uneasy
realisation that there might be yet more tragedy in store for
this unhappy girl. Harland had admitted he was in love with her
and now, by the very way she was acting, an intuition told him
the feelings were returned. God, if they were already lovers and
the slightest inkling of it got abroad then Harland would be the
focus of all suspicion!</p>

<p>He was so slow in answering her question that she repeated it
and a little sharply now. "Do you suspect Mr. Harland?" she
reiterated.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said. "I was thinking." He spoke with
an assumption of frankness. "Not in particular, not more than
any of those others who were in the library." He smiled. "You
see we can't well suspect any of them without suspecting the
whole lot, as they all back one another up in declaring none of
them left the room."</p>

<p>She drew in a deep breath. "And are you," she asked
hesitatingly, "are you the one who decides?"</p>

<p>He looked puzzled. "Decides what?" he asked. "Oh, decides in
what direction we must continue to look!" He laughed. "Bless
your heart, no! All of us at the Yard pool the ideas which come
to us and then sometimes one of us gets a brain-wave and we all
act upon it."</p>

<p>She hesitated again. "B-ut I've heard your opinion carries a
lot of weight with them in London."</p>

<p>He shook his head smilingly. "Not overmuch! Just now my
opinion is that this may turn out to be one of those cases where
the mystery is never solved. We may never learn who fired that
fatal shot."</p>

<p>He left her, he thought, much brighter. She herself saw him
to the front door and gave him a wistful little smile as he
drove away. 'Gilbert, Gilbert,' he murmured, as he turned his
car towards London, 'you ought never to have come into the
Police! Justice and not Law is your mistress! You don't want to
find that boy guilty because of those eyes of hers!' He snapped
his teeth together viciously. 'But how the devil can he be
guilty with those six other men swearing he never left the room?
Heavens, what a puzzle!' He nodded. 'But I'll track down that
little Elsie Bane now, and see if she can tell us anything.
Auburn or red hair in a girl always makes her a bit of a
devil!'</p>

<p>Having mentioned nothing to his colleagues of his discovery
of the guttered candle, the significance of which was still
evading him, the following morning he set out upon his journey
into Norfolk to pick up Elsie Bane.</p>

<p>With the little he had learnt about her, it might have been
considered that his task was quite a hopeless one, but that was
by no means the view he was taking of it. On the contrary, he
was of opinion he had a good sporting chance of finding her, as
he was practically certain she would have gone to that one girl
friend of hers who lived in Norfolk.</p>

<p>Upon his return to the Yard the previous evening, sitting
alone in his room, he had thought everything over most carefully
and in the end had been by no means dissatisfied with his
prospects. First, he had examined the photograph the butler had
given him under a powerful magnifying glass and summed up what
it told him.</p>

<p>He decided at once that Elsie's friend's house was situated
in a city. The garden was narrow and therefore he argued it
would be small, suggesting land that was valuable and which
meant, of course, it was certainly not in a village or probably
not even in a little town. No, the garden looked as if it
belonged to a good-class working-man's house, perhaps one of
many others all in a row in the suburbs of some city.</p>

<p>He had arrived at this opinion before he decided that the
faint lines in one corner of the photograph in the distance
above the garden wall, were the overhead lines of trams or
trolley-buses. He was very pleased with himself there, for that
would narrow down the search tremendously, as he knew that in
Norfolk there were only trams or trolley-buses in Great Yarmouth
and Norwich. Agriculture was the main industry of the county,
and out of Norwich it contained no manufacturing centres.</p>

<p>So to Norwich he would go first, but arrived there, what was
he to do? The girl had always been expressing her distaste for
domestic service, and her experiences at Hake Court were not
likely to have taken away any of that objection so, of course,
she would most probably try to get a position in a shop. But she
was unskilled in every trade! No, no, she wasn't! She had a
natural gift for arranging flowers. Yes, she loved flowers, so
what would be more probable than that she would try for some
work among them? At any rate, that would be her first thought
and with her nice appearance she might have had some luck and
been successful.</p>

<p>He smiled grimly to himself. It was a long shot, but in
pursuit of the criminal classes he had often brought such a one
off. Arriving in Norwich, learning from a friendly policeman
where the best flower-shops were, he paid a visit to each one of
them. Either he bought a buttonhole or else made certain he
could get a good view of the assistants through the window. But
he saw no sign of a girl answering to the description of Elsie
Bane among them, and he did not think it wise to ask after her
by name. If and when he found her, he wanted to make himself and
his errand known when she was by herself. Above all things he
did not want to give her a shock when others were present.</p>

<p>His search so far fruitless, a new idea struck him and he
enquired of another policeman which florist in the city had the
largest trade in funeral wreaths. He was told Smith, in Castle
Street, made more of them than all the other shops put
together.</p>

<p>So six o'clock found him standing outside Smith's, waiting
for the employees to leave. Then, almost the first girl who came
out looked like what he expected Elsie Bane would look; a little
older perhaps, but with a nice complexion and rich auburn
hair.</p>

<p>'Here goes it,' he whispered exultingly. 'I'll chance it and
follow this little miss.'</p>

<p>The girl walked quickly along in the direction of the river,
and at a safe distance, he kept her in view. Then a great piece
of luck happened for she turned into Mortimer Park and sat down
upon a seat by the side of the ornamental pond. Then, from a
brown-paper bag of odds and ends of cake and bread, she threw
crumbs to attract the birds. He walked quietly up and sat down
upon the same seat, but not close near her. He lifted his hat
politely.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Miss Bane," he said, "but I've come a long way to
speak to you and this couldn't be a better place, for our talk
will be a very private one."</p>

<p>Her face was the picture of amazed distress, but he appeared
not to notice it and went on, "Really, I want particularly to
speak to you about Mr. Huntley, first. He's been very worried
about you and very hurt you've not written to him."</p>

<p>She drew in a deep breath, and rising abruptly to her feet,
started shaking the crumbs from her dress with the undoubted
intention of walking away.</p>

<p>He saw half measures would be of no good, and, accordingly,
changed his tone instantly. "No, don't go away," he said
sharply. "If you do, I shall only have to follow you and get
help." He spoke very sternly. "I'm a detective and come from
Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>She gave a little gasp and instantly resumed her seat. Her
face had paled and she looked very frightened. He returned to
his kinder tone and spoke quite friendlily. "No, you've no need
to be afraid. You can finish with the detective business with
one answer. Where were you last Monday, night?"</p>

<p>She answered him chokingly, but with no hesitation. "Here in
Norwich. I am living with friends."</p>

<p>"And of course that can be proved?" he went on.</p>

<p>She nodded, and he could just hear what she said. "Yes, I
went with them to the pictures that evening."</p>

<p>"Of course you know why I ask? You've read what happened in
the newspapers?"</p>

<p>She nodded again. "You mean about Sir Roger Hake?"</p>

<p>He pursed up his lips. "Yes, it was a very dreadful business,
and we haven't been able to find out who did it."</p>

<p>"But you didn't suspect me?" she asked looking very
horrified.</p>

<p>"You have to be accounted for," he replied. He spoke with as
much friendliness as he could. "But I'd better explain
everything. You see we know he got you down to that bungalow of
his at Bradwell and that you escaped from him. So, having
suffered so much from him, we thought it quite possible you got
into the Court that night and shot him for his punishment."</p>

<p>"But I tell you I didn't," she exclaimed wildly. She clenched
her teeth. "I hate him, but I would never have dared to do that,
however much I had wanted to."</p>

<p>"Then a word from your friend telling us where you were,"
nodded Larose, "will make that quite all right. But now about
Mr. Huntley. Why haven't you let him know where you are?"</p>

<p>She looked at him with her eyes wet with tears. "Would
<i>you,</i> after what has happened?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded again. "I would&mdash;with him. He guesses what
has happened, but does not believe it was your fault. He is sure
you are as good a girl as you always were, and were trapped
somehow."</p>

<p>"So I was," she choked. "It was that vile Mrs. Rawson who
helped him. She took me down to clean up the bungalow and then
after I'd had some tea I don't know what happened." Her words
came very slowly. "When I woke up in the night she had gone and
only Sir Roger was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough," said Larose. "And Mrs. Rawson gave it out
you had left of your own accord, in a great temper. Now about
Mr. Huntley. He's going to leave the Court and he wants you to
come back and marry him."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Oh, I couldn't."</p>

<p>Larose spoke crossly. "Of course you can! What do you want to
punish him for&mdash;because Sir Roger was a beast to you? It
isn't fair. No, it isn't. Now, you take me to your friends and
they'll just verify about last Monday. Then I'll go back and
tell Mr. Huntley you're going to write to him. He'll be a
delighted man."</p>

<p>'And that finishes with little Elsie,' said Larose to
himself, when that night he was having dinner in a hotel in
Norwich, 'and if friend Huntley doesn't get hanged, I suppose
she'll marry him and they'll live happily ever afterwards.
Huntley'll make quite a good husband, although he's quite
capable of a thumping lie or two when it suits him.'</p>

<p>He sipped his wine meditatively. 'And what a lot of lies have
been told over this business! I'm as certain as ever I was of
anything that we've got the murderer in our hands and
yet&mdash;we can't put a name to him&mdash;' he hesitated a long
moment&mdash;'or her! Oh, if only I knew why that candle had
been allowed to burn for those twenty minutes! But one thing
about it stands out clearly&mdash;whoever blew it out was the
murderer! I can be quite certain of that.' He sighed. 'And how
everything in a way points to her little ladyship as being the
guilty one. She hated her husband, he had laid violent hands
upon her within a few hours of his death, and now she is
terrified that young Harland should be suspected of what he has
not done.' He nodded. 'Or she thinks&mdash;or knows he did it
and her terror is because he may be found out. So, in another
way everything points to Harland. He is in love with the wife,
he knows how vilely she is being treated by the husband, and he
has just seen her bruise! He returns to the library with the
cigarettes, white-hot in fury, he creeps after Sir Roger in the
darkness and he shoots him dead! He creeps back, unnoticed, to
the card-table!'</p>

<p>He shook his head vexatiously. 'But all that does not fit in.
The six other men swear Harland could not possibly have left the
room, and even if he had, to creep in again he would have had to
push open the study door and those in the darkness in the
library would certainly have seen the light of the candle behind
him. Besides, as I have convinced myself, over and over again,
Sir Roger was shot during that last peal of thunder just before
the lights went up. Yes, it's all most mysterious, but never say
die, and as I'm up this way I'll go back through Newmarket and
have a talk with that trainer man. He seemed quite intelligent
and I may get a fresh idea out of him,' he grinned, 'although I
don't suppose he'll be too pleased to see me. He didn't seem to
like having anything to do with the police that day.'</p>

<p>And, certainly, when he was shown into Martin Leeder the next
morning, the latter did not seem too happy about it, and frowned
most uneasily. Larose explained he had not made a special
journey but, being in the neighbourhood upon another matter, had
thought he would look in and just ask another question or
two.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Leeder," he went on, "if we could only prove
one of you left the room after Sir Roger the whole mystery would
be solved at once. Now are you sure none of you went out?"</p>

<p>"I've told you already that I don't think so," replied the
trainer testily. "I heard no one move and certainly no one
struck a match."</p>

<p>"But would that have been necessary?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>Leeder shrugged his shoulders. "If Sir Roger had to do it to
cross a room in his own house, wouldn't a stranger have found it
even more necessary?"</p>

<p>"Young Harland wasn't a stranger!" suggested Larose.</p>

<p>"He was much more so than Sir Roger," retorted Leeder.</p>

<p>Larose continued: "Well, if none of you seven did it, it
leaves only the butler and Lady Hake to be accounted for. One of
those two is guilty and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, keep Lady Hake out," broke in Leeder hotly. "I&mdash;I'd
stake my life she had nothing to do with it. It's&mdash;it's a
shame even to suspect her, the poor suffering woman which she
is."</p>

<p>He seemed so upset that, to ascertain more of what was in his
mind, Larose went on stressing the point. "But unhappily we
can't leave her out," he insisted. "We know the life Sir Roger
led her and she had good reason to wish him dead." He spoke
gloomily. "We may even have to arrest her on suspicion and then
her only hope of being proved innocent will be if the real
murderer comes forward and confesses he did it."</p>

<p>Leeder's face was now covered in perspiration, but he made no
comment. Larose looked very stern and added, "Then if we find
anyone has been shielding him he will be punished, too, as
having been an accessory to the crime after the act." He nodded.
"That is a very serious offence."</p>

<p>The trainer burst out irritably. "Oh, do go away, please. I'm
sick of the whole business. If you go on questioning me for a
week I can't tell you any more than I have done already." He
pulled out a big watch. "And I've got my work to do. So, good
morning."</p>

<p>'And I wouldn't like to swear that man doesn't know
something,' nodded Larose, as he drove off in the car. 'He'd got
the wind up and seemed to be thinking about himself as well as
her little ladyship.' He swore angrily. 'The devil of it, as
with them all, is there seems to be no way of making them
speak.'</p>

<p>He made his journey back by way of Saffron Walden and called
in at Crane Court to give Huntley the news about Elsie Bane. The
butler was overjoyed and his eyes filled with tears. "I'm so
very grateful to you, sir," he said hoarsely. He hesitated. "Was
she treated very badly, sir?"</p>

<p>"She was," nodded Larose gravely, "and that was the great
reason why she didn't write to you. She felt ashamed to. Another
reason, however, was she was afraid Sir Roger might get to learn
where she was living."</p>

<p>"What do you think I'd better do, sir?" asked Huntley
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Don't write," said Larose. "Go down and see her. It will
make it much easier for her to tell her story than to put it on
paper. She's been badly wronged, but if I know anything of
women, she's still a thoroughly good girl. As you thought, it
was that vile Mrs. Rawson who brought the trouble on her. She
drugged her."</p>

<p>The butler's face went all sorts of colours and his lips
moved although he did not speak.</p>

<p>Returning to the Yard, Larose told Stone about Elsie Bane and
the stout inspector breathed hard. "That's another one out of
it," he snorted. He made a gesture of disgust. "But they're all
out of it! Ay, and all still in it! I've been to see Byles
Chater and that Doctor King-Harley to-day. But what was the
good? They just stuck to their stories and there we are." He
clenched his fist. "And so, I suppose it will end. Another
failure for us, with the murderer sitting tight, and all the
while, grinning behind his wooden face." He heaved a tremendous
sigh. "It's no good, Gilbert, we're beaten. We're at a dead
end."</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; JUDGMENT.</h2>

<p class="first">
HUNTLEY obtained the Sunday off and went down to Norwich on
his motor-bicycle. He saw Elsie Bane and what passed between
them must have been satisfactory as he returned to Crane Court
that night, from his appearance, in quite a happy frame of
mind.</p>

<p>Finding his mistress had not yet gone up to her bedroom, he
went into the dining-room to speak to her. He told her he had
come to give notice and would be very sorry to leave her, but
when everything was settled&mdash;which was his delicate way of
referring to his late master and the forthcoming adjourned
inquest&mdash;he would like to go. Of course, however, he would
only leave when it was quite convenient for her ladyship.</p>

<p>"But why do you want to go, Huntley?" asked Lady Hake. "Is
there any special reason?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your ladyship," replied Huntley, "I'm going to be
married," and he added very solemnly, "to Elsie."</p>

<p>Lady Hake did not hide her astonishment. "Oh, then, you've
heard from her?" she exclaimed. "You've been to see her to-day."</p>

<p>"Yes, your ladyship," replied Huntley. "She's staying with a
friend of hers in Norwich. She's been there all the time. She's
working at a florist's."</p>

<p>Lady Hake's face flushed. Fully awakened to the fact, from
the questions Larose had put to her, that it was common rumour
with the servants her dead husband had been the cause of the
girl's disappearance and knowing the butler's feelings for
Elsie, she did not want to pursue the matter. At the same time,
however, she realised that if she made no comment it would be an
admission that she knew everything. So, she asked very quietly,
"Then she wrote to you?"</p>

<p>It was now the butler who got red. "N-o your ladyship," he
stammered, "the police found her."</p>

<p>"The police!" she exclaimed in startled surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, Inspector Larose did," replied Huntley uncomfortably.
He went on quickly, "You see, your ladyship, they wanted to find
out where she was that night when Master&mdash;when everything
happened. So Inspector Larose gave his whole attention to it and
he found out where she was at once."</p>

<p>"But how did he find out," asked his mistress, looking very
puzzled, "when no one had any idea where she had gone?"</p>

<p>Huntley related how the girl had been traced, some part of
which he had learnt from Larose and the rest from Elsie herself.
He finished up by adding, "He is a very clever man, this Mr.
Larose." It seemed that he heaved a big sigh. "They say he
always finds out everything in the end."</p>

<p>A short silence followed. Lady Hake's eyes were turned away
and it might almost have been she had not heard his closing
remark. However, she said at last, "But he seems a very
kind-hearted man, this inspector?"</p>

<p>"He is, your ladyship," agreed the butler heartily, "quite
different to all the others."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall be very sorry to lose you," she said with a
rather sad smile, "and if you want one, of course, I'll give you
a very good reference." She went on in a business-like tone,
"I'm glad you've come in to see me to-night, because I want some
papers to go up to the lawyers the first thing to-morrow
morning, and you can take them for me. I'd like you to leave as
early as possible."</p>

<p>"Very good, your ladyship," bowed Huntley, "I'll go into
Chelmsford on the motor-bicycle and catch the eight-thirty
express there. Then I'll be in Chancery Lane before half-past
nine."</p>

<p>Huntley always preferred to go up to Town that way; firstly
because it was quicker, and secondly, because by leaving his
machine in Chelmsford he avoided riding through the London
traffic.</p>

<p>The next morning, having arrived at Liverpool Street a few
minutes after nine, he was just emerging into the station yard
when a taxi drew up quickly and he saw Mrs. Rawson, the Berkeley
Square housekeeper, was inside it.</p>

<p>His face crimsoned up in fury at the sight of her. 'I'd
murder her if I got the chance,' he snarled. Curiosity now
tempered his rage. 'But where the devil is she going?'</p>

<p>Obviously she had not seen him and springing out of the taxi,
in frantic haste, almost before it had come to a standstill, she
beckoned to a porter to approach at once.</p>

<p>"Hi, you there!" called out the taxi-driver loudly, lugging a
big, and apparently, heavy suit-case from his cab. "Look alive,
please! This lady's only got about three minutes to catch the
Southminster train."</p>

<p>'Southminster!' whistled Huntley. 'The station for that
damned Bradwell bungalow! What's she doing there.'</p>

<p>He followed at a distance to see that she caught the train
and then, speculating hard all the time as to what the
housekeeper was&mdash;as he called it&mdash;'up to,' he made his
way to the lawyers' and delivered his mistress's papers.</p>

<p>Then, although he had had no intention of doing it before he
had known the housekeeper would not be there, he thought he
would call in at Berkeley Square. He was received with great
delight by the three maids in charge who, along with the
housekeeper always constituted the skeleton staff when Sir Roger
and Lady Hake were not staying there. They were most eager to
hear all about the tragedy at Hake Court, but he gave them
little satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I don't want to talk about it," he said. "It's a terrible
business and it does not seem we shall ever get rid of the
police. They're still poking about the place and questioning us.
It's terrible for poor little Mistress." He turned the
conversation. "Where's Mrs. Rawson to-day."</p>

<p>It was obvious at once from the expressions on the girls'
faces that the housekeeper was not popular. "She's gone off for
the day to her sister at Norwood, who's very ill," said one of
them.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's gone to Norwood, has she?" asked Huntley. "And her
sister's very ill?"</p>

<p>"So she says," said the girl, "and she went there yesterday
as well, both times with her suit-case packed full." She nodded
darkly. "But we're not so sure about this sick sister of hers.
We'd never heard of her before and we believe Mother Rawson
thinks she is going to get the sack and is getting things away,
beforehand."</p>

<p>"What things?" asked Huntley sharply.</p>

<p>"We can't tell you," replied the girl. "You know she's got
the keys of all the cupboards and the store, and keeps
everything locked up. She's locked her room, too, so that we
don't know if anything's been taken from there. At any rate
she's sent several boxes away by carrier and she took good care,
too, we shouldn't see the labels on them."</p>

<p>Huntley returned to Hake Court wondering a lot about Mrs.
Rawson and, saying nothing to anyone about her, was secretly
resolving to go down to Bradwell as soon as he could and have a
look round. Elsie had told him exactly where the bungalow was
situated, and he was sure he would have no difficulty in picking
it out, without having to go into the village to make
enquiries.</p>

<p>Later in the week came the interesting news, by way of a
letter received by the cook from one of the Berkeley Square
maids, that the lawyers had given Mrs. Rawson notice and that
she would be leaving any day now.</p>

<p>'And so I shall have to be very careful,' nodded Huntley to
himself, 'for it may be it'll be to that bungalow she'll be
going. She'll be thinking no one knows anything about it, and
it's just likely she'll be going off with a lot of things which
don't belong to her and hiding them there.' He nodded. 'Well, if
she's not in the bungalow I'll get inside and see.'</p>

<p>On the following Sunday he was free for the whole day, and
setting off early upon his motor-bicycle, proceeded to cut
across country in the direction of the Essex coast. He crossed
the London-Ipswich road at Witham, and passing through Maldon
and Latchingdon, soon found himself within a few miles of
Bradwell. But he was not minded to go anywhere near the village,
and turned off on to a marsh road, which he saw led to the
coast, when he was about three miles from it. Then, deep in the
Tillingham marshes, he got off his motor-bicycle and considered
his position.</p>

<p>He had brought with him a small pair of Sir Roger's racing
glasses and could pick out most clearly the last bungalow, which
he knew to be the one he was wanting, about a mile and a half
away. The blinds were down and there was no sign of life about
the place.</p>

<p>Still, if he were going to effect an entrance, he did not
want anyone to hear him ride up on a noisy motor-bicycle and,
perhaps, become interested in what he was doing. So he decided
to hide his machine in a nearby ditch, which was happily quite
dry, and proceed the rest of the way on foot. It was almost any
odds, he thought, against anyone coming near the lonely and
desolate stretch of marshland where he now was.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he was outside the bungalow and
prospecting cautiously around. There was no one about and the
next bungalow was nearly a quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p>'God, what a place to have brought poor little Elsie to!' he
choked. He ground his teeth viciously. 'But, by Cripes, I'll pay
the old devil out, somehow!'</p>

<p>Keeping his driving gloves on, so that by no chance should he
leave any finger-marks behind, he produced a stout pocket-knife
and had soon forced the catch of one of the windows and was
standing inside the bungalow. Pulling up the blind, because the
light was dim to his eyes just fresh from the sunlight, he found
he was in quite a good-sized room, very comfortably furnished,
with heavy curtains and a thick carpet covering the floor. It
contained a large double bed covered with a blue satin
eiderdown. All the furnishings were new or almost new. He
guessed it was Sir Roger's own room as there was a box of his
particular cigars and a silver ash-tray upon the mantel-shelf.
Also in one corner was a small .22 rifle and in another a
twelve-bore double-barrelled gun. Picking them up, each in turn,
he frowned in disgust at his late master's carelessness in
leaving them both loaded.</p>

<p>He tiptoed round the other rooms, a smaller bedroom, a
dining-room and a kitchen. Everything was nicely appointed and
it was evident no money had been spared. He began opening the
several cupboards and whistled at once. They were packed full of
stuff which had, obviously, been brought from Berkeley Square
and which had, certainly, never been intended to be used in that
little bungalow. Finest linen sheets, blankets, pillow-cases,
and quite a number of tablecloths. In a box he found cutlery, a
quantity of silver forks and spoons and pairs of silver
candlesticks and two valuable old silver snuff-boxes.</p>

<p>'Gee, she's stolen every damned thing!' he exclaimed. 'She is
reckoning, and quite rightly too, that poor little mistress
won't know half of the things that should be up in Berkeley
Square! Gee, what a thief!'</p>

<p>But his discoveries in that cupboard were not all, for every
cupboard in the place contained what looked like more stolen
things, even including tinned provisions and two ten-pound
packets of tea.</p>

<p>Seating himself down in the dining-room, which faced to sea,
he was considering what he should do next, when, to his horror,
he heard voices outside. There was the sound of wheels rattling
over stones and then a man called out, "Whoa!"</p>

<p>Paralysed in his fright, for quite half a minute, he sat on
where he was, but then, awaking to his danger, he darted to the
window and peered round the corner of the blind.</p>

<p>Hell, there was the housekeeper herself, coming up the short
garden path, with her arms full of bundles, while behind her
barely a dozen yards away, was a man lugging a big box off a
cart! A large black dog was smelling about just under the
dining-room window.</p>

<p>Huntley thought like lightning. He must get back into the
bedroom, but he dared not get out of the window as the dog would
have him for certain, and come after him at once. No, he must
hide in the bedroom and wait until the man and the dog had gone!
Oh, what a fool he'd been not to keep a better look-out. Of
course, the housekeeper had come down by the early morning
train, and been driven from the station in that cart.</p>

<p>He turned into the bedroom just as he heard the key grate in
the front door, and jumped behind the thick curtain. Then, as he
was pulling the curtain straight, his hand knocked against the
small rifle which was standing in the corner and he had to
clutch sharply at it to prevent it from falling on to the floor.
Still gripping it, with no time to put it back in the corner, he
drew his arm in behind the curtain. Then he cursed deeply, as he
remembered that although he had pulled down the window after he
had climbed in, the blind was still up. He heard the man with
the cart talking to Mrs. Rawson.</p>

<p>"Well, that's that, marm," said the man, panting hard, and
there came a sound as of some heavy object being plumped down on
to the floor. "I'll bring up the other two boxes on Toosday and
you pay me then. But don't expect me much before five because
I've a big round that day."</p>

<p>"That'll be all right, then," said the housekeeper, "but oh!
keep that dog out! Don't let him come into the house. Get out,
you brute!" and there were stampings of feet, as if she were
trying to frighten the animal away.</p>

<p>"It's all right marm," cried the man huffily, "and don't you
try to strike him, or he'll fly at you. He smelt something. That
was all. He smelt a rat, perhaps."</p>

<p>"A rat!" exclaimed the housekeeper in horrified tones. "Do
you think one can have got in here?"</p>

<p>"Shouldn't wonder, marm," said the man. "There are some big
'uns about here." Perhaps he spoke maliciously because she had
threatened his dog. "And they're very savage sometimes."</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do, if there is one?" asked the housekeeper
in most concerned tones. "I'm terrified of rats."</p>

<p>"Do with him, marm?" laughed the man. "Why shoot him, of
course. I see there's cartridges on the mantel-shelf over there
and so you've got a gun. You can kill him easy with that. Good
morning, marm. See you the day after to-morrow," and he banged
the door behind him as he went out.</p>

<p>Huntley cursed under his breath. 'My God, if she takes hold
of that gun and comes looking round!' he murmured, 'I'll be as
good as dead, or with a big hole in my stomach.'</p>

<p>A long silence followed and then Huntley felt rather than
heard the woman moving about the bungalow. He thought afterwards
she must have taken off her boots because, being new ones, they
were hurting her. At any rate, he sensed a sort of stirring in
the passage. Then he heard a rustle and the rustle seemed to be
coming nearer and nearer. A silence followed and then something
moved by the wall of the room in which he was and he heard, or
imagined he heard, a click.</p>

<p>Another silence followed, and not being able to tell what was
happening, the suspense began to unnerve him and his knees
trembled so much that it was only with an effort he was able to
keep himself upright. Things became so unbearable at last, that
he made to pull gently upon the curtain so that he could look
round it into the room. With all his care, however, he must have
pulled too hard for, to his unutterable horror, down came the
curtain-rod, curtain and all, and he stood in full view of the
housekeeper, who was standing on the other side of the room with
the double-barrelled shot-gun in her hands.</p>

<p>Her face was as white as a ghost and her eyes were filled
with terror.</p>

<p>For perhaps five seconds they stood staring at each other and
then it was the woman who recovered first.</p>

<p>With a startled cry, she lifted up the gun and pointing it
straight at him, pulled hard upon the trigger. But nothing
happened, for she had only pulled up the trigger to half
cock.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot, you idiot," shouted Huntley, but seeing she was
deliberately pulling up the trigger again, he flung up the
little rifle which he had all the time been holding in his
hands, and pulling up the trigger, fired straight at her
body.</p>

<p>She clutched at one side of her breast, gave a short moan and
fell crashing on to the floor. She had been hit just over the
heart.</p>

<p>Huntley panted as if he had been running a long distance and
swallowed hard. He stared wonderingly at the body as if he did
not know what he had done. But the realisation of everything
came to him in a flash and dropping the rifle like a red-hot
coal, he darted over to the woman and tried to lift her up. But
her body sagged in his arms and, with a dreadful shudder, he let
it sink back on to the floor. He saw blood was soaking down all
over her cotton dress.</p>

<p>He looked round like a hunted animal. The sun was shining
through the window and a long vista of the marshland stretched
before his eyes. There was not a soul in sight. He craned his
head to listen but all he heard was the faint lapping of the
waves outside.</p>

<p>He tiptoed like lightning, in turn, to all the other windows
of the bungalow and peered round the corners of the blinds.
There was no one near, but in the distance he saw a party of two
men and two girls coming along the sands.</p>

<p>He must be quick; he must get away at once; he must leave no
traces of anything behind. Thank goodness he had not taken off
his gloves and so there would be no finger-marks to worry about!
He would lock the front door, and leave by the way he had come,
by the window. 'Then,' he smiled a sickly smile, 'let the police
puzzle out for themselves, who the killer was, and how he had
got in.'</p>

<p>Keeping his eyes averted from the dead body, he went back
into the bedroom and, mounting upon a chair, put back the
curtain-rod and adjusted the curtain. Then, having locked the
front door, he was just about to leave the bungalow when he
heard voices again, very close this time.</p>

<p>He peeped round the blind in the front room and saw it was
the little party of four he had noticed in the distance, a few
minutes ago. They had a large picnic basket and some rugs with
them, and also two deck-chairs. They had brought themselves to a
standstill in front of the house. He could hear plainly what
they were saying.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is far enough," called out one of the men. "I vote
we stop here. No one will come as far as this." He looked at his
watch. "It'll be high tide about eleven and it is ten minutes
to, now."</p>

<p>"Yes, this'll do for us," said one of the girls. She pointed
to the little stretch of grass belonging to the bungalow. "And
we'll camp on that bit of grass. Then we won't get so much sand
in the food. There's no one in the bungalow, as the blinds are
all drawn."</p>

<p>Huntley was horror-struck. He was caught like a rat in a
trap. He could not leave the bungalow by the back, as directly
he got a few yards from it he would be seen. It was open and
flat country all round.</p>

<p>With a dry mouth and a fearfully beating heart, he watched
the little party settle down, and it was quickly apparent to him
they were going to be there for the day. They spread out the
rugs, placed out their picnicking things and even lit a fire
with chips of wood they had gathered, right in the middle of the
garden-path.</p>

<p>"And we needn't even have bothered to bring water all this
way," said one of the girls producing a small ready-filled
kettle from the basket. "There'll be plenty of good water in
that tank there," and she pointed to the one at the side of the
bungalow.</p>

<p>Huntley smiled a wan and ghastly smile. Here was this
light-hearted picnic party within a few yards of the bloody corpse
of a woman who had just been killed. And they would be eating and
drinking and making merry within a few feet of the killer, who
by the Tuesday night, if not sooner, would be looked for, high
and low, by every policeman round the countryside. He shuddered
at the prospect&mdash;his thoughts were conjuring up. Oh, if he
could only get away. He would be caught red-handed, if by any
chance anyone came to the bungalow.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, however, he began to calm down. No one
would be coming to the bungalow. There was no reason for them to
come and the housekeeper was the only one who possessed a key.
He settled himself down to wait with what patience he could.</p>

<p>Then, closing his eyes, he tried to work out everything which
might happen when it became known the woman had been murdered,
and he did not try to hide from himself that things would look
very black for him. Of course, he would be suspected at once.
Inspector Larose knew what hatred he must have for the
housekeeper and naturally, would have told his brother inspector
the part the woman had taken in Elsie's pitiable story. Then,
looking for a motive for the killing of the housekeeper, their
thoughts would turn instantly to him.</p>

<p>God, and they would learn he had been away all the Sunday on
his motor-bicycle, and wherever he made out he had gone to for
the day, he would not be able to furnish a single witness to
prove it.</p>

<p>His breathing almost choked him. He must baffle them in some
way, and the great point in his favour was that he had plenty of
time to think out how he could do it. Ah, and to begin with, he
must supply another motive for the crime. He must make out the
woman had been shot by someone who had broken in to steal. His
thoughts ran on. But how would the police know there had been
anything in the place worth stealing? If he took away the silver
spoons and forks and the candlesticks and the snuff-box, they
might never learn they had ever been there. What, in the
ordinary way, would there have been in a little bungalow like
this to tempt anyone to break in and rob? Why, nothing! He shook
his head vehemently. No, to deceive the police properly, he must
be as crafty as a fox.</p>

<p>Then he smiled cunningly as an idea came to him. He would
gather together everything which was worth taking in the
bungalow and so give the police the impression that he had been
packing them up to carry away, and been interrupted.</p>

<p>So he set about carrying this out most methodically. Opening
a suit-case he found in the smaller bedroom, he tipped all its
contents on to the floor there and bringing it into the kitchen,
laid it upon the table. Then wantonly tearing up a good sheet
from one of the cupboards, he carefully wrapped up every piece
of silver and packed it into the suit-case. In the housekeeper's
handbag, he found twenty-seven pounds in treasury-notes, and
these he dropped all close together upon one place on the
kitchen floor, to suggest that he had been so agitated in his
flight that he had not noticed them fall.</p>

<p>All these preparations took him until about half-past one and
by then, being much easier in his mind, he began to feel hungry.
The housekeeper had brought with her a fair-sized string bag,
and examining its contents, he found in it, among other things,
a small brown-paper bag with 'Liverpool Street Station' on it.
Opening it, he saw a whole meat-pie and one partly consumed.
After a long consideration, he ate the whole pie over the
kitchen sink, being most careful that any crumbs he made should
fall back into the brown-paper bag. Then, after a drink of
water, which he took by putting his mouth close to the tap, he
resigned himself to continue his long wait, his only escape from
its monotony being his watch upon the picnic party outside.</p>

<p>They had had a bathe, their meal, more cups of tea and now
were resting and dozing upon the little stretch of grass. He
could hear everything they said and had soon even got to know
their Christian names. He gathered they had come down by char-a-banc
from Forest Gate and would be leaving for the return journey at six.</p>

<p>So, the long afternoon wore on and at last, with great
relief, he saw them pack up and leave. By then, however, he had
come to the conclusion that, having waited so long, it would be
wiser now to wait until it got dark. He was devoutly hoping no
one had come across his motor-bicycle.</p>

<p>Darkness having at last fallen, he left by means of the
kitchen window, leaving it open to support the idea how quickly
he had had to get away. To his great relief, he found his
motor-bicycle exactly as he had left it, and very soon he was upon
his way home.</p>

<p>He rode his motor-bicycle very carefully, but as quickly as
he could, as far as possible avoiding all main roads. Luckily,
he knew the country well and so managed his journey that he
never went through a lighted town. He was confident that, up to
the very gates of Hake Court, he had slunk unobtrusively and
almost unseen across the whole country of Essex.</p>

<p>Arriving at the gates of the Court grounds, they were opened
for him by one of the other gardeners who lived in the
village.</p>

<p>"Hepburn's in hospital," announced the man. "He wasn't
feeling well this morning and Mistress came down to see him.
Then she insisted upon his going straight off at once. She drove
him in her car to make certain he went."</p>

<p>Huntley was not interested over much. Hepburn was an ageing,
taciturn old bachelor, and not liked by the other servants, of
whom he took no notice. Indeed, he took no notice of anyone
except Lady Hake for whom he had of late developed a most
dog-like devotion.</p>

<p>Letting himself into the house through the back door, Huntley
changed out of his cycling overalls and went down into the
kitchen to get himself some supper, hoping as it was so late
that all the girls would have gone off to bed and he would
escape being asked where he had been. Anticipating the
questioning of the police, which he was certain would come
later, he was prepared, however, to give out at once that he had
been down to Southampton. That would have been a journey long
enough to have made it practically impossible for him to have
been anywhere near Bradwell as well, upon the same day.</p>

<p>No one was in the kitchen and he did not meet any of the
other servants until the next morning at breakfast. Then, going
in for the meal, he was surprised to see mackerel upon the
table.</p>

<p>"Yes," smiled the cook, noticing his surprise, "Mr. Chater
called in last night with a string of them for the mistress. He
and Doctor King-Harley motored down to Hastings yesterday and
got some, fresh off the fishing-boats, just as they had come
in."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Huntley, an idea suddenly flashing into his
mind. "I saw them there. I went for a ride yesterday along the
South Coast as far as Worthing," and he smiled to himself at the
boldness of the idea which had come to him.</p>

<p>That afternoon he asked Lady Hake if she would spare him the
day off on the morrow, as he wanted to go up to town to buy an
engagement ring for Elsie Bane, and he was told he could be
spared.</p>

<p>Accordingly, soon after ten the next morning, he presented
himself at the chambers of Byles Chater in Temple Court and
asked to see the King's Counsel.</p>

<p>"But you haven't an appointment," frowned the clerk to whom
he had addressed himself, "and Mr. Chater is very busy. What's
your business?"</p>

<p>"Private," said Huntley, "but you give him my name and tell
him I come from Hake Court and it's most important I should see
him."</p>

<p>The clerk took himself off, as if rather reluctantly, but
returned immediately and beckoned to the butler to follow
him.</p>

<p>Byles Chater looked curiously at Huntley when he was shown
in. "Well, what is it you want?" he asked. "Do you come from
Lady Hake?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I'm here about myself," replied Huntley. Then
making sure the door was shut behind him, he blurted out quickly
and very nervously, "The truth is, sir, I've got myself into
very grave trouble and I expect I may even be arrested to-night."
He could hardly get his words out. "I want you to help me, sir."</p>

<p>"But what on earth have you done?" frowned Byles Chater.</p>

<p>"I've&mdash;I've killed a woman, sir," stammered Huntley
ruefully. "The body hasn't been found yet, but I expect it will
be this afternoon, and then it won't be long before the police
come to me."</p>

<p>"Good God," exclaimed the K.C. with his eyes as wide as
saucers, "what the devil did you do it for?"</p>

<p>"I had to do it to save myself, sir, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But who was the woman?" snapped the other sharply.</p>

<p>Huntley almost choked. "Mrs. Rawson, sir, my late master's
housekeeper in Berkeley Square. She was a very evil woman."</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed the K.C. again. He lowered his voice.
"Tell me all the story."</p>

<p>So Huntley began by relating his surprise at learning from
Inspector Stone that Sir Roger had a bungalow at Bradwell. Then
he said how he had seen the housekeeper going off on the
Southminster train, when she had given out she was going to
Norwich. He had heard of the boxes she was sending away and so
was suspecting that now Sir Roger was dead, she was stealing
things from the house in Berkeley Square. So he had gone down to
the bungalow on the Sunday which had just passed. Then he told
everything which had happened there, how he had found the stolen
things, how she had arrived unexpectedly, how he had hidden
behind the curtains and how she must have seen his feet sticking
out from underneath when she had come into the bedroom. Then he
told of the curtain falling down and how she had tried to shoot
him and he had had to fire at her to save himself.</p>

<p>Then he related how he had had to remain in the bungalow
until night and what he had done to cover his tracks.</p>

<p>Byles Chater listened to him with close attention, never
taking his eyes from his face. Then when Huntley had finished,
he asked frowningly, "And you say you've left no clues behind
you? Then why will the police suspect you?"</p>

<p>"Because they know, sir," said Huntley very solemnly, "that I
had every reason to want to harm Mrs. Rawson. She had taken my
young lady down to that bungalow and drugged her so that Sir
Roger could carry out his vile purpose. I only learnt of it
after he was dead," and then he related the whole story of the
disappearance of Elsie Bane: how no one had known for months and
months to where she had gone, but how through Larose her
whereabouts had been discovered, and he, Huntley, and the girl
had met again.</p>

<p>"And the dreadful part is, sir," he finished up with, "it
cannot be hidden from the police that I was away all Sunday on
my motor-cycle and so, unless I can prove I was miles and miles
away from Bradwell, they will be sure it was me."</p>

<p>Byles Chater nodded. "Of course they will!" He spoke
decisively. "Well, my advice to you, my friend, is to go and
give yourself up. Give yourself up at once, to-day, this
morning, before they find the body. Make a clean breast of
everything and I'll do the best I can for you. At any rate, I
can promise you you won't hang."</p>

<p>Huntley spoke hesitatingly. "But, sir, thinking that I've
taken my revenge upon the woman because of what she did to my
sweetheart, wouldn't the police make out that I had had revenge
upon Sir Roger too, because of what he'd have done to her?"</p>

<p>The K.C. nodded. "No doubt!" He shrugged his shoulders. "But
you're lucky there. They can't prove anything. You'll be quite
safe."</p>

<p>Huntley hesitated. "But if I could prove, sir, that I was
somewhere else on Sunday, I should be all right." He gave a
little cough. "I told them in the kitchen this morning that I
was in Hastings then, and had seen you and Doctor King-Harley."
He nodded. "Of course, I'd heard you had brought those mackerel
from there."</p>

<p>Byles Chater glared at him in amazement. "You're a big liar,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>Huntley sighed. "But not a bad one, sir. I don't tell lies
which hurt anyone, and I thought&mdash;&mdash;" he hesitated
again&mdash;"I thought that perhaps you would very kindly say
you had seen me at Hastings when you were there on the Sunday
morning and then that would save me."</p>

<p>It hardly seemed that Byles Chater could believe his ears. He
bent forward with his face all puckered in an amazed frown. He
was evidently too astounded to be angry. "And what do you
suggest offering me in return," he asked with biting sarcasm,
"for this little accommodation of perjury upon my part."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied Huntley very solemnly, "I've helped you
by holding my tongue, and I thought you might perhaps now help
me in return." He spoke quite firmly. "I have kept silent when a
word from me would have been most unpleasant for all you
gentlemen, more unpleasant than I dare to think."</p>

<p>It was now the great King's Counsel who could hardly get out
his words. "W-hat, what do you mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>Huntley lowered his voice to an intense whisper. "I was in
the study that night, sir, when Sir Roger was shot. I was hiding
behind the curtain and saw everything." He spoke fiercely and
quickly. "I watched the struggle between Master and Mr. Harland.
He had called Master a foul brute and Master had shaken him and
spat in his face and called her ladyship a female dog. Then Mr.
Harland snatched up the pistol and killed him. Then he threw
open the library door and called out that he shot him and was
going to ring up the police. You all came running in and you
said it served Master right and they were all glad Mr. Harland
had done it. Then you said&mdash;yes, sir, it was
you&mdash;'let's give him an alibi, let's all swear he never
left the room.' And the doctor and Mr. Norton agreed at once,
but the others were not willing at first and you all went back
into the library to talk things over."</p>

<p>Huntley seemed to have echausted himself by his long speech
and finished hardly audibly, "Then I ran out of the study, sir,
and didn't come near it again until you rang for me."</p>

<p>Byles Chafer's face had gone an ashen grey, but it was drawn
in cold proud lines and there was no sign of fear or weakness in
the lips pressed so tightly together. His eyes glared menacingly
at Huntley, "And you think," he asked contemptuously, "that
anyone will believe this story if you tell them?"</p>

<p>Huntley nodded gravely. "Inspector Larose has the proof of
it, sir," he said, "but he does not realise it yet. He does not
understand what it means." He spoke most respectfully. "You
gentlemen made one great mistake, sir. You left that candle
burning all the time you were deciding what to do, and Inspector
Larose has noticed it. He lighted the other candle to see how
long it would take to make them both level. The other afternoon
he shut himself up in the study for longer than an hour and I
don't know what he isn't up to. I am afraid of him, sir. He is a
very great detective and we must all be afraid of him, for he is
most dangerous."</p>

<p>In spite of his self-control, the K.C. frowned heavily and
uneasily. "And what do you intend to do," he asked sharply, "if
I refuse to perjure myself in the face of your threat?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is no threat, sir," replied Huntley hastily. "If you
don't see your way to help me, I shall still say nothing." He
shook his head vehemently. "But I shan't give myself up. I shall
take a fighting chance and make out I was on the South
Coast."</p>

<p>For a long minute, Byles Chater considered, stroking his chin
thoughtfully and with his eyes staring into vacancy. Then, with
a deep sigh of resignation, he jerked up the receiver and asked
for a number. "Is Doctor King-Harley in? Then put me on to him
please. Mr. Byles Chater speaking.&mdash;Is that you, Doctor?
It's Chater here. I must speak to you at once. It's about Hake
Court and the matter is very urgent. Right. I'll come round at
once."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and rose quickly to his feet. "Come
on," he said to Huntley, "we'll go and speak to Doctor
King-Harley."</p>

<p>A taxi was summoned and Huntley was bundled in. Not a word
was spoken during the journey or until they had been shown into
the doctor's waiting-room. Then the K.C. said, "I shall speak to
him, first. You'll wait in here."</p>

<p>Only about two minutes elapsed before Byles Chater was taken
in to the doctor and the consulting-room door closed behind him.
He spoke casually. "Things not too good, brother," he said. "We
had an audience that we were not aware of that night in Hake's
study. His butler was behind the curtain there and saw and heard
everything. Now he's in trouble himself&mdash;" he laughed
mirthlessly&mdash;"with another killing, and he wants help from
you and me."</p>

<p>The doctor's face was very grave and he made no attempt to
hide his consternation. It became graver still as Byles Chater
proceeded with the butler's story. When it was finished, he
looked very white and drawn.</p>

<p>"What a mess!" he exclaimed. "What a damnable mess we're in."
He drew in a deep breath. "It was mad of us to start the
business in the very beginning."</p>

<p>"It was," nodded the K.C. solemnly, "and we're in it up to
the neck now." He regarded the doctor intently. "The point is,
are we two to involve ourselves still more in the hope of
playing for safety?"</p>

<p>"If we're found out," said the doctor thoughtfully, "if it
becomes known how we perjured ourselves to save young Harland,
it means ruin to all our careers. It means penal servitude for
all of us."</p>

<p>"Quite so," agreed Chater at once, "we shall probably get
three years, although under all the circumstances the jury will
certainly recommend us to mercy."</p>

<p>The doctor frowned. "But you say this man is not unfriendly;
he's not going to round on us in any case."</p>

<p>"N-o," the K.C. admitted slowly, "but he's shrewd enough to
realise he may be charged with a double murder and then&mdash;to
clear himself from the charge of having killed that beast, Sir
Roger&mdash;it is just possible he may not be able to resist
telling about us." He spoke judicially. "Really, it would be
foolish of him not to do so, as he is under no obligation to any
of us."</p>

<p>"And you think," asked the doctor quickly, "that if we put
him under such an obligation, he will say nothing, out of
gratitude?"</p>

<p>"There will be no need for him to say anything then," nodded
Byles Chater emphatically. "If we give him this alibi he asks
for he will be out of the danger zone at once. Cleared of the
suspicion of having taken his revenge on the woman at Bradwell,
there will be no suspicion of his having taken revenge on Hake."
He raised his hand to stress his point. "You see, as I look at
it as far as Huntley is concerned, the two killings are
indissolubly linked together. Both of those who have come to
these dreadful ends had jointly inflicted a terrible wrong upon
him through that Elsie Bane, so what will be more natural, if it
can be proved he killed one, than to suspect him of having
killed the other? The probability then becomes cumulative. But
if the idea that he killed one of them is scotched on the head
at once&mdash;then the idea that he killed the other will never
enter into anyone's mind?"</p>

<p>"But didn't he tell us," queried the doctor, "that the
detectives were not inclined to believe him when he said he had
not come near us because he had been hunting for matches all the
time the lights had been out. Isn't he suspected already?"</p>

<p>"No, he's not," snapped Byles Chater, "Old Charlie Stone sort
of hinted to me that they believe he'd been upstairs courting
one of the maids." He spoke testily. "But what do you agree to
do about him now? I'm for halving our risks and swearing we saw
him at Hastings on Sunday."</p>

<p>"I'll have him," snapped back the doctor, and he put his
finger upon the bell. "If he seems reliable I suppose we'll have
to do it, but if he's a weakling I'll not go any further."</p>

<p>Huntley came in and bowed most respectfully to Dr. King-Harley,
who took him in hand at once, coming straight to the point.</p>

<p>"Now then," he said savagely, "this is blackmail!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no sir!" exclaimed Huntley in horrified tones. "I
wouldn't think of such a thing."</p>

<p>"But if we don't do as you want us to," scowled the doctor,
"you'll give us away to the police."</p>

<p>"No, I shan't, sir," said Huntley firmly. "I will never do
that. I'm too fond of my poor mistress. I want her to marry Mr.
Harland and get some happiness for the awful life she's been
having."</p>

<p>"She mayn't want to marry him," snapped the doctor.</p>

<p>"Oh, but she does, sir. They've been sweethearts for quite a
little while."</p>

<p>"What!" cried the doctor. "How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"They've been meeting in the summer-house, sir, very late at
night. They don't know it, but I've sort of been keeping watch
for them so that Master shouldn't find out."</p>

<p>"Gad!" exclaimed Byles Chater using his favourite expression.
"You're not lying to us now?"</p>

<p>Huntley shook his head. "No, sir, and I only tell you because
at a time like this I think it is best we should all know
everything. It will help us to beat those inspectors." He
nodded. "Mr. Harland and Mistress had a narrow escape only a few
nights before the card-party. They thought Sir Roger had gone to
bed and Mr. Harland was petting her in the hall. I heard Master
coming and pretended to come out of the passage and fall over a
chair. I made a lot of noise and Mistress escaped up the back-stairs.
Mr. Harland made out he was half asleep in an armchair,
but I think Master was a little bit suspicious, because he smelt
the scent Mistress uses." He nodded again. "That's why I believe
he called her a dreadful word in the study, which made Mr.
Harland shoot him at once."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned!" exclaimed the doctor. "What'll we hear
next?"</p>

<p>"But we can't blame her, sir," said Huntley. "Master led her
an awful life. He used to come home and boast to her about the
women he'd been making love to."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Byles Chater.</p>

<p>Huntley hesitated. "Well, sir, sometimes Master talked very
loudly and&mdash;I listened."</p>

<p>"Does she know Mr. Harland shot her husband?" asked the
doctor.</p>

<p>"No, sir, he's told her he didn't," replied Huntley. He
looked a little embarrassed. "I happened to have been listening
then, too." He smiled, "She thinks Mr. Reeder killed him because
he'd shot that beautiful racehorse, Molly's Darling. She's sure
of it."</p>

<p>The K.C. looked at the doctor and the latter nodded. Byles
Chater turned to the butler. "Well, if we're going to help you,
tell us exactly what you want us to say."</p>

<p>"That you saw me in Hastings, sir," replied Huntley,
"somewhere about middle of the day." He coughed. "Mrs. Rawson
passed away about twenty minutes to eleven, so that would be the
best time to say."</p>

<p>"Can you be sure that was the exact time?" asked Byles Chater
sternly. "Remember we must make no mistake now."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's no mistake, sir. I've looked up the train and it
arrived at Southminster at a few minutes to ten, and the carrier
man had to bring her on for between four and five miles. So what
time did you gentlemen get to Hastings?"</p>

<p>"Soon after twelve. We parked our car in West Street and went
into the Victoria Hotel for lunch at half-past."</p>

<p>"That will suit me, sir," smiled Huntley. "Now, I know
Hastings well. I spent a holiday there last year and I was there
for the day last August Bank Holiday. So when you walked along
the sea-front, coming from West Street, you saw me standing with
my machine against the rails, right in front of the hotel
watching the people bathing. It should have been about high
water, sir."</p>

<p>"It was," grunted the K.C. "Near enough, at any rate."</p>

<p>"And it was bright sunshine," went on Huntley, "and as you
passed me you nodded and said, 'Good-day to you, Huntley, out on
the spree, are you?' and I laughed and said, 'Oh, no, sir. I am
too old for that.'"</p>

<p>"And that's all I said," frowned Byles Chater, half amused
and half annoyed at the confident way the man was arranging
things. "Don't make out I said too much or I shall forget
it."</p>

<p>"Not for a moment, sir," said Huntley. He thought for a few
seconds. "Then you went straight across the road into the hotel.
Oh, and my motor-bicycle looked very bright and all nickel-plated.
You just noticed it had a large tank."</p>

<p>"And what did I do?" asked Dr. King-Harley, sarcastically.
"Didn't I say anything?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," smiled Huntley, "you just nodded to me. You were
carrying a newspaper in your hand. You both were wearing light
suits? Yes, and soft hats? Oh, I had got the usual motor-cycle
suit and an air-man's cap, and I hadn't any goggles on when you
saw me."</p>

<p>"But what is there to have prevented you being in Hastings in
the morning?" asked Byles Chater, "and killing that woman in the
afternoon or evening?"</p>

<p>"I've thought of that, sir," said Huntley, "and was going to
ask you what time you left Hastings in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"About half-past four and we came back by way of Eastbourne.
I suppose we left there at six."</p>

<p>"And you passed me then in Terminus Road. I was going very
slowly and coming in the opposite direction, just before you
turn off to go to Devonshire Park. Apparently I didn't see you.
I came back by the same way I went. You said to Doctor King-Harley,
'Here's that gay knut again. Where's he off to now?'"</p>

<p>The doctor's grim face broke into a smile. "I think we can
rely on him all right, Chater. He seems to have all his wits
about him." He turned to Huntley and his face clouded a
little.</p>

<p>"Now, you're not likely to give yourself away in fright when
the police first come to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir, you can trust me," replied Huntley. He smiled.
"I appeared quite all right, sir, didn't I, when I came in that
night when one of you gentlemen rang the bell. You wouldn't have
guessed I knew the master was lying dead?"</p>

<p>"No, by Jove, no!" exclaimed the doctor fervently. "I'd have
staked my life you weren't acting then." A thought struck him.
"But here, how did you come to be behind the curtain that
night?"</p>

<p>"Master had some headache tablets in his desk and I'd gone to
get one, sir. Then I'd unfortunately spilled them all out of the
bottle just before the lights went out and I was waiting to see
to be able to pick them up again. I daren't let Master know I'd
been to his desk, so I went behind that curtain the instant I
saw him coming in with the lighted match."</p>

<p>"One thing more," asked the doctor uneasily. "Now are you
positive you left no finger-marks behind in that bungalow."</p>

<p>"Quite positive, sir. I never took my gloves off once during
the whole day, from the moment I left the Court until I got back
there at night. It was a great trial to me, as the day was very
hot."</p>

<p>"And another thing," frowned Byles Chater. "If they arrest
you, insist that you have a lawyer at once. But don't go to my
brother's firm. Ask for Mr. Cole Nathan of Fleet Court. You
couldn't have a better man, but don't tell a soul, least of all,
him, that I recommended you."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," bowed Huntley, and he was dismissed with
the stern injunction to be on the look out continually and to
hold himself ready at any moment for the shock of the arrival of
the detectives.</p>

<p>When he had gone, the two friends looked intently at each
other. "Are we gentlemen, do you think, King-Harley," asked
Byles Chater, "to be deliberately perjuring ourselves to save
two murderers?"</p>

<p>The doctor made a wry face. "If we are," he replied, "we are
now certainly madmen as well." He shook his head vexatiously.
"Just imagine two men high up in honourable professions like
ours, acting like this! It is incredible! It is fantastic beyond
belief!"</p>

<p>"It was all my fault for suggesting it," commented Byles
Chater gloomily, "but I was maddened, as we all were, with the
way that devil had treated poor little Mary
Hellister&mdash;thank God I don't think of her as Lady Hake
now&mdash;at dinner. We did it in the heat of the moment," he
nodded, "and I'm damned sure we've all been regretting it ever
since."</p>

<p>"Never mind!" nodded the doctor. He smiled his dry smile.
"Remember all's well that ends well."</p>

<p>"But, by God, it's not ended yet," snapped Byles Chater. He
drew in a deep breath. "Shan't I be glad when that adjourned
inquest's over! That's the snag we've got to get over."</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; THE THREADS OF FATE.</h2>

<p class="first">
IN the meantime, upon the morning when the butler of Hake
Court went up to see Mr. Byles Chater, a letter arrived at
Scotland Yard for Larose. It was marked 'Private,' postmarked
Newmarket and dated the previous day. It was signed Emma Reeder
and read:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">I am Mrs. Martin Reeder and write to you in
the strictest confidence. Please on no account let my husband
learn I have written to you, but I feel I must do so for he is
so very worried, and the worry is making him really ill. He
cannot sleep, and he eats hardly anything. The night after you
came here, the other day, he had no sleep at all and twice, the
next morning, he sat down to write to you. But he tore the
letters up each time. I know it was to you he was writing
because I happened to see one of the envelopes which he had
addressed, first. Of course, it is that dreadful murder which is
worrying him. He has something on his mind and I am sure he will
not be well again until he has told it. He did not shoot Sir
Roger Hake, but he knows who did. I have implored him to tell
you, but he is obstinate and says he will not. Still, I believe
if you come down again&mdash;find some pretence for seeing
him&mdash;he will tell you everything. He has said to me he has
done nothing very wrong, except that he has been very foolish.
He is always too good-natured and so, of course, has now been
led away by others.</p>

<p class="letter">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Emma Reeder</span>.</p>

<p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;Please come soon.</p>

<p><br>
Larose laid the letter upon the table and for a long while
stared thoughtfully out of the window He did not seem
particularly elated. 'So, as I thought,' he muttered, 'this man
knows something and, to save that poor girl, I may perhaps be
able to make him speak. Yes, that is the card to play. I must
make out suspicion against her as stronger than ever. I could
see he was anxious about her last week. I'll go down at
once.'</p>

<p>Arriving in Newmarket and turning into the avenue where the
trainer lived, he got something of a shock when he saw that the
blinds of the Reeder home were drawn down. However, he walked up
the front path and gently pushed the bell. A very solemn-faced
maid answered his ring.</p>

<p>"Can I see Mr. Reeder, please?" he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "He's dead, sir," she replied in a
whisper. "He met with a dreadful accident yesterday evening."
She pointed out through the open door to a man near a garage
about fifty yards away and added chokingly, "He'll tell you all
about it, sir. He's his chauffeur," and she closed the door
quickly to escape further questioning.</p>

<p>Larose was aghast. Notwithstanding the drawn blinds, the
shock was unexpected and he felt an unpleasant feeling in the
pit of his stomach. For the moment he was inclined to return to
his car straightaway, but thinking better of it he walked across
to the man the girl had indicated.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said. "This is very dreadful news I've
just heard. Will you very kindly tell me what happened?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the chauffeur. "Mr. Reeder was kicked on
the head by the brood-mare, Molly Bawn. It happened yesterday
evening."</p>

<p>The name struck some chord of memory in Larose's mind. "Molly
Bawn!" he ejaculated.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, the dam of Molly's Darling," nodded the man. "She
belonged to Sir Roger Hake who was murdered by someone last
week." He smiled a wan smile. "It's strange that both the owner
and the trainer should have met with dreadful deaths within a
few days of each other."</p>

<p>"Shocking!" exclaimed Larose. "How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"She was stung by a wasp, sir, and she kicked out and caught
Mr. Reeder right on the temple. His forehead was crushed in and
he was killed instantly."</p>

<p>"It's terribly sad," said Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and sadder still because the mare was a great
favourite of his. She's as docile and gentle as a lamb,
too."</p>

<p>Larose heard footsteps behind him, upon the gravelled drive,
and turned to see the maid who had opened the door coming
towards him. "Are you Mr. Larose?" she asked. "Then Mrs. Reeder
says she will speak to you."</p>

<p>Larose hesitated. "Oh, but I don't like to worry her!" he
exclaimed. "Are you sure she wants to see me."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, quite certain. She's bearing up wonderfully."</p>

<p>Larose found Mrs. Reeder a kind-faced-looking woman of
middle-age. Her expression now was one of great grief, although
she had herself well under control. "It was not fair for me to
have asked you to come down all this way and not at least speak
to you," she said. She shook her head. "But I'm afraid I can't
tell you anything." She spoke very solemnly. "The secret died
with him."</p>

<p>"You think he knew?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"I'm sure he did," she nodded, "and why he was hesitating to
speak was simply that he wanted to shield whoever it was who
killed Sir Roger Hake."</p>

<p>"He didn't like Sir Roger?" suggested Larose, to draw her
out.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No one liked him, Mr. Larose," she
shrugged her shoulders, "except a few silly women. He was a bad
man."</p>

<p>"And why do you think Mr. Reeder would have liked me to know
who killed Sir Roger?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>She spoke decisively. "It was a matter of justice, Mr.
Larose. He said you detectives are accusing someone who did not
do it, and he wanted to see that person cleared. At the same
time he didn't want the real person found out."</p>

<p>"And he told you that?"</p>

<p>"Not in so many words, but he let me know what was in his
mind. My poor husband was like that. He would often give you a
half-confidence when no confidence at all would have been
better. It only made me worried, too."</p>

<p>"And what did he mean when he told you, as you wrote me, that
he had only been foolish?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Reeder hesitated. "I think it was he'd been induced,
against his better judgment, to help hush up who had shot Sir
Roger. At any rate, he told me it had taken them nearly half an
hour to persuade him to make a fool of himself."</p>

<p>"Taken them?" queried Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes I am certain there was more than one in it."</p>

<p>"And you can tell me nothing more?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Mrs. Reeder, and then she added quickly:
"Oh, except that he said in his sleep the other night, 'Of
course he's in love with her.' I just caught the words."</p>

<p>'A sure thing!' nodded Larose, as he drove away. 'Young
Harland killed Sir Roger and the others entered into a
conspiracy to shield him. But there was some argument about it
as they didn't all agree at first. That was when the candle was
left burning, and they didn't notice it was burning until they
went to turn out the electric light. They were intending that
the study should be in darkness when the butler went into it
after they had rung for him to ask him about his master.' He
frowned heavily. 'Now what the devil am I to do about it?
However certain I may be, I can't prove anything.'</p>

<p>He broke his journey at Cambridge to make some enquiries
about Harland, whom he knew had taken his degree there two years
previously. He, Larose, had a friend upon the professorial staff
and he soon learnt all there was to know about the secretary of
the dead man.</p>

<p>Harland had had a good reputation as a quiet and very
well-balanced young fellow. Everybody had liked him. He had been a
prominent member of the Amateur Dramatic Society and upon
several occasions had taken leading parts with distinction.</p>

<p>'Exactly,' smiled Larose, when once again he was back in his
car, 'an actor, and a darned good one, too. He lied to me with
all appearance of perfect truth.' He frowned. 'But I don't put
his lying against him. He had to lie, not only for his own sake,
but also to save the dainty little widow from a terrible
scandal. Of course, if it were to come out that he had killed
Hake, then everyone would say he had done it because they had
been lovers.' He nodded. 'Most probably they have been. Her
anxiety about him, the other day, certainly suggests it. And
what would have been more natural? Neglected and brutally
treated, she would at once have aroused his pity and
then&mdash;his love, of course, would have followed.' He sighed.
'I know I could easily have fallen in love with her without
there being any need for that pity to start me on.'</p>

<p>His thoughts ran on. 'But how the devil could he get all
those level-headed men to perjure themselves for him? Oh, but
they are gentlemen, they are men of the world, they are
gamblers! Shilling points, indeed! Why, they could easily have
dropped fifty pounds during the evening! Yes, they were the very
type of men to take risks&mdash;and revel in them!'</p>

<p>He shook his head. 'But I don't suppose for a moment Harland
asked them to shield him. His nature is much too proud for that.
No, they volunteered it. They were just all ripe to be delighted
someone had put paid to the Hake brute. They knew how he was
treating his girl wife and most likely he had been insulting to
her that night at dinner. The maids said he was in a bad temper
at the meal. Then who was it suggested the perjury? Perhaps it
was that Norton who first suggested it. Or perhaps it was the
K.C. fellow, or perhaps the Harley Street quack. Yes, always
beware of doctors. They have a morality of their own, and are
the finest fellows in the world, most of them.'</p>

<p>He went on. 'Then there was that Navy chap, the nice-looking
Commander. Ah, he would sympathise with her little ladyship.
Beauty in distress and all that. But what about Paxton-Smith? A
hard-bitten shrewd chap. Still, very kind-hearted if his
sympathies were roused and with the courage of a lion when
fighting for the under-dog. He's built that way and always
sponsoring lost causes. No, there's no doubt Reeder was the last
one to come into line and now&mdash;well, we can't get him for a
witness.'</p>

<p>Arriving at the Yard, he found Inspector Stone in some
excitement over an anonymous letter which had just arrived. It
was addressed to New Scotland Yard, obviously in a woman's
handwriting, and was written upon a half-sheet of good-class
note-paper. It read:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">The writer of this informs the authorities that
the late Sir Roger Hake had recently come to suspect his wife
and his secretary of guilty relations. So, it was probably one
or the other of them who shot him.</p>

<br>

<p>"Now," exclaimed Stone, triumphantly, "what do you think of
that? Most likely this was written by the woman you met at the
bungalow. She was fond of Hake and now wants his murderer
avenged."</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "I shouldn't be surprised. This is the kind of
letter she would write. She was educated and a lady, and
probably Hake's latest catch."</p>

<p>"Well, we must find out the truth about these two," said
Stone. "If they've been making up to one another it's hardly
probable the servants won't know something about it." He screwed
up his eyes. "The devil of it is they won't want to tell. That
butler there is all eyes and ears and should know everything,
but he won't give them away." He nodded. "Still, we may be able
to find out something in the village. They're always chock full
of scandal, those little places. I'll send Henderson down to-morrow.
He's at his best when he's trailing anything to do with
a skirt."</p>

<p>"The young widow's very well liked by everyone," remarked
Larose meditatively, "and they'll certainly shield her if they
can."</p>

<p>"And she'll need a lot of shielding all round," nodded Stone
significantly, "because if she and young Harland were on
anything more than mildly friendly terms, then it's any odds
upon her having shot her husband. At any rate, we've got the
motive then for either her or Harland doing it, and with six men
swearing Harland never left the room then it can only be
she."</p>

<p>"But that doctor's testimony," frowned Larose. "It will be
hard to get over. Don't forget he said she went into a dead
faint directly she heard of Sir Roger's death."</p>

<p>"I don't forget it," scowled Stone, "but I don't believe a
word the doctor says. Of course, he's on the girl's side, too.
They all are," he shrugged his shoulders, "just because of her
dainty face and lovely eyes." He shook his finger in Larose's
face. "Why, I wouldn't trust you ten minutes, my boy, if she
started making up to you. I've always told you you're too
sentimental to be a policeman."</p>

<p>"But if we do find they've been sweet on one another," said
Larose, "it will be no actual proof that Lady Hake shot her
husband. It gives no evidence of guilt that we can produce in a
Court of Law."</p>

<p>"No, it may not," snapped Stone, "but it will show us where
she's got a chink in her armour." He raised his hands
emphatically. "Then we'll break her down next week in the
witness-box in the Coroner's Court." He heaved a big sigh. "Yes,
we'll have to turn that dainty little woman inside out and show
her up as soiled a little drab as any erring sister in the
lowest walk of life. It'll be very sad but it'll have to be
done."</p>

<p>"All right," said Larose, "but you wait first and see what
you find out to-morrow." He pointed to the letter upon the desk.
"That may be just a bit of spite."</p>

<p>Stone nodded. "Of course it may. At any rate we'll talk
things over again when Henderson gets back this afternoon."</p>

<p>But as it happened, by the following afternoon all their
thoughts for the time being had been switched off into quite a
different direction. The body of the dead woman had been
discovered in the bungalow and it had been identified as that of
Mrs. Rawson, the housekeeper of the late Sir Roger Hake.</p>

<p>Events there had followed very quickly, and, thanks to the
enterprise of a reporter attached to the Chelmsford local paper,
the whole tragedy had been avalanched into the limelight hours
and hours before it would otherwise have happened.</p>

<p>The carrier had arrived at the bungalow with two heavy boxes
about four o'clock on the Tuesday afternoon, a little earlier
than he had expected, and had been very surprised to find the
blinds in the front of the house were drawn and that he could
get no answer to his knocking. He scouted round the house and
found the open window, with the blind flapping noisily. He poked
his head inside the window and called out loudly, "Anyone at
home? Are you there Mrs. Smith?"</p>

<p>But he got no answer and he said afterwards that he didn't
like the look of things. The place seemed so dark and gloomy and
he would have sworn there was a nasty smell. He didn't fancy
going in himself, so instead, he dropped his dog into the room
and the animal disappeared out into the passage beyond. A couple
of minutes or so having passed, he called to the dog but the
animal would not come. So he got into the bungalow to see
why.</p>

<p>He went into the passage and looked into the room opposite.
The light was very dim, with the curtains drawn, but he could
just make out his dog sniffing hard at something on the floor.
He could smell something, too. He struck a match to see what it
was and then nearly fainted when he saw a woman's body lying
there. He struck another match and recognised the body as that
of Mrs. Smith, and he felt he wanted to be sick when he saw the
stains upon her dress and the horrible looking black patch upon
the carpet.</p>

<p>He grabbed at his dog and got out of the bungalow as quickly
as he could. Then he drove like fury into Bradwell and tried to
get the Southminster policeman. But the latter was not in and he
rang up the sergeant at Maldon. The sergeant got a quick grasp
of things.</p>

<p>"You go back at once," he ordered, "and wait by the bungalow.
See that no one goes inside. Now, tell me exactly where the
place is. Oh, the last one towards the Crouch and I can't miss
it! All right, I'll be there in a little over half an hour."</p>

<p>But he was not there in half an hour or anything like it.
Indeed it was more than an hour before he arrived and then it
was a procession of three cars, one of them an ambulance, which
passed through Bradwell village to the bungalow. Believing, from
the carrier's gruesome account that a murder had been committed,
the sergeant had rung the Superintendent at Chelmsford to
acquaint him with what had happened. Whereupon the
Superintendent had stated he would come himself and bring
everybody and everything necessary.</p>

<p>So the party included the police surgeon, the official
photographer and finger-print expert, and two plain-clothes
detectives. But they were not all who were arriving at the
bungalow that afternoon, and it had come about in this way.</p>

<p>The woman at the Bradwell post office had a brother who was
on the staff of the <i>Chelmsford Chronicle,</i> and in great
glee she tipped off to him what was going on. The reporter
scented a good story, and, as a country agent for the <i>Daily
Messenger</i> of London, sensed a nice little addition to his
banking account. So, unlike the Chelmsford superintendent,
having no helpers to gather together, he started off on his
motor-bicycle at once, and had obtained several good photographs
of the bungalow, the open window and the waiting carrier, 'who
had discovered the body,' long before the police arrived. He had
also got a photograph of the dog who had 'smelt the
remains.'</p>

<p>He had got even more than that, for he had obtained from the
carrier the whole story of Mrs. Smith's arrival upon the
previous Sunday morning, what she was like in appearance and how
she had been dressed. Then, suddenly remembering how his dog had
wanted to sniff about the bungalow directly the woman had
unlocked the door, the carrier had become greatly excited and
stated that most probably the murderer had been actually hiding
in the house when they arrived.</p>

<p>So, the young reporter, besides the photographs, had got page
after page of good and&mdash;what he called&mdash;'meaty' notes
before the police arrived upon the scene, and in consequence,
was not caring very much whether they snubbed him or not. But,
to his great delight, he saw the Chelmsford Superintendent, whom
he knew well, was with the party, and the former, coming out of
the bungalow in a few minutes, gave him several pieces of
information to add to those he already had. He was told the
woman had been shot with a small rook rifle, had evidently been
killed on that Sunday morning, and that the motive for the crime
looked like being robbery.</p>

<p>The next morning the <i>Daily Messenger</i> had a great
scoop, coming out with a large photograph upon it's front page,
under big leaded type of <b>'DREADFUL MURDER IN BUNGALOW AT
BRADWELL UPON THE LONELY ESSEX COAST.'</b></p>

<p>Then it went on to give details of the arrival of the woman
at the bungalow upon the Sunday morning, with the murderer
probably being already in hiding in the house, how she had been
shot through the heart and how for two and a half days her body
had lain just where it had fallen upon the floor. It hinted
darkly here how the body had started to decompose under the
burning summer heat in the small shut-up bungalow.</p>

<p>Then it went on to suggest there was certainly something very
mysterious about the whole affair. The bungalow did not belong
to the woman, as she had made out to the man who had brought her
boxes, but to a well-to-do-looking London gentleman who came
down at occasional week-ends with a lady, said to be his wife.
The gentleman's name was supposed to be William Hale and he had
given out in the village that he came from London, but there was
no such name in the London Directory or in the telephone book
either.</p>

<p>Another reason why it was believed Mr. Hale was a Londoner
was because when he brought down a cleaner to go through the
bungalow, which he occasionally did on Saturdays, he drove her
into Southminster to catch the evening train and then it was for
London she always took her ticket. The mysterious thing about
this cleaner was that the description the Southminster porters
gave of her tallied exactly with that of the murdered woman who
had given her name to the carrier as Mrs. Smith and stated she
was the owner of the bungalow.</p>

<p>Then, there was another thing which was very mystifying, the
<i>Daily Messenger</i> went on. The murderer was intending to
rob as well as kill, for he had packed up considerable plunder
to take away. Something, however, had frightened him at the last
moment and he had, apparently, left in a great hurry, empty-handed.
But that was not all which needed explanation. How could
the presence of the so many valuable things found in that lonely
little sea-side bungalow be accounted for? There was a quantity
of valuable silver ware, out of all proportion to the amount
which would ever have been needed there, and also, valuable
silver candlesticks and antique silver snuff-boxes, which were
probably of great value, too. What did it all mean?</p>

<p>Then it went on to give descriptions of the dead woman and
Mr. William Hale, the latter description having been obtained
from the Bradwell villagers.</p>

<p>Finally, it enjoined its readers that if any of them thought
they recognised Mrs. Smith or Mr. Hale from these descriptions,
would they please come forward at once and give the authorities
all the help they could.</p>

<p>Larose saw the article first and, arriving at the Yard,
rushed in to Inspector Stone at once.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" he exclaimed, thrusting the newspaper under
Stone's eyes. "This is Hake's bungalow photographed here and the
murdered woman is Hake's Berkeley Square housekeeper, Mrs.
Rawson. The description is hers, exactly."</p>

<p>Stone read the article very carefully through and then looked
up significantly at Larose. "And are you sure it is the
housekeeper?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It's her description," nodded Larose, "tall, angular,
sharp-featured, dark and with greying hair." He pointed to the
telephone upon the desk. "Ring up 13 Berkeley Square and ask if
Mrs. Rawson's there. That'll settle it."</p>

<p>Stone got through at once. "That the late Sir Roger Hake's
house?. . . Who's speaking?. . . Oh, the parlourmaid, but I want
to speak to Mrs. Rawson. . . . She's not there. She's left, has
she. Then when did she leave? . . . Very early last Sunday
morning. . . . Did she take any boxes with her?. . . Oh, three
more large ones. . . . You don't know to where she went? . . .
You don't think it might have been to Bradwell? .. . Yes,
Bradwell. BRADWELL, in Essex. . . . Oh, you've never heard of
it! Thank you. Good morning."</p>

<p>He turned to Larose. "It looks a clinch," he nodded. "The
girl says she had been sending boxes away all last week. Then
depend upon it she had been robbing the Hake Estate and someone
got to know the value of the stuff she'd got down there and
killed her for it."</p>

<p>"Unless&mdash;unless," commented Larose slowly and he
regarded his colleague intently, "the Hake Court butler got to
know she was there and did her in."</p>

<p>"Gad, I never thought of that," exclaimed Stone, his eyes
sticking out like marbles. "He may have gone there and had a
violent row and shot her because of her having drugged his
little sweetheart." He thumped his fist upon the desk. "And by
Jupiter, if he shot her, what about his having shot Sir Roger as
well? Wouldn't he have had the same motive of revenge there?" He
snapped his fingers together triumphantly. "Oh, how this may
simplify everything for us!"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "Don't be too sure, Charlie. Huntley
may never have been away from Hake Court. He may have a cast-iron
alibi."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll soon find out about that," said Stone. "I'll
ring up Lady Hake and ask her if he's been away from there since
Sunday," and he made to reach for the telephone upon the
desk.</p>

<p>But Larose pulled back his hand. "No, no, don't do that," he
said. "We mustn't give him any warning. We must take him on the
hop. That'll be the best way. He's a clever man, this
Huntley."</p>

<p>"Sharp as a weasel," growled Stone. "Very likely he staged
all that packing up of valuables to make everyone believe it was
them the murderer had come after." He nodded. "You're right,
Gilbert. We'll go down to Chelmsford, and then to this bungalow
first. I'll ring Chelmsford and tell them we're coming."</p>

<p>But his own telephone rang at that moment and, as he listened
into the receiver, his face puckered up in great surprise. "All
right, send them up at once," he said. He turned to Larose.
"Now, that's devilish funny. Two young men want to speak to
somebody here about the Bradwell murder. They say they can tell
something about it."</p>

<p>"By Jove, what an extraordinary coincidence!" exclaimed
Larose.</p>

<p>The door opened and two young fellows about twenty years of
age were ushered in. "Sit down," smiled Stone. "We are
Inspectors Larose and Stone, and we shall be very glad to hear
anything you have to say."</p>

<p>The elder of the two produced a copy of the <i>Daily
Messenger</i> from his pocket and pointed to the photograph of
the Bradwell bungalow. "We were down there last Sunday," he said
rather nervously, "and picnicked on that bit of lawn. You can
see some of the pieces of paper I'm sorry we left behind. What
we want to tell you is that we arrived there exactly at ten
minutes to eleven and as we were sauntering along, about a
hundred and fifty yards before we got there, we heard a sound
like a rifle-shot."</p>

<p>Stone frowned. "Let me be quite certain of what you say. You
and your friend here were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And two young ladies, as well," broke in the young fellow.
"We all heard the shot and you can ask them too. We'll give you
their addresses."</p>

<p>"All right," smiled Stone. "Then, you arrived there exactly
at ten minutes to eleven. How do you come to remember the time?
Oh, you looked at your watch and remarked it should be just
high-water?" He pointed to the newspaper. "Have you read there
that the carrier said he brought the woman to the bungalow soon
after half-past ten?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded the young fellow, "and that's what made us come
here. We're certain now we heard the firing of the shot which
killed her."</p>

<p>"What did you do when you heard the shot fired?" asked
Larose,</p>

<p>"We all of us looked round," was the reply, "and wondered
where on earth it had come from. Then we thought it had come
from a boat we saw out at sea. We knew sound travels a long way
over water."</p>

<p>They were asked several more questions, their names and
addresses were taken and then they were dismissed with many
thanks for having come forward.</p>

<p>"And that gives us proof positive," remarked Stone, "that the
murderer was in the place when the woman and carrier arrived."
He grinned. "Won't we just astound the Chelmsford lot when we
tell them what we know."</p>

<p>And certainly the Chelmsford Superintendent was astounded
when Larose identified the body in the mortuary. He recognised
it as Mrs. Rawson at once.</p>

<p>The police photographs were brought out and scrutinised
carefully by the two inspectors while Superintendent Wilson
unfolded the whole story.</p>

<p>"And we found no fresh finger-marks," he said, "except those
of the deceased woman. Whoever packed that silver so carefully
was undoubtedly wearing gloves. Upon the rifle with which the
woman was shot there were no finger-marks at all, but upon the
double-barrelled shot-gun there were plenty of hers. Evidently
she had got the gun in her hands when she was hit with the
bullet which killed her."</p>

<p>"And your surgeon says she had been dead longer than two days
when she was found?" asked Stone. "He reckons she was killed on
Sunday morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is sure of it," nodded the Superintendent, "and
apart from what you now tell me those young picknickers told
you, we should have been pretty certain of it too. You see the
woman had not even taken off her hat to put away any of the
perishable provisions she had brought with her before she was
killed. No, we had already come to the conclusion she had been
killed by someone who was hiding in the house when she
arrived."</p>

<p>The Superintendent then accompanied them to the bungalow at
Bradwell, where two plain-clothes men had been left in
charge.</p>

<p>"We've only removed the body as yet," he explained, "and so
you will see everything practically exactly as we found it and
as when the murderer left it when he fled away."</p>

<p>Inspector Stone, after looking round for a few minutes, at
once gave his opinion. "See here, Superintendent," he said. "I
think this appearance of the killer having suddenly been
frightened away is all a put-up job to mislead us. Look at it in
this light. The fellow had all day to pack up that silver,
because he was imprisoned here from before eleven until after
six. You agree, that as long as those picnickers were parked
upon that bit of grass, he couldn't have cut off without being
seen?"</p>

<p>"Hardly," nodded the Superintendent, "with no windows at the
back and the kitchen door opening at the side. It would have
been too risky. He'd have been certain to have been
noticed."</p>

<p>"Then why the devil," went on Stone, "didn't he have all the
stuff ready for the first moment when he would be able to get
away? Why did he sit here all day long doing nothing?"</p>

<p>The Superintendent made no reply and Larose took up the tale.
"But what makes me rather think he never intended to go off with
anything," he said, "is his leaving this twenty-seven pounds in
notes behind upon the floor. When he'd killed the woman it's any
odds he'd have looked into her bag at once. That'd have been the
first thing he'd have done and, finding the notes, he'd have
pocketed them carefully. If he'd have done it carefully they
wouldn't have dropped out of his pocket, but if he had done it
carelessly they would have shown signs of having been crumpled
up." He pointed to the notes lying upon the table. "And they
don't show any signs of crumpling, do they?"</p>

<p>"And now for that darned butler," nodded Stone, grimly, as
they drove away. "I shall be very disappointed if he wasn't away
on Sunday on that motor-bicycle of his, and didn't get back
until well after dark."</p>

<p>"It's a long shot, Charlie," commented Larose warningly, "and
if we do find he was away, depend upon it he'll have some good
tale ready of where he was. We shan't catch him out easily."</p>

<p>Arriving at Hake Court, to their dismay it was the
parlourmaid who answered the door. "Damnation, he's bolted,"
muttered Stone under his breath. He forced a smile upon his
lips. "I wanted to see Mr. Huntley for a couple of minutes," he
said. "Isn't he in?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir," smiled back the parlourmaid, "he's having his
dinner. He went into Saffron Walden for her ladyship and that
made him late. But he's just finishing, sir, and I'll go and
send him to you at once."</p>

<p>"Tell him there's no hurry," said Stone, pleasantly. "We can
wait five or ten minutes. Let him finish his dinner."</p>

<p>The parlourmaid looked rather shocked. "Oh, sir, he wouldn't
do that. He won't keep you waiting. I'm sure he'll come at
once."</p>

<p>She showed them into a little room at the end of the hall,
and turning to go, almost collided with Huntley himself. He was
all smiles as he inclined himself respectfully towards the
inspectors. "I heard your voice, sir," he said, addressing
Inspector Stone, "and thought I'd better come myself."</p>

<p>Stone's heart sank a little at the perfect composure of the
man and there was no answering smile upon his face. He unmasked
his guns instantly. "Where were you on Sunday, Huntley?" he
asked very sternly.</p>

<p>The smile faded from the butler's face. There was no
mistaking the sharpness of the tone in which he was being
addressed and he looked curiously at the inspector. "Upon my
motor-bicycle, sir," he replied without the slightest
hesitation. "It was my Sunday off duty."</p>

<p>"Where did you go?" snapped Stone.</p>

<p>"Along the South Coast, sir," he said, "from Hastings to
Brighton."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Stone and he stared hard and long at the
butler so long that it was soon obvious the latter had become
uncomfortable. He got rather red.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir?" he asked respectfully. "I expect you
you mean something."</p>

<p>"I do," replied Stone and his stare was a long one again, as
the butler moistened his lips and swallowed. Then Stone asked
with his face as black as thunder, "Seen the newspaper, this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"<i>The Daily Messenger?</i>"</p>

<p>"No, sir, <i>The Times</i> and <i>Daily Telegraph.</i> We
don't take the <i>Messenger.</i>"</p>

<p>"Then you don't know what's happened?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>The butler's tone was quite calm and even. "No, sir, that is
if it's anything particular."</p>

<p>The inspector pretended to laugh. "You lie well, Huntley," he
sneered, "but not well enough to deceive us." His tone hardened
viciously. "You were at Bradwell on Sunday."</p>

<p>The butler made no pretence at not remembering the name.</p>

<p>"Where my late master had that bungalow, sir!" he exclaimed.
He shook his head. "No, sir, I have never been there. I don't
know that part of the coast at all. The roads are not good."</p>

<p>"A-ah," snorted Stone, "then you know where it is?"</p>

<p>Huntley looked very grim. "I have reason to know, sir." He
inclined his head in the direction of Larose. "I expect that
gentleman has told you about my girl friend, Elsie Bane."</p>

<p>Watching him like a cat bent upon the torture of a mouse,
Stone almost hissed out his next words. "Then you pretend not to
know Mrs. Rawson was murdered at Bradwell on Sunday
morning?"</p>

<p>Huntley's eye-brows lifted, his mouth opened and it seemed he
was not breathing in his surprise. Then he clenched his hands
and his face took on a look of hate. "I did not know it, sir,
but I'm glad of it." He took out his handkerchief and spat into
it. "I would have murdered her myself if I could have been sure
of not being found out."</p>

<p>"You did murder her," thundered Stone. "We can prove it."</p>

<p>"You can prove it!" exclaimed Huntley bewilderedly. His face
all suddenly crimsoned up in fury. "And who's the liar now?" he
shouted. Then, on the instant his whole expression changed, his
face fell into respectful lines again and he went quickly, "Oh,
I beg your pardon, sir. I ought not to have spoken like that. I
quite forgot myself." He spoke decisively. "No, sir, I did not
murder the woman. I was many miles away out of Essex on
Sunday."</p>

<p>Stone was most disturbed by the man's confident air, but he
scoffed sarcastically, "And you will be able to prove that, of
course?"</p>

<p>The butler nodded, "I can prove I was in Hastings, sir, on
Sunday, as I met Mr. Chater and Doctor King-Harley there. They
spoke to me on the sea-front."</p>

<p>A cold shiver ran down Stone's spine. If what the man was
saying could be corroborated, then everything was knocked
instantly upon the head. It was a terrible disappointment. He
clutched at a straw, having, however, to pull himself together
to steady his voice. "What time was that?" he snapped.</p>

<p>Huntley considered. "The hotels had not been open long, so I
should say it was very soon after half-past twelve, sir. They
were just going into the Victoria Hotel, I expect, for
lunch."</p>

<p>"But that doesn't say you didn't go down to Bradwell
afterwards?" scowled Stone, hoping now against hope that the
woman might after all have been killed later in the day than
they all had been thinking.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir, I quite see that," agreed Huntley. He shook his
head emphatically. "But I didn't. I went on to Eastbourne and
Brighton and didn't get home here until half-past ten." Stone's
hopes seemed to revive. "And we shall want witnesses to testify
to where you were late in the day," he said very sternly. "Who
can you bring?"</p>

<p>For the first time Huntley looked crestfallen and uneasy.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't suppose I can bring anyone, sir," he
faltered. "I met no other people I know and who among that
holiday crowd would remember any particular motor-bicycle? There
were thousands of us about."</p>

<p>"What did you do at Eastbourne and Brighton?" asked
Stone.</p>

<p>"Nothing much, sir, I just sat on the front and watched the
people."</p>

<p>"Where did you go for your meals?"</p>

<p>"I didn't go anywhere. I bought some sandwiches at a shop in
Seaside Road in Eastbourne and some lemonade and more sandwiches
in King Street in Brighton."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and Stone said very sternly. "Well,
you're under very grave suspicion about the woman and now, about
your late master, too. You had a spite against both of them on
account of that girl, and," he nodded, "it looks to me as if
you've taken your revenge." He spoke briskly. "So, you'll have
to come back to town with us while we make some enquiries. I
tell you the matter's very serious."</p>

<p>Huntley's face paled. "Oh, but you can't do that, sir," he
said. "Look at the disgrace for me. People will think you've
taken me up because I killed the master. They will never forget
it. My good name will be gone for life."</p>

<p>"We can't help that," said Stone. "We can't let you remain
free until you're cleared."</p>

<p>"But I shan't run away," pleaded Huntley. "I've nothing to
run away for." His voice firmed. "And you've no right to arrest
me, Inspector Stone. You said Mrs. Rawson was killed on Sunday
morning and I couldn't have done that and been in Hastings at
the same time. If you only want to know about the morning, ring
up either of those gentlemen I mention&mdash;or both of them.
It's so very simple, for they'll be able to tell you at once."
He spoke defiantly. "If you do take me up and shame me before
everybody I claim the right to ring up a lawyer first. I shall
want to speak to Mr. Cole Nathan."</p>

<p>Stone frowned. The butler was playing a stronger card than he
knew. The police hated Nathan. He had got them a nasty rap over
the knuckles quite recently for being, so a learned judge had
said, too precipitate.</p>

<p>"Why do you mention Mr. Nathan?" asked the inspector
suspiciously. "Have you already had him in your mind to defend
you?"</p>

<p>"I've never thought of him before, sir," said Huntley,
returning to his meek and respectful manner. "I shall only
choose him, sir, because I have often seen his name in the
paper. He seems a very good man."</p>

<p>Stone looked meaningly at Larose and, the latter nodding, he
turned back to the butler. "All right," he said, "I'll ring up.
But you remain here. I know where the telephone is," and left
the room, leaving the two together.</p>

<p>"What did you go into Saffron Walden for?" asked Larose
curiously.</p>

<p>"For her ladyship, sir," replied Huntley. "She sent me to get
some special fruit for Hepburn, the gardener at the lodge. He's
in the village hospital, very ill. They say he's got pneumonia
in one lung and a cancer in the other."</p>

<p>Stone could not get Byles Chater on the 'phone, the latter
being busy in the Courts, but, after some delay he got speech
with Dr. King-Harley. The quiet specialist was very annoyed at
being interrupted and in a tremendous hurry.</p>

<p>"Yes, we saw the man there on Sunday," he said, "I only
nodded but Mr. Chater spoke to him. Of course, it was the Court
butler, Mr. Chater chaffed him about having his eye upon the
other sex. I should say it was about half-past twelve, perhaps a
few minutes later. We were just going to have our lunch."</p>

<p>"And he wasn't there when you came out?" asked Stone. "That
was the last you saw of him?"</p>

<p>"No, he wasn't there, but that wasn't the last we saw of him.
He passed us in Eastbourne in the evening."</p>

<p>"Oh, but he didn't tell me that!" exclaimed Stone.</p>

<p>"Probably he didn't see us," returned the doctor. "It was in
the main street and there was a lot of traffic at the moment. It
wasn't a time for looking round. Well, good morning, I can't
tell you anything more," and he rang off hurriedly, as if afraid
of being further questioned.</p>

<p>"That's that," sighed Stone as he hung up the receiver. "What
a ghastly sell!"</p>

<p>Returning to the little room, he spoke very sternly to
Huntley. "We'll give you the benefit of the doubt," he said,
"and let you remain here for the present." He raised his hand
warningly. "But mind, no leaving the Court. You're not to use
your motor-bicycle until we give you permission."</p>

<p>The butler received his reprieve with no outward sign of
jubilation. "Thank you, sir," he said meekly. "You'll always
find me here."</p>

<p>He accompanied them to the front door and with a curt nod
they got into their car and drove away, Larose being at the
wheel. Then the moment they had turned the bend in the short
drive and were out of sight of the house, Larose stopped the car
and alighted quickly.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," he said to his surprised companion. "I've
got an idea. I won't be long," and back he ran towards the
Court, making his way, however, along the strip of grass at the
side of the gravelled drive. His footsteps made no sound.</p>

<p>Arriving at the front of the house, he found, as was always
the case during the daytime, the outer hall door wide open and
the inner, a glass-panelled one, closed but unlocked. Tiptoeing
softly into the hall, he looked round for the butler, but the
latter was nowhere to be seen. He heard rustling, however, from
the direction of the little room where they had just had their
interview with him, and walking to the doorway, saw the man
himself with a newspaper held wide open between his two
outspread arms and with his head bent close to the pages. He
looked up, startled, as the shadow of Larose fell across the
room, and then for a good ten seconds, without a word, the two
stared at each other very solemnly. Then Larose smiled,
and&mdash;after a moment&mdash;Huntley smiled, too. The
detective's smile had evidently been infectious. "I've come back
for my paper," he said.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," said the butler, and folding it up, he
handed it to him.</p>

<p>Larose was still smiling. "You're a clever chap, Huntley," he
remarked pleasantly, "and it would be a pity to stretch your
neck."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," agreed the butler, smiling back, "and I don't
think you'll be allowed to do it."</p>

<p>"No, I don't think we shall, either," said Larose, quite
serious now. "You've been too clever for us," and he nodded his
thanks as Huntley let him out of the hall.</p>

<p>He rejoined the impatient Stone and was soon bustling the car
towards London. "Well," exclaimed the inspector, "what do you
think?"</p>

<p>"Think?" laughed Larose. "Oh, that he did it, of course! But
we shan't trip him and another killer will have got off with his
kill!" He seemed amused. "When I went back just now he'd got his
nose buried in our <i>Messenger.</i>"</p>

<p>"Quite natural," commented Stone, "he wanted to read the
report of his own murder."</p>

<p>"But he wasn't reading about the murder," exclaimed Larose.
"That's the damning part of it. He was reading the sporting
page, inside." He pressed home his point. "Just think of it,
Charlie. If we'd given him the first news of that woman's death
and he'd not seen it in the <i>Messenger</i> when he went into
Saffron Walden this morning&mdash;wouldn't his first urge
directly we had gone been to read all about it? Wouldn't he have
glued his eyes to the photograph of that bungalow which had
meant so much to him and Elsie Bane? Why, of course he
would!"</p>

<p>"Of course!" agreed Stone violently. "Damn him!"</p>

<p>"It's all a puzzle," sighed Larose, "and I can't make head or
tail of it. Men like Chater and King-Harley are not going to
perjure themselves for Huntley and yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll see Chater this evening," growled Stone, "and
I'll talk to that quack again, too. If there's any hanky-panky
I'll nose it out."</p>

<p>But the inspector did not nose out anything. Chater and the
doctor corroborated each other's stories in minute details, and
corroborated them with such accuracy that, while they swept away
one suspicion, they seemed to raise another.</p>

<p>Still nothing could be done and the angry inspector relieved
his feelings by ferocious threats as to what was going to happen
to everyone involved at the forthcoming resumption of the
inquest upon Sir Roger Hake.</p>

<p>"Wickham Adders will give 'em hell," he said. "It seems to me
that every man jack of them&mdash;and, of course, the woman
too&mdash;is a liar."</p>

<p>And while the Law was striving its utmost to give one victim
to Death, Death himself was preparing to snatch another one in
the little village adjoining the Court.</p>

<p>Andy Hepburn, the dour custodian of the lodge gates was dying
and the only person who seemed really sorry about it was his
young mistress. His dog-like devotion to her, unspoken but so
artlessly apparent whenever she was near him, had touched her
deeply and every day she came to the little hospital to see him.
She brought him little gifts, and stroked his hand and said she
hoped he would soon be better, and his old eyes never left her
face the whole time she was in the room.</p>

<p>A few days before the Coroner's Court was to sit again, when
she arrived to see him she found him very weak, and the sister
in charge told her the doctor thought it was now only a matter
of hours before he would pass away.</p>

<p>She stopped a little while talking to him, and he was quite
coherent and able to speak to her, too. When she left him,
however, he closed his eyes as if he were very tired and wanted
to sleep.</p>

<p>The sister and the nurse stood at the window watching her
drive away in her car. "Isn't she lovely!" exclaimed the nurse,
"but just fancy everyone thinking she killed her husband."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't say that," reproached the sister sharply.
"Everyone doesn't think she killed him, only some do."</p>

<p>"Well, they say all the detectives believe she did," nodded
the nurse, "and that it'll go badly with her at the inquest. Mr.
Pike at the 'Rose and Crown' told Mother that she even might be
arrested. Things look very black for her. You see they can't
find anybody else to fix the murder upon."</p>

<p>Still talking, they went out of the room. Old Andy had got
his eyes wide open now, and his expression was a startled one.
An hour passed and he had made no attempt to go to sleep, rather
he seemed intent upon keeping himself wide awake.</p>

<p>The doctor, a kind-faced elderly man, came in presently, and
asked him how he felt.</p>

<p>"Weak, weak," nodded Andy. He looked intently at the doctor.
"Don't ye gammon me. I'm goin' to die, ain't I?"</p>

<p>The doctor nodded back solemnly, "But you won't feel any
pain, Andy. You'll just sleep away."</p>

<p>The old man looked anxious. "But I want to tell something
afore I die." His eyes held the doctor. "I want to tell it was
me what killed the master."</p>

<p>"What, you shot Sir Roger?" exclaimed the doctor, looking
horrified. "Are you sure you did?"</p>

<p>Andy nodded again. "Bring Policeman Blake here. He can write
it all down." He spoke in a whisper. "Do it quick, Mister. I
feel I'm pegging out."</p>

<p>The doctor went straight to the telephone and in less than
five minutes the village constable was sitting by the bedside,
with a writing-pad upon his knee, all ready to take down the
sick man's dying depositions. The doctor and the sister was
standing on either side of the bed.</p>

<p>The constable was round-faced and, at first sight, would have
seemed to anyone rather simple looking. His actions, now,
however, showed that he was very much all there. "Andy's mind's
quite all right, sir?" he asked the doctor. "He'll understand
what he's saying?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly well," nodded the doctor. "He's as conscious as
you or I, and in a perfect mental state."</p>

<p>"Well, you tell us, Andy, what you want to say," went on the
constable, "just in your own words now and I'll write it
down."</p>

<p>Andy spoke slowly and as if concentrating his thoughts with
some effort. "I shot Master with that pistol," he said very
slowly. "Names don't matter and I ain't going to mention any,
but he'd behaved badly with a girl I knew. I've hated him for
years and I am glad I did it."</p>

<p>"Go on," said the constable, because Andy had stopped
speaking. "Tell us how you came to do it."</p>

<p>Andy went on. "It was chance-like that I shot him. I'd
forgotten to loose the dogs that night and went to do it very
late. The rain was heavy as I was going and I went into the
summer-house to shelter. I saw Master had left his pistol there,
as he sometimes did. When the rain got better I walked towards
the house. I saw Master's study window was open and was going to
leave the pistol on the sill. When I got near the light went up
and I saw Master in the room. I hadn't meant to do it, but
something made me think of the girl and I pointed the pistol at
him and fired it off. Then I got frightened and threw it away,
but I knew I could not be found out."</p>

<p>The old man sighed heavily and closed his eyes. The doctor
nodded to the constable. "That'll do," he said, "He's had
enough," and he added whisperingly, "Let him sign it, quick. His
heart's very dicky, and we can't be certain of even a few
minutes."</p>

<p>So Andy scrawled his name at the foot of the paper and the
policeman, the doctor and the sister all witnessed his
signature.</p>

<p>Then it was a very breathless and important constable who
rushed to the 'phone to ring up the Superintendent in Saffron
Walden. But the latter was out and did not hear about the
confession until the evening. Whereupon he drove post-haste into
the village to see Andy, but the doctor definitely refused to
allow his patient to be worried any more that day, and the
Superintendent went grumblingly away. He rang up Scotland Yard,
but could only get speech with Larose who was absolutely
astounded at his news.</p>

<p>"But I am disgusted with myself!" exclaimed the
Superintendent. "I ought to have thought of that man in the
first instance. He had every opportunity for, of course, those
dogs wouldn't have interfered with him. It was my darned nose
which misled me. I was so positive I smelt that cordite when I
went into the room."</p>

<p>Larose was very annoyed with himself, too. He had built up so
many elaborate theories about the murder and&mdash;all in one
moment&mdash;they had been knocked on the head by one of the
most simple explanations possible. As with the Superintendent,
he told himself he ought to have thought of the lodge-keeper at
once as a possible suspect. It was most careless and remiss on
his part.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he frowned heavily. He was puzzled, very
puzzled. This confession did not explain the mystery of that
guttered candle and it did not account for Reeder's worried
condition of mind. If the trainer's hints to his wife had meant
anything, they had meant a conspiracy somewhere, and how did
that fit in with the lodge-keeper's confession? It didn't fit in
at all.</p>

<p>Filled with doubts, Larose made up his mind to go down and
see Andy Hepburn the first thing the next morning. Accordingly,
on the morrow, it was barely half-past eight when he pulled up
outside the cottage hospital.</p>

<p>Then, announcing who he was to the sister, he received a
terrible disappointment when he was told that the sick man had
passed away during the night.</p>

<p>"Bad luck!" said Larose. "Still, it can't be helped." A
thought struck him and he asked, "Did anyone see him after he
had made that confession which I understand you witnessed? I
mean, of course, anyone to do with the police."</p>

<p>The sister shook her head. "No, the Saffron Walden
Superintendent came last night and was very annoyed because upon
the doctor's instructions, I wouldn't let him come in." She
smiled. "He seemed to look upon it as a personal affront."</p>

<p>Larose smiled back. "Well, we policemen get upset very
easily. We're built that way." He sighed. "But about this poor
chap who died, he went off very suddenly, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he'd just written a little letter," replied the sister.
"One minute he was talking and the next he was dead."</p>

<p>"He'd written a letter?" exclaimed Larose. "Was he as well as
that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was only a few words, just for Lady Hake," said the
sister. "He asked me for a piece of paper and wrote a few words
and I gave him an envelope and licked it up for him." She turned
to the desk. "Here it is. It's quite pathetic, addressed to
'Mistress.' He was so devoted to her."</p>

<p>Larose looked at the envelope with the one word scrawled
across it. "Yes, it's very sad," he said. He nodded. "I'm going
up to the Court now. Should I give it her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you'll be so kind. And tell her ladyship those
carnations she brought him yesterday were in his hand when he
died."</p>

<p>They talked on for a few minutes and then Larose took his
leave. "By-the-by," he said in parting, "I don't think you'd
better mention about the letter you've given me to take to Lady
Hake." He laughed. "The Superintendent may think you ought to
have given it to him."</p>

<p>"I won't mention it," she laughed back. "No one but me knows
he wrote it."</p>

<p>Larose next visited the village constable and the local
doctor, at once realising that their testimonies would be
conclusive as to Andy having been in his right mind and knowing
perfectly well what he was saying when he had dictated his
confession.</p>

<p>Next, he went up to the Court, intending to ask Lady Hake
bluntly if she could account for Hepburn's hatred of her
husband. He was going to tell her, too, that with the confession
in the hands of the police it might not now be necessary to call
her at the inquest.</p>

<p>To his disappointment, Huntley informed him that Lady Hake
was away for the day, visiting her mother who was ill. He gave
him the address at Maida Vale.</p>

<p>Larose eyed the butler curiously. "And what do you think
about this confession the lodge-keeper made. I suppose you've
heard about it."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir, the doctor for the village here came up at once
and told her ladyship. I can't understand it, sir. It seems
incredible to me. I knew Andy didn't like the master, but then
he never liked anyone much. He was a very bad-tempered man."</p>

<p>"Did you know he was a crack-shot with a pistol?"</p>

<p>Huntley looked flabbergasted at the question. "I shouldn't
think he'd ever had one in his hands before, sir. It was a
marvellous fluke he hit the master."</p>

<p>"Well, good morning, Huntley," said Larose. He smiled
pleasantly. "About your own little affair, I sympathise with
you, but we'll get you yet. I don't believe for a moment you're
the simple innocent you make out. You did that woman in right
enough."</p>

<p>Huntley was most respectful. "Very good, sir, if you say so."
The corners of his mouth twitched. "But I'm afraid, sir, you'll
have a trouble in proving it."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the difficulty," said Larose. "You've well
beaten us up till now."</p>

<p>Larose had a short talk with the Superintendent in Saffron
Walden and then returned to town, taking the lodge-keeper's
confession with him to give to Stone. But going, first, to his
own room in Scotland Yard, he took out of his pocket the letter
Andy had written, intending to put it in another envelope and
post it to Lady Hake.</p>

<p>Noticing, however, that the flap of the rather stiff envelope
had become unstuck, after a moment's hesitation, he took out the
piece of paper inside and glanced over the shaky characters
scrawled right across the page.</p>

<p>For the moment his look was only a mildly curious one, but
suddenly his expression altered to one of amazement in which
consternation was mingled.</p>

<p>His mouth was dry and he breathed a little quicker as he read
aloud to himself. 'Dear Mistress, I told them that to help you.
I heard the nurse say the police were after you, but now you
will be safe. I'm glad you did it. Your humble servant, Andy
Hepburn.'</p>

<p>For a long minute he could not withdraw his eyes from the
paper, but then he refolded it carefully and put it back into
the envelope. 'And if this becomes public property,' he
murmured, 'it will look almost certainly,' he could hardly get
out his words, 'as if she were guilty, and somehow, Andy had
come to learn it. No, he was not a man of imaginative nature,
and perhaps, he did go out to unloose those dogs that night and
was actually an eye-witness of the murder.' He sighed heavily.
'Then good Lord, what a tragic ending for that girl!'</p>

<p>He put the letter into his pocket and went in to see
Inspector Stone. The latter had, of course, already heard about
Hepburn's confession, but now he read it through intently.</p>

<p>"And what a tame conclusion to everything," he exclaimed. He
shook his head disappointedly. "There will be no chance now of
us showing everyone what clever chaps we are." He shrugged his
shoulders. "Still, to have done it we should have had to break
that poor little woman on the wheel."</p>

<p>"And you think," asked Larose slowly, "that but for this
confession we had a strong case against her?"</p>

<p>"The very strongest," replied Stone. He nodded significantly.
"And didn't everyone else think so, too? All those seven
card-players, and that darned butler as well, were doing their utmost
to shield her." He laughed ironically. "Gosh, what a sell! They
all had their trouble for nothing." He tapped the confession
upon the desk. "Well, with this confession here everything will
die down. There's no getting behind it. It's a complete
clearance for everyone else."</p>

<p>Larose made no further comment and said nothing about the
letter in his pocket. The next morning, however, he went down to
Hake Court once again, having taken upon himself the serving of
the subpoenas upon those there who were to be called at the
adjourned inquest. He gave the butler his, and then was shown in
to Harland in the office.</p>

<p>"Here is your subpoena," he said sharply, "and I have one
here for Lady Hake, but whether I serve it upon her or not
depends upon what you tell me in the next few minutes."</p>

<p>Young Harland looked very troubled. "Can't you spare her, Mr.
Larose?" he asked. "She's suffered such a lot already and to
appear in the witness-box will be a dreadful trial for her."</p>

<p>"Of course, it will," nodded Larose, and he added
significantly, "It will be a dreadful trial for you, too, as you
will be terrified every moment as to what may be coming
out."</p>

<p>"And what exactly do you mean by that?" asked Harland
frowningly and with some spirit.</p>

<p>"I mean," said Larose slowly, "that you two will be perjuring
yourselves the whole time, and one little slip, and one or other
of you will be arrested and charged with the murder." He raised
his voice slightly. "Oh, I won't beat about the bush! Either you
or she shot Sir Roger and one of you will have to confess it to
save the other."</p>

<p>Harland laughed scoffingly. "And what about that confession
of Andy Hepburn?" he asked sarcastically. "Does that count for
nothing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for nothing," nodded Larose solemnly, "for nothing, as
you'll admit when you've read this," and, taking the lodge-keeper's
letter from his pocket, he handed it to him. "The man
wrote it just before he died."</p>

<p>A few moments of dreadful silence followed and Harland's face
went a dreadful colour. His hands shook, so that he could hardly
hold the paper.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but, what does it mean?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"Pretty obvious, isn't it?" asked Larose. "It confesses that
what he dictated to that policeman was a lie. As he says, he did
it to save his mistress. Of course, he overheard the nurses
saying we are suspecting her. Everybody seems to have been aware
of that. Oh, you needn't dispute the handwriting. The sister at
the hospital said he wrote it and she'll testify that it's
his."</p>

<p>"I know it is," said Harland hoarsely, with his eyes glued
upon the piece of paper. "I know his handwriting quite well." He
spoke as if to himself. "What a dreadful thing for him to have
written." He looked up suddenly and asked sharply. "But how did
you get hold of it?"</p>

<p>"I happened to be the first one of us who came to the
hospital after he had died," said Larose, "and the sister gave
it to me to pass on to Lady Hake. Then, when I came up here
yesterday to see Lady Hake I found she was away. Back at the
Yard, I noticed that the flap of the envelope had come
unstuck&mdash;you can see for yourself it has never been
properly pressed down&mdash;and I took out the letter and read
it. I should have been justified anyhow in doing that, as I was
strongly suspecting one of you two."</p>

<p>"And what's going to happen now?" asked Harland.</p>

<p>"That depends entirely upon you," said Larose. "So far I am
the only one who has read the letter."</p>

<p>"And if I tear it up," asked Harland, thrusting the hand
holding the letter behind his back, "what then?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have time to," laughed Larose. "I'd be upon you
in half a minute." He spoke quite kindly, "I'm stronger than
you. You're not very big and muscular, are you?"</p>

<p>Harland sighed heavily. "No, that's the worst of it. I've
suffered all my life because I've not been a big fellow." He
brought his hand back. "Here's the letter. Now what do you want
of me?"</p>

<p>"Just the truth," said Larose. "I want to&mdash;&mdash;" He
broke off suddenly. "But tell me, first, does Lady Hake herself
believe that confession the lodge-keeper dictated is true?"</p>

<p>He spoke so quickly that Harland was thrown off his guard and
answered equally quickly, "Most implicitly, she's never doubted
it for a moment."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" snapped Larose triumphantly. "Then it is you who
are the murderer. As I have told you, it is positive to me that
either she or you shot Sir Roger and if you declare with such
certainty she believes in the guilt of that lodge-keeper, then
she is innocent herself." He spoke quietly now. "And, she being
innocent, the guilty one of the two must be you."</p>

<p>"Can you prove that?" asked Harland, equally as quietly.</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "To my own satisfaction," he said. He took out
Mrs. Reeder's letter and handed it to him. "Just read that."</p>

<p>"But you didn't see Mr. Reeder," said Harland, when he had
read it through. He pointed to the date upon that letter. "I saw
in the newspaper he was killed instantaneously that very
evening."</p>

<p>"But I saw his wife," rejoined Larose, "and although her
husband hadn't told her everything she knew a good bit." He
spoke sternly. "I want to know about that conspiracy which was
hatched between you all, the conspiracy in which Reeder was the
most unwilling to join, and took all the time that candle was
burning to be persuaded to do so."</p>

<p>Harland was visibly discomforted. "But what's your game, Mr.
Larose?" he asked sharply. "You want to get me hanged, don't
you?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "Not necessarily, for I have a lot of
sympathy for the person who killed Sir Roger. He was&mdash;at
any rate to men&mdash;a loathsome type, and the world is well
rid of him. No, I am not keen that anyone should be punished for
his murder, as he most probably deserved it and I expect it was
done under great provocation."</p>

<p>"Then leave it alone," pleaded Harland. He pointed to
Hepburn's letter which still lay upon the desk. "Tear that up
and forget it, and untold misery will be saved for some of
us."</p>

<p>Larose smiled. "But you forget my position, young fellow. I
am an emissary of the Law and must have some justification for
what I do. What makes me hesitate now is that, although I have
moral proof that you are guilty, I see that the proof that would
satisfy a court of law may be impossible to obtain." He nodded.
"And in trying to get it I may have to bring harm to a number of
kind well-meaning people whose only fault has been their
good-nature."</p>

<p>"Well, what's your price for silence," asked Harland, looking
very worried, "and what's your promise," he shrugged his
shoulders, "if I tell you what little I know?"</p>

<p>"Little?" queried Larose. He laughed. "I guess it will be a
lot." He became serious. "I don't sell myself and I promise
nothing except that if you can convince me that Lady Hake had
nothing to do with the matter, I will not serve this subpoena
upon her."</p>

<p>"And what about myself?" queried Harland.</p>

<p>"I'll not use anything you say against you, and if I can't
prove you're guilty by my own discoveries, I'll leave you alone.
Oh, and you needn't incriminate the others in anything you tell
me."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to," said Harland sharply. He drew in a deep
breath. "Well, here goes." He spoke quickly. "I shot the brute
and I've never blamed myself for it since. It all came about
like this. When the lights had failed and he was going out he
ordered me to follow him. He knew I knew something about
electricity as I'd put the lights right before. He found his
torch was dead and lit that candle. Then, turning round, I
suppose he didn't like my expression, for he blazed up madly and
asked me why the hell I'd been so long getting those cigarettes.
I just looked at him and he asked sneeringly if I'd stopped to
molest his wife."</p>

<p>Harland's eyes were blazing as he recalled the scene. He went
on. "His sneer infuriated me and I sprang at him to strike his
evil face. But I ought to have known better. He just side-stepped
and escaped the blow. I over-reached myself and he
gripped me like a bear from behind, and holding me tight tipped
up my head and," he shuddered, "spat in my face."</p>

<p>"And neither of you shouted?" asked Larose, because Harland
had stopped speaking, the memory of the spitting crimsoning him
in shame.</p>

<p>Harland shook his head. "I never said a word the whole time
and he spoke through his clenched teeth. No, I just struggled,
but I had no chance and he shook me like a dog with a rat. Then
he called Lady Hake a terrible word and flung me from him on to
the floor. I sprang up and," he shrugged his shoulders, "the
pistol was on the desk and I shot him."</p>

<p>"And then?" asked Larose after the long silence which
followed.</p>

<p>"Then?" smiled Harland. "Well, you must guess what
followed."</p>

<p>Larose considered. "And is the butler in this deal?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord, no!" exclaimed Harland. He smiled again. "But I
believe he thinks I did it because he is being so darned anxious
to do everything for me lately." He laughed nervously. "Very
decent fellow, Huntley, quite a superior sort. I roped him for
some private theatricals I was getting up some months ago in
Saffron Walden. A man failed me at the very last moment, and
Huntley took the part of a doctor. By Jove, he wanted no
coaching. He's an actor, born."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is," nodded Larose feelingly, and he added with
perfect sincerity, "and so are you."</p>

<p>Harland shrugged his shoulders. "I've had to be. These last
dreadful days I've had to act and lie at every twist and turn."
He shook his head gloomily. "Once this dangerous game was
started there was no help for it. As you've guessed I was not
standing alone."</p>

<p>"No, and it doesn't require much imagination now," said
Larose thoughtfully, "to fill in everything that happened." He
frowned. "If it becomes public, the mystery to everyone will be
why six hard-headed men were willing to perjure themselves when
they stood to get absolutely nothing by doing so."</p>

<p>Harland shook his head. "There would be no mystery, Mr.
Larose, if everyone were aware of what had been happening, only
that very evening. They had heard that devil insult his wife at
dinner, then they had seen that bandage upon her arm and all
guessed from his sneering jokes it was a bruise and no sting,
and, as we sat down at the card-tables, he had boasted of a
coarse infidelity, that very afternoon, with some new woman
whose surname he did not even know. Bah&mdash;there was not one
of them who was not glad to see him stretched out dead!"</p>

<p>Larose got up to go. "You can burn that letter," he nodded.
"Yes, do it straightaway and crumple all the ashes well, too.
That's right. Oh, and, of course, Lady Hake won't have that
subpoena now. Good-bye." He smiled. "And if it weren't for what
I am, I'd wish you good luck. As it is, I suppose I'll have to
go on looking for stronger evidence against you."</p>

<p>"And do you think you'll find it?" asked Harland, with a
smile which was not as easy-looking as he would have liked to
make it.</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "I hardly think so, for at any rate my
colleagues won't help me." He nodded. "It may comfort you a
little to know that Inspector Stone is quite satisfied with that
confession of the lodge-keeper, and will not even be coming down
to the inquest, now. Give my kind regards to Lady Hake and tell
her she won't be seeing us any more."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Mr. Larose," said young Harland with some feeling.
He held out his hand. "And thank you very much for your
consideration. Whatever happens I shall always be very grateful
to you."</p>

<p>Huntley, who evidently had been waiting for him in the hall,
gave Larose a beaming smile as the latter went out.</p>

<p>'Really,' grinned Larose to himself as he drove away, 'I seem
to be very popular with the criminal classes just now.'</p>

<p>The adjourned enquiry into the death of Sir Roger Hake was
concluded upon the following Friday, in the village institute.
The Saffron Walden Superintendent appeared for the police and
Larose was present as representative for Scotland Yard. The
proceedings were very short. Byles Chater and young Harland gave
evidence as to Sir Roger leaving the room when the lights had
failed. Huntley told of the finding of the body, later, and Dr.
King-Harley testified how he had found life to be extinct. Then
the village constable appeared in the box and the lodge-keeper's
confession was read. The local doctor gave evidence that Hepburn
was of perfectly sound mind.</p>

<p>The Coroner's summing-up was very brief. There could not be
the slightest doubt, he stated, as to who had committed the
murder and only one possible verdict could be brought in. The
confession of the lodge-keeper was conclusive proof as to where
the guilt lay, and accordingly he directed that a verdict of
wilful murder be recorded against Andrew Hepburn, and the jury
obliged without any delay.</p>

<p>Upon one Monday morning in the autumn of the following year,
Inspector Stone, looking stouter than ever, came into Larose's
room in Scotland Yard and plumped himself down in a chair.</p>

<p>"By Jove, Gilbert!" he exclaimed, heaving a big sigh, "how
time flies." His eyes twinkled. "I had quite a little adventure
on Saturday afternoon and it finished up with three glasses of
champagne."</p>

<p>"Very nice, Charlie," commented Larose, pretending to smack
his lips, "but whose pockets did you pick to buy the fizz? I
know darned well that with all those kids you've got you
couldn't buy it out of your screw."</p>

<p>"I was out in my old car with the missus," went on Stone,
ignoring his colleagues query, "and we were just passing through
a sweet little village a few miles out of Haslemere, when, going
by an old church, I heard the organ playing and stopped the car
to listen. I thought there must be a wedding on because four
posh cars were parked outside, but the missus thought the music
wasn't quite proper for a wedding as they were playing, 'There's
a friend for little children.'"</p>

<p>"But in these days," nodded Larose darkly, "you must expect
everything."</p>

<p>"Well," said Stone, "we had a bit of an argument about it and
so, as there was plenty of time, we waited to see who was
right." His eyes bulged at the relating of the story. "Then,
Gilbert, out came a little lot of people you and I both know.
First, a man in a swell chauffeur's uniform with silver buttons,
and I recognised that chap Huntley, the butler of Hake Court.
Then came a trained nurse with a nipper, all lace and frills and
a little puckered-up face, in her arms." He paused dramatically.
"Now whose baby do you think it was?"</p>

<p>"Not yours, surely?" frowned Larose. "You couldn't have had
anything to do with it." He shook his head. "Still I should not
be surprised."</p>

<p>Stone looked contemptuous but then, confident that he could
afford to be magnanimous in the importance of the news he was
about to impart, his face became smiling again. "It was Lady
Hake's baby," he exclaimed. "Lady Hake, now Mrs. Avon Harland,
and by Jove, she looked as lovely as ever. Much lovelier,
indeed, for now she looked so happy." He asked sharply. "Did you
know they had been married?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded. He knew it well enough, for he had had a piece
of the wedding-cake sent him, addressed in what he guessed was
the one-time dainty Mary Hellister's handwriting.</p>

<p>Stone went on. "But that wasn't all the surprise, by Gosh,
no, for after Mr. and Mrs. Harland came"&mdash;he rolled his
eyes as if in mingled amusement and disgust&mdash;"Byles Chater,
Doctor King-Harley, and Mr. Beachy Head Norton. I learnt
afterwards that Huntley had married that little Bane girl and
was now Norton's chauffeur. Oh, and, of course, Mrs. Norton was
there, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a mix-up!" exclaimed Larose, now much too
interested to want to try and be humorous.</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Stone, "three men whom at one time we would
have arrested upon the capital charge all coming together out of
church, as respectable as you and me and as if butter wouldn't
melt in their mouths."</p>

<p>"And they saw you?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Saw me?" ejaculated Stone. "Why they buzzed around my old
car like a swarm of bees and I had even to kiss the baby! Then
they would make us come up to their place about a mile
away&mdash;I learnt she had sold Hake Court before she had
married&mdash;and drink to the baby's health."</p>

<p>"Very nice, too!" commented Larose. "I wish I had been
there."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you ought to have been," nodded Stone darkly. He
went on sharply: "I say, my boy, have you seen her little
ladyship since those Hake Court days?"</p>

<p>"No, I've not set eyes on her since, but why do you want to
know? What do you mean by that funny look?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing, lad," said Stone. He burst into a loud
guffaw. "Only, they told me one of the baby's names is Gilbert.
Ha, ha, ha!"</p>
