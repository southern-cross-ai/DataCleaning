<br>
<br>
<p>THE Governor having approved of the proposition I had made to
him of going to explore the interior of the country and of trying
to penetrate as far into the Blue Mountains as I should find it
practicable, I went, with a party of four men, to assure myself
of what would be the best route, and to take observations as to
the sites most suitable for the formation of my first
dep&ocirc;ts, at which I could establish communication with the
colony, in case I should find it possible to advance into the
country.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* On this first journey I went as far as about
45 miles, and I chose a site called Nattai at which to establish
my dep&ocirc;t.]</p>
<p>Having completed my observations in a few days, I went back to
Sydney, whence, after receiving the last orders from the
Governor, I started for Parramatta. The necessary provisions had
been prepared at that place, and they were placed in a waggon
drawn by two bullocks.</p>
<p>From Parramatta I went to Prospect Hill with my party,
composed of four soldiers, belonging to the New South Wales
Corps, and five convicts. I found at that rendezvous one of the
natives of the Cow Pastures, named Gogy,** whom I had engaged to
accompany me.</p>
<p class="foot">[** This aboriginal had taken a fancy to me when
on my first journey, and I was interested in preserving his
confidence by my good treatment, thinking he would be useful to
me when I advanced further inland.]</p>
<p>On the 6th November, 1802, I crossed the river Nepean, at a
ford called Binh&eacute;ny by the natives. The banks of this
river, although being too high to allow my team to cross over
with the waggon, were quite practicable for men on foot, its
depth being then about 2 ft. on the eastern bank, diminishing
gradually to 3 or 4 in. on the opposite bank.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The bottom of this river is composed of very
fine sand which retains the imprint and the form of the
undulations of the water. It was thought, on the faith of
groundless reports emanating from several persons, that the
crossing of this river was very dangerous on account of the
quick-sand with which they pretended its bed was formed; but I
never experienced any danger whilst crossing it beyond a sinking
under my feet of 3 or 4 in.]</p>
<p>I was therefore obliged to have my bullocks unyoked and to
have the provisions, as well as the waggon itself, carried by my
men on to the other bank, whence, everything having been replaced
in its proper order, I directed my route towards the south-west.
I continued to walk in that direction, and, at 8 o'clock, I
arrived near a swamp, which the natives called Baraggel, where I
decided to spend the night, feeling rather indisposed. I explored
the borders of this swamp, and I found several rare shells
belonging to a species I had never seen before. I had walked 4
miles on a flat and open country.</p>
<p>The thermometer, at 6 a.m., marked&mdash;50&deg; 30': at noon,
79&deg; 0'; at sunset, 62&deg; 0'; wind, S.E.; sky, cloudy.</p>
<p>On the 7th November, I went towards another swamp, called
Manhangle by the natives,* S. 48&deg; W., and a few miles distant
from the first.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In the swamps of Manhangle, Carabeely, and
others, enormous eels, fishes, and various species of shells are
found, which are sometimes used by the natives as food. They
usually feed upon opossums and squirrels, which are abundant in
that country, and also upon kangaroo-rat and kangaroo, but they
can only catch this last one with the greatest trouble, and they
are obliged to unite in great numbers to hunt it.]</p>
<p>When passing Carabeely,** we saw a kangaroo which we killed,
and after half-an-hour's walk we entered a valley where there was
a herd of wild cattle. I counted 162 of them peaceably pasturing;
they only perceived my party when it was at a short distance from
them.</p>
<p class="foot">[** When the natives assemble together to hunt
the kangaroo, they form a circle which contains an area of 1 or 2
miles, according to the number of natives assembled. They usually
stand about 30 paces apart, armed with spears and tomahawks. When
the circle is formed, each one of them holding a handful of
lighted hark, they at a given signal set fire to the grass and
bush in front of them. In proportion as the fire progresses they
advance forward with their spear in readiness, narrowing the
circle and making as much noise as possible, with deafening
shouts, until, through the fire closing in more and more, they
are so close as to touch one another. The kangaroos, which are
thus shut into that circle, burn their feet in jumping on every
side to get away, and are compelled to retire within the circle
until the fire attacks them. They then try to escape in various
directions, and the natives frightening them with their shouts
throw their spears at the one passing nearest to them. By this
means not one can escape. They roast the product of their chase,
without skinning nor even gutting the animals, and then divide it
among themselves, after having cut each animal into pieces.]</p>
<p>The cattle advanced several times, as if they were going to
attack us, and I had the greatest difficulty in making them leave
the place and allow my party to pass. I had even to send my men
to pursue them, uttering loud shouts.</p>
<p>This valley is intersected by many small ditches of about 30
ft. in length and 20 ft. in width. These ditches are filled
during the winter with a quantity of water, which is sufficient
for the needs of the cattle during part of the summer, and one
can see a large number of well beaten tracks which the cattle
have made for themselves in all directions, on the heights and in
the plain, to reach the hills, which seem to be their place of
rendezvous during flood time. I observed with interest near the
ditches, a kind of esplanade,*** of about 150 ft. in
circumference, entirely denuded of herbage and perfectly beaten
down and levelled. I passed through the esplanade to go to the
top of one of the hills, which form a barrier across the valley,
and which I was obliged to ascend with my team to continue my
journey. When I had succeeded in going over that ridge, I saw a
second herd of about 130 cattle, but they did not obstruct my
passage in any way.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** I think this esplanade must have been the
battle-field of the bulls, and what confirms me in that opinion
is that I saw a bull of a reddish colour, with white spots, lying
dead in the ditch, gored in several places. The marks of the
fight were evidenced by the trees around being denuded of their
bark, and by the traces remaining near the ditch where the bull
had sunk in the mud. I caused the horns of that bull to be taken
away, and I have kept them.]</p>
<p>At a short distance from that place I made my small troop
halt, and went alone to the top of a hill to reconnoitre the
surrounding country. After walking some 300 paces, on the summit
I saw another herd, which I judged was mainly composed of cows
with their calves. I was able to count 221 of them, but from the
spot where I was it was impossible for me to see them all, and I
could only surmise from the lowings, which I heard from various
distances, that the number of these cattle must have been very
considerable. I still heard the lowings after I had gone down to
rejoin my party, and for more than an hour whilst continuing my
journey.</p>
<p>At eleven in the morning I found myself near a ditch tilled
with water. I halted there, and gave orders to skin the kangaroo,
which was prepared for our dinner. The heat being excessive, I
allowed my men to rest until 4 o'clock. After having walked for a
little while, I perceived two natives seated under a bush, one of
whom seemed as if he were anxious to run away, while the other
one remained seated, and appeared to be trying to persuade the
former to stay.</p>
<p>Gogy, the native I had in my service, started running, and
went and sat with them, where he remained until we arrived. He
came and told me that one of these natives was a mountaineer
called Bungin, and the other knew the white men, and was called
Wooglemai.* I went to the mountaineer to examine a mantle with
which he was covered. This mantle was made of skins of various
animals sewed together. It was a very great curiosity, and as I
was desirous of obtaining it, I proposed to him to exchange it
for a new axe, but he would not part with it, and told me that
the nights were very cold and his mantle was his only covering. I
was compelled to abandon my proposal, and in order to attach to
me this mountaineer, who would be very useful to me in the
country I was in, I had the head of the kangaroo given to him to
appease his hunger, after which he came and proposed, as a token
of friendship, to exchange his old axe for the new one I had
offered him for his mantle. I filled him with joy by complying
with his request.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Wooglemai, in the natives language, signifies
"one-eyed". This native knew Gogy, as he used to go from time to
time to Parramatta and Prospect Hill. The mountaineer called
Bungin was an inhabitant of the South, and had left the
Canambaigle tribe because they wanted to kill him. He was the
brother of a famous chief who had accidentally killed himself in
falling from a tree. That chief was called Goonboole. He
inhabited the mountains near Jervis Bay, and was the terror of
the neighbourhood.]</p>
<p>I resumed my journey at half past five o'clock, and arrived
with my party and baggage on the border of a small creek, where I
decided to stay for the night.</p>
<p>Nearly the whole of the country from Binh&eacute;ny to
Carabeely being open towards the south, presents perspectives of
surprising beauty. The hills in the same direction, rising
insensibly the one above the other, confounding themselves with
the first ranges of mountains, offer to the sight a variety of
scenes of the most picturesque aspect. But I have seen only a few
spots where the soil could be adapted for cultivation, and they
were liable to be inundated by the overflowing of the rivers.</p>
<p>The place where I decided to spend the night was on the
territory of the mountaineer Bungin. He gave a proof of his
friendship and gratefulness for my good treatment by building** a
hut for me, and I was very thankful for his kind attention.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The natives do not allow any stranger to
inhabit the territories they have appropriated to themselves.
They themselves build huts for the strangers they wish to receive
as friends.]</p>
<p>I was then at about 2 miles from a chain of mountains, the
direction of which is westerly, inclining towards the south;
southerly there is a range of hills stretching in various
directions.</p>
<p>My team precluding me from ascending the heights, I was
obliged on that day to go round them in the following
directions:&mdash;S. 17&deg; 0', 2 miles; S. 70&deg; 0',
1&frac12; mile; S. 20&deg; 0', 5 miles; S. 70&deg; 0', 5 miles:
in all, 13 miles.</p>
<p>The thermometer marked: In the morning, 58&deg; 0'; at noon,
82&deg; 0'; in the evening, 74&deg; 0'; very hot northerly
wind.</p>
<p>On the 8th November I crossed the creek, the banks of which
are nearly perpendicular; but the bullocks succeeded in making a
wide passage, quite practicable for men on foot, but too steep
for a carriage to pass, and I was obliged to have the waggon
carried by hand to the other side. I walked until noon, when I
stopped near another creek in order to rest ourselves until 4
o'clock. A soup made of boiled rice, with pickled pork, composed
our repast, and I saw that the two natives had their share; but
whilst one of the newly arrived mountaineers would not partake of
this food, the other ate it with avidity. The former having
caught a lizard, roasted it, and devoured it.*** I tasted some of
it, and preferred it to the opossum.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Besides lizards and other animals, grubs are
eaten by the natives, and it is more particularly those which are
found in the trunks of trees they look for. For this purpose they
always carry with them a switch about 12 inches long and of the
thickness of a fowl's feather, which they stick into their hair
above the ear. One of the extremities of this stick is provided
with a hook. When they discover on the trunk of a tree the mark
of the hole made by some of these grubs, they make the hole
larger with their axe, and if they are certain that the grub is
there they dip their switch into the hole, and, by means of the
hook, draw it out, and eat it greedily. It is a delicacy of which
they never get tired.]</p>
<p>The ground travelled over during the morning consisted of
heights quite easy of access from the creek, whence I had
started.</p>
<p>I noticed that the trees are generally what is called
blue-gum, ironbark, stringybark, and yellow-gum. The soil is
mostly bad, and after having passed the heights at a distance of
about 2 miles from the larger creek, a vast plain is found, which
is full of kangaroos. The soil there is formed of white clay,
covered with iron ore, and is extremely bad.</p>
<p>I resumed my journey at 4, and at 6 o'clock crossed another
creek. After having travelled over a plain, I perceived fires in
several places, and Bungin told me that it was a chief called
Canambaigle with his tribe, who were hunting, and had on that
very day set the country on fire. He showed me the imprints of
various feet, both of males and females,* scattered here and
there.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The natives minutely examine the footprints on
the ground, and know by their number and differences what natives
have passed there.]</p>
<p>I continued advancing through a country full of rocks and
thickly bushed for about a mile, and, having reached a valley, I
resolved to camp there for the night, my troop and my team being
very tired.</p>
<p>As I remembered having stopped there on the occasion of my
first journey, I looked for the huts I had then built, and found
them in the same state in which I had left them.</p>
<p>I was then at about 4 miles from Nattai, which was the place
where I had decided to establish my dep&ocirc;t. The distances we
travelled and the directions followed from the large creek to the
one where I stopped at noon are&mdash;S. 14&deg; 0', 1&frac34;
mile; S. 62&deg; 30' E., 1&frac12; mile; S. 62&deg; 30' E., 1
mile; S. 66&deg; 0', 3&frac12; miles; S. 36&deg; 0', 3&frac12;
miles; S. 61&deg; 0', 1&frac34; mile From 4 o'clock to 7 at
night, 13 miles. S. 46&deg; 0', 2 miles; N. 61&deg; 0, 4&frac12;
miles. In all, 19&frac12; miles. The thermometer marked&mdash;In
the morning, 66&deg; 30'; at noon, 84&deg; 30'; in the evening,
71&deg; 0'. South-east wind, fine weather, but very warm.</p>
<p>On the 9th November, at 6 in the morning, when I was preparing
to start, Bungin, one of the mountaineer natives, told me
that he heard the voice of a native at some distance from us,
and, after having spoken to Gogy, they went together towards the
spot whence the sound of the voice had appeared to come. I heard
them repeat, several times, the word coo-ee, shouting with all
their strength; and a quarter of an hour after I had lost sight
of them they came back, bringing two other mountaineers with
them. One was called Bulgin and the other Wallarra. The latter
had never seen a white man, but the former had seen several
whilst kangaroo hunting.</p>
<p>Wallarra was seized with a great fright when I stepped forward
to shake hands with him, and I was obliged to withdraw and leave
him with the other natives, who tried to reassure hint and give
him confidence, telling him that I did not do them any harm, that
I had come to gather some pebbles and plants, and that I had the
animals skinned to preserve their fur.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** I had some boiled rice and sugar given to
them. Bulgin ate it with greediness, but Wallarra ate only the
sugar, which I had to put on top. It would be difficult to
describe his fright. He was standing with crossed arms and his
eyes riveted on the ground. I had a second handful of sugar given
to him, which he ate; but when I again went near him, his whole
frame began to tremble.]</p>
<p>The forenoon was already far advanced. I gave orders to yolk
the bullocks*** to the waggon, and to place in it my utensils for
my journey to Nattai, which I reached at 11 a.m., after having
gone over a very difficult country, all covered with stones and
bush, the soil of which is very arid. The trees are absolutely
identical to those I have mentioned above.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The sight of the bullocks being yolked to
the waggon was a new cause of fright to the new mountaineer, and
the other natives had a great deal of trouble in making him come
back. When the waggon was put in motion they followed all its
movements, making all sorts of grimaces, and speaking with a
great velocity expressive of their astonishment. I understood
that they were beginning to tame him, because Bulgin came to tell
me they were going to fetch their wives and two little children
they had left in the forest, and that they would come to join me
at Nattai as soon as they had found them.]</p>
<p>I told some of my people to cut some trees to make a hut large
enough for the whole of my party, and to procure a good supply of
water, as the nearest creek was almost 1 mile from us. Whilst my
orders were being carried out, and the other portion of my people
were preparing our dinner, I went to explore the neighbourhood,
and there gathered various plants.</p>
<p>After dinner I took two men with me and went down the creek,
which I followed until dusk, gathering flowers and fragments of a
rather peculiar sandstone. I returned to the dep&ocirc;t at
sunset, and about the same time Bulgin (one of the mountaineer
newcomers), with Bungin, arrived with their wives and two
children; but Wallarra,* the other mountaineer, was not with
them.</p>
<p class="foot">[* It was apparent that Wallarra's fright was not
over yet.]</p>
<p>Gogy told me that they had brought portions of a monkey (in
the native language "colo"),** but they had cut it in pieces, and
the head, which I should have liked to secure, had disappeared. I
could only get two feet through an exchange which Gogy made for
two spears and one tomahawk. I sent these two feet to the
Governor in a bottle of spirits.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Gogy told me that this portion of the colo
(or monkey) and several opossums had been their share in the
chase with Canambaigle, at which they were present on the day
when that part of the country which I referred to above had been
burnt. The newly arrived natives lighted a fire on the left-hand
side of the dep&ocirc;t. Gogy associated with them, but his wife,
who, with her child, was at some distance from that spot, did not
leave the place where she was. From there she watched with great
interest what was taking place between the natives and her
husband on the side opposite. The natives of this country are
inclined towards superstition and believe in the existence of an
evil spirit.]</p>
<p>Gogy had built for me a very large hut, made with the bark of
the trees, and had erected it just opposite the hut of my people.
I had some fire lighted in it and carried my effects there. After
having regulated the night service and placed the sentry at his
post, I prepared to spend the night in my hut. My men and the
natives retired to their respective quarters.</p>
<p>The course I had traversed this day was: N. 70&deg; 5' W. 4
miles. The thermometer marked: In the morning, 64&deg; 30'; at
noon, 84&deg; 0'; in the evening, 76&deg; 0'. Easterly wind until
11 a.m.; south-westerly, from 11 a.m. to the evening; sky
cloudy.</p>
<p>On the 10th November, I sent the waggon to fetch some
provisions. It was accompanied by three men, guided by the native
Wooglemai. I had some flour put in three haversacks with a
provision of rice, and I left with my troop, followed by the
native Gogy.</p>
<p>I steered my course towards the west, walking along a creek
which separates a chain of mountains and runs into a river.</p>
<p>I could not proceed very far in that direction without
descending a precipice, and I continued following the creek,
passing over big rocks fallen from the neighbouring mountains
into the ravine.</p>
<p>This ravine was covered with dry and slippery tree-leaves,
which made its passage, so full of obstacles, very dangerous, and
we were exposed to falling in deep holes full of water.</p>
<p>I noticed at the end of this creek a slate-mine. I found there
some fragments with the impressions of ferns and tree-leaves.
This slate is very soft, and breaks into pieces under the
slightest pressure. I found also there a very rich iron-mine.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the river,*** which had been the terminus of
my discoveries on the occasion of my first journey, I crossed it
with my men at a waterfall, and I went towards the north, keeping
on the western bank of that river. I travelled (always following
the same direction) over a flat and very easy country till 6
o'clock in the evening.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** This is the Nattai River, marked M on
Barrallier's chart.&mdash;ED.]</p>
<p>This river is teeming with fish of various species, and
especially with black bream, weighing from 4 lb. to 6 lb.
Univalve and bivalve shells are also found there. Several kinds
of bushes grow on its banks, and more particularly a tea-tree of
middle height, with flowers of a very pale pink colour.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the plants there are of the same kind as
those growing near Sydney. The foot of the mountains is within a
gunshot of either side of the river, and, as far as I could
judge, they are more than half a mile in height, and one could
only reach the summit of a very small number of them.</p>
<p>These mountains are generally accessible up to a certain
height, but at an altitude of a quarter of a mile they are
perpendicular, and their summit forms a kind of leaden wall. More
generally they overhang in the form of vaults, in the interior of
which one sees enormous rocks overhanging, and quite ready to
fall down at the slightest move, thus taking away from anyone's
mind the idea of seeking there for a shelter against the rain,
for fear of being crushed down by their downfall.</p>
<p>Up to the part where these mountains are accessible they are
covered with timber, and this is about at half their height. But
beyond that distance the ground is without consistency&mdash;it
is like a quicksand, in which one sinks. The large blocks of
stones fallen there detach themselves at the slightest effort,
and in rolling down uproot the brushes which they meet, and which
have no firm root in that kind of soil.</p>
<p>The base of these mountains is a composite of sandstone of
various colours, charged with ferruginous parts. The soil appears
good enough in such parts as are liable to inundation, but above
that height the soil is composed of whitish clay, very arid, and
is almost entirely covered with iron-ore up to where the soil
loses its consistency.</p>
<p>The trees are generally blue-gum, stringybark, &amp;c.</p>
<p>At about 4 p.m. I perceived on a hill three kangaroos, which
did not appear to be frightened; but they fled when I sent one of
my men to shoot them.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* I noticed that the red coats of my soldiers
put the kangaroos to flight as soon as they perceived them, and
we could only shoot one when I had made them take off their
coats.]</p>
<p>At 6 p.m. I arrived in a valley, where I found two ponds.**
This spot seemed to me convenient to rest at during the night. I
made Gogy cut a hut for me, and I had it placed on the slope of a
hill, whence I could enjoy a view of the ponds and of the noble
aspect of the mountains surrounding me on the east and
west.***</p>
<p class="foot">[** Bulgin, the mountaineer, told me that he had
stopped several days in this place, and that he had caught very
large eels in the ponds. Gogy having discovered a parrot's nest
in the trunk of a blue-gum, cut steps in the tree with his axe;
but when he reached the nest he found only some eggs, which he
offered to me. My refusal of them he regarded as an insult.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Half an hour before dusk I heard a noise
which I mistook for the lowing of several oxen, but I was
undeceived in learning it was the croak of frogs of a tremendous
size which were in the pond.]</p>
<p>The soil around this spot is more and more inferior. The trees
are the same as those mentioned before, with the addition of a
few mahogany.</p>
<p>The aspect of the mountains does not offer any accessible
point; their summits are nearly all full of cavities. The trees
growing there appear, at the distance from where I was, as if
they were small brushes 2 or 3 ft. in height.</p>
<p>My route to-day, after leaving the source of the creek leading
to the river, was&mdash;S. 75&deg; 0', 2&frac12; miles; whilst
following the same direction on the bank of the creek, S. 75&deg;
0', 7 miles; westerly, N. 2&frac14; miles; on the same bank, N.
56&deg; E. 3 miles; in all, 14&frac34; miles.</p>
<p>On the 11th November, I continued my journey in order to find
a passage between the mountains situated towards the west, and
for 3 miles of very trying walk I went over a large number of
hills sloping from the top of the mountains down to a river which
flows north-easterly in the middle of an extended plain, and into
which the first river runs.</p>
<p>The mountains on the left side of the river trend
south-westwardly, and the width of the plain, from the foot of
the mountains on the opposite range, is 2&frac12; miles. This
plain widens in proportion as one advances south-westwardly, the
two ranges inclining, the one towards the south, the other
towards the west. The bed of this new river is considerably wider
than that of the Hawkesbury River. During the summer it is partly
dry; but it has the disadvantage of not being navigable on
account of a number of waterfalls, which completely bar its bed.
It appears that, in the winter, the waters rise 10 or 12 feet
above the waterfalls, and carry away pieces of granite of various
colours and other stones. The water is teeming with different
species of fishes and shells, which are of the same kind as those
in the first river.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* I noticed that only a small portion of this
plain is subject to floods, and that the water runs into a swamp
of about 2 miles in length which is partly dry in the summer. It
is easy to detect all the parts subject to inundation by the
fragments of granite of all sorts which the currents have carried
down from the mountains to the inundated grounds.]</p>
<p>At one o'clock in the afternoon, I halted for dinner, and I
caused the grass to be burnt so as to have an easier walk. The
thick fog of the morning had entirely covered the mountains. It
disappeared in the afternoon, and we had fine weather until 3
o'clock, when we heard thundering in the distance which made me
think that the storm was not far from us. However, I continued my
journey until arriving at a small creek where I stopped to pass
the night.</p>
<p>My men had all the time necessary to prepare huts to shelter
us before the storm reached us. The thunder was falling with
terrible detonations which were echoed all round. Rain continued
till half-past 6 in the evening, and the wind having changed to
the east the fog soon attached itself to the tops of the
mountains and before dusk they were covered from base to
summit.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** I observed several trees slightly touched by
lightning, others completely felled or torn. The branches were
broken in thousands of small bits and spread all around to as
great a distance as 15 paces from these trees.]</p>
<p>The mountains are entirely composed of granite and appear
inaccessible. The plain seems to be very fertile.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The soil of this plain is of a surprising
fertility, light and dark in colour, and very deep. There, a kind
of grass with a yellow flower principally grows, the stem of
which attains a height of 5 feet. It is generally acknowledged
that this grass grows only on good land. The only trees found
there are the apple-trees. They are spread at a large distance
from one another, there being stretches of land of 2 or 3 acres
on which not one is seen. There are a great quantity of kangaroos
of different kinds in this plain which are not very shy. I think
it would be suitable for the establishment of about 300 men who
would devote themselves to the culture of the land. Such wild
animals as the warring, kangaroo, opossum, wombat, &amp;c., would
afford to these colonists a great variety of food, without
mentioning all the varieties of fish swarming in the rivers. But
it would be necessary to open a road of communication from Nattai
to the second river, so that waggons could reach there without
danger. This presents some difficulties, which, however, are not
insurmountable.]</p>
<p>My route was to-day: N 11&deg; 0', 1&frac12; mile; N. 32&deg;
0', 1&frac34; mile; S. 37&deg; 0', 4 miles; S. 35&deg; 0',
2&frac12; miles; S. 84&deg; 0' W. 3 miles; in all, 12&frac12;
miles.</p>
<p>The thermometer showed: In the morning, 65&deg; 0'; at noon,
74&deg; 0'; in the evening, 72&deg; 0'; southerly wind until
6&middot;30 p.m.; easterly into the night.</p>
<p>On the 12th November, a thick fog with rainfall continued till
10 a.m. This very disagreeable weather having cleared up a
little, I resumed my journey, passing through another chain of
isolated mountains which may be nearly 4 miles in length, and
sighting on the right the great range, the height of which is
more and more considerable. All the soil of the ground I went
over up to 1 o'clock in the afternoon appeared to be very rich.
The hills are covered with kangaroos which resemble a flock of
goats grazing peaceably, and offer to the eye a pleasing pastoral
picture. I sowed 4 pumpkin seeds, which I happened to have on me,
at the foot of the mountain, in a place denuded of bush, and also
the stone of an apricot. I afterwards continued my journey,
following the great range until I reached the bank of a creek,
where I found a fire, and I could distinguish on the ground the
footprints of a native and that of a child, who had but just left
the place.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* I found a spear made of reed, which the little
one had apparently left there, and with which the children are
trained in the use of this weapon. There was some gum at one of
its extremities in order to make that part heavier.]</p>
<p>My attention was attracted by a mountain, which, although very
high, appeared to me rather easy of access. I resolved to ascend
it with my men, convinced that from its summit I would be able to
make a survey of the country around, which would enable me to
form a judgment as to the direction in which I should have to
go.</p>
<p>I climbed that mountain easily enough for the first half-hour,
allured by the singing of the pheasants, which I heard on all
sides. Having reached a little over half the height, I met with a
soil without consistency, like fine sand, interspersed with large
and very sharp-edged stones, which made our march very
disagreeable. These stones gave way under our feet and rolled
down with a terrific noise.</p>
<p>I was obliged, with my men, to open a narrow path, following,
in single file, this passage among the stones and bushes, and
sinking up to the knee in the sand, at the risk of having our
legs broken by the stones, which were rolling, and which it was
necessary to avoid by taking great precautions and stepping aside
when we saw them come.</p>
<p>By this means I succeeded in ascending three-quarters of the
height, where immense overhanging rocks, which seemed to be
attached to nothing, offered an appalling scene. Enormous masses,
on which we tried to hold ourselves in order to be able to pass,
offered so little resistance that the slightest effort detached
them, and some tumbled down under the pressure of our feet, when
we found some large trees within our reach to hang on to. These
masses in rolling down to the base carried away with them other
rocks of various sizes with a thundering noise.</p>
<p>When I happened to reach some large trees, generally blue-gum,
I made my men rest, and during these stoppages I glanced at the
plain from that great height with a feeling of admiration mingled
with awe.</p>
<p>I continued to advance in that dangerous situation for
half-an-hour, using my hands as well as my feet, which were
bleeding. My aim was to reach the summit of the mountain, and I
had deviated by only 100 paces from my course. But I was
literally stopped by a barrier of rocks which projected outwards
in the shape of vaults, and which were pierced by various
cavities, serving as a shelter to wild dogs and other wild
animals. I persisted, however, in my attempt to find a passage to
reach the summit.</p>
<p>I sent a native with a soldier to go round this barrier
towards the east. I soon heard the report of a gun (they were
scarcely 100 yards distant from me), and I saw them come back
with a warring** which the soldier had killed. Another soldier I
had sent reconnoitring on the other side not having succeeded in
discovering the desired passage, I determined to descend by the
western slope of the mountain, the height of which, although
elevated, had not an inaccessible appearance, and this made me
hopeful of being able to advance about 30 miles without
obstacles. Within a short time I arrived at the base of this
mountain without other accident than the wounds my legs had
received, which, however, did not prevent me from pursuing, for
more than a quarter of an hour, some pheasants I could hear; but
they were so shy that, at the slightest noise, they flew to the
trees where they perched. They run on the ground with such
rapidity that one loses sight of them in the twinkling of the
eye.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Sir Joseph Banks is possessed of the only
skin of this species of animal ever brought over to England. The
warring is a kangaroo of a smaller species than the ordinary
kangaroo. It possesses the same characteristics, and its only
habitat is the mountains. It is of a dark brown red colour, with
small stripes on the head. I remained seated for a quarter of an
hour upon this height at the foot of a tree, and from this
position I discovered several creeks which ran into the river,
crossing the plain in all directions. The whole country seemed to
me absolutely flat.]</p>
<p>When I arrived at the top of one of the hills which form the
base of the mountain, Bungin, the mountaineer, saw a fire, and
made a sign to me not to make any noise, and he stepped to the
place where the fire was. Round it were seated some natives, who
rose and put themselves on the defensive with their spears as
soon as they perceived Bungin.*** He made another sign, inviting
me to come with my troop, and began speaking, telling them not to
be frightened; that he had come with Gogy to accompany us, and
that we were travelling without any intention of doing them any
harm. He told them to sit down again, which they did, after
having questioned him and having observed us attentively. I had a
fire lighted at once on the spot I had chosen for the present. I
had my party seated, and whilst some soldiers were skinning the
warring, I made Bulgin ask the natives the nearest place where
water could be obtained. One of them rose instantly, and pointed
with his hand to a place which contained some.**** Gogy, the
native in my service, went near the mountaineers in nearly the
same manner as Bungin, and held my gun in his hands to show them
that he could make use of our arms; but nobody paid any attention
to him except Wallarra, who was there, and knew him. He called
him, and made him sit by his side. He was the only one who spoke
to him. The others from time to time threw terrible glances at
him, biting their lips, which did not augur very well for him,
and made him aware of the danger he was running among them. He
came back to me very angry, and told me that the chief of that
tribe was called Goondel, and that one of them called Mootik was
the only one who could give me any information about the new
settlement which, he had heard, was on the other side of the
mountains. Wallarra had told him to apply to that native, but,
when asked, the latter did not answer the questions put to him on
that subject, although Wallarra had told him that it was by my
orders he questioned him, because it was my intention to examine
this new settlement when I knew its location and the number of
days required to reach it. Mootik had got up, looking at him with
terrible eyes and biting his lips, and had gone to the place
where the water was. When he had come back he seated himself near
Goondel, spoke in his ear, and took an opossum which he had
distributed among those present for their dinner, but offered
none to him (Gogy), an omission he considered as the greatest
insult.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The natives of this part of the country make
use of a weapon which is not employed by, and is even unknown to,
the natives of Sydney. It is composed of a piece of wood, in the
form of a half circle, which they make as sharp as a sabre on
both edges, and pointed at, each end. They throw it on the ground
or in the air, making it revolve on itself, and with such a
velocity that one cannot see it returning towards the ground;
only the whizzing of it is heard. When they throw it along the
ground it is exactly like a cannon-ball knocking down everything
on its passage.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** The manner in which the mountaineers
receive the strangers is exactly the same as at Sydney,
Parramatta, and Hawkesbury. They have the same customs, the same
way of living; their food consists of different species of
kangaroos, opossums, squirrels, wild dogs, river and swamp fish
and shells, lizard eggs (which they find in the sand on the banks
of the rivers at a depth of 1 foot), large ant eggs, colo, or
monkey (a species of opossum different from the others), wombat,
serpents, lizards with red bellies, and other species, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. Goondel's troop was well provided with opossums. They had
also a wild dog, which they roasted in a hole after the style of
the Hunter River natives. They appeared to be good hunters, and
had five hounds with them.]</p>
<p>He also told me that this chief had promised his daughter to
Bungin, in order to retain him in his tribe; that the girl was
called Wheengeewhungee, was very young, and that Bungin had
accepted the offer, and had asked him to intimate to me that he
would not follow me any farther.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Whilst the preparations for the dinner were
proceeding, a mountaineer belonging to Goondel's tribe, having
seen a kangaroo take refuge in a bush near the water, hunted him,
and, having made it turn on the side where the dogs were, would
certainly have caught it; but the animal having passed near us,
the dog which was after him let go his prey, not daring to pass
near us.]</p>
<p>While I was talking to Gogy our dinner had been prepared. I
gave him his share, but he absolutely refused to touch it. He had
his eyes constantly fixed on the place where the natives were,
and did not miss one of their movements. Having asked him what
prevented him from eating, and what made him look so sad, he
answered that if I had any consideration for him I would go back.
He was certain, he said, that if I spent the night on this spot,
Goondel and his party would kill him.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** The weapons of these natives, with the
exception of the one mentioned previously, are of the same kind
as those of the natives of Sydney. Their spears and clubs are
similar; they all possess a small axe of English make, with which
they catch various animals necessary to their subsistence. They
wear a belt they make with opossum hair, plaited as thick as a
pen-holder. It is composed of several of these plaits, and is
about 10 or 12 feet in length. They wear it very tight above the
hips. It is used to hang their various instruments on, such as
the axe, whamharha, whady, &amp;c.]</p>
<p>I could not succeed in reassuring him, even by telling him
that I would go a few miles farther to look for a suitable place
to spend the night; that, besides, he had nothing to fear,
certain as he was of my assistance and that of my troop; and that
after this day I intended returning to the dep&ocirc;t by another
route to avoid meeting Goondel and his tribe. I expressed to him
my surprise at seeing him possessed of so little courage, for he
knew I had a sentry on watch during the night. All this failed to
restore his confidence; but as he was absolutely necessary to me
in making the huts for myself, my people, and the provisions at
night, I could not let him leave without inconvenience. I,
therefore, decided to go, and having had everything put in order,
and everyone having taken his arms and utensils, I called Bungin,
who at once came to me. He talked with Gogy for some time, and
the latter told me that Bungin asked my permission to stop for
this day with Goondel who was giving him his daughter, but that
he would join me on the morrow before breakfast time.* Having no
reason to keep him back, I granted his request, hoping to get rid
altogether of a mouth quite useless to me, and I made my people
take the route to the dep&ocirc;t.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The natives here paint their face, arms, and
thighs in the same way as those of Sydney, and they wear the same
ornaments, with the addition of one composed of a part of the
female kangaroo. The only difference consists in their mantles,
which they make with the skins of various animals sewed together
with sinews from the tail of the kangaroo; but before sewing them
they form various squares on the inside of the skin with the edgy
part of a bivalve shell, which process makes the skin softer and
easier to handle. When they have killed a kangaroo they always
preserve the two middle teeth of the upper jaw, which are very
long and of a beautiful and pure white when well cleaned. When
they have a dozen they make a necklace of them, which is one of
the principal ornaments of the women. They wear it on their
forehead. They have another kind of necklace made of small reeds,
and which they wear on their neck. This necklace goes seven or
eight times round the neck, and they let a piece of at least 6
inches hang in the middle of their back. When they have only
three or four teeth, and are not able to make a necklace, they
stick them in their hair with gum, taking care that they come on
the forehead or on the ears. Sometimes the men also adorn
themselves with these necklaces, but they are contented with the
reed ones, and stick the kangaroo teeth in their hair with gum.
They, as well as some of the women, usually wear on their
forehead a band of an oval shape, and red tinted, made as a net
with opossum hair.]</p>
<p>Gogy was not long in perceiving that Mootik and one of the
other mountaineers were following us at less than 200 paces
behind, and that they stopped every time we stopped. He noticed
that they were well armed, and that they each had a spear fixed
to the whamharha, which they usually employ to throw their spear
with greater force when opportunity offers. I gave the order to
proceed without seeming to take any notice of the natives. Gogy
alone observed all their movements. He stopped when they were
shouting, and told me that they were calling the others to help
them. He looked as if he had lost his reason. My soldiers
sometimes called him "gevenet", which in the native language
signifies coward, and he used then to get out of temper.</p>
<p>After following us in that manner for more than one hour the
two natives stopped, and, after looking at us for some time, they
retraced their steps. Gogy was the first to notice it, and made
me aware of it with an expression of joy.</p>
<p>I arrived at the very place where I had slept the night
before. I shot four wild ducks I found in the river, and after
having taken our effects out of the waggon I disposed myself to
pass the night there. The sun had then disappeared behind the
horizon.</p>
<p>My route to-day, until we met the natives, was: N. 39&deg; 0'
W. 1 mile; N. 70&deg; 0' W. 1 mile; S. 47&deg; 0' W. 6&frac34;
miles; N. 86&deg; 0' W. 1 mile; in all, 9&frac34; miles.</p>
<p>I followed the same route in returning to the river where I
slept the night before. The thermometer marked: In the morning,
69&deg;; at noon, 76&deg;; in the evening, 72&deg;;
north-easterly wind; foggy until 12 noon.</p>
<p>On the 13th November I continued my route to the dep&ocirc;t,
following the river in search of wild ducks.</p>
<p>On arriving at the junction of the two rivers I heard the
voice of a native who was calling, and having stopped my troop, I
saw, a few minutes after, Bungin who was coming to me with a
young native who had paid us a visit the evening before. Bungin
told me that the girl whom the chief had promised to him had
taken to the woods, and they had not been able to find her,
although they had looked for her during the whole of the
afternoon on the 12th, and seeing that she could not be found he
had left the natives, in order to rejoin me, after having
exchanged his spears and whamharha** for a few ornaments he had
received from the natives. He had taken the young fellow with him
because, as he had neither father nor mother, he was not able to
subsist without being helped. He added that he had followed my
footsteps until dusk, stopping near the river, having only one
opossum to share with his companion who was crying very much over
the fatigue he had experienced, and that, having seen our fire
during the night, he had left early in the morning to try to
overtake us before breakfast.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The whamharha is a small stick used by the
natives as a lever in order to throw their spears to a greater
distance and with more force.]</p>
<p>I had some food given to Bungin and the young native. They
appeared as if they were in great need of it. I learnt that
Goondel and his tribe proposed to go up the river to-day to try
and find his bride. He told me also that he knew a shorter way to
go back to the dep&ocirc;t, in ascending a mountain and passing
several high hills which were on the other side of the river, by
which means we should reach the dep&ocirc;t before sunset.</p>
<p>I therefore determined to march the whole of the day under the
guidance of Bungin. I passed the first river and followed its
banks till I came to a rather large creek which falls from one of
the ravines in the mountain. He made me understand that this was
the place where we had to prepare to ascend this mountain. It
appeared to me so steep, nearly perpendicular, that my courage
failed me when thinking of undertaking its ascension. I made my
troop take a rest on the bank of the creek, and after a frugal
repast I started climbing up. Bungin was by my side and supported
me every time I slipped or when the stones to which I was holding
gave way. (This climbing was one of the most trying I ever
attempted). In this manner, and after having tried the patience
of my men, I arrived at about twelve fathoms from the summit,
exhausted with fatigue, and without the slightest hope of
reaching it. The rocks with which it was formed being
perpendicular, all attempt to go further seemed to be futile.</p>
<p>Bungin assured me he had once passed there with several
mountaineers to go to Nattai, and that he was sure we would pass.
I sent him to try to discover a passage towards the south; he
came back a little while after without having succeeded. He
reiterated to me that he was certain he had passed on this very
mountain before. Having made the young native get up, he told me
to follow him towards the north, while Gogy and my escort would
go south, where he had been himself without success.</p>
<p>He made me go round the mountain, passing over precipices of a
frightful depth, and led me to an opening into the rock, through
which he made me pass, crawling on my stomach, and in an instant
I found myself on the summit without much difficulty.</p>
<p>Our party, not having been able to find a place which they
could climb, were obliged to retrace their steps, and not seeing
us any longer they came to the conclusion that we had found a
passage at the north. They followed our traces and arrived very
tired at the opening leading to us.</p>
<p>I continued to march in the direction S. 59&deg; E., and after
having descended several hills and another range of mountains, we
arrived at the creek where my men from the dep&ocirc;t had just
come to take their provision of water. It was quite dark, but as
I had only 1&frac12; mile more to walk, I decided not to stop
before arriving at the dep&ocirc;t, although I was exceedingly
tired.</p>
<p>On arriving at the dep&ocirc;t I found there a kangaroo
weighing 80 lb., which my men had killed, and they hastened to
make some soup for us with the tail and the head of the animal,
which comforted us and made us forget our fatigue for a
while.</p>
<p>There had been very heavy rain at Nattai on the 11th and 12th,
whilst we had some on our way on the 11th only.</p>
<p>I learnt that Bulgin, one of the natives I left at the
dep&ocirc;t with his two wives, had disappeared on the day after
my departure. On that day he had gone hunting with some men from
the dep&ocirc;t and the young native who had come with Wooglemai.
He had told his wives to leave some short time after him, pretend
to look after ant nests, and then to make for the woods. Bulgin,
having given some pretext to remain in the rear, the soldier had
seen him run out of his reach, and a short time afterwards having
seen the young native run away with his coat, had fired a shot
over his head. It frightened him so much that he let himself drop
on the ground, believing he was mortally wounded, and gave time
for the soldier to catch him and take him back to the
dep&ocirc;t.</p>
<p>In following the new route across the mountain I had shortened
the distance by about 6 miles. The direction of this route is S.
69&deg; E. The thermometer marked:&mdash;In the morning, 61&deg;
30'; at noon, 75&deg; 0'; in the evening, 65&deg; 0'; southerly
wind; sky cloudy.</p>
<p>On the 14th November, being obliged to wait at the dep&ocirc;t
for the return of the waggon, I made arrangements so as to let my
men have a rest, to make them recover from their fatigue,
intending to send some of them kangaroo hunting on the
morrow.</p>
<p>An unforeseen incident soon troubled our tranquillity, and
gave rise to a very disagreeable quarrel. I had given to Gogy's
child a few morsels of kangaroo left from my breakfast which he
had taken to his mother's hut to eat. Unfortunately, this woman
started eating a portion of this meat which she took from the
child, who complained to his father, shouting and crying.*** The
father having ordered his wife to let him alone, she could not
resist taking some more pieces of the meat, which caused the
child to renew his cries.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The natives are extremely indulgent to their
offspring. Everything they may desire is granted at once to
them&mdash;even the spears, and the mothers' necklaces, &amp;c. I
noticed that little Gogy used to take a sharp-pointed spear his
father had made for him and thrust it in his mother's thighs more
than one inch deep. The latter after having cried for some time
then dressed her wounds, looked at her child in laughing, and
told me her son would be a great warrior. He used to do the same
thing to his father, and struck heavy blows with his club on his
shoulders, taking all the attitudes of a combatant. The father,
to encourage him, pretended to be vanquished, and asked for his
mercy. The little one then, with an insulting air, told him to
get up, and after having thrown two or three spears at him they
made friends again.]</p>
<p>Gogy then took his club and struck his wife's head such a blow
that she fell to the ground unconscious. My people having tried
to appease him, he went out of the hut, dropped his club, and
started abusing his wife, pacing in front of the hut. He soon
started again with a four-pointed spear, which is used by the
natives for fishing purposes, and thrust it several times in her
thighs and several other parts of her body. He then ran to the
pile of arms, and taking hold of a musket, aimed at his wife and
would have shot her had not my men at once taken the musket out
of his hands, telling him that he had no right to take arms which
did not belong to him. This appeared to vex him very much. He
then laid down near Bungin, who seemed to remonstrate with him
and try to make him keep quiet.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Cruelty and laziness are two prominent
characteristics of the natives. During their marches the women
are obliged to carry the children, and have in addition a net in
the form of a sack hanging on their back in which they have to
carry opossums, and all tools necessary to their husbands, such
as kangaroo bones, which they use as chisels; bivalve shells,
which they employ for sharpening the point of their spears; and
other utensils, as well as lines of various descriptions, gum,
&amp;c. They are in everything their husbands' beasts of burden.
Should his wife not obey his first command the husband strikes
her on the head with his club as a warning, and continues his
route as if nothing out of the way had taken place. If his wife
attempts to resist his orders he breaks her arm with blows from
his club, thrusts spears in her thighs and other parts of the
body, and thus compels her to obey. They have a strong
inclination to steal one another's wives when opportunity offers,
and they then change country in order to escape being pursued.
When the wife of one of their enemies falls into their hands they
drag her by force in the bush, holding her by the arms; and when
she is covered with blood through the pricking of the brushes and
nearly dying, they, whatever number there might be, commit all
sorts of violence and brutalities upon her, after which the first
one takes her for his wife; then the remainder of the troop is
obliged to respect her as such, and she has to follow her new
husband and obey him.]</p>
<p>After dinner, seeing that nobody was taking any notice of him,
he got infuriated again, and again struck his wife on the head
with his club, and he left her on the ground nearly dying, before
Bungin, who was seated, could come to her assistance. He got up
at once and succeeded in making her regain consciousness by
throwing some water on her face. He afterwards sucked the wound
she had on her head, bandaged it tightly with a handkerchief she
happened to have, and made her lie down near the fire.</p>
<p>While Bungin was nursing this woman, Gogy was walking up and
down in a great fury. Nobody dared to speak to him for fear he
should again ill-treat his wife, who was in a pitiable state. At
last he came to me and said he was almost certain one of my
people had seduced his wife, and that he had determined to kill
her if she did not tell him who it was that seduced her. I
represented to him that the thing was impossible; that it was
only the state of anger in which he was that made him believe
things which did not exist; and that should he kill this poor
woman his child would have no one to suckle him. But it was all
in vain. He told me that he had determined to give his child to
some people at Parramatta when he had killed the mother, and
going back to his wife, mad with anger, he struck her a terrible
blow on her shoulders, asking her to give him at once the name of
her seducer; that should she persist in withholding that name
from him, he would kill her on the spot. He intimidated her so
much by his threats that she named Witthington, one of my
soldiers, assuring him that she had never responded to his
advances.</p>
<p>Gogy sat by his fire without uttering a word. He mended his
spears, sharpening them again, biting his lips all the time. This
disagreeable day was spent in this manner until dusk, when
fearing lest Gogy should commit some act of violence, I had a
sentry told off to follow all his movements, and in the case of
his perpetrating any excess, to fire upon him if there were no
other means of restraining him.</p>
<p>Gogy carried his cruelty so far as not to allow his wife to
pass the night in his hut; he would not even light her fire, and
she was obliged to lay in this pitiable state in the open air
until daybreak.</p>
<p>Everything continued quiet during the night, and I had to
satisfy the questions of the natives about the sentry (whom they
never had seen before outside the hut at night) by telling them
that it was to protect them against evil spirits. They performed
in trembling their customary ceremonies, and went back to their
hut.</p>
<p>The thermometer marked to-day:&mdash;In the morning, 62&deg;
0'; at noon, 67&deg; 0'; in the evening, 64&deg; 30'; rain fell
part of the evening; southerly wind.</p>
<p>15th November.&mdash;Bungin dressed the unfortunate woman's
wounds. She had an inflammation where she had been wounded by the
spear. He bandaged her thigh very tightly a little above the
wounds to prevent the inflammation spreading up. He made for that
purpose a bandage with the bark of a small tree. He then examined
the wound in the head, cleaned it with much patience and
dexterity, washed it with cold water, and replaced the
handkerchief as it was before. I witnessed this operation, and
its effect on this unfortunate woman was very marked, for she was
soon able to eat some rice and sugar I had given her.</p>
<p>I had decided to send some of my men kangaroo hunting with the
natives, when Bungin came and told me that he was going with the
child he had brought with him from Goondel to look for Bulgin,
who had taken away the new axe I had given him, and after his
departure I sent two men with the young native whom Bungin had
left, and who was obliged to stay with us against his will. He
knew the country, and I was certain he would take my men to the
places frequented by kangaroos. I was not deceived in my
expectation. At about 2 o'clock I saw them coming back with a
superb male weighing 100 lb. This was a good addition to our
provisions.</p>
<p>This day was very disagreeable, a thin rain falling
continuously. The thermometer showed:&mdash;In the morning,
62&deg; 30'; at noon, 67&deg; 0'; in the evening, 64&deg; 0';
very cold; southerly wind.</p>
<p>On the 16th November, I sent two of my men hunting, and I told
Gogy to go with them, but I could not induce him to leave his
hut. He looked sorry for having ill-treated his wife, and was
trying to make peace with her.</p>
<p>I myself left with two soldiers to reconnoitre the environs of
the dep&ocirc;t. I gathered a quantity of plants and I killed a
small and very pretty bird; the head, the neck, and part of its
body were red.</p>
<p>When arriving at the dep&ocirc;t I found the young native
quarrelling with one of my men, who accused him of trying to
steal the waistcoat of one of his comrades, and abandon him in
the woods, where he certainly would have lost his way.</p>
<p>I forbade my men molesting him in future, and they were
reconciled.</p>
<p>The hunters I had sent out in the morning came back at night
without having met with any success. The thermometer
showed&mdash;In the morning, 63&deg; 0'; at noon, 67&deg; 0'; in
the evening, 65&deg; 0'; southerly wind; the rain continued all
day.</p>
<p>On the 17th November, I had the huts repaired where the rain
found its way through; everybody worked at it so as to have it
finished quickly. Afterwards I had our arms cleaned, and the
whole day was spent in doing those two things. Gogy asked me to
allow his wife to go away in the waggon when it came back, which
I promised, for I greatly desired to get rid of him, as he had
become useless to me since he had ill-treated his wife.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* He was now very affectionate to her. He would
not go out of the hut under any pretence, not even to fetch the
water he wanted. His anger had all gone, but he appeared to be
jealous of his wife.]</p>
<p>This was a rainy day up to sunset. The thermometer
marked&mdash;In the morning, 60&deg; 30'; at noon, 77&deg; 0'; in
the evening, 71&deg; 0'; southerly wind from morning to sunset;
then the wind changed to N.W., and we had a fine night.</p>
<p>On the 18th November we had a fine morning, but the wind
having changed from N.W. to S., the sky became cloudy, and the
breeze having abated the heat was excessive from 12 at noon to
half-past 2 in the afternoon, when the storm began with a violent
squall, accompanied by thunder and hail, the stones of which were
as large as a musket bullet. This storm lasted only for a quarter
of an hour, but the rain fell during the whole day.</p>
<p>The thermometer marked&mdash;In the morning, 64&deg; 0'; at
noon, 83&deg; 0'; in the evening, 68&deg; 0'; western wind until
11 a.m.; then changed to south, and remained so the rest of the
evening and whole of the night with heavy rain.</p>
<p>On the 19th November the rain abated a little about 9 o'clock
in the morning, and my two hunters came back with a kangaroo
weighing about 60 lb., which they had met returning to the
dep&ocirc;t.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** They had been obliged to take refuge in a
hollow tree to shelter themselves from the storm and rain, and
they had passed there a very bad night, dazzled by the lightning
and harassed by the storm.]</p>
<p>At 1 o'clock in the afternoon the waggon came back with one
month's provisions. The drovers told me they had met on that day
a great number of natives, whom they could only get rid of by
dividing among them a kangaroo they had killed. One of them had
wounded a black cockatoo, having the head and tail of a yellow
colour, with black spots.</p>
<p>The sight of the effects brought by the waggon rejoiced all
the members of my party, and I had a small glass of rum given to
each of them to brighten up their spirits.</p>
<p>Wooglemai had followed the waggon and had with him a young
man, whom he called Badbury. They were well received by Gogy and
his wife.</p>
<p>The thermometer marked&mdash;In the morning, 58&deg; 0'; at
noon, 65&deg; 30'; in the evening, 59&deg; 0'; southern wind up
to 2 o'clock in the afternoon, when it changed to N.E. till 5
o'clock, and having changed again to south, we had rain the whole
of the night.</p>
<p>On the 20th November I commenced my preparations for making an
excursion towards the south. Rain continued falling till 9 a.m.,
but the weather looked as if it were going to clear up, the wind
having changed to north; but as it varied to N.W., I could not
carry out my project on that day.</p>
<p>A little before dusk, Gogy came and asked my permission to
accompany his wife when the waggon left. I pretended to feel
inclined to refuse acceding to his request, in order that he
should be grateful for my granting it later on. He insisted very
much on the necessity of his accompanying his wife and taking her
to his father, saying that he could not trust anybody to do it.
As I wanted to get rid of him I told him he could go, and it
pleased him very much.</p>
<p>I sent for Wooglemai to ask him to accompany me to the
mountains, but he appeared so much frightened with my proposal
that I did not insist upon it.</p>
<p>The thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 57&deg; 0'; at noon,
78&deg; 0'; in the evening, 68&deg; 0'; southerly wind till
7&middot;30 a.m., thence northwesterly till the next day; rain
continually falling.</p>
<p>On the 21st November, the rain having stopped at noon, I sent
the waggon back with two men, guided by Wooglemai and Gogy. I had
the woman and child placed in the waggon, and gave Gogy an axe
when he came to say good-bye to me. He seemed as if he regretted
leaving me. I had some sugar given to his wife, who, by this
time, had nearly recovered.</p>
<p>I retained Badbury and the young native,*** who had desired
stopping with me. I chose five of the strongest men in my troop
to accompany me on the new journey I was going to take, and I
gave orders for everything to be in readiness to set out on the
following day, and for everyone to take with him the quantity of
provisions and ammunition he could carry without, however,
overloading himself. I had a glass of rum given to each of my men
to cheer them, and the preparations were completed before
dusk.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** I named this young native <i>Le
Tonsur&eacute;</i>, because he had lost some of his hair in
falling headlong from his mother's arms into a fire. The skin of
his head had been burnt, and the hair had not grown again on that
part, which resembled a monk's tonsure. He only suffered from
this in rainy weather, when the rain fell on his head, and he
then covered it with some bark.]</p>
<p>The thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 69&deg; 0'; at noon,
72&deg; 0'; in the evening, 67&deg; 0'; strong north-westerly
wind with rain till noon; the remainder of the day was calm, with
a little rain; night stormy, with plenty of rain.</p>
<p>On the 22nd November, everything was absolutely ready by 8 in
the morning. Badbury and the young native having had a talk
together, told me they were ready to follow me, and asked me for
how many nights I intended to stay in the mountains. I told them
I could not exactly say, but I would come back when we ran short
of provisions.</p>
<p>I had a haversack of flour given to each of them, and after
giving them an axe, I left with my men, taking the same way in
the gorge (S. 75&deg; W.) which I had taken on the 10th.* I
continued my route in that manner, arriving without meeting any
obstacle at the first river, where I heard the voices of some
natives, and I saw the left side of the creek from where we came
all in flames, without, however, being able to detect anybody
around. I crossed the river and made my troop halt to rest and
prepare our dinner.* After dinner I resumed my journey and
reached my old huts early in the afternoon. I found them to be in
a good state, which was a good omen. They had, however, been
visited during the day by some natives, probably those whose
voices I had heard. On arriving there I shot a pigeon of the same
species as those near Sydney.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Note[s] missing.]</p>
<p>In the evening I heard a woman's voice. I gave the order not
to make any noise, in order to see whether she would come to our
fire. But the voice became more and more inaudible, and I
surmised that she had discovered we were strangers by the size of
our fire, and had gone away.</p>
<p>The whole day was very warm, and from noon to 3 o'clock in the
afternoon the heat was so suffocating that no one could stand it.
The frequent bathing in the river which I compelled my men to
take benefited them very greatly.</p>
<p>The thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 64&deg; 0'; at noon,
76&deg; 0'; in the evening, 82&deg; 30'; at sunset, 71&deg; 0';
southerly wind, but hardly any breeze could be felt.</p>
<p>On the 23rd November I pursued the same route which I had
taken while on my previous journey. My young natives followed
without grumbling. They were accustomed to carry the haversack,
the weight of which was diminishing in proportion as the
provisions were being consumed. On arriving at the junction of
the two rivers I perceived a fire on the opposite side, near the
large river, and three natives seated under a tree with two women
and some children, who rose at once on seeing my troop, and who
closely watched us.</p>
<p>My two young natives said we ought to stop for a while,
because we could not go on without speaking to those natives,
and, dropping their haversacks, they went to them. A short time
afterwards they returned and told me they had learnt that
Goondel, Mootik, and Wallarra had come to receive them.</p>
<p>A little while after we saw these three natives cross the
river on a waterfall in front of us, and they sat under the shade
of a she-oak.</p>
<p>Wallarra came last with a stick alight in his hand and a piece
of kangaroo. After their fire had been lighted my two young
natives went to them, and they were received without
ceremony.</p>
<p>**Mootik gave them a leg of kangaroo, well dried by fire, and
Wallarra a rib of the same animal boned and properly dried.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The dogs of the natives were frightened by
the red coats of the soldiers and ran to the woods. The women
called them, but they could not succeed in making them come back
so long as we were within sight.]</p>
<p>I had gone to the bank of the river to try to shoot some wild
ducks, and when coming back the two young natives told me that
Goondel, seeing I had no intention of doing any harm to them, was
contemplating paying me a visit with his party, and I felt rather
pleased about it. This was a proof of his confidence in me, which
I decided to augment by presenting him with a new axe, hoping to
get from him some particulars which would be of use to me while
progressing into the interior. In consequence I had the dinner
prepared to receive them; but in vain did I wait till 4 p.m. for
them, and I had then to leave this place to reach my next
quarters which were still far distant. Besides, we were
threatened with a storm.</p>
<p>The heat of the day was excessive, and I made my men bathe in
the river to refresh themselves.</p>
<p>I arrived at my old quarters at 8 p.m. Fortunately the storm
had cleared up, for I found my huts were in a very bad state.
They were situated on the border of a large creek.</p>
<p>The thermometer:&mdash;In the morning, 66&deg; 0'; in the
shade, at noon, 82&deg; 0', at 2 p.m., 84&deg; 0': in the sun, at
2 p.m., 126&deg; 0'; in the shade, at 3 p.m., 87&deg; 0'; in the
evening 74&deg; 30'.</p>
<p>Southerly wind up to 5 p.m., when it veered to south-west,
with indications of storm.</p>
<p>On the 24th November I followed the range of isolated
mountains, where I saw several kangaroos. This country is covered
with meadows and small hills, where trees grow a great distance
apart.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** They generally are apple-trees and
blue-gum.]</p>
<p>Having passed at noon the mountain I had tried on the occasion
of my first journey, I went into a country full of brushes, going
over hills which stood in all directions. Whilst advancing the
soil appeared to me worse and worse, and near 2 o'clock I came
across a soil composed of hard whitish clay, full of iron
ore.</p>
<p>When I had succeeded in climbing to a considerable height, I
saw that the mountains on the right dipped north-westwardly, and
this filled me with the hope of being able to find a passage. I
descended this hill towards a small creek, the soft murmur of
which invited me to make my troop repose there.</p>
<p>My provisions were reduced to a small quantity of flour and
some pickled pork, which would hardly be sufficient for our
meals. Chance, however, favoured us in supplying us here with a
good meal, one of my soldiers having shot an eel weighing 12 lb.,
which he had found in the creek.</p>
<p>It was about 3 o'clock when I resumed my journey, following
various directions to avoid the obstacles, and at 4 o'clock I
arrived on the top of a hill where I discovered that the
direction of the chain of mountains extended itself
north-westwardly to a distance which I estimated to be about 30
miles, and which turned abruptly at right angles. It formed a
barrier nearly north and south, which it was necessary to climb
over.</p>
<p>At 7 o'clock I arrived on the summit of another hill, from
where I noticed three openings: the first on the right towards N.
59&deg; 30' W.; the one in front of me, and which appeared very
large, was west from me; and the third, S. 35&deg; 0' W.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Note missing.]</p>
<p>This discovery gave me a great deal of hope, and the whole of
my party appeared quite pleased, thinking we had surmounted all
difficulties, and that we were going to enter a plain, the
apparent immensity of which gave every promise of our being able
to penetrate far into the interior of the country.</p>
<p>In the course of the day I had gone over a range of hills, the
ground of which was full of granite stones, which made our
advance a very laborious one. The trees there are the blue-gum
and ironbark, of medium height. The most abundant stones are the
blue granite. The plants are similar to those in the environs of
the Hawkesbury. Water is found in great quantity in a number of
rivulets.</p>
<p>The thermometer marked&mdash;In the morning, 78&deg; 0'; at
noon, 90&deg; 0'; in the evening, 76&deg; 0'.</p>
<p>Southerly wind, almost calm; the heat was excessive, Towards 6
p.m. the thunder announced the coming of the storm; at 8 a little
rain, which soon ceased falling, the night being fine.</p>
<p>The distance from the river Nepean to the one marked
&mdash;&mdash;** was 71 miles. The distance covered until to-day
is:&mdash;S. 70&deg; W., 7 miles; S. 75&deg; W., 13 miles; N.
76&deg; W., 2 miles; S. 31&deg; W., 5&frac12; miles; S. 36&deg;
W., 1&frac34; mile: in all 100&frac12; miles.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The mark given in the original does not
resemble any on the map.&mdash;ED.]</p>
<p>On the 25th November I continued my route, going over several
ranges of hills covered with bush and angular stones, which
rendered our march a very arduous one.</p>
<p>At noon I reached a large stream where I halted my troops for
dinner. The current of this stream is very rapid, and carries,
during the winter, a large quantity of granite stones fallen from
the mountains. Its western bank is composed of blue and red
granite. Wild ducks are plentiful here, but it is difficult to go
near to shoot them.</p>
<p>I saw a lizard 18 inches in length, which I made my men kill.
His abdomen was red. This peculiarity determined me in taking its
skin off to preserve it; but I could not succeed, as its scales
fell off as I touched them.</p>
<p>A perfect calm and an excessive heat lasted up to 3 p.m.,
when, a small breeze having arisen, I pursued my march by going
over several hills the direction of which was north and south.
The soil was of the same nature as before mentioned.</p>
<p>At 6 o'clock I found myself at a distance of 2 miles from the
western passage. I was obliged to climb over a very steep height,
at the summit of which I found a cave large enough to contain
twenty men. I was then at only half a mile from the passage, and
I sent two men in order to discover it, instructing them to
ascend the mountain at the north of this passage. The rain
compelled me to seek a shelter for myself and my men in the cave
which, the natives assured me, was the home of wombats. I waited
till 7 o'clock in the cave for my two men, who related to me that
after passing the range which was in front of us we would enter
an immense plain; that from the height where they were on the
mountain they had caught sight of only a few hills standing here
and there in this plain; and that the country in front of them
had the appearance of a meadow.</p>
<p>On the faith of this favourable report, I continued my march
until nightfall, climbing over a hill comparatively easy of
access, which led me to the mouth of the passage*** formed by a
perpendicular cut in the mountain, the profiles of which, north
and south, were of an immense height and presented to the eye a
majestic aspect. On the sandy soil of this passage an infinite
number of small traces made by the wild beasts could be seen.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The width of this passage is about half a
mile; its sides are perpendicular. The mountain is very steep and
full of caves which are the homes of various wild beasts which go
there in crossing the swamps near by. From a short distance the
swamp could be mistaken for a meadow, filled as it is with reeds,
which prevents the water with which it is well provided and which
is very good, being seen. These reeds are similar to those
growing inland in Europe. The water is taken from this swamp by a
rivulet running south-westwardly. It was dry when I arrived, but
the rain had filled it during the night with a large quantity of
water.]</p>
<p>The rain started falling heavily, accompanied by thundering,
and I made my troop hasten so as to arrive beyond the passage and
there look for a suitable place to spend the night. After walking
another mile, I reached a small hillock at 20 paces from a swamp,
where I determined to stop.</p>
<p>I sent men to try and find the trees to get the bark necessary
for the building of our huts. This work was completed with as
much celerity as circumstances allowed, and after every one was
sheltered they congratulated themselves with having succeeded in
accomplishing the passage of the Blue Mountains without
accident.</p>
<p>The distance covered to-day was W. 17 miles. The
thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 63&deg; 0'; at noon, 82&deg; 0
'; in the evening, 68&deg; 0'; southerly wind; during the whole
morning the heat was unbearable; very stormy night.</p>
<p>On the 26th November, at daybreak, I left with two men to
verify by myself the configuration of the ground, and to
ascertain whether the passage of the Blue Mountains had really
been effected. I climbed the chain of mountains north from us,
and when I had reached the middle of this height, the view of a
plain as vast as the eye could reach confirmed to me the report
of the previous day.</p>
<p>Encouraged by this inspection, I continued to ascend up to the
summit of the height, from where I discovered, towards the west,
and at a distance which I estimated to be 40 miles, a range of
mountains much higher than those we had passed. Some of these
mountains appeared as if they were denuded of trees, and by the
differences in the colours and shades I thought I could
distinguish in the distance immense rocks which, by their
juxtaposition, had the appearance of houses of different sizes.
From where I was I could not detect any obstacle to the passage
right to the foot of these large mountains. The view of the
country below me was immense; that of the country I had gone over
extended itself to a great distance. I estimated that I had made
a gradual ascent of 14 miles from the parts I had travelled,
whilst the ground towards which I was going appeared to me to be
hardly 1 mile lower than the sugar-loaf summit on which I was
standing. All the objects appeared to me clear and distinct on
this side, but those on the other side, which we had traversed,
looked entirely confused and mixed with vapours or hidden by the
fog.</p>
<p>The westerly wind was blowing very hard, and scarcely allowed
me to stand on my feet. I heard a noise resembling the roaring of
the waves when breaking upon the rocks of the shore, and which
could be heard from a distance of nearly 2 miles. The cold was
excessive. The thermometer, which stood at 61&deg; at the base of
the mountain, had descended to 56&deg;.</p>
<p>The whole of this mountain, from base to summit, is composed
of hard sandstone, and large rocks are ready to roll down the
precipice at the slightest effort. Most of the trees growing here
are short gum-trees, all crooked, and inclining usually towards
the east. I have not seen one more than 20 feet in height.</p>
<p>I was under the impression that I had passed the centre of the
mountains, as I did not find any more granite but only sandstone,
and I resolved to advance as far as the summit of the chain of
mountains which I had discovered at a great distance towards the
west. Possessed by this hope, I went back to my men, and I had
everything put in readiness for our departure. After breakfast I
made a sketch of the place, and started marching in a westerly
direction, but I was not long following this direction before I
came across hills barring the passage, an impediment which I
could not have foreseen, not even judged, by the appearance from
the place where my discovery was made, everything seeming so
perfectly level from that height.</p>
<p>I continued marching in various directions, looking for the
shortest way to reach my goal. At 11 o'clock I was on the banks
of a creek, which I followed until 5 p.m., and I arrived at a
river much larger than the one I had seen on the 24th [? 25th,
ante, p. 795] instant.</p>
<p>The current of this river is very rapid, and flows between two
chains of very high mountains, which give to only one part of its
banks an accessible space. The widest parts where I passed were
not more than 20 feet. Very often I could not find any passage at
all, and was obliged to walk on the slopes of the steep mountains
at the risk of falling from the precipices into the water.</p>
<p>I proceeded in that manner in a northerly direction for more
than one hour. Arriving at the junction of this river with a
rather large stream, I crossed it at a waterfall caused by an
agglomeration of rocks carried there by the waters of the stream,
and I settled there for the night on a spot which appeared
suitable to me.</p>
<p>The whole day had offered to my troops nothing but a
continuation of dangers in walking through rocks and jumping over
precipices. I did not meet with any traces which could indicate
that this country was frequented by the natives, the only thing I
came across being the bark of a tree near a stream where we spent
the night, which had been taken off long ago, and which I
surmised had been used in building the hut of a native who
probably had taken refuge here to escape his enemies.</p>
<p>Whilst my men were engaged preparing everything for the night,
I went over a short distance on the banks of the stream, and
picked up a few interesting stones, among which were some
sandstones containing sea-shells and several other foreign
matters.* These stones seemed as if they had been carried from
the summit of the mountain by this stream, which I imagined came
from a very elevated ravine.</p>
<p class="foot">[* These discoveries, which seemed to me
interesting for a naturalist, strengthened my perseverance, as I
hoped from day to day I would be able to make more useful
ones.]</p>
<p>On the following clay I resolved to verify the correctness of
my suppositions. I found on the banks of the stream, quite close
to the water, a small tree which I took as a kind of fig-tree.**
It possesses all its characteristics&mdash;the lightness of its
wood, the kind of milk flowing from its leaves when they are cut,
and the thin points at their edge which stick to the hands when
they are touched, and cause a pain which lasts for a long
time.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The height of this tree is about 4 feet. The
leaves are nearly similar to those of the fig-tree of Europe. It
has a very small root, and when its wood is cut it has the
appearance of the sugar-cane. I was not able to get any fruit or
flower from this tree, but I have kept some leaves, which may be
of some use in ascertaining its genus.]</p>
<p>Another small tree I found, also near the stream, bears a
fruit which is red like a cherry, and of about the same size,
with the difference that its stone is half uncovered and black,
which makes a singular contrast with the red colour of the
fruit.</p>
<p>This tree is rather pretty and stands about 8 feet high. Its
trunk is only 2 inches in diameter. It has a large number of
branches, and, like our pepper trees, its leaves are quite green.
I preserved the stone of the fruit with great care.</p>
<p>The weather to-day was the coldest I have experienced since I
have been in the woods.</p>
<p>My progress during this day, following an easterly direction,
was 14 miles. The thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 61&deg; 0 ';
at noon, 70&deg; 30'; in the evening, 60&deg; 0'.</p>
<p>On the 27th November, I sent early in the morning two of my
men to the summit of the mountain, at the foot of which we had
spent the night, to see whether it was possible to travel on its
crest.</p>
<p>Their report was far from being satisfactory. They had tried
several places without success, and had been obliged to come
down, running great risks. They assured me that all the mountains
were like as many pyramids by the side of one another; that
should it even be practicable to get to the top of one of them,
it would be necessary to descend it and ascend another; and that
the dangers were evident without the slightest appearance of
success.</p>
<p>After serious consideration I came to the conclusion that it
would not be prudent to go any further into these mountains, and
I resolved to follow the stream which dipped to the west.</p>
<p>I could hardly find a passage for my troop through the
sharp-edged stones and pebbles which obstructed it on all sides.
I was obliged to cross from one side to the other according to
the smaller or larger amount of obstacles which impeded our
march, and sometimes to go into the bed of the stream, being up
to our knees in water. Our boots were all torn and our feet full
of wounds, and it was necessary in that state to pass over
waterfalls and frightful precipices.</p>
<p>At about noon I stopped my troop in a place where some
fern-trees grew, the trunks of which were about 10 inches in
diameter. My young natives started cutting the trunk of one of
them with their axes, and when it fell they were frightened by a
snake which came in our direction. They uttered cries of alarm
which warned us in time and enabled one of my soldiers to strike
it on the head with a stick and kill it without much
trouble.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** This snake was 7 feet long and had a girth
of 3 inches. The natives skinned it and roasted it with some
portion of the trunk of the fern-tree which they ate with
it.]</p>
<p>I picked up a great number of fossils rolled by the waters of
the stream. I preserved only the most interesting fragments. This
part of the stream is rather pleasant, as there is a great number
of small trees, with dense foliage and full of birds' nests,
which throw their shade on its banks. The high mountains,
adjacent, are covered with trees, some of which are of a majestic
height, and the whole offers to the view glimpses of very
interesting scenery.</p>
<p>At 3 o'clock I continued my journey, still following the banks
of the stream. I could hear the singing of pheasants of this
country and other birds of a smaller species. I proceeded onward
in this manner till 5 o'clock. From then to 6 o'clock I passed
waterfalls of various heights, and I was at last stopped by a
sheet of water 8 to 10 feet deep, the banks of which were cut
perpendicularly and basin-shaped.</p>
<p>It was no use attempting swimming across, as the rocks on each
side were perpendicular, and polished by the water, rendering the
climbing on the other side an utter impossibility.</p>
<p>I sent one of my men to try a way at the rear, and when a
quarter of an hour had elapsed he made his appearance on the
other side of the basin. He had succeeded in reaching there by
descending the mountain, but he assured me he was not better off,
having at the back of him a series of basins which it was only
possible to pass by going back to the mountain and walking round
its side till coming to the last.</p>
<p>When he had returned I made my troop retrograde about fifty
paces, and he pointed out to me the easiest way to reach the
summit. We had at first to climb over rocks nearly 150 feet in
height, full of very sharp points, after which we pursued our
march to the west on the summit of the mountain, where I made my
troop rest for a little while.</p>
<p>The rocks here are generally sandstone, in which various
shells are imbedded. Several fragments bear the appearance of
having fallen from the adjoining mountains, which stand at least
half a mile higher than this, and are mainly perpendicular. The
soil is very arid, but the trees generally high, although the
situation of this place is quite similar to that where the trees
are short and crooked. Having descended this mountain with
difficulty, I found myself once more on the banks of the stream,*
where I continued my march without encountering any obstacle till
8 p.m., when I decided to pass the night on a spot well protected
by various kinds of brushwood.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This stream receives several springs which run
down the mountains on both sides. Its current is very rapid, and
there are marks on its banks which show that during freshets the
water rises to from 15 to 20 feet. A large quantity of small
trees and brushwood grow on its borders, and make a kind of shade
inaccessible to the sun. The birds, which are here in great
numbers, hang their nests, as if by a thread, to the branches of
the trees. These nests are of a marvellous construction, having
the shape of an ellipsis. The opening is in the centre, and the
top part is so well covered that the heaviest rain cannot
penetrate into it. There are never more than two eggs in each
nest, and I noticed with attention that when they are hatched the
mother takes great care in keeping the nest very clean. Every
time it enters to feed its little ones it is seen coming out its
claws laden with excreta, which it never neglects taking away
every time it comes to the nest. This part abounds in various
kinds of very dangerous reptiles.]</p>
<p>While our supper was being prepared I sent two men to examine
the surrounding country, and they came back and told me that at a
quarter of a mile in front of us there was a waterfall nearly 100
feet high.</p>
<p>I had seen some birds, which appeared to me of a new species.
I shot several of them, which pleased me very much; and, among
them, one, the head, neck and part of the back of which were
scarlet on a black ground.</p>
<p>I found on the summit of this mountain two very old huts, with
the trace of their fire. We went to-day over 16 miles of country.
The thermometer marked&mdash;In the morning, 45&deg; 0'; at noon,
71&deg; 0'; in the evening, &mdash;&mdash;; westerly wind; very
cold night. The trees are generally blue-gum, and yellow-gum, and
a few stringybark.</p>
<p>On the 28th November I went round the neighbourhood to verify
the correctness of the report made the previous day by the man I
had sent.</p>
<p>I had a look at the waterfall, which did not appear to me to
be so high as it had been reported to be; but the impossibility
of passing over it was evident from the aspect of the
perpendicular rocks which formed it, as well as those at the
bases of the mountains against which it was standing.</p>
<p>I then seriously considered the situation in which I found
myself, seeing no appearance of my being able to procure any
beasts for the subsistence of my troop, except some snakes, which
it was repugnant to eat, and which, moreover, had to be got at
the risk of being poisoned by their bites.</p>
<p>Our provisions were nearly exhausted. The small quantity of
rice and flour left did not allow of my continuing to advance in
a country offering absolutely no resource.</p>
<p>The courage of my men was entirely abated, and nothing but the
orders for the return journey would suffice to dispel their
melancholy; therefore, I made them prepare everything to go back
to the dep&ocirc;t. After having cut a cross of St. Andrew on a
tree to indicate the terminus of my second journey, I returned by
the same route I had come, and reached the banks of the river at
6 p.m.</p>
<p>The thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 57&deg; 0 '; at noon,
76&deg; 0'; in the evening, 61&deg; 0'; westerly wind; very cold
night.</p>
<p>On the 29th November I continued my march, still following the
way I had come through, and at sunset I arrived at the passage
which I had found on the 25th instant, where I stopped for the
night in my old huts.</p>
<p>The thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 60&deg; 0 '; at noon,
70&deg; 30'; in the evening, 64&deg; 0'; westerly wind; very cold
night.</p>
<p>30th November.&mdash;I proceeded towards the dep&ocirc;t
following still the same way. During this day I picked up a
quantity of new plants, and at 6 o'clock I arrived at my old huts
without any accident.</p>
<p>The thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 58&deg; 0'; at noon,
89&deg; 0'; in the evening, 67&deg; 0'; southerly wind; excessive
heat the whole day.</p>
<p>On the 31st November (sic) our march across the granite rocks
was very laborious. My boots and those of my men were full of
holes. The heat was unbearable till 5 o'clock, when the wind
veered from west to south, and at 6 o'clock the storm began with
rain and thunder. The rain continued all night.</p>
<p>Two of my men I had sent hunting came back at 7 p.m. with two
kangaroos.</p>
<p>On arriving here I found that my huts had been burnt by the
natives, and we had great trouble in erecting new ones.</p>
<p>The thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 58&deg; 0'; at noon,
82&deg; 0'; in the evening, 63&deg; 0'; westerly wind until 5
p.m.; southerly for the rest of the day with heavy rain.</p>
<p>On the 1st December, I continued my return journey, still
following the banks of the river, and I halted at its confluence
with another creek.</p>
<p>The hunt of the previous day had procured good meals for my
men, and was instrumental in making them regain their good
spirits.</p>
<p>In the evening I went for a bathe in the river, where I took
from among the aquatic plants some insects which appeared to me
very interesting.</p>
<p>The thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 62&deg; 0 '; at noon,
84&deg; 30'; in the evening, 70&deg; 30'; very calm westerly
wind; very warm the whole day.</p>
<p>On the 2nd December, I started very early, being desirous of
reaching the dep&ocirc;t in good time. At noon I made my troop
rest on the border of the river, where they had a swim.</p>
<p>I continued my route at 3 o'clock, and several kangaroos came
in sight of us, but it was impossible to shoot them. With one
shot I killed two opossums, which one of the young natives had
pointed out to me on a blue-gum; they belonged to a species
called ring-tailed opossum.</p>
<p>I only reached the dep&ocirc;t at 8&middot;30 p.m.; I found
there one of my soldiers (Witthington) very ill.</p>
<p>The thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 64&deg; 0 '; at noon,
85&deg; 30'; in the evening, 78&deg; 0'; very calm; westerly wind
all day.</p>
<p>On the 3rd December, I made my men rest themselves after the
fatigues of the day before. The soldier Witthington was getting
worse. I was running short of provisions and I was not expecting
any by the return of the waggon. I decided to go to meet it, and
to send it back to Parramatta, with an order for fresh
provisions; or, should I miss it on my way, to proceed to
Parramatta and see to the sending of provisions myself.</p>
<p>I sent early in the morning two of my men to look for
kangaroos, and towards the evening they brought a young male
weighing about 50 lb.</p>
<p>The thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 67&deg; 0'; at noon,
84&deg; 0 '; in the evening, 77&deg; 30'; southerly wind.</p>
<p>I left on the 4th of December at 5.30 a.m., accompanied by two
men, carrying a few provisions.</p>
<p>I recommended the rest of my party staying at the dep&ocirc;t
not to leave it without an express written order from me, and
also to be very careful of their provisions, promising them a
prompt relief.</p>
<p>I advanced, following the traces of the wheels of the waggon,
and towards noon I took a rest on the banks of a creek. A little
while after I heard the report of a gun, a circumstance which
filled me with joy, as I was persuaded it could only have been
fired by the drover of the waggon. I resumed my march at once,
and after half-an-hour had elapsed my two young natives saw the
escort, and a moment after came to tell me that Gogy and his
child were there. The waggon was soon alongside of us. It did not
bring any provisions, because they had been refused on account of
their having no order from me. They only had what was necessary
for the escort to reach the dep&ocirc;t.</p>
<p>I learnt from the drover that the Governor had sent three men
to the plain where the wild cattle were, in the hope of their
being able to catch some by means of traps which they were going
to set. The Governor had promised these men great encouragements
if they succeeded. I learnt at the same time that His Excellency
had the intention of coming to visit the country accompanied by
some of his friends, and satisfy his curiosity by examining wild
cattle in herds. However, I had no intimation of this in the
letter I received from him on that day.</p>
<p>I made the men of the escort take courage by giving them a
glass of rum, and ordered the waggon to return towards the Cow
Pastures. A little while after I saw an animal which I mistook
for a kangaroo, but in advancing nearer I saw that it was two
wild dogs, which barked for a long time whilst running
away.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** There is a large number of these dogs in the
Cow Pasture Plain. They allow people to go pretty near them, but
in spite of that it is very difficult to kill any of them.]</p>
<p>Towards 8 p.m. I saw three natives in a valley to which we
were going. They seemed to distrust us, and placed themselves in
a defensive attitude; but when they saw the waggon which they had
left in the morning they were soon reassured, and they received
us as friends.</p>
<p>I made Gogy build a hut to shelter the effects which were in
the waggon, and I established myself there for the night, taking
care to use the barrel of rum as a pillow, fearing the
indiscretion of my men.</p>
<p>In my hurry, when I left the dep&ocirc;t I had forgotten to
take the thermometer, and I was sorry of that circumstance, which
precluded me from giving the degree of heat of this part of the
country.</p>
<p>On the 5th December I sent the waggon away, escorted by four
men, to whom I gave my two young natives as guides, and whose
orders were to bring back some provisions. I decided I would wait
for their return, giving them express instructions to be back as
quickly as they possibly could, as I was willing to attempt for
the third time to find a passage across the Blue Mountains by
following the second river, which, it appeared to me, came from
the south-west.</p>
<p>I wrote about this intention to His Excellency, who, in his
letters, always recommended me to the perseverance which was so
necessary to the journey I had undertaken.</p>
<p>After the waggon had gone I went hunting with Gogy. I saw
several kangaroos, but they were too shy for us to be able to
shoot them. I came back at 11 o'clock with empty hands.</p>
<p>The men who had been sent to try and catch the cattle, and who
had left here early in the morning, returned in the evening very
tired and unsuccessful. They told me they had met a bull which
was very lame from a wound inflicted by a spear thrown at him by
some native defending himself, and which it still had in its
side. This spear came three or four feet out of the side of the
poor animal, and formed an acute angle with its legs.</p>
<p>Near 4 o'clock we heard thunder, but without rain. The heat of
the day was unbearable, and I eagerly wished for some rain to
fall. The wind was all day to the south, but very calm.</p>
<p>On the 7th December, I again went kangaroo hunting, but I was
not more successful than on the previous days.</p>
<p>In crossing a dry rivulet, I discovered that its banks were
composed of a kind of slate, very friable, the different strata
of which became whiter and whiter in proportion as it went deeper
into the ground, and formed themselves into various solid bodies,
assuming the form of lozenges interspersed with crooked branches
more or less extended. These lozenges are calcareous. Vitriolic
acid causes them to effervesce.</p>
<p>The heat became so intense that I was obliged to seek a refuge
in the hollow part of a rock in going up the rivulet.</p>
<p>A slight southerly breeze rose at about 5 o'clock, and rain
commencing to fall I was compelled to go back to the camp.</p>
<p>The cattle hunters had no more success to-day than
yesterday.</p>
<p>Whilst I was in the hollow rock my attention was attracted by
a large number of rats, nearly of the same kind as ours, which
live in holes they make in the ground and in the trunks of trees.
The natives make them come out by lighting fires in the holes,
and they then catch them with their hands.</p>
<p>On the 8th December we had southern wind, and the rain fell
continually till 4.30 p.m. I went with Gogy in search of
opossums, accompanied by his wife and child, who, on the way,
were looking for the nests of large ants, the eggs of which they
eat greedily.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** These ants are very large and very plucky.
They defend their habitations with an incredible obstinacy. Their
sting causes a sharp pain, which lasts for a long time, and the
natives take great care to protect their legs against it as much
as they can. If they are hit with a switch they rush to it and
bite it; and if they are pursued, they bite it while retreating,
facing their aggressor all the time.]</p>
<p>I travelled the plain for a while, and Gogy, having detected
on the trunk of a tree the fresh traces of an opossum, climbed it
and caught two very large ones. He threw one down after he had
killed it, but the other gave him more trouble. He was obliged to
enlarge the hole where it was, and to draw it out with a crooked
stick. He then threw it down alive and I shot it dead when, in
trying to escape, it was climbing another tree. The two opossums
were the only articles of food I could procure on that day. The
wind kept to the south.</p>
<p>On the 9th December, rain and thundering all day long. The
large branches of the trees under which our huts were standing
were quite rotten, and, in falling, exposed us to the danger of
being crushed under them.</p>
<p>At 6 p.m. a wild dog came at a short distance from our
huts.</p>
<p>My greyhound chased and overtook it, but it came back after
having given and received a few bites. Southerly wind all
day.</p>
<p>On the 10th December, the weather having changed for the
better, I sent two men hunting whilst I occupied myself with
looking for plants. My hunters returned at 10 o'clock with a
young kangaroo, which was of great help. As we were absolutely
short of food. I had part of it prepared for our dinner, and
arranged for the rest to be preserved for cases of need.</p>
<p>About 4 p.m. I saw a native coming. Gogy went to welcome him,
and after a short conversation, they came and sat by my side.</p>
<p>I learnt from this native that Kelly had passed at Manhangle
in the morning, accompanied by two men and one horse loaded with
provisions, and that they had shot at them several times. He told
me that himself and Wooglemai, whom I knew, were the only men in
his party, the rest being women and children. They had been
obliged to run away, and one bullet passed very near his
shoulders. Having seen my camp, he had come to make his complaint
to me.* When he had finished speaking, he took his net and gave
me several swamp shells, which I liked very much. I gave him, in
return, a joint of kangaroo, which he ate, and, picking up his
axe and his net, he returned whence he had come.</p>
<p class="foot">[* It is not of any advantage, but, on the
contrary, it is very dangerous, to offer any insult to the
natives. They avenge themselves of it sooner or later, and the
first white man they meet without means of defence becomes their
victim. They make use of the most cruel tortures on the one they
can catch, whoever he might be, without troubling in the least
about enquiring whether he belonged or not to the party who
ill-treated them.]</p>
<p>The weather was fair to-day and the heat moderate.</p>
<p>On the 11th December, thinking the waggon would very likely
cross the river in the morning, I went with Gogy and two of my
men to meet it. When I arrived at Manhangle I directed my march
towards a fire I had caught sight of, and when I was thirty paces
from it, the native pointed out to me a big wild dog lying in a
bush.</p>
<p>I thought that if I hid myself I would be able to shoot it,
but my greyhound had just perceived it, and running to it they
started fighting. They fought for a while, then my dog let it go
at a great distance from me.</p>
<p>Gogy told me that the fire I had reached by that time had been
lighted by the native who had come to complain the day
before.</p>
<p>I saw several natives on the bank opposite Manhangle, who,
recognising Gogy, called him. He went to them after giving his
new axe to his wife. He told me he would come to meet me at
Barhagal.</p>
<p>On the 12th December, I sent the soldiers back under the
guidance of a native, and I left with Gogy, his wife, and her
brother, a very intelligent boy, who insisted upon following
me.</p>
<p>After crossing the large creek, at about 6 o'clock, I met a
superb black ox, which looked at me, without being frightened. I
chased it, and it disappeared in the scrub.</p>
<p>Gogy set the country over which we were passing on fire to
avenge ourselves on the natives who had burnt our huts. I arrived
at the second creek at 5.30, where I found my huts burnt, and I
continued to walk till 7.30 so as to get to the third creek,
where I settled for the night.</p>
<p>I discovered here several traces of the natives who had passed
with the women and the children on the previous clay, and who
seemed to have directed their steps towards our dep&ocirc;t. I
feared they might have molested the people I had left there, and
this thought made me very uneasy.</p>
<p>The day was fair, with moderate heat. We had a nice southerly
breeze. My men killed a large male kangaroo.</p>
<p>I started early on the morning of the 13th December. As
before, I found my huts had been burnt, and I was at the
dep&ocirc;t at 9 o'clock. I found everything in the same order as
when I left, except that the sick soldier was much worse.</p>
<p>I thought it was necessary to send him away on the following
day, and when I told him of his departure the satisfaction that
news caused him seemed to diminish his sufferings.</p>
<p>I heard from a man in the dep&ocirc;t, who had gone hunting on
the 12th, that he had met seven natives, who had stopped at a
gunshot from him. He was then pursuing a big kangaroo, which on
seeing the natives had stopped, turning its back on my man, who,
having come nearer, placed himself behind a tree, and shot at the
animal which fell with a hind-leg broken. This had rid him of the
natives, who when they had heard the detonation, and seen the
kangaroo fall, had taken to their heels, uttering great
shouts.</p>
<p>While I was away, the people at the dep&ocirc;t lighted every
night a large fire in front of the huts, and retired in some bush
fifty paces behind, always having a sentry on duty to warn them
in case any natives came. By this means they were insured against
any surprise, and would have been able to easily disperse the
natives without these latter even seeing them. At 9 o'clock in
the evening, after having given the orders for the night, and
placed the sentry at his post, I had some rum distributed to each
of my men, and made them retire to their huts.</p>
<p>The day was very warm; lightning and thundering lasted till
the evening with a little rain.</p>
<p>The thermometer&mdash;At noon, 90&deg; 0 '; in the evening,
78&deg; 0'.</p>
<p>On the 14th December the fog which cleared off about 10 in the
morning was replaced by very fine weather, and I sent the waggon
back with the patient and two men. I gave them Gogy's
brother-in-law as a guide. I had had great trouble in persuading
the latter to leave his sister, of whom he was very fond. I only
decided him by giving him a soldier's vest.</p>
<p>After the waggon had gone I made my men clean their arms, and
I got everything prepared for my departure. I limited to six the
number of those who were to accompany me. I felt nearly certain
of being successful this time, by following the river, the source
of which must be in the mountains, which I could not reach.</p>
<p>Gogy told me that by following that river I would enter the
territory of a tribe who do not use the whamharha. Their spears
are much longer than those belonging to the natives of these
countries, and they are made from branches of trees which they
straighten with fire. These natives cannot throw their spears to
a great distance, on account of the way they hold it. He also
told me they were anthropophagi, and that we ought not to try and
mix with them, because they would play us some nasty trick.** The
thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 72&deg; 0'; at noon, 96&deg;
30'; in the evening, 80&deg; 30'; westerly wind; intense
heat.</p>
<p class="foot">[** While Gogy was telling me all that, I
sometimes pretended to doubt his veracity, and burst out
laughing. He then used to get quite angry, and told me in
English: "Well, master, you will see that I am not a liar."]</p>
<p>On the 15th December I went away with my six men, leaving
three well-armed soldiers at the dep&ocirc;t. I told Gogy to
follow me. I had persuaded him to leave his wife at the
dep&ocirc;t, and we had already proceeded 2 miles in the gorge,
following a direction S. 75&deg; 0', when we heard a woman's
shouts. It was Gogy's wife, who would not, she said, stay at the
dep&ocirc;t with strangers.</p>
<p>This incident put me to the inconvenience of having this woman
and her child at my train, and I still continued marching in the
gorge. On arriving at the first river the woman was exhausted,
and I was obliged to halt near the water. Whilst dinner was being
prepared I saw the country a mass of flames towards the
north-east, at about 5 miles from us, near the mountains.</p>
<p>Gogy told me it was Goondel who, with his party, was hunting
bandicoots, lizards, snakes, kangaroo rats, &amp;c., and that we
must not disturb him.</p>
<p>I saw he was frightened. I reassured him by saying that my
intention was not to follow the banks of this river where we
were, but to cross over to the other side after dinner in order
to continue our march as far as my old quarters, where I expected
we would spend the night. I did not want to hurry, as I had
plenty of time to arrive there. I told him he need not be afraid
at night, because I had my greyhounds, which would warn us should
some strangers come. This way of reasoning appeared to satisfy
him.</p>
<p>When at about 3 o'clock I was proceeding forward I was
astonished to see Gogy with his child upon his shoulders marching
in front. This was an indication that he would soon leave me.</p>
<p>We arrived in the evening at my old quarters, where I found my
huts had been pulled down. Gogy put them up again. He closed one
of their openings with branches from the trees, and he made a bed
for himself by the fireside with the bark of tea-tree, which is
very soft. The heat was excessive during the whole day.</p>
<p>The thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 70&deg; 30'; at noon,
93&deg; 20'; at 4 o'clock, 92&deg; 50'; in the evening, 76&deg;
0'; southern wind; sky cloudy.</p>
<p>On the 16th December Gogy came and told me that his wife not
being able to follow us, he was obliged to go back to the
dep&ocirc;t with her. It was but an excuse. The fact was that,
being on the territory of Goondel, he was afraid of falling into
the hands of that chief.*** He suspected that Goondel had
discovered he had taken a part in the murder of his sister, and
he was certain that he would not spare him should he succeed in
seizing him. He kept continually on his guard and well armed when
he was compelled to travel in his territory. I allowed him to go,
and continued my march to the second river. On our way we killed
a kangaroo.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Gogy had told me long before my journey into
the mountains that he had been obliged to fly to Goondel's to
escape being punished for an offence he had committed. Goondel
had kept him and hidden him, providing for all his wants with the
greatest friendship. After he had stayed with him for a long time
he left him to go to his people, whose anger had abated, and,
after having submitted himself to the usual punishment, he was
well received, and nobody made any allusion to the past.
Unfortunately, having made an incursion with a friend of his, a
great enemy of Goondel's, they had met a woman of this chief's
tribe in the neighbourhood of Nattai. His friend pursued her,
caught her, and, after having perpetrated upon her the usual
brutalities, he killed her, and, having tied her to a tree, they
cut off some of her flesh, which they grilled and ate.]</p>
<p>At 9 in the morning I arrived at my old hut, after having
covered 5 miles. I did not stop walking until 11 o'clock, adding
up 4 miles more, and I then halted for dinner.</p>
<p>At 3 in the afternoon I turned to the left of my old route,
and after marching 1&frac34; mile, I came to a large swamp, which
I crossed, following the traces of the kangaroos, which are very
numerous here. In proceeding on this flat country I had the
pleasure of pursuing many of them, but could not catch any.</p>
<p>Towards 6 in the evening I arrived on the banks of the river,
opposite a large creek. I crossed it to establish myself for the
night on a point formed by their junction. The trees I came
across on my route to-day were the apple-trees. The soil is
black, and the trees which grow in it are of such a height and
are so beautiful that there cannot be any doubt as to the
fertility of this soil. I have detected here no indication of the
country being liable to inundation. My progress from the place
where I left the old route, which is marked <b>&Oslash;</b>,*
was:&mdash;S., 1&frac34; mile; S. 65&deg; W., 5 miles; in all,
6&frac34; miles. The thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 62&deg;
0'; at noon, 83&deg; 0 '; in the evening, 75&deg; 0'.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In fact, a full cross inside a circle]</p>
<p>On the 17th December the westerly wind was so violent that in
falling down the branches of the trees rendered our march very
difficult. On proceeding further I found several trees nearly
uprooted.</p>
<p>After progressing for 4 miles towards S. 24&deg; E., the
composition of the soil changed, and became a kind of whitish
clay, covered with small pebbles, and absolutely bad. The trees
were blue-gum, yellow-gum, ironbark, mahogany, &amp;c. At noon I
came in front of a mountain very remarkable on account of its
pyramidal form. I shot a few wild ducks, which were the only game
I could get. I then took a sketch of the country, and resumed my
march, stopping my troop at 1 o'clock for dinner.</p>
<p>It was about 2 o'clock when I perceived a great volume of
smoke coming from the west.</p>
<p>I sent some men to ascertain where it was coming from, but I
could not obtain any particulars. The men I had sent returned
very tired, and told me that after having ascended and descended
several hills that had come to the base of the mountains, and
that they had seen the smoke issuing from the other side of the
range.</p>
<p>I resumed my march at 3.30 in the afternoon, going round
various hills denuded of trees, which take rise in the mountains
and slope down to the banks of the river nearly at right angles.
The fallen rocks* and the precipices offered obstacles very
difficult to surmount.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The falls are caused by torrents coming from
the mountains. The astonishing ravages they make is evidenced by
the large number of uprooted gigantic trees one sees there, and
by the enormous rocks rolled down into the very bed of the
river.]</p>
<p>I saw another column of smoke towards west-north-west, but I
could not ascertain whether it was caused by the natives or some
volcano. I was surrounded with mountains on all sides, the only
passage I had being the banks of the river, which were often
almost inaccessible. Besides, the more I advanced the more the
river trended towards the south, and this fact left me no hope of
being able to cross the mountains. I was simply following their
bases, which had the appearance of a multitude of pyramids or
cones, standing like as many detached sugar-loaves placed on top
of one another.</p>
<p>Even supposing I could overcome all these obstacles, I would
arrive at a chain of mountains the direction of which is about
north and south, and the height of which, compared to that of the
sugar-loaves, is immense. This chain of mountains, which is the
one I had passed on the 23rd November, could only be ascended by
making almost superhuman efforts.</p>
<p>I discovered at various places indications which left no doubt
as to this country being inhabited, or at all events frequently
visited, by the natives. From their own reports, they assemble
there when they make incursions into enemies' territory, or when
some troubadour comes with his party to sing and teach them a new
song. This is a custom which seems to have extended even to these
regions.</p>
<p>The country, generally speaking, is very sterile. No
quadrupeds can be seen there, but, by way of compensation,
reptiles of all kinds&mdash;snakes, lizards, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.&mdash;swarm about. Flies are rather scarce and very
small. The change which the nature of the country presents after
two days' walk is really surprising.</p>
<p>The trees are for the most part ironbark blue-gum, and
yellow-gum, of a medium girth; however, some of them are really
gigantic ones, but this is the exception. The base of the
mountain is here of blue granite and the summit is full of caves
of smaller or larger dimensions.</p>
<p>I stopped at 8.10 p.m. in a small plain to pass the night. I
found there the ruins of very old huts belonging to the natives.
One of my men who was trying to re-erect one, felt one of the
most venomous kinds of snakes encircle his arm, and he could not
get rid of it without exposing himself to the danger of dying
from its bite. I would not stop in such a dangerous place, and I
advanced till I reached the foot of a small hill, at which after
having had the bush around us burnt down and by this means having
put a barrier between us and the reptiles, I chose to make my
troop rest for the night. My route to-day was&mdash;S. 26&deg;
30' E. 3 miles; S. 44&deg; 0' W. 2&frac34; miles; N. 58&deg; 0'
W. 1&frac34; mile; S. 38&deg; 0' W. 12&frac14; miles; in all,
19&frac12; miles.</p>
<p>The thermometer&mdash;In the morning, 60&deg; 40': at noon,
77&deg; 0'; in the evening, 61&deg; 0': westerly wind.</p>
<p>On the 18th December I started on my way back to the
dep&ocirc;t by the same route I had taken in coming over,
arriving there on the 20th without accident. I found everybody in
the same state as when I left, and I found that Gogy, tired of
waiting for me, had returned to Prospect Hill with his wife and
child.</p>
<p>The thermometer&mdash;In the morning of the 18th, 62&deg; 0';
at noon, 77&deg; 0'; in the evening, 64&deg; 0'; very cold
westerly wind. In the morning of the 19th, 68&deg; 0'; at noon,
76&deg; 0'; in the evening, 70&deg; 0'; westerly wind. In the
morning of the 20th, 68&deg; 30'; at noon, 76&deg; 0': in the
evening, 70&deg; 0'; southerly wind.</p>
<p>I left the dep&ocirc;t on the 21st December on my way to
Sydney, taking three men with me, and I gave those I left behind
the necessary orders for the arrangement of the effects they were
to escort. I arrived in Sydney after three days' hard walking,
and the kind reception extended to me by His Excellency quite
compensated me for all my hardships, and, to some extent,
consoled me for having failed in the accomplishment of what I had
planned, viz., going over the Blue Mountains by the route I had
thought of.</p>
<p>But, in the meantime, I was hopeful of being more successful
in another journey which I was contemplating to undertake towards
the west, starting from Jervis Bay.<br>
