<p>BY the appointment of Lachlan Macquarie as governor of New South
Wales, the government showed that English opinion had changed
regarding the qualifications required by the man who was to
administer and control the affairs of the distant colony.
Macquarie's predecessors had been naval officers. When captain
William Bligh had been appointed at a salary of £2,000 <i>per
annum</i>, it had been recognised that the growth and importance of
the settlements made it necessary that an officer of not less than
flag rank should hold the position. The disastrous result of
placing a stern, outspoken naval post-captain in the command of a
colony where the military party was predominant had been shown in
the usurpation of Bligh's government. The appointment of a military
governor of equal rank was determined, and the final selection was
made of Macquarie. Instead of being accustomed to the bluff manners
of the quarter-deck, Macquarie was courteous and politic. He had
served on the staffs of the earls of Harrington and Cavan, Sir
Robert Abercromby, Sir David Baird, and General James Stuart, and
by experience had acquired the attributes necessary for an
executive officer to avoid friction and useless controversies.</p>

<p>Lachlan Macquarie was born on the 31st of January, 1761. He was
a descendant of the chiefs of the clan Macquarie in the island of
Ulva, one of the Hebrides islands. At the time of his birth, his
relative, Lauchlan Macquarrie, the sixteenth and last chief of the
clan, had fallen on evil days, and in 1778 the family estates were
sold by order of the creditors. Lachlan Macquarie was one of three
brothers; the eldest lived and died a farmer, Lachlan and Charles
entered the army. On the 9th of April, 1777, he was gazetted an
ensign in the second battalion of the 84th regiment. Until the end
of the year 1780, he served in Halifax and Nova Scotia, but was not
on active service in the field. On the 18th of January, 1781, he
received a commission as a lieutenant in the first battalion of the
71st Highland regiment, and was employed on garrison duty at New
York and Charleston until the close of the war with the American
colonies, when the regiment was transferred to Jamaica. On the 4th
of June, 1784, he was placed on the half-pay list, and he returned
to Scotland. In November, 1787, whilst residing with his mother at
Oskamull, he was offered the appointment of eldest lieutenant in
the 77th regiment, which was one of four regiments raised at that
time for service in India. The appointment was obtained through the
influence of general Allen Maclean, and was conditional on his
raising a quota of fifteen recruits for the regiment. This
condition was the customary practice when an officer was drawn from
the half-pay list and placed on full pay. Macquarie endeavoured to
raise the recruits in the Highlands and amongst the Macquaries of
Ulva, but failed utterly, notwithstanding the influence and
exertions of his relative, the old chief or Laird of Macquarie. He
thereupon travelled on foot and by ferry from Oskamull to Greenoch,
a distance of nearly one hundred miles. Thence he proceeded to
Glasgow and Edinburgh, where he was successful in raising the
required <i>quota.</i> An interesting side-light is thrown on the
customs of the time by Macquarie's statement,* relating to the
servant he enlisted for himself, that he "dresses hair remarkably
well, waits table, and plays very well upon the Fiddle."</p>
<p class="foot">[* This statement is contained in one of the
private journals of Governor Macquarie which are preserved in the
Mitchell library at Sydney. From these journals, many of the facts
in this introduction have been derived.]</p>
<p>Macquarie, with his recruits, joined the 77th regiment under
colonel Marsh at Dover; his commission as lieutenant had been
gazetted on the 25th of December, 1787. On the 28th of March, 1788,
he embarked on the East Indiaman <i>Dublin,</i> and arrived at
Bombay on the 3rd of August. The regiment remained in cantonments
near Bombay until the 24th of November, 1790, and during this
period (on the 9th of November, 1788) Macquarie was promoted to the
rank of captain-lieutenant. In December, 1790, the regiment was
removed to Tellicherry, and was employed in the campaign against
Tippoo Sahib. In this campaign, Macquarie saw his first active
service, and was present at the siege of Cannanore in December,
1790, and at the first siege of Seringapatam in February, 1792. On
the 24th of December, 1790, he was appointed regimental paymaster.
After peace was concluded with Tippoo Sahib, the 77th regiment
returned to Bombay in April, 1792.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of August, 1793, Macquarie received a staff
appointment, under Sir Robert Abercromby, as major of brigade of
the troops serving on the coast of Malabar. By this appointment,
his pay was increased sufficiently to enable him to wed, and on the
8th of September, 1793, he was married at Bombay to Miss Jane
Jarvis, a daughter of Thomas Jarvis, formerly chief justice of
Antigua. Miss Jarvis was possessed of moderate wealth in her own
right, and Macquarie, before his marriage, had paid off the debts
incurred at the time of receiving his commission, and had saved
sufficient money to enable him to make a small settlement on his
wife.</p>
<p>After his marriage, Macquarie remained at Bombay as major of
brigade and regimental paymaster until December, 1794. During this
period, he acquired as a staff officer his first experience of the
intricacies of administration, and at the same time passed the
happiest days of his life as a devoted husband. In December. 1794,
the 77th regiment was transferred to Calicut on the coast of
Malabar, and Macquarie with his wife accompanied the regiment.</p>
<p>In 1795, the armies of the French Republic conquered Holland.
The Stadtholder, the Prince of Orange, fled to England; and the
Batavian Republic was organised in close alliance with the Republic
of France. The government in India then decided to seize and hold
the Dutch settlement at Cochin on behalf of the Prince of Orange. A
military expedition was organised and marched from Calicut in
August of that year. Macquarie was employed in this campaign, and
was absent from Calicut from the 19th of August to the 30th of
October. This was the first occasion on which he was parted from
his wife, and the devotion of the couple is clearly shown by the
entries in his diary at this period. During the months of September
and October, Macquarie was present at the siege of the Dutch fort
at Cochin.</p>
<p>In November, 1795, Macquarie and his wife returned to Bombay.
Mrs. Macquarie was ailing, and had developed symptoms of
consumption. Shortly after their return, an expeditionary force was
formed at Bengal for the seizure of the Dutch settlements in
Ceylon, and on the 3rd of January, 1796, Macquarie sailed for
Ceylon, leaving his sick wife in the care of her sister and
friends. On the 5th of February, 1796, a landing was effected at
Negombo, twenty-four miles north of the capital, and eleven days
later the Dutch governor at Colombo capitulated. On the following
day (17th February), Macquarie was sent in command of a detachment
to take possession of the town and fort at Point de Galle. The
Dutch garrison at Galle capitulated on the 23rd of February, and
Macquarie became commandant of the town. For these services he was
very highly complimented. In the meantime, he had received grave
reports as to the state of his wife's health, and on the 19th of
March he resigned his command at Galle to return to Bombay.</p>
<p>After his return to Bombay, Macquarie was informed that his
wife's state of health was critical owing to the development of
tuberculosis of the lungs. He was advised to take her for a sea
voyage, and on the 18th of May, 1796, the devoted couple sailed on
a voyage to China. The voyage did not have the desired effect of
restoring her health, and Mrs. Macquarie died at Macao in China on
the 15th of July, at the early age of twenty-three years and a
half. Her death was a severe blow to Macquarie, and he gave many
evidences of his devotion. He removed the body to Bombay, where
burial took place on the 10th of January, 1797. He was a frequent
visitor to her tomb during his subsequent periods of residence at
Bombay, even after he had become engaged to his second wife. For
four years and two months he continuously wore crêpe on his
uniform, and during the same period maintained their house at
Bombay, although generally unoccupied. His fondness for lengthy
inscriptions, afterwards abundantly illustrated on the public
buildings of New South Wales, was shown in the epitaph which he
caused to be inscribed on the monument erected over his wife's
grave.</p>
<p>By the death of his wife, Macquarie inherited the sum of six
thousand pounds. A few years later, he expended this money in the
part purchase of a portion of the Lochbuy estate in Mull, for which
he paid £10,060. In memory of his wife, he named this land
Jarvisfield. On his visit to Scotland during the year 1804, he
formed plans for the erection of a country mansion, and the
development of this estate by draining swamps and the erection of a
village for crofters.</p>
<p>A commission bearing date 3rd of May, 1796, was granted to
Macquarie as major by brevet in the 86th regiment. His military
advancement continued, and he held several important posts. During
the year 1797, he was in command of the first division of the right
wing of the army in the campaign against Pyche Rajah. On the 19th
of May in the same year, he was appointed to the staff of general
James Stuart as major of brigade, and held this post until the year
1799. During this period, he was present at the battle of Sedaseer
on the 6th of March, 1798, when Tippoo Sahib's army was defeated,
and at the storming of Seringapatam on the 4th of May following,
when Tippoo was killed. On the 4th of December, 1799, he resumed
his former appointments as major of brigade and paymaster at
Bombay. During April and May, 1800, he was a member of the suite,
when governor Duncan visited Surat to form a constitution and
government. On the 5th of May, he was offered and accepted the
confidential position of military secretary on the staff of
governor Duncan, which post he held until his departure for
Egypt.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year 1801, an expeditionary force, under
the command of general (afterwards Sir) David Baird, was formed in
India to proceed to Egypt, to assist in the expulsion of the
French. On the 1st of April, Macquarie was appointed deputy
adjutant-general on Baird's staff, and five days later sailed from
Bombay on the ship <i>William.</i> On the 13th of June, the
disembarkation of the expedition was commenced at Cosseir. In the
meantime, news had been received of the landing of the grand army
under Sir Ralph Abercromby at Aboukir on the 8th of March. By the
appointment of another officer as deputy adjutant-general.
Macquarie had been superseded, but he remained on Baird's staff.
During the march of the expedition across the desert to the river
Nile, Macquarie was stationed at Cosseir and entrusted with the
superintendence of disembarking and forwarding stores. This work
was completed, and on the 27th of July he crossed the desert to
Kenné on the Nile, where he embarked and sailed down the river.
After stopping a few days at Cairo, he arrived at Rosetta on the
30th of August, the day on which the French garrison at Alexandria
had agreed to surrender. On the 2nd of September, he was present at
the formal capitulation. On the 7th of November, Macquarie's
abilities were recognised by his appointment as deputy
adjutant-general on the staff of the Earl of Cavan in command of
all the armies in Egypt. In consequence of this appointment, a
commission as lieutenant-colonel, bearing the same date, was
granted to Macquarie two years later (17th November, 1803). He
continued on staff duty until the 12th of May, 1802, when he
quitted headquarters at Alexandria and embarked at Suez for Bombay
twelve days later, with the Indian expeditionary force.</p>
<p>Whilst in Egypt he learnt that his commission to an effective
majority in the 86th regiment had been gazetted on the 15th
January, 1801, and on his return to Bombay on the 2nd of July,
1802, he assumed the command of that regiment. He was also
re-appointed military secretary on the staff of his friend and
patron, governor Duncan. His sojourn in India was short, and on the
15th of November he resigned the command of his regiment in order
to visit England. On the 5th of January, 1803, he resigned also his
appointment as military secretary, and on the following day sailed
for England on the East Indiaman <i>Sir Edward Hughes.</i></p>
<p>During this first period of service in the Indian army,
Macquarie had risen from the rank of senior lieutenant in the 77th
regiment to that of major and commanding officer in the 86th. He
had held several important staff appointments, and had become fully
conversant with the details of the administration of government in
India. He had arrived in the empire as a subaltern, indebted to his
uncle for money expended in obtaining his outfit and commission; on
the eve of his departure, he estimated that he was worth £14,000 in
lands and money, apart from the legacy of £6,000 bequeathed to him
by his wife.</p>
<p>Macquarie landed at Brighton in England on the 7th of May, 1803.
He carried despatches from governor Duncan at Bombay, in which he
was warmly commended for his services and knowledge of Indian
affairs. He was well received at the war office, and by the board
of control and the directors of the East India company. He was
presented at Court "on his return from India", and was invited to
dine with the board of directors of the company, a somewhat unusual
honour.</p>
<p>Macquarie was not long in idleness in London. War had been
declared with France, and on the 7th of July he was offered, by
direction of Lord Hobart, an appointment as one of three officers
on a military mission to Portugal to inquire into and report on the
condition of the army of that country. In spite of strong pressure
to induce him to accept, Macquarie declined the offer on account of
his ignorance of the Portuguese language. Eleven days later he was
appointed to the headquarters staff as assistant adjutant-general
for the district of London, under the command of the Earl of
Harrington.</p>
<p>Macquarie retained his staff appointment in London until April,
1805. During this period he became a typical courtier. He was
frequently in attendance on the Earl of Harrington at reviews and
inspections. He attended courts and levees, and indulged in the
usual social routine of a staff officer in London. He was commanded
to dine with the Prince of Wales, H.R.H. the Duke of Clarence, and
other members of the royal family, and in January, 1805, his
appointment as an aide-de-camp to the King was under consideration.
He was elected a member of several exclusive associations, and it
is clear that his career was assured when the opportunity
occurred.</p>
<p>In June, 1804, he obtained two months' leave of absence in order
to visit his aged mother at Oskamull, whom he had not seen for
seventeen years. During his visit to Scotland, he met his future
wife, and on the 26th of March, 1805, shortly before leaving
England, he became engaged to Elizabeth Henrietta Campbell, the
youngest daughter of his second cousin, John Campbell, of Airds. At
the same time, it was arranged that the marriage should not take
place until after Macquarie's return to England.</p>
<p>In March, 1805, Macquarie was ordered to return to India to take
command of the 86th regiment, which was without a field officer. On
the 25th of April, he embarked at Portsmouth for Bombay, where he
arrived on the 11th of August. He assumed command of the regiment,
and his old friend, governor Duncan, again appointed him military
secretary whilst he was stationed at Bombay. On the 1st of June,
1805, his appointment as lieutenant-colonel of the 73rd regiment
appeared in the <i>London Gazette.</i></p>
<p>Towards the end of the year 1805, a campaign against Holkar was
commenced, and for the last time Macquarie was engaged on field
service. In December, he took command of the frontier station at
Dohud, where he remained until it was evacuated on the 22nd of
January, 1806. Four weeks later he returned to Bombay and resumed
his duties as military secretary to the governor. Governor Duncan
had decided to leave India at the beginning of the year 1808, and
Macquarie had agreed to travel to England with him; the latter's
anxiety, however, to return to his fiancee induced him to obtain a
release from his engagement, and on the 19th of March, 1807, he
left Bombay for Bussorah to travel by overland route to England.
From Bussorah he journeyed by water to Bagdad, by caravan to the
Caspian sea, across Russia, by boat to Yarmouth, and arrived in
London on the 17th of October, 1807.</p>
<p>After his return to England, Macquarie was married to his second
wife, Miss Campbell, and he took command of the 73rd regiment,
which was quartered in Scotland.</p>
<p>In the year 1808, the Peninsula War was commenced, and public
attention was concentrated on the war and the struggle against
Napoleon in other parts of Europe. In the month of September, the
news of the usurpation of the government in New South Wales and the
arrest of Governor Bligh was received in London. The report at
first caused scanty comment; but in a few weeks Viscount
Castlereagh decided to appoint a successor to Governor Bligh, and
to send a regiment to the colony to relieve the New South Wales
Corps. In December, the appointment as governor was offered to and
accepted by brigadier-general Nightingall, who had recently
returned from service in the opening campaign of the Peninsula War.
About the same time, choice was made of the 73rd regiment under the
command of Macquarie as the proposed relief for the New South Wales
Corps.</p>
<p>Preparations for their departure were pushed forward by both
Nightingall and Macquarie. Nightingall busied himself in details of
administration, and in March, 1809, selected Ellis Bent as the new
judge-advocate for the colony. In the same month, Macquarie was
superintending the arrangements for the embarkation of his regiment
on the <i>Hindostan,</i> man-of-war, and the <i>Dromedary,</i>
naval store-ship. In the midst of the preparations, Nightingall was
taken ill, and about the middle of April it was realised that it
would be impossible for him to undertake the government. A new
governor was required, and at the end of the month Viscount
Castlereagh had given the appointment to Lachlan Macquarie. His
formal commission and instructions as captain-general and
governor-in-chief were dated the 8th and 9th of May, 1809.</p>
<p>It is evident that the appointment of Lachlan Macquarie (then
lieutenant-colonel) as governor of New South Wales was entirely due
to the accidents of life. Nightingall and the 73rd regiment had
been chosen to re-establish an authorised government in the colony.
Macquarie as commanding officer of the regiment was practically
second in command to Nightingall. The embarkation of the regiment
was intended to take place within a few days, when it was announced
that Nightingall's health prohibited his assuming his duties as
governor. Little time was available to select a substitute, and it
was not unnatural that the choice fell on Lachlan Macquarie, the
virtual second in command. Macquarie's commission was dated the day
after the regiment had actually embarked at Yarmouth. At the same
time it must be remembered that Macquarie had influence in high
quarters; he had considerable experience of administrative duties
in India; his knowledge of Indian affairs had been commended by
governor Duncan, of Bombay; his extended staff service had
developed habits of tact, courtesy and caution in his dealings with
his fellow-men; he was possessed of independent means, and was
unlikely to make use of his position for his pecuniary advancement;
and in minor posts, at Galle and Kohud, he had been commended for
his administrative capacity.</p>
<p>The appointment of Macquarie no doubt appeared an excellent one
according to opinions prevalent at the time, for the English
government had not realised that something more was required in the
governor of the colony than the mere qualifications of a service
administrator, and that a good naval or military officer had many
shortcomings when given arbitrary power over a civil community.</p>
<p>Macquarie embarked on the <i>Dromedary,</i> and in company with
the <i>Hindostan</i> sailed from St. Helens on the 22nd of May,
1809. After a tedious voyage, the two ships entered Port Jackson on
the 28th of December following, but owing to adverse winds it was
two days later before anchor was cast in Sydney Cove. On the
following morning. Sunday, the 31st of December. Macquarie made his
official landing, and was received with due formality by
lieutenant-governor Paterson and lieutenant-colonel Foveaux. His
commission was read on the following day, and Macquarie assumed the
administration.</p>
<p>Macquarie's government was commenced under the most favourable
auspices. For the first time, the governor-in-chief held in his own
hands the executive command of the colony and the military command
of the troops. By this means the old antagonism between the
executive and military powers was modified. This antagonism had
been the principal factor in causing unrest and discontent in the
colony since the days of Governor Phillip.</p>
<p>He carried with him orders for the recall of the New South Wales
Corps. This regiment and its partisans had become the dominant
factor in the colony, and its influence had been usually
detrimental to the general interests. Its officers constituted the
majority in the criminal courts. All ranks had been permitted to
indulge in trade, and many of its officers had acquired
considerable wealth by traffic in land and spirits. During two
periods, 1793-1795 and 1808-1809, its officers had held the
executive power, and had exercised it almost entirely in the
personal interests of themselves and their partisans. The mere fact
of being the dominant party during a term of nearly twenty years
had given the leaders of the regiment their enormous influence. By
the recall of the regiment, this power was broken.</p>
<p>John Macarthur had sailed for England in the <i>Admiral
Gambier.</i> He had been the most turbulent individual opponent of
the executive power. His adverse influence was recognised in
England, and his return to the colony was prohibited by the
secretary of state until September, 1817.</p>
<p>The English government realised that a change in the form of the
administration was necessary. The system based on the fundamental
principles of a military occupation was no longer tenable, and it
was necessary to formulate a new constitution, giving extended
powers and rights to the civil community. Macquarie carried
instructions to examine and report on the necessity for a
re-constitution of the law courts. Further, the English government
was ready to commence reforms and acted promptly on the report of
the select committee of the House of Commons and on Macquarie's
reports in many instances.</p>
<p>The small settlers, the emancipists, and the expirees were
beginning to assert their rights, and the removal of the dominance
of the military enabled Macquarie to do some justice to this
class.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, Macquarie commenced his
administration. He was energetic, and did not spare himself in his
desire to obtain a personal knowledge of the country, as is shown
by his two visits to Tasmania and his various tours of inspection
in New South Wales. He was far-seeing in so far as he recognised
the future possibilities of the colony. His administration was
vigorous, but was marred by an ill-regulated judgment. He created
the first Australian "boom" by the lavish expenditure of public
money, which was followed by the inevitable reaction after his
departure.</p>
<p>Macquarie's far-sighted policy had two main objects&mdash;the
material development of the country, and the reinstatement of the
emancipists and expirees to a position in the civil life of the
colony. But in the pursuit of both these objects, he showed the
want of a well-balanced judgment.</p>
<p>He developed the country by encouraging exploration, by
improving the means of communication, and by the laying out of
towns. His encouragement of exploration has had far-reaching
effects. He sent G.W. Evans and John Oxley on expeditions, which
opened up the western watershed of New South Wales; but the credit
due to him for these results was diminished by his extraordinary
neglect in making due acknowledgment to G. Blaxland, W. Lawson, and
W. C. Wentworth for their strenuous exertions in a private capacity
in discovering the practicable route across the Blue Mountains. The
improvement of the means of communication was a much-needed labour,
which had been greatly neglected by his predecessors. Macquarie
constructed roads in all the settled districts, and made the
western districts accessible, soon after they were discovered, by
making a road across the mountains. These roads proved an
incalculable boon to the colonists. He selected sites for towns and
laid them out according to well-considered plans, but in the
development of these towns his judgment failed him. It was
impossible to foresee the requirements of any town, and the
erection of large and substantial buildings, before the necessity
for such buildings was evident, was a distinct error of judgment.
Commissioner J. T. Bigge, in his report to the House of Commons on
the state of New South Wales, stated, "It has been his
(Macquarie's) misfortune to mistake the improvement and
embellishment of the towns for proofs of the solid prosperity of
the colonists, and to forget that the labour, by which these
objects have been procured, was a source of heavy expense to the
British Treasury, and that other means of employment might have
been tried and resorted to, the effect of which would have been to
regulate in a cheaper and less ostentatious form the progress of
colonization and of punishment." Macquarie erected more than two
hundred buildings for public purposes in the colony, many of which
bore the inscription "L. Macquarie, Esq., Governor". This
inscription was generally so conspicuous that it seemed to imply a
personal vanity and a desire on the part of the governor to
perpetuate his name. Many of the buildings were of doubtful
utility, and were built in anticipation of the expected growth of a
town, which in several cases did not grow. It is certain that
Macquarie wasted a large amount of convict labour on these
buildings, instead of employing it in the formation of agricultural
settlements in various parts of the colony, which would have
conferred a permanent and lasting benefit. In fact, Macquarie
devoted his attentions chiefly to the material and visible
improvement of the colony,* and practically left the development of
its primary industries and the pioneering experimental work to
individuals undirected by the fostering care of government.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Governor Macquarie formed only two penal
agricultural settlements, one at Emu Plains and one at Port
Macquarie.]</p>
<p>Prior to Macquarie's arrival, the dominance of the military
party had been complete, and this party had made every endeavour to
prevent the intrusion of the class of emancipists and expirees into
the respectable walks of life. With the downfall of the military
party, this class had asserted their claims, and Macquarie was far
too just to refuse to restore to their former rank in society those
who had been convicted of trivial offences, and whose subsequent
good conduct had been unquestionable. Macquarie quickly realised
the justice of the claims of the emancipists and expirees, and
commenced to forward their interests with all his powers. The
adoption of this policy was approved by Earl Bathurst** and by the
select committee of the House of Commons. Macquarie, having decided
on the policy, made serious errors in giving effect to it. In an
arbitrary manner, he endeavoured to force the society of certain
emancipists, whom he had selected for special favour, on persons
who were resentful of the intrusion. He made four appointments of
ex-convicts to the magistracy. He endeavoured to force the
judge-advocate and judge to grant permission to ex-convicts to
practise as attorneys before the governor's and supreme courts.
Both of these administrative acts met with the disapproval of the
secretary of state. He attempted to introduce to general society
several ex-convicts, whom he had selected for preferment, but he
failed entirely in this object. The general result of Macquarie's
policy with regard to the emancipists and expirees was to widen the
breach between them and the inhabitants who had arrived free in the
colony.***</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>See</i> page 134 (volume
VIII.)]&nbsp;&nbsp;[*** <i>See</i> introduction to volume IX. (PART
II.)]</p>
<p>Macquarie's character was in many ways contradictory. He was
honest and straightforward in all his administrative acts, yet on
two occasions at least he neglected to make conscientious reports
to the secretary of state, viz., when the crossing of the Blue
Mountains was successfully accomplished by G. Blaxland, W. Lawson,
and W. C. Wentworth, and when he had been compelled to grant
compensation to the contractors erecting the general hospital for
breaches of contract committed by himself.* He was courteous and
politic, yet he was intolerant of opposition. He was punctilious in
his own conduct, demanding similar conduct in others, and resenting
keenly any actual or imaginary slight, such as the neglect of the
judge-advocate to stand on the governor's entry into church. He was
pompous, ambitious, and fond of ostentation and display. He was a
man of great decision of character and of good understanding. But
in action his judgment was ill-balanced, and he was inclined to
take hasty action and to push matters to extremes. He was strictly
honourable, and no imputations of self-interested motives were
alleged against his administration, such as had been made against
his immediate predecessors. He was a good husband, and a
God-fearing man, and the motto of his family, "<i>Turris fortis
mihi deus</i>", was typical of the motives which actuated his life
and administration.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> note 66. (volume VIII.)]</p>
<p>During his government of the colony, he received military
promotion. On the 5th of July, 1810, he was made colonel, on the
21st of February, 1811, brigadier-general, and on the 4th of June,
1813, major-general.</p>
<p>It was not unnatural that the vigorous administration of
Governor Macquarie caused considerable opposition. Representations
adverse to his government were made to the secretary of state. At
first these reports had little effect, but they increased in
virulence and force. During the year 1817, Earl Bathurst criticised
severely the administration of the colony in four despatches to the
governor. After these comments were received, Macquarie tendered
his resignation in a despatch dated 1st December, 1817, but no
immediate action was taken. On the 27th of December, 1818, the
Honourable H. Grey Bennet, M.P., wrote a letter which was published
in pamphlet form. In this letter, Macquarie's conduct was
criticised and condemned. At length, the English government decided
to take action, and John Thomas Bigge was appointed a commissioner,
and received instructions, dated 6th January, 1819, to inquire into
the general state of the colony. But before Bigge had presented his
report on the 6th of May, 1822, Macquarie had been recalled, and
major-general Sir Thomas Brisbane, K.C.B., had arrived in the
colony, and superseded Macquarie in the government on the 1st of
December, 1821. Macquarie was loath to leave the scenes where he
had ruled as a virtual dictator for eleven years and eleven months.
For several weeks, he made a progress through the settled
districts, and received almost universal expressions of regret for
his approaching departure. At the instance of D'Arcy Wentworth, the
principal surgeon, and John Piper, the naval officer, he was
presented with a gold cup of the value of one hundred and fifty
guineas, subscribed by the colonists. He sailed from the colony in
February, 1822, and two years after his arrival in London he died
at Duke-street, St. James, on the 1st of July, 1824. He was buried
in a mausoleum on the island of Mull. He had one son, who died
without issue.</p>

<p><small>GOVERNOR MACQUARIE</small> administered the government of
New South Wales for eleven years and eleven months (1810-1821).
During this period the growth and development of the colony was
extraordinary. In 1810 settlement was practically confined within
the boundaries of the county of Cumberland, exclusive of the
settlements at Newcastle, at Norfolk island, and in Tasmania. In
1821 settlement had been extended in the west beyond Bathurst, in
the south to the districts of Illawarra and Argyle, and in the
north in various localities as far as Port Macquarie. The
population had increased from 11,950 in March, 1810, to 38,778 in
October, 1821, both inclusive of the military. Between the same
dates, the cattle had increased from 12,442 to 102,939, sheep from
35,888 to 290,158, horses from 1,134 to 4,564. In 1810 the port
duties collected at Port Jackson did not exceed £8,000; at the end
of Macquarie's administration they amounted to between £28,000 and
£30,000 per annum. During this period, methods and ideas had to be
adapted to the altered conditions; the voice of public opinion
asserted itself; the English government was compelled to listen to
the desires and to consult the interests of a rapidly increasing
class of colonists, who had made their homes and had acquired
vested interests in the colony; and no longer was the English
government enabled to regard the colony simply as the receptacle
for the undesirables from other parts of the British empire.</p>
<p>Prior to the arrival of Macquarie, there had been virtually two
paramount powers in the colony, the governor and the military
party. The governor had been endowed with almost unlimited powers
by his commission and by colonial customs and precedents. The
military party, consisting of the New South Wales Corps and its
adherents, had acquired a dominant interest by long residence in
the colony, by the binding power of common interests, and from the
fact that its members had naturally gained prestige in a community
consisting of persons most of whom were or had been under the
sentence of the law. The antagonism and jealousy that were only to
be expected between the two paramount powers had in many cases been
prejudicial to the interests of the colony; but at the same time
the military party had acted as a check on the exercise of too
great arbitrariness by a governor, notably during the
administration of Governor King.</p>
<p>When he arrived in the colony, Macquarie was accompanied by the
73rd regiment, and carried orders for the recall of the New South
Wales Corps. By the removal of this corps, Macquarie was left a
clear field for the introduction of a well-considered system for
the development of the colony, as there was no longer an organised
body to thwart the measures of the governor. For many years he
possessed the unqualified confidence and unstinted support of the
English government; when he experienced difficulty with a regiment,
the regiment was removed; when he was involved in a quarrel with
the judge-advocate and judge, orders were given promptly for the
recall of both. He had an almost unlimited supply of convict labour
at his disposal. He had the control of the public purse, and,
although his lavish expenditure was constantly the subject of
criticism by the secretary of state, no active measures were taken
to limit it by the English government. His powers were enormous.
The validity of the colonial custom of issuing government and
general orders was not challenged until some years after his
arrival, and even after they were questioned their promulgation was
continued. By these orders, the governor could control trade, could
impose customs duties, could inflict penalties, and generally could
pass enactments which had all the force of law. His influence over
the individual in all classes was likewise large owing to his
powers of preferment, as he could make land grants, give various
indulgences, assign useful or useless servants to settlers, grant
pardons, and remit sentences.</p>
<p>When he arrived in the colony, Macquarie found that the rule of
a governor was virtually, to quote the words of J. H. Bent,
"<i>quod gubernatori placet, legis habet vigorem</i>". This maxim
probably pleased Macquarie's vanity, and he endeavoured to maintain
it throughout his lengthy administration. In the early years,
whilst his attention was devoted chiefly to the material
development of the colony in the construction of roads and the
erection of necessary public buildings, the unfettered decision of
the governor was of great value. But later, when it was necessary
to develop the social, judicial, and economic fabrics of the
colony, the obsession of this maxim led Macquarie into serious
blunders, such as his actions with regard to emancipists, his
attempts to control the law courts, his flogging of free persons
without any magisterial inquiry, his court martial of the Reverend
Benjamin Vale, and his granting of a charter to the bank of New
South Wales.</p>
<p>When he arrived in the colony, Macquarie found the
administration in a state of chaos owing to the deposition of
Governor Bligh; the public works neglected; the emancipists and
free settlers dissatisfied; the system of public credit
disorganised; a rising feeling against the judicial administration;
and the convict system ill regulated. He found the colony rapidly
emerging from infancy to adolescence, and, in fact, he found it
necessary to re-create the administrative, social, economic, and
judicial frameworks of the colony. Although he had the experience
of the previous twenty-two years to assist him in framing his
systems, and an undaunted personal determination, it is probable
that his ill-balanced judgment prevented his personal influence
from achieving any substantial improvement except the purely
material development of the colony, and the initiation of a
financial and economic system.</p>
<p>He commenced his government by revoking all the acts of the
insurrectionary administrators and by reinstating the officials who
had been in office at the time of the arrest of Governor Bligh.
Subsequently, in accordance with the discretionary power given to
him by the secretary of state, he confirmed* most of the land
grants and pardons so revoked. His public works policy has been
already discussed,** and it is necessary first to consider what
might be called his social policy, as it had considerable influence
over his entire administration.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> notes 66 and 99, volume
VII]&nbsp;&nbsp;[** <i>See</i> pages xv and xvi, volume VIII.]</p>
<p>Within a fortnight of his arrival in the colony, Governor
Macquarie had committed himself to a policy for the encouragement
of emancipists and expirees, which depended on the maxim that the
fact of a person having once been a convict was no bar to his
re-admission into society or to his appointment to the higher
judicial and official positions in the colony. Prior to this date
(1810), all persons, with two exceptions, belonging to the
emancipist and expiree classes had been rigidly excluded from
general society. The exceptions were G. B. Bellasis and the
Reverend Henry Fulton; the former, an officer in the East India
Company's service, had been transported for killing his opponent in
a duel, and had held command of the governor's bodyguard under
King; the latter had been sentenced for complicity in the Irish
rebellion, and had acted as chaplain to Governor Bligh and his
household. For twenty-two years a rigid barrier had been raised
between all who had arrived free in the colony and those who had
been landed under a sentence of the law. It is evident therefore
that Macquarie, in adopting this policy, attempted a revolutionary
change in the social conditions of the colony. The policy was
"recommended more by motives of humanity than of reason, and (was)
as new as it was hazardous."*** It caused a storm of opposition,
which was due not so much to the humanitarian principle involved,
as to Macquarie's methods of attempting to procure its general
acceptance.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>See</i> first report by J. T. Bigge, page
83.)]</p>
<p>Governor Macquarie assumed the administration on the 1st of
January, 1810, and eleven days later he appointed Andrew Thompson,
an ex-convict, as a magistrate at the Hawkesbury. With little
practical knowledge of the colonial conditions, and without any
attempt to educate public opinion up to the change in the social
system that was thereby initiated, Macquarie took the drastic step
of giving to an ex-convict the highest distinction which he had in
his power to bestow. Thompson had been transported in 1790 for
setting fire to a stack, when in his seventeenth year. When his
sentence had expired, he had settled at the Green Hills (Windsor),
had engaged in business as a retail shopkeeper, and had built small
vessels, with which he traded to Sydney. He had been remarkably
successful in amassing wealth, and, when Macquarie arrived,
lieutenant-colonel Foveaux recommended him "as an individual and an
active and intelligent chief constable". Macquarie stated that his
reasons for making the appointment were Thompson's loyalty to the
cause of Governor Bligh, the scarcity of men at the Hawkesbury
eligible for the magistracy, and a desire to restore Thompson to
that rank in society which he had lost. These reasons are of little
value, when it is remembered that Macquarie could have selected the
officer in military command at Windsor for the magisterial duties,
and that, as Thompson's rank in society before his conviction had
been exceedingly humble, his elevation to the bench of magistrates,
instead of restoring him to an equal rank, raised him to a higher
one. But in making the appointment Macquarie forgot that "some
consideration was surely due to the feelings of those magistrates,
as well as that society, who, with the knowledge they possessed of
his (Thompson's) recent situation, could not but regard the
unsolicited return of this lost member to his rank and place
amongst them as a degradation of their own."* This appointment and
a similar one given to another ex-convict, Simeon Lord, on the 3rd
of August, 1810, brought forth a strong protest from the Reverend
Samuel Marsden, on account of the character of the persons
appointed; and, when Macquarie, about the same time, attempted to
associate Marsden with Lord and Thompson as trustees of the public
roads, he was met with Marsden's prompt refusal to accept such
office with the co-trustees nominated.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> first report of J. T. Bigge, page
82.]</p>
<p>Macquarie's new policy and his appointments to the magistracy
met with universal criticism. Macquarie, however, was extremely
intolerant of opposition, and it is probable that this intolerance
and an ill-balanced judgment led him to make serious mistakes in
the elaboration and execution of a policy, which on calmer
consideration he would have perhaps avoided. The humanitarian
principle of his policy was generally recognised and accepted; it
was approved by the secretary of state,** and endorsed by a select
committee of the House of Commons in 1812. But although the
principle was correct, it is extremely doubtful whether the time
had then arrived for its promulgation; and Macquarie's first
attempts to raise members of an excluded class to the highest
positions in the land, and to introduce them to the most exclusive
class at that period, the military, were too revolutionary to
succeed. Macquarie was also singularly unfortunate in his choice of
the individuals for preferment.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>See</i> page 134, volume VIII.]</p>
<p>After the elevation of Thompson and Lord to the magistracy, they
were introduced to the society of government house, and were
invited to the mess of the 73rd regiment; but their social
advancement was not effected. Macquarie failed to realise that his
patronage alone could not secure the general acceptance of an
individual, and that men whom he chose to invite to his table might
be considered by private individuals unfit associates on account of
their morals and personal character. He made no attempt to
conciliate the opposition to his measure, and failed to recognise
"the evils of resistance in quarters where co-operation was
necessary". In this failure, he materially contributed to the
opposition which developed against his policy and administration in
other spheres.</p>
<p>At an early period, Governor Macquarie selected assistant
surgeon William Redfern for special preference. Redfern had been
transported for complicity in the mutiny at the Nore. He was
possessed of considerable professional abilities, but his manner
was self-assertive and was resented by the class to which Macquarie
attempted to introduce him. He was invited to government house, and
through Macquarie's influence to the mess of the 73rd regiment, and
later to that of the 46th regiment; but this had little effect on
his social status. When the 48th regiment arrived, he was
introduced by Macquarie to its officers, and, in the company of
brigade-major Antill, he called on each of them, but with four
exceptions they refused to return his call. When he was invited to
the mess by lieutenant-colonel Erskine, many of the junior officers
abruptly left the table; to obviate such action in future, Erskine
made it a rule of the mess that no officer should leave the table
until the first thirds were drank.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarie encouraged the presence of five other
ex-convicts at government house. They were the Reverend Henry
Fulton, James Meehan, the deputy surveyor, Richard Fitzgerald, a
superintendent, Michael Robinson, confidential clerk in the
secretary's office, and Francis Howard Greenway, the architect. Of
these, Robinson received special notice of Macquarie's favour. He
had been transported in 1798 for writing a threatening letter to
Mr. James Oldham.* After Macquarie's arrival he was appointed chief
clerk in the office of the governor's secretary, and as such
fulfilled the confidential duty of transcribing the governor's
despatches. On the occasions of the birthdays of their Majesties,
he was invited to government house and permitted to recite to the
assembled company odes of his own composition.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> note 193, volume II.]</p>
<p>The results of Macquarie's endeavours to introduce ex-convicts
into general society were aptly summarised by Mr. Commissioner
Bigge.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>See</i> first report of J. T. Bigge, page
150.]</p>
<p>"The elevation of these persons to a rank in society, which they
never possessed and for which, without meaning any reflection upon
them, their manners gave them no kind of claim, has not been
productive to them of the benefits that were contemplated.</p>
<p>"It was in vain for Governor Macquarie to assemble them, even on
public occasions at government house, or to point them out to the
especial notice and favour of strangers, or to favour them with
particular marks of his own attention upon those occasions, if they
still continued to be shunned or disregarded by the rest of the
company.</p>
<p>"With the exception of the Reverend Mr. Fulton, and, on some
occasions, of Mr. Redfern, I never observed that the other persons
of this class participated in the general attentions of the
company.</p>
<p>"Although the emancipated convicts, whom he has selected from
their class, are persons who generally bear a good character in New
South Wales, yet that opinion of them is by no means universal.
Those however, who entertained a good opinion, would have proved it
by their notice.. .. and those, who entertained a different
opinion, would not have contracted an aversion to the principle of
their introduction from being obliged to witness what they
considered to be an indiscreet and erroneous application of
it."</p>
<p>It is clear that Governor Macquarie's endeavours to introduce
ex-convicts into general society were defeated largely by his own
methods. His attempts to restore them to full civil rights were
only a qualified success. Notwithstanding the criticism of the
appointments of Thompson and Lord to the magistracy, Macquarie made
two further appointments of ex-convicts to the bench, in the
persons of the Reverend Henry Fulton and William Redfern. Of these
four appointments, Mr. Commissioner Bigge reported* that they "were
unnecessary, that they produced no good effect upon the parties
themselves, and that they have lowered the respect and estimation
of the magisterial office." Subsequently Redfern's name was omitted
from the new commission, which Macquarie was directed to issue on
the accession of King George IV; Simeon Lord was allowed to resign
prior to the issue of the new commission, whilst Andrew Thompson
had died nine months after his appointment. Least exception was
taken to the elevation of the Reverend Henry Fulton to the
bench.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> first report of J. T. Bigge, page
89.]</p>
<p>When the new charter was promulgated in 1814, by which new civil
courts were established, Governor Macquarie, in furtherance of his
policy, attempted to force the judge-advocate and judge to adopt
the principle that a previous conviction was no bar to the
admission of an attorney to the practice in the colonial courts.
This led to a bitter controversy** between the governor and the
judge, J. H. Bent. Bent refused to adopt Macquarie's proposals, and
adjourned the sittings of the supreme court until a reference could
be made to England. The secretary of state did not support
Macquarie in his advocacy of this principle, and refused to
sanction its adoption. Nevertheless, Macquarie still continued his
attempt to procure the admission of ex-convicts to an official
position in the courts, and in 1817 appointed Simeon Lord a member
of the supreme court bench, and a little later Richard Fitzgerald a
member of the governor's court which was held at Windsor.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>See</i> page 479 <i>et seq.,</i> volume
VIII.]</p>
<p>In the establishment of the bank of New South Wales and in the
proposed formation of an agricultural society, Governor Macquarie
attempted to secure full rights for ex-convicts. In the formation
of the bank, he desired that all classes should co-operate,
especially as some ex-convicts were among the most opulent in the
colony, and that all classes should be represented in its direction
and management. When the election of directors for the bank was
under consideration, it became known that a conditionally
emancipated convict, Edward Eagar, was to be nominated for office
by William Redfern; whereupon four out of six proposed directors
refused to accept office if Eagar was elected. The subscribers
accordingly made it a rule of the bank that no person was eligible
as a director unless he was absolutely and unconditionally free.
Macquarie had to accept this regulation, and shortly afterwards
soothed Eagar's disappointment by granting him an absolute
pardon.</p>
<p>Macquarie prevented the formation of an agricultural society by
stating his desire that its membership should be open to all
classes of the community. This was impracticable, as it was
probable that ex-convicts would have been excluded under the system
of ballot that was proposed for the election of members.</p>
<p>Macquarie carried his policy of encouraging emancipists to such
extremes that it became proverbial in the colony that "the surest
claim to his favour and confidence was that of having once worn the
badge of conviction for felony."*</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> first report of J. T. Bigge, page
147]</p>
<p>In spite of all Macquarie's efforts, little was achieved in
removing the barrier which was raised around the emancipists and
expirees. Mr. Commissioner Bigge stated that only one instance was
known of the wife of an emancipist being admitted to the society of
the wives of military officers, but he added, "it has generally
been thought that such instances would have been more numerous, if
Governor Macquarie had allowed every person to have followed the
dictates of their own judgment."**</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>See</i> first report of J. T. Bigge, page
150.]</p>
<p>It is probable that Governor Macquarie's emancipist policy was
conceived in haste and elaborated afterwards; that in the year 1810
certain ex-convicts had been emancipated, by servitude or pardon,
for a sufficient period to justify by their subsequent good conduct
their claim for a modification of their rigid exclusion from the
respectable walks of life; that this class began to assert its
claims, when encouraged by Macquarie's appointment of one of their
number to the magistracy; that Macquarie recognised the justice in
part of these claims; that he utterly failed in achieving his
object owing to the ill-advised methods he adopted, although he won
the gratitude of the large class he had befriended; and that the
net result was exasperation and disappointment to the entire class
of emancipists and expirees.</p>
<p>In fact, Macquarie's policy did more harm than good, and had the
effect of strengthening instead of removing the barrier between the
two classes, the free population and the emancipists and expirees.
J. T. Bigge, in 1822, reported that the prejudices of the free
population were then "too deeply fixed to be removed; and the
ambitious feelings of the higher classes of emancipated convicts
have been too long encouraged and cherished to expect from them
either submission or conciliation. Governor Macquarie has thus left
to his successor the difficult and, I may even add, the hopeless
task of bringing back, to their proper and just standard, the
pretensions of two large classes of the inhabitants of New South
Wales, without giving to the one party a supposed ground of
triumph, and without inflicting upon the other too large a measure
of vexation and disgrace."*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Ibid., page 154.]</p>
<p>Macquarie's treatment of the free settlers and his interference
with social activities were arbitrary and non-conciliatory. At an
early date he conceived a dislike for the settlers from England,
who had arrived free, and he developed a decided preference for
settlers from the emancipist class.** Macquarie had some justice in
criticising adversely some of the free settlers, as a large number
were of a poor type, and had come to the colony in the hope of
bettering themselves after they had failed in England. On the other
hand, such good settlers as did arrive found it difficult to obtain
the labour necessary for farming pursuits. Macquarie's passion for
the erection of public buildings absorbed the best labourers
amongst the convicts, and, when the settlers applied for assigned
labour, it was practically impossible to obtain builders,
blacksmiths or other mechanics, who would be useful on their farms.
The free settlers experienced also many difficulties from
Macquarie's intolerance of opposition and from his sympathies with
the class of emancipists.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>See</i> page 598, volume VII.]</p>
<p>Three instances may be quoted of the governor's arbitrary
treatment of free persons.</p>
<p>In the year 1816, a memorial from a number of colonists was
transmitted to the House of Commons, which represented certain
grievances* against the administration of Macquarie. The governor
thereupon took the severe step of refusing all land grants and
indulgences to the alleged signatories. For this action he was
severely censured by Earl Bathurst,** who stated that it had a
tendency to check the undoubted right of a subject to petition
parliament. Macquarie, in his defence,*** stated that the petition
contained malicious representations, and he was justified in
withholding indulgences from those "who dared to asperse my
personal honor and Government". This was typical of Macquarie's
attitude on many occasions, for he was frequently unable to
perceive that the person criticised often cannot gauge the value of
the criticism, and that an attempt to expose the abuse of authority
by himself was not an act of sedition on the part of the
complainant.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 329 <i>et seq.</i> and page 732
<i>et seq.</i>] &nbsp;&nbsp;[** <i>See</i> page
762.]&nbsp;&nbsp;[*** <i>See</i> despatch marked "No. 1 of 1819",
dated 1st March, 1819.] (all volume IX.)</p>
<p>In the year 1816, Philip Connor, who had been a lieutenant in
the 73rd regiment, and had been convicted of manslaughter,****
returned to the colony for the purposes of marriage. Macquarie had
not approved of the lenient verdict given by the criminal court in
Connor's case, and rightly considered Connor an undesirable
immigrant. He accordingly compelled him to enter into a bond to
leave the colony by the ship in which he arrived. As this ship
sailed before the ordinary banns of marriage could be published,
Connor was prevented from fulfilling his marriage contract, as
Macquarie refused to grant a special license.</p>
<p class="foot">[**** <i>See</i> page 7 <i>et seq.,</i> volume
VIII.]</p>
<p>In the year 1816 also, Macquarie ordered the corporal
punishment* of two ex-convicts and one free immigrant for trespass
on the government domain at Sydney. These punishments were
inflicted merely on the reports of constables and without any
magisterial inquiry, and were a deliberate breach of the civil
rights of the subject.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 734 <i>et seq.</i> and note 162.
(volume IX.)]</p>
<p>When reports of these occurrences and of Macquarie's preference
for emancipists reached England, it is little wonder that the
better type of free settlers was disinclined to go to the colony;
and the free settlers already in the colony might be afraid of
being subjected to an arbitrary act of the governor. It is certain
that Macquarie's influence had a decided effect, and towards the
close of his government free immigration was somewhat
restricted.</p>
<p>The policy of Governor Macquarie with regard to the financial
and economic affairs of the colony was good, and materially
assisted in its advancement.</p>
<p>The powers of the governor over trade and commerce were supreme.
By the colonial custom of issuing general orders, he could regulate
the currency; establish specie values; fix the rate of interest,
the prices of commodities, and the rates of wages; impose export
and import duties; and control monopolies.</p>
<p>When Macquarie arrived in the colony, there was no legalised
currency or specie, and the internal trade suffered from the want
of a proper medium of exchange. The internal trade of the colony
depended chiefly on the demand of government for supplies of grain
and meat. When these were lodged in the public stores, store
receipts were issued, which were consolidated at stated periods by
bills on the English treasury. These bills were eagerly sought by
merchants and others, who were desirous of making remittances to
England. Prior to consolidation, the store receipts passed from
hand to hand as the equivalent of money in the ordinary course of
business. Their use, however, brought disadvantages to the small
settler. Owing to the want of small change, he was compelled to
lodge his receipt with the retail storekeeper or publican for
purchases made, and, until the value of the receipt was exhausted,
it induced improvidence and extravagance on the part of the
settler. To obviate the want of small change, it had become the
practice to issue small notes of hand for sums as low as
threepence. So long as the issue of these notes was made by persons
of probity, no evils were experienced; but the ease with which
these notes were placed in circulation induced many to take
pecuniary advantage of the system. The methods of effecting this
were described by Macquarie in a despatch to Earl Bathurst.*
Macquarie quickly realised the evil influences on the colonial
trade of the want of a legalised circulating medium. On the 30th of
June, 1810, he issued a proclamation,** regulating the issue of
currency notes, and in his third despatch in 1810,*** he sought
permission to establish a government loan bank with the power to
issue notes. This proposal was not entertained by the committee of
the privy council for trade and plantations, but at the same time
it was decided to send £10,000 worth of dollars to the colony to
alleviate the distress caused by the want of currency. When these
dollars were received by Macquarie in 1812, he decided to partially
re-mint them, and to make a specie peculiar to the colony, in order
to conserve it for local use. Each dollar, worth five shillings,
was converted**** into a "holey dollar" and a "dump" with colonial
values of five shillings and one shilling and threepence
respectively. These coins were put in circulation in the year 1814
through the agency of the commissariat department,***** and
considerably relieved the specie difficulty.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 216. (volume
IX.)]&nbsp;&nbsp;[**<i>See</i> note 54. (volume
IX.)]&nbsp;&nbsp;[*** <i>See</i> page 265, volume
VII.]&nbsp;&nbsp;[**** <i>See</i> page 750 <i>et seq.,</i> volume
VII.]&nbsp;&nbsp;[***** <i>See</i> page 333, volume VIII.]</p>
<p>The advantages of a sterling standard for all commercial
transactions were, however, imperfectly attained, and towards the
end of the year 1816 the growth of trade made this want more acute.
In consequence, Macquarie caused a public meeting to be held,
whereat it was decided to establish a bank,* subject to the
governor's approval, with a capital of £20,000. Macquarie readily
gave his sanction to the proposal, and granted the shareholders a
charter of incorporation. It is typical of the change in
Macquarie's character that, whereas in 1810 he had sought the
permission of the English government to establish a bank, in 1817
he granted a charter for the formation of a bank and sought
confirmation of it afterwards. This charter was held to be null and
void by the English crown law officers, and Macquarie was informed
that he had no power to grant such a charter.** Notwithstanding the
illegality of the incorporation, the formation of the bank of New
South Wales under Macquarie's sanction formed a prominent milestone
in the financial history of the colony. The bank issued notes of
value from two shillings and sixpence upwards, payable in sterling
on demand, and these notes practically initiated a sterling
circulation in the colony.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 219 <i>et
seq.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;[** <i>See</i> page 840.] (Both volume X.)</p>
<p>The unlimited control exercised by a governor over finance and
trade is well exemplified in the fixation of rates of interest.
Governor King, by an ordinance in July, 1804, had fixed the legal
rate at £8 sterling per centum per annum. Notwithstanding the
variations in the value of money, it had remained at that arbitrary
rate until February, 1817, when, at the request of the directors of
the bank of New South Wales, Governor Macquarie increased it to £10
per centum.</p>
<p>Throughout most of his administration, Macquarie maintained the
practice of fixing the prices of commodities necessary to support
life. As already noted, the internal trade of the colony depended
largely on the purchases of wheat and meat made by government. As
long as the government was the chief purchaser, the fixation of the
price of wheat had many advantages. It enabled the farmer to
anticipate his return with some confidence. If the government had
not fixed the price, in years of abundant harvest the price of
wheat would have fallen so low that it would not pay the farmer to
grow it. In consequence, in the year following, little ground would
be cultivated, and then, the harvest being small, the price of
wheat would be increased enormously. In spite of much opposition,
Macquarie maintained fixed prices for wheat. At the same time, he
strongly advocated the establishment of a distillery, protected by
a preferential duty on the spirits distilled, in order that a
market might be created for the surplus crop of grain after the
demands of government were satisfied.</p>
<p>Prior to Macquarie's arrival, the evils of monopoly had been
rampant. These evils had been most in evidence in the spirit trade,
and had been the cause of considerable difficulty to former
governors. Macquarie had received specific instructions from the
secretary of state to suppress the traffic in spirits, and to
prohibit their use as a medium of barter for produce and the
necessaries of life. Shortly after his arrival, he had practically
attained this end by the imposition of an import duty of three
shillings per gallon, and by requiring all importers to receive a
permit for each individual speculation in spirits prior to landing
the same in the colony. These regulations had practically
controlled the spirit traffic; but, nevertheless, about ten months
after his arrival in the colony, Macquarie granted a huge monopoly*
in spirits to the contractors for the erection of the general
hospital. This remarkable action was severely criticised by the
secretary of state,** and seems incapable of any justification.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 401 <i>et seq.,</i> volume VII,
and note 66, volume VIII.]&nbsp;&nbsp;[** <i>See</i> page 486,
volume VII.]</p>
<p>Macquarie was, however, successful in coping with attempted
monopolies in the necessaries of life. He prevented a monopoly in
grain by means of importations from Bengal; he utilised the
government herds of cattle to defeat a monopoly in meat; and in
September, 1812, he issued a striking proclamation*** strongly
condemning any attempts to secure the artificial inflation of
prices.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>See</i> note 130, volume VII.]</p>
<p>In December, 1814, Macquarie abolished**** the retail sale of
goods from the government stores. This practice had been
established in the year 1800 to protect the settlers against
extortions in their purchases of the smaller articles of
merchandize; but Macquarie found that it was no longer necessary
owing to the arrival of frequent shipments of goods and to the
competition amongst the traders. At the same time, Macquarie opened
all the ports in the territory to the unrestricted importation of
spirits and merchandize.</p>
<p class="foot">[**** <i>See</i> page 471, volume VIII.]</p>
<p>Throughout his administration, Macquarie was lavish in the
expenditure of public money. As the larger part of this was met by
drafts on the English treasury, a considerable sum of money was
introduced into the colony. The average aggregate amount of bills
drawn during the four years (1806-1809) preceding Macquarie's
arrival was £29,415. In 1810 Macquarie drew £72,600, in the first
ten weeks of 1811 £21,214, and in subsequent years his expenditure
rapidly increased, out of proportion to the increase of the
population. The circulation of this money caused a "boom", and led
to a false and superficial prosperity. Macquarie claimed credit for
this prosperity, but, unfortunately for such claim, the "boom" was
followed by the inevitable depression after his departure.</p>
<p>Macquarie made every effort to encourage trade and commerce. An
example of this may be quoted. In 1813 he had enacted a schedule of
import duties* on certain articles which were the produce of the
south seas. A few years' experience of their incidence convinced
him that they were a source of injury to the trade, and in 1817 he
proposed** that a draw-back of these duties should be allowed on
such articles that were re-exported.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 749, volume VII.]&nbsp;&nbsp;[**
<i>See</i> page 401. (volume IX.)]</p>
<p>In one instance in connection with trade Macquarie showed a
remarkable hastiness of disposition, and his intolerance of
opposition led him to commit a serious error. After the declaration
of peace with America, the resumption of American trading at Port
Jackson was expected. In February, 1816, the American schooner
<i>Traveller</i> arrived from Canton, freighted with tea and
merchandize, which were at the time much in request at Sydney.
Macquarie granted the schooner liberty of entry. Shortly afterwards
she was seized under the provisions of the navigation act by the
Reverend Benjamin Vale, one of the chaplains on the colonial staff.
When Macquarie heard of this he at once released the schooner from
arrest. He then preferred charges against Vale, and had him brought
to trial by court martial,*** which sentenced Vale to be "publicly
and severely reprimanded and admonished". Such action was quite
illegal, and in consequence Macquarie was severely censured by Earl
Bathurst.****</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>See</i> page 100.]&nbsp;&nbsp;[****
<i>See</i> page 206.] (Both volume IX.)</p>
<p>Macquarie's influence on finance, trade, and commerce materially
contributed to the advancement of the colony. He created a "boom",
which had certain advantages, although followed by the inevitable
depression. He developed a system of public credit. He abolished
some restrictions on trade and drew attention to others. Excepting
his mistakes in conniving at a monopoly in spirits in 1810, and in
the wrongful issue of a charter to the bank, his influence over
finance and commerce was excellent.</p>
<p>Macquarie's character was many-sided, and this is strikingly
demonstrated in his relations with the individuals over whom he
more or less had control. He showed an extraordinary kindness of
heart and even an excessive leniency to those who were incompetent
or had committed errors, provided that they had in no manner
clashed with his own principles. On the other hand, he was unjust
and even vindictive, probably owing to his intolerance of
opposition and his natural hastiness of disposition, when an
individual came into conflict with him.</p>
<p>Examples of his kindness may be quoted. In March, 1816,
Macquarie reported* that he had found it necessary to remove
surgeon Mountgarrett from the magistracy for improper conduct, and
at the same time recommended his retirement from the position of
surgeon on account of the loss of an arm. In the same despatch he
severely criticised the conduct and capacity of surgeon Luttrell,
and recommended his removal. Yet, in spite of such adverse reports,
Macquarie proposed that pensions should be granted to both
officers. The pensions were refused at first by the secretary of
state, in consequence of Macquarie's reports, but on a second
application were granted. His action with regard to a pension for
Mrs. Eliza Bent was very similar.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 67. (volume IX.)]</p>
<p>His vindictiveness was shown on several occasions. One has
already been noted, viz., his withdrawal of land grants and
indulgences from the alleged signatories to a petition of
grievances to the House of Commons.** His treatment of the Reverend
Samuel Marsden was remarkable. At an early date the opinions of the
latter had clashed with his own. Marsden had adversely commented on
the appointments of Thompson and Lord to the magistracy. In the
month of February, 1814. Macquarie and Marsden were again in
conflict, owing to the refusal of the latter to read a general
order in church. It had been customary to announce many general
orders, relating to a variety of subjects, during divine service.
As Marsden was largely engaged in farming pursuits, it is possible
that his refusal to read this order,*** which related to the supply
of grain to the public stores, was due to a personal interest. A
difference of opinion also arose over Marsden's attempted
introduction of low-church doctrines. In 1817 Earl Bathurst
transmitted an extract**** of a letter containing charges against
Macquarie's administration, without disclosing the author's name.
The governor wrongfully assumed that the letter was written by
Marsden, and in his reply to Earl Bathurst made an attack***** upon
him. At the same time, in a confidential despatch, Macquarie
transmitted a list,****** which included Marsden's name, of twelve
persons, whose dispositions he variously described as discontented,
intriguing, vindictive, or seditious towards the colonial
administration. Prior to this date, in spite of previous
differences, there had been a certain amount of friendship between
the governor and the chaplain; but, subsequently, Macquarie
conceived the idea that whilst professing friendship Marsden was
making secret attacks on him. The relations between the two became
strained, and finally Macquarie took the grave step of taxing
Marsden, in the presence of others, with the crimes of sedition and
mutiny. The charge of sedition was based on the fact that Marsden
had taken a deposition from the public flogger, relating to the
corporal punishments******* ordered by Macquarie for trespass on
the government domain at Sydney. These punishments were grossly
illegal, and, as J. T. Bigge reported,* it was probable, "from a
consciousness, perhaps, ... that he was without defence, Governor
Macquarie from one error only fell into another" in making this
charge against Marsden. The charge of mutiny was based on Marsden's
refusal, some years before, to be associated with the ex-convicts,
Andrew Thompson and Simeon Lord, and his objection to the principle
that ex-convicts should be admitted to general society. At the
interview with the governor, Marsden declared that he would no
longer act as a magistrate, a position which, by reason of his long
residence in the colony, he was probably the most qualified to
hold. He did not, however, give immediate effect to his resolution,
but in March, 1818, he tendered his resignation. Macquarie
thereupon announced in general orders that he "had been pleased to
dispense with the services of the Reverend Samuel Marsden as
justice of the peace and magistrate." As it was Macquarie's
practice to publish an eulogistic statement of the services of a
public officer on his retirement, this bald announcement conveyed
the impression of a real dismissal accompanied by disgrace. It is
evident that Macquarie's conduct towards Marsden was most unjust,
and it is probable that, had he listened to the advice of Marsden,
many of the mistakes of his administration would have been
avoided.</p>

<p align="center"><small>[Historical Records of Australia, Series
1, Vol. X: Introduction]</small></p>
<p><small>IN</small> the introductions to volumes VIII [PART I.]
and IX [PART II.], the most important events in the life of
Governor Macquarie have been noted, and his administration in
matters of trade and finance, and his policy with regard to the
emancipists and the public works of the colony have been
criticised.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to discuss the influence of Macquarie over the
judicial and convict systems, it is necessary to draw attention to
some general factors which had considerable weight during his
administration.</p>
<p>In the first place, the colony had been founded on the principle
of a military occupation, in which the governor was supreme. The
court of criminal jurisdiction had been established with a marked
similarity to a military court martial. The presiding officer was
called the judge-advocate, and the members of the court were
officers holding naval or military commissions. Even when the new
charter was promulgated in 1814, it was considered advisable to
maintain the title of judge-advocate in order to preserve a
semblance of military domination.* Such a constitution had been
fairly satisfactory in the early days, but as, during the Macquarie
era, the non-convict population increased and legal criticism
became available, it was a source of much dissatisfaction, with
which Macquarie was little suited to cope.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> note 27, volume IX.]</p>
<p>Secondly, before Macquarie's arrival, there had been no
opportunity of obtaining good legal opinions in the colony, and
illegal practices had grown up. During his government, Macquarie's
actions were subjected to the criticism of educated lawyers, such
as the Messrs. Bent, judge-advocate Wylde, and judge Field. Many
practices which had formerly been accepted unchallenged were then
found to be illegal. Macquarie, who had at an early period adopted
the maxim <i>quod gubernatori placet, legis habet vigorem</i>, was
somewhat intolerant of all attempts to place limitations on his
virtual dictatorship. This intolerance was the source of friction
and misunderstandings, as Macquarie was unable to modify his ideas
to meet the finer points of the legal mind. It was also the origin
of his dispute** with judge-advocate Bent with regard to the port
regulations. Macquarie was more tolerant, when, in 1818, judge
Field questioned*** the right of the governor to levy duties, on
the ground that "no subject of England can be constrained to pay
any aids or taxes, but such as are imposed by his own consent or
that of his representatives in parliament." This question was
referred to England, and the attorney and solicitor general gave it
as their opinion**** "that, the part of New South Wales, possessed
by His Majesty, not having been acquired by conquest or cession,
but taken possession of by him, as desert and uninhabited, and
subsequently colonized" from England, the King had no right,
through the medium of his governor, to make laws for levying taxes.
This decision struck at the very root of a large part of the
practice of issuing government and general orders.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>See</i> page 394 <i>et seq.,</i> volume
VIII.]&nbsp;&nbsp;[*** <i>See</i> page 774, volume
IX.]&nbsp;&nbsp;[**** <i>See</i> note 45 (volume X.)]</p>
<p>Thirdly, during Macquarie's government, the standard of public
morality was at a low ebb. A salaried solicitor of the crown, W. H.
Moore, did not think it derogatory to write* to the governor a
statement, which was intended to convey the impression that he had
virtually forged his brother's signature;** and this action was
taken entirely to obtain some personal benefits. The secretary to
the governor, J. T. Campbell, did not consider it dishonourable to
make use of his official position as censor of the <i>Sydney
Gazette</i> in order to publish a libel on the Reverend Samuel
Marsden, for which he was tried and mulcted in damages;*** even
after the trial he aggravated his offence by permitting to be
published, or perhaps actually by publishing, in the same paper, a
garbled account of the proceedings at the trial. Free settlers did
not hesitate to make misrepresentations with regard to their
financial positions in order to obtain larger land grants than they
were entitled to receive. A few months after Macquarie's departure,
judge-advocate Wylde and judge Field gave evidence of similar
elasticity of conscience when they united in supporting the illegal
actions of the bench of magistrates at Parramatta in the case of
Henry Grattan Douglass.****</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 331, volume IX.]&nbsp;&nbsp;[**
<i>See</i> note 111, volume IX.]&nbsp;&nbsp;[*** <i>See</i> note
175, volume IX, and page 443 <i>et seq.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;[****
<i>See</i> page 763. (volume X.)]</p>
<p>It is clear therefore that Macquarie occupied a difficult
position, and was confronted with many intricate problems in
maintaining the balance of justice. But his ill-regulated judgment
caused him to commit many errors in his relations with the judicial
system.</p>
<p>When Governor Macquarie arrived in the colony, justice was
administered in accordance with the letters patent* establishing
the courts of law, dated 2nd April, 1787. The civil law was
administered by the court of civil jurisdiction, which consisted of
the judge-advocate, appointed by royal commission, and "two fit and
proper persons inhabiting" the territory, <i>appointed by the
governor</i> by separate precept for different sessions. The
nominees of the governor thereby constituted the majority of this
court. From the decisions of this court appeals could be made to
the governor sitting in court of appeal. The administration of the
criminal law was entrusted to the court of criminal jurisdiction,
which consisted of the judge-advocate, appointed by royal
commission, and "six officers of his Majesty's forces by sea or
land", <i>appointed by special precept of the governor</i> for each
session of the court. The governor also had unfettered authority to
appoint and dismiss justices of the peace, who possessed similar
powers and jurisdiction to magistrates in England.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> volume I, series IV.]</p>
<p>On the 12th of August, 1814, new letters patent** were published
in the colony, by which the administration of the civil law was
altered. For the settlements in New South Wales, two courts were
established&mdash;the governor's court and supreme court&mdash;with
separate jurisdictions.*** The governor's court consisted of the
judge-advocate and two fit and proper persons resident in the
territory, <i>appointed by the governor</i> by special precept. The
supreme court was constituted by the judge, appointed by royal
commission, and two magistrates of the territory, <i>appointed by
the governor</i> by precept. Appeals from the decisions of the
supreme court were allowed in certain cases**** to the governor,
assisted by the judge-advocate.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>See</i> volume in series
IV.]&nbsp;&nbsp;[*** <i>See</i> notes 34 and 121, volume
VIII.]&nbsp;&nbsp;[**** <i>See</i> note 154. (volume X.)]</p>
<p>It is clear that the governor possessed great influence by his
power to appoint the majority of the members of the courts, in each
instance for short periods, <i>i.e.,</i> the duration of particular
sittings of each court, and by his unlimited power to appoint and
dismiss justices of the peace. Governor Macquarie never used this
enormous influence to control decisions of the courts in causes
tried; but he attempted to use it to control their procedure, and
thereby to further his emancipist policy.</p>
<p>He appointed four emancipists* to the commission of the peace,
and, on different occasions, he appointed one as a member of the
supreme court and another as a member of the governor's court. Such
actions cannot be justified; for the idea of entrusting a part of
the administration of justice to one who himself had been convicted
of an offence against the laws of his country is repugnant to the
principles of British justice. The appointment of Simeon Lord as a
member of the supreme court was probably the most serious error.
Lord's nomination to the commission of the peace had been adversely
criticised by the secretary of state, and resented by many persons
in the colony. Macquarie himself, at this very time, considered
that Lord's private occupations were derogatory to his position as
a magistrate. These appointments could only have the one result,
namely, the lowering of the dignity and respect of the magistrates
and the law courts in the popular estimation.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page viii <i>et seq.,</i> volume
IX.]</p>
<p>Governor Macquarie also endeavoured to secure to emancipists the
right to practise in the law courts, and, in doing so, he tried to
control the procedure of the courts. Before the year 1814,
emancipists who, before conviction, had received a legal education,
were permitted to practise in the courts, in consequence of the
entire want of properly qualified solicitors in the colony. In
accordance with this custom, at the first sittings of the supreme
court,** commencing on the 1st of May, 1815, petitions for
admission to practice were received from George Crossley, George
Chartres, and Edward Eagar, each of whom had arrived in the colony
under sentence of transportation. Two of the petitioners, Crossley
and Eagar, had practised in the old court of civil jurisdiction;
but their admission to the practice of the supreme court was not
necessary, for two solicitors had been appointed in England for
service in the colony, although at that date one had not arrived in
the colony. When these petitions were received, the judge, J. H.
Bent, held that a person once convicted of felony was for ever
barred from admission to practice in the law courts; the members of
the court, William Broughton and Alexander Riley, the governor's
nominees, were, however, not prepared to adopt this principle as a
rule of the court, and desired to consider each application on its
merits. Before the meeting of the court, two of the petitioners had
made the same request to Governor Macquarie, and he had officially
recommended the plea of the memorials to J. H. Bent, who had stated
in reply that he had strong objection to their admission as
attorneys. The members of the court were aware of Macquarie's
opinion prior to their receiving the petitions, and probably were
influenced by it. On the 15th of May, a rule*** was also adopted by
the governor's court, which refused admission in that court to
emancipists. Governor Macquarie was absent at Bathurst when the
petitions were received by the supreme court. On his return, he
used all his influence to persuade the courts to consent to the
admission of the applicants, but without success, for the
judge-advocate and judge refused all compromise on the principle
they had adopted. In consequence of this dispute, J. H. Bent
adjourned the sittings of the supreme court until an expression of
opinion could be obtained from the secretary of state. In his
reply**** to Macquarie's despatch on the subject, Earl Bathurst
fully endorsed the opinions put forward by the judge-advocate and
judge, but at the same time censured them for the manner in which
those principles had been brought forward and acted upon, and for
that reason ordered their recall. As the direct result of this
dispute between Macquarie and J. H. Bent, the trials of all causes
in which the amount involved exceeded the sum of £50 sterling were
suspended for two years, with great injury and inconvenience to the
colonists.</p>

VIII.]&nbsp;&nbsp;[*** <i>See</i> page 542, volume
VIII.]&nbsp;&nbsp;[**** <i>See</i> page 107 <i>et seq.,</i> volume
IX.]</p>
<p>In his administration of the convict system, Governor Macquarie
committed many errors of judgment. During his government, it became
necessary to develop a rational and workable system for the
management of the convicts, as the influence of the convict class
on the character of the community had become very great. Previous
to the year 1810 less than twelve thousand convicts had been
transported to the colony, whilst during Macquarie's government
alone the numbers were more than twenty-one thousand. To find
employment for and to regulate the conduct of this large number of
convicts were the problems which confronted Macquarie.</p>
<p>At this period, convicts who had been transported to the colony
were not lodged in gaols and taken out in gangs for their daily
labour. The gaols were reserved for the imprisonment of those
persons who had committed crimes in the settlements; whilst the
transported convicts, employed in the towns, resided, before the
year 1819, in scattered huts and houses, and, except during the
hours of labour, were practically allowed their freedom. Under such
conditions, it is apparent that the convict class had great
influence on the community when the number of free people was small
as compared with the number of convicts. The defects in the system
evolved by Macquarie may probably be best demonstrated by a brief
sketch of the methods adopted.</p>
<p>On the arrival of a transport ship in the harbour, the convicts
were mustered on board in the presence of the governor's secretary,
and inquiries were made as to their treatment on the voyage, their
former trades or occupations, and other particulars. On this
information, based on the irresponsible statements of the convicts
themselves, the superintendent of convicts decided on the
destination of each prisoner. After their debarkation, the convicts
were inspected and addressed by Governor Macquarie. In the course
of his address, he stated that no reference would be made to their
past, and that "their future conduct" would "alone entitle them to
reward or indulgence". This speech had a bad effect, as the
convicts on their first arrival realised that all classifications
or punishments by hard labour, according to the degrees of their
crimes, were abolished.</p>
<p>There were two channels for the employment of convicts,
assignment to settlers and other individuals, and employment in the
government gangs; but the distribution was made entirely without
reference to the crimes for which they were transported.</p>
<p>Free labour was scarce in the colony, and applications for the
assignment of convicts as labourers and servants were made by
settlers and other inhabitants. Applications at first were
addressed to the governor's secretary, but later to the principal
superintendent of convicts. The assignment was at first made by
lottery, but, when this practice fell into disuse, the whole duty
was left in the hands of the principal superintendent, William
Hutchinson. He was free to act at his discretion, as the governor
seldom interfered with a selection.</p>
<p>Convicts were also assigned to overseers and clerks in lieu of
salaries. Such a convict was victualled by government, and was
allowed his freedom by his master on payment of a weekly sum of ten
shillings, which was reduced to five if he gave up his government
ration to his master.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> first report by J. T. Bigge, page
17.]</p>
<p>The assignment system led to many abuses. Wives of convicts
frequently followed their husbands to the colony, and obtained
their assignment; husbands followed the same practice when their
wives were convicts. Convicts with money obtained their assignment
to one of the poorer settlers, and then, usually by payment of a
weekly sum, obtained exemption from all labour. By these means many
of the terrors of transportation were removed. The rigours of
assignment at other times depended on the temperament of the
masters; one settler was inclined to treat his assigned servants
with lenience and indulgence, another with harshness and severity.
Assignment of female convicts was also the cause of much
immorality.</p>
<p>Employment in the government gangs was dreaded by the convicts
in the first years of this period. Macquarie's passion for the
erection of large public buildings created a demand for mechanics,
and these were in consequence absorbed in the government gangs, and
it was a difficult matter and esteemed a great favour for a settler
to obtain the assignment of a skilled labourer. To avoid employment
in a government gang, convicts frequently concealed their true
trades.</p>
<p>In the year 1811, Governor Macquarie abolished the employment of
convicts in agriculture on government account, and did not renew it
until he established the penal agricultural settlement at Emu
plains at the end of the year 1819. The consequence of this was
that all convicts in the employ of government were congregated in
large gangs in the towns, with the exception of those engaged in
the construction and maintenance of the public roads. For many
years no suitable building was provided for the accommodation of
these gangs at Sydney, and the convicts were allowed to billet
themselves in various parts of the town. Such a system caused an
almost total lack of control and supervision, and it was not until
the opening of the convict barracks near Hyde park on the 4th of
June, 1819, that discipline was possible. The effects of a system
which allowed to hardened criminals their freedom at night time can
be readily imagined, and many crimes were caused by the want of
discipline.</p>
<p>The large town gangs were chiefly employed in the erection of
public buildings. If these buildings had been necessary, the cost
of the maintenance of such large bodies of convicts would have been
justified. But many of the buildings were too large and too
ornamental for the requirements of the colony, and the expenditure
therefore was unnecessary. Undoubtedly the convicts could have been
employed more profitably in the clearing of land for settlers, as
they were during the government of Sir Thomas Brisbane, or in
agriculture, thereby contributing to their own maintenance.</p>
<p>Convicts of the educated class, who were unused to manual
labour, were usually granted tickets-of-leave soon after their
arrival, if they showed a reasonable prospect of being able to
support themselves. By this practice, they were set at large in the
colony and liberated from all discipline and control.</p>
<p>Before leaving England, Governor Macquarie's attention had been
drawn to the want of classification* of the convicts, and the
indiscriminate mixing of all classes irrespective of their degrees
of crime. He commenced with the humanitarian object of making the
settlements a place of reform, where offenders against the laws of
their country might rehabilitate themselves in the eyes of their
fellow-men. He failed in the first inception of a system for such
purposes by neglecting to segregate the hardened criminal, or one
undergoing a second or third term of transportation from England,
from association with one who had been transported for a momentary
lapse or minor offence against the law. Convicts undergoing a
sentence of transportation passed by the colonial courts were,
however, removed to Newcastle and, in the last few months of
Macquarie's administration, to Port Macquarie. With these
exceptions, the most hardened criminal had unfettered association
with the novice in crime.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 206 <i>et seq.,</i> volume
VII.]</p>
<p>The superintendence of the convicts was weak. Many of the
superintendents, overseers, and clerks in charge of road gangs were
convicts themselves, and, in the year 1818, out of one hundred and
seven, only thirty-eight were free. Macquarie had frequently
requested, without success, the appointment of properly qualified
persons from England, but at the same time his opposition to the
immigration of free persons reduced the numbers available in the
colony. These men were remunerated chiefly by the assignment of
convicts to themselves, as has already been noted.</p>
<p>Want of efficient control was the cause of much idleness and
desultory work amongst the government gangs. In the year 1817, a
system of task work was introduced, with Governor Macquarie's
somewhat unwilling consent. Wherever practicable, certain weekly
tasks were allotted to the men. This task work was fixed on a scale
considerably below that accomplished by a free man, and, as soon as
each convict had fulfilled his weekly task, he was allowed to
employ himself to his own advantage. This policy caused a
considerable speeding up of the public works, and at the same time
allowed the settlers the opportunity of gaining a limited amount of
skilled labour from the convict mechanics in their own time, as
most of the convicts were able to fulfil their weekly task by
Wednesday evening. The change was also appreciated by the convicts;
in place of the former aversion to being employed in government
gangs, such employment was eagerly sought by all convicts, and
servants assigned to settlers became restless and dissatisfied and
used every means to obtain their "return to government". The result
was that the settlers, after first appreciating the new system,
found it unworkable, and it was finally abolished and a reversion
made to the old system of day labour with its associated
slackness.</p>
<p>The indulgences to convicts according to colonial custom were of
three kinds&mdash;tickets-of-leave, and conditional and absolute
pardons. All these were in the gift of the governor. A
ticket-of-leave enabled the recipient to follow any occupation he
desired, provided he remained within a certain named district. A
conditional pardon granted the holder his freedom within the limits
of the territory. An absolute pardon gave the recipient his full
freedom and the right to return to England.</p>
<p>Prior to June, 1811, the granting of these indulgences was not
regulated; but on the 22nd of that month, Governor Macquarie
declared that no remissions of sentence would be granted except
after a long and uninterrupted period of good conduct; that
convicts for life must serve "several years"; that convicts for
limited terms must serve at least half their sentence; and that
tickets-of-leave would not be granted until the applicants had
served three years. In the year 1813, Macquarie made additional
regulations.* He declared that no absolute pardons would be granted
to convicts for life until they had resided fifteen years in the
colony, or to convicts for limited terms until they had resided for
three-fourths of the sentence; and that no conditional pardons
would be granted in similar cases until after a residence of ten
years and two-thirds of the sentence respectively. Applications for
such indulgences were at first received by Governor Macquarie at
any time; but, owing to the inconvenience caused by the number of
applicants, one day a month, and later only the first Monday in
December of each year, was set apart for the hearing of the
petitions. Applications were suspended for three years, 1816, 1818,
and 1820, on the principle of expediency.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 782 <i>et seq.,</i> volume
VII.]</p>
<p>In announcing these regulations, Governor Macquarie stated that
he was determined not to deviate from them. The regulations were
indeed excellent; but Macquarie nullified them by his own actions,
for in eight years (1813-1820), out of two thousand seven hundred
and thirty indulgences granted, seven hundred and ten were made
contrary to his own regulations.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarie also adopted the practice of granting
indulgences as rewards for some particular labour or enterprize.
Some of these were well deserved, such as the seven absolute and
five conditional pardons granted to men who accompanied John Oxley
on his explorations. Possibly the three absolute and thirty-five
conditional pardons and one ticket-of-leave given to men employed
in making the first Bathurst road were also justifiable; but the
seven emancipations granted merely for the use of horses and carts
in the construction of that road, without any personal service
whatever, were tantamount to the sale of pardons. Also the eight
emancipations granted for assisting with carts and one horse each
in the transport of baggage and provisions for Governor Macquarie
on his visit to Bathurst in 1815, a service which lasted only five
weeks without any danger, were quite unmerited rewards.</p>
<p>Indeed, there seems only one conclusion to draw with regard to
Macquarie's administration of the settlements as a penal colony,
and that is that his system for the management of convicts and his
policy with regard to emancipists were too ill-regulated and
ill-balanced to be continued, or to confer any lasting benefit on
the progress of the colony.</p>
<p>The methods adopted by Governor Macquarie in making land grants
were extremely lax, and were the cause of much subsequent
confusion. By the ninth paragraph of his instructions,* he was
ordered to make periodical returns of land grants to the
commissioners of the treasury and to the committee of the privy
council for trade and plantations. Such returns were transmitted
with despatches, dated 30th April, 1810, 18th October, 1811, and
17th November, 1812. No further returns were made until he was
instructed** to do so in March, 1821, in consequence of an order
made by the House of Commons. There does not appear to be any
explanation for this neglect to comply with his instructions. In
the meantime, he had been most lavish in granting lands, as will be
seen from his return*** to the 25th of March, 1821. Apart from the
grants actually completed, at the time of his departure he left a
balance of unexecuted grants, whose area aggregated three hundred
and forty thousand acres. Most of these lands were occupied merely
on a promise,**** they were unsurveyed, and in several cases
dealings in them had been transacted. Many of the titles to town
allotments were also incomplete. The result of such a system was
chaos, which gave rise to innumerable lawsuits. Many years later,
these promises of land grants and permissive occupancies were
considered and finally settled by the court of claims.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 193, volume VII.]&nbsp;&nbsp;[**
<i>See</i> page 408. (volume X.)]&nbsp;&nbsp;[*** <i>See</i> page
560 <i>et seq.</i> (volume X.)] &nbsp;&nbsp;[**** A striking
example of such a promise is quoted in note 136. (volume X.)]</p>
<p>During Macquarie's government, the administration of the colony
was the subject of severe criticism in parliament, in the English
press, and in a pamphlet***** published by the Hon. H. Grey Bennet.
Part of the criticism was due to misrepresentations sent to
England, but much of it was justified. In January, 1819, John
Thomas Bigge was appointed a commissioner to inquire into the state
of the colony. He was also instructed to investigate the conduct of
all officials. Macquarie seems to have resented this in his own
case, and he took exception to the question put to most witnesses,
whether they had any complaints to make against the governor. The
relations between Bigge and Macquarie were therefore much strained
on several occasions. Bigge was endowed with plenary powers to make
recommendations to the governor for immediate reforms, and, if they
were not adopted, Macquarie was directed to submit a full report of
his reasons to England. Such recommendations were refused by
Macquarie on two important occasions, namely, at the time of the
appointment of William Redfern to the magistracy, and on the
question of the removal of headquarters at Port Dalrymple. In both
cases, Macquarie's judgment was wrong and Bigge's recommendations
were correct. In making his investigations, Bigge adopted the
practice of taking evidence without putting the witness on his
oath, and it is probable that a certain amount of malicious
testimony was given. Macquarie took strong exception to this; but
Bigge continued it, as he considered it probable that the witnesses
would thereby give their evidence with greater freedom.
Notwithstanding possible mistakes that may have crept in from this
cause, it is certain that the reports submitted to parliament by J.
T. Bigge led to innumerable reforms of immense value to the colony,
which were introduced during the government of Sir Thomas Brisbane.
The reports engendered much bitterness and ill-feeling in
Macquarie, and it was even suggested in the colonial press at the
time that they hastened his death.</p>
<p class="foot">[***** <i>See</i> note 58. (volume X.)]</p>
<p>The exercise of unlimited authority for such an extended period
as nearly twelve years undoubtedly had great influence over
Macquarie's character, and made the autocrat more autocratic than
before. Yet towards the close of his administration his energy was
waning, and of this he gave expression in a despatch* to Earl
Bathurst, dated 29th February, 1820. The presence in the colony of
the commission of inquiry probably also led him to defend some of
his administrative acts and to modify his views. In a despatch**
dated 31st August, 1820, he wrote a defence of his reasons for
refusing certain land grants, and in another despatch,*** dated
28th February, 1820, a defence of his erection of the general
hospital. He reversed his views entirely with regard to the
location of the courts**** in the principal surgeon's quarters at
the general hospital, and his employment of convicts in
agriculture***** on government account.</p>

<p>During Macquarie's government the colony was in a condition of
transition. It was emerging from the position of a penal settlement
on an isolated coast to a growing colony awaiting methodical
development. A master mind might have hastened its development;
might have recognised that the status of a purely penal settlement
was no longer tenable, and that a free population, as distinct from
the emancipist class, should be encouraged; and might have shaped
its destinies accordingly. But Macquarie did none of these things.
The chief causes of his failure were his ill-balanced judgment, his
hastiness and obstinacy, which made him intolerant of advice and
unwilling to modify his views, when criticised, or to acquiesce in
the limitation of his powers by accredited legal opinions. As a
man, he was honourable and upright, energetic and determined, and
won the respect of the large class he befriended. As an
administrator, he developed the purely material side of the colony,
he encouraged the foundation of a rational financial system, and he
removed some of the disabilities of trade and commerce. But in the
larger issues Macquarie failed. Probably the most important result
of Macquarie's administration was the fact that it made the British
ministry realise that a government by one man, unaided and with
autocratic powers, was no longer feasible in the colony.</p>
