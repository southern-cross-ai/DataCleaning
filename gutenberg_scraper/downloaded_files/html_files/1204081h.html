<h1>Early Australian History.</h1>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>A Series of Historical Sketches, bearing upon Australian
Colonization and Convict Life in New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How strangely the links fit in! Little did the British
Government think when issuing the orders in Council in 1786 for
establishing a Convict Settlement in New South Wales, that they
were taking the initial steps towards founding a "New Britannia in
the Southern World." Yet so it was. If the American War of
Independence had not closed the plantations of Virginia against the
reception of transported offenders, and cast upon the British
Government the duty of fixing upon some other place to which they
might send some of the prisoners who then filled the gaols of Great
Britain to overflowing, the wonderful land of which Captain Cook
had spoken as having been discovered by him, and concerning which
the interest of the English people had been considerably excited at
the time his narratives-were published&mdash;the land which now
ranks as one of the richest, most populous, and most progressive of
the British dependencies&mdash;might to this day have remained in
the possession of the aborigines; producing nothing, promising
nothing; locked up from civilization and all its blessings (and
curses), and unknown save to the few thousands of blacks who might
from year to year inhabit it. And what, then, would the world have
lost&mdash;what, then, should we who live in it have lost?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pessimists, time and again, have raised a lachrymose wail about
the 'stain' which must always rest on the colony through the
criminality of its early life; but these men can never see anything
but the evil, and even that evil they would intensify for the sake
of making their wailing more mournful. 'Tis true that the beginning
was in some measure bad, but that bad beginning was better than no
beginning at all; and, fresh from long and deep research among old
records, I am bold to declare that the earlier convicts were not
the worst criminals who came out to the colony, and that some of
the darker and bloodier stains which deface the first pages of the
colony's history were made by men who counted the poor chained
wretches under them as worse than the offal in a
charnel-house&mdash;men who came out free, who lived freely, lied
and robbed and murdered freely, and who literally fattened on the
blood of other mortals a thousand times better than themselves,
although those mortals had been banished from their fatherland in
chains. The facts in proof of this assertion will appear in proper
order; at present we must deal with events that transpired before
either bond or free from Britain's shores placed foot upon
Australian land for the purpose of making it their home.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Great Britain had had experience of transport colonization
before ever Australia was thought of. For upwards of a century and
a half, historians tell us, great numbers of convicts were annually
sent across the Atlantic to American plantations, most of them
being sold to the planters for a term of years or for life, and
from this source, for a considerable period, England is said to
have derived a revenue as large at times as &pound;40,000 a year, the
convicts being sold to the planters at an average of &pound;20 each. But
here, also, out of evil good arose. Virginia, one of England's
earliest and most successful attempts at colonization, is a
remarkable instance of prosperity outflowing from beginnings of the
darkest moral shade. In the case of Australia, the conditions were
different, but the elements were the same, and now that the old
order has changed, giving place to the new, we, from the midst of
the free, beneficent and flourishing institutions now
existing&mdash;from surroundings of the most favorable
character&mdash;from conditions of private, social and public life
of which any nation might be proud&mdash;look out upon the
fast-fading picture of the past, and marvel exceedingly at the
change.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Read me anything but history," said Walpole; "that is sure to
be false." And a good many in Australia living at the present day
would give not a little of their possessions to be able to create a
general distaste for and hatred of colonial history, and to induce
those who cared to read that history to believe that it was false.
They fear the record because of its truth, and because they have
reason to know that in this case "truth is stranger than fiction."
And I purpose giving only such facts, in this somewhat irregular
narrative, as can be vouched for either by living witnesses or by
written (some very badly written) official records. The reader can,
of course, if he choose, keep in view the maxim of
Epicharmus&mdash;"Be discreet, and bethink thee to be mistrustful,
to disbelieve rather than otherwise;" but neither doubt nor
distrust on the reader's part will render less true the
records&mdash;some of which are written in ineffaceable letters of
blood.</p>

<p>IT was early in the year 1787 that a fleet of eleven sail could
be seen rendezvousing off the Isle of Wight, the names of the
vessels being the Sirius, frigate; the Supply, armed tender; the
Golden Grove, Fishburn, and Barrowdale, storeships; and the
Scarborough, Lady Penrhyn, Friendship, Charlotte, Prince of Wales,
and Alexander, transports. On board were Captain Arthur Phillip,
styled Governor and Commander-in-Chief of New South Wales, with
other inferior officers&mdash;a Lieutenant-Governor, a chaplain, a
commissary, judge advocate, surgeon, adjutant, quarter-master, two
assistant surgeons and an agent for transports; a garrison of 200
marines, fully officered; 200 soldiers, forty of whom were allowed
to take their wives and families; 81 other free persons and 696
convicts&mdash;making a total of 1044 persons. Of this number 1030
were safely landed in the colony in January, 1788, having been
eight months on the water. Of the number landed about 300 were
females, twenty-eight being wives of the military, and 192
convicts. It must not be supposed that these male and female
convicts were criminals of the deepest die, for they were mostly
young persons from the agricultural districts of England, and out
of the whole 696, only 55 were sentenced for longer periods than
seven years, and the sentences of a large number would expire
within two or three years after their landing. The laws of England
a century ago, and their administration, were very different from
what they are now, and large numbers of those who crowded the
gaols, and were sent from the gaols across the water to the new
land, had never been accused of anything worse than poaching or
smuggling, while many of them were suffering for political offences
which in later days made statesmen, and crowned the 'transgressors'
with imperishable glory. That there were some very bad men and
women in the first batch, and in the batches that followed in their
wake, is true; but the number was proportionately small, and their
influence for evil was necessarily contracted.</p>
<p>The first ship of the fleet, the Supply, with the Governor on
board, anchored in Botany Bay on 18th January, 1788, and was
closely followed by the other ships. Concerning the landing we find
the following record in the history of Governor Phillip's voyage,
published in the following year:&mdash;"At the very first landing
of Governor Phillip on the shore of Botany Bay, January 18th, 1788,
an interview with the natives took place. They were all armed, but
on seeing the Governor approach with signs of friendship, alone and
un-armed, they readily returned his confidence by laying down their
weapons. They were perfectly devoid of clothing, yet seemed fond of
ornaments, putting the beads and red baize that were given them on
their heads and necks, and appearing pleased to wear them. The
presents offered by their new visitors were all readily accepted,
nor did any kind of disagreement arise while the ships remained in
Botany Bay." Well would it have been for the aborigines if Governor
Phillip's spirit had animated all those who in after years, during
the succeeding efforts of colonization and settlement, were brought
into contact with them. Some of the facts detailed later on will
prove that, in the fullest sense of the term, civilization to the
blacks meant nothing more nor less than physical and moral ruin,
and that in the sound of the first gun fired from a British piece
on Australian soil the original occupants of that soil heard their
death knell.</p>
<p>The story of the first landing of Governor Phillip's mixed
party, and the subsequent removal of the settlement from Botany Bay
to Port Jackson, whose harbour, from its sheltered position, deep
water, and almost immeasurable bays and bold headlands, was seen to
be the most desirable haven that anyone could wish, must be
familiar to the reader; as also must be the formalities observed by
the Governor on January 26th, 1788, in taking possession of the
land&mdash;hoisting British colors on a flagstaff erected on the
site now occupied by Dawes' Battery, drinking the King's health
around the pole amid much excitement and cheering, while the blacks
saw and heard from a distance the wonderful sights and sounds,
little dreaming that the company of white-faced mortals upon whom
they gazed would in so short a space of time push them off the land
which Nature had given them to possess.</p>
<p>The work of clearing a sufficient space for tents and stores on
the shores of Sydney Cove occupied about a fortnight, and this
done, the work of establishing a regular form of Government was
carried out in a very solemn manner by the Governor. The military
was drawn up under arms, the prisoners stationed apart, and the
Royal Commission and the Acts of Parliament authorising the
establishment of the Courts of Judicature having been read by the
Judge-Advocate, a volley was fired, and his Excellency delivered an
address to the convicts. He reminded them that they were now so
placed that by industry and good behaviour they might soon regain
the advantages which they had forfeited, and promised that every
assistance should be rendered them in their efforts to reach the
position which they had lost by their offences; but he told them
plainly that no mercy would be shewn to offenders against the law.
He advised those of the convicts who were in a position to do so to
marry, holding out to them promises of assistance; and he closed
his address by declaring his earnest desire to promote the well
being of all who had been placed under his control, and his
determination, with the help of God, to render the colonization of
the new land advantageous and honorable to the colony.</p>
<p>Speaking of this time, Collins, one of the earliest writers on
the colonization of New South Wales, says: "The confusion that
ensued will not be wondered at when it is considered that every man
stepped from a boat literally into a wood. Parties of people were
everywhere heard and seen variously employed; some in clearing
ground for the different encampments, others in pitching tents or
bringing up such stores as were more immediately wanted; and the
spot which had so recently been the abode of silence and
tranquility was now changed to that of noise, clamour and
confusion; but after a time order gradually prevailed everywhere.
As the woods were opened and the ground cleared, the various
encampments were extended, and all wore the appearance of
regularity." Let anyone now mix with the thousands of hurrying,
bustling mortals, of every age and color and clime, who daily come
and go to the water's edge where this landing took place, and as he
gazes across the crowded harbour or turns back to pass through the
mazes of buildings and the ever-thickening stream of people in the
city of Sydney and the adjacent suburbs, the one great surprise of
his life will be the marvellous change which has taken place in the
short space of a hundred years.</p>
<p>Four months after the first landing&mdash;in May, 1788&mdash;the
Governor directed every person in the Settlement to make a return
of what live stock was in his possession, and this was the full
record:&mdash;1 horse, 3 mares, 3 colts, 2 bulls, 5 cows, 29 sheep,
19 goats, 49 hogs, 29 pigs, 5 rabbits, 18 turkeys, 29 geese, 35
ducks, 122 fowls, and 89 chickens. And only this from which the
supply of fresh meat for more than a thousand persons was to be
drawn! From this small stock, in the following month, the two bulls
and four of the five cows were lost through the carelessness of the
man who had charge of them; although the loss eventually proved a
great and permanent gain, the stray animals being afterwards
discovered&mdash;in November, 1795&mdash;on the other side of the
Nepean River, a place there after called the Cowpastures, the seven
having become nearly fifty. Governor Hunter, who had succeeded
Phillip, in person went in search of the missing cattle and
personally inspected the herd, satisfying himself that they were
the descendants of the original importations by having one of them
killed. These wild cattle were religiously preserved from
destruction, and increasing greatly divided into mobs, each under
the charge of a victorious bull, until the general increase of
stock diminished their value. The surrounding small settlers
consumed not a little of the wild beef, and, subsequently, when
beef ceased to be a luxury, the remnants of this wild tribe, which
had sprung from the original stock, were destroyed by order of the
Government. It is recorded that about the time this wild herd was
discovered three miserable cows of the Indian breed sold for &pound;189,
and two years afterwards two ships were employed eight months in
bringing 51 cows, 3 bulls, and 90 sheep from the Cape, at enormous
cost. Running along the years we find at the beginning of 1887, in
the three colonies of Australia alone&mdash;New South Wales,
Victoria, and Queensland&mdash;the following record of live stock
possessions:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br>
<br>
New South Wales:<br>
............369,663 Horses<br>
.........1,367,844 Cattle<br>
.......39,169,304 Sheep<br>

..........6,742,672 Cattle<br>
........59,560,152 Sheep<br>
............512,394 Pigs.<br>
<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is not the only illustration that Australia has
furnished of a 'little one' becoming 'a thousand.'</p>
<p>It was towards the close of 1792 that Governor Phillip resigned
his command in the colony and returned to England; and here a word
or two may be said in praise of his uprightness of character,
kindness of heart, firm discipline, and administrative ability. His
position was a peculiarly onerous one, his duties were most
difficult, and the noble example of disinterestedness and
self-sacrifice set by him on more than one occasion when actual
starvation stared the colonists&mdash;free as well as bond&mdash;in
the face, has never been surpassed by any ruler in ancient or
modern times. After the lapse of a hundred years one can hardly
conceive the difficulties attendant upon official life in the days
when Governor Phillip held absolute sway. The rough and rude
material which he had to shape into order and decency would under
favorable circumstances have tested the humanity and statesmanship
of the kindest of mortals and the most skilful of generals; but it
was under the most unfavorable conditions that Governor Phillip
successfully carried the people placed under his charge through the
initial stages of colonization and settlement. The convicts at
times gave great trouble, and had it not been for the strictness of
the discipline enforced&mdash;although no approach was made to
arbitrariness, much less official cruelty&mdash;it is more than
probable that felony would have proved too much for the powers of
militaryism, and lawlessness would have triumphed. It is not every
man who, in a similar position, would have used his powers so
wisely&mdash;powers the equal of which have, perhaps, never been
held or exercised by any other official in the British dominions.
He could sentence to 500 lashes, fine &pound;500; the regulation of
customs and trade were in his hands; he could fix prices and wages,
could sentence a man to death and execute him, or grant an absolute
pardon; he could bestow grants of land, or prevent a would-be
purchaser from investing in any article for use or trade. As Samuel
Sidney well puts it: "All the labour of the colony was at his
disposal, all the land, all the stores, all the places of honor and
profit, and virtually all the justice. His subjects consisted of
his subordinate officers&mdash;for, as captain-general, the
commandant of the troops was under his orders,&mdash;of the few who
resorted to New South Wales to trade, whose profits were at his
disposal, and the convicts, outcasts without civil rights. The
distance from England, the few means of communication, the
indifference of the English to the fate of the inhabitants of a
penal colony, or of any colony, rendered the governor, so far as
the control of law extended, actually irresponsible. As there was
no law, so there was no publicity and no public opinion to restrain
the despotism which was the only possible government in such a
penal colony." More powerful than many Sovereigns, yet exercising
that power more like a kind parent than a despotic king, what
wonder that he should have succeeded in preserving order in a
community and under conditions most unfavorable, and where failure
would have attended the efforts of most men?</p>
<p>Under the unfavourable circumstances existing, it was not to be
expected that during the four-and-a-half years of Governor
Phillip's reign any great progress in the direction of proper
settlement would be made; but there was progress, nevertheless. The
work of cultivation was carried on by the Government as well as it
was able on the public account, but the conditions of soil and
labour were so unsuitable that the yield was not nearly sufficient
at the best to provide for the wants of the inhabitants, whose
numbers were ever increasing by the arrival of fresh ship-loads of
convicts. On two or three occasions the colony was put in the
greatest straits through the failure of the crops and the absence
of provisions. During the first year nothing was produced in the
colony except a few vegetables, and the stock of provisions brought
out from England was in danger of being exhausted before fresh
supplies could be procured. Everyone was put upon short allowance,
and disaffection among the troops and the convicts speedily
manifested itself. Some of the former entered into a conspiracy for
plundering the public store, and succeeded in abstracting a
quantity of provisions before the plot was discovered. As a warning
to others the chief conspirators, seven in number, were hanged by
the Governor straight off. Starvation stared the people in the
face, and, regardless of consequences, the convicts broke
regulation bounds and strayed into the bush in search of herbs and
roots. The result was a natural one&mdash;scores of them were
murdered by the blacks, and so many were being cut down in this way
that an order was given for every one found beyond certain
boundaries to receive one hundred and fifty lashes. If any of the
unfortunates managed to get away from the aborigines only wounded
they were sent to the hospital, and flogged as soon as they
recovered. In those days death was not always the worst fate that
could befall a prisoner.</p>
<p>The early records declare that one man who was caught by the
solitary clergyman in the settlement stealing potatoes from a
garden, was sentenced to 300 lashes, to have his ration of flour
stopped for six months, and to be chained for that period to two
others who had been caught robbing the Governor's garden.</p>
<p>During this trying period Governor Phillip lived on the same
ration as was allowed to the meanest person under his charge, the
weekly provision issued to everyone being simply two and a half
pounds of flour, two pounds of rice, and two pounds of pork. The
humanity of the Governor is seen in the fact narrated by Collins
that he gave up 3 cwt. of flour which was his own private property,
declaring that he did not wish to have on his table at such a time
more than the ration that was received in common from the public
stores.</p>
<p>When the people were on the very verge of despair and death,
their eyes were gladdened by the sight of a provision ship sailing
into the harbour, and bringing 127,000 lbs. of flour, being a four
months' supply for the settlement. A few days afterwards four ships
arrived bringing 1000 male and 250 female convicts. It can readily
be imagined what would have happened had these transport ships
discharged their living freight before the public larder had been
replenished by the timely arrival of the vessel with
provisions.</p>
<p>It is worthy of record that the first grant of land was made to
a settler named Ruse in 1791, he having declared that he was able
to support himself without aid from the Government stores on a farm
which he had occupied fifteen months, the grant of land having been
made as a reward for his industry. In December, 1792, there were 67
settlers holding under grant 3,470 acres, of which 470 acres were
under cultivation and another hundred cleared. The bulk of this
land was near Sydney, and was then, as it is now, looked at from an
agriculturist's point of view, 'miserably barren;' and the little
provision that was won from the soil was chiefly due to the fact
that the work was done by convicts and without pay. These free
settlers&mdash;most of them convicts free by servitude or
pardon&mdash;were supported entirely for eighteen months by the
Government, assistance being rendered as soon as they went on the
land. They were clothed, received their tools and primitive
implements of husbandry, and grain for seed, from the Government
stores, together with the use of as many convicts as they would
undertake to clothe, feed, and employ; while huts were erected for
them also at the public expense.</p>
<p>The Government also did a little farming on its own account, and
the site of the present Botanical gardens was one of the first
plots to be brought under cultivation.</p>
<p>Among the first settlers were some of the marines who had formed
the first garrison and whose places were filled by detachments of
the corps raised expressly for service in the colony, afterwards
called the 102nd Regiment. Those who chose to stay had quantities
of land granted to them in proportion to their rank, and several of
those who availed themselves of the advantages offered became
wealthy colonists in the course of a few years. The regulations
under which land was granted to non-commissioned officers and
privates on the expiry of their terms of service were as
follows:&mdash;To every non-commissioned officer, an allotment of
130 acres of land, if single; and 150 if married. To every private
80 acres if single and 100 if married; and ten acres for each child
at the time of granting the allotment&mdash;free of all taxes,
quit-rents, and other acknowledgments for the term of five years;
at the expiration of which term to be liable to an annual quit-rent
of one shilling for every fifty acres. As a further inducement to
engage in public service, a bounty was offered of &pound;3 per man to
every non-commissioned officer and private who would enlist in the
new corps; and an allotment of double the above proportion of land
if they behaved well for five years, to be granted them at the
expiration of that term, the allotments not to be subject to any
tax for ten years. And at their discharge at either of the above
periods, they were to be supplied with clothing and one year's
provisions, with seed-grain, tools, and implements of agriculture.
The service of a certain number of convicts was to be assigned to
them for their labour when they could make it appear that they
could feed and clothe them.</p>
<p>A list of the prices of agricultural stock and produce at the
close of Governor Phillip's reign will shew how scarce were some of
those things which now are almost beyond counting. Flour (ship's)
was 9d per lb., potatoes 3d per lb., tea 8s to 16s per lb., sugar
1s 6d per lb., (and black at that!), porter 1s per quart, spirits
12s to 20s per gallon, sheep (the Cape breed) &pound;10 10s each, milch
goats &pound;8 8s, breeding sows &pound;7 7s to &pound;10 10s, laying fowls 10s each.
Of cattle and horses there were none for sale.</p>
<p>The rough mortality table for 1792 shews that there died two
persons of the civil department, six soldiers, 418 male convicts,
18 female convicts, and 79 children. The marvel is that under such
unfavourable conditions of life the mortality was not much greater.
Referring to this subject Collins says:&mdash;"The weakest of the
convicts were excused from all kinds of labour; but it was not hard
labour that destroyed them; it was an entire want of strength in
the constitution, which nothing but proper nourishment could
repair. This dreadful mortality was confined to this class of
people; and the wretches who were detected (stealing) were in
general too weak to receive a punishment adequate to their crimes.
Their universal plea was hunger; a plea which, though it could not
be contradicted, imperious necessity deprived of its due weight,
and frequently compelled punishment to be inflicted when pity was
the prevailing sentiment." When, however, the settlement was again
placed on full rations (July, 1792), there were better filled
stomachs, more contentment, and fewer deaths.</p>
<p>The year of Governor Phillip's departure was made remarkable
also by the arrival of the first foreign trading vessel. She was
from the United States, and entered Port Jackson in November,
loaded with goods which the enterprising American skipper
considered suitable to the new market. As it happened, the goods
forming his cargo were in great demand, and he disposed of them at
a high profit. In the same month one of the first warrants of
emancipation was made out in favour of the notorious London
pick-pocket, Barrington, to whom the credit of composing the
prologue to one of the first dramatic representations attempted in
the colony was given, and which contained the oft-quoted lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"True patriots all, for be it understood,<br>
We left our country for our country's good."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following is the full text of that peculiar
document:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From distant climes, o'er wide-spread seas we come,<br>
Though not with much eclat, or beat of drum;<br>
True patriots all, for, be it understood,<br>
We left our country for our country's good:<br>
No private views disgrac'd our generous zeal.<br>
What urg'd our travels was our country's weal;<br>
And none will doubt, but that our emigration<br>
Has proved most useful to the British nation.<br>
But you inquire, what could our breasts inflame.<br>
With this new passion for theatric fame;<br>
What in the practice of our former days,<br>
Could shape our talent to exhibit plays?<br>
Your patience, Sirs, some observations made.<br>
You'll grant us equal to the scenic trade.<br>
He, who to midnight ladders is no stranger,<br>
You'll own will make an admirable ranger.<br>
To seek Macheath we have not far to roam,<br>
And sure in Filch I shall be quite at home.<br>
Unrivalled there, none will dispute my claim,<br>
To high pre-eminence and exalted fame.<br>
As oft to Gadshill we have ta'en our stand,<br>
When 'twas so dark you could not see your hand.<br>
Some true bred Falstaff we may hope to start,<br>
Who, when well-holster'd well will play his part,<br>
The scene to vary, we shall try in time.<br>
To treat you to a little pantomime.<br>
Here light and easy columbines are found,<br>
And well-bred harlequins with us abound;<br>
From durance vile our precious selves to keep<br>
We often had recourse to th' flying leap;<br>
To a black face have sometimes ow'd escape,<br>
And Hounslow Heath has proved the worth of crape.<br>
But how, you ask, can we e'er hope to soar<br>
Above these scenes, and rise to tragic lore?<br>
Too oft, alas! we've forced th' unwilling tear,<br>
And petrified the heart with real fear.<br>
Macbeth a harvest of applause will reap,<br>
For some of us, I fear, have murdered sleep;<br>
His lady too with grace will sleep and talk,<br>

Sometimes, indeed, so various is our art.<br>
An actor may improve and mend his part;<br>
"Give me a horse," bawls Richard, like a drone,<br>
We'll find a man would help himself to one.<br>
Grant us the favour, put us to the test,<br>
To gain your smiles we'll do our very best;<br>
And, without dread of future Turnkey Lockits,<br>
Thus, in an honest way, still pick your pockets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is worthy of note also that the first attempt to penetrate
the Blue Mountains was made during Governor Phillip's reign. In the
month of December 1789, Lieutenant Dawes and a party essayed the
task, but returned to Sydney after nine days' absence without
having as much as touched the cover of that sealed book which in
future years was to open up to the people of all countries such a
vast area of wealth-producing soil. For many years thereafter the
Blue Mountains were looked upon as a curtain hiding from view a
most mysterious land; but it is safe to say that no dream of wealth
and beauty then crossing the mind even approached the reality which
many thousands at the present day both feel and know.</p>
<p>Governor Phillip embarked for England on the 11th December,
1792, and settled in Bath on a pension of &pound;500 a year, which was
granted by the British Government, for his services in establishing
the colony. He died at Bath in 1814.</p>

BUSINESS&mdash;A GAOLER PUBLICAN&mdash;KILLING THE
TRAFFIC&mdash;INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS.</p>
<p>During the greater portion of the three years following Governor
Phillip's departure the Government of the settlement was
practically a military despotism. The Government devolved, first
upon Major Francis Grose, and secondly upon Captain Patterson,
senior officers of the 102nd Regiment of the New South Wales Corps,
and these officers by incompetency on the one hand and wretched
militaryism on the other succeeded in establishing an order of
things the whole tendency of which was evil, and the results of
which have extended down the whole line of the hundred years which
have now passed since the foundation of the colony.</p>
<p>A word or two here concerning the "New South Wales Corps," of
which these officers were distinguished members, must be said. The
corps had been raised in England in 1790-1 for service in the
colonies&mdash;a service which was not considered at that time
either dignified or honourable for any British officer of much
repute to engage in; and consequently many of those who found their
way into it possessed a very low estimate of morality and honesty.
They were, therefore, quite prepared to engage in any work, however
dirty, or unjust, or arbitrary, that would bring pecuniary profit
to themselves or satisfy the gross sensuality of their natures. And
they found in the convict settlement a splendid field for the
exercise of their evil inclinations.</p>
<p>The first use Grose made of his power was to issue an order
merging the civil in the military authority. From this time forth
the officers of the Corps held the reins of power, and they were
not slow to avail themselves of the opportunities thus offered for
self-aggrandisement; and so firmly did they batten themselves on
the life of the colony&mdash;social, civil, and
political&mdash;that for nearly a quarter of a century after the
issue of Grose's first order they literally wielded the helm of
State, against Governors and people alike.</p>
<p>Their first division of the 'spoils' consisted in land
appropriation. Although Governor Phillip had only alienated about
3,000 acres of the public land to private individuals, these
military robbers appropriated more than 15,000 acres to themselves
within a very short time, their own immediate friends coming in for
a share of the plunder. And for long after their messmates had
vacated the gubernatorial seat this small but powerful class
continued to 'grab' the public estate with greedy fingers, and
those of them who were steady as well as unscrupulous thus became
the founders of wealthy families who, even at that early day, and
with the dirt still clinging to their fingers, assumed the powers
and privileges of a 'landed aristocracy.' The leader of the class
which assumed such privileges was Mr. John Macarthur, who was
captain and paymaster of the Corps, but who after a few years
service left the ranks of <i>honour</i> and developed into a large
landed proprietor and owner of stock; subsequently becoming so
powerful as to disturb even the seat of Government, and plunge the
whole colony into confusion. The one redeeming feature in his
career was the successful attempt he made to improve the breed of
sheep; but it is questionable whether, even in this act, he had any
higher patriotic motive than that furnished by the possibly louder
jingle of coin in his own pocket. It is but just to say, however,
that he set a virtuous example in private and social life which put
the conduct of many of his fellow-officers to the blush, his family
being one of the best-regulated in the colony.</p>
<p>The position occupied by the officers of the New South Wales
Corps furnished them with singular advantages in the matter of
mercantile speculations, and history supplies no record of any more
unscrupulous or successful 'ring' than that formed by them. They
had absolute control of the King's stores, which were supplies from
England and contained all that was supposed to be necessary for the
comfortable sustenance of the settlement, and from these stores
they would obtain supplies of useful articles at cost price, to
retail them out at an enormous profit; and in time they established
a monopoly that was as immoral as it was vexatious and disastrous.
At first they confined their operations to the wholesale line of
business; but as time went on and they saw emancipated convicts
amassing wealth by petty dealing among their fellows, they plunged
into that business and established a monopoly in that line also,
their official command of appliances and facilities giving them
great advantages over honest, fair-dealing men. They formed a guild
among themselves, having for its object a monopoly of the profits
on all importations, by levying a sort of blackmail on all goods
landed in the colony, and particularly of such stores as were sent
out by the Home Government for disposal to the settlers. The moment
a cargo of goods was stored in the Government Warehouse these
official hucksterers assembled and divided the goods among
themselves; they then placed their marks, and the prices at which
the public would be allowed to purchase, on each packet or article;
and by this plan, although no money was actually paid, they reaped
enormous profits, as all the money above the prices fixed by the
Government or the private importers went into their own pockets.
They were also in a position to compel the settlers to sell to
them, at their own prices, produce which they afterwards re-sold to
the Government at the higher rates which had been fixed through
their influence; and if a settler raised any objection to this
one-sided bargain they literally shut the door of the public store
against him. To such a pitch did these commercial weevil carry
their scheme that in some years it is said not a single bushel of
grain or pound of pork found its way into the Government stores
except through their hands. What wonder, then, that the poor
settlers should grow poorer and that natural production should fall
off! This nefarious system was carried out after the following
fashion:&mdash;No private person was allowed to enter the public
store unless he produced a written order from a Government officer,
which order, owing to the officer having a 'finger in the pie,' had
to be purchased at a very high rate; so that only those able and
willing to pay the heavy premium to the privileged selling class
could procure the article they required from the store.</p>
<p>These epauletted dealers also traded in another way.</p>
<p>Rum was the article then, and for many years afterwards, in most
frequent requisition throughout the colony. Spirits were, in fact,
the currency of the colony. Almost all extra work was paid for in
spirits, and the diligence of prisoners even, in unloading a vessel
laden with Government stores, was stimulated by giving half a pint
of rum to each. Among free and bond, drunkenness was a prevailing
vice&mdash;a natural result of the system introduced under this
military-<i>cum</i>-trading crowd, of officially making rum the
currency. How universal became the practice was proved on oath by a
gentleman who knew all about it, when giving evidence in 1811 at
the trial of Colonel Johnston for his connection with the forcible
deposition of Governor Bligh. Mr. John McArthur's evidence was as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Question:</i>&mdash;"Has not the barter of spirits been
always practised by every person in the colony, as a matter of
necessity, from the want of currency?"</p>
<p><i>Answer:</i>&mdash;"I know of no exception; as far as my
observation went it was universal; officers civil and military,
clergy, every description of inhabitants, were under the necessity
of paying for the necessaries of life, for every article of
consumption, in that sort of commodity which the people who had to
sell were inclined to take: in many cases you could not get labour
performed without it."</p>
<p>Captain Kemp, another of the New South Wales Corps, on the same
occasion, under catechism, made a similar reply:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Question:</i>&mdash;"Was the barter of spirits prohibited by
Governor Macquarie; or were the officers of the 73rd Regiment
allowed to barter spirits?"</p>
<p><i>Answer:</i>&mdash;"The Governor, clergy, officers civil and
military, all ranks and descriptions of people, bartered spirits
when I left Sydney&mdash;viz., in May, 1810."</p>
<p>A rule was established that there should be periodical issues of
rum to the officers of the Corps, in quantities according to rank.
But they supplemented this 'allowance'(self-granted, be it
remembered) by first purchase of the cargo. When a merchant ship
arrived in the harbour, the officers of the Corps got the first
sight of her manifest and first choice of her cargo; but they were
kind enough to allow the free or emancipated convict-merchants to
follow in their wake. And they were as vigorous in the retail trade
as in the wholesale. Most of the non-commissioned officers had
licenses to sell spirits; and in this manner the superfluous rum of
the Regiment was disposed of.</p>
<p>But to narrate in detail all the actions of these men, and their
results, would fill a bulky volume. It must suffice to say that
after they had pursued their system of spoliation for some twenty
years they received a check. The injustice they were inflicting
upon the free settlers at length became so notorious as to attract
the attention of the British Parliament, and in 1812 a Committee of
the House of Commons sat to consider the matter. The following
extracts from the evidence taken before that Committee will shew
the extent to which these gentry carried their
depredations:&mdash;</p>
<p>MAURICE MARGAROT called in and examined:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In what year did you sail to New South Wales? In 1794. And to
what period did you remain? Till the year 1810.</p>
<p>"Did you observe that in consequence of the mode in which the
convicts at Botany Bay were treated, that their morals and conduct
were improved by their treatment? No.</p>
<p>"What do you conceive to be the obstacle to their improvement?
The selection of the officers by Government who are sent out there,
and the arbitrary mode in which that Government is carried on, for
as much as they have no rule to go by but one Act of Parliament,
which enjoins them to keep as near to the laws of England as they
can.</p>
<p>"Point out what you conceive to be the principal defects in the
system adopted by the officers sent out by this
country.&mdash;Trade and personal interests; for to nothing else
can their behaviour be attributed; it is barbarous and cruel in the
extreme.</p>
<p>"Do the majority of the officers to whom the Government of the
colony is entrusted embark in trade? All, to a man.</p>
<p>"What is that trade? In consists, first of all, of monopoly,
then of extortion; it includes all the necessaries of life which
are brought to the colony. The trade in which the officers are
engaged is, first, the supply of the stores with wheat and pork,
sometimes beef and mutton, to the exclusion of the settlers; next,
vessels arrive from different parts of Europe, and from India, with
such articles as may be deemed luxuries; tea, sugar, rum, wine,
little matters for clothing, silk handkerchiefs, &amp;c., and a
variety of articles; the officers purchase them and retail them at
perhaps 500 per cent. profit. There is likewise another monopoly;
the Government has been very kind to the colony, and sent out
various articles for the use of the settlers and prisoners, such as
sieves, hats, clothes, linen, coarse cloth, and a thousand other
articles; when a ship of that kind has arrived, and the goods have
been landed in the King's stores, after a few days the stores are
opened to the officers, who go in, lay their hands upon every thing
of value, and have their names affixed to it as purchasers, and
they leave nothing but the refuse for the colony; having so done,
by themselves or by their agents, they retail that, as I said
before, at 500 per cent. profit. I believe that I am not out when I
say that a sieve, to sift meal, which cost them 5/9, has been sold
for three guineas, and rum I have known sold at &pound;8 per gallon,
which cost 7/6.</p>
<p>"Do you mean that civil officers, or military, or both, are
engaged in this trade? All of them to a man. In the year 1797 a
combination bond was entered into by them, by which they were
neither to underbuy nor undersell the one from the other.</p>
<p>"How was that known in the colony? Because it was offered me to
sign, and I refused it, and from thence began my persecutions; some
of the upper inhabitants had that bond tendered them to sign; it
was brought to me, I refused signing it; it went in fact to do what
they have done ever since without it; there was an <i>esprit de
corps</i> among them, that although they might jar between one
another, if you offended one you offended the whole; and any poor
prisoner that had the misfortune to offend any one officer would be
sure to get a flogging from some other.</p>
<p>"Are not the settlers supplied with servants upon the first
arrival of the convicts? No, they are not; they must wait until all
the officers are served; they must wait until they can make
interest with some person in office to obtain one.</p>
<p>"Do you think the colony was in a more flourishing state when
you came away than when you went there first? Proportionately less.
There were about 4000 inhabitants when I went there; there were but
about 11,000 or 12,000 when I left it.</p>
<p>"Did the respectable part of the colony appear to you to be
increasing? There was very little respectable there."</p>
<p>WILLIAM RICHARDSON called in, and examined:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In what year did you go to Botany Bay? I do not recollect the
year; I went out with Governor Phillip in the first fleet.</p>
<p>"Till what year did you remain there? I came home last Christmas
was twelve months&mdash;Christmas 1810.</p>
<p>"Were the articles you bought for yourself expensive to you?
Very expensive; shoes 20/- a pair; for a shirt 20/-; sugar 7d. per
lb., and tea a dollar an ounce; spirits, generally 20/- a
bottle.</p>
<p>"Were those high prices owing to a temporary scarcity, or was it
a general thing? It was general for the poor; the rich could get it
cheaper.</p>
<p>"Are you able to account for these high prices? No, I cannot;
but from gentlemen having an opportunity of going aboard, and
buying things of the captain; we could not go on board because we
were always paid with copper coin, and therefore we could buy
nothing; if I had got &pound;10 soldier's pay I could not get one
individual thing from a ship."</p>
<p>[N.B.&mdash;This man had gone out as a convict for seven years,
and had enlisted as a soldier on becoming free.]</p>
<p>Mr. ROBERT CAMPBELL called in and examined:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In what year did you go to Botany Bay? In the year 1798, from
Bengal.</p>
<p>"To what year did you remain? I was there, with the exception of
two or three short intervals, down to the year 1810.</p>
<p>"For what purpose did you go? On a mercantile speculation, to
procure seal skins for the China market, and supply the colony with
necessary articles of merchandise from Bengal.</p>
<p>"Did you receive that encouragement from the Governor which you
had reason to expect? When I first arrived, in 1798, no class of
settlers were allowed to purchase any articles of merchandise but
the officers on the establishment, civil and military.</p>
<p>"Were you allowed to sell your merchandise at your own price?
No.</p>
<p>"In what manner were the prices fixed? In 1798, the officers
fixed the price of all articles of merchandise which I had then for
sale. In 1800 and from that time till my departure, in 1810, the
Governor fixed the price of spirits and wine; the other articles we
were allowed to dispose of to the best advantage.</p>
<p>"Had you an opportunity of seeing the manner in which the
merchandise sold to the military and civil officers was afterwards
retailed in the colony? Yes.</p>
<p>"At what profit were the articles retailed? Spirits sometimes at
500 per cent., at least; on other articles generally about from 50
to 75 per cent."</p>
<p>And, as these <i>gentlemen</i> were not honest, neither were
they virtuous in other respects. Let Dr. Lang speak:&mdash;"The
officers of the New South Wales Corps were neither all married nor
all virtuous men. Some of them, it is true, lived reputably with
their families, and set a virtuous example to the colony, even in
the worst times; but the greater number took female convicts of
prepossessing appearance under their protection, and employed them
occasionally in the retail business. In so small a community as
that of New South Wales, at the period in question, a liaison of
this kind could scarcely be concealed: decency was outraged on all
hands; and the prison population laughed at their superiors for
<i>outdoing</i> them in open profligacy, and naturally followed
their example.. .. .. A large proportion of the civil and military
officers of the settlement were unmarried men, of loose principles
and dissolute habits; who, setting at defiance the laws of God and
the opinions of virtuous men, lived in a state of open and avowed
profligacy, thereby setting an example which was but too generally
followed by the convicts, and the demoralising and debasing
influence of which was long widely perceptible throughout the
territory."</p>
<p>Although not in proper chronological order, it may be as well to
bring this unsavory subject to a close, to prevent re-opening.
Under the pernicious system introduced by the New South Wales
Corps, lands, houses, and property of every description, real and
personal, were bought and paid for in rum. The first large and
substantial hospital in Sydney was built by three gentlemen under a
contract with the Governor which gave them a monopoly of the sale
and importation of rum for a certain time; hence its title of 'The
Rum Hospital.' This happened in Governor Macquarie's time, and the
'rummy' contractors who entered into this agreement with him were
Messrs. D'Arcy Wentworth, Blaxcell, and Riley. The simple
conditions were that in return for erecting the building they were
to receive a certain quantity of rum from the King's store, and
have granted to them the right to purchase and retail 15,000
gallons of ardent spirits annually for four years!</p>
<p>The workmen of the colony were as much as possible paid in rum.
It is recorded of one of the officers of the New South Wales corps
that 100 acres of land having been distributed in half-acre
allotments as free grants amongst some soldiers of the regiment, he
planted a hogshead of rum upon the ground, and bought the whole
hundred acres with the contents of the hogshead. Years afterwards a
moiety of this land was sold in Sydney and realised &pound;20,000. Judge
Therry, in his 'Reminiscences,' when referring to this period,
says:&mdash;"Not only was concubinage thought no shame, but <i>the
sale of wives</i> was not an unfrequent practice. A present owner
of broad acres and large herds in New South Wales is the offspring
of an union strangely brought about by the purchase of a wife from
her husband for four gallons of rum!"</p>
<p>When Governor Hunter arrived he vainly attempted to check this
vicious barter. But the evil was too deeply rooted and the official
traffickers too strong in wealth and numbers to be easily
corrected. His successor. Governor King, sought to apply the
homeopathic principle of like curing like to the evil, but instead
of curing the disease by such a course he intensified it. He saw
that the military influence was dangerously active in the colony,
and he endeavoured to counterbalance it by attempting to bring
forward the emancipated convicts as competitors in the rum market
against the Corps, by granting to them licenses to sell. "Such
licenses," says Dr. Lang, "were accordingly dispensed with a
liberality and profusion above all praise; for even the chief
constable of Sydney, whose business it was to suppress
irregularity, had a license to promote it, under the Governor's
hand, by the sale of rum and other ardent liqours; and although the
chief jailer was not exactly permitted to convert the jail into a
grog-shop, he had a licensed house, in which he sold rum publicly
on his own behalf, right opposite the gaol door." Governor King's
successor, however, (Captain Bligh) applied the lancet to this
social gangrene with better effect. He came armed with full
instructions from the Home authorities, and immediately on his
arrival applied himself to the work of destroying the military
monopoly existing, and especially in the article of ardent spirits.
Governor Hunter had recommended the Imperial Government to withdraw
the New South Wales Corps, but the latter were powerful in the
colonial office across the water as well as in New South Wales, and
the recommendation was not adopted, although Governor Bligh
received instructions to prevent the landing of any spirits from
any vessel coming to the settlement, 'without your consent, or that
of our Governor-in-Chief for the time being, previously obtained
for that purpose.'</p>
<p>Within six months of his advent Governor Bligh issued the
following stringent General Order:&mdash;</p>
<p>"His Excellency the Governor regrets to find, by his late visit
through the colony, that the most calamitous evils have been
produced by persons bartering or paying spirits for grain of all
kinds, and the necessaries of life in general, and to labourers for
their hire; such proceedings depressing the industrious, and
depriving the settlers of their comforts. In order, therefore, to
remedy these grievous complaints, and to relieve the inhabitants
who have suffered by this traffic, he feels it his duty to put a
total stop to this barter in future, and to prohibit the exchange
of spirits or other liquors as payment for grain, animal food,
wearing apparel, or any other commodity whatever, to all
descriptions of persons in the colony and its dependencies. If a
prisoner is convicted before a bench of magistrates of any of the
offences above stated, he shall receive a punishment of one hundred
lashes, and be sentenced to hard labour for twelve months:&mdash;If
a settler, free by servitude, pardon, or emancipation, he is to be
deprived of all indulgences from the Crown, sentenced to three
months imprisonment, and to pay a fine of &pound;10 to the King:&mdash;If
a settler who came free into the colony, or any other free
inhabitants, masters, or any other descriptions of persons on board
of ships or vessels, they are to lose all indulgences granted them
by the Crown, and pay a fine of &pound;50 to the King; all of which
fines, on conviction, shall be levied by the provost-marshal, one
moiety to be given to the informer, and the other to be at the
disposal of the Government. His Excellency has the strongest
confidence, from the known distress of the colony in consequence of
this pernicious barter, that all officers, civil and military, will
be aiding and assisting in carrying this order into execution,
which ultimately must tend to relieve the distresses of the people,
and to give credit and stability to the settlement at large.</p>
<p>"By command of His Excellency,</p>
<p>"E. Griffin, Sec.</p>
<p>"Government House, Sydney,</p>
<p>"February 14th, 1807."</p>
<p>It was, undoubtedly, through his energetic efforts to suppress
this traffic that Governor Bligh was subsequently forcibly deposed.
He caused a notice to be served upon Mr. Macarthur to deliver up a
large still, which had arrived in a ship of which he was part
owner, in order that it (with another still which had come for a
Captain in the Corps) might be re-shipped to England. Macarthur at
first refused to comply, but subsequently the still was taken by
the Government officer. Then commenced a war between the Governor
(who had the misfortune to be in the hands of incompetent legal
advisers) and Macarthur. The latter was eventually charged with
sedition, but several of the military officers comprising the court
ousted the Judge-Advocate, against whose presidency Macarthur had
protested, and sought to pronounce judgment favourable to their
friend. This proceeding was, however, upset by the provost-marshal,
who procured a warrant for Macarthur in order to his being lodged
in gaol; the six friendly officers shortly thereafter also being
summoned to answer a charge of inciting to rebellion. His
Excellency had in the meantime sent for Major Johnston, commander
of the New South Wales Corps, who lived about four miles out of
town on his easily-acquired estate; but that gentleman excused
himself on the score of illness. On the following day, however, he
made his appearance at the military barracks, but instead of
supporting the Governor in preserving order he allowed the officers
of the corps to induce him to usurp the Government of the colony,
and place the Governor under arrest, himself marching to the
performance of the valorous deed at the head of the Regiment. The
Governor having been forcibly deposed. Major Johnston assumed the
reins of Government, to the unbounded delight of the military and
civil grog-sellers whose craft he had endangered; but to the
disgust of the respectable portion of the free populace, who were,
however, powerless to remedy matters. Subsequently Johnston was
ordered under arrest to England where he was tried and cashiered.
With his fall also fell the gallant New South Wales Corps, which
was disbanded, the 73rd Regiment, the lieutenant-colonel of which
was Lachlan Macquarie, relieving them. The officers had, of course,
feathered their nests in the colony and the majority of them
retired to sleep therein, or if not to sleep to hatch a little more
mischief. Their official power was gone, but the evil wrought by
money-grabbing, licentious practices still remained, and might be
seen working its way out in descendants half a century afterwards.
The fathers had eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth were set
on edge!</p>
<p>During the three years, 1793-4-5, which followed Governor
Phillip's departure, and for which term the settlement was
virtually in the hands of the New South Wales Corps&mdash;serving
its apprenticeship in a greater moral degradation than that imposed
by the presence and incoming of convicts&mdash;signs of material
progress were not wanting. At the end of 1795 there were 5000 acres
of land under cultivation; the horses had increased from 11 to 57,
the horned cattle from 23 to 229, the sheep from 105 to 1553, the
pigs from 43 to 1869, and the goats to 1427. The work of coastal
exploration had also been prosecuted in a small way; but the period
was chiefly remarkable for the breaking of all rules of decorum and
morality by the very men who should themselves have rightly
observed them and enforced their observance upon others under their
control.</p>

HUMANITY.</p>
<p>It was on the 7th September, 1795, that the new
Governor-in-Chief, Captain John Hunter, arrived, and, as may be
imagined, his arrival was hailed with joy by all the inhabitants of
the settlement, excepting the military officers and their friends.
He was a man of good judgment, benevolent character, and blameless
private life, but he lacked that firmness which was necessary to
enable him to successfully cope with the growing evils among the
military, and keep the convict element free from fresh taint. He
occupied the office until September, 1800, and during his
administration agriculture made considerable progress, the
prospects of the colony consequently becoming brighter. In order to
stimulate the cultivation of the soil he allotted to each of the
Government or military officers who had agricultural establishments
ten convicts as farm-servants and three as house servants; to each
free emigrant settler five convicts; to superintendents,
constables, and storekeepers, four each; to mariners who had become
settlers, two; to emancipated convicts, one; and to sergeants of
the New South Wales Corps, one each.</p>
<p>Most of the cattle shipped from England had died on the voyage,
but a number of horses, sheep, goats, pigs and poultry had been
introduced successfully. In 1796 the price of a cow was &pound;80, a
horse &pound;90, a sheep of the Cape breed &pound;7 10s., a breeding sow &pound;5,
geese and turkeys &pound;1 1s. each. Goat's flesh was sold at 1/6 per
lb., butter at 3/-, and two years later as much as 22/- were paid
for a common cup and saucer.</p>
<p>A small printing-press brought out in the First Fleet was used
for the first time by Governor Hunter, in 1795, for printing public
notices and Government orders, George Howe being the first
Government Printer. This event, together with the discovery of the
lost herd of cattle, the discovery of the Hunter River, and the
establishment of a settlement at Newcastle, the erection of the
first school and church (St. Phillip's), and further coastal
exploration, formed the most noteworthy events of this epoch. The
plan adopted by Governor Phillip of granting farms to emancipated
convicts of good character, as well as to free settlers, was
followed by Governor Hunter, and there can be no doubt that the
number of good-conduct men was thus largely increased.</p>
<p>Maritime discovery received great impulse and encouragement from
Governor Hunter, and he personally engaged in short voyages of
research between the southern portion of Van Diemen's Land and Port
Jackson. Collins states that he had been frequently heard to say
that, with a few small vessels, perhaps three or four, if he could
have obtained them, or if his instructions would have permitted his
building them, he would in the course of a short period have gained
some acquaintance with all that part of the coast which Captain
Cook had not an opportunity of examining minutely. It was under his
sanction and with his assistance that Messrs. Bass and Flinders
entered upon their adventurous work of coastal exploration,
resulting in the discovery of an inlet to the fertile district of
Illawarra, and, subsequently, of the Shoalhaven River, Twofold Bay,
and Wilson's Promontory. The first voyage of discovery was made in
a small whale boat called the Tom Thumb, only about eight feet
long, but the later voyages were made in a whale boat, manned by a
crew of volunteers from the ships in harbour, and having only six
weeks' provisions on board. But the adventurous explorers
lengthened out their provisions to eleven weeks and returned safely
at the end of that time, having covered a distance of 600 miles in
an open boat. In the following year, 1798, Governor Hunter
despatched these two enterprising sailors to follow up their
discoveries, and they then completely circumnavigated Van Diemen's
Land, Bass Straits being then found and named.</p>
<p>The Hunter River was discovered and proved navigable during
Governor Hunter's rule, and it received its name from him, while
the William and Paterson rivers were called after the
Lieutenant-Governor, and the locality around the harbour was called
Newcastle, from the abundance of pit-coal in its vicinity. The
importance of these discoveries to the opening colony, in a
commercial sense, was then but little understood.</p>
<p>It was only in after years that the fertility and extent of
these northern districts became the subject of thought and
conversation among the men in whose hands the work of settling the
country was placed.</p>
<p>The population of the colony at the close of 1800, when Governor
Hunter embarked for England, was 5,574 persons, including 776
children; in Norfolk Island (where a second settlement had been
formed by Governor Phillip) there were 961; making a total of 6,535
souls. Of this population about one-third was located in Sydney,
and the rest at Parramatta, Toongabbie and Castlehill, the land
about which was being gradually brought under cultivation.</p>
<p>The following figures relate to this time also:&mdash;Horses in
the colony 203, cattle 1,044, hogs 4,017, sheep, 6,124, goats
2,182, acres of land under cultivation 7,677. From February, 1792,
to September, 1800, the extent of land granted was as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By Governor Phillip.................... 3,389 acres<br>
By Lieut.-Governor Grose.......... 10,674 "<br>
By Lieut.-Governor Patterson........ 4,965 "<br>
By Governor Hunter....................28,650 "<br>
Total.........................................47,678 acres.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Governor Hunter left the colony at the close of 1800, and
shortly after his arrival in England he was appointed to the
command of the Venerable, seventy-four. One event which happened
while he was serving in that capacity will shew what manner of man
he was. He was cruising with his vessel in Torbay when one of the
seamen accidentally fell overboard. Captain Hunter ordered the
vessel to be put about to pick the man up, but in executing the
manoeuvre she missed stays, ran ashore, and was wrecked. Hunter was
afterwards brought before a court-martial and tried for the loss of
the vessel. During the trial, when asked what had induced him to
put the ship about in such circumstances, he replied that "he
considered the life of a British seaman of more value than any ship
in His Majesty's navy." The brave man&mdash;not less brave because
humane&mdash;was honourably acquitted, and was afterwards promoted
to the rank of rear-admiral.</p>
<p>Hunter died in Scotland, the land of his birth, at an advanced
age.</p>

PRODUCE&mdash;POPULATION AND OTHER STATISTICS.</p>
<p>Governor King followed Hunter, and he administered the
Government until August, 1806. In manner and disposition he was the
opposite of his predecessor, being rough and uncouth, and lacking
in perseverance. It was during his administration that the
rum-selling business reached its full vigour, and he was powerless
to check it. Concerning this period Dr. Lang writes:&mdash;"A
general dissolution of morals and a general relaxation of penal
discipline were the result of a state of things so outrageously
preposterous. Neither marrying nor giving in marriage was thought
of in the colony; and as the arm of the civil power was withered
under the blasting influence of the miserable system that
prevailed, the police of the colony was wretchedly administered,
and virtuous industry was neither encouraged nor protected. Bands
of bushrangers or runaway convicts traversed the country in all
directions, and, entering the houses of the defenceless settlers in
open day, committed fearful atrocities."</p>
<p>Governor King, who had served under Captain Phillip on the first
voyage to the colony, had done good service in the establishment of
Norfolk Island, but during his administration all the good work he
had then accomplished was undone by the temporary abandonment of
that subordinate settlement, which had made considerable
advancement, and upon which a large sum of money and much labour
had been expended.</p>
<p>The year 1804 was rendered remarkable by a conspiracy among the
convicts at Castlehill. They were 250 strong, but were defeated in
fifteen minutes by Major Johnston at the head of twenty-four
soldiers of the New South Wales Corps. Sixteen of the convicts were
killed during the 'engagement,' twelve were wounded, and thirty
were made prisoners. The rest surrendered at discretion. Five of
the ringleaders were afterwards executed.</p>
<p>Under Governor King the Female Orphan School was founded, the
first issue of copper coin took place, the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>
(the first Australian newspaper) was published, a number of free
emigrant settlers, (chiefly from the Scottish border) arrived in
the colony on free passages and received a grant of 100 acres of
land each and rations from the King's Stores.</p>
<p>A glance at some of the 'General Orders' published in the
<i>Gazette</i> is sufficient to shew that it was simply an organ
for the powerful classes. These general orders regulated the words,
the habits, the conduct, and almost the looks of the people; they
fixed the time to rise and go to bed; enacted that 'idlers' were to
be imprisoned and kept at hard labour; that persons guilty of
seditious words or actions were to receive exemplary punishment,
and their houses to be demolished; that free persons neglecting to
attend musters were to be treated as vagrants and sent to hard
labour. The profits of both importers and retailers were also
regulated by general orders. Those of the former were not to exceed
one hundred per cent., and those of the latter ten per
cent.&mdash;the difference in favour of the former class proving
how tender the officials were to themselves, they being the
principal importers.</p>
<p>It was during Governor King's administration also that the
attempt was made to found a convict settlement at Port Phillip; two
vessels&mdash;one with stores for three years, and the other with
300 convicts, 50 marines, a few free settlers, twenty-five women,
ten children, and the proper complement of officers&mdash;being
sent out by Lord Hobart, Secretary of State for the Colonies, who
desired to immortalise his name in this way. The site of the
settlement was chosen at Point Nepean, near the heads, and the
people all landed; but finding that the site was unfavorable
Lieutenant-Colonel Collins, the officer in charge, represented to
Governor King the desirability of removing the settlement to Van
Diemen's Land, and, permission being granted, the settlement was
removed accordingly. This was, perhaps, the event of greatest
importance under the rule of Governor King. Subsequently the
population of Van Diemen's Land was increased by the transportation
of convicts from Sydney, and not a few of the free Norfolk
Islanders also found a home there, when, much to their
disappointment, the settlement on that island was broken up. The
records of the early days of Tasmanian colonization resemble in
their general features those of New South Wales&mdash;being periods
of hardship, privation, famine, crime, and conflicts with the
natives.</p>
<p>The month of March, 1806, was rendered remarkable by the
occurrence of the heaviest flood that up to that time had visited
the Hawkesbury. The rain continued for nearly a month without
intermission, and flooded the country, causing not a little loss of
life and immense destruction of property. Two hundred stacks of
wheat were stated to have been carried out to sea, many of them
covered with poultry, pigs, and other animals, which had taken
refuge upon them. The total loss of property was estimated at
&pound;35,000, and the unfortunate settlers only escaped from the waters
to find starvation staring them in the face. But the Government
came to their assistance, and by regulating the consumption of food
generally, made provision for their immediate wants, compelling
those who had saved their grain to share it with their less
fortunate neighbours. During the period of scarcity resulting from
this sudden overflowing of the waters, the price of the two-pound
loaf rose to 5s., and wheat was hardly procurable at 80s. per
bushel.</p>
<p>"The six years of Governor King's rule," says Bennett,
"notwithstanding the occurrence of serious civil disturbances and
the prevalence of drinking habits to a degree probably never before
witnessed in any community, were marked by a steady advancement in
the development of the material resources of the colony. The
sealing trade and whale fishery were carried on with energy and
profit, the foundation of what proved a lucrative intercourse with
New Zealand and the South Sea Islands was opened up, new
settlements were formed, and a large quantity of land was brought
under cultivation, and pastoral enterprise received an impetus
which, a few years after, placed the growing of fine wool amongst
the most extensive and lucrative of colonial pursuits. The progeny
of the choice merino rams imported some years before by Mr. John
Macarthur had gradually but steadily continued to improve, and at
length to supersede the worthless breed of sheep which had been
introduced, chiefly at the public expense, from India and the Cape
of Good Hope. The natural woods of the colony were found to be
useful for something more than firewood, and brewing, salt-making,
boat, ship and carriage building commenced."</p>
<p>There was a funny side to Governor King's character, and he
occasionally exhibited that side to those under him. A story is
told illustrative of his inclination for practical joking. He was
one day standing under the verandah of Government House, when a
man, who had once been in the marines, presented himself and
petitioned for a grant of land. The Governor recognised the
petitioner, and questioned him thus: "You have been a marine?"
"Yes, please your Excellency," replied the man. "Can you go through
the manual exercise yet?" enquired the Governor, smiling. "Yes,
please your Excellency," was the reply. "Stand at ease, then," said
the Governor, and the man obeyed with alacrity. "Shoulder arms!"
"Right about face!" were the next commands, each of which the man
performed&mdash;pleased no doubt, though perhaps a little
astonished, at his Excellency's playfulness. While standing thus he
received a final order&mdash;"March!" and the now discomforted
marine stepped out on the return journey, while the Governor turned
into his apartments laughing at his little joke. It is said,
however, that the man afterwards received his grant of land from
the Governor as a reward for his obedience to orders.</p>
<p>In one of the old records relating to this period I find the
following significant statement:&mdash;Governor King, just before
his resignation, gave Governor Bligh a grant of 1000 acres of land;
and subsequently, Governor Bligh gave Mrs. King a grant of 1000
acres. There was no joking about this sort of mutual
accommodation.</p>
<p>From the Official Returns for 1806 the following statistical
notices are extracted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br>
<br>
ACRES<br>
<br>
Quantity of land occupied by Government or<br>

</blockquote>
<p>The administration of Governor King was barren of good fruit,
owing in great measure to the strong antagonism of the military
'ring' whose influence he was powerless to break. It is said that
the baneful Corps had something to do with shortening the period of
his service in the colony.</p>
<p>The population of the colony and its dependencies at the period
of Governor King's departure (August, 1806) was about 9000, of
which 7,200 were in New South Wales, 528 at Hobart Town, and 1084
at Norfolk Island.</p>

<p>Governor Bligh succeeded Governor King, and imparted a vigour
into the conduct of public affairs which furnished a marked
contrast to the policy of hesitation pursued by King. His conduct
under the mutiny of the ship Bounty, of which vessel he was in
command, fully proved that he was a man of dauntless courage and
stern determination. If he had been a man of tact as well, his term
of office would have been fruitful of more pleasure to himself and
more immediate good to the colony over which he was sent to
preside. He was full of zeal, but his zeal being accompanied
frequently by excessive bluntness and outbursts of passion, it
occasionally brought forth evil rather than good. Judging from his
conduct towards them at the start, it may be inferred that Governor
King, who had not then left the colony, had given him a fair
knowledge of the unscrupulous character of the military and
official hucksters, some of whose movements have already been
recorded, and he was prepared to play at cross purposes with them
from the commencement of his rule.</p>
<p>He manifested a violent dislike towards Captain John Macarthur,
whom he evidently looked upon as the chief sinner, the leading
spirit, in the camp of spoliators, whose names were being daily
cursed by the poor and struggling settlers of the colony. Within a
month of the Governor's landing Macarthur proceeded to Government
House in order, as he afterwards put it, "to speak to him of my
affairs." He sought to button-hole the Governor when walking in the
garden, but the Governor gave him to understand, in language not of
the mildest kind, that his affairs were of very secondary
importance indeed, and roared out at him&mdash;"What have I to do
with your sheep, sir? what have I to do with your cattle? I have
heard of your concerns, sir; you have got 5000 acres of land in the
finest situation in the country; but, by God, you shan't keep
it?"</p>
<p>From this out Macarthur and the Governor were sworn foes. The
former deserved some credit for his energy in the sheep-breeding
line, but there were two sides to his character, and the Governor
looked at the side which was certainly the largest&mdash;the side
which revealed his connection with a clique who have been described
as 'clever, not very scrupulous, and wealthy men, of whom John
Macarthur was undoubtedly the cleverest, the most wealthy, and
perhaps in some respects the most unscrupulous.' It was not to be
supposed that such a man would submit to a snubbing with impunity,
especially as he was backed up by powerful influence in England,
which had secured for him, on representations that he would be able
in time to supply the British woollen manufacturers with all the
fine wool required, a grant of 5000 acres of land, with shepherds
and 'every other reasonable and proper means' for advancing his
object. And as Macarthur was the leader of the class who had been
bound together so closely by the promptings of self-interest, war
with him meant war with that class&mdash;the officers and
ex-officers of the New South Wales Corps. The Governor at once
proceeded to deal heavy blows at the spirit monopoly established by
these men, among whom he at once became most unpopular, although by
the small settlers and the wealthy emancipists he was held in high
esteem.</p>
<p>The open rupture which took place between the Governor and the
Macarthur 'clan,' and which resulted in an act of rebellion and the
deposition of the Governor has already been briefly sketched.</p>
<p>The events following Macarthur's liberation from gaol by his
fellow officers are thus described by the Governor in the evidence
given by him before the court martial at which Colonel Johnston was
tried, in the year 1811:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Immediately after the order for the release of Macarthur, there
followed an operation of the main guard close to the gate of
Government House, and the regiment marched down from the barracks,
led on by Major Johnson and the other officers, with colours flying
and music playing as they advanced to the house. Within a few
minutes after the house was surrounded; the soldiers quickly broke
into all parts of it, and arrested all the magistrates, Mr. Gore,
the provost-marshal; Mr. Griffin, my secretary; and Mr. Fulton, the
chaplain. I had just time to call to my orderly-sergeant to have my
horses ready while I went upstairs to put on my uniform, when on my
return, as I was standing on the staircase waiting for my servant
with my sword, I saw a number of soldiers rushing upstairs with
their muskets and fixed bayonets, as I conceived to seize my
person. I retired instantly into a back room to defeat their
object, and to deliberate on the means to be adopted for the
restoration of my authority, which in such a critical situation
could only be accomplished by my getting into the interior of the
country adjacent to the Hawkesbury, where I knew the whole body of
people would flock to my standard. To this situation I was pursued
by the soldiers, and after experiencing much insult was conducted
below by Lieutenant Minchin, who told me that Major Johnston was
waiting for me. We passed together into the drawing-room, every
part being crowded with soldiers under arms, many of whom appeared
to be intoxicated.</p>
<p>"I then received a letter brought by Lieutenant Moore, and
signed by Major Johnston, (calling himself Lieutenant-Governor),
requiring me to resign my authority, and to submit to the arrest
under which he placed me, which I had scarcely perused, when a
message was delivered to me that Major Johnston wished to speak to
me in the adjoining room, at the door of which he soon afterwards
appeared, surrounded by his officers and soldiers; and in terms
much to the same effect as his letter, he there verbally confirmed
my arrest. Martial law was proclaimed, my secretary and my friends
were prevented from seeing me, and I was left alone with my
daughter and another lady.</p>
<p>"By Major Johnston's orders several persons seized my cabinet
and papers, with my commission, instructions, and the great seal of
the colony. These were locked up in a room guarded by two
sentinels, and several others were placed around the house to
prevent my escape.</p>
<p>"The same evening committees were formed with a pretended view
of examining into my government, but in reality to discover all
such persons as were attached to me. In this Macarthur took an
active part. On the following day Lieut. Moore came with Major
Johnston's orders and carried away my swords and what firearms he
found in the house; at noon three volleys were fired by the
soldiers and twenty-one guns from the battery, while the royal
standard was displayed; His Majesty's Commissary, the
Provost-Marshal, the Judge-Advocate, and the Chaplain were
suspended from their offices; all the magistrates were dismissed,
and others appointed in their room; the most extraordinary and
mutinous proclamations were issued, and even my broad pendant as
Commodore on the station was ordered by Major Johnston to be
struck. Thus was the mutiny complete; those who were concerned in
it had got possession of the government, had turned out all the
civil officers and substituted others in their room, and imposed on
me an arrest which continued from the time of the mutiny till the
20th February, 1809."</p>
<p>It may be mentioned here, as a rather curious fact that Governor
Bligh's arrest took place on the twentieth anniversary of the
foundation of the settlement&mdash;26th January,1808.</p>
<p>Some of Bligh's enemies have charged him with cowardice on the
occasion of his arrest, declaring that when the soldiers went to
Government House he ran to the servants' room and hid under a bed;
but this was clearly disproved by him at Major Johnson's trial in
England.</p>
<p>After the Governor's arrest Major Johnston assumed the reins of
Government, but the very men who had made a catspaw of him in
leading the rebellion were the first to thwart his efforts to
properly conduct public affairs. Macarthur was virtually the
Governor, although only holding office as Colonial Secretary, to
which position he had appointed himself. Every officer and
magistrate who was known to be favorable to Bligh was dismissed
from office, and personal friends, and members of 'the mess,' were
put in their places. Even the chaplain. Rev. Henry Fulton, was
suspended, the meek-faced rascals who had usurped authority and
power having issued the following pious 'General Order':&mdash;</p>
<p>"The Rev. Henry Fulton, is suspended from discharging in future
the office of Chaplain in the colony."</p>
<p>"The officers, civil and military, are ordered to attend divine
worship on Sunday next, at the New Church; and every well-disposed
inhabitant is requested to be present to join in thanks to Almighty
God, for his merciful interposition in their favour, by relieving
them without bloodshed from the awful situation in which they stood
before the memorable 26th instant."</p>
<p>Referring to this case, Bennet says&mdash;"The fate of this
gentleman was singular. He had been exiled from Ireland for some
participation in the rebellion of 1798. Here, on the contrary, he
was punished for his loyalty!" He was father of one of the first
settlers on the western side of the Blue Mountains, which had not
at that time been crossed, and the name of Fulton is yet held in
the highest esteem in the Bathurst and O'Connell Plains
district.</p>
<p>The provisional Johnston-Macarthur Government carried matters
with a rather free hand. They sent the deposed provost-marshal to
gaol for a term, and sentenced the attorney who had drawn up the
indictment against Macarthur to seven years' transportation. Thus
they dealt with their enemies; but their friends they rewarded. Rum
from the King's store; permits to land and licenses to retail
ardent spirits; grants of land and Government cattle&mdash;these
were distributed largely to that part of the free population who
expressed approval of their measures; while friends not free were
freely pardoned and received lesser indulgences. "In this way,"
says Dr. Lang, "a number of persons of the worst character were
turned loose upon the colony, to the great annoyance of the free
settlers, and as an idea also got abroad among the convicts that
the colony had now become free, and that it was no longer
obligatory to labour, the result was a state of anarchy that
produced a general neglect of the cultivation of the soil, and was
otherwise distressing in the extreme to the well-disposed part of
the population."</p>
<p>Governor Bligh was kept in confinement until he was superseded
by Lieutenant-Colonel Foveaux, who had returned from England with
the appointment of Lieutenant-Governor, and who in turn was
superseded by Colonel Patterson. Bligh was then offered the command
of a vessel to proceed to England, and after delays of little
historical interest he sailed for England on 12th May, 1810, about
six months after the arrival of the next Governor proper of the
colony&mdash;Macquarie.</p>
<p>As previously recorded, Johnston was subsequently tried before a
court-martial in England and cashiered; and Macarthur was
prohibited for eight years from returning to the colony.</p>
<p>And the New South Wales Corps, or the 102nd Regiment, were
ordered home; but not a few of the officers stayed behind to live
upon the wealth which they had accumulated by extortion, violence
and fraud. If for nothing else, Governor Bligh deserves to be held
in everlasting remembrance by the colonists for the part he played
in breaking up this band of wholesale plunderers.</p>

<p>Governor Macquarie followed Bligh, and he assumed the Government
of the colony on 28th December, 1809. Briefly put, he was a man of
energetic action, self-reliance and determination, but a poor
financier; a man of good intentions but terribly self-conceited,
his chief weakness being the delight of affixing his name to
everything requiring a name in the colony, whether public
buildings, streets, rivers, or mountains. His hobby was bricks and
mortar, and he rode it most unmercifully. The records show that
during his administration, extending over twelve years, he caused
to be erected in New South Wales upwards of two hundred buildings
and in Van Diemen's Land about fifty, on the front stone of nearly
every one of which the name of 'Macquarie' was carved. Yet, not
without reason, his era has by many been looked upon as the
commencement of the prosperity and rising greatness of New South
Wales; for he did more than any other Governor to open up the yet
unexplored country and develop its natural resources.</p>
<p>One of Macquarie's first acts was the issue of a proclamation
declaring the King's displeasure at the mutinous proceedings which
had just previously taken place; and this was speedily followed by
another declaring null and void all the acts of the interim
Government. All the officers who had been removed when Bligh was
arrested were reinstated, and the power of the once dominant clique
having been completely broken, the Governor himself being colonel
of the regiment of the line which formed the garrison (the 73rd),
the small settlers and emancipists were encouraged to hope for a
season of quiet enjoyment of rights and privileges to which they
had long been strangers. Their hope was more than fulfilled, as
will be seen further on.</p>
<p>Macquarie's administration was chiefly remarkable for (1) the
elevation of the emancipist class into higher positions of social,
civil, and political life; (2) the stimulus given to agricultural
pursuits; and (3) the successful exploration and settlement of new
country.</p>
<p>He had a great partiality for the emancipated convicts, and went
to extremes in seeking to raise them to the highest level of
respectability. Within a month of his arrival he appointed to the
office of the magistracy a Scotch convict named Thompson, who had
amassed not a little wealth by dealing, and who, although possessed
of considerable natural ability, was nevertheless not a man of good
reputation. This act naturally gave great offence to the
'aristocracy,' whose pride and position had thus been literally
dragged in the dust.</p>
<p>They protested and threatened, but the Governor met all their
objections by the simple remark that there were but two classes in
the colony to choose from&mdash;those who had been transported, and
those who ought to have been. As a further mark of favour Thompson
was admitted to the table of the Governor, and to that of the
officers of the 73rd Regiment, although the members of the mess
went as far as they dare in the direction of resistance. Other
similar appointments followed, the object of making them evidently
being to shew the convict class that good behaviour would bring its
reward. Had the Governor used wise discrimination in distributing
his favours the good results hoped for might have followed; but he
was not wise, and the opposition of the wealthy free colonists
appeared but to goad him to excess of foolishness. His whole
conduct towards the convicts may be described as foolish and
dangerous favouritism, and one writer has declared that 'the
circumstance of being notorious for a life of open and outrageous
profligacy was no impediment to promotion or employment under the
government of Major-General Macquarie,' who at times appears to
have acted on the principle that 'prosperous vice ought to be
rewarded and encouraged.'</p>
<p>One of the first collisions which Macquarie had with the
officers of his government occurred in connection with the
establishment of the Supreme Court, shortly after the arrival in
the colony of the first judge, on account of certain attorneys who
had originally been transported, but whose sentences had expired,
claiming the right to practice in the court. The Governor wrote to
the judge strongly recommending the petition of the emancipist
attorneys; but the judge declared that he would not admit as
attorneys, nor administer the oath to persons, who had been
transported to the colony as felons. The business of the court was
suspended; Macquarie reported the judge to Earl Bathurst, then
Secretary of State for the Colonies; and the strait-laced judge was
recalled 'on account of conduct which could admit of no
justification.' Thus, in the highest quarters, Macquarie fought for
and with those who wished to regain the positions which they had
lost in the old country.</p>
<p>But he did not rest with this, and here it is that his folly was
made more apparent. From the first he appears to have discouraged
the influx of free settlers, a steady though small stream of which
had set in towards the colony, the attraction doubtless being the
liberal offers of grants of land and cheap labour made by the Home
Government to those who chose to try their fortunes at 'Botany
Bay,' those who came being for the most part small capitalists; and
while doing this he did everything in his power to 'bring on' the
convicts who were not in chains.</p>
<p>Referring to this period, Bennett says:&mdash;"The opposition
which the wealthier portion of the free settlers shewed to
Macquarie's policy of elevating some of the emancipists to the
magisterial bench and to social equality with themselves, was met
on his part by daily-increasing-manifestations of favour towards
those on whose support he was in a great measure driven to rely. He
saw that his predecessor had been deposed by a few wealthy
colonists and their military friends, and self-preservation
suggested the desirability of raising up a class on whom he could
calculate with certainty; and whose numbers, rapidly increasing
wealth, and daily extending influence, would be sure to be exerted
in opposition to those who had so long been dominant. With the view
of encouraging the class of emancipists, Macquarie did not hesitate
to depart from the practice of his predecessors, which had been to
give grants of land only to free or freed persons of good
character. His opponents say that he bestowed farms on all whose
sentences had expired, without requiring the slightest evidence
that they were worthy of such favours. Many of these
men&mdash;indeed, the majority of them&mdash;averse to the practice
of honest industry, soon disposed of land so easily acquired. A few
quarts of rum, or any other means of gratifying their passion for
present and sensual indulgence, offered too great a temptation to
be resisted by people of their habits and character.. .. .. .. ..
.. .. . The opposition he manifested to the introduction of a free
immigrant population and his avowed opinions in favour of the
prison class, were so strong as not only to put a complete stop to
the influx of the former during the greater part of his
administration, but to create and sustain an opinion among the
latter that they alone had any right in the colony, and that the
others were intruders whose presence ought scarcely to be
tolerated."</p>
<p>Macquarie distributed his land grant favours with a most liberal
hand, and identified himself so closely with the emancipists' cause
as to incur the undying enmity of the wealthy freemen, or
'exclusives,' who harassed him continually, and whose murmuring
even found utterances in the House of Commons. They formulated
charges against him of various kinds, and a special commissioner
(Mr. Bigge) was despatched by Lord Bathurst to inquire into the
condition of the colony. That gentleman's report was very
exhaustive and voluminous, and to it may be attributed Macquarie's
recall, it being considered that three things, at least, had been
proved against him, namely:&mdash;excessive expenditure upon
useless or unnecessary buildings; the want of proper checks, and
the consequent waste in the disposal of the public stores and
materials; and the glaring disregard of cleanliness, propriety, and
decency in the management of the female convicts. The list of
public works executed under his orders fills ten closely-printed
pages of a Parliamentary Report, and includes not fewer than 250
items, the chief being barracks for troops, stores for provisions,
hospitals, public offices, churches, school-houses, quays, wharfs,
watch-houses and police offices. During his administration 276
miles of road were constructed, with all necessary wooden bridges,
some of them being of large dimensions.</p>
<p>But although Macquarie's efforts to elevate the emancipists were
not directly successful, in after years the fruit appeared, and the
'tainted herd' became merged in the general mass of the population;
their descendants, if not themselves, enjoying all the privileges
and blessings obtainable by the descendants of the 'Pure Merinos'
who had bleated so loudly during Macquarie's rule; so that as
to-day one class stands cheek by jowl with the other in private,
social, and public life, not even a policeman of the olden time (if
there be one living) can tell the difference between them.</p>
<p>In no direction was Macquarie's energy more vigorously exercised
than in improving the condition of the rural population. From the
first he took a deep interest in their welfare, and shortly after
his arrival personally went through most of the country districts,
in order to see for himself the condition of the people and what
improvements in their habits, mode of living, and pursuits could be
effected. The result of his observations was published in a General
Order on his return to head quarters, and the following paragraph
from that Order will shew the condition of affairs rural during the
first year of his administration:&mdash;"His Excellency cannot
forbear expressing his regret that the settlers in general have not
paid that attention to domestic comfort which they ought to do, by
erecting commodious residences for themselves, and suitable housing
for the reception of their grain and cattle; nor can he refrain
from observing on the miserable clothing of many of the people,
whose means of providing decent apparel, at least, are sufficiently
obvious to leave them without any excuse for that neglect. His
Excellency therefore earnestly recommends and trusts that they will
pay more attention to those very important objects; and, by a
strict regard to economy and temperance, that they will, on his
annual tour, enable him to give a more unqualified approbation to
their exertions."</p>
<p>And he did not simply preach to them. He acted with and for
them, working to bring them within easy reach of the only market
available by improving the roads leading thereto, and which had
received but scant attention before his arrival. He also set an
example in the building line, already referred to, and employed
nearly all the skilled labour available from the ranks of the
Government; but the buildings being for the most part in and around
Sydney, those settlers who lived away from the centre did not
derive any advantage from the erections. Even when, through his
vigorous encouragement of exploration and settlement, the
operations of the settlers were carried beyond the mountains, he
did not awake to the fact that he was preserving a monopoly of the
labour requisite to the carrying out of his advice; and in this way
he really hampered the general building work, private enterprise
being cramped for want of the assistance of the mechanics who were
kept by the Governor under his own eye while carrying out his
building hobby. The settlers complained loudly, but to no
purpose&mdash;all the skilled labour was kept in Sydney and the
other towns which were growing up, and an official account shews
the Governor's folly in this respect.</p>
<p>Of the skilled mechanics who arrived in the colony during the
years 1814 to 1820, the Government retained 269 blacksmiths out of
284; out of 337 carpenters, all but 16; and out of 284 bricklayers
and brickmakers, all but five. Hence the perpetuation of bark and
slab hovels, and the slow growth of private buildings with any
pretensions to decency or stability in fact or appearance. With
this exception, however, Macquarie's efforts to improve the
condition of the settlers&mdash;immigrants and emancipists
alike&mdash;were honest and earnest, and they were fruitful of
good, a stimulus being given to intelligent cultivation of the
soil, which not only benefitted the individual settler, but the now
rapidly developing colony whose history was being built up. He
granted cattle, sheep and goats from the Government herds, to be
paid for in grain, with eighteen months' credit, and offered every
inducement possible to the rural population to rise to a higher
level in profitable industry and social life.</p>
<p>The work of geographical discovery in which Governor Macquarie
engaged, and which he pursued with remarkable determination and
vigour, was in itself sufficiently meritorious to place his name on
the first page of the history of Australian colonization. When he
assumed the Government the colony consisted simply of a narrow
strip of land, extending about eighty miles along the coast to the
north and south of Port Jackson, and bounded on the west by the
hitherto impenetrable barrier of the Blue Mountains.</p>
<p>Repeated attempts had been made to pierce this barrier, but
without success. The first attempt was made by Captain Paterson,
the African traveller, in 1793, but he met so many obstacles in the
shape of impassable precipices, &amp;c., that he returned after
having covered only a dozen miles from the junction of the Grose
and the Hawkesbury Rivers. About this time other unsuccessful
attempts were also made by Lieutenant Dawes, Captain Tench, and
others. In 1794 one Hacking, quarter-master of the Sirius, essayed
the task, but returned foiled after penetration about 30 miles
beyond the Hawkesbury. Two years later Mr. Bass, the discoverer of
the straits bearing his name, made the attempt, entering upon the
work with ropes, ladders, cords, iron hooks, and every other
appliance which he deemed necessary for accomplishing the task; but
after fifteen days of unparalleled fatigue and suffering from
hunger and thirst, he also returned defeated and
crestfallen&mdash;the country to the westward of the giant hills
remaining still secret and mysterious. And when the mountains were
pierced a little later on the record of the fact was too strange
for acceptance, and it was cast aside by the authorities as
unworthy of credit. In 1799, during Governor Hunter's
administration, a convict named Wilson, who had lived for several
years with the blacks, undertook the work of exploration, taking
with him a free servant of the Governor and four other convicts, to
carry provisions and render other assistance.</p>
<p>That Wilson succeeded, not only in crossing the Blue Mountains,
but in penetrating the country westward as far as the Lachlan
river, does not admit of doubt, and the writer believes that to him
must the credit be given of being the first white man to scale the
heights and pierce the gloom of that ponderous curtain of rocks and
trees which for so many years had hidden the beautiful lands of the
western interior from the eyes of the men who had assumed
possession of Australian soil. On his return he gave to the
Governor an account of the distance he had travelled, the nature of
the country through which he had passed, and the adventures he had
met with&mdash;and his story, although discredited by everyone but
the Governor, in after years received ample confirmation. He
estimated the most remote place which he reached as 130 miles
south-west by west from Parramatta, and said that eighty miles west
he had found coal and limestone, and twenty miles beyond, to the
north, an open and thinly wooded country. The stream at the
termination of his journey he described as almost as wide as the
Hawkesbury, and sluggish, but running apparently from south-east to
north-west. It was apparently this fact which caused the wise men
and mighty of that day to discredit Wilson's story. They could not
understand that a large river should run backwards from the sea,
and their faith was then as small a quantity as their knowledge and
experience. They afterward learned that the river did really run
inland, but it is questionable whether they even then bethought
them of Wilson's wonderful services and story. So little value was
attached to the account given by this enterprising convict that not
only was no action taken to follow up his work, but no authentic
narrative thereof was preserved. Had Governor Hunter been cast in
Macquarie's mould, who knows but that his name would have been
perpetuated in the waters of a river in the west, instead of one in
the north; that Macquarie Plains would have been Hunter's, and that
the City of the Plains&mdash;Bathurst&mdash;would have been twenty
years older than it is!</p>
<p>Between this time and 1813, two other attempts were made to
cross the mountains, but without success, and then followed the
courageous and successful journey of Messrs. Gregory Blaxland, W.
C. Wentworth and William Lawson&mdash;three names which will live
as long as the mountains which they crossed shall stand, although
the credit given to them of being the first white men to accomplish
the feat is not properly theirs. In more senses that one the debt
the colonists owe to the convicts is greater than that they owe to
the free men for whom those convicts worked.</p>
<p>The effort of the three gentlemen named was rendered necessary
by the rapid increase of the live stock of the colony, which at
that time amounted to 65,121 sheep, 21,543 cattle, and 65,121
horses, and the limited pasturage of which had been rendered more
limited by reason of a serious and long-protracted drought. The
exploring party ascended the mountain ridge that abuts upon Emu
Plains on the banks of the Nepean River; and following that ridge
in all its multitudinous windings, they at length, after
encountering great difficulties and hardships, reached its
termination at Mount York, twenty-five miles due west of Emu
Plains, and which looked down upon the valley afterwards called the
Vale of Clwyd. This was the limit of their discoveries, and they
returned to Sydney to report progress to the Governor, who without
loss of time despatched Deputy-Surveyor Evans to follow up their
track and explore the unknown country to the westward. The result
of this expedition was the discovery of the famous Bathurst Plains,
and the Macquarie and Lachlan Rivers.</p>
<p>Three years later the Governor despatched the Surveyor-General
of the colony, Mr. John Oxley, on an exploring expedition on the
Lachlan, and he traced that river down for upwards of 400 miles to
what he considered its termination in extensive morasses; although
had he continued his journey for a few hours longer he would have
discovered where it joined the Murrumbidgee, one of the finest
rivers of interior. It was on his return journey that he crossed
that fine tract of country, Wellington Valley. During the following
year Oxley followed the Macquarie until it lost itself in the level
country, spreading out, as he supposed, as the commencement of a
great inland sea.</p>
<p>In the meantime the country to the south was being explored and
opened up by Hume and others, and two-years before Macquarie's
departure the discoveries in that direction had been pushed as far
as the Murrumbidgee. In these journeys Goulburn plains and a great
part of the county of Argyle was opened up. By these important
discoveries the area of the colony was increased enormously, and
new sources of wealth were brought within reach of those
enterprising colonists who were panting for larger room and freer
air.</p>
<p>Macquarie took the greatest interest in this work of
exploration, and it is more than probable that he would himself
have been found pushing through bushes, fording rivers, and scaling
rocks in the search for new country, if his presence had not been
necessary at headquarters. As a proof of the interest he took in
the work, as soon as the discoveries were made known, he saddled
horse and visited the new land to the west and to the south, going
as far as Bathurst in one trip and Goulburn in the other. The full
account of these discoveries, which formed such an important
stepping-stone to the accomplishment of that colonization which has
been one of the chief events of the nineteenth century, will be
given when the subject of life in the interior is being dealt with
further on. Suffice it now to say that under Macquarie's
administration the key was found of that barrier which had shut out
from the world a land containing within itself possibilities of
wealth and greatness second to those enjoyed by no other country in
the world.</p>
<p>It has been well said of Macquarie by one writer:&mdash;"He
found New South Wales a gaol, and he left it a colony; he found
Sydney a village and he left it a city; he found a population of
idle prisoners, paupers, and paid officials, and he left a large
free community, thriving on the produce off flocks and the labour
of convicts." Yet, even then the tone of society in the population
centres was horrible. There was no educated or honourable class, no
church worthy of the name; no schools except for the wealthy, and
those taught chiefly by convicts; there were slave masters who sold
rum, and slaves who drank it; an autocrat surrounded by parasites,
whose fortunes he could make by a stroke of the pen. Virtue and
honour were as scarce as freedom, and wretchedness and prosperity
embraced in the persons of individuals and the community.</p>
<p>Macquarie had been in the colony about ten years when the
commissioner of inquiry, Mr. John Thomas Biggs, was sent out from
England to report fully upon the condition of life in the new
possessions, the institution of this inquiry being partly the
result of representations made in a work published by Mr. W.
Wentworth, during a visit paid by him to England for the purpose of
being called to the Bar. The inquiry occupied two years, and its
publication for the use of the House of Commons had considerable
effect in directing the attention of the British public to the
resources of Australia, eventually leading to the influx of a
superior class of emigrants; and from this date there was a
marvellous outreach towards prosperity.</p>
<p>The first fitful throbbings indicating the death agony of the
penal system of the colony were now heard, and the first breathings
of that free national life now in full vigour were observed. When
Macquarie was recalled in the latter part of 1821, after having
held the reins of government for twelve years, the colony was
undergoing a change which in its completion was to exhibit New
South Wales to the world as the grandest instance of successful
colonization ever recorded in history, and not a few of the
blessings this day enjoyed may be traced to the vigor of
Macquarie's administration. Even in his day the progress towards
freedom and greatness was well marked, and he had the satisfaction
of recording to the Home Government a few facts indicating the
material progress that had eventuated during his term of office.
Here are a few extracts from a communication which he addressed to
Earl Bathurst almost immediately after his his return to
England:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I found the colony barely emerging from infantile imbecility,
and suffering from various privations and disabilities; the country
impenetrable beyond forty miles from Sydney; agriculture in a yet
languishing state; commerce in its early dawn; revenue unknown;
threatened with famine; distracted by faction; the public buildings
in a state of dilapidation and mouldering to decay; the few roads
and bridges formerly constructed rendered almost impassable; the
population in general depressed by poverty; no public credit, nor
private confidence; the morals of the great mass of the population
in the lowest state of debasement, and religious worship almost
totally neglected. Such was the state of New South Whales when I
took charge of its administration on 1st January, 1810. I left it
in February last (his communication is dated July, 1822), reaping
incalculable advantages from my extensive and important discoveries
in all directions, including the supposed insurmountable barrier
called the Blue Mountains, to the westward of which are situated
the fertile plains of Bathurst; and, in all respects, enjoying a
state of private comfort and public prosperity, which I trust will
at least equal the expectation of His Majesty's Government. The
change may indeed be ascribed in part to the natural operation of
time and events on individual enterprise: how far it may be
attributed to measures originating with myself, as hereinafter
detailed, and my zeal and judgment in giving effect to my
instructions, I humbly submit to His Majesty and his ministers.</p>

<p>"On my taking the command of the colony in the year 1810, the
amount of port duties collected did not exceed &pound;8000 per annum, and
there were only &pound;50 or &pound;60 of a balance in the Treasurer's hand;
but now duties are collected at Port Jackson to the amount of from
&pound;28,000 to &pound;30,000 per annum. In addition to this annual colonial
revenue, there are port duties collected at Hobart Town, in Van
Diemen's Land, to the amount of between &pound;8,000 and &pound;10,000 per
annum."</p>
<p>Governor Macquarie may have been fussy and conceited, but he was
withal active, energetic, prudent and patriotic; and at this long
distance from the time when he administered the affairs of the
colony we can look back and share in the honest pride which he
displayed when rendering an account of his stewardship. He died in
England in 1824, two years after leaving the colony for whose
material advancement he had so diligently laboured.</p>

TRUE STORY OF HIS LAND GRANT.</p>
<p>Governor Brisbane succeeded Macquarie, and entered upon his
duties on 1st December, 1821. He was eminently unfitted for his
position, for although a soldier he was weak and vacilating, and
too much given to transferring to others the duties which he
himself should have performed. At this time the struggle for
supremacy between the different classes was at its height, and it
required the vigorous brain and strong determination of a powerful,
courageous man to guide the affairs of State, between the
unscrupulous grasping of the disappointed military, the forceful
demands of the wealthy emancipists for the restitution of legal and
other rights, and the clamoring of the free settlers of the humbler
class&mdash;retired soldiers and sailors and emigrants&mdash;who,
although generally taking sides with the emancipists against the
'pure merinos,' as the official aristocrats were called, were not
unmindful of the claims of 'Number One.' Brisbane neither had the
courage nor the tact to manage matters properly. He was tossed
hither and thither between the contending forces, and in order to
escape from the clamour he made himself a retreat at Parramatta,
where he established an observatory and devoted himself to the
pursuit of scientific studies, seeking rest from the turmoil and
strife of active official life in the quiet contemplation of the
stars. Events did not stand still, however, and during his
administration several important changes took place. The old
monopolising and domineering spirit, which had been checked by
Macquarie, broke out stronger than ever, and militaryism
re-asserted itself, the Governor having practically to stand aside
while officials help themselves and each other to place and power,
and divided the land in great slices between them.</p>
<p>Concerning this matter one writer says:&mdash;"The little clique
of exclusives appear to have regarded themselves as the only
persons whose claims to grants of land, to convict labour, or to
social recognition by the Governor, ought to be considered for a
moment. Already many of them were possessed of enormous landed
properties; their farms were cultivated by prison labour, their
houses built by prison labour, there furniture made by prison
labour, and all their servants were prisoners. There was a
constantly increasing commissariat expenditure on account of
convict management and for the supply of convict food and
necessaries; and a large part of this expenditure went into the
pockets of the more wealthy settlers, in payment for maize, wheat,
beef, and other food grown, and articles of clothing made, by the
labour of the very class on whose account the expenditure was
incurred. In fact, the Government gave the land, supplied the
labour to cultivate it, and then purchased the produce. It was
barely possible for persons with such singular advantages to escape
becoming wealthy.. .. .. When again in possession of the reins of
power (during Brisbane's rule) all the influence that they could
exercise in their recovered position was fully taken advantage of,
and this, bearing in mind what has been stated respecting the
wealthy land-grasping emancipists (one well-known Sydney
grog-seller being possessed of over 20,000 acres of freehold land,
purchased from grantees for a few gallons of rum), will afford an
insight into the circumstances under which a comparatively small
number of colonists were enabled to acquire estates which, whether
regarded in reference to their wants or to their means of turning
them to useful account, were enormous in extent; and, being the
pick in point of soil and situation of the whole country, were of
vast prospective value."</p>
<p>It must be remembered that at this time the land to the westward
was open and available; and that large slices of that territory
should be seized by these insatiable sharks was a very natural
circumstance. And it was also a very natural circumstance that the
communal interests created in years following in that territory
should suffer through the locking-up of the land so easily
'grabbed.'</p>
<p>Among the most important events during Governor Brisbane's term
of office were the following:&mdash;The institution of a
Legislative Council; the establishment of trial by jury; the formal
acknowledgment of the liberty of the press; important discoveries
of new country; and the steady inflow of immigration from the
mother country.</p>
<p>The publication of Commissioner Bigg's report had, as already
stated, awakened the public of Great Britain to the fact that the
far-off South Land furnished a splendid field for enterprise, and
towards the latter part of Macquarie's administration a tide of
emigration set in which was at full flow when Brisbane arrived, and
it continued with steadily increasing volume during the whole
period of his government. As it was chiefly persons who could
afford employment to convicts who were desired by the Government,
the Home authorities held out grants of land to those only who
could produce certificates of their possessing capital of at least
&pound;500, and consequently the greater number who came were possessed
of means to enter at once upon the work of development. Concerning
these, Dr. Lang says:&mdash;"Some of them had been gentleman
farmers, others were the sons of respectable land-holders in the
mother country; some of them had been unfortunate in mercantile
speculations, and others had just saved the remains of a property
which they found daily diminishing at home, to form the nucleus of
a better fortune abroad; some were actuated by a spirit of
adventure, while others had been impelled to emigrate by the
pressure of the times. These emigrants, according as each preferred
a particular locality, settled, for the most part, either in the
agricultural and pastoral country adjoining the Cowpastures, or on
the open plains of Bathurst, beyond the Blue Mountains, along the
thickly-wooded banks of the Hunter and its two tributary river, or
in what was then called the New Country, or the district of Argyle.
The general extent of their grants was from 500 to 2,000 acres.
Rations from the King's stores were at first allowed to each
settler, and a certain number of convict servants apportioned
according to the extent of his grant, for the term of six months
after he had taken possession of his land; and he was also allowed
a certain number of cattle from the Government herds, as a loan to
be repaid in kind in seven years; but, in consequence of the number
of emigrants rapidly increasing, these indulgences were afterwards
discontinued." Thus it was that a superior class of
settlers&mdash;many of them with the requisite knowledge and energy
to make the new soil smile its loudest in fruitfulness&mdash;were
located in the opening districts west, south and north of the
populated centre.</p>
<p>Four very important discoveries inland were made during
Brisbane's administration. In 1823 the Maneroo Plains were explored
by Captain Currie, R.N. In the same year Mr. Oxley,
Surveyor-General, explored Moreton Bay and discovered the Brisbane
River, leading to the fine semi-tropical country of Queensland. In
the year following Hovel and Hume made their overland journey to
Port Phillip; and in 1825 Mr. Allan Cunningham discovered Pandora's
Pass, affording the only practicable road from the Upper Hunter to
the pastoral uplands of Liverpool Plains. The full importance of
these discoveries was not seen until 'after many days,' but they
were neither more nor less than the opening of the most important
doors leading from the smaller to the greater.</p>
<p>The Imperial Act under which civil juries were first impanelled
in New South Wales was 4th Geo. IV., cap. 96, and Mr. Francis
Forbes was appointed thereunder first Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court. That gentleman arrived in Sydney in March, 1824, but soon
after his arrival found that the Act and Charter contained no
authority whatever for impanelling civil juries in criminal cases,
and only in civil actions where both parties to the suit were
agreed that such a course should be adopted. The Act was to
continue in force four years, and under its authority crimes and
misdemeanours were to be prosecuted by information in the name of
his Majesty's Attorney-General, and tried by the Chief Justice and
a jury of seven commissioned officers of his Majesty's sea or land
forces; while all civil cases were to be tried by the Chief Justice
and two magistrates, sitting as assessors, unless, as before
stated, both parties to the suit agreed to have a jury, in which
case the trial was to be before the Chief Justice and a jury of
twelve civilians. In the interests of all parties Chief Justice
Forbes extended the principle to the lower court, and civil jurors
sat in Courts of Quarter Sessions, although the magistrates offered
strong objection&mdash;so hard is it for mortals to renounce
arbitrary power when once they have experienced the pleasure of its
exercise.</p>
<p>There was a long and bitter struggle, extending over a
considerable period, between the different sections of the
community&mdash;the 'exclusivists' fighting for the retention of
power and the judge fighting with the people for the first
instalment of constitutional liberty. In this struggle the
exclusive few, who wished to retain power over the liberty and
property of their fellows, were eventually successful, and in 1828
there was a return to the old system of military juries in Courts
of Quarter Sessions as well as in the Supreme Court, a system which
existed until the principle of self-government began to operate in
the colony.</p>
<p>The year 1824 was also rendered remarkable by liberty of the
press being conceded, and the publication of the Australian, the
first colonial newspaper independent of Government aid, published
by Mr. Wentworth and Dr. Wardell. The Monitor was also shortly
afterwards established, Mr. E. S. Hall being editor and proprietor.
"Both these newspapers," says Bennet, "were conducted with far more
than average ability, and their editorial columns presented a
marked contrast to the fulsome flattery of Government officials,
and the inane twaddle on other matters, which characterised their
older rival, the Sydney Gazette." Concerning the press it may now
be said 'the little one has become a thousand!'</p>
<p>During this period, also, the first step towards that large
share of self-government which Australia now enjoys was taken. On
11th August, 1824, there appeared in the Sydney Gazette, a
proclamation announcing that his Majesty had been pleased to
institute a Legislative Council for New South Wales. The first
members of this Council consisted exclusively of Government
officers, and were only six in number, namely:&mdash;William
Stewart, Lieutenant-Governor; Francis Forbes, Chief Justice;
Frederick Goulburn, Colonial Secretary; James Bowman, Principal
Colonial Surgeon; and John Oxley, Surveyor-General. Subsequently
Mr. John Macarthur, of Camden, was added to the list. The first
session of the new Council was a very short one, and only one Act
of a single clause was passed&mdash;an Act to legalise promissory
notes and bills of exchange made payable in Spanish dollars, which
were then the ordinary currency of the colony.</p>
<p>Governor Brisbane was peculiarly unfortunate in his financial
measures, but in this matter, as in others, he appears to have been
simply the means of giving effect to the schemes of interested
parties in power. It had been usual under previous governors to
purchase the surplus grain from farmers at the current prices of
the day. The Government was almost the only purchaser, and to the
Government the agriculturists looked for a certain share of their
profits, the only cash received by the smaller settlers during the
year being from the commissariat. The Government needed the
provisions to feed the large number of 'children' born to the
heritage across the water. But Brisbane adopted the contract system
and invited tenders for the quantity required at the lowest price.
The small farmers, unused to calculate the effects of open
competition, rushed forward to the Government stores with such
eagerness that the price of wheat speedily fell from 10/- and 7/6
per bushel to 3/9 per bushel; and the colonists, reading
over-production between the lines of low prices, proceeded to feed
their pigs with the grain they had grown. But as the season
advanced it was discovered that the harvest, so far from being
plentiful, was deficient; wheat rose to as high as &pound;1 4s per
bushel, and those who had sold cheap had to re-purchase at a high
figure to secure food, and a crisis set in. To make matters worse
the Commissary-General and the Colonial Secretary induced the
Governor to suddenly change the circulating medium from sterling to
colonial currency, with the immediate result of raising the pound
sterling twenty-five per cent. above the pound currency, and
upsetting commercial relationships all round, the small settlers,
who had contracted debts upon the old lines, being the chief
sufferers. The colony was threatened with famine, and for a time
the greatest distress prevailed, the Government being put to the
greatest straits in seeking to secure a sufficiency of supplies. So
pressing was the need that a proclamation was issued prohibiting
the rooting up of cabbage-stalks!</p>
<p>It was no wonder, under these circumstance, that Brisbane should
become unpopular, and orders came from England for him to be
'relieved,' at the close of the fourth year of his government, he
having served from December 1821 to December 1825. Before he left
he sought to please and benefit the emancipists by sitting down
with a company of them to dinner&mdash;an act of grace which the
'pure merinos' resented with characteristic warmth. To eat out of
the same dish with 'branded cattle' would have been as hurtful to
them as contact with an alien of the lowest type would be to a
Mussulman.</p>
<br>

<br>
<h2>THE INTERREGNUM.</h2>
<p>During the interregnum of nineteen days between the departure of
Brisbane and the arrival of his successor, Sir Ralph Darling, the
Government was administered by Colonel Stewart, of the Third
Regiment, or Buffs, and who afterwards became Major-General, and
resided on his large estate near Bathurst.</p>
<p>Of this gentleman's administration very little has been
recorded. He simply held the reins of the coach until the new
driver climbed to the seat. It was currently reported, however,
that in one respect he was remarkably active. This is what was
said: Other Governors had invariably looked forward to their return
to their Mother land at the expiration of their term of service:
Colonel Stewart had decided to make his permanent home in the penal
colony. Other Governors had been liberal in making large grants of
land to residents or intending residents: Colonel Stewart was more
'canny,' and availed himself of the privilege of doing good to the
person who in his own opinion was most deserving of good. He
therefore secured for himself an immense tract of grazing and
agricultural land near Bathurst, and lived to work and die upon it,
his remains being interred in a vault upon the highest peak
thereof, and from which peak an extensive view of the country
around was to be obtained, the major portion of which country was
included within the boundaries marking the 'original grant' secured
by self-payment of eighteen days' patriotic service! All this was
generally believed, even in the district where he settled, until
the present year&mdash;1888&mdash;when a Sydney newspaper having
repeated the story was thus addressed by Mr. J. H. Stewart, son of
the Major-General, who still lives on the Mount Pleasant
Estate:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sir,&mdash;In your last week's issue you give a very erroneous
account of the manner in which my late father acquired this
property. Had it referred to myself alone I would not trouble to
correct it; but, as it throws a stigma on a revered parent now
deceased, and also as you are at present writing out an history of
the early days of the colony, it seems only right that I should
give you a true statement regarding this matter. My father reached
Sydney in May, 1825, in command of the 3rd Regiment of Buffs, and
with the appointment of Lieutenant-Governor. He also brought with
him an order from the Imperial Government for the selection for
3,000 acres of land in any part of the colony he might desire. This
quantity was only 1,000 acres more than was usually given to those
settlers who could deposit &pound;1,000 to their credit in some bank in
Sydney for the few days necessary to secure the grant. My father
got his 3,000 acres from the Duke of York as a reward for his
military services in the Peninsular War, where he commanded the
Buffs in two general actions, besides minor affairs; and he
obtained a gold medal for Albuera, in which battle his horse was
killed under him by a Polish Lancer. General Darling left the
colony soon after my father's arrival, and he acted as full
Governor until Sir Thomas Brisbane reached the port. But it was not
until long afterwards, viz., in 1827, that he made his selection
near Bathurst. The Macquarie was taken up along its north bank at a
very early period, but the southside of the river was reserved for
a Government cattle station, and no one was allowed to cross the
stream without a pass from a magistrate. About the year 1826
pressure began to be brought for opening the lands on the Bathurst
side, and my father secured a promise of first selection; but his
multifarious duties in Sydney long prevented his getting away to
make it. I have in my possession a letter to him from the Governor
requesting, as a personal favour, that he would run up to make his
selection, as the number of applicants for the new country had
become so great that they could not any longer be restrained. He
then made a hurried trip across the mountains, and selected his
3,000 acres on the west side of the parish of Mount Pleasant, along
Evans' Plains Creek, but not including the Monument Hill, where his
remains now rest. In 1828 he was sent on to India with his
regiment, but before leaving he secured a lease of the remaining
portion of the parish, containing about 12,000 acres. On arrival at
Calcutta he was appointed commandant at Meerut, where he remained
for four years; and in 1832, when he was raised to the rank of
Major-General, he left the army on half-pay, and returned to look
after his grant of land at Bathurst, intending shortly to return to
Scotland for his family, whom he had left on his paternal estate in
Caithness. While arranging his affairs we surprised him by our
unexpected arrival in Sydney, whither we had been forwarded,
without any authority, by his agent, Sheriff Home. Being now
advanced in years, my father decided to settle in the colony, and
he then purchased the 9,000 acre block where the monument on the
hill and the mansion house stand adjoining his primary grant, at
the upset price of 5s per acre; and it was not until 1838 that he
secured the 2,400 acre block at the southern side of the parish,
for which he paid 12s. per acre, the upset price having by that
time been raised. This is the simple story of the purchase of the
Mount Pleasant estate, and, as you have published a very different
version of it, I think I have a fair claim upon you to investigate
the facts and to give the same publicity to the result of your
inquiries.</p>
<p>"Faithfully yours,</p>
<p>"J. H. Stewart."</p>
<p>Thus we see how long-lived some lies are. One act of the Colonel
when serving as Lieutenant-Governor will show what sort of man he
was. When Brisbane left several prisoners were under sentence of
death, and in the exercise of his gubernatorial functions the
Colonel had their sentences commuted to penal servitude. It was a
bold thing to do in the days when hanging was the height of
fashion.</p>

<p>Governor Darling entered upon his duties on 19th December, 1825,
and continued in office until October 1831. It has been truly said
of him that he was 'a man of forms and precedents, of the true
red-tape school&mdash;neat, exact, punctual, industrious, spiteful,
arbitrary, commonplace.' The manner in which he endeavoured to
reduce into order the confusion he found in the public departments
furnished proof of his neatness and exactness. His punctuality and
industry were displayed in the fact that he personally considered
every case and perused every letter which reached head quarters.
His venom and arbitrariness found exercise in treating the convicts
with great severity, and in efforts to crush the newly-born press
which dared to raise its voice against gubernatorial cruelty. One
act of tyranny committed by him was alone sufficient to render him
infamous, and although the narration properly belongs to a separate
division of this quasi-historical work, the story may fittingly be
told here, as it stands out in the history of the colony as a sort
of land mark of the termination of the Algerine system of
Government, showing how gross an outrage on law, justice and
constitutional right could be perpetrated by an Englishman reigning
over Englishmen. Here is the story:&mdash;</p>
<p>Sudds and Thompson were two soldiers of the 57th Regiment doing
duty in the colony in 1825. Thinking the lot of convicts preferable
to their own, by reason of the indulgence granted and the
opportunities for amassing wealth offered to that class, they
committed a felony, by stealing a piece of cloth from a shop in
George-street, Sydney, for the express purpose of getting
themselves convicted, believing that after a short sentence they
should emerge into a condition that would enable them to enjoy the
privileges and opportunities enjoyed by the many favored
emancipists. Arrest, trial, conviction, and sentence followed, as
they desired, the sentence being transportation to one of the
auxiliary penal settlements for seven years. In the course of the
trial, however, the motive leading to the commission of the crime
was fully revealed, as was also the fact that there was wide-spread
discontent among the military on account of the inferior position
they were compelled to occupy. Fearing that the discipline of the
troops would be seriously endangered if a check was not put upon
these low-bred aspirations, Sir Ralph Darling, himself a
military-man, determined to take the men out of the custody of the
civil power, and teach them and their fellow soldiers a lesson they
would never forget. He issued a General Order in pursuance of which
the two men were taken from the custody of the gaoler and brought
to the Barrack-square in Sydney, where, in presence of the
military, it was announced that their sentence had been changed to
seven years hard labour in irons on the roads, and that on the
expiration of their sentence they were to be returned to their
regiment. But this was not all. The Governor invented a special
form of 'ironing' to suit the regimentals. The two men were
stripped of their uniform and clothed in the convict dress; iron
collars with long projecting spikes were then rivetted round their
necks and fetters and chains rivetted on their legs. They were then
drummed out of the Regiment and marched back to gaol while the band
played 'The Rogue's March.' What followed is best told in the words
of the only one of the two who survived to tell the tale. Sudds,
who was in bad health at the time, overcome with grief, shame, and
disappointment, which was not at all relieved by the heat of the
sun on the day of the exposure in the Barrack-square, re-entered
the prison only to die, and this is the manner in which his
fellow-prisoner, Thompson, described the new experience of
prison-life, when examined on board the Phoenix hulk:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We were taken to the parade ground and the regimentals taken
off us, and a suit of yellow cloth put on each of us, and a General
Order read to us by Brigade Mayor Gillham, by the order of his
Excellency General Darling. After the Order was read to us a set of
irons was put on each of us. The irons consisted of a collar which
went round each of our necks, and chains were fastened to the
collar on each side of the shoulder, and reached from thence to the
basil, which was placed about three inches from each ankle. There
was a piece of iron which projected from the collar before and
behind, about eight inches at each place. The projecting iron would
not allow me to stretch myself at full length on my back. I could
sleep on my back by contracting my legs. I could not lie at full
length on either side without contracting my legs. I could not
stand upright with the irons on. The basil of the irons would not
slip up my legs, and the chains were too short to allow me to stand
upright. I was never measured for the irons, and Sudd's collar was
too small for his neck, and the basils for his legs, which were
swollen. I never heard him say he had the dropsy in the West
Indies. Sudds was turned out of the hospital the morning of his
punishment, and taken to the barracks about an hour afterwards.
Sudds was taken from the hospital to the Session on the 6th
November. [The inquiry was held on 23rd April following]; he
appeared to be very ill, insomuch that the man who was handcuffed
with him was obliged to sit down on the grass in the court yard in
order to enable him to lie down. He continued in that way until
after the trial.</p>
<p>"After the yellow clothes and the irons were put on us in manner
before mentioned, we were drummed out of the Regiment, the 'Rogue's
March' being played after us by two or three drummers or fifers. We
were not drummed out in the usual way, which is, to put a rope
about the neck, cut off the facings and place a piece of paper on
the back, with a description of the offence which the party may
have committed. Instead of this we had the insbacon and the yellow
clothing. On our return to the same ward in the gaol, Sudds sat
down with his back to the wall saying that he was very ill, and
wished to go to the hospital again, but he did not go to the
hospital till next morning. The basils of his irons cut his legs
during the time we were coming from the barracks to the gaol; it
was owing to the sharpness of the basil and the weight of it that
we were cut. The night of the day of punishment Sudds was so ill
that we were obliged to get a candle about eight o'clock from
Wilson, the under-jailer, in order to keep up a light during the
night. I gave him some tea which I had purchased. About ten o'clock
he was very ill. I requested a fellow prisoner to get up and look
at him, thinking he was dying. The fellow prisoner, whose name I do
not know, did look at him, and said he was not dying, but he did
not think he would live long. I then asked Sudds if he had any
friends to whom he would wish to write. He said he had a wife and
child in Gloucestershire, and begged that if he did not get better
by the next night, I would read some pious book to him, adding
'that they had put him in them irons till they had killed
him.'"</p>
<p>The Governor and his friends endeavoured to account for Sudds'
death by stating that he had previously suffered from dropsy, and
that he had been neglected by the medical officer; but they were
unable to produce evidence in support of their allegations, and the
report of the medical officer of the gaol fully disproved the
theory they had set up to ease their consciences under the
self-accusations of murder, which must have been ever repeating
themselves. Dr. McInty redeclared:&mdash;"I found him in a state of
delirium on the 26th instant, and he was removed to the General
Hospital, where he gradually became worse, and expired the
following morning. After a minute dissection of the body, no
apparent disease was found to exist to account for his immediate
death." The iron had entered this poor man's soul.</p>
<p>When reporting the case in a despatch to Earl Bathurst, Darling
said:&mdash;"However much the event is to be regretted, it cannot
be imputed to severity; none was practised or intended. The only
deviation from the usual course of proceeding was, that instead of
the chains being put on in jail, the act was performed in a more
ceremonious manner, in presence of the garrison, as a necessary
example to the troops. With respect to the chains, which have been
designated instruments of torture, it will be sufficient to state
that they weigh only 13lbs. 12oz.; and though made with a view of
producing an effect upon those who were to witness the ceremony,
the extreme lightness of their construction prevented their being
injurious in any respect to the individual." In writing thus
Darling published his own infamy. The irons used on the road gangs
did not weigh more than from six to nine pounds, while those
brought out from England for convicts on board prison ships weighed
only four lbs. It was proved that the chains rivetted about Sudds
weighed no less than 14lbs. 6oz.; yet the Governor speaks of their
'extreme lightness!' It was proved that the rivetting on of those
chains was an act nothing short of judicial murder, yet the
Governor, who was alone responsible for the act, with
characteristic cold-bloodedness describes it as a 'ceremony!'</p>
<p>Darling's rule of the convicts throughout was most rigorous. His
rod was iron, and it was always waving. The times of the 'first
fleeters,' of irresponsible floggers and short allowances of coarse
food, were revived. A penal settlement was formed at Moreton Bay,
and the story was fully credited that there the prisoners were so
badly treated that they committed murder in order to be sent for
trial to Sydney. At the same time the country magistrates were
empowered to award any number of lashes for insolence, idleness, or
other indefinite offences, and considering the school in which many
of those magistrates had been educated, it may easily be conceived
that brutality little short of that which did poor Sudds to death
was practised with a liberal hand.</p>
<p>The Australian Agricultural Company was fully established during
Darling's reign, the agents selecting, taking possession and
commencing operations on their grant of a million acres in the
North. The company had been formed in England for improving and
cultivating the waste lands of Australia, of importing sheep and
cattle for squatting purposes, and of opening the mineral resources
of the territory. The proceedings of the Company, in the then
financial state of the colony, created an entire revolution. They
sent out from England a numerous staff, cargoes of implements and
stock on a most costly scale, and purchased breeding cattle so
largely that the price was raised from 100 to 200 per cent. in the
colony. To such a market sellers were not slow in taking their
stock. But a reaction soon followed, and the panic that resulted
corresponded in intensity with the excitement of extravagant
expectations. For years more harm than good resulted to the colony
from the Company's operations. Their grand ideas of extensive
cultivation of the olive, opium, silkworm and orange groves all
ended in smoke, and the little advantage won to the colony in the
improved breed of sheep and cattle was very poor compensation for
the sacrifice of so large a slice of territory; and even this
benefit was neutralised by the monopoly, which not only handed over
to the company the richest beds of coal in the colony, but actually
precluded the colonists from working, on any terms, coal which
might happen to be found under their estates.</p>
<p>It was thought by the Home Government that the company would
relieve them from the cost of maintaining a large number of
convicts, for whom at one period it had been found difficult to
obtain employment, and it was agreed that the company should be
relieved of quit rent on condition of their employing a certain
number of prisoners and maintaining them. But, from the period of
this gigantic grant, the value of convict labour rose so rapidly
that the Company were never able to obtain the stipulated number of
servants; and in 1830 the editor of the Sydney Monitor seriously
proposed that convicts should be <i>sold on arrival to the highest
bidder,</i> anticipating that they would realize, in lots of two
hundred, as much as &pound;100 each per year for five or ten years! The
evils of this wholesale sacrifice of the public estate to a few
capitalists 'at home' have extended right down to the present
day.</p>
<p>The system of granting land was somewhat modified under
Darling's rule. The Governor instituted a Board of Inquiry and
established regulations under which land was only to be granted in
proportion to the property or means of the applicant, and not to
such applicant, unless there was reason to believe that he was able
and willing to improve it. And the Governor had men at his elbow
who turned these regulations for making the rich richer to good
account.</p>
<p>Dr. Lang gives an instance of the favoritism shown during those
days. He says:&mdash;"As I was travelling on one occasion in the
discharge of clerical duties in the district of Bathurst, during
Sir Ralph Darling's administration, I happened to call at the
cottage of a respectable settler, a magistrate of the territory,
who I found was building a remarkably substantial two-story house
on his estate at the time. He asked me to look at the house, which
was beautifully situated on rising ground, commanding a wide extent
of campaign country; and I accordingly did so before resuming my
journey. In pointing out its various advantages, the settler
informed me that the brick-making and bricklaying operations, the
carpentry and joinery work, the plastering and shingling, and, if I
am not greatly mistaken, the cabinet-maker's and upholstery work
also, had all been done by his own assigned convict servants. I
happened to mention the circumstance in the course of conversation
with the next settler I called on a few miles off, without
suspecting, however, that there was any peculiarity in the case;
when the settler observed to me, not without a slight display of
indignant feeling, that he had been applying for a convict mechanic
himself for years, but had been unable to obtain one, although he
had confessedly done much more for the district than his more
fortunate neighbour. The first settler was the friend of a colonial
functionary of some influence at the time; and I could not fail to
observe that he was particularly active in his district whenever
addresses were to be moved to Governor Darling. The second settler,
who was also a magistrate of the territory, was merely a man of
independent principles and feelings, who was accustomed to think
and act for himself."</p>
<p>Although adverse to immigration. Darling could not check the
tide which was steadily setting in, and large numbers of persons of
moderate means continued to arrive in the colony; but the
difficulties they had to encounter in the search for land upon
which to settle may be inferred when it is stated that a letter of
advice to emigrants sent home about this time recommended 'every
settler to bring out an order from the Secretary of State to be
allowed to inspect charts and maps in the Surveyor's office,' as
from being denied such inspection 'emigrants wander about the
interior of the colony at great expense, and to little purpose.'
The secret was that the surveys of waste lands were kept out of the
'ken' of the uninitiated, for the benefit of the favoured or feeing
few.</p>
<p>In 1829 the Consultative Council established in 1824 gave place
to a Legislative Council of fifteen members, with authority to make
local laws. The proceedings of this body were secret, under an oath
administered to that intent, and the Governor had an absolute veto.
The only act of service to the colony passed by this Council was
that which abolished arbitrary procedure by Government officials
and substituted the English system of trial by jury.</p>
<p>Governor Darling was unfortunate in falling foul of the Press,
which was fast making its voice heard in the colony in the
direction of freedom and impartial dealing. The Gazette was the
Government organ, and every sound of its voice had to be heard
through the jingling of Government coin. Its flattery of everything
smacking of Darling was sickening in its fulsomeness, and helped to
make the untrammelled portion of the fourth estate more vigorous
and outspoken than it would otherwise have been. It was the case of
Sudds and Thompson that brought affairs to a climax, and when the
Gazette commenced a defence of the Governor's action in that case,
the two other papers, the Australian and the Monitor, launched out
into condemnation of the severest kind. The extreme on either side
was reached, and the Governor was kept in a state of feverish
annoyance, which sought relief in the passing of certain Acts
affecting the press, which were designated by the opposition
editors 'The Gagging Acts.' But this only served to give point to
the personalities of the newspapers not in receipt of Government
pay, and the cross-firing led to actions for libel, resulting in
fine and imprisonment for the whole of the scribblers. But,
although the opposition papers carried their charges against the
Governor to extremes, they had justice on their side, and the
agitation they kept up led eventually to Darling's recall.</p>
<p>After his return to England a half-hearted attempt was made to
have the charges preferred against him, in the Sudds-Thompson case,
investigated, but the attempt ended in smoke, and Darling was
knighted as a token of the King's favour.</p>
<p>During the six years of Darling's rule further successful
explorations of the interior were made, both by private individuals
and public officials, among the former being those men who were
looking out for 'fresh fields and pastures new' for their
increasing flocks and herds, and among the latter being Messrs.
Mitchell, Oxley, Cunningham, and Captain Sturt. It was the latter
who followed the Murrumbidgee to its junction with the Murray, and
pushed on through difficulties and dangers until he reached the
Lake Alexandrina, and discovered the future province of South
Australia.</p>
<p>The population at the close of Darling's administration was
51,155; the export of wool 1,401,284 lbs.; of oil, &pound;95,969 in
value; the total exports were &pound;324,168; and the imports &pound;49,152.
The ordinary revenue of the year was &pound;103,228. Of the expenditure
there are no reliable records.</p>

ENGLAND&mdash;DEATH.</p>
<p>Major-General Sir Richard Bourke, perhaps the most able and
popular of the early Governors of the colony, succeeded Darling,
and his administration lasted from December 1831 to November 1837.
His rule was marked by vigor and firmness, zeal, liberality and
humanity. He entered office under most favourable circumstances,
and it is not at all wonderful, therefore, that progress ran
freely. He found the system of granting land to free immigrants
working badly, the rule being to limit those grants to men who had
friends among the officials in Sydney; and he therefore changed the
arrangement, put a stop to free grants, and ordered that all lands
in the settled district should be offered at auction, fixing the
upset price at 5/- per acre. This proved a most prolific source of
revenue, and the money thus raised was used to assist free
emigration from Europe. The scramble for land in the unsettled
districts of the colony had led to quarrels between the scramblers
concerning boundaries, they having no legal tenure to their
holdings, and the term 'squatter' being first applied to them. The
Governor regulated this matter by requiring the 'squatters' to make
formal application for the land they required and pay a small rent,
undertaking to define the boundaries, and granting in return
peaceable possession until the land was needed for settlement.</p>
<p>The regulations issued by Bourke caused an important and
fundamental change in the whole colonial system in regard to the
disposal of waste land, and in 1836 the returns from land sales
amounted to no less a sum than &pound;132,396. The broad and
statesmanlike views he entertained on the subject of land
alienation may be gathered from a single sentence in the despatch
which he forwarded to the Colonial Office in 1838. He had received
from head quarters a caution that 'it was not desirable to allow
the population to become more scattered than it then was'&mdash;the
remark having reference to the attempts that were being made to
colonize Port Phillip; and in reply to that despatch he wrote as
follows:&mdash;"The question, I beg leave to submit, is simply
this: How may Government turn to the best advantage a state of
things which it cannot wholly interdict? It may, I would suggest,
be found practicable by means of the sale of lands in situations
peculiarly advantageous, however distant from other locations, and
by establishing townships and ports, and facilitating the
intercourse between remote and more settled districts of this vast
territory, to provide centres of civilization and government, and
thus gradually extend the power of social order to the most distant
parts of the wilderness." The fund thus created by the sale of land
was, as Dr. Lang tersely puts it, "the means of infusing, to almost
an inconceivable extent, the salutary ingredient of a virtuous and
industrious population into the mass of a convict colony, and of
thereby elevating that colony, in a period of time comparatively
short, to the rank of an intelligent, respectable and religious
community."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, the choice of emigrants for some time
was not wise. During the years 1832-3-4 the system was carried out
exclusively under the auspices of the Female Emigration Board, in
London; "but in so exceptional a manner," says the writer already
quoted, "that in the year 1835 the streets of Sydney and the public
houses of the colony were <i>actually swarming with free immigrant
prostitutes</i> from the cities of London, Dublin and Cork, the
expense of whose passage out had been defrayed from the land
revenue of the colony!" It was in arranging for the introduction of
numbers of his own country-men from the 'land o' cakes' that Dr.
Lang at this juncture found full exercise for his restless energy
and national clannishness. The tide of immigration set in with
steady force, and to some of the men and women who came to the
colony during the rule of Bourke, and the years presently
succeeding, the colony owes a great deal, for they did more to
build up the industrial power since attained and at the present
time enjoyed than any Governor's Order or Legislative enactment
could have done. The bad amongst them&mdash;and there were many
very bad&mdash;found congenial fellows with whom to drink and curse
and die; and the good ones&mdash;and there were many
good&mdash;found a soil quite ready for the profitable exercise of
their energy, thrift, and virtue.</p>
<p>The six years of Governor Bourke's reign were pregnant with
measures and events of the utmost importance in shaping the
destinies of the growing and expanding colony. In addition to the
regulations concerning land, laws were passed in the interests of
education and religion. The Church and School Corporation (which
had developed into a gross job) was abolished, and religious
equality was established; Government patronage was removed from the
press; the constitution of the Courts of Justice was improved;
steps were adopted which, in 1840, finally abolished transportation
to the colony; rules for regulating the number of convict servants
each settler should have, and the number of lashes which should be
inflicted upon a convict by a single magistrate, were framed and
promulgated; the colony of Victoria was discovered, and in 1836 a
regular Government was established; further explorations were
carried out, and the settlement of the land began to be conducted
on a system more advantageous to the people.</p>
<p>It was reasonable and right, therefore, that when His Excellency
determined to leave the colony, the people should endeavour to show
their appreciation of his sterling good qualities in some
pronounced form. In testimony of their feeling they raised some
&pound;4000, and had cast, from a model by an eminent artist in London,
the bronze statue which still stands on an elevated and commanding
situation at the entrance of the Government domain in Sydney,
overlooking the harbour of Port Jackson.</p>
<p>Just previous to his departure for England, Bourke visited Port
Phillip, and during the month of his stay laid out the sites of
Melbourne, Williamstown, and Geelong, the first being named after
the British Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, the second after the
reigning monarch, His Majesty King William IV., and the last
bearing its native name. Bourke died in 1855.</p>

SEASONS&mdash;THE GOVERNOR'S DEATH.</p>
<p>THE ninth Governor of New South Wales was Sir George Gipps, who
assumed the reins of Government on 24th February, 1838. He was a
military man, and although his superior education enabled him to
hold his own in debate with 'the old wives of the old Nominee
Council,' as Dr. Lang called them, his mind was too narrow to
enable him to govern on the broader lines so necessary to
advancement in the then condition of the colony, which was in the
transition stage between serfdom and freedom. He was an eloquent
speaker, a nervous, forceful writer, and could deal out sarcasm as
cutting as a two-edged knife. But his manners were repulsive, his
disposition arbitrary, and his demeanour overbearing, so that he
made enemies of those who would have done good service for him and
with him as friends.</p>
<p>The news that a splendid tract of country had been discovered at
Port Philip had given a fillip to immigration, and a steady stream
of emigrants of a superior class poured in, bringing with them
capital, their object being to settle in the colony as
stockholders, agriculturists, merchants, &amp;c. So great was this
stream that the population of the colony was actually doubled in
the course of a very short time, no fewer than 23,200 immigrants
having landed during 1841, at the end of which year the population
stood at 149,669 persons. At the end of 1846, the last year of
Gipps' administration, the population numbered 196,704 persons.</p>
<p>Under favourable conditions the colony would have floated on the
topmost wave of prosperity; but the conditions were not favourable.
Governor Gipps and the Colonial office at home standing in the way
of anything like progress. The returns from land revenue were
beginning to swell, and the cupidity of the Home Government was
aroused. Although they had declared when the returns were small
that it was only reasonable that such revenues should be applied
wholly and exclusively for the benefit of the colony, they now
demanded that the revenues should be poured into the parental lap,
and Governor Gipps was just the man to enforce the selfish
regulation.</p>
<p>The case really stood thus: The colonists were expected to
defray the cost of their own government, with all the addition of
police and gaol expenses incident to a 'periodical inoculation of
British-grown felonry,' and with the sham of a Legislative Council
and financial discussions, all sources of revenue, except
additional taxation, being removed from their control. The price
and management of Crown or waste lands, and the expenditure of
funds arising from them in emigration, were settled by English
commissioners; the Crown appropriating the surplus. The
custom-house tariff and the rules for levying it were settled by
the English custom-house authorities, who also appointed its
officers. As to the funds raised by local taxation, the Colonial
Secretary, in the name of the Crown, created offices, fixed fines
and salaries, and appointed officers, without the slightest regard
to the wants and wishes of the colonists. And under such a
condition of things&mdash;than which that of the ancient people
when condemned to make bricks without straw was not much
worse&mdash;the marvel is that a rebellion was not bred amongst the
colonists, who, as a people, were just beginning to 'feel their
feet.'</p>
<p>Animated evidently by a desire to please the Colonial office,
Gipps adopted a policy as shortsighted and ruinous as it was
heartless, in regard to the waste land and town allotments, only
allowing a small quantity of the former to come into the market
when the demand was at its highest, and placing a very high upset
price upon the latter. The settlement of the lands by the very
class who would have turned them to the best account was thus
prevented; an unhealthy and even ruinous spirit of speculation was
provoked; and although the British Treasury received large sums of
money the colony sucked in injury rather than benefit from the
transactions, and the result was a general 'smash,' in which
individuals, syndicates and monetary institutions alike suffered
loss&mdash;in some cases absolute ruin being the result. The upshot
of the unhealthy speculation is thus described by Dr.
Lang:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The purchase of Government land and town allotments declined
apace, and then ceased entirely. The obligations to the banks and
the other leading companies, as well as to private individuals,
fell due; and land and stock, and other property of all kinds, were
forced upon a falling market to meet them. These articles of
property consequently declined rapidly in value, falling as far
below the average of former years as they had been unnaturally
raised above it; and all but universal bankruptcy ensued. A flock
of sheep was actually sold by the sheriff at this period, in
satisfaction of a comparatively small debt, for sixpence per head;
while another flock the property of one of the oldest merchants in
the colony, was purchased at so low a price (one shilling and
sixpence per head) that within two months after the sale, which
took place in the month of September, just before shearing time,
the fortunate purchaser realized upwards of &pound;250 more than the
whole amount of his purchase-money from the wool alone, the flock
being worth in ordinary seasons, from &pound;9,000 to &pound;10,000. In another
similar case, cattle which had been bought at six guineas ahead
were sold at seven shillings and sixpence; and horses that cost
sixty guineas, the produce of Persian and Arab steeds, brought only
seventeen or eighteen shillings; while a house in Sydney, for which
&pound;5000 had been offered and refused very shortly before, was sold
for &pound;1,200; and sugar, which had been shipped at Manilla at &pound;15 per
ton, sold in Sydney for &pound;10. Carriages of all kinds which had
previously been numerous both in town and country, beyond all
European proportion to the population, experienced a still more
remarkable reduction. A first-rate curricle, quite new, which had
cost &pound;140, sold for &pound;3, and numerous costly equipages, which it was
found were now no longer needed, fell into the hands of the
respective coachmen and grooms, who forthwith started them as
hackney coaches in the city of Sydney, and managed to earn an
honest livelihood for themselves; occasionally taking up their 'old
masters,' <i>when they were able to pay them a fare.</i>'"</p>
<p>It was during Gipps' administration (in 1842) that a
representative character was given to the Legislative Council by
introducing into it twenty-four elective members. By what was
commonly called 'The Constitutional Act,' passed by the Imperial
Parliament, a Legislature of one House was constituted, to consist
of thirty-six members; of whom six were to be Government officers,
other six Crown nominees, and twenty-four to be elected by the
people, viz., eighteen for New South Wales proper and six for Port
Phillip. Concerning this body Dr. Lang says&mdash;and even the
scant reports of the proceedings published strongly support his
statement&mdash;"For general ability; for extent and variety of
information, available for the business of legislation; for manly
eloquence; for genuine patriotism; and for energetic effort and
dignified action, I question whether the first Legislative Council
of New South Wales, under the constitution of 1842, has ever been
surpassed by any Legislature out of England in the British
Empire."</p>
<p>And if the colony to-day is in need of one thing more than
another it is of that ability, eloquence, and patriotism which
characterized such men as William Charles Wentworth, Robert Lowe,
Charles Cowper, Richard Windeyer, Dr. Lang, and others whose names
appear on the roll among the first members constitutionally elected
by the people nearly half a century ago. There was fighting to do
in those days and there were giants to wield the weapons in the
people's cause. The strife between the Governor and the elected
members waxed hotter at each succeeding encounter, but the
'elementary rights of Englishmen' for which the latter fought could
not be borne down even by the double despotism which operated
through a grasping Colonial Office in London and a narrow-minded
Governor on the spot. Even in those early days there was
forcefulness in the sentiment uttered by Southey:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br>
<br>
Easier were it<br>
To hurl the rooted mountain from its base,<br>
Than force the yoke of slavery upon men<br>
Determined to be free!<br>
<br>
<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And inch by inch the Imperial authorities and their willing
servant were forced to yield the rights for which these patriotic
colonial legislators fought. Colonial grievances were ventilated
and redressed&mdash;grievances relating to the revenues; the price
of Crown lands; the assessment on pastoral proprietors; the abuses
in connection with Crown patronage; the expense in police, gaols,
&amp;c.; the responsibility of judges of the Supreme Court; and a
host of other matters which seriously affected the well-being of
the rising colony. And if these early heroes were not directly
successful in winning the freedom for which they fought, they
certainly succeeded in laying the foundation of that liberal form
of Government which to-day is accounted as the freest and most
enlightened of any known in Christendom.</p>
<p>The administration of Sir George Gipps&mdash;an administration
extending over eight years&mdash;will always be considered one of
the most important epochs in the history of New South Wales,
associated as it was&mdash;to use the words of Samuel
Sidney&mdash;"with the permanent infliction of the &pound;1 an acre
monopoly, the consequent triumph of the great pastoral over the
freehold interest, the development of the wonderful pastoral
resources of Australia, the abolition of assignment and
transportation of criminals, the rise of a free population, the
introduction of the elective element into the Legislature, the
commencement of a legitimate parliamentary struggle for the
establishment of a responsible government, and a crowd of events of
great local but minor national importance. All these date back to
the period when Sir George Gipps reigned and governed too, and
contested every possible question with the Legislative Council,
with the judges, with the Crown land Commissioners, with the clergy
of all denominations, with squatters, with settlers, with every one
who dared to have any other opinion than the opinion of the
Governor, except the Secretary of State for the Colonies."</p>
<p>But while the strife thus briefly outlined proceeded, the
seasons continued favorable, the grass grew, flocks and herds
increased, new pastures were being explored and taken up, and
communal wealth was steadily growing under the influence of
individual frugality and industry; so that when Governor Gipps left
the colony, on 11th July, 1846, he was able to announce that the
revenue exceeded the expenditure, and the exports the imports,
while the demands upon the labour market were greater than ever
before known, and most difficult of supply. And this was not the
only period in the history of the colony during which steady
advancement towards solid prosperity was made&mdash;spite of
administration that can only fittingly be described by the term
disastrous.</p>
<p>Sir George Gipps died a few months after his return home in
1847.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Augustus Fitzroy was the tenth Governor of New South
Wales, and he held office for nine years. Personally he did not
commend himself to the men who were earnestly struggling to shape
the destinies of the growing colony. He had no opinions of his own,
and simply acted as a mouthpiece of those who still held the reins,
and whose vassal he was. As one writer during his time tersely puts
it, he was content to drive his own four-in-hand while his official
advisers managed the colonists. Official aptitude he had none; his
intellectual attainments were on a par with his morals&mdash;of a
low order&mdash;and he was as bare of common sense as of refined
tastes. In his case the only signs existing of the 'gentleman' were
a large income, fashionable dress, and a polished exterior. Dr.
Lang, who was in full vigour during his administration, was
particularly severe on him, using his facile pen as the weapon of
offence, and suffering through the use of it by having his liberty
curtailed in Darlinghurst prison. Not every man has the privilege
of libelling a Governor with such effect, and of knowing that the
suffering endured in consequence thereof was in a righteous
cause.</p>
<p>On his Excellency's arrival in the colony he was accompanied by
his wife, Lady Mary Fitzroy, and his two sons, who had both reached
man's estate. Shortly after his arrival Lady Mary was killed by a
fall from the vice-royal carriage in Parramatta Park, the horses
having taken fright while Fitzroy was driving; and Dr. Lang
evidently thought that the sad calamity was received by the
Governor as a pleasant release from burdensome marital ties.
Quoting Junius' description of Lord Irnham he broadly states that
the term 'hoary letcher' was applicable to Fitzroy. Here is one of
the Dr.'s peppery illustrations:&mdash;</p>
<p>"As Her Majesty makes a royal progress at home every year, it is
natural that her Representative in the Colonies should do the same.
Whether they imitate the good example of their Royal Mistress in
other respects, is not quite so evident. At all events, Sir Charles
Fitzroy was engaged in one of his vice regal progresses in New
South Wales, when he reached the inland town of Berrima, about
eighty miles from Sydney, and took up his abode at a respectable
'hostelrie' in the town. In the domestic establishment of the
innkeeper, there happened to be a young woman, the daughter of a
settler in the neighbourhood, of the name of C., who, I believe,
was a native of the colony, and had formerly been the champion of
New South Wales. Miss C., it seems, was by no means destitute of
personal attractions, and appears to have fixed the regards of the
Governor-General himself. What occurred at the time, I neither know
nor care; but in due time, Miss C. proving <i>enciente,</i> the
fact was inhumanely laid at the door of Her Most Gracious Majesty's
representative, the Governor-General of Australia! C. acted on the
occasion as any honest man would be likely to do, whether a
pugilist or not; and he came at length to Sydney for redress; but
meeting with some such cold reception as humble people like himself
are likely to do when asking for redress of any kind in the
mansions of Governors General, he placed his case in the hands of
an able solicitor in Sydney&mdash;William Thurlow, Esq&mdash;the
Right Worshipful the Mayor of that city for the past and present
years. Mr. Thurlow accordingly stated his case, and preferred his
claim upon his Excellency in the usual style, <i>demanding
compensation for the loss of the services of his client's
child.</i> As there were other members of 'the household' at
Berrima on the occasion in question it would doubtless have been
very difficult for Mr. Thurlow&mdash;shrewd lawyer though he
is&mdash;to ascertain (as it was alleged he should have done
beforehand) to which member of the exemplary family the paternity
in the case was to be assigned; but as this was no part of his
client's case, he stuck to the Governor-General, and the result was
that a sum of two hundred pounds, as was reported, was paid to C.,
to prevent exposure and disgrace!"</p>
<p><i>The Empire</i> newspaper was also very outspoken concerning
the Governor's doings. Here is a paragraph from a condemnatory
article, which appeared in that journal on May 7th,
1852:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It does not accord with our notions, that fetes and shows given
to a colonial Governor (Sir Charles was junketting in the Western
interior about this time), under the ostentation of loyalty, while
the moral character of such a Governor is under a dark cloud of
general imputation, are a true mark of respect to the sovereign
whose authority he bears and whose person he represents. If the
Queen be not sufficiently careful in the characters of her
servants, she cannot possible escape the censure herself in some
quarter or another of being indifferent to the high claims of
morality. If she be ignorant, she ought to know, for she has sworn
to govern her vast empire faithfully. If she be told she ought to
be willing to investigate. We have no conception how the cherishing
of an immoral servant can fail to reflect some dishonour upon the
employer. We are aware that the rule of expediency is enough to
establish our point. It is <i>expedient</i> that the Queen's moral
character&mdash;and she is highly moral and virtuous by all
report&mdash;should not be misrepresented by immorality. The
security of her Government demands this; for it is by the
affections and confidence of her people alone that Victoria can be
a true Queen, and the times in immediate prospect will leave her
sway unbroken."</p>
<p>Following this up we hear Dr. Lang's voice again. "The ancient
inform us (said he) that when the frogs petitioned Jupiter for a
King, he threw them down a log; but the modern Jupiter of the
Colonial office has far surpassed this memorable feat of his
ancient prototype; for, with one powerful fling, worthy of Ajax
himself, and reaching to the very ends of the earth, he has thrown
to the green frogs of Australia not only a log, but a he-goat!
There were nine clean&mdash;so much for the tenth!"</p>
<p>Little more need be said concerning the personal history of a
Governor, who, although descended from a King, was nothing more
that a machine, and simply served to carry out instructions which
any man with even less brains could have done twice as well. He
left the colony in 1855 and died in London in 1858.</p>
<p>Several most important events transpired during Fitzroy's
automatic administration, the most remarkable being&mdash;the
attempt to re-introduce convicts into Australia, and which resulted
in a vigorous and successful anti-transportation agitation; the
discovery of gold; the separation of Victoria from New South Wales;
and the passing of a bill sanctioning the establishment of two
deliberative chambers&mdash;a Legislative Assembly and a
Legislative Council. The two first important events named will be
fully treated in their proper place; but a word or two must here be
said concerning the occurrence last mentioned, seeing that it was
fraught with issues of the greatest moment to the colony&mdash;was
in fact the opening of the door to that freedom which as a people
the colonists at the present time enjoy.</p>
<p>In the year 1851 an Elective Act had been passed, establishing
the basis on which members should be returned to the Legislative
Council&mdash;the mixed Council then existing. A new Council came
into existence towards the close of the same year, and one of its
principal functions was to consider the alteration and improvement
of the constitution. The draft of the present Constitution was here
prepared: a Committee was appointed, and the work was done <i>con
amore.</i> The Committee reported in favour of a two-Chamber
Legislature on the English model. The number of members for the
Lower House was fixed at fifty-four, to be chosen by electors
possessing a moderate property qualification. As to the composition
of the Upper House, Wentworth at first proposed the establishment
of a colonial hereditary peerage, to form a House of Lords, but the
notion excited the strongest hostility and the keenest derision,
and he abandoned it. One party was in favour of making the Upper
House elective, but after much discussion, a decision was reached
that the House should be constituted by nomination, and contain not
less than twenty-four members. This constitution embodied
responsible government, and was passed as a schedule to the
Imperial Act of Parliament which is called the Constitution Act. It
was also agreed that the first members should be appointed for five
years, after which life appointments were to be made, unless the
law was altered in the meantime. The bill underwent some slight
alteration in England, but its main principles remained unchanged,
and the Imperial Act, with the Constitution appended as a schedule,
reached the colony in 1855, shortly after Fitzroy's departure, and
on the 24th of November the new order of things was formally
inaugurated by Governor Sir W. T. Denison, who succeeded Fitzroy,
the old Council having been dissolved in the meantime. The first
Parliament under responsible government met on 22nd May, 1856, and
no greater proof of the wisdom and statesmanship of the men who
brought in the era of responsible Government could be found than is
found in the fact that very few alterations in the Constitution
have been needed through the years succeeding, although the colony
has made progress in every direction to an extent never before
known in a similar period in the history of any colony or
nation.</p>
<p>With the inauguration of responsible Government, the autocratic,
arbitrary rule of Governors came to an end. Henceforth the people
were to govern themselves through Parliaments of their own choice.
From being 'a Crown colony of the severest type,' New South Wales
at once became, in the fullest sense of the term, a self-governing
community. Sir Charles Fitzroy was the last of the old
school&mdash;a school never to be re-formed in any place where
British instincts exist or British freedom finds exercise. The
Governors who have held office since Fitzroy's administration
terminated have had their duties well defined, and have simply
served as representatives of the Sovereign in a colony which is
still a dependency of the British Crown.</p>
<p>The story of the Governors is therefore ended. There were ten
from the time of the foundation of the colony to the establishment
of responsible government&mdash;a period of sixty-eight years.
There have been six since then&mdash;Denison, Young, Belmore,
Robinson, Loftus, and Carrington&mdash;and the last-named
representative of Her Majesty holds office in this the Centenary
year of the colony. How long a time will elapse before Government
House becomes the residence of a locally elected President, instead
of a Sovereign's nominee, it is impossible to say; but the signs of
the times will have proved deceptive if when the end of the second
century of its existence arrives the colony is found recognizing
any such thing as Imperial supremacy.</p>

<p>As already stated, the progress made by the colony in every
direction since just before the institution of responsible
government has been phenomenal, and although the writer has no
intention of dealing with that portion of Australian history, he
feels that the present chapters would be incomplete without some
reference thereto. Hence the following statistical epitome, which
will shew in some faint degree what leaps and bounds have been made
since the people, whose foundation was laid in felonry first began
to breathe the air of freedom.</p>
<p>When the census of the inhabitants of the colony was taken in
1836, it amounted to 77,096. In the following year the estimated
population of the colony was 85,267. In 1846 it had increased to
187,413. In 1851 the population (not counting that of Victoria,
which had just then become a separate and distinct colony, and
which was estimated to contain about 100,000 souls) amounted to
187,243. At the end of 1854 the number had mounted up to 251,315.
In 1859 the population numbered 336,572, Queensland at this time
also having been severed from the colony. In 1871 a census of the
whole of the Australasian colonies was taken, and Victoria stood at
the head with 731,528; New South Wales came next with 503,981; New
Zealand next with 256,393; South Australia next with 185,626;
Queensland next with 120,104; Tasmania next with 101,785; and
Western Australia last with 25,353:&mdash;the grand total of white
population in the whole of Australasia being thus 1,924,770. Mr.
Coghlan, the present Government Statistician of the colony,
estimates the population of the Australasian colonies on the 31st
December, 1887, to have been as follows:&mdash;New South Wales,
1,044,000 (approximately); Victoria, 1,035,943; New Zealand,
603,787 (exclusive of 41,828 Maories); Queensland, 359,059; South
Australia, 315,000; Tasmania, 140,711; and Western Australia,
44,532,; making a grand total of 3,543,032 souls.</p>
<p>The density of the population of Australia, compared with its
area, is computed at 1 person to every square mile. America has 6
persons to the square mile; Africa has 17; Asia has 46; and Europe
87. It has been computed by Mr. Hayter (the Victorian Statistician)
that the area of increase of the population of Australia is 42 per
cent. in every decade. At this rate the population in 1901 should
equal 5,678,029; 50 years afterwards it should be 32,782,290; and
in the year 2001 it should be no less than 189,269,663. Did ever
country show greater growth, or give fairer promise for the
future?</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that the full statistics are not available at
the time this is being written, shewing the advancement made up to
the end of 1887&mdash;the closing year of the Centenary; but a fair
idea of the marvellous progress made by New South Wales, after the
separation of Queensland, the youngest of the Australian offshoots,
and which event took place in 1859, may be obtained from a
comparison of the statistics for 1860 and those published for
1886&mdash;the last quarter of the century.</p>
<p>Births, deaths, and marriages in 1860 were severally 14,233,
6,562 and 2,945. In 1886 they were 36,284, 14,587 and 7,811.</p>
<p>In 1860 the arrivals by sea were 23,031, and in 1886 70,388,
while the departures by sea were in the first year 6,847 and 41,896
in 1886.</p>
<p>There were 798 schools in 1861, with 34,767 pupils. In 1886 they
had increased to 2,833, with 226,860 pupils.</p>
<p>In 1860 there were only 70 miles of railway open for traffic,
the capital invested on the open lines being &pound;1,422,672, and the
net earnings &pound;11,841. In 1886 there were 1,971 miles open for
traffic, the expended capital thereon being &pound;24,079,555, and the
net earnings being &pound;667,078.</p>
<p>There were 1616 miles of telegraph in 1861, and the number of
messages sent during that year was 74,204. In 1886 there were
20,797 miles of wire, along which 2,661,126 messages were sent and
received.</p>
<p>In 1860 there were 287 post offices in the colony, through which
there passed 4,230,761 letters, 3,668,783 newspapers, and 83,736
packets. In 1886 there were 1157 offices and the letters,
newspapers and packets to pass through them numbered respectively
42,849,500, 29,532,400 and 4,848,800.</p>
<p>The number of manufactories and works given for 1860 was 567,
but no mention is made of the hands employed. In 1886 there were
3,694 manufactories and 45,783 hands employed therein.</p>
<p>The land under crop in 1860 was 260,798 acres; in 1886 there
were 972,496 acres under cultivation.</p>
<p>The return of live stock in 1860 was:&mdash;Horses, 251,947;
horned cattle, 2,408,586; sheep, 6,119,163; pigs, 180,662. In 1886
the figures were:&mdash;Horses, 361,663; cattle, 1,367,844; sheep,
39,169,304; pigs, 209,576.</p>
<p>368,862 tons of coal, of the value of &pound;226,493 were raised in
1860. In 1886 the quantity raised was 2,830,175 tons, valued at
&pound;1,363,164.</p>
<p>In 1860 there were 12,809,362 lbs of wool exported, of the value
of &pound;1,123,699. The quantity exported in 1886 was 173,985,640 lbs.
of the value of &pound;7,028,596.</p>
<p>Land was sold to the extent of 34,000,000 acres between 1862 and
1886, conditionally or otherwise, and &pound;38,000,000 came into the
Treasury as the result, while at the end of 1886 &pound;12,000,000
remained due on conditional purchases. In 1886 there were
142,927,360 acres under pastoral occupation, yielding as rent
&pound;304,344.</p>
<p>The results of the cultivation of the land, as ascertained up to
March, 1887, were;&mdash;Wheat, 5,868,844 bushels, &pound;953,688 value;
maize, 3,825,146 bushels, &pound;525,958 value; barley, 132,949 bushels,
&pound;18,836 value; oats, 600,892 bushels, &pound;5,578 value; other grain,
22,907 bushels, &pound;1,151 value; wheaten hay, 109,851 tons, &pound;357,016
value; oaten hay, 182,921 tons, &pound;777,414 value; barley hay, 4,388
tons, &pound;14,261 value; lucerne and grass hay, 52,738 tons, &pound;131,845
value; green food for cattle, &pound;84,200 in value; potatoes, 45,803
tons, &pound;103,057 value; sugar cane, 167,959 tons, &pound;98,676 value;
tobacco, 13,642 cwt., &pound;51,157 value; grapes for wine, 602,660
gallons, &pound;120,761 value; grapes for table use, 1,945 tons, &pound;45,221
value; oranges, 6,376,868 dozens, &pound;66,426 value; other fruits and
garden produce, &pound;372,100 in value; minor crops, &pound;153,300 in value.
The total value was &pound;3,943,645.</p>
<p>In 1861 the number of vessels and their tonnage
was&mdash;inwards 1,424 ships, 427,835 tons; outwards 1,438 ships,
431,484 tons. In 1886 the figures were&mdash;inwards 2,684 vessels,
2,114,618 tons; outwards, 2,755 vessels, 2,143,986 tons.</p>
<p>In 1860 the total value of imports and exports was &pound;7,519,285
and &pound;5,072,020. The figures for 1886 are as follow: Imports,
&pound;20,973,548; exports, &pound;15,556,213.</p>
<p>The public debt in 1860 was &pound;3,830,230. It had mounted to
&pound;41,034,249 in 1886.</p>
<p>The revenue in 1860 was &pound;1,308,925, and the expenditure
&pound;1,321,724. In 1886 the revenue was &pound;7,594,301, and the outlay
&pound;9,078,869.</p>
<p>Coin in circulation in 1860 amounted to &pound;2,946,613, and the
deposits in banks to &pound;5,721,690. The figures for 1886 are
&pound;7,801,646, and &pound;31,933,056 respectively.</p>
<p>At the close of 1886, the public and private wealth of the
colony was estimated at &pound;521,000,000; the public wealth, consisting
of railways, public works, unsold Crown lands, municipal property
and works, at &pound;175,128,000; and the private wealth, embracing land,
houses, permanent improvements, stock, personal property,
machinery, coin, merchandise, shipping, etc., at &pound;346,250,000.</p>
<p>Again the question comes&mdash;Did ever country show greater
growth, or give fairer promise for the future? Looking out to that
future from the dawn of the second century, what grander prospect
could any one wish to gaze upon? A free people, under free laws
upon productive land, with all the religious, social, commercial,
and industrial advantages that any nation of far riper years could
possibly desire, who can define the boundaries of the possibilities
which lie before this 'Greater Britain' whose one hundredth
birthday has just been celebrated? Was there not inspiration in the
words uttered by Governor Phillip, when, on the 7th February, 1788,
he made his memorable speech, and said "How grand is the prospect
which lies before the youthful nation!" A century of years has
elapsed since those words were uttered, and the nation is yet a
youth, although the growth to its present stage has been so
exceptionally strong and vigorous and rapid&mdash;a growth
unparalleled in the history of the world. Its ripeness and fullness
of vigour will have been attained when Federated Australia tells
out its unity in name, and effort, and purpose, to the other and
older, but not more important nations of the earth.</p>

FIRST MEN AND WOMEN EXILES&mdash;THEIR NATIONALITY&mdash;THEIR
SENTENCES&mdash;READY TO SAIL.</p>
<p>Transportation is commonly understood to have been first
introduced into the English system of punishments in the year 1718,
by the Act of the 4th George I cap. 11; and afterwards enlarged by
the Act 6th of George I. c. 23; which allowed the court a
discretionary power to order felons who were by law 'entitled to
their clergy' to be transported to the American plantations for
seven or fourteen years, according to circumstances. It is said in
one old work that exile was first introduced as a punishment by the
Legislature in the 39th year of Queen Elizabeth, when a statute
enacted that such rogues as were dangerous to the inferior people
should be banished the realm; and that the first statute in which
the word 'Transportation' is used is the 18th of Charles II. c. 3,
which gives power to judges at their discretion to execute or
transport to America for life the Moss-Troopers of Cumberland and
Northumberland; a law which was made perpetual by the Act 31 George
II. c. 42.</p>
<p>The system of transportation to the American plantations existed
for fifty-six years, during which period, and until the
commencement of the American War, in 1775, great numbers of felons
were sent from England, chiefly to the Province of Maryland. It was
a benefit to England to get rid of her accumulating criminals; it
proved, on the whole, beneficial to the criminals to get out of
England; and, strange though it may seem, great benefit resulted to
the land to which the criminals were transported, the new and
apparently undesirable element thus introduced creating a vigour
and life that was marvellously expansive and far-reaching.</p>
<p>Says one of the writers of the old school, in a 'Treatise on the
Police of the Metropolis,' published in the year 1800:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The rigid discipline which the colonial laws authorised the
masters to exercise over servants, joined to the prospects which
agricultural pursuits, after some experience was acquired, afforded
to these outcasts, tended to reform the chief part; and after the
expiration of their servitude they mingled in the society of the
country, under circumstances highly beneficial to themselves and
even to the colony, possessed in general (as every adroit thief
must be) of good natural abilities, they availed themselves of the
habits of industry they acquired in the years of their
servitude&mdash;became farmers and planters on their own account;
and many of them, succeeding in these pursuits, not only acquired
that degree of respectability which is attached to property and
industry; but also in their turn became masters, and purchased the
servitude of future transports sent out for sale."</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the writer was speaking of the system
as it worked when America was the place of servitude. By the Acts
4th and 6th of George I, previously cited, the persons contracting
for the transportation of convicts to those colonies had an
interest in the service of each, for seven or fourteen years,
according to the term of transportation. For some years previous to
the commencement of the American War of Independence the adjudged
services of convicts became so valuable in Maryland, that contracts
were made to convey them without any expense whatever to
Government, who had formerly allowed &pound;5 per head. And the Home
authorities were not slow to avail themselves of the opportunity of
making money in place of spending it. Planters in the later years
of the operation of the system readily gave &pound;20 per head to the
Government for these outcast human beasts of burden, and one writer
declares that England derived at this time as much as &pound;40,000 per
year from this species of trade.</p>
<p>The following brief sketch will shew to what extent the system
of white slavery was carried on in England in the days preceding
these:&mdash;Although it was one of the requisitions of Magna
Charta that the subject should be protected from imprisonment
otherwise than in due course of law, history records that arbitrary
and illegal punishments were frequently perpetrated with impunity
for a period of three or four hundred years, and that the liberty
of the subject was not materially secured until the passing of the
Habeas Corpus Act in the reign of Charles the Second, by which it
is illegal to detain in prison any person who claims to be tried.
During the reign of James II. tumultuous meetings disturbed the
peace of England. Protestants plotted to declare the Duke of
Monmouth heir to the throne, while the Papists plotted to secure
the succession of the Duke of York, who had been banished.
Monmouth, with 6,000 followers, was defeated on July 5th, 1685, at
Sedgemore. Ten days afterwards Monmouth was beheaded, and the
atrocities perpetrated on his followers were such as England never
before witnessed. Colonel 'Kirke's Lambs,' as the Feversham troops
were called, pillaged and committed every species of debauchery in
the western counties, while Chief Justice 'Jeffries' Campaign,' as
James II. loved to call it, exceeded the military atrocities.
Jeffries executed 240 of the political offenders in one sessions at
Somerset, and it was his boast that he hanged more traitors than
all his predecessors since the Conquest. General orders were given
Jeffries and the judges to convict as many as they could, in order
that the convicts might be bestowed as rewards on the courtiers.
One of the orders directed that Sir Phillip Howard was to have 200,
Sir Richard White 200, Sir W. Booth 100, Mr. Kendall 100, Mr. Nipps
100, Sir W. Stappleton 100, Sir C. Musgrave 100, and&mdash;&mdash;,
a merchant, 100. Jeffries estimated the worth of each convict,
after paying all charges, from &pound;10 to &pound;20, consequently there was
an angry competition for grants among the courtiers, the aldermen
and the magistrates. The courtiers proved victorious, and 841 of
Monmouth's followers (who were generally regarded as martyrs who
sealed with their blood the truth of the Protestant religion) were
handed over to 'the rapacious bloodsuckers,' who were required to
give security that the convicts should be sold as slaves to work in
the King's plantations at Jamaica, Barbadoes, or any of the Leeward
islands in America for the term of 10 years. About the same time
the followers of the Duke of Argyle (who was beheaded in Scotland
for heading a rebellion in that country) were, by order of the
Privy Council, transported as slaves to Jamaica. Owing to the
brutal disposition of the judges, and the arbitrary power they were
armed with, few of those indicated escaped terrible punishment.
Those transported were crowded together in the holds of small
vessels, where all was starvation, lamentation, disease, and death.
More than one-fifth were flung to the sharks before the voyage
terminated, and the survivors, when landed, were mere skeletons,
necessitating their being fattened by the merchants to whom they
were consigned before they could be sold in the slave market.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to deal more fully with this part of the
subject; and I have simply used it as an introduction to the larger
and more comprehensive portions. America having shut the doors on
that side, the authorities in England were compelled to look out
for some other place that could be used as a moral rubbish heap.
Convicts were accumulating rapidly, and it became indispensably
necessary to adopt fresh expedients for their disposal; and in the
choice of difficulties the system of the Hulks was suggested, and
first adopted in 1776, under the authority of an Act of Parliament.
Close following this another Act was passed (16 Geo. III. cap. 43)
by the Legislature, empowering the justices of every county in
England to prepare Houses of Correction for the reception of
convicts under sentence of death, to whom His Majesty should extend
his Royal Mercy, to be kept at hard labour for a term not exceeding
ten years. Three years afterwards another Act was passed, providing
for the erection of two large Penitentiaries, one to hold 600 male
and the other 300 female convicts. Power was given to the Court
before whom any person was convicted of a transportable offence to
order the prisoner, in lieu thereof, to be confined in any of these
penitentiary houses, there to be kept to hard labour in the
proportion of five years instead of seven years' transportation,
and not exceeding seven years in lieu of fourteen years'
transportation. The Act also provided for the continuation of the
system of the Hulks; and declared that 'for the more effectual
punishment of atrocious male offenders liable to be transported,
the Court may order such convicts as are of proper age, and free
from bodily infirmity, to be punished by being kept on board ships
or vessels, and employed in raising sand, soil and gravel, and
cleansing the river Thames, or any other river or port approved by
the Privy Council; or in any other works upon the shores or banks
of the same, for a term not less than one year nor more than five;
except an offender be liable to transportation for 14 years, in
which case his punishment may be commuted to seven years on board
the Hulks. Neither of these Acts were, however, carried fully into
execution, and the authorities again began to consider how best to
get the criminals out of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>In the year 1784 the system of transportation was again revived
by Act 24th Geo. III. Stat. 2, Cap. 26, which empowered the Court
before whom a male felon should be convicted, to order the prisoner
'to be transported beyond the seas, either within his Majesty's
dominions, or elsewhere; and his services to be assigned to the
contractor who shall undertake such transportation.' The same Act
continued the Hulks for a further length of time, by directing the
removal of convicts under sentence of death, and reprieved by His
Majesty, and also such as were under sentence of transportation
(being free from infectious disorders) to other places of
confinement, either inland, or on board of any ship or vessel in
the River Thames, or any other navigable river; and to continue
them so confined until transported according to law, or until the
expiration of the term of the sentence should otherwise entitle
them to their liberty. This plan of transportation, however, does
not seem to have answered, from the great difficulty of finding any
place where the service of convicts could be rendered reproductive
or profitable to merchants who would undertake to transport them.
Some few were sent to Africa, but the scheme did not work well, and
it was abandoned&mdash;not, however, before the Government had
incurred considerable expense, as is proved by the following
extract from one of the reports of the Select Committee on
Finance:&mdash;</p>

<p>Then it was that the authorities turned their eyes to the land
which Cook had discovered in the South. They formed the idea of
'making an Establishment' for the outcasts in New South Wales; and
that idea was followed up by determination, which found force in
the year 1787, when an Act was passed (27 Geo. III. Cap. 2)
authorising the establishment of a Court of Judicature for the
trial of offenders who should be transported to the then unknown
land. Another Act of the following year (28 Geo. III. Cap. 24),
empowered His Majesty, under his Royal Sign Manual, to authorise
any person to make contracts for the transportation of offenders,
and to direct to whom security should be given for the due
performance of the contract. Thus it was that the system of
transportation to New South Wales was authorised and carried into
execution.</p>
<p>The idea that Australia was the best country to succeed the
American colonies and Africa as the receptacle of convicts from the
overcrowded gaols of England originated with Thomas Lord Sydney,
who was Secretary of State for the colonies from 1784 to 1789. The
objects of the project were:&mdash;(1). To rid the mother country
of the prisoners whose rapidly increasing numbers in the gaols
rendered penal discipline so difficult; (2). to afford a proper
place for the safe custody and punishment of the criminals, as well
as for their reformation; (3). to form a free colony out of the
materials which the prisoners thus reformed would supply, together
with the free immigrants who might settle in the country after the
work of settlement had been completed. The project was a wise one,
but it did not meet with the approval of a few of the leading
philanthropists of England, who stoutly opposed it by tongue and
pen, and this opposition was only borne down by the Government
gagging the press, imprisoning one of the foremost objectors, and
carrying on their work in secret. When their scheme was complete,
in August, 1786, the Commissioners of the King's navy, having been
furnished with a statement shewing all the criminals sentenced to
transportation, published advertisements in the official
<i>Gazette</i> and the <i>London Observer</i> intimating that the
Government intended to charter seven vessels to convey between 700
and 800 felons to Botany Bay. They also posted placards conveying
the same intimation at the most popular coffee-houses in London.
The result was that the Treasury Board shortly thereafter concluded
a contract with the owners of six vessels to convey the criminals
to the new country. Three storeships were also engaged to accompany
the fleet, and H.M.S. 'Sirius,' mounted with 20 guns, and an armed
brig, the 'Supply,' were placed in commission. As it was expected
that the voyage would last nearly a year, the work of fitting and
equipping the vessels therefor was one of considerable magnitude,
and several months elapsed before it was complete.</p>
<p>At different times the transports were loaded with their living
freight, until the whole of the convicts had been 'housed' in
safety, being placed in irons (the females excepted) in the holds
of the vessels, which were divided into compartments. When the
squadron was ready to sail the total number of persons on board was
1036, and comprised 11 officials of the civil establishment, 18
officers forming the military staff, 184 marines from which the
garrison was formed, 28 women, wives of the marines, with 17 of
their children; and 586 male and 192 female convicts.</p>
<p>As it is with the prisoners that I have to chiefly deal, it is
necessary that a few particulars concerning their characters should
here be given. Many persons have taken it for granted that the men
and women who were honoured with the title of 'first fleeters' were
necessarily first ruffians&mdash;villains of the deepest
dye&mdash;the worst of all the bad convicts of all England,
Scotland, and Ireland. But nothing could be farther from the truth.
They were in fact the picked men and women of the gaols, the major
part being (to use the words of Captain Tench, who commanded one of
the transports) "mechanics and husbandmen, selected on purpose by
order of the Government." It must not be forgotten that in those
days sentences of death were as frequently passed by the judges as
magistrates' orders to inebriates to pay a fine of five shillings
are made now-a-days, and the 'crimes' to which the capital sentence
was attached were, some of them, not so bad as the offence of
drunkenness. Hence transportation was inflicted on
hundreds&mdash;it may not be beyond the mark to say
thousands&mdash;who were guilty of offences which in the present
age are accounted most trifling, and which are now punished with a
small fine, or at most a few weeks' imprisonment. It is on record
that in 1789 a wealthy gentleman named Eyre was transported to
Botany Bay for stealing a few quires of notepaper, and hundreds
were sent across the seas for offences not in any degree greater
than that. As late as 1818 a reverend doctor, who was tutor to the
Earl of Chesterfield was transported hither for forging a tenpenny
postage stamp to a letter. That gentleman&mdash;for he was a
gentleman in every sense of the word&mdash;afterwards became famous
in the land to which he was sent as a felon.</p>
<p>As previously stated, the number of convicts brought out in the
first fleet was 778. It is stated that only those whose health was
robust were chosen as the first Australian exiles, and this no
doubt explains how it was that so few of the 'first fleeters' died
on the voyage out, and how it was that so many of them lived to
become very old colonists. From the returns furnished by the
officials I find that of the 778, no less than 265 were convicted
in London, 55 in Exeter, 25 in Bristol, 18 in Gloucester, 18 in
Launceston, 16 in Kingston, 14 in Maidstone, 13 in Reading, 12 in
Winchester, 12 in Shrewsbury, 12 in Manchester, 10 in Worcester, 9
in Warwick, 9 in Dorchester, and several in each of the towns of
Liverpool, York, Croydon, Oxford, and other places. Out of the 778
exiles nearly 700 were sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment, and the
sentences of 5 of them commenced in 1782, 41 in 1783, 190 in 1784,
209 in 1785, 168 in 1786, and 51 in 1787. There were 4 of the
exiles who had in 1786 been sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment, and
only 24 sentenced to 14 years in 1785 and 1786. Only 39 were
sentenced to penal servitude for life, and 17 of this number were
convicted in 1785. So that before the colony had been established
five years no less than 650 of the 778 had served their sentences
and become free.</p>
<p>Having thus briefly traced the initial steps of the
transportation movement, to the point when everything was in
readiness for the order to be given for the ships to hoist sail and
start on their adventurous journey, it will be interesting to more
fully dwell upon the penal laws in operation in England at that
time; and this cannot properly be done unless a full chapter is
devoted to the subject.</p>

THE OLD WORLD TO MEET HIM IN THE NEW.</p>
<p>It was Draco who boasted that he punished all crimes with death,
because small crimes deserved it, and he could find no higher
punishment for the greatest; and the spirit of that bloodthirsty
ruler appears to have breathed in the Criminal Code of England more
than 2000 years after he had passed beyond the power of punishing
others. The severity of that criminal law, as it stood and operated
as late as the year 1800&mdash;to come no nearer the present
enlightened age&mdash;was even then an object of horror, and the
disproportion of the punishments was such as would have put any
savage nation to the blush. The extraordinary severity with which
the smaller offences were punished had the effect of inuring men to
baseness, and of plunging them into the sink of infamy and despair,
out of which they invariably arose capital criminals. What wonder
that the gaols should overflow and that the hangmen should be kept
incessantly at work!</p>
<p>It was considered by the Law a greater crime to coin a sixpence
than to kill father or mother. For committing a personal assault of
the most cruel, aggravated, and violent nature the offender was
simply fined or imprisoned; but if he were proved guilty of
stealing from his neighbour more than the value of twelve-pence the
Law doomed him to death. It was death to rob a man of more than a
shilling; it was only death to murder a whole family; but the
seduction of a married woman, involving the destruction of the
peace and happiness of families, was not an offence punishable by
the criminal law at all. Is it not a fact that there is still a
little of the old leaven left?</p>
<p>The Legislature drew a broad line of distinction between
personal and public offences, and inflicted greater punishments
upon offenders who committed what were termed political crimes, and
crimes upon property, than on those who grossly violated the
clearest principles of virtue. By the Laws of England there were
above <i>one hundred and sixty</i> different offences which
subjected the parties who were found guilty thereof to "death,
without benefit of Clergy." Well might Dr. Colquhoun ask, when
seeking to effect a reform in the Law in 1800:&mdash;"Can that be
thought a correct System of Jurisprudence which inflicts the
penalty of Death for breaking down the mound of a fish-pond,
whereby the fish may escape; or cutting down a fruit tree in a
garden or orchard; or stealing a handkerchief, or any trifle,
privately from a person's pocket, above the value of 12d.; while a
number of other crimes of much greater enormity, are only
punishable with Transportation and Imprisonment; and while the
punishment of murder itself is, and can be, only Death, with a few
circumstances of additional ignominy?"</p>
<p>As the term 'Benefit of Clergy' will be found attached to many
sentences, an explanation thereof will be proper
here:&mdash;Benefit of Clergy, <i>privilegium clericale</i> arose
in the regard paid by Christian Princes to the church, and
consisted of: 1st, an exemption of places consecrated to religious
duties from criminal arrests, which was the foundation of
'sanctuaries;' 2nd, exemption of the persons of Clergymen from
criminal process before the secular judge, in particular cases,
which was the original meaning of the <i>privilegium clericale.</i>
The 'benefit of clergy' was afterwards extended to everyone who
could read; and it was enacted that there should be a prerogative
allowed to the clergy, that if any man who could read were to be
condemned to death, the bishop of the diocese might, if he would,
claim him as a clerk, and dispose of him in some places of the
clergy, as he might deem meet. The ordinary gave the prisoner at
the bar a Latin book, in a black Gothic character, from which to
read a verse or two; and if the ordinary said <i>"legit ut
clericus"</i> ("He reads like a clerk"), the offender was only
burnt in the hand; otherwise, he suffered death. This was in the
time of Edward I (1274). In 1849 the privilege was restricted by
Henry VII; and abolished, with respect to murderers and other great
criminals, by Henry VIII, in 1512. The reading was discontinued in
1706 (5 Anne, c. 6); and Benefit of Clergy was wholly repealed in
1827, by 7 and 8 George IV, c. 28.</p>
<p>The highest civil crime which could be committed by any person
was High Treason, which was divided into seven different heads,
namely:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Compassing or <i>imagining</i> the death of the King, Queen,
or Heir Apparent.<br>
2. Levying war against the King in his realm.<br>
3. Adhering to the King's enemies, and giving them aid, in the
realm or elsewhere.<br>
4. Slaying the King's Chancellor or Judge in the execution of their
offices.<br>
5. Violating the Queen, the eldest daughter of the King, or the
wife of the Heir Apparent, or eldest Son.<br>
6. Counterfeiting the King's Great Seal, or Privy Seal.<br>
7. Counterfeiting the King's Money, or bringing false Money into
the Kingdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is something supremely ridiculous in this blending of
crimes, the dignity and security of the King's person being
confounded with his effigies imprest on his coin. It was as great a
crime to forge the impress on the one as to strike the head from
the other. The punishment for High Treason was death&mdash;and
death under circumstances most horrifying in their brutality, the
judgment being:&mdash;<i>"That the offender be drawn to the
gallows, on the ground or pavement: That he be hanged by the neck,
and then cut down alive: That his entrails be taken out and burned
while he is yet alive: That his head be cut off: That his body be
divided into four parts: And that his head and quarters be at the
King's disposal."</i> Women, however, were only to be drawn and
hanged, although previous to this period they were sentenced to be
burned. One marvels that judges could be found to pass such a
sentence as this, and that any community, however much borne down
by militaryism, could suffer it to be carried out. Surely there
were some who shuddered at the thought of imbruing their hands in
blood, and mangling the smoking entrails of their fellow-creatures!
In its severity the law of China was not more rigorous, for
traitors under it were only ordained to be cut into a thousand
pieces.</p>
<p>Petty Treason&mdash;defined as the offence of 'a servant killing
his master, a wife killing her husband, or a Secular or Religious
killing his Prelate'&mdash;was also punishable with death.</p>
<p>The offences denominated Felonies ranked next in enormity to
Treason, and the capital punishment attached to nearly all of them.
Felonies were of two kinds&mdash;public and private. Public
felonies were those which had peculiar relation to the
State&mdash;those relative (1). to the coin of the realm; (2). to
the King and his Counsellors; (3). to soldiers and marines; (4). to
embezzling public property; (5). to riot and sedition; (6). to
escape from prison; and (7). to revenue and trade. Amongst private
felonies the following offences were classed:&mdash;murder,
manslaughter, sodomy, rape, forcible marriage, polygamy, maiming,
simply larceny, 'mixed larceny,' piracy, arson, and burglary. After
the murderer had suffered death his body was handed over for
dissection, and (as also in the case of the suicide) his property
was confiscated to the State. The punishment for manslaughter was
burning in the offender's hand and having his goods forfeited.
Unnatural crime and rape were punishable with death, as also was
the offence called 'Forcible Marriage, or Defilement of Women;' but
in the latter case the security of property was deemed to be more
important than the preservation of chastity&mdash;thus: It was made
felony without the benefit of clergy to take away, for lucre, any
woman having lands or goods, or being an heir apparent to an
estate, by force or against her will, and to marry or to defile
her; but the forcible marriage or defilement of a woman without an
estate was not made punishable at all. Like some of the Knights of
old, the Law was very chivalrous towards ladies who possessed the
high virtue of wealth! Thank God, the chivalry of our day is more
far-reaching than was that of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Polygamy was first declared felony by the statute of James the
First, Cap. II., but not excluded from benefit of clergy, and
offenders were not, therefore, subject to the death penalty.
Transportation was the punishment, but no record has been found to
shew that any of the convicts who came to New South Wales had a
plurality of wives before they left the 'old
country'&mdash;although not a few of them committed bigamy after
their arrival here, the 'first love' being separated by a wide
expanse of ocean from the second.</p>
<p>Mayhem was defined to be 'maiming, cutting the tongue, or
putting out the eyes of any of the King's liege people, slitting
the nose, cutting off a nose or lip, or cutting off or disabling
any limb or member, by malice forethought and by lying in wait with
an intention to maim or disfigure.' The offence was punishable with
death.</p>
<p>Simple Larceny was divided into two parts, viz.&mdash;Grand
Larceny and Petit Larceny. The first was defined to be 'the
felonious taking and carry away the mere personal property or goods
of another, above the value of twelve-pence,' and was punished with
death and the forfeiture of property. Petit larceny was where the
goods were under the value of twelve-pence, and in this case the
punishment was (according to the character of the offence)
imprisonment, whipping, or transportation, with forfeiture of goods
and chattels.</p>
<p>The taking from a man or from his house was called Mixed
Larceny; if a person was previously put in fear or assaulted the
crime was denominated Robbery. The following 'domestic
aggravations' of Larceny were punishable with death, without
benefit of clergy:&mdash;<i>First, larcenies above the value of
twelve-pence</i>, committed&mdash;1st, in a church or chapel, with
or without violence or breaking the same; 2nd, in a booth or tent,
a market or fair, in the daytime or in the night, by violence or
breaking the same, the owner or some of his family being therein;
3rd, by robbing a dwelling in the daytime, any person being
therein; in a dwelling-house by day or by night, without breaking,
any person being therein, and put in fear. (This amounted to
robbery, and in both the last cases the accessory before the fact
was also excluded from benefit of clergy.) <i>Secondly, larcenies
to the value of five shillings,</i> committed:&mdash;1st, by
breaking any dwelling house, outhouse, shop, or warehouse thereunto
belonging in the daytime; 2nd, by privately stealing goods, wares,
or merchandise in any shop, warehouse, coach-house, or stable, by
day or night, though the same was not broken open, and though no
person was therein. <i>Thirdly, larcenies to the value of forty
shillings,</i> from a dwelling house or its outhouses, although the
same be not broken, and whether any person be therein or not,
unless committed upon their masters by apprentices under the age of
fifteen years.</p>
<p>Arson was a capital offence, although if a man burned his own
house, without injuring any other, it was only counted a
misdemeanour, and was punished by fine, imprisonment, or the
pillory. The capital part of the offence was extended to persons
burning barns or stacks of corn or setting fire to stacks of straw,
hay or wood, or rescuing any such offender; setting fire to a coal
mine, windmill, watermill or other mill, or pulling down the same;
burning any ship; burning the King's ships of war, afloat or
building, the Dock-yards, or any of the buildings, arsenals, or
stores therein: or <i>threatening</i> by anonymous or fictitious
letters to burn houses, barns, &amp;c. All these offences were made
felony without benefit of clergy. Burglary was also punishable by
death, and accessories before the fact were also brought under the
capital sentence.</p>
<p>The other principal crimes punishable by the deprivation of
life, or where, upon the conviction of the offender, the judge had
to pronounce sentence of death, were:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br>
Stealing an heiress; Forgery of deeds, bonds, &amp;c.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>The attachment of such heavy punishment to offences of the most
trivial kind created a wide-spread feeling against prosecuting
offenders in the minds of the pubic; and the consequence was that a
large amount of petty crime was allowed to go unpunished. And even
when sentence was passed it was in many cases not carried out. A
few sentences from Dr. Colquhoun's 'Treaties on the Police of the
Metropolis,'&mdash;1780, will shew the reader how this happened. He
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It generally happens in the metropolis that out of from 2,000
to 2,500 prisoners who are tried for different crimes in the
various Courts of Justice, above five-sixth parts are for
larcenies, acts of vagrancy and smaller offences, where the Benefit
of Clergy either attaches, or does not apply at all. The major part
are, of course, returned upon Society, after a short imprisonment,
or some corporal punishment, so frequently to renew their
depredations on the public. But a vast proportion are always
acquitted. (He shews by statistics that out of 1894 prisoners tried
at the Old Bailey and the different assizes in the country, in the
years 1795, exclusive of a greater number at the smaller Courts, no
less than 845 were acquitted, chiefly for want of prosecutors).</p>
<p>"According to the present system, out of about two hundred and
upwards who are, upon an average every year, doomed to suffer the
punishment of death, four-fifths, or more are generally pardoned,
either on condition of being transported or of going into his
Majesty's service, and not seldom without any condition at all.
Hence it is that, calculating on all the different chances,
encouragement to commit crimes actually arise out of the system
intended for their prevention&mdash;first, from the hope of
avoiding detection and apprehension; secondly, of escaping
conviction, from the means used to vitiate and suborn the evidence;
thirdly, from the mercy of the jury, in considering the punishment
too severe; and fourthly, from the interest of persons of rank or
consideration applying for the interference of Royal mercy, by
pardons.</p>
<p>"Thus we see that the laws of England at the time Transportation
to Australia was instituted had a most pernicious effect. On the
one hand cruelty in punishment for slight offences often induced,
or drove, the offenders to pass on from the trifling to the more
atrocious crimes on the principle that they might just as well be
hanged for a sheep as for a lamb; on the other hand, it tended to
multiply offences, men generally having a disinclination to
prosecute, and the viciously-inclined taking advantage thereof in
order to indulge their inclinations.</p>
<p>"This was the condition of affairs when the ships under Governor
Phillip left their anchorage to bear across the seas the seeds of
the 'Greater Britain in the Southern World'&mdash;and for many
years thereafter. Yet there be people who sigh for the 'good old
times!' The good Lord deliver us from ever falling back upon such
times as those!</p>
<p>"The punishment, then, considered in point of law next to that
of deprivation of life was Transportation, and when this new field
across the seas was opened up sentences of transportation in many
cases were substituted for sentences of death, and many a poor
wretch owed his life to the occupancy of the 'new land' by the
British; although, as will be seen during the progress of this
story, not a few of them escaped the gallows in the old country to
find it in the new, or to enter upon a course of suffering a
thousand times worse than death."</p>

<p>A voyage from England to the Antipodes in 1787 was not such a
pleasurable thing to contemplate or experience as it is in the day
and generation now existing. The century has worked it changes, and
in nothing have the changes been more marked than in that of the
'art' of navigation. The thirty days' pleasure trip of 1887 was the
nine-months' hazardous voyage of 1787, and it was upon this voyage
that the First Fleet started on the 7th May in the year last
mentioned. It will be interesting to note a few of the details of
the voyage, as they have come down to us through various
sources.</p>
<p>The first difficulty which presented itself was one connected
with the seamen, who, when the fleet had been got under weigh,
refused to proceed to sea unless their wages were paid up to date.
The fleet was brought to an anchor and the ringleaders in the
disturbance having been ordered on board H. M. frigate Hyaena, 24
guns, (which had been told off to see the fleet safely down the
channel and one hundred leagues to sea), and an advance of two
months' wages having been paid to the crews of the transports, the
difficulty was removed, another start was made. At daybreak on May
16th, the English Channel was cleared.</p>
<p>One of the earlier convicts, who afterwards became somewhat
famous in New South Wales, thus describes the embarkation and
initial movements of the floating 'Black Marias' employed to convey
exiles to the new land, and his narrative may be taken as fairly
descriptive of the first voyage undertaken:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My fellow prisoners, to the amount of upwards of 200, were all
ordered into the hold, which was rendered as convenient as
circumstances would admit, battens being fixed fore and aft for
hammocks, which were hung 17 inches apart from each other; but
being encumbered with their irons, together with the want of fresh
air, soon rendered their situation truly deplorable. To alleviate
their condition, as much as was consistent with the safety of the
ship, they were permitted to walk the deck in turns, ten at a time;
the women, of whom we had six, had a snug berth made for them, and
were kept by themselves.</p>
<p>"My messmate, the boatswain (the writer had purchased certain
privileges above his fellows, having a little money and some
influential friends) had provided me with a neat slung hammock, and
gave me a berth next his own; at the same time addressing some of
his shipmates who were present, with,&mdash;'Lookee, my hearties,
as I know you are all above distressing a gentleman under
misfortune, I'm sure you will consent to his having this here
berth; but if so be as how any of you don't like it, why, you may
have mine&mdash;it isn't the first time I have prick'd for the
softest plank.'" Whether from the oratory of my new friend, or the
insinuating appearance of a large can of flip, produced from an
ample liquor case, which promised a succession of the same
arguments, the iron muscles of his auditors were softened down to a
significant smile, and universal nod of assent. The settling of
this important business afforded me great satisfaction, as it not
only assured me a comfortable berth for my hammock, but a place
also for my little property, which I should have immediately under
my eye.</p>
<p>"We lay about a week at Long Reach, when we dropt down to
Gravesend; here the captain came on board, and some soldiers of the
New South Wales Corps; we got under weigh the next morning, and
proceeded to the Downs; it blowing strong to the westward, we came
to an anchor. The wind veering about we were at daybreak again
under sail, and arrived at the Mother Bank, where lay several other
transports for the same destination.</p>
<p>"It was about ten days before we were ready to sail from hence,
the interval being employed in getting fresh stock and replenishing
our water. On the report of our being ready for sea being made to
the admiral, a lieutenant of the navy came on board, as agent for
transports, and immediately made the signal for the masters of the
other ships to come on board, to whom he delivered their sailing
instructions, and on the following morning made the signal to
weigh. By a quarter past 9 we were under easy sail, and it blowing
a stiff easterly breeze, we ran through the Needles. It was
delightful weather, and the prospect on each hand must have
afforded the most agreeable sensation to every beholder, being,
perhaps, as rich and luxuriant as is anywhere to be met with; but,
alas! it only brought a fresh pang to the bosom of one who in all
probability was bidding it adieu forever.</p>
<p>"The weather continuing moderate, and the wind fair, we
imperceptibly glided down the Channel, and had lost sight of Old
England, before I turned out the next morning. My frequent trips
from Ireland to England had in some measure inured me to salt
water, nor did I want my sea-legs in a most violent gale which took
place the third day after we lost sight of the land and which for
near ten hours baffled the skill of all hands. Two men were blown
from the maintop-sail yard and the sail split to ribbons; all our
endeavours to save the men proved ineffectual. Soon after our
fore-topmast went over the side, and carried four men and two boys
with it; but they were providentially taken up, having kept fast by
the wreck."</p>
<p>It would serve no good purpose to speculate concerning the
sorrowful and melancholy emotions that must have filled the breasts
of the exiles as the shores of their native land were gradually
lost to their sight, and they fully realized that they were bound
for an unknown country in the far distance. Concerning this matter,
one of the officials, Captain Tench says:&mdash;"The general marks
of distress were more perceptible among the men than the women, for
I recollect to have seen but one of these affected on the occasion,
'some natural tears she dropped, but wiped them soon.' After this
the accent of sorrow was no longer heard, more genial skies and
change of scene banished repining, and regret and discontent, and
introduced in their stead cheerfulness and acquiescence in a lot
now not to be altered."</p>
<p>Governor Phillip having received from the commanding officers of
the transports favorable reports concerning the conduct of the
convicts, before the fleet had been at sea many days humanely
issued instructions for the masters of the ships to release the
male convicts from their irons, so that they could strip their
clothes off at night, and during the day wash and keep themselves
clean. This order extended to the whole of the exiles, without
exception, no danger of an uprising being apprehended, and the
number of marines on board the vessels carrying the males being
considered sufficiently large to quell any disturbance, should any
arise. But this partial freedom had only been in operation for
three days when a scheme was concocted by some of the wilder
spirits on board, which, if it had been successful, would have
resulted in more trouble than one could easily imagine. Here is the
story, as told by the privileged convict from whose history a few
sentences have already been quoted:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The captain, with great humanity, had released the convicts,
many of whom were in a weakly state, from their irons; and, as I
have before observed, they were allowed alternately, ten at a time,
to walk on deck. Two of them&mdash;Americans, who had some
knowledge of navigation, prevailed upon a majority of their
comrades to attempt seizing the ship impressing them with the idea
that it would be easily effected, and that they would carry her to
America, where every man would not only attain his liberty, but
receive a tract of land from Congress, besides a share of the money
arising from the sale of the ship and cargo. These arguments had
the desired effect, and it was determined the first opportunity
that a part of those on the deck, should, while the officers were
at dinner, force the arm-chest, which was kept on the quarter-deck,
at the same time make a signal to two of them, who should be
keeping the sentinels in discourse, to attack them, get possession
of their arms, and pass the word for those below to rush upon
deck.</p>
<p>"This conspiracy was conducted with the greatest secrecy, and
put in execution with equal spirit and audacity. A favorable
opportunity presenting itself, the captain and most of the officers
being below examining the storage of some wine, a cask having
leaked out in the spirit room, I was the only person on the deck
excepting the man at the helm. Hearing a scuffle on the main deck,
I was going forward but was stopped by one of the Americans,
followed by another convict, who made a stroke at me with a sword
he had wrested from one of the sentinels, which was put aside by a
pistol which the other had just snapped at me. I snatched a
handspike luckily in my reach, and brought the foremost to the
ground. The man at the helm had quitted the wheel and called up the
captain. I still kept my situation, guarding the passage of the
quarter-deck, my antagonists having retreated a few paces, but
being joined by many others, were rushing on me, when the discharge
of a blunderbuss from behind me amongst them wounding several, they
retreated, and I was immediately joined by the captain and the rest
of the officers, who, in a few minutes, drove them all into the
hold. An attempt of this kind required the most exemplary
punishment, and accordingly two of the ring-leaders were instantly
hung at the yard-arm, and several others severely flogged at the
gangway. As soon as the conspirators were re-ironed, and the
tranquillity of the ship restored, the captain paid me many
compliments in having, as he was pleased to say, saved the ship,
and assured me that when we arrived at the Cape he should, on the
part of his owners, think it his duty to reward the services I had
by my courage and presence of mind rendered them; at the same time
he gave the steward orders to supply me with anything I might have
occasion for from his storeroom during the voyage."</p>
<p>I have preferred to take this account from one who actually
witnessed the incipient insurrection, rather than that supplied by
an historian of our own times, whose brief narrative runs
thus:&mdash;"The indulgence (freedom from irons) had only been
enjoyed three days when an exile on board the Scarborough revealed
to Captain Shea a scheme which many of the exiles had proposed to
make themselves masters of the ship and sail away as pirates. When
Governor Phillip heard of the intended insurrection he ordered the
two ringleaders to be brought on board the Sirius, and
interrogated. The men steadfastly denied the existence of the
design imputed to them, and being adjudged guilty they each
received two dozen lashes at the hands of the boatswain's mate,
were heavily ironed, and sent on board the Prince of Wales. The two
informers received pardons, and were landed (where?), while the
whole of the exiles, for the wrong-doing of a few, were ordered to
be confined with additional security." The first story is the
simplest. It bears the impress of truth upon the face of it; and
having been published in the year 1803, when many of the officials
and convicts must still have been living, the story would most
certainly have been contradicted if the facts mentioned in it had
been only 'truth inverted.'</p>
<p>No other attempt at insurrection was made during the voyage, but
an unsuccessful attempt to escape from one of the transports was
made by a convict, named Power, on the night of June 7th, when the
fleet was anchored in the road of Santa Cruz. Power slid down a
rope at the ship's bows into a boat, and in it reached a Dutch East
Indiaman, but the captain refused to receive him as a seaman, and
he then pulled ashore. A search was instituted for the missing man,
and he was found on the following day secreted in the cavity of a
rock, the face of which he had been unable to climb. He was offered
the choice between surrendering and being shot, and having
surrendered was first severely punished and then heavily ironed as
a relief.</p>
<p>It was daylight on June 3rd that the Island of Teneriffe was
sighted, and when the ships had anchored in the bay of Santa Cruz
the Sirius was boarded by the port officer and some Spanish
noblemen, and fraternal greetings were exchanged. The Governor of
Teneriffe extended the greatest hospitality to the representative
of the British Government, and entertained Captain Phillip and his
officers right loyally rendering great service in supplying the
fleet with necessary refreshments. In acknowledging the thanks
conveyed to him just prior to the departure of the fleet, the
Governor said he felt an interest in the new settlement, the extent
and situation of which had been shewn him on a chart of the world,
and expressed a hope that it would answer "the anticipations of
those who had entered as volunteers on so novel and very uncertain
a service." No persons could have a better opportunity of deciding
whether those anticipations have been realized than the people who
now swarm over the land to which the faces of the voyagers were
then turned.</p>
<p>On the 18th some of the transports had a narrow escape of
running on the Bonavista rocks, which endangered Captain Cook's
ship on his last voyage, the weather being remarkably hazy; and
when approaching the equator, after having encountered the trade
winds, and experienced delay through heavy squalls, the weather was
so insufferably hot and oppressive that many of the female
convicts, as also not a few of the men, fainted away and were
afflicted with fits. But in the midst of all their trouble the
seamen on board the transports gave themselves up to the
performances attendant upon 'crossing the line.'</p>
<p>These performances have been thus minutely described by the
convict Barrington in his account of the voyage across the
water:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The ceremony of ducking and shaving was punctually observed. At
noon a hoarse voice hailed the ship, as from the sea, with 'Ho! the
ship, ho!' which was answered by one stationed for that purpose
with 'Hallo! what ship's that?' 'The Albemarle.' 'I don't recollect
her passing this way before&mdash;I shall come on board and examine
her.' Upon which half a dozen most grotesque figures entered the
ship, as if from the bosom of the deep, having previously slung a
grating under each bow as a stage to ascend from. With great
solemnity they proceeded to the quarter-deck. The principal persons
were Neptune and Amphitrite, attended by their nymphs and neriads,
personated by the oldest seamen in the ship, but so disfigured with
red ochre, robes, and wigs made of ravelled spun yarn, that it was
a difficult matter to recognise their persons. After receiving a
double toll from the captain, it being the first time of the ship's
crossing the line, consisting of half a gallon of liquor and two
pounds of sugar, they in turn questioned every person on deck. When
anyone said he had crossed before, and had not, his watery majesty,
with great dignity, turning to one of his attendants, who held a
large book, said, 'Look if you have this gentleman down in my log
book?' which being answered in the negative, the rum and sugar were
instantly demanded. Having finished with the quarter-deck, they
proceeded to the examination of their own comrades, after having
prepared for the ceremony of treating those who could not pay with
a view of Neptune's collar. For this purpose they had made a tackle
fast to the main-yard arm, through which they rove a rope, with an
iron crow made fast to the end for a seat, The only exhibition was
on the person of the cook, who, not being of the most conciliatory
disposition, most of the ship's company owed him a grudge; and as
he peremptorily refused to pay, though in his power, they placed
him on the crow and brought the yard-rope between his legs, making
another fast round him, to prevent the possibility of his falling.
They then swung him off, and running him close up to the yard,
soused the poor devil from the height of near fifty feet into the
water. This they performed thrice. When they took him on board he
was so exhausted that his life was thought in danger, which put an
end to this part of the ceremony, and the other defaulters were let
off with only a shaving, performed by Neptune and his assistants.
The party was seated on a piece of board placed across a large tub;
the razor, part of an iron hoop, and the soap, not the finest
Windsor, but a composition of tar, tallow, and every filth they
could collect. The disagreeableness of this operation, exclusive of
the smart, the hand of the shaver not being of the lightest,
occasions a struggle to get from under it, in which the board
whereon he is seated gives way, and the poor pilgarlick is
unexpectedly emerged over head and ears in bilge water. Those
destined for this operation are kept close prisoners, so that they
are totally ignorant of what they are to go through, and when the
ordeal is once passed they think no more of it, but shake their
ears and assist in carrying on the joke. The forfeits made them all
as merry as grigs, and the day closed with dancing and songs on the
forecastle, and everybody (the cook excepted) forgot their
temporary mortifications, and joined in the evening's
conviviality."</p>
<p>During this part of the voyage, a most disgraceful promiscuous
intercourse took place between the marines and seamen and the women
convicts when the hatches were off at night time, and it was only
checked by the liberal use of the 'cat-o'-nine-tails,' several of
the delinquent sailors being treated to as many as three hundred
lashes apiece. When in this locality, also, it became necessary to
restrict the service of water, the adverse winds preventing
progress. Three pints of water per day, exclusive of one quart for
boiling peas and oatmeal, was the quantity measured out to each
person&mdash;not a large allowance under even favourable
circumstances, and far from sufficient under such heat and a diet
of salt provisions. Fresh provisions had been liberally served
during a stay of the fleet at Teneriffe, and but for this break in
the scurvy-promoting feeding there would undoubtedly have been much
sickness and many deaths. All things considered, the sickness and
mortality tables shewed a not unsatisfactory record. Just before
the fleet left the Mother Bank, a sporadic disease, like the mumps,
broke out among the marines and exiles, but by frequent explosions
of gunpowder, lighting fires between decks, a liberal use of oil of
tar, and keeping the bedding and clothing dry, the outbreak was
combatted; and when at Teneriffe the surgeon's sick list shewed
only nine marines and 72 exiles under medical treatment, while only
21 of the convicts and three of their children had died. The voyage
from Teneriffe to Rio de Janiero lasted eight weeks, and at the
latter place Dr. White reported 95 persons of all descriptions on
the sick-list, 30 having symptoms of scurvy and four being down
with fever. But this was not at all remarkable, for the ships were
found to be in a most unwholesome state. At one time the sick-list
was very heavy, and the lives of the exiles were endangered by the
carelessness of the masters of some of the transports to daily pump
the bilge water out of their vessels.</p>
<p>Numbers of them became very ill, the water having risen so much
and become so offensive that the panels in the cabins, and even the
buttons on the uniform of the officers, were blackened by the
disease&mdash;breeding exhalations. When Dr. White inspected the
ships on 18th July he reported that the stench from the holds, when
the hatches were removed, was almost unbearable. The fleet was
detained a month at Rio Janiero by calms, and during this time
oranges and other tropical fruits were liberally distributed
amongst the convicts. Two fatal accidents happened between
Teneriffe and the Brazils&mdash;a seaman on one of the transports
fell overboard, and a female convict was crushed to death by a boat
falling on top of her from off the booms.</p>
<p>Several events of interest transpired during the stay of the
fleet in this harbour. An exchange of visits took place between the
Viceroy and Governor Phillip, the former shewing marked civility to
the English captain and his officers, and extending great
hospitality to them. Divine service was held twice on each Sunday
on two of the transports by Rev. R. Johnson, the chaplain who
accompanied the voyagers to Botany Bay, and who was the only
clergyman in the settlement for several years. An observatory was
erected by Lieutenant Dawes on the Island of Enchadus; and Captain
Phillip sent despatches home by a whaler which was returning to
England and had put into Rio for repairs, many of those on the
fleet also seizing the opportunity to send letters 'home' to their
friends and relatives. But the most interesting event that
transpired was the shipment of plants and seeds from the port for
the new settlement, the following being taken on
board:&mdash;Coffee, plant and seed; cocoa seed, in the nut; cotton
seeds, jalap, three sorts of ipecacuhana, tamarind, banana plants,
oranges of various kinds, both seeds and plants; lime and lemon
seeds and plants, guava seeds, prickly pears, with the cochineal
seeds upon it; grape vines, tobacco plants, rice for seed, and
pommerose or eugonia, a plant bearing an apple-like fruit and
having the flavour and odour of a rose. Besides fresh provisions
there were purchased 100 casks of cassada or caffava jatropha, the
root of a shrub which, after being deprived of its noxious
qualities, forms palateable and nutritious food like bread. There
was not much wine to be got at that season, but 100 pipes of a
spirit called aquadente, drawn by the Portuguese from their sugar
canes, was purchased at a low figure for the garrison. This liquor
was the earlier 'colonial rum,' which played so conspicuous a part
in the commerce of the new colony, as detailed in 'The Story of the
Ten Governors.' The deficiency in the military stores was also made
good from the Portuguese arsenal.</p>
<p>Resuming their voyage the exiles and their custodians made for
Table Bay, at the Southern extremity of Africa, which was to be the
final place of refreshment. The fleet was saluted by 21 guns from
Fort Santa Cruz, and the Sirius returned the compliment. A return
was here made to a more liberal allowance of water, the order being
passed from the Sirius to the other vessels that everyone should
have an allowance of three quarts per day.</p>
<p>The first birth on the voyage took place when the fleet was near
Rio Sugar Loaf, a female convict named Mary Broard giving birth to
a fine girl. This was on the 8th September. Nine days afterwards
(the weather having been very wet and unpleasant during the
interim) a shark six feet long was caught, and served to break the
monotony in the mess on board the transports. On October 4th 30 of
the convicts were reported as afflicted with scurvy, and on the
sixth four seamen were punished for having conspired to release
some of the exiles when the fleet reached the Cape. On the night of
the 13th the fleet came to anchor in Table Bay, and Captain Phillip
and the Commissary at once went ashore, and made a formal request
of the Governor of the settlement to purchase provisions,
especially flour and corn, of which the fleet stood greatly in
need. The Governor replied that he feared the request could not be
complied with, as the Colony had recently suffered from a severe
drought, resulting in distress bordering upon famine, and that
consequently such provisions were scarce; he promised, however, to
refer the matter to the Cape Council, and this he did, but it was
only through persistently urging the extremity of the voyagers that
Captain Phillip could induce the Councillors to grant permission to
contractors to furnish the much-needed supplies. A contract was
then entered into with Messrs. De Witt and Caston to supply the
fleet with the live stock, corn, and other necessities, and after a
little delay the provisions were embarked. During the stay of the
fleet in port one and a half pounds of soft bread and a similar
quantity of beef or mutton were served to the voyagers for their
daily ration, wine being served also in lieu of spirits.</p>
<p>The live stock here secured formed the foundation of that
pastoral industry which to-day forms the pride and profit of the
Australasian colonies. Captain Phillip had received orders from the
Admiralty to select as much stock at the Cape as could conveniently
be stored on the ships, and he carried out his instructions as far
as permitted by the scarcity caused by the preceding drought and
the holding capacity of the vessels under his command. During the
month of the fleets' stay in port he transfered from the land to
the ships 500 birds and animals, stalls having been erected for
their accommodation. The stock embarked on the public account
comprised:&mdash;three mares, each having a three-months' old colt
at foot, one stallion, six cows with a calf, two bulls, 44 sheep,
four goats, 32 hogs, and a very large quantity of poultry of
various breeds. Most of these were placed on board the Sirius, and
the remainder on board the storeships; but in addition to the
public stock, the officers on board the transports speculated on
their own account, and purchased live poultry and other stock for
food on the voyage and for farming purposes when they reached the
end of their journey. Cape fruits, seeds and plants were also
received on board the fleet, and thus there were introduced to New
South Wales with the convicts the quince, apple, pear, mulberry,
bamboo, fig, oak, and myrtle trees, besides vines of various kinds,
Spanish reeds, sugar cane, and strawberry plants. From the
Commander of the Dutch troops and the King's botanist, the
intending settlers received full instructions concerning the
propagation and culture of these useful articles.</p>
<p>On November 13th the fleet weighed anchor and made sail direct
for Botany Bay. Two hours after starting on the last lap of the
voyage the fleet fell in with a large Dutch ship, with troops on
board for the Cape, and the same evening a whaler, four months out
from London, was spoken, and by her Captain Phillip forwarded
dispatches to England. Shortly after clearing the Cape the fleet
encountered severe gales, and the live stock suffered greatly from
the heavy sea, seven of the sheep being killed.</p>
<p>With the intent of running ahead of the rest of the fleet and
selecting and preparing a good position for the foundation of the
new colony, Captain Phillip shifted his pennant from the Sirius to
the Supply. On the 25th of November he changed his quarters, being
accompanied by Lieutenant King and Dawes, and several carpenters,
blacksmiths, sawyers, and other mechanics also embarked on board
the Supply, the object being to erect some storehouses at Botany
Bay for the temporary convenience of the new settlers. At the time
of separation the fleet had still 5,582 miles of ocean to cross
before reaching Australia. On January 3rd, 1788, after a stormy
run, the advance ship sighted Van Diemen's Land, and at 2 p.m. on
the 18th the Supply anchored in Botany Bay, close to the spot where
anchored Captain Cook's ship, the Endeavour, eighteen years before.
Three other ships of the fleet sailed into the Bay at about the
same hour next day, and the remainder followed the day after.</p>
<p>Thus ended the voyage of the first fleet, concerning which
Captain Collins says, that before it was entered upon "the mind
hardly dared venture to contemplate, and on which it was impossible
to reflect without some apprehension as to its termination." That
the whole of the fleet should cross so large an expanse of
comparatively unknown water without accident is in itself a
marvellous thing, the time occupied in the voyage being a little
over eight months; but more marvellous still is the fact that so
few of the voyagers died during the journey, and that the number on
the sick list was so small, for we are told that many of the
convicts were in bad health when they embarked, and long and close
confinement, bad diet, scant clothing, and the absence of absolute
necessaries on a voyage of that kind, were not calculated to
promote health either in the individual or the mass. Speaking of
the remarkable success of the voyage, Captain Tench says:&mdash;"To
what cause are we to attribute this unhoped-for success? I wish I
could answer to the liberal manner in which the Government supplied
the expedition. But when the reader is told that some of the
necessary articles allowed to ships on a common passage to the West
Indies were withheld from us&mdash;that portable soup, wheat and
pickled vegetables, were not allowed, and that an inadequate
quantity of essence of salt was the only anti-scorbutic supplied,
his surprise will redouble at the result of the voyage."</p>
<p>Proceedings were at once commenced for landing the stores and
the people, and men were set to work to clear a piece of land on
the south side of the bay, within a mile of the entrance, and near
the spot where Captain Cook had first landed. But Captain Phillip
did not like the place, which was very different from the beauteous
spot described by Cook, and no time was lost in making an
examination of the surrounding country in search of a more suitable
site for settlement. The first place to which attention was
directed was the harbour which Cook had described as existing a few
miles northwards of Botany Bay, and which he had called Port
Jackson, it is thought after the seaman who had first sighted it
from the masthead of the good ship Endeavour. Four days after
entering the Bay Captain Phillip proceeded to examine this harbour,
and he was so taken with its appearance that he at once decided to
remove the settlement. The official history which he published
contains the following sentences bearing upon the discovery and the
decision attendant thereupon:&mdash;"Here all regret arising from
the former disappointments was at once obliterated; and Governor
Phillip had the satisfaction to find one of the finest harbours in
the world, in which a thousand sail of the line might ride in
perfect security. The different coves of this harbour were examined
with all possible expedition, and the preference was given to one
which had the finest spring of water, and in which ships can anchor
so close to the shore that at a very small expense quays may be
constructed where the largest vessels may unload. This cove is
about half a mile in length and a quarter of a mile across at the
entrance. In honour of Lord Sydney, the Governor distinguished it
by the name of 'Sydney Cove.'. .. On the 24th of January Governor
Phillip having sufficiently explored Port Jackson, and found it in
all respects highly calculated to receive such a settlement as he
was appointed to establish, returned to Botany Bay. On his arrival
there, the reports made to him, both of the ground which the people
were clearing, and of the upper parts of the Bay, which in this
interval had been more particularly examined, were in the greatest
degree unfavorable. It was impossible after this to hesitate
concerning the choice of a situation, and orders were accordingly
issued for the removal of the whole fleet to Port Jackson. That
Botany Bay should have appeared to Captain Cook in a more
advantageous light than to Governor Phillip, is not by any means
extraordinary.. .. .. The appearance of the place is picturesque
and pleasing, and the ample harvest it afforded of botanical
acquisitions made it interesting to the philosophical gentleman
engaged in that expedition; but something more than beauty of
appearance, and more necessary than philosophical riches, must be
sought in a place where the permanent residence of multitudes is to
be established."</p>
<p>The magnificent city of Sydney, with its coast surroundings, its
splendid harbour, and its strong defences&mdash;forming as it does
the heart of the populous colony's commercial, political, and
social life&mdash;stands as a monument of the far-sightedness of
the man who was chosen to lay the foundation of that Greater
Britain which now flourishes in this Southern world. The early
occupancy of Port Jackson was one of the best actions of Governor
Phillip and even at this distant day the colonists can profitably
contemplate the advantages that have resulted from his choice of
situations.</p>
<p>I cannot do better than give the account of events close
following those already narrated, as found in one of the earlier
editions of the history of Governor Phillip's voyage to Botany Bay,
published in 1790:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Preparations for a general removal were now made with all
convenient expedition.. .. On the 25th January, therefore, seven
days after the arrival of the Supply, Governor Phillip quitted
Botany Bay in the same ship, and sailed to Port Jackson. The rest
of the fleet, under convoy of the Sirius, was ordered to follow as
soon as the abatement of the wind, which then blew a strong gale,
should facilitate its working out of the Bay.... On the 26th
January, 1788, the transports and storeships attended by the Sirius
finally evacuated Botany Bay; and in a very short time they were
all assembled in Sydney Cove, the place now destined for their
port, and for the reception of the new settlement.</p>
<p>"The debarkation was now made at Sydney Cove, and the work of
clearing the ground for the encampment, as well as for the
storehouses and other buildings, was begun without loss of time.
But the labour which attended this necessary operation was greater
than can easily be imagined by those who were not spectators of it.
The coast, as well as the neighbouring country in general, is
covered with wood; and though in this spot the trees stood more
apart, and were less encumbered with underwood than in many other
places, yet their magnitude was such as to render not only the
felling, but the removal of them afterwards, a task of no small
difficulty. By the habitual indolence of the convicts, and the want
of proper overseers to keep them to their duty, their labour was
rendered less efficient than it might have been. In the evening of
the 26th the colours were displayed onshore, and the Governor; with
several of his principal officers and others, assembled round the
flag-staff, drank the King's health, and success to the settlement,
with all that display of form which on such occasions is esteemed
propitious, because it enlivens the spirits, and fills the
imagination with pleasing presages.</p>
<p>"From this time to the end of the first week in February all was
hurry and exertion. They who gave orders and they who received them
were equally occupied; nor is it easy to conceive a busier scene
than this part of the coast exhibited during the continuance of
these first efforts towards establishment. The plan of the
encampment was quickly formed, and places were marked out for every
different purpose, so as to introduce as much as possible, strict
order and regularity. The materials and framework to construct a
slight temporary habitation for the Governor had been brought out
from England ready formed; these were landed and put together with
as much expedition as circumstances would allow. Hospital tents
were also without delay erected, for which there was soon but too
much occasion. In the passage from the Cape there had been but
little sickness, nor had many died even among the convicts; but
soon after landing, dysentery prevailed, which in several instances
proved fatal, and the scurvy began to rage with a virulence which
kept the hospital generally supplied with patients. For those
afflicted with this disorder the advantage of fish or other fresh
provisions could but rarely be procured, nor were esculent
vegetables obtained in sufficient plenty to produce any material
alleviation of the complaint. In the dysentery, the red gum of the
tree which principally abounds on this coast was found a very
powerful remedy. The yellow gum has been discovered to possess the
same property, but in an inferior degree.</p>
<p>"The month of February was ushered in by a very violent storm of
thunder and rain. The lightning struck and shivered a tree, under
which a shed had been erected for some sheep, and five of those
animals were at the same time unfortunately destroyed by it. The
encampment still went on with great alacrity, so that in the
beginning of this month the work of building public storehouses was
undertaken; and unremitting diligence began, though very gradually,
to triumph over the obstacles which the nature of the place
presented.</p>
<p>"The 7th February, 1788, was the memorable day which established
a regular form of Government on the coast of New South Wales. For
obvious reasons, all possible solemnity was given to the
proceedings necessary on this occasion. On a space previously
cleared the whole colony was assembled; the military drawn up, and
under arms; the convicts stationed apart; and near the person of
the Governor those who were to hold the principal offices under
him. The Royal Commission was then read.. .. The Act of Parliament
establishing the courts of judicature was next read; and lastly,
the patents under the great seal, empowering the proper persons to
convene and hold those courts whenever the exigency should require.
A triple discharge of musketry concluded this part of the ceremony;
after which Governor Phillip advanced, and addressing first the
private soldiers thanked them for their steady good conduct on
every occasion&mdash;an honour which was repeated to them in the
next general orders. He then turned to the convicts and distinctly
explained to them the nature of their present situation. The
greater part, he bade them recollect, had already forfeited their
lives to the justice of their country; yet, by the levity of its
laws, they were now so placed that, by industry and good behaviour,
they might regain the advantages and estimation in society of which
they had deprived themselves. They not only had every encouragement
to make that effort, but were removed almost entirely from every
temptation to guilt. There was but little in this infant community
which one man could plunder from another, and any dishonest
attempts in so small a society would almost infallibly be
discovered. To persons detected in such crimes he could not promise
any mercy; nor, indeed, to any who, under their circumstances,
should presume to offend against the peace and good order of the
settlement. What mercy could do for them they had already
experienced; nor could any good be now expected from those whom
neither past warnings, nor the peculiarities of their present
situation could preserve from guilt. Against offenders, therefore,
the rigour of the law would certainly be put in force; while they
whose behaviour should in any degree promise reformation, might
always depend upon encouragement fully proportioned to their
deserts. He particularly noticed the illegal intercourse between
the sexes as an offence which encouraged a general profligacy of
manners, and was in several ways injurious to society. To prevent
this he strongly recommended marriage, and promised every kind of
countenance and assistance to those who, by entering into that
state, should manifest their willingness to conform to the laws of
morality and religion. Governor Phillip concluded his address by
declaring his earnest desire to promote the happiness of all who
were under his government, and to render the settlement in New
South Wales advantageous and honourable to his country."</p>
<p>As far as the convicts were concerned, the writer assures us
that this first gubernatorial speech on Australian soil was not
altogether without its proper effect, as within the course of a
week from its deliverance no less than fourteen marriages took
place among the convicts.</p>

<p>This list is given, not for the purpose of gratifying any morbid
curiosity, but simply to preserve the names of those who were the
real pioneers of the colony. To many of these men, with others who
were not marked with the felon's brand, belonged the credit of
making the initial movements in that work of colonization which has
spread so widely and with such marvellous rapidity through this
vast continent. They toiled and suffered to an extent which the
mind fails to compass, and from their toil and suffering there
sprang the first shoots of that industrial and commercial life
which to-day is throbbing with a vigour not exceeded by any nation
upon the face of the earth. It was under prophetic inspiration that
Darwin, the author of "The Botanic Garden," penned the following
lines, some ten years after Governor Phillip first landed on
Australian soil:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where Sydney cove her lucid bosom swells,<br>
Courts her young navies, and the storm repels;<br>
High on a rock amid the troubled air<br>
Hope stood sublime, and wav'd her golden hair;<br>
Calm'd with her rosy smile the tossing deep,<br>
And with sweet accents charmed the winds to sleep;<br>
To each wild plain she stretched her snowy hand,<br>
High-waving wood and sea encircled strand.<br>
"Hear me," she cried, "ye rising Realms! record<br>
Times opening scenes, and Truth's unerring word.&mdash;<br>
<i>There</i> shall broad streets, their stately walls extend.<br>
The circus widen, and the crescent bend;<br>
<i>There,</i> ray'd from cities o'er the cultured land,<br>
Shall bright canals, and solid roads expand.&mdash;<br>
<i>There</i> the proud arch, Colossus-like, bestride<br>
Yon glittering streams, and bound the chasing tide;<br>
Embellished villas crown the landscape-scene,<br>
Farms wave with gold, and orchards blush between.&mdash;<br>
<i>There</i> shall tall spires, and dome-cap towers ascend.<br>
And piers and quays their massy structures blend;<br>
While with each breeze approaching vessels glide,<br>
And northern treasures dance on every tide!"<br>
Then ceas'd the Nymph&mdash;tumultuous echoes roar,<br>
And Joys loud voice was heard from shore to shore&mdash;<br>
Her graceful steps descending press'd the plain.<br>
And PEACE, and ART, and LABOUR, joined her train!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this distance of time every city, town and stocked or
cultivated country-side sends back the echo; and from the light of
the past we now may see more clearly what may be the future of this
Sunny Land.</p>
<p>This part of the subject&mdash;and perhaps the brightest, for it
is with the darkest side of the colony's life that we are now
dealing&mdash;cannot be brought to a more fitting conclusion than
by the repetition of the story told by Bennett of the last survivor
of the "First Fleet:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Of more than a thousand persons who arrived by the 'First
Fleet,' and who were present at the formal inauguration of the
Government, on the 7th February, 1788, the writer has reason to
believe that at present (May, 1865) not more than one survives, if,
indeed, the person to whom he refers is still living. Nearly two
years ago, that is, in May, 1863, a very old man named Michael
Norton, was produced as a witness in the Supreme Court, Sydney, in
an ejectment case (Campbell v. Binks). Having then deposed to a
circumstance which took place a great many years ago, Sir Alfred
Stephen, who was on the Bench, inquired how old he was. In reply,
the old man said he believed his age was one hundred and three
years. Some other questions were then put by his Honor to which old
Norton gave very satisfactory answers. The writer, on the following
day, had a long conversation with the old man, and found him
remarkably intelligent and communicative. He was, he said, born on
board a government store-ship called the Tiger, while that vessel
was lying in the harbour of St. Helena. His father was a soldier in
a cavalry regiment then on its way to India. He remained with his
parents in India for several years, and ultimately returned with
them to England. Some time afterwards, with his mother's consent,
his father being in another part of England with his regiment, he
was drafted to join a company of marines, who were to go out as
guard with Captain Arthur Phillip to Botany Bay. He was never
formally enrolled, being but a boy at the time, and on the voyage
out never stood sentry, for although regularly drilled with the
marines, he was generally employed as cook's assistant. On his
arrival here he went to live as servant with Major Johnston, and
continued with him until 1791, when he went with some sawyers to
the River Hawkesbury. There he remained for more than seventy
years, being generally employed as a sawyer, and never until
January, 1863 left the district of Colo, where he had taken up his
residence. He then determined to visit Sydney, principally for the
purpose of gratifying his curiosity by the sight of a railway train
and steam vessels. He had often read and heard of these wonderful
inventions, but having never seen them, it occurred to him that if
he wished to do so, he had not much time to lose. He had never in
his life, he said, been in a court of law, even as a witness,
before he was called upon on the previous day to give evidence in
the above-mentioned case, and had never before taken an oath. He
had never been married, nor had he any relatives in the colony. He
had, when he left England, two brothers, and both soldiers, the
last time he heard from them was just after the capture of Candy,
in Ceylon, at which they were present. Never having left the
secluded district of the Colo, for more than seventy years, he was,
he said, known to very few persons. His occupation as a sawyer,
usually carried on in remote parts of the bush, seldom brought him
into contact with strangers; and accounted for the fact of a person
of his great age, and who had come to the colony by the first
fleet, not being more generally known. He stated, in corroboration
of the fact of his longevity, that the oldest residents on the
Hawkesbury, men who could remember him for sixty years or more,
always called him 'Old Mick,' even when they were children, so that
he must have been an elderly man more than half a century ago. He
was still strong and hearty, and sometimes engaged in farming work,
but was generally employed at his own trade as a sawyer. He was
extremely active, with sight and hearing almost unimpaired, and had
the appearance of a man about seventy years of age. He was very
sharp and intelligent in conversation, often making use of words
and phrases, which he could only have acquired by reading, and
expressed himself readily, and for one of his station, very
correctly. Occasionally there was evident a momentary loss of
recollection or lapse of consciousness of the subject on which he
was speaking; and he was often unable to follow out the most simple
train of reasoning, but his lapse of recollection was only for an
instant and then his eye flashed and kindled as if he felt
gratified at the quick return of his faculties. Contrary to what is
said to be usually the case with very old people, his memory
appeared exceedingly good and retentive for details of matters of
very recent occurrence, and not for things which happened many
years ago. Of the most important occurrences of his early life he
recollected but a few leading events. On this account it was
difficult to ascertain how far his impressions as to certain facts,
or what he evidently believed to be facts, were reliable, and his
belief as to his great age seemed founded on no very distinct
data&mdash;at least, when cross-questioned, he appeared unable to
reconcile discrepancies, or even to see that they were
discrepancies. For instance, he said he thought he was 103 years
old, but when it was pointed out to him that if he was a boy or a
youth when he arrived in 1788, he could then be little more than
90, he was unable to see the inconsistency of his statements. His
faculty for numbers appeared to be almost wholly obliterated. There
is no doubt that he was a very old man, and considering his
strength and activity, and the wonderful preservation of his
physical faculties, the singularity of the case is not much
lessened, even on the supposition that he was but 93 instead of 103
years old. From an consideration of all the above circumstances,
and of many other matters which incidentally arose in the course of
a lengthy conversation, it is probable that the real age of Michael
Norton was somewhere between 90 and 95 years. That he firmly
believed his age to be 103 years, there is no doubt, but his belief
did not appear to rest on any sufficient data; on the contrary, the
facts which he mentioned in support of it all pointed to 93 instead
of 103 as his real age."</p>

<p>WE have seen how the convicts were transported across the seas,
how they were landed on Australian soil, and what advice was given
to them by the man whose every word they were supposed to obey, and
who literally held their lives in his hands. Little was it then
imagined that this band of transported felons and their gaolers
would lay the foundations of a State, which before a century had
passed would hold a prominent place amongst the civilized nations
of the world; but we who live to-day see what marvellous results
have followed the occupancy of the land by the untimely company of
Britons whose characters and work the writer has undertaken to
describe.</p>
<p>After the formal establishment of the Government, as already
narrated, active steps were taken in the direction of erecting
store-houses, and other buildings required for habitation and for
preserving the provisions, seed, animals, &amp;c., that had been
brought in the store-ships. The heavy rain which fell during the
first two or three weeks prevented much work from being done; and
as there were only a few skilled mechanics among the convicts, when
the weather did clear the progress made was but slow. The officers
and soldiers had to rest content with temporary dwellings, built of
cabbage-tree, which grew in abundance in several parts of the
harbour; while the convicts had to put up with even less
pretentious buildings, made of a few branches and twigs plastered
up with clay. The military huts were placed on the west side of
what was afterwards called the Tank Stream. The Governor's house
was erected a few yards from the spot where Pitt and Hunter streets
now intersect each other. The store-house was erected on what is
now called the Queen's Wharf, and although a site for a large town
was laid out, with streets 200 feet wide, the design was spoiled by
the encroachments found necessary by the pressing need of huts for
the residence of the colonists, and as these in time were replaced
by more substantial buildings, the original plan could not be
carried out. This temporary provision for shelter having been made,
the main body of the convicts were employed in clearing the trees
and scrub near the settlement, and in making attempts to cultivate
the ground so cleared; but as the soil was found unsuitable for
agriculture most of the men were set to work clearing land for
cultivation about fifteen miles distant, the new farm being called
at first the Crescent, and afterwards Rose Hill, later still
reverting to the native name Parramatta, which name is still
retained. For a long time the labour of the convicts was
concentrated at the Camp, as the settlement at Sydney Cove was
called, and at the farm at Parramatta, the work of cultivation
being relieved by fishing and shooting, parties of men being
specially told off for the latter work.</p>
<p>Captain Tench gives a very good description of the first
movements of the new arrivals after their landing, and the
narrative is well-worth perusal. Here is the story as told by
him:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The landing of a part of the marines and convicts took place
the next day, and on the following, the remainder was disembarked.
Business now sat on every brow; and the scene to an indifferent
spectator, at leisure to contemplate it, would have been highly
picturesque and amusing. In one place a party cutting down the
woods; a second, setting up a blacksmith's forge; a third, dragging
along a load of stones or provisions; here an officer pitching his
marquee, with a detachment of troops parading on one side of him,
and a cook's fire blazing up on the other. Through the unwearied
diligence of those at the head of the different departments,
regularity was, however, soon introduced, and, as far as the
unsettled state of matters would allow, confusion gave place to
system.</p>
<p>"Into the head of the cove on which our establishment is fixed,
runs a small stream of fresh water, which serves to divide the
adjacent country to a little distance, in the direction of north
and south. On the eastern side of this rivulet the governor fixed
his place of residence, with a large body of convicts encamped near
him; and on the western side was disposed the remaining part of
these people, near the marine encampment. From this last two
guards, consisting of two subalterns, as many sergeants, four
corporals, two drummers, and forty-two private men, under the
orders of a captain of the day, to whom all reports were made,
daily mounted for the public security, with such directions to use
force in case of necessity, as left no room for those who were the
object of the order, but to remain peaceable, or perish by the
bayonet.</p>
<p>"As the straggling of the convicts was not only a desertion from
the public labour, but might be attended with ill consequences to
the settlement, in case of their meeting the natives, every care
was taken to prevent it. The provost martial, with his men, was
ordered to patrole the country around, and the convicts informed,
that the severest punishment would be inflicted on transgressors.
In spite, however, of all our precautions, they soon found the road
to Botany Bay, in visits to the French, who would gladly have
dispensed with their company.</p>
<p>"While the convicts were on board ship, the two sexes had been
kept most rigorously apart; but when landed, their separation
became impracticable, and would have been, perhaps, wrong.
Licentiousness was the unavoidable consequence, and their old
habits of depravity were beginning to recur. What was to be
attempted? To prevent their intercourse was impossible; and to
palliate its evils only remained. Marriage was recommended, and
such advantages held out to those who aimed at reformation, as have
greatly contributed to the tranquility of the settlement.</p>
<p>"On the Sunday after our landing, divine service was performed
under a great tree, by the Rev. Mr. Johnston, chaplain of the
settlement, in the presence of the troops and convicts, whose
behaviour on the occasion was equally regular and attentive. In the
course of our passage this had been repeated every Sunday, while
the ships were in port; and in addition to it, Mr. Johnson had
furnished them with books, at once tending to promote instruction
and piety.</p>
<p>"February, 1788.</p>
<p>"Owing to the multiplicity of pressing business necessary to be
performed immediately after landing, it was found impossible to
read the public commissions, and take possession of the colony in
form, until 7th of February. On that day all the officers of guard
took post in the marine battalion, which was drawn up, and marched
off the parade with music playing, and colours flying, to an
adjoining ground, which had been cleared for the occasion, whereon
the convicts were assembled to hear his Majesty's commission read,
appointing his Excellency Arthur Phillip, Esq., Governor and
Captain General in and over the territory of New South Wales, and
its dependencies; together with the act of parliament for the
establishing trials by law within the same; and the patents under
the Great Seal of Great Britain, for holding the civil and criminal
courts of judicature, by which all cases of life and death, as well
as matters of property, were to be decided. When the judge advocate
had finished reading, his Excellency addressed himself to the
convicts in a pointed and judicious speech, informing them of his
future intentions, which were, invariably to cherish and render
happy those who showed a disposition to amendment; and to let the
rigour of the law take its course against such as might dare to
transgress the bounds prescribed. At the close, three volleys were
fired in honour of the occasion, and the battalion marched back to
their parade.</p>
<p>"In the governor's commission, the extent of this authority is
defined to reach from the latitude of 43 deg. 49 min. south, to the
latitude of 10 deg. 37 min. south, being the northern and southern
extremities of the continent of New Holland. It commences again at
135th degree of longitude east of Greenwich, and proceeding in an
easterly direction, includes all islands within the limits of the
above specified latitudes in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>"As the constitution of this court is altogether new in the
British annals, I hope my readers will not think me prolix in the
description I am about to give of it. The number of members,
including the judge advocate, is limited, by act of parliament, to
seven, who are expressly ordered to be officers, either of his
Majesty's sea or land forces. The court being met, completely
arrayed and armed as at a military tribunal, the judge advocate
proceeds to administer the usual oath taken by jurymen in England
to each member; one of whom afterwards swears him in a like manner.
The ceremony being adjusted, the crime laid to the prisoner's
charge is read to him, and the question of Guilty, or Not Guilty,
put. No law officer on the side of the crown being appointed (for I
presume the head of the court ought hardly to consider himself in
that light, notwithstanding the title he bears) to prosecute, the
criminal is left entirely to the party at whose suit he is tried.
All the witnesses are examined on oath, and the decision is
directed to be given according to the laws of England, 'or as
nearly as may be, allowing for the circumstances and situation of
the settlement,' by a majority of votes, beginning with the
youngest member and ending with the president of the court. In
cases, however, of a capital nature, no verdict can be given,
unless five, at least, of the seven members present concur therein.
The evidence on both sides being finished, and the prisoner's
defence heard, the court is cleared, and on the judgment being
settled, is thrown open again, and sentence pronounced. During the
time the court sits, the place in which it is assembled is directed
to be surrounded by a guard under arms, and admission to every one
who may chose to enter it, granted.</p>
<p>"Hitherto, however, (February) nothing of a very atrocious
nature had appeared. But the day was at hand, on which violation of
public security could no longer be restrained, by the infliction of
temporary punishment. A set of desperate and hardened villains,
leagued themselves for the purposes of depredation, and, as it
generally happens, had art enough to persuade some others less
deeply versed in iniquity, to be the instruments of carrying it on.
Fortunately the progress of these miscreants was not of long
duration. They were detected in stealing a large quantity of
provisions at the time of issuing them; and, on being apprehended,
one of the tools of the superiors impeached the rest, and disclosed
the scheme. The trial came on the 28th of the month, and of four
who were arraigned for the offence, three were condemned to die,
and the fourth to receive a very severe corporal punishment. In
hopes that his lenity would not be abused, his Excellency was,
however, pleased to order one only for execution, which took place
a little before sun-set, the same day. The name of the unhappy
wretch was Thomas Barrett, an old and desperate offender, who died
with that hardy spirit, which too often is found in the worst and
most abandoned class of men. During the execution the battalion of
marines was under arms, and the whole of the convicts obliged to be
present. The two associates of the sufferer were ordered to be kept
close prisoners, until an eligible place to banish them to could be
fixed on; as were also two more, who on the following day were
condemned to die for a similar offence."</p>
<p>The hardships resulting from the failure of provisions shortly
after the landing have already been dwelt upon in the "Story of the
Ten Governors," and need not be repeated here. The knowledge that
the provisions were running short and that there was but a poor
prospect of obtaining a further supply immediately, appears to have
exercised a very demoralizing effect upon the minds of the
convicts, and their disaffection speedily made itself manifest by
acts of insubordination and breaches of order. Some of them broke
into and plundered the temporary store&mdash;a work of not much
difficulty&mdash;and betrayed a restlessness and recklessness that
called forth prompt and effective repressive measures. The first
batch of plunderers caught were dealt with off hand. A court was
assembled; the men, six in number, were tried, and convicted, and
sentenced to death, and their ringleader, a youth named Barrett,
only seventeen years of age, who, however, is described by Tench as
"an old and desperate offender," was executed on the spot. The
others were reprieved and sent to the little island in the middle
of the harbour afterwards called Pinchgut, but now Fort Denison,
and there kept on small allowance of bread and water. Here they
were kept for a little over three months, when they were liberated
in honour of the King's birthday.</p>
<p>"He who suffered," says Stockdale, "and two others, had been
detected in stealing from the stores on the very day that they had
received a week's provisions; at a time when their allowance, as
settled by the Navy Board, was the same as that of the soldiers,
spirituous liquors excepted. So inveterate were their habits of
dishonesty, that even the apparent want of a motive could not
repress them." Allowance must be made for this laboured wording,
for the sentences were written in 1798. In later years a story was
current that the five men died from starvation on the island, but
it had no foundation in fact, and in all probability was circulated
by one of the Governor's enemies, from a desire to make it appear
that he was strict even to cruelty so gross. The hanging of the
youth does, certainly, carry the appearance of undue severity; but,
judging from his conduct throughout the periods of distress that
prevailed, when he placed his own household upon the same short
allowance as the convicts, Governor Phillips was not a hard-hearted
man, and he must have considered that the necessities of the case
demanded the sternest repressive measures. It is probable, however,
that the sentence in this boy's case would not have been carried
out, had he not persisted in the notion that the Governor could not
have him hanged without first obtaining the sanction of the
King&mdash;a notion which appeared to prevail generally among the
convicts. From this time out, however, they did not question the
Governor's power or contend that he did not exercise it legally. On
this subject one writer says:&mdash;"This prompt but necessary
severity on the part of the Governor, a man, under ordinary
circumstances, of the most humane and gentle disposition, produced
a powerful effect for a time on the conduct of the other prisoners,
and probably saved the whole settlement from starvation. The means
of securing the provisions and stores were very inadequate at
first, and the temptation for those who were disposed to help
themselves so great, that nothing less than death could deter them
from plundering the public property." Bad as this case appears to
be, the light of its horror is not nearly so lurid as that which
attended hundreds of cases later on, where official severity
developed into fiendish cruelty. But this was not in Phillip's
time.</p>
<p>Five months after the formation of the settlement a return was
made out of the number of persons who had died since their
embarkation in England, and it was found that there had been
eighty-nine deaths&mdash;eight of free persons and eighty-one of
convicts. Out of this number several had died on board ship, while
in harbour, before the fleet left England. When this return was
made the health of the people at the settlement was good. The
season of the distress through short rations had not yet set in,
but although the prisoners were on the same footing as the soldiers
and sailors as regards provisions, the general health of the former
was not so good as that of the free persons. Many of them sunk into
a state of apathy and only longed for the time to come when they
could make their way back to England. So great was this "home
sickness," especially among those whose terms of service were near
completion, that we are told they almost starved themselves and
hoarded their rations hoping to raise sufficient money by the sale
of the hoarded food to pay their passage back to the "old country."
One convict, a youth, was found dead in his hut, and a <i>post
mortem</i> examination proved that he had died from sheer want of
nourishment. His companions stated that he had scarcely tasted food
for a week, but upon his box being searched a large quantity of
provisions, which he had stored for sale, was found therein.</p>
<p>Owing to the difficulty of procuring trustworthy overseers, the
convicts at first were not as a body kept regularly at work; and
idleness created vice, the greatest trouble being caused through
the frequent thefts of food. Nevertheless, we are told, the conduct
of the prisoners was on the whole fairly good.</p>
<p>Excellent clay had been found at a spot about a mile from the
settlement, and a large gang of men were there set to the work of
making bricks, while other gangs were employed in collecting shells
for making lime. The place where the clay was found is still called
Brickfield Hill, and is in the very heart of Sydney. With the
bricks here made the erection of the first substantial buildings
was commenced, a hospital, a barrack, an observatory, and houses
for the Governor and the Lieutenant-Governor being started by the
beginning of August.</p>
<p>In the same month a sensational incident occurred, which was
calculated to create not a little trouble. Many of the convicts had
got hold of the idea that gold existed in the new land to which
they had come, and for some time after their arrival they employed
themselves in searching. At last one of their number, named Daley,
declared that he had found some of the precious metal, and produced
a "specimen" in proof of the correctness of his assertion. He
refused to tell where he had found it, however, unless the Governor
would guarantee to him a certain sum of money, and set him free,
together with a convict woman to whom he was attached. The Governor
was then absent from the settlement, and Major Ross, the
Lieutenant-Governor, not only refused to comply with Daley's
demand, but commanded him to shew in what part of the country he
had found the gold, on pain of severe punishment. Of course, a
convict could have no right to anything, and Daley found that he
had got himself into trouble, for he could not point out the spot.
Under threats of the lash, however, he at length said he would
point out the place where the precious metal could be discovered,
and an officer and several soldiers were sent with him. But Daley
gave them the slip after leading them some distance into the bush,
and returned to camp, saying that he had left the officer in full
charge of the gold mine, and again disappeared. He was captured
soon afterwards, and as he still persisted that his story was true,
he was severely flogged. When the Governor returned, Daley was sent
with another officer to the place where he alleged he found the
gold, and the officer, determined that Daley should not fool him as
he had fooled his colleague, made him walk in front, and threatened
him with instant death if he should attempt to run away or deceive
him. Daley then confessed that the whole affair was a lie; that he
had filed down part of a yellow metal buckle, mixed it with some
particles of gold filed off a guinea, and blended the whole with
clay, which he had then made very hard. Upon this he was again
flogged with greater severity than before. Shortly after this he
was convicted of some petty offence and was hanged. But many
persons believed that Daley did really find gold, and that rather
than reveal the spot without reward he said that he had
manufactured it, and took the floggings for practising deception.
Whether he did find gold or not, it is confidently asserted that in
the very early times small quantities of the precious metal were
sold in Sydney by convicts and others, and as it is certain that
many of the convicts crossed the Blue Mountains long before any
practicable route over them was discovered by the settlers, the
story is not altogether improbable.</p>
<p>It was about this time that the necessity of shortening the
ration allowed to the convicts and soldiers arose, for it was seen
that the stores would otherwise give out before fresh supplies
could reach the settlement. The decrease in the ration of
provisions created a corresponding increase of crime, and having
committed themselves, many of the prisoners took to the woods to
avoid punishment. One of the absconders who was taken was hanged as
a warning to other evil-doers, and the punishment meted out to both
soldiers and convicts was of the severest kind. As a proof of the
extraordinary severity with which offenders were treated, it may be
mentioned that two men, one a soldier and the other a prisoner,
were sentenced to receive <i>seven hundred lashes each.</i> The
prisoner was not strong enough to bear the full sentence, and in
order that he might not die under the lash, the flogger was ordered
to desist when half the number of strokes only had been given; but
the soldier suffered the full penalty. His offence consisted in
having been found absent from his post.</p>
<p>The latter part of the year and the first four months of 1789 is
stated to have been one of the darkest periods in the history of
the settlement. It was a season of dire forebodings, darkest gloom,
intensest sufferings and frequent deaths. As far as the convicts
were concerned, as natural food failed they were more liberally fed
with the lash, and the result was that they recklessly plunged into
acts of disobedience and crime, or sank into despair. The only
edibles yet grown on the island were a few vegetables; the few
cattle brought out in the ships had mysteriously disappeared, and
many of the sheep and goats had fallen victims to the rapacity of
the native dogs; the supply of provisions in the stores was rapidly
being exhausted, and there was no telling when the ships sent for
additional supplies would return from their long voyage. Under such
circumstances, what wonder is it that the poor suffering wretches
who had been brought to a country so barren and inhospitable should
break bounds in the hope of bettering their condition in the bush;
heedless of the dangers that lurked therein&mdash;the probability
of being lost and starved, or the greater probability of being
killed by the natives, who were already realizing that the white
invaders were depriving them of the food upon which they had
chiefly relied for sustenance&mdash;the sea and shell-fish of the
harbour. Reckless of consequences, and against the positive orders
of the Governor, many of the convicts went from the settlement into
the bush in search of herbs and roots, and as several of them did
not return, for the simple reason that they had been killed by the
aborigines, an attempt was made to check wandering by an order that
everyone detected beyond certain assigned bounds should receive one
hundred and fifty lashes, while those who returned wounded by the
natives were placed in the hospital, and flogged when their wounds
were healed. It was a season full of horrors, and the soldiers were
treated with almost as much rigour as those whom they had in
charge.</p>
<p>About the end of January, 1789, a conspiracy was discovered
among the soldiers to plunder the public store. This conspiracy,
which was regularly organised, had existed for several months, and
those who were party to it had succeeded in abstracting a quantity
of the carefully hoarded provisions before the plot was found out,
so that the stock on hand had been considerably reduced, and the
condition of affairs was much worse than the Governor and officers
had thought. Seven of the soldiers were detected in the act of
plundering the store, and they were all hanged without any
ceremony, despite the efforts of their officers to have them
reprieved. At this distance of time, many persons will doubtless
condemn Governor Phillip for what they may think was an act of
undue severity; but those who take the whole of the circumstances
into consideration must acknowledge that the greatest sternness and
promptitude were demanded, if anything like discipline and order
were to be maintained in a community so hard-driven and desperate.
Bennett well says, when referring to this time:&mdash;"The position
of the settlement under a man of less firmness and self-reliance
would have been desperate in the extreme. Starvation stared the
people in the face, and the slightest relaxation of discipline
would probably have been followed by a state of anarchy and crime
frightful to contemplate and impossible to control." But if
Governor Phillip was firm and self-reliant even to sternness in
dealing with offences, he was kind-hearted and disinterested to a
degree. At the very time that this robbery by the soldiers from the
common store was made, the Governor was living on the same daily
ration as the meanest person in the settlement, the <i>weekly</i>
quantity of food issued indiscriminately to all, and drawn by
himself for his own consumption, being 2&frac12; lbs. flour, 2 lbs. rice
and 2 lbs. pork. Says Collins, who was one of the sufferers, "The
Governor, from a motive that did him immortal honour, in this
season of general distress, gave up three hundredweight of flour
which was his Excellency's private property; declaring, that he
wished not to see any more at his table than the ration which was
received in common from the public store, without any distinction
of person, and to this resolution he rigidly adhered, wishing that,
if a convict complained, he might see that want was not unfelt even
at Government House." Let those who feel disposed to condemn the
Governor weigh well the evidence both for and against him before
pronouncing judgment.</p>
<p>The state of things thus feebly depicted continued until the
middle of May, when the Sirius returned from the Cape with a four
months' supply of provisions for the settlement. Her arrival was
hailed with great joy, and those convicts who had almost given
themselves up to despair and the recklessness attendant upon such a
condition of mind and feeling, at once became orderly, industrious,
and well-behaved. Full rations produced contentment and even
hilarity, and the convicts went so far in this direction as even to
indulge in dramatic entertainments, permission to do so having
first been obtained from his Excellency. The 4th of June was the
King's birthday, and free and bond joined in its celebration,
rendering the occasion remarkable as the data of the first
performance of a play in Australia. The play produced was
Farquhar's comedy of "The Recruiting Officer," and the theatre was
a hut fitted up for the occasion, the actors being all convicts.
Concerning the merits of this early performance no information has
been handed down to us; but Collins says, "they (the players)
professed no higher aim than 'humbly to excite a smile,' and their
efforts to please were not unattended with applause."</p>
<p>The chief work upon which the prisoners had up to this time been
employed was in procuring building materials, erecting houses and
stores, building boats and wharves, and in farming operations, 250
of them being engaged, mostly at Parramatta, in clearing the ground
and cultivating the soil. The discovery of the Hawkesbury River by
the Governor, who spent a large portion of his time in exploring
the country in this direction in search of better land for
cultivation, furnished a wider scope for operations, and parties of
convicts were soon sent further afield to work. The fine deep soil
on the banks of the river was admirably adapted for raising grain,
and shortly after its discovery portions of it were allotted to
settlers.</p>
<p>But another season of distress being feared, in November the
people were again placed on short allowance, for although the first
crop had been garnered at Parramatta, amounting to upwards of 200
bushels of wheat, with small portions of maize, barley and oats, it
was deemed advisable to save the whole for seed for the ensuing
year; and the rats had committed great havoc among the provisions
in the public store at the settlement. The rations now served out
were barely sufficient to preserve life, the <i>weekly
allowance</i> for adults being 2&frac12; lbs. flour, 2 lbs. pork, 1 pint
peas, and 1lb. rice, the Governor and the officers again receiving
equal measure with the convicts. And right in the midst of this
trouble there came intelligence which intensified the gloom. The
Sirius frigate, which had been sent to Norfolk Island, had been
wrecked there, and although two years had elapsed since the
foundation of the colony, no intelligence had been received from
England, and for all the people knew no fresh supplies had yet
started from headquarters. And again want bred discontent and
disorder; again were issued and enforced stringent regulations
against waste; again there followed insubordination, floggings and
executions. The tender Supply was despatched to Batavia, the
commander carrying instructions to charter a vessel there and load
her as well as the Supply with a full cargo of provisions. Two
months of deepest misery intervened, and then one morning early in
June a sail was sighted from the South Head. The vessel proved to
be the Lady Juliana, from London, which had been eleven months on
her passage, having started in July of the previous year. The ship
Guardian had been dispatched from England about the same time, with
a large quantity of live stock and other supplies, but having
struck on a rock she was compelled to put into the Cape of Good
Hope, almost in a sinking state; and the Lady Juliana, a much
smaller vessel, had come on with a part of her cargo and
passengers. The provisions which thus came to hand at such an
opportune time enabled the Governor to increase, but only to a
small extent, the scale of provisions, it being thought that the
stock would last until the return of the Supply from Batavia. Then
other surprises quickly followed. Three ships from London,
transports, put in their appearance, bringing out a large number of
convicts, and detachments of the New South Wales Corps. More mouths
to feed and very little to feed them!&mdash;the outlook was indeed
dark and gruesome.</p>
<p>The character of the New South Wales Corps&mdash;afterwards
embodied in the 102nd Regiment&mdash;has already been dwelt upon in
Part I of this history ("The Story of the Ten Governors"), but the
subject was not then exhausted, and it is necessary that something
more should be said concerning a set of men whose actions proved
them to have been cast in the coarsest mould of genteel
viciousness. Concerning the formation of the Corps: A Major Grose
had made a proposal to the Secretary of State to enlist a force for
service in the penal settlement of Botany Bay, on condition that he
received certain emoluments and honours, and his offer being
accepted he set his recruiting officers to work, and soon succeeded
in raising the requisite number to form the first detachments. Not
from the ranks of tried soldiers did he raise his force, and not
from the ranks of reputable men. They were to do duty in a land of
convicts; who better for such service than convicts themselves? An
Irish political prisoner named Holt, who was transported to the
colony some years later than the period here referred to, and whose
peculiar experiences will be narrated in a subsequent chapter,
describes the officers of this Corps as "old tailors and
shoemakers, stay-makers, man-milliners, tobacconists and pedlars,
that were called captains and lieutenants." Likely men for the
service were sought in the hulks of the prisons of the old land;
soldiers under punishment were taken from the navy hulk; and those
who had been condemned to service in India were reprieved on
enlisting in the New South Wales Corps. Says Governor Hunter, who
found them more troublesome than the convicts, "Characters who have
been disgraced in every other regiment in his Majesty's service
have been thought fit and proper recruits for the New South Wales
Corps. . . . . We find among these, men capable of corrupting the
hearts of the best disposed, and often superior in every species of
infamy to the most expert in wickedness among the convicts!" And
these are only fine lines in the picture. Those who have read what
has already been written of these men, and who read what
follows&mdash;and after all is said the whole truth will not have
been told&mdash;will share in the astonishment of the writer of
this story that every element of goodness in the young colony was
not swallowed up in this sink of corruption called a Corps.</p>
<p>The vessels which brought to the colony the first contingent of
Major Grose's "army" also brought about 2,000 male and 250 female
convicts. The voyage out was full of horrors to the unfortunate
prisoners. The vessels were not regular transports, but private
ships, whose owners had contracted with the Government to embark
prisoners at &pound;17/7/6 per head, without any agreement being made for
sufficient accommodation or proper control; nor were they even
liable for any deduction for those who died on the
voyage&mdash;hence, the greater number of deaths, the more profit
to the contractors. Will the reader be astonished to learn that the
sharks were well fed on human flesh during the passage? Nearly 300
of the wretched creatures on board in chains perished before the
vessels reached Port Jackson, in consequence of the close and
improper way in which they had been confined. Driven to desperation
by the treatment they were receiving, some of the convicts made an
attempt to overpower the guards and get possession of the ships.
They failed, and failure brought increased suffering. The convicts
were after this attempt all heavily ironed: and the bodies of those
who died under the hatches were permitted to <i>remain there and
putrefy for weeks!</i> Is there in all the records of the time when
slave-ships sailed the sea, a story more horrible and horrifying
than this? Some of those who survived the voyage died when being
conveyed to the land in boats, and many of the others landed only
to die. No record has been preserved of the number that died after
they were landed, but Colonel Collins makes this grim
report:&mdash;"All possible expedition was used in getting the sick
on shore, for even while they remained on board many died. The
total number of sick on the last day of June was three hundred and
forty-nine. The melancholy which closed the month of June appeared
unchanged in the beginning of July. The morning generally opened
with depositing in the burying ground the miserable victims of the
night!"</p>
<p>But the officers and men of the New South Wales Corps lived
through it all, and on their arrival they began to shew their
superiority as soldiers wearing the King of England's uniform. Let
Governor Phillip speak. He says:&mdash;"They were observed to be
very intimate with the convicts, living in their huts, eating,
drinking and gambling with them, and perpetually enticing the women
to leave the men." The whole detachment, we are told, with the
exception of the non-commissioned officers and five or six of the
privates, took an oath to stand by each other, and not to suffer a
soldier to be punished for whatever crime he might commit against
an inhabitant; and so we hear Governor Hunter complaining that they
had destroyed the dwelling house of one resident, for sport, no
doubt, and that the greatest part of the detachment on one occasion
left their barracks with their bayonets "to attack an unarmed
people," continuing for four days in "open and avowed mutiny." The
officers did not, certainly, transgress so openly after the fashion
of their inferiors, but they committed outrages of another
character, as fully detailed in Part I; and they gave the sanction
of silence to the "innocent pranks" of the privates in the
Regiment. Governor Hunter it was who wrote to one of the commanding
officers (Lieut. Colonel Paterson) in the following strain, his
anger somewhat interfering with his grammar:&mdash;"I must declare
to you, sir, that the conduct of this part of the New South Wales
Corps has been, in my opinion, the most violent and outrageous that
was ever heard of by any British Regiment whatever!" Major Grose
and Captain Paterson each served as Lieutenant-Governor during the
interregnum, between the departure of Governor Phillip in December,
1792, and the arrival of Governor Hunter in September,
1795&mdash;the former acting two years, and the latter for about
nine months. And here let us drop the New South Wales Corps. I do
not care to handle vice too long.</p>
<p>Again taking up the thread of the narrative proper, we learn
that in October (just six months after leaving on her foraging
mission) the Supply returned to the colony from Batavia, with a
full cargo of provisions, and the captain reported that he had
chartered a Dutch ship, which was following, also laden with
provisions. This was joyful news, and the whole settlement was
immediately put on full allowance. The action of the Governor in
limiting the ration of himself and the officers to that served out
to the soldiers and convicts, while it prevented any expression of
discontent, gave the latter the clearest proof that could be
offered of Phillip's desire to deal fairly with them; and when the
fresh provisions arrived there was general rejoicing. The frequent
recurrence of times of scarcity, however, and the slow growth of
internal production, made the convicts very unsettled, and there
was a wide-spread desire to escape from a condition where
starvation appeared to be a contingency not very remote at any
time. Early in 1791, several daring and successful attempts were
made by prisoners to escape from the colony, by means of boats
stolen from the settlers on the banks of the Parramatta and
Hawkesbury Rivers, and with a view of preventing this an order was
issued by the Governor limiting all boats to be built in future to
a size so small that none but the most foolhardy would think of
escaping in them. Nevertheless, the attempts continued to be made,
but in the majority of cases the boats were so small and weak that
they were swamped almost before they had cleared the Heads.</p>
<p>It was in August of this year that the convicts whose sentences
had expired, and who desired to remain in the colony, were allowed
to select small parcels of land to clear and cultivate for their
own use. The first party, twelve in number, made selections of land
about four miles from Parramatta, at the foot of Prospect Hill.
From this time forward grants of land to emancipatists continued to
be made with more or less liberality, and some of the large estates
in the colony at the present day, if traced back for little over
half a century, will be found to have had their beginning under the
rule which extended the system of land grants to convicts whose
sentences had expired and whose conduct had been good. And many of
the prisoners had earned all that was given to them, for their
services to the colony, apart altogether from the "labour" which
the Government extracted from them as a penalty attaching to crime,
were really very valuable&mdash;which is more than can be said of
the services rendered by the crowds of non-commissioned officers to
whom the public estate was served out in such large slices at this
and at subsequent periods. The real pioneers of the country were
not the retired officers or free settlers, but their assigned
servants; for these were the men who braved the dangers of the
bush, withstood the assaults of the justly incensed aborigines,
cleared the land, cultivated it and made it habitable, and
developed the resources of the country&mdash;while their masters,
during the greater portion of the time, took their ease in what was
then the only centre of civilization in the colony. It does not
detract at all from the merit of the work in which these men
engaged that their labours were not voluntary. It is to their
credit that they performed their duties faithfully and well under
circumstances of the most discouraging kind; and they deserved all
the reward that came to them. As this story proceeds it will be
seen that, as a rule, the men who laid the foundation upon which
the industrial prosperity of the colony has been raised more often
received kicks than half-pence as a reward for their labours.</p>
<p>Many of the more successful of the First Fleeters dwelt on the
Hawkesbury and its tributaries, where the first agricultural
settlers were planted, and from them, even to a date near the
fifties, could be obtained reliable reminiscences of the olden
time. One of these settlers, a Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, who was in
well-to-do circumstances, and who had been freed shortly after
arriving in the colony, told the following thrilling story in the
year 1845:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I arrived in the colony fifty-six years since; it was Governor
Phillip's time and I was fourteen years old; there were only eight
houses in the colony then. I know that myself and eighteen others
laid in a hollow tree for seventeen weeks, and cooked out of a
kettle with a wooden bottom; we used to stick it in a hole in the
ground and make a fire round it. I was seven years in service
(bond) and then started working for a living wherever I could get
it. There was plenty of hardship then. I have often taken grass and
pounded it, and made soup from a native dog. I would eat anything
then. For seventeen weeks I had only five ounces of flour a day. We
never got a full ration except when the ship was in harbour. The
motto was 'kill them or work them; their provision will be in
store.' Many a time have I been yoked like a bullock with twenty or
thirty others to drag along timber. About eight hundred died in
about six months at a place called Toongabbie, or Constitution
Hill. I knew a man so weak he was thrown into the grave; when he
said 'Don't cover me up; I'm not dead; for God's sake don't cover
me up!' The overseer answered 'D&mdash;&mdash;your eyes, you'll die
to night, and we shall have the trouble to come back again!' The
man recovered; his name is James&mdash;&mdash;and he is now alive
at Richmond. They used to have a large hole for the dead. Once a
day men were sent down to collect the corpses of prisoners, and
throw them in without any ceremony or service. The native dogs used
to come down at night and fight and howl in packs, gnawing the poor
dead bodies.</p>
<p>"The Governor would order the lash at the rate of 500, 600, or
800; and if the men could have stood it they would have had more. I
knew a man hung <i>there and then</i> for having stolen a few
biscuits, and another for stealing a duck frock. A man was
condemned&mdash;no time&mdash;take him to a tree, and hang him. The
overseers were allowed to flog the men in the fields. Often have
the men been taken from the gangs, had fifty, and been sent back to
work. Any man would have committed murder for a month's provisions;
I would have committed three (murders) for a week's provision! I
was chained seven weeks on my back for being out getting greens,
wild herbs. The Rev.&mdash;&mdash;used to come it tightly to force
some confession. Men were obliged to tell lies to prevent their
bowels being cut out with the lash!</p>
<p>"Old&mdash;&mdash;(an overseer) killed three men at the saw in a
fortnight by overwork. We used to be taken in large parties to
raise a tree; when the body of the tree was raised he
(old&mdash;&mdash;) would call some of the men away&mdash;then
more; the men were bent double&mdash;they could not bear
it&mdash;they fell&mdash;the tree on one or two, killed on the
spot. 'Take him away; put him in the ground!' There was no more
about it.</p>
<p>"After seven years I got my liberty and then started about
working for a living where I could get it. I stowed myself away on
board the Harrington, bound for Norfolk Island, with eighteen
others; it was not a penal settlement then. Governor King was
there. I had food in plenty. I was overseer of the Governor's
garden. Afterwards I went to live with old D'Arcy Wentworth and a
better master never lived in the world. Little Billy, the great
lawyer, has often been carried in my arms. Old D'Arcy wanted me to
take charge of Homebush station, but I took to the river
(Hawkesbury), worked up and down till I saved enough money to buy
old B&mdash;&mdash;'s farm at Pitt Town. No man worked harder than
I have done. I have by me about &pound;1,000 ready cash. I have given
that farm of forty acres to my son Joseph, and three other farms
and about 500 head of cattle; and about the same to my other son. I
have also got 80 acres besides my house, and some fine cattle. We
are never without a chest of tea in the house; we use two in the
year. I have paid &pound;40 for a chest of tea in this colony. Tea is a
great comfort."</p>
<p>This old man was described as large-featured, handsome, military
sort of face, of a red-brown complexion, clean shaved, and his
dress a flannel shirt with black bandanna, tied sailor fashion,
exposing his strong neck, and a pair of fustian trousers. A coat to
him was like a prison, and he kept religiously away from that
article of dress. He was as rough-mannered as he was honest, and a
story is told of his meeting with Dr.&mdash;&mdash;, who had the
reputation among the prison population of never having spared any
man in his anger or any woman in his lust. It was during the
flogging days, and the Dr. met him in Sydney coming out of the
bank. Holding out his hand the medico said "Come Mr.
S&mdash;&mdash;, shake hands, let bygones be bygones; I am glad to
see you looking so well." The old man put his hands behind him, and
bawled out "I suppose because I have got a velvet waistcoat, and
money in the bank, you want to shake hands; but no!
Dr&mdash;&mdash;, it would take a second resurrection to save such
as thee!" The Dr. did not wait to hear any more.</p>
<p>The old man's wife was blind, but had a good memory, and she
told the following story with tears:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have seen Dr.&mdash;&mdash;take a woman who was in the family
way, with a rope round her, and duck her in the water at Queen's
Wharf. The laws were bad then. If a <i>gentleman</i> wanted a man's
wife he would send the husband to Norfolk Island. I have seen a man
flogged for pulling six turnips instead of five.
One&mdash;&mdash;was overseer, the <i>biggest villain</i> that ever
lived&mdash;delighted in torment. He used to walk up and down and
rub his hands when the blood ran. When he walked out the flogger
walked behind him. He died a miserable death; maggots ate him up,
and not a man could be found to bury him. I have seen six men
executed for stealing 21 lbs of flour. I have seen a man struck
when at work with a handspike, and killed on the spot. I have seen
men in tears round Governor&mdash;&mdash;, begging for food. He
would mock them with 'Yes, yes, gentlemen; I'll make you
comfortable; give you a nightcap and a pair of stockings!'"</p>
<p>Another man in the same year gave this account:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I arrived in the third fleet on the 16th October, 1791; it was
on a Sunday we landed. The ship's name was Barrington, Captain
March. I was sent to Toongabbie. For nine months there I was on
five ounces of flour&mdash;when weighed out barely four; served
daily. In those days we were yoked to draw timber, twenty-five in
gang. The sticks were six feet long, six men abreast. We held the
stick behind us, and dragged with our hands. One man came ashore in
the Pitt; his name was Dixon; he was a gentleman. He was put to the
drag, but it soon done for him. He began on a Thursday and died on
a Saturday, as he was dragging a load down Constitution Hill. There
were thirteen hundred died there in six months. Men used to carry
trees on their shoulders. How they used to die! The men were
weak&mdash;dreadfully weak&mdash;through want of food. A man named
Gibraltar was hung for stealing a loaf out of the Governor's
kitchen. He got down the chimney, stole the loaf, had a trial, and
was hung the next day at sunrise. At this time a full ration was
allowed to the Governor's dog. I have seen seventy men flogged at
night, twenty-five lashes each. On Sunday evening they used to read
the laws. If any man was found out of the camp he got 25. The women
used to be punished with iron collars. In Governor King's time they
used to douse them overboard. They killed one. Dr.&mdash;&mdash;was
a great tyrant. Mine is a life-grant from Governor
Bourke&mdash;fourteen acres. I grow tobacco, wheat, and corn; just
enough to make a living."</p>
<p>A story was current to the following effect, shewing the
arbitrary rule of 1816:&mdash;Governor Bligh "having heard from his
cow-keeper that the servant of an officer of the staff had made
some impertinent remarks because disappointed of the customary
supply of milk for his master, on the following morning sent for
the disappointed delinquent. Wondering and trembling he was ushered
into the presence of His Excellency, who received him with a
condescending smile, and told him that as the chief constable's
house was on his way home, he (the Governor) had simply sent for
him to save a dragoon the trouble of going there with a letter. The
letter was handed to the somewhat bewildered servant, who
straightway delivered it to the chief constable, and as a reward
was immediately tied to the triangles and treated to 25
lashes&mdash;the letter having contained the Governor's warrant for
the payment of the reward."</p>

PASSION&mdash;THE STORY OF BRYANT AND HIS WIFE&mdash;PIRATICAL
CONVICTS&mdash;SEEKING LIBERTY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS&mdash;DEATHS
UNRECORDED.</p>
<p>REFERENCE has already been made to the attempts made by the
convicts to escape from bondage and starvation, and the measures
that were taken to prevent them from succeeding. To fully narrate
the flights by sea and land which the poor wretches essayed would
fill a volume, and the reader must be content with bare outline
here.</p>
<p>Men in extremity will seek refuge in any port, and will
occasionally attempt to run with their eyes closed. In the latter
part of 1791 several absurd attempts to reach China overland were
made by runaway convicts. They believed that far to the north New
South Wales joined China, and that they would be able to reach that
country without any larger stock of provisions than had been served
out for their weekly supply. Twenty started with this idea on the
first occasion, among them being several females; but, seven of
them died in the bush, and the remainder, who were almost naked and
dying of hunger, were brought back to the settlement by search
parties who had been sent in pursuit of them. But still the fancy
grew, and with no further knowledge and no better provisions that
those possessed by the first ill-fated party, numbers of others
made similar attempts. The Commissary's Report for 1792 states that
of the numbers who had left the settlement in the hope of finding
their way to China, no less than forty-four men and nine women had
not since been heard of, and they were supposed either to have
perished or to be still wandering about the bush.</p>
<p>Referring to this matter Bennett says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The idea of the contiguity of China to Australia was possibly
derived from an indistinct notion possessed by some of these
ignorant people of the theory entertained by the old geographers
that the great South Land was connected with Asia. The illiterate
classes of the last century possessed, notwithstanding their want
of book learning, a vast fund of tradition, in which fact and
fiction were wonderfully intermingled. This kind of unwritten
knowledge has now nearly died out in Great Britain, and is perhaps
only to be found among some of the old folks of the remoter part of
Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. It still exists, however, in all its
strength in countries where book learning has not made much
progress. In India and most Eastern countries oral tradition
continues to be the principal medium for the transmission of such
knowledge as the natives possess. The notion about the junction of
Australia with China, if derived from the source indicated, was,
like the belief in the existence of the Great South Land and its
golden treasures, an instance of traditionary knowledge transmitted
from times of very great antiquity, and was a part of that
folk-lore of which it is now, in most cases, difficult, if not
impossible, to trace their origin. The Chinese, it should be
remembered, had been accustomed to visit the northern coasts of
Australia for ages, and they had numerous settlements in the Indian
Archipelago in very remote times."</p>
<p>The rage concerning China appeared to reach its climax in 1798.
Barrington, under date May of that year, says:&mdash;"Some of the
Irishmen who had for some time been searching for a road to China,
were brought in by the settlers near George's River. They had
wandered through the woods till nearly perished for want of food,
when they were discovered in an unexpected way. Some people going
from Botany Bay up George's River, had lost themselves by following
an arm of that river never before looked into. During this mistake
they met these people, whose want of knowledge of the country led
them down on a point of land placed between two waters, where they
remained nine days, unable to return, and must have perished, had
not an accidental mistake led the people in the boat to them. The
narrative given of their travels and sufferings was the same as of
other similar adventurers, and added one more to the many
already-recounted to prove that daring folly and extreme ignorance
must be acting in strong conjunction over the minds of those who
made such attempts."</p>
<p>Collins, in his history, says:&mdash;"Occasional desertions of
one or two people at a time had occurred from the first
establishment of the colony; but the first Irish convicts that
arrived from Ireland in the year 1791 went off in numerous bodies,
few of whom ever returned.. .. It was not then to be wondered at
that Wilson, who had returned from living in the woods, should,
among other articles of information, mention his finding of more
than fifty skeletons, which the natives assured him had been white
men, who had lost their way and perished. This account was
corroborated by different European articles which were found, such
as knives, old shoes, and other things which were known not to
belong to the natives." The locality where Wilson says he saw the
skeletons was on the lower ranges of the Blue Mountains which had
up to that time been penetrated by no white man save
Wilson&mdash;who was himself a runaway convict.</p>
<p>In January, 1788, a large number of prisoners, misled by
misinterpretations of stories by the blacks, conceived the idea
that there was a colony of white people about 500 miles to the
South West, and at once formed a plan to escape to that place; but
the plot was discovered and sixteen of the prisoners were brought
back to Sydney and punished. In order, however, to convince the
convicts of their error, the Governor decided to dispatch four of
the strongest malcontents, with four soldiers and guides, on a
journey in the direction of the supposed colony. After an absence
of ten days three of them returned, but the fourth man being
determined to proceed was left with the guides to further prosecute
the unsuccessful and hazardous journey. They returned, however,
after being out twenty-six days, and for a time there was no
further disposition manifested to hunt for any new colony.</p>
<p>Numerous attempts were made by the convicts to seize large boats
and ships, and in several cases with success, although the results
were not in any case recorded as favorable to the convicts as they
desired. In 1797 some convicts seized the "Cumberland;" in 1799
another party seized the "Venus;" in 1799 a strong party seized the
"Harrington" and got clear away with her, but she was subsequently
captured in the Indian Seas by H.M.S. Phoenix on the way back, and
the vessel was wrecked, and all the convicts escaped or perished.
In 1813 the "Unity" was taken out of the harbour by convicts, and
three years later the "Trial;" but the latter was wrecked, and it
is supposed that the convicts on board were either drowned or
killed by natives on the island near which the vessel foundered.
The place where the wrecked boat was subsequently found by Mr.
Oxley, the explorer, was called "Trial Bay." In 1817 the "William
Caesar" was taken, and in 1823 the "Isabella." The Government boat
"William Caesar" was afterwards found north of Port Stephens. In
1853 the "Lady Franklyn" was seized by 22 convicts who were being
conveyed in her from Norfolk Island to Van Diemen's Land, they kept
possession of the vessel for eleven days and then abandoned her and
took to the boats, having first loaded the boats with provisions.
Several other cases will be given when the histories of notorious
convicts are being dealt with in subsequent chapters.</p>
<p>In 1823, a small craft was seized at Port Macquarie and was not
afterwards heard of.</p>
<p>On October 4th, 1828, an assigned servant and five other
prisoners absconded from the station of Mr. McQueen, and attempted
to reach Timor or New Guinea overland. After penetrating the
country for 200 or 300 miles and enduring the most frightful
sufferings, by which all his companions died, McQueen's servant
returned and gave himself up to a Justice of the Peace.</p>
<p>In 1842 the "Governor Phillip," a vessel employed by Government
to carry provisions to and from Norfolk Island, was piratically
seized by the prisoners of the island. The boats crew of twelve
prisoners, who were employed between the vessel and the island, by
a preconcerted signal, disarmed the sentry on board, compelled such
of the crew who were on deck to jump overboard, and secured the
captain, mate, and soldiers below deck. The Captain and mate by
breaking through a partition, communicated with the soldiers, and
an attack upon the convicts was commenced by firing through the
crevices. The shots took effect; the soldiers rushed on deck, and
after a brief struggle, recaptured the vessel. One soldier was
killed and five others were wounded; and of the convicts five were
killed and two wounded. The others were tried and convicted, and
four of them were executed.</p>
<p>One very peculiar story of attempted escape is told, the period
being 1792. A convict named Bryant, who was engaged in fishing for
the supply of the settlement, with his wife and a number of other
convicts determined to make an attempt to escape in a small fishing
boat. They stole the boat, and entered upon a most hazardous
journey. Nothing being heard of them for a considerable time, it
was thought that the escapees had perished, but it afterwards
appeared that some of them had succeeded in reaching Batavia, after
almost incredible sufferings, and that here Bryant, one of his
children and two of his companions died from the effects of the
hardships they had undergone. Bryant's wife and child and four of
the convicts were then taken on board an English ship, and the
latter were delivered up to the authorities. On their arrival in
England the story of their sufferings excited so much compassion
that on being brought up at the bar of the Old Bailey, they were
merely ordered by the Court to remain in Newgate prison until their
original sentences of transportation had expired.</p>
<p>Some remarkable stories are told concerning runaway convicts who
became pirates, after having either overpowered their custodians or
cut the vessels out at night while they lay quietly at anchor in
Sydney harbour. Some of these pirates were captured; but many were
never afterwards heard of, and the probability is that in many
cases shipwreck followed escape, and death by drowning or in the
maws of the ravenous sharks followed the shipwreck. But in the
memoirs of John Williams, the pioneer missionary of the South Seas,
there is evidence that many of these piratical convicts, being
skilful with the compass, made the South Sea Islands, and for a
time ruled as bloodthirsty Kings. Here is an account of the doings
of a few of the monsters whose infamies brought them to fearful
deaths. Says the writer:&mdash;"Many of the runaway sailors who
came to the islands were convicts from New South Wales who had
stolen vessels and had thus made their escape. I was informed that
soon after the first missionaries visited the islands, a gang of
these pirates came there in a fine schooner, which, after stripping
off her sails and every article of value, they scuttled and sunk a
few hundred yards from the shore. Shortly before this another gang
of these desperadoes arrived in a stolen vessel at the Society
Islands; and although treated with the greatest kindness by the
chief, Huaihine, they contrived, after plundering his house of all
his property, among which was a blunderbuss and a small cask of
powder, to decamp at night in a whaleboat. Two native crews were
sent after them, and unfortunately one of the canoes fell in with
them. They were saluted with the contents of the blunderbuss which
blew the head of one of them to pieces. Two more were killed by the
same weapon, and a fourth severely wounded. The only other person
present was a little boy, who jumped into the sea, and hid himself
behind the canoe, when the wretches supposing that they had
completed their work of destruction, hoisted their sail and
departed. The boy then climbed into the canoe, and assisted by the
wounded man, rowed to the shore. On my return from one of my
voyages, I found several of these men at Raiatea. They immediately
came to me and represented themselves as shipwrecked mariners. In
reply to my inquiries, they said they were wrecked in 73deg. north,
and were only three weeks in reaching the Society Islands. I
replied immediately that the tale was a foolish fabrication; that I
was convinced they were convicts; and that I should write by the
first opportunity to inform the Governor of Sydney of their
arrival. They left Raiatea the day after, or perhaps some of our
people would have been murdered as those of Huaihine were.
Subsequently these ungrateful wretches reached the Navigators'
Islands, where they entered with savage delight into the wars of
the natives, and having firearms and powder, they made fearful
havoc among them. However, vengeance suffered them not to live, for
the leader of this murderous gang very soon fell a victim to his
temerity. On one occasion, seeing a number of the opposite party
clustered together, he fired his blunderbuss, heavily loaded with
bullets, and killed nine upon the spot, beside wounding others. The
natives, however, did not give him time to reload his murderous
weapon, but rushed upon him and killed him with their clubs. The
chief for whom he was fighting entertained so high an opinion of
his bravery that he cut off his head and carefully sewed the
fractured parts of the skull together with fine civet. The chief
and his family worship this convict's head as containing the spirit
of war. A second of these wretched men was drowned in endeavouring
to make his escape. A third pirate convict fell in battle shortly
afterwards, but to the monster of iniquity, whom the natives put to
death, a longer time was allowed. Of this individual I received
most fearful accounts. It was stated that this convict had killed
upwards of 200 natives with his own hands. Being an excellent
marksman, no one could escape who came within the reach of his
musket. The natives fled as soon as they perceived him; and to
avoid detection with fiendish ingenuity he smeared himself with
charcoal and oil. He seldom left the fort of the party for whom he
was fighting without killing a number of the enemy whose heads were
invariably cut off, and ranged before him during his meals. He
often seated himself upon a kind of stage, smeared with blood, and
surrounded with the heads of his victims. In this state his
followers would convey him on their shoulders, with songs of savage
triumph, to his own residence. The party for whom he fought was,
however, conquered, and he saved his life by fleeing to the
mountains, where he lived three months upon roots, or whatever else
he could obtain. At length he came to Manono, and threw himself
upon the mercy of the chiefs, who spared him upon the condition
that he should never again engage in their wars. But a few months
after this, having received authentic information of his secret
intrigues with the opposite party, the chiefs held a consultation,
at which it was determined to put him to death. One of their
number, a powerful young warrior, was charged with this commission,
and selecting a few faithful followers he proceeded at midnight to
the murderer's house, and, by a single blow, severed his head from
his body."</p>
<p>But the runaways by sea were far less numerous than the runaways
by land. Until the country to the westward and southward had been
explored and settled, extraordinary rumours concerning the unknown
country in that direction gained currency among the convicts. We
have seen how the idea that China could be reached overland
operated in the case of a number of the Irish prisoners. Many
others entertained notions equally foolish&mdash;of a nation of
white men living on beautiful plains beyond the then impassable
chain of Blue Mountains, of a race of copper-coloured people living
in plenty far away in the bush, and other fanciful and erroneous
ideas; and in seeking to escape from their chains and the lash to
these imaginary places of refuge at a distance, hundreds of the
convicts met their death, their skeletons being found years
afterwards bleaching in the gullies or on the mountain side. If
they chanced to be discovered before the blacks had speared them or
they had died from starvation, they were taken back to the
settlement and carefully nursed until they had recovered sufficient
strength to endure the correction of blood-letting under the
lash.</p>
<p>Here is one miserable story of an exploring expedition made by a
party of convicts without authority:&mdash;</p>
<p>In 1815 the recently-discovered passage over the Blue Mountains
was looked upon by some sanguine-minded convicts as the road to
liberty, and eight of them escaped from their guardians at Windsor
and set off with the intention of reaching the western coast by
crossing the ranges and then building a vessel, by the aid of which
they hoped to escape to the island of Timor. But it very nearly
proved the road to death. They left Windsor on October 14th, the
commencement of the hot weather, taking with them a small quantity
of provisions, a few blankets, some cooking utensils, an axe, a
musket, a pistol, some ammunition, a few articles of wearing
apparel and four dogs. Fearing pursuit they avoided the mountain
road and travelled on the summit of the ranges, going alternately
on each side of the only beaten route. The hardships which they
encountered in this inhospitable country may be imagined. They
suffered great fatigue, being under the necessity of frequently
lowering each other down the steep precipices which barred their
way, and having very little to eat. At the end of six days their
provisions had failed, and for three days they were without food,
their hope of finding fish in a stream upon which they came being
broken by the absence of the fish. At the end of the ninth day,
when at the point of starvation, they passed the mountains and fell
in with a herd of cattle which had just previously been sent into
the "new country." They hunted and killed some of the calves and
had a feast, which encouraged them to pursue their journey. Passing
on they came to the new settlement at Bathurst, but they were
careful to keep out of view, and coming upon some more calves on
the plains they killed them and fondly buoyed themselves up with
the false hope that the flesh would last them until they reached
the sea, into which they no doubt imagined the Macquarie emptied
itself. But the supply of provisions thus obtained failed soon
after they had passed the settlement, and being unsuccessful in
their attempts to bag the only game within view&mdash;the emu and
kangaroo,&mdash;they resorted to fishing. But they had no tackle,
and a few of their number returned to the settlement, which they
entered under cover of darkness, and carried off the halyards of
the first flagstaff that had been erected on the western side of
the Blue Mountains. From these they made fishing lines, and thus
furnished they continued their journey, following the course of the
Macquarie River. But hunger and fatigue had taken the spirit, as
well as the physical strength, out of one man, and he deserted his
companions, returned to the plains, and surrendered himself to the
settlement. The remainder of the party continued their journey
beyond Bathurst for a period of twenty-four days, but their
sufferings must have been terrible, as failing to procure game or
fish, they had to kill and eat their dogs in order to allay their
hunger and supply bait for fishing. Subsequently they were confined
in their diet by force of circumstances to a very little fish and
what nettles and wild mint they could find growing near the river.
When reduced to the utmost straits they fell in with a party of
natives, and to them they intimated by signs that they were
famished and wished to be guided to Bathurst, where they would
gladly give themselves up to the authorities. The blacks brought
some fish and turtle, but would not part with any except in
exchange for some of the articles of clothing belonging to the
fugitives. They then started on their return with as much
expedition as their fast failing strength would allow, subsisting
almost entirely on herbs, with a little fish and game supplied by
the blacks in exchange for articles of clothing. After two days one
of their number fell sick and he was left behind in care of the
strongest of the party, while the other five proceeded towards the
plains, until, becoming quite exhausted, they gave themselves up
for lost, being unable to proceed any further. Their joy may be
imagined when at this juncture they saw two white men approaching.
The new comers gave them bread, but they were scarcely able to eat
it. A cart was subsequently brought from the settlement, and the
absconders were shortly afterwards rejoiced to find themselves once
more surrounded by their own countrymen in a place where food was
obtainable. The man who had been left in charge of his sick
companion left his patient to die where he lay as soon as the main
party had disappeared, and reached the settlement in full vigour
shortly after them. The whole of the survivors were sent on to
Windsor, where for a length of time they lay in so weak a condition
that their recovery was considered hopeless. But recovering
strength, their narrative was turned to good account, as all
information concerning the grand western country was gladly
accepted, from whatever source it came. The three ringleaders of
the party were flogged and worked in irons as soon as they
recovered, as a warning to others who might wish to seek new
country without permission and official guidance.</p>
<p>So frequent did these attempts to escape become that periodical
musters were established, and in 1801 an order was issued to the
effect that any free person not appearing at the general musters
would be taken up as a vagrant, and punished with the utmost rigour
of the law, while if the absentee were a convict he would be
sentenced to one month's confinement in the "Battery Gang."</p>
<p>In 1795, a vessel which was driven by contrary winds to seek
shelter at Port Stephens found there four white men who were at
first supposed to be shipwrecked seamen, but who turned out to be
runaway convicts who had been missing for nearly five years, and
were supposed to have perished. Here is the account which was
published shortly after the occurrence:&mdash;"The ship Providence,
of twenty-eight guns, commanded by Captain Broughton, from England,
met with very bad weather on her passage from the Brazil coast, and
was driven past the harbour of Port Jackson as far to the northward
as Port Stephens, in which she anchored; and where, to the great
surprise of Captain Broughton, he found and received on board four
white people (if four miserable, naked, dirty, and smoke-dried men
could be called white), runaways from Parramatta in the month of
September, 1790, by name John Tarwood, George Lee, Connoway and
John Watson. Their fifth companion (Joseph Sutton) had died. They
told a melancholy tale of their sufferings in the boat; and for
many days after their arrival they passed their time in detailing
to the crowds, both of black and white people which attended, their
adventures in Port Stephens, the first harbour that they made.
Having lived like the savages among whom they dwelt, the change of
food soon disagreed with them, and they were all taken ill,
appearing to be principally affected with abdominal swellings. They
spoke in high terms of the pacific disposition and gentle manners
of the natives. Each of these had had a name given him, and given
with several ceremonies. Wives also were allotted them, and one or
two had children. They were never required to go out on any
occasion of hostility, and were in general supplied by the natives
with fish or other food, being considered by them (for so their
situation could only be construed) as unfortunate strangers thrown
upon their shore from the mouth of the yawning deep, and therefore
entitled to their protection. They told a ridiculous story, that
the natives appeared to worship them, often assuring them, when
they began to understand each other, that they were undoubtedly the
ancestors of some of them that had fallen in battle, and had
returned from the sea to visit them again; and one native appeared
firmly to believe that his father was come back in the person of
either Lee or Connoway, and took them to the spot where his body
had been burnt. On being told that immense numbers of people
existed far beyond their little knowledge, they instantly
pronounced them to be the spirits of their countrymen, which, after
death, had migrated into other regions."</p>
<p>Writing of events which transpired during this same year (1795)
Captain Collins says:&mdash;"There were at this time several
convicts in the woods subsisting by theft; and it having been
reported that three of them had been met armed, it became necessary
to secure them as soon as possible. People were sent out
immediately, and one of the wretched runaways was soon met with in
the act of robbing a garden, and, refusing to surrender, was shot.
The knowledge of his fate drove the others to a greater distance
from the settlement."</p>
<p>Hundreds of other runaway stories similar to those cited could
be given, but I have chosen from the host a few of those which I
have considered most suitable for shewing the horrors attendant
upon any attempt to escape from the regulated miseries in the
discipline of the barracks or the gangs. The sufferings in the
bush, however great, were simply taken by the runaways as a relief,
and in many cases if these sufferings were unto death, the relief
was counted all the greater. The lingering agonies of starvation in
the bush were considered by many of these poor wretches infinitely
preferable to the oft-recurring tortures of the lash or the
ankle-chains. How many died from starvation in the fastnesses of
the unexplored mountains, or beneath the waters outside the
harbour, or from spear or club wounds inflicted by the natives,
will never be known, for a full record was never kept, a score or
two convicts less being considered of but little moment in a
community where they were so numerous.</p>

HELLS"&mdash;DR. WHITE'S REPORTS&mdash;CHAINS, HANDCUFFS, AND "THE
CAT"&mdash;OTHER AMUSEMENTS&mdash;SURGEON CUNNINGHAM'S
ACCOUNT&mdash;THE FEMALE VOYAGERS&mdash;STARTLING STATISTICS.</p>
<p>THE description already given of the treatment and condition of
the "First Fleeters" on board the transports during the voyage from
England to Australia will not serve as an illustration of the
ordinary voyages of the vessels chartered to convey convicts to
these shores, and it is necessary that I should deal with the
subject in a more exhaustive manner. The whole story of life on
board these convict ships is a dark and terrible one, yet the
system of felonry cannot fully be described without its narration,
and the reader will bear in mind that some of the darkest details
are not and cannot be given.</p>
<p>After sentence of transportation was passed in the old country
convicts were sent to the hulks or gaols, where they remained until
the period of their departure arrived. On board the vessels they
were under the sole control of the surgeon-superintendent, who was
furnished with instructions as to his conduct from the Admiralty.
Mortality amongst the prisoners prevailed to a fearful extent in
the earlier days of transportation, the physical evils of the long
voyage proving most disastrous, while, owing to faulty discipline,
and close contact between so many of the criminals, moral evils
reeked and festered in abomination during the passage out.</p>
<p>The manner in which Transportation was conducted was thus
described in a report from the Select Committee of the House of
Commons in 1812:&mdash;"When the hulks are full up to their
establishment, and the convicted offenders in the different
counties are beginning to accumulate, a vessel is taken up for the
purpose of conveying a part of them to New South Wales. A selection
is in the first instance made of all the male convicts under the
age of 50, who are sentenced to transportation for life and for
fourteen years; and the number is filled up with such from amongst
those sentenced to transportation for 7 years as are the most
unruly in the hulks, or are convicted of the most atrocious crimes:
with respect to female convicts it has been customary to send,
without any exception, all whose state of health will admit of it,
and whose age does not exceed 45 years."</p>
<p>Tenders were invited when a ship was required, and the lowest
tender was accepted. It was then fitted up with provisions,
medicine, clothes, &amp;c., for the number of convicts it would
carry. The surgeon in whose charge the convicts were placed was
instructed to keep a diary not only of the illness on board but of
the number of convicts admitted on deck, of the scraping the decks,
cleaning the berths, and the general treatment of the transports.
The sick were to be visited twice a day and the healthy once, and
he received a gratuity of 10/6 for every convict landed in New
South Wales from that vessel. The master of the ship was expected
to perform certain duties, and if his conduct proved satisfactory,
the log-book being his judge, he received a gratuity of &pound;50 from
the Governor; but if the contrary turned out to be the case he was
liable to prosecution. About 200 men or women were generally
embarked on board one ship, with a guard of thirty men and an
officer.</p>
<p>These remarks apply to the custom prevailing after 1801, for
prior to that time matters were conducted very loosely, and not a
few of the transport ships were simply floating hells. As a proof
that there had been some improvement the mortality tables shew that
while from the year 1795 to 1801 of 3,833 convicts embarked, 385
died during the voyage, being nearly 1 in 10, of the first 2,398
embarked after 1801 only 52 died on the passage, being 1 in 46. No
arrangement whatever was made for the performance of Divine service
on the transports, and the Select Committee in 1812 spoke very
strongly on that point, with the result that some little
improvement was made in after years. Up to this time the list of
convicts sent with the Government despatches was deficient,
inasmuch as it did not particularise the offences of which the
convicts had been convicted, and in distributing them upon their
arrival the Governor had no clue to guide him in giving to them
more or less advantageous situations, according to their characters
and crimes.</p>
<p>That forty of the convicts out of the 750 brought in the first
transports that accompanied Governor Phillip should die on the
voyage, was not considered a very remarkable circumstance,
considering that the ships were nearly twelve months on the water,
and that the provision for their accommodation on board was not of
the best kind. But these convicts were better treated than were
thousands of their fellows who were subsequently sent out, as has
already been shewn. It is almost impossible to preserve decency in
writing when describing the manner in which these unfortunate
wretches were treated on board&mdash;the females especially; but
everything I have here set down is borne out by State documents, in
which the blood-curdling details are given without remark, as
though the events were as natural as they were common. The convict
vessels might well be described "Floating Hells."</p>
<p>The work of carrying convicts was, as I have said, entrusted to
contractors whose greed only equalled their unscrupulousness. They
received sixpence per day in the earlier times for the food
allowance of each prisoner, besides a tonnage rate, and as the
sixpences accumulated in proportion to the length of the voyage, it
will be understood that to make speed was not considered by the
ship owners or their captains the most important part of their
duty. Then there was no deduction made for deaths on the voyage,
and we may be sure that the knowledge of this fact did not make the
lives of the manacled wretches under their care of greater value in
the eyes of the captains. The reports of Dr. White, the surgeon who
came out with the First Fleet, and who for years after his arrival
acted in his official capacity, give some idea of the mortality on
board some of these "Floating Hells." He says in one
place:&mdash;"Of the 939 males sent out by the last ships&mdash;the
Surprise, Scarborough, and Neptune&mdash;261 died on board, and 50
have died since landing; the number of sick this day is 450, and
many who are reckoned as not sick have barely strength to attend to
themselves; when the last ships arrived we had not 60 people sick
in the colony." This was in the year 1790, and the vessels formed
part of what was known as the Second Fleet. On the last-named
vessel the number that succumbed was 164. No less than sixty-six
died on another vessel in 1802 between Cape Town and Sydney, and
during the eight years following the establishment of the
settlement the total number of those who died on the voyage was
computed at one-tenth of the whole number sent out.</p>
<p>Dr. White further reports that when visiting the vessels on
their arrival in Port, such inspection forming part of his duty, he
sometimes found amongst the living convicts below, the bodies of
those who had died in their chains, the chains being still upon
them. Here is a picture drawn by him of what he saw and experienced
during another official visit of inspection:&mdash;"A great number
of them (the convicts) were lying, some half and others nearly
quite naked, without either bed or bedding, unable to turn or help
themselves. The smell was so offensive that I could hardly bear it.
Some of these unhappy people died after the ship came into the
harbour, before they could be taken on shore. Part of these had
been thrown into the harbour, and their dead bodies cast upon the
shore, and were seen lying naked on the rocks. The misery I saw
amongst them is inexpressible." And one ceases to marvel that this
should be so when he learns that the prisoners were crowded in the
holds of the vessels without any regard to air space or
convenience, the vessels being mere tubs. Slave ships, when the
slave trade was at its worst, never carried human cargoes such as
were carried by these transports, condemned to suffer agonies which
no groaning could relieve and no appeals for mercy could soften. A
recent writer, referring to the condition of the convicts in the
vessels, very tersely sums up the case, thus:&mdash;"Herded like
pigs, but not half so well-fed; half-clothed, and robbed on board
of any comforts a kind hand might have provided for the voyage;
chained to a dead body, sometimes, or to a dying man, and flogged
into mutiny and out of it at the caprice of a drunken skipper,
these unhappy convicts, in their despair, often preferred the
gaping maw of a hungry shark to the horrors of the prison-ship. The
shark, at least, would use no more violence than was necessary. But
the records show that these drunken skippers tortured their victims
because they liked it."</p>
<p>The account which has already been given in one of the previous
chapters, shewing how the convicts were treated on the vessels
which brought out the first contingent of the New South Wales
Corps, does not stand as a singular record of the ill-usage and
brutality to which they were subjected&mdash;it forms but one of
many which could be given, all equally horrifying. From the officer
in command to the rawest of the recruits, and from the skipper to
the lowest among the sailors on board&mdash;all treated the
prisoners as though they had been handed over to them, body and
soul, to be made sport of; and the simplest form of sport indulged
in was the indiscriminate use of the "cat-o'-nine-tails." The men
would take it in turns to ply the lash, and there is one record of
forty-two male and eight female convicts having been flogged at the
gangway by the soldiers and sailors on the "Marquis of Cornwallis"
in 1796, one of the convicts having disclosed an intended mutiny to
the captain, who thus sought to break the rebellious spirits of his
charge. Another record tells how the whole cargo of convicts was
kept in irons during the entire voyage, "in consequence," as
Governor Hunter puts it, "of some conjecture that they meant to
seize the ship and murder the officers." In 1798 a vessel left
England for Sydney with recruits for the New South Wales Corps,
there being put on board with them sixty female prisoners, and
provisions for the settlement. The reader must imagine the scenes
of debauchery that were enacted during that voyage. There was soon
mutiny onboard. The soldiers murdered the master and chief-mate and
seized the ship, and after carousing to their hearts' content for a
time, they made for Rio Janeiro and handed the vessel over to the
Portuguese governor.</p>
<p>Chains and handcuffs did duty with the scourge and the rifle. We
are told that one vessel carried 36 handcuffs and 200 basils with
chains for use on the voyage, and that on more than one occasion
the captain of a convict ship fired into the hold amongst the
prisoners to check a disturbance among them. Is it at all wonderful
that one-tenth of the prisoners sent out in the early days should
have "died" on the voyage?&mdash;is it not wonderful, rather, that
more than one-tenth survived the horrors of the long residence in
these Infernos on the sea?</p>
<p>Under the better regulations subsequently introduced, however,
and with humane men in command, the horrors of the voyage were to a
great degree mitigated. Surgeon Cunningham, R.N., who on several
occasions served as surgeon-superintendent on board a transport
ship, thus describes the voyage and the method of treating the
convicts during its continuance, his experiences extending over
years preceding 1826:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Before leaving the Hulk, the male convicts are roughly clothed
in new suits, and ironed; and it is curious to observe with what
nonchalance some of these fellows will turn the jingling of their
chains into music whereto they dance and sing. Two rows of
sleeping-berths, one above the other, extend on each side of the
between-decks of the convicts ship, each berth being six feet
square, and calculated to hold four convicts, everyone thus
possessing eighteen inches of space to sleep in&mdash;and
<i>ample</i> space, too! The hospital is in the forepart of the
ship, with a bulk-head across separating it from the prison, having
two doors with locks to keep out intruders; while a separate prison
is built for the boys, to cut off all intercourse between them and
the men. Strong wooden stanchions thickly studded with nails are
fixed round the fore and main hatchways, between decks, in each of
which is a door with three padlocks, to let the convicts out and
in, and secure them at night. The convicts by these means have no
access through the hole to the prison, a ladder being placed in
each hatchway for them to go up and down by, which is pulled on
deck at night. Scuttle-holes, to open and shut for the admission of
air, are cut out along the ship's sides; a large stove and funnel
placed between decks, for warmth and ventilation; swing stoves and
charcoal put on board, to carry about into the damp
corners;&mdash;and, in fact, everything that can be thought of
provided to secure health and proper comfort to the convicts during
their voyage. Each is allowed a pair of shoes, three shirts, two
pairs of trousers, and other warm clothing on his embarkation,
besides a bed, pillow, and blanket&mdash;while Bibles, Testaments,
prayer-books, and psalters, are distributed among the messes.</p>
<p>"The rations are both good and abundant, three-quarters of a
pound of biscuits being the daily allowance of bread, whilst each
day the convict sits down to dinner off either beef, pork, or plum
pudding, having pea-soup four times a week, and a pot of gruel
every morning, with sugar or butter in it. Vinegar is issued to the
messes weekly; and as soon as the ship has been three weeks at sea,
each man is served with one ounce of lime-juice and the same of
sugar daily, to guard against scurvy; while two gallons of good
Spanish red wine, and one hundred and forty gallons of water are
put on board for issuing to each likewise&mdash;three to four gills
of wine weekly, and three quarts of water daily, being the general
allowance. The sick are in like manner provided with all requisite
medicines and comforts, as well as with warm dresses, spare
bedding, sheets, and every description of hospital furniture.</p>
<p>"The common diet of the convicts is certainly <i>more</i> than
is requisite to keep them in health, as they have no work to do;
but it is not more than is <i>politic</i> to allow them; because,
if you stint them on the voyage you must keep them under greater
restraint, and their healths will suffer in consequence. Two
delegates, chosen in succession from the several messes, daily see
the provisions weighed out, and justice done to the whole body in
that particular. . . . .</p>
<p>"Previous to the convicts embarking I have the whole prison
thoroughly secured and ventilated, all the mess-berths and mess
articles numbered according to their corresponding messes, and the
beds, blankets and pillows marked with consecutive numeral figures
in black paint, from No. 1 up to the highest number of convicts
embarked. The beds are all marked at the same corner, and the
pillows being sewed to the head of them (with a stout cord appended
to tie them up by) the blankets are now placed inside, and all
rolled together with the number of the bed on the outside (to admit
its being referred to) and the whole placed according to their
consecutive numbers in the sleeping berths, ready for distribution.
The convicts are allowed to choose their own messmates; and on the
mess-list being arranged upon deck, they are put below and placed
according to muster in their respective messes and sleeping-berths;
each mess being supplied with its necessary utensils, and each
individual furnished with the bed corresponding to his
name&mdash;all thus messing and sleeping along the prison-deck in
regular numeral progression.</p>
<p>"Every article of clothing belonging to each individual is next
uniformly marked in a conspicuous manner with a number
corresponding to the bed he has been supplied with, which prevents
the thieving each other's articles, enables every man to know his
own from his neighbour's, enables the surgeon to distinguish them
in litigated cases, and enables also any individual in the ship to
single out an ill-doer by simply taking a note of his number,
without reference either to his name or personal appearance. Before
I adopted this plan of numbering the clothing, the lazy
incorrigibles would toss their dirty garments overboard, and coolly
help themselves to a clean suit from their simpler comrades.</p>
<p>"The next consideration is, to cull out a portion of the most
fitting among them to make a sort of petty officers of, for seeing
orders executed and keeping the others in subjection. These
individuals are called 'Captains of the deck,' four officiating in
the prison and two upon deck; all the convicts being obliged to
obey their orders equally with the surgeons; while a captain is
appointed to each mess, who sees his place kept tidy, attends for
the rations, and is responsible for the orderly demeanour of the
other five members. Two individuals are also employed to fill the
cisterns, &amp;c., every day; two to take charge of the hospital,
and four to attend to the schools.</p>
<p>"The captains of the deck have double allowance of wine each day
it is served, and a glass of rum during the other days of the week.
The rest of the individuals in <i>office</i> have only double
allowance of wine for their trouble, but all official characters
are permitted to carry their wine away and drink it, the remainder
being obliged to drink theirs at the tub. I also allow each captain
of the deck and hospital man two pounds of tobacco for use on the
voyage, served out to them in portions monthly, besides giving them
the choice of the clothes, and, in fact, every little encouragement
possible, to insure the correct performance of their duty. Six or
eight pounds expended in this way by the surgeon, out of his own
pocket, will be amply repaid him in the greater ease with which he
can carry on his duty, and the satisfaction he will reap in the
good order resulting. The main objects to be looked to, with regard
to the management of the convicts, are&mdash;seeing strict justice
done them in issuing the rations from the ship's stores; promoting
cleanliness, comfort, and hilarity among them; admitting them
freely upon deck to take the air; and striking off their irons as
early on the voyage as due caution may warrant.</p>
<p>"The upper and lower decks are daily cleaned under the
superintendence of the captains of the deck, being scrubbed,
swabbed, scraped, or dry holy-stoned, according to the state of the
weather; the whole of the prisoners being constantly kept on deck
till the prison is thoroughly dry.</p>
<p>"Dancing is encouraged also every afternoon, and they may
<i>sing</i> all day long if they please. As they have but little to
amuse themselves with, endeavours must be made to find amusement
for them, and this can be no ways better accomplished than by
giving them something to work at.</p>
<p>"Three separate written codes are pasted upon boards and hung up
between-decks, for individual perusal, after being first read over
and commented on. One contains the duties of the captains of the
deck, captains of the messes, delegates for attending the issuing
of provisions, &amp;c.; another, regulations regarding divine
service, the cleaning of the deck, cutting up and cooking the meat
rations, washing-days, musters, schools, &amp;c.; the third being a
sort of criminal code, in which every offence that can be committed
and the punishment awarded, are plainly expressed.</p>
<p>"It is also essential to point out <i>explicitly</i> to every
man what you expect from him, as he then clearly understands the
duties he has to perform, as well as the consequence of his failure
therein; and by impressing upon the minds of the culprits that it
is for <i>their</i> good, as well as for the good of their
associates, that you punish them, they in general quietly submit.
Gambling is a prevailing vice, and requires great exertion to keep
it under; dice, cards, pitch-and-toss, and various other
speculations, soon become general, unless checked; and to such a
height of infatuation will this vice be carried, that I have known
a country simpleton go three whole days without food, having
gambled away all his rations for that period. Until gambling is
stopped, thieving will be carried on; because the fellow who loses
his own dinner will always insure one out of some other person's
mess, unless he is a very sorry thief indeed, which was the
<i>failing</i> of the three-day's Lent keeper before spoken of. I
do not object to their bartering and selling their rations among
each other, never seeing any harm accrue from it. Indeed, I could
not stop it if I would. They seldom eat promiscuously at a meal,
but the mess allowance is divided into six equal parts, and awarded
by lot (being as suspicious of each other's honesty in
<i>eating</i> as in everything else). The provisions are cooked by
two of their own body, who have the fat as a perquisite, which they
readily sell in New South Wales for &pound;10, thus clearing &pound;5 each on
the voyage.</p>
<p>"The convicts have changes of garments weekly, one shirt and a
pair of trowsers being marked with the letter A above the numeral,
and the others with the letter B, the individual wearing A shirt
and trowsers one week and B shirt and trowsers the next. They are
all mustered in the prison every fine evening, with their shoes and
stockings off and trousers rolled over their knees, to see that
their persons are clean&mdash;as many of them would not wash during
the voyage if not compelled. During the warm weather the half of
them bathe every morning, and on Sunday they are all mustered to
hear the church-service read on the quarter-deck&mdash;the guard
being kept under arms during the time.</p>
<p>"Thirty-three soldiers compose the guard (under command of a
commissioned officer), who do duty in three alternate watches upon
the poop or quarter-deck&mdash;a sentry with a drawn cutlass
guarding the small doors in the barricade across the upper deck
dividing them from the convicts.</p>
<p>"No instance has been known of a convict-ship being captured by
the convicts, nor indeed is such a thing possible with anything
like ordinary precaution; as, being so treacherous to each other,
abundance of them are always ready enough to inform. The Jane Shore
was taken by the soldiers and sailors conjointly&mdash;women
convicts only being onboard, by whom they were instigated. (The
mutineers shot the captain and chief-mate, and carried the ship
into Monte Video). The establishment of an effective police amongst
themselves will always check any attempts at combination. The petty
officers must be composed of thieves of the highest repute for the
number and nature of their offences, inasmuch as these are most
likely to keep down the others. The veteran thief assumes the same
sort of lofty port and high-toned consequence over the juniors of
the <i>profession</i> that the veteran warrior of fifty campaigns
does over the raw bumpkin of yesterday; and what he cannot force
those tyros to do by bullying, he will exact from them that sort of
willing obedience which the more unsophisticated in every calling
are ready to pay to those distinguished therein.</p>
<p>"The old thieves are besides actually more <i>trustworthy</i>
than the young, as, seeing the die is cast with them, and that it
is only by adhering to those who have power, they can hope to
improve their condition, they deem it best to adopt at last the
hackneyed motto, 'Honesty is the best policy;' and while making the
best overseers and constables, they also usually make the most
trusty servants; for although they may rob you themselves they take
special care that nobody else shall; whereas the young thieves are
constantly made the dupes of their elders. They have a sort of
spurious law among themselves, the most important article of which
is 'never steal yourself when you can persuade another to steal for
you;' the young thieves are as generally found to be the
<i>perpetrators</i> as the old thieves are to be the
<i>planners</i> of robbery. It is a good booty alone that will make
a cunning old rogue <i>crook his finger;</i> whereas the sprightly
young bantam will peck at every barleycorn which his senior points
out.</p>
<p>"A man being estimated in this kind of society according to the
amount and adroitness of his villanies, it is no wonder that the
yet 'mute inglorious' Barringtons of the day should crown
themselves occasionally with the bays appertaining to other brows,
or boast of robberies committed only in their imagination, in order
to elevate themselves to something like a par with more dignified
culprits. Almost all their conversation is of the larcenous
kind&mdash;consisting of details of their various robberies, and
the singular adventures they have passed through; but generally one
half of these are either sheer invention, or dressed up in such a
way as to show off in the most flattering point of view before the
eyes of their associates. A raw yokel (countryman) was once
complained of to me by one of his messmates for robbing him of a
dollar, which a rogue in an adjoining berth saw him purloin, it
being stated at the time that this aspirant had been making his
boast among his associates of being such an expert thief that he
would be able to live like a gentleman when he reached Botany Bay,
by his dexterity in the <i>cross-trade.</i> On taking the boaster
to task he stoutly denied the robbery, protesting he had never
committed a crime but the one he was convicted of, and that he was
determined never to commit another. When I reminded him of his
bravadoes, 'Oh, Sir,' said he, 'we boast of many robberies that we
never committed, for if we could not say we had committed as many
as those <i>townies</i> (Londoners) they would look upon us with
contempt.' The cat-o'-nine-tail scars upon the backs of some of
these doughty heroes are often vaunted of with the same sort of
pride that an old campaigner will display when pointing to his
Waterloo medal; while, being dignified with the titles borne by
other 'great captains of the age,' no wonder they are proud. I had
the honour of conducting out Blucher on my first voyage, and
Bonaparte on my second&mdash;the one being as expert a burglar as
ever handled a jemmy, while the other in the science of
pocket-picking might have vied even with Barrington himself.</p>
<p>"Many by picking up a little information foist themselves upon
the others as men of some note, but sooner or later they are found
out, stripped of their Jackdaw plumage, and singled for the
remainder of the voyage as the butts of the satirical society
around them.</p>
<p>"A pretender of this description had during half the passage
imposed himself upon his associates as a <i>true man,</i> till one
who suspected the fellow stole his bag from under his head one
night by way of a test&mdash;when his loud shouts for the sentry
<i>to secure the marauder</i> raised such a peal of laughter
against him, that the shallow rogue soon perceived the trap he had
fallen into! In one of the slang journals of the period, which I
afterwards perused, the writer, in relating the above circumstance,
ended with this significant remark&mdash;'We were all deceived in
Toby!' nothing, in fact, being a surer sign of <i>true game,</i>
than raising a <i>squeak</i> about any theft whatever. Another
false magician, who had long imposed upon the gang, forfeited his
reputation by pilfering nearly the whole of the tea belonging to
the sick, and wearing <i>evident signs of guilt</i> in his
countenance next morning.</p>
<p>"The fellow that attempts to humbug the rest by pretensions to
honesty had better hang himself at once. He is esteemed if he can
impose thus upon the officers of the ship; but to attempt to foist
himself off upon his comrades is an offence never passed over by
them. The best way, in fact, for a fellow of small note in the
larcenous line to maintain a sort of respectable footing, is to
keep strictly his own counsel, when he may acquire the reputation
of being a 'deep file' without having the smallest pretensions
thereto."</p>
<p>Mr. Cunningham then proceeds further to illustrate the
characters and describe the conduct of the men on board. He
says:&mdash;The perfect command of countenance and profound tact
which the higher graduates display when accused of offences baffle
description. They have at times almost persuaded him that he was
mistaken in things which he had actually seen them doing. They
would manifest the deepest sorrow or the utmost astonishment at
being accused, and yet would laugh to their comrades over the ease
with which they had 'gammoned' the overseer. If they suspected any
one of 'mosing' (informing) they would conceal some of their own
things in his bag, complain of their loss and tell their
suspicions, and upon successful search being made would hold up
their comrade as unworthy of credit in the future. But the most
common method of treating a suspected informer was to visit him
with every petty annoyance&mdash;spitting when passing to windward
of him; taking advantage of a roll of the ship to stamp, as if by
accident, on his feet; or tumbling against him to give him a
break-neck fall upon the deck: and, if all these were not
sufficient, muffling him in a blanket and beating him, when it
could be conveniently done without detection. A gang of such
desperadoes once attempted to bite off the nose and ears of one
poor fellow who had merely complained of their annoyances. As it
was after dark that most of the mischief ensued a check upon
assaults and plundering was devised in the shape of a lamp kept
burning in the prison during the night, with sentries over it, and
ordering that not a word should be uttered after 10 o'clock. It was
Mr. Cunningham's plan to select all the influential rogues among
the host on board, tell them what sort of character he had with
them, and that he had determined to keep them in double irons
during the voyage, but was willing to give them a trial, although
if any outrage occurred on board he would hold them responsible
until the real delinquent was discovered. This rule he found to
operate beneficially. He encouraged all sorts of frolic among the
convicts, holding that it was better that a little devilry should
be allowed to spout out of them now and then than that they should
nurse it until it burst forth <i>en masse</i> at the end of the
voyage. Thus some of the <i>literary</i> characters wrote slang
journals of proceedings during the passage; while sometimes plays
were enacted, with a screen of blankets for a drop scene, remnants
of stolen toggery as wardrobes, and soot, chalk, red paint, and
flake white being used to polish off the complexion. 'Sometimes,
too,' says he, 'they hold regular old Bailey sessions, and try
individuals in exquisite mock-heroic style. A friend of mine, who
had the heavy charge of 372, happening to be a little
short-sighted, glided disrespectfully one day into the very middle
of the court, with his hat on; and no doubt felt most awkward on
finding himself in such offensive trim in the awful presence of the
Chief Justice of England, perched upon a three-legged stool, with a
bed under him for a cushion, a patch-work quilt around him for a
robe, and a huge swab combed over his dignified head and shoulders
in lieu of a wig. Barristers, with blankets around them for gowns,
pleaded eloquently the causes they were engaged in, brow-beating
and cross-questioning the witnesses according to the best-laid-down
rules, and chicanery of law; while the culprit stood quaking in the
dock surrounded by the traps of office, awed by the terrific frowns
which the indignant judge every now and then cast upon him, when
the evidence bore hard upon the case.</p>
<p>"Towards the conclusion of my first voyage I desired one of the
scribes on board to make out an alphabetical list of the names,
trades, and various particulars of the other convicts; when he came
to me afterwards in a doubtful mood scratching his head, and
observing, 'When I asked what their trades are all the answer I can
get from three-fourths of them is, 'A thief, a thief;' shall I put
these down as labourers, sir?'"</p>
<p>As an evidence of the care taken to conceal the name of their
family, and the excuses they sometimes made to their friends for
their sudden departure from the country, Mr. Cunningham says that
his hospital-man wrote thus to his mother&mdash;"You will be
rejoiced to hear that I am in a good position at last, after all
the pain my misconduct has given you, which shall never be the case
again, I have been appointed to the lucrative position of doctor's
mate of the Recovery East Indiaman, now bound on a voyage to that
country; and as it is my intention to settle in one of the distant
colonies, you need not expect me in England for many years to
come!" He says that the Irish convicts were more happy and
contented than the English, and sent most amusing letters to their
friends declaring that they were never better off in their lives,
and laying particular stress on the important fact that each of
them had a blanket and bed "to his own self entirely." On account
of the glowing descriptions sent home by some of these men to their
criminal friends not a few of the latter courted transportation to
a country where prosperity was so easily won. "The only real signs
of religion among convicts I ever saw," he continues, "were amongst
a portion of the Catholics on board; for as soon as they had
mustered down, both hatchways were crowded round with them counting
their beads and fervently crossing themselves and repeating their
prayers from the book."</p>
<p>The English convicts divided themselves into the two great
classes of townies and yokels, while the Irish divided themselves
into three&mdash;the "Cork boys," the "Dublin boys," and the "North
boys," the latter being commonly called Scotchmen by the others,
and many speaking the Scotch dialect so broadly as to almost puzzle
even a Scotchmen to unravel it. The hypocricy of the more advanced
criminals, who sought by devoutness under the eye of the officials
to win favour, was most marked, and the keenest men have been
"taken in" by them until an internal quarrel led to a disclosure of
the interested mockery indulged in. On his first voyage he could
only find one rogue at first in the batch of a hundred and
eighty-eight, all but that one declaring their innocence of the
crime for which they had been convicted; but as the voyage
progressed they began to open upon each other, and he confessed
that before the end of the voyage he had discovered that no juries
had ever made fewer mistakes. Designations of individual character
had among the convict on board a very different meaning to that
attached thereto in lowest society. A good fellow was one who
divided fairly with his companion whatever he thieved in
partnership, and who never confessed a theft or gave evidence
against an associate. A clever fellow was a bang-up, bold,
thorough-going knave, an able "actor of all work;" while a great
scoundrel was one who acknowledged his crime or informed upon his
partner. One of the convicts on board was a yokel in the last
stages of consumption, and when the vessel was anchored at Sydney
no time was lost in conveying him ashore, he being so weak that he
could not sit up without fainting: yet in this pitiable state,
supporting himself round the hospital-man's neck, while the latter
was drawing on his trousers for him, the expiring wretch mustered
strength enough to stretch out his pale trembling hand towards the
other's waistcoat pocket, and pick it of a pocket-comb and
penknife. The ruling passion was strong in death, for next morning
the man was a corpse.</p>
<p>"Transportation," says Mr. Cunningham, "was formerly no
punishment to those who had friends in the colony, or money to
procure them, such individuals being soon applied for by their
gratuitous or purchased acquaintances, who, though nominally their
masters, left them in a manner at liberty to do as they liked.
Several who went with me were so metamorphosed in a few days after
they landed that in their white top boots and fancy vestments, I
had some difficulty in recognising my old shipmates. While walking
in the vicinity of Sydney in 1822, I encountered a genteel-dressed
man leading a pretty child in one hand and swinging about a
handsome cane in the other, with a bunch of massy seals dangling at
his fob, who stared as hard at me as I did at him&mdash;each having
some recollection of the other; till at last I remembered his
working his passage home as a sailor only the year previous in the
ship wherein I had returned to England, with the view, as he had
told me, of 'lifting a legacy.' He had, in fact, 'lifted the
legacy;' been tried, convicted, and transported for it; and arrived
thus in the colony again, nearly as soon as I (although only twenty
months away) with some sixty golden guineas in his pocket, to boast
of as the reward of his short trip.</p>
<p>"Some who had friends in New South Wales doing well would in
olden times procure themselves to be transported by way of having a
free passage, in order to join them. Several went out with me on
these very terms, and among them one merry youth of two-and twenty,
whose father had been transported while he was a child in arms, and
a brother at a later period. This brother had followed the fortunes
of the father by special invitation, to assist him in the
cultivation of the farm; and the youngster I speak of was therefore
the second son induced to entitle himself to a seven-year's trip to
Botany. On our arrival the elder brother came alongside, and
introduced the younger brother and the father (who were of course
utter strangers) to each other! 'When may we expect Jim?' was the
question put immediately after the preliminary congratulations; Jim
being a cousin who had long promised the colony a speedy visit, as
I learnt from the younger brother."</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten that many of these living cargoes were
made up of women, and many boys and girls, mere children, were
included. And the fearful orgies which took place on some of the
vessels bearing female convicts cannot possibly be described. A few
extracts from contemporaneous writers will best serve to faintly
outline the ghastly transactions. "The captain and each officer,"
says Captain Bertram, writing in 1806, "enjoy the right of
selection. Thus they continue the habit of concubinage until the
convicts arrive at Sydney town. Each sailor and soldier is allowed
to attach himself to one of the females." The same writer tells us
that should any of the women refuse to be "selected," consent was
won by scourging, and the lash was applied without unnecessary
ceremony. One of the vessels brought out as many as 226 women, and
the voyage extended over fifteen months! The record does not say
whether the delay was caused by foul weather or by still more foul
proceedings on the part of the soldiers and sailors who were
supposed to work the ship.</p>
<p>"Every convict ship." writes one early historian, "carries out a
herd of females of all ages, and of every gradation in vice, from
the veriest troll to the fine madam who displayed her attractions
in the theatres. All who can, carry with them the whole
paraphernalia of the toilet, with trunks and boxes stuffed with
every kind of female dress and decoration that they can come at."
The women had freedom at fixed periods of the day on deck, and
mixed indiscriminately in their "boxes" during the rest of the
time, the more accomplished in vice bending their whole energies to
the work of destroying whatever remains of modesty and womanliness
their younger and more innocent companions may have possessed. Of
the more abandoned portion of the women, this writer
says:&mdash;"Their language, disgusting even when heard by
profligate men, would pollute the eyes cast upon it in writing.
Their open and shameless vices must not be told. Their fierce and
untameable audacity would not be believed.. .. Were the veil
raised, and the appalling spectacle exhibited as it really is, the
picture would be too horrid for affrighted humanity to look upon."
These were not the women who felt the shame and the horror of the
situation to which they had been doomed; but the poor creatures
whose offences had been slight, who had been torn away from
respectable surroundings, and who could lay claim to greater
sensitiveness than some high-born ladies. There were many of these
amongst the female convicts&mdash;poor girls, whose poverty may
have driven them to commit some petty theft; and upon these the
voyage out served either as a means to absolute moral degradation
or as an instrument of death.</p>
<p>Some of the female convicts on the voyage out were subjected to
most brutal treatment. Here is an extract concerning one of the
transport vessels, "The Friendship" which came out in 1818, having
101 female convicts on board, 19 free passengers, and 65 children.
"On the 22nd September at night the ship anchored on the coast of
Africa, and the next morning the cable parted from the anchor, and
the ship was in great danger of being driven upon the breakers,
which were very nigh. On the 15th October the "Friendship" arrived
at St. Helena, where she remained for one week. From the 12th July
to 15th October, there had been no means used by the master and
surgeon to prevent an improper intercourse between the sailors and
the female convicts; all were at full liberty to act in this
respect as their inclinations led them; this caused universal
insubordination and confusion in the ship. On the 14th January
after along, tedious, and painful passage, the Friendship arrived
at Port Jackson. The conduct of the surgeon and master during the
whole passage was very bad; they seldom spoke to any of the
convicts without oaths, their treatment of the convicts and others
was truly distressing; little or no attention was paid to
cleanliness, no vice restrained, excepting in the latter part of
the voyage. On our arrival at St. Helena the names of the female
convicts were called over, and from that time they were locked down
at night between decks. The passengers and convicts suffered much
from want of water, though there was plenty on board. The quantity
allowed to a grown person was about three pints for the 24 hours,
for all purposes of cooking, &amp;c., and half that quantity for a
child under 13 years old. This quantity was not more than half
enough in the hot weather, and the children suffered very much on
this account. The canisters of fresh meat, of veal, mutton and
beef, were eaten principally at the captain's table, and the offals
sent to the sick prisoners in lieu. From the whole the prisoners
and passengers suffered greatly from the unfeeling conduct of the
master and surgeon, who are both very profane men, possessed of
little humanity."</p>
<p>This was the report of a passenger, John Gyles, Missionary to
the South Seas. One of the women on this ship, named Jane Brown,
met an untimely death through the severity of the captain. She had
a quarrel with one of her fellow-prisoners, and was selected by the
Captain for punishment, the other offender being let off. She told
the captain and surgeon that if she was punished she would throw
herself into the sea. A wooden collar was put about her neck, which
she wore the whole of that day; but in the night she got the collar
off. Next day the captain observed this, and after tearing her
bonnet and shawl off, with many oaths, said he would put another
collar on. The woman repeated that she would throw herself
overboard if he did. He ordered the collar and advanced towards
her, when she at once jumped over and was drowned. This happened
off the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p>A resident of the colony in 1818 furnishes the following
account:&mdash;"Two or three years ago a ship arrived with female
convicts, and many of them, according to custom, were sent up to
Parramatta, where I reside. On my first interview with them they
informed me how they had been treated on board. I selected two of
the women as domestic servants for my own family. Both of these
women had received a superior education. The offence for which one
of them had been transported was small in a moral, though great in
a political sense; she assisted a prisoner of war, an officer of
rank in the French navy, to make his escape, though he was
apprehended afterwards. This woman lived in my family until she was
married, and has now a good name of her own. She was strictly
honest and well behaved at all times. The other woman is married
also. These women informed me, as well as others of their
shipmates, that they were subject to every insult from the master
of the ship, and the sailors; that the master stript several of
them and publicly whipped them; that the master beat one of the
women that lived with me with a rope with his own hands till she
was bruised in her arms, breasts, and other parts of her body. I am
certain, from her general good conduct since she arrived to the
present day, she could not have merited any cruelty from him. They
further stated that they were almost famished for want of water. In
addition to the insults they were subject to on board, the youngest
and handsomest of the women were selected from the other convicts
and sent on board, by order of the master, the King's ships which
were at that time in the fleet, for the vilest purpose; both of my
servants were of that number. One of them told me that when in bed
she received an order from the captain to come on deck, which order
she was obliged to obey, when she was put into a boat with others
and sent off to the King's ships. This was not the only time they
were sent during the passage. They further informed me that they
were promised &pound;30, but none of which was received; and it was also
said that rope and canvas had been given as the wages of
iniquity.</p>
<p>The ship for the women convicts was fitted up in the same way as
for the men, excepting the addition of tables and shelves upon
which to iron their clothes and stow away their tea-ware. No guard
of soldiers was required, and consequently there was no bulk-head
across the upper deck in midships. Their rations were the same as
those served to the men, with the addition of tea and sugar, for
the service of which a kettle was supplied to each mess and a
tin-pot to each female, tea being usually made each night and
morning. Cunningham used to allow them to draw their oatmeal as
they required it, and they would take their gruel for supper with
the utmost relish, while they would turn up their genteel noses at
the same mess, formerly cooked for them under the vulgar
sea-epithet of bargou&mdash;so much was there in the magic of a
name. More accommodation was generally allowed for the women than
for the men, the usual number of convict-women proceeding out in
one vessel seldom exceeding ninety. A separate compartment was
usually fitted up in the ship in the later voyages for the
accommodation of the free women (with their children), coming out
to join their husbands who were convicts in the colony&mdash;a
certain number being annually forwarded in this way by the
Government to those husbands who behaved well and could support
them. A similar mode of management was adopted with the women as
with the men, a certain number of respectable old matrons from
Magdalen Asylums and <i>venerable pave</i> peripatetics being
appointed to superintend the manners and morals of their sisters
during the voyage, and to see the prison kept in tidy trim, none
except influentials of this description being capable of managing
the unruly throng.</p>
<p>The women were more quarrelsome and more difficult to control
than the men, their tempers being more excitable, and a good deal
being calculated on by them in respect to the usual leniency shewn
their sex. They were more abandoned in their expressions, too, when
excited; but this, adds Cunningham, probably arose not so much from
greater profligacy of disposition as from their having less control
over their passions and their tongues. In the earlier voyages they
lived promiscuously with the seamen on the passage out, and the
voyage was certainly then brought to a close much more harmoniously
than later, for the outward rules of decency were not grossly
outraged in the intercourse. Speaking of this matter Cunningham
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"All reformations to be lasting must be gradual, for whatever is
suddenly done is liable to be as suddenly undone; and by bridling
in their long-indulged inclinations by sheer brute force, you
produce no moral regeneration, but rather engender an accumulation
of vice which will break out with overwhelming impetus when
restraint is taken off. By being suffered to live in concubinage
with the sailors during the voyage, they became initiated in the
moral principle of moral attachment, unknown to them before. The
great evil of such an arrangement was, that the sailors often
married them at the end of the voyage; when Jack, as soon as tired
of the 'happy state,' would take to ship again, and leave his
spouse to the exercise of her own free will and meditations, while
the number of females transported being so few, in comparison to
the men, the former ought certainly to be made <i>preserves</i> of,
to furnish wives for the latter. The truly pitiable surgeon who has
hitherto endeavoured strictly to enforce the orders of the navy
board on this head during the voyage (to keep the females separate)
has certainly most justly entitled himself to the full honour of
Catholic canonization on his landing. And as regards the crew
themselves, really poor Jack is planted in a perfect garden of
temptation, when among probably a hundred of such fair seducers,
and is more an object of pity than wrath. To see twenty wicked
fingers beckoning to him, and twenty wicked eyes winking at him, at
one and the same time, no wonder his virtue should sometimes
experience a fall. A very ingenious plan, however, (persevered in
from the commencement of the interdictory system until reported to
the navy board) afforded free scope to these amorous flirtations.
The swains first gained over the Arguses in charge of the hospital;
forced up the piece of board nailed over the coal-hatch, which
being under a bed-place was completely hidden from view; then,
entering the prison, 'puffed out the rush light,' and continued
their tete-a-tete with the 'fair penitents' until the inquisitive
eye of day began to blink in upon them."</p>
<p>The female convicts were generally on the best of terms with
each other, and in speaking of each other they invariably made use
of the term <i>ladies,</i> which they did more in sober earnest
than in jest; and whenever the 'frail body' was summoned to attend
for their rations, the call was "Ladies, come up for your biscuit;
ladies, come up for your pork; ladies, the puddings are ready," and
so forth; yet, while affecting this gentility as a body, when
particularising each other it was plain Poll, Kate, or Sall.
Dancing was allowed several times a week in the evenings throughout
the voyage and singing was kept up every night for an hour or two
before bedtime, while occasionally concerts and masquerades were
allowed, at which latter, dressed out in their gayest plumage, they
would prolong the frolic till bedtime. Some of the cabin passengers
would now and again go down into the prison to listen to the
singing, which was charming in its variety if in nothing else.</p>
<p>Among the ancient dames sent out was one described by Cunningham
as a most trustworthy creature, who abominated a lie so thoroughly
that all the others were afraid to commit any misdeed in her
presence, knowing old Nanny would disclose instantly the "whole
truth and nothing but the truth" if questioned. She was 70 years of
age, and had spent forty years of her life in houses of correction
and prison. The man with whom she had lived, and whose name she
bore, was the last hung in chains on Pennenden Heath, for highway
robbery. She was a noted London thief and delighted in narrating
how successfully she had "done" an hospital physician in London.
Being ill with a cough and wheezing, she proceeded with a letter of
admission to the hospital, when the examining physician, having
looked at her tongue and felt her pulse, was called momentarily
away, leaving the gold watch he had been counting the pulse with
upon the table. The sight of such a gem ticking at a tempting
distance before her, made Nanny's very finger ends tingle, and
operated upon her wheezing like a dose of the 'Gilead'&mdash;so,
hastily snatching it up, she glided with light and nimble foot out
of the door, and had a <i>thimble of ruin</i> on credit of her
prize in ten minutes after the "trump had turned up."</p>
<p>As a body, the women were not given to pretensions to
devoutness, like the men. The Bibles with which the females were
supplied were taken good care of during the voyage; but as they
knew that these would be mustered at the end of the voyage, this
consciousness might have had some effect, for the greater portion
of the religious tracts which were promiscuously distributed
disappeared; and in what way, was satisfactorily demonstrated by
shreds of them being picked up after a <i>coterie of these nymphs
had been unpapering their curls.</i></p>
<p>Under the best regulations and the most favoured circumstances,
each voyage had its horrors, the passage from start to finish being
associated with misery and wretchedness, if not attended with
death. How many of those who left the shores of England for the new
land during the fifty years the voyages continued will never be
known. Only the sharks who fattened on the spoils kept count, and
they have never yet revealed the secret.</p>
<p>The greatest mortality amongst the convicts occurred on the
voyage of the Second Fleet, which was formed of ten transports. On
board these ten vessels there had been embarked in England 1,695
male and 68 female prisoners, of whom no fewer than 194 males and
four females died on the passage out; and such was the state of
debility in which the survivors landed in the colony, that 114
males and two females died in the colonial Hospital within six
months of their landing. Of 122 male convicts also, who had arrived
per "The Queen," from Ireland, in the year 1791, there were only
fifty alive in the month of May, 1793, and their death was looked
upon as a positive blessing to the colony, which was then in a
state of absolute starvation. Referring to this matter, Colonel
Collins wrote:&mdash;"Had not such numbers died, both on the
passage and since the landing of those who survived the voyage, we
should not at this moment have had anything to receive from the
public stores; thus strangely did we derive a benefit from the
miseries of our fellow creatures."</p>
<p>It is a relief to learn that the mortality in the earlier years
was great beyond all comparison with that of the later years of
transportation. For some time previous to the discontinuance of
transportation to the colony the average mortality was not greater
that two or three deaths for each vessel during the passage out;
and there were instances of vessels arriving from England without
having had a single death during the voyage. I have already stated
that the mortality in great measure was due to the greed of the
ship-owners who had contracted with the British Government to carry
out the convicts at so much per head; and great abuses were
practised as long as this system of transportation was continued.
It was clearly shewn at an inquiry instituted in the colony at the
suggestion of Captain Parker, of H.M.S. Gorgon, that many of the
convicts had been literally starved to death in the holds of the
transports, the captains having cut short the allowance stipulated
by Government for their sustenance, in order to save expense, the
accumulation of a few sixpences being of far greater importance in
their eyes than the lives of a great many convicts. At this period
the shipowners received &pound;17/7/6 for each convict embarked, and the
greater the number that died the greater the profits made by them
out of the voyage. In 1816 a Parliamentary return was printed by
order of the House of Commons, containing an "Account of the Number
of Convicts who have died on their passage to New South Wales since
the year 1810." From this return it appeared that of 19 ships, on
board of which 3,379 convicts had been embarked, there was one ship
only in which no death had occurred during the voyage; four in
which the deaths were one in each; five in which the deaths were
two in each; two in which there were in each three deaths: three in
which there had been four deaths; one in which there had been five;
one in which there had been ten; one in which there had been
thirty-four deaths out of three hundred convicts; and one, The
Surrey, in which there had been as many as thirty-six deaths out of
two hundred convicts. In the last-named vessel a malignant fever
had prevailed during the passage, and the captain, first and second
officers, and several of the crew found a common grave in the sea
with the convicts who had fallen victims to the bad treatment of
their custodians.</p>

FEMALE CONVICTS&mdash;ON THE MARCH&mdash;THE DEARTH OF
FEMALES&mdash;THEIR DISTRIBUTION&mdash;A PECULIAR DOCTRINE.</p>
<p>AS soon as the convict vessel reached its place of destination,
a report was made by the surgeon-superintendent to the Governor,
who appointed a day for the Colonial Secretary, or his deputy, to
go on board to muster the convicts and hear their complaints, if
they had any to make. Each of the men was then asked his name, the
time and place of his trial, his sentence, native place, and trade
or occupation. His exact height was then taken and carefully
registered, with a general description for identification at any
future time&mdash;the colour of his eyes, hair, complexion, and any
marks upon his body being carefully set down. Inquiries were next
made concerning his conduct during the voyage, and other
information sought in order that the nature of the employment for
which he was best fitted could be determined. A day was then
appointed for the debarkation of the convicts, and at the time
fixed they were all supplied with new clothing, landed, and marched
to the gaol yard, where they were drawn up in line for the
Governor's inspection, his Excellency being attended on such
occasions by the captain of the transports, the
surgeon-superintendent, the chief-engineer, and the superintendent
of convicts. The latter, when all was ready, read out from a list
previously prepared the destination of each man&mdash;if to the use
of the Government, to which department; and if to private
assignment, to whose service. Cases have been known of prisoners
being allowed to go at large immediately upon arrival, the
influence of friends in England having operated upon the officers
of Justice at the Antipodes. It was in the gaol yard that the
convicts went through the process of "branding," all their clothes
being daubed over with P.B.'s and broad arrows, in black and red
paint.</p>
<p>The work of inspection being finished, the Governor usually
addressed the prisoners, urging them to embrace the opportunities
for reform placed within their reach in this new country. Governors
Macquarie and Bourke, next to Phillip, appear to have taken more
interest in this work than any of the others, and they were careful
to impress upon the minds of the convicts the fact that in their
new sphere the past would be forgotten, and that they had their
future in their own hands; but they were also plainly told that
only by good behaviour could they win indulgence or secure any
mitigation of their sentences. The prisoners were then marched off,
in charge of constables, to enter upon the duties which were either
to make them or spoil them for the remainder of their lives. Those
who were destined for service in the interior were usually sent by
water to Parramatta, and thence sent on to the districts in which
resided the masters who had applied for their services, being
temporarily lodged in the gaols of the settlements through which
they had to pass <i>enroute</i>. The remainder were either retained
by the Government or sent to the penal settlements.</p>
<p>In the earlier day the supply of convicts so much exceeded the
demand in the colony for their services by the few settlers, that
the Government used to grant certain indulgences to those settlers
who were willing to maintain convicts. Subsequently the demand
exceeded the supply, and the obtaining convict laborers became a
matter of favours, abuses in the distribution causing not a few
complaints from those who were less influential "at court" than
their fellows.</p>
<p>Upon the arrival of a transport general orders were issued for
returns of the number of men wanted, with the land held in
cultivation by each settler applying for convicts to be assigned to
them; but there was nothing like fairness in the distribution at
any time. The artificers were in general reserved for the service
of the Government, with as many of the others as might be wanted.
Persons who had been in a higher situation in life had
tickets-of-leave granted to them at once, by which they were at
liberty to provide for themselves, and were exempt from all
compulsory labour. Similar tickets were given to men unused to
active employment, such as goldsmiths and others; the remainder
were distributed amongst the settlers as servants and
labourers.</p>
<p>The convicts retained in the service of the Government were
divided into gangs. Every gang had an overseer, and every two or
three gangs a superintendent, these being generally chosen from the
best conducted of the convicts themselves. The regulations were
that they should work from 6 in the morning till 3 in the
afternoon, the remainder of the day being allowed to them for
amusement or profitable labour for themselves; but there was
greater breach than observance of this rule on the outer gangs.
Great suffering was caused on two or three occasions through the
absence of food and clothing, the authorities having neglected to
send a full supply, and the poor wretches had to put up with empty
stomachs and bare backs, feeling content if but allowed to keep a
whole skin on the latter.</p>
<p>If they misconducted themselves at work the convicts were
supposed to be taken before a magistrate, no superintendent having
power to personally inflict punishment. The sitting magistrate for
the week in Sydney could order a punishment of 25 lashes, but a
regular Bench, which consisted of at least three, could order as
many as 300. In the outer settlements during the "teens" of the
colony a single magistrate had the same power as the full Bench at
Sydney; but the Governor was always <i>supposed</i> to know and
approve before any extra heavy punishment was inflicted.</p>
<p>The gaol gangs had to work in irons on some public work, their
hours being from 6 in the morning till 6 at night, and the rest of
the time locked up.</p>
<p>The convicts distributed amongst the settlers were clothed,
supported and lodged by them, and their manner and hours of work
were diversified. The master had no power of corporal punishment
over his assigned servant: even though he were a magistrate he was
forced to apply to some other magistrate to order punishment. But
in those days magistrates were very accommodating. It wasn't a case
of "You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours;" but "You order 100
for my servant's back and I'll order 100 for yours." The Select
Committee in 1812 recommended a large extension of the assignment
system, rightly judging that life on a farm, or with a family, was
far more likely to lead to reformation than life in the gangs of
Sydney. But life under the rule of a private master did not always
turn out to be all "beer and skittles," as will be seen further on.
Some of the benefits of the "family" system, which the Committee
were disposed to think resulted from assignment were, however, lost
in cases of men of large influence with large farms, obtained as
grants, for one man has been known to have had as many as eighty
convicts assigned to him, and thus under his control. And the
reader will not forget that for many years the Government supplied,
not only the land and labour without cost to the recipient, but the
means of working the one and clothing the other, also free of cost.
But this part of the subject will be more fully treated when the
Assignment system is being dealt with in subsequent chapters.</p>
<p>The female convicts, in the earlier days, were marched from the
ship to the penitentiaries, but, later on, arrangements were made
by which they could proceed at once from the ship to private
service. As early as 1819 it was the custom for an advertisement to
be inserted in the Sydney Gazette, the only paper published at that
time, intimating that a certain ship with female convicts had
arrived, and that married men or householders requiring domestic
servants could attend on a certain day and "take their choice."</p>
<p>In the later batches the women, after being mustered on board,
at the termination of the voyage, were sent up by water to the
Parramatta factory and assigned to service by the Council, every
encouragement being given to marriage. Writing on this subject
Cunningham says:&mdash;"Mewing these veterans in vice up in a
factory when such a disparity of sexes exists among us (this was in
1824, when the female did not amount to one eighth of the male
population) not only tends to materially affect the advancement of
population in our young community, but gives rise to the most
abominable crimes, while manifestly tending to the seduction and
prostitution of our young colonial females, who may be justly said
to be sacrificed to the fanciful speculation of preserving an ideal
morality among our depraved English importations.. .. .. The
love-matches among this portion of our population certainly often
savour not a little of the romance of olden time. Not a few of our
factory fair have been wooed and won by a sort of telegraphic
courtship, carried on by means of hand and handkerchief signals
from a commanding eminence over-looking the domicile of these
nymphs, the most puzzling point for the love-born swain being that
of finding out the name of his pledged bride, in order to obtain
her release from the police bench for the consummation of their
nuptials. Not a few happy matches have resulted, too, from the
tender attachments formed within the love-inspiring walls of the
lock-up house; nay, it is even asserted that such have taken place
when the sentimental couple were in course of initiating
'revolutionary principles' at Cubit's <i>peripatetic</i> seminary
(tread-mill). A twelve-month scarce has passed, indeed, since a
rich and amorous Sydney youth, with the bloom of fifty-six summers
on his checks, was linked in love's dear bands with one of our
pretty penitents, from whose eyes he first drank in the sweet
infection while his 'fairest of the fair' was performing penance in
the public stocks on a market-day (with her gown-tail drawn over
her head), for dabbling too deeply in strong waters on the previous
evening."</p>
<p>At this time, owing to the dearth of women, there was always an
eager competition among lowly swains for every vacant hand that
presented itself. It is said that widows were scarcely permitted to
give their mourning weeds a second day's sunning before they were
again entangled in another matrimonial web. There is a record
bearing on this point. A buxom washerwoman hurriedly begged
audience of her master one evening and solicited an advance of two
dollars to enable her to get married in the morning. "Married!"
exclaimed the master; "why, you told me only three days ago that
you had a husband in England." "So I did, sir," sighed the fair,
"but I have received a letter since acquainting me that he has
suffered." <i>"Suffered!"</i> re-echoed the master, dropping his
voice in tenderness, "dear me, what has he suffered?" "He has been
<i>hanged,</i> sir," whimpered the petitioner; and clinking the
dollars into her pocket, she tripped out of doors to solace her
widowed heart with the joys of a second husband.</p>
<p>In the distribution of the female convicts great abuses
prevailed for many years. The women were indiscriminately given to
such of the inhabitants as demanded them, and were received rather
as prostitutes than as servants; and so far from being induced to
reform themselves, the disgraceful manner in which they were
disposed of operated as an encouragement to general depravity of
manners.</p>
<p>Upon the arrival of Governor Bligh it was shewn that two-thirds
of the children annually born within the colony were illegitimate;
but after the first twenty years the report was that marriages were
becoming more frequent, and prostitution less prevalent. Governor
Macquarie received orders from the Home Government "to keep the
female convicts separate till they can be properly distributed
among the inhabitants, in such manner as they may best derive the
advantages of industry and good character."</p>
<p>In 1810 Governor Macquarie recommended that as many male
convicts should be sent out as possible, as the prosperity of the
country largely depended on their numbers; while, on the contrary,
female convicts were as great a draw-back as the others were
beneficial. But the Select Committee of the House of Commons could
not see this, and reported as follows:&mdash;"They are aware that
the women sent out are of the most abandoned description, and that
in many instances they are likely to whet and encourage the vices
of the men, whilst but a small proportion will make any step
towards reformation; but yet, with all their vices, such women as
these were the <i>mothers of a great part of the inhabitants now
existing in the colony, and from this stock only can a reasonable
hope be held out of rapid increase to the population;</i> upon
which increase, here, as in all infant colonies, its growing
prosperity in great measure depends. Let it be remembered, too, how
much misery and vice are likely to prevail in a society in which
the women bear no proportion to the men. In the colony at present
the number of men compared to that of women is as 2 to 1; to this,
in great measure, the prevalence of prostitution is reasonably to
be attributed; but increase that proportion, and the temptation to
abandoned vices will also be increased, and the hopes of
establishing feelings of decency and morality amongst the lower
classes will be still further removed. The supply of women to the
colony must, however, be naturally diminished by the proposed
system of employing convicts in Penitentiary Houses; and your
Committee think this an additional reason for affording increased
facilities to the wives of male convicts, who may wish to accompany
or follow their husbands to New South Wales. This permission is now
seldom granted, and that only to the wives of men transported for
life or for 14 years. It is, however, the most eligible way of
providing the colony with women, and one which may with very great
advantage be extended."</p>
<p>In this last particular the committee took a wise view of the
situation, and not a few substantial families&mdash;substantial in
more than one sense&mdash;were afterwards built up from the
re-union of man and wife, the latter as a free woman being "sent
for," and having come, secured the husband as an "assigned
servant." Queer conditions of family life, certainly; but better
that, for both husband and wife and children, than no family life
at all! I must refrain from even a passing remark upon the idea of
the Committee of building up prosperity by the "rapid increase of
population," the mothers being "women of the most abandoned
description," sent out from England as irreclaimable. In the
present day the idea appears so outrageous in its novelty that the
bare thought of it almost takes one's breath away, and he is afraid
to search for illustrations shewing the operation of the scheme.
England's loss in this case was certainly not gain to New South
Wales.</p>

"LEASING" SYSTEM&mdash;FORAGING EXPEDITIONS&mdash;SETTLER
CONVICTS&mdash;MR. BIGGS' REPORT&mdash;GOVERNOR BOURKE'S
AMENDMENTS&mdash;FULL REGULATIONS&mdash;FREE USE OF THE LASH.</p>
<p>THE assignment system, under which convicts were distributed
amongst the free or freed population, was established at an early
date, during Governor Hunter's administration, and it was not long
before the prisoners generally understood that assignment to
private persons was a much preferable fate to being retained by
Government or sent to public labour.</p>
<p>The system was brought to its highest point of development
during Governor Macquarie's reign, that gentleman having bent his
energies to the wide distribution of the population, bond as well
as free, through the country which was then so rapidly being opened
up for settlement. The newly-arrived prisoners had not been many
hours within the Sydney Heads before they knew that there was a
choice open for them, and they shaped their conduct accordingly. A
sort of freemasonry appeared to exist between convicts of a certain
"school," and the new arrivals from the parent establishment
sixteen thousand miles away were soon discovered by former
graduates who had crossed the sea before them and become "located"
in the new land. The general means of communication between the
shore and the convict ships was through the Government boat's
crews, who were themselves servants assigned to one or other of the
harbour officials; and these men acted the part of "telegraphs"
between new arrivals and any acquaintances they might have on
shore, so that wives who had just come out could communicate with
their husbands, or those who should have been their husbands, and
old associates were brought together. Boats manned by convicts,
either in private or public employment, hovered about a prison ship
from the time of her arrival until she had discharged the last of
her living cargo. Every effort was made to avoid being sent to
public labour, for which there was a great demand during
Macquarie's time, when stonemasons, bricklayers, carpenters, and
other mechanics were religiously "kept in government" and employed
upon the public buildings which Macquarie had such a craze for
erecting. These "telegraphs" were not slow in acquainting new
arrivals with the true state of affairs, and the result was that
they all professed ignorance of any handicraft connected with the
building art. The Government at last ordered that any prisoner who
was discovered to have concealed his trade should be severely
punished, and as the chief engineer in Sydney and the
superintendent of convicts kept a close watch upon the prisoners in
private assignment, for the purpose of discovering if they
possessed any knowledge or skill in the desired direction, many of
the mechanics were sooner or later discovered and at once removed
from the service of the master to whom they had been assigned, and
sent to swell the number of the Government gangs.</p>
<p>One writer on this subject says:&mdash;"There can be no doubt
that the want of skilled labour for private enterprise was such
that most of the free settlers and emancipist employers willingly
afforded assistance to prisoners to evade the regulations. The
great demand for skilled labour and its almost entire absorption by
the Government, were indeed productive of the worst results;
favoritism, bribery, and petty scheming were fostered; the most
bare-faced falsehood on the part of both master and servant was
frequently resorted to; and at the same time private enterprise was
checked and hampered in a most deplorable manner. It likewise often
happened that convicts who had relatives or friends in Sydney
procured themselves to be assigned to them by professing a
knowledge of the particular trade or pursuit (if not connected with
building) in which they were engaged, and in some cases even
considerable sums of money&mdash;the fruits probably of former
crimes&mdash;were paid by prisoners to influential parties to
induce them to apply for them as assigned servants. The assignment
was, of course, in such cases merely nominal; and if the
application was successful, as in fact it generally was, the
convict was thenceforth almost as free from interference and
control as if he had landed in the colony a free man.</p>
<p>"This inequality of punishment&mdash;these premiums held out to
craft and cunning&mdash;were amongst the worst features of the
transportation system. The country mechanic or labourer,
transported perhaps for some share in a poaching affray, but
comparatively innocent in heart, unsophisticated in character and
unknown to the criminal class, was generally doomed to the heaviest
toil; while the successful city swindler, forger, or pickpocket
managed, with the help of money or the assistance of former friends
or associates who had preceded him in his enforced exile, not only
to escape the just penalty of his offences, but to enter upon a new
stage of existence, where labour was better paid and life much more
easily supported than in the country from which he had been
banished. Whatever its benefits to particular convicts, or even to
the colony at large in developing its resources, the system of
private assignment was fertile in the production of plans of petty
scheming, craft, and evasion; as well as frightfully unequal in its
operation on the prisoners." The frightful inequalities here
referred to will receive full illustration before this part of the
subject has been exhausted.</p>
<p>Whether the "place" obtained by a convict was favorable to good
living or the reverse depended entirely upon the character of the
person to whom he was assigned. In distributing the prisoners among
private employers no account was taken of their rank as criminals;
a "lifer," who had been guilty of murder stood an equal chance of
an easy life with the poor wretch who had got seven years for
stealing a loaf of bread for his starving children, or the man
convicted of some political offence. Those who were acquainted with
light in-door trades, such as tailoring or shoe-making, generally
fell into comfortable quarters; they could not be employed on
public works or as farm labourers, and were as a rule applied for
by the "understrappers" in the Government service, such as
overseers, clerks, and other of the fry who assumed gentility if
they had it not. These men had no use for tailors or shoemakers in
their offices or homes, but they made money out of them,
nevertheless. They would permit the men to undertake work for
others on their own account, conditional upon the payment of a sum
ranging from 5/- upwards per week. The men either hired themselves
for wages or set up in business on their own account being always
careful, of course, to give their master the weekly sum agreed
upon; and they would gladly have paid much larger amounts for the
privilege of enjoying the freedom thus purchased. It has been
stated that in some cases convicts who were possessed of money on
their arrival, and who managed to get some suitable person to apply
for them as assigned servants, bought up the masters' interest in
their labours at once, the masters agreeing to forego all future
claims and merely exercise a nominal control over them in order to
keep up appearances. The men here referred to were looked upon with
a very jealous eye by their fellow convicts who were condemned to
heavy manual labour under Government or masters who had lands to
cultivate or buildings to erect.</p>
<p>One very bad feature of the assignment system was that
established during the days when the military were all
powerful&mdash;namely, the practice of assigning servants to
magistrates and other officers under Government in part payment of
their salaries. One magistrate would sometimes have as many as
eight convicts assigned to him in virtue of his office, quite
irrespective of the number to which he was entitled as a settler
under the regulations; and these servants were rationed exclusively
from the public store, as though they were in Government employ,
and as the magistrates or other officials were permitted to let
these "Government servants" out on hire, they were able to add to
their income to no inconsiderable extent. The ration of a single
individual was estimated at about &pound;15 per year, and as it was not
required to feed the man, who was working for wages elsewhere, it
was either sold by the master or devoted to the purpose of feeding
the other servants who had been assigned to him as a private
settler; and the money thus made or saved, added to that which the
convict paid for the privilege of hiring himself out, amounted to
about &pound;40 a year. This amount multiplied by 6 or 8, will give the
reader a pretty correct idea of the sort of salary which these
masters were enabled to draw annually. Referring to this practice,
and the incentives to crime which it furnished, one writer
says:&mdash;"The direct interest which a master had under such
circumstances in shielding his men from punishment for their
offences acted as a strong encouragement to crime. The prisoners
knew that if detected they had little to fear, because it was their
masters' interest that they should escape. They knew that if
flogged or imprisoned he would be the loser, and therefore felt
assured that he would exert himself to prevent it. They were also
aware that as long as they regularly brought him the weekly amount
agreed upon he would not be inclined to look too narrowly into the
means by which it was obtained." The reader will not be surprised
to learn that during the period when this practice prevailed
magistrates were amongst the largest employers of the labour
furnished by the Government.</p>
<p>But the evil was not concentrated in the magisterial office, for
the under-superintendents, overseers, and clerks in charge of
Government gangs, seventy per cent. of whom had been, or were at
the time, convicts themselves, were "salaried" in the same way.
They regularly drew the rations of the men assigned to them, which
they sold to the settlers, and allowed the men to hire themselves
out or "do for themselves," provided they handed over a fair
proportion of the money they earned or "made." This phase of the
assignment system formed the subject of high Departmental inquiry
in 1821, and a Parliamentary paper was issued containing the
following statements:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The manner in which the overseers are remunerated has appeared
to every one capable of forming a judgement of its effects to be
highly objectionable; it consists in the allowance of a ration and
a half, and the assignment of one or more convicts, who are in most
cases victualled by Government, and who in return for the exemption
that is allowed to them from all control, and the pursuit of any
occupation, engage to pay their overseer a sum amounting to five
shillings per week, if they allowed the overseer to draw their
ration, and ten shillings per week in case they draw it themselves.
The effects produced by this arrangement on the convicts at their
first distribution has already been observed, and its continuance
is no less injurious to the system of discipline than to the
parties whom it is intended to remunerate. The assigned convict
becomes in many instances responsible to a person who is in no
higher condition than himself, many of the overseers being
themselves convicts. The selection of the assigned convicts being
left principally to the overseer, it is made with reference to the
means of payment possessed by them, and not to their character or
conduct; hence it has happened that the most guilty individuals
have enjoyed all the privileges that were declared to belong
exclusively to good conduct, and that they have purchased them with
money instead of gaining them by long servitude.</p>
<p>"The majority of the assigned convicts consists of mechanics,
who are enabled by their industry to fulfil their engagement to
their overseer as long as their labour is in demand; and they are
protected from arrest by being furnished with passes signed by the
superintendent, as a special protection in the districts to which
they may resort; but if the demand for their labour or industry
should fail, or what more frequently occurs, if the profits they
may derive from it be spent in luxury and excess, the weekly
payment to the overseer falls into arrear, and he is compelled to
apply either to the magistrate for punishment, or to the principal
superintendent for the assignment of another convict; again, if the
employer of the assigned convict fails in paying his wages, the
overseer is not only a loser, but the convict is returned to the
service of Government, by which a certain amount of punishment is
inflicted upon him for the default of another."</p>
<p>In not a few cases, and especially at posts some distance from
the seat of authority, the overseers and their walking "salaries"
have been known to plot and execute foraging expeditions, under
which the moveable possessions of settlers in the bush have been
made to suddenly disappear, and bushrangers have received the
credit of the acts of plunder. The system brought forth its natural
fruit. The overseers lost both inclination and power to make the
gangs under their control do a reasonable amount of work, and it
was declared that the labour of one free man would equal that of
three of the prisoners employed on public works. Hence arose the
colonialism, "Government stroke."</p>
<p>When the assignment system was introduced the colony was in a
state bordering upon stagnation, Private enterprise was only just
beginning to manifest itself in fitful throbbings, and the number
of convicts on the hands of the Government was far greater than the
few public works then being carried on could absorb; and as the
prisoners were a source of constantly increasing trouble and
expense to the Government weighty inducements were held out to the
settlers and others to enlarge their borders and extend their
operations, the services of the convicts being placed at their
disposal without payment. The few settlers who had brought a little
capital to the colony made such rapid headway by means of the
liberal grants of land and stock made by the Government, and the
cheap labour placed at their command, that others of the same class
soon found their way over the water from England and India, and
after a time the demand for the services of the convicts began to
exceed the supply, and the order of things was reversed. The
Government had no longer to hold out inducements to the settlers to
take the convicts "off the store," but were in a position to
dictate terms and enforce regulations concerning the food, clothing
and work of the human cattle handed over to them. This was good for
the convicts, if not for the Government, for up to this time they
had been treated with the utmost harshness by the masters to whom
they had been assigned as unskilled labourers, and who used the
lash indiscriminately as the best means of extracting a larger
amount of work from those who had been handed over to them. In
January, 1804, a general order was issued by Governor King
requiring all persons who applied for convicts to sign an indenture
to clothe and maintain those who might be assigned to them for a
period of twelve months, the quantity and kind of food and clothing
being specified. In return for this they were empowered to extract
from each convict assigned to them a certain amount of work, the
hours of daily labour being fixed at ten, although if a man could
perform a specified daily task in less than ten hours he was
allowed to hire himself out for the remainder of the time, the
master having a preferential right to his extra services, if he
thought fit to pay therefor, at a rate per hour fixed by the
Government.</p>
<p>The condition of the convicts who were assigned to masters
living in remote parts of the country was in many cases little
better than that of slaves, and if the employer happened to possess
a large "estate," under the superintendence of overseers who were
themselves convicts, their position was hard in the extreme, for
these overseers were sometimes as brutal as they were unprincipled,
and being far removed from any Court of Justice they indulged their
cruel inclinations to the full, the unfortunate victims having no
means of redress or relief. Hundreds of the men who "took to the
bush," as the phrase went, did so from no other motive than to
escape from the tortures to which they were subjected at the hands
of these brutal under-masters.</p>
<p>The men who were assigned to masters of the less wealthy class
were infinitely the best off, for the master acted as his own
superintendent and lived on the farm with his family and his two or
three, or perhaps six servants. Regard for the members of his own
household impelled him to preserve among his servants something
like decency, and there was an atmosphere of decency about the
smaller farms which had no existence on the larger ones, where the
men were herded together like pigs to luxuriate in their own filth.
Under kind treatment and fairly good living many of the convicts
assigned to this middle class of settlers became reformed and
useful members of society; while, on the other hand ill-treatment
called into play all the worst passions of the men whose lives were
made a misery to them, and if they could not revenge themselves
directly upon the master they did so indirectly by instructing his
children in every kind of vice, sowing seeds in the youthful mind
which soon sprang up to bear most bitter fruit.</p>
<p>Some of the settlers who had been convicts themselves, and who
had been placed upon the land by Governor Macquarie after their
sentences had expired, proved masters of the very worst type. Many
of them were criminals of the lowest rank, and had neither means
nor inclination to work the land given to them. Being anxious to
give them full opportunity of reform the Governor lent them cattle
from the public herds, kept them in rations from the public store,
and allowed them to have one or more assigned servants as
labourers. As may be imagined, there was no improvement on the
establishments formed after such fashion. Master and servant, being
kindred spirits, fraternised in evil&mdash;living in the same hut,
eating together, and together drinking from the same rum bottle.
The rations from the store were soon exhausted, the farm was sold,
and the erstwhile "farmer" became a roving vagabond, a curse to the
district in which he lived.</p>
<p>The following extract from Commissioner Bigg's report will shew
how this sort of thing operated. He says:&mdash;"The employment of
convicts in the service of the lower classes of settlers who cannot
afford to pay them anything beyond their rations, or to stimulate
or reward their industry by paying for the extra labour, is very
pernicious. The convict is thus allowed to leave his home in
pursuit of labour that he cannot find there, and he is out of reach
even of the imperfect control of his necessitous master. Governor
Macquarie has endeavoured to restrain this practice by several
orders; and in some of the districts, chiefly occupied by the lower
class of settlers, the magistrates have lately found it necessary
to enforce their execution, both by exacting the fine imposed by
those orders, and by removing the convict labourers from the
control of those settlers who could not furnish them with
employment. The great inconvenience and interruption that
complaints against these servants occasion to the settlers, and the
risk to which they are exposed in leaving their property to seek
redress from the magistrates, is severely felt by all the
inhabitants of the colony: some of them, especially those who had
themselves been convicts, feel a degree of commendable reluctance
in making a complaint against a convict labourer for mere
incapacity, and would rather submit to the unrequited expense of
his maintenance than be the cause of the infliction of unmerited
punishment. This feeling is in some degree attributable to a
sympathy with that condition which was once their own, and is not
corrected until they acquire property, and a disposition to improve
and augment it. Others, influenced by less humane considerations,
or by a dislike of the trouble of complaining, allow the convict to
seek employment where he can find it, or leave him in the towns,
where he is apprehended. He is in these cases sent to gaol, where
he receives an allowance of one pound of bread a day, until he is
taken by another settler; and if he should be sent to Sydney or
Parramatta, he is placed in one of the Government gangs. By this
means his incapacity for agricultural labour is not removed, and
his disposition and habits of indolence are in most cases
confirmed."</p>
<p>In one sense the most difficult class of convicts to deal with
were those who had occupied superior positions of life in the old
country&mdash;the men with no trade, and who were as devoid of the
rough physical strength necessary to ordinary bush work as they
were devoid of mechanical skill. None of the settlers were
agreeable to feed and clothe such "long-coated gentry," as they
were called, knowing that the work they could get out of them in
return would not compensate them. They were also useless for
employment upon Government works, and large as was the staff of
clerks in the Government service, it was not nearly large enough to
allow of the absorption of the full stream of "better class"
criminals that was constantly pouring into the colony&mdash;for be
it known that not a few of the "swell mob" of old England were
among the "patriots" who crossed the sea. Especially was this the
case in Macquarie's time, and that kind-hearted, though vain,
Governor experienced great difficulty in disposing of them. Those
of them who had means&mdash;and not a few brought with them
considerable capital&mdash;became ticket-of-leave men very shortly
after their arrival, the Governor no doubt thinking that the
Government stores should not be placed under contribution for the
keep of men who could not work, and who were in a position to
support themselves. As dealers and traders these men flourished,
and some of them rose to considerable affluence, although they were
always looked upon with disfavour by the other convicts, who were
compelled to labour hard on Government works or under private
masters before they could secure a ticket that would enable them to
"do for themselves."</p>
<p>Mr. Biggs thus refers to these men and Macquarie's method of
dealing with them;&mdash;"The system of granting tickets-of-leave
to these convicts on their arrival too quickly and abruptly,
elevates them from a condition of punishment to a state of
comparative enjoyment. There are many instances in Sydney of the
successful exertion of these people as retail traders; but their
success feeds their vanity as well as their vices, and they
speedily lose that sense of humility and contrition which is
essential to a state of punishment and reform. Another evil arising
from it is the state of comparative equality in which it places
them with that part of the population which came free into the
colony; and with those who, having been sent as convicts at a
period when similar indulgences were not so freely granted, feel
surprise, and some degree of mortification, when they see them
bestowed upon persons who, in their opinions, have done nothing to
deserve them. But it must be acknowledged that there is some
difficulty is disposing of those convicts who have been in the
higher situations of life, and to whose attainments some respect is
naturally paid even in a state of punishment." But it was not in
the "twenties" only that leniency was shewn to soft-handed
criminals. The sentences of the Criminal courts of the present
enlightened age are sometimes made to shape to a point of lightness
in the case of criminals of "superior position" not at all
consistent with justice.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to generalize the conditions of the
convicts under the assignment system and the relation they bore to
their masters, for the regulations were as varied as the method of
their observance was irregular, and no single description could be
made to answer for the whole. The reader will, therefore, pardon
the unavoidable disjointedness of this portion of the narrative,
and overlook apparent discrepancies and repetitions.</p>
<p>The favoritism shewn to the "pure merinos" who were
well-affected towards the existing Government in the matter of the
assignment of convicts, was a notorious circumstance of the reigns
of the Governors between Phillip and Bourke. The Governor, by Act
of Parliament, had the sole disposal and control of the convicts,
and in a community where likes and hatreds were peculiarly strong,
it is not surprising that the friends of those in power should have
the choice of servants and secure the best articles in the
Gubernatorial market. Those in the town would have assigned to them
the only good cooks or gardeners available, while the country
friends would have a miniature manufacturing township on their
estates, getting hold of the shoemakers, blacksmiths, carpenters,
masons, and mechanics of any class; while those without influence
would have to put up with such servants as they could get out of
the unskilled crowd. Sir. R. Bourke reduced assignment to a simple
and fairly just system, and, abandoning his prerogative, gave to a
board of commissioners the power to distribute convict labour,
regulations being formed for their guidance, and which in their
faithful observance gave something like equality to the
apportionment, priority of application and the requirements of the
applicants receiving attention. Of course, the favoured few of the
old regime could not see any justice in such a method: monopolists
never did and never will recognise the rights of others to a share
of that which they have come by long habit to look upon as
peculiarly and exclusively their own. To these men Governor Bourke
appeared as a meddlesome fellow, who did not fully understand the
true principles of nepotism. And this Governor further offended
some of the more powerful masters by the readiness with which he
set about correcting some of the abuses under which the convicts
suffered. Until his time assigned servants could not reckon as one
of their belongings the right of petition, but they soon learned
that any petition sent to him would receive his personal attention.
An unscrupulous master could, by magnifying some trifling fault,
prevent a good servant from obtaining his ticket, and thus prolong
the poor fellow's servitude. Governor Bourke saw the evil, and at
once applied corrective measures. He investigated these cases, and
the knowledge that he did so was a great protection to the servants
and a check upon the masters. The notorious white slave-driver of
Patrick's Plains (Mudie) wrote to his Excellency seeking to deter
him from receiving petitions from convicts; but Bourke, adverting
to this letter, in writing to Judge Therry, shewed his firmness in
the right by saying: "To this I need hardly tell you I will never
consent. I should indeed be an unworthy representative of majesty
if I refused to receive a petition from a man in bonds."</p>
<p>The full portrait of this Legree the Second will be given
further on, and after glancing at it, the reader will not feel in
the least degree surprised that he should seek to debar the
convicts from any privilege, however slight.</p>
<p>The regulations for rations, clothing, &amp;c., for assigned
servants, were subject to occasional alteration, but the following,
which operated between 1830 and 1840, may be taken as a fair sample
of the supply in the best regulation days.</p>
<p>Rations.&mdash;The weekly ration consisted of&mdash;12lbs. wheat
or 9lbs. seconds flour; or, in lieu thereof, at the discretion of
the master, 3&frac12;lbs. maize meal and 9lbs. wheat, or 7lbs. seconds
flour and 7lbs. beef or mutton, or 4&frac12;lbs. salt pork, 2ozs. salt,
2ozs. soap. Any articles which the master might supply beyond those
specified were considered as indulgencies, and likely to be
discontinued at any time.</p>
<p>Clothing.&mdash;The clothing to which assigned servants were
entitled annually consisted of two frocks or jackets, three shirts,
two pairs of trousers, three pairs of shoes, one hat or cap, and
these were to be issued as follows:&mdash;On 1st May in each
year&mdash;One woollen jacket, of Parramatta or strong English
cloth; one pair woollen trousers, ditto; one shirt, one pair shoes,
one hat or cap. On 1st August&mdash;One shirt, one pair shoes. On
1st November&mdash;One woollen or duck jacket, one pair woollen or
duck trousers, as best suited the age or state of health of the man
during the summer season; one shirt, one pair shoes. The shirts
were supposed to be of strong linen or cotton, and the shoes of
stout and durable leather. Each man had also to be kept constantly
supplied with at least one good blanket and palliasse or wool
matrass, which were considered to be the property of the
master.</p>
<p>When Governor Macquarie arrived the weekly ration allowed by law
to each assigned prisoner was 7lbs. beef or 4lbs. pork, and 8lbs.
of wheat; but this was generally regarded as insufficient, and
Macquarie issued an order in 1820 in which this ration was spoken
of as "inadequate to the support of a man." But many of the
employers allowed more than the quantity stipulated in the
regulations, and some of them served out tea and sugar, or milk and
vegetables to their servants as luxuries. The allowance of wheat
had to be ground into flour by the prisoners themselves and this
was generally performed by the assigned convicts in their own time
by means of portable steel hand-mills, with which the houses of the
settlers were supplied. On some of the older stations the remains
of these "old grinders" may still be seen amongst the lumber in the
yards.</p>
<p>Male assigned convicts were classed under the various heads of
field laborers, domestic servants, and mechanics; and the services
of the last-named class being of more value than those of the
former, two were estimated in assignment as equal to those of two
or more field laborers. In the assignment of convicts scarcely any
distinction was made either on account of the period of the
sentence, or on account of the age, the character, or the nature of
the offence; and the previous occupation of a convict generally
determined his condition in the colony.</p>
<p>If a convict were a domestic servant before transportation he
found ready employment under the assignment system, for if well
conducted he was well fed, well clothed, and received wages from
&pound;10 to &pound;15 per year under the most favorable conditions with good
masters. But it must not be supposed that all the good ones were
treated alike; for some of them were treated little better than
slaves by those whom they served, and who aspired to rank with the
"aristocracy" of the land.</p>
<p>Convicts who were mechanics were also well treated as assigned
servants; but they suffered from the hardship of being too much in
favour with the authorities, and were generally kept under the
thumb of the Government, to do government work. The better the
tradesman the less likelihood was there of his obtaining employment
under a private master. This was specially the case in Governor
Macquarie's time, and mechanics would not confess to being such for
fear of the consequences. A blacksmith, carpenter, mason, cooper,
or wheelwright was a very valuable servant in a country where
skilled labour was scarce, and was eagerly sought after. This was
the report of the Select Committee after hearing all the evidence
about this class of assigned servants:&mdash;"As the mechanic can
scarcely be compelled by punishment to exert his skill, it is for
the interest of the master to conciliate his convict mechanic in
order to induce him to work well; in too many cases this is
effected by granting to the skilled convict various indulgences, by
paying him wages, by allotting to him task-work, and by permitting
him after the performance of his task to work on his own account;
and, lastly, by conniving at and overlooking disorderly conduct;
for the most skilled mechanics are generally the worst behaved and
most drunken."</p>
<p>Dr. Ullathorne's testimony was very much to the point. He
says:&mdash;"There is another evil resulting from the assignment of
mechanics to masters, which is this, that they generally have
Monday as a holiday; and indeed the mechanics have their masters
very much in their power, and I have seen the masters put to very
great perplexity in consequence of the manner in which they have
been subject to the power of their men; for instance, the printers
are very much in the power of their assigned servants. When I have
had myself printing work to do, and have been anxious to have it
done, where an engagement has been made, and it has been understood
that the printing should be done at a certain period, I have found
that the masters are so much in the power of their men, that they
will work when they like or take a great deal of time to
themselves. I may observe the same thing with regard to the
coach-maker; he is complaining that he cannot get his work done as
he would wish to have it done. Another evil is that these men
generally take a leisure day to spend that which they receive as
wages; and in consequence, on the Monday, particularly in Sydney,
there was a great deal of drunkenness amongst the assigned
servants. And one thing I particularly remarked: There was of
course a great deal of quarrelling amongst those men, and they used
invariably to come upon Hyde Park, the place of recreation, to
decide those quarrels, and until the year 1835 there used to be
three or four cases of this kind in the day; those men used to come
to decide their quarrels on Hyde Park every Monday, where brutal
fights ensued, and where it was a long time before anybody appeared
to disperse them, unless the Catholic clergyman went to disperse
them, which was very frequently the case." But some of the
mechanics were as good men as they were tradesmen, and not a few of
them succeeded in building up for themselves by honest labour both
reputation and fortune.</p>
<p>The greater number of assigned convicts were, however, employed
as agricultural labourers, shepherds, &amp;c., no fewer than 8,000
of them being thus employed in 1835, when the herds and flocks were
scattering over the plains in the interior, and the waste places,
hitherto unknown, were being made to yield the fruits of husbandry.
Their condition was in the main one of considerable hardship, and
they were inferior as a class to either male domestics or
mechanics; but they received abundance of food, and many of them
drew wages, or tea, sugar, tobacco, spirits, and other indulgences.
The measure of their comfort, however, depended upon the character
of their masters and the number employed; and whether they had an
overseer over them, as in large farms, or were directly under their
master, as on small ones. The overseers generally were either
ticket-of-leave men or emancipists. They were for the most part men
who could not succeed in other occupations, and were as a rule
quite unfitted to be charged with the task of regulating others,
who were really on a level with them.</p>
<p>The shepherds had a very solitary life of it, and were exposed
to more dangers than any other class. Away from the centre and even
the boundary of settlement, they literally carried their lives in
their hands, and hundreds have fallen prey to the vengeance or
murderous propensities of the aborigines. These were the real
pioneers of the country. These were the men who reclaimed waste
places, and settled the land, while their masters, who received the
credit, rested in safety amidst the comforts of whatever
civilization existed. The shepherd, like all men who lead solitary
lives, was either a very good or a very bad man. Dr. Ullathorne
speaks of some of them in the highest terms of praise. Stock-men
fared as did the shepherds, but had a somewhat freer
life&mdash;though by no means less dangerous&mdash;and were said to
be "the most vicious of all the assigned servants."</p>
<p>As a class the convicts who were assigned were neither better
nor worse than might have been expected. In many cases assignment
was the stepping stone to thorough reform; in other cases it was a
steep road downwards, leading to the very lowest depth of
degradation. Sir. George Arthur, Governor of Van Diemen's Land,
likened the convict to a slave, and described him "as deprived of
liberty, exposed to all the caprice of the family to whose service
he may happen to be assigned, and subject to the most summary laws.
His condition in no respect differs from that of the slave, except
that his master cannot apply corporal punishment by his own hands,
or those of his overseer, and has a property in him only for a
limited period. Idleness and insolence of expression or of looks,
anything betraying the insurgent spirit, subject him to the
chain-gang or the triangle, or hard labour on the roads."</p>
<p>Governor Bourke designated as a slave code the law which enabled
a magistrate, invariably himself a master of convicts, to inflict
50 lashes on a convict for "drunkenness, disobedience of orders,
neglect to work, absconding, abusive language to his master or
overseer, or any other disorderly or dishonest conduct." For the
offences quoted the convict could likewise be punished by
imprisonment, solitary confinement, and labour in irons on the
roads.</p>
<p>The lash was kept going with great regularity upon the solid
soil of the assigned servant backs, as witness the following
statistics picked out at random from many:&mdash;In 1835 the number
of summary convictions in New South Wales amounted to 22,000,
although the number of convicts in the colony did not then exceed
28,000. In <i>one month</i> in 1833, no less than 247 convicts were
flogged and <i>nine thousand seven hundred and eighty-four
lashes</i> inflicted, which would give for the year 2,964
floggings, and above 108,000 lashes inflicted, chiefly for
insolence, insubordination, and neglect of work. In Van Diemen's
Land, where the law was even more severe, in 1834 there were 15,000
convicts; the summary convictions amounted to 15,000, and the
number of lashes inflicted to 50,000. Concerning flogging, Rev. Dr.
Ullathorne said&mdash;"The effect of the scourge is exceedingly bad
on the men; the man after that becomes altogether worthless, and
there is a feeling of degradation about him that, even among the
prisoners themselves, he has lost cast; and generally in such cases
the degradation will be felt much more by a better man than it
would by a worse man; the punishment is much more severe upon the
better convict than upon the worse; and, again, it is far more
severe upon the first infliction than it is afterwards; for after
the first infliction the feeling of degradation begins to be lost,
a man's pride gets up, and he hardens himself to the infliction,
whilst he makes his boast among his comrades as to the amount of
infliction he can endure; and, I believe, though you will find many
men amongst them that have not been flogged, you will be astonished
at the number that have been flogged once, and have been flogged
twice. When a man goes through a scourging once, he generally goes
through several scourgings. I recollect hearing of a man who had
been but three years in the colony, and who had received 1600
lashes."</p>
<p>It was true that if a convict were ill-treated he could complain
of his master, and if he substantiated his charge, the master was
deprived of his services; but in order to do this, the convict must
go before a bench, first obtaining a pass from his master, and this
bench might be 100 miles distant, and was composed of magistrates,
themselves owners of convict labour; so it may be imagined that
legal redress was rarely sought for, and still more rarely obtained
by the slave servant against the master, who himself perhaps had
been a convict in the earlier days.</p>
<p>How could it be expected, under circumstances such as these,
that the moral tone of the assigned servants should be highly
refined? The wonder is that it was not worse than it really was,
and in all conscience it was bad enough. Some horrible stories have
been told concerning them&mdash;stories which the writer would not
dare to repeat, even if he had the inclination.</p>
<p>Occasionally instances occurred of remarkable devotion on the
part of convicts to their masters, but in every case those masters
were humane, fair-dealing men. At the time this is being written
there is living in the Bathurst district a man who crossed the
mountains as an assigned servant in 1822. His master treated him
kindly from the first, and received in return most faithful
service; and when that master died, no mourner more sincere
followed his remains to the grave than this man was. Sixty-six
years have passed since he first crossed the mountains, and the old
man may still be seen in his place upon the estate&mdash;spending
his last days in ease and contentment with the son of the master
whom he so faithfully served.</p>
<p>Another illustration of the good fortune which sometimes
attended the better class of masters in the assignment of servants
is related by Judge Therry:&mdash;"The case of good fortune was
that of a settler whose name for the <i>nonce</i> shall be Fox. To
him was assigned a servant named Edward Cane, transported from
Ireland for an agrarian disturbance. He had been a snug farmer at
home, and abroad became invaluable as a superintendent of his
master's estate. From his skill in agriculture, and his good temper
in the management of men, Cane, after having served his seven
years' sentence in Fox's employment, became manager of his whole
property, receiving a liberal salary, which was paid, not in money,
but in cattle and horse stock. After twenty years of service he
thus became a wealthy man. He died in the same service into which
he first entered as an assigned servant. Shortly before his death
his master had born unto him a son. Cane was complimented by being
appointed godfather to the boy. The old man made a will bequeathing
the whole of his property, the accumulated earnings of twenty years
and upwards of arduous toil, to the lucky little bantling, who is
now the leading gentleman in his district. The stock bequeathed to
him greatly increased during his long minority, and on coming of
age the fortunate grandson found himself one of the most extensive
stock-owners in New South Wales."</p>
<p>Sir Richard Bourke won the highest admiration from those whose
hearts were not beyond feeling, by his humane and prudent policy
towards the convicts generally. At the period of his arrival there
were four separate Acts of Council relating to summary process and
punishment of convicts, which Acts were full of errors and
contradictions, leaving an open door for the passing of illegal
sentences. Bourke saw the necessity for amendment of the existing
law, and set to work in earnest to stop the legalised injustice
which it encouraged. He prepared a new Act, which repealed the
other four, and consolidated and simplified the law so as to make
it serve the wisest purpose&mdash;securing labour under equitable
conditions, and the progressive reformation of the convicts. As
previously stated, the Act prepared by him defined the law;
abolished magisterial parlour courts, and established petty
sessions under public observation; encouraged convicts to amend
their ways, and restricted the excessive and capricious use of the
lash.</p>
<p>Such instances of kindness on the part of masters, however, were
very rare indeed; and they only serve to shew out more clearly by
contrast the general harshness and oppression in which the masters
indulged during the whole time the assignment system had life. It
operated in all its hideousness until between 1838 and 1840, when
orders for its discontinuance were received from the home
authorities, the cessation of transportation and the inpouring of
free immigrants rendering a change necessary. Under its operation
New South Wales became one of the largest slave plantations the
world has ever seen, the form of slavery being more degrading than
that existing anywhere the wide world over in times either ancient
or modern. I have only lightly touched some of the worst features
of the system; they will not bear probing in public&mdash;the
rottenness and corruption that would be revealed would be too
offensive to look upon. "It would have been far more merciful,"
says one writer who moved amongst the scenes which he described,
"to have hanged all who violated the laws of their country, than to
have sent them out to New South Wales, subject to the unmerciful
treatment of human tigers, who tortured or killed those within
their power according to the caprice of the moment. I saw many a
fine man die in misery, inch by inch, from the oppression he
experienced&mdash;the most cruel of all deaths." For over fifty
years New South Wales was one vast charnel house!</p>
<p>The following extract from regulations issued by the Governor in
1829, and to which document were attached the signatures "William
Dumaresq, James Busby, E. Deas Thompson," will serve to shew how
the increasing business was transacted:&mdash;</p>
<p>"As an aversion to honest industry and labour has been the chief
cause of most of the convicts incurring the penalties of the law,
they shall be employed at some species of labour of an uniform
kind, which they cannot evade, and by which they will have an
opportunity of becoming habituated to regular employment.</p>
<p>"With this view, all labour of a complex nature, the quantity of
which cannot be easily determined, is to be studiously avoided, and
the convicts are to be employed exclusively in agricultural
operations, when the public buildings or other works of the
settlement do not absolutely require their labour.</p>
<p>"In these operations the use of the hoe and spade shall be as
much as possible adopted; and where the number of men who can be
employed in agriculture is sufficient to raise food for the
settlement with these implements, the use of the plough shall be
given up; and no working cattle are to be employed in operations
which can be effected by men and hand-carts.</p>
<p>"No Sugar or Tobacco or other article which might be used by the
Convicts as a luxury, and which might offer an inducement to
plunder, is to be cultivated at the penal Settlements. The
principal articles to be cultivated are Wheat and Maize, to such an
extent as to allow of exportation if necessary.</p>
<p>"A monthly medical inspection is to be made of the whole of the
Convicts on the Settlement by the medical officer in charge, who
will make a report to the Commandant of their general state of
health.</p>
<p>"The Commandant is vested with the control of every department
on the Settlement; every person, whether free or bond, being
subject to his orders.</p>
<p>"All trafficking and trading between free and bond on the
Settlement shall be strictly prohibited and severely punished.</p>
<p>"The convicts under colonial sentence shall be steadily and
constantly employed at hard labour from sunrise to sunset, one hour
being allowed for breakfast and one hour for dinner during the
winter six months, but two hours will be allotted for dinner during
the summer.</p>
<p>"The convicts shall be worked in field labour with the hoe and
spade in gangs, not fewer than fifteen, nor more than twenty. No
task work shall be allowed. There shall be an overseer attached to
each gang, and to every five gangs a constable, who shall assist
the overseers in the superintendence of the men.</p>
<p>"The constables and overseers are not to strike or push the
convicts, and no punishment is to be inflicted but by the express
order of the commandant.</p>
<p>"As a reward of and encouragement to good conduct, the prisoners
shall be divided into two classes, to be called the first and
second classes respectively. No prisoner shall be admitted into the
second class who shall not have served on the settlement for two
years, if a prisoner for seven years; for four years, if for
fourteen years; and for six years, if for life. But convicts who
have been respited from a capital sentence, shall in no case be
admitted into this class until, upon the representation of the
commandant, their sentences shall have been mitigated by the
Governor.</p>
<p>"The prisoners in the first class receive in addition to the
ordinary ration, one ounce of tobacco. They are to be employed on
the lighter and least laborious operations, and from this class
exclusively are men to be drawn for constables and overseers,
clerks, or servants to the officers, &amp;c.</p>
<p>"No convict shall be employed as a clerk in the Commandant's
office, or have access to any of the records kept there.</p>
<p>"No prisoner transported for life, or for any heinous or
atrocious crime, shall be employed in any other way than as a
common labourer. Those prisoners of the first class selected as
constables and overseers are allowed the usual distinctive dress,
and in addition to their rations 2lbs. flour and 1oz. tobacco per
week; but in no case shall any convict in a penal Settlement be
allowed to receive pecuniary reward. Two years service as a
constable or overseer shall be considered equal to three years'
servitude on the Settlement.</p>
<p>"The wife of a convict shall in no case be allowed to join her
husband until he shall have been placed in the first class, and the
Commandant shall have recommended him for this indulgence.</p>
<p>"The wives and children of convicts shall be allowed rations and
slop clothing from the public stores.</p>
<p>"The wives and children of convicts are not to be allowed to
convey money or property of any kind to the settlement, nor to
possess any live stock or poultry, and they are strictly to be
prohibited from carrying on any trade or traffic in the Settlement;
but they will be furnished with employment in spinning flax, making
straw hats or bonnets, making up slops, and such other work as they
may be capable of performing, the materials for which will be
supplied from the Government store. They will receive credit in the
books of the Settlement, at the market or factory prices, on such
work being returned to the stores; and the amount of their earnings
shall be annually placed in the Saving Bank at Sydney, to be
received by them on their return from the Settlement, as a means of
support on their arrival.</p>
<p>"Married convicts whose families have been permitted to join
them shall be allowed to live in separate huts.</p>
<p>"If any money or property shall be found in the possession of a
convict or the family of a convict it shall be seized and forfeited
to the Benevolent Asylum.</p>
<p>"The labour of the convicts, excepting only those assigned to
the officers, shall be wholly and exclusively applied to the
service of the Settlement generally, and the indulgence of working
on their own account after the usual hours of public labour shall
be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>"No convict shall be allowed to wear any other clothing than
that which is issued to him by the Government, and the number of
each convict shall be painted on each article of dress, before and
behind.</p>
<p>"A separate barrack is to be provided for female convicts; and
if employed in field labour they are to be kept separate from the
men.</p>
<p>"A washing gang from among the female convicts shall be
appointed, to wash and mend the clothes and air the blankets and
palliasses of the prisoners.</p>
<p>"The convicts are not to be allowed to possess knives, or any
sharp instruments; the knives, forks and spoons are to be under the
charge of the Barrack Overseer, and he will be held responsible
that they are duly collected from each convict before he is allowed
to quit his seat at the mess table. This, however, is not to apply
to those married convicts or overseers who shall have been allowed
to live in separate huts.</p>
<p>"The whole of the convicts will be mustered on Sunday morning,
arranged in their several gangs, and attended by their respective
overseers and constables, when they will be inspected by the
Commandant. The wives and families of the convicts will also be
required to attend the Sunday morning musters.</p>
<p>"The prisoners will be mustered daily by the Superintendent of
Convicts, at sunrise before they proceed to labour, when they
return to meals, and again when the work for the day is closed.</p>
<p>"No convict shall be allowed to receive or transmit any letter,
excepting through the Commandant, who is to exercise his discretion
in opening such letters, and perusing their contents."</p>

<p>THE SYSTEM IN FULL EXERCISE&mdash;HOW IT

MUSTER&mdash;FEMALE HOLDERS&mdash;FORM OF APPLICATION&mdash;FORM OF
PASS&mdash;GOVERNOR MACQUARIE'S LIBERALITY&mdash;WHERE ARE THEY
ALL?</p>
<p>A TICKET-OF-LEAVE was simply a permission to the individual to
whom it was granted to employ himself for his own benefit, and to
acquire property; on condition of residing within the district
therein specified, and of presenting himself and producing his
ticket before the magistrate at the periods prescribed by the
regulations. The holder was not allowed to move into another
district without the express sanction of the Governor entered on
the face of the ticket; and the ticket was liable to be resumed at
any time at the pleasure of the Governor, in which case the holder
reverted to the situation of a prisoner of the Crown in every
respect.</p>
<p>As the ticket-of-leave system may be said to have found its
fullest exercise during Governor Bourke's administration, in 1835,
the regulations relating to their issue and holding at that time
will serve to shew how that system operated generally.</p>
<p>The first and indespensable qualification for a ticket was the
completion of a probationary term of servitude, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Four years of a sentence for 7 years.<br>
Six years of a sentence for 14 years.<br>
Eight years of a sentence for life,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>reckoned from the date of employment by Government, or of
assignment to private service. In addition to that probation one
year was added for every change of service of any male convict
appearing to have been occasioned by misconduct. One year was also
added for every punishment inflicted on a male convict by colonial
sentence, except that to an ironed-gang, or penal settlement, in
which case the probation recommended from the expiration of the
sentence. Notwithstand this rule, however, magistrates entertaining
an application for a ticket-of-leave were not precluded from
recommending, at the instance of the master, a remission of the
additional probation required, either for change of service or
punishment, if they were of opinion that the subsequent good
conduct of the applicant had merited the remission.</p>
<p>No strict rules were laid down with regard to the granting of
tickets to female convicts, other than those laid down for the
males under the original regulation. Magistrates were, however,
enjoined to make particular inquiry concerning the eligibility from
term of service and good conduct of the applicant, but particularly
the manner in which they proposed to maintain themselves while
holding the desired indulgence.</p>
<p>Applications for tickets had to be presented personally by the
applicant (on a form supplied for that purpose) to the Petty
Sessions of the district in which he was employed, on such day or
days in every month as the Justices might appoint. One magistrate
had power to deal with applications in conformity with the
regulations; but no application could be received which was not on
the prescribed form and signed by the master or overseer. Blank
forms were supplied to the masters, upon demand, and they were
required to be constantly provided with forms for the use of their
convict servants. Should the master consider the applicant for a
ticket undeserving the indulgence, he was required to state his
opinion in writing to the bench, with the grounds of it, and if he
declined to do this the magistrates did not entertain the
objection. The application could be made three months before the
term of probation had expired, and the master was bound to furnish
the applicant with a printed form of application and a pass to the
court of Petty Sessions, and further to answer all questions of the
court concerning the conduct and claims of the applicant, attending
personally for such purpose if required.</p>
<p>If any convict was proved to have knowingly presented an
application for a ticket before the time prescribed, or made any
false entry of service, either with respect to dates or omitting to
enter the several services in which he had been employed, the bench
immediately reported the case through the Principal Superintendent
of Convicts, and he was punished by one year or more of additional
servitude.</p>
<p>The court entertaining the application entered on the form all
such particulars relating to the conduct of the applicant, as could
be obtained from his present or former masters, and transmitted the
document with others prepared during the month to the
Superintendent of Convicts, for the Governor's information, the
applications being first copied into a book for that purpose by the
clerk, a column being left to enter the decision when obtained. The
principal superintendent, on receipt of the application, examined
the records of his office for any facts necessary to complete the
evidence in favour of or against the claim, and then forwarded the
documents, with his report, to be submitted to the Governor. If the
application was rejected, additional probation being required, the
court of Petty Sessions concerned was immediately apprised of the
fact, and through the magistrates the master was informed, and a
notice posted inside and outside the court-house.</p>
<p>Any convict whose ticket-of-leave had been cancelled by the
Governor, for misconduct, might apply for its restoration, through
the master to whom he had been assigned, who forwarded his reasons
to the magistrates, and they and the Superintendent reported
thereon and sent the documents on to the Governor. Unless in this
manner no application could be made for the restoration of a ticket
until the convict had served a probation of four years from the
date of his ticket being cancelled, when the original regulation
could be carried out.</p>
<p>Male convicts holding tickets for the district of Sydney and
residing within the town were mustered in the parishes in which
they resided, under the inspection of a police-magistrate, on the
first day of every month (or the second if the first fell on
Sunday), at such place and hour as the magistrate might appoint;
and every ticket holder in the town of Sydney leaving his residence
for another in the same parish was compelled to notify the fact in
writing to the wardsman within twenty-four hours of quitting, and
also give a similar notice to the wardsman of the parish in which
he had taken up his residence&mdash;neglect of this regulation
entailing immediate cancellation of the ticket. Those living
without the town, but in the district for which Sydney was the
place of Petty Sessions, were mustered quarterly. Holders of
tickets in the country districts were also mustered quarterly at
the court house, before a police-magistrate if there were one in
that district, or otherwise the Clerk of Petty Sessions under the
inspection of a justice of the peace. Immediately after each muster
the magistrates, under whose superintendence it was held, or the
clerk of the bench, had to report the names of all absentees to the
Principal Superintendent of Convicts for the Governor's
information.</p>
<p>Magistrates superintending the muster had liberty to interrogate
the ticket-holder respecting his means of subsistence and manner of
life, and if not satisfied that he was getting an honest living, he
made a special report of the case. If a ticket-holder failed to
attend the musters and did not show good cause for non-attendance
he was deprived of his ticket; also if he were found at any time
beyond the limits of the district for which the ticket had been
granted, and without a pass or other authority.</p>
<p>Women holding tickets-of-leave were not required to muster in
person, but had to forward a report to the magistrate
superintending the muster stating that they held tickets and where
they resided. Any omission in the delivery of these reports, or any
false statement, rendered the ticket liable to cancellation.
Magistrates had power to dispense with these reports, however, in
the case of married women whose characters and habits justified a
relaxation of this rule.</p>
<p>Holders of tickets shewing reasonable cause could obtain from
the nearest justice of the peace a pass for absenting themselves
from the district for a period of not more than 14 days; but a pass
for a longer time had to be granted by the Principal Superintendent
of Convicts. Application had also to be made to the Principal
Superintendent for the transfer of a ticket from one district to
another.</p>
<p>On 19th April, 1849, the last ticket-of-leave regulations were
published. They read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"All tickets-of-leave are issued for particular districts, named
in the ticket-of-leave; or passports, to enable the holder to
remain in the service of masters beyond the boundaries of
location.</p>
<p>"Every ticket-of-leave holder is required, within 14 days after
his arrival in his district, to report, either personally or in
writing, to the Clerk of Petty Sessions of his district, his name
and ship, residence, the name of his master or employer, his trade
or calling, or his mode of maintaining himself; and also to do so
between the 1st and 14th January in every year. Any ticket-of-leave
holder failing to comply with this order will be reported to the
Principal Superintendent of Convicts with a view to having his
indulgence cancelled.</p>
<p>"If he is on passport he is to make his report to the
Commissioner of Crown Lands of the district in which he is
employed, instead of the bench.</p>
<p>"He is required to report every change of service or residence
in the district within 14 days of its taking place; and if beyond
the boundaries, such change of service can only be made with the
authority of the Commissioner first obtained for that purpose.</p>
<p>"Immediately after each muster, the magistrate under whose
superintendence it is made will report the names of all absentees
to the Principal Superintendent of Convicts, for the Governor's
information, and with a view to the cancellation of the prisoner's
ticket.</p>
<p>"The district in which a ticket-of-leave is considered to have
effect is the police district named in such ticket, according to
the boundaries fixed by the Government.</p>
<p>"The bench of magistrates or the police magistrate of the
district, will, whenever they think it necessary interrogate the
holder of a ticket-of-leave, respecting his means of subsistence
and manner of life, and if he shall not be satisfied that the
ticket-of-leave holder subsists honestly, he will render a special
report of the case to the Principal Superintendent of Convicts for
the Governor's information.</p>
<p>"No ticket-of-leave holder is to be out of his district without
a pass, except in the execution of his duty as a constable.</p>
<p>"Passes to leave the district are to be given only by the the
police magistrate, or by two magistrates of the district acting in
Petty Sessions, and every such pass must be countersigned by the
clerk of the bench.</p>
<p>"Such passes can only be granted for periods not exceeding
fourteen days, and no passes can be renewed, nor any new pass
granted to the same person until after the expiration of two months
from the date of the former one.</p>
<p>"Forms of the passes are obtainable at the police office, upon
payment of 2/6 fee.</p>
<p>"Passes for a longer period than 14 days can only be granted by
the Principal Superintendent of Convicts, on the application of the
ticket-of-leave holder, or his master, through the bench of
magistrates in his district.</p>
<p>"The Principal Superintendent of Convicts is the only person who
can grant permission to any holder of a ticket-of-leave to change
his district; and all applications to him for that purpose, or for
permission to reside beyond the boundaries on passports, must be
made through the bench of magistrates of the district in which the
ticket-of-leave holder resides, accompanied by a fee of 2/6, and
the bench is required to forward such applications, with their
remarks thereon, to the Principal Superintendent of Convicts.</p>
<p>"The breach of any of these regulations will subject a
ticket-of-leave holder to be deprived of his indulgence, and to be
returned to the service of the Government.</p>
<p>"No ticket-of-leave holder for a country district is allowed to
be in Sydney without a pass; and any such person found there
without authority will have his ticket cancelled, and be
immediately removed to Cockatoo Island.</p>
<p>"A ticket-of-leave holder who forfeits his indulgence, from a
breach of the regulations, or any other cause, returns to the
position of an ordinary prisoner of the Crown, and forfeits all the
privileges he possessed while holding his ticket-of-leave, and can
be called upon to serve a probation of three years before his
indulgence is restored to him.</p>
<p>"The holder of a ticket is liable to be punished summarily by
magistrates in petty sessions for the following offences, namely,
misdemeanours, pilfering, simple larcenies under &pound;5.
Punishment&mdash;sentence to irons for six or twelve months.
Drunkenness, absconding from district, or when beyond the
boundaries from the service for which he holds his passport, or
other disorderly or dishonest conduct&mdash;the forfeiture of his
ticket. In addition to this, as an ordinary prisoner of the Crown,
he may be punished for neglect of work, disobedience of orders, or
absconding, by 50 lashes, two months to the treadmill, or
imprisonment with hard labour, or 14 days' solitary
confinement.</p>
<p>"That any convict absconding from district, or the service of
his employer, during the subsistence of his sentence of
transportation, shall be liable to be tried in a summary way by the
tribunal authorised to take cognizance of such offences, although
at the date of his apprehension his original and additional
sentences may have expired by effluxion of time, and he will be
liable to be punished in the same way as if the period of his
original term had not expired.</p>
<p>"All sentences to irons, to the roads, to imprisonment or the
treadmill, are cumulative on a prisoner's original sentence, and
have to be served in addition to such original term: for example,
if a prisoner's sentence is 14 years, and he receives a sentence of
6 months in irons, he will not be free until he has served 14 years
and six months from the date of original conviction.</p>
<p>"A ticket-of-leave holder is also subject to the provisions of
the Masters' and Servants' Act, by which he may be punished by
imprisonment, or forfeiture of wages, for absence from his
employer's service, for disobedience, or neglect of orders, or
other misconduct in service. Or if he obtains money in advance from
an employer and fails to enter his service, or fails to perform his
agreement in any way; for all these offences he is liable to
punishment under the above Act, irrespective of any other
punishment, as a prisoner, where the offence is of a criminal
nature. But under the same Act a ticket-of-leave holder can also
compel his employer to perform his part of the contract, in all
respects as effectually as if he (the prisoner) were a free
man.</p>
<p>"Any ticket-of-leave holder who has held his indulgence with
good conduct for three years, certified to by three magistrates, or
persons of respectability known to the Government, may apply by
petition to the Governor, through the Principal Superintendent of
Convicts, for a conditional pardon; this indulgence enables the
holder to exercise all the rights of a free subject, and to proceed
to any part of the world, save Great Britain and Ireland, or if
tried out of the United Kingdom, excepting also the place where he
was convicted.</p>
<p>"By Act of Parliament it is provided that a convict holding a
ticket-of-leave is allowed to acquire and hold personal property,
and to maintain an action or suit for the recovery of any personal
property, or for any debt due to him, or for any damage or injury
sustained by him; but if he should at any time forfeit his
ticket-of-leave, from misconduct, the property acquired by him will
become absolutely vested in Her Majesty, and shall be disposed of
at the discretion of the Governor of the colony.</p>
<p>"Addenda.&mdash;Every ticket-of-leave holder is required to hold
his indulgence for three consecutive years with good conduct, and
to pay into the hands of the Principal Superintendent of Convicts
the sum of &pound;15, by yearly instalments of &pound;5 each (on account of the
expense of his passage to the colony) before a conditional pardon
can be issued to him.</p>
<p>"Any ticket-of-leave holder who has held his ticket for two
years with good conduct (which must be certified by three
magistrates or persons of respectability known to the Government),
and who has paid the sum of &pound;10 on account of his passage money,
may apply by petition to the Governor through the principal
Superintendent of Convicts for a conditional pardon, and will be
recommended home for that indulgence; but his pardon will not be
issued until he has completed three years from the date of his
ticket, and has paid into the hands of the Principal Superintendent
of Convicts the remaining &pound;5 due for his passage. It being,
however, understood that any offence committed by a ticket holder
after he has been recommended to the Secretary of State for a
pardon, will render him liable to have that indulgence withheld (on
its arrival) for such a time as His Excellency the Governor may see
fit."</p>

<p>The system of granting indulgences to the convicts found its
highest exercise during Governor Macquarie's administration. As I
have already shewn in "The Story of the Ten Governors," Macquarie
was a vain man, and ambitious as he was vain. He discountenanced
immigration, contending that the colony was intended for convicts,
and by granting indulgences to the good conduct prisoners he sought
to promote reformation and preserve something like good order. But
his mistaken zeal carried him too far, and in large numbers of
cases crime was increased instead of lessened, and evil habits were
encouraged rather than corrected by undue leniency. That which is
acquired very easily is frequently estimated lightly, and the
liberality with which he dispensed tickets-of-leave, conditional
pardons, free pardons, and certificates of freedom to all and
sundry of the convicts who cared to take the trouble to apply (and
it may be taken for granted that very few hesitated to make the
request under such circumstances) wrought more evil than good
frequently. Every convict who had been fortunate enough to escape a
second conviction came to look upon the granting of one or other of
the indulgences named as a duty which the Governor owed to him
individually, and hence applications poured in by the hundred,
until at last the Governor himself grew weary of dispensing the
favours.</p>
<p>A ticket-of-leave, as already stated, enabled the holder to go
anywhere he chose within a certain district, and to employ himself
in whatever way he thought fit to his own advantage. Those persons
who had been transported for life were granted conditional pardons
if they maintained a good character for ten years; but they could
not leave the colony. If they continued of good character for an
additional five years they were entitled to apply for an absolute
pardon. Those whose sentences were determined by years&mdash;the
seven or fourteen years' men&mdash;were allowed to apply for
conditional pardons when they had served three-fourths of their
time. At this time&mdash;1818 and 1820&mdash;an absolute pardon,
when granted, was registered in the Governor's secretary's office,
on payment of a fee of 5/- to the principal clerk. It contained a
declaration under the hand of the Governor that the unexpired term
of transportation was absolutely remitted to the holder, and it was
sealed with the seal of the territory. A conditional pardon
contained a declaration that the sentence of the holder had been
conditionally remitted, the condition being that he should reside
within the limits of the colony during the full term of his
original sentence, and the breach of this condition exposed the
holder to servitude for the remainder of the term of his original
sentence. A ticket-of-leave simply contained a declaration of the
Governor's pleasure to dispense with the attendance at Government
work of the convict holding it, and permission to employ himself in
any lawful occupation within a given district for his own
advantage. But its continuance depended upon the holder's good
behaviour, and the Governor's pleasure. Certificates of freedom
attested that the party holding it had served the full term of his
sentence and had again become entitled to all the rights of a free
subject.</p>
<p>But they were not hard and fast rules upon which Macquarie
acted, albeit they were of his own making. He could suspend and set
aside as well as create, and he was not slow to do either or both
when he saw that the observance of those regulations was likely to
interfere with the carrying out of his "bricks and mortar" hobby.
Hence he kept many convicts at hard labour making a road or
erecting a public building long after they should have had their
liberty; and as a result discontent and insubordination arose among
the men. But they could gain nothing by opposition and were
compelled to suffer the deprivation as best they could. On three
occasions within four years Macquarie suspended the general convict
regulations framed by himself in order that large public work which
he had planned should be carried out, the best men being kept at
works longer than their less skilful and industrious companions,
because their services were more valuable.</p>
<p>During Macquarie's rule he granted no less than two thousand
five hundred tickets-of-leave, one thousand five hundred
conditional pardons, and four hundred free pardons; although he was
compelled at one time in self-defence to restrict the issue of the
indulgences within very narrow limits. Writing on this subject,
Bennett, after mentioning that the Governor during the first year
or two of his rule received and granted applications for these
indulgences almost daily, says;&mdash;"Constant indulgence,
however, soon blunted the pleasure of exercising his vice-regal
functions; and what had at first been a source of gratification, at
length became an almost intolerable nuisance. Macquarie himself was
not only prevented by the constant appeals of prisoners from
attending to other business, but the settlers were placed at great
inconvenience by the frequently recurring absence of their assigned
men in journeys to Sydney to present their petitions and
applications for his favours. The days on which these requests
could be received from prisoners were after a short time limited to
once a month, but even this soon became so tiresome and
inconvenient, that in 1813 regulations were issued containing new
and stringent requirements, and restricting all such applications
to one day in the year, viz., the first Monday in December. This
was going from one extreme to the other, and occasioned very
serious inconvenience by bringing large numbers of prisoners to
Sydney from all parts of the colony at the same time; and was
particularly annoying to the farmers, as it often took almost all
their men away just at the commencement of the harvest. The
practice, nevertheless, was persisted in for several years, and was
the occasion of some very remarkable and disorderly scenes taking
place in Sydney, and even at Government House itself. An
eye-witness gives the following account of what he saw there in
1819:&mdash;'In the year 1813 a regulation took place respecting
the application of convicts that they should thenceforth only be
made one day in the year, viz., the first Monday in each succeeding
month of December. I was once present at Government House on the
day on which the petitions were presented. The crowd upon the
occasion was very great, and observing their impatience the
Governor addressed them and informed them that he would grant no
tickets-of-leave to those who had not been three years in the
country, nor any other indulgence except in terms of his
proclamation of the year 1813. This address produced no effect; and
there was great difficulty in preserving order in the presentation
of the petitions that were delivered to the Governor; who, on
perusing the statements and looking at the certificates, either
wrote in pencil on the margin the initial letters of the indulgence
that was to be given, or rejected the petitions altogether. The
petitions presented on this occasion exceeded 700 in number. They
were collected by the major of brigade and two clerks, who, with
the superintendent of convicts, were the only other persons
present.'"</p>
<p>Vain men are generally erratic, and Governor Macquarie formed no
exception to the rule. He was most liberal to prisoners whose
crimes had been committed across the sea, no matter how black those
crimes had been, but he was severe, sometimes to extremes, in
dealing with men who continued criminal in the new country, and who
were convicted of offences on this side the water. The doubly
convicted prisoners were first flogged and then further punished by
being sent to the Coal River, the name then given to the Hunter, on
account of the coal mines at its entrance, where they were kept at
labour in chains under very stringent rule, in the mines hewing
coal, or in the bush burning lime or wood cutting, the rations
served out to them being of inferior quality.</p>
<p>Every Governor in his turn dealt out these indulgences with more
or less liberality, and in the early days printed pieces of rough
parchment bearing the vice-regal signature and the colony's seal
were far more numerous than bank notes, or even sheets of ordinary
writing paper. What has become of them all? Have the descendants of
the holders preserved them as heir-looms; or, viewing them as
loathsome reminders of the chains which bound their fathers and
mothers&mdash;perhaps both&mdash;have they cast them in the fire,
and put from them all memory of the act? If this last has been the
case, who so fond of ghouls as to rake the ashes? Let the dead past
lie still, so far as individuals are concerned. Many of the men and
women of to-day, whose parents or grand-parents held these
indulgences during portions of their life are better citizens than
some of the descendents of the men who granted them. He who would
cast up to the face of another a father's shame is something
infinitely worse than a fool, and should be scorned and spurned by
every honest, upright man. I am dealing with the system
simply&mdash;not for the sake of satisfying morbid taste or
gluttonous curiosity, but in order that the Australian of to-day
may see from what horrors he has escaped, and thank God that this
fair land has been freed from a thraldom worse than that which ever
cursed a heathen people.</p>
<p>There may be something morbid in the taste (who can tell?) of
some of those who have lived through portion of the evil time, and
who still retain the "parchment of freedom" that relieved them from
the terrors of the lash and the chain. I know of one ancient and
respectable dame in the city of Bathurst who has hidden away
amongst her little collection of "valuables" a diminutive tin box,
in which there lies a small, smoke-coloured piece of parchment,
almost worn through at the creases, but which is more precious to
her than many brand-new bank notes, and with which she would not
part for all that you could offer her. No unkindly eye has ever
looked upon that parchment since the day it was first folded to be
preserved, for it was her "old man's" passport to freedom in the
days when freedom was counted the greatest blessing under
heaven&mdash;a passport which protected him until he crossed the
border of this land of slaves into, let us hope, the pure bliss of
that better land, where neither knout, nor irons, nor shame, nor
tears, are known.</p>

<p>A CONDITIONAL pardon, when approved by Her Majesty through the
Secretary of State, but not before, restored the rights of freedom
from the date of the instrument within the colony; but bestowed no
power of leaving the colony, and no right whatever beyond its
limits. When once confirmed according to law it could not be
revoked, and the holder was equally empowered to pursue his lawful
occupation in any part of the country, as if he had never been
convicted.</p>
<p>The following are copies of two conditional pardons which came
into my possession, the one nearly fifty years and the other forty
years after the Governor's signature and the seal of the Territory
had been affixed thereto. The words are printed on a sheet of

<p>WHEREAS, by an Act of the Imperial Parliament of Great Britain
and Ireland, passed in the Sixth Year of the Reign of Her Majesty
Queen Victoria, entituled, <i>"An Act to Amend the Law affecting
Transported Convicts, with respect to Pardons and
Tickets-of-Leave,"</i> it was, amongst other things enacted, that,
after the taking effect of the said recited Act, in any place to
which Felons or Offenders had been or might be transported by Law,
the Governor or Lieutenant-Governor should, from time to time by an
Instrument in Writing, under his Hand, recommend such Felons or
other Offenders as he should think fit to be recommended to Her
Majesty, for an Absolute or Conditional Pardon; and in case Her
Majesty, through one of Her Principal Secretaries of State, signify
Her approval of any such recommendation, it should be lawful for
the Governor or Lieutenant-Governor to grant an Absolute or
Conditional Pardon, pursuant to such instructions as should be sent
to him by the Secretary of State, by an Instrument in Writing,
under the seal of his Government, which should be deemed from the
Day of the Date thereof, to have, within such Place or Places as
should be specified in such Pardon, but not elsewhere, the same
effect in the Law, to all intents and purposes, as if a General,
Absolute, or Conditional Pardon, had passed on that Day, under the
Great Seal of the United Kingdom: And Whereas the said recited Act
has taken effect in the said Colony of New South Wales: And Whereas
<i>Richard T......r,</i> whose description is hereunto annexed
having been indicted and convicted at <i>Lincoln Assizes</i> on the
<i>fourteenth</i> Day of March, One thousand eight hundred and
<i>twenty-nine,</i> of the crime of <i>Highway Robbery,</i> was, in
pursuance of the said conviction, sentenced to Transportation, and
was accordingly transported to the said Colony <i>for the period of
his natural life:</i> And Whereas, in consideration of the good
conduct of the said <i>Richard T......r, since his arrival in the
Colony, I, Sir Charles Augustus FitzRoy</i>, as such Governor of
New South Wales, recommend the said <i>Richard T......r,</i> to Her
Majesty for a Pardon, to take effect in all parts of the world,
except the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland: And Whereas
Her Majesty has been graciously pleased to signify Her approval of
such recommendation, through Her Principal Secretary of State for
the Colonies: Now Know Ye, that I, Sir Charles Augustus FitzRoy, in
pursuance of the Power and Authority so in me vested by the said
recited Act, and of Her Majesty's gracious approval so signified,
and of the instructions of the said Secretary of State in this
behalf, do hereby grant unto the said <i>Richard T......r,</i> a
Pardon for the Offence in respect of which Sentence of
Transportation was passed as aforesaid, which shall take effect in
all parts of the world, except the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland: Provided Always, and it is hereby expressly declared
to be a Condition of this Pardon, that if the said <i>Richard
T......r,</i> shall at any time during the continuance of the term
of his said Sentence, go to, or be in, any part of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, then this Pardon shall
thenceforth be and become wholly void, as by Her Majesty's commands
expressly limited and directed: And all Her Majesty's Officers and
Ministers of Justice, and all other, Her Majesty's Subjects, are

<p>In the case of the first-named Convict, <i>Michael C......y,</i>
a higher Authority than Her Majesty the Queen or Sir George Gipps
had authorised his departure from New South Wales, and when the
Conditional pardon reached Bathurst he had gone. He died at Kelso,
where he had been serving as lock-up Keeper with ease to himself
and satisfaction to his superior officers for some time prior to
his decease, and the conditional pardon could not follow him. The
second convict named, for some reason or other, best known to the
authorities, or the man's employer, never saw the document, and
lived in servitude for some years after it was in existence, not
knowing that his application for a conditional pardon had been
granted. He could neither read nor write, and his master valued his
services too highly to risk the loss of them by telling his slave
that he was practically free. He died as he had lived, in ignorance
of a fact which would have made glad his heart.</p>

SERVANTS&mdash;SICKENING DETAILS&mdash;JUDGE THERRY'S
EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p>THE women convicts gave the authorities more trouble than did
the male convicts, for from first to last there were great
difficulties surrounding their control and disposal. In regard to
numbers the proportion of females to males was as one to four, and,
strange though it may seem, the greatest trouble could be traced to
the smallness of their numbers. Their sex proved at once their
strength and their weakness. The settlers sought them as house
servants; the ticket-of-leave holders and other prisoners sought
them as wives; and the knowledge that they were so eagerly sought
after, added to the knowledge that they could not be punished like
the male prisoners, rendered many of them saucy, independent, and
reckless. The majority of them as servants proved a curse to the
households in which they were engaged, especially in those homes
where there were children, and simply help-meets in vicious work to
the men who had chosen them for partners. Yet not a few of them,
under favorable conditions, proved valuable domestics, faithful
wives, and good mothers&mdash;bright contrasts to the many who like
"raging waves of the sea" foamed out their own shame.</p>
<p>The proceedings at the reception and distribution of female
convicts upon their arrival differed somewhat from those attendant
upon the arrival of male convicts, and which have already been
described. After being mustered on board the ship they were allowed
to land in their own dresses, and not in those provided by the
Government&mdash;a concession much appreciated by the majority of
them, although it is doubtful whether the feelings of self-respect
which it was thought would be encouraged by such a course were at
all promoted. Those who had husbands in the colony were allowed to
join them, provided the husbands were in a position to support them
and gave evidence of a desire to reform. The remainder were either
assigned to private service or sent to the Factory at
Parramatta&mdash;which was supposed to serve as a house of
correction for the incorrigible and as a sort of refuge for the
sick or those who had young children. Those to whom women were
assigned as servants had to sign an agreement, each binding himself
to retain the woman in his service for three years, providing her
with good and sufficient food, clothing and lodging; and in no case
to allow her beyond his control, unless with the approbation of a
magistrate or in case of misconduct legally proved. The penalty for
breach of this agreement was &pound;20, but there is no record of that
penalty ever having been enforced, although the agreement was
openly broken in hundreds of cases, especially in the interior of
the country.</p>
<p>The assigned servants who misconducted themselves were ordered
to the Factory, where they were kept employed in spinning and
weaving a very coarse grey woollen cloth for the settlers, and as
clothing for the prisoners. It was the practice for settlers to
send in their own wool to the factory, and receive a yard of cloth
for every 5lbs. of wool sent in, the authorities thus obtaining one
pound of wool for the labour expended in manufacturing the cloth,
four pounds of the raw material being sufficient to make a yard of
cloth; and the wool thus taken in payment was used to make clothes
for the prisoners, this work also being performed by the women in
the Factory. The fleeces of the coarse-woolled sheep were used for
this purpose until 1819, when the introduction of fine-woolled
sheep checked the work, and the coarse wool required for the
manufacture of the prisoners' clothing had to be imported by the
Government. A full account of life within the Factory walls will be
given in a subsequent chapter; at present I purpose dealing only
with the assignment system as it applied to the female
convicts.</p>
<p>Assignment was considered punishment for female, as well as for
male convicts. In respectable families the condition of convict
women, as concerned their food, clothing, and indulgences, was much
the same as ordinary free servant-women in the old country. Their
general conduct was bad. They were all of them, with very few
exceptions, drunken and abandoned prostitutes; and even were any of
them inclined to be well-conducted the disproportion of sexes in
the colony was so great that they were exposed to irresistible
temptations. For instance, in a private family in the interior a
convict woman, perhaps the only one in the service, or even in the
neighbourhood, was surrounded by a number of depraved characters,
to whom she became an object of constant pursuit and solicitation,
and she was generally obliged to select one man as a paramour, to
defend her against the importunities of the rest. The women seldom
remained in one place long, however. They generally committed some
offence for which they were returned to Government, or became
pregnant and had to be sent to the Female Factory to be confined,
at the Government expense, of course. At the expiration of their
term in the Factory they would be re-assigned, and go through the
same course.</p>
<p>"It can be easily imagined," the Commissioners reported to the
House of Commons, "what a pernicious effect must be produced upon
the character of the rising generation of the Australian Colonies
in consequence of the children of the settlers being, too
frequently, in their tenderest years under the charge of such
persons. Many respectable settlers are, however, unwilling to
receive convict women as assigned servants, when they can possibly
dispense with the service of females; and in many instances convict
men-servants are preferred for those domestic operations which are
performed in this country (England) by women only. A considerable
portion, therefore, of the female convicts are retained in the
service of the lower description of settlers, by whom, it is
notorious that they are not uncommonly employed as public
prostitutes."</p>
<p>Rev. Dr. Ullathorne declared before the Committee that the
misconduct of their assigned servants were as common a topic of
conversation with the ladies in Australia as the weather in
England. He also said that generally speaking, very soon after
their arrival at their assigned place they began to be negligent,
and from negligence they turned to pilfering, and from pilfering
generally followed drunkenness, and from drunkenness generally
debauchery; and it was very rare indeed that a woman remained above
a few months in service before she was sent back to the Factory for
punishment. "I now speak," said he "of assignment in towns. There
are, I believe, cases in which they remain longer in the service in
the country, where perhaps only one or two are in service at the
same place, and where they have fewer temptations."</p>
<p>Female convicts were allowed to marry free men, but they
remained under the surveillance of the police, and were liable to
be sent back to the Factory in case of misconduct. Marriages
between them and men who had been convicts were encouraged, and the
Government even permitted them to marry when in service, provided
the permission of the master were obtained, and a security given by
him to the Government that the offspring of such union should not
become chargeable to the State. Most of the convicts who were
permitted to marry obtained their wives from the Factory; but such
marriages rarely turned out well, for the woman not infrequently
became the common property of the convict servants on the
establishment, creating innumerable quarrels among the men, who
purchased her favours generally by petty larcenies upon their
master.</p>
<p>Speaking of the behaviour of the female convict servants Mr.
John Russell says:&mdash;"They behave very badly indeed frequently.
They do, as well as the men, much mischief to the rising
generation, being generally most mischievous in attempting to
seduce or contaminate the daughters of the settlers. I have known
them make use of the daughters as spies to assist them with their
paramours. I know a melancholy instance where three girls, about 13
or 14, were left in the society of a convict servant maid by their
mother&mdash;in fact, the mother was more culpable than any one
else. These children were used as spies for her paramour and were
often witnesses of her intrigues...................I have heard
since that the three girls have been got with child by a connexion
of their own, which was just the result of being left by the mother
to the tuition of a convict servant-maid."</p>
<p>The same gentleman (who was at one time commandant of Port
Arthur penal establishment), further says:&mdash;"I think that the
male convicts being in families of free settlers did a great deal
of mischief, particularly to the rising generation, in corrupting
them, both boys and girls. It is natural for them (the children) to
associate with the convict servants about any houses, and I think
they have been frequently very much corrupted by them; and, with
the free settlers, the effect has been to make the lower order of
free men just as bad as the convicts. Instances of contamination
came under my own particular knowledge. Three men were hanged for a
rape on a little girl, about five years old, the daughter of one of
the most respectable men in the colony. The men were the servants
of the family, and there were many aggravating circumstances
attending the case. I was on the jury. This child and her sister of
greater age, associated with the convicts, male and female; they
were very much in the society of a female convict there, and it
came out on the trial that this woman was privy to what had been
going on among the men with the two children; in fact, while one
child was being ruined, the other watched at the door and gave
information if any one was approaching. And on the trial that child
(and she was a most beautiful child) called every part of man and
woman by the most beastly names, which she had heard from the
convicts. I am sorry to mention the case, but they were the
children of one of the most respectable settlers in the
colony&mdash;not in the town, but in the country. One of the girls
was aged five, and the other thirteen; and I believe nearly the
whole of the convict men were equally culpable with those
convicted. And within a week from about the time these men were
tried a police magistrate sent two children to me, under similar
circumstances to be examined."</p>
<p>The same official says again:&mdash;"Ladies prefer the domestic
service of men to those women. They are very much in the habit,
when corrected by their mistresses, of making use of the most
grossly indecent language, because they know their mistresses
cannot repeat such gross language in evidence before a magistrate.
This is the general state of the case, but I must say that there
are many women who turn out exceedingly well when they fall into
the hands of good mistresses; but there are masters who bring ruin
on the women. One man, for instance, I knew, (and I believe he is
not singular) who is in the habit of locking out his female
servants with his men at night in the outhouses, and letting them
do as they like."</p>
<p>A gentleman who was Superintendent of Convicts at the Government
establishment at Emu Plains, for three years, 1821-24, Mr. Murdock,
and who afterwards became a large landed proprietor, bore the
following testimony concerning the women:&mdash;"There was only
another free man at Emu Plains besides myself, and no free women
belonging to the establishment. The last year and a half I was
there 25 women were sent up from the Factory, to be employed in
hoeing the corn, and in things of that nature. I was requested by
Sir Thomas Brisbane to go to Sydney to attend at an investigation
that took place relative to the women that he had sent up to Emu
Plains. It had been reported to the Secretary of State for the
Colonies that the women had been sent there for the purposes of
prostitution, and that they were there for no other purpose; and to
refute that statement I was called upon to go to Sydney. It was
proved at that investigation that everything had been done to
prevent prostitution, and that it had been by no means common among
the women.</p>
<p>"The women were permitted to marry the convicts, and they all
married with the exception of two or three. I think the whole
system of punishment of females an utter abomination. I think,
under the system, to reform the unfortunate females themselves is
impossible; I think they contaminated all around them, and that
they were the most complete nuisance we had in the colony. Between
the year 1831 (when in Van Diemen's Land) and the arrival of the
first ship with free females, called the Princess Royal, I believe
I had eleven female convicts in my house, and I quite shudder now
when I contemplate their conduct, and consider that my children
were under their charge. I may mention the first woman we received.
When we landed I went to the Female Factory and asked the
superintendent if he could recommend Mrs. Murdock, just come to the
colony, in delicate health, a decent female to attend her. He said
he would send a woman down, and accordingly a woman did come; and I
think when I asked her she said she was either a nailer or a
button-maker. Mrs. Murdock saw her and almost wished herself at
home again; however, nothing could be done and she got a little
room made up for her and put her in it; and she went in one day and
found her lying on the bed with what she called a yard of clay in
her mouth, and drinking a pot of porter and blowing a cloud; that
was her own expression to Mrs. Murdock when she went in. I think I
sent her back to the Factory that night. The next was a remarkably
clever woman, but I understood afterwards that she had attempted to
poison herself three or four times. She at last ran away from us,
got married on a false certificate, and a year or two ago was found
dead in her bed through drink; and I suppose, if I could follow the
history of them up, they would, no doubt, be all much the same. In
gentlemen's houses if the convict women-servants are well disposed,
their condition would be tolerably good; but really as far as my
observation goes, generally speaking, their condition is very bad,
and a modest woman could hardly remain so, if she chose. She is
despised and insulted by her mistress very often, and her only
protection sometimes is in forming a liason with some of the
convicts about the house; she is not allowed to marry under twelve
months' good behaviour, a period few of them could manage to
accomplish. The generality of the female servants are rather hardly
treated by the common settlers, but I may explain that they are
generally so bad, that the settlers have no heart to treat them
well. It is their general fate, mostly, to become prostitutes to
the convict servants in order to obtain a protector. As punishment
they were taken to the nearest police magistrate, who, if he has
cells at the station, perhaps put them into the cells a given
number of day's on bread and water; but if he thinks they are not
likely to do well in their places, he returns them to the Female
Factory under a sentence of so many months, as the crime appears to
deserve. They were assigned to others after their sentence in the
Factory had expired. I think punishment in the Factory would have
deterred them if anything would. I do not believe that one woman in
a thousand has the moral energy to resist the temptations she was
exposed to in the places she went to. I have known a respectable
lady remark that she did not attempt to prevent prostitution with
her female servants, because it was not possible. I cannot possibly
conceive anything more injurious to the character of the rising
generation than to be under the charge of such people."</p>
<p>Further testimony of the corrupting influences of the convict
servants upon the children of those to whom they were assigned is
given by Surgeon Barnes. Here is what he says:&mdash;"The moral
effects of convicts being employed as domestic servants in the
families of free settlers were, in most instances, of a very
demoralizing character. It sometimes happened that a convict was
employed as a schoolmaster in a family, to teach both the male and
female branches; and it often happened that very improper
intercourse took place between a prisoner and the female branches
of a family. Many instances of that kind have occurred. In one of
the districts near my residence a convict was employed as a kind of
a clerk, and also as a schoolmaster, who seduced the daughter of
his employer. The matter, however, was not made public; it was
hushed up. In another instance the daughters of a respectable
individual, also residing in the neighbourhood in which I was
living, had become so linked with the male convict servants of the
establishment, two of them, that it was generally known throughout
the district that those girls were almost in the same position as
prostitutes, not to one servant, but to all the servants of the
establishment; and the report went so far as to say, that they were
in the habit of associating with a road-party of men. I speak this
as matter of fact, because it came under my own observation; and on
one occasion I spoke to the father, thinking it my duty, as a
friend, and as I was professionally employed; I cautioned him
against letting them have so much license; but, however, the father
either disbelieved what I had stated, or he did not choose to
consider that his daughters' conduct was at all improper; but the
report I believe is very correct, and there were many observations
and ocular demonstration to prove that their intercourse with the
servants was a very improper one. Several other cases might be
recorded, in which the female branches of families have suffered
from having a man in the establishment, or acting as a confidential
servant; and in several instances consequences of that kind have
taken place, not from such individuals acting as schoolmasters or
clerks, or in any capacity of that description, but where
intercourse has taken place between the common farm servants and
the children. The two girls mentioned were supposed to have been
corrupted by a female convict servant; she was made a kind of
companion for them, to wait upon them and walk about with them. The
conduct of the female servants generally is very depraved; they are
seldom to be trusted, are generally extremely insolent and idle,
and neglect their duty on every possible occasion."</p>
<p>Judge Therry, writing on this subject, says:&mdash;"The female
convicts were a far worse infliction on the free portion of the
community than the male convicts. Many of the latter were
transported for slight offences; but females were seldom sent out
whilst any reasonable hope remained of reforming them at home. The
mingling of an abandoned set of women with men of kindred stamp in
the colony may be easily imagined. Like the male convicts, they
were assigned to private service, but very rarely indeed was a
sober and well conducted servant to be got amongst them. Some of
them, however, on getting married to steady husbands, became
reformed; but if the cessation of transportation brought no greater
blessing with it to New South Wales than the discontinuance of
sending out all the profligate women of England to Australia, the
discontinuance was unquestionably a great boon. There was the same
inattention to classification and to the placing them in suitable
situations, and to the provision for them of religious instruction,
as has already been adverted to in the case of male criminals."</p>
<p>I would gladly have passed all this part of the horrible story
over, and have covered up the sickening details from public gaze;
but the story must be told, and I have preferred to let those tell
it who were surrounded by its living characters, and who gave their
evidence on oath before the English Commissioners appointed by the
House of Commons to discover the truth. And the reader may judge
what a frightful state of things existed when he learns that I have
suppressed the worst part of the evidence given before the
Commissioners, bearing upon this phase of the convict system. If
all were given, it would form, not a chapter merely, but a whole
book of horrors.</p>

OFFENDERS&mdash;REBELLIONS&mdash;REMODELLING THE
INSTITUTION&mdash;- CHOOSING A WIFE&mdash;ILLEGITIMATE
CHILDREN&mdash;AN INTERESTING PROBLEM.</p>
<p>THE reader will gather from what has already been written that
the Female Factory at Parramatta formed a central figure in the
convict system. It was intended as a penitentiary&mdash;a place of
punishment where, according to the nature of their offences, the
women could be either placed in solitary confinement, with bread
and water, or employed in picking wool or <i>breaking stones.</i>
Some of the women were sent to Moreton Bay, but the Parramatta
Factory was the chief penitentiary for them, although the labour
imposed there being generally very slight, many of the women
preferred being sent there to being assigned to private
service.</p>
<p>Those who were with child were generally sent from their service
to the Factory when near the period of their confinement, and they
were placed in a separate class, intermediate between those who
were confined for punishment and those who were waiting to be
assigned. This class was a very numerous one, as may be seen from
the statement that in 1839 out of 590 females in the factory 108
were nursing children, and a large portion of the remainder were
about to become mothers; at the same time there were in the factory
136 children between the ages of one and three years, the
illegitimate offspring of convicts. The factory was, therefore,
more a lying-in hospital than a penitentiary.</p>
<p>There were also penitentiaries in Hobart Town and Launceston
(Van Diemen's Land), but there were conducted on a more rigorous
scale than the one at Parramatta. The punishment was more severe,
and the females were kept busy spinning, picking wool, and at
needlework.</p>
<p>The conduct of the women at the Parramatta Factory was grossly
indecent and disorderly. Organized riots were frequent, and the
place was described as a perfect pandemonium. The management up to
the year 1830 was very defective, but after that date changes in
the administration took place which had the effect of remedying
existing evils to a considerable extent. Rev. Dr. Ullathorne stated
that when he was engaged in imparting religious instruction to one
class he had sometimes been interrupted in the midst of his
exhortations by such yelling and obscene language and quarrelling
in the neighboring ward that he had been compelled to stop; and on
one occasion he was interrupted for twenty minutes before he could
find anyone to quell the disorder. So great did the disorder become
at times that the military had to be called in to quell it, and
even they came in for some rough handling. On one occasion when
they appeared they were pelted with stones by the women, and not
caring to fire upon their assailants the soldiers hit upon the
happy expedient of returning the fire of the women after its kind,
hurling stones at them so effectively as to drive them back to
their own apartments. One story is told of a soldier who attempted
to restore order being seized by the viragos and carried into their
own apartment, where they tied his hands and feet, stripped every
particle of clothing off him, and then beat him all over with
bunches of stinging nettles.</p>
<p>Like every other convict establishment, the Factory was a
progressive institution. Founded in the first instance as a sort of
temporary "home" for the wretched creatures who were legally
ostracised from the respectable portion of their sex, it rapidly
became the breeding place of every imaginable abomination&mdash;a
very seed-plot of immorality and crime. The following extracts from
a letter written by the Rev. Samuel Marsden to Governor Macquarie
in 1815 will give the reader some idea of the character of the
place and of the condition of affairs in the town of Parramatta at
that time:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I feel it my duty as principal chaplain and resident magistrate
in this district, to submit to your Excellency's serious
consideration the present state of Parramatta and its
neighbourhood, so far as it relates to its public morals and
police. During more than twenty years' residence in this town, I do
not remember any former given period when so many offences were
committed against the peace as there have been for some time past.
Housebreaking, highway robberies and other daring crimes have
increased to a very alarming degree. Nearly the whole of my time,
from morning till evening, has been occupied for some weeks in
examining the different complaints preferred before me.</p>
<p>"The first observation I shall make relates to the male
convicts, a number of whom are employed by the Crown at Parramatta
as mechanics, and in various other public situation. These men have
no barracks or huts provided for them by the Crown, as formerly,
where they can dress their provisions and sleep at night, and be
placed under the immediate eye of the police. On this account
numbers of them are scattered all over the town and neighbourhood,
and procure lodgings where and as they can amongst the lower order
of free people who live upon their vices and become their
protectors on all occasions. It generally happens that these free
people, when any theft is committed, will, either through fear or
interest, cautiously conceal every circumstance within their
knowledge that would criminate the guilty who lodge in their
houses, and by whose frauds, impositions and thefts they are
maintained. The convicts in the employment of the Crown being at
full liberty in the night to commit any depredations with impunity,
in consequence of having no settled residence, thereby form such
plans to prevent detection as no act or cunning of man can unravel.
Hence the magistrate is daily compelled to discharge persons
accused before him of various offences for want of evidence, though
the most satisfactory conviction of their guilt arises in his mind.
There are 75 convicts employed at the public works at Parramatta,
under the superintendence of Mr. Rouse, very few of whom have any
place whatever to lodge in; and they that have not, being more than
60 in number, pay for their lodging and fire, which at a moderate
estimate, cannot amount to less than from &pound;10 to &pound;15 per week. This
sum they have little means to obtain, but by theft, as few persons
in Parramatta have any work for them to do, when they have
performed the work assigned them by the Government.</p>
<p>"A second cause of the moral and political state of Parramatta
and its neighbourhood is the miserable situation of the female
convicts in the service of the Crown and employed at the Government
Factory. Numbers of these women are of the most infamous and
abandoned character, composed of the very dregs of the whole
colony, being principally collected from the gaol at head quarters,
and all the different districts throughout the whole settlement.
Many of them are a terror to the better part of society. I need not
state to your Excellency that these female convicts have no more
accommodation provided for them than the male convicts. During the
night these women spread themselves through all the town and
neighbourhood of Parramatta, and some of them are glad to cohabit
with any poor wretched man who can give them shelter for the night.
From the best information I can obtain many of these females pay
four shilling a week for their lodging and fire. Few of them have
any means excepting prostitution to obtain this sum, and hence the
male convicts weekly rob and plunder either Government or private
individuals to supply the urgent want of the females who are
devoted to their pleasure. If this were not the case the females
would be left entirely destitute, for the lower order of free
settlers neither could nor would supply them with lodgings, and
other conveniences to dress their food, unless they could
remunerate them to their satisfaction. The extreme illicit commerce
carried on under these circumstances between the male and the
female convicts is destructive of all religion, morality, and good
order, and destroying at once the most distant hope of any
reformation being produced in either. Nothing can be more
distressing to the seriously reflecting mind than to see the vices
and miseries of these abandoned females.</p>
<p>"I have further to remark, that these women having no settled
residence provided for them, they have no proper means of taking
care of their weekly ration, and on this account their provisions
are frequently stolen from them, so that many have nothing to eat
for two or three days towards the latter end of the week; therefore
they are urged by the calls of hunger to steal or do things
worse.</p>
<p>"When I was in England in the year 1808, I represented to her
Majesty's Government the profligate state of the female convicts at
the time I left the colony, which was owing at that time in a great
measure to the want of a barrack for their reception, where the
good could be separated from the bad, and an opportunity afforded
to all those who wished to redeem their characters and return to
the paths of virtue. I was assured by those in authority that this
serious evil should be remedied by barracks being provided for them
... .. Seven years have now elapsed since that period, and your
Excellency is well aware that no provision has yet been made for
the female convicts to this very day, and that they are still
exposed to the same ruinous temptations and hardships as formerly,
with this difference only, that the evils have increased to the
public in proportion to the increased number of females sent out
from Europe.. ..</p>
<p>"There is another serious evil I wish to state to your
Excellency, in consequence of the female convicts being at large in
the night to indulge their vicious habits and passions. There is
scarcely one female convict that will go quietly into the service
of the most respectable family in the colony.</p>
<p>"It generally happens that when female convicts are ordered into
the service of private individuals by the magistrate they will in
the most positive and open manner refuse to obey his orders, and
will sooner live upon bread and water in a solitary cell than leave
Parramatta, the scene of their sensual gratifications, till they
weary out, by length of time, the patience of the magistrate, and
he knows not what measures to adopt to support his judicial
authority, and to carry his necessary orders into execution. Hence,
instead of the Government Factory being a House of Correction for
the abandoned females and a benefit to the colonists and other
inhabitants, as a check upon public vices, it becomes the grand
source of all moral corruption, insubordination, and disease, and
spreads its pestilential influence throughout the most remote part
of the colony. On this account there is not a bushel of maize or
wheat in the farmer's barn, nor a sheep in his fold, nor a hog in
his stye, nor even a potatoe, turnip or cabbage in his garden, but
what he is liable to be robbed of every night he lies down in his
bed, either by his own or his neighbour's servants, to supply the
wants of these abandoned women, to whom the men can gain access at
all times in the night, and nothing can prevent them while the
women are at large.</p>
<p>"The number of women employed at the factory under Mr. Oakes,
the superintendent, is 150. They have 70 children, and there is not
any room in the factory that can be called a bedroom for the women
and children. There are only two rooms and these are both occupied
as workshops; they are over the gaol, and are about 80 feet long
and 20 wide. In these rooms there are 46 women daily
employed&mdash;twenty spinning wool upon the common wheel, and
twenty-six carding; there are also in them the warping machine,
&amp;c., belonging to the Factory. These rooms are crowded all day,
and at night such women sleep in them as are confined for recent
offences, amongst the wheels, wool and cards, and a few others who
have no means whatever of procuring a better abode. The average
number of women who sleep in the Factory is about 30 on the whole.
Many of these women have little and some no bedding; they all sleep
on the floor; there is not a cradle or bedstead belonging to the
Factory. I do not deem it either safe or prudent that even 30 women
should sleep in the Factory which has been crowded all day with
working people, could this be avoided, as the air must be bad and
contagious. Were the magistrate to compel even half the number of
women with their children to sleep in the Factory which belong to
it, they could not exist. Not less than 120 women are at large at
night to sleep where they can. Many of them have to pay 4/- per
week for lodgings and fire; they have no means but theft and
prostitution to obtain this sum, and these vices are become so
common and habitual that the women will tell the magistrate that
they have no other means to supply their necessities.</p>
<p>"There are 150 women and 33 men employed at the Factory under
Mr. Oakes and 75 men under Mr. Rouse, at the lumber yard, as
mechanics, &amp;c. I have not included in this statement the
constables, the convicts employed in his Majesty's stores, nor the
men and women servants at the general hospital, who are equally
unprovided for.</p>
<p>"I might further notice that many of the male and female
convicts are much addicted to inebriety, and that the great number
of licensed houses to sell spirituous liquors considerably
increases the number of crimes. There are on the whole, under the
two principal superintendents, Messrs. Oakes and Rouse, one hundred
and eight men, one hundred and fifty women, and seventy children,
and nearly the whole of them have to find lodgings for themselves,
when they have performed their government task."</p>
<p>The Governor replied to this letter, stating that three years
previously he had written to England, asking permission to have the
necessary buildings erected, but had not up to that time received a
reply.</p>
<p>It may be fitting here to mention that the relationship between
the Governor and Rev. Samuel Marsden was not of the most cordial
character. The parson wanted to override the Governor, and there
was consequently not infrequently undignified collision. Mr.
Marsden wrote to head quarters and made a series of complaints
against the Governor's administration. In one communication to the
Home Government the Governor pointed out that Rev. S. Marsden had
refused to put into force in his district an order which he had
issued concerning the muster of convicts every Sunday morning, with
the result that much more profligacy and depravity existed amongst
the convicts there than in any of the other districts. The
clergyman-magistrate was supported by three gentlemen who, said the
Governor, "are notorious throughout the colony for being very
severe, arbitrary masters, and embroiled constantly in quarrels
with their servants, whom they are frequently dismissing on the
most frivolous pretences." And His Excellency summed up
thus:&mdash;"Some years ago, for the express purpose of preventing
severe punishments from being inflicted in the interior districts
by the magistrates, I directed them to send me quarterly returns of
all persons confined, tried and punished by their authority. These
returns are now regularly made, and on comparing one with the
other, in those received from Rev. Mr. Marsden, as senior
magistrate at Parramatta, I have invariably found that the
punishments inflicted by his authority are much more severe than
those of any other magistrate in the colony. In proof of this
extraordinary severity I take the liberty of transmitting herewith,
for your Lordship's notice, an extract from his return for the last
quarter."</p>
<p>The end of it was that the following Government and General
Order appeared in the <i>Sydney Gazette:</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Government House Sydney,</p>
<p>"28th March, 1818.</p>
<p>"CIVIL DEPARTMENT.</p>
<p>"His Excellency the Governor is pleased to dispense with the
services of the Rev. Samuel Marsden, as Justice of the Peace and
Magistrate at Parramatta and its adjoining district.</p>
<p>"By his Excellency's Command,</p>
<p>"J. T. Campbell, Secretary."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reverend gentleman was known amongst the convicts
throughout the colony, and especially those who resided within the
district over which he had jurisdiction as a magistrate, as "The
Flogging Parson." As the reader may wish to know more about him, I
may as well give here a short piece of history from Bennett. Here
is what that writer says about him:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The Church of England Establishment, before the termination of
Macquarie's rule, consisted of no less than nine ministers. Some of
them, like Mr. Cowper and Mr. Cartwright, were gentlemen eminently
qualified for the position which they occupied, and laboured
zealously in the cause of religion; while others were so much
engrossed in worldly pursuits that their sacred duties occupied
very little of their time or attention. New South Wales was at that
period nominally part of the Indian diocese, of which the
celebrated Heber was then bishop, but practically the Rev. Samuel
Marsden was head of the Church in the colony, and was usually
called Bishop Marsden. This gentleman occupied a very conspicuous
place for many years as a magistrate, a settler, and a trader, as
well as a minister of religion, and probably the character of few
men, in any age of the world, has been pourtrayed in such various
and contradictory colours as his. He arrived in New South Wales in
1794; was a man of most active and energetic character, but
unpopular in the highest degree with the emancipists and those who
espoused their cause. Mr. Wentworth, in his work on the colony
characterises him as a reverend hypocrite; a crafty, turbulent, and
ambitious priest; a man of the most rancorous and vindictive
spirit, whose character as a magistrate was stamped with severity,
whose sentences exceed, both in length and rigour, those of any two
magistrates in the colony; and who had uniformly set his face
against every philanthropic object; who had opposed the education
and civilization of the aborigines, and who, during a period of six
years, had never once visited the institution established for their
benefit, although it was next door to his own residence; and who
had opposed the institution of Sunday Schools, and of every means
proposed for the education and amelioration of the condition of the
poor. On the other hand, Mr. Marsden was spoken of by his friends
and admirers as one of the most admirable and sainted characters
the world had ever seen; he was, said one of them, 'in humility a
child, in vigour of mind and benevolence an angel; full of
enterprise for the good of mankind, and full of faith and reliance
on the Divine promises; unborn empires are dependent on his
exertions, and his name will be the theme of the new world, so long
as there is a heart to feel reverence or a tongue to utter praise.'
Another eulogist (Mr. Wilberforce), in his place in the British
Parliament, said Mr. Marsden was 'a man who had acquired the
admiration of all who knew his merits&mdash;a man who shone as a
bright example in the moral world; who deserved the title of a
moral hero, who had overcome difficulties for the amelioration of
his species in the most unfavourable circumstances, which would
always endear his name to the friends of virtue and humanity.' It
will be a sufficient explanation of these widely-ranging estimates
on Mr. Marsden's character to state that he was regarded in the
colony as the representative of one section of the
community&mdash;the dominating class, afterwards contemptuously
called the 'pure merinos.' The more the virtues of such a man were
trumpeted by his friends&mdash;the more they held him up to
reverence and admiration&mdash;the more he became a mark for the
arrows of his opponents; and it is fair to conclude that he was
neither such a saint as his friends painted him, nor such a sinner
as his enemies professed to believe. As a representative of his
class&mdash;the official oligarchy&mdash;and as a man who meddled
in everything, he necessarily made many and bitter enemies. He took
a strong stand against Governor Macquarie's policy in favour of the
emancipists, and after two or three persons of that class had been
raised to the magistracy, he took occasion on the Governor's
interfering with his magisterial proceedings by releasing, before
the expiration of their sentences, some prisoners whom he had tried
and sentenced&mdash;to tender his resignation of his office as a
Justice of the Peace. Macquarie however refused to accept it, but
at once issued a general order dispensing with his services.
Henceforth, of course, there was war between Macquarie and
Marsden&mdash;the latter declaring that 'as he had been driven by
the Governor into a corner, he had thrown away the scabbard, and
would never give in till he had gained redress.' Mr. Commissioner
Bigge, who takes Mr. Marsden's part in this matter, suggests that
Macquarie, in addition to the irreconcilable difference between
them on the subject of raising certain persons, who had been
convicts, to places of rank and confidence, acted on a suspicion
that while Mr. Marsden was receiving his hospitality and
attentions, and living upon terms of cordiality and friendship with
him, he was secretly and by indirect means and annonymous letters,
denouncing his administration to Lord Bathurst.'</p>
<p>"Mr. Marsden, in addition to being a partizan of the dominant
clique, rendered himself liable to have the purity of his motives
as a minister of religion impeached on account of the zeal with
which he followed his farming and trading pursuits, and the
persistency of his efforts to acquire wealth. One of the
circumstances, however, which most contributed to render him
unpopular, reflected the highest credit upon his character as a
clergyman. This was his fearless denunciation at all times, and
under almost all circumstances, not only of everything like open or
unblushing vice, but even of a disregard for the proprieties of
society on the part of those whose position in life should have
taught them the necessity of setting a good example to those below
them. The following extract from his life by Rev. J. B. Marsden
will illustrate his course of action on such matters:&mdash;"He has
been known to rebuke sin at a dinner-table in such a manner as to
electrify the whole company. Once, arriving late, he sat down in
haste, and did not for a few moments perceive the presence of one
who should have been the wife of the host, but who stood in a very
different relation to him. Mr. Marsden always turned a deaf ear to
scandal, and in the excess of his charity was sometimes blind to
facts which were evident enough to others. The truth now flashed
upon him, and though such things were little thought of in the
colony, he rose instantly from the table, calling to the servant in
a decided tone to bring his hat, and without further ceremony, or
another word, retired.' His integrity as a man of business was
unimpeachable, but his secular pursuits were clearly incompatible
with the duties of a minister of religion. The most serious charge
against him&mdash;that he trafficked in spirituous liquors&mdash;he
answered in terms which will probably be considered satisfactory or
the reverse, according to the reader's view of his character: "In
the infancy of the colony, previous to my arrival, barter was
established among all classes, from the Governor downwards. As
there was neither beer nor milk, tea nor sugar, to be purchased at
any price, wine and spirits became the medium of exchange. As the
colony progressively advanced in agriculture, commerce, and wealth,
barter gradually decreased, and money transactions became more
general. I can affirm that for the last eighteen years I have not
had in my possession as much spirits as would allow my servants
half a pint a head per week. And at no period of my residence did I
ever purchase spirits for sale.'"</p>
<p>So much for one of the leading colonists and clergymen of
Australia of the early days. In making his name my theme I cannot
say that I feel at all disposed to offer either reverence or
praise. He died in 1838 a very wealthy man.</p>
<p>Returning to the Parramatta Female Factory, from which Parson
Marsden has caused us for a moment to turn aside, let us see what
character it bore in later years. A magistrate of the territory,
when before the Select Committee of the House of Commons in
1837&mdash;some twenty-two years after the descriptive letter I
have quoted was written&mdash;gave the following
evidence:&mdash;</p>
<p>"When a convict ship arrives with females they are assigned to
as many settlers or emigrants as apply. It is generally announced
in the <i>Gazette,</i> and they apply, and then the women who are
not applied for are forwarded to the Factory. The factory is a very
large building, something like the poor houses here (England) an
excellent building, with a large garden attached to it, and
court-yard; and there the women remain until applied for as
assigned servants or wives. I have known some of the sailors who
have come out in the ship with a convict woman and taken a fancy to
her, get married immediately: there is no time required. Of those
convict women who are employed by the settlers and others, if any
behave ill, they are brought before a bench of magistrates, and
punished according to the offence; but they have no other mode of
punishing them than sending them to what they call the third class
of the Factory, and they send them from one month to 12 months; I
have never known twelve months exceeded. In the third class they
are more strictly kept; they are not allowed to be sent out or
assigned again until their sentences have expired, and they have
different food; but after the time is out they are then removed to
the second class, and remain there a short time, when they come
back to the first class. No women are allowed to be assigned or
marry except those in the first class. In August, 1836, there were
234 women if the third class; 108 women nursing children, they
having been returned to the Factory by their masters just before
the birth of the children. It is a common joke in Sydney that it is
not a Factory, but a lying-in-hospital. There were 600 in the
Factory in the month named, and only 93 of them were assigned and
waiting to be withdrawn, and 79 assignable. Female servants do not
dread being sent to the Factory&mdash;the very reverse, they court
it! It is a common practice, if a convict woman is assigned to a
master she does not like, and particularly in the country, that she
does everything she possibly can to annoy the master and the
mistress: and she makes use of the most horrid language, and
generally finishes by saying; 'Why do you not send me to the
Factory? You know how to get rid of me; I do not like your place,'
and other language that I should not like to repeat. The master is
frequently compelled to take the woman to the bench of magistrates
and charge her with insolence, or that she will not do any work,
and then the magistrate passes sentence, that she is to be confined
on bread and water for a certain number of days; and they are very
insolent when the magistrate passes sentence. I have been obliged
to threaten to gag them (but have never done it) they have made use
of such horrid language, and some of them very young indeed. The
magistrates ask the master 'Do you wish to have this woman
returned, or to get rid of her?' and some say 'I wish to have her
returned;' and after being confined so many days in a cell she is
returned, much against her will; but if the master does not wish to
have her, again she is sent to a cell where she is kept for a
certain time in solitary confinement, and then returned to the
Government. I remember particularly one very young woman indeed. I
had sentenced her to 10 day's solitary confinement on bread and
water, and said to her, 'You appear a very young woman and I shall
therefore be very lenient with you.' I was sitting in this sort of
way, with my hand over my eyes; and I suppose she did not fancy
that I saw her; she turned round and actually spat upon her master.
I then said 'You appear to be, though young, a very abandoned
woman, and I shall give you 30 days instead of 10 on bread and
water.' She then said 'Oh, thank you, I am much obliged to your
Worship; 30 days! I am very fond of an odd number, would you be
kind enough to indulge me, and make it 31 days? Do, your worship! I
should like to have thirty-one.' I could not give her more than 30
and she knew that well; this was done merely to insult me."</p>
<p>When Judge Therry was Attorney-General he had frequent
opportunities of studying the character of the Factory "girls," and
this is the testimony he gives concerning them:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Their violence at times was excessive. They destroyed often the
furniture of their cells, broke plates and dishes, and threw
everything provided even for their own convenience over the
prison-yard. This is not a matter for surprise, when one considers
that between 400 and 500 of the most abandoned women of the empire
were huddled together, like felons in a gaol, but from regard to
their sex under less rigorous restraint. Occasionally their
outrageous conduct assumed the character of a rebellion on a small
scale. The sort of miscellaneous work that devolves upon an
Attorney-General in the colony may be imagined from the following
Memorandum, on which, during my tenure of that office, I was called
upon to decide:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Memorandum for the Attorney-General.</p>
<p>The women in the Factory continue in a disorderly state and
those in the cells break everything that is given to them for their
convenience. The police magistrate (who will probably apply to you)
wishes to know how far he will be authorised in putting them in
handcuffs or irons. He also wishes to know how far he may be
justified in using violence against the women when they themselves
are violent, or making attempts to escape.&mdash;G.G.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Local Act for the punishment of female felons did not
authorise their being put in irons; and though it did, I certainly
should have been loath to advise the putting of manacles on the
ankles of these bold Amazons. I ventured to suggest that the
keeping of the ladies on bread and water for three days, which the
Local Act sanctioned, would probably be the best mode of starving
the garrison into a surrender. The case, however, soon became very
urgent. There was threatening of <i>'Bella, horrida bella.'</i> The
besieged warriors menaced the demolition of the Factory, and
threatened to use up the matron and her small band of assistants as
materials for a bonfire. In this dilemma, without waiting for the
application of the Sangrado remedy I had suggested, recourse was
had to an ingenious though not successful method of frightening
them. Accordingly a sergeant's guard from the Grenadier company of
the regiment in town were marched into the gaol yard of the
Factory. It was supposed that the sight of formidable fur caps,
loaded muskets, with mounted bayonets, would frighten the besiegers
half out of their wits. No such thing!&mdash;the party of soldiers
engaged in this strange service were told (instructions which the
brave fellows little needed) that, though they might carry muskets,
they were to use none. As soon as they entered the gaol-yard of the
Factory, the insurgents, undaunted by their presence, and pretty
confident, no doubt, that the military party would not touch a hair
of their heads, commenced a volly of stones and staves from their
broken-up furniture. In a few minutes the 'Battle of the Amazons'
was fought (the only fighting being on their side), and won by the
women. The soldiers fled laughing and scampering back to their
barracks, and left the conquerors in possession of the field. The
retreat of the Federal Army at Bull's Run was not more rapid. Other
measures, however, were resorted to; a strong body of police,
without using unnecessary violence, got possession of the place;
the ringleaders were picked out and punished; a reduction in the
supply of the little comforts allowed them, in a few days, broke
the strength and spirit of the combination; and all again was
peace."</p>
<p>The severest form of punishment to which the unruly members of
this wretched sisterhood were subjected was solitary confinement in
the cells, with only bread and water diet, and having their heads
shaved. In some of the old court records which have passed through
my hands the leaves are plentiful which carry the account of women
convicted, and the laconic sentence at the foot of the record
"Seven days cells, bread and water, and to have head shaved." And
there was more, in this shaving than appears at first sight.
Building operations were being carried on with vigour to meet the
demands of the growing population. Mortar was needed to connect the
bricks or stones, and hair was needed to make the mortar "strong."
Horses and cattle and goats were too scarce to furnish the
requisite supply, and the hair from the heads of the Factory girls
became a marketable commodity. The Government officials found a
ready sale for it by the pound, the builders and plasterers being
the purchasers; and there are buildings still standing in
Parramatta and Sydney, the mortar and plaster of which was made
"strong" by human hair.</p>
<p>In 1839 the Factory was remodelled, extensive alterations and
additions being made, under the order of Governor Gipps. The number
of cells was increased to 72, and they were built on the plan of
the American separate system. The total cost was &pound;3,767, and the
Governor reported that under a new Act that was passed for the
better regulation of the female prisons, order, cleanliness,
perfect obedience, and silence prevailed in the establishment to a
degree scarcely surpassed in any prison in England. His Excellency
also endeavoured to find profitable employment for the women, first
introducing the dressing and manufacture of New Zealand flax, and
net making there from, but the venture did not pay, and the
manufacture was given up. He also tried the manufacture of articles
of needlework for sale, and Lady Gipps and her housekeeper
personally superintended the work; but as the sales did not realize
more than &pound;30 in three months, that also was given up. He then
caused a return to the old plan of taking in needlework for the
public, and reported that the result was very satisfactory,
although not more than sufficient work to keep one-third of the
women employed could be procured. The average receipts were about
&pound;700 per annum. As an encouragement to the women the Governor
allowed one-sixth part of all the money earned by them to be
retained by them; but it was only the well-conducted prisoners who
received this, as the others were not allowed to work for the
public in this way, being kept at other work, for which no payment
was made. Two classes of needlewomen were thus created, and they
were rewarded or degraded by being passed from one class to the
other. The first class consisted of about 129 women, divided into
parties of nine, ten, or eleven, each woman in a party being
responsible for the good conduct of the whole. The washing also for
the military barracks and hospital at Parramatta was done at the
Factory, and washing was also taken in for the public. His
Excellency also introduced the manufacture of straw hats and
bonnets, but at the time he made his report it had not proved
profitable. The only other employment for the women in the Factory
was the picking of oakum, which was not bad work for those who were
either unskilful or sullen; but owing to the difficulty of
procuring a sufficient supply the whole of the profit was
absorbed.</p>
<p>The number of female convicts in the Factory on 1st October,
1840, was 847, and the number of children 364. The number of women
in the Factory on 1st October, 1839, was 970, and referring to
this, Sir George Gipps in his despatch writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The rapid increase in 1838 and 1839 is principally to be
attributed to the long-continued drought, and consequent dearness
of provisions which prevailed in the colony during the greater part
of those years; but it is in part also to be accounted for by the
progress of the immigration of free women into the colony, and the
diminished demand for female convict servants consequent thereon.
An increase of from 50 to 60 may also be accounted for by the
breaking up of the female establishment at Moreton Bay; and some
further increases may be ascribed to the greater caution with which
women are now assigned to private service, and especially in
Sydney. After October, 1839, the number began sensibly to decrease,
and in June last was reduced to 713; the arrival, however, of two
female convict ships in July and August caused it again to
increase; and I feel bound to state, that unless the transportation
of women to New South Wales be discontinued, the number in the
Factory are, in my opinion, likely further to increase rather than
diminish.</p>
<p>"Your Lordship will probably be surprised at the number of
children in the Factory, but I regret to say that I have it not in
my power to reduce it. Formerly, children on attaining the age of
three years were removed from the Factory to the Orphan Schools,
and thence forward maintained at the expense of the colony, but our
orphans schools have recently been so filled with the children of
immigrants, that it is no longer in my power to dispose of the
children of convicts in that way. In my despatch of 13th February
last I reported to your Lordship that out of one emigrant ship
alone (the North Britain) 27 children had been sent to our orphan
schools. All the children above one year old in the Factory are
made to attend an infant school within the establishment, an
arrangement which is producing good effects.</p>
<p>"The arrival of a female convict ship does not always cause an
immediate increase in the number of women in the Factory, as there
is generally a demand for them for private service, it being
preferred to take a woman (according to the local expression) from
the ship, rather than from the Factory. But many people in Sydney
take women in this way only on trial, with the intention of sending
them to the Factory if not useful, or if found useful, of keeping
them instead of others already in their service, and of returning
these others to the Factory. Women who bring children with them to
the colony are the only ones who go direct to the Factory; in the
course, however, of less than a year, most of them find their way
thither, and not a few of them in a state of pregnancy. For these
reasons, as well as for other obvious ones, I have been anxious to
abolish the assignment of women in Sydney; but the apprehension of
overcrowding the Factory has hitherto prevented me from doing
so."</p>
<p>On 27th April, 1841, Sir George Gipps received a reply from
Downing-street, which contained this closing sentence:&mdash;"As
transportation to New South Wales has now ceased, the number of
female convicts in the Factory will, of course, be considerably
diminished."</p>
<p>If a male convict did not marry a convict woman on the estate to
which he belonged&mdash;and only very few of them had an
opportunity of doing this&mdash;the usual mode was for him to be
allowed to get a wife from the factory at Parramatta. If a master
had a convict whom he was anxious to keep, and whom he believed to
be well-behaved, it was considered a great indulgence if he gave
him permission to get a wife from the Factory; but the master had
to enter into an agreement first obtaining permission from the
Government, to feed and support the woman, and, in fact, the
offspring, to prevent their being a burden upon the Government.
This being done the man received an order to the matron of the
Factory to supply him with a wife. There were a certain number of
women not allowed to marry, but with respect to those not under
punishment the matron would say "Turn out the women
of&mdash;&mdash;class." The women were then turned out, standing
forward in ranks like soldiers, or, more properly speaking, like
animals at a fair. This was the <i>modus operandi:</i> The convict
goes up and looks at the women and if he sees a lady that takes his
fancy, he makes a motion to her and she steps on one side.
Occasionally a woman has been known to refuse to stand out, having
no wish for the married state, but that was a very rare occurrence.
Then they have some conversation together, and if the lady is not
agreeable, or if the convict does not like the tone of her
conversation, she steps back, and the same ceremony goes on with
two or three more until the applicant is suited with a "mate."
Cases have been known where a convict has gone through between 100
and 200 "ladies" without finding one to please him. Being suited,
however, with one of the fair creatures placed at his disposal he
straightway takes her off and gets married. Returned to his master
the pair knock up a hut for themselves, where they live together
when the man is at work. The master generally allowed what was
called half a ration for the wife, in addition to the man's ration.
It was no uncommon thing for free men in the early days to go to
the Factory and choose wives after the same fashion as that
followed by the convicts.</p>
<p>The married life on the master's estate was not always one of
felicity, especially if the husband were of a jealous temperament;
for when he was at work his wife would seek "company," and was not
above bestowing her favours upon others. In many cases the husbands
have been known to allow the thing as a regular trade, and they
have been known to boast that they kept two bags behind the door,
one for tea and the other for sugar, and these they expected their
wives to keep filled. Full bags appeased their jealousy and
generally purchased peace!</p>
<p>On the subject of convict marriages, Judge Therry
says:&mdash;"It was not until the convict element was expelled that
marriage became universally to be regarded as an honourable estate.
During the early period of the settlement, and even up to the time
of my arrival (1829), this ceremony was not regarded as an
indespensable preliminary to the union of man and woman. The
indifference with which convicts often, on becoming free, chose
their partners for life, 'for better or worse,' (it rarely was for
better), was frequently shewn by their taking a wife as it were 'on
view.' They resorted to the Female Factory, where two or three
hundred female convicts belonging to the first and second classes
then were imprisoned, and on no more formal courtship than bare
inspection the marriage contract was concluded. Passes were
sometimes given by magistrates to ticket-of-leave holders 'to go to
the Female Factory to choose a wife.' The business was sometimes
transacted in three days; one day for the journey to the Factory to
make a choice; the second for the courtship and ceremony; the third
back again to the station with the <i>bride.</i> Forgeries and
ingenious frauds were often resorted to in order to induce
unsuspecting ministers of religion to marry parties whose wives or
husbands were still living at home. Take for instance the case of a
married man who had been transported and left a wife and two
children in the city of Cork. On becoming free he wished to take a
wife unto himself in the colony. He was aware that the zealous
minister to whose flock he belonged knew of his social position;
so, in order to overcome this difficulty, the fellow produced a
letter&mdash;the Cork postmark being well imitated in red ink on
the corner of the envelope. The letter and postmark were both
forged in Sydney. The letter, purporting to be from his brother in
Ireland, amongst other plausible statements to induce the worthy
clergyman to believe that the wife at home was dead, concluded with
the assurance that the 'dear wife,' of the party to whom the letter
was addressed 'died in the bosom of the Holy Roman Catholic and
Apostolic Church!' The caitiff in this last sentence struck the
keynote that he knew would sound most agreeably on the ear, and
reach the heart of the worthy minister, whom that well-acted piece
of hypocricy induced to tie the marital knot."</p>
<p>The Colonial slave-driver Mudie, with that fine Scotch humour
which characterises his writings, narrates the following story, in
which he played a part:&mdash;</p>
<p>"A young fellow who had just become free, and had got himself
established on 30 acres of land, with a few pigs, &amp;c., set off
to the Factory (female convict barracks) in search of a wife. On
the way he had to pass the estate of Mudie. In conversation with
the wife of the porter, he mentioned the object of his journey. The
porter's wife advised him to pay his addresses to one of her
master's female convict servants, who she recommended as being both
sober and industrious, whereby he would at once gain a good wife,
and spare himself an additional journey of 140 miles. The young
woman was sent for, and consented at once. When ensued the
following dialogue between the master and the maid:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Marianne&mdash;'I hope your honour will allow me to get
married?'</p>
<p>"His Honour&mdash;'Married! To whom?'</p>
<p>"Marianne&mdash;(rather embarrassed)&mdash;'To a young man, your
Honour.'</p>
<p>"His Honour&mdash;'To a young man? What is he?'</p>
<p>"Marianne&mdash;(her embarrassment, increasing)&mdash;'I really
don't know.'</p>
<p>"His Honour&mdash;'What is his name? Where does he live?'</p>
<p>"Marianne&mdash;'I don't know. To tell your honour the truth, I
never saw him until just now. Mrs. Parsons sent for me to speak to
him; we agreed to be married if your honour will give us leave. It
is a good chance for me.'</p>
<p>"His Honour&mdash;'Send the young man here.'</p>
<p>"(Enter Coelebs).</p>
<p>"His Honour&mdash;'Well, young man, I am told you wish to marry
Marianne, one of my convict servants. Have you observed the
condition the young woman is in? (Marianne being 'in the way that
ladies' &amp;c).</p>
<p>"Coelebs&mdash;(grinning)&mdash;'Why, your honour, as to that,
in a county like this, where women are scarce, a man shouldn't be
too greedy. I'm told the woman is very sober, and that's the main
chance with me. If I go to the factory, why, I might get one in the
same way without knowing, and that might be the cause of words
hereafter; and she might be a drunken vagabond besides. As to the
picanninny, if it should happen to be a boy, it would soon be
useful and do to look after the pigs!'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a matrimonial bureau it is questionable if any establishment
that had existence in any part of the world ever succeeded in
drawing to itself so large a number of customers. The reader can
imagine for himself, if he pleases, the business-like appearance of
this marital mart in its most flourishing days&mdash;the line of
unmarried beauties, young, middle-aged, and old, before which the
love-sick swains stood to make their choice&mdash;the features of
those swains as they critically examined the "points" of the
blushing damsels forming the regiment&mdash;the haggling between
the seekers and the sought before the final bargain was
struck&mdash;the envious glances of the least comely-looking of the
line as they saw one after another of their more fortunate
companions led from the "sampling room" to be joined in the bonds
of "holy matrimony" to the men of their choice. The picture will be
light or dark, humourous or tragical, according to the position
from which it is viewed; but to the majority I think it will
present itself as a thing of horror, the face of which should as
soon as possible be turned to the wall. Hence, to the wall I turn
its face.</p>
<p>Nearly all the female convicts who came to the colony were, for
a longer or shorter term, inmates of the Parramatta Factory. It has
been stated as a fact that of the four or five hundred women with
which the Factory was always peopled from one to two hundred were
always mothers of illegitimate children. Who is brave enough to
endeavour to work out this problem:&mdash;What became of all the
children born in the Factory year after year during its
continuance&mdash;a period of about half a century? Many of them,
we know, were fortunately separated from their mothers at a very
early age and brought up in the Orphan Schools; but I, for one, do
not care to attempt to follow them, or the hundreds (shall I say
thousands?) who left the Factory holding the hands or clinging to
the skirts of the ill-fated creatures who had brought them into the
world.</p>
<p>The Factory was kept up as a Government establishment for years
after transportation ceased.</p>

<p>THE horrors associated with the life of the male convicts in the
barracks cannot possibly be depicted. The few records that have
been kept are "official," and it would be contrary to the natural
order of things for officials to narrate facts which would have
revealed the inhuman tyranny and brutal savagery of which they were
the willing instruments, if not the actual originators.</p>
<p>For the first few years the convicts were herded in huts, under
the immediate supervision and constant guardianship of the
military, the leg irons and chains serving all the purposes of
stone walls and doubly-bolted doors. One of the first buildings
erected in the settlement was a wooden barracks for the soldiers,
but its erection was a work of time and difficulty, for, says
Barrington, "all building was retarded by the bad quality of the
wood, which was both shaky and rotten." After the barracks a guard
house was erected, but it was not until after Governor Phillip's
departure that cells were erected for solitary confinement, and a
log prison built. The huts in which the prisoners were confined at
night were rough log buildings, each containing one room, with half
a dozen recesses on each side, which recesses answered the purpose
of cells, and in each of which a prisoner was secured at night. An
armed soldier was always on duty inside each hut during its
occupancy by the prisoners, his duty being to walk back and forth
the whole night through, while the chained convicts courted sleep
on either side of him. Another soldier did duty as outside
sentinel, not for the purpose of guarding the hut from attack from
without, but as a kind of reserve force in case the convicts within
the hut became troublesome. This lonely watch formed one of the
most distasteful duties of the soldiers, and they hailed occasional
disorderliness on the part of their chained charges as an enjoyable
relief from the deep silence which generally reigned&mdash;a
silence broken only by the occasional clanking of the leg irons,
the heavy breathing of the weary sleepers, or the deep oaths from
those whose leg-weariness and heart-soreness prevented sleep.</p>
<p>The first prison that was built was 80 feet long, and was
composed entirely of logs&mdash;sides, ends, partitions, floor and
roof being of uniform thickness, and formed of varied kinds of
wood, the best available, but which best was bad. Over the logs on
the floor and the roof there was a thick layer of clay, well worked
by the hands and feet of the convicts, and a strong high fence of
logs encircled the whole building. Old men living sixty years after
the completion of this important public building invariably spoke
of a person being "put in the logs" when sent to prison. There were
twenty-two cells in this primitive establishment, and the free
inhabitants of Sydney were assessed to supply the thatch wherewith
to cover it. Attached to the gaol was a pillory, and during the
first part of Governor Hunter's rule three witnesses who had
perjured themselves when giving evidence in the Criminal Court were
sentenced to stand therein, with their ears nailed to the rostrum,
and when thus nailed they were greeted, as Barrington puts it,
"with the true English accompaniments of dirt and rotten eggs."
Doubtless, there were then no dead cats available for such use in
the colony, or these would also have been called into requisition.
At midnight on the 11th February, 1799, this gaol was burnt down,
and the authorities were convinced that the fire had been raised by
incendiaries. At the time the fire occurred there were twenty
prisoners within the log building, and as they were all heavily
ironed they were only released with considerable difficulty.</p>
<p>Arrangements were immediately made for the erection of a large
stone gaol to supply the place of the building which had been
destroyed, and as the majority of the convicts at Sydney were at
this time employed by the inhabitants, orders were issued that the
inhabitants of each division of the town must furnish five men each
day to work on the building, with a watchman to attend them. In the
same year the only other prison in the colony, that at Parramatta,
which was likewise built of logs, was also consumed by fire, and
one of the prisoners confined therein was roasted in the flames,
his irons effectually preventing escape or rescue. Rewards for the
discovery of the incendiaries in both cases were offered, but no
satisfactory information could be obtained from either convicts or
free persons, although some of the latter were supposed to know who
had done the deed. Concerning the erection of the stone gaol at
Sydney, Darrington says that as it still "wanted much of being
completed from the smallness of the sums raised to carry it on; and
as it appeared that the officers had paid &pound;40 each as an individual
share of the expense, it became requisite that some means should be
adopted to finish the building; and as the price of wheat had, at
the urgent request of the settlers, been for this season continued
at ten shillings per bushel, it was thought proper to raise a sum
for that purpose, by each leaving with the commissary sixpence for
every bushel of wheat taken to the store." This special levy was
continued until the work of erection had been completed, but as
many of the settlers declined to come forward with their
contributions another novel form of taxation was adopted by the
committee appointed to carry on the building. An order was issued
that any persons seeking a permit to land spirits, wine, beer or
other strong drink from ships having those articles on board, must
apply to the committee and give security for the payment of 1s. per
gallon on the purchase of spirits, 6d. per gallon on the purchase
of wine, and 3d. per gallon on the purchase of porter or beer,
which sums were religiously collected by the committee from the
persons giving the guarantee. Eventually the last stone of the
building was raised, and it was computed that it had cost &pound;3,954,
the greater part of which sum had been raised by the assessments
named.</p>
<p>The gaols were used chiefly as places of confinement for those
of the convicts who misbehaved themselves after reaching the
colony. The "good conduct" convicts retained in the service of the
Government were allowed to provide themselves with private
lodgings, if they could manage to earn sufficient in their own time
to pay for the luxury, and they were thus freed from the corrupting
influence of the more vicious convicts, and were seldom interfered
with by the authorities if they continued to conduct themselves
properly and duly attended "muster." Such was the state of things
until Governor Macquarie arrived and began to ride his
bricks-and-mortar hobby-horse. He was born for the stone age and
had no right to live in any other. Under his rule the colony became
a huge quarry, and those who were not stone-masons by trade were
speedily made so by necessity. Let us see how the convicts were
affected by the building craze of this energetic Governor.</p>
<p>I have already shewn how the system of payment to overseers by
the assignment to them of convicts worked. These overseers were
careful always to secure for their own use the convicts who could
earn the highest wages when hired out, and most of those assigned
to them were therefore mechanics. Having become partners with them
in money-making, the overseers were compelled to humour the men and
to relax discipline during the hours they were employed upon public
works, the result being, as stated in a previous chapter, a
considerable falling off in the amount of skilled labour performed
in the public service.</p>
<p>With the object of remedying the want of of efficient control
over the gangs employed on public works, Governor Macquarie, in
1817, introduced a system of weekly tasks, the regulation being
that when these weekly tasks were finished the men should be at
liberty to work for private persons for the remainder of the week.
The change from day labour to task work was at first hailed with
pleasure&mdash;first by the convict mechanics who had hitherto been
prevented from obtaining tickets-of-leave, because they were
skilled workmen, and, secondly, by the settlers, who had suffered
much inconvenience through the almost complete absorption of
skilled labour by the Government. Bennett, when referring to the
hardships which the most efficient mechanics had to endure from
continued service under Government, clearly shews that they were
punished for their skill rather than for their offences. He
says:&mdash;"Unskilled labourers, and other convicts of trades not
connected with buildings, had for many years previous to this been
allowed to employ themselves for their own benefit, after serving
three years of their sentence. This was even the case with those
who had been assigned to private persons; while the skilled
mechanics in the employ of the Government were kept from all hope
of liberty because their services were considered essential to the
progress of the public works, and could not be dispensed with. Even
after the expiration of the full term for which they were
transported there is reason to believe that many of these persons
were detained at forced labour because they could not prove,
without the assistance of records to which they had no means of
access, that their sentences had terminated. These circumstances
bred in the minds of persons so situated not only a strong distaste
for work, but a most unwholesome feeling of antagonism against
those who were instrumental in keeping them in such an inferior and
unfavourable position. There existed indeed amongst them what may
be termed a passive conspiracy against work. It was regarded as
disgraceful on the part of any man amongst them to do any more than
he was absolutely compelled. It was made a point of honour to do as
little as possible at all times, and under all circumstances, and
to such an extent was this carried that there was a regular system
of signs and manoeuvres by which the approach of any officer, or
other person before whom it was considered desirable that some show
of activity should be maintained, was rapidly communicated from one
part of a building or public work to another."</p>
<p>A Parliamentary paper bearing upon the same subject contains the
following paragraph:&mdash;"The labour required by the Chief
Engineer from the government convicts is in its nature purely
coercive; they derive no advantage from it, and have no interest in
improving or augmenting it; they have not even the ordinary
incentive held out to other convicts, from the hope, or rather the
expectation, of a remission of their punishment at the period at
which they are granted to others; and they are well aware that any
skill they may acquire or display in the service of government will
be the cause of their further detention in it. From the nature of
the superintendence under which it is carried on, and the
difficulty of procuring better, no accurate information is afforded
of the progress that is made........ The distribution of the
convicts in the first instance, the resumption of their services at
subsequent periods, the extension of them beyond the term assigned
to others, have contributed to create an universal impression upon
the minds of the convicts that skilfulness in work, rather than
immoral conduct, was the cause of their first enthralment, and the
measure of its continuance. This feeling produces discouragement,
carelessness, and not infrequently malicious and wanton destruction
of the property of government."</p>
<p>Under these circumstances we may well conceive that the men in
Government employ received the new regulations for task work
instead of day labour with manifestations of joy. Governor
Macquarie was strongly opposed to the change, but the amount of
work cheerfully performed under the new system was so much larger
than that wrung out from the men under the old, that he had to give
way and quietly assent to its adoption.</p>
<p>The amount of work fixed for the prisoners under the task-work
system was not by any means large. A sawyer had to cut 700 feet of
timber in the week; a labourer clearing land had to fell the timber
on one acre in the week, or to burn off sixty rods in the same
period; road gangs had to make or repair a certain length of road
in a month; stonemasons had to work up a given quantity of stone:
and every worker was similarly put on "piece-work." The number of
prisoners working "in Government" when the new system was
introduced was upwards of 2,600, those in Sydney amounting to
1,400, most of them being employed in the lumber yard and the
dockyard, in Lower George-street, and the remainder in various
localities about the city quarrying, brick-making, lime-burning,
and in other pursuits connected with building operations. The whole
of these prisoners were allowed to work under the new system, and
it was found that in most cases the men would complete their tasks
by Wednesday night, after which time they were eagerly hired by the
settlers and others at good wages. Half their time was thus at
their own disposal, and those of them who chose to work regularly
and keep steady had no cause to complain of their lot, being
frequently better off, financially, than some of their brethren who
were altogether free. But this system had not long been in
operation before multifarious evils began to flow from it. The
reader will remember that these were the day's of King Rum, and
with the liberty to earn money came the liberty to spend it. Then
followed scenes of drunkenness and rioting which night was not
asked to cover.</p>
<p>And the evil did not stop there. Another phase of the trouble
wrought by the sudden relaxation of discipline is thus described by
Bennett:&mdash;"The change in the condition of the prisoners in the
Government gangs and in the public works was so great, that the
order of things which before prevailed was soon completely
reversed. Instead of desiring to be assigned to private persons, as
had previously been the case, it became the almost universal desire
of the convicts to be 'in Government,' as they termed it. The
effect, so far as private employers were concerned, was most
disastrous. The dread of being 'returned to Government' if they
misbehaved themselves had up to this time exercised a most salutary
influence on the conduct of the prisoners in private assignment.
Most of them had always regarded a threat of that kind from their
masters with far more apprehension than the lash itself. But the
change in the system of government employment made what had long
been an object of dread, an object of desire. This altered
disposition on the part of the prisoners could only be overcome by
the granting of improper and unreasonable indulgences on the part
of the masters.</p>
<p>"Many employers, to prevent the inconvenience, and perhaps ruin,
which would follow the loss of the services of their assigned men,
were obliged to wink at their crimes, and some agreed to pay them
the same rate of wages and to allow them the same rations as their
free servants. By the convict regulations, which, of course, under
the circumstances, had the force of law, the commission of any
offence, however trifling&mdash;not merely against law but against
discipline&mdash;ensured the return of prisoners in private
assignment to gaol or to labour on the public works. The very
stringency of the regulations enabled prisoners, if so inclined, to
take advantage of them, and to such an extent was this carried, by
those who wished to be 'returned to Government,' that all
discipline was at an end, and efficient control no longer
possible."</p>
<p>Under this task-work system the mechanics in the Government
employ soon learned to "slum" their work, in order to get through
it as quickly as possible and have the more time at their own
disposal; a proceeding at which the convict overseers themselves
connived, as it enabled them to carry on private works of their own
by means of the skilled labour thus temporarily released from
public service. All attempts to cure the evil were futile. It grew
worse and worse, and at last Governor Macquarie decided to bring
the men under the barrack system, hoping by concentrating them in
one spot to bring them under more strict control and efficient
inspection. A huge building was therefore erected at the east end
of King street, Sydney, and was known for years after as Hyde Park
Barracks, even when it was turned into an Immigration Depot and
Benevolent Asylum. This building formed the "home" of about a
thousand convicts for many years, the places vacated by those who
died, or those who were assigned to private employers or who were
transported to Norfolk Island, being re-filled from the ranks of
new arrivals from England or bad conduct men who had been "returned
to Government" by the masters to whom they had been assigned. The
better behaved convicts under government suffered most under this
Barrack system, for they were compelled to herd with the most
vicious and depraved, instead of being allowed to live in private
lodgings, as formerly. The prisoners were marched to the barracks
every night and portioned off to the twelve "dormitories" within
the walls to sleep or plot mischief as they felt inclined, being
mustered in the morning and again marched off to their work in
different portions of the town.</p>
<p>The scenes that were enacted within the walls of the Barracks
will not bear description. There was a certain amount of military
regularity and discipline while the men were directly under the eye
of their custodians, but once within the sleeping apartments they
were free to indulge in every imaginable vice, provided they did so
without creating too much disturbance. Here are a few extracts from
Mr. Bigge's report, which will serve not only to throw light upon
the life of the convicts in the Barracks, but to shew the state of
affairs in the streets of Sydney. The Commissioner says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The association of so many depraved and desperate characters in
one place is an evil that is complained of even by the convicts
themselves, and although it might not have been entirely, yet it
might have been partially remedied on the opening of the convict
barracks, by placing the well conducted men in one or more of the
twelve sleeping rooms into which it is distributed. Robberies
amongst the convicts in the barracks of their clothes and bedding,
and concealment of it are very frequent; and they are encouraged in
these practices by the facilities with which they cast them over
the barrack wall to person who are ready to receive them on the
other side. To remedy these evils several expedients have been
resorted to by the chief engineer, such as searching of their
persons at the gate, and the painting of large letters and broad
arrows on different parts of the dress; and these precautions have
in some measure diminished the great losses sustained in the
clothing. It was likewise the intention of Governor Macquarie to
have surmounted the barrack wall with an iron paling, but the
erection of it was deferred on account of the high price of that
commodity, and the delay of its arrival from England.</p>
<p>"It is somewhat extraordinary that instances of violence, or of
attempts to force the gate of the barrack, should not have occurred
more frequently, considering the temptations that exist in the town
of Sydney and the general disposition to indulge in them that is
shewn by the convicts whenever they have opportunities. Absences
from it on the nights of Saturday and Sunday are frequent, and are
punished by confinement in the barrack on those days for certain
periods. With these absences are likewise combined offences
committed in the town of Sydney, of which a greater number is
always brought before the police on Mondays than on any other days
in the week.</p>
<p>"Major Druitt does not conceive that any danger to the (peace of
the) colony has arisen, or is likely to arise, from the confinement
of so many criminals in the same place. Conspiracies to cut out
vessels from the harbour, or to effect escape, are frequently made
there; but the accummulation of numbers seems rather to have
afforded means of timely detection than of the perpetration of
outrage; and the chief engineer and the superintendent have always
depended upon the treachery of accomplices for information
respecting it, and have not been deceived in that expectation. The
security, indeed, arising from the treachery of the convicts
towards each other, is common to all establishments in which they
are collected together. It is not, however, against the
perpetration of offences committed in the barrack alone that
precaution is necessary; for on marching them to and from thence,
either to work or to church, it is found very difficult to prevent
them, especially the boys, from entering houses as they go along,
and from snatching at property and secreting it. The employment of
a number of seafaring men in the navigation of the boats has also
led to the engagement of themselves and others in enterprises of
escape, and latterly in some very desperate attempts to surprise
and cut out boats and vessels in the harbours both of Port Jackson
and Hobart Town."</p>
<p>At the time this report was written there were fully 3000
convicts retained by the Government "on the roads and other public
works of the colony," and the majority of these served a longer or
shorter apprenticeship in this great seed plot of vice, not a few
giving out there last breath therein.</p>
<p>The convicts were shut up in the barracks at an early hour in
the evening, and for a little while the streets of Sydney were free
from sounds of clanking chains and shuffling convict feet. But with
the dawn of day the element of felonry in manacles was allowed its
fullest play. Early morning saw the gates of the prison thrown
open, and the convicts were marched out in regimental file and
distributed amongst the several public works in and about the town.
With downcast countenances many of them, and "hang-dog" looks not a
few, they passed along, their patchwork dress of grey and yellow
cloth branded with the Government broad arrow and numerals forming
a picture painful in its monotony, while the clanking of the chains
at their heels as they painfully shuffled forward made a most
mournful kind of music. Passing from the streets as a body they
disappeared only to appear again in other grouping&mdash;one gang
picking and shovelling, another cutting and lifting, another (and
this the saddest sight of all) yoked as a team of twenty human
beasts of burden to a waggon laden with gravel and stone, which
they dragged through the streets to spots chosen as the emptying
places. Do the thousands of free-born and independent men and women
who pass through the streets of the metropolis of New South Wales
to-day ever think that the foundations of some of the thoroughfares
over which they daily walk were liberally sprinkled with the tears
and sweat and blood of their fellow-men&mdash;in some cases,
perhaps, their forefathers? Oh! the monotonous horror of it all!
For over fifty years sights and sounds similar to those described
were of daily occurrence, but with ever-varying changes:&mdash;for
the mournful felon music was as varied as any music of ancient or
modern times, while the sights presented were ever changing also;
but neither ever ran outside the boundaries of the mournful. In
every position, in every sound, there were sorrow and darkness and
tears.</p>
<p>It was fitting that there should be a hospital in a line with
the prisoners' barracks, and only a short distance (some 300 yards)
from them; for in an enclosed yard of these barracks, shut out from
the public view by a very high brick wall, flogging was
administered. At one period the daily average number of men marched
into this yard to be flogged ranged from ten to twenty. "As I
passed along the road about eleven o'clock in the morning," says
one writer&mdash;he was speaking of the year 1830&mdash;"there
issued out of the prisoners' barracks a party consisting of four
men, who bore on their shoulders (two supporting the head and two
the feet) a miserable convict, writhing in an agony of
pain&mdash;his voice piercing the air with terrific screams.
Astonished at the sight (the writer was a recent arrival in the
colony), I asked what this meant, and was told 'it was <i>only</i>
a prisoner who had been flogged, and who was on his way to the
hospital!' It often took the sufferer a week or ten days after one
of these lacerations before he was sufficiently recovered to resume
his work, and I soon learned that what I had seen was at that
period an ordinary occurrence."</p>
<p>What wonder that good men were made bad, and bad men made worse!
What wonder that many who might have been reclaimed by gentler
means were maddened by such severity into defiance of the law! And
what took place in Sydney under well-established supervision, bad
as it was, could not compare in severity with the <i>corrective</i>
punishments inflicted at the stockades and settlements away from
the central seat of authority&mdash;where brutal men had unlimited
power. "If I have been bad, your Honour, what has been done to make
me better?" was the pathetic exclamation of a man at Norfolk Island
who was on his trial for a cold-blooded murder. The indiscriminate
use of the lash&mdash;it was "laid on" for every offence, and often
for no offence&mdash;was prolific of fearful evils. "I was once
present," says Judge Therry, "in the police-office in Sydney, when
a convict was sentenced to fifty lashes for not taking off his hat
to a magistrate as he met him on the road." With the "swish" of the
cat ever falling on his ear as it was swung through the air the
stranger in the colony may well have imagined that the object of
the British Government in establishing the penal settlement was not
to reform criminals, but to create them. The flogging yards of the
colony were in very truth flourishing manufactories of bushrangers
and murderers.</p>
<p>For many years in Sydney, after the tattoo had beat, it was
supposed that all persons had retired to their habitations and
everything was to be at rest. Persons who in the night-time went
out from one house to another were obliged to carry a light, and if
hailed by the sentinels, if they were officers or qualified people,
they were to answer by the word "Officer," and they were allowed to
pass without molestation, but a parole and countersign were every
day given out to be used in case of emergency. The sentinels were
soldiers and under constables&mdash;appointed from good-conduct
prisoners&mdash;and these paraded the streets very frequently, the
town itself having the appearance of one huge prison.</p>
<p>As shewing the punishments inflicted on prisoners "in
Government," the following statements, culled from an official
record headed "New South WALES, PUNISHMENTS commonly called the
'TORTURE PROCEEDINGS,'" will serve good purpose. At the Court of
Quarter Sessions, Parramatta, the Grand Jury on 15th August, 1825,
made their report. That Grand Jury consisted of H. H. McArthur, G.
Acres, Allan Cunningham, G. Druitt, James Macdougall, Thomas
Macdougall, George Suttor, J. Blaxland, Robert Lethbridge, G.
Blackett, Matthew Pearce, James Williamson. The report set forth
that they had performed their duties in visiting the gaol and
public buildings, and inspected the books and records of
punishment. They reported that they found warrants or orders for
punishments of a nature which called for inquiry. These were 33 in
number, and the following are taken indiscriminately from the
list:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Henry Bayne, attached to the Domain party, sentenced to receive
25 lashes every morning until he tells where the money and property
is, stolen from the house of William Jaynes, at Parramatta, by
him."&mdash;Bayne was flogged five mornings in succession, and on
the sixth day was again brought before the magistrates and ordered
to be flogged again. A month afterwards, he, still persisting in
his innocence, was again brought before the magistrates (Dr.
Douglas, Dr. Macleod, and Mr. W. Lawson) and was further punished
by transportation to Port Macquarie for 12 months. Only one witness
had appeared against the man, and it was purely a case of
suspicion.</p>
<p>2. "Richard Johnson, attached to the Government diary, sentenced
to receive 25 lashes every morning until he tells where he got a
pair of blue trousers from, being part of a robbery committed at
the garden house, Government Domain, Parramatta."&mdash;This was
signed by Magistrates Douglas, Lawson and Macleod. After receiving
his stripes Johnson accused a man named Wright, concerning whom the
following appeared on the records.</p>
<p>3. "John Wright, attached to Mr. Kenny's party, sentenced to
receive 25 lashes every second morning until he tells where he got
a pair of blue trowsers, &amp;c."&mdash;This was signed by Dr.
Macleod, J.P. Wright received his lashes to make him confess where
the other stolen property was hidden and was then transported to
Port Macquarie for five years, the warrant being signed by H. C.
Douglas, J.P.</p>
<p>4. "John McClutchy, attached to Mr. Wentworth's clearing party,
sentenced to receive 25 lashes every morning until he tells who has
harboured him during the fourteen days he has been absent from the
gang."&mdash;signed D. Macleod, J.P. After one flogging McClutchy
accused two men at Windsor, who were brought up, when he then
admitted that he had accused them for the purpose of saving his own
flesh.</p>
<p>The Grand Jury further reported that they could not find any
record of the extent to which these punishments had been carried,
and they presented the cases as acts of magisterial authority
beyond the law, "opposed to the principles of reformation and the
welfare of society." The dates of the 30 warrants ran from
December, 1822, to December, 1824, and were signed by one or other
of the magistrates named. Captain Barlow's name also appearing on
some of them.</p>
<p>Subsequently a prosecution was entered against the law-making
magistrates, for "passing indefinite and irregular sentences and
causing punishments to be inflicted contrary to law;" and a Council
enquiry was held to discover whether such practices were confined
to the triumvirate named. The inquiry proved that the "Torture"
proceedings had been in vogue from earlier than 1815 to the end of
1823, warrants having been produced bearing the signatures of the
following magistrates:&mdash;John Harris, William Lawson, Rev. S.
Marsden, H. McArthur, John Palmer, Henry G. Douglas, G. J. Palmer,
John Blaxland, Rev. M. Fulton, Rev. J. Reddal, Edward Reley, Morris
Barlow and others.</p>
<p>The Council quoted several of the warrants, among them being the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The Prisoner is sentenced to receive 25 lashes, and if he does
not lead to a discovery of the shirts by Saturday next, he is to
receive a further punishment of 50 lashes."</p>
<p>Seven days later the following entry was made:&mdash;"Not having
made the least effort to recover the shirts for the rightful owner,
and having endeavoured to implicate an innocent man, and causing
him to be apprehended and brought before a magistrate, when it
appeared he was innocent, which is since corroborated by the
prisoner's own confession, he (the prisoner) is sentenced to
receive fifty lashes, and work in double irons, <i>till the
magistrates may think proper to release him."</i></p>
<p>It is a little consoling to read the following sentences in the
Council's report:&mdash;"The Council deem it necessary also to
state, that it was made to appear very satisfactory to them from
the examination of the chief constable at Parramatta (John Thorn),
that although the number of lashes awarded by the court was not
expressed in the warrant, the chief constable, as the person
entrusted with the execution, was ordered by the presiding
magistrates, in no case, to inflict more than one hundred and fifty
lashes in the total.. .. It is also proper to state that it appears
from the examination of the chief constable, the reason for not
specifying the exact amount of punishment was to hold it in
suspense over the prisoner, and thereby induce him to make the
disclosures sought to be obtained."</p>
<p>The female convicts also suffered under this rigorous and
unlawful magisterial rule, as will be seen from the following
single record from a return made to the House of Commons in 1826,
under the head of "Papers relating to the conduct of Magistrates in
New South Wales in directing the Infliction of Punishments upon
Prisoners in the Colony:"&mdash;</p>
<p>"Bridget Rook and Margaret Murphy, prisoners, brought forward in
October, 1815, for making away with a gown belonging to Mary
Carney, Bridget Rook acknowledged to have had the gown from
Margaret Murphy, and suspected that it was stolen, and that she
gave it to Kitty White, of Sydney, for some spirits." Sentence:
<i>"Bridget Rook ordered to be chained to Margaret Murphy, and to
remain so chained until the gown is restored to its proper
owner!"</i></p>
<p>Was ever sentence more unique? Yet it is only one of many
similar recorded by the Grand Jury. Bridget and Margaret must still
be roaming somewhere linked together with a chain, for the gown was
never recovered, and sentences passed in those days were always
faithfully carried out.</p>

<p>THE convicts under the immediate charge of the Government in the
Colony were divided into those who were retained in the service of
the Government merely because they were required as laborers; those
who were returned by their masters as unfit for service; those who,
having suffered for some offence committed in the colony, were
retained for a certain period of probation in the employment of the
Government; and those who, for crimes committed in the colonies,
were worked on the roads generally in irons, or were sent to the
penal settlements.</p>
<p>Convicts in the employ of the Government were generally worse
off than those assigned as servants. They were employed chiefly on
the public works of the colony; some of them, however, in
situations of comparative ease, such as clerks, messengers,
constables, and so forth. In the evidence taken before the Select
Committee of the House of Commons in 1838 the employment of
convicts in the latter capacity was spoken of as a necessary evil.
Many of them employed as police were described as of the worst
possible character&mdash;willing to take bribes, conniving at the
offence of the convict population, when employed as scourgers
defeating the sentence of the law, sometimes falsely accusing
innocent persons of crime and at other times screening the guilty
from justice, committing outrages on female prisoners under their
charge, and frequently defeating all the efforts of the Government
to prevent crime.</p>
<p>Large parties of the convicts, called road parties, were
employed in the formation of new roads in New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land. They consisted for the most part of those who had
been returned by their masters as being unfit for service, and of
those who, having been convicted in the colony of some offence, had
been sent, on the expiration of their sentences, to work for a
certain period on the roads before they were re-assigned. The
conduct of this class of convicts was thus described by Judge
Burton:&mdash;He said that "He had been induced, by what had been
proved before him in court, gravely to consider the subject of
convicts working in gangs out of irons; it was, he felt convinced,
one of the most fruitful sources of crime in the colony. He had
before him a return from which it appeared that the number of
convicts at this time employed upon the road is 2,240, of whom
1,104 are out of irons; and when the jury considered who these
latter men were and what they had been&mdash;placed under the
guardianship of a convict overseer; that they left their huts in
any number, armed or unarmed, as they pleased; in short, from the
evidence he had upon his notes respecting the conduct of the road
parties of the colony, it would appear that these establishments
were like beehives, the inhabitants busily pouring in and out, but
with this difference, the one works by day, the other by night; the
one goes forth to industry, the other to plunder. To the
carelessness or worse conduct of overseers he did attribute a vast
proportion of the burglaries and robberies that were committed in
country districts."</p>
<p>Disorders, crimes and demoralization were attributed to these
road-parties. Composed entirely of criminals, some of them of the
very worst character, they were dispersed over a wide extent of
country, under a most incomplete and inefficient system of
superintendence. Most of the overseers and deputy overseers had
been convicts, and these had sole charge of the parties, sometimes
for many days. The road men would get in league with the convict
servants of the neighbouring settlers, upon whose property they
committed every species of depredation, and consumed the fruits
thereof in intoxication and other debauchery. Although their
condition was a more disagreeable one than that of assigned
servants, being subjected to a greater degree of restraint, and
having to break stones under a hot sun, the idle and worthless
sometimes preferred service in a party to that of assignment. After
1837 road parties out of irons were greatly lessened, and stringent
regulations were passed with the view of checking, if possible, the
demoralizing influence they exerted upon other portions of the
convict class. But there were no other means of forming roads. Free
labour was not available and as there was an ever increasing demand
for good roads the system was continued until the end, although the
system of working out of chains gradually dwindled away.</p>
<p>Mr. Macarthur proposed a plan for the better conduct of road
parties in the colony, which, if carried out, would certainly have
made the lot of the workers harder, if it did not contribute to the
improvement of their morals. His proposal was that a somewhat
similar system to that pursued at Sing-Sing, in the state of New
York, should be adopted here. At Sing-Sing, the convicts laboured
in the open country without chains either on hands or feet. They
were not allowed to speak to each other, and were compelled to work
with downcast eyes; and if in any case a prisoner was detected
looking off his work, or attempting to communicate with his fellow
prisoners, he was flogged by the overseer with a cow-hide whip in
the presence of his associates&mdash;the flogging being as severe
and long-continued as the overseer might wish, there being no
appeal against his acts. At night the men were shut up in their
separate cells. Attempts at escape were prevented by armed
sentinels, and the framers of the system considered it less
objectionable to shoot a convict than to resort to the ordinary
means by which escape could be prevented. The scheme was quite
Macarthurish.</p>
<p>Speaking of these road parties, Very Rev. Dr. Ullathorne, who as
Roman Catholic clergyman had abundant opportunities of studying the
working of the whole convict system, said:&mdash;"Their mutual
converse creates mutual corruption, until the best are levelled
down to the worst indisposition and corruption."</p>
<p>Military officers employed upon the roads and public works as
assistant engineers and superintendents of ironed gangs moved under
stringent regulations. In the discharge of his duty the officer in
charge was held strictly responsible for any act of omission by
which the escape of a convict might be rendered practicable. He
divided the men fit for duty in his detachment into three parties,
of which one, under the command of a non-commissioned officer,
proceeded with the convicts to work and furnished sentries over
them while at work and while going to and returning from it. This
duty ceased on the return of the convicts at night. A second party
took all the duties of the stockade for 24 hours, furnishing the
day and night sentries required. The third was off duty, excepting
cooks, men required to clean the barracks, and other duties of the
kind; thus giving the men two nights in bed in turn.</p>
<p>When the convicts were brought in for meals the stockade guard
furnished sentries over them, to allow the working guard time for
meals and rest. The guard mounted with loaded muskets and fixed
bayonets, each man having ten rounds of ball cartridge in his
pouch.</p>
<p>The convicts as they went out were counted over by the sergeant
of the stockade to the non-commissioned officer in charge, who gave
a receipt for the number before he quitted the place. The men were
counted again on returning. If right the receipt was cancelled; but
if any were missing steps were immediately taken to find them.
Patroles were sent out in all directions, information was given to
any justice of the peace or settler in the neighbourhood, that a
hue and cry might be raised, and reports were made on the first
opportunity to the major of brigade and commanding royal engineer.
The officer also closely investigated the manner of escape and all
the circumstances connected with it, either by himself or a court
of inquiry, if such court could be formed, and reported to the
major of brigade.</p>
<p>It was the officer's duty to see that the convicts were
sufficiently guarded when at work or on the road to and from it,
not allowing them to loiter on the road under any pretence
whatever. When the convicts in irons were fastened together by a
chain to be marched from one place to another, or when worked on
the chain, one soldier was considered sufficient guard for a
detached party of eight; but the officer was instructed to see in
such case that the irons were perfect and that they were securely
fastened to the chain. In marching simply without being intended to
work the convicts were only handcuffed when fastened to the
chain.</p>
<p>When the men were in the stockade sentries were posted at the
wooden houses, the whole being kept under view. The convicts were
compelled to keep silence within the houses both day and night, and
a report was made and the guard turned out if any noise was heard,
repressive measures being at once adopted. Strict silence was also
enjoined during meal times, and the sentries reported immediately
if the regulation were broken.</p>
<p>On Saturdays the men were allowed to have a general wash, and at
this time extra precautions were taken against escape. All cases of
neglecting work, and disorderly or improper conduct, were
reported.</p>
<p>The arms of the military were kept at a safe distance, and a
sentry was always mounted guard over them, the officer in charge
having strict orders to take every precaution to prevent a rush on
the guard. The officer in charge of a guard over an ironed gang was
prohibited from absenting himself under any circumstances, and from
allowing any stranger or unauthorised person to live at or loiter
near his post under any pretence whatever.</p>
<p>In 1837 the construction and repair of roads and bridges were
placed under the charge of the commanding royal engineer. The
officer appointed assistant engineer superintended the ironed
gangs, and had the power of having convicts in such gangs or road
parties brought before him tried and punished by the infliction of
not more than 50 lashes for drunkenness, disobedience of orders,
neglect of work, absconding, abusive language to the overseer, or
for other disorderly or dishonest conduct&mdash;keeping a record of
all such summary trials. If any more serious crime were committed,
however, the offender was taken before the nearest justice, but
this was only resorted to in the last extremity.</p>
<p>Convicts in irons were divided into gangs of about 80 prisoners
each, and this number occupied four wooden houses, which, with the
officers' and soldiers' barracks, guard room, store, and convicts'
mess shed, formed what was called "the stockade." Formerly the
buildings were surrounded by a staked fence, but this was
discontinued, as it was found that the convicts were more securely
guarded by placing sentries at the angles of the wooden houses, and
leaving a space all round open to their fire.</p>
<p>As escapes were most frequently effected by convicts first
getting off their irons, the officer was ordered to frequently
inspect and carefully examine the irons on each prisoner every
morning before the gang left for work, and again before they were
locked up in their huts for the night. The convicts were also
frequently searched, and everything made of iron or metal taken
from them, also any money or any article of food and clothing not
appointed by the regulations.</p>
<p>Any convict who had made an attempt to escape or who shewed a
disposition to do so had additional irons put on him when at work
and at night.</p>
<p>During wet weather and on Sundays, when off work, the men were
frequently mustered by the officer, and also at uncertain times in
the night, noting the fact in his journal as an evidence that he
was doing his duty.</p>
<p>The convicts rose every morning during the summer months at 5
o'clock and during the winter months at daybreak, and were then
regularly mustered by name. They were required to wash their faces,
hands and feet every evening before they were mustered into their
berths, water being provided in wooden tubs for the purpose. Each
man was shaved twice a week, and the hair was kept at all times
closely cut, short hair not only contributing to cleanliness, but
to discovery and apprehension in the event of escape.</p>
<p>On working days when not at labour or meals, the prisoners were
kept locked up in their huts. On Sundays, Christmas Day and Good
Friday they were brought out under guard to hear prayers read and
for meals, and any well-behaved men, not exceeding one-third of the
whole gang, were permitted to take the air just outside the huts
for one hour, under a sufficient guard.</p>
<p>The sick had medical attendance&mdash;sometimes. One of the
regulations read as follows; "When a medical practitioner <i>(being
a convict)</i> is appointed to the gang, the officer will take care
that he attends duly on the sick. Should he appear negligent or
disorderly the officer will have him brought up for summary trial
and punishment. If a free practitioner is appointed to visit the
gang the officer will require him to be regular in his attendance,
and if he fails will report him to the commanding royal engineer
for the Governor's information."</p>
<p>When convicts were forwarded to the gang by the commanding
engineer the officer receiving them at once entered their names and
description, noting all scars, marks and blue tattooing, in the
registers. The new arrival was then stripped of his clothes, which
were fumigated and cleaned, tied up, labelled with his name and
ship, and put into the store. The gang clothes were then put on
him, and in these he laboured until the expiry of his "gang"
sentence, when he resumed his former garments. In like manner when
one of the unfortunate wretches was taken to the hospital from the
gang the stockade clothing was removed and the other clothing put
on him, the stockade parti-coloured dress being resumed on his
discharge cured or relieved, and another sort of cloth being put
round him if he chanced to be carried out dead. One of the
regulations was very emphatic on this point. It read <i>"His irons
are not to be taken off on removal to the hospital!"</i> They were
not alway taken off on his removal to the grave!</p>
<p>When the sentence of a convict to labour in irons had expired,
the irons were struck off, but the gang clothing was kept on him,
and he remained working with the gang until otherwise disposed of
by regulation.</p>
<p>One wardsman was allowed to every two wooden houses, containing
each 40 convicts in irons, and his duty was to keep the houses,
within and without, and the utensils and bedding used therein, as
clean as possible, and to air and shake the blankets daily; to
provide wood and water for the cooking, and water for the drinking
and washing of the convicts, and otherwise assist in the custody
and management of the prisoners. One cook and one messman
(convicts) were also allowed to each stockade.</p>
<p>One scourger was appointed to each stockade, whose duty it was
to inflict all corporal punishments ordered by the officer. The
cooks, warders, mess-men and scourgers were not appointed from the
men under sentence to work in irons, but were supplied by
requisition. The scourger was allowed 1/9 per day and rations, to
be raised to 2/9 after one year's <i>faithful</i> service. Each
cook, wardsman, and messman received, in addition to the regulation
clothing, one blue jacket, two shirts and two pairs of shoes, with
an allowance of tea, sugar and tobacco, and after one year's
approved service a gratuity of 1/- per week. Bullock drivers to the
gangs also received extra tea, sugar and tobacco, but no extra
clothing or gratuity; but if well conducted they had the privilege
of being assigned to private service after one year's work with the
gangs.</p>
<p>No pigs or poultry were allowed to be kept near the convicts'
huts, or soldiers' barracks, the whole space between the buildings
being kept dry, level and clean. One knife and fork, one pannikin,
and one mess "kid" were allowed to every six convicts, and one
spoon to each, these being issued at mealtimes and given up again
before the men left the mess shed.</p>
<p>The officers were instructed to adopt all such measures as
seemed to them likely to effect the reformation of the criminals
under their charge&mdash;to prevent those who were ferocious from
tyrannizing over the more obedient and well-disposed&mdash;to
repress all indecency of manner and language&mdash;to prohibit loud
talking or noise, gambling or trafficking in provisions or
clothing, and to manifest "a kind anxiety to procure for the
convicts as much comfort as is consistent with their condition
under the regulation of Government."</p>
<p>The Bible, books of prayer, and works of a moral and religious
character, were placed with the officers for distribution among the
men during leisure times, the convicts being held responsible that
they were not lost or defaced while in their possession. If a
chaplain or catechist attended the stockade on Sunday the officer
gave him every countenance and assistance in instructing the
convicts; but if none attended then the officer was supposed to
cause prayers to be read to the prisoners, at least once on the
Sunday. This regulation was, however, quite a dead letter. The
"cat" was the chief instructor, and many a stern lesson in morality
was read from out that book, which was bound in thicker hide than
that of calf. The regulations also provided for the establishment
of a Sunday school, for those convicts who were ignorant of
letters, and and non-commissioned officer or soldier acting as
teacher was to receive 2/6 per week for the work.</p>
<p>Where the stockade would admit of it, the gang was divided into
three classes, the first being considered the lowest, and in which
all prisoners were placed on first reaching the stockade. If upon
the completion of one-third of his sentence, the officer considered
the prisoner's conduct to have been exemplary, he could name him
for the second class, and allow him extra time for airing on
Sundays and days of broken labour, and other slight indulgences.
Upon continued good service extending over another term he was
entitled to be placed by the officer in the third class, and from
thence recommended to the Governor for a remission of a portion of
his sentence. In order to distinguish the three classes a piece of
red cloth cut into the shape of a heart, 6 inches long by 4 inches
wide, was sewed on the back of the jacket of each convict in the
second class of merit, and a similar distinction in yellow cloth
was used in the third class; the convicts in the lower or first
class being without a badge. Bad conduct while in the first class
prevented entry into the second, and bad conduct in the second was
punished by a return to the first class. All communication between
the convicts in the different classes was ordered to be prevented,
as far as circumstances would allow; and if one bad one exercised
greater demoralizing influence than usual he was recommended for
removal to another gang.</p>
<p>The convicts out of irons who worked on the public roads wore
parti-colored clothing, and were kept in gangs and under treatment
similar to the ironed gangs; but the period of their labour was
different. If under sentence for seven years they worked two years;
if under sentence for 14 years they worked three; and if for life
they worked four; after which periods respectively, if their
conduct had been good, they were recommended for assignment. These
men at work were in charge of military overseers, not under guard
of sentries, and these overseers carried their side-arms and
pistols in a waist belt, and were required to keep strict watch to
prevent escape. Convicts in the road and bridge parties who were
laborers could be assigned to private service after six months'
labour, if their conduct was good; but mechanics in bridge parties
were not assigned, although they received an extra allowance of
tea, sugar and tobacco, were permitted to wear a blue jacket, and
were returned for a ticket-of-leave as soon as it became due. The
scourger in these gangs received the same privileges and payment as
the scourger in the ironed gangs.</p>
<p>The officers appointed assistant engineers received the extra
pay of 6/- per day while employed, and forage for one horse each.
Wooden huts were erected for them at the stockade, but they had to
furnish it at their own cost. One non-commissioned officer was
employed as constable and turnkey at each stockade with the extra
pay of 1/- per day, while the overseers were allowed an extra pay
of 1/- per day, and a private 6d. The assistant engineer was
allowed to employ a non-commissioned officer or soldier as clerk at
6d. per day.</p>
<p>One month at least before the expiration of the "iron" sentence
of any convict in a gang the assistant engineer had to report the
fact to the Principal Superintendent of Convicts, and the same in
the ordinary road or bridge party; lists of all eligible for
assignment being also sent on the 1st and 15th of every month. In
cases where the warrant under which the convict worked in irons
directed that he be returned to his master at the expiration of his
sentence, one month's notice had to be sent to the master, and if
the master did not claim the convict within ten clear days from the
expiry of his sentence, the convict was placed on the list for
fresh assignment, and the name of the non-claiming master was
entered in the book, as a record against him when applying for
other servants on any future occasion.</p>
<p>The bare outline which I have given of the regulations under
which the road parties and chained gangs worked, conveys but a very
feint idea of the life which these poor wretches were condemned to
lead. Many of them were, undoubtedly, great villains&mdash;as
depraved as it was possible for men to be; and these could only be
kept from doing injury to others by the close supervision and
restraint afforded by the chained gangs. But large numbers were
really inoffensive men, whose offences or dispositions did not
merit the terrible punishment inflicted. The treatment which served
to keep the worse characters in proper subjection, simply broke the
hearts of numbers of the better class, and not a few of them sobbed
out their wretched lives upon the roads, hailing death as the sweet
messenger of rest.</p>
<p>The punishment of labour in the chain gang was very severe. Sir
G. Arthur declared that it was "as severe a one as could be
inflicted on man." Governor Bourke said that "the condition of the
convicts in the chain gangs was one of great privation and
unhappiness." The writer has seen old men, who knew by experience
what the punishment was, shudder as they described it in words not
fit to be published. In 1834, when the system was operating fully,
there were 1000 convicts in the chain-gangs of New South Wales.</p>
<p>Mr. Surveyor Mitchell, who had an intimate knowledge of the
gangs and their working in the newer portions of the country, and
especially on the Blue Mountains, when giving evidence before the
Select Committee of the House of Commons, said that the working in
irons did not destroy the utility of the labour, because the men
were kept on those portions of the road where the force had to be
concentrated, cutting through rocks and mountains, &amp;c.
Generally there was one overseer to about every fifteen men. There
was a rule under an Act of Parliament empowering an overseer to
punish a refractory convict to the extent of 20 lashes, but usually
they were supposed to report to the nearest magistrate, who ordered
the flogging.</p>
<p>The gangs were kept to work under a strict military guard during
the day, and were liable to flogging for the slightest offence,
silence being interpreted obstinacy and a look insolence, according
to the state of the gastric juices of the overseer. In some of the
stockades the prisoners were locked up at night in caravans or
boxes good enough only for savage dogs, in which they could neither
stand upright nor sit down except with their legs at right angles
to their bodies. In some instances there was not more than a space
of 18 inches in width for each man to lie down upon, bare boards
being his bed. Hear what Rev. Dr. Ullathorne says about these
kennels:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The evil result (numbers being confined together) is much
greater in chain gangs, for particular reasons, than in road gangs.
One reason is, the degradation arising from their being in chains,
and from the distinguishing dress of degradation; but another very
serious evil is their being packed very closely together at night
after their work is over. I remember once visiting a chain gang
near Parramatta, on a Sunday, for the purpose of administering
religious consolation, and when I came to the gang I found a series
of boxes, and when the men were turned out I was astonished to find
the numbers that were turned out of these boxes; I could not have
supposed that these boxes could have held such a number; I found
that they were locked up there during the whole of the Sunday;
likewise during the whole of the time from sunset to sunrise. On
looking into those boxes I found that there was a ledge on each
side, and that the men were <i>piled</i> upon the ledges and others
below upon the floor, and I believe from the bringing together of
such numbers of men, heated as they are and excited, the
consequences are of a very immoral kind. As I left the colony in
haste, I put a question to a clergyman, who has had much experience
there, as to the space allowed to each convict in those boxes; the
answer given was, that the average was about 18 inches each man,
but they varied considerably. He stated to me at the same time that
in the hulks he believed it was not more than 19 inches, and that
they were so closely piled, some 10 or 14 being put in a small
cell, that they had not room to lie on their backs and were obliged
to lie sideways."</p>
<p>It cannot be said that the chain gangs, like the road parties,
"demoralized the servants of the settlers around," for they had
very poor chances of contaminating them, seeing that they could
only get near them by running away, at the risk of being shot down
by the sentry. But, strange though it may appear, they contaminated
their guards, the soldiers. Colonel Breton, who commanded a
regiment of soldiers in the colony, declared that the nature of the
duty imposed upon the military in guarding the chain gangs had the
worst effect upon the character and discipline of the soldiers. The
demoralization arose, he said, partly from drunkenness, of which
there was much amongst the troops in the colony. He had no less
than sixteen soldiers transported to Norfolk Island, all of them
for being drunk on sentry. "Demoralization was also produced
amongst the troops," he declared, "by their intercourse with the
prison population, which could not be prevented, because many of
the men <i>found their fathers, brothers and other relations,</i>
amongst the convicts!"</p>
<p>Until within a very recent period visitors to the Criminal
Courts of the colony might hear the presiding judge occasionally
sentencing a prisoner to be "kept to hard labour on the roads or
other public works of the colony" for a certain number of years. It
was not until some time after the abolition of transportation that
the chain gangs died out.</p>

HUMANE SYSTEM AND ITS WORKING&mdash;FINAL BREAKING-UP OF THE
SETTLEMENT&mdash;THE PITCAIRN ISLANDERS&mdash;PRESENT CONDITION OF
THE INHABITANTS.</p>
<p>THE principal penal settlement of New South Wales was Norfolk
Island, and the class of convicts sent there was of the worst kind
generally. In Van Dieman's Land the settlements were Port Arthur
and Macquarie Harbour. While a few convicts were sent there direct
from Great Britain by the Secretary of State, the majority were
those who, having arrived in the colony under sentence of
transportation, were again sentenced to transportation by the
colonial courts for subsequent offences.</p>
<p>At these penal settlements, the men were occupied for ten hours
daily at field labour, in the quarries, on the roads, or in any way
that their custodians required. No settlers were allowed there;
hence there was no assigning to private service, and the only
distinction made was between those who laboured and those who were
permitted, on account of good behaviour, to serve the officers. The
prisoners were worked in gangs during the day, were locked up in
barracks at night, and were liable to be punished corporally at the
discretion of the commandant, not exceeding 300 lashes. The
condition of the convicts at these settlements was one of
unmitigated wretchedness. The work appointed for them was of the
most incessant and galling description, and any disobedience of
orders, turbulence or other misconduct, was instantaneously
punished with the lash.</p>
<p>Sir Francis Forbes, Chief Justice, informed the Committee of the
House of Commons that "The experience furnished by these penal
settlements has proved that transportation is capable of being
carried to an extent of suffering such as to render death
desirable, and to induce many prisoners to seek it under its most
appalling aspects." He also declared that he had known many cases
in which it appeared that convicts at Norfolk Island had committed
crimes which subjected them to execution, for the mere purpose of
being sent up to Sydney for trial; and the cause of their desiring
to be so sent was to avoid the state of endurance under which they
were placed on the Island; that from the expressions they employed
he thought they contemplated the certainty of execution; that he
believed they deliberately preferred death, because there was no
chance of escape, saying they were weary of life and would rather
go to Sydney and be hanged. The same gentleman also declared that
if it were put to himself he should not hesitate to prefer death,
<i>under any form that it could he presented to him,</i> rather
than endure the life of a convict at the Island.</p>
<p>How well grounded were these statements of the learned judge
concerning the conditions of convict life at these Penal
Settlements, the reader will be able to decide as the evidence
which I am about to bring forward is placed before him,&mdash;and
which evidence, I can assure him, is not by any means the strongest
that can be found in the musty pages of the old criminal records
from which I have gathered my information.</p>
<p>Within three weeks after the formal establishment of the
Government in Australia, Lieutenant King, who had come out in the
"Sirius," and who was a personal friend of Governor Phillip, was
dispatched with a small party to colonize Norfolk Island, which had
been recommended by Captain Cook as a suitable place for a
settlement. The party consisted of a surgeon, a subaltern officer,
six marines, two men who understood the cultivation of flax (which
grew luxuriantly on the Island) and fifteen convicts&mdash;nine men
and six women. When the vessel which conveyed the party to the
Island returned, the commander gave such a gloomy account of its
fitness as a settlement, that the Governor shortly afterwards sent
over a much larger party of convicts to assist in the work of
clearing and cultivation.</p>
<p>Among the instructions given to Lieutenant King, with the
commission appointing him Superintendent and Commandant of the
Island, were the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>"After having taken the necessary measures for securing yourself
and people, and for the preservation of the stores and provisions,
you are immediately to proceed to the cultivation of the flax
plant, which you will find growing spontaneously on the island; as
likewise to the cultivation of cotton, corn, and other plants, with
the seeds of which you are furnished, and which you are to regard
as public stock, and of the increase of which you are to send me an
account, that I may know what quantity may be drawn from the island
for public use, or what supplies it may be necessary to send
hereafter. It is left to your discretion to use such part of the
corn that is raised as may be deemed necessary; but this you are to
do with the greatest economy; and as the corn, flax, cotton, and
other grains are the property of the Crown, and as such are to be
accounted for, you are to keep an exact account of the increase,
and you will in future receive directions for the disposal
thereof.. .. .</p>
<p>"You will be furnished with a four-oared boat, and you are not
on any consideration to build or to permit the building of any
vessel or boat whatever that is decked, whose length of keel
exceeds twenty feet; and if by any accident any vessel or boat that
exceeds twenty feet keel should be driven on the island, you are
immediately to cause such boat or vessel to be scuttled, or
otherwise rendered unserviceable, letting her remain in that
situation until you receive further directions from me.</p>
<p>"The convicts being the servants of the Crown, till the time for
which they are sentenced is expired, their labour is to be for the
public; and you are to take particular notice of their good or bad
behaviour, that they may hereafter be employed or rewarded
according to their different merits.</p>
<p>"You are to cause the prayers of the Church of England to be
read with all due solemnity every Sunday, and you are to enforce a
due observance of religion and good order, transmitting to me, as
often as opportunity offers, a full account of your particular
situation and transactions.</p>
<p>"You are not to permit any intercourse with any ships or vessels
that may stop at the island, whether English or of any other
nation, unless such ships or vessels should be in distress, in
which case you are to afford them such assistance as may be in your
power."</p>
<p>The Island is situated about eleven hundred miles from Sydney,
to the north-west of New Zealand. It has been described as "a
solitary rock in the tropical ocean"&mdash;a fit place for
banishment. The Island is about seven miles long and four miles
broad. A long low reef fronted the bay and obstructed the entrance
of vessels, which had to stand on and off within signalling
distance, the convicts and other passengers being landed in boats
through an opening in the reef. A military roadway led from the
water to the prisoners' barracks, which were subsequently erected
on an area of about three acres, surrounded by a lofty wall. These
barracks were three storeys high, and contained twenty-two wards,
into which nearly 1,000 prisoners were crowded during the more
"flourishing" days of the settlement, the largest ward being made
to hold 100 men, and the smallest fifteen. The prisoners slept in
hammocks, slung to each other as on board ship, with a passage down
the centre. In addition to these barracks there were two gaols, a
hospital, and a lumber yard within the enclosure.</p>
<p>It was here that a portion of the plot of Marcus Clarke's
realistic convict story was laid, and no better description in
brief of the place can be given than that furnished by him, in the
diary of the drink-enslaved Chaplain of the prison. After
describing the wards in the barracks, he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"There is a wardsman to each ward. He is selected by the
prisoners, and is generally a man of the worst character. He is
supposed to keep order, but of course he never attempts to do so;
indeed, as he is locked up in the ward every night from six o'clock
in the evening until sunrise, <i>without light,</i> it is possible
that he might get maltreated did he make himself obnoxious. The
barracks look upon the Barrack Square, which is filled with
lounging prisoners. The windows of the hospital ward also look upon
Barrack Square, and the prisoners are in constant communication
with the patients. The hospital is a low stone building, capable of
containing about twenty men, and faces the beach. I placed my hand
on the wall and found it damp. An ulcerous prisoner said the
dampness was owing to the heavy surf constantly rolling so close
beneath the building. There are two gaols, the old and the new. The
old gaol stands near the sea, close to the landing place. Outside
it, at the door, is the Gallows. I touched it as I passed in. This
engine is the first thing that greets the eye of a newly-arrived
prisoner. The new gaol is barely completed, is of a pentagonal
shape, and has eighteen radiating cells of a pattern approved by
some wise-acre in England, who thinks that to prevent a man from
seeing his fellow men is not the way to drive him mad. In the old
gaol are twenty-four prisoners, all heavily ironed, awaiting trial
by the visiting Commission from Hobart Town. Some of these poor
ruffians, having committed their offences just after the last
sitting of the Commission, have already been in gaol upwards of
eleven months.</p>
<p>"At six o'clock we saw the men mustered. I read prayers before
the muster, and was surprised to find that some of the prisoners
attended, while some strolled about the yard whistling, singing,
and joking. The muster is a farce. The prisoners are not mustered
outside and then marched to their wards, but they rush into the
barracks indiscriminately, and placed themselves, dressed or
undressed, in their hammocks. A convict overseer then calls out the
names, and somebody replies. If an answer is returned to each name
all is considered right. The lights are taken away, and save for a
few minutes at eight o'clock, when the good-conduct men are let in,
the ruffians are left to their own devices until morning. Knowing
what I know of the customs of convicts, my heart sickens when I in
imagination put myself in the place of a newly-transported man,
plunged from six at night until daybreak into that foeted den of
worse than wild beasts.</p>
<p>"There is a place enclosed between high walls adjoining the
convict barracks, called the Lumber Yard. This is where the
prisoners mess. It is roofed on two sides, and contains tables and
benches. Six hundred men can mess here perhaps, but as seven
hundred are always driven into it, it follows that the weakest men
are compelled to sit on the ground. A more disorderly sight than
this yard at meal times I never beheld. The cook-houses are
adjoining it, and the men bake their meal bread there. Outside the
cook-house door the firewood is piled, and fires are made in all
directions on the ground round which sit the prisoners, frying
there rations of fresh pork, baking their hominy cakes, chatting,
and even smoking. The lumber yard is a sort of Alsatia, to which
the hunted prisoner retires. I don't think the boldest constable on
the island would venture into that place to pick out a man from the
seven hundred. If he did go in I don't think he would come out
again alive.</p>
<p>"A sub-overseer, a man named Haukey, has been talking to me. He
says that there are some forty of the oldest and worst prisoners
who forms what he calls the 'Ring,' and that the members of this
Ring are bound by an oath to support each other, and to avenge the
punishment of any of their number. In proof of his assertions he
instanced two cases of English prisoners who had refused to join in
some crime, and had informed the Commandant of the proceedings of
the Ring. The were found in the morning strangled in their
hammocks. An inquiry was held, but not a man out of the ninety in
the ward would speak a word.</p>
<p>"The newly-arrived English prisoners&mdash;and some of their
histories are most touching&mdash;are insulted by the language and
demeanour of the hardened miscreants who are the refuse of Port
Arthur and Cockatoo Island. The vilest crimes are perpetrated as
jests. There are creatures who openly defy authority, whose
language and conduct is such as was never before seen or heard out
of Bedlam. There are men who are known to have murdered their
companions, and who boast of it. With these the English farm
labourer, the riotous and ignorant mechanic, the victim of perjury
or mistake, are indiscriminately herded. With them are mixed
Chinamen from Hong Kong, the aborigines of New Holland, West Indian
blacks, Greeks, Caffres and Malays, soldiers for desertion, idiots,
madmen, pig-stealers, and pick-pockets. The dreadful place seems
set apart for all that is hideous and vile in our common nature. In
its recklessness, its insubordination, its filth, and its despair,
it realizes to my mind the popular notion of hell."</p>
<p>Such was the place which formed one of the lower depths of that
system which at its best was a maelstrom of viciousness. Many of
its gaolers were savage beasts in uniform. Nearly all the prisoners
were savage beasts in chains. There was but little to choose
between them. The writer who would attempt to put into words the
full story of that Island of iniquity would expose himself to a
moral danger not small. He would be handling pitch having unbounded
capacity of defilement.</p>
<p>The first days of Norfolk Island under Lieutenant King, and
subsequently under Major Ross, were not the darkest in its history,
although acts of revolting brutality on the one hand and appalling
crime on the other are on record, as belonging to the period
between March, 1788, and June, 1800, when Major Foveaux, of the New
South Wales Corps, assumed the office of Lieutenant Governor there.
Some queer stories are told of Foveux's social and domestic life,
not at all to his credit, even in those days of loose morals. One
of those stories brings the Lieutenant-Governor under a charge of
robbery of a peculiar kind, the article stolen being&mdash;not a
sheep, or a horse, or any such like chattel, but the wife of one of
his non-commissioned officers; and it is said the lady lived to
exercise a great influence over him, even interfering to prevent
the too free use of the lash upon prisoners who had fallen under
the displeasure of her master. This man had a keen appetite for
human suffering; and it is said that other instruments of torture
besides the lash were actively employed under his rule, and that
the condition of the caged prisoners was most deplorable.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that one of Australia's earliest and
greatest statesmen was born on the island&mdash;William Charles
Wentworth, whose father, Mr. D'Arcy Wentworth was appointed surgeon
there in 1803, a few years before the Island was abandoned, for
there was a break in the occupancy after the lapse of twenty-five
years from the time when Lieutenant King and his small band of
felon "pioneers" first set foot upon it. The worst of the dark
deeds recorded belonged to the period following 1825, when the
island was re-occupied.</p>
<p>Governor Hunter, who ruled New South Wales between 1795 and
1800, invariably looked upon Norfolk Island with an unfavorable
eye&mdash;its want of harbour accommodation, remoteness from
Sydney, and contracted area forming, in his mind, insuperable
obstacles to its retention as a penal settlement; and being
enamoured of Van Diemen's Land, through the glowing accounts of the
place supplied by Flinders, when the Governor returned to England
he reported against the old place, and in favour of the new, the
result being that in 1803 an order was received in the colony from
England to evacuate the Island. But the fresh inhabitants were
loath to leave the homes which they had built up, and as Lieutenant
King, who had given up his command of the Island to fill the place
of Governor of New South Wales, vacated by Hunter, inwardly
rebelled against the order for evacuation, five years and more
elapsed before the order was fully carried out. Most of the
settlers were emancipists, and owned freeholds of from 30 to 40
acres, and in exchange for these they had freeholds allotted to
them in Van Dieman's Land, whither they were removed at the public
expense. These settlers named the localities which they
subsequently occupied in Van Dieman's Land "New Norfolk" and
"Norfolk Plains," in commemoration of the home from which they had
been driven.</p>
<p>For nearly twenty years after its evacuation the Island was a
place of desolation. Seasons of great scarcity and privation had
set in before the settlers and prisoners were removed, and it
really seemed as though nature were in league with the British
Government to secure the abandonment. The crops of maize, wheat,
&amp;c., repeatedly failed; the few goats, pigs and fowls on the
Island escaped to the cliffs and gullies, and it was only with
difficulty that any of the stock could be recaptured. Settlers,
soldiers and prisoners alike were brought to the verge of
starvation, and the sufferings of the latter having been
intensified by the tyranny, called by the authorities "strict
discipline," to which they were subjected daily by the officers,
they engaged in systematic and desperate robberies, which, as one
resident of the place puts it, "destroyed anything like society."
The efforts at self-preservation resulted in the setting at
defiance all authority. Some of the settlers joined the prisoners
in mutinous uprisings, and there was a season prolific of hanging,
shooting, and condemnation to wear heavy irons for life. And in the
midst of all this, one writer declares, "among the settlers and
prisoners promiscuous intercourse of the most shameful and nameless
description was engaged in." So scarce were provisions that all
classes joined in a scramble to secure the tops of the wild mustard
plant and other scattered herbs which were found growing in the
bush. When the order for abandonment was put into execution, all
the buildings, either public or private, were as far as possible
destroyed, and nothing was left save the few goats, pigs and fowls
which had run wild and evaded capture; but these proved eventually
of great use to those who were subsequently sent to re-occupy the
Island.</p>
<p>Some years afterwards the British Government determined to
establish a penal settlement there for the reception of offenders
convicted in New South Wales while undergoing sentence of
transportation.</p>
<p>Accordingly on the 6th June, 1825, "The Mermaid" cutter arrived
there, with eight prisoners of the Crown to be employed as a boat's
crew for the Island, and on the afternoon of the same day the
"Brutus" brig arrived, having on board Captain Turton, Lieutenant
Richardson and Doctor Colman of the 48th Regiment, with a
detatchment of 50 troops, 9 civil officers and 50 prisoners.
Captain Turton with the whole of the officers landed the same day
at the Cascade, on the northside of the Island, and hoisted the
Royal standard of England, gave three cheers, and proceeded to
bivouac for the night. Next day the troops and prisoners were
landed, after which Captain Turton in presence of all read his
commission as Commandant of the Island. The new comers, by the
assistance of a guide who had formerly lived on the Island, marched
towards Kingstown, or more properly speaking, the remains of it,
which lies at the south side of Norfolk Island. Kingstown was so
named by Lieutenant King, not as a compliment to himself, but in
honor of His Majesty George III, and is situated in a bay between
the Nepean and Phillip Islands, neither of which are mentioned in
Captain Cook's discoveries. The Nepean is about half-a-mile in
length and narrow in proportion, and it was, with the exception of
a few caps of grass, a bare rock rising nearly 100 feet out of the
water, its distance from Norfolk Island being three quarters of a
mile to the westward. The passage between the two islands was very
dangerous except to those who were well acquainted with the
soundings. Phillip Island, with its peak 2,245 feet high (measured
by Captain Sturt), is about two miles long and one mile in breadth,
its distance from the Nepean being about two and a half miles. This
Island also stretched to the westward and the passage between it
and the Nepean was found safe and the water deep. It was slightly
wooded on the higher parts, and some very deep gullies were found
there, inhabited by the wild goats, pigs, rabbits, and a few fowls
left by the first settlers on Norfolk Island. The distance between
Phillip and Norfolk was about four miles, and thus formed the bay,
with its open roadstead to the westward, in which was situated the
old and new headquarters of Norfolk Island, called Kingstown.</p>
<p>The landing place was most difficult, being between two rocks
not more than a boat's length in width, to miss which was almost
certain destruction, excepting in very fine weather, and even then
safety could not be insured, two instances having occurred in one
fine day of the boats belonging to the settlement being upset, and
several of the crew drowned.</p>
<p>After a march of near five miles, through bushes and long grass
which had overrun the old roads, Captain Turton and party arrived
at the ruins of Kingstown, not a vestige of which could for some
time be seen, so completely had the grass (from 6 to 8 feet high)
and underwood covered them. At length stumbling over one, and
tracing out others, they discovered what did remain. The ruins were
nothing more than a few chimneys of rude construction, the houses
to which they formerly belonged having been thatched, but these had
been, as well as other buildings destroyed. The principal buildings
of stone which had been erected upon an eminence were not
discovered until some of the party, creeping through the grass,
found themselves among the ruins of stone walls. Grass huts were
immediately ordered by Captain Turton to be constructed for the
officers and soldiers, the prisoners for the present sheltering
themselves at night in the long grass. Two or three tents had been
sent down for the Commandant, in which he and some of the officers
were accomodated. For the first few months the prisoners were
occupied clearing the ground round the places of habitation and
doing necessary things immediately at hand, Captain Turton in the
meantime looking about for the most eligible spot to commence
cultivating wheat, maize, &amp;c.</p>
<p>On the 7th December following there arrived the brig "Amitz"
with 31 prisoners, some provisions, 20 sheep, and a large
copper-bottomed boat.</p>
<p>January 1st, 1826&mdash;On this day 20 working hands and an
overseer were sent to a place called Longridge, one mile from the
settlement, to commence clearing the ground for cultivation. On the
16th of the same month two of the prisoners, Samuel Tambyn and
Bryan Smith, absented themselves in the bush, where they remained
eleven months before they were retaken, owing to there being no
person sufficiently acquainted with the island to make proper
search for them. The first stone building erected on the Island
since its re-occupation was completed on the 23rd of this month,
for the use of the Commissariat as a store.</p>
<p>March 17th, 1826&mdash;The schooner "Isabella" arrived with
Captain Donaldson, Lieut. Donaldson and a detachment of troops of
the 57th Regiment to relieve Major Turton, Lieut. Richardson, and a
part of the troops of the 48th Regt. On the morning of Major
Turton's departure, Captain Donaldson read his commission as
Commandant of Norfolk Island, in presence of the officers and
troops of the establishment, issuing an order that all women, free
and bond, on the Island, were to hold themselves in readiness to
leave by the next vessel, it being the Governor's order that no
woman was to be allowed to remain on the settlement. At this time
thirty of the prisoners had their wives and families on the Island,
and the whole of these were forced, after receiving orders, to
leave their husbands, who were to remain on the settlement. One of
the women hid herself with her three children in the woods and
remained concealed until the departure of the vessel which had
taken the others away, when she came forward and implored the
Commandant to suffer her to remain with her husband and share his
fate. This being more than Captain Donaldson had in his power to
do, she was eventually obliged to follow the other banished
females. It being of primary importance to facilitate as far as
possible the cultivation of grain. Captain Donaldson used every
exertion to further this desirable object, and such men as could be
spared from other labour were accordingly sent to work at
Longridge, the seat of agriculture. The knowledge of the privations
endured by the earlier inhabitants of the Island rendered it
imperative that every nerve should be strained to secure a
sufficient supply of provisions, as the arrival of a vessel might
be prevented by shipwreck or other unavoidable cause, and only by
their own endeavours could the inhabitants depend upon obtaining
food. This Captain Donaldson strongly impressed on the minds of
every one on the island.</p>
<p>June 9th, 1826&mdash;The brig "Amitz" returned with Dr. Busby,
the first Civil Surgeon that had been sent to the Island, who was
sent to relieve Dr. Coleman; Mr. Brown, Commissariat Department, to
relieve Dr. Mr. Dempsey, and Mr. Erskine to relieve Mr. Campbell as
Superintendent of Convicts; also a relief of troops, 42 prisoners,
provisions, etc. The vessel returned for Sydney on the 18th taking
the last of the 48th Regiment and one woman. On Sunday, 24th
September following two of the prisoners, Robert Storey and Patrick
Clench, absented themselves and took to the bush. For some weeks
previously more than usual discontent had been observed on the
countenances of the whole of the prisoners. The work was hard, and
the living, from various causes, not the best. Wild pigs and goats
were plentiful on the Island and had hitherto greatly augmented the
food supplies, but now they were forbidden to be caught, and other
restrictions were also imposed in consequence of the increase of
prisoners and other persons. At this time the hours of labour were
from 7 o'clock in the morning until half past 4 o'clock in the
afternoon, no breakfast or dinner hour being allowed. Task work was
the order, six rods of new ground to be broken up, eighteen inches
deep, with the hoe.</p>
<p>The ration was served out every afternoon when the men came
"home," and consisted of 1 lb. flour, 1 lb. salt beef or 10 oz.
salt pork, 1 oz. sugar, 1 oz. salt, &frac12; oz. soap&mdash;all issued
raw, the men having to cook it as best they could. They were living
at this time in thatched huts, as were nearly all the camp. Two
eighty-gallon boilers were set up under a covering of thatch, an
overseer being put in charge to have them boiling and ready when
the men returned from work; but many of the men declined to cook
their rations in these coppers, because as each man's pound of beef
was separate and other things were boiled at the same time, it
often happened that on the victuals being served out after being
boiled many of the men had to go without, not being able to
recognise their own. After the pigs and goats were forbidden to be
caught, times were much harder. Men frequently worked 48 hours
without tasting anything like meat or bread, and they frequently
eat the salt beef or pork raw, first washing it in a stream of
fresh water which ran through the camp, and then softening it by
pounding it with a piece of round wood; this they did to prevent it
being lost among the numerous other pieces in the common pot. Their
flour they mixed up and baked in the ashes under the boilers, if
they were lucky enough to be in time, and this completed the
cooking of three-fourths of the men, one meal being thus produced,
and very few of the prisoners had a second during the 24 hours.
These things could not well be avoided, and patience to wait for
better times without making things worse was one of the daily
injunctions, but the hard-worked convicts found the practice of
this virtue not easy. It had been found necessary to erect a large
stockade, with rows of thatched huts inside, forming a garrison for
the military, and the work as a matter of necessity had to be
carried out as quickly as possible. The overseers consequently were
obliged to be strict over the men, which strictness the men called
tyranny, and a spirit of mutiny soon manifested itself.</p>
<p>September 25th, 1826&mdash;Early in the morning the prisoners in
a body openly revolted, secured their overseers, robbed the Civil
officers' quarters, broke open and robbed the Commissariat stores
of provisions and other articles, forced the gates of the boat
sheds, and carried off three boats, in which a number of the
mutineers escaped to Phillip Island. The guard endeavoured to
prevent the boats being carried away, but to no purpose, the
Corporal being murdered and two privates slightly wounded in the
affray. There were 150 prisoners on the Island at this time. After
the escape of the boats, the soldiers under Captain Donaldson
secured the remainder of the prisoners and, tranquility having been
restored and precautions taken against further attempts by the
prisoners to escape, a pursuit party of twenty soldiers was
arranged and at once proceeded to Phillip Island to recapture and
punish the escapees. The soldiers succeeded in regaining possession
of the boats, with all the plunder carried off, and in retaking
three of the prisoners, one of them being shot dead in attempting
to escape. The remainder had fled to the Peak where for the present
they could not be followed. On the 29th Captain Donaldson again
went to Philip Island with a military party and secured four more
of the deserters, the others taking shelter on the Peak, where the
captain did not think it prudent to follow them. An investigation
in the presence of the whole of the officers of the establishment
on the Island took place on the 4th of October following, to
ascertain the cause of this mutiny, when it was made clear that the
revolt had been planned by a convict known by the name of Black
Goff and a few other kindred spirits who possessed influence over
their companions. Goff himself had murdered Corporal Wilson and
wounded the two soldiers, and he was still at the head of the party
at large on Phillip Island. Goff had persuaded his deluded
companions that if they could get possession of the boats and some
provisions he could ensure them reaching a large tract of land
situated not more than 100 miles to the northward of Norfolk
Island, and from thence they might easily make their escape in
passing vessels, as he had been on the land and had often seen
vessels, especially American, send their boats on shore there. This
plausible story was believed and acted upon in the manner
described, but Goff's real intentions were to run for New Zealand
with a chosen few in the best of the boats from Phillip Island,
taking all the provisions and leaving his betrayed companions to
their fate. But this design was frustrated by the speedy pursuit
and recapture of the boats by the military.</p>
<p>To capture and secure this daring leader and bring him to
justice was the determination of the Commandant, and on the 28th
November, 1826, Captain Donaldson with a strong party landed on
Phillip Island before daybreak, and having found the path which led
to the Peak, commenced a vigilant search for the mutineers yet at
large. After several hours search they were discovered and pursued.
They had seen the boats coming, and finding their old retreat to
the Peak cut off they now took to the cliffs, in which situation
they could not be successfully attacked, as from the knowledge they
had gained of the localities of such places they could reach
retreats to which it would not be safe for their pursuers to follow
them. Towards evening Captain Donaldson succeeded in driving a few
of the convicts from the cliffs to the interior, when, after a
desperate resistance, Black Goff was recaptured, badly wounded, and
his accomplices were also secured. Having effected their object,
the Commandant and his party returned to the Island. A few days
afterwards Goff and four other principals in the mutiny were fully
committed to take their trials at headquarters (Sydney) for revolt
and murder, and upwards of 30 of the others were, by a summary
sentence of the Commandant, ordered to work in the heaviest irons
on the Island as a gaol gang. Thus ended the first well organized
attempt on the part of the prisoners to break away from their
prison home.</p>
<p>March, 1827&mdash;Affairs having returned to their normal
condition, the labors of the prisoners proceeded regularly. Fears
had been entertained for some time of great scarcity of provisions
on the Island, the time fixed for the arrival of the provision ship
having long passed. These fears were verified and great privations
were endured by the inhabitants. On March 10th, however, the
"Amitz" brig arrived bringing a supply of provisions and prisoners,
and also explaining the reason of the delay. The "Wellington" brig
had been captured by the convicts on their passage to the Island,
thus leaving it nearly ten months without a proper supply of
provisions. On the return of the "Amitz" to Sydney, Black Goff, who
had formerly been a pirate, and his accomplices were forwarded to
head-quarters for the purpose of taking their trials.</p>
<p>The capture of the "Wellington" by the convicts on board is thus
described by an eye witness:&mdash;"The vessel sailed from Sydney
on the 12th December, 1826, having on board Lieutenant Brown, who
was going as engineer to Norfolk Island, Captain Glass as
Superintendent of Convicts, 83 prisoners, Sergeant Brown and a
detachment of the Regiment, provisions, &amp;c., for the
settlement. Nothing extraordinary occurred for the first eight or
nine days of the passage. The prisoners being in appearance orderly
and subordinate, were allowed to walk about on deck, one at a time,
no indulgence (such as plenty of water, cooking, &amp;c.) being
denied them. The weather had continued fine and all things seemed
to conspire towards a speedy and pleasant voyage. Being on the 22nd
instant within 24 hours' sailing of Norfolk Island, precisely at 12
o'clock, at the moment the division of prisoners who had been on
deck in the morning was being relieved by the afternoon division
coming up the hatchway, the preconcerted signal of "Land O!" was
given by convict Douglas, one of the principals, and an
instantaneous attack on the military commenced with hand spikes and
such other weapons as could be procured. The soldiers obstinately
defended themselves, 'fighting like devils,' to use the words of
the prisoners, but they were eventually overpowered and forced
below. A few shots were fired by the military, but at great
disadvantage. One prisoner was wounded, and several of the military
and prisoners received many heavy blows. It had been so contrived
that the soldiers could not get at their arms till some minutes
after the attack commenced, and the hatches were then closed.
Captain Harewood, the master of the 'Wellington,' was confined, as
also was his chief mate, to their cabins and their pistols and
other arms taken from them. The arms of the soldiers were also
taken from them. On getting possession of the vessel, the
conspirators immediately held a council on the quarter-deck, in
which the following prisoners were conspicuous; John Walton,
appointed Captain; William Douglas, Chief Mate; Charles Clay,
Steward, William Hicks, boatswain, the others who joined in the
attack being employed as occasion required. All the prisoners on
board did not join in the mutiny, and some were confined below with
the soldiers, as being doubtful characters and not to be trusted by
the conspirators. It was settled by the principals that they should
make all possible despatch, and bend their course for South
America, landing the soldiers and others not wanted at the first
and most convenient land they should come to. The next day the wind
shifted right ahead, and a long passage now being calculated upon a
thorough investigation of all the provisions on board was made,
when it was discovered that the water would not last the number on
board a week longer, while other things, such as biscuits, rice,
&amp;c., were equally short. To get rid of the undesirable portion
of the passengers was now the determination of the conspirators,
and New Zealand being the most suitable land to make, they shaped
their course thither for that purpose. Having reached it on the
30th they steered for some hours along the coast to discover a
place likely to produce water and where they might disembark the
soldiers. One attempt was made to find water but failed, and being
now close to the Bay of Islands, they came to the conclusion it
would be best to run in and get what they wanted and get rid of
what they did not want; accordingly, the 'Wellington' was steered
into the Bay. It is customary on whaling stations (the Bay of
Islands was one) for captains of vessels to board all vessels they
met with for news; therefore, as soon as the Wellington was brought
up the Captains of two of the whalers came on board. They were the
captains of the 'Sisters' and the 'Harriet,' the two nearest
vessels to where the 'Wellington' was anchored. They were received
on deck by Walton and Douglas, who stated in answer to the question
'What news?' that their vessel was bound for South America and
being short of water they judged the Bay to be the most convenient
place to obtain it. Meanwhile a note was surreptitiously conveyed
to the hands of Captain Duke, of the 'Sisters,' informing him of
the real state of the case. Taking no notice of it to those on
deck, he invited Walton to go and dine on board the 'Sisters' with
himself and the Captain of the 'Harriet.' After some persuasion
Walton, by consent of some of his accomplices, and not suspecting
any information had been given, assented, and accompanied Captain
Duke to his vessel, where he was in a few minutes informed that the
real situation of the 'Wellington' was no secret. He was, however,
treated with every civility, but was given to understand that he
must consider himself a prisoner. Night coming on, about 10
o'clock, and Douglas thinking Walton a long time away, it being
past the hour of his promised return, he manned two boats and rowed
along-side the 'Sisters,' enquiring for Captain Walton. Captain
Duke in answer ordered Douglas off, telling him that Walton was a
prisoner and that their whole proceedings were known."</p>
<p>After again demanding Walton and being refused, Douglas pulled
off, telling Captain Duke that he had not come exactly prepared for
what had happened, but before morning he would find him again
alongside, paying him a visit of another kind. Douglas having
reached the 'Wellington,' selected thirty of the most daring among
his men and armed them with pistols and boarding pikes, determined
to take possession of the 'Sisters' and liberate Walton. Captain
Duke, after the returning of Douglas, consulted with the Captain of
the 'Harriet,' and after a little consideration they deemed it most
prudent to sent Walton away, which they did in one of their own
boats, and he arrived on board the 'Wellington' just as Douglas was
preparing to leave her with his party to attack the 'Sisters.'</p>
<p>"The conspirators now thought it high time to be off, only
waiting for daylight to enable them to get out of the Bay, the
passage being narrow. Daylight however brought the wind 'right in'
the Bay, and to 'beat out' was impossible, the tide being against
them. Betrayed and exposed, they could not tell what to do. There
were too many vessels in the Bay to attempt the capture of them
all, and the New Zealanders were too numerous and powerful to trust
themselves on shore; they therefore resolved upon waiting the
shifting of the wind, which they hoped would be in the course of
the day. Disappointment, however, met them at this point, and in
the evening the whalers demanded the surrender of the 'Wellington,'
or she would be fired into and sunk with all on board. Captain Duke
and the captain of the 'Harriet' had each on board their vessels
twelve nine-pounders stowed away in the holds of the vessels when
the 'Wellington' arrived, but which had during the day been got on
deck and mounted. Captain Duke had also promised some muskets to
two powerful New Zealand Chiefs if they would endeavour to board
the 'Wellington' in their canoes, which they agreed to do. In
answer to the flag of truce Walton declared he would never
surrender the 'Wellington,' and expecting to be attacked had made
all necessary preparations for defence, among other means, keeping
the coppers full of boiling water, should any attempt be made to
board them. They had four nine-pounders, plenty of fire arms,
boarding pikes and ammunition, and after securing all below fast
and strong, they even contemplated destroying the 'Sisters' and
'Harriet' in the night. At daylight on the morning of the 3rd of
January, 1827, the conspirators found themselves surrounded by
about eight war canoes of the New Zealanders, having on board
upwards of 300 warriors armed with spears and evidently intending
to board the 'Wellington.' Walton had also observed the whalers
getting a purchase on their cables, which evidently meant something
unusual. This was explained in a very short time by a sharp fire
being opened from the 'Sisters' and 'Harriet' on the 'Wellington's'
rigging; at the same moment the New Zealanders gave their 'war
whoop,' as a signal to board, approaching the 'Wellington' in a
body. Douglas, who superintended the guns, immediately gave them a
discharge of grape, and 40 men well-posted received them with a
volley of muskets. Two or three rounds of this kind soon satisfied
the New Zealanders. About thirty were killed alongside, a great
number were dreadfully scalded with water from the coppers, and it
is supposed nearly 100 were shot, several canoes sinking with all
on board too far from the shore ever to reach it. Not one reached
the deck of the 'Wellington,' although six or seven canoes full got
alongside, where they found the water too hot for them. Having got
rid of the New Zealanders, the remainder of whom made for the
shore, the conspirators found the rigging of the 'Wellington' cut
to pieces and her masts disabled. As yet the fire of the whalers
had been directed only aloft; this the conspirators observed from
the first, which enabled them fearlessly to repel the New
Zealanders. They now found the balls begin to pass close to the
vessel's hull, and Walton commanded his men to lie flat on the
deck, as they could not return the fire of the whalers from the way
the 'Wellington' swung. It was now pretty evident destruction was
meant, the vessel making a great deal of water from the shots which
penetrated her sides, and the people below called out that the
vessel was sinking. The firing now ceased and a flag of truce was
again sent to the 'Wellington' to demand her surrender, as it was
evident that a few more shots would sink her. The conspirators had
seen further resistance useless and consented to give the vessel up
provided they were allowed to land on such part of the bay as they
chose. To save further shedding of blood, Captain Duke, who
commanded on the part of the whalers, consented, and at night as
many of the conspirators as chose went on shore. No one on board
the 'Wellington' had been killed or wounded during the conflict
owing to the humanity of Captain Duke, who directed the fire
against her. A few shots had passed close over the deck, but the
men were lying down and thereby avoided the danger. Having obtained
possession of the 'Wellington' and released the soldiers from their
uncomfortable situation, the damages the 'Wellington' had received
were, as well as circumstances would permit, speedily repaired so
as to enable her to return to Sydney. The tact of Captain Duke now
discovered a way to get possession of the principal conspirators,
who, he had ascertained, were scattered about in small parties on
the land. Seeking out a few intelligent New Zealanders, he promised
them an old musket each for as many of the strangers as they could
catch. This had the desired effect, and in a few days the whole of
the conspirators, with the exception of six, were brought on board
the 'Sisters' in small parties of two, three, four, and six each,
Walton, Douglas, Clay and Hicks being amongst the number. Three out
of the six not captured escaped in an American vessel shortly
afterwards; the other three were taken at New Zealand two years
afterwards and sent to Norfolk Island, where they now are. Captain
Duke gave up his whaling voyage and accompanied the 'Wellington' to
Sydney, where he witnessed the trial of the conspirators, nine of
whom were hanged and 24 sent for life in chains to Norfolk Island.
Among the latter were Walton, Douglas, Clay and Hicks, whose lives
Captain Duke was principally interested in saving. Thus ended a
most desperate act of piracy and mutiny, the perpetrators of which
met the fate they deserved, and too much praise cannot be awarded
to Captain Duke and his coadjutors for the tact and courage
displayed in recovering the 'Wellington' and bringing the
conspirators to justice."</p>
<p>March 25th; 1827&mdash;The brig "Amitz" arrived, having on board
Lieutenant Cox, of the 39th Regiment, to relieve Lieutenant Douglas
of the 57th Regiment, a relief of troop sand a draft of prisoners,
amongst whom were the 'Wellington' conspirators. The agricultural
produce of the Island had up to this period been insufficient to
maintain the residents without occasional supplies from
headquarters, notwithstanding every exertion had been made and most
of the men kept at field labour. Two frames of wooden houses for
the Commandant and officers had been forwarded from Sydney and were
erected, one at the military stockade, the other opposite the Boat
Harbour. A second stone building as an additional Commissariat
store was in a forward state, and in general affairs were going on
smoothly and satisfactorily.</p>
<p>August 19th, 1827&mdash;The brig "Governor Phillip" arrived with
Captain Wright of the 39th Regiment to relieve Captain Donaldson as
Commandant, also a party of the 39th to relieve others of the 57th,
a draft of prisoners, provisions, &amp;c. On landing Captain Wright
harangued the prisoners who accompanied him, pointing out the gaol
gang who were working near the landing place in heavy irons and
explaining the consequence of disobedience and disorder. The
"Wellington" men were particularly noticed and alluded to. On the
departure of Captain Donaldson, Captain Wright released the whole
of the gaol gang from their heavy irons, replacing them with the
usual working irons, and berating the men from gaol, telling them
he meant to commence his command by giving any prisoner on the
Island an opportunity of recovering himself. He said he would never
mention to their disadvantage what had passed except he found from
personal knowledge their conduct undeserving, and that should those
who had so deeply transgressed be brought before him for any
repeated or serious charge, he would convince them that mercy
should be no more thrown away upon them, for he would then exercise
to its utmost limit the power with which he was invested. Thus
cautioned he dismissed them. Captain Wright, having fully
acquainted himself with the state of each kind of work in which the
prisoners were employed, and seeing the necessity of supporting the
Agricultural Department, determined to pay particular attention to
it. For this purpose he personally and particularly surveyed and
examined the ground under cultivation and selected other portions,
in the whole to the amount of 300 acres, to be immediately worked
on improved principles, declaring his intentions of superintending
the labour of the men himself, and seeing the ground broken up in a
proper and efficient manner, the complaint very general in
circulation being that the ground had not been cultivated deep
enough. Captain Wright made enquiries and carefully examined
several places prepared to receive crops. He then mustered the
whole of the prisoners of the Island, to the number of 220, and
selecting 200 of them, divided them into gangs, and sent them to
field labour, daily superintending one or the other. All the land
was now broken up by the hoe to the full depth of 18 inches, and it
was woe to the prisoner who was found not to have done his work
properly, 50 or 100 lashes being his certain punishment. The land
under cultivation this year was better known by the names "The 100
Acres," "Wright's Farm," "Bennett's Flat," and the whole of
Longridge. Having seen this ground properly cultivated and the
crops of wheat and maize put in the ground, the Commandant examined
the interior of the Island, discovering the remains of many of the
old settlers' gardens, the borders of strawberries plainly pointing
out the paths, while roses, bulbs, and sweet-briar abounded. In the
old vineyards there were grapes of excellent quality, large
clusters of fig trees, several Orange trees, some English Oak
trees, and a number of excellent tobacco plants. With these latter
Captain Wright planted two acres of ground, from which a large crop
was obtained, the tobacco at nine months from its being cut being
equal to any Negrohead. A second crop was planted, but government
forbidding its being brought to perfection, it was immediately cut
down. The Commandant also noticed many beautiful creepers or vines
reaching to the tops of trees 60 feet high, forming themselves into
festoons and draperies of the most fanciful and beautiful
description, bespangled with flowers of every hue. They ascended
single trees, which being short distances apart presented the
appearance of the most splendid columns, bedecked with every colour
of the rainbow. The vines also formed around groups of low trees,
and made bowers beautifully ornamented and impervious to the rays
of the sun. The evergreens of Norfolk Island, one early writer
declared, were not surpassed in richness of foliage by any in the
world. Captain Wright in his perambulations discovered some coffee
trees, citron and pomegranate trees and pines of immense size.</p>
<p>October, 1827&mdash;Twenty-five men were put in gaol for
security, as there were rumours of an intended mutiny, and several
of the convicts had been guilty of obstinacy and open grumbling;
but the disturbance was not general enough to cause any alarm for
the safety of the Settlement. On the 24th a notorious convict named
Patrick Clench absconded for the second time and took to the bush.
He found means to arm himself with a long iron spear such as had
been used to spear the wild pigs with. Having secreted himself in
the long grass by the side of the Longridge Road, close to where
the Commandant passed daily in his visits to the fields and other
places of labour, on Captain Wright's return in the afternoon,
Clench sprang out and endeavoured to spear him. The captain,
however, was an active man, and avoided the thrust with his stick,
but being unarmed was obliged to retreat, which he did safely to
the settlement. Clench pursued him for a considerable distance, but
finding that he could not overtake him, made off among the trees.
On Captain Wright reaching the settlement, a number of the military
and constables were sent out in search of Clench, but they could
not find him. The next day Clench went into the ground where a
large gang was at work, attacked the overseer with his spear and
robbed him of his watch. None of the other convicts would join
Clench, although he called to them, neither did any of the gang
afford any assistance to the overseer, on account of the general
dislike to him. Clench again made off among the trees, and nothing
more was seen or heard of him until about 10 o'clock on the night
of the 28th, when the cry of "Murder!" and "Clench is here!" was
heard to proceed from the Civil Hospital, a thatched hut standing
at a distance from any other building. The alarm instantly spread.
Constables and soldiers surrounded the place, and Clench was shot
dead in endeavouring to make his escape. His body was then dragged
to the gaol and thrown on the scourger's stage, and on the
following day the whole of the prisoners were marched past to see
and take warning by his fate. To deepen whatever impression had
been made upon the prisoners by this gruesome sight, the body was
then thrown into a hole at the cross roads, near the corner of the
bakehouse, and left there exposed. It afterwards appeared that
Clench had been told that the man who had given the information
against him had been placed for safety in the Hospital. He had
sworn to take that man's life, and in endeavouring to do so had
lost his own.</p>
<p>The year 1828 was not remarkable for any extraordinary event.
The "discipline" proceeded with regularity; the officers and
military went their daily rounds, seeking to make their own lives
as happy and the lives of the prisoners as miserable as possible;
there was the average number of arrivals by sea and departures by
death among the convicts, with all the intermediate work and
suffering and sin. Capt. Wright was relieved as Commandant by
Captain Hunt; Dr. Hartwell relieved Dr. Busby, and changes were
also made in all the civil and military departments. The first
stone of the prisoners' large barracks was laid, and the most
successful crop of wheat the Island had yet produced was gathered,
there being 45 bushels to the acre on 130 acres.</p>
<p>February, 1829&mdash;The schooner "Isabella" arrived with
Captain Wakefield of the 39th Regiment to relieve Captain Hunt as
Commandant; Lieutenant Burrows to relieve Lieutenant Kidd; troops
of the 39th Regiment to relieve the whole of the 57th; Assistant
Surgeon Steven to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of Dr.
Hartwell, which had taken place nine months after his arrival. Two
of the military who arrived by this vessel were married men and
brought their wives&mdash;the first women to set foot on the Island
for upwards of three years. A draft of prisoners and a supply of
provisions also arrived. Captain Wakefield's command, like that of
his predecessors, was but short, yet the records say affairs went
on smoothly and cheerfully; the coming crops of wheat and maize
looked well; the public buildings proceeded apace; few complaints
were heard amongst the prisoners, and the times of Captains Hunt
and Wakefield are remembered as the "peaceable times."</p>
<p>May, 1829&mdash;The "Governor Philip" brig arrived with
Lieutenant Colonel Morrissett and family, the Colonel to relieve
Captain Wakefield as Commandant, Assistant Surgeon Ross to relieve
Dr. Steven; Archibald McLeod, J.P., and family, Mr. Bennett,
Superintendent of Agriculture, being relieved by Mr. McLeod.
Captain Wakefield remained on the Island in command of the troops,
and on the day following the arrival the prisoners received a
half-holiday in commemoration of Colonel Morrissett's taking
command.</p>
<p>August, 1829&mdash;The schooner "Isabella" arrived with
Lieutenant Spencer, he having returned to relieve Captain Wakefield
in command of the troops; a relief for a few of the military;
prisoners, provisions, &amp;c. On her return, one of the prisoners
was sent to Sydney to be tried for an attempt at murder. His name
was Peter Fitzgerald, the charge against him being stabbing another
prisoner named John Hughes on the 6th June previous, "by striking
him in the belly with a knife while asleep in his berth." In
November Peter Fitzgerald was sent back to the Island, having been
acquitted. He subsequently became deranged and was kept in
confinement. On Colonel Morrissett taking command of Norfolk
Island, great expectations were cherished by the prisoners that he
would bring some new regulations with him. Up to his arrival only
one instance had occurred of a prisoner for life obtaining a
commutation of sentence and no time was mentioned in which the
well-conducted convicts could apply for such or any other
indulgence. The formation of something like a "first class" had
been announced 12 months previously, bestowing an eighth of an
ounce of tobacco daily on such prisoners as were admitted, but
those only in favour could obtain this indulgence. Colonel
Morrissett gave the prisoners to understand that he was authorised
to recommend any men of deserving character for commutation of
sentences and that he would select from the records those who
deserved it. This infused some hope, and several prisoners were by
the next arrival commuted; yet there was no proper regulation, and
no time was mentioned as a probationery period, while the
concessions made were unreliable. Some English prisoners sent to
the Island for life were admitted to head quarters after serving
some 15 months, others 20 months, and several at three years. Many
could not obtain this indulgence who were equally entitled, and
continued on the Island for years afterwards. Then the cessation of
two hours for dinner, which had been allowed by Captain Wright in
the hot weather, was discontinued and one hour only allowed all the
year round. Hominy made of maize was first allowed in Captain
Wright's time for breakfast; it was now allowed morning and
evening. The rations allowed for the working hands was as
follows:&mdash;10 oz. flour, 10 oz. maize meal, 1 lb. beef or 10
oz. salt pork, 1 oz. sugar, 1 oz salt and &frac14; oz. soap daily; the
"first class" men and the overseers being allowed &frac14; oz. of tobacco.
The difference between the overseer's rations and the working hands
was that the former were allowed 16 oz. of flour but no maize meal.
Two suits of slop clothing per year were allowed to prisoners, the
overseers being allowed a blue cloth jacket and an extra pair of
shoes during the winter half-year. The half-yearly issues were 1st
May and 1st November. The power of punishment enjoyed by the
Commandant was extensive. He could for very serious offences
sentence a prisoner to 300 lashes, give him any number of days in
the cells on bread and water, the prisoner to be visited every day
by the surgeon; he could sentence him to two years in the gaol gang
in heavy irons, and give an addition of sentences on the Island of
three years. All the above punishments were put in force at
different times.</p>
<p>May 10th, 1830&mdash;The barque "Lucy Anne" arrived with Mr.
Cunningham, botanist in the service of government, a draft of
prisoners, and provisions. On the morning of the 21st, Mr.
Cunningham proceeded to Phillip Island in a whale boat, intending
to stay a few days and collect such natural curiosities as were
indigenous to the Island, taking with him an overseer and two men.
The whale boat after landing the party returned to the settlement.
At a late hour the same night eleven of the prisoners found means
to elude the watchmen and escape from the camp. They then went and
broke open the Commissariat stores, taking therefrom a quantity of
provisions and wine; forced open the doors of the boat shed and
launched a new whale boat and got her safe into the water, without
their plunder, before they were discovered. They were then hailed
by the sentinel at the settlement. In answer to his challenge one
of them came forward and said that they had orders to go to Phillip
Island to fetch Mr. Cunningham, and they then hastened back to the
boat, in which they immediately pushed off. Seeing no officer with
them the sentinel fired, but before the guard could turn out the
prisoners had got over the bar and away. They then pulled to
Phillip Island and robbed Mr. Cunningham of his provisions and
valuables, not leaving him even a drop of water. Among other things
they took a brace of pistols, a boat cloak, a canvas tent and the
overseer's blue jacket. They then left the Island and pulled away
to the southward. The next day it came on to blow hard with a very
heavy sea, and there is very little doubt that they all perished.
Mr. Cunningham was brought from Phillip Island a few hours after
the runaways had left, extremely mortified at the loss of his watch
and excellent chronometer.</p>
<p>September 8th, 1830&mdash;Twenty-five of the prisoners were
confined on an information for conspiring to take the boats whilst
unloading the vessel. After a few days they were released to work
in the gaol gang, from which four of them made their escape and
took to the bush, then making to Longridge, where they robbed Mr.
McLeod's cottage of a fowling-piece. They then went in search of
the chief constable, whom they found with a man named John Daisley,
who had given the information against them and who was then going
to show the chief constable where they had secreted some plunder.
As soon as they came up to the chief constable, one of them
(William Hanson) presented the piece, and would have shot him but
it fortunately missed fire. The chief constable made his escape
with difficulty, but Daisley, the informer, was severely beaten and
left for dead. The men gave themselves up the next night to the
authorities. They were tried for the offence a few days afterwards,
received 150 lashes for the attempt on the chief constable and for
beating the informer, and, with 25 of their companions conspiring
to take the boats, they each received sentence of six months in the
gaol gang. The same month John Cook, William Bull and James Murphy
murdered their overseer, Adam Oliver, as he was taking them from
gaol to their work after dinner, just opposite the Lumber Yard
gate. They killed him with the spades they were carrying on their
shoulders to work with. John Cook first knocked him down and the
others beat him till dead. They immediately gave themselves up to
the gaoler. Oliver was not the man they first intended to murder,
but another overseer named Jakeman, who in general had charge of
the gaol gang and who was much disliked by them. It happened that
on the day in question Jakeman was relieving on some other duty in
the afternoon and Oliver was sent in his place. This man was also
much disliked by the gaol gang, and it was supposed that as they
had bent their minds on murder they seized the opportunity of
killing one of the two. On the 16th another murder was attempted by
a prisoner named John Walsh creeping from the berth were he slept
and going over to the berth of another prisoner and plunging a
knife into the pit of his stomach. Fortunately the man did not die
and knew the would-be assassin, who was clearly identified and,
with the murderers of Oliver, fully committed to take their trials
at head quarters. They were forwarded to Sydney in November. These
murders were committed by the men, with the sole object of being
sent on to Sydney.</p>
<p>December 23rd, 1830&mdash;The "Isabella" schooner arrived with
Assistant Surgeon Gamack to relieve Dr. Ross, J.P., also a
notorious overseer named Isaac Shaw, he being then a free man. A
few volunteer overseers arrived by this vessel, which sailed again
on the 25th, being the quickest return ever known at the Island.
The left wing of the prisoners Barrack having been completed, 150
prisoners were placed there this night to sleep, each man having a
hammock and blanket. The men were in double tiers or rows in each
room, one over the other, the breadth allowed for each hammock
being 20 inches, and the distance between the top and bottom
hammocks being three feet. Each room had windows on both sides, by
which means it was always well ventilated. Two watchmen were placed
over this wing at night to give alarm should any attempt be made to
break out, or other occasion require it. Shortly afterwards the
centre half was completed and the remainder of the prisoners were
placed in Barracks to sleep.</p>
<p>January 3rd, 1831&mdash;Seven of the prisoners contrived to
remain out of Barracks this evening by getting some of their
companions to answer "here" when their names were called, the
system of muster being then to stand at the door of each room and
call the men's names, so that it was easy for any man to answer
"here" for another. The men who thus contrived to remain out, when
it grew dark went to Longridge, where they were joined by another
by the name of Laurence Cleary. They then secured the constables
and two men who had charge of the tools, broke open the tool house,
and took away 59 reaping hooks and nine pitchforks, which they
brought to the back of the barracks. They then made an attempt to
secure the watchman, but he, having seen something move just before
they sprang on him, escaped and gave an alarm. The Commandant and a
party of troops immediately proceeded to the barrack and mustered
the men, but owing to the imperfect way in which the Roll was
called, no one was found to be absent. The Commandant ordered the
watchman to gaol for giving a false alarm and returned to
Government House, dismissing the troops to their quarters.
Scarcely, however, had the Commandant reached Government House,
when the Chief Constable crawled up to the door, severely wounded
and bleeding, and stated that he had been attacked by 70 or 80 men
all armed with pitchforks and other weapons. A second alarm was
then given, the Commandant returning with the troops to the barrack
and despatching a party of constables to Longridge.</p>
<p>He then ordered the barrack to be again mustered by Mr.
Nicholson, the Superintendent of Convicts, and Sergeant McClusky.
After a second and still imperfect muster, three men were missed.
The Commandant then ordered the watchman to be released. By this
time the constables had returned from Longridge and reported that
the tool-house had been broken open and robbed of all the tools,
and that they found the constable and two men that had charge
bound, their hands behind them, and who declared that they had seen
eight men. Two sentinels were now placed on the barrack for the
remainder of the night, and at daylight Captain Sturt came with a
party of soldiers and mustered the prisoners, causing a Sergeant to
look every man in the face as his name was called. By this means
the seven men who had absented themselves were discovered, and on
searching round the back of the Barrack the whole of the tools
stolen from Longridge were found. Thirty of the absentees were also
discovered in the long grass. Search parties were at once sent in
all directions to look for the other five who were still missing,
but these gave themselves up to Mr. McLeod and were immediately
sent to gaol. Upon an examination into the circumstances connected
with this affair, it turned out, upon the confession of one of the
parties, that their intentions were to have liberated the prisoners
from the Barrack and then attacked and set fire to the military
stockaded garrison, destroying everyone that opposed them. It was
arranged that a man was to go to each of the soldier's huts and set
fire to it by some tinder, and it being a dark night, no light
would have been seen until the huts were in flames and the stockade
surrounded by men armed with reaping hooks and pitchforks. The
slaughter of men, women and children would have been dreadful if
this diabolical scheme had succeeded. The watchman who first gave
the alarm and was imprisoned, subsequently received a
ticket-of-leave for his alertness. It appeared that after the alarm
was given by the watchman, the absentees ascertained that no
suspicion existed, as the Barrack had been mustered and no one
missed. It was about that time they fell in with the Chief
Constable and endeavoured to murder him to prevent a second alarm
being given. They also knew that the watchman had been sent to
gaol; and this raised their hopes of getting the Barrack open. The
escape of the Chief Constable, whom the darkness of the night and
the long grass befriended, prevented their plans succeeding. The
Commandant had observed the absence of the Chief Constable when the
Barrack was mustered, but as his duty led him to all parts of the
settlement at uncertain hours in the night, his absence excited no
suspicion. An investigation into the circumstances was formally
held, when the seven prisoners who had been absent were fully
committed to take their trials for the attempted murder of the
Chief Constable.</p>
<p>February, 1831&mdash;Isaac Shaw was made Chief Constable in
place of George Grover, who still continued very ill from the
wounds he had received. Early in the month, the Commandant received
several informations that the prisoners were in a state of great
excitement, almost amounting to open rebellion. Other informations
reached him to the effect that the tyranny of the overseers was
driving the prisoners to mutiny. The Commandant in consequence
ordered pen, ink and paper to be furnished to the prisoners to
depute some among themselves, who were able from personal
experience and ability to instance and describe the oppression
complained of. Accordingly a letter was composed by some of the
prisoners who said they represented the whole of the malcontents.
This letter accused the Commandant, Colonel Morrissett, of having
deprived the prisoners of their gardens, which they prized above
everything. It also contained charges of tyranny against the
overseers who were supported by their superior officers, and
formally demanded that the tyrants, who were generally "indulgence"
convicts, should be dismissed. It was a bold thing for these
prisoners to do, especially as they knew that their judges would be
the very men against whom they lodged complaint. When the
Commandant received the letter he called the officers and staff
together and asked them if they did not think it was simply "the
disconsolate composition of a few badly-disposed and dangerous
men," and not a formulation of the complaints of the prisoners
generally. It goes without saying that the court was unanimous in
saying "Yes" to the proposition of their chairman, and after
consultation it was agreed to try and catch the malcontents in
their own trap. The Commandant declared that the order to deprive
the prisoners of their little gardens came from head quarters, in
consequence of the many unfavorable reports he was compelled to
make of the general conduct of the men, and that he would never
have thought of punishing the prisoners in such fashion. We can
imagine the officers putting their hands to their regulation caps
and crying in chorus "Right! Colonel, yer Honour!" The Colonel then
ordered that as many of the prisoners as chose should attend at the
Police Office the following morning to hear the letter read and
declare whether they were the authors of or subscribers to it. The
Commandant was a joker of the very first water. It was simply
asking the men to put their heads into the hangman's noose, or to
bare their backs for the scourger! About 200 of the convicts
attended in front of the hall of justice at the hour named,
"well-guarded," as the official account runs, "by the military and
constables." Captain Sturt then came forward and in an audible
voice read the letter, desiring those who had witnessed the writing
and assented to it to step forward. Let an official pen give the
reader an account of what followed:&mdash;"At first no one would
come forward; everyone seemed anxious not to be seen. At length
about 12 came, or were rather pushed out, and in a stammering,
confused way declared themselves the writers and authors. They
were, as expected, some of the worst characters on the Island.
Captain Sturt, with a frown of disdain, ordered them among the
others and in a suitable and forcible manner pointed out the
degraded state of the men who had acknowledged themselves as the
compilers of the letter&mdash;sunk almost below hope, they wished
to make all others as hopeless as themselves; but the Captain could
plainly see, as well as the Commandant, who was present, that the
prisoners with very few exceptions were very ignorant of such a
letter having been written. The Captain explained the matter of the
gardens being taken away and expressed an opinion that they would
be restored. As to the tyranny of the overseers, no such thing was
tolerated. Well-grounded complaints of such facts would be attended
to, but the prisoners would at the same time understand that the
necessary and local discipline of the Island should be supported
and enforced by all lawful means that might be found necessary.
With this suitable admonition to all, and desiring those who had
come forward as the authors of the letter to be very cautious of
their future conduct, the Commandant ordered them to be dismissed
and sent to their usual labor." Comment upon this peculiar
transaction is not necessary. It was on a par with all other
official proceedings at Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>May 23rd, 1831&mdash;- The "Queen Charlotte" brig arrived with
provisions. When this vessel was lying off the Island a most
unfortunate accident occurred. A musket belonging to one of the
soldiers exploded and "went off unawares," mortally wounding the
Captain, whose name was Anthony Rolandson. The wounded man was
immediately brought on shore and taken to Government House, where
every care and attention was bestowed upon him. But he expired ten
days after the accident, and was interred very respectably in the
burial ground of the settlement, a handsome tombstone being placed
over his grave describing the lamentable occurrence.</p>
<p>October 15th, 1831&mdash;The ship "Louisa" arrived with Dr.
Davies of the 39th, and Lieutenant Burrows accompanying the escort.
This vessel brought back the eight men who had remained out of
barracks and attempted to murder the Chief Constable on the 3rd of
January to be dealt with in a summary way by the Commandant. The
men were tried and received the sentence of 300 lashes each, and to
be confined in gaol for the remainder of their lives.</p>
<p>January, 1832&mdash;The first stone-built garrison opposite
Government House was inhabited by the detachments of the 4th and
39th Regiments.</p>
<p>April 9th, 1832&mdash;The brig "Governor Phillip" arrived with
Mr. Webb as Superintendent of Convicts, to replace Mr. Nicholson.
Doolan, the man who attempted to murder Thomas Smith, was sent down
to be executed on the Island. This was the first man hanged on the
Island since its re-establishment. A military guard was this month
sent out with the gaol gang and continued.</p>
<p>May 29th, 1832&mdash;About 5 o'clock, a violent internal motion
resembling the shock of an earthquake took place. Several huts were
thrown down and many of the officers and others declared their
houses were shaken so violently that they thought they would be
overthrown. Several buildings, especially the military barracks,
trembled so that the inmates were expecting they would fall. The
dry quarry, a huge mass of rock, was observed to move; the bells at
Government House rang violently for several minutes, the house
shaking so much that all the occupants ran out, and Mrs. Morrissett
fainted at the door; the large bell which called the prisoners to
quarters, sounded several times, and everyone on the Island was
alarmed. The shock lasted six or seven minutes. The officers
interpreted the visitation as a mark of Heaven's displeasure at the
conduct of the prisoners. The convicts said it was Heaven's
condemnation of the tyranny of their officers!</p>
<p>During the succeeding months of this year several vessels
arrived, bringing prisoners and stores, at the rate of about one
vessel per month.</p>
<p>May 29th, 1833&mdash;This day 17 men made their escape in one of
the large boats employed in unloading the two vessels then in the
Bay. The large boat had left the "Isabella" for the evening, it
being then 4 o'clock, meeting on her return the small boat going to
the "Governor Phillip," her last trip that day. The large boat had
on board 50 or 60 bags of maize, which she had called alongside the
"Phillip" and taken in. The men in the small boat rowed alongside
the large one, jumped out of their boat into the other, taking all
the oars except one and every other portable thing, leaving the two
coxswains and one prisoner to get on shore as best they could. It
was quite a calm at the time and the two vessels were not more than
a mile distant when the affair happened, but they could not pursue
or prevent them. The prisoners gave three cheers and pulled away to
the north-east. Towards night a slight breeze sprang up, and both
vessels made sail after them in different directions; but after
spending three days in useless search on the ocean they were forced
to return. A period of squally weather for several days succeeded
the departure of the boat, and it is thought that she must have
foundered, although a rumour was afterwards circulated that the
prisoners reached the Society Islands and had been seen and
recognised in both places by men who had been prisoners on the
Island.</p>
<p>September 11th, 1833&mdash;Arrived the private ship "Esther"
with His Honor Mr. Judge Dowling and a special commission to try
three men for the murder of a prisoner named John Dinsley who had
been nearly killed on a former occasion (September 12th, 1830) for
giving information. The perpetrators of this murder were found
guilty and hanged on the 13th. This vessel also brought prisoners
and stores.</p>
<p>January 15th, 1834&mdash;This day was rendered remarkable by a
rebellion on an extensive scale. Various "informations" had from
time to time been given, and it had been evident for several weeks
that an outbreak would take place, although the day fixed for it
could not be ascertained. The military had been on the alert night
and day, sleeping, or rather lying down, with their arms beside
them for a month before it burst out. Small parties of prisoners
were everywhere seen, when opportunity offered, whispering and
consulting together, the constables and overseers not liking to
disperse them for fear of the consequences to themselves. They paid
very little attention to their work, and a general stupor seemed to
hang over the place. Several lists containing 200 and 300 names
were forwarded to the Commandant as being the men who were known to
have sworn to join in endeavouring to take the Island. The gaol was
already full of men sentenced to the gaol gang and to different
periods of imprisonment. For about a week previous to the attempt
being made there seemed to be a better feeling among the men, many
appearing to work more cheerfully, while those who could not or
would not work went to the hospital in the morning and endeavoured
to get exempt for the day. In this way the hospital gang increased
in size daily, but no suspicion was excited. On the morning of the
15th, the gangs were mustered and left the Barrack yard as usual,
going in an orderly manner to their work, although about seventy
went to the hospital, where they were safely received, and the
gates were shut by the constable in charge. Immediately on the
gates being shut the prisoners secured the place inside and shut up
all the attendants, taking the overseer's blue jacket off and
putting it on one of themselves. Those who had irons on secured the
axe belonging to the place and knocked them off. In about
half-an-hour, as the guard was coming down the road to take the
goal gang to their work from the gaol, the party from the hospital
marched out, with one who had the appearance of an overseer at
their head. Arrived at the corner of the gaol, as the guard
proceeded to the entrance of the place to receive the gaol gang,
the hospital party attacked them and succeeded in getting
possession of two muskets. The intrepidity of the Corporal in
charge, however, soon turned the scale. The hospital party expected
that the gaol gang would rush out to their assistance as soon as
the attack was commenced, but some unforeseen circumstance delayed
them some minutes longer than usual, and the gallant Corporal,
seeing where their chief dependence lay, shot the first of the gaol
gang that came out of the door and immediately charged the others
back, wounding two of them. This caused the hospital party to
falter and renewed the courage of the guard, and as several others
of the mutineers fell the cry was raised, "The military from the
garrison are coming!" This put the assailants completely to the
rout. Many were shot at different parts of the settlement, the
majority of the prisoners making for the Barrack yard as a place of
refuge. In the meantime the Longridge gangs having reached that
place and received their tools preparatory to going to work, with
these tools broke open the tool house, and armed themselves with
pitchforks, reaping-hooks, &amp;c., and about 100 of them, with the
cry of "Death or Liberty," made all haste towards the Settlement,
thinking to be in time to assist the hospital party. But they were
too late. The rebellion had been crushed before the Longridge men
reached the top of the hill which overlooked the Settlement. On
arriving at this hill they gave three cheers, expecting to be
exultantly answered by the settlement men; but no answer was
returned, and the first thing that attracted their attention was a
party of the military from the garrison coming hastily up the hill
in pursuit of them; they therefore took to flight immediately, some
running into the bush and hiding themselves in the grass. About 20
were taken within an hour, and the greater part of the others
before night. On mustering the men that night, 40 were found
absent, including 8 killed and 10 wounded. Next day all but six
were secured of those who were missing. On the 18th a most
unfortunate circumstance occurred. A party of the military and
constables were sent out in search of the six absentees, and when
passing through some standing maize, the musket of one of the party
went off and killed a constable named Constantine and a soldier,
the ball passing through the bodies of both, the two falling dead
simultaneously. The men were walking one behind the other when the
accidental shot was fired, and the soldier whose piece went off was
about two yards before them. The six runaways were subsequently
taken, one being shot at the time in endeavouring to make his
escape. The whole of the prisoners being now securely lodged in the
barrack and gaol all work was suspended for some weeks, in order
that a searching examination into the circumstances might be made.
Captain Fyans, acting for Colonel Morrissett, who was then
indisposed, conducted the inquiry. It appeared clear from the
evidence that the rebellion had been carefully arranged long before
it broke out. The prisoners had determined sooner or later to make
the attempt, and fully expected that it would prove successful.
About 50 of the men were fully committed to take their trials for
the capital offence, and 150 others were heavily ironed and kept
together on a chain cable, to be summarily dealt with. These latter
were daily marched out, dragging the chain cable along with them,
and made to go through a variety of irksome
positions&mdash;extending their arms, dressing and undressing
themselves, &amp;c.&mdash;for several hours at a stretch, "as a
punishment, and to occupy their time as much as possible from
entering into fresh plots." In this manner they were disposed of
until the arrival of the judge who tried them.</p>
<p>April 17th, 1834&mdash;The schooner "Isabella" arrived bringing
Major Anderson, K.M., 50th Regiment, as Commandant to relieve
Captain Fyans and succeed Colonel Morrissett, Major Anderson's
first act was to reconsider and examine all the evidence and
witnesses connected with the recent mutiny and transmit the
documents to head quarters.</p>
<p>July 9th, 1834&mdash;The "Alligator," sloop of war, arrived with
His Honor Judge Burton and a special jury to try the mutineers.
Thirteen of the prisoners were found guilty and subsequently
executed, seventeen others being "capitally respited in irons,"
while a great many of the remainder were dealt with in a summary
way by the Commandant. Whether the playful exercises on the large
cable formed part of their employment after the trial is not
recorded.</p>
<p>Between July, 1834, and May, 1835, no event of extraordinary
interest occurred, but during the early part of the last mentioned
month a rather sensational incident took place, furnishing food for
conversation amongst both bond and free residents of the Island for
many days succeeding.</p>
<p>On the 14th the private schooner "Friendship" arrived with
provisions, &amp;c., for the Island, and made fast to the
Government moorings off the settlement. The vessel had been lying
thus for two days when it came on to blow fresh from the S.W., with
a heavy swell, the wind and sea "dead on the land." On the previous
evening she was noticed to ride well, but as the wind increased
towards dusk it was found dangerous to get under weigh. On the
following morning (being Sunday) at daybreak the vessel was seen at
the buoy, having "rode out" the night in safety. It was still
blowing hard and those on shore saw that the moorings had given way
in some part, as the schooner was dragging them to leeward and fast
approaching the shore. Still it was considered there was no danger,
if the vessel were at once got under weigh, for she could have
passed with safety between Norfolk Island and the Nepean with the
wind; but to the astonishment of the watchers, no one was to be
seen on deck and every moment rendering the chances of saving the
vessel less. At last, but not until the heavy swells rolling in
before the breakers had caused an unusual motion on board, the crew
appeared on deck, and their surprise and consternation may be more
easily imagined than described, for instead of being safely at
anchor with the moorings, they found their vessel close to the
reef, dragging the buoy of the moorings after her. To make sail
windward and get off land was now impossible, for the outward surf
was seen curling outside the ill-fated ship. Nothing less than the
loss of all hands when she struck was anticipated. Fortunately,
however, the reef opposite the settlement was a flat surface of
rock, and it being high water the hope was raised that the sea
would throw the vessel on the reefs and not dash her to pieces
outside. It was seen that the fore and aft main-sail, close reefed,
and fore stay-sail had with difficulty been hoisted to press the
vessel on her broadside in order that she might not draw so much
water when she struck, and thus afford a better chance of being
hove up on the reef. She now came into the breakers, which swept
completely over her, burying her and all on board in a mass of
angry water. A second and third wave went over her, and then she
struck the reef, the mainmast being carried away. The next sea
"hove" her high upon the reef in about six feet of water. Still the
surf rolled dreadfully around and broke over her, although the
position in which she was thrown on the reef was of itself
extremely fortunate, for she lay broadside to the surf, thus
causing a good "lea" on the inshore side. Although every sea
reached her, yet the waves could not move her from the position. A
number of the prisoners ran to the beach opposite the point where
the vessel had struck, and these dashing into the water the moment
she was on the reef, succeeded in getting along the reef to within
60 or 70 yards of her. But they were here met by the surf, which
rolled heavily on the outer ridge and curled round the vessel like
a whirlpool. Every succeeding wave would for a few moment leave a
temporary smooth round the vessel's lea side, and the mast having
fallen so as to reach half way to the spot where the most daring
prisoners had ventured five of them plunged into the "drawback" at
the risk of being carried outside the reef, and succeeded in
catching hold of the mast, which hung by the shrouds to the vessel,
and by this means got on board. There they found all on board in
deepest distress and despair. Some of the females and children were
below, standing up to their waists in water and screaming for
assistance, one lady, Mrs. White, the wife of one of the
passengers, having a young babe in her arms. The crew were afraid
to bring these women and children on deck on account of the surf,
which still broke heavily over it and would have washed them
overboard, and they seemed too intent on their own preservation to
render any assistance to the helpless passengers. The prisoners
from the shore, however, as soon as they learned where they were,
went below and brought them on deck, holding them fast by the
rigging, and intending if no assistance could reach them in the
shape of a whale boat, to seize the first favourable opportunity
offered by a receding wave and swim with them to the shore. One man
had actually stripped himself and was preparing to tie two children
to his back when a whale boat was seen coming over the reef. Two of
the prisoners now got the topsail halyards, and seeing the boat
could get no further without a rope to haul her through the curling
surf, crawled along the mast to the whale boat, which was then, by
the aid of the rope, hauled alongside, and by this means, although
at the expense of many severe bruises to the rescuers, all on board
were saved, as well as most of the property the vessel contained.
The vessel's hull being extremely well built, she held together
till low water, which left her "high and dry" on the reef. She was
eventually broken up on the beach where she was hauled after being
lightened. In recognition of their bravery and valuable services,
some of the prisoners had two years of their respective sentences
remitted, while others received some trifling rewards, such as
being put in the first class, which entitled them to seven-eighths
of an ounce of leaf tobacco per day!</p>
<p>August 1st, 1835&mdash;An accident happened to one of the whale
boats working at unloading the "Isabella," which had arrived with a
general cargo, the sea being very rough, some heavy rollers
occasionally coming over the bar. As the first boat was returning
from the vessel, a heavy surf upset her just as she got to the bar,
and one man was drowned. The Commandant then ordered the boats to
be hauled up, considering it unsafe to allow them to go out any
more that day. Towards the afternoon, however, the sea being smooth
and there being little wind, the boats were again launched; but the
first boat on her return was swamped outside and one soldier and a
prisoner were drowned before assistance could reach them. The sea
for some hours had been as smooth as a mill-pond and no danger
whatever was apprehended, and everyone was astonished and grieved
at this untoward event.</p>
<p>December, 1835&mdash;The "Governor Phillip" arrived with His
Honor Judge Plunkett and a special jury to try two men, one for
murder and the other for an attempt at murder. They were both found
guilty and executed on the 25th inst. December 17th arrived the
"Isabella" with prisoners and provisions.</p>
<p>January 9th, 1838&mdash;A desperate party of the prisoners,
three in number, named William Storey, Michael Byrne, and Hugh
Hughes, absconded from their work at Red Bank to the bush. They
were immediately pursued by a party of constables and overtaken at
Drummond's Farm, about two miles from the settlement, where a
desperate fight took place, in which several of the constables were
wounded and one of the runaways, Storey, was killed; the other two
were secured and lodged in gaol. Byrne and Hughes received 300
lashes each and were sentenced to 12 months in irons.</p>
<p>For the space of two years from this time no event of great
importance occurred. There were frequent arrivals of fresh
provisions, frequent changes of military, and a few changes in
Government; but the old monotony of crime and suffering continued.
One marriage is recorded&mdash;that of Mr. Perry, Police Office
Clerk and grandson of Lord Limerick, and Miss Sheafe, sister of one
of the military officers. Revs. McEncroe and Gregory, Roman
Catholic priests, visited the Island, and were followed by the
"Lord Bishop of Australia." Major Bunbury succeeded Major Anderson
as Commandant, and matters proceeded as smoothly as could be
expected in such a place until an attempt was made to introduce an
entirely new system of management, which will be fully described in
subsequent pages.</p>
<p>During the winter months the prisoners were called out from
their crowded wards long before daylight, each one to carry his bed
into the yard to be aired&mdash;no regard being paid to the
character of the weather. They were then fed and marched out in
gangs under overseers, whose characters were generally a reflex of
the superior animal under whom they served. Under the rule of men
who knew no mercy the life of the convicts on the Island was one
unceasing round of suffering, and not a few sought relief from the
horrors of their situation by taking their own lives.</p>
<p>The evidence taken before the Select Committee of the House of
Commons in 1838 lets the light fully into this dark chambers of
horrors, and to it we may turn with certainty of finding that
which, though it shocks and sickens, cannot fail to interest
us:&mdash;</p>
<p>Major Thomas Wright, who was Commandant at Norfolk Island for
nearly two years, told the following story:&mdash;"When I was there
(1828) there were from 200 to 300 prisoners under my command. We
had 60 or 70 soldiers. The convicts sent to the Island were what
are termed 'out-and-outers,' that is, those who have either been
condemned in England as capital felons and pardoned, and are
capital transports, convicted and sentenced to be transported for
life; and also persons who had been a second time convicted
capitally in New South Wales and transported from thence, together
with other criminals who had smaller sentences, but whose crimes
were considered very bad. The greater number were what were termed
'transports for life.' For rations they were allowed 1 lb. bread
and 1 lb. meat, and a little soap for cleansing themselves, but
they could grow vegetables, as they had each a garden. I should
think that at least half of them were worked in irons. They were
put into gangs, which gangs were perpetually varied as the labour
required; sometimes 30 or 40 would be on one spot. The Island is
the most beautiful spot in the world, remote from any other land,
and inaccessible all round excepting two points. Just before I went
there the prisoners rose and took the Island from the preceding
commandant, broke down the stockades, murdered the guard, captured
the boats, and the whole body made over to an island about seven
miles off. The officer patched up his boats with tin after they had
absconded, and he and his men pulled over to the island and carried
it by assault. When I was commandant they attempted to murder me
and take the island. When I went down I attended personally to the
labour of every department and stopped many days superintending the
works from morning till night of every party concerned. I took out
my watch on the spot and allowed the men to work for a certain
time, and then gave them 10 or 12 minutes rest every hour until I
had ascertained what quantity of labour every man could perform
without tyranny; because my duty was to punish them for idleness,
and I conceived it impossible to punish a man for idleness unless I
had some scale by which I could judge what they were capable of
effecting. During the first month there was no end to the artifices
which they had recourse to avoid labour and impose on me; and at
the end of the month I told them that what had been done had been
done by design, for the sake of making myself conscientiously
acquainted with what they could do, and what they ought to do, and
from that time henceforth I would make them do it. The consequence
of this proceeding of mine (together with the absence of the
superintendent of agriculture, who was in Sydney on a charge of
murder) was, that I was constantly observing their labours in the
field, and once, while returning from so watching them, a man
waylaid me and endeavoured to murder me on the road with a club
which he had. He was a man who I had never seen or punished before;
I escaped, however, and he took to the bush. Several persons then
came forward and gave information that there was a conspiracy
breeding to take the island and murder us all, and to escape in the
next ship which should bring prisoners down from Sydney. I arrested
the parties concerned, and the two ringleaders were the men who had
been leaders in the previous mutiny, but pardoned. None of the men
were punished corporally, that I <i>recollect,</i> for their
concern in this mutiny. The man who had attacked me with the club
was shot three days afterwards. He came down in the dead of the
night from the bush into the settlement; I was just going to bed;
two shots were fired by the sentinels in the stockade, and the
alarm was given that the prisoners were mutinying and going to
attack the garrison. The whole detachment was turned out and I put
on my things as fast as I could and ran out; we could not tell
whence the disturbance proceeded, it was so excessively dark, but I
told the lieutenant to remain in the garrison with the main body of
men, while I would take 20 men with me and a bugle, and I should
make my way to the guard at the settlement, about half a mile off,
to support them, because they were the guard over the stores and
everything we had to live upon, for there was nothing in the world
on the island and we lived entirely upon the supplies from Sydney,
except the maize corn which we reared. When I arrived I found
everything tranquil at the settlement. I went round the prisoners'
encampment and found a general disturbance, the men singing out
'There he goes; there he goes; stop him! now he is going for the
wheat.' I said 'Who is going? what do you mean?' A voice called out
'It is Clinch, sir,' (the name of the man who had attempted to
murder me); 'he has come from the bush and has been attempting to
murder the superintendent of the hospital, and is stowed away among
the bulrushes.' These bulrushes were in a large bog which
surrounded the camp, I called to a sergeant and half a dozen men to
go in and secure him. Clinch was armed with a pole, the tail of a
hoe, about five feet long, and at the end of it he had a carving
knife, about a foot long, stuck into it for a bayonet. He nearly
murdered the corporal of the picket who fell in with him; the
corporal cut at him with the sabre, and the men seeing as they
thought the corporal in danger fired at Clinch and shot him. When I
came to Sydney a year and a half afterwards I was prosecuted by the
editor of the <i>Sydney Monitor</i> on a charge of murder trumped
up by the prisoners or others and transmitted to him. They tried to
make it appear that I had ordered the man to be shot. I was tried,
and without being called upon for my defence was acquitted. The
convicts were very ready to betray each other. They are the most
treacherous beings on the face of the earth. No tickets-of-leave
are ever given at Norfolk Island. The convicts committed every
species of offence among themselves, and upon the stores, and under
all circumstances; there was nothing to be got at to rob that they
would not steal. The punishment was summary when brought up; I used
to give them 50 lashes and send them away about their business. We
had only three solitary cells there, but I do not think solitary
confinement has much effect upon them; one-third of them, provided
they did not work and were well fed, would just as readily lie like
dogs all the year round. The cells were not much larger than dog
kennels&mdash;so small that I did not practice solitary
confinement; I put them in for one or two months, but for no longer
periods. The solitude was absolute, and it must have been tolerably
dark in the cells with bars over the front of the small window. It
made no improvement; a man came out, and in half an hour he would
commit a robbery if he had a chance. The prisoners' creed was never
to throw away a chance of committing a robbery without being
detected. I adopted the plan of never pardoning when there was a
conviction. I said 'I shall make one rule; you shall have the
fairest and clearest trial; you shall get out by every quibble you
can; but if you are once convicted, on my soul the punishment shall
follow.' Some boys were sent to the Island; they conducted
themselves pretty well, not being so desperate and reckless as the
old hands. There were no means of religious instruction while I was
there. I was the clergyman; I read service and <i>preached them a
sermon</i> every morning. I assembled them together and had them
cleanly dressed, brought them into the gaol yard and had them in
clothes and their persons thoroughly cleaned. I opened their ranks
and went down the front rank and rear rank, and sometimes, as it
had been my habit to do as an officer, made them bare their shirts
and necks, so that I could see if their bodies were clean;
sometimes I used to make them pull up their trousers above their
knees to see that they had washed their legs. After this I marched
in the military under arms and then I had a table put in front, and
I used to read the prayers, and generally one of Blair's sermons,
or any other that I had. I do not think the punishment at Norfolk
Island produces the least reformation; the horror they may have of
going down there may make them more cautious of committing crimes,
but I do not call that reformation. I never saw anything like
penitence or religious feeling. When Captain Donaldson went down to
Norfolk Island, he wrote to General Darling stating that he had
observed a great spirit of amendment among the prisoners, and a
great proneness to religious exercises, and that he thought it
would be a useful thing to send down a number of Testaments,
Bibles, Prayer Books and religious tracts, and accordingly the very
next ship brought a chest full of Bibles, a chest full of tracts,
and a chest full of Prayer Books. The convicts are excessively
quick in what they call 'twigging a man'&mdash;that is finding out
his propensity, and immediately accommodating themselves to it, and
becoming religious. Captain Donaldson gave them the books, and they
used of a Sunday to get out and put themselves in a conspicuous
situation, that he might see them from the garrison reading; and he
concluded the books were a relief to their solitude, and had done
them good; yet at this very time these men were concocting the
mutiny which subsequently took place under him. The prisoners are
great hypocrites; they will affect any character that suits their
views or their ends."</p>
<p>Rev. Dr. Ullathorne gave this testimony:&mdash;"I twice visited
Norfolk Island&mdash;once in 1834 and again in the end of 1835; I
went to administer religious consolation to the condemned in the
conspiracy of 1834. It was a conspiracy to take the Island from the
military and to obtain their freedom. That conspiracy was planned
with considerable ingenuity; it was planned that a greater number
of prisoners than usual should report themselves sick, and those
were separated from the rest and were placed in a room of the
hospital for examination by the surgeon; others were to arm
themselves with implements of husbandry and to proceed down, while
the third party, who were then proceeding to their labour, should
turn upon the guard. The party suddenly assailed the guard, those
who were in the hospital broke out, having broken off their chains,
and the third party was proceeding down, but did not arrive in
time. A skirmish ensued, one or two persons were slain upon the
spot, and I believe 11 or 12 were dangerously wounded, six or seven
dying of their wounds afterwards. The consequence was that a great
number of them were implicated in the conspiracy, and a commission
was sent from Sydney to try them. In this case 31 were condemned to
death. Some six months afterwards I proceeded from Sydney for the
purpose of attending those who were to be executed, and on board
the same ship was a Protestant clergyman likewise. On my arrival I
immediately proceeded, although it was very late at night, to the
gaol, the Commandant having intimated to me that only five days
could be allowed for preparation, and he furnished me with a list
of the names of the 13 who were to die, the rest having been
reprieved. I proceeded therefore to the gaol, and upon entering I
witnessed a scene such as I certainly never witnessed in my life
before. The 31 men were confined in three cells. They were then
mixed together, and were not aware that any of them had been
reprieved. I found so little had they expected the assistance of a
clergyman that when they saw me they at once gave up a plot to
escape which they had very ingeniously planned, and which might, I
think, have succeeded, so far as their getting into the bush. I
said a few words to induce them to resignation, and then stated the
names of those who were to die; and it is a remarkable fact that as
I mentioned the names of these men who were to die they, one after
another, as their names were pronounced, <i>dropped on their knees
and thanked God that they were to be delivered from that horrible
place,</i> whilst the others remained standing mute and weeping. It
was the most horrible scene I have ever witnessed. It had been a
very common thing with us to find prisoners on their way to the
scaffold thanking God that they were not going to Norfolk Island.
The Rev. Mr. McEncroe attended 74 executions in the course of four
years, and during that time he remarks that the greater number on
their way to the scaffold, and upon the scaffold, thanked God that
they were not going to Norfolk Island. The cells where these 31 men
were confined were exceedingly small, so much so that I found, even
at night, when I came there, the men had flung off their upper
garments for the sake of coolness. Crime in Norfolk Island is
proverbial; there are designations, which show at one its enormity,
in the mouths of the prisoners. I was very much struck, indeed,
with the peculiar language used by prisoners. When a person had
been conversing with me respecting another individual, he had
designated him as a good man; I suspected that he did not mean what
he said, and on asking an explanation he apologised and said that
it was the habitual language of the place&mdash;that a bad man was
called a good man, and that a man who was ready to do his duty was
generally called a bad man. There is quite a vocabulary of terms of
that kind, which seem to have been invented to adapt themselves to
the complete subversion of the human heart, which I found
subsisting. The outward appearance of the great body of convicts
was very shocking. When I have gone down in the morning, at 6
o'clock, to my duties to the convict barracks, and have seen from
1,100 to 1,200 of them filing out to work I have been very much
struck indeed with the shocking appearance of the
prisoners&mdash;the general haggardness of their features, and the
hard and fixed traces of crime upon their countenances. Crimes of
violence were frequently committed on the Island. A very
considerable improvement has taken place of late, the causes being
the efforts made by religion and the indefatigable exertions of the
Commandant, Major Anderson. Whilst he was severe upon those who
persevered in their crimes, he was always ready to reward and
encourage those who exhibited any improvement. When a prisoner had
distinguished himself by good conduct for a certain time, generally
one chain was taken from one leg; if he continued for a certain
period longer, say 12 months, a lighter chain was given; after that
the chain was removed altogether. In cases where prisoners
conducted themselves remarkably well they were altogether removed
from the rest, and assigned as servants to officers, or employed as
shepherds, or in some situation separate from the great body. I
appointed a course of prayer for the men on my first visit, and a
course of instruction, and established a school and left books,
that those who could not read might, in the hours between labour,
instruct themselves; and the consequence was that upon my second
visit I found that between 60 or 70 persons had learnt to read, and
such was the anxiety which some of those men evinced to instruct
themselves, that they were actually repeatedly observed, when
dragging their carts, spelling their letters at their work."</p>
<p>In a work which was written by the same gentleman, and in which
he deals with the crimes committed in penal colonies, occurs this
passage:&mdash;"There is another class of crime too frightful even
for the imagination of other lands, which St. Paul, in detailing
the vices of the heathen, has not contemplated; which were unknown
to the savage until taught by the convict&mdash;crimes which are
notorious&mdash;crimes that, dare I describe them, would make your
blood to freeze and your hair to rise in horror upon the pale
flesh." Before the Committee he said:&mdash;"I have gone through a
great deal of pain and torture of mind in consequence of the
horrors which I have witnessed in the colonies and particularly in
the penal settlements, and I have such an intense conscientious
feeling upon that subject, and of the result of those evils, in the
thorough breaking up of the moral man, which ensues from the crime,
that I would do anything that is lawful&mdash;I would even
deliberately give my life if I could in any manner lawfully
contribute to the removal of that evil. I allude to unnatural
crime. I am convinced that wherever a number of bad men are brought
together and continue together for any length of time, and are
crowded together there is a great deal of that crime. I believe it
exists in the Barracks at Sydney. The effect of permitting the boys
to mix with the men in the day is very bad&mdash;the moral
contamination upon the boys is very great indeed. I observe that
generally there are from 16 to 20 boys arrive in a ship with the
men. I used to caution particularly young boys, on the very day of
their arrival, of the temptations to which they would be subject in
the Barracks; and I remember in one instance being told by a boy, a
very young boy, he could not be more than 10 or 12 at the most,
that that very morning he had been attacked by a man at the
Barracks. The boys were frequently designated by female names in
the Barracks. It is impossible that these crimes should cease so
long as they are crowded together. When I returned from Norfolk
Island (where two men who were sentenced to death declared that
two-thirds of the island were implicated in the crime) I suggested
what I thought would be a means of preventing it to a considerable
extent. I proposed that the prisoners should each be separated from
the other by a sort of boarded partition; that there should be two
lamps, one suspended at each end of the apartment; and that there
should be likewise two watchman in each apartment&mdash;one at each
end, and that no communication whatever should be allowed between
the convicts, and no words spoken during the night."</p>
<p>Many other testimonies might be given to shew the depth of
depravity existing in Norfolk Island, all bearing in the same
direction&mdash;indicating that the unfortunate beings who were
condemned to servitude there gave up all hope, and with the giving
up abandoned themselves to abominations unmentionable. The convicts
themselves declared: "When a man comes to this island he loses the
heart of a man and gets the heart of a beast."</p>
<p>The Rev. H. T. Stiles, who visited the Island, said:&mdash;"If I
were called on to characterise briefly the moral state of the mass
of prisoners at the settlement, I should say it is marked by
recklessness, despair, and a readiness, arising from the latter
feeling, to perpetrate any atrocity which would afford them a fair
chance of escaping from their present misery. Of the nature of this
despair, the state of mind of Burrows, who was executed for murder
in December, 1835, affords an illustration. He assured me when in
the condemned cell that he had resolved to commit the crime which
led to his execution long before its actual perpetration; that his
object was not revenge or hatred to the individual whom he chose as
his victim, but a general feeling of intense wretchedness, from
which, by some means or other, he must rid himself, even though it
were to be by his own death. In this state of mind as he was one
day walking in the gang, he suddenly raised the spade with which he
was going to work, and with it cleft in two the skull of the man
who happened to be walking before him."</p>
<p>I could multiply such testimony <i>ad infinitum,</i> but as I
wish simply to convey a general idea of the condition of convict
life in this veritable charnel house of souls degraded, I have
contended myself with giving the testimony of men who "testified
that they had seen!" The evidence given by that humane priest, Dr.
Ullathorne (who afterwards became Bishop of Birmingham, and who
only died the year this story was being written&mdash;in 1889) is
thoroughly reliable. The deep depravity and frightful sufferings of
the wretched felons at Norfolk Island had become a proverb amongst
their fellows in New South Wales, anyone of whom would sooner stand
upon the gallows than face the horrors of that hell upon earth.</p>
<p>Convicts murdered their fellows, casting lots for the privilege
of being the victim and the slayer, the latter courting the death
penalty which he knew would be passed upon him, and the comrades of
the two chief actors in the tragedy volunteering evidence in order
that they might as witnesses obtain a temporary respite during the
journey to and from Sydney, where the trials were held, although
they knew that their return to the Island would follow the
execution of their comrade. So notorious had this fact become that
it was made the subject of special legislative enactment, providing
for the trial of such criminals by special commission on the
island; and this led to a reduction in the number of such
atrocities.</p>
<p>Speaking of the prosecution of six of the convicts for the
murder in connection with the piracy of the brig "Governor
Phillip," Judge Therry (who was then Attorney-General)
says:&mdash;"At their trial the prisoners subpoenaed some witnesses
from the island who really could have known nothing of the outrage,
for the whole scene was transacted at sea, two miles from the
shore, and the only real object in summoning these witnesses was to
give them a <i>spell</i> from the island. Never can the dismal
appearance of these witnesses be erased from the memory of those
who saw them in the witness-box. Some of them had been two or three
years upon the island. Their sunken glazed eyes, deadly-pale faces,
hollow fleshless cheeks, and once manly limbs, shrivelled and
withered up as if by premature old age, created a thrill of horror
among the bystanders. They were all under thirty-five years of age.
They swore what they knew not of, and cared not what they swore. Of
these six or seven witnesses there was not one who had not from
time to time undergone the punishment of <i>1,000 lashes each and
upwards.</i> They were as little reclaimable by the lash as if so
many drops of water had been poured upon their backs. They looked
less like human beings than the shadow of gnomes that had risen
from their sepulchral abode. What man ever was or ever could be
reclaimed under such a system as this? Who can say in reference to
such a system that the language pronounced with fearful energy by
Cavenagh, one of that class, upon his trial, is devoid of
truth?&mdash;'When I landed here I had the heart of a man in me,
but you have plucked it out and planted the heart of a brute in its
stead!' Happily for humanity, that abomination upon earth, Norfolk
Island, as it then existed, is no more. (The Judge wrote in 1863).
From its disastrous and dread example the English nation and the
nations of the world should take warning never to incur again the
fearful responsibility of hoarding together a band exclusively of
men the worst outcasts of society, and allowing them to live under
a system from which the charities of life were excluded, and under
which the lash, the dungeon, and the scaffold were the only
instruments used to reform and reclaim fallen man. Who can deny
that under such a system, not only is 'transportation worse than
death,' but that the infliction of death itself is in comparison
the extension and exercise of a mighty mercy?"</p>
<p>The same writer cites an instance, which came under his own
observation, of death being preferred by a convict to imprisonment
on the Island. In 1830 he had acted as counsel for two men charged
with burglary, and the men were convicted and sentenced to death,
but the sentence was afterwards commuted to transportation for life
at Norfolk Island. They had been there about a year when a
notorious bushranger named Webber was apprehended, tried and
sentenced to death. The day before his execution Webber sent for
Judge Therry and he visited him in the condemned cell, when the
condemned man informed him that the two men whom he had defended in
the burglary case were innocent, he having alone committed the act
for which they had been transported. In proof of the truth of his
statement he told where certain of the stolen articles had been
"planted" by him, and search being made, the stolen goods were
found in the place indicated. The men were thereupon released from
Norfolk Island. The rest of the story is best told in Judge
Therry's own words:&mdash;</p>
<p>"But now," he writes, "comes the most affecting scene of the
eventful drama. Moved by an impression that a man who had thus
rescued two fellow-creatures from an undeserved sentence of
transportation&mdash;it had well-high been one of death&mdash;might
be put to a better account than that of being hanged, I visited
Webber again and told him that, though I could hold out no hope of
pardon on my own authority, yet I would be glad to be instrumental,
at least, in endeavouring to save his life; that, with that view, I
would represent to Government his meritorious conduct in the case
of the Atkinson burglary; and that, if he would follow up that
conduct in making reparation to society by disclosing how he had
disposed of the proceeds of the many robberies he had for several
years been engaged in committing, I would apprize the Government of
this disposition on his part, and it was probable his life would be
spared. Now, mark! This suggestion was made after his death warrant
had been read to him, at a time, too, when he knew he had only
twenty-four hours to live. Never shall I forget his reply to the
proposal. 'No, sir, I thank you; but I will disclose nothing. All I
could gain by it would be to be sent to Norfolk Island, and <i>I
would rather he hanged than go there. Don't trouble yourself about
me; leave me to my fate.'</i> At the hour mentioned in the death
warrant Webber was executed."</p>
<p>As shewing the condition of things on the Island for the four
years preceding 1839, it will not be out of place for me here to
quote from an old document, which fell into my hands nearly half a
century after it was written. It was then in the possession of the
son of the writer, who had served on the Island for many years as
Government Chaplain, and who possessed intimate knowledge of the
inner working of the establishment. Here is what the writer
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In taking a general view of the affairs of Norfolk Island since
its establishment as a penal settlement, it will be found that the
most efficient improvements have been made within the last five
years, both as regards the condition of the settlement and the
prisoners; not merely because a greater facility has offered
latterly than formerly, but a more effectual system has been worked
to bring it about. To any one acquainted with the settlement, its
appearance now from what it was five years ago will silently speak
that something has been done. The recovery of the swamp in front of
Government House, converting a useless and often flooded piece of
ground into a very tastefully laid-out plantation, deserves to be
mentioned; and in place of a ditch through the settlement and
centre of it (the water coming from the hills, afterwards running
into the sea), a handsome canal has been cut, giving the place an
attractive appearance. The cutting away of Red Bank as a site for
the new Military Barracks was indeed a gigantic undertaking both in
theory and practice. A short description will better explain it. It
being necessary to erect another barracks for the military, the
first one erected having been found to be too small, it necessarily
became a matter of importance where it should be built. The land
about the settlement is not fit to raise heavy buildings on, from
its swampy nature; besides, it was of consequence that the position
of the new barracks should be a commanding one. To obtain this
effectually no alternative offered except cutting down part of a
hill 300 feet in depth and nearly 80 feet in height, which was
required to be removed by well-regulated gangs, with a front of 700
feet in length; this was accomplished and the barrack erected in a
much shorter time than could have been at first supposed. In a line
with the new barrack, on part of the same ground, was also built
the new Commissariat Stores, the handsomest and largest building
(except the prisoners' barrack) on the Island. The two above
splendid buildings, with many others for civil officers, such as
cottages for the clergy, &amp;c., prove that something had been
done in the way of building. A new gaol was commenced in a line
with the prisoners' barrack, which doubtless would have been
completed long since had not the foundation given way from the
cause before mentioned, the swampy state of the ground, judgment on
the part of the Clerk of Works in charge on the Island at the time
being at fault in this case. The Agricultural Department has been
more successful since 1834 than at any time previous. At length the
Island is enabled to support its population with grain and
vegetables of all kind; the prisoners having nevertheless increased
more in number on the settlement during the last five years than
were on it altogether before; their condition is also much better.
Since Major Anderson's command there has been no mutiny, no
carrying off the boats, and comparatively few heinous
offences&mdash;such as attempts at murder, &amp;c. Several, it is
true, have 'taken to the bush,' but a few days have been the limit
of their absence. There was for a long time a classification
evidently requisite. The prisoners did not know on what parallel of
hope they stood. They were indiscriminately mixed at work and in
barrack; the best behaved could not tell for certain that he was
noticed beyond the greatest 'out-and-outer' on the Island.
Commutation of sentences had previously been granted to some 'lucky
ones,' while others who had served longer and been fewer times at
Court for offences could not obtain this privilege. Major Anderson
in his subsequent recommendations for commutation and remission of
sentences invariably examined the police record himself, and
consequently rescued some well-behaved men from misery. Concessions
of all kinds were only granted to those who had served certain
probationary periods, clear of crime. A first class was established
by order from Head Quarters several years ago, allowing those
admitted some few small indulgences which will be explained more
fully hereafter; yet everyone that deserved it could not get
admitted till late years, for it was not that kind of
classification that was requisite and has since been established.
It is named by the Commandant, Major Anderson, 'The Local
Classification,' and its detail is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. That all prisoners on the Island who are two years clear of
any recorded offences in the police registers shall form the first
local class; these are allowed the best rooms and accommodation in
barracks to sleep in; first class rooms containing not more than 38
men and some only 22; the men are worked in gangs called first
class gangs by themselves, with any indulgences that can be
consistently allowed them; are in messes by themselves and eligible
to be employed in any lighter work their superintendents may
direct.</p>
<p>2nd. That all other prisoners, those of known bad character and
malingerers, (those who continually go to Hospital under pretence
of sickness, maiming themselves in different ways, some even
applying lime and other injurious things to blind themselves)
excepted, shall form the second class; these also are worked in
gangs by themselves, mess by themselves, and are allowed the second
best rooms and accommodation in barrack to sleep in; they remain in
this class until completing two years clear of recorded crime, they
are then admitted into the first class.</p>
<p>3rd. That all known bad characters and malingerers shall form
the third class and be allowed the worst rooms and accommodation in
barrack to sleep in; shall be exclusively worked in gangs by
themselves, and not eligible for any indulgence whatever. Whilst in
the third class, not even allowed to go into another prisoners'
garden in the meal hours, or allowed out of the Lumber Yard during
that time, except at stated periods to wash their clothes; they
must complete one year of uninterrupted good conduct in the third
class before they can be admitted to the second class, and progress
as before stated.</p>
<p>The numbers were, on the establishment of the system, 28th
December, 1838, as follows:&mdash;1st class, 648; 2nd class, 691;
3rd class, 107. The prisoners now see in what comparison they stand
one to the other. No instance of a first class man having degraded
himself to the loss of his class has as yet occurred, and so well
have they been selected that out of 100 cases tried before the
Police Court this present first month of the system working, 86
were 3rd class men. The benefit of this system of class is more and
more evinced every day. A great deal of bad practice and crime was
put a stop to by removing the bad characters from the
others&mdash;those who had often stolen, or were found fighting,
confined for not taking proper care of their clothes, &amp;c. The
prisoners were also known by the mark 1, 2 or 3 on each article of
clothing, showing to which class they belonged. This particular
circumstance is strictly attended to, being at once an 'exposee' of
every prisoner that offends.</p>
<p>"The system is certainly a wise one, and will, if narrowly
watched in its regulations, be of essential service, as some
benefit may arise to the men not yet developed. This is hoped for
by many, and tends in a great measure to make them hold fast their
stations. The old regulations of 1831 are still in operation and
are acted upon as prisoners become due under their different
clauses, namely:&mdash;Capital respites for life not allowed to be
recommended for a commutation of sentence until they have completed
ten years of uninterrupted good conduct at the settlement; then
when recommended they are commuted to 14 or 7 years from the date
of such commutation, and thereafter commence such commuted sentence
the same as if just arrived. And as hereunder: The 14 years men to
be eligible for the first (not local) class after 4 years good
conduct at the settlement, and after 8 years in the first class to
be eligible for the remainder of Colonial sentence being remitted
upon the recommendation of the Commandant. Seven years men (not
having been capitally respited) to be eligible for the first class
(not local) after two years' good conduct on the settlement, and
after four years in the first class are eligible, upon
recommendation of the Commandant, to have the remainder of their
colonial sentence remitted. Under 7 years to be eligible for the
1st (not local) class after one year's good behaviour on the
settlement. Constables and overseers to be selected from the first
class (not local); two years as a constable or overseer to be
reckoned in all cases as three years of other service. In the event
of misbehaviour all claims previously earned to be forfeited.
Prisoners sentenced to wear irons for life or for 14 years not
allowed to have one iron removed until completing 12 months
uninterrupted good conduct on the Island; prisoners sentenced to
any shorter period than 7 years in irons not to apply to have one
iron removed until having completed 8 months good conduct on the
Island; prisoners not eligible to apply to be recommended to the
Governor for the indulgence of having their irons wholly taken off
until they have completed the undermentioned probationary
periods&mdash;prisoners sentenced to wear irons, if for life or 14
years, after three years: if for 7 years, after 2 years; under 7
years, after one year.</p>
<p>"From and after the commencement of 1838, the Governor and
Commandant endeavoured to ameliorate the condition of the prisoners
and offer encouragement to such of them as were inclined to get
away from Norfolk Island, and passed an Act to the following
effect:&mdash;(1). That such of them sentenced to 7 years at that
penal settlement who had conducted themselves in a satisfactory
manner for 12 months should be eligible to be commended to His
Excellency for a removal to Head Quarters to be worked in irons on
the roads or such other places as may be directed for a period not
exceeding three years. (2). Prisoners sentenced to 14 years at
Norfolk Island to be in a like manner eligible to be recommended
after completing 3 years of good conduct at the settlement. (3).
Prisoners sentenced for life at Norfolk Island to be in like manner
eligible to be recommended after completing 5 years of good conduct
at that settlement. The first draft of prisoners, 60 in number, who
received this indulgence left the Island on the 30th of January,
1839.</p>
<p>"The following was the scale of rations on the Island at the
close of 1838:&mdash;No 1 rations allowed to free overseers and
those not under sentence to the Island, per diem:&mdash;1 lb.
wheaten meal, &frac12; lb. maize meal, 1 oz. sugar, &frac14; oz. soap, &frac12; oz.
salt, 1lb. beef or 10 oz. salt pork. Confirmed overseers, prisoners
on the Island, per diem:&mdash;1 lb. maize meal, 10 oz. wheaten
meal, 1 oz. sugar, &frac14; oz. soap, &frac12; oz. salt, 1 lb. beef or 10 oz.
salt pork, 1/8 oz. tobacco. Acting overseers who had to serve a
probationary period of three months before they were confirmed, per
diem:&mdash;1&frac12;lbs. maize meal, 6oz. wheaten meal, 1 oz. sugar, &frac14;
oz. soap, &frac12; oz. salt, 1 lb. beef or 10 oz. salt pork, and 1/8 oz.
tobacco, if in 1st class, but not otherwise. First class men (not
local) 1/8 oz. tobacco, per diem. Two suits of slops were allowed
to each prisoner in the year, the issues being on 1st November and
1st May; the confirmed overseers being allowed a blue jacket in
place of a grey jacket or duck frock, and an extra pair of shoes
for the winter half year, issued to them on the 1st August."</p>
<p>In 1841 Cockatoo Island, near the entrance of the Parramatta
River, was established, many of the doubly convicted prisoners from
Norfolk Island being brought there, and others of them being sent
to Van Diemen's Land. Instructions were sent to the colony for the
removal of all the doubly-convicted prisoners from the island, as
the British authorities wished to make it exclusively a place for
the reception of convicts direct from Great Britain, transportation
to New South Wales having then virtually ceased. But these orders
could not be carried out, and although some of the doubly-convicted
prisoners were removed to the places named, a large number still
remained at Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>A new system of treatment was then tried under a fresh
commandant, Captain Machonochie, the convicts remaining and the
fresh ones transported direct from England being treated under it.
But the experiment proved worse than a failure. Under the old
regime the convicts were mustered from their dormitories outside
the barrack gate, in gangs, by the muster roll, each man falling
into his gang as his name was called, and the whole being then
marched to labour. The men were rationed in messes, no cooking
utensils being allowed them, and the bread being baked in the
bakehouse. On Captain Maconochie's arrival, however, the whole
system was changed. He proposed to secure good conduct by a display
of extra kindness, but the material upon which he had to work was
too well seasoned in vice to care for anything good, and under the
new rules, for the purpose of getting good marks and luxuries, they
added to their other vices that of hypocricy. He issued a week's
rations to the new hands in a raw state, and had cooking utensils
served out to them. Then the better disposed of the old hands were
allowed the same privileges, and after a while the greater part of
them possessed cooking utensils of some kind. Their labours were
also relaxed, and they were allowed to trade among themselves, to
keep pigs and poultry at their pleasure, and to dispose of them,
purchasing sugar, eggs, bacon, poultry, sausages, corn, &amp;c.
with the proceeds, several stalls and shops being set up in the
settlement. During this time there were nearly 2000 convicts on the
Island and the system was continued until found to be valueless as
a corrective.</p>
<p>Captain Machonochie had come out as private secretary to Sir
John Franklin, the celebrated Arctic Navigator, who succeeded
Governor Arthur, in Tasmania, in 1837. The Captain had a benevolent
theory of his own concerning the treatment of convicts, concerning
which there was considerable discussion in England at the time, the
fact that there had been 442 capital convictions in the space of
three years having caused men to question whether hanging or
flogging were the best uses to which they could put their erring
fellow-men. Machonochie set himself to collect facts when he
arrived in the colony, and he embodied the results of his
investigation in a report, which he sent home to the Colonial
Office, without having fully explained the contents of the report
to Governor Franklin. On the publication of that report he was
dismissed by the Governor; and it having been decided to try what a
little kindness could do for the convicts, Machonochie was charged
by Governor Gipps with the commission of making the experiment at
Norfolk Island, receiving the appointment of Commandant for that
purpose. He entered with great zeal upon his labours, and the eyes
of the convicts were made to open wide with astonishment at the
extraordinary change in the method of treating them which had taken
place. Machonochie at once removed all traces of the severest
discipline. The gaol doors were thrown open and the prisoners were
allowed great freedom. The "mark" or reward system by which they
could obtain freedom by good behaviour was explained to them and
they were exhorted and entreated to avail themselves of the
blessings within their reach. In May, 1840, 1800 prisoners on the
Island were for one day (Queen's Birthday) set absolutely free to
join in a general "spree," at which sports and a theatrical
performance took place. The men sang and danced, chewed tobacco and
drank rum (those luxuries being served out to them by the
officers), and cheered Her Majesty the Queen and His Honor the
Commandant, as though they were loyal and dutiful
subjects&mdash;law-abiding and respectable citizens of a rising
state. For that day they certainly were all this. They were
surprised into virtue, and no disorder marred the festivities. One
writer says:&mdash;"Its novelty gave to Machonochie's system the
air of delirium; the disciplinarians of the <i>ancient regime</i>
raised their hands in astonishment."</p>
<p>But as already intimated, the system failed. The reaction was
brought about by the daring attempt of twelve unarmed convicts, who
were engaged in discharging the cargo, to capture the brig
"Governor Phillip," with twelve soldiers and eighteen seamen on
board&mdash;after the manner already described in a previous
chapter.</p>
<p>Captain Machonochie was re-called in 1844, and a new Commandant,
Major Childs, was sent to the Island. The new Commandant by degrees
sought to re-introduce the old order of things, but with most
disastrous results. As it was found that the men were in the habit
of stealing and killing the Government sheep and cooking the mutton
for themselves, doing the same with the officers' poultry, it was
resolved that their cooking utensils should be taken away from
them, and this resolve was carried out when the men were in their
berths at night. Next morning, when they discovered what had been
done, there were mutterings and black looks in the ranks, and the
authorities feared an outbreak; yet they did not take even ordinary
precautions. The storm burst suddenly. The men, in a mob of 500
rushed the stores and recaptured their cooking utensils. The
nearest military guard was 250 yards off and out of sight, and
there were only a few constables without arms on the spot.
Proceeding to the central station police hut they sacked the place
and hunted the constables, then rushing upon their custodians. The
military then arrived and drove the prisoners into the barrack
yard, securing every man whose dress was disordered or who had
blood upon his hands, for blood had been spilt, they having killed
two constables, one of the overseers, and the gatekeeper, besides
having wounded half a dozen others. For this outrage twenty-nine
convicts were brought up and tried, and fourteen of them were
hanged on 23rd September, 1846.</p>
<p>In his report upon this outbreak the gentleman chosen for the
purpose wrote the two following significant paragraphs:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In the removal of the cooking utensils from the prisoners I
cannot see a sufficient reason for the murderous outbreak of July
last, except in what I gathered from some of the murderers prior to
their deaths. Horrible though it be, I consider that I am bound to
make known to you what I learnt from them shortly before their
execution. Many of these wretched beings acknowledged to me that
for years, indeed, almost from their first conviction, they had
been given to unnatural practices, declaring that the crime
prevailed to a great extent, both in Van Diemen's Land and this
Island; and from one I learnt that those who pandered to their
passions were paid in tobacco, extra provisions, fancy articles
made for them, and any indulgences they could obtain to induce them
to yield to their brutal desires. That being deprived of their
cooking utensils they would have been unable to prepare the food
they might surreptitiously obtain for the objects of their lust;
and that this aroused their savage and ferocious passions to a
pitch of madness. This is the tale of a man about to die. The
relation of these abominable practices came from men who in a few
days knew they must be numbered with the dead; and I have no reason
to doubt the horrible confession.</p>
<p>"The address of another to myself on entering his cell was to
this effect: 'Sir, as you value your soul, separate both here and
at Van Diemen's Land, as much as possible, my class of people. We
are nearly all given to unnatural practices. I have witnessed
scenes which you would not believe were I to recount them, and
which are not fit to be related. The flash men you see with made
over-clothes and fancy articles are given to these practices. No
check can be given to it but by separating the men as much as
possible, and I beseech you to use you best endeavours to let the
men sleep in cells."</p>
<p>In the year in which these occurrences took place there were
still between 1,500 and 2,000 convicts on the Island. What a mass
of seething corruption it must have been! And we may well marvel
that the offended Being in whose sight this huge company of
"fellows of the baser sort" carried on their vile practices, did
not cause the whole corrupted and corrupting mass to sink out of
sight and knowledge in the sea.</p>
<p>After the failure of Machonochie's system, and the "probation"
system, subsequently tried, it dawned upon the minds of the
authorities that the evil of convictism as there exemplified was
too gross for cure by the application of simple correctives, and
that nothing short of total uprooting would avail. By degrees the
convicts were all removed to Tasmania, where they were distributed
upon the public works of the colony, and amongst the settlers as
labourers and shepherds, the more humane treatment adopted having
its result in something like general reform.</p>
<p>In 1856 the inhabitants of Pitcairn Island, the decendants of
John Adams and the other surviving mutineers of the "Bounty," were
transshipped thither, the Island having been bestowed upon them by
the English Government, as their own Island had grown too strait
for the swelling numbers of this peculiar "family colony." The
vessel which brought them carried off to Tasmania the last remnants
of the convict establishment so long and so terribly identified
with the place. All the buildings erected by the convicts were
appropriated to the use of the new inhabitants, with a large number
of sheep, cattle, pigs, drays and tools requisite for agricultural
pursuits. In 1857 Sir W. Denison, Governor of New South Wales,
visited the Island, and framed regulations suited to the
requirements of its new occupants.</p>
<p>The last of the New South Wales Governors to visit the Island
was His Excellency Lord Carrington, the visit being made in 1887,
for the purpose of settling some trifling difficulties connected
with the land. From the reports then published it is clear that the
remaining descendents of the Islanders have lost a good deal of
that indolence which characterised their forefathers, and that the
present occupants of the once home of human devils and their
keepers fully appreciate the advantages and comforts which have
been secured to them.</p>

THIEVING, LICENTIOUS PEOPLE&mdash;A PLEASING CHANGE.</p>
<p>AS already stated, it was during the administration of Governor
King that Van Diemen's Land was taken possession of and occupied as
a dependency of New South Wales. It was deemed necessary to relieve
the parent settlement at Port Jackson of some of the more dangerous
and riotous convicts of the 7,000 who up to that time had been
transported thither. "Thus," says West, "Van Diemen's Land was
colonized; first as a place of exile for the more felonious of
felons&mdash;the Botany Bay of Botany Bay."</p>
<p>The first occupants, under the command of Lieut. Bowen, entered
the river Derwent early in 1803. In January of the following year,
the small armed force and party of convicts who had been sent out
in charge of Governor Collins to form a settlement on the shores of
Port Phillip, were also removed to Van Diemen's Land, the attempt
to form the settlement having failed. Collins landed with his party
on the spot where Hobart now stands, and we are told that the party
under Bowen who had preceded them were "found in a most wretched
state, almost approaching starvation." While Collins was engaged in
the preliminaries of settlement at Hobart Town, Governor King
despatched a small party of prisoners under Colonel Patterson to
Port Dalrymple, where the latter established York Town. Two years
afterwards, however, that settlement was removed to the spot where
Launceston now stands, the place receiving its name from Patterson.
For some time there was no communication between the settlement on
the Derwent and that on the Tamar, and it was not until the year
1812 that both sides of the island were united under the one
government.</p>
<p>The settlers who were removed from Norfolk Island to Van
Diemen's Land formed the nucleus of that free population which grew
up there side by side with the convicts. The new colony for many
years experienced difficulties similar in every respect to those
which beset the older settlement in New South Wales, and the story
of its rise and progress furnish incidents quite as remarkable as
any of those recorded of the parent colony; but I must pass by all
this and confine my attention to the convicts and their
treatment.</p>
<p>Soon after the settlement had been established convicts, male
and female, were sent thither direct from England, and the voyage
across the water of the transports was similar in every respect, as
regards the conduct and treatment of the prisoners, to that of the
convicts ships which terminated at Port Jackson. We are told that
although wooden barriers to the women's quarters were erected at
starting, they were soon removed, and the women were free to
frequent every part of the ship under certain conditions. "Both
male and female prisoners," says Rev. John West, "were frequently
forwarded together; the officers and soldiers selected companions
for the voyage, and a sentence of transportation included
prostitution. It is not incredible that modest women rejected life
on such terms, and preferred a public execution to the ignominy of
a floating brothel. These practices were first tolerated, and
afterwards justified as politic." The captain of one of the ships,
referring to this subject, says: "The unhappy male convicts are
denied, save occasionally, these profligate liberties (the right of
selection enjoyed by the officers). Occasionally, however, they
range into the quarters assigned to the women. The males,
accustomed in London to indiscriminate license, discover the
greatest regret at the restraint of their passions, in the greatest
oaths and in the coarsest language. The females, who rather
resemble the brutes than rational creatures in their excesses,
answer their reproaches and rage with equal effrontery and
unbounded impudence. It is a scene like Pandemonium&mdash;a second
Hell." In later years, however, owing chiefly to the publication of
the facts by a Captain who viewed with loathing the abominable
transactions, the authorities provided suitable ships and selected
suitable officers for the voyage, while a committee of Christian
ladies in London watched the departure of their fallen and
condemned sisters, and provided them with comforts and strengthened
them with advice to which the earlier voyagers were strangers. By
this means much of the evil was removed; but even under the best
regulations it was impossible to prevent abuses on the voyage,
seeing that in many cases the women were themselves the chief
offenders, and not only readily encouraged debauch on board, but
made existence almost unbearable to those of their prison mates
whose modesty or desire for a better life caused them to hold aloof
from the evil practices in which the ringleaders were
indulging.</p>
<p>On first landing the position of the female convicts was,
perhaps, even worse than it had been on board the ship. As I have
said, no lodgings were provided for them, and they were almost
compelled to seek the "protection" of one or other of the officers
or male ex-convicts who offered to give them shelter. Those who
possessed the charm of good looks, experienced no difficulty in
finding lodgings, but some of their less favored sisters fared very
badly. Even in the prison, which was always well supplied with
female inmates, the career of vice was continued, male warders,
themselves convicts, being the only attendants, and the higher
authorities being indifferent to anything transpiring within the
walls, provided it fell short of open rebellion. The females did
not work in prison at that time, but according to one writer the
refractory among them were exposed to punishment at once
undignified and severe. Previous to Governor Arthur's time a
frequent punishment inflicted on females was "the placing of an
iron collar round their necks, on each side of which was a long
prong, which gave them the appearance of horned cattle; and with
this head-dress they were exposed in church during service." Mr.
Commissioner Bigge in his report to the House of Commons makes the
following statement: "The female convicts, for want of any separate
room in the prison, were placed in a small wooden hut, near the
blacksmith's forge, now converted into a church, and a constable
was placed over them to prevent their escape. This mode of
punishment was found so inefficient that latterly the female
convicts were sent to George Town, where they cohabited with the
Government convicts." Subsequently a female factory was
established, from which the women could be hired for service in
private families, but the conduct of this establishment was no
better than that of its twin sister in Parramatta, which has
already been fully described. In his work "Curious facts of Old
Colonial Days," Bonwick says of this nest of unclean birds: "Even
within the author's experience of the colony, the female factory
had some bidding aspects. It was the seat of idleness, the resort
of the vicious. The atmosphere was polluted with the fumes of
tobacco smoked by the women; and the walls echoed with the shrieks
of passion, the peals of foolish laughter, and the oaths of common
converse. The beginners in the walks of vice associated with the
abandoned veterans of vice." How marvellous is it that the evil
flowing from this nest of beings polluted, so long continued and so
fully occupied, is not now to be traced in that fairest of all
Australia's fair Islands&mdash;Tasmania!</p>
<p>The chief penal settlements of Van Diemen's Land&mdash;the
places to which the worst of the male convicts were sent for
greater safety and severer punishment&mdash;were Macquarie Harbour
and Port Arthur.</p>
<p>Of Macquarie Harbour, West, in his "History of Tasmania,"
says:&mdash;"The name is associated exclusively with remembrance of
inexpressible depravity, degradation, and woe. Sacred to the genius
of torture, nature concurred with the objects of its separation
from the rest of the world; to exhibit some notion of a perfect
misery. There, man lost the aspect, and the heart of man."</p>
<p>That the punishment inflicted there by the overseers was
somewhat rigorous, is borne out by the following facts, taken
haphazard from the records:&mdash;Of eighty-five deaths only thirty
were from natural causes. Two thirds of the convicts in three years
had received 6,280 lashes, and out of 182 men, in 1822, there were
punished 169, no less than 7000 lashes being distributed between
them. During the ten years of its occupancy 112 prisoners tried to
escape, and 62 of them perished. What wonder that the creatures so
driven should turn upon each other and gamble, with death as the
stakes! The toss of a flat piece of wood would decide which of the
company should be murdered, who should commit the murder, or who
should be the witnesses. A blow would be struck and two sufferers
would be released from the horrors of the earthly prison&mdash;one
by violence at the hands of his mate, and the other by hanging at
the hands of the authorities; while the remainder of the company
would have a trip as far as Hobart Town and back again.</p>
<p>Concerning the state of society at the Harbour only one fact
need be mentioned here by way of illustration. When the first
appointed chaplain reached the settlement he found the chief
officers living in open and shameless concubinage with the convict
women. They refused to listen to his remonstrances&mdash;refused
even to assume the shadow of propriety, and the minister was
compelled to abandon his post.</p>
<p>What Norfolk Island was to New South Wales, Macquarie Harbour
and Port Arthur were to Van Diemen's Land&mdash;the drainage pools
of a heap of festering moral filth. The very worst convicts were
congregated there and the very worst phases of convictism were
there exhibited. The variety of the evil was infinite, but through
each of the classes into which it might be divided there ran a vein
of viciousness that is indescribable. The worst of the cases
mentioned by Marcus Clarke in his novel "For the Term of His
Natural Life" do not by any means disclose the full extent of the
distress and degradation, the suffering and shame, that there
existed. The most repulsive pictures in his story were drawn from
life, and yet they fall very far short of the reality. Macquarie
Harbour is thus graphically described by him:</p>
<p>"'Hell's Gates,' formed by a rocky point, which runs abruptly
northward, almost touches on its eastern side projecting arm of
land which guards the entrance to King's River. In the middle of
the gates is a natural bolt&mdash;that is to say, an
island&mdash;which, lying on a sand bar in the very jaws of the
current, creates a double whirlpool, impossible to pass in the
smoothest weather. Once through the gates, the convict, chained on
the deck of the inward-bound vessel, sees in front of him the bald
cone of the Frenchman's Cap, piercing the moist air at a height of
five thousand feet; while, gloomed by overhanging rocks, and
shadowed by gigantic forests, the black sides of the basin narrow
to the mouth of the Gordon. The turbulent stream is the colour of
Indigo, and, being fed by numerous rivulets, which ooze through
masses of decaying vegetable matter, is of so poisonous a nature
that it is not only undrinkable, but absolutely kills the fish,
which in stormy weather are driven in from the sea.... . The
head-quarters of the settlement were placed on an island not far
from the mouth of this inhospitable river, called Sarah Island.
Though now the whole place is desolate, and a few rotting posts and
logs alone remain&mdash;mute witnesses of scenes of agony never to
be revived, in the year 1833 the buildings were numerous and
extensive. On Phillip's Island, on the north side of the Harbour,
was a small farm, where vegetables were grown for the use of the
officers of the establishment; and, on Sarah Island were saw-pits,
forges, dockyard, gaol, guard-house, barracks, and jetty. The
military force numbered about sixty men, who, with convict warders
and constables, took charge of more than three hundred and fifty
prisoners. These miserable wretches, deprived of every hope, were
employed in the most degrading labour. No beast of burden was
allowed on the settlement; all the pulling and dragging was done by
human beings. About one hundred 'good-conduct' men were allowed the
lighter toil of dragging timber to the wharf, to assist in
ship-building; the others cut down the trees that fringed the
mainland, and carried them on their shoulders to the water's edge.
The denseness of the scrub and bush rendered it necessary for a
'roadway,' perhaps a quarter of a mile in length, to be first
constructed; and the trunks of trees, stripped of their branches,
were rolled together in this roadway until a 'slide' was made, down
which the heavier logs could be shunted towards the harbour. The
timber thus obtained was made into rafts and floated into sheds, or
arranged for transportation to Hobart Town. The convicts were
lodged on Sarah Island, in barracks flanked by a two-storied
prison, whose 'cells' were the terror of the most hardened. Each
morning they received their breakfast of porridge, water, and salt,
and then rowed, under the protection of their guard, to the
wood-cutting stations, where they worked without food, until night.
The launching and the hewing of the timber compelled them to work
up to their waists in water. Many of them were heavily ironed.
Those who died were buried on a little plot of ground, called
Halliday's Island (from the name of the first man buried there),
and a plank sunk into the earth, and carved with the initials of
the deceased, was the only monument vouchsafed him. Sarah Island,
situated at the south-east corner of the harbour is long and low.
The commandant's house was built in the centre, having the
chaplain's house and barracks between it and the gaol. The hospital
was on the west shore and in a line with it lay the two
penitentiaries. Lines of lofty palisades ran round the settlement,
giving it the appearance of a fortified town. These palisades were
built for the purpose of warding off the terrific blasts of wind,
which, shrieking through the long and narrow bay as through the
key-hole of a door, had in former times tore off roofs and levelled
boat-sheds. The little town was set, as it were, in defiance of
Nature, at the very extreme of civilization, and its inhabitants
maintained perpetual warfare with the wind and waves."</p>
<p>As the convicts were treated with even more severity at these
penal settlements than at Norfolk Island, they were rendered
correspondingly more reckless. In the words of Sir George Arthur,
some of them committed murder "in order to enjoy the excitement of
being sent up to Hobart Town for trial, although aware that in the
ordinary course they must be executed within a fortnight after
arrival."</p>
<p>The diet of the prisoners was different according to the nature
of their offence, which determined the class of gang they worked
in. The convicts who had just arrived each received 1 lb. meat
daily, 1&frac14;lb. bread, with 4oz. oatmeal for breakfast, and 7 drachms
of sugar; salt not being required, as the food was salt. These
formed the first class. The second class of prisoners were those
who had been there some time and had committed offences&mdash;these
were called the chain gang, and they received 1&frac14; lb. of bread, 4oz.
oatmeal, and 7 drachms of sugar, but no meat; no tea was allowed,
but they could drink as much water from the bay as they
desired.</p>
<p>The chief part of the convict population resided upon the same
island as the military and officers, but about half-a-mile off
there was a small rock, which rock was used as a place of
punishment for the refractory convicts to be sent to at night, in
order that they might be separated as much as possible from the
others. This was considered the minor degree of punishment, but it
was very severe. Men who misconducted themselves were sent to sleep
on the island, and it seldom happened that they could land on the
rock without getting wet, probably up to the waist or neck, and the
result was that they must either sleep in their wet clothes or
sleep without clothing. The greater part of them slept in their
clothes, and particularly those who had chains on, and nine-tenths
of the poor wretches were in heavy irons. Fires were not allowed
after eight o'clock at night. The prisoners were chiefly employed
cutting timber for export to Hobart Town. The second kind of
punishment was stopping the meat; the third kind placing them in
the chain gang to work in irons, and the most laborious part of the
work, that which they dreaded the most&mdash;working in water and
assisting in building small piers about the island, carrying stones
and even diving for them.</p>
<p>Flogging was the next punishment, and this was inflicted very
frequently and freely. Official returns shew that on the average of
five years (1822-6 inclusive) there were 245 prisoners of whom 167
were annually punished by flogging, and that the total number of
lashes inflicted was 33,723, and the annual average 6,744. The
cat-o'-nine-tails in use was a much heavier instrument and larger
than the one ordinarily used, which was called a single cat, this
one being a "thief's cat," or double cat. It did not comprise more
than the usual number of tails, but each tail was a double twist of
whipcord, and each contained nine knots. The effect of the
floggings is thus described by the surgeon of the establishment; "I
never, during the 18 months I was there witnessed any severe
illness follow flagellation. I have occasionally had them in the
hospital, and remain for a month or two, but the back generally
healed very well, and no unfortunate consequences followed; no
illness took place. Occasionally, in some men of full habit of
body, it would be necessary to bleed them, and to apply other
remedies in order to keep down inflammatory action, but generally
the part contained a large quantity of coagulated blood, which
sloughed and healed up. Sometimes fever came on and abscesses
formed, but these were rare occurrences."</p>
<p>The same official also tells the following story, illustrative
of the life at the Harbour:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The convicts appeared to be very much degraded by the
floggings. I could relate many instances in which convicts who had
never been punished with the cat before their arrival at Macquarie
Harbour, who, after their punishment there, became so very much
degraded by their punishment that they sometimes told me they
should never be satisfied till they had been executed for some
further offence. They considered it a most unmanly kind of
punishment. I remember one instance of a man being punished a few
days after his arrival for attempting to steal a boat with another
party; that individual received 100 lashes, which was the maximum
of punishment with the cat-o'-nine-tails. After he was taken down
from the halberds he immediately turned round to me and said; 'It
is the first time I have been punished by the cat, and it shall be
the last; the first opportunity I have of committing a crime which
will send me before the Criminal Court shall be one which shall
hang me.' And the man's words were verified, for he was executed
for an offence committed at Macquarie Harbour, and that offence was
the murder of his constable; and I believe three or four out of the
same party who were punished that day for the same offence were
executed for the same murder."</p>
<p>The constant desire of the convicts was to escape, and whenever
they had an opportunity they took advantage of it. From 3rd
January, 1822, to 16th May, 1827, a return shews that out of 116
who absconded, 75 were supposed to have perished in the woods, one
was hanged for murdering and eating his companion, two were shot by
the military, eight are known to have been murdered by their
companions, six of whom were eaten; 24 escaped, 13 were hanged for
bushranging, and two for murder; making a total of 101 out of the
116 who met with an untimely fate. The authority for supposing that
75 perished in the woods was that they were never heard of, and the
skeletons of some were found upon the shore, the shore being the
only place where they could get food. Sometimes within a mile of
the settlement bodies were found of convicts, who, in all
probability, were coming to deliver themselves up, and who died
from want before they reached "home." They could not possibly get
through the woods, although one case is on record where an escaped
prisoner, named Pierce, got through and reached the settled part of
the country by sacrificing six of his companions, upon whose flesh
he lived. The full confession of this cannibal convict will be
given in a subsequent chapter.</p>
<p>Among those who absconded from Macquarie Harbour were fourteen
men in a body. This was in 1824. The convicts, known as "Brady's
Gang," seized a whaleboat and got to the Derwent, when they were
compelled to abandon her. After committing several murders and
plundering the inhabitants in various parts of the country they
were all apprehended, tried, convicted, and hanged. They committed
great atrocities, laying the country under contribution, and
setting the military authorities at defiance for nearly two years.
The two leaders, Brady and McCabe, quarrelled and McCabe was the
first man taken. Some of the others were shot by the military, some
were captured and hanged, but other convicts joined them at
intervals from other parts of the colony and the gang was kept up.
On one occasion they captured the surgeon of the settlement, who
was on the road with a letter from the governor to a magistrate
giving information as to the whereabouts of the gang; but they
treated him kindly, owing to his having on one occasion reduced the
punishment to which some of their number were being subjected at
the Harbour. They took his watch and money, but with grim humour
returned him his lancet, saying that it might at some future time
prove of service to them in his hands. From 1824 to 1827 Van
Diemen's Land was invested with bands of bushrangers, but Brady's
gang was the most formidable and desperate that ever roamed at
large.</p>
<p>As already stated, the convicts at Macquarie Harbour frequently
committed crime in order to be removed from the settlement. It was
no uncommon occurrence for a man, while he was in bed asleep, to
receive a wound from one of his fellow prisoners, whose sole object
was to be sent down to Hobart Town to be tried by the Criminal
Court. Outrage was generally planned by a party with this object in
view. One of them inflicted the injury, and the others were to come
forward for the purpose of swearing before the commanding officer
that they saw the offence committed, the result being that they
were sent to Hobart Town as witnesses. On their arrival, and when
the prisoner was put on his trial, these men prevaricated so much
that the case was almost immediately dismissed. The Governor feared
that if these men were sent back to Macquarie Harbour they would be
chastised and perhaps murdered by their fellow prisoners; the
consequence was that they were very rarely returned. I will give
two cases only in illustration chosen from many. A constable was
murdered at the Harbour by a prisoner named Edwards, who
acknowledged to the Superintendent the same day that he had
committed the murder, striking the constable on the head with a
stick, and afterwards pushing the body into a deep pool of water.
The pool was dragged and the body found. The murderer was sent to
Hobart Town, but on the way some fellow prisoners on the boat
persuaded him to state that the confession had been extorted from
him by the superintendent under fear of punishment. He did this at
the trial and was acquitted. In the other case a constable was
murdered by a convict, one of a party of nine, and five or six
convicts came forward as witnesses; but when the case was called on
at Hobart Town they prevaricated so much that the men would have
escaped had not the surgeon happened to be in town at the time, and
he gave evidence which led to their conviction. The men had seized
the constable and put his head into a pool of water, one of them
keeping the head under water with his foot until the man was
drowned.</p>
<p>On one occasion the principal authorities sought to serve out a
warning to the convicts of Macquarie Harbour by sending up from
Hobart Town two condemned criminals to be publicly hanged there,
thinking that the sight would act as a preventive of crime. But the
experiment failed. The convicts were drawn up round the gallows to
witness the execution, but the occurrence was turned into an awful,
horrifying farce. So buoyant were the feelings of the men who were
about to be hanged, and so little did they seem to care, that they
absolutely kicked their shoes off among the crowd, in order, as
they termed it, "that they might die game," while the men in the
crowd kept up a jocular fire of exclamations, such as "Good-bye,
Bob!" and "Good-bye, Jack!" until the fatal bolt was drawn.</p>
<p>The soldiers only on that settlement were allowed a small
modicum of spirits and tobacco, and the latter article they used to
sell to the convicts at an enormous price. On one occasion it was
reported to the commandant that a soldier had sold a small fig of
Negrohead tobacco to a convict for two dollars. The prisoners
considered tobacco the greatest luxury obtainable, and they have
frequently given a shilling for the purpose of burning out an old
wooden pipe, the inside lined with tin, probably used for smoking
many months, and which had become clogged with the oil of tobacco.
They would put a piece of ignited charcoal in the bowl of the pipe
and suck away until the oil was exhausted.</p>
<p>At Macquarie Harbour at one time all the constables&mdash;the
superintendent, the chief constable and the overseers&mdash;were
convicts, and some of them were most brutal. One of them was noted
for reporting those under his charge, and five or six men were
flogged every day for idleness, on his information. The prisoners
were completely at the mercy of these constables, and if any act of
insubordination were not reported the constable himself would
certainly be flogged upon the same being discovered.</p>
<p>The voyage from Hobart Town to Macquarie Harbour was a very
difficult and tedious one, occupying frequently a month or six
weeks. The convicts were frequently sent from Hobart Town Gaol to
Macquarie Harbour half-clothed. On this point Surgeon Barnes
says:&mdash;"Sometimes they had trousers on, but sometimes they
were without them; sometimes they had a jacket, but more frequently
they were without it, particularly if they had been long in gaol in
Hobart Town, when it would have been sold for tobacco or something
of that kind. There were 35 in the vessel in which I went to
Macquarie Harbour, a small schooner of 70 tons, and that was
divided into compartments. The middle part of the ship was the
place for prisoners. There were no beds fitted up, nor was there a
deck, but the convicts occupied the hold of the ship. If the ship
happened to be in ballast they lay on the ballast, but if it
happened to be loaded they had the luxury to lie upon a cask,
instead of upon stones. If they had a blanket it was all very well;
but I think out of the number that went down they mustered only
four blankets. I recollect on one occasion the captain ordered
their bedding to be brought on deck, to know what furniture there
was, and to whom it belonged, that it might not be purloined by the
other convicts, and on board that vessel there was one prisoner who
had neither jacket nor trousers; he had only his shirt when he was
sent out of gaol. The commanding officer gave him a bit of canvas,
which was manufactured into a pair of trousers. I have frequently
when at Macquarie Harbour seen men, 30 or 40, in that state, who
have been on board the vessel for five or six weeks, and in the
months of June, July and August, the weather was extremely cold,
particularly upon the western coast of the island."</p>
<p>In 1833 it was arranged that the Harbour should be abandoned,
owing to the difficulty of maintaining connection with the place;
and it was when this purpose was being put into execution that the
convicts seized the ship "Frederick" and escaped&mdash;a
circumstance which Marcus Clarke in his novel made to serve a very
useful purpose.</p>
<p>Writing in the "Fifties," Bonwick says;&mdash;"One who visited
Macquarie Harbour after an interval of twenty years went in
pilgrimage over the scenes, formerly so fearfully active with life.
He saw the old roofless Barracks, and walked over the prisoners'
tombs, and the deserted garden of the commandant. The stone walls
of the gaol gave forth a damp and noxious smell. The cells' floors
were strewn with bones and rubbish, and upon their pine doors were
several well-executed drawings. The very planks were studded with
initials and devices, which told of sorrows past. Thank God! the
miseries of Macquarie Harbour are over and gone. They belong to an
age of comparative barbarism in the treatment of criminals. A
better day has dawned, in which the bodily comfort of the prisoner
is regarded and the wants of his moral nature are supplied."</p>
<p>Port Arthur settlement was formed in Van Diemen's Land in
September, 1830. It was built on the edge of a large bay or harbour
which runs into the centre of Tasman's Peninsular. The place was a
second Norfolk Island, but if anything worse in its herding of
vicious, hopeless wretches, the severity of the punishment
inflicted, and the abominations practiced.</p>
<p>The convicts sent there were also those who had been twice
convicted, and the worst characters sent out from England, such as
desperate housebreakers and murderers; a class known as "gentleman
convicts" was also sent there. These gentleman convicts&mdash;men
of education&mdash;received certain privileges and if they
conducted themselves tolerably well were after a short space sent
back to Hobart Town, where they could obtain situations as clerks
or schoolmasters in private families&mdash;with what result has
been previously described in the chapters dealing with New South
Wales. To give an idea of the strange mixture on the settlement,
there were, mixed with the general class of housebreakers,
pickpockets and felons, Ikey Solomons, the famous London thief;
Collins, the old sailor, who had thrown a stone at King George; men
who had been condemned for firing haystacks; a clergyman from
Scotland; an attorney from Ireland; and a number of boys, London
pickpockets, who had been sent to learn trades from the convicts
who were mechanics. The rations served out were invariably salt,
and as a result scurvy was a common disease. The chief occupation
of the convicts was felling the large timber and sawing it up for
the use of public works in the colony, carrying it down to the
settlement, and loading ships with it. In later years the convicts
were employed in the coal mines, which caused them much
suffering.</p>
<p>The work of classification was very limited in extent. The
majority of the convicts worked in gangs, and were congregated
during meals and hours of leisure, and at sleeping times; the worst
working in irons, and the others out of irons. The punishments
inflicted for misconduct were flogging, the chain gang, and
solitary confinement, although this latter could not be effectively
carried out owing to the few cells available.</p>
<p>It was useless for the prisoners to attempt to escape, for the
only means of getting out&mdash;a narrow neck of land about 450
yards across was guarded by soldiers and dogs chained to the lamp
posts. These dogs were very fierce and were always kept fed with
raw meat to keep them savage. Like the convicts at Macquarie
Harbour, the prisoners sometimes committed outrages for the purpose
of being sent away from the settlement, and cases of reform were
remarkably rare. Those who were not brutes were made brutes, and
then were made more brutish, by the treatment they received. Port
Arthur was rather a school for eliciting and perfecting immoral
propensities and depraved habits than a reformatory; and the same
thing may be said concerning the whole of the penal settlements.
The reader will not, I am sure, require any further or fuller
illustrations of this saddening truth, although many might be
given.</p>
<p>In one of his dispatches the Governor broadly stated the design
of the establishment at Port Arthur to be "the severe punishment of
the vicious part of the community, as the means of deterring others
from the commission of crime, as well as the reformation of the
criminals themselves." And that design was faithfully carried out
in every particular, for until the penal settlement was broken up
there was one monotonous, unceasing round of strokes and sobs and
blood and tears.</p>
<p>To enter upon anything like an elaborate description of general
convict life in Van Diemen's Land would be simply to traverse
ground already covered, for it ran upon all fours with convict life
in New South Wales. In appearance and fact the second edition of
the Antipodean penal system was similar to the first, although Van
Diemen's Land was made the settling ground of many of the convicts
who were considered worse than their fellows in New South Wales. I
have confined myself, therefore, to the brief narration of the
working of the system at the penal settlements. The reader may,
however, be interested in a sketch of the second prison-colony,
drawn by a visitor in the year 1850, and I have culled from that
sketch such portions as deal with the subject I have been
treating.</p>
<p>Speaking of Hobart Town the writer (Lieut. Colonel Mundy)
says:&mdash;"In the streets the stranger sees less of the penal
features of the place than might be expected. Possibly every other
person he meets on the wharves and thoroughfares may have been
transported; for the population of the island has been thus
centesimally divided:&mdash;free immigrants and born in the colony,
46 per cent.; bond and emerged into freedom 51 per cent; military,
aborigines, &amp;c., 3 per cent. But there is of course, no outward
distinction of the classes except in the prisoners under probation,
who are clothed in the degraded grey or grey and yellow, according
to their crimes and character. And these men, being confined either
within walls or in distant stockades, or being marched early in the
morning to their place of work and back again at sunset, fall but
little under the observation of the public. Now and then may be
seen, indeed, the painful spectacle of a band of silent, soured and
scowling ruffians&mdash;some harnessed to, others pushing at, and
another driving a handcart, with clanking chains, toiling and
sweating in their thick and dusty woollens along the
streets&mdash;each marked with his number and the name of his
station in large letters on his back and on his cap. Here a gang
may be seen labouring with shovel and pick on the roadside, or
sitting apart breaking up the road metal; but there is no
earnestness or cheerfulness in this compulsory labour; and
accordingly, however active and ruthless these fellows may have
shewn themselves in the commission of violence against their
fellowmen, they are most merciful to the macadam, only throwing a
little temporary energy into their action when the appearance of a
carriage or a horseman suggests the possible advent of some person
whose duty or pleasure it may be to keep them up to their work. As
for the convict sub-overseer, who, one of themselves, is appointed
without pay to coerce the rest&mdash;no very active control can be
expected from him."</p>
<p>After referring to the earlier settlement of Van Diemen's Land
by convicts from New South Wales (1803), the writer
continues:&mdash;"Thus Van Diemen's Land is a child of Botany Bay,
born when the latter was still in her teens. The babe of grace
continued to thrive, although very nearly starved to death in its
earlier days while still at nurse under the elder
colony&mdash;kangaroo flesh being then greedily bought at 1/6 per
pound, and seaweed becoming a fashionable vegetable for want of
better food. After about three years, however, cattle and sheep
were introduced into the island in considerable numbers, and were
found to flourish exceedingly wherever the most moderate amount of
care was bestowed upon them. The ports being closed against any but
king's ships, the colony received but few recruits except by
successive drafts of doubly-distilled rogues from New South Wales.
After a few years, however, the interdict against commerce was
removed; many military officers serving there settled down on
grants of land; a considerable band of emigrants was brought by the
Government from Norfolk Island, when that place was selected for a
penal settlement; freed prisoners increased and multiplied, and
spread themselves over the interior; but no direct emigration from
the British Isles occurred before 1821, when a census being taken,
the white population was found to amount to 7000 souls. In 1824 a
supreme court of judicature was established from Home&mdash;Judges
having hitherto been sent from Sydney to hold occasional sessions
at Hobart Town. In the same year having obtained her majority, she
petitioned for release from the filial ties connecting her with
Sydney; and in 1825 she was by imperial fiat erected into an
independent colony. The progress of the island has been
surprisingly rapid; although, like New South Wales, its prosperity
as a colony has been chequered by occasional reverses.. .. .. Money
must have been plentiful in 1835, when a piece of land at Hobart
Town was sold for &pound;3,600 per acre.... In the census of 1847 the
population had reached a total of 70,164. Among the actual
convict-class the disparity between the sexes was very great as
shewn by the following official returns:&mdash;'Of the
ticket-of-leave holders the males are five to one; of the prisoners
in Government employ eight to one; and of pass-holders in service
also eight to one. In other words, the males are 29&frac12; per cent, and
the females only 5 per cent.; making a difference between the sexes
of 24&frac12; per cent, in this class of the population. On the 31st
December, 1858, the convict population was 25,459, of whom 40 per
cent. held tickets-of-leave, 48 per cent, were pass-holders, and 12
per cent were under probation of sentence.'. .. Tasmania is a more
musical <i>alias</i> adopted by the island. It has been given in
titular distinction to the first bishop."</p>
<p>During his visit Mundy was accompanied by an officer whose duty
it was to make periodical inspections of the several hospitals,
probation stations, and the female convict factory at the Cascades,
and he thus describes some of the sights that opened before
him:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The Cascades factory is seated at the foot of Mount Wellington,
wedged in a gully between hills. The buildings are enclosed within
a high wall, with barred gates and vigilant turnkeys; it is, in
short, a gaol in every respect, according to the respective deserts
of its inmates. We were received at the entrance by the matron, a
dignified lady who looked quite capable of maintaining strict
discipline whether in a public or in a merely domestic
establishment. From her hands we received in due military form 'the
morning state' of her garrison&mdash;which, as it appeared,
amounted to 730 women and 130 infants. In turn we visited the
several courts, solitary cells, the hospital, refectories,
dormitories, and lavatories. In one yard was formed up for our
inspection in hollow square, seventy or eighty women&mdash;open to
be hired as servants. These, as we were informed, were the better
conducted, and the pregnant women. In another court were a strong
division of more troublesome and notorious characters, who were
under restraint, and not permitted to go into service. The uniform,
a very unbecoming one to the person, however becoming to the
station of the wearer, is a white mob cap and a dress of grey
duffle. As we passed down the ranks the poor creatures saluted us
with a running fire of curtseys, and a dead silence was everywhere
observed. In a large exercise yard, with an open shed in the centre
affording shelter from the sun, we found some sixty women with as
many babies from two years to two days old&mdash;women and children
were all silent! One would have thought them all deaf and
dumb;&mdash;never was I before in so numerous a nursery&mdash;I
hope I never may again! The children were mostly healthy and
pretty. As for their mothers&mdash;there must, I suppose be a good
deal in dress as an element of beauty, for I scarcely saw a
tolerably pretty woman in seven hundred. Some of the females, I
found, were the hired nurses of the establishment&mdash;not the
mothers of the children. Of these latter many, it appears, merely
enter the factory to deposit their 'kid-forlorn,' and, when
sufficiently recovered, return to service in the town or country in
the district to which their ticket or pass extends, and not a few
re-enter its walls as soon as it is possible for them to require
again obstetric assistance. It is nothing to say that many of these
poor brats will never know their own fathers;&mdash;their mothers,
perhaps, know them no better; and many of the wretched little ones,
in the hands of the nurses, will never know either parent. The
public consoles itself with the dry fact that they will all come
into the labour market. A large ward was allotted to the midday
sleep of the poor little babes. It was rather a pretty sight for a
father (of none of them) to contemplate. There were a score or so
of wooden cribs, in each or which lay two, three, or four
innocents, stowed away head and tail, like <i>sardines a
l'huile;</i> while others were curling about like a litter of
kittens in a basket of straw. All were wonderfully
good&mdash;chiefly, I suspect, because there was no anxious mamma
nor fussy nurse constantly soliciting them to do so.</p>
<p>"The visiting-surgeon of the establishment, whom I accompanied,
had found it necessary to prescribe half rations and gentle medical
treatment to a certain turbulent few of the prisoners; and as it
was whispered to him that his fair but fierce patients meditated a
remonstrance when it came to their turn to be visited; and as there
was little doubt this appeal would have taken a Billingsgate form,
the prudent medico postponed hearing it, which, I confess, was to
me a great relief. This was on his part a merciful as well as a
discreet step, because the half-rations of the insurgents would
assuredly have been further reduced to bread and water discussed in
silence and solitude&mdash;a thing no woman loveth. Forty-eight
hours of this kind of single-blessedness, with the above meagre
diet and a prescription slightly productive of nausea, occasions,
it is said, a prodigiously soothing effect upon ladies afflicted
with gross health and fiery temperaments. Going along the avenues
of solitary cells, there was a great unlocking of massive doors,
and a questioning of 'Have you any complaints?' I only looked into
two or three. One woman was carding, another combing wool. A third
cell, on being opened, I found to be completely darkened;&mdash;it
seemed empty, so I passed within the door to examine its
construction. It looked like the den of a wolf, and I almost
started back when from the extreme end of the floor I found a pair
of bright, flashing eyes fixed on mine. Their owner arose and took
a step or two forward; it was a small, slight, and quite young
girl&mdash;very beautiful in feature and complexion&mdash;but it
was the fierce beauty of the wild cat! I am a steady married man,
of a certain age&mdash;but at no period of my life would I, for a
trifle, have shared for half an hour the cell of that sleek little
savage; for when she purred loudest I should have been most afraid
of her claws! As the heavy door slammed in her face, and the strong
bolts shot into the grooves, the turnkey informed me that this was
one of the most refractory and unmanageable characters in the
prison.. ... I had no more stomach for solitary cells that day.</p>
<p>"One of the great yards of the factory was devoted to laundress
work. Squads of women were up to their shoulders in
suds&mdash;carrying on the cruel process of wringing&mdash;or
displaying their thick ankles as they spread the linen over the
drying lines. The townsfolk may have their washing done here at 1/6
per dozen, the money going towards the expenses of the institution.
I was pained to see so many very youthful creatures in this
yard&mdash;delinquents in their earliest teens; debauched 'ere the
pith had hardened in their little bones. We had a glimpse of a room
full of seamstresses, most of them employed on fine work. It was
not impossible, the matron said, that some of the elaborate
shirt-fronts we should see at the Government House ball this
evening had been worked in this, and washed and 'got up' in the
last ward. A rougher fabric, done by the less-skilled prisoners, is
a coarse kind of woollen tweed, only used for prison-dresses ... ..
The cleanliness of the prison was almost dazzling, and the order
and discipline appeared faultless."</p>
<p>There were other factories besides that described by Mundy, and
a newspaper report on 10th January, 1851, gave the following
statement of the number of female pass-holders awaiting
hire:&mdash;Hobart Town Brickfields Depot, 276; Cascades Factory,
176; New Town Farm, 71; Launceston, Factory, 38; Ross Hiring Depot,
49.&mdash;Total 610.</p>
<p>Mundy gives a graphic description of the country through which
he passed on his way to Eagle Hawk Neck. "This post," says he, "by
reason of its somewhat unique feature&mdash;a line of canine
sentries&mdash;is one of the lions of Van Diemen's Land. On either
shore of the inlet running up to the station there is a chain of
huts, each containing a constable and his dog, to prevent the
escape of runaways by swimming this arm of the sea&mdash;a
desperate measure, since the fugitive fortunate enough to evade the
tipstaff and the mastiff would have to battle the watch with an
outlying picquet of sharks abounding in these waters. It was
related to me that, on one occasion, four prisoners, good swimmers,
led by a notorious black named Jacky, attempted to cross from a
headland called Sympathy Point to Woody Island, and thence to
Forester's Peninsular. The Englishmen&mdash;perhaps because their
fair skin acted as whitebait for the sharks&mdash;were one and all
seized and devoured by these tigers of the deep; the native made
good his landing, but was afterwards retaken. No sooner came we in
sight of the low, sandy, scrub-grown isthmus which cuts across the
head of the inlet, than our ears were saluted by the bay of the
deep-mouthed dogs, and as we walked up the pier towards the guard
room at the end of it, they all joined in a grand chorus, including
three or four videttes stationed on little platforms laid on piles
in the water. Two armed sentries are posted on the narrowest part
of the neck, the one on the ocean side of it&mdash;in Pirate's
Cove&mdash;the other on the inlet side of it. The dogs, each
chained to a post, with a barrel for a kennel, and a lamp to
illuminate his night watch, connect their two biped
fellow-sentinels, and complete the cordon. The dogs were generally
of a large rough breed, mongrels of the most promiscuous
derivation, but powerful and ferocious. One of the family, who was
permitted to roam at large, amused himself sometimes, and kept his
teeth and temper in practice by running into the shallow and
fighting with the sharks: and he not unfrequently succeeded in
dragging them ashore. There are fourteen dogs 'on the chain' at
present.</p>
<p>"Passing Woody Island and Sympathy Point&mdash;the scene of the
fatal swim before mentioned&mdash;we came to an anchorage for the
night just after dusk, off a small station-nameless as far as I
know&mdash;at the head of Norfolk Bay, where, there being no
accommodation, we slept on board. A commissary officer, who resides
here in all the solitude permitted him by a wife and six children,
came off and kindly undertook to arrange for our passage to Port
Arthur in the morning, by railway. 'By railway!' exclaims the
reader, 'a railway at the Antipodes?' Yes, by railway&mdash;not
propelled by steam power, however, but by human thews and sinews,
and in the sweat of the human brow! At 7 p.m. we landed on a rough
pier of timber, upon which the rail, or rather the wooden tram-way,
abuts; and in the middle of the dreary little settlement, which
consists of the commissary's quarters and a few huts, we found a
couple of low trucks on four wheels with two benches in each, and,
standing near these not elegant vehicles, eight convicts dressed in
the grey and yellow garb; another, in grey unvariegated, being in
attendance as head man of the gang. These were to be our teams.
Dividing ourselves into two parties, Dr. and
Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and I, got into one, and two tolerably
weighty gentlemen into the other. Upon this, the prisoners seized
certain bars crossing the front and back of the carriages, and
after pushing them with great toil up a considerable plane, reached
the top of a long descent, where, getting up steam, they rattled
down at a tremendous speed&mdash;tremendous, indeed, to lady-like
nerves&mdash;the chains round their ankles clinking and clanking as
they trotted along; and as soon as the carriages in their headlong
race down the hill exceeded the possible speed of that slowest of
all animals, man, at a word from their leader the runners, jumped
upon the sides of the trucks in rather unpleasant proximity with
the passengers, and away we all went, bondsmen and freemen, jolting
and swaying in a manner that smacked somewhat too much of 'the
d&mdash;-l take the hindmost'&mdash;although a man sitting behind
contrived, more and less, to lock a wheel with a wooden crow-bar
when the descent became so rapid as to call for remonstrance.
Accidents have not unfrequently occurred when travellers by this
rail have encouraged, or not forbidden, the men to abandon the
trucks to their own momentum down the hills; for there are several
sharpish turns in the line, and the tramway is of the roughest
construction. Occasionally, perhaps, these capsizes have not been
purely accidental when travellers obnoxious to the motive powers
have fallen into their hands. One of the highest public officers of
the colony met, as I was told, with a tremendous upset on this
railway. Rolling, without much damage, into the ditch, he was
picked up, <i>'teres atque rotundus,'</i> by the 'canary birds,'
who placed him upon his legs, and amid a thousand expressions of
contrition set to work to brush the dirt off his clothes, and so
officious were they, that, on his first reference to his pockets
neither watch nor purse were to be found!</p>
<p>"Half-way we halted at a police-station&mdash;not to take in
water for the engines, but to grease the wheels and breathe the
men&mdash;and then proceeded with renewed vigour. The distance from
our starting point in Norfolk Bay to Long Bay, an arm of Port
Arthur, by the railway, may be five or six miles. It is sometimes
performed in half-an-hour; but to-day having a nervous passenger,
the men did not put forth their best speed. The tramway, alongside
of which there is a bridle-road, lays through a forest-tract of the
most splendid timber wholly wild and uncleared, the largest trees
being the blue gum for which the island is famous. Our mode of
travelling through this fine forest was not precisely such as to
add to our enjoyment of the scene&mdash;indeed, it jarred most
distressingly on my feelings; for our poor beasts of burden at the
end of the traject seemed terribly jaded, and I saw one of them
continually trying to shift the irons from a galled spot on his
ankle. Returning by this same route in the afternoon, we were
requested by the head man to halt a few minutes for the men to get
something to eat. The overseer told us that these men had
breakfasted at four in the morning at Norfolk Bay, had run up the
trucks with half a ton of rations to Long Bay, and had returned to
Norfolk Bay for our party by half past six.. .. .. The men employed
on this tramway, which is more used for the transport of stores and
provisions than of passengers, are under sentence of hard labour,
and those who are young and active enough to go the pace prefer it
to other task-work&mdash;chiefly, I suspect, because many
passengers, in flagrant breach of the convict rules, bestow some
small reward on the wretched drags-men, whereby they are enable to
procure tobacco&mdash;the grand desideratum of all prisoners, and
other trifling luxuries the value of which a man never fully knows
until they are unattainable.</p>
<p>"The penal township of Port Arthur is the headquarters, both
military and convict, of the peninsular. There are at present about
350 prisoners, and the garrison consists of a captain and seventy
grenadiers of the 99th. I had made up my mind to find in Port
Arthur all the gloomy attributes of a huge donjon. I expected, and
I believe wished, to see the features of nature and the
institutions of man frowning in grim and dreary concert on the spot
expressly selected for the punishment of Britain's blackest
malefactors&mdash;one half of whom, perhaps, ere the criminal law
of England was amended (or diluted) would have paid the penalty of
their misdeeds on the scaffold. There is, however, in fact, nothing
of the Bastile in the aspect of the town of Port
Arthur&mdash;nothing of the desert waste where the felons of other
nations are condemned to linger out their hopeless lives. We saw
the cooking and baking for the prisoners: and better bread and meat
and more savoury broth were never served up at an English yeoman's
table; half as good never to that of the English labourer on
Sunday, nor to the Irish cotter twice a year. We walked through the
prisoners' refectory at their dinner-hour. They were sitting
quietly at their tables, while one of each dozen divided the food
into shares. I was told&mdash;-whether in joke or an earnest way he
doubted&mdash;that, if I waited until the meal was over, I should
see a waiter going round with pipes and tobacco for such of the
guests who desired a whiff of Virginia.. .. .. We next visited an
admirable edifice nearly finished at vast expense for the
prosecution of the silent and solitary system. There are long
galleries of 'separate apartments,' as they are delicately termed;
courtyards where the prisoners are brought out one by one to take
their exercise under the eye of a constable; and a chapel so fitted
up that each man will&mdash;like a prebend or a horse, have a stall
to himself, and so constructed that he can see no one but the
parsons and the constables. The prisoners not in solitary
confinement are marched to church, and have large pews or rather
pens for their accommodation.. .. .. . The present or probation
scheme has for its main features the blending correction with
instruction moral and religious, a careful classification of the
prisoners, rigorously enforced hard labour, and solitary
confinement under unblinking surveillance, for the hardened and
refractory; with the lash, Norfolk Island and the gibbet for the
utterly irreclaimable. On the other hand, milder treatment for
mitigated criminals, and for the well-conducted the certain
prospect of the pass, the ticket, and the still larger boon of
conditional pardon, after periods of servitude graduated according
to the sentences and conduct under sentence. According to the
present scheme the prisoner at no period is compelled to work
without payment, except while his own bad conduct past or present
restricts him to the government establishments. On the first
relaxation of his bonds he comes into the labour-market on pretty
nearly equal terms with the free laborer.</p>
<p>"Getting coal (at the mines) is considered the most irksome and
arduous branch of convict labour. The station here, like most
others in Van Diemen's Land, was, until lately, kept in subjection
by a military guard. A married officer was in command for some
time, and such was the character of the <i>populus vivovum</i>
around him, that the females of his family could not move out
without an escort of armed men. Pan-Demons' Land would be almost
too mild a name for a region where such a state of things
existed!"</p>
<p>Speaking of the Male Penitentiary, which he visited one Sunday
afternoon, Mundy says:&mdash;"The edifice is built of solid stone,
with a formidable wall surrounding it, and is situated within the
city. My friend and myself were most civilly received by the
governor of the gaol, who straightway conducted us to the
mess-room, where the prisoners were attending an evening lecture by
the catechist of the prison. This officer, standing in a high
reading-desk, and selecting a subject from Scripture (the life of
our Saviour was that under present consideration) mingled his
discourse with questions addressed generally to his hearers; nor
did he fail to meet a prompt and intelligent reply, sometimes from
two or more respondents. All were quiet and apparently attentive,
but the answers came from but few. A hymn was sung also in good
time and tune, but the performers were, likewise, a select few. The
worst class of men, in their piebald dress, were separated from
those in pepper-and-salt, (who are for hire by private
individuals), and these again were separated from a more juvenile
class, the Parkhurst lads. There are usually from 700 to 1000 men
in this prison. A fine range of solitary cells has just been
erected. The greatest care is observed in the classification of the
offenders, in order to prevent the contamination of the bad by the
worse. The labour, too, is apportioned by a scale elaborately kept,
whereby the age, physical powers, and health of each person as
computed by the medical attendant, are taken into account. At the
conclusion of the lecture the prisoners marched through a line of
constables to their sleeping-rooms which are built to accommodate
about 30 men, in two tiers of berths&mdash;a better arrangement
than the old dormitories of 300 or 400 persons, but still I think
not sufficiently divided. There are lamps burning all night in each
room, and a watchman with list slippers, having charge of a certain
set of rooms, creeps about the landing places, maintaining order
and decency under heavy penalties. The wretched gaol birds had all
gone to roost in their respective nests when I looked into some of
the rooms. Under former and more lax systems, I was informed, the
short period between turning in and falling asleep was employed,
and perhaps lengthened, by the most villainous, disgusting, and
blasphemous conversation. No dormitory of nuns&mdash;placid
votaries of celibacy and religion&mdash;could have been more silent
and tranquil than the night-cells of these branded outcasts; and
how is this managed? I really hardly knew whether to burst into a
fit of laughter, or to view with admiration and approval the scene
which was enacting in each sleeping-room. A large tin oil lamp
supplied the chamber with light; and seated on the top of the
ladder under the lamp was a man, one of the prisoners, book in
hand, reading aloud&mdash;reading, in short, those very luxurious
rogues, whose heads on their pillows were turned towards the
lector, to sleep! The prison-readers are of course selected from
among the best educated men; the lecture continues from eight to
nine o'clock, and is credited to the performers as so much hard
labour; on Sundays serious books are allotted for these noctural
lectures; on weekdays subjects of general information and amusement
afford a lighter lullaby, probably less rapid in its operation.
During the hour or two I passed in this penitentiary, such was the
perfect order and silence observed, that I did not hear a word
spoken except by the officers and attendants. It may fairly be
styled a model prison."</p>
<p>In the few extracts I have given from Mundy's "Antipodes," some
light is thrown upon the social life of the metropolis of Van
Diemen's Land. A great deal has been written of life on the island,
and exhaustive description thereof here would doubtless be
considered out of place; but I may be pardoned for making some
reference to the habits and customs of those who represented
respectability and were not responsible to gaolers for every word
spoken and every deed done. For twenty years after the sailing of
the first fleet to form the settlement, the place was almost
destitute of any of those agencies which "make for righteousness,"
and if there were any teachers of morality in the land their voices
were not heard. The Rev. Robert Knopwood was the first chaplain,
but he does not appear to have devoted much time to ministerial
functions. One not unfriendly writer, speaking from personal
knowledge, thus refers to him and his work:&mdash;"As he never
married, his exuberant spirits, his partiality for lively company,
his reputation for jollity, and his preference for ladies' society,
exposed him, in those days of lax morality, to some free, but not
ill-natured criticism. No one accused him of a want of benevolence,
and all commended his gentlemanly demeanour. He was fond of his
pipe; and for a number of years he was accustomed to dine at the
hotel, with his bachelor friends, after church on Sunday. When much
displeased he might employ the language of the period. Though a
clergyman he despised hypocrisy, and his reputed saying was 'Do as
I say, not as I do.' His manner of reading the higher numbers of
the Commandments furnished a joke for the profane. He was decidedly
popular, as Charles the Second was, with the lower classes. As a
magistrate he was not harsh in judgment nor cruel in sentence. To
one who complained, however, of the injustice of some penalty, he
is reported to have mildly said 'Never mind; take your dozen; it
will do for another time.'"</p>
<p>Mr. Knopwood resigned his incumbency in 1823, and retired with a
pension from the colonial fund, his place being filled by Mr.
Bedford, who had been an active worker in the London prisons, and
who reached his sphere of labours at a time when drunkenness and
licentiousness in high places were so vigorous as to threaten the
complete disorganization of society, more than one of the Governors
of Van Diemen's Land having encouraged viciousness by themselves to
a great extent indulging therein. Here is what the writer from whom
I have already quoted says on this subject:&mdash;"That which
peremptorily called for the reprobation of authority, but which was
sanctioned by the usage of the highest officials, was the vice of
lasciviousness. Thanks to the despotism of penal discipline, there
was little hindrance to the freedom of sin. The males were greatly
in excess of the females. Both parties were, of course, with very
few exceptions, of the prisoner class; and neither sex was
characterized by refinement, honour, or virtue. The women were
certainly abandoned enough without the degrading associations of
their present existence, and the threats as well as allurements
which precipitated their further decline. The consequence of all
this was the practice of concubinage, and an illicit intercourse
approaching the promiscuous. The feelings of the newly-arrived
chaplain may well be conceived. He wept, he raged, he prayed.
Instances are on record of good men being so dismayed at the scenes
of vice before them, that they were constrained to retire before
it. The pastor of Hobart Town was made of sterner stuff.
Indignation got the better of his sympathy. His righteous
excitement was kindled, not against the poor outcast prisoner, but
against the authorities in office. These were seen to live
shamelessly in sin. Against these he thundered with a Knox-like
zeal in the church which they were forced in etiquette to attend.
He denounced their guilt in the language of the old seers, and
uttered warnings and judgments with the energy of an Elijah. He
rested not here. To purify the land, he appealed to the executive.
If a change of heart could not be secured, at least the outward
shame of sin might be removed. It would be idle for him to enforce
the Seventh command upon the convicts, when they saw its open
violation by their superiors. He found an able seconder of his
schemes of reformation in Governor Arthur, then recently appointed.
A Government order was issued, Commanding all officers, on pain of
dismissal from public Service, to amend their lives, and to be
united in matrimony with those with whom they had been publicly
living in shame, and by whom, in many cases, they had a family.
This struck terror into the community of officials. They wished to
retain their position, but not to be fettered by the marriage tie.
They conjured and they blustered; they presented memorials, and
they condemned the tyranny, but all in vain; the law was intended
for obedience. Then the malcontents turned upon the real author of
this invasion of the rights of their domestic institutions. They
sought to cajole him in private; they insulted him in public. They
appealed to his generosity at one time, to his fears at another.
Prayers, bribes, and threats were all in vain. The <i>Fighting
Chaplain</i> was not to be driven from his entrenchments, nor
seduced from his duty. Gradually and sulkily the discomfited chiefs
gave in. Their mistresses were made wives, and their children were
legitimated in the eyes of the law. Then, and not till then, did
the champion of virtue attack those of lesser name, and bring his
influence to bear upon their conduct." The writer closes his
reference to this good man's work by saying that the lovers of
colonial virtue will never cease to recognise with gratitude the
labours of the Rev. Dr. Bedford, the venerable chaplain of Hobart
Town.</p>
<p>Concerning the prevalence of drunkenness in Hobart Town many
testimonies are given. It is said that at one sitting in a tavern
six emancipists drank seven bottles of sherry and forty-one bottles
of porter; that two women, "Fat Katherine" and "Carrotty Kit"
undertook in a drunken frolic to swim the river Derwent for a wager
of rum; that the public executioner drank himself to death in 1818;
that one of the first Governors was styled, for his drunken habits,
"Mad Davey;" that the whole colony for weeks under one of the early
Governors was drunk together. The editor of one of the early papers
declared, "One half of those that die in the colony at the present
time&mdash;perish directly or indirectly through drink." Women sold
grog for the officers, following the example set in Sydney, and
instead of money the constables received rum for their services, an
allowance being served out every quarter at the rate of a quart for
each week, subsequently reduced to a pint per week, as it was found
that the constables became grog-sellers and thus interfered with
legitimate trade. One early resident has placed the following
pregnant sentence on record:&mdash;"I remember when I arrived here
first, the public houses were filled with convicts, night and day,
tippling, gambling and concocting robberies. It was often dangerous
to walk the streets in day-time."</p>
<p>From some unaccountable official neglect, until Governor
Sorell's time, no secure night asylum was provided for the convicts
in Government employ, and they were thus at liberty to prey upon
the well-disposed after working hours. It is on record that the
night after one of the leading merchants of Hobart Town had been
buried the silver plate was stolen from the coffin. Tradesmen were
in the habit of keeping loaded firearms at hand while serving in
their shops, fearing robbery even in the daytime; and so low was
the state of public morals that the Inspector of Public Works spoke
of the existing depravity as being fearful, "unparalleled in any
age." This was in 1822, and an English clergyman described the
island as "that den of thieves, that cave of robbers, that cage of
unclean birds, that isthmus between earth and hell!" In the earlier
days the authorities literally "strained at a gnat and swallowed a
camel," for while they themselves lived abominably corrupt lives
they issued most stringent orders concerning the sanctity of the
Sabbath, prohibiting all movement in the town during the hours of
Divine service; making carriers and drovers unyoke their bullocks,
bakers put out their fires, butchers stop killing, and milkmen
cease their perambulations and cries&mdash;all the practices
forbidden being described as "profanations of the Lord's Day,
vulgarly and improperly called Sabbath-breaking." Read apart from
other records these public orders would lead persons to think the
Van Demonians were a godly people, yet at the very time these
Government orders were promulgated and being enforced, grog was
sold openly by prostitutes for the benefit of the officers,
scarcely a single official attended public worship, and not one in
ten of the law administrators was living with his own wife.</p>
<p>Sales of wives, both public and private, we are told, were
common. One woman was sold for fifty sheep, another for &pound;5 and a
gallon of rum, and another for twenty sheep and a gallon of rum;
yet while these thing were allowed, no couple could be joined in
"holy wedlock" without first obtaining a Government stamped order.
The female convicts at one time were common property. As in the
case of the male convicts, the females had no place of night
shelter provided for them upon their arrival, although rations of
food were provided, and they had to find shelter where and how they
best could. Bonwick, whose voluminous and reliable sketches of life
in Van Diemen's Land are most valuable as records of the early
days, referring to the state of morals existing at the time of
which I am writing, says:&mdash;"That which was so fertile a source
of vice was the numerical disproportion of the sexes. Very few
women came out as prisoners in the early times. After a time some
good people in England sought to rectify the evil by the shipment
of free but destitute, young women. The selection could not have
been happy. A dozen, sent out by a religious society, were
christened by the sailors 'The Twelve Apostles;' and Dr. Cunningham
informs us of 'a goodly proportion of that chosen band being found
in a matronly way by the reverend inspector, who visited them on
arrival.' One of the female immigrants wrote thus to a friend in
England: 'Out of two hundred and sixty-eight that came out with me,
I verily believe that there were not more than twenty who have any
claim to a good name, being driven to the most wretched and
loathsome debauchery.' When the Government continued to pour
convicts upon the devoted island, in spite of the protestations of
the free and emancipated inhabitants, who wished for some more
moral atmosphere for their children, the social evils increased and
the hope of the colonists declined. Petitions were presented, in
1835, against this terrible' scourge. The Anti-Transportation
League was subsequently organized; and an active opposition was
presented to the impolitic, unchristian, and inhuman acts of the
British Government. Petitions to Parliament, and memorials from
Tasmanian mothers to the Queen were alike disregarded; the fairest
of isles was to be, apparently, doomed as the dust-hole of Britain
for ever. Nothing but the inexorable logic of events in the
Australian gold discovery stayed the hand of the moral destroyer of
Tasmania.. ..The disproportion of sexes varied in years, and
greatly differed according to condition and locality. Thus we find
that, in 1834, the relation of males to females in Hobart Town and
Launceston was as 7 to 5 among the free and 3 5/8 to 1 among the
bond. But in the sparsely populated agricultural districts, where
male labour only was required, the proportion was remarkably
different, being as 5 to 3 with the free, and 17 to 1 with the
bond. In the whole island, of 40,283 persons, 11,482 were females.
One sad consequence of this disproportion was the exposure of women
to unwonted temptation and to atrocious violence. Free women, and
girls of colonial families, were often severely tried, and their
moral sense was blunted by the tone of society. When female
emigrants were shipped off from England by the philanthropic
efforts of Mrs. Fry and her friends, in the hope of correcting the
evils of the island, and finding homes for destitute and
ill-supported girls, the only immediate perceptible effect was a
vast increase of prostitution in the streets of Hobart Town. But
the darkest shade has yet to be revealed. It would not be honest in
the historian to be silent about one evil that pre-eminently cursed
the penal settlements of Australia and Van Diemen's Land, and
resulting less from the paucity of females than the brutal
sensuality of men of crime, herded in masses together, still
further to corrupt each other. By no means unfrequent in the older
colonial days the vice of the sunken cities of the plains prevailed
more under the congregated Probation System than in the times of
the general assignment of convicts."</p>
<p>It must be as pleasing to the reader unacquainted with the
island, as the knowledge that the statement is absolutely true is
gratifying to the colonists, to know that in 1870 Bonwick could
write: "Yet Tasmania has now a larger proportion of church-going
people than England, a much larger number of Sabbath school
attendants, and a degree of active benevolence, social prosperity
and even moral development, that surprises even thoughtful
colonists themselves."</p>
<p>As in the case of New South Wales, the scars of the old convict
sore have entirely disappeared, and vigorous national life in its
very best phases now flourishes on the soil once cursed by
criminality of the darkest hue.</p>

"CHAPTER_XVIII_A_HORRIBLE_STORY">CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;A HORRIBLE
STORY.</a></h2>
<p>THE following confession of the convict Pierce, murderer and
cannibal of Van Diemen's Land, is taken from papers which were laid
before the Committee of the House of Commons in 1838:&mdash;</p>
<p>Alexandra Pierce, Deponent:</p>
<p>"Sayeth, that he was working with a gang at Kelly's Basin, with
overseer Logans. Deponent, Bob Greenhill, Mathew Travers, Thomas
Bodenham, James Brown, Bill Cornelius alias Kennedy, John Mathers,
and Alexander Dalton made it up for to take a boat and proceed
(from Macquarie Harbour) to Hobart Town; Greenhill being at the
mines we had to call for him, he being a good navigator. As soon as
he saw the boat he put on his jacket to know what we were up to;
six of us went ashore and one stopped in the boat; Greenhill took
hold of an axe and went to the hut, and broke open the miners'
chest and took all their provisions. We then took two buckets of
water to put the fire out so that they should not make a signal; we
then thought we had all the fire extinguished, but when we had got
about a quarter of a mile distant we found we had not put it
completely out, for we saw the miners making fires all along the
beach; we then considered that there would be a boat despatched
after us, which prevented us going by water; we proceeded on a
little further and drew up the boat; we then consulted what was
best to do with the boat; Mathews Travers and Greenhill said it was
best to break her up, as we had two good axes, which we did. This
prevented us from going to Mr. Lucas and taking all his provisions,
as he was going up to the settlement that day with oil from a whale
he had killed. This we had in contemplation sometime before.
Everyone took a little something, either provisions or an axe; we
then proceeded on that, it being fine, to the side of the large
mountain, right opposite the settlement; we were afraid that Dr.
Spencer or the Commandant would see us with the spy glass, the
settlement appeared so very plain to us, so we agreed to lie down
till the sun would get a little round that we might not be seen; we
advanced up to the top and kindled a fire, where we stopped all
night. The next morning, as soon as day appeared, we started and
travelled on to dark night. The next morning we rose early and
travelled towards the east; we kept off Gordon River for fear the
soldiers would be after us; we travelled through a very rough part
of the country to dark night. We came to the side of a large hill,
where we kindled a fire, and there remained until morning; we then
proceeded on through a very rough country for eight days, till we
came to the side of a large mountain; we then kindled a fire; we
were in a very weak state for provision, as we had been out for two
days before our arrival here. Little Brown, who came back and died
in the hospital, was the worst walker of any; he always fell behind
and then kept cooeying, so that we said we would leave him behind
if he did not keep up better; we kindled the fires this night above
all nights; as we were all very weak and were disputing who would
get wood, so everyone got some for themselves and made their fire.
Bill Cornelius made some tinder this night and left it by, as he
had some intention to turn back; three days before the other tinder
got wet; we were very cold and hungry. Bill Cornelius says "I am so
weak that I could eat a piece of a man." The morning after this
there were four of us for a feast. Bob Greenhill was the first who
introduced it, and said that he had seen the like done before and
that it eat much like a little pork. Mathers spoke out and said it
would be a murder to do it, and then perhaps they could not eat it.
"I will warrant you," said Greenhill, "I will well do it first
myself, and eat the first of it; but you must all lend a hand, so
that you may be equal in the crime." We then consulted who should
fall. Greenhill said "Dalton, as he volunteered to be flogger, we
will kill him." Dalton, Brown and Cornelius had a few bushes and
made a little break-wind. About three o'clock in the morning Dalton
was asleep; then Greenhill ran and took an axe and struck him on
the head, and he never spoke a word after; he
called&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. Mathew Travers with a knife also came
and cut his throat, and bled him; we then dragged him to a
distance, and cut off his clothes, and tore out his inside and cut
off his head; then Mathew Travers and Greenhill put his heart and
liver on the fire, and eat it before it was right warm; they asked
the rest would they have any, but they would not eat any that
night; the next morning it was cut up and divided, and each one got
an equal share. We then got on our way a little after sunrise;
there was a man appointed each day to go in front; this man had to
carry nothing, but was only to make the road. Bill Cornelius and
Brown said they would carry the tin pots and a little tomahawk; we
had not gone more than a quarter of a mile from the fires when
Brown and Cornelius were missing, we turned round and looked, but
could not see any signs of them; we then said amongst ourselves
that they had turned back, as they had seen the Gordon River, and
that they would hang us all; we returned back and stopped for a
quarter of an hour, but could not see any signs of them; we then
thought it was no use to go any further in pursuit of them, as we
thought they could not make their way back. We then proceeded on
for four days through a bad country till we came to a large river
which we thought to be Gordon River; we stopped there one day and
two nights looking for a place to cross; we fell two trees, but the
stream was so rapid it swept them away instantly; we then came to a
place where there was a rock extending from the opposite side to
about the middle of the water; there were two of us could not swim,
Mathew Travers and Bodenham; three of us swam over and cut a long
pole, 30 or 40 feet long, and got on the rock and reached over and
dragged the other two over by this means; we then kindled a fire on
the opposite side and stopped there all night; John Mathers took a
purging and begged that we would remain a little longer; so we did
stop another night; we then got up the hill on the opposite side
with great difficulty, it being so steep; it was barren ground for
miles on the other side of this hill. John Mathers had the tinder
in his breast, and by some means it dropped down into his trousers,
and Mathew Travers ran and lifted up the axe and said he would kill
him if he did not give it to him immediately; we then lay this
night in the cleft of a rock and the next morning were scarcely
able to move, for we were so cold and wet. We then proceeded on for
four days through barren and very scrubby ground, we then came to a
very nice plain and agreed to stop there all night; we were all in
a most weak state. Mathews Travers, Greenhill and Mathers went to
aside and consulted who should be killed next. Bodenham did not
know anything about it; then Travers, Mathers and Greenhill came
down to the fire and bade me and Mathers go and get some wood,
while Bodenham would wake easy; Travers says "You will hear it
immediately;" so, in about two minutes I heard a blow given, and
Mathers said "He is done, Greenhill hit him with the axe and
Travers cut his throat." They laid him out and Bob Greenhill took
his shoes and put them on himself, as his own was bad. The heart
and liver was all that was made use of that night. We then thought
we would take a day's rest as we had provisions, so we stopped
another day in the plains; we then dried the dead body and
proceeded on our way, through a marshy ground, for three days,
bearing to our right. We then crossed the first western tier; we
could see a great distance from off the top of the mountain. On the
opposite side there was marshy ground, with a large river in the
middle, and there was very fine trees growing on the banks. We then
stopped at the river for one night, we then went up the river side,
bearing more to the left for three days, and we saw many kangaroos
and emus, and game of all kinds; then our provisions were all out.
We then said to ourselves that we would all die together before
anything else should happen. John Mathers and deponent went to one
side, and Mathers said, "Pierce, let us go by ourselves; you see
what kind of a cove Greenhill is; he would kill his father before
he would fast one day." We then went on for two or three days after
this, through a very fine country, and you could see 70 miles
without any bush. We then took and boiled some of Bodenham; Mathers
boiled the first and it made him so sick that he began to vomit;
Greenhill started up and took the axe and hit him on the forehead;
he shouted "Murder! Pierce, will you see me killed?" He cut him,
but being stronger than Greenhill he took the axe and threw it to
me to keep. We then went on a little further, to another little
creek of fresh water, where we took up our lodgings that night, I
went to a little distance, and, looking round, I saw Travers and
Greenhill collaring him, and they told him they would give him half
an hour to pray for himself, which was agreed to; he then gave the
Prayer-book to me and laid down his head, and Greenhill took up the
axe and killed him. We then stopped two days in this place; we then
proceeded on our journey, each man getting an equal share; we then
got forward to the second tier of mountains where we had to remain
four days from a sting that Mathew Travers received in his foot;
his foot got a little better and we proceeded on until we got over
the second tier of mountains, on the fifth day after the death of
Mathers. On the opposite side of the second tier we came to a very
large river, where we made a fire and stayed for two nights and one
day. Greenhill and I went up and down the side of the river looking
for a place that was narrow as Travers could not swim. Greenhill
and I swam across; he carried the axe and I took a little of the
provisions that remained; we then cut a long wattle and put it
across to Travers and pulled him over; we then stopped on the other
side that night; we then proceeded on for two days after this
through very fine country. Travers' foot began to inflame and
turned black, and he said we had better go on and leave him there.
Bob Greenhill and I went to get a little wood; he said "Pierce, it
is of no use to be detained any longer, and we will serve him as
the rest," Deponent said "I will not have any hand in his death."
When we came back Travers lay flat on the ground from the pain in
his foot, he was in all appearance asleep; this was about two
o'clock in the day. Greenhill lifted the axe and hit him Travers,
on the head and cut his throat. We then stopped two days at this
place, we then took all we could with us and got on, inclining to
the left, through a very fine country; the weather was beginning to
get better. We then got over the third tier of western mountains
and came to another large river at the foot of the third tier, and
we stopped there all night; the next morning we got across the
river, part of it we swam and part waded; we came to a most
delightful part of the country, where there was very long grass.
Greenhill began to fret, and said we would never get to any port
with his life. I kept up my spirits all along, and thought we must
shortly come to some inhabited part of the country, from the very
great length we had travelled. I watched Greenhill for two nights,
for I thought he eyed me much more than usual. He always kept the
axe under his head when lying down, and carried it on his back in
the daytime. One night we came to a little creek between two hills,
where we kindled a fire. I thought he had a bad disposition as to
me this night. Near the break of day I found he was asleep; I run
up, took the axe from under his head, and struck him with it, and
killed him; I then took part of his thigh and his arm, and went on
for several days after this till all was completely done. I went on
for two days without anything to eat; I then took a piece of a
leather belt and was going to hang myself, but I took another
notion not to do it. I went on a little further and saw a fire, and
at this fire were pieces of kangaroo and opossums. I picked up
these and eat what I could, and carried the remainder with me. I
then went on for several days, until I came to a little marsh,
where I saw a duck and ten young ones. I made a leap into the
water; the old one flew and the young ones dived; I stood in the
water up to my middle, and up starts two of the young ones at my
feet. I made a grasp at them and caught them both. After this I put
up at a little fresh-water creek, about two hours before dark. The
next day after this I got on the top of a hill, and looking all
round me I saw a large mountain, which I took to be the Table
Mountain. I could not be convinced as to the certainty of it, so I
went on a little further; I then came to a big river at the high
plains, and travelled along it for two days. I came to a flock of
sheep, which belonged to Tom Triffett, at the Falls. I drove them
all forward to a scrub and made a hold at a large one, but it
carried me off and I was forced to let it go, so after that I drove
them up again and caught a lamb, and eat it raw. The hut-keeper
came forward and said he would shoot me if I would not stop
immediately. He then put some questions to me, and then he knew me.
He carried the remains of the lamb, and took me with him to the
hut, and made meat ready for me, where I stopped three days, and he
gave me all attention. He then said that his master was coming up,
and I could not stay there any longer. He brought me down the river
on the fourth morning, and took me across the river to Mr. Lord's
hut, where I stopped a week; he got me rum and anything that he
thought I could take. I made to another hut, which belonged to Tom
Farrell. I then stopped there three weeks, sometimes in the hut and
sometimes out of it. I went then to the Shannon, to Mr. Risely's
hut, nine miles from the other; the hut-keeper was not in; I then
made a fire when in came Davis and Cheetham; they had been in the
bush for some time before for stealing Caserty's sheep; they then
took me to Maquire's hut, which is three miles and a half off, when
Paddy Farrell and Maquire were there and a little boy. We stopped
there till morning and drunk tea and milk. We then came to the
Shannon hut again, and got our breakfast, Cheetham called me out
and asked me what I was going to do. He said if I would come with
him he would do well for me. He brought me to a hill, where they
had a hut and 126 sheep newly marked. They went up the country to
bring more, and I stopped six days with the sheep without anyone
being with me. We then started with the sheep, to take them to the
Lovely Banks, when we came on a Corporal's guard of soldiers. The
soldiers came out of their hut; we then ran away, and came to Bill
Davis' place. The soldiers took the sheep to Captain Wood's. We
stopped at Davis' three days, where I was provided with a musket
and pistol, and kangaroo knapsack. We then went to Green Point,
where we left our dogs at Cox's hut. We stopped there that night,
and came to Stanfield's garden; each of us filled our knapsacks
with fruit; Cox's man was with us; I first went from the Shannon
hut to Mr. Lammas hut, at the little Sugar Loaf, as there was an
old man there I knew. As soon as I went in Mrs. Mortimer was there,
and immediately knew me. As soon as she saw me she said "Pierce, I
thought you were sent to the new settlement." I said "No, the
Governor has forgiven me." This was the woman that first made it
known that I got up. I then went to my old hut, at Rodger Gavin's
hut, where he had different things planted. I stopped there six
days without much provisions, I then went back to the Shannon hut,
where I promised that I would be back at Christmas. I then went to
catch some sheep belonging to Rodger Gavin, but the herdsman saw
me; he then went and gave the alarm to Bill Corney, and they
pursued me, but could not get me. I went then to Captain Bligh's
and got into a cave, and I got a sheep and skinned it; but I was
very near being caught. I stopped there four days and then made to
the Shannon hut, where Cox's man and George Marr and deponent broke
the fruit trees, and each of us took a three-bushel bag of apples
away. We then stopped at the Cove House all that night; we then
went to a hut at Bagdad, where we stopped another night. We then
went to a man named Big Sam, and got a quarter of mutton. We then
came to the Lovely Banks, where we sent in word to Bill Davis'
woman, and we stopped there three days. We then went to Davis at
the Lagoon, after a black gin, who was to get four bushels of flour
from Johnson, the stock-keeper at the first western tier; the black
girl was in the hut and we could not get her out. We dallied there
that night, but was unsuccessful. We then came to Mr. Fryett's hut;
we then awaked next morning and saw a corporal's guard coming upon
us. Bill Davis snatched his piece and run; Corporal Kelly run after
Bill Davis, and the others stayed with us; Kelly fired and missed,
and Bill Davis turned and said "I have you in my power now." Kelly
then run, and cried murder, and the other soldiers run up, and shot
Davis through the thigh and arm. The same trousers deponent still
wears that Davis had on between the Shannon hut and the Big Lake;
there were 250 good sheep, and different other articles planted;
two good watches. No person has been there; deponent says they are
still there; deponent says that James Mortimer, at the Big Lagoon,
has got Mr. Risely's two silver watches and one gold watch; he
further sayeth that at the Relief Creek, at the bottom of the first
western tier of mountains, and in this one mountain, there are many
things planted. When we went to the bush it was all our intentions
to go to the Falls and take a big launch of Mr Lacells; we were
then to rob Tom Triffett and Mr Abel and another person, and take
all their firearms, and cross to Brown's River to take the
schooner, and to proceed home; from that Benjamin Jackson, William
Jarrett, and many others were to go; we also had it in
contemplation to go outside of the Heads and stop until some vessel
should come in sight, and go as if we were the pilot boat, and
surprise them all."</p>
<p>When this depraved criminal, Pearce, was taken by the military,
there being no proof against him but his own confession, which was
not relied upon, he was returned again to the penal settlement of
Macquarie Harbour. When he was ill in the hospital expecting to die
he made this statement, and it was taken down in his own words. He
absconded a second time from the settlement, in 1823, with a
prisoner named Cox, a farmer's labourer. A few days afterwards he
surrendered himself to the authorities, but in the meantime he had
murdered Cox and lived upon his body for three days, although at
the time he gave himself up he had some pork and bread in his
pocket, and he could not consequently have done the dark deed from
pressure of the hunger pangs. He also had some fish which he had
not tasted, saying that human flesh was far preferable. He told
Lieutenant Cuthbertson all the particulars of the murder and that
he would point out the unfortunate remains. A boat was accordingly
dispatched with Pearce early next morning for King's River, well
guarded. After the party had landed and walked about 400 yards by
Pearce's directions, the body was found and brought to the
settlement in a fearfully mangled state, being cut in two at the
middle; the head off; all the flesh off the calves of the legs,
back of the thighs and loins; also off the thick part of the arms,
which the inhuman wretch declared was most delicious food. None of
the intestines were found, and Pearce said that he threw them
behind a tree after having roasted and devoured the heart and part
of the liver. One of the hands was also missing.</p>
<p>On being questioned why he murdered Cox he said they had
quarrelled about the route they were to pursue, and Cox being the
strongest man he was obliged to take up an axe, with which he
knocked him down and killed him. His reason for giving himself up
was, that he had no hope of ultimately escaping, and that he was so
horror-struck at his own inhuman conduct that he did not know what
he was about when he made the signal upon the beach, and which led
to his being taken off the island. He had on the murdered man's
clothes when brought back to the settlement.</p>
<p>On November 21st, 1823, Pearce was taken to Hobart Town, tried
at the criminal court for the murder and executed.</p>

RUFFIAN.</a></h2>
<p>AS several references have been made in these stories to a man
named Mudie, noted for his cruelty to the convicts, a short
historical sketch of that individual's colonial career will not
here be out of place. It will serve to show the sort of men who
fattened on the sweat and blood of their more unfortunate brethren.
Mudie was originally a sub-lieutenant of Marines, but had been
graciously "permitted to retire" under circumstances which required
the exercise of indulgence from his superiors. Entering into a
medal-manufacturing speculation (commemorative of the Peninsular
war) he became involved in financial difficulties and as a
certificated insolvent sought to better his fortunes by crossing
the water to New South Wales, being assisted thereto by a wealthy
acquaintance in England. On his arrival he secured a grant of land
at Patrick's Plains, on the Hunter River, in New South Wales, and
in the course of a few years was able to run an extensive
establishment, having on his "plantation" between forty and fifty
assigned servants. The position of the convicts assigned to "The
Major," as he was called, was an unenviable one. They had better
have been on the chain gang, for their master looked upon them as
slaves, only created to do his bidding, and to labour continuously
at the highest tension on poor food and abundant lashes. According
to his theory, convicts could not be treated to the slightest
indulgence without endangering their usefulness as beasts of
burden, and the best of them could never be reformed. Perpetual
motion and perpetual punishment were the only things favoured by
him, and many a poor wretch had to serve him and suffer under him
for long after the original sentence of transportation in his case
had expired. The lash was Mudie's little god, and he worshipped it
as a savage only can worship a thing of evil, keeping it always in
motion, and never permitting the blood to get dry. And he boasted
of his harshness, as though it were something whereof any man might
be proud. In a book called "The Felonry" which he had printed (but
which he found it necessary to suppress on account of its many
libels) he drew his own portrait. Speaking of the convicts as a
whole he said "Nothing could wash their guilt or obliterate its
brand,.. . Regarding their punishment as a means of deterring other
persons in England from the commission of similar crimes, the
<i>prolongation of the punishment is justified even in cases in
which the reformation may have already been accomplished."</i></p>
<p>It was right, of course, that a man of such pronounced ideas
concerning transportation and penal discipline should be allowed
fair opportunity of proving the truth of his theories by practical
experiment, and hence Governor Darling appointed him to the
magistracy. As a magistrate and a master Mudie practiced all he
preached&mdash;and more. He called his establishment "Castle
Forbes," in honour of the man who had assisted him to emigrate, and
here it was that the bloody work was done which made him notorious
in an age of bloody deeds. The scenes which were enacted under his
personal superintendence have never been fully described, for they
were indescribable; but the result of his brutal treatment was soon
made manifest in outrages and acts of desperation by the poor
wretches who were the victims of his brutality. At last a climax
was reached. Five of the convicts at "Castle Forbes," driven to
desperation and despair, seized firearms at the station, broke away
and took to the bush, first attempting to shoot the overseer. The
men were pursued by the police, captured, and eventually hanged;
but the story they told in court led to an inquiry being held, and
eventually Mudie was removed from the Commission of the Peace. Here
is what Judge Therry says concerning the trial of the
men:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Convicts on their trials for capital offences were usually
unprovided with counsel; they had seldom (except cattle-stealers,
who were a wealthy tribe of robbers) means to defray the cost of a
defence. In such cases, on the trial of aboriginal natives,
Government defrayed the expense of counsel for the prisoners; but
this provision did not extend to convicts. There was at this time,
however, a benevolent person in Sydney, possessed of ample means,
who, on condition only that his name should not be disclosed,
defrayed the cost of counsel on several trials of convicts on
capital charges; and on this occasion it happened to me to be thus
employed as counsel for Mudie's men. The trial presented a truly
painful exhibition. The men took their places in the dock, as I
took mine at the bar, in utter hopelessness of their escape from
conviction. They had repeatedly declared before their trial, and
afterwards, that they would prefer death to being returned to the
service of their late employer. Evidence of their guilt was too
transparent to admit of doubt, and the only line of defence that I
conceived in any way available for them was to shew that their
treatment had been such as to present some mitigatory features
which might lead to the infliction of a punishment short of death.
By this course I, no doubt, greatly displeased Mudie, and all who
identify the duties of counsel with his private opinions, and look
upon him as the approver of crime, and not the mere defender of the
criminal. The men were tried under a local ordinance, called 'The
Bushrangers' Act,' which rendered them liable to execution
twenty-four hours after sentence. They were found guilty; and then
ensued a scene in court such as is not likely again to be enacted
in New South Wales, or it may be hoped anywhere. On being called
upon in the usual solemnity of form to say why sentence of death
should not be pronounced upon them, Hitchcock, the most intelligent
of the five men, said he had no ground to offer, but he implored
the Government to institute an inquiry into their past treatment;
the floggings they had undergone; the frivolous excuses resorted to
for the purpose of depriving them of their liberty after they had
served a period that entitled them to its partial enjoyment, by
being granted tickets-of-leave; the bad and insufficient food they
had received; the system of merciless infliction of the lash
throughout the district of the Hunter River. On behalf of the
convict population he implored this act of justice and of mercy. He
proceeded to denounce by name the proprietors on whose
establishment he alleged these floggings were incessant. Hitchcock
was stopped by the Court, and he concluded by requesting permission
that he and his fellow prisoners <i>might be permitted to exhibit
their lacerated backs to the public gaze in Court,</i> to show what
tortures they had endured. This request, of course, could not be
complied with; the fatal sentence was passed, and they were
executed. The Solicitor-General (Mr. Plunkett) humanely forebore to
insist on their execution in twenty-four hours after the sentence,
and assented to their having a reasonable time to prepare for
death. These prisoners were all young men, in the prime of life,
varying from twenty to thirty-two. Poole, one of them, was an
excellent carpenter; and two others were mechanics. The whole scene
caused a shudder that thrilled, not only through the Court, but
through the heart of the colony. They died with the same expression
of complaint on their lips as those to which they gave utterance on
the trial."</p>
<p>Men shudder as they read of the tortures inflicted upon captives
in the old days of darkness; and they feel the hot blood of anger
rush through their veins as they read of the horrible cruelties
practiced in Siberia. But where can the reader find a more horrible
tale, or a more affecting, of magisterial brutality on the one hand
and passive suffering on the other? There be wretches surely who
have lived in New South Wales, sitting in high seats of honour, and
wielding a power almost unlimited, whose backs shall be whipped by
scorpions of fire as fiercely as they in their insensate love of
blood did lash the poor mortals in this sunny land when the days of
its life were young. If it be impious, it is but human, to feel a
sort of satisfaction in the thought that there is a day of
reckoning in their future, and that the blood of the poor,
hard-driven, helpless, forsaken manacled ones does not cry unheeded
to heaven from this earth. What a strong tide of wrath shall pour
upon these merciless wretches when the flood-gates of Divine
Justice are let loose!</p>
<p>The complaints of the five men did not fall upon ears altogether
deaf to the cry of the sufferers. An inquiry was instituted by the
Government, and the result of the investigations, to use the
temperate words of Mr. Flanagan, "was a condemnation of the mode in
which assigned servants were dealt with at Castle Forbes." Mudie
was struck off the commission of the peace, and left for England in
1835. He gave evidence before the Transportation committee in that
year, but told so many fabulous tales of the convicts as to destroy
his case entirely. Portions of his evidence were ordered to be
struck out by the Committee, and other parts were proved quite
untrustworthy; Sir R. Peel, one of the Committee, absenting himself
from the inquiry with the remark that "the witness (Mudie) under
examination had told such improbable tales he could place no
reliance on such evidence." Subsequently Mudie came back to the
colony, but the respectable classes of the community shunned him,
and his power of indulgence in his favorite pastime having been
broken, he returned to England, carrying away on his back the marks
of a severe horsewhipping which he had received at the hands of the
son of the Attorney-General in the principal street of Sydney, as
punishment for a libel upon the young man's aged father. In common
with the memories of other notoriously bad men, the memory of Mudie
cannot die. It must live for execration.</p>

<p>AMONG the many thousands of convicts sent to New South Wales
there were, as I have said, many very good men and many very bad
men. It would not be by any means a difficult task for a vigorous
writer, having the old records before him, to fill a bulky volume
with personal histories of remarkable convicts&mdash;histories full
of incidents and experiences more sensational than have ever
appeared in any work of fiction. I will endeavour to gather up a
few of these personal histories and present them in as concise a
form as possible, taking one or two from the better class
first.</p>
<h2>THE SCOTCH MARTYRS.</h2>
<p>In the month of September, 1794, shortly before the advent of
Governor Hunter, there arrived in the colony as convicts four
gentlemen, known generally as the Scotch Martyrs&mdash;Messrs.
Muir, Palmer, Skirving and Margaret; and a few months after their
arrival another, a Mr. Gerald, was sent to keep them company. Mr.
Palmer&mdash;who had been a clergyman&mdash;was under sentence of
seven years, and the others under sentence of fourteen years. They
had been convicted of what was called sedition, having "stimulated
the people of Great Britain to effect a reform of Parliament."
Students of Scottish law have always declared that the sentence
passed upon these men was illegal, and its harshness and severity
therefore stand out in bolder relief. They were all men of
peaceable lives and estimable characters, but no merit could weigh
with statesmen and judges of a nation whose governing classes were
mad with excitement and terror consequent upon the French
revolution. The man to-day who can effect a reform of Parliament is
highly honoured of his fellows; but in those days the slightest
breath of censure upon established institutions was condemned as
treason, and the man who dared to breath it was dealt with as a
traitor, only a shade in crime below the man who plotted to take
the monarch's life. These well-meaning, honest, outspoken,
philanthropic men, whose misfortune it was to be born in an age of
ignorance and tyranny (these two things always go together when the
party moved by them possesses power)&mdash;these truly unfortunate
men were sent from England to herd with the rogues and thieves and
murderers who were accounted too vile to live on British soil. It
would have been a merciful act on the part of the English
Government to have hanged them straight off, for the fate of four
out of the five of these Scotch Martyrs was very melancholy. Mr.
Gerald, who was a man of delicate susceptibility and refined
manners, robbed the Government of thirteen years service by dying
within a year of his landing in the colony. The iron had entered
his soul when sentence of transportation had been pronounced. Three
days afterwards Mr. Skirving followed him into the land of the
Unknown. He died of a broken heart, but the Government doctor
called it dysentery&mdash;a convict was not supposed to possess a
heart. Mr. Palmer lived to serve his sentence and started for
"home," but died before the vessel reached England. Mr. Muir, who
had made a reputation at the bar in Scotland, made his escape from
the colony in an American vessel, called the "Otter," which had
been hired by certain gentlemen in New York to touch at Port
Jackson for the express purpose of carrying him off, they having
known and admired him previously. On leaving, Mr. Muir sent a
letter to the Governor, stating that he did not intend to infringe
the laws of his country by returning to Great Britain, but that he
would endeavour to reach America, where he would practice as a
barrister till the expiration of his sentence should allow of his
returning to Scotland. But the scheme which promised so fair ended
most disastrously. The "Otter" was wrecked on the west coast of
America, and Mr. Muir suffered great hardships in endeavouring to
reach Mexico, travelling along the coast. From Mexico he obtained a
passage to Europe in a Spanish frigate, but his evil star was still
in the ascendancy. A British man-of-war fell in with the frigate
when off Cadiz; an engagement followed; the frigate was captured;
and Mr Muir was injured during the engagement, part of his brain
being actually shot away. In this condition, and when lying
apparently dead upon the deck of the frigate, he was seen and
recognized by a Scotch officer, who had previously known him, from
a small pocket Bible which had been given him by his mother, and
which he held in his hand with the grasp of death. The officer
humanely kept the discovery to himself, and had Muir conveyed to an
hospital on the Spanish coast, where he recovered sufficiently to
enable him to proceed to Paris. Here, however, he again fell ill,
and shortly afterwards crossed the dark river to join the
companions who had been set free before him. Thus died four out of
the five&mdash;victims to a law which would disgrace a country of
heathen. Mr. Margarot was the only one of the five who lived to
return to his native country, which he did in 1813, after the
expiration of his sentence; and he rendered good service by
exposing before the Committee of the House of Commons some of the
abominations and atrocities which were practical in the colony by
the men who had been sent there in soldiers' uniform to administer
justice and preserve the law. It is only due to Governor Hunter to
mention that he did all in his power to make the burden of these
unfortunate gentlemen as light as possible. He was a good friend to
them in their distress, and the inhabitants generally looked upon
them as hardly-used men, worthy of the deepest sympathy, which they
unstintingly accorded to them. Sterling worth was recognized in the
colony even in those days.</p>
<h2>THE IRISH REBELS.</h2>
<p>A large number of persons who had taken part in the Irish
rebellion of "Ninety-eight" were transported to New South Wales,
and not a few of them were clergymen, lawyers, doctors,
journalists, and members of other professions, whose genteel
calling and inexperience in the exercises of labour rendered them
altogether unfit for ordinary service under Government, or as
ordinary assigned servants. Several of them were, however, utilized
in Government offices, while others made themselves valuable to
wealthy free settlers or emancipists who required clerical
assistance. The employers of convict labour complained very
bitterly that the British authorities should send men to the colony
who were incapable of labour; but while these growlers only looked
with favour upon men who could be used as working bullocks, there
were others who hailed the advent of men of good morals and
considerable intellectual attainments as a great communal blessing.
The political offences for which the "Ninety-Eighters" were
transported were not considered to be very serious on this side the
water, where it was easy to mark the degrees of crime. Amongst the
most remarkable of these exiled rebels were Rev. H. Fulton, a
clergyman of the Church of England; Rev. Father Harold, who had
been parish priest of Reculla, county Dublin; William H. Alcock,
who had been a captain in a regiment of the line; Dr. O'Connor, who
was Alcock's brother-in-law; and Joseph Holt, who had been the
principal leader of the Irish rebel army, and who was universally
known as General Holt. The first of these five gentlemen did active
service as Government chaplain in the colony, and was acting in
that capacity when Governor Bligh was deposed, being at the time at
Government House, and proving how much of a rebel he was by
sacrificing his personal interests in endeavouring to shelter the
Governor from the cowardly attack which the mob of the New South
Wales Corps made upon him. The last-named of the five rebels was in
many respects a remarkable man, and although he did not enter very
prominently into the life of the colony, he left at his death
(which took place in Dublin in 1826) a singularly interesting
biography, which shews more clearly than can be gathered from
official documents the peculiar conditions of the life in the
colony, during the period of his exile.</p>
<p>The story of Holt's life has been thus summarised in Bennett's
Australian Discovery and Colonization:&mdash;"He was an Irish
Protestant of English extraction, a native of Ballydaniel, in the
county of Wicklow. His father was a small farmer, and Holt himself
was brought up to the same occupation. He afterwards, in addition
to his agricultural pursuits, became road contractor and overseer
of public works for the Barony of Ballynecore. At the time of the
breaking out of the rebellion, in 1798, he was a thriving yeoman,
upwards of forty years of age, a loyal subject, and a staunch
Protestant. He knew little or nothing of politics, and looked upon
the rebels as people deserving the most severe punishment that
could possibly be inflicted for daring to raise their hands against
the government. It is an extraordinary fact that, notwithstanding
the position of rebel general in which circumstances afterwards
placed him, he continued to hold the most loyal opinions as long as
he lived. Probably few instances can be found in which a man was
carried by the stream of events in a course so directly opposite to
that in which his habits, religion, character, and convictions
would have led him. For some years previous to 1798 he had made
himself many enemies by his energetic and courageous capture of
many desperate offenders against the laws; and in addition to this
he had incurred, on account of some pecuniary quarrel, in which he
says he was greatly wronged, the rancorous enmity of a wealthy and
powerful but unprincipled neighbour. This man, who afterwards
occupied a very conspicuous place in Irish Society, was, or
professed to be, a rabid royalist, and lost no opportunity of
ingratiating himself with the Government by denouncing and
prosecuting obnoxious neighbours. When martial law was proclaimed,
this man's position as a magistrate enabled him to ravage the
district in which Holt lived with fire and sword. He burnt to the
ground the houses and homesteads of many Catholic families, driving
the men to join the rebels in the Wicklow mountains, while the
women and children were reduced to a state of starvation. Holt,
notwithstanding that he was a Protestant, and an unswerving
upholder of English rule, had always been a great favorite with his
Catholic neighbours, and was ever ready to take their part when he
thought they were oppressed. Being a bold, outspoken man, he did
not hesitate to denounce the conduct of the magistrate referred to,
and endeavoured to interfere in behalf of his poorer and less loyal
neighbours. He knew that the persecutions which they suffered
proceeded much more from private malice, and the officious zeal of
bad men in the advancement of their own personal and selfish
interests, than from any wish or intention of the British
Government to oppress his Catholic fellow subjects. Holt's
interference, although it does not appear to have taken any more
tangible form than that of uttering strong words against the
oppressor, and the extending of sympathy and assistance to the
oppressed, was fatal to his interests. He was denounced by his
powerful neighbour and personal enemy as a rebel, or as an aider
and abettor of rebels, his house and property were burned and
destroyed, his wife and children thrown upon the world, and to save
his life he was obliged to fly to the mountains to seek the
assistance of others similarly situated. Even under these
circumstances his loyalty was never shaken for a moment. He looked
upon the rebels and their cause as utterly contemptible. He knew
nothing of republican theories, and cared nothing about political
parties. He had been grossly wronged, but did not blame the
Government; for all his aspirations began and ended in a wish to
redress local grievances and to punish the petty tyrants who had
burnt his house, rendered his family homeless, and driven his
neighbours to desperate courses. In his autobiography he never
neglects an opportunity of giving expression to his contempt for
those who had engaged in the rebellion from political motives, and
he is the more especially severe upon those who, having occupied
respectable positions, had sacrificed life, liberty, or property
for the sake of what he thought Quixotic theories and sentimental
notions of liberty. He appears to have been a courageous,
outspoken, ready-witted, but somewhat vain and hot-tempered man, of
very limited education, but with a good address, commanding
presence, and a very determined expression of countenance. The poor
misguided, ignorant peasants whom he found in arms in the Wicklow
mountains had been deserted, as soon as real danger appeared, by
many unprincipled cowards who had helped to fan the spark of
rebellion into a flame, and their numbers were daily augmented by
ruffians who sought only an opportunity for plunder. The rabble
rout of rebels hailed the accession of Holt to their ranks with the
greatest joy. They knew he was a man of honesty of purpose,
courage, and capacity, and they insisted on his being their leader.
He had no choice. He could not return to his ruined home, for a
price was set upon his head, and to refuse the position to which
the rebels wished to elevate him was to court the suspicion and
ensure the enmity of the most desperate gang of ruffians that ever
robbed and plundered in the name of liberty. He endeavoured to
gather round him as a body-guard men who like himself had private
wrongs to redress, or who were sincere in their desire for the
political regeneration of their country; but during the many months
that he acted as rebel leader he was never free from the fear of
being assassinated or betrayed by his followers for the sake of the
reward offered by the Government. Having led his men through many
successful conflicts, he at length ventured to assert his
authority, although often in vain, to prevent outrage and plunder.
At one period his army&mdash;if an almost undisciplined mob could
properly be called an army&mdash;numbered about thirteen thousand
men. He says they were for the most part the most despicable set of
cowards, fools, and knaves that ever disgraced humanity. His
reliable men, those who actually fought for aught but plunder, do
not seem to have numbered more than a few hundreds at any time, and
as there never was the slightest political sympathy between him and
even his best followers, it is no wonder that they soon dwindled to
a few scores. He got rid of the thousands of plunderers who
followed his effective force as best he could, and at one time was
so disgusted with their atrocities that he sent information of
their whereabouts to a party of the royal troops, with the hope
that they would attack and disperse or cut them to pieces. He saw
the utter hopelessness and absurdity of the rebellion from the
first, and resolved to make terms for himself if he could possibly
do so without betraying his companions. He was at last enabled to
effect this object by giving himself up to Lord Powerscourt, with
the implied condition that his life should be spared. He was never
brought to trial, but banished for life, and by the kindness and
munificence of a lady who felt a deep interest in the welfare of
his wife and family, Mrs. Holt and his son Joshua were provided
with passages on board the ship despatched by the Government to
convey him and other rebels to New South Wales. Joshua Holt,
although a boy of but twelve or fourteen years of age at the time
of the rebellion, went through some very remarkable scenes in that
memorable outbreak. When his father, about fourteen years
afterwards obtained a full pardon and returned to Ireland, Joshua
remained in the colony, where he married, brought up a large
family, and lived, much respected, to about the age of four-score
years. He died, a short time since, in Elizabeth street, Sydney. He
was fond of recalling the recollections of his boyish life, and
recounting the strange scenes he had witnessed in his early
youth."</p>
<p>A good deal in Holt's life (published in London in 1838) which
refers to the character and conduct of colonial authorities is
couched in terms of great bitterness, and abusive epithets are very
freely indulged in. His troubles commenced almost immediately after
he landed. His position was a peculiar one&mdash;for although he
had never been tried and convicted he had come to the colony in a
prison ship, and it was therefore considered at first by the
colonial authorities that he was entirely at their disposal; and as
he was known to be a man of great energy and intelligence, and well
acquainted with agricultural pursuits, more than one of the wealthy
settlers attempted to get him handed over to them as an assigned
servant. With this view they wished to convince him that he would
be much better off in such a position than if he remained under the
direct control of the government. This selfish plan Mr. Holt met in
such a manner as to make those who proposed it almost regret having
done so. They soon saw that he was not a likely man to allow
himself to be made a useful tool in their hands. As a specimen of
how "government men" were worked and treated in those days he gives
the following account of what he was shewn as a warning or taste
what he might expect if he was determined to resist being assigned
to a private master. The Rev. Mr. Marsden, the gentleman who
particularly wished to obtain his services, took him a few days
after his arrival to see a government gang at work. Here is the
narrative in his own words:&mdash;</p>
<p>"He requested me to accompany them, and we proceeded to a
government settlement, where they were tilling the ground on the
public account. At a distance I saw about fifty men at work, as I
thought, dressed in nankeen jackets, but, on nearer approach, I
found them naked, except a pair of loose trousers. Their skin was
tanned by the sun and climate to that colour. I felt much pity for
the poor wretches: they had each a kind of large hoe, about nine
inches deep and eight wide, and the handle as thick as that of a
shovel, with which they turned up, as with a spade, the ground,
which was left to rot in the winter. They cannot bear any clothes
when at work in the heat of the day.</p>
<p>"Captain Johnstone addressed me, saying 'Mr Holt, you are a good
farmer, I suppose?'</p>
<p>"'I do well enough with horses and oxen, but not with men,' said
I.</p>
<p>"Dr. Thompson then said, 'Do you think those men would
understand you better than horses or oxen?'</p>
<p>"'Yes, sir,' I replied, 'but it appears great brutality to work
men in this manner.'</p>
<p>"'Well,' said he, 'it matters not what you think about it, you
will soon come into it.'"</p>
<p>Shortly after this Mr. Holt became agricultural superintendent
for Mr. W. Cox, one of the largest cultivators and stock owners in
the colony at that period. He had returned from a visit to Europe
in the same ship that brought out Holt and the other Irish rebels,
and thus became acquainted with him. Holt's account of his
management of the many convicts under his control, and the
particulars he gives concerning farming operations, &amp;c., are
full of interest. Respecting the management of convicts, he
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"As to the convicts, there was a certain quantity of work which,
by the government regulations, they must do in a given time, and
this may be given to them by the day, week, or month, as you
pleased, and they must be paid a certain price for all the work
they did beyond the stipulated quantity. If they were idle, and did
not do the required quantity of work, it was only necessary to take
them before a magistrate, and he would order them twenty-five
lashes of the cat on their backs, for the first offence, fifty for
the second, and so on; and if that would not do, they were at last
put into a gaol gang, and made to work in irons from morning to
night.</p>
<p>"In order to keep them honest, I paid them fully and fairly for
all they did beyond their stipulated task at the same rate as I
paid the free men, and, if I thought the rations not sufficient for
their comfortable support, I issued to each man six pounds of
wheat, fourteen of potatoes, and one of pork, in addition. By this
means the men were well fed; for the old saying is true that
'Hunger will break through stone walls,' and it is all nonsense to
make laws for starving men. When any article was stolen from me I
instantly paraded all hands and told them that 'if it was not
restored in a given time, I would stop all extra allowances and
indulgences; the thief,' said I, 'is a disgrace to the
establishment and all employed in it; let the honest men find him
out, and punish him among yourselves; do not let it be said that
the flogger ever polluted this place by his presence. You all know
the advantages you enjoy above gangs on any other estate in the
colony, do not then throw them away. Do not let me know who the
thief is, but punish him by your own verdict.' I then dismissed
them. The transports would say amongst themselves that what I had
told them was all right. 'We won't,' they would reason, 'be
punished because there happens to be an ungrateful thief amongst
us.' They then called a jury and entered into an investigation,
and, on all occasions, succeeded in detecting and punishing the
offender. I was by this line of conduct secure from plunder; and
the disgusting operation of flaying a man alive, with a
cat-o'-nine-tails did not disgrace the farms under my
superintendence. Mr. Cox one day said to me 'Pray, Joseph, how is
it that you never have to bring your men to punishment. You have
more men under you than, I believe, any man in the colony, and to
the surprise of all you have never had one flogged, or indeed have
made a complaint against one; they look well, and appear contented,
and even happy.' 'Sir,' said I, 'I have studied human nature more
than books. I had the management of many more men in my country,
and I was always rigidly just to them. I never oppressed them or
suffered them to cheat their employers or each other. They knew if
they did their duty they would be well treated, and if not, sent to
the right-about. I follow the same course with men here. I have
taught them the advantages they derive from good conduct, and I
make them punish an offender themselves: therefore, if any
depredation be committed upon your property, they are told that all
allowances and indulgences will be stopped, until whatever is
missing be restored. The crime, therefore, becomes one against
them-selves, and they have better means of detecting it than I
have. They call a jury and convict and punish the offender. I
should myself be very ill qualified to act as your agent and
overseer, were I to have a man or two flogged every week. Besides
the horrible inhumanity of this practice, the loss of a man's week
or fortnight's work will not be a trifle in a year, at twelve and
sixpence per week; for the man who gets the cat is incapable of
work till his back is well; so in prudence, as well as in Christian
charity, it is best to treat our fellow-creatures like men,
although they be degraded to the state of convict slaves. They
will, moreover, when properly treated, be sensible of kindness, and
find that they better themselves by behaving well. But, as you ask
me, I will shew you my private flogger.' I then went to an outhouse
and brought Mr. Cox two hoes, one of which weighed three pounds and
a half, the other seven. He took the lightest in his hand, and said
it was a very good one. I then handed him the seven pound hoe,
which he took into his hand, and after a time said, 'This is a
terrible tool.' 'Well, sir,' said I, 'there is my punishment; the
man who misbehaves knows he will get the seven pounder, and I have
great satisfaction in saying it has been used but once, and then
only for a short time.'</p>
<p>"'The greater number of overseers in the colony,' I continued,
'have been criminals themselves, and have neither prudence, honour,
or humanity; they are ruffians, who are actuated and influenced by
the worst passions, and frequently flog an unfortunate wretch for
complaining of their oppressions. No man could insult me by saying,
"I am as good as you, for you were a thief, and I am no worse!"
Believe me, sir, thieves never make good masters, or use power with
moderation or humanity.'"</p>
<p>It would have been a blessed thing for the colony if there had
been more overseers and more masters of the stamp of Mr. Holt and
Mr. Cox. Of the latter gentleman (some of whose descendants still
live in the colony, rich in the possession of this world's goods,
and rich also in the enjoyment of the esteem and respect of the
community), Holt says:&mdash;"There never was a man who desired to
serve another more than he did, or to do a kind act. When the
purchaser of a horse or mare came to make his first payment, Mr.
Cox would often indulge him with six months' longer credit. He was
truly a good friend to every honest man he met with. His good
treatment of the convicts in his service had the happiest effect
upon many of those who were so lucky as to get into his service;
most of them by finding out that honesty was the best policy,
became sincerely honest and well-conducted, and were purged and
purified from their former detestable propensities, and lived and
died valuable members of society. So much does gentle and mild
treatment win upon the minds of men, while harsh severity and
coercion hardens their hearts, and brutalizes their character."</p>
<p>Holt uses very warm language in his denunciation of the conduct
of the military officers, who were as selfish and unprincipled in
their dealing with the settlers and the soldiers as they were cruel
to the convicts. Here is what he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The practice was to draw from the stores all the goods, in
large quantities, and to pay the soldiers only in goods; for every
ten shilling's worth of which, according to the value they were
delivered at out of the store, the soldiers paid twenty, and if
they objected to this mode of payment they were most probably sent
to the guard-house, tried by a court-martial for mutiny, and
sentenced to imprisonment.</p>
<p>"Captain Anthony Fenn Kemp, when a soldier came to him for his
month's pay, would usually accost him with 'Well, what do you
want?'</p>
<p>"'I want to be paid, Sir,' the soldier would say.</p>
<p>"'What will you have?' was always Captain Kemp's answer. 'I have
very good tobacco, ten shillings the pound, and very good tea at
twenty shillings the pound, prints at eight shillings a yard,' and
so on.</p>
<p>"If the poor soldier answered, 'Sir, I do not want any of your
goods,' the Captain's comment was, 'You don't! You are a d&mdash;d
saucy rascal.' Perhaps then the soldier would say, 'Sir, if you
please, give me half money and half goods.' But this proposal was
equally objectionable to Captain Kemp, and generally led to his
thundering out, 'Begone, you d&mdash;d mutinous scoundrel, or I'll
send you to the guard-house, and have you flogged for your
impertinence to your officer.' The soldier, having no redress,
would take his monthly pay in property which he did not want, and
then he would endeavour to dispose of what he had received to some
person who had money; generally selling it for half the price he
was charged by his captain. This system of monopoly and extortion
compelled the soldier to serve his Majesty for half his nominal
pay; I can prove what I assert, as I have often bought goods from
the soldiers myself, upon these terms. It was, I must confess, very
provoking to see the officers draw the goods from the public store,
to traffic in them for their own private gain, which goods were
sent out for the advantage of the settlers, who were compelled to
deal with those huckter officers for such articles as they might
require, giving them from fifty to five hundred per cent. profit,
and paying in grain.</p>
<p>"It thus would happen, that one of these monopolisers, who never
grew a grain, would sometimes have a thousand bushels of wheat to
put in the store; and this was the manner in which all those old
tailors, and shoemakers, stay-makers, man-milliners, tobacconists,
and pedlars, that were called captains and lieutenants, made their
fortunes; by the extortion and the oppression of the soldier, the
settler, and the poor. Anyone who doubts what I assert, may inquire
of any soldier who ever belonged to the 102nd regiment of foot,
concerning my statements, and he will find what I say to be
correct."</p>
<p>There were two officers of the New South Wales Corps, however,
of whom Holt spoke in the highest terms of praise&mdash;Captain
Piper and Captain Abbott, whom he described as "men of honour and
resolution," and said of them:&mdash;"They conducted themselves, in
all respect, as officers and gentlemen. They served the poor and
they upheld the oppressed, by which they kept themselves poor; but
they would have been rich indeed if prayers and good wishes could
have made them wealthy, and they retained their own self-respect.
They were too noble-minded to desire to make a fortune from the
labour of the settler, the plunder of the soldier, or from the
sweat of the convict labourer."</p>
<p>Mr. Holt's name was brought into great prominence in connection
with the unsuccessful insurrection of convicts at Castle Hill in
1804, but, as the sequel will shew, he was wrongfully charged with
complicity in the insurrection. When it became known that there was
a rising on the part of the convicts, the officials and the
military at once fixed upon Holt as the man who was to lead them,
his former connection with the rebels in Ireland, doubtless, first
causing suspicion to fall upon him. It was also known that he was
extremely popular with the convicts, by reason of the practical
sympathy manifested by him towards those who suffered ill-treatment
at the hands of harsh masters. Mr. Cox, his employer, however,
placed the highest confidence in his integrity and loyalty, and the
reader will hereafter see that that confidence was not misplaced.
Here, is the statement given by Holt in his Memoirs:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I now approach a period of my life which I consider the most
unfortunate in the whole of my existence. In February, 1804, the
devil was as busy in New South Wales as ever he had been in
Ireland, and exerted all his evil influence. The lower people,
convicts and others, both English and Irish, seeing their torment
increasing in this most ill-managed colony, conceived an opinion
that they could overpower the army, possess themselves of the
settlement, and eventually make their escape from it. Where they
were to go did not enter into the contemplation of these poor
fellows, who fancied, at all events, that they could not be worse
off than they were already. Some of them hinted to me that they
thought such a thing might be done. I thought so, too, and that it
might come to a head; and therefore pointed out, in the strongest
language I was master of, the folly of such an attempt. 'You saw,'
said I, 'in Ireland, that even there you could not depend on each
other, and I am sure it would be worse here. An insurrection will
only add to your misery, or bring you to the gallows.'</p>
<p>"Their numbers were contemptible, and their means still more so;
therefore they must accordingly fail, and be hanged. I told them I
would have nothing to do with the business, and if such a scheme
should be put into execution, I would act on the side of the
Government and the laws.</p>
<p>"I did hope this advice would have had the desired effect, but
the foolish people had set their minds upon it, and were determined
to proceed, cost what it might. The English were as much involved
in the business as the Irish. Of course, after declaring my
sentiments so fully, I was not kept in their confidence; and I had
almost forgotten that such an idea had ever been hinted at.</p>
<p>"On 4th March, 1804, when returning home through Parramatta, I
saw several men standing about in little gangs, and recollecting
what had been told me, I suspected something was going on, but said
nothing. Having dined at Parramatta, I walked out, and met Timothy
Holister, task-master of the Government men. He and I seldom met
but we drank together, when time permitted, and on the present
occasion we called for a decanter of rum. He was an Englishman, and
while we were drinking he said to me 'Mr. Holt, take my advice and
do not be out late to-night, as I should be sorry to hear anything
against you.' I asked him what he meant, and he then told me that
the Irishmen were to break out that night, but that the Government
were in possession of their plans. I immediately proceeded to Mr.
Cox and brought my wife and child to his house, and told him what I
had heard. He asked me my opinion of the business; to which I
answered that I knew nothing more than what I had heard and told
him, but that I should be ready to defend his house, and keep off
any assailants. He gave Sergeant King, who was his clerk, orders to
prepare some cartridges, and we were all on the alert. Mr. Cox said
it was very likely that the insurgents would endeavour to force me
to head them, and, if I refused, would put me to death. My answer
was 'I can die but once, and from this spot nothing shall induce me
to move until the morning.'</p>
<p>"I then proceeded to secure the doors, gates and all the
defences I could think of. I got the timber-carriage chains and
lapped them round the gates and posts. There were three gates to be
passed before the court-yard could be entered, and I made all fast.
Having thus got all things as secure as possible, I proceeded to
examine the state of our fire-arms, and having loaded our muskets
with buck shot, I asked Mr. Cox if he would take the command. He
gave it to me, saying I was more accustomed to such matters than he
was, and he had no doubt would make a good fight of it, I therefore
proceeded to make arrangements, in case we should be attacked.</p>
<p>"I placed Mr. Cox on my right, opposite a large gate post,
fourteen inches square, and Sergeant King on my left, telling him
that it was not fair that he should receive his Majesty's money for
doing nothing. John Joyce was placed at the upper gate, and Darby
Murphy at the lower gate for a watchman. I then told every man what
he had to do, and that the first man who stirred from his post,
without my orders, should receive the contents of my musket in his
body. I took the centre myself, being flanked by Mr. Cox and King.
The road or path leading to the house was only sixteen feet wide,
and it was paled in with a six-foot paling, so that a party would
be obliged to keep very close together. We heard the insurgents at
the distance of about half a mile, but they came no nearer to
us.</p>
<p>"About twelve at night, however, they went to my farm, and took
away a musket and a blunderbus from my son, who was but fourteen
years old; and a young man, named James Dobbs, an Englishman, they
forced to join them. My shepherd was so small that they did not
consider him worth their attention; but they swore they would soon
have me. When they were gone, Joshua, my son, came through the bush
and told us what had happened at the Brush Farm; we put him into
the house, with Mrs. Cox, my wife, and the children, and stood to
our post till morning, when Mr. Cox rode over to inquire the cause
of the proceedings of the night."</p>
<p>The rebellion, of which Holt here speaks was the only serious
organized uprising that took place among the convicts within the
colony. The spirit of insubordination had been growing for months,
and the Government, fearing some such outbreak, prudently drafted
some of the leading "suspects" from the general body, and sent them
to form a new settlement at Van Diemen's Land&mdash;a step most
wise and prudent. But about midnight on Sunday, March 4th, a
message was received in Sydney from Parramatta, by Governor King,
to the effect that the prisoners employed on the farms in that
locality had joined the Government gangs engaged on the roads and
public buildings at Toongabbie and Castle Hill, and having
plundered the settlers of their arms and ammunition, were then
marching in a body upon Parramatta, committing serious depredations
and plunders. The Governor immediately set out for the scene of the
disturbance, and reached Parramatta before daylight next morning.
Major Johnston, with fifty men of the New South Wales Corps,
joining him there soon afterwards. This small force was at once
divided into two parties, and sallied out in different directions,
in the hope of falling in with the insurgents and surprising them;
and at about noon that day the party commanded by Major Johnston,
which had been joined by some of the respectable settlers of the
district, fell in with the insurgents at a place called the Ponds,
midway between Parramatta and Windsor. The body of convicts was
found to be between 200 and 300 strong, and well armed; and when
they perceived that their pursuers were comparatively so small in
numbers they decided to give them battle, and took up a position on
the slope of a hill, as being good vantage ground. Two of the
ringleaders, with a boldness born of a mistaken sense of superior
strength, advanced towards Major Johnston, who was leading the
pursuing soldiers, their object being apparently to parley or
dictate terms; but as soon as they were sufficiently near the Major
seized one of them and placed a pistol at his head, while a
quarter-master in the Corps, named Laycock, ran forward and killed
the second ruffian with a single blow. The other insurgents at once
opened fire upon the attacking party, but their shots did not tell,
and the military and the settlers returned the fire with such
effect that many of the insurgents fell, and the remainder turned
and fled. A chase ensued and was continued for three or four hours,
resulting in the capture of a number of the prisoners, who were
brought into Windsor, as also was the body of the slain leader,
which was the same night hung up in front of the public store in
the town as a warning to others. Within the next few days many of
the insurgents who had escaped death or capture gave themselves up
to the authorities; those who had been captured with arms in their
hands were summarily tried, convicted, and hanged; while others of
the insurgents received minor punishments, some of them even being
let off with a reprimand upon professing penitence and promising to
return quietly to their work. It is said that between fifty and
sixty of the insurgents were killed in the affray, or afterwards
executed, and that 136 muskets, besides a number of pistols,
swords, and other weapons, were taken from the army of a day. It is
to be feared, however, that the gallows did more execution than the
bullets of the soldiery. Holt declares that many of the insurgents
who were arrested after the one-sided struggle at the Ponds were
brought before an impromptu court-martial, where it was arranged
that lots should be drawn from a hat and that every third man whose
name was drawn should be hanged. Many fine young men, he says, were
strung up like dogs, and it was only when the Governor arrived on
the scene that the butchery was stayed.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the suspicions entertained by the authorities
concerning Holt's connection with the uprising were all at fault.
Some of the prisoners had said that Holt was to lead them, they
having been doubtless so informed by the authors of the outbreak,
and Holt was called before the Governor to make his defence. His
Excellency evidently did not place much reliance in the story of
the accused, for after hearing his statement he dismissed him with
the words:&mdash;"Go home, sir, and take care of yourself, or I
will hang you!" He went home, but shortly afterwards the Governor
caused his removal to Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>As previously stated. Holt remained in exile for about fourteen
years, when he received a full pardon and returned to his native
land.</p>
<h2>WILLIAM HENRY BARBER, THE ATTORNEY-CONVICT.<br>
AN INNOCENT MAN TRANSPORTED FOR LIFE.</h2>
<p>One of the most remarkable cases to be found on the records
relates to a well-to-do English attorney and solicitor, named
William Henry Barber, who was transported for life for an offence
of which he was afterwards proved to be entirely innocent. The
story of his conviction, his sufferings on the voyage and at the
penal settlement of Norfolk Island to which he was sent, and of the
subsequent success of his efforts to establish his innocence, reads
like a romance. It is a long story, and I have experienced some
difficulty in arranging the events in proper chronological order,
but the reader will not require to stretch imagination to fill up
any gaps that may appear.</p>
<p>In the year 1843 a series of gigantic frauds in connection with
the estates of deceased persons were discovered in London, and a
criminal prosecution was instituted against Joshua Fletcher, who
was a retired surgeon and a man of property worth from &pound;10,000 to
&pound;20,000; William Henry Barber, an attorney and solicitor in
business; Mrs. Dorey, Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Sanders, parties who had
acted as personators in the cases. Another man, named Griffin was
originally indicted, but he was admitted as Queen's evidence, and
escaped punishment. The frauds had extended over four years, and
the charges brought against the accused were forging and uttering
three wills and a bond connected with letters of
administration.</p>
<p>The Crown proceeded with only two of these cases, and in each
one secured a conviction against the parties named, with the
exception of Barber, who was acquitted on the first, but convicted
on the second. The sentences passed upon the prisoners were as
follows:&mdash;Fletcher, transportation for life; Barber,
transportation for life; Sanders, transportation for seven years;
Mrs. Dorey, two years' imprisonment; Mrs. Sanders, two years'
imprisonment.</p>
<p>From the evidence elicited at the trial, it appeared that
Fletcher was acquainted with an officer in the Bank of England who,
for a consideration, supplied him with information concerning the
stock held for persons who had not claimed the dividends payable
thereon for a number of years. The law was that after the expiry of
ten years from the date of the payment of the last dividend if no
claim was made for payment the stock was invested with the
Commissioners for the National Debt, and became public money, and
this friendly official appears to have kept Fletcher posted
concerning the moneys which were likely to be thus handed over to
the Commissioners, and Fletcher, who forged wills and other
documents, would seek to obtain possession of the money. In several
cases he succeeded, but his frauds were at last discovered. The
case for connection with which Barber was convicted and
transported, may be gathered from a confession made by Sanders to
his solicitor, but which was not used, as the Crown refused to
accept him as Queen's evidence. This man said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It must have been about June, 1842, or perhaps a little later
in that year, I received a letter from Fletcher, informing me that
he had received intelligence from his friend at the Bank of England
of something very good and requesting me to see him as early as
possible. Accordingly, I proceeded to London and went to his house,
where he informed me his friend had given him the particulars of a
case which had not gone to the commissioners; that it stood in the
name of Ann Slack, Smith-street, Chelsea; that he, Fletcher, had
made a great many enquiries all about that neighbourhood, and could
find no trace whatever of any such person; that he had seen an old
postman who had delivered letters there a number of years, and had
given him money to gain all information he could, but had obtained
none whatever; as the sum was considerable he thought I might get
my wife to take the case in hand; I said I would endeavour to
prevail on her to do so. A short time after this Fletcher came to
Bristol; he said he came to make inquiries about the case of Slack,
and as I had informed him at our interview at his house there were
persons of the name in Bath, he thought to try there. I proceeded
there, but could not find one that answered the description given
by Fletcher. On my return Fletcher informed me that his information
was to the following effect:&mdash;Ann Slack appears to have had a
sister; at this time it was intended, if the right owner could be
discovered, that information should be given to the owner upon
receipt of a bonus, to be divided between me and Fletcher. While
these inquiries were in progress information reached Fletcher from
his friend at the Bank that the stock had been transferred to the
Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt; and after a
long consultation it was determined to try and obtain the money
from the Commissioners by means of personation. Fletcher told me
that it appeared Miss Ann Slack, in whose name the stock had stood,
was one of two sisters who had stock invested in the same account;
that there had been a power of attorney granted by the two sisters
to a Mr. Hulme, whom Fletcher had ascertained was a partner, but
who turns out to have been a clerk in the house of Jones, Loyd
&amp; Co.; that the sister had married a Captain Joseph Foskett,
who soon after his marriage had sold out; that Hulme had received
the dividends to 1832, about which period he appears to have died.
We therefore procured the Army List and found the name of Captain
Foskett; but there being no address given, he being on half pay,
Fletcher said he had a person in the Army Pay Office from whom he
could perhaps obtain Foskett's address. Fletcher returned to town,
and some short time afterwards writes to me, his friend at Somerset
House giving him the name of Captain Foskett's agent, from whom he
had been enabled to find that he resided at King's Langley, which
is on the line of the Birmingham Railway. I should have previously
mentioned that Fletcher had obtained with other information of his
friend at the Bank, on a small slip of paper, a facsimile of the
handwriting of Ann Slack, taken from the power of attorney granted
by her and her sister to Mr. Hulme. Fletcher and myself went to
Langley Station, and there on inquiry we found that Captain
Foskett's residence was not very far off. We got a railway
policeman to go into the village; by giving him a shilling to
spend, he might be enabled to meet with some person to give him
information required, viz., if Captain Foskett's wife had a sister,
and if so, her name and residence. Fletcher and I took tea prepared
for us at the railway station. Our messenger soon returned with the
intelligence that he had met with the coachman of Captain Foskett;
that he had taken him to a public house, and had partaken of some
beer with him, and from whom he learned that Mrs. Foskett had a
sister, who was living in the family, and was generally known to
them as Miss Nancy. With this information I returned with Fletcher
to town. We had no doubt but this lady was the person we had been
so long in pursuit of; the next difficulty now was, how to get an
introduction so as to be able to turn our knowledge of what the
lady was entitled to to the best account (for now that we had made
the discovery that she was living, all means of proceeding by
personation were given up). At length it was settled that Fletcher
should apply through Barber, for that purpose, and with this
understanding I left London. Fletcher came again to Bristol and
told me the result of Barber's inquiries, and also that it was
Barber's opinion that it did not relate to her, but to some other
Ann Slack. Fletcher said there could now be no obstacle in the way
of my wife taking the case in hand. Fletcher then produced some
paper without water-mark, and I wrote a will of Ann Slack, from a
copy produced by Fletcher; and before Fletcher left Bristol, which
he did in about a week after, he took an advertisement to Verriers,
the news-vendor, in High-street, to be inserted in the Bath and
<i>Cheltenham Gazette,</i> a copy of which paper I forwarded to
Fletcher, by his desire, in London; and, as agreed on, my wife took
lodgings in Westgate-buildings, Bath, where she answered the
advertisement by letter, from a copy given to her by Fletcher as
Jane Slack. Barber returned an answer that he should be glad to
conduct her business, as it was probable that he could be of
assistance to her. My wife proceeded to London, saying she was
about to pay a visit to her sister. On Mrs. Sander's arrival in
town she took up her residence with her sister, Fletcher of course
calling to see her. Fletcher went to the General Register Office in
Somerset House, and discovered that there had been a mistake in the
register which I caused to be made in Bath, for the name appeared
to have been Stack instead of Slack. Fletcher stated to me that he
saw the Registrar-General, who informed him of the error, and
advised its correction, for which purpose Mrs. Dorey and my wife
went to Bath, had an interview with the Registrar and
Superintendent, who would not alter the register unless they saw
the person who had made the entry, I then received a letter from
Fletcher, stating the error, and requesting to see me in town,
where I immediately proceeded and met Fletcher by appointment on
Waterloo Bridge, where we talked the subject over, he wishing me to
go to Bath and have it put right, I refused to do so, and said I
would rather abandon all further proceedings. It was at length
arranged that we should take fresh proceedings by a fresh register,
which was settled should be either in Chelsea or Pimlico. Fletcher
and myself went to Pimlico, and after some research fixed on the
place, and I was to make the registry, which I did, after calling
several times at the Registrar's, he being from home; it was nearly
ten o'clock at night before I could get, as I was anxious to return
to Bristol, and wished it to be done that night. Fletcher
afterwards called at the Registrar's and procured a certificate of
the registry of Ann Slack's death as registered by me. Mrs. Dorey
took lodgings for my wife. She disguised herself with a
light-colored ringlet front, covering the greater part of her face,
a close bonnet, spectacles and a veil&mdash;a disguise which she
always wore when she went to Barber's office, Doctor's Commons, or
the Bank. The fictitious will which was first made having devised
the stock to Jane Slack, of Bath, it now became necessary that a
fresh will should be prepared, and it was intended to apply to me
for that purpose; but after the discovery of the error in the
register at Bath and the abandonment of the proceedings there, I
wrote a letter to Barber and Bircham (attorneys in partnership) on
the part of Jane Slack, stating that Jane Slack did not think the
Ann Slack, as advertised, had reference to her, and that I was
instructed to say that she had consulted her solicitor, and
therefore declined calling on them, or taking any further
proceedings in the matter, to which letter I attached a feigned
name. In consequence of that letter, Fletcher would not allow me to
write the new fictitious will, fearing that Barber should discover
a similarity in the writing; he therefore wished my wife would get
Mrs. Dorey to write the will, which she did. Mrs. Dorey frequently
called to see her at her lodgings, generally in the evening;
Fletcher also frequently calling, but no other person visited
her."</p>
<p>Up to this point Barber had not been brought into the affair,
but the time had now arrived for him to innocently perform a task
which resulted in his being convicted with Fletcher and his willing
tools. The sum in the bank which was thus being villainously
subverted amounted to &pound;3,500, and Fletcher having gone to Barber
and informed him that he had succeeded after long search in
discovering the owner, at the same time requesting him to act in
having the will proved, the latter signified his willingness. Mrs.
Sanders was introduced by Fletcher, who brought forward the forged
will, and exhibited it to Barber. A copy of the will was made by
one of the clerks in the office, and when that was done Barber went
with Mrs. Sanders, who was in deep mourning, and appeared a very
respectable personage, to his proctor. The will was then proved in
the usual way, not a doubt appearing to cross the minds of any of
those through whose hands the document had to pass. After about the
usual time for proving the will, the probate was forwarded to
Barber, and lodged in the Bank of England, where the usual time
taken in case of unclaimed dividends elapsed&mdash;about a
fortnight&mdash;during which the Bank scrutinized the documents and
examined into the claim; after which they notified that they were
perfectly satisfied, and the claimant was at liberty to deal with
the stock whenever she thought proper. Barber then handed the
documents over to Mrs. Sanders, who went to the Bank and drew out
the whole of the money. Sanders, in his confession, narrates
succinctly the subsequent proceedings. He says;&mdash;"My wife
returned to her lodgings in Francis-street, Tottenham Court Road,
after getting the money at the Bank, where she procured some
refreshment for Fletcher, he being, he said, quite fatigued from
long anxiety and fasting throughout the day; after he finished his
repast, my wife divided the money in the same manner in which it
had been divided in Hunt's case. In the course of October or
November last, (many months after the division of the spoils) my
wife received two letters from Fletcher, giving me to understand
that inquiries were going on in the Bank about this affair; this
information he procured from his friend, Mr. Christmas, the clerk
in the Bank of England. The first time I saw any account of what
took place in the Mansion House was a very short paragraph in the
Bristol Mercury. I read it to my wife, who became very much
affected, and at last become so ill that I feared her life to be in
danger. After the case of Mary Hunt came out before the
magistrates, Mr. and Mrs. Dorey visited me in Bristol and persuaded
me to go forward and make a full confession of all I knew."</p>
<p>The money obtained from the Bank by means of the forged
documents amounted to between &pound;3,000 and &pound;4,000, and in another
statement of Sanders', in which he gives the history of the
concoction of the fraud, the money was shewn to have been thus
distributed:&mdash;"The amount appearing as Barber's charges did
not exceed &pound;23, and Sanders thinks that included the proctor's
charges; then Sanders paid the broker and proceeded to get the
notes which he had received from him changed into gold; and then he
took a cab, and went to Miss Richard's lodging in Dean-street,
Soho, where, in the course of the evening, Fletcher came,
accompanied by his daughter. After tea Fletcher and Sanders
adjourned into another room, where, after deducting for charges
each party had incurred, Fletcher took &pound;5 per cent, on the gross
amount for his friend in the Bank of England, and Sanders took &pound;20
which he afterwards gave to Miss Hawks for her trouble, and all
other claims being taken, Fletcher and Sanders equally divided the
remaining two portions, Fletcher taking one, and Sanders the other,
and they divided about &pound;1,200 between them."</p>
<p>How the forgeries came to be discovered is not revealed in the
papers before me, but it was doubtless through the proper person
putting in her claim to the money. The Bank authorities appeared to
have acted with remarkable looseness as custodians of the moneys
which had been entrusted to them. It was proved that they had years
previously paid the dividends in Miss Slack's case to Mr. Hulme, to
whom she had given a power of attorney; but, although they had this
power of attorney in their possession, bearing the signature of
Miss Slack, they did not compare that signature with the signature
on the will produced by Mrs. Sanders, in which case they would have
been able at once to detect the forgery. Further than this, there
were two amounts invested in the same name&mdash;one of &pound;3,500 and
the other of &pound;6,600&mdash;and although only the lesser sum was
mentioned in the will and claimed by Mrs. Sanders (it appears that
Fletcher was under the impression that the larger sum belonged to a
second Miss Slack) their suspicion was not aroused; yet they
actually must have known at the time that the owner of the stock
was entitled to &pound;10,000, as was proved by their marking "dead"
opposite the entries in the Bank books when acting upon the
probate. As Barber very tersely put it before the Select Committee
of the House of Commons many years afterwards, "notwithstanding
they had so seen that the owner was possessed of &pound;10,000, and they
saw that the property had been sworn under &pound;5,000 and although they
saw by the will that the &pound;3,500 was the only sum mentioned in the
will, and that the other sum of &pound;6,600 had apparently been
forgotten, yet the Bank expressed themselves satisfied with the
claim, and paid over the &pound;3,500, leaving the &pound;6,600 in their own
hands." It was not until some time after that the Bank authorities
opened their eyes to the fact that there was anything strange in
the pretended legatee of Ann Slack, entitled under will to all her
property, claiming only the &pound;3,500 standing in the books of the
Bank, when she should have asked for &pound;6,600 more. And this
looseness appears all the more strange when it is considered that
in the case of the Hunt forgeries, they did at first refuse to pay
the money, as they suspected the genuineness of the claim; but here
the audacity of Fletcher was brought into full play. He actually
filed a Bill in Chancery for the false claimant, and the
affidavits, which were all concocted fraudulently, were referred to
the Attorney-General of the day (afterwards Lord Campbell), and the
Attorney-General was perfectly satisfied with the affidavits so
concocted, and consented to the money being paid to the claimant,
the Court of Chancery making an order upon the Bank to pay the
amount, which was paid accordingly.</p>
<p>When the forgeries were discovered in Ann Slack's case, however,
the Bank set vigorously to work to discover the perpetrators, and
they were, no doubt, ably assisted by Mr. Christmas, whose
assistance to Fletcher had proved so valuable. It is only on this
hypothesis that the subsequent action of the authorities with
regard to their clerk can be understood. The Bank denied that he
was an accomplice, and put him forward as a credible witness at the
trial, and one not to be suspected, although he was compelled to
admit that he received from Fletcher several hundred pounds for
information he had supplied, and without which information it would
have been impossible for Fletcher to operate so successfully upon
the stock invested.</p>
<p>Fletcher and Barber were arrested, the former being charged with
forging wills and a bond, and the latter with uttering them in
connection with letters of administration. Mrs. Dorey and the man
Griffin, (whose connection with the affair is not clearly shewn in
the only papers available to me) were also arrested. Mr. and Mrs.
Sanders sought to keep out of the way until the others were tried,
but although they managed to elude the officers of justice for two
months, they were eventually captured, and the whole of the parties
named were brought to trial. Griffin, as already stated, preserved
his liberty by turning Queen's evidence; but the others were
convicted and sentenced, as already recorded.</p>
<p>Concerning Fletcher's guilt there could not be the shadow of a
doubt, but the conviction of Barber may be cited as one of the
grossest cases of miscarriage of justice that has ever taken place.
British indignation against the real perpetrators of the wrong was
so intense that British vision was warped, and those concerned in
administering British justice could not recognize the difference
between a skilful, designing knave and the innocent attorney whom
he had employed to carry out his nefarious designs. To make matters
worse for poor Barber, his partner in business, who could have
given valuable evidence to prove that Barber's actions were
bona-fide throughout, suddenly disappeared, and could not be found
to be brought as a witness, he having been frightened beyond
measure for his own safety, thinking that he might he brought into
trouble with his partner if he did not hide. The Crown also treated
him unfairly. There were four indictments preferred against him,
but those relating to two of the cases of fraud were not brought
forward, although he pleaded hard to have them proceeded with,
asserting that if those cases were investigated they would throw
great light upon the case upon which he was convicted. He also
pleaded hard to be tried apart from Fletcher, but this request was
also disregarded; the shadow of Fletcher's criminality rested upon
him and he was condemned to share Fletcher's punishment.</p>
<p>As to what followed the conviction I will allow Barber to tell
in his own words. Here is his unvarnished tale:&mdash;</p>
<p>"After the trial (1844) I remained about a week at Newgate. I
was then sent to Millbank; I was chained by the leg to a
doubly-convicted felon, and in that state I was sent to Millbank.
On my arrival there I was kept in a solitary cell for two months.
At the end of that time I was removed on board a convict ship, and
I was passed down by a boat from Millbank to Woolwich; there I was
handcuffed and chained to half a dozen other men, and in that
condition I was taken on board the convict ship at Woolwich. After
a day or two the chains were taken off; then, after another day or
two they were put on again, and after about six days lying at
Woolwich the voyage commenced. We went a considerable distance out
to sea chained by the leg, and keeping on those chains night and
day my leg became excoriated by the pressure on the ankles; and
from the awkwardness of getting into the hammock with those chains
on, they hurt me at that time very much. The voyage lasted about
four months. I do not say that I was treated with unusual severity
on the voyage; I suffered severely, but not more than could be
avoided; I had to clean the deck and to do many duties which were
not very pleasant, but I had nothing to complain of on the part of
the officers on board. The chains did not remain on during the
whole of the voyage, but were taken off the whole of the convicts
after we got well out to sea&mdash;I think after the fourth day.
There was a guard of 50 men on board. I was treated precisely as
the other convicts were. There were 200 convicts on board. I slept
in the same place with them; we were divided into messes, according
as we happened to go down into the hold; as we happened to go down
we were chalked on the back and divided into messes of eight, and
those eight men formed one mess, sitting round a sort of table for
the rest of the voyage. At the termination of the voyage we were
landed at Norfolk Island. On my being landed upon the Island, I was
put into a barrack where there were 220 other prisoners, and in
consequence of the great heat of the climate, and the sudden change
in the diet, I, with about 50 others of the ship's company, was
invalided. We had to be examined by the medical officer, and the
medical officer ordered myself and others not to go to work for
that day; we were desired to go into what was called the lumber
yard, and Major Childs, the Commandant (that was my first interview
with him), on his coming down to the station, inquired about the
men who had arrived by our ship, the 'Agincourt,' and on hearing
that there were a great many who had not gone to work, he desired
to see them, and as he stood by the principal office near the
gateway of the barrack yard, about 40 or 50 of us had to pass by
him in single file. About ten of the men had passed by him
unnoticed. When I came up, I of course lifted my cap off my head
respectfully to him, and he immediately said, 'Let this man's hair
be cut.' Now, my hair had been cut the very day before, as all the
men's had when they arrived on the island. Then he asked 'How is it
that you have not gone to work? I said 'I was ordered not to go to
work, sir.' 'Hold your tongue, sir; go in, sir (there was a gateway
standing open, and he had a cane in his hand); I will see to you,
Mister Barber&mdash;I will see after you.' I mention this in order
to show, from my first arrival in Norfolk Island, the kind of
feeling which was uniformly shewn towards me by the Commandant.
Applications were made on behalf of other convicts of the better
educated class for appointments as clerks, or their services to be
employed as clerks. I was so applied for by persons who would have
taken me as clerk. Lieutenant Lloyd was on board the ship I went
out in and had seen me throughout the voyage; I had been of use on
board&mdash;in fact, I had prevented a mutiny on board, and the
surgeon-superintendent reported very favourably of me. I merely
mention that to shew that I arrived on the island with very
favourable testimony, but, notwithstanding that, I was treated in
the peculiar way I was. I was applied for by Lieutenant Lloyd as
clerk, and immediately afterwards by two other gentlemen; but the
applications were in every instance refused by the Commandant. The
authority I have for stating that is this&mdash;the gentlemen who
had applied for me reported it to me. 'I have applied for you,
Barber, but the Commandant will not allow it.' Mr.
Commissary-General Smith applied for me as clerk and also as hut
keeper, but that also was refused, and then he applied for me to
perform the duties of a bag-mender at his own place, which was
refused. In the Commissariat department they have a great many
sacks or bags which were always requiring repairs, and great many
men are employed in mending them, and he applied that I should be
appointed a bag-mender, which was refused. Mr. Rogers, the
chaplain, and a magistrate of the island, applied for me to be his
servant, but that was refused, and another man who came out in the
ship with me, and who had been doubly convicted, was allowed to be
his servant. The duty of a servant to a gentleman is to clean his
house, black his boots, clean his knives, cook his provisions, and
wash for him, for there were very few female servants on the island
at that time; and all the duties which are required of a servant
would have been an immense relief to me, when contrasted to the
duty which was assigned to me. I was ordered to be a wardsman.
There are three stations on Norfolk Island&mdash;one called 'The
Settlement,' another called the 'Cascades,' and another called
'Longridge; they are equidistant, about three miles; in the
Settlement is a barrack, which will receive about 200 inmates. The
prisoners are locked in that dormitory from about dusk at night
until daylight in the morning; there is no outlet whatever, and
therefore for their occasions, tubs are placed in the avenues
between the tiers of sleeping berths, for their use; the duty of a
wardsman is to keep these men in order at night, to prevent battles
taking place between them if he can, and other misconduct; and if
it take place he is held responsible for it; it is considered that
he ought to have prevented it, so that he is placed in peculiar
jeopardy; if he allow it to take place he may be punished by being
flogged; if he interfere he may very likely be killed (which often
took place), or have an eye knocked out, or suffer some other
personal violence from the savages (for they are no less) who are
located there: many are murderers, many are there for unnatural
crimes, and a great many for burglaries, and other offences of the
deepest dye. They were some of the very worst of the Norfolk
Islanders; some who had been transported for murder and
manslaughter, and heavy crimes from England, and some
colonially-convicted men&mdash;men who had committed new crimes
after their sentences and after their arrival in the colony. I had
to keep watch and ward all night entirely by myself. In the morning
my duty was to take those tubs which were on the first floor, as it
might be called, down stairs through the barrack yard, before all
the men, and before several of the prisoners who had come out in
the ship with me, who were comfortably dressed, perfectly clean,
having nothing whatever to do but just to marshal the men and write
in the office. I had to take those tubs down before the officers
and prison clerks, who stood at the door, and I, almost naked,
passed to and fro and take them down to the sea, empty them there,
thoroughly clean them out, take them back, and then I had to scour
the ward on my hands and knees, arrange all the hammocks of the
men, and if all that was not done to their satisfaction, I was
liable, and very frequently did receive violent abuse and threats
for not having adjusted a man's hammock just according to his
taste, or I had not dealt with the tubs as he fancied they ought to
be dealt with. I do not qualify the expression with regard to
murderers; there were a great number of murderers on the island. It
seems rather an anomaly, but some of the most dreadful murders I
ever heard of had been committed by men in Norfolk Island. The men
had been convicted of either murder or manslaughter, and their
sentences had been commuted. Sometimes a man had only got off upon
a point of law. I may perhaps mention one case, that of Augustus
Dalmas, who cut the throat of a lady he was courting; he was
convicted, and sentenced to death, but after his sentence it was
pretended by his friends that he was insane at the time the crime
was committed. I was the sole attendant over these men, and
remained in charge of the 220, having to wait upon them as well as
prevent crimes. I had to make the hammocks and clean the rooms for
these 220 men without any assistance whatever. I believe there had
been an inquiry in the case of Augustus Dalmas, and there was a
medical report that he was not insane, but there was a further
report made by some officials, which resulted in the sentence being
commuted to transportation for life; and Augustus Dalmas, after he
came on the island, was indulged and petted, and placed in a
position of exceeding luxury in comparison with mine. After I had
done my work in the course of the day I was able to get a little
sleep; perhaps my work began at 5 in the morning, and perhaps I
could get through all the cleaning and preparing for the men
against the evening, by two or three o'clock in the day; then
between that and five and six o'clock in the evening I got some
sleep; that was all the sleep I could get. This went on for twelve
months and rather more&mdash;not always in the same ward, but
sometimes at Longridge, and sometimes at the other station, the
Cascades. I was sixteen months in the wards, and four months at
field labour, except when I was carried to the hospital, which I
frequently was, in consequence of the foul nature of the work,
which affected my health so much. I daresay I may have been in the
hospital altogether six or seven weeks at different times. The work
I had to do in the fields was to break up the ground with a very
heavy hoe; each man in a gang had the same task. The gang I was
placed in was the heavy gang, in which the strongest men were
placed, and each man had to do a specified quantity. I had to do
the same as very strong and powerful men. I was frequently in a
broiling sun, and at other times during a tropical rain. I was
exposed to these altenations in the course of one day; I would
sometimes be as wet as if I had come through a river, and in an
hour after that I would be dried up to a cinder. I was not chained
at work&mdash;the men were not chained on the island unless they
committed some offence upon it, which of course I never did. I had
an overseer named Lane, who had been twice convicted; his business
was to do nothing but see that we worked; he did nothing else all
the time he was on the island; he was well known to be a most cruel
man, and inasmuch as the Commandant was known to have what was
called a down upon me, all the subordinate officers under whom I
came treated me accordingly; they had their cue, and when I was at
field work in a gang they had an eye upon me; if I stood up for a
moment to relieve myself, he immediately called out 'no straight
backs;' if we did not go on with the work to the overseer's
satisfaction we were liable to be flogged. I was at field labour
about four months. Fletcher was not put to the same labour&mdash;on
the contrary, he was employed as medical dispenser; when I was ill
he had to make up and serve me with the medicine, although it was
well known there was the greatest hostility between us, and we
never spoke. He was medical dispenser on the Cascade station, and
had a hut to himself, with superior bedding and rations; and what
was a most important thing, he had a separate sleeping apartment at
the time when I had every morning to empty 40 tubs, and to clean
out every one of those tubs. Upon one occasion when leaving the
hospital, being barely convalescent, I had been ordered by Dr.
Graham to stone-breaking, as a task less severe and unwholesome
than my ordinary employment; I was sitting by the roadside breaking
stones, and Major Childs came up to me and said 'What do you do
here?' I said 'Sir, I am ordered by the medical superintendent to
break stones.' He said 'I will not have that,' and went up to the
station and gave his orders that I should immediately go back to
the ward. He came in and said 'What is your objection to cleaning
the ward?' I said 'I have made no objection; it is destroying my
health, but I have made no objection; I do it, I get ill, I go to
the hospital and come back again; I have made no objection.' He
said 'How does it injure your health?' I observed that it was the
most loathsome and disgusting thing that could possibly be, and
even harder work would be cheerfully performed in place of a task
so nauseous and humiliating. He laughed and asked, 'How does it
injure your health?' I said 'Independent of the exhalations, from
the commencement I have got wet feet every morning, from going out
in the heavy dew.' He said 'Then put your shoes on.' I said, 'That
is of no use; they soon get filled with water.' 'Then take them
off!' and with that he made a loud laugh and strode away. On
another occasion I was at Cascades under Lieutenant Butler, the
superintendent of the station, and on going there he applied for me
to fill the office and perform the duties of chapel clerk and
schoolmaster, there being one or two such persons at all the
stations, who had nothing else to do but that. Lieutenant Butler
informed me he had applied, that Major Childs had refused, and that
he assigned as a reason 'that Barber was a public character, who
had been talked of in the newspapers.' Lieutenant Butler pointed
out to him (as he told me) that my conduct had been
unexceptionable, that I should be very useful, and that there were
many persons employed in the island in that way; but it was all of
no avail, the Major ordered me back to Longridge station.</p>
<p>"On my mentioning that circumstance to the magistrate at
Cascades, and the chaplain of the station, Mr. Rogers, he said
'They will kill you, Barber, if you go back to Longridge.' I said
'I hope not.' He replied, 'Your life ought not to be wantonly
exposed in that way.' I should perhaps explain that there had been
a murder of unusual atrocity committed on the island; there was
great difficulty in obtaining light sufficient to show who had been
the perpetrators of that offence; some facts had come under my own
observation, while I was a wardsman, which appeared to me to be
material to a certain extent, but not at all conclusive; I heard
from time to time the progress that was made in the inquiry, and
finding that the prosecution of it was likely to be given up from
the want of evidence, I then communicated to Mr. Naylor, the senior
magistrate of the island (who was engaged with the Attorney-general
of Van Diemen's Land in investigating the matter) the facts which I
have referred to, requesting, unless it were absolutely necessary
for the ends of justice, that I should not be called upon to give
evidence; but some time afterwards Mr. Naylor came to me and said,
'Well, Barber, the facts you communicated to me some time ago I
find will be important. I am not going to ask you whether you will
attend as a witness; it is my duty to instruct you to do so; you
will be sent for when the trial comes on, and you must come up to
Government House,' which was the residence of Major Childs at this
time. Accordingly I was directed to meet the Attorney-General of
Van Diemen's Land; the trial took place; I was called as a witness,
and the parties were convicted and executed. Now the offence which
had been committed, though most men in the island regarded murder
with a certain amount of terror, was supposed to be extenuated, as
the murder had been committed on a man who had interfered with the
prisoners in sheep-stealing, a thing which the prisoners, or a
great many, sympathised with, because they said they were deprived
of their allotted rations, which was the fact&mdash;the rations
which were stated to be due to them they did not get, and those men
therefore thought it was only fair retaliation if they could get a
sheep, and cut it up and divide it amongst them. The policeman on
duty had interfered with these men, and they murdered him under
circumstances of great brutality. In consequence of the conviction
of those men, who were executed, their immediate friends were
vindictive, and threatened the lives of the witnesses. I,
therefore, under the advice of Mr. Rogers, drew up a representation
to Major Childs of the fact that I was a marked man among the
friends of the two persons who had been hanged, and as a great many
of their most intimate associates were at Longridge, I considered
my life would be in danger if I was sent there. But notwithstanding
that representation I was sent there. To show that the idea of
danger was not a mere chimera, I may state that one of the
witnesses was murdered, and two of them were most violently
assaulted and ill-treated. One of the witnesses was taken special
care of by Major Childs, lest he should be hurt; he was employed in
the garden of his private residence, slept on the premises, and was
taken the greatest possible care of. The result of Lieutenant
Butler's application for me as chaplain's clerk and school-master
was, that I was sent to Longridge station, and placed in the heavy
gang, to work under the cruel overseer, Lane. From the beginning
Fletcher was exempted from the severe treatment to which I was
subjected: he was employed nearly the whole of the time as medical
dispenser. For a very short time, I think, he went out as overseer
of what is called the light gang; he never was in the heavy gang at
all. For nine-tenths of the time he was there he was medical
dispenser. He was between 50 and 60 years of age, but a very
strong, hearty man. The result of my being sent back by Major
Childs to the ward from breaking stones was that I became ill again
in two or three days, and had to go back to the hospital. Finding I
had been sent back to the ward, on his arrival at the station next
day, Dr. Graham entered in the visitor's book a most indignant
protest against it, stating that he would not answer for my life
(or some words to that effect) if that treatment was persisted in.
Nevertheless, I had to continue in the ward until sent back to the
hospital. There was an end of this, however, before I left. At the
end of sixteen months I was put into an office in the agricultural
department. It occurred in this way: I was in hospital; Major
Childs was passing, and the chaplain said to him 'There is Barber
in hospital again.' 'Oh,' said the Major, 'He is always in
hospital,' 'He will not be in much longer,' replied Mr. Rogers;
'you will find he will be in the grave; and I will tell you who I
shall hold responsible for it.' The governor seemed rather alarmed
at that, and the interview resulted in my being removed to
Cascades, which was considered a more healthy part of the island.
After a week I got considerably better, and then I was employed to
clean the wards there. I continued there until Lieutenant Butler
applied for me as clerk and schoolmaster, and I was then sent back
to Longridge. I was subsequently taken out of the fields to go into
the office of the superintendent of agriculture, on this account:
The duties were considered very difficult and important; there were
statistical papers and financial statements to be prepared for the
government, and things of that kind; the person who had done that
had been removed from the island; they were in considerable
difficulty to know who they could get to do it, and at last Major
Childs considered that I should do it. I employed part of my time
in endeavouring to get proofs of my innocence, and that came to the
knowledge of Major Childs, who immediately ordered the constable of
the island to come and seize all my papers. The papers were taken
and kept from me, and were not returned during all the time I was
on the island; it was only when I received my conditional pardon,
and I arrived at Hobart Town, I went and applied for them to the
Colonial Secretary. I was forbidden the use of writing materials.
After my labour in the field I went to the school, and spent about
three hours in teaching the men; whilst I was there, when I took up
my pen and was about to explain some diagram, the master of the
school came up and said 'You must not have a pen, Barber,' that was
the first intimation I had that I was not to be allowed the use of
writing materials. I said 'What is the meaning of this? I am merely
sketching out a diagram for the use of the men in my class.'
'Well,' he said, 'you are not to be allowed writing materials;' and
I ascertained a strict order had been given, that if writing
materials were found in my possession, they were to be taken away.
I had been allowed the use of writing materials until Major Childs
found out I was collecting proofs of my innocence. I had made
representations for the Home Government, and wrote letters to Sir
Robert Peel and other members of Parliament. Mr. Naylor, the
chaplain of the island, also wrote letters on my behalf, but they
did not reach their destination, being suppressed, I presume, by
the Comptroller-general at Hobart Town. I addressed many letters to
public men in England&mdash;several to Lord Brougham, whom I had
the honour of knowing and acting in concert with in matters of
education, and to members of Parliament and other persons of
distinction and influence, entreating them to inquire into my case;
but I do not know of any of the letters written by me or for me
having ever reached their destination. I was at Norfolk Island two
years and four months altogether, and when the order came to remove
the whole of what they called the new prisoners sent from England
to Van Diemen's Land, I was sent with them in the 'Pestonjee
Bomanjee,' of which Dr. Browning had charge as medical
superintendent. I was landed at a small bay in Van Diemen's Land,
called Impression Bay, and after I had been there two days, the
superintendent of the station intimated to me that a conditional
pardon had been received for me. On leaving Norfolk Island I
received a certificate from the civil commandant who had succeeded
Major Childs that I had committed no offence; no charge of
insubordination or of improper conduct had ever been brought
against me there. Major Childs had left the island about seven
months before this; he was dismissed by Sir Eardley Wilmot,
Governor of Van Diemen's Land, and Mr. John Price succeeded him. I
had no complaint whatever to make concerning Mr. Price's treatment;
I had only to complain of Major Childs and those who acted under
his directions, who tormented me in every way, I believe, because
they thought it would be agreeable to Major Childs. All the letters
which I complain were stopped were forwarded through the regular
channels. On receiving information that a conditional pardon had
arrived at Hobart Town, I was told 'You are now at liberty.' The
superintendent of the station said, 'You must give in your prison
clothing.' I said 'What clothes am I to travel in? Are no
instructions given by the government as to my getting away? I have
not a single article of clothing.' He said, 'There are no orders
about that; you will have to give in your prison clothing; there
are no orders about other clothing.' 'How am I to travel? I cannot
leave without some clothes?' I was obliged to beg amongst the
prisoners, and one or two free persons who were on the island, for
little articles of clothing, and the superintendent gave me one or
two articles of old clothing. I got covered in the best way I
could; it was rather a motley attire; I then got to Hobart Town,
and I first went and applied for the conditional pardon which was
delivered to me. On my arrival there I also applied for the papers
that had been taken from me at Norfolk Island, and then certain
papers were returned to me; but many papers of considerable
importance were not amongst them. I inquired with reference to some
letters that had not been sent, and after some delay, and a good
deal of demur, it was admitted that there were letters in the
office, and they were ultimately handed over to me. I put the
question in this way, whether a letter which had been received at
the office at Norfolk Island had been forwarded to Hobart Town, and
if so, whether it had been transmitted to England? If not, whether
it would be delivered up to me? And after a delay of some days it
was delivered up to me, and I have it now. The seal was broken,
however. I was, of course, entirely destitute at Hobart Town; I did
not know a person in the place, except one or two who had known me
at Norfolk Island. One happened to be the chaplain to the
magistrate (Mr. Rogers), who had been in the island. He shewed me
great kindness; and I introduced myself to the Lieutenant-Governor
(Sir William Denison), who had succeeded Sir Eardley Wilmot; he
headed a subscription at Hobart Town, and by that means I got to
Sydney. I there introduced myself to the Chief Justice, and other
principal persons of the place; stated my case; an inquiry was
instituted by the judges and lawyers of Sydney; they had before
them all the evidence upon which I was tried, every word of it: and
the confessions which had been made since, and the report of the
examinations of Fletcher, which had taken place at Norfolk Island
and elsewhere, and that resulted in a report quite favourable to
me, and stating that it was beyond a doubt that if I had had a
separate trial I must have been acquitted. That report was
published by the Secretary of the Law Society of Sydney. After that
report was published, there was a subscription entered into in
Sydney, which enabled me to proceed on my way home-ward. I had only
a conditional pardon, and therefore I could not take a ship that
was coming to England, and I could not find any ship that would
undertake to land me at Boulogne, as they would lose the insurance;
so that I was obliged to take a very circuitous route to go to
France; I got a passage in a ship to Hong Kong, and from thence I
got a passage in a ship to Madras. At Madras I availed myself of
letters of introduction I had from the first people in Sydney to
the judge and the military secretary to the governor there, Colonel
Browne. Colonel Browne kindly received me in his house and I stayed
with him during the time I have mentioned, about a month. During
that time a subscription was made for me, and I was able to pursue
my voyage homewards. I came overland, and at length got to Paris.
On arriving in Paris I introduced myself to Lord Normanby, and
after the lapse of a few weeks his Lordship sent for me; said he
had read my papers, and added, that he had had a good deal of
experience of the criminal law as Secretary of State in England,
and as Secretary for Ireland, but he had never met with a case
which he thought so remarkable or so hard as mine: and he said he
would certainly communicate with the Home Government with regard to
it. His Lordship kept his word. As soon as the session was over, he
managed to secure the attention of the Government to my case, and
in November, 1848, while I was in Paris, I received a free pardon.
I then came straight home. At the time Lord Normanby was in
communication with Sir George Grey, I made an application to the
Home Secretary for a free pardon, and it was granted on the facts
which had transpired since the trial. Those facts were the
confessions which had been made, chiefly by Fletcher; but there
were also important confessions made by Sanders, who was his
principal confederate. I was not on good terms with Fletcher while
on Norfolk Island; on the contrary, from the moment that Fletcher
had concluded his examination at the Mansion House, when I was
first apprehended, and I saw his guilt, up to the present time, I
have never spoken to him, except in the presence of officers when
under examination. I did not, directly or indirectly either by
myself or anybody else, endeavour to induce Fletcher to make any
confession or statement in my favour; I always held myself entirely
aloof from him."</p>
<p>This is the story which Barber narrated before the Select
Committee of the House of Commons appointed to report upon the
petition which he had sent in praying for redress; and in every
particular his testimony was corroborated by official records or
the sworn evidence of others, even the vindictive and cruel Major
Childs, who was in England at the time, being compelled reluctantly
to support Barber's story, although he coolly denied that he had
subjected the convict to unduly harsh treatment while under his
control on the island.</p>
<p>Immediately on his return to England Barber applied for his
professional certificate, with the view of resuming the practice of
his profession, but his application was opposed by the Incorporated
Law Society, who contended that the granting of a free pardon did
not necessarily establish innocence, as it was simply "an act of
grace and mercy." Barber was, in fact, called upon to prove his
innocence, and as the judges required certain explanations on a
variety of points which he was not then in a position to give, the
opposition succeeded and the judges refused to grant his
certificate. Five years elapsed, and Barber still remained outside
the pale of the profession from which he had been so unjustly cast,
although sufficient proof of his innocence had been furnished the
higher authorities to induce them to extend to him "an act of grace
and mercy," when a most fortunate discovery was made. The written
narrative which Sanders had supplied to his solicitor at the time
of the first trial was unearthed. When the judges refused Barber's
application, stating the certain matters upon which they required
fuller information, several prominent gentlemen, moved by a common
impulse of humanity, and believing thoroughly in Barber's
innocence, formed themselves into a committee to assist him in
prosecuting his object, and they hit upon the idea that the
solicitor who had been engaged in the defence of Sanders might be
the means of affording them information. That gentleman was dead,
however, and his successor, a Mr. Crosby, was appealed to, to know
if there were any papers connected with Sanders' case among the
documents in the office. A mass of papers was examined, and among
the papers were found the confession made by Sanders under the
heading of "Instructions for my solicitor," and which I have
already given. In this confession, it will be remembered, Sanders
fully explained how Barber had been paid to take out letters of
administration in the case of Ann Slack, without any suspicion that
the will presented to him was forged. Mr. Crosby made an affidavit
of the circumstances under which the papers had been found, and
stated also that he had had frequent conversations with Sander's
solicitor, who always said "Poor Barber was quite innocent, I am
sure." These papers were at once brought before the court of
Queen's Bench, and the judges allowed Barber to have his
certificate. This was in 1853, five years after Barber's return
from Australia, and nine years after his conviction and sentence of
transportation, but it was not until 1855 that the certificate
actually came into his possession. Upon his conviction as a felon,
Barber had forfeited all his property, and not having a shilling of
his own when he returned, he was obliged to throw himself upon the
consideration of benevolent persons who had faith in his innocence,
and who cheerfully sent him subscriptions. His former partner,
Bircham, proved as dishonest as he was heartless, for he could
never be induced to render an account of the moneys collected by
him in connection with the partnership, and never paid to his
partner one penny of the amount which should have come to him. When
Barber resumed practice as a solicitor he found that,
notwithstanding the complete vindication of his innocence, his
former trial and conviction proved a bar to successful business. On
one occassion his clerk had to attend before a judge in Chambers,
and although he succeeded in the application he made, the opposing
attorney in the case, angry at being defeated, threw into the teeth
of the clerk that "the defendant was represented by a convicted
felon." On another occasion a party had come to his office
intending to make a loan of money on mortgage, and he was to have
prepared the securities; but on his name being mentioned by the
borrower to a friend, he exclaimed "Good God, that is the returned
convict, Barber," and he was not allowed to do the business. The
client said "It is very true Mr. Barber was convicted and has
returned," and he explained the circumstances, but the man of money
said, "I have not time to go into that; upon my life I will not
have my papers prepared by such a person; it is very fortunate if
the fact be so, but I will not have anything to do with him."</p>
<p>After struggling for some time against the evils which had been
inflicted upon him in the name of justice, Barber petitioned the
Parliament of England in April, 1857, and as previously intimated a
Select Committee was appointed to inquire into the allegations
contained in that petition, and to consider and report "whether any
and what steps should be taken in reference thereto." That
Committee met in June, 1858, and after hearing the evidence of
Barber, Major Childs, Rev. T. G. Rogers, and Commissary-General J.
W. Smith, and having placed before them all the documents referring
to the case, they reported as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Your Committee have inquired carefully into the allegations of
the petition, and find them to have been substantially proved.</p>
<p>"Your Committee have not entered upon the consideration of the
question whether, in the present or like cases, pecuniary
compensation should be granted, the rules and practice of the House
precluding them from recommending any grant of public money. Your
Committee cannot, however, forbear to state, that the facts
presented to their notice in respect to the conviction of Mr.
Barber, to the sufferings he endured during the time his sentence
was being carried out at Norfolk Island, and to his subsequent
exculpation from the charge on which he was convicted, are so
peculiar as to render his case exceptional; and your Committee
desire to express their opinion that Mr. Barber has strong claims
on the favorable consideration of the Crown."</p>
<p>The report was "duly considered" by the Government, but they
could not see fit to recommend a vote to Barber, fearing to
establish a "dangerous precedent." In 1859, however, a sum was
placed on the Estimates, but was withdrawn, the Government giving
the assurance that they would see if something could not be done by
way of influencing the Bank of England. But it is needless to say
that nothing resulted herefrom, for Banks like not "dangerous
precedents" any more than Governments. After long delay, a sum of
&pound;5000 was granted, but poor Barber did not live long to enjoy the
price of his liberty and sufferings. The precise year and place of
his death are not known, but as his name cannot be traced in the
Law List after the early "Sixties," it is to be presumed that he
died about that time.</p>
<p>Reference has been made to the confession made by Fletcher
himself, who, as the reader has seen, displayed a remarkable
antagonism towards Barber, whom he might have cleared at the
outset, had he been so disposed; and it is necessary that the means
by which that confession was obtained should be explained. Shortly
after the arrival of Barber and Fletcher at Norfolk Island, Rev.
Mr. Naylor, the chaplain of the island, became impressed with the
peculiarity of the circumstances attendant upon Barber's
conviction, and began to inquire more closely into the case, being
led by that inquiry to believe firmly that Barber had been
wrongfully convicted. He obtained from Barber a full account of his
connection with Fletcher and his confreres, and joined heartily in
assisting Barber in collecting proofs necessary to form the
groundwork of an appeal to the Home authorities. Barber had
preserved a file of the Times newspaper, containing an account of
the trial, some letters which had passed between him and his
counsel at the time of the trial, and other documents, and these
Mr. Naylor took charge of. As chaplain of the hospital he was
brought into very close contact with the convict Fletcher on one
occasion, when the latter was lying very ill in hospital, Mr.
Smith, Commissary-General, being with him at the time, and at that
interview Fletcher made a voluntary statement to him which
convinced him that Barber knew nothing of the frauds at the time
they were committed. From this beginning the two gentlemen named
began to inquire further, and closely questioned Fletcher, and the
forger, apparently with great reluctance, made a confession clearly
exculpating his unfortunate fellow convict. In his confession
Fletcher said "If the application made by Barber to be tried
separately (so that he might have elicited the whole truth by
calling myself and the other parties accused) had not been resisted
by the prosecution, he must have been not only acquitted, but
exonerated from the slightest culpability. As I understand that it
has been stated I have refused to admit Mr. Barber's innocence, I
feel called upon to contradict this, and to state that I have only
objected to sign or declare that which might have a tendency to
prejudice myself.. .. ..If we had not both been tried together
Barber must, as a matter of course, have been acquitted.. .. .. ..
. Now that all hope on my part has vanished, I will tell you that,
whether guilty or not myself, a clever counsel who might have had
me under close examination as a witness, must have wrung out of me
such a mass of facts as would have entirely exculpated Barber from
the charge of being an accessory to the forgery." After closely
interrogating Fletcher the gentlemen named had an interview with
Barber, and subsequently they brought the two convicts together,
the result being that Mr. Naylor and Mr. Smith joined in a
representation on Barber's behalf, made in the form of a
certificate, and this, together with a memorial prepared by Barber,
was handed to Major Childs, who forwarded the report to the Home
Government, through the Governor of Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>One fact was brought to light before the Select Committee which
shewed most clearly that Barber's innocence had been declared by at
least one of the guilty parties even before the unfortunate victim
had reached Norfolk Island. The very day after Barber had sailed in
the "Agincourt" with the other convicts, Sanders, who was on board
another vessel lying in the Thames, made this confession, which was
handed to Barber by the doctor when the vessel reached the Cape of
Good Hope:&mdash;"I, William Sanders, now under sentence of
transportation for seven years, and about to leave my country, am
desirous of reiterating all my former statements of my belief and
conviction of the complete innocence of William Henry Barber of any
participation or guilty knowledge whatever of the late transactions
in which I or my wife Lydia Sanders were concerned, or that he
received one farthing more than professional remuneration. William
Henry Barber was an utter stranger to me until introduced to him by
Fletcher, as Thomas Hunt, nor did I after see him or have any
subsequent communication with him until my first examination at the
Mansion House. I make this declaration from an unfeigned desire of
doing all the justice that in my power lies to a person whom I have
been instrumental in placing in a situation, of the horrors of
which I am now so painfully acquainted." It was also elicited that
Sanders, on his first apprehension, said "I am guilty; but there is
one here who is as innocent as a child unborn," referring to
Barber. A further statement of Sanders, entered in the Hobart Town
Indent book, was also produced, Sanders having made it on his
arrival there, it being customary for every prisoner on arrival to
make a statement, which was taken down and witnessed by the
registrar:&mdash;"I represented Thomas Hunt to get &pound;1,200 Three per
Cent. Consols; tried with Barber and Fletcher; they went to Norfolk
Island; I was concerned in two other similar cases; I knew that
Fletcher had been concerned in these matters for several years
before I consented to take a part in it; it was discovered in
consequence of a correspondence with a Miss Slack; they were all
unclaimed dividends, and we represented fictitious persons, who
were supposed to be relatives to the parties leaving the money;
Fletcher has been concerned in it for upwards of fifteen years;
prosecuted by the Government; <i>Barber knew nothing about the
matter."</i></p>
<p>While acting as Judge of the Criminal Court at Norfolk Island,
Mr. Fielding Browne had Barber's case brought before him. He
perused the evidence taken at the trial, also Barber's memorial,
the report of Mr. Naylor and Mr. Smith, and the several confessions
of Fletcher, Sanders and his wife, and Mrs. Dorey (the two women
also having testified to Barber's innocence); and this is what the
Judge reported:&mdash;"Could the jury have had the advantage of
such an investigation as that to which I have alluded I cannot
doubt for a moment that they would have been of opinion that Mr.
Barber must have been as unconscious of the fraudulent character of
the business in which he was professionally engaged, as the
proctor, or the stock-broker, or any of the other gentlemen through
whose hands the matter successively passed."</p>
<p>On leaving Norfolk Island, 3rd September, 1845, Rev. T. B.
Naylor, wrote to a friend in Sydney, while Barber's case was being
inquired into there, as follows:&mdash;" On leaving the island, of
which I have now been for some years the chaplain, I owe to public
justice the duty of recording my full conviction of the perfect
innocence of William Henry Barber, now suffering on it as a
prisoner under sentence of transportation. I have, with increasing
interest, followed up a series of inquiries into circumstances
connected with his case, inaccessible to the court by which he was
tried, and many of which have subsequently occurred. In addition, I
have heard the reluctant acknowledgments of Fletcher, the guilty
originator of the frauds, establishing, beyond the possibility of
doubt, the innocence of Barber. My efforts shall continue for his
extrication; I deeply lament his truly wretched condition here, and
would gladly have seen it ameliorated. I have never known a
prisoner of the Crown who has been subjected to greater
wretchedness; I rejoice to be able to add, I have never seen an
instance of more dignified suffering, accompanied by invariably
consistent conduct. It will afford me real pleasure to continue his
acquaintance under happier circumstances.. .. .. . I shall never
remember without shame and horror the wantonness of the insults and
the refinements of cruelty practised towards him at Norfolk Island,
from the worst possible motives. I must add, that his manly
endurance of these enormities excited my admiration and esteem for
him. Never did any man appeal with more justice to the community
for assistance."</p>
<p>In the face of all these facts, is it at all wonderful that the
jury who returned the verdict of guilty against Barber, and sent
him to herd with felons of the worst description, should, having
the confessions brought before them, sign a declaration like the
following?&mdash;"If the evidence contained in the confessions of
the said Joshua Fletcher, William Sanders, Georgiana Dorey and
Lydia Sanders, and the other facts which have transpired since the
conviction of the said William Henry Barber, had been presented to
us at the trial, and if the explanation of apparently suspicious
circumstances could have been given before our verdict was
returned, which has since been afforded, we have no doubt whatever
that we should have acquitted Mr. Barber; the failure of justice,
so far as concerns him, arose in our judgment mainly from the fact
of his not having had a separate trial, and having been thereby
precluded from availing himself of the testimony of the other
prisoners." Yet there was a man in England, one of these jurymen,
who could not be prevailed upon to sign the document, although he
admitted that the evidence, if produced at the trial, would have
had material weight with him. "No," said he, as he buttoned up his
coat over the breast which is generally supposed to contain a human
heart, but which in this case was filled with stuff of the blue
metal species&mdash;"No! I have done with the matter; I will not
trouble myself further about it." Well was it for poor Barber, that
there were Naylors and Smiths in the world to protect him from the
cruel selfishness and wretched inhumanity of a being such as
this.</p>
<h2>THE CATO-STREET CONSPIRATORS.</h2>
<p>Judge Therry, in his "Reminiscences," refers to several
remarkable convicts, and I make no apology for drawing rather
extensively from his interesting sketches. In speaking of the
Cato-street conspirators, three of whom became known to him during
his thirty years' residence in Australia, he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The wicked design of the conspirators, it will be remembered,
was to massacre his Majesty's Ministers, as they sat at a cabinet
dinner at Lord Harrowby's on 23rd February, 1820. Thistlewood, once
a subaltern officer in the army, and about thirty other miscreants,
composed this band. The capture of these avowed assassins in a
stable-loft in Cato-street, and the story of their atrocious
designs, are too well known to require being re-told. The
ringleaders&mdash;Thistlewood, Ings, and another&mdash;expiated
their guilt on the scaffold, but the sentences of the other
prisoners brought to trial were commuted to transportation for
life. The three transported to New South Wales, whom I met on my
first visit to Bathurst in 1830, were S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, then holding
tickets-of-leave there. To them the clemency of the Crown was
extended from a belief that they were minor participants in the
plot, and had been led into it by wicked-minded leaders. Some of
them must have been weak-minded to have listened to the inducements
held out to them by the ringleaders to join the conspiracy.
Thistlewood, I have been assured, told H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, who
had been a Life Guardsman, that he would make him Lord Chancellor
under his provisional Government. On a calm perusal of the trial at
this distance of time, one cannot fail in being strongly impressed
with a belief, prevalent at the time of the trial, that Edwards,
the "spy" as he was designated, and who reported the proceedings of
the conspirators to the agents of Government immediately after
their several meetings&mdash;might well dispute with Thistlewood
the infamy of having originated the idea of the intended massacre.
It was the bad policy of those days to encourage spies&mdash;vile
hucksterers in blood&mdash;who, for the money they expected to make
by their villany, made men first their dupes and then their
victims. Grievous as was their crime, the three Cato-street
conspirators I met with became reformed and useful men in New South
Wales. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, still survives; he was for many
years chief constable of the Bathurst district, and was then the
terror of bushrangers. His career in the colony shewed that the
sparing of his life was a humane and well-bestowed act of clemency
by the Crown. He was rewarded by the Colonial Government for having
captured several of those daring disturbers of the peace, often
after a severe personal conflict with them. The reckless disregard
of danger, that in a bad cause made him an apt instrument for the
deed that doomed him to transportation, when engaged in a good and
righteous one made him an invaluable constable.
S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, obtained a ticket-of-leave soon after his
arrival from Sir T. Brisbane, for capturing in a single-handed
struggle Robert Storey, the notorious bush-ranger of his time, and
many other marauders of less note. If it were known that 'the
Cato-street chief' (the name by which as chief constable he was
known) was in search of the plunderers who then prowled along the
roads, they fled from the district, and his name was a 'tower of
strength' to the peaceable portion of the community. At the present
time he is the head of a patriarchal home on the banks of the Fish
River, at Bathurst, surrounded by children and grandchildren, all
industrious persons, in the enjoyment of a comfortable competence.
W&mdash;&mdash;- was also for some time an active and brave
constable under S&mdash;&mdash;-. On obtaining the indulgence of a
ticket-of-leave he married, and became the fashionable tailor of
the district. The sign-board over his shop contained a correct
description in announcing him 'W&mdash;&mdash;-, tailor, from
London.' Of course, the name of Cato-street, the last place of his
abode, was suppressed.</p>
<p>"With H&mdash;&mdash;-, the Life Guardsman, I came into frequent
contact afterwards at the Court of Requests. He was a gaunt,
muscular man, upwards of six feet high, with large black eyes
starting from his head, and thick jet black hair hanging in
profusion over a pale and rather forbidding visage. In appearance
he was the very impersonation of a conspirator, fit to have been
enrolled under Cataline. He was the principal baker in the town of
Bathurst at the time I visited it, and in his conduct there gave no
symptoms of the ferocity his countenance and the part assigned him
in the massacre indicated. He loved to litigate before me in cases
against his customers, who complained that his bills shewed great
skill <i>in addition,</i> but that they also shewed he had been but
very imperfectly acquainted with the rule <i>of reduction</i>. He
was a man of feeble intellect, to which he was indebted, as
expressly intimated in the commutation of his sentence, for his
life being spared. A prominent and perilous post was to have been
his in the perpetration of the massacre, and the rising of the
citizens which Thistlewood expected would follow from it. A part of
the wicked work assigned to him was to go with W&mdash;&mdash;-,
after the massacre, to Knightsbridge Barracks, with which as a Life
Guardsman he was well acquainted, and to fling a fireball into the
straw-shed. He became, nevertheless, abroad, a well-conducted man
and an industrious baker."</p>
<h2>OLD DICK HUNT.</h2>
<p>Judge Therry also gives a sketch of Richard Hunt, another
favorable specimen of a reformed character, who was the accomplice
of Thurtell in the murder of Weare, which attracted much attention
in England in 1824 for its deliberate atrocity. "I was present,"
says the Judge, "at his trial at Hertford in 1824, and heard
sentence of death passed upon him, commuted afterwards to
transportation for life, as the magistrates held out a hope to him
that if he informed where the body of the murdered man lay, it
would operate favorably for him. It had been weighed down by a
heavy stone to the bottom of a pond, and without his disclosure
might probably never have been found. Sir R. Peel, then Secretary
for the Home Department, reproved the justices for holding out this
hope; but deemed it advisable that magisterial faith should be kept
inviolate, and the sentence of death was accordingly commuted to
transportation for life. Eight years after his trial I fell in with
Hunt at the antipodes. He was there a trusted, and, I believe, a
trustworthy storekeeper, assigned to the service of a Government
contractor on the Blue Mountain Road. I recognised him at once, as
the mail-coach stopped at the contractor's store, at an early hour
on a winter's morning. It may be easily imagined what a contrast
was presented in his cheerful and healthy countenance to the
woe-begone visage he wore in the dock at Hertford. His conduct in
the colony was correct, and even meritorious. So unobtrusive and
humble was his demeanour, as if every moment he was abashed and
sensible of the great crime he had committed, that he was not even
once annoyed or taunted with a reference to it. For the last twenty
years he held the office of Court-Keeper of the Assize Court at
Bathurst, and by his respectful demeanour and general good conduct
enjoyed the favourable opinion of all who came in contact with him.
Shortly previous to my departure from the colony, he married the
respectable widow of a medical practitioner in Bathurst, and by
attention to his several duties became quite an exemplary person.
Though a participator in the foul deed of murder he was not the
perpetrator of it nor present at its commission. The deed was done
by Thurtell alone, who had quite a death-struggle with his victim
Weare before he accomplished it. As far as upwards of thirty-years
of a well-spent life could atone for the crime it has been atoned
for by Hunt&mdash;at least, he has approved himself not unworthy of
the clemency of the Crown by which his life was spared. He was
living in 1859, at the date of my departure from New South
Wales."</p>
<p>During his residence in Bathurst Hunt was the "character" of the
place. As Judge Therry intimates, he was a quiet, unpretentious
man, and diligent in the discharge of his duties. Before his
marriage he lived in Barrack-Lane, which connected Durham-street
with Howick-street, and which for many years was a rather
celebrated thoroughfare and the place of residence of some noted
characters, male and female. For many years a sister kept house for
him, she having come out from the old country for that purpose, but
the tie between them was broken when he brought a wife into the
home, and the sister disappeared from public view. Hunt had a
weakness for velvet waistcoats, and the writer has a clear
recollection of his portly walk and bearing when on his way to and
from his official quarters. He possessed a magnificent baritone
voice, and was a splendid singer; indeed, it is said that his
ability as a singer was indirectly the cause of his being mixed up
in the crime which led to his transportation. But it was only very
seldom that he could be induced to sing, and only his personal
friends (who were very few in number) had the privilege of hearing
the full power of his wonderful voice.</p>
<h2>KNATCHBULL, TAWELL, DILLON, VAUX AND OTHERS.</h2>
<p>The "Reminiscences" also contain the following sketches of
notorious characters:&mdash;</p>
<p>KNATCHBULL.&mdash;"Knatchbull's case was one that excited much
interest in 1844, arising partly from the honourable position the
man once occupied, and the great respectability of his connections.
He was half-brother of the late Sir Edward Knatchbull, and had
himself been a commander in the navy, and in that capacity served
as captain of a gun-brig. The career of this desperate person must,
no doubt, have given pain to his most respected family; but it
could reflect no discredit upon them. The disgrace was all his own.
Knatchbull had been originally transported for picking a pocket in
Vauxhall Gardens, but at the time he had exhausted the generosity
and kindness of his friends by his profligate course of life. In
the colony his career was one of low vice and habitual crime. The
first time I saw him was in the dock in the Supreme Court in
Sydney, when he was convicted of forgery and sentenced to be
transported to Norfolk Island. On his way to this penal settlement,
a conspiracy (of which Knatchbull was the leader) was formed by the
convicts to capture the vessel, not with the wicked daring of
pirates, but with the low cunning of the basest of criminals. The
design was to poison the captain and crew with arsenic, <i>four
pounds</i> of which were concealed in a pillow-case and stealthily
put on board. This was to have been thrown secretly into the cook's
galley. It was pre-arranged that, with the exception of the
conspirators, the rest of the crew and passengers should be
compelled to walk the plank, and that the vessel should then be
steered for an American port. The scheme was detected and defeated.
Afterwards Knatchbull came back to Sydney, got a ticket-of-leave
(which after the commission of such crimes ought not to have been
given to him), and obtained the command from a Sydney merchant of a
small coasting vessel of about one hundred tons, on board of which
the captain, mate and sailors, many of them ex-convicts, messed and
lived together on terms of equality. What a falling-off, indeed,
for a man who had once trod the deck as Captain of a British
man-of-war! His guilt in the case of murder for which he was
subsequently executed was established on the clearest evidence, in
fact, he might be said to have been caught in <i>flagrante
delicto</i>. The facts were shortly these:&mdash;An industrious
widow&mdash;a Mrs. Jamison&mdash;with her two children about from 3
to 5 years of age, kept a small shop in Margaret-place, Sydney.
Mrs. Jamison was reputed to be possessed of money, which she was
saving for the education of her two children. Knatchbull, in some
way, found this out. On the evening of the 6th January, 1844, he
was observed to be lurking an hour about Mrs. Jamison's house; this
attracted the attention of a Mr. Shallis, who watched his
movements. He was induced to do so from having some knowledge of
Knatchbull, and a suspicion that he was loitering there for no good
purpose. Observing that Knatchbull had entered the house he ran up
to the door and listened. He soon heard a noise which he described
to be 'like that of breaking a cocoanut with a hammer.' The house,
the door of which Knatchbull had fastened on the inside, was
forcibly entered soon afterwards by the police-officers. The poor
widow was found insensible, her head dreadfully cut, and blood
copiously-flowing. Knatchbull was apprehended inside the house, and
numerous circumstances combined to leave no shadow of doubt of his
guilt. Mrs. Jamison lingered in great agony for several days after
the infliction of several severe wounds, which the surgeon
testified he believed to be such as probably to be inflicted by the
tomahawk found under her bed. Efforts were made to save
Knatchbull's life, but the case was too flagrant to admit of a
respite, and he expiated his guilt at the usual place of execution
in Sydney. On his person, when apprehended, were found six bills
for &pound;50 each, three in blank and three filled up and drawn, in his
own handwriting on Sir Edward Knatchbull. These, of course, he
could not negotiate, for it was well known that the worthy baronet
had long ceased to take any interest in his degraded relative."</p>
<p><b>JOHN TAWELL.</b>&mdash;"John Tawell's case attracted much
attention in England a few years ago, partly from its cruelty in
poisoning a woman who was dependent upon him for support, and
partly from the remarkable mode of its detection. A few minutes
after he had done the deed he started from Slough to London by the
railway train; but the train was outstripped by the electric
telegraph, and on his arrival in London police-officers were in
attendance at the railway station, from which he was tracked to his
lodgings and arrested. Previous to his transportation, upwards of
forty years ago, his occupation in England was that of a commercial
traveller.. .. .. . He had been originally transported on a
conviction for forgery. The first count of the indictment charged
him with forging a bill for &pound;1,000; the second count, with uttering
it, knowing it to be forged; and the third with having a forged
bill to that amount in his possession. The two first counts, on
conviction, would have made him liable to a capital punishment; the
last to transportation for life. The prosecution was so compromised
that on his consenting to plead 'guilty' to the last charge, (which
he did) the Crown entered a <i>nolle prosequi</i> on the two first
counts. Consequently, he came out to the colony a convict for this
offence. Besides being a commercial traveller for some time he had
been in an apothecary's shop in England. On obtaining partial
exemption from convict discipline he became the principal druggist,
and had the showiest shop of that kind in Sydney when I arrived
there. After a prosperous career he sold his business to a
respectable chemist (the late Mr. Foss) it has been stated, for
&pound;14,000. This sum he judiciously invested in buildings and other
pursuits of profit.. .. .. . He had been once a member of the
Society of Friends, he wore the broad-brimmed hat, appeared always
in a neat and carefully-adjusted costume, and his whole appearance
and manner impressed one with the notion of his being a very
saintly personage. He always sought the society in public of
persons of reputed piety. I have often met him in the street
accompanied by a secretary or collector to a charitable
institution, whom he assisted in obtaining collections for
benevolent purposes. At one time he took up the cause of temperance
in such an intemperate and silly spirit that he ordered a puncheon
of rum he had imported to be staved on the wharf in Sydney, and its
contents poured into the sea, saying that he would 'not be
instrumental to the guilt of disseminating such poison throughout
the colony.' At another time his zeal took an apparently religious
turn. He built in Macquarie-street, Sydney, a commodious
meeting-house for the Society of Friends.. .. . A considerable part
of his money had been realized by buying up all the whalebone that
trading vessels at an early period imported into Sydney. This he
sent to a London house where it was manufactured into combs,
handles for various brushes, and other articles of domestic use..
.. .. .. When Tawell left the colony he had a considerable income
arising from rents and other sources, which became much reduced by
the general distress which pervaded New South Wales in 1843. Soon
after his arrival in England Tawell married a respectable lady,
who, it is believed, knew nothing of his antecedents. After his
marriage he felt the maintenance of the female whom he subsequently
destroyed had become an inconvenient burden to his diminished
income. There can be little doubt a desire to relieve himself from
the expense of supporting her was the motive that led to the
perpetration of the deed for which he deservedly suffered. Since
his death there has been a disputed claim to a portion of Tawell's
property in Sydney, involved in much legal intricacy, arising from
the circumstance of the Crown reissuing a new grant for some land
forfeited by Tawell's conviction in favour of his widow and
family."</p>
<p><b>LUKE DILLON.</b>&mdash;"Luke Dillon was an Irish gentleman of
good family. He had been sentenced to death in a case of assault
(capital) on a lady in his own rank of life. This sentence was
afterwards commuted to transportation for life. At the time of his
trial in Dublin, like the late Yelverton case, it was quite a
<i>sensation</i> one. I was induced to go on board the convict ship
that conveyed him to New South Wales, in consequence of receiving
through him a letter from a friend at the Irish bar, Mr. Richard
Farrell, Chief Commissioner of the Insolvent Court in Ireland, who
was a stranger to Dillon personally, but happened to be present at
his trial. Mr. Farrell was induced to write solely from some
serious doubts he entertained on the propriety of the conviction.
That Dillon's case was morally bad and base in the highest degree
there can be no doubt; yet there was great imprudence on the part
of the lady on whose account he was sentenced to death, that might,
on calm judicial consideration, have reduced the offence from the
character of a capital crime to one of seduction under aggravated
circumstances. Mr. Farrell drew my particular attention to the
remarkable feature in the case, that Dillon and this lady were
refused admittance early in the afternoon at a respectable hotel in
Dublin, as they brought no luggage with them, and thereupon they
walked together across the street, and were received at a public
house, where the imputed offence was committed. Ordinary discretion
should have prevented a lady so rejected from entering such a
place. The authorities at home, on a subsequent review of the case,
formed a less unfavourable opinion of Dillon's conduct than
prevailed in Dublin during the <i>sensation</i> trial. A
conditional pardon soon followed him to the colony, which set him
at liberty within the limits of New South Wales. Had he remained a
year or two longer he would have obtained an absolute one; but,
impatient of the restriction to remain in the colony, he escaped,
and hence made his way to Dieppe, in France, but never afterwards
revisited any place within the realm of England. He was unobtrusive
and well-conducted in the colony, and received much kindness from
persons who had known his family in Ireland. I lately heard at
Paris of his subsequent career. He assumed a fictitious name, and
married, at Dieppe, the daughter of one of the principal innkeepers
of the town. After a residence of a few years there, his career
became known to the innkeeper, who took his daughter and their
children from him, and dismissed him from the house. Soon
afterwards Dillon became insane, was confined in a French Lunatic
Asylum, and there died some time ago in the prime of life."</p>
<p><b>VAUX'S CASE.</b>&mdash;"John Hardy Vaux was an educated
convict. He had been transported for life. After the usual
probationary course, he obtained a conditional pardon, which placed
him in the position of a free citizen in New South Wales, provided
he did not leave the colony. The violation of the condition of
residence subjected him to be remitted to his first
sentence&mdash;transportation for life. He escaped, however, from
New South Wales, and on his arrival in England, had the hardihood
to publish a book descriptive of his career in the colony, which
attracted some attention in London about the year 1828. Soon
afterwards he made his way to Dublin, where he was again convicted
of larceny, and transported for seven years under the assumed name
of James Stewart. On the arrival of the ship that conveyed him to
New South Wales, I went on board to see this then somewhat
remarkable person. One who has seen a good portrait of Robespierre
might easily imagine, on seeing Hardy Vaux, that he had an
impersonation of the regicide before him. Like the regicide, too,
his address was very courteous, and his voice was one of a
remarkably soft and insinuating tone. In a conversation I had with
him he expressed a deep contrition for his past life, vowed
amendment, and moved one to pity for his fate by the silvery
accents in which he poured forth his gratitude for the mercy that
had been shewn him, and expressed a hope that by his future conduct
he might prove that it had not been unworthily bestowed. I have no
doubt that he meant at the moment all that he had uttered, but so
incapable had he by this time become to resist any temptation to
crime that presented itself, that within a twelve-month after his
arrival, a second time as a convict, he committed a felony, for
which he was sent to work for two years in irons on the public
roads. The last time I saw him was in the dock about ten years ago
accused of a fresh crime. He was then advanced into the decrepitude
of old age."</p>
<p><b>THE NAMELESS GERMAN.</b>&mdash;"A German artist, whose name I
withhold, as he lived creditably and married respectably in the
colony, served his sentence in the country, and on coming to Sydney
enjoyed the general reputation of being an emigrant. He arrived,
though in a different ship, on the day of my own arrival in 1829.
Both ships had also sailed from England on the same day, about
three months and a half previously. I happened to be present at his
trial at the Middlesex Sessions, where he had a good chance of a
favorable verdict, until he put an injudicious question to the
principal witness. The charge against him was for snatching a
reticule from Lady Laura Meyrick's hand, on her coming out of the
Opera House. In the reticule was a small scent-bottle, which the
witness said she believed was her property. The evidence as to the
identity of the stolen bottle, however, was weak, until,
unfortunately for himself, the prisoner put a question, inquiring
the grounds of her ladyship's belief. The reply was, 'Because, as
you may see, my husband's crest and the initials of my name are
engraved upon the stopper of the bottle.' The adage that 'when a
man is his own counsel he has a fool for his client' could not be
more completely illustrated. He was immediately found guilty, and
sentenced to transportation for seven years. This person had taught
drawing in several high families in England. He cultivated his art
in the colony with some success." (The learned judge in this case
left off right on the borders of a joke. If this artist-convict
served any portion of his time in the Government employ he had a
large amount of drawing to do, but a handcart was the solitary
"artist's material" supplied to him for the execution of the work.
There were many "high-class" artists of this kind in New South
Wales, who were taught drawing to perfection in the State school,
free of charge).</p>
<p><b>MAIS AND FITZGIBBON.</b>&mdash;"Mais and Fitzgibbon may be
numbered amongst the remarkable convicts. Their cases furnish a
striking illustration of the very unsuitable mode of disposing of
convicts on arrival, arising from inattention to their
classification. If it had been designed to place these convicts in
a position in which they might, with the utmost facility, repeat
the crimes for which they had been transported, and almost be
tempted into their commission, no more convenient place could have
been selected than the service to which they were assigned. Mais, a
man of dark colour, from the isle of France; the other, Fitzgibbon,
a native of Belfast, were transported, in 1829, for life, both for
the crimes of forgery. They were clever and well-educated convicts.
They were assigned as clerks to the Commissariat Department
stationed at Liverpool, then a large depot for convicts; furnishing
road parties, varying from twenty to forty in number, for the
repair of the public thoroughfares. These parties were scattered in
detachments over a range of about twelve miles, in different
directions from the town. Mais and Fitzgibbon thus occupied a
position of trust similar to that of commissariat clerks. They had
access to all the printed forms of the office, and with the
facilities which that access afforded, concocted this very
ingenious and successful fraud. They prepared a nominal list of
five-and-twenty fictitious persons, and described a road in the
neighbourhood, to which they gave a fictitious name, where these
men were represented by them to be engaged at daily work. The road
and the road party only existed on paper. In order to complete
their fraud it was necessary to forge the signatures of six or
seven persons; first, the signature of the contractor to a draft on
the Commissariat, who was supposed to supply the party with
provisions; and, secondly, signatures to the receipts of several
persons for small payments, which that carefully conducted branch
of the public service requires previous to the payment of money. So
successfully were those numerous signatures imitated, that all the
witnesses whose names were forged admitted on the trial, that if
the signatures alone had been submitted to their inspection,
unconnected with the documents to which their names had been
attached, they would have believed them to be genuine signatures.
In the instructions I received as counsel for their defence, I
became acquainted with the artistic mode in which these signatures
were executed. Apprehensive, however, that to disclose the mode may
not come under the head of 'the diffusion of useful knowledge,' I
forbear from describing the process resorted to. Suffice it to say
that it was one that furnished a more exact resemblance of
handwriting than photography can supply. In the case of Mais and
Fitzgibbon the <i>proof aliunde</i> was quite irresistible. In
their case, as in many others, the folly of the criminals led to
the detection of the crime. These persons obtained a week's leave
of absence, and proceeded to Sydney. They there got equipped by a
fashionable tailor, and for a few days passed themselves off as
gentlemen of fortune. The police, however, attracted by their
obtrusive appearance in public, soon brought their career to a
close, though not until they had succeeded in defrauding the
Commissariat of several hundred pounds. A small portion of the
money&mdash;the fruit of their fraud&mdash;was found upon them when
they were apprehended. They were tried at the Campbelltown Assizes
of 1830, and subsequently suffered, being, I believe, the two last
persons in the colony who underwent the extreme penalty of the law
for this offence, to which soon afterwards, in conformity with the
law in England, was attached the mitigated punishment of
transportation."</p>
<p><b>The "KNAVE OF DIAMONDS."</b>&mdash;"Bushell&mdash;known by
the sobriquet of the 'Knave of Diamonds'&mdash;was a convict of
very varied accomplishments. He spoke German and French as fluently
as English. His knowledge of German facilitated the commission of
the fraud for which he was transported. Personating a Prussian
baron, well moustached and disguised in suitable costume, he gave
an order to an eminent jeweller (Hamlet) to provide him with
diamonds to the value of several thousand pounds. Whilst the order
was in process of execution he gave another order to a jeweller to
provide him with low-priced imitation diamonds, and to prepare a
box similar to the one containing the pure ones. Afterwards by
extraordinary dexterity, on the occasion of one of his visits to
Hamlet, he contrived to substitute the mock box for the real and
valuable one, and with it escaped to the continent, where he was
detected with either the diamonds or the proceeds he obtained from
the pawnbroker to whom he had transferred them. I have not met with
a report of Bushell's trial, but this is the tale of his adventures
current in the colony. Bushell had a voice quite equal to Lablache,
to whom in size and person he bore a strong resemblance. He was the
principal singer for many years at our theatres and concerts in
Sydney. There he made a respectable connexion by marriage, and led,
I believe, a reputable life. He died a few years ago in easy
circumstances."</p>
<h2>THE CASE OF WILSON AND TATTERSALL.</h2>
<p>In 1834 three convicts took to the bush near Sydney and caused
not a little sensation by their depredations. The names of two of
them were Wilson and Tattersall, the former being a villain of the
worst type, as cruel as he was un-principled. He had been
transported for life to the colony for burglary, and his life was
one long series of crimes of violence, his own death on the gallows
forming a fitting sequel thereto. The offence for which he and his
companion bushranger, Tattersall, were executed was murder of the
most deliberate kind. The three men had evaded arrest for some time
and appeared to have been known to one of the leading barristers of
the colony, Dr. Wardell, who also had made a reputation as a
vigorous writer on current events. This gentleman lived at
Petersham, a few miles from Sydney, on his own estate, and it was a
frequent custom of his to ride round his estate in the early
morning. During one of these riding excursions he fell in with the
three bushrangers. He was unarmed at the time, and contributed to
his own destruction by a most foolhardy act. Addressing Wilson, the
leader of the gang, he told him to "come along with him," and
attempted to drive the bushrangers forward for arrest. Wilson
warned him off, but Wardell persisted in his effort to arrest them,
and although Wilson called to Tattersall to bring him his
double-barrelled gun, which was concealed in the bushes a few yards
distant, he still stood his ground. The gun was brought, and
Wardell then appeared for the first time to realise his danger.
Seeing the gun pointed at him he called out "Surely you will not
fire on an unarmed man?" Wilson simply replied "Won't I!" and
immediately fired, killing Wardell on the spot. The horse galloped
home, and a search having been instituted, Wardell's dead body was
found next day at the spot where he received his death-wound. A few
days afterwards the three bushrangers were captured, and at the
trial the third member of the gang turned approver, the whole of
the circumstances of the tragedy thus being revealed. On being
called upon in the usual way to say why sentence of death should
not be pronounced upon him, Wilson shewed by his words and actions
that he was utterly callous and brutal. He inveighed against the
counsel who had defended him, declaring that he was a "spooney, and
had only been sent to pump him;" and upon his comrade in crime,
Tattersall, declaring that "he had no part in the actual murder,
and that he had only obeyed the bidding of Wilson, who would have
taken his own life if he had not handed him the gun when desired to
do so," he turned upon Tattersall, knocked him down in the dock,
and attempted to trample upon him, and it was with difficulty that
the unfortunate wretch was rescued from his violence by the
officers of the court. Before his execution Wilson declared that
during the trial he several times intended to leap over the dock,
seize one of the swords which were hanging outside the jury box
(the jury was composed of seven military officers, who had hung
their swords near the dock before taking their seats), and rush at
the Chief Justice who tried the case and cut off his head on the
Bench. He died as he had lived, a reprobate of the worst class,
Tattersall being executed with him. The third bushranger, who had
turned approver, was, twenty years afterwards, charged with the
murder of his wife under circumstances of great brutality, but the
jury who tried the case, much to the surprise of the presiding
judge, returned a verdict of acquittal.</p>
<h2>JOHN LYNCH'S CASE.</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the most remarkable cases of brutal depravity
ever recorded is that of a convict named Lynch, who was transported
from Cavan, Ireland, 1831, for robbery, his sentence being fourteen
years. In the same ship there came out with him to the colony his
father, under transportation for life, his crime being
manslaughter. Four years after his arrival in the colony, Lynch was
placed upon his trial, in company with other men, for the murder of
a fellow convict on an estate near Berrima, where they had been all
engaged. The man had been beaten to death with clubs, and his body
had been placed on a fire, the murderers endeavouring by this means
to destroy evidence of their crime. The evidence against Lynch, as
the one who had taken the prominent part in the deed of blood, was
very strong, but through one of the principal witnesses for the
Crown appearing in the witness box in such a state of intoxication
as to make his testimony valueless, the whole of the prisoners,
were acquitted. This witness was overseer on the estate where the
crime was committed, and ten years afterwards was himself tried for
murder.</p>
<p>Lynch went from bad to worse, and in 1842, eleven years after
his arrival in New South Wales, he was tried for the murder of a
man named Londregan, and being convicted, was hanged. The story of
his worst crimes is best told by himself. The day before his
execution he made the following confession before Mr. Bowen, Police
Magistrate of Berrima. He first minutely detailed the circumstances
attendant on the murder of two persons whom he met on the road, and
whose company he joined. These two persons (a white man and a black
boy) were driving a dray belonging to Mr. T. Cowper, laden with
bacon and other articles for the Sydney market. Lynch killed them
both with an axe as they lay asleep, hid the bodies under a heap of
stones, proceeded to Sydney, and sold the articles on the dray in
Sydney. On his return to the country with the empty dray, he said
he fell in with the two Frazers (father and son), and he thus
coolly narrated what followed:&mdash;</p>
<p>"While encamped at Bolland's, at the stone-quarry, the two
Frazers came up with Bawtree's horse-team and dray. We sat together
by the fire, had a great deal of talk, and, as usual, I told them
as many lies as suited my purpose, and managed to get from them an
account of the whole of their and their master's concerns, as well
as of the valuable load they had on. But I had then no intention of
doing them any harm. We travelled together next day, and I was
enabled to afford them great assistance in getting on their tired
horses, for neither of them could drive well, and I was clever in
the management of draft cattle. We encamped in Bargo Brush, by the
side of the road, and a cart with two men and a woman afterwards
joined us. When we were all lying down, and, I believe, all but
myself asleep, a man on horseback rode up and made particular
enquiries about Mr. Cowper's dray, describing it exactly, and
telling the whole history of its appearance, as well as that of the
driver and the black boy. I lay still and did not speak a word, but
Frazer, the old man, got up, between asleep and awake, and answered
something at random. The rider then asked the distance to the
nearest inn, and went on. 'Whew!' said I, 'this is sharp
work&mdash;this will never do&mdash;I must get rid of this dray and
get another somehow?' I had the whole night to think over the
matter and to form my plans. So in the morning I went under the
pretence of looking for my bullocks, but in reality of driving them
away into a deep gully. I strangled the dog belonging to Mr.
Cowper's bullock-driver, and stayed away long enough to allow the
other cart with the two men and the woman to leave, knowing that
the Frazers&mdash;who seemed greatly to desire my company from the
assistance I could give them in managing their teams&mdash;would
wait for me. When I returned I told them that my bullocks were
nowhere to be found, and I had no doubt they had gone to their own
home, up the country beyond Berrima. I consulted with them what I
had best do, and we agreed that I should leave my dray there, since
it was nearly empty, and go on with them for the bullocks, as they
offered to take the few things I had on their dray. We encamped for
this night in a flat on the other side of Cordeaux's Hill. In the
morning young Frazer went over the hill to get the horses, and I
volunteered to go with him and assist. It was cold, and I put on a
pea-jacket, not to keep me warm, however, but to conceal an axe
which I held under my arm. When I got up to young Frazer I had no
difficulty in obtaining the opportunity I wanted. I gave him one
crack on the head, and he just dropped like a log of wood. If
people knew how easy it is to take away life, things of this sort
would happen oftener. I then returned to old Frazer, who remained
with the dray, and began yarning to him. After a time he began to
wonder what had become of 'Wully.' I had my axe all right, but
would not strike until I could make all sure. At last he turned his
head, and down he went. The next business to attend to was the
getting rid of the bodies. I dragged the old one some yards out of
the way, lest persons passing through the flat might come upon it,
and then returned to the body of the son. With a spade I got from
the dray I dug a hole and buried him; afterwards I buried the
father in the same manner.</p>
<p>"By the time I had finished, the day was far advanced, so I
thought it better to stop there for the night. By the evening of
the next day I got to Mulligan's. I had no notion of trusting them,
or indeed anybody, so I amused them with an account of my being
hired to drive up the dray for a gentleman in Sydney. The family
consisted of the old man Mulligan: Mrs. Mulligan, who lived with
him, but was not his wife; her son, a lad of about eighteen; and
her daughter, a girl of about fourteen. Mrs. Mulligan, seeing
chests of tea on the dray, said she was out of tea, and proposed to
buy a chest of me. At first I reminded her of the bad faith they
had kept with me before, but pretended at length to bargain with
her. But this was only my craft, you should know, for I had no
notion of letting her have any of the property; I only wanted to
know how much money they hid in the house. She said she had &pound;9. We
did not come to any agreement, but I let them hope they would get
some of my master's property. The next day, in the afternoon, I
pulled out a note (&pound;1) and sent to Gray's public house to treat
them. In the evening we drank together and got very sociable, but I
took care not to drink much. Well! thoughts were in my head, and
the time was coming on; I began to feel very disturbed and walked
out of the hut. It was a clear though cold, windy night; I looked
up at the bright moon, and I prayed to Almighty God to direct me! I
said to myself "I am an injured man, and the Mulligan's have
defrauded me what I perilled life and liberty to obtain. That
fellow, when I was starving in the Berrima Iron Gang, has often
passed me without so much as giving me a shilling, when he had many
pounds in his hands which were justly mine. And now, would it not
be right that they should lose all they possess, as a judgment upon
them for withholding his own from the poor prisoner? Heaven guide
me, and point out to me what to do!' Well, I went into the house
again, and we had another glass of rum round. Now, it was a cold,
windy night, so I took up the axe and said I would go out and cut a
few barrow-loads of wood for the fire, if John (meaning the young
man) would wheel them in. We went out and had some talk whilst I
was cutting up. He said that Mulligan was an old man, that he
should leave the farm at his death, and that God Almighty would
soon take him away, adding, that if he did not he (John) would,
mayhap, give him a helping hand. I was shocked to hear him speak in
this way, knowing how near he was to his own departure out of this
world; so I said 'Ah, John, you should not speak in this way, you
do not know what may be in store for yourself.' At this time he had
taken two loads in the barrow, and was come for the third. I had
just finished my work, so I took the axe, gave it a back-handed
swing against his skull, and threw it down. I threw a quantity of
boughs over the body, and went back to the hut. We had another
glass together, and the mother inquired for her son. I said he had
offered to go into the bush to see if my horses were right. After a
time she began to wonder that John did not come back, and to be
very fidgetty. This bothered me. She also mentioned a dream she had
the night before. She thought she had an infant child, and that she
had seen this child horribly mangled and covered with blood. I
hated this old woman, for she used to toss cups and balls, and
could foretell things. Well, nothing would satisfy her but she must
go to the door and cooey. She cooeyed for John, but no John came;
and at last she would not even drink. Then old Mulligan said
'Perhaps the lad is lost in the bush,' and took his gun outside to
fire for the purpose of directing him as to the position of the
hut. It did not suit me to have neighbours drawn to the house, so I
said to Mulligan, 'You had better not fire, people will come,
perhaps the police; and if we are to deal, it won't answer that the
dray should be seen here.' 'Truth, lad, that's a right thought of
you,' he answered, and instead of firing folded his arms, holding
the gun with the muzzle pointing up. Well, there was no quieting
the old woman, and I had my eye upon her inside, at the same time
that I was standing by Mulligan outside. I saw her take out a large
knife, and conceal it on her clothes, and then give it to the
little girl. There was no time to be lost. I had left the axe on
the ground when I had cut the wood, but my own, with which I had
had such good luck with the other four, was in the dray; but then,
how to get it without showing my intent? But I never was at a loss
in the scheming line, so I pretended that a dog I had got was
troublesome, and took him to tie him to the wheel of the dray; this
gave me an opportunity of getting the axe, and placing it
unperceived under my thick coat. By this time the old woman, who
seemed bewitched, would be content with nothing short of going
outside and looking for her son. She went towards the spot and
began moving the boughs which covered the body. Now or never
thought I. I prayed to God to help me! determined to proceed or
perish in the attempt, and kept my eye upon Mulligan, who was close
beside me. He turned his head&mdash;one blow and down he went. I
then went towards the old woman; she was in the act of returning,
having found her son's body; but, playing the cunning, she said
"Lord! what brings the police here? there are three of them getting
over the fence." I was not to be gulled that way, so I gave her my
foot, which staggered her and then brought her down. None now
remained but the little girl; the poor little thing had never done
any injury, and I was really sorry for her. I went into the hut
where she remained, and I said to her 'Now, my little girl, I will
do for you what I would not for the others, for you're a good girl;
you shall have ten minutes to say your prayers.'"</p>
<p>"Here," said the magistrate, "Lynch paused, as if he had a
difficulty in going on. I suppose it might have been a feeling of
remorse, and I could easily imagine that the scene of the child
begging for life must have been a most pitiable one. I therefore
ended the pause by saying&mdash;'In short, you killed her, and with
the axe?' He said 'I did,' upon which I bid him proceed."</p>
<p>"I now," he proceeded, "began to consult with myself as to the
best mode of disposing of the bodies. If I buried them in a
frequented neighbourhood like that, it was likely that the graves
would be discovered. There were plenty of wombat holes near at
hand, but it would be troublesome to carry all the bodies, and the
native dogs might pull them partly out. I felt an aversion to the
thought of burning the bodies of my fellow-creatures&mdash;it
seemed <i>such inhumanity;</i> but then I considered that the poor
things could feel nothing, and that it was little odds to them
whether they were burned or buried. I therefore put them on a heap
of logs close to the house, where the Mulligans had been burning
off a piece for potatoes. When the fire was well made up I was
surprised to see how the bodies burned. They flared up as if they
were so many bags filled with fat. It was an awful thing to stand
alone in the dead of night and see the four bodies burning to
ashes. By morning there was nothing left but a heap, like of
slacked lime; I took it up in my hand and buried it in another part
of the paddock. I may have left, perhaps, some ends of bones
behind. I then burned the greater part of the Mulligan's clothes,
and made such alterations to the house as I judged
necessary&mdash;for I had still a difficult card to play, and must
satisfy the neighbourhood that I had become rightfully possessed of
the farm, horses and cattle. (At the trial for Londrigan's murder,
Lynch applied to the judge, Sir J. Dowling, to have these horses
and cattle sold to defray the expenses of counsel; but the
application was refused).</p>
<p>"The first thing I did was to go to Gray's inn, and ask to see
him. On his coming out I inquired of him, with seeming concern,
what sort of a man Mulligan was in his dealings. I knew his answer
would be an inquiry why I asked. I said that I had just come from
Sydney, where I had met Mulligan and concluded a bargain with him,
but that he had failed to deliver the cattle as he had promised.
Knowing by Mulligan's papers the persons to whom he probably owed
money, I took care to go to them and make similar inquiries. Some
of them seemed to look down upon me as a kind of flat, and that
Mulligan had taken me in. I acknowledged that I had lent him a
valuable mare which had cost me eighty guineas, and pretended to
look very blank when it was hinted that perhaps I might never see
my mare again. Some thought that the whole thing was made up
between Mulligan and his landlord. Smith, for some fraudulent
purpose of their own.</p>
<p>"I then went to Sydney, called at the <i>Gazette</i> office and
pretending to be Mulligan, paid for an advertisement in his name,
to the effect that his wife having absconded from her home, he
would not be answerable for her debts. I then wrote several letters
in his name to persons in the neighbour-hood of his farm, being
chiefly arrangements about money matters, for I had collected
enough of his affairs to be able to word them in a suitable manner.
When I returned to Wombat Brush all these things were told to me as
so much news, and I appeared to be a victim. I afterwards wrote a
letter to myself, in Mulligan's name, as from Illawarra, and
employed a man to put it for me in the Campbelltown post office,
and this I shewed about. The stupid fellow, however, not knowing my
meaning, put it in Liverpool instead, and thus the postmark," he
added smiling, "enabled you, Sir, to detect the trick after I was
apprehended. But it answered well with the neighbours. A man on the
next farm, who at first troubled me with a great many awkward
questions, was at length so satisfied that all was right, that he
wanted me to marry his daughter.</p>
<p>"I have mentioned these things all at once to account for my
being allowed to enter, without dispute, into possession of
Mulligan's property. I succeeded in throwing dust into everybody's
eyes. Even the officer of the mounted police and his three
troopers, who called at the hut a few days after the murder, went
away quite satisfied. But before I took all these steps I went down
to Appin, with a light cart and two of Bawtree's horses, to fetch
up Barnet and his wife, who had been fellow-servants with me at
McEvoy's there. I had promised, when I parted with them, if I met a
situation they would like, I would let them know. I accordingly
described to them the Mulligan family, and hired them in Mulligan's
name. I left them the cart and one horse to bring them up. I
selected them because they were immigrants, and simple people. They
would believe anything you told them. I had no difficulty,
therefore, in accounting to them for the absence of the Mulligan
family. I told them that Mulligan and his wife had had a row, and
that he had turned her out, and that he had been obliged to go to
the Five Islands and hide, on account of a horse found in his
possession which was all wrong.</p>
<p>"I was now comfortably settled, made improvements on the farm,
determined to clear and fence an additional paddock, and intended
to live honestly and do everything fair and square; but I was
obliged to go down the country to settle things with Smith, the
landlord. He was a knowing shaver, but I was at least as deep as
he, so we arranged matters to the satisfaction of us both.</p>
<p>"Returning home on one occasion from Sydney, on the 18th
February last, I encamped on the north side of Razor Back. In the
morning, while on the point of starting, I was met and accosted by
a strange man, who seemed very free and open in his conversation,
and said that he wanted to get out of the way, and that it might
not be known where he was going. 'Why,' I said, 'you do not look
like a bushranger.' 'No,' said he, 'I'm an immigrant from Ireland,
and have just quarrelled with my wife, and have sworn never to live
with her again.' I wanted a man to help to put up some fencing. Now
this was a strong-built man, and had the look of a good man for
working, and being simple enough to all appearance, seemed just the
fellow to suit me. I spoke him fair, and after some more talk, I
hired him for six months for &pound;15. This was Kerus Londrigan, the man
on whose account I am about to suffer. At the time I speak I had
not the most distant intention of doing him an injury. We proceeded
together towards Berrima. I gathered more from him on the way; he
said that he and his wife had earned together as much as &pound;8 per
week, up the country, during the last harvest. On my saying that it
was a large sum, he said that he could work against any man, and
his wife was accustomed to work too. She used to bind the sheaves
for him; on his parting with her he had stuck to the money. I said
'Is she your lawful wife?' He replied 'Yes.' 'And can you,' said I,
'defraud your own lawful wife of the money she has hardly earned by
the sweat of her brow? I would myself take a musket and rob upon
the highway, sooner than be guilty of such cruelty.' I tried to
persuade him to give her some of his money, but he was obstinate.
When we passed Holland's, where his wife was staying, I saw her,
while he hid himself under some clothes in my cart. I then again
tried to pursuade him to give his wife her own proper share, since
he had parted from her, as he declared, for ever. But he had no
feeling for her, and my heart began to turn against him, and to
feel a hatred of him as a selfish and hard-hearted man. When we got
to Cripps' he hid himself again; and on my asking all about it, as
we got on the road, he gave me an account of his having accused Mr.
Cripps, before the magistrate, of stealing a bundle he had left at
the house. From his account I perceived he was a kind of lawyer,
and fond of Court. Besides, on getting better acquainted with him,
I found he was by no means simple, as I at first supposed; but had
a great deal of cunning about him. I was sorry that I had hired
him, and would have got rid of him at once; but, as ill-luck would
have it, having nothing about me but orders, which I could not get
cashed at Stone-quarry, I had borrowed a one-pound note from him.
Towards sundown, two men with bundles joined us on this side of
Nattie Bridge, and expressed their intention of camping with us for
the night. But this did not suit me, so that I spoke roughly to
them, on which they were offended and went on. We encamped
(Londrigan and I) on the spot well-known to you, sir, and then I
began to think what I should do; I was greatly agitated and could
not close my eyes, while the other fellow slept like a pig. What
was I to do? If I took this fellow with his law to the farm with
me, it would certainly be my ruin; for, after using his wife as he
had done, he would not stop at informing against me. Even if I got
money in Berrima (which I could do), and paid him his &pound;2, telling
him at the same time to be off, he would have me up to court for a
breach of agreement, and then the magistrate might ask questions.
We had been seen together by so many people on the road that there
would be great risk in killing him; but everything considered, it
seemed the safest and best plan after all. He deserved it for his
ill-usage of his wife, and he had some money in his pocket,
although it was not for his money that I killed him. I passed the
night thinking over these thoughts; and on the next morning, after
having put to the horse, I set my eyes upon him. He was a
powerful-made man, I&mdash;small as you see I am; and he had
boasted to me that since he was fifteen or sixteen years old he had
never met a man that could throw him. Well! my man, thought I, I
fancy I shall be able to settle you, notwithstanding your fine
limbs. He had just set down the tomahawk, with which he had been
cutting up a little wood to make a fire. I took it up without his
perceiving me, thinking 'Now I must mind what I am about; for if I
do not hit him fair, and he tackles me, I shall be done.' He sat
astride on the long log on which our fire was, smoking his pipe,
thinking of nothing; his head was a little turned from me; I gave
him one blow, and he fell, and then another when he was down, but
the first settled him. I then hid the body under some bushes, where
it was found next day, stripping off all the clothes to the shirt,
and hiding them. I intended to have returned as soon as I
conveniently could, and bury the body; but my time was come, and I
can see the hand of God in my detection&mdash;for I well remember
taking off the belt (the discovery of which in my house was the
strongest thing against me at the trial) and throwing it into a
small hole of water; but afterwards perceiving the end of it above
the water, and fearing to leave it there, I pitched it into the
cart, and never thought of it since. This was Sunday: I returned
home; and on the Tuesday I was apprehended by your orders. You
know, sir, how by degrees everything then came out."</p>
<p>It is questionable if there has ever been placed on record a
confession of bloody deeds more horrible in its calm devilishness
than this. "It will not surprise the reader to be informed," says
Judge Therry, "that this wretched criminal died with the same
reckless indifference about his own life with which he had taken
the lives of others."</p>
<h2>BLACKSTONE'S CASE.</h2>
<p>A less horrible record of individual pursuit of crime,
apparently from sheer love of it, is that of the case of a convict
named Blackstone, although the impulse towards wrong-doing in that
case appears to have been quite as strong as that which moved Lynch
to his terrible deeds of blood. Blackstone was transported to the
colony for burglary&mdash;then a capital offence, but in his case
the sentence was commuted to transportation for life. Soon after
his arrival he planned the Bank robbery in Sydney, for which he,
being a blacksmith, manufactured the jemmies, crowbars, and other
instruments used in making the tunnel underground. The robbery
remained undetected for years, but Blackstone having been convicted
of another burglary shortly after its perpetration and transported
therefor to Norfolk Island, he, after having been there for about
eighteen months, intimated to the authorities that if released from
his sentence he would tell all about the bank robbery. He was
accordingly admitted as informer, and upon his evidence his former
confederates were convicted and sentenced to death, but the
sentence was not carried out, it being decided that the evidence of
an approver, himself a convicted felon, was not legally admissible.
Blackstone was to receive &pound;100, a free pardon, and a passage to
England as a reward for bringing this extraordinary burglary to
light, but the burglar passion was so strong upon him that a week
previous to the sailing of the vessel in which his passage had been
secured he was again detected in a burglary at a store, and for the
third time was sentenced to transportation for life.</p>
<h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>
<p>These are but a few of the more remarkable histories which are
interwoven with the early history of the colony, and they will
serve to shew how fruitful of evil in its worst form was the system
of transportation and its penal attachments to the Antipodes. The
following brief reference to cases, culled hap-hazard from the
criminal records, will be sufficient to indicate that some of the
old leaven was working for fully a quarter of a century after the
system was abolished:&mdash;</p>
<p>In 1801 a great fraud was perpetrated in the official books and
records by convict clerks who had access thereto. They manipulated
the books containing the names and sentences of prisoners, and when
the frauds were discovered it was seen that the periods of
transportation in no fewer than two hundred cases had been altered
to make them appear less; and it was stated that the forgers
received &pound;10 to &pound;12 from each prisoner in consideration for the
accommodating work.</p>
<p>At the Criminal Sessions in 1822 no less than thirty-four
prisoners were sentenced to death, the offence for which they were
condemned being principally bushranging.</p>
<p>In 1827, the "Naval Officer," as the person who acted as
Collector of Customs was then called, was found to be a defaulter
to the tune of nearly &pound;14,000.</p>
<p>In September, 1828, the Bank of Australia, in George-street,
Sydney, was robbed of &pound;750 in British silver, 2,030 dollars,
&pound;14,500 worth of notes, and a large number of bills. The robbers
got into the bank by excavating from a house across the street.
This was the offence of which Blackstone made confession.</p>
<p>In 1834, two women, Sarah Macgregor and Mary Maloney, cruelly
murdered their master, Captain Waldron, to whom they were assigned
at Illawarra. They were tried and convicted, but were respited
until the pleasure of His Majesty was made known, when their
sentences were commuted to three years' imprisonment.</p>
<p>In the same year two lads named Lovett and Anderson were
returning from the races near Mount Rennie, when they discovered
the body of a man named James Hamilton. The man had been strangled
and his bowels ripped open. A convict named Kilmartin was
afterwards executed for the crime.</p>
<p>In 1839 a surgeon in Sydney was fined &pound;50 for illegal
dissection.</p>
<p>In April, 1854, Dr. Alexander Cuthill, a well-known and popular
medical practitioner in Sydney, was shot by a lunatic named Gray
while returning in his gig to town from Cook's River. He died from
the effects of the wound on the first of the following month. Gray
was tried and condemned to death, but his sentence was afterwards
commuted to fifteen years imprisonment, the first three in irons.
Dr. Cuthill left a legacy of &pound;10,000 to the Children's Destitute
Asylum, in Sydney, and the bulk of the money was expended in the
erection of the Asylum at Randwick.</p>
<p>A notorious criminal named "Captain" Neville, who was undergoing
a sentence of 32 years' penal servitude, headed the first outbreak
of prisoners at Williamstown (Vic.) in 1856. During the outbreak he
killed a boatman named Owens by striking him on the head with a
hammer. For this he was sentenced to death in Melbourne in
November, 1856, but the sentence was commuted, and he strangled
himself in gaol.</p>
<p>George Williams and Frank Britten were tried by special
commission at Darlinghurst for robbery of the Bathurst mail in
November 1862. On this occassion Arundel Everett was robbed of &pound;6
and Owen Malone of over &pound;900, the property of the Bank of New South
Wales. The men were sentenced to 15 years' hard labour, the first
year in irons.</p>
<p>In February, 1863, an attempt was made to rob the western escort
between Big and Little Hartley, by a party of five or six armed
men. They fired upon the coach as it reached a blockade of logs
which had been thrown across the road, shooting one of the horses
dead and slightly wounded Sergeant McClure. The attempt was not
successful, however, and the escort proceeded on its way after
being detained on the road for about half an hour.</p>
<p>A ticket-of-leave man named William Munday, alias Collins, in
1868, committed five brutal murders at Conroy's Gap, 16 miles from
Yass. He got up in the night and killed with an axe a shepherd, who
was sleeping in the hut with him. A man named Smith, who was
sleeping in a room on the opposite side of the hut, hearing the
noise, got up, but Munday quickly killed him with a pair of shears.
Mr. and Mrs. Conroy also heard the noise of the struggle and ran
into the room, and they also fell before the stroke of the shears.
Next morning a shepherd named White, who slept in a detached hut,
came over to Conroy's house, but he was met by Munday, who disabled
him with the shears and then struck him down with the axe. The
murderer afterwards confessed that he intended also murdering
Conroy's son, but he was absent that night and thus escaped. The
reason assigned by Munday for the murders was that he was badly
treated whilst in Conroy's employ as a shepherd. He was tried at
Goulburn and executed.</p>

close.</p>

<p>HOLT'S STORY&mdash;SIR HENRY HAYES&mdash;THE SNAKES OF
VAUCLUSE&mdash;A HORRIBLE SIGHT&mdash;GOVERNOR BOURKE'S REGULATIONS
RE FLOGGING&mdash;PROTESTS BY MAGISTRATES AND MASTERS&mdash;A FEW
RETURNS&mdash;RECORDS FROM BATHURST&mdash;THE "CAT" DESCRIBED.</p>
<p>NO better idea of what a flogging meant in the early days can be
given than is conveyed in the description furnished by Holt. Here
is his story:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We marched to Toongabbe, where all the government transports
were kept, who were called out to witness the punishment of the
prisoners. One man, Maurice Fitzgerald, was sentenced to receive
three hundred lashes, and the method of punishment was such as to
make it most effectual. The unfortunate man had his arms extended
round a tree, his two wrists tied with cords, and his breast
pressed closely to the tree, so that flinching from the blow was
out of the question, for it was impossible for him to stir. Father
Harold was ordered to put his hand against the tree by the hands of
the prisoner, and the two men were appointed to flog, namely,
Richard Rice, a left-handed man, and John Johnston, from Sydney,
who was right-handed. They stood on each side of Fitzgerald; and I
never saw two threshers in a barn move their flails with more
regularity than these two man-killers did, unmoved by pity, and
rather enjoying their employment than otherwise. The very first
blows made the blood spout from Fitzgerald's shoulders; and I felt
so disgusted and horrified that I turned my face away from the
cruel sight. One of the constables employed to carry into effect
this tremendous punishment, came up to me and desired me 'to look
on, at my peril.' I frowned at the monster with disdain, and told
him I would demolish him if he attempted to interfere with me. Mr.
Smith then advanced and asked the fellows who had gathered about me
what authority they had to take any notice of me; upon which they
walked off. I could only compare these wretches to a pack of hounds
at the death of a hare, or tigers who torment their victims before
they put them to death; and yet these fellows, I venture to assert,
were arrant cowards; for cowardice is always equal to
cruelty&mdash;fellows who dare not face a brave foe, but would cut
a submissive captive to mince-meat.</p>
<p>"I have witnessed many horrible scenes, but this was the most
appalling sight I have ever seen. The day was windy, and I protest,
that although I was at least fifteen yards to leeward from the
sufferers, the blood, skin and flesh blew in my face as the
executioners shook it off from their cats. Fitzgerald received his
whole three hundred lashes, during which Doctor Mason used to go up
to him occasionally to feel his pulse, it being contrary to law to
flog a man beyond fifty lashes without having a doctor present. I
never shall forget this humane doctor as he smiled and said 'Go on;
this man will tire you both before he fails.' During the time
Fitzgerald was receiving the punishment, he never uttered a groan;
the only words he said were 'Flog me fair! do not strike me on the
neck.' When it was over two constables took him by the arms to help
him into the cart. He said to them 'Let my arms go,' and struck
each of them in the pit of the stomach with his elbows, and knocked
them both down; he then stepped into the cart unassisted, as if he
had not received a blow. The doctor remarked, 'That man has
strength enough to bear two hundred more.'</p>
<p>"The next prisoner who was tied up was Paddy Galvin, a young lad
about twenty years of age; he was also sentenced to receive three
hundred lashes. The first hundred were given on his shoulders, and
he was cut to the bone between the shoulder blades, which were both
bare. The doctor then directed the next hundred to be inflicted
lower down, which reduced his flesh to such a jelly that the doctor
ordered him to have the remaining hundred on the calves of his
legs. During the whole time Galvin never even whimpered or
flinched, if, indeed, it had been possible for him to have done so.
He was asked 'where the pikes were hid;' Galvin answered that he
did not know, and that if he did, he would not tell. 'You may hang
me,' said he, 'if you like; but you shall have no music out of my
mouth to make others dance upon nothing.' He was put into the cart
and sent to the hospital. Three other men then received each one
hundred lashes, and they sang out lustily, from first to last. They
were all from the County of Cork, and lived near Sir Henry Browne
Hayes's."</p>
<p>The Sir Henry Hayes here referred to lived at Vaucluse, near the
entrance of Sydney Harbour, subsequently the residence of the late
Mr. W. C. Wentworth. He held the office of Sheriff in the city of
Cork, and was tried in 1801 for the abduction of Miss Pike, a
wealthy Quaker lady. His sentence was death, but it was afterwards
commuted to transportation for life, and hence his appearance in
the colony. The case created a great sensation at the time, in
consequence of the high station in life of the parties. For a long
time after the commission of the crime Sir Henry evaded capture,
and a large reward was offered for his apprehension. Grown weary of
hiding he one day entered the shop of a hairdresser in Cork, named
Coghlan, and said that as it was his intention to surrender
himself, Coghlan might get the reward by giving him up. In 1812 he
left the colony for Ireland, having received a pardon. Referring to
his case, Bennett says:&mdash;"There is a singular story current
respecting him which is implicitly believed by the more ignorant
part of the old colonists to the effect that finding his place at
Vaucluse much infested with snakes, and firmly believing that these
reptiles could not exist in Irish soil, he sent home for several
casks of that article, which he scattered over the place. His faith
in his native land and its patron saint was amply rewarded, for,
says the story, a snake has never been seen at Vaucluse, from that
time to this!"</p>
<p>But to come back to the subject of floggings. In every convict
centre&mdash;every ship, gaol, barracks, road or mountain stockade,
settlement or station&mdash;wherever human backs offered scope, the
lash was freely plied. Whether the floggings were severe or not
depended in great measure upon the temper and disposition of the
scourger, and upon the means of bribing him to "put it on light,"
possessed by the individual upon whom he had to operate. A novelist
of the school most given to blood-curdling details of crime in its
very worst aspects, could not wish for a better field for research,
sensational and thrilling incidents being his object, than the
earlier chapters of Australian history. And he need not travel
beyond the court-yards in the chief centres in his search for
sanguinary material; for here, in the olden time, horrors
indescribable furnished the food of those who were compelled to
attend them. Let me give one story which has already appeared in
print. It is told by the eye-witness of the scenes described, and
one of the chief convict settlements in the interior furnished
them, he being at the time on a visit to the court. On his way
thither he had to pass the triangles, which had been in use that
day; and he says:&mdash;"I saw a man walk across the yard with the
blood that had run from his lacerated flesh squashing out of his
shoes at every step he took. A dog was licking the blood off the
triangles, and the ants were carrying away great pieces of human
flesh that the lash had scattered about the ground. The scourger's
foot had worn a deep hole in the ground by the violence with which
he whirled himself round on it to strike the quivering and wealed
back, out of which stuck the sinews, white, ragged, and swollen.
The infliction was 100 lashes, at about half-minute time, so as to
extend the punishment through nearly an hour. The day was hot
enough to overcome a man merely standing that length of time in the
sun, and this was going on in the full blaze of it. However, they
had a pair of scourgers who gave each other spell and spell about,
and they were bespattered with blood like a couple of
butchers."</p>
<p>Whatever else the magistrates and masters and overseers omitted,
they were most active in ordering and applying the lash. The
whistle of the cat's tails through the air made their music, and
their sleep would have been uneasy had their ears not heard the
sound of the victim's cries at some period of the day. The flogging
period was at its worst when Governor Bourke arrived, and he at
once set to work to curb the blood-thirsty propensities of the
class most given to the use of the lash. An Act was passed for
restraining magistrates from ordering more than 50 lashes to their
convict servants; but the humane Governor's attempts to assuage
suffering and preserve a measure of justice met with stout
resistance from the men who for many years had exercised full sway.
In 1834 a number of land-owners and magistrates in the Hunter River
and other districts petitioned the King, over the head of Governor
Bourke, on the subject of punishments awarded and inflicted upon
offending convicts, complaining that the Governor had passed new
regulations restricting the number of lashes, and modifying the
character of the "cat," to the injury of the masters and the
encouragement of disobedience in the convicts.</p>
<p>His Excellency replied to this in a strong despatch, and
furnished statistics from Police Magistrates and others who
witnessed the floggings, in proof of his contention that 50 lashes
were sometimes too many to give to offenders, much more 100. Here
are a few of the returns furnished to his Excellency:&mdash;</p>
<p>"John Green, absconding, 50 lashes. Appeared to suffer much,
bled freely, and fainted after punishment.</p>
<p>"William Truelove, neglect of duty, 50 lashes. Bled greatly and
appeared faint and exhausted.</p>
<p>"Calvin Sampson, stealing, 50 lashes. Blood flowed at the 4th;
the convict cried out at the 18th and continued crying for
succeeding lashes; his skin was terribly torn and blood flowed
during the whole of the punishment. This man groaned much and
prayed while suffering punishment; and afterwards declared that he
would never come again. I am of opinion that he was sufficiently
punished at the 25th lash.</p>
<p>"Daniel Alone, neglecting duty, 50 lashes. Cried loudly at the
second and repeated his cries at every lash; at the 12th blood
flowed largely, and the prisoner seemed to suffer intense agony. I
am of opinion that this man was sufficiently punished at the 25th
lash.</p>
<p>"John Denning, neglect of duty, 25 lashes. Cried out at the
first lash and continued crying loudly. At the 6th the flesh was
lacerated considerably, blood was drawn but did not flow. It is my
decided opinion he was sufficiently punished, and that the number
of lashes this man suffered had as much effect as 100 lashes would
have had.</p>
<p>"William Robinson, drunk and making away with part of his dress,
50 lashes. He cried out at every lash; the skin was lacerated at
the 12th; the blood appeared at the 20th; the man suffered intense
agony. Twenty lashes would have been an ample warning to him.</p>
<p>"David Hennan, stolen property in possession, 50 lashes. Had
been flogged 12 months before; he flinched much, but neither cried
nor spoke.</p>
<p>"William Smith, insolent, &amp;c., 50 lashes. This man was
flogged two years ago; he flinched much throughout the punishment;
the skin was lacerated and the blood appeared at the 24th lash; he
seemed to suffer great pain, evinced by his suppressed groans;
blood ran at the 45th lash; he cried out "domino!" when
finished.</p>
<p>And so on through a list of nearly 200, the magistrate in whose
presence the floggings were given attesting the record. Among the
scourged were a number of boys, and this is the record concerning
one of them:&mdash;"Edward Scandrake, feigning sickness, 25 lashes.
He received 50 lashes last Monday week, but was never flogged
before; his breech was sore from the last punishment; blood came at
the first stroke; he screamed dreadfully at every lash, blood
streaming from the old wounds; complained bitterly of the treatment
at Carter's Barrack's (Mudie's place) and wished someone would
examine into it; indeed, all the Carter's boys make the same
complaint."</p>
<p>Among others came the following return from Bathurst:</p>
<p>"Police Office, Bathurst, October 3rd, 1833</p>
<p>"Sir,&mdash;With reference to your letter of 29th August, on the
subject of corporal punishments by order of the court of petty
sessions, wherein I am directed to superintend the punishments for
the month of the September, and to report thereon, I do myself the
honour to transmit the monthly return, with my remarks made at the
time, from personal observation; and in accordance with the latter
part of your communication, beg to add, that the standard
instrument (which was used in every case) in size and weight, when
applied with sufficient force would be perfectly adequate to the
purposes required, if a little more attention was paid to the
manufacture thereof. I have noticed that the extremities of the
cord speedily become loose and open, from the very slight manner in
which they have been secured; this ought to be remedied, and the
cord generally twisted tighter, otherwise the amount of bodily
injury inflicted by bruising will be greater than intended, and
that by laceration less. It does not appear to me that effusion of
blood is a certain criterion whereby to determine the extent of
bodily injury endured from scourging. The mode of counting and
taking due time between each lash has always been practised
here.</p>
<p>"I have the honor, &amp;c.</p>
<p>THOMAS EVERNDEN, J.P.</p>
<p>"Superintendent of Police.</p>
<p>"The Hon. The Colonial Secretary."</p>
<p>"Return of corporal punishment inflicted by order of the Court
of Petty Sessions at Bathurst, from 1st to 30th September, 1833,
inclusively in the presence of Thomas Evernden, Esq., J.P.,
Superintendent of Police.</p>
<p>"1. John Murphy, ship Hercules, destroying his master's
property, 50 lashes. Circular not received at this date.</p>
<p>"2. William Powell, Lady Harewood, absent without leave, 50
lashes. Ditto, ditto.</p>
<p>"3. James White, Albion, insubordination and absent without

<p>"20 Robert Burns, Eliza, neglect of duty and disobedience, 25
lashes. Bruised, ditto, ditto.</p>
<p>"N.B.&mdash;The above punishments were all properly
inflicted."</p>
<p>The flogging instruments used at this time were marked with the
regulation stamp. The handle was about 2 feet long; there were five
lashes of whipcord, each lash having six or seven knots; and the
whole of the magistrates and superintendents who were appealed to
reported that the weapon was sufficiently heavy to do the cutting
work required&mdash;one man declaring that he never superintended
any flogging but what the skin was cut in the fourth blow. Yet
these precious slave drivers wished for heavier strokes and more of
them!</p>
<p>From this time forward until the break up of the convict system
there was a manifest improvement; but no one can glance at the old
records and remain in doubt concerning the potency of the
"cat-o'-nine-tails" as an instrument of torture in the hands of the
men to whom the administration of justice meant no more nor less
than the infliction of heaviest punishment for slightest
offices.</p>

<p>A BLOODY LIST&mdash;HANGING RECORD FOR THREE YEARS&mdash;BLESSED
REDUCTION&mdash;FROM 17 YEARS TO 70&mdash;THE TREE STILL
STANDING.</p>
<p>IT is perhaps a fortunate thing that the earlier records of
executions lived only in the memories of the First Fleeters. The
list if preserved would have been a most bloody one, and we may be
thankful that the dark curtain of forgetfulness has been drawn over
the picture that was never committed to paper. The records that do
stand relating to later days, are all too dark and horrible to find
place here, but the totals of three of the intermediate years
between the beginning and the end of the century may be given, as
they will furnish some slight idea of the important part the
hangman played in the administration of justice.</p>
<p>In 1826 there were executed in the penal colonies of Australia
53 criminals; in 1827 there were 50; and in 1828 there were
50&mdash;being an annual average of one man in every thousand of
the population, which at that time did not number more than 50,000
souls. But with the cessation of transportation the average began
to drop, and it is pleasing to read that during the years 1856-7-8
(the first years of responsible government) only five capital
sentences were carried out in New South Wales.</p>
<p>The following is one black leaf which the reader who desires to
know the worst may just glance over before he passes on:&mdash;</p>
<p>In 1815, a convict named Styles was executed at Sydney for the
murder of Thomas Roberts.</p>
<p>In 1827, an aboriginal of the Bathurst district named Black
Tommy was executed in Sydney for murder.</p>
<p>In 1829 John Holmes was executed in Sydney for setting fire to a
barn belonging to James Bein.</p>
<p>In 1830 a young desperado named Tierny, aged only 17 years, was
executed in Sydney. When on the scaffold he threw the executioner
with himself to the ground; the former being much bruised by the
fall could scarcely be persuaded to finish his task.</p>
<p>A soldier of the 39th Regiment, named Brennan, was shot at
Dawes' Battery, Sydney, under Court Martial sentence, on April 6th,
1832.</p>
<p>In May, 1834, Kilmartin, a convict, was executed in Sydney for
murder. In the same year John Jenkins and Thomas Tattersdale were
executed in Sydney for the murder of the famous Dr. Wardell.</p>
<p>From the year 1828 to 1837 the number of criminals executed in
the colony was 327. Of these 65 were free, and 262 bond. The
religion of the free thus disposed of is set down as: Protestants
26; Roman Catholics, 36; Pagan, 2; one being an aboriginal. Of the
convicts executed 122 were set down as Protestants, 138 as Roman
Catholics, and 2 as uncertain.</p>
<p>In 1839 there were executed in Sydney:&mdash;William Morris, for
murder; Joseph Saunders and Peter Scullion, for murder and robbery;
George Carey, for having stolen property in his possession; George
Gorman and Alexander Telford, for murder; James Davis, Llewellen
Powell, James Lynch, and Charles Clipp, for murder; and Archibald
Taylor, for felony.</p>
<p>In 1840 there were executed in Sydney:&mdash;John Hunt for
murder; Thomas Whitton, for murder and arson; Enoch Bradley, for
murder; Thomas Legg, for rape; William Newman and James Martin, for
murder; James Mason, for being accessory to murder; and Micheal
Hinnigan, for murder.</p>
<p>In 1841 Michael Bradley was executed for murder at Newcastle;
Patrick Curran, a notorious bushranger, was executed at Sydney, for
the murder of an overseer; and George Stroud and Robert Hudson were
executed at Berrima, for murder.</p>
<p>In 1842, Patrick Clearham suffered death at Berrima, as also did
John Lynch, alias Dunleary, for the murder of Londregan. The
last-named criminal confessed that he had committed eight other
murders. Martin Beech and Lucretia Dunkley were also executed at
Berrima, for murder, and Thomas Horner, for the same crime was
executed at Newcastle.</p>
<p>In 1843, there were executed at Newcastle:&mdash;George Wilson,
for shooting with intent; George Forrester, for murder; Melville,
Harry and Therramitable (three aboriginals), for murder.</p>
<p>In 1844, four murderers were hanged at Port Macquarie, their
names being Benjamin Harris, Mary Thornton, Joseph Vale and
Benjamin Stanley. John Knatchbull was executed in Sydney for the
murder of Mrs. Jameson, and Henry Atkins, for murder, at
Berrima.</p>
<p>In 1845, John Viddal, John Abearn and James Fitzpatrick, for
murder, the two former in Sydney and the latter in Newcastle.</p>
<p>In 1846, William Shea suffered for murder at Newcastle.</p>
<p>In 1848, Patrick Ryan suffered at the same place for murder.
Charles Henry Machie was executed for rape at Bathurst on November
10th of the same year.</p>
<p>Nearly every subsequent year furnished its victims for the
gallows, and at the present day the rope and the executioner still
form part of the punitive machinery of the State. Even the
strongest public protests cannot secure the abolishment of capital
punishment.</p>

THREEFOLD EMANCIPATION.</p>
<p>THOSE convicts who obtained an absolute or conditional pardon,
or who had become free by the expiration of their sentences, were
termed "emancipists" or "expirees." It will be remembered that when
Governor Phillip publicly addressed the convicts who came out with
him in the First Fleet, shortly after the landing, he pointed out
to them that their well-being in the future rested entirely with
themselves&mdash;that in a new land, under new conditions, and
separated by broad seas from all the old vicious associations which
had surrounded them when they made the false step which led to
their transportation, they would have abundant opportunity of
making good history, as individuals and as a class. Similar advice
was given at different times by succeeding Governors to the
prisoners upon their entry into the "land of exile," and the words
of advice and encouragement thus offered did not fall upon
unheeding ears, although, as the darker pages of this history
testify, thousands of the criminals who heard them became more
criminal, giving full play to every evil propensity of their
nature, and from choice or compulsion becoming tenfold more
"children of hell" in the new land than they were in the old.</p>
<p>Under a proper plan of treatment, such as that which would have
been followed had all Governors who ruled been of the temper and
disposition of that really good man, Governor Phillip, and if the
authorities across the sea had received better instruction and
advice from their officials here, reformation would have been a
general rather than a singular thing. But if the authorities in
England had the slightest idea of reforming the criminals by
transporting and treating them as they were transported and
treated, the experiment failed most egregiously. One gentleman of
large experience when giving evidence before the Select Committee
of the House of Commons in 1835, said: "Reformation, at all events,
if that be one object of punishment, is on the present plan
hopeless; in the existing state of things, nearly all the
tendencies of the plan are the other way." Another gentleman said;
"By transportation the prisoners are all made bad men instead of
good; it is shewn by official reports that scarcely any are
reformed; and human nature does not stand still&mdash;if not
improved, it gets worse."</p>
<p>I have already shewn, in an imperfect way, how in thousands of
cases "good men were made bad, and bad men worse," by the treatment
to which they were subjected on the voyage out and after their
arrival. The "discipline" tended directly to degradation all along
the lines, whether being enforced in the ship's hold, in the
convict barracks, in the chain gangs, at the penal settlements, or
under the assignment system. It will be a slight relief to turn for
a short time to the contemplation of whatever little good came out
of this gigantic evil, although we cannot overlook the fact that
that good arose, not out of the system pursued, but in spite of
it.</p>
<p>At the expiration of the "time" to which the convicts had been
sentenced, their freedom was obtained and they were at liberty
either to return to England or to settle in the colony. This was
the regulation, but it was not always carried out, the official
records being so faulty in some cases that doubts concerning the
time at which the sentence expired could not be settled until word
could be received from the Home office. But a delay of a year, or
even two, did not trouble the Colonial authorities much, whatever
trouble it may have brought to the individual most concerned. If
the liberated convict elected to remain in the colony he received a
grant of land&mdash;40 acres if unmarried, and if married a portion
for his wife and each child. Tools and stock from the Government
stores were also loaned to him, and victuals for eighteen months.
How many substantial "inheritances" have been built up in this way
it would be difficult to say; but if the men who obtained their
freedom did not succeed in making themselves comfortable and wiping
out the stain of previous wrong-doing the fault was all their own,
especially those of them who lived in Governor Macquarie's time,
when every assistance was afforded them to rise in the social
scale.</p>
<p>The advantages given to men who served their sentences were also
extended to those who were pardoned or emancipated by the Governor.
The Governor possessed the power, as we have already seen, of
granting absolute or conditional pardon, and not a few favours were
bestowed on individuals to whom favour ought not to have been
shewn. In some years as many as 150 pardons were granted to
convicts immediately on their landing, without reference to their
characters or merits. A popularity-hunting Governor possessed
splendid opportunities of bagging the game he sought.</p>
<p>Many convicts&mdash;and especially those who had been
transported for trifling offences&mdash;as soon as they became free
by servitude or received a pardon, at once set about the work of
building up good reputations, a task which many of them
accomplished so successfully that in after years they were found
the honoured heads of respectable families, living lives of
uprightness, honesty and purity, patterns of goodness to many of
their fellows who made a boast of their virtues and claimed
superiority by reason of their having had a better birthright and
having come to the colony at their own free will. The colony owes a
great deal to the thrift and industry, the perseverance and
unselfishness and public spirit of these men and their descendants,
who, spite of sneers and insults and injury from the "pure
merinos," steadily worked their way upwards until they had redeemed
the past and won for themselves places of honour which many of
their fellows more favorably circumstanced had failed to reach.</p>
<p>But wealth could not then be taken as an evidence of virtue any
more than it can now. Among the emancipists, as early as 1835, were
to be found some individuals who had attained to great wealth. One
is said to have made as much as &pound;40,000 a year. The emancipists who
acquired wealth thus early generally commenced their career by
keeping public houses, then lending money on mortgage, then
obtaining landed property and large herds, the latter consisting
for the most part of stolen cattle which they had purchased. As a
case in point Dr. Lang mentions that of an individual whose yearly
income was something enormous. He had been transported about the
end of the last century for stealing geese on the commons of
Yorkshire. He began his career as a prisoner in the employment of
Government, building the gaol at Parramatta. At that time rum was
allowed to convicts, but he was a temperate man, and sold his
ration of spirits, thus accumulating some money. When he became
free he was able to set up a public house and keep a horse and
gig&mdash;the height of respectability in those day's. On one
occasion a female emancipist, who also had amassed money, engaged
him to drive her to Parramatta from Sydney, and this led to an
acquaintance which resulted in marriage, and the united property of
the united pair became something very large. At the period referred
to there was no regular market in Sydney. The farmers brought their
loads of wheat and other produce to the town, and made exchanges
with persons who paid them partly in money and partly in
commodities that they required. The farmers were chiefly
emancipists, who had obtained grants of land near Windsor, and who
were as a body an ignorant and dissolute lot. They mostly
frequented the house of the emancipist mentioned, where they would
remain drunk for days, unconscious of what they had spent or given
away. When recovered from their "bout" they were frequently charged
by their host a sum far exceeding their means of payment. Credit
was always given, however, on condition that the debtor would sign
a warrant of attorney, a stock of which warrants, ready filled up,
was kept on hand. These instruments were drawn up by convicts, for
in those days amongst that class only could be found persons
qualified to perform the duties of the legal profession. When the
farmers were once in the spider's nest, the rest was easy. They
were obliged to visit him always and deal with him, and when their
debt had sufficiently increased he dispossessed them of their
estates, and by this means at one time held a great proportion of
the cultivated land in the yet young colony. And this man was but
the type of many, whose biggest stock-in-trade were the rum-cask
and the pocket-screw. The greater portion of the emancipist class,
however, in earlier years, were labourers and small shopkeepers. If
they were industrious they had every opportunity of making an
honest living; but the majority retained their habits of profligacy
and became even more worthless and dissipated than they were as
Government servants or assignees. They were the cattle-stealers,
the receivers of stolen goods, the keepers of sly-grog shops, and
the "squatters" of the early days&mdash;for the term "squatter" had
a different meaning then.</p>
<p>It was Governor Macquarie who originated the emancipist party.
He acted on the principle that the colony was founded for the sake
of convicts, and not for emigrants, and endeavoured, therefore, to
introduce the wealthier emancipists into the society of his
officers, clergy and other "respectable" inhabitants of the colony,
even going so far as to make magistrates of some of them. And, let
the truth be known, many of them were better qualified to be
magistrates, better qualified to be clergy (if morals count many
points in the qualification), and better entitled to the term
"respectable" than some of those then occupying such positions, and
who turned up their eyes in holy horror at Governor Macquarie's
action. The party was a strong one, numbering in 1834 between
15,000 and 16,000, while the free population did not much exceed
21,000; and of the latter number a considerable portion were
probably connected, either by parentage or marriage, with persons
who had been prisoners of the Crown.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to give a connected story of the
struggle in which the emancipists were compelled to engage to
secure a recognition of their legal rights and civil status. During
the decade 1810-1820 a fierce battle raged between the settlers and
military attachments or offshoots, on the one hand, and the
<i>freed</i> convicts&mdash;the emancipists&mdash;on the other, and
if the latter had been one thousandth part as vile as they were
made out to be by the former, there would have been left on record
an account of a battle between two contending forces in which
arguments had been pointed with steel, or clinched by powder and
shot. It was fortunate, indeed, for the free settlers that the men
upon whom they looked with eyes so full of scorn and upon whom they
heaped so many insults were subject to reason rather than passion;
otherwise there had been much violence and bloodshed.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarie, from the first year of his arrival (1809)
appears to have set himself to the task of repressing the influx of
free settlers and encouraging the emancipists, his desire being to
raise up from among this latter class, whose numbers were ever
increasing, a powerful army of friends. He could not forget how his
predecessor had been deposed by a few wealthy
military-<i>cum</i>-civil colonists, and knew perfectly well that
he could only rely upon their friendship while he sliced the public
cake amongst them; hence, he turned to the other class, and erred
on the other side by giving many of them favours which they did not
deserve, and which in many cases wrought evil instead of good. It
had been the practice of former governors to give grants of land to
those only of the freed persons whose characters were good, but he
is said to have bestowed farms upon all whose sentences had
expired, without discrimination; and many of these men soon got rid
of the land thus given, exchanging it for a few quartz of rum to
their more "canny" neighbours. Others, however, made good use of
their opportunities, and by patient industry and perseverance,
continued to add to their possessions, quietly won the favour and
respect of those by whom they were surrounded, and prepared
themselves for discharging all the obligations of good citizenship.
These men found in Macquarie a good and powerful friend. He fought
for them and showed them how to fight&mdash;on the land, in the
market, in the Court, and even at the seat of Government across the
sea.</p>
<p>One of the most pronounced and effective blows which Macquarie
made at the wealthy free colonists and their military friends was
the elevation of emancipated convicts of moderate ability and good
character to the magisterial bench. The first emancipist raised by
him to this position was Andrew Thompson, who died shortly after
his appointment. It will be remembered that it was in answer to an
objection to this man's elevation that Macquarie made the cutting
remark that there were only two classes in the colony for him to
choose from when looking for possible magistrates&mdash;those who
had been transported and those who ought to have been.</p>
<p>The breach between the wealthy free settlers and the emancipists
was made still wider by Macquarie making a second appointment of
the same kind although the act was not by any means an ill-advised
one, the emancipist raised to the magistracy on that occasion being
Mr. Redfern, a surgeon, whose character was of the highest. But he
had been a convict. He had been transported when quite a youth, for
having shewn sympathy with the seamen at the mutiny of the Nore, he
being at the time assistant-surgeon in one of the ships of the
fleet. He was a young man of spirit and spoke out about the wrongs
of the seamen. His utterances were "reported" to his superiors, who
accused him of complicity with the mutineers. He was placed upon
his trial, found guilty, and sentenced to death; but that sentence
was afterwards commuted to transportation for life, and shortly
after he reached Sydney he commenced the practice of his
profession. Though a convict he was a gentleman still, and after
his emancipation he lived as a power for good in a community where
goodness was a somewhat scarce commodity. It was his misfortune to
be punished as an example, at a time of great national excitement,
for an offence which under ordinary circumstances would scarcely
have been noticed at all. But when Macquarie appointed him to the
magistracy, the "Pure Merinos" who occupied the seats of honour
were like to burst with the swelling of offended dignity. They
could not gainsay Redfern's ability; they could not question his
honesty; they could not deny that in conduct he had been all that a
gentleman ought to be; but he had been forced for a time to mix
with "scabby" sheep&mdash;he was an emancipist, and their stainless
garments must not be soiled by contact with such as he! Redfern
served as a magistrate, nevertheless, and if any damage resulted
from the commingling of the pure with the impure, it all fell upon
him.</p>
<p>The better disposed and more intelligent members of the
emancipist class, when they found that they had each a strong
partisan in the Governor, began to claim privileges which had
hitherto been denied to them as a body. Whatever they may have
been, they were now free men, and they determined to enforce their
claims to all that other free men enjoyed. Up to this time (about
1814) very few, if any, members of the legal profession had looked
towards Botany Bay as a likely field for remunerative employment,
and most of the legal work between contending parties had been done
by emancipist attorneys&mdash;for, marvellous to relate, in those
early days it was possible for even attorneys to be criminal! When
the lawyers who had been transported had gained their freedom they
became useful members of colonial society. The courts of Justice in
the colony up to the year 1812 were those which had been
established under the authority of 27 George III, at the foundation
of the settlement; the members (or jury) of the court being six
military officers, with a judge-advocate, or his deputy, presiding.
The officers composing the court were nominated by the Governor,
and the court could only assemble on his summons. The method of
procedure was as follows:&mdash;The prosecutor conducted his own
case and the witnesses were heard in open court. In all cases the
verdict of five out of the seven members of the court was taken,
the judge-advocate deliberating with the jury in secret and
delivering their verdict when the doors were opened. Under such
circumstances, who can wonder that there should be more military
law than "even-handed justice." In 1812, however, a Parliamentary
inquiry into the state of the colony was held, arising out of the
circumstances connected with Bligh's deposition, and the complaints
which were made to the British Government concerning the avarice
and cruelty of the New South Wales Corps and their friends. The
outcome of this inquiry was the issue of a new charter of justice
which called two courts into existence, termed the Governor's Court
and the Supreme Court. The first was simply a modification of the
old court, and consisted of a judge-advocate and two assessors,
nominees of the Governor, its jurisdiction being restricted to
civil causes in which the property in dispute did not exceed &pound;50.
The Supreme Court consisted of a judge, appointed under the King's
sign manual, with two magistrates as assistants or assessors,
appointed by the Governor. This court had all the powers incident
to a court of record, and could nominate its own officers and
clerks. It possessed a three-fold jurisdiction&mdash;an ordinary,
an equity, and an ecclesiastical&mdash;being empowered to
administer justice in accordance with the rules and practices of
the Court of Chancery in England.</p>
<p>The first judge of this Supreme Court was Jeffrey H. Bent, who
arrived in the colony with his commission in 1814, but it was not
until May, 1815, that the court was formally established, and when
it was established it could not operate practically on account of
Bent's antipathy to the emancipist attorneys, who, as I have said,
were the only available "advocates" in the colony. When the Supreme
Court was established a number of these attorneys, who had become
free by servitude, claimed the right to practice in it, and
Governor Macquarie supported their claim. They formally petitioned
the Governor on this behalf, and when the judge was about to open
the court the attorneys presented to him a letter from the Governor
strongly recommending that they should be allowed to practice in
the court. But the judge pulled down the ears of his wig and
refused to listen, although the two assessors (who had been
appointed by the Governor) were favourable to granting the prayer
of the petitioners. The judge then delivered his soul on the
subject and concluded an offensive address to the court in the
following words;&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is with considerable regret I have to state, that the undue
steps resorted to with regard to these petitioners have in some
degree prevailed, and that gentlemen have been found who have
thought proper to differ from me on a point of pure professional
feeling and practice, and to say that those persons, whom they
confess it is a disgrace to admit to their tables or to suffer any
part of their families to associate with, are fit and proper
persons to be admitted to the situation of attorney in his
Majesty's Supreme Court, notwithstanding gentlemen have been sent
out by the Crown for that purpose. I do now solemnly declare that I
will not admit as attorneys of this Court, nor administer the oaths
to persons who have been transported here as felons. It is contrary
to law, and no circumstances and no necessity can exist so strong,
in my mind, as to induce me to do it."</p>
<p>There was, undoubtedly, a good deal of "professional feeling" in
the matter, so far as Judge Bent was concerned, and the assessors
and the judge at once began to argue the point with considerable
heat, the result being that the court adjourned <i>sine die</i>
before any business had been transacted. The Governor then took the
matter to head quarters. He wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Colonies (Earl Bathurst), and contended that Judge Bent's action
was an unjustifiable interference with the policy which guided his
administration, and with the salutary measures he had initiated in
the colony for the reformation of the convicts, Earl Bathurst
upheld the Governor in the stand he had taken, and the high-toned
judge was peremptorily told to vacate his position and recross the
seas. In the despatch recalling him, Judge Bent had the
satisfaction of hearing that his conduct had evoked "the high
displeasure of his Royal Highness," and that his conduct "could
admit of no justification." Thus Macquarie gained another victory
on behalf of the emancipists.</p>
<p>Speaking of this quarrel, Commissioner Bigge, in his report on
the state of the colony, remarks as follows concerning the position
taken up by the emancipists:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have detailed, more at length, the events to which this
question has given rise, because they will enable your lordship to
form a more accurate view of the manner in which it has affected
the situation of the emancipated convicts, and to account for those
feelings which now separate them from the free classes. Those of
the former have been greatly excited. Their ambition has been
encouraged by the manner in which their conduct, as well as their
exertions, have been viewed and rewarded by Governor Macquarie. The
same feelings have been disappointed and exasperated by the events
of the late trials to which I have adverted; and no compromise is
now to be expected, as long as they are left in a state of
uncertain dependence upon the discretionary power of any individual
for the enjoyments of the rights to which they have considered
themselves entitled. Both parties look upon each other as
intruders. The free settlers considering that the rank, as well as
the rights, of the emancipated convicts should be always kept in
subordination to their own; while the emancipated convicts look
upon no title to property to be so good or so just as that which
has been derived through the several gradations of crime,
conviction, service, emancipation, and grant. Both parties are
equally disposed to depreciate the pretensions of each other, but I
sincerely believe that the great body of the emancipated convicts
do not partake of the ambition of their leaders; that they would be
satisfied with protection from oppression and insults and due
encouragement in their undertakings; and that they feel great
indifference about their admission either to public offices, or to
any other rank in society than that which their own industry and
good character will justly and naturally procure for them. In the
encouragement of marriage amongst the convicts, Governor Macquarie
has shewn the most anxious disposition to improve their morals and
condition; and in admitting them to society, if his selection does
not appear to have been the most judicious, or his mode of
introducing them the most successful, he has certainly had to
contend with prejudices of a very powerful kind in the free
population. These prejudices are now, I fear, too deeply fixed to
be removed; and the ambitious feelings of the higher classes of
emancipated convicts have been too long encouraged and cherished to
expect from them either submission or conciliation. Governor
Macquarie has thus left to his successor the difficult, and I may
even add the hopeless, task of bringing back to their proper and
just standard the pretentions of two large classes of the
inhabitants of New South Wales, without giving to the one party a
supposed ground of triumph, and without inflicting upon the other
too large a measure of vexation and disgrace."</p>
<p>This testimony was as near the centre point of just balance as
could be expected from a man whose sympathies were naturally with
the men under whose mahogany (or cedar) he was accustomed to place
his feet. There must have been some virtue in the emancipists as a
class to have drawn anything but condemnation from an official who
was everlastingly being button-holed and ear-wigged by their deadly
foes. But truth will force its way sometimes even through channels
that are half-choked by prejudice. It did so in this case.</p>
<p>The struggle in which the emancipists engaged, endeavouring to
secure a recognition of their claims to the privileges of free
citizenship, and to establish their legal rights and civil status,
extended over a long period. Judge Bent was superseded by Mr.
Barron Field, also an English barrister, but it was a case, as far
as the emancipists were concerned, of "out of the frying-pan into
the fire." He was sent to heal the wounds of the disturbed body
politic; but he put his official fingers into the worst of them and
made them deeper and wider and more painful. He was sent to
conciliate; but he created greater disaffection. One of his first
decisions after entering upon his official duties was that a
defendant would be allowed to plead a plaintiff's conviction for
felony many years previously in England as a bar to a civil action.
This was a legal doctrine quite in keeping with the disjointed
times, and amounted to this, that a man who had been convicted at
any time of a felony was never thereafter to be allowed civil
rights; that even after he had atoned for his offence by serving
the full sentence passed upon him by law he had no right to demand
common justice if any other man wronged him in his person or
property or reputation&mdash;that he could not recover a debt or
resist an unjust claim. It was a beautiful doctrine, but the
emancipists could not see any beauty in it. By some strange freak
of nature they had come to think that having expiated their crime
in suffering&mdash;the crime itself, perhaps, being very light, and
the punishment very heavy&mdash;no man had any right to cast their
former offences and sufferings in their teeth; and that they were
entitled to equal rights and privileges with other citizens. Queer
mortals were these emancipists&mdash;in Judge Field's opinion; they
ought never to have been released from chains when once those
chains had been rivetted. If Judge Field had taken the trouble to
inquire he would have discovered that many of these emancipists
were wealthy and respectable men, ordering themselves and their
households in a manner which the wealthy free classes might have
copied with advantage to themselves and the growing colony. He
might have learned also that the majority of the trading,
mechanical, agricultural and grazing sections of the community were
emancipists; and that a large proportion of them were honest, sober
and industrious. But he did not inquire, or if he did he shut both
ears when the answer was given, and would not listen; therefore he
sought to shut them out from all rights and privileges, and to
condemn them to perpetual bondage and disgrace.</p>
<p>Then the emancipists began to work in earnest. They petitioned
the Provost-Marshal to call a public meeting in order to decide on
what steps should be taken to enable them to obtain relief from
their legal disabilities. The meeting was held, and was conducted
in a very loyal and orderly manner; and the following resolutions
were adopted:&mdash;"1. That, by the humane and benevolent policy
of Governor Macquarie&mdash;a policy hitherto sanctioned by the
mother country&mdash;the emancipated colonists had been encouraged
and protected, had created and acquired, and were now possessed of,
the larger moiety of the property of the colony, and were becoming
the middle class of society therein (they might with justice have
laid claim to higher station). 2. That from the establishment of
the colony up to April, 1820, it had been held and acted upon, that
persons arriving in the colony, under sentence of transportation,
and afterwards obtaining their pardon, either by service of the
term or otherwise, might acquire and possess landed and other
property, and enjoy all the civil rights of free citizens. 3. That
by a late determination of the Court of Queen's Bench, in England,
and acted upon lately in the Courts of Civil jurisdiction in the
colony, whereby it had been declared that conditional and absolute
pardons granted by governors of the colonies were of no effect to
the parties holding them, in restoring them to the legal enjoyment
or exercise of any civil right, until their names should have been
inserted in some general pardon under the great seal of England,
the vital interests of the emancipated colonists had been exposed
to infinite prejudice and danger, and their restoration to their
rights as citizens protracted beyond the period that either justice
or policy could require. 4. That this state of the law, in its
consequences, also affected a very considerable part of the
property of the emigrant colonist, because the titles to a
considerable portion of the property possessed by the emigrant
class had been derived through and from the emancipists. 5. That
the meeting, taking all these things into consideration, resolves
to address the Throne and Parliament by petition, humbly praying
for such relief as their situation and circumstances might, in the
wisdom of the Sovereign and the justice of the British Parliament,
seem to merit at their hands."</p>
<p>The resolutions were forceful, being based upon truth and
justice. Governor Macquarie espoused the cause of the petitioners,
and demanded that the Home Government should afford them justice,
at the same time denouncing the characters and conduct of the free
settlers who were standing between them and their rights. This is
how he spoke of the latter in one despatch:&mdash;"A few free
settlers had certainly honoured the country so far as to establish
themselves in it; they accepted land and stock from the government;
these they had taken care to increase, and by disposing of the meat
at the public store, and by trafficking with the convicts and
others, had become possessed of property to a large amount; but it
was only lately these gentlemen had commenced cultivation; nor was
the government yet indebted to them for any assistance in the
supply of grain, but in so small a proportion as to be unworthy of
notice." This was written in 1820, and the governor shewed that at
that time the emancipists had 92,618 acres of land under
cultivation, and owned 40,643 head of horned cattle and 221,079
sheep.</p>
<p>This strong advocacy of Governor Macquarie bore good fruit. The
legal barriers between the two classes were broken and the
emancipists entered upon the enjoyment of rights which other free
men in the colony possessed. But the removal of the social barrier
which separated the two classes was a different matter. However
frequently they might be compelled to come together in public and
commercial life, the wealthy free settlers and the officers and
ex-officers were determined that the emancipists should not come
within the circle of their private domain. But every day added to
the number, wealth and strength of the emancipists; and when, a few
years later, with the assistance of the free immigrants and
settlers who were as sick of officialdom and a Brummagem
aristocracy as the convicts were who had suffered so much at their
hands, they moved together in one solid phalanx to break down
oppressive rule and bring in full freedom, they succeeded beyond
their expectations.</p>
<p>The exciting story of the successful struggle of the emancipists
to obtain popular rights and privileges must be read elsewhere. It
is sufficient here to say that before the last batch of convicts
who landed in the colony had completed their sentences, the earlier
emancipists or their descendants were scarcely known as a distinct
class; and in later years not a few of them were found occupying
chief places in the private, social, and public life of the colony,
with credit to themselves and benefit to the land which called them
citizens. In time the old lines which existed were swept away, and
the descendants of the exclusivists vied with the descendants of
the emancipists for places of honour in every department of public
life, and whether success or failure attended their efforts, no man
dare taunt them with having sprung from those "patriots" who were
said to have "left their country for their country's good." They
have occupied seats on the judicial bench; at the bar and in the
Legislature their voices have been heard; they have done good
service in the pulpit, on the press, and in the extensive field of
commerce. Every door was open to them if they possessed the desire
to enter; and provided they possessed the qualifications of
personal merit, and ability for the work to be done, the public did
not care to ask whether their sprang from men who came out free or
from men who had been transported, and to whom, in the words of
Governor Macquarie, "New South Wales owed its existence as a
colony." And to-day these questions are not asked, the worth of
every man being measured by what he is himself, and not by what his
father or his grandfather was before him. Who is there will say
that any wrong has been done by following this rule in the past, or
that any wrong will result from following it in the future?</p>
<p>Speaking of the reformation of convicts Judge Therry
says&mdash;and every word he wrote on this subject bears the
impress of truth:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Notwithstanding the terrors of Norfolk Island, and the dreadful
exhibitions of crime in our Supreme and Criminal Courts, it is
satisfactory to be enabled to testify that amongst the thousands
transported to New South Wales many became reformed and really good
men. This reformation was mostly observable in that class of
convicts who were sent out for offences that did not partake of the
character of base crime, such as burglaries, highway robberies,
&amp;c. Transported political offenders were usually a class of
persons whose moral characters stood little more in need of
reformation than ordinary citizens at home. Muir and
Palmer&mdash;names Scotland now reveres amongst those of her
patriot-martyrs&mdash;and many exiled for political offences from
Great Britain and Ireland, were of this class. The machine-breakers
from Dorsetshire, transported about 1833 for destroying mills, were
generally as well-conducted men as emigrants of the same rank of
life. These men had been erroneously led to believe that they would
secure high wages by the destruction of machinery. They had been
betrayed into these acts of folly and violence by mischievous
leaders. From the stain of moral guilt, in its ordinary sense, they
had been free before their arrival, and so they continued to the
end. Most of them saved their little earnings during the period of
their bondage, and not a few, on the expiration of their sentence,
returned to England with a considerable amount of property.</p>
<p>"Even in the class of the more depraved convicts transported for
serious crime, the instances of a reformed character were numerous
and gratifying. London pick-pockets and convicts from Dublin,
Liverpool, and the large towns of the United Kingdom, who, from
their childhood upwards, had been brought up in ignorance, and had
led lives of habitual crime, if not from principle, from obvious
motives of interest in the prospect of becoming independant in a
land of abundance, altered their course of conduct and became
industrious members of society. They knew nothing on their arrival
beyond the criminal practices in which they had been trained. Being
men, however, not devoid of intelligence, they quickly acquired
skill in some industrial pursuit during their period of service in
the employment of masters to whom they were assigned. The useful
and not difficult arts of sowing and ploughing, and shepherding and
herding cattle, they soon mastered. Many became rough mechanics,
and quite adepts in putting up a hut and farm buildings, and
constructing farm fences. Others acquired a knowledge of various
works of handicraft. Some became excellent stone-cutters; many made
hats from the fibre of the cabbage tree&mdash;a cooler covering for
the head than the Leghorn or any other straw-plaited hat of
European manufacture. These hats are universally worn in the colony
(1863). In short, they all became acquainted with some useful art
or pursuit by which they could earn an honest livelihood."</p>
<p>Among a certain class of the old emancipists, however, years
ago, there existed no desire to bury all the past in forgetfulness.
They had become so accustomed to the word "lag" during the days
when two out of every three persons to be seen in street or field
were emancipists or ticket-of-leave men, that they always appeared
to take a pride in narrating incidents connected with their lives
"in the public service." Take one instance which occurred in a
country town in the southern part of the colony, since rendered
famous as the colonial home of an unsuccessful claimant to the
Tichborne estates. An old identity, one of the pioneers of the
district, was about to take his departure for England, and a
banquet was given in his honour. Many old friends of the guest were
present, and while they drank his health in champagne of the best
brand they lavished sweetest flattery upon him. Under the influence
of the sparkling wine one of the company, in particular, gave full
play to his powers of oratory, and worked himself into a state of
watery eloquence. With tears streaming, he mourned over the
departure about to take place, which he exclaimed was more than a
loss to the magisterial bench, to the district, to society, to the
colony, to our nation; it was also an irreparable loss to the
world. Moreover, the orator considered that the mother country had,
when their guest left it, suffered a loss which could never be
balanced. Then, as a grand peroration, the eulogist made a fatal
attempt to quote something <i>apropos</i> in poetry, vigorously
giving, as far as his memory served him, the lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brave patriot he; for be it understood.<br>
He left his country for his country's good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This burst of enthusiasm struck a kindred chord in the inflated
breast of a Bacchanalian who was sitting amongst the audience and
who, with an earnestness which carried conviction to all who heard
him, bawled out, in a blast of words and whisky, "Right, ole
fell-er-sh; he was-sh lagged with me 25 years a-ago."</p>
<p>But there is none of this sort of thing now, and there has not
been any of it for many years. The fathers were emancipated from
the enforced service to which they had been condemned, and the
children have been emancipated from the reproach of the stain of
convictism&mdash;except in cases where the taint breaks out afresh
in viciousness that was inherited; and the people of New South
Wales to-day are as intelligent, as industrious, as honest, as
morally pure, and as prosperous as any community under the sun. It
is not often that evil things die early, and it is one of the
marvels of the age that from a burthen of shame so deep, suffering
so intense, and crime so black, Australia should in such a short
space of time have struggled into a nation so thoroughly healthy,
energetic and sound-hearted.</p>

<p>THE growth in numbers and wealth and influence of the
emancipists was attended by an outreach towards freedom in every
direction, and the efforts of this increasingly powerful class to
secure the individual and communal rights and privileges to which
they had been strangers since their arrest and trial in the old
country, were ably seconded by the men who had voluntarily crossed
the sea in search of fortunes. Reference has already been made to
the struggles in which these men engaged in the days when Darling
and Bourke held the reigns of gubernatorial power. Those struggles
were continued with more or less success until as a class the
emancipists were recognised as an important portion of the body
politic, having equal rights with those who had no record against
them in the official books of either the old world or the new; and
as the time at last arrived when the British Government ceased to
send convicts over the sea to the colony, under circumstances now
to be shortly detailed, the unchecked operation of the regulations
under which conditional and other pardons could be secured,
together with the also unchecked operations of nature, death
ridding the land of those who were not otherwise set free,
ultimately delivered the colony from the reproach and the burden of
convictism, and lifted the inhabitants into the condition of an
absolutely free people.</p>
<p>The reform effected by Governor Bourke in the system of
assignment was the first movement in the direction of abolishing
transportation. This frank and generous man did more to alleviate
the condition of the convicts under the system of slavery which
obtained when he arrived in the colony than any of the Governors
who exercised power while New South Wales continued a penal colony.
As I have already shewn, when Bourke assumed the reins of
government magisterial authority and masters' powers had reached
their highest exercise in the direction of arbitrariness and
cruelty. On the subject of the administration of justice at this
period, Judge Therry, in his "Reminiscences" says:&mdash;"Much of
the maladministration of the law may no doubt be attributed to the
improper materials of which the magistracy at an early period was
composed. Many of its members had been commanders and mates of
convict and other ships and of small coasting vessels; and the
'rough-and-ready-justice' of the quarter-deck was transferred to
the magisterial benches of New South Wales. Not a few were needy
and selfish settlers, who sought to extort by the lash the maximum
of labour from prisoners assigned to them.. .. At the period to
which I allude, this magistrate of the territory&mdash;a
High-sounding title&mdash;was a little magnate of the land. His
powers were large and almost irresponsible, as far as related to
his rule over the convict population. A facility for the abuse of
it was afforded by a prevalent practice of entertaining the
complaints of masters against their assigned servants in the
private residences of magistrates, where they were exempt from
public criticism. Justice in such cases was administered somewhat
after this fashion: A person in the position of a magistrate had
usually from thirty to forty convicts assigned to his service; his
neighbour, a magistrate also, living about ten or fifteen miles
distant from him, may have had about as many more. For the sake of
illustration these magistrates may pass under the well-known names
of Jones and Brown, whilst the convicts of each may, for our
present purpose, be recognised under the generic name of Robinson.
Well, on Monday, the day appointed for trial, Jones brings five or
six Robinsons before Brown, on a charge of 'insubordination,' a
grave offence, punishable by the lash, though of what constituted
the offence of insubordination no legal definition has ever yet
been given. It might mean anything:&mdash;sometimes a refusal to do
double work; a hasty word; a look of dissatisfaction, or of
constructive disrespect; whatever, in fact, Jones thinks fit to
call insubordination, Brown decides to constitute the crime of
insubordination. On being duly convicted in the parlour of Brown,
nobody by but the accused, the accuser, the witness under
examination, and the judge, the latter usually concurring in the
reasonableness of this legal interpretation, five or six Robinsons
are ordered to the triangle, to receive a flogging, from 25 to 50
lashes, after an interval of a few days, three or four times. On
the following Monday, Brown in his turn brings a number of
<i>his</i> Robinsons before Jones, who to preserve a consistency in
judicial decision, awards a like punishment for like offences. On
each Monday the Court (it was called a Court) being over, the
accusing magistrate, Jones, shares the hospitality of the presiding
justice, Brown; a few friends are invited to meet him, and a jovial
evening is spent. Vice versa: On the following Monday, Jones in his
turn becomes the dispenser of the lash, and the giver of the
feast."</p>
<p>This was the state of things existing December, 1831, when
Bourke arrived. His predecessor, Governor Darling, either had not
the inclination or the power to remedy the evil. It was sufficient
for him to prevent any extension of the system, for it is said that
he resisted an application made by some magistrates and others, by
petition, to increase the extensive powers of punishing which they
already possessed. So we see that it was possible for even a
Governor's conscience to be easily satisfied. But the Joneses and
the Browns found a different man in Sir Richard Bourke. The true
metal of manliness was heard to ring in his administration. He
abolished parlour courts and swept away the whole system of mutual
accommodation by white slave-driving magistrates in the interior,
abridging the authority of single magistrates so effectually as to
prevent the enactment of such a scene as that described by the
author-judge, and checking the hunger for white slaves which
consumed the men who were classed as "settlers." He framed and
promulgated rules regulating the number of convict servants to
which each settler should be entitled (without favor) and the
number of lashes which should be inflicted on a convict servant by
a single magistrate: and his action brought him into high disfavour
with the two classes of colonists against whom his repressive
legislation was directed, and who had previously obtained as many
servants as they chose to ask for, either as domestics or field
labourers, at the mere cost of clothing and maintenance.</p>
<p>The new assignment regulations were published in April, 1834.
The general principle introduced under them was that all male
convicts, with the exception of those skilled in certain trades,
should be assigned to masters in proportion to the land occupied by
them under grant from the Crown, or through purchase or lease, such
lease being for a term of which not less than three years remained
unexpired, but no person was to receive convicts in respect to land
upon which he should not reside or maintain a free overseer. The
men were to be assigned according to a scale which, for 40 acres
gave one servant; for 100 acres, three; for 200, four; for 300,
six; for 400, eight; for 640, or one section, ten; for every
additional 160 acres, not exceeding two sections, one; for every
additional section, two. Under this arrangement any man who held a
maximum estate of 2,560 acres would receive for the first section
ten men; for the second section, four; for the third section, four;
and for the fourth section, two&mdash;making in all twenty. The
result of this new system of assignment was to destroy a monopoly
under which the proprietors and lessees of large areas of land had
been able to secure a disproportionate amount of the convict labour
of the colony, to the prejudice of the smaller holders, to whom
such labour, owing to their limited means, was of the greatest
importance, and who put that labour to the best possible account.
The enmity of the wealthier portion of the colonists whose rule was
thus broken followed Bourke to the last day of his residence in the
colony, but it was powerless to injure him, and he received full
compensation for all their insults and attacks in the hearty
support accorded him by the mere numerous class of liberals, who,
with Wentworth at their head, recorded "their entire and cordial
approval of the wise, disinterested, liberal, just, paternal and
constitutional policy" which had marked his government.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the year 1837 a despatch was received by
the Governor from Lord Glenelg directing him to discontinue the
assignment of convicts, but immediate effect was not given to that
despatch. In answer to inquiries from the same quarter at the same
time, Governor Bourke stated that from 4,000 to 5,000 convicts
might be profitably employed on public works in the colony, under
the control of military officers and non-commissioned officers; but
with characteristic wisdom he added, that if the abolition of the
assignment of convicts were resolved on, it should without doubt be
<i>gradual,</i> as the sudden interruption of the accustomed supply
of labour would produce much distress. After events fully justified
his recommendation.</p>
<p>About this time a Committee of the House of Commons was
appointed to inquire into the system of transportation generally.
Voluminous evidence was taken, and an exhaustive report was
prepared and published. That report recommended that the sending of
convicts to New South Wales and to the settled districts of Van
Diemen's Land should cease as soon as possible; that for
transportation should be substituted, both at home and in the
colonies, imprisonment with hard labour; and that in future
convicts should be sent only to settlements where there were no
free people, and from which free people might be excluded; also,
that convicts who were punished abroad should be compelled to leave
the settlement whither they had been transported within a
reasonable time after the expiration of their sentence, means to
that end being furnished them by the government.</p>
<p>Soon after the publication of this report in the colony (1839) a
public meeting was held in Sydney, with a view of counteracting
some of the recommendations contained in it. A petition to
Parliament was adopted, praying that transportation might not be
discontinued. The petitioners contended that this means of
punishment, followed by the usual course of colonial discipline,
particularly as connected with private assignment, was, if well
regulated, the best penal discipline which could be devised, since
it finally removed the convict from scenes and associations to
which otherwise he might be tempted to return. They pointed out
that in congregating the convicts together in large numbers, which
would be the result if assignment were abolished, a spirit of
fellowship was engendered which led the convicts to regard
themselves as a distinct class, rendering them less fit, by this
exclusion, to return to society after their sentences had expired;
while assignment, by shewing the convict the contrast between his
own position and that of the free servant, was productive of
reformatory results, besides those which attended his removal from
evil associations. They admitted that the penal system did not work
so well as was desirable; but they thought that this was owing to a
defective discipline, and not to any fault in the plan of
management&mdash;the chief errors being that, on the one hand,
there was occasionally an excess of punishment, and, on the other,
frequently too much laxity of discipline. To shew the salutary
effects of transportation as a general system of penal discipline,
they referred to the preponderance of crime in France over that
which prevailed in England. As a proof that no contaminating
effects followed from transportation, they urged that during the
preceding seven or eight years the colony had undergone a great
improvement in its morals; and having pointed out that convict
labour enabled the colonists to pay for immigration, and so
prevented the introduction of coolie labour, they prayed Parliament
to postpone its final decision on the subject for twelve
months.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the same year Governor Gipps received
further intimation of the intentions of the Home Government, and
reported that he had publicly announced the important fact "that
transportation had ceased." The reader would only be wearied by the
narration of the whole of the dry details of the proceedings
immediately attending the discontinuance of transportation to the
colony. It was for the authorities in the Colonial Office across
the sea to advise and direct and act; it was for their servant the
Governor in New South Wales to carry out their wishes; it was for
the people of the colony to accept with as good grace as possible
the decisions of the men sixteen thousand miles away who, until the
principle of self-government began to work in the colony, exercised
supreme control of public concerns at the Antipodes. And it is
satisfactory to know that the people generally were favourable to
the discontinuance of transportation. Those who sought, from
motives of aggrandisement, to keep up the stream of convicts were
not by any means numerous, and their effort to induce the Home
Government to "reconsider the subject" was unsuccessful, as also
was a subsequent attempt to assist that Government in the efforts
to renew the system which was now abolished. Freedom in its fullest
form set in in New South Wales towards the close of 1839&mdash;just
fifty-one years after Governor Phillip landed on the shores of
Botany Bay with the first cargo of convicts&mdash;the last ship to
discharge her chained felons being the Eden, which entered Sydney
harbour in November of that year.</p>
<p>A few figures here, culled from decaying documents, shewing the
numbers of convicts brought across the sea, may not prove
uninteresting:&mdash;</p>
<p>From 1795 to the end of 1811 forty-six ships were employed
carrying convicts to New South Wales, and the total number landed
by them was:&mdash;men, 4,318; women, 1,840; of these 387 males and
40 females died on the voyage.</p>
<p>From 1811 to 1815, thirteen ships arrived, bringing 2,885 males
and 588 females&mdash;total 3,473.</p>
<p>During the years 1817-20, inclusive, 870 males and 496 females
were transported.</p>
<p>The number of ships employed by the British Government in
transporting convicts to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land from
1789 to 1837 was 528, at an expenditure under the naval department
of &pound;2,786,910 9s. 7d.</p>
<p>The following is a return, as complete as can be gathered from
the records, of the number of convicts transported to New South
Wales from 1787 to 1841, when transportation to the colony
practically ceased:&mdash;</p>

<p>Subsequently to 1840, the criminal stream which flowed into New
South Wales was directed to Van Diemen's Land, which had now become
the receptacle for nearly all the transported criminals of Great
Britain. Each succeeding year increased the force of the vicious
torrent thitherward, and in the space of four years&mdash;1841 to
1844 inclusive&mdash;no less than 17,000 convicts were landed
there; the free colonists being far outweighed in numbers by the
freed and the prison population. On January 1st, 1843, the total
population of Van Diemen's Land amounted to 57,420 souls. Of these
20,332 were prisoners, the remaining 37,088 consisting of
emancipists, children, and a reduced proportion of adult free
colonists. During the two succeeding years&mdash;1843 and
1844&mdash;8,469 prisoners were added to the population.
Transportation to Van Diemen's Land was continued until 1853, up to
which period 67,655 convicts had been sent to that island, 56,042
being males and 11,613 females. From that period to 1868 convicts
were sent only to Western Australia, that colony having received
9,718, all males. The total sent out to each colony therefore
stands&mdash;</p>
<p>New South Wales&mdash;to 1841........ 83,290</p>
<p>Van Diemen's Land&mdash;to 1853...... 67,655</p>
<p>Western Australia&mdash;to 1868..........9,718</p>
<p>Grand Total............................... 160,663</p>
<p>A general census of the colony of New South Wales was completed
during 1841, two years after transportation to New South Wales had
ceased, and from this it appeared that the total population of the
colony including the province of Port Phillip (Victoria not being
at that time a separate colony) was 130,856. Of these 87,298 were
males, 43,558 females. There were 4,477 landed proprietors,
merchants, bankers and professional men; 1,774 shopkeepers and
retail dealers; 10,715 mechanics and artificers; 12,948 shepherds;
9,825 domestic servants; and 72,317 persons not classified. The
members of the Church of England numbered 73,725; of the Roman
Catholic Church, 35,690; Presbyterians, 13,153; Wesleyans, 3,237;
other "Dissenters," 1,857; Mahomedans and Pagan, 207. Of the male
population 18,802 were married, and 66,366 single; of the female,
17,551 were married, and 26,007 single. Of the free males, 14,819
were born in the colony, 30,745 had arrived free, and 15,760 were
free by servitude. Of the free females, 14,630 were born in the
colony, 22,158 had arrived free, and 3,637 were free by servitude.
Of the male prisoners, 5,843 held tickets of leave, 6,658 were in
government employment, and 1,838 in private assignment. Of the
entire male population, 3,707 were under two years of age; 6,633
were two and under seven; 6,306, seven and under fourteen; 6,045,
fourteen and under twenty-one; 53,381, twenty-one and under
forty-five; 7,212, forty-five and under sixty; 1,884, sixty and
upwards. Of the female population, 3,967, were under two years of
age; 6,581, two and under seven; 5,864, seven and under fourteen;
4,882, fourteen and under twenty-one; 19,513, twenty-one and under
forty-five; 2,175, forty-five and under sixty; 576 sixty and
upwards. The total population of the Port Phillip district was
11,728. Of these 4,479 resided in Melbourne, 3,241 in the county of
Bourke, 1,891 in the district of Western Port, 454 in the Glenelg
district, and 1,260 in the county of Normanby.</p>
<p>In a letter written by Mr. V. Dumas, Clerk in the Convict
Department, Sydney, dated June, 1850, there appears the following
passage concerning the 80,000 prisoners who had been sent to the
colony:&mdash;"38,000 are now filling respectable positions in
life, and earning their livelihood in the most respectable manner..
.. .. Of the residue, death and departures from the colony will
account for the greater part, and I am enabled to state that only
370 out of the whole are now undergoing punishment of any kind." He
meant, of course, the punishment attaching to the offence for which
they had been transported, for in a large number of cases, as we
have seen, the first sentence was not always the last.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with the stoppage of transportation, there arose
in the colony an agitation against the continuance of the system
which had been established, and under which the whole cost of the
maintenance of the police and gaols of the colony was cast upon the
colonists. The residents in Sydney petitioned the Council and the
Governor against such appropriation of the local funds, and prayed
that one-half the expenses of police and gaols should be borne by
the mother country, and the remainder met by a tax of &pound;5 for all
assigned convicts, mechanics and others employed in the towns, and
&pound;1 for all shepherds and others employed in rural and pastoral
pursuits. Subsequently a motion on these grounds was brought
forward in the Council, but it was not passed, the Conservative
element in the only House of Legislature then existing being too
strong for such a radical reform. Shortly after this the first
well-defined movement on the part of the colonists to secure
representative government was made, but that subject cannot be
dealt with here.</p>
<p>The regimental force in the colony was considerably reduced on
the discontinuance of transportation. Instead of two regiments,
stationed previously in Sydney, the staff of one regiment and three
or four companies were found sufficient for military purposes. The
large commissariat establishment was also greatly reduced; and
Sydney assumed more the appearance of a "city of civil
inhabitants." The change spread to the country, and long before the
evil of convictism disappeared from public view, that other evil of
militaryism had died, never more to be revived. A large body of
trained policemen were brought from Manchester and Birmingham to
the colony, and these did better service as preservers of order
under the new conditions of life than ever red-coated soldiers
could do, under moustached, epauletted, military martinets.</p>
<p>The interval between 1840 and 1846 was not marked by any very
striking event necessary to record in a narrative dealing, as this
does, simply with the convictism of the colony; but many important
movements were initiated, the trend of which was in the direction
of still greater freedom, and commercial and political elevation.
The already large free population was supplemented by a steady
stream of men, women and children whose names had not been enrolled
among gaol records and whose voyage across the sea was not the
result of a sentence of transportation issued by judicial lips.
During the latter part of Governor Gipps' administration
extraordinary efforts, which it is not requisite should be here
described in detail, were made to swell the population by the
importation of people from Great Britain and Ireland as immigrants,
and during the six years following the cessation of transportation
about 50,000 immigrants were brought to New South Wales at the
colony's expense, the funds to defray that expense being chiefly
drawn from the proceeds of the sale of the public estate.</p>
<p>Two months after the arrival of Governor Fitzroy there was a
revival of the Anti-transportation question. The Governor received
a despatch from the new Secretary of State for the Colonies, Mr.
Gladstone, in which there occurred the following
passage:&mdash;"While her Majesty's government were desirous to
lessen the number of convicts annually sent to Van Diemen's Land,
they were also disposed to doubt whether, even independent of any
regard to the state of things in that colony, it was to be desired
that the absolute exclusion of transported convicts from New South
Wales should continue." In another part of the despatch the promise
which had been made by the Home Government that no more convicts
should be sent to New South Wales, was referred to as merely a
"report." "You are aware," wrote Gladstone to the Governor, "that
the practice has been, for some years past, to exclude New South
Wales from the sentence of transportation passed in this country,
and that this practice is commonly <i>reported</i> to rest on
nothing less than a promise from her Majesty's Government, made in
or about the year 1839, that transportation to New South Wales
should cease." Although this document was marked "Private and
Confidential," Fitzroy laid it before the Legislative Council, and
that body, being composed of nominee and elected members who for
the most part were men who had made or were making fortunes through
the cheap labour afforded by the convict system, manifested a
disposition to assent to the proposal of the Colonial Office. On
the motion of Mr. Wentworth a select committee of the Council was
appointed "to inquire into and report upon the despatch of the
Secretary of State for the Colonies to Governor Sir Charles
Augustus Fitzroy, of date 30th April, respecting the renewal of
transportation." That Committee brought up an exhaustive report, in
which, after referring to the fact that New South Wales was subject
to the "indirect inundation of convictism" through the continuance
of transportation to Van Diemen's Land, they set forth their
conclusions in the following words:&mdash;"This, being the true
state of the question raised for the decision of the colonists and
the House, by the despatch under consideration, the committee had
arrived at the conclusion that the only safe alternative left to
the colony was to accede to the proposition, that a modified and
carefully regulated introduction of convict labourers in New South
Wales, or into some part of it, might, under existing
circumstances, be advisable." And in anticipation of their report
being adopted and acted upon they submitted certain conditions
which they proposed should form part of the arrangements by which
the scheme should be carried out. Amongst these were the
following:&mdash;(1). That the transportation of male convicts
should be accomplished, as a simultaneous measure, with the
importation of an equal number of females&mdash;these to consist of
female convicts, so far as such existed, and the balance to be made
up of female immigrants. (2). That as a further simultaneous
measure, such transportation should be accompanied with an equal
importation of free immigrants, as nearly as possible in equal
proportion as to sexes. (3). That the wives and families of all
convicts receiving permanent or temporary indulgences should be
brought to the colony, and be reckoned as part of the free
immigration. (4). That no less than five thousand male convicts
should be annually deported to the colony. (5). That convict
establishments, properly so called, such as Norfolk Island,
Cockatoo Island, gangs of criminals under colonial sentences, and
so on, should be maintained, as heretofore, at the cost of the
British Treasury. (6). That two-thirds the expenses of the police,
gaols, and the criminal administration of justice, should be paid
by the home government; but that on the relinquishment of the land
fund and all other revenues or droits of the Crown to the
appropriation of the governor and Legislative Council, the whole of
this branch of the convict expenditure should be assumed by the
colony, with the view to aid the British government in defraying
the cost of the free immigration stipulated for in the conditions.
The Committee also recommended that no system of management should
be introduced thereafter by which the convicts would be aggregated
in masses, and also, as a consequence of the preceding
recommendations, that the assignment system should be renewed with
increased carefulness.</p>
<p>But the Governor and the Council were not the people, neither
did they represent the people; and the colonists out of the House,
who had just begun to recognise their power, and who guessed what
the decision of the conservative slave-owners in the Council would
be, determined to have some say in the matter, which was of such
vital interest to them. The 22nd October, 1846, was rendered
memorable in the annals of Colonial History, as the date upon which
the first anti-transportation meeting was held. Mr. (afterward Sir)
Charles Cowper presided at that meeting, and two of the principal
speakers were Mr. Charles Campbell and Rev. John McEncroe
(afterwards Archdeacon). The following resolution was unanimously
adopted:&mdash;"That this meeting has heard with the deepest
feeling of alarm and regret that it is proposed to renew the system
of transportation to this colony, and they cannot conceive any
circumstances under which such a measure would be desirable or
justifiable;" and so strong and general was the opposition to a
return to convictism that in four days no less than seven thousand
signatures to a petition to the same purport were obtained in
Sydney. Copies of this petition were sent into the country
districts and were numerously signed. On the very day that the
Report of the Committee was brought up this petition was presented
to the Council, but a motion for printing it was negatived, and the
Council prepared to transmit the report of their Committee to the
Home authorities. But the anti-transportationists were nothing
daunted by this autocratic rebuff. They immediately called another
meeting and adopted a memorial to the Governor, setting forth all
the facts which had transpired in reference to the matter, and
praying his Excellency to transmit official copies of the petition
to England, and to use his influence to prevent the colony being
again made a penal settlement. In reply to this the Governor
said:&mdash;"He would forward the memorial, as well as the
petition, to her Majesty's Ministers at the earliest opportunity.
He could use no influence, however, for he had none in the matter.
His duty was to report, as impartially as he could, all that he
could ascertain respecting the opinions of the colonists. They
might rest assured, however, that the Government did not wish to
force transportation on the colony against the wishes of the
colonists, and that Mr. Gladstone's despatch was written in good
faith." We shall presently see how very impartial was the report of
Sir Charles Fitzroy&mdash;the "descendant of the King."</p>
<p>Then followed a short space of quasi-tranquility&mdash;each
party waiting to see the results of its representations. The
"revivalists" held two meetings for the purpose of making a
demonstration in favour of transportation, but at each condemnatory
amendments were carried, although the pro-transportationists found
a strong argument in favour of the position they had assumed in the
scarcity of labour which existed in the colony, owing to the
withdrawal of the convict servants from the market. But the
colonists were prepared to make large sacrifices to maintain that
freedom which they had enjoyed for a short season. They contended
that the scarcity of labour was far and away the least of the two
evils, the convict system being an evil of such magnitude, and
fraught with so much peril to the moral and social well-being of
society, that nothing but an inordinate love of money could induce
anyone to look upon it without horror and disgust. The residents at
Port Phillip, who were then beginning to agitate for separation
from New South Wales, also took the matter up. Anti-transportation
meetings were held, at which protests were entered against the
introduction of criminals in any form or on any terms into that
district, and a memorial to the Legislative Council against the
proposal of the Secretary of State was unanimously adopted, the
petitioners contending that if the revenue from the sale and lease
of lands was properly applied there would be no lack of labour, as
a steady stream of emigrants of the desired sort would set in,
sufficient to meet every demand. Shortly after this (in May, 1847),
the Council assembled, and the Governor announced in his speech
that he had recommended to her Majesty's Government the immediate
resumption of immigration to the amount of five thousand statute
adults, the first ship-load of which he expected would arrive
towards the close of the year.</p>
<p>In the month of August, Mr. Cowper revived the question of
transportation in the Council by moving a resolution to the effect
that the House "disapproved of the principles and recommendation of
the report of the Committee appointed on 13th October of the
preceding year, respecting the renewal of transportation to the
colony, and desired to record the expression of its opinion that a
return to the system of transportation and assignment was opposed
to the wishes of the community, and would also be most injurious to
the moral, social and political advancement of the colony." Then
the public opinion which had been so vigorously expressed proved
its potency. The Council by a majority of eleven to seven passed
the resolution, and the way was prepared for the colonists to take
further steps in the direction of consolidating freedom. They
petitioned the Council, praying that immigration should be carried
on to a still larger extent than was spoken of in the Governor's
speech, and a Committee of the Council having in a report
subsequently presented strongly urged the importance of reviving
immigration on a large scale, the Council adopted a series of
resolutions based upon that report, setting forth the following
facts and propositions:&mdash;That there existed an urgent demand
for labour, that this demand was daily increasing, and was more
pressing than any that had been experienced at any former period;
that the colony presented the means for the immediate employment
and advantageous settlement of twenty-thousand persons in the next
twelve months, and that the territorial revenue afforded ample
security for even a larger sum than it was necessary to expend in
introducing that number; that it was desirable that a loan of one
million, secured on the territorial revenue of the colony, and
guaranteed by the Imperial Parliament in accordance with the
precedent established in the case of Canada, should be raised in
England for immigration purposes; and that, failing to secure such
guarantee, the Council approved of the plan which had been proposed
for the issue of debentures secured on the territorial revenues, in
payment of immigration.</p>
<p>At the next meeting of the Council, in March, 1848, the
Vice-regal speech contained one short reference to the
transportation question. "Connected with the supply of labour to
the colony," said his Excellency, "he would also cause to be laid
before the House a despatch from the Right Honourable Earl Grey,
setting forth the terms upon which her Majesty's Government would
be disposed to send out exiles and ticket-of-leave holders, to be
subsequently followed by their wives and families; and by a number
of free immigrants, equal to the number of such exiles and
ticket-of-leave holders, all to be forwarded at the expense of the
British Treasury. This proposal was made subject to the concurrence
of the Legislative Council, and accordingly he recommended it to
their early and attentive consideration." At the very commencement
of the session, Wentworth, who, with his party, was still burning
with anxiety to taste afresh the pleasures of "bossing" prison
servants, submitted the following resolution concerning this new
phase of convictism:&mdash;"That the despatch of the Secretary of
State of the 3rd of September, 1847, having been submitted for the
consideration of the Council, the House was disposed to co-operate
with the Home Government in carrying out the scheme of reformatory
discipline indicated therein, so far as it related to the reception
and employment in this colony of the classes of exiles holding
conditional pardons and tickets-of-leave, on the terms in the said
despatch mentioned, namely, that in all cases the wives and
families of such exiles, together with a number of free immigrants
equal to the number of such exiles, should be sent out at the cost
of the British treasury. The Council, however, urged, as a point of
the greatest importance to the complete success of the measure,
that the wives and families of the exiles should accompany rather
than follow their husbands and parents, so that the evils arising
from the large aggregation of males within the narrow compass of a
vessel, and almost necessarily in a state of idleness, might be
avoided, and the beneficial tendencies of the first stage of their
probationary career on their arrival in the colony might not be
needlessly endangered by a severance of domestic ties no longer
necessary for the purposes of punishment. The Council would further
urge that, through the whole progress of this combined deportation
and immigration, due care should be taken to maintain as far as
possible the equality of the sexes, so as to prevent a recurrence
of those evils which were allowed on all hands to have been the
worst feature of the late system of transportation." It is not
surprising under the circumstances then existing, labour being so
scarce while the demand for it was increasingly great, that the
proposal to send such convicts only as would be already partly free
men, having with them wives and families, and with them also an
equal number of immigrants, should meet with favour in the Council,
and after a short debate Wentworth's resolution was carried, and a
copy of it ordered to be presented to his Excellency for
presentation to her Majesty, for the information of her
government.</p>
<p>Thus matters remained until January, 1849, when the
anti-transportation agitation was renewed with tenfold vigour. A
despatch from the Secretary of State let the colonists into the
secret that the slave-driving party had forwarded a petition in
favour of the renewal of transportation direct to the Imperial
Government, and that this petition had been sent away
simultaneously with the obnoxious report of Wentworth's Committee,
in 1846. The Secretary of State answered the petitioners through
the Governor, and intimated that the petition should have been
transmitted through him, at the same time informing them, however,
that he had laid the petition "at the foot of the throne." The
indignation of the colonists at this piece of underground
engineering had barely time to find expression before another
despatch, bearing on the same subject, was received, and the
transportation question was brought to a crisis. The despatch
purported to be explanatory of the views and intentions of her
Majesty's Government on the subject of convict discipline and
transportation, and referred to the willingness of the Legislative
Council to receive prisoners of the Crown, accompanied by
immigrants, sent out at the cost of the Home Government. The
Secretary of State informed the Governor that he had thought of
abolishing transportation altogether, and readily acknowledged that
after what had already taken place on the subject her Majesty's
government could not, without the assent of the colonists, refuse
to provide for the conveyance of an equal number of free immigrants
if convicts were sent at all to New South Wales. "But," the
Secretary continued, "on further consideration of the despatch of
the Governor, and looking at the urgent want of labour, as
explained through various means of information, and the great
usefulness of convicts previously trained under the system of
punishment now adopted in England, he was led to the conclusion
that the colonists of New South Wales would prefer, to the entire
abandonment of the measure proposed, the receiving a moderate
number of immigrants, sent out without charge to the colony." After
referring to another despatch which had been sent to the Governors
of the other colonies explaining the terms on which it was now
proposed to send convicts abroad, the statement was made that "if
the Legislative Council of New South Wales agreed to receive
convicts on those conditions, her Majesty's Government would
continue to send there a portion of those whom it would be
necessary to remove from the country; if not, another destination
must be found for them." The cunning secretary meant to break the
news gently, and having proceeded so far, explained that "As so
much delay would be occasioned in sending to the colony labourers
who were urgently wanted, if he were to wait for an answer to this
dispatch, before any measure for the carrying the arrangement into
operation were adopted, he proposed at once advising her Majesty to
revoke the Order in Council by which New South Wales was made no
longer a place for receiving convicts under sentence of
transportation;" but his Excellency was given to understand that it
was not intended to send to New South Wales any convicts but such
as were considered to be deserving of tickets-of-leave on their
arrival, and to be also calculated to become useful as labourers in
the colony. As an inducement for the colonists to agree to this
arrangement, it was proposed to make the convicts so sent out repay
the cost of their passage to the colony, the fund so created to be
applied to the purposes of free immigration. The meaning of the
official rigmarole was made plain by the following sentence at the
close of the despatch:&mdash;"In the expectation that for these
reasons the reception of convicts under this arrangement would not
be unacceptable to the colonists, the <i>scheme would be acted upon
till an answer to this despatch was received;</i> but if it should
then appear that the colonists objected to receiving convicts on
these terms, no more would be sent, and her Majesty's Government
would apply to Parliament for such a grant for free immigration to
New South Wales as, with the repayments of convicts previously
sent, would be sufficient to send out an equal number of free
settlers."</p>
<p>This was, perhaps, one of the most remarkable documents that
ever emanated from the office of the Secretary of State, although
at that time it was the manufactory of remarkable documents. The
colonists received the news with marks of profoundest astonishment
and unbounded indignation, in which many of the advocates of
transportation joined, and they were not long in seeking to give
expression thereto. They denounced the conduct of the Secretary of
State in strongest language, and declared that they would not have
convicts now sent to the colony on any terms. A great anti-convict
demonstration was held in the Victoria theatre, at which the Mayor
presided and Charles Cowper, Robert Lowe, and Dean McEncroe
delivered stirring addresses, the following comprehensive series of
resolutions being adopted:&mdash;"That this meeting, having
considered the despatch of the Right Honourable the Secretary of
State for the Colonies to his Excellency Sir Charles Fitzroy, of
date 8th September, 1848, in which, taking advantage of the remote
situation of the colony, his lordship has announced his intention,
without waiting for an answer from the colonists, of forcing on the
community transported felons, in direct violation of the pledge
contained in the despatch of the 23rd September, 1847, namely, that
in any arrangement for sending convicts to New South Wales, her
Majesty's government were prepared to afford facilities to the
wives and families of convicts to join them, and that means would
also be provided for sending out at the cost of the British
treasury a number of free immigrants, equal to that of such
offenders, resolves&mdash;(1.)That as the Colonial office has so
unscrupulously broken faith with the colonists, not only in this
matter, but also in reference to the compact made during the
administration of Sir Richard Bourke, as to the police and gaol
expenses and territorial revenue, this colony peremptorily refuses
to receive the offenders of the mother country, whether under the
name of convicts, exiles, or any other designation, upon any terms
whatever; (2.) that the colonists of New South Wales, in public
meeting assembled, desire to express their astonishment and
indignation at the avowal made by the Colonial Minister, of a
deliberate intention to break a specific pledge, upon the plea of
temporary financial difficulty.. .. .. .(3.) that this was not the
first instance which the colonists have had to complain of a breach
of solemn engagements entered into with the colony by the Colonial
Office, and that a repetition of such treatment was calculated
seriously to compromise the permanency of those relations between
the colonies and the mother country which it was so desirable to
maintain; (4.) that his Excellency the Governor be requested in the
event of a ship arriving in the harbour with convicts, to send such
vessel back to England; (5.) that his Excellency the Governor be
respectfully requested to call the Legislative Council together
without delay in order that the despatch of the Secretary of State
might be laid before them for consideration." A petition to the
Queen was then drawn up and adopted, in which the protests made by
the colonists in former years against convictism were
recapitulated, and the statement made that the petitioners "felt
bound, humbly, but firmly, to represent to her Majesty that it was
their duty and their determination, by every legal and
constitutional means, to opposed the revival of transportation in
any shape."</p>
<p>Similar petitions were prepared in Bathurst and all the
principal towns of the colony, and the agitation became very
widespread and earnest. In Port Phillip, also, the question was
discussed, and as Fitzroy just then was paying a visit to Melbourne
he was importuned to use his authority and influence to preserve
the southern districts from being made subject to the curse of
further convictism. During 1847 two or three shiploads of exiles
had been landed at Melbourne, and found ready employment among the
residents. His Excellency promised that he would strongly
remonstrate with the Home government against convicts being sent to
Port Phillip, and in order that none should land there in the
meantime he gave the superintendent authority to forward to Sydney
any that might arrive. As soon as Fitzroy returned to Sydney he was
interviewed in reference to the promise he had given to the
Melbourne folk, and said he had given it because he saw that there
would be great difficulty in disposing at Port Phillip of a
shipload of convicts, sent out with a promise of tickets of leave;
and he assured the deputation that there was no desire on the part
of either the Imperial or the local government to continue
transportation, even in the modified form proposed, unless such a
measure met with the concurrence of the colonists. He promised,
further, to make such representations "as would have the effect of
causing any measures which were in progress for sending out
convicts to the colony to be suspended until he should have been
enabled to place the Secretary of State in possession of the
deliberate opinion of the Legislature on this subject."</p>
<p>Shortly after this the Legislative Council assembled, and in his
opening speech the Governor said that he had lost no time in
transmitting to the Secretary of State a full report of the
demonstration which had been made by the colonists on the
transportation question, with a request that any measures which
might be in progress for sending out convicts should be suspended
until he was enabled to place his lordship in possession of the
deliberate opinion of the Council on the subject; he, therefore,
invited the House to give the matter, with all promptitude,
attentive consideration. Within a week thereafter Cowper moved
"That an address be presented to the Governor respectfully
requesting that he would not cause any convicts, destined by her
Majesty's Government for the district of Port Phillip, to be
brought into the middle district, also that his Excellency would be
pleased to prevent the dispersion of any convicts who might arrive
in the harbour of Port Jackson through the distant districts of the
colony, where there was no means of exercising a proper discipline
over them, and where their presence must be injurious, in every
point of view, to the immigrant families now proceeding thither."
(It is worthy of remark that in his speech the Governor had
informed the Council that since the resumption of immigration in
1848, no fewer than fifty-four immigrant ships had arrived in the
colony, bringing out 13,161 souls, and seven additional ships were
then on their way). Cowper's resolution was defeated by Macarthur
moving the previous question, which was carried by sixteen to nine,
the majority being for the chief part composed of the nominees,
including six government officers, while eight of the minority were
representatives of the people. This fact gave emphasis to the
movement that was under weigh among the colonists for securing a
larger degree of free government. Subsequently Cowper moved another
resolution, referring to Earl Grey's despatch, "That the Council
declined to accede to the proposal therein contained for the
renewal of transportation, and strongly protested against the
adoption of any measure by which the colony would be degraded into
a penal settlement; and that the Council would earnestly entreat
her Majesty's government to be graciously pleased to revoke the
Order in Council by which the colony was again made a place to
which British offenders might be transported." That resolution was
carried without dissent, and for once the Council voiced the
sentiments of the colonists.</p>
<p>The agitation outside still continued. The Sydney people had
determined upon making a grand demonstration on the arrival of the
first convict ship which had been sent out with the fresh batch,
and in the month of June that demonstration took place, when the
"Harkaway" arrived with 212 male convicts on board. The ship
arrived in the harbour on the Friday, and on the Monday following
an immense meeting was held at the Circular Wharf, about 5000
persons being present, including the leading merchants and
shopkeepers, who had closed their establishments in order to be
present. Amidst pouring rain stirring speeches were delivered, and
a protest against further transportation was adopted. The grounds
of that protest were thus succinctly set forth&mdash;Firstly,
because it is a violation of the will of the majority of the
colonists, as clearly evidenced by their expressed opinions on the
question at all times; secondly, because numbers among us have
immigrated on the faith of the British Government, that
transportation to this colony had ceased for ever; thirdly, because
it is incompatible with the existence of a free colony, desiring
self government, to be made the receptacle of another country's
felons; fourthly, because it is in the highest degree unjust to
sacrifice the great social and political interests of the colony at
large to the pecuniary profit of a fraction of the inhabitants;
fifthly, being firmly and devotedly attached to the British Crown,
we greatly fear that the perpetration of so stupendous an act of
injustice by her Majesty's government will go far towards
alienating the affections of the people of this colony from the
mother country. "For these," said the people, "and for many kindred
reasons, in the exercise of our duty to our country, for the love
we bear our families, in the strength of our loyalty to Great
Britain, and from the depth of our reverence to Almighty God, we
protest against the landing again of British convicts on these
shores." It was afterwards resolved "That it is the urgent request
of this meeting that the local government do send the prisoners
arrived in the "Harkaway" immediately back to England, and, if
necessary, at the expense of the colony."</p>
<p>A deputation was then appointed to wait on the Governor with the
protest and resolution, with a request that his Excellency would
forward them to the Queen. The deputation proceeded to Government
House, but found the gates leading to the vice-regal residence
closed. After some parleying with the sentry six of the deputation
were admitted and they were then informed that they must forward a
copy of the protest and resolution to the Governor and wait upon
him next day. This was done, and the Governor next day informed the
deputation that he would lose no time in forwarding the protest to
England, but that it was impossible for him to have the "Harkaway"
sent back to England with the convicts. One member of the
deputation was proceeding to express regret that his Excellency
could not return a more favourable answer, when Fitzroy
discourteously cut short the conversation and gave the deputation
to understand that vice-regal ears could not listen to any
discussion.</p>
<p>Subsequently another monster meeting was held at which
resolutions to be embodied in a petition to the Queen were passed,
praying her Majesty to remove Earl Grey from office, and affirming
that it was indispensable that the government of the colony should
no longer be administered by a remote, ill-informed, and
irresponsible colonial office, but by ministers chosen from and
responsible to the colonists themselves, in accordance with the
principles of the British constitution. Another resolution was
passed censuring the Governor for the discourtesy shewn to the
former meeting and its deputation, and the mover of that resolution
stated that a body of mounted police were quartered in the
Governor's stable and that the kitchen of Government House was
filled with soldiers&mdash;ready to take action against the
populace should his Excellency think interference was necessary.
The friends of the Governor subsequently presented an address to
him in which they applauded his conduct and expressed their
"unshaken confidence in his Excellency's administration."</p>
<p>The quarrel between the Governor and the anti-transportationists
waxed hotter and hotter. His Excellency stood upon his dignity, and
the colonists stood upon their rights; but no definite action was
taken on either side until about August, 1850, when a copy of a
despatch sent by Fitzroy to the Secretary of State, giving an
account of the two famous Circular Quay meetings was received in
the colony and published. That account was characteristically
one-sided and untrue. Fitzroy described the gentlemen who had taken
part in the meeting as persons "who had no stake or interest in the
community," said that the actual attendance at the meetings did not
exceed hundreds, and assured his lordship that the question of the
resumption of transportation had been seized "by a small faction
whose influence only extended to the mob of Sydney, as a pretext
for wantonly insulting his lordship, and passing a vote of censure
on himself (Fitzroy)."</p>
<p>As soon as this document had been made public an "indignation
meeting" was held, attended by over 4000 persons, and addressed by
Messrs. Robert Campbell, Henry Parkes, George A. Lloyd, Rev. Dr.
Fullerton and others. A series of resolutions to be embodied in a
memorial to the Queen were passed declaring that his Excellency had
grossly misrepresented facts of public notoriety, traduced the
character of a large majority of the colonists, betrayed the
interests of the colony into the hands of its enemies, and that the
despatch testified Fitzroy's incapacity and unworthiness to fill
the responsible office of governor of the colony. The meeting also
earnestly prayed her Majesty to remove Sir Charles Augustus Fitzroy
from his position as Governor, and reiterated the opinions embodied
in the resolutions passed at the previous meetings, that the
Government of the colony should be administered by ministers chosen
from, and responsible to, the colonists themselves. Some of the
speakers were unsparing in their denunciations of Fitzroy's
conduct, and one of them referred in very plain terms to the laxity
of morals which characterized the social life of his Excellency and
his two sons, and which had brought the high office he held into
disrepute. Of this speaker (Mr. Edward Flood) the Governor demanded
an explanation, but not receiving any reply he wrote to Flood and
denounced him as "a liar and a coward." Flood proceeded against
Fitzroy in the Police Court, but the friends of the latter mustered
strongly on the Bench and dismissed the case. These magistrates
"dearly loved a lord," and it was natural that they should shelter
him from the attacks of a plebeian, even at the sacrifice of a
large lump of magisterial honour and purity. Then other of
Fitzroy's friends outside, to the number of twenty-five, held a
meeting and passed resolutions justifying his conduct and
denouncing the action of the anti-transportationists as "low
vitipuration and unfounded attacks"&mdash;the outcome of the
"passions and prejudices of that excited and anarchical element of
the population which, if it were allowed to gain the ascendency,
would uproot in the colony the foundation of property and order."
Wentworth, who was one of the leaders of the
pro-transportationists, presided at this meeting.</p>
<p>A period of considerable excitement and unrest followed, but the
colonists as a body were determined that their object should not be
defeated by official chicanery or gubernatorial fooling, and they
continued the agitation with a determination that could not be
shaken. In September of the same year they held another mass
meeting in Barrack Square, Sydney. Six thousand persons attended,
and addresses were delivered by gentlemen representing every
section of the community, chief among them being Archdeacon
McEncroe, Rev. Dr. Ross, Rev. Joseph Beazley, Rev. W. B. Boyce, and
Messrs, Norton, Campbell, Holden, Lamb, Mort, Piddington and Weeks.
An elaborate memorial to the Legislative Council was adopted,
referring to the breaches of faith on the part of the Secretary of
State, and praying that the Council would not refrain from giving
their most uncompromising opposition to the introduction of
convicts into New South Wales, under any name, conditions, or
circumstances whatsoever. Resolutions were also passed sympathising
with the indignation of the people of Van Diemen's Land at the
continuance of the system there beyond the period when the Imperial
Government had promised it should cease, and pledging the meeting
to co-operate with their brethren in Van Diemen's Land in every
exertion to procure the final cessation of transportation.</p>
<p>Similar meetings were also held in all the chief centres of
population in the colony, in Melbourne and in Van Diemen's Land,
and the "New South Wales Anti-Transportation League" was formed.
This unanimity of public feeling, this solid organization and well
directed effort of moral resistance, could not fail to make itself
felt. And still the agitation spread and strengthened. A meeting of
delegates was held in Melbourne early in 1851, the new colony of
Victoria having been just previously proclaimed amidst much
rejoicing, and a General League was formed, covering the whole of
the colonies, and imposing upon its members the following
obligations:&mdash;(1). Not to employ any persons who might
thereafter arrive under sentence of transportation for crimes
committed in Europe; (2.) to use all the powers they possessed,
official, electoral, and legislative, to prevent the establishment
of English prisons or penal settlements within their
bounds&mdash;to refuse their assent to any projects to facilitate
the administration of such penal systems, and to seek the repeal of
all regulations, and the removal of all establishments for that
purpose; (3.) to support with their advice, money and countenance,
all who might suffer in the lawful promotion of this cause. At a
public meeting subsequently held a subscription was commenced with
the view to raising a League fund, the maximum being fixed at
&pound;20,000, and at the meeting thirty-one persons, chiefly heads of
mercantile firms, put down their names for one hundred guineas
each. What greater proof of earnestness in any cause could be
desired? And upon what more solid ground could appeal for relief
from a degrading burden be based than the following&mdash;indicated
in a series of resolutions passed at a meeting of the League held
in Sydney, after the delegates had returned from
Melbourne:&mdash;(1.) That amongst the blessings which religion had
bestowed on the world, it had placed the intercourse of mankind
upon a basis of established duties&mdash;duties which were not less
binding on nations than on individuals, and that of these there was
not one of greater obligation than the duty of man towards his
neighbour; (2.) that the inundating by Great Britain of these
colonies by the crime of the empire was not only a violation of the
duty which men owe their neighbours, but was destructive of those
charities which it behoved the parent state and her offspring to
cultivate and cherish towards each other; (3.) that the meeting
accorded their deepest sympathy towards Van Diemen's Land, and
recognised in her admitted wrongs, her promised relief, and in the
cruel violation of that promise, additional incentives to increased
exertion; and they appealed to their fellow subjects throughout the
empire, and entreated them by their discretion as men, by their
compassion as philanthropists, and by their consciences as
Christians, to put an end to the system of transportation to
Australia: (4.) that as parents they were bound by every obligation
of duty and affection to protect their children from the dangers
incident to the transportation of offenders to these colonies, and
they united in a solemn appeal to the humanity and justice of the
Sovereign and people of Great Britain on behalf of the rising
generation.</p>
<p>The Anti-Transportationists were still in the heat of conflict
when an event occurred which was destined to completely
revolutionize colonial life in all its relations and interests,
namely, the discovery of gold in the vicinity of Bathurst. The news
quickly spread, and being confirmed by the exhibition of nuggets
and dust of the precious metal in Sydney, a rush at once set in
across the mountains to the region where the discovery had been
made. The story connected herewith, and of the marvellous
transformation wrought by the finding of the precious metal in
other localities in the West, will be given in its proper place,
when in Part V. of this History the "Rise and Progress of the West"
is being dealt with. I only mention it here for the purpose of
referring to its importance as a factor, in once and for all
setting the question of transportation at rest. As one early
historian shrewdly observes:&mdash;"To continue transportation to
Australia now would be to hold out a premium for the commission of
crime. Hundreds of men, in every part of the United Kingdom, would
not hesitate to undergo a brief period of punishment in order that
they might find themselves settled in a country where gold was to
be found by the hundredweight. Then, in a country where the
attractions of the gold-fields influenced, more or less the entire
population, what guarantee was there that, in the general
confusion, or, at all events, during the turmoil consequent on the
discovery of some unusually rich mines, or during a fierce
political contest, so likely to arise out of the new condition of
the colony, prison discipline might not be entirely destroyed, so
as to let loose in the colony the gangs of villains and desperadoes
who might fill the gaols, barracks, and stockades? The Minister
who, under these circumstances would seek to perpetuate
transportation would indeed deserve the severest reprobation which
language could convey, if, indeed, he met with no more positive
punishment."</p>
<p>During the few months that the question was allowed to remain in
abeyance, thousands of free persons were attracted to the colony,
anxious and eager to make rapid fortunes in the "land of gold," and
these joined the colonists in their struggle for the maintenance
and extension of that freedom which was to become their greatest
glory. In July, 1851, the receipt in the colony of a speech
delivered by Earl Grey in the House of Lords, based upon a petition
from the inhabitants of Van Diemen's Land against transportation,
galvanized the League into excited activity. In that speech, Earl
Grey, referring to the alleged promise of the Imperial Government
that transportation should be brought to a close, while not denying
that some of the despatches to the colony might be so interpreted,
contended that no man could read them as a whole without perceiving
that, from first to last, "it was the view of the Government that
while the greater part of the sentence of transportation was to be
inflicted at home, it was always to form a part of the system that
convicts, after having undergone a large portion of their
punishment in England, should afterwards be removed to the
Australian Colonies." As a proof that the sending out of convicts
who had undergone part of their sentence at Portland and
Pentonville had worked well, he said that of 1618 prisoners sent
out between 1st June, 1849, and 30th April, 1850, having
tickets-of-leave, there were only 40 whom it was found necessary to
punish, and in those cases the offences were of a minor character.
He then proceeded:&mdash;"They had been trained in England to
useful labour, and had proved an acquisition to the colony. The
inhabitants of New South Wales, when they calmly viewed the working
of the system, would, he was persuaded, see it for their interest
that convicts should be sent to some parts of that colony. He
admitted that convicts ought not to be sent to Sydney, Melbourne,
or any other of the more considerable towns, or even to the more
thickly-peopled country districts; but they might be sent, with
immense advantage, to those large tracts of country which were now
becoming covered with sheep, and he hoped the Legislature of New
South Wales would come to that conclusion.. .. He hoped the
colonists of New South Wales would not be so blind to their own
true interest and the interests of their country, as to refuse the
receiving of convicts."</p>
<p>A meeting of the Australasian League was immediately held, at
which Cowper, Parkes, Josephson, Wright, Norton, Kemp, Campbell,
Archdeacon McEncroe, and others delivered addresses, and at which a
petition to the Queen was adopted. After giving a brief history of
previous proceedings, the petitioners referred to the case of Van
Diemen's Land, and pointed out that as all the colonies were
closely connected by all the ties which create a community of
interest and feeling, the shock of oppression extended far beyond
the surface on which it was inflicted. Said they:&mdash;"New South
Wales, South Australia, Victoria and New Zealand, had all a direct
and awful concern in the issue of this question. Sending convicts
to Van Diemen's Land was but as a pause in the career, and the
sacrifice of that colony increased the common danger. Her Majesty
would judge, therefore, with what feelings the inhabitants of the
Australian colonies looked forward to the arrival among them
annually of thousands of persons who had spent, on an average,
seven and a half years in the condition of convicts, and amidst
almost exclusively convict associations. The petitioners had still
entertained the hope that Earl Grey would have received the
reiterated decision of the constitutional representatives, to await
which decision he himself professed that the revocation of the
Order in Council was alone deferred, as a conclusive reason for a
complete change in his policy regarding transportation; but this
last hope had been painfully dispelled by the language used by his
lordship on 15th March, 1851. And the petitioners were compelled at
length, humbly, but firmly, to represent to her Majesty in person
that the subterfuges, evasions, equivocations, and breaches of
faith practiced towards those colonies by Earl Grey had unhappily
destroyed all confidence in his lordship's administration of
colonial affairs.</p>
<p>"They further represented that they were most solicitous that
their honour and happiness should be compatible with the
continuance of their present political relations with the mother
country, and the very constitution of their League prohibited the
use by them of other than moral means; but they would not disguise
from her Majesty the persuasion that what was lately but a
grievance was ripening into a quarrel, and their opinion that the
continuance of transportation in opposition to the united
resolution of Australasia leagued together against it, would peril
the connection of these colonies with Great Britain, and jeopardise
what a wiser policy might long retain, the brightest jewel of her
Majesty's Crown. They submitted, lastly, that when the oppressions
even of the supreme authority threatened desolation, men were not
to be reasoned out of the feelings of humanity, nor would they
consent to sacrifice their dearest interests for the sake of a
scrupulous adherence to those political maxims and principles which
were originally established only to preserve them. Wherefore they
besought her Majesty that in order to continue the happy connection
of these colonies with Great Britain, and to secure the present
affectionate allegiance of the colonists to her Majesty's person
and government, her Majesty would be graciously pleased to dismiss
Earl Grey from her councils, and to command her Ministers to redeem
the honour of the British Crown, by fulfilling and maintaining
inviolate the pledges touching transportation, which had been
repeatedly given by her Majesty's Ministers in her Majesty's name
to the colonies of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land."</p>
<p>In the new Legislature, two months afterwards elected, the
subject was brought prominently forward, and the following series
of resolutions were passed for transmission to the Imperial
Government:&mdash;"(1.) That the Council having had under
consideration the despatch of Earl Grey to his Excellency Sir
Charles Fitzroy, of date 10th April, 1851, and having again
deliberated on the whole question of transportation, re-affirmed
the decision of the late Council that no more convicts ought, under
any circumstances, to be sent to any part of the colony. (2.) That
the grave objections hitherto urged against the continuance of
transportation to the Australian colonies derived increased weight
from the recent discoveries of productive gold-fields, which having
been found so widely distributed throughout New South Wales and
Victoria, might also be reasonably expected to be developed in the
neighbouring colony of Van Diemen's Land. (3.) That the Council,
therefore, convinced that the transportation of criminals from the
United Kingdom would entail on the colonies, and more especially on
New South Wales, the most serious moral and social evils, and would
be wholly inefficacious as a secondary punishment, protested
against its continuance, in any form whatever, to any part of her
Majesty's Australian possessions."</p>
<p>A week or two afterwards Fitzroy forwarded to the Council a copy
of a despatch which he had just received from the Secretary of
State, enclosing the revocation, so far as New South Wales was
concerned, of the Order in Council of 4th September, 1848,
appointing places to which felons and other offenders might be
conveyed. This message was received by the House with cheers, and
the cheers were re-echoed by the colonists as soon as the news was
made public; but the victory was not yet won, as Van Diemen's Land
was still open, and the people were banded together to free the
whole of the Australian colonies from the stain and curse of
convictism. It was in December, 1851, that this revoking Order in
Council was transmitted by Fitzroy to the Legislative Council.</p>
<p>Subsequently it became known that Earl Grey had expressed his
determination to a Victorian delegate to continue transportation to
Van Diemen's Land, and on April 6th, 1852, a meeting of the league,
presided over by Cowper, was held, at which the following
resolutions were passed:&mdash;(1.) "That so long as Van Diemen's
Land continued oppressed by transportation, all the other colonies
of Australia are bound by sympathy and generosity, as well as
impelled by self-interest, to aid in her deliverance from this
clinging curse, and this meeting solemnly pledges itself to unite
and assist the Tasmanian colonists in their efforts to obtain it's
entire abolition." (2.) "That this meeting records its warm
expression of admiration and respect for the patriotic
representative members of the Van Diemen's Land Legislature in the
noble stand which they have taken in this important and vital
question." (3.) "That the determination avowed by Earl Grey to the
Victorian delegate, Mr. King, on the 25th November last, to persist
in transportation to Van Diemen's Land, and to separate Moreton Bay
from New South Wales for penal purposes, in breach of his repeated
promises, demands the indignant reprobation of this meeting, and
they accordingly bind themselves by all they hold dear and sacred
to resist to the utmost an oppression so desolating, bravely,
solemnly protesting that the responsibility of all the consequences
will remain with the oppressor." These resolutions were embodied in
an address, to be presented by the President, in the name of the
meeting, at a conference which was about being held in Hobart Town,
Tasmania.</p>
<p>Eighteen representatives attended this conference, Mr. Cowper,
the president of the League, attending as the delegate from New
South Wales. The whole question was discussed during a session
extending over several days, and among other things it was decided
to prepare a petition to the Queen embodying the solemn decision of
the whole of the Colonial Parliaments upon the subject, and to
advertise their proceedings and remonstrances in the British press,
which had been advocating the cause of the colonists. Two months
later the citizens of Sydney were called together to receive Mr.
Cowper's report of the proceedings, and that gentleman, in summing
up the account of his mission, said:&mdash;"Their friends were
prepared to try every constitutional means of obtaining redress,
but at the same time they were resolved to shew that they were in
earnest. They were determined, under every circumstance, to be rid
of this withering curse of convictism. What might be the results of
the peaceful and constitutional means they used was a question he
would not enter upon. They would, at all events, leave no means
untried, by remonstrance and argument to convince those with whom
lay the decision of the justice of their claims."</p>
<p>Cowper having narrated fully what had taken place at the
Conference, the meeting adopted the following
resolutions:&mdash;(1.) That the meeting cordially welcome the
president of the League on his return from the conference at Van
Diemen's Land, and beg to convey to him the expression of their
thanks for the gratifying manner in which he has accomplished his
mission. (2.) That they acknowledge with gratitude the firmness and
moral courage evinced by the Executive Council of the colony in
reminding Earl Grey of his Lordship's pledge, which, in their
opinion, no less than in that uniformly maintained by the
Australasian League, precludes his sending convicts to Moreton Bay
without a manifest breach of faith, and deeply regret his lordship,
instead of feeling indebted to the Council for their honest
warning, should have endeavoured to avoid its application by an
unmeaning interpretation of his former language. (3.) That the
resignation of office by Earl Grey was a matter for congratulation,
both to the colonists of Australasia and the Queen's Most Excellent
Majesty, and the meeting records its solemn conviction that the
penal policy of that Minister was sowing the seeds of disloyalty
throughout these territories, and alienating the affection of her
Majesty's subjects. (4.) That the meeting, while solemnly
denouncing the continuance of transportation to any of these
colonies, as incompatible with the permanence of British rule in
Australasia, earnestly protest against their language being
represented as that of wanton defiance, or of anti-British feeling,
prompted as it was by the deep consciousness that in this case the
sense of oppression was impressed on the whole of these feelings,
which, as a Briton's noblest heritage, gained strength amongst the
colonists; and that if the fatal alternative should continue to be
thrust upon them, of choosing between British connection in name,
and an unsullied British character in fact, the dictates of
principle and the onward course of events must, before long, lead
to the preference of the latter, at any sacrifice.</p>
<p>There was no mistaking language such as this, coming as it did
from a people who, having tasted slavery in its bitterest form and
been partially relieved therefrom, panted with agonized longing for
absolute release from the chains which still held them bound to an
accursed system. Simultaneously they were reaching out towards that
constitutional liberty which was to make them a self-governing
nation, and relieve them from the incubus of political and social
establishments which, though paternal because they were British,
were yet in an important sense distinctively foreign, inasmuch as
they were formed by a Power which ruled simply for the sake of
wringing from the people an allegiance that was valuable only on
account of the money it brought into the treasury, the keys of
which it held. At this very time the initial movements were made
towards securing to the country the absolute and inalienable right
of responsible government, freed from Crown nomination and class
ascendency; and it is a rather remarkable fact that in the very
year that transportation to the colonies was actually abolished
Wentworth and Thomson proceeded to England as a deputation charged
with the mission of securing for the new Constitution Bill which
had been passed the favour of the Imperial Parliament and the
Government. And thus the year 1854 became memorable in the annals
of Australian history as the time when freedom in its fullest sense
came to the birth.</p>
<p>One of the last despatches from the Secretary of State, received
in May, 1853, contained the following cheering passage:&mdash;"Her
Majesty's Government were unable to resist the force and justice of
those remonstrances which emanated from the Legislature and a large
portion of the people of the three colonies, and in pursuance of
the announcement made in the speech from the throne at the
commencement of the present Session of Parliament, they proposed
<i>altogether to discontinue transportation to Van Diemen's
Land</i> at as early a period as might be consistent with the
completion of arrangements which were indispensable for bringing to
a close a system which had been so long in operation."</p>
<p>Before the end of that year the colonists received with joy the
intelligence that the thing was done&mdash;that the relief for
which they had been sighing and fighting had come&mdash;that the
British Government, under the strong force of popular remonstrance
and threat, had abandoned the demoralizing work of "creating a
profligate nation, and by continual fresh supplies making and
keeping it from generation to generation the most hopelessly
corrupt community the sun ever shone upon." In more than one sense
this act was the sealing of freedom in Australia.</p>
<hr class="chap">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV_CONCLUSION" id=
"CHAPTER_XXV_CONCLUSION">CHAPTER XXV.&mdash;CONCLUSION.</a></h2>
<p>HENCEFORTH the Australian colonies should be free to work out
their own destinies, unhampered by an Imperialism that recognised
no higher use for them than a common moral rubbish heap, upon which
could be shot the criminal scum and refuse of the old-world gaols.
No longer would Australia be described, as Archbishop Whately in
his famous address in the House of Lords, in 1840, described
it&mdash;"a stronghold and seminary of wide-spreading and moral
corruption;" for by the abolishment of transportation the springs
of that moral corruption were dried up; and the new sources of
national life which had been opened by the people themselves have
proved sufficient in their strength and purity to at once satisfy
every internal moral need and sweep away every vestige of that
corruption, which had been imported, and which had been nursed and
nurtured after importation, by a system of militaryism which was as
heavy a curse as the system of convictism with which it was
associated, and which it did not long outlive.</p>
<p>It has taken time to wipe out the stain. Nearly forty years have
elapsed since the self-governing Australian Colonies (Western
Australia is still governed from Downing-street) ceased to receive
as compulsory residents men and women condemned to transportation
for shorter or longer terms by the judges of the mother country;
but as some of those who crossed the sea in custody were
comparatively young, here and there an occasional "old hand" is to
be seen, who still bears the scars, moral and physical, inflicted
while subjected to the "discipline" which in its best days was both
bloody and brutal. I have known a few of these "relics of the
past," and not a little of what I have written has been the result
of friendly interviews with them, the information supplied, in
almost every instance, having been subsequently put to the test of
comparison with official records, a few of which are still in
existence, they having escaped destruction in the fire which was
prepared, under authoritative orders, to receive them. But apart
from these isolated cases, these few age-marked records, and an
occasional rusty anklet or chain in the lumber yards of the older
prisons, very few traces of the system are now to be found.</p>
<p>The breaking down of colonial-made legal barriers between the
emancipists and those who set themselves up as superior beings to
whom only social and public privileges should be extended, and who
were distinguished for many years by the sobriquet of "Pure
Merinos," was the first step towards the establishment of that
equality which made individual and communal effort powerful in
lifting the colony clean out of the degraded and degrading position
which it was compelled to occupy as a penal settlement. And when
the pernicious convict system and the equally pernicious military
system were abolished, the work of self-elevation became
comparatively easy. The distinction between the two classes died
out even before the "old hands" on either side were removed from
the scene; and before their descendants had stepped into their
places no stranger, basing his judgment upon the manner in which
the rules of correct living was observed in any department of life
in which representatives of both classes were to be found, could
have distinguished between them. Under the operation of benign
laws, made by a liberty-loving people for their own guidance, aided
by the opening up of extensive fields for profitable labour on
wonderfully productive soil, there was a marvellously sudden dying
out of criminal propensities, where such existed, and a
correspondingly marvellous growth of those virtues which tend to
make individual and communal greatness. The old days of evil were
forgotten in the presence of the new days of good. Those who had
once worn the convict dress and eaten convicts' fare, by steady
continuance in well-doing won for themselves positions of honour,
and their former offences being blotted out they were received in
the ordinary walks of life as men amongst men, their characters as
well as their fortunes being in their own keeping. In the course of
time the line dividing the emancipists from those who had come to
the colony as free men was entirely obliterated, and as one after
another of the "old hands" on either side disappeared their places
were filled by the "sons of the soil," about whose coming and going
their neighbours did not concern themselves, provided that
industry, honesty, purity and truth were preserved in their daily
life. In the necessary commingling of the different classes no
descendant was banned because of ancestral wrong-doing; neither was
any man's worthlessness sheltered by the shadow of his father's
worth. Whatever of praise and glory was attained was won by
individual exertion, and shame and condemnation were only cast upon
the actual wrongdoer. Each person was judged, as far as possible,
according to that person's merit or demerit, and although colonial
society was not one whit purer than any other mixed community
governed by laws of civilization, it became in a short time
marvellously free from vice, the proportion of the criminal
population of the colony, after transportation had ceased, being
less than that of older and more favoured civilized
communities.</p>
<p>All things considered, the change which has taken place in the
mother colony of the Australian group since the announcement was
made from Government House, Sydney, by the representative of Her
Majesty, that "transportation has now ceased" has been nothing
short of the marvellous. New South Wales has nothing to be ashamed
of, but a great deal whereof to boast, and although her patriotic
citizens cannot, if they would, ignore the fact of the colony's
original penal character, they can challenge anyone to point to any
community under the sun whose history exhibits such stirring and
romantic incidents, or which furnishes such instances of rapid
growth and solid advancement in the direction of ripe nationhood.
It was surely in the spirit of prophecy that the poet Thomas
Campbell sang of New South Wales, more than sixty years ago, on
seeing emigrants about to embark for the New Land:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Untrack'd in deserts lies the marble mine,<br>
Undug the ore that 'midst the roof shall shine;<br>
Unborn the hands&mdash;but born they are to be&mdash;<br>
Fair Australia that I shall give to thee.<br>
Proud temple-domes, with galleries winding high,<br>
So vast in space, so just in symmetry,<br>
They widen to the contemplating eye,<br>
With colonnaded aisles in long array,<br>
And windows that enrich the flood of day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is no part of my task to trace in detail the leaps and bounds
which New South Wales has made during the half-century that has
elapsed since the bird of freedom began freely to move its wings.
Another must take up that work and describe more fully the increase
of population, the spread of settlement, the building of cities,
the extension of railways, the establishment of industries, and the
extra-ordinary success which has waited upon undaunted enterprise
and skilfully directed energy. Suffice it for me to say that in
material progress New South Wales stands without a peer; while its
social life exhibits one of the greatest and grandest reformations
that has ever transpired on the face of the earth. From being a
huge unwalled gaol, into which some of the worst of the criminals
of Great Britain were cast, it has passed into a free and
prosperous community, having completely outgrown its origin and
utterly effaced the traces of it; and as the last of those old-time
traditions and vested interests which make for individual rather
than communal good are abandoned or swept away, more bright will
shine its lustre as a gem in the British Crown, or as the head of a
great political confederation of sovereign and independent states
among the nations of the earth.</p>
<p>Men of small minds may refer to early Australian history with a
sneer, but no sneer will be able to detract from the merit which
belongs to those by whose efforts the colony was lifted from the
condition of moral darkness and degradation which has been
imperfectly depicted in this "Story of the Convicts," to the
condition of social, commercial, and political distinction which it
enjoys in this year of grace, one thousand eight hundred and eighty
nine.</p>
