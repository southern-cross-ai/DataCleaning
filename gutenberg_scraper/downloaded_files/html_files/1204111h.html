<h2>THE VOYAGE OF THE<br>
<i>Endeavour</i><br>
<br>
BY<br>
<br>
G. ARNOLD WOOD M.A.</h2>
<h3>LATE PROFESSOR OF HISTORY<br>
UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY</h3>
<h4>First Published 1926</h4>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-000" id="ch-000"></a>FOREWORD</h2>
<p><i>The Voyage of the Endeavour</i> is undoubtedly one of the
most delightfully readable and authentic accounts ever written of
Captain James Cook's first memorable voyage of exploration. Its
republication at this time commemorates not only the 200th
anniversary of the discovery by Cook of the east coast of
Australia, but also the work of an historian who was a pioneer
among Australian historical writers.</p>
<p>G. Arnold Wood came to this country as a young man of 25 after
distinguishing himself at Balliol College, Oxford, to become the
first Challis Professor of History in the University of Sydney.
There, singlehanded, he founded a great history school, (it was not
until he reached the age of 50 that he was given an assistant).
Very early in his long tenure of his chair at the University he
developed a keen interest in the exploration and early settlement
of his adopted country. He became a leading member of the Royal
Australian Historical Society and wrote two books which broke new
ground in the study of Australian history, <i>The Discovery of
Australia</i> and this present small volume <i>The Voyage of the
Endeavour</i>.</p>
<p>Professor Wood brought a freshness to the study of Australian
history that was at that time rare and wrote in a manner that was
pleasant for a layman to read and at the same time useful to the
student. He stimulated in New South Wales an interest in our
history which has grown into a broad swelling movement from which
flows a constant stream of books on Australian historical
subjects.</p>
<p>He strove after and achieved authenticity. This present text is
thus exactly as Professor Wood wrote it. Some of his comparisons
may now be somewhat outdated but they were valid in their time and
still prove clearly the points that he was making. He was able to
use the then newly discovered manuscript journal of Captain James
Cook and he drew faithfully from the original. The result is a book
that can be recommended to the young as well as to older readers.
In my opinion there is no more accurate or vivid account of Cook's
first voyage.</p>
<p><i>The Voyage of the Endeavour</i> has stood the test of time;
the first edition appeared in 1926 to be followed by reprints in
1929, 1933 and 1944. The Royal Australian Historical Society is
proud to be associated with the issue of this new edition and
thanks the Captain Cook Bicentenary Committee of New South Wales
for its financial help in publication.</p>

<h2>PART I. HOW AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND WERE DISCOVERED</h2>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-1-1" id="ch-1-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>HOW THE PORTUGUESE AND THE SPANIARDS VOYAGED IN THE PACIFIC,
AND SETTLED IN THE MOLUCCAS (OR SPICE ISLANDS) AND IN THE
PHILIPPINES.</h3>
<p>One reason why the voyage of the <i>Endeavour</i> is so
interesting to us is that Captain Cook, her commander, was the
first European who sailed all round New Zealand, and the first
European who sailed along the <i>East</i> coast of Australia. It
would be wrong to say that Captain Cook discovered New Zealand and
Australia, for parts of New Zealand and of Australia had been
discovered more than a century before the <i>Endeavour</i> sailed.
But his discoveries first made people understand the coastline of
the whole of New Zealand, and of the whole of Australia; and they
also made Britishers for the first time begin to think that it
might be a good plan, sooner or later, to make British colonies in
those lands.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best plan is first to tell the story of earlier
voyages, so that we may understand what men knew about lands in the
South Sea when the <i>Endeavour</i> sailed in 1768; and, when they
knew nothing, what they guessed, and expected to find.</p>
<p>It was not till the 15th Century that European seamen sailed
south of the Equator. They had quite enough to do in Europe. Their
ships, good enough for inland Seas like the Mediterranean, were not
good enough to sail forth into unknown Oceans which stretched no
man knew whither. And, moreover, even if their ships had been good
enough, seamen would not have dared to leave the coast. For they
had no compass to tell them which was North, South, East and West;
and they had none of the instruments which now enable seamen, by
observing sun, moon and stars, to know where in the world they are,
and what they must do in order to get home again.</p>
<p>And, further, what reason could you give a sensible man for
sailing South? The further South you sailed, he would tell you, the
hotter you grew. You sailed into a "roasted sea"; and, if you went
on, you would in the end, no doubt, yourself be roasted. And if you
had luck, and got through only half-roasted into cooler weather,
what would you find there? Greek geographers long ago had said, it
is true, that the world was a globe, and that probably there were
big, rich and populous lands in the South as well as in the North.
But, how absurd was this opinion! A man standing on the down side
of a globe will fall off!</p>
<p>"See!" said one writer, "I'll draw you a globe with four men
standing on it. Look at it! Turn it round whichever way you like!
Come now! tell me, can <i>all</i> these men rightly be said to be
standing upright? Is it not as certain as anything can be that all
but one of them will fall off?"</p>
<p>In later days a few scholars came to understand that it would be
possible for both Englishmen and Australians&mdash;if there were
Australians&mdash;to stand upright at the same time. But what
reason was there to believe that there were Australians, and that,
if there were, Australians were people worth knowing? What reason,
in short, could you give good enough to persuade a sensible man
that it was worth his while to run the risk of being roasted in
order to find out what perchance might be the state of the world
down South?</p>
<p>But in the 15th Century, for the first time, it became possible
to give two reasons good enough to make sensible men change their
minds. The first reason was that changes had taken place in Asia
which made it very desirable to get to Asia by <i>sea</i>; and the
best way to get to Asia by sea seemed to be by sailing Southward
round Africa. There were certain good things which came from Asia,
and only from Asia, which every lady and every gentleman must have.
Ladies and gentlemen cannot live as ladies and gentlemen ought to
live, unless they have muslins and silks and jewels and spices; and
muslins and silks and jewels and spices came from Asia, and from
nowhere else. Hitherto they had come by caravans to ports in the
Mediterranean, and had been taken by ships of Venice and Genoa to
all the countries of Europe. But now savage Turks had captured
those ports, and had cut the throat of the trade with Asia. What
misery! What dismay! Is life worth living without muslins, without
silks, without jewels, without spices? No! If they can no longer
come from Asia to us, we must go to Asia for them. And, as we
cannot go by land, we must go by sea&mdash;round Africa. And, if
our ships and nautical instruments are not good enough for such a
voyage, we must make them good enough.</p>
<p>So&mdash;and this is the second reason that made sensible men
change their minds&mdash;ships and nautical instruments had been
made that were good enough. Even before this time great
improvements had been made. The compass and other instruments had
been invented by which seamen were able to find out where they
were, and where other places were. And ships had been built that
had some chance of sailing right into the unknown, and of coming
home again. And now the idea came into the mind of a Prince of
Portugal, Henry "the Navigator," to make further improvements so
great that his seamen might be able to push through "the roasted
sea"&mdash;which after all might prove to be no worse than
half-roasted&mdash;till they came to Africa's tip, if Africa had a
tip, to round it, and to sail up Africa's other side till they came
to Asia.</p>
<p>Prince Henry was called "the Navigator," not because he
navigated, but because he made it possible for people to
navigate.</p>
<p>"Stick close to your desk (says the song) And never go to sea,
And you all may be the rulers Of the Queen's Navee!"</p>
<p>Prince Henry stuck close to his desk, and never went to sea; but
at his desk he studied navigation; and, helped by the most famous
scholars in Europe, he made the best ocean-going ships, and the
best naval instruments that had ever yet been made. And voyage
after voyage, Portuguese seamen, in Prince Henry's ships, groped
their slow long way down the African coast.</p>
<p>It was a very slow way; and when Prince Henry died, after 42
years' hard work, his captains had sailed only as far as a ship now
steams in four days! But, though progress was slow it was sure. The
seamen sailed through "the roasted sea"; and, hardly worse roasted
than before, they came in time to cooler weather. Yet it was a very
long way&mdash;far longer than they had hoped. Africa lengthened
itself out before you, till you feared it had no tip. But at last,
in 1486, they came to the tip, rounded it and called it "the Cape
of Good Hope." On Christmas Day, 1497, a Portuguese captain, named
Vasco da Gama, sailed round the Cape, and came to a land which he
named "Natal"&mdash;the land of Christ's birthday. He sailed along
the East coast of Africa, struck across to India, landed, and asked
for spices!</p>
<p>The Portuguese made trade-settlements in East Africa, in Arabia,
in Persia and in India; and in a few years they were overlords of
the whole Indian Ocean, ruling a sea-empire whose frontier was "a
jagged semi-circle of over 15,000 miles." But what especially
interests us is their voyages towards Australia. What they wanted
more than anything else was <i>spices</i>, especially cloves, which
grew only in a group of tiny islands&mdash;Ternate, Tidore,
Amboyna, Banda&mdash;called the Moluccas or Spice Islands. Now the
way from India to the Spice Islands was through the Straits of
Malacca, the Ocean Junction of all trade-routes between East and
West. In 1511 the Portuguese captured Malacca; and three ships
sailed through the Straits and then along the North coasts of the
islands that stretch like stepping-stones from Sumatra to New
Guinea and Australia&mdash;"so near the one to the other," said the
seamen, "that they seem at first to be one entire and main land."
If they had turned South, and had sailed through one of the narrow
and dangerous passages between these islands, they would very soon
have come to Australia. But they were looking, not for Australia,
but for the Spice Islands. So they turned, not South, but North,
and they found&mdash;actually found&mdash;the Spice Islands, the
world's desire! And a Portuguese captain, Francisco Serrano,
settled in them, did a huge trade in spices, and thought himself
the luckiest man in the world.</p>
<p>Now Serrano had a dear friend, named Ferdinand Magellan, who had
fought by his side in battles in the East and had now got back to
Portugal; and Serrano wished that the friend, who had shared his
dangers, should also share his luck. So he wrote to Magellan to
tell him the good news. He had found, he said, "yet another new
world, larger and richer than that found by Gama!" Magellan,
soldier-seaman, strong and true as steel, was eager to go. But he
had been listening to voyagers' tales, and had been studying
strange new maps, and his plan was to go to the Spice Islands by a
new route. And, to understand this new route, we must see the
wonderful discoveries that had by this time been made by other
seamen.</p>
<p>While the Portuguese were groping their slow long way down the
coast of Africa, Christopher Columbus was wondering whether he
could not make a short cut to Asia by sailing West. Clearly if you
sailed West from Europe, you were bound, if only you could sail far
enough to sail into Asia. The question was, how far you would have
to sail. Columbus believed&mdash;nay, he was quite sure!&mdash;that
Japan was only 2500 miles away. That is to say, he thought that the
Eastern coast of Asia was no further from Europe than the Eastern
coast of America actually is. He hoped, therefore, to reach Asia by
a way as much shorter than the Portuguese way as to-day a voyage to
America is shorter than a voyage round the Cape to India. Look at a
map and see how much shorter it is.</p>
<p>After a vast deal of trouble, Columbus persuaded Ferdinand and
Isabella, King and Queen of Spain, to give him command of a ship.
And in 1492, six years before Gama reached India, he sailed
Westward, and hoped to get there first. He sailed 2500 miles; and,
as he had expected, he found an island which he believed was Japan:
we call it Hayti. And he found a long coast which he believed was
the coast of China: we call it the coast of Cuba. And in another
voyage more Southward, he came to the mouth of a huge river, which
he believed must drain a huge continent to the South of Asia: we
call the river the Orinoco, and we call the huge continent South
America. And, in his last voyage, he believed that he had nearly
discovered the Straits of Malacca in what we call the Isthmus of
Panama. He understood the natives to say that the Straits were
close by, and that, after passing through them, in ten days' sail
he would reach the mouth of the Ganges.</p>
<p>Columbus always believed that he had reached Asia. But later
voyagers gradually came to understand that the coasts they were
sailing along were the coasts, not of the Old World, but of a New
World that stretched far North and far South as a barrier between
Europe and Asia. That was bad. But, after all, could you not find a
passage through this barrier? If so, you might still make a short
cut, and reach Asia in a few days. So now began the search for a
passage. Some, like Columbus, believed there was a passage through
the Isthmus of Panama. But the search for it was in vain. In 1513,
Balboa&mdash;"the man who knew not what it was to be
deterred"&mdash;climbed a peak in Darien, and saw a sea on the
other side&mdash;"the Sea of the South"! But no one could say how
big was the sea, nor how far away was Asia. Others looked for a
passage further North&mdash;through Virginia, up the Hudson River,
up the St. Lawrence, or through some North-West passage; but they
also looked in vain. Others sailed Southward, and hoped to find a
passage through the "new world" that was taking the shape of South
America. And among those who felt that a passage would be found
here was Ferdinand Magellan, the Portuguese captain, to whom
Serrano had sent news of the "other new world" he had found in the
Spice Islands. Magellan determined to go to the Spice Islands by a
passage he would find&mdash;he was sure of it&mdash;by sailing
further South than any seaman had yet sailed. Once through that
passage, he might still perhaps get to Asia by a short cut.</p>
<p>As the King of Portugal did not approve his plan, Magellan went
to the King and Queen of Spain, and persuaded them to give him the
command of five ships. "They are very old and patched," said a
Portuguese who saw them, and he hoped they would never be heard of
again. And in 1520, sailing in these rotten ships, Magellan found
the Strait that bears his name, passed through it,
and&mdash;instead of making a short cut&mdash;plunged into "a sea
so vast that the human mind can scarcely grasp it." After a very
long and very terrible voyage, in which the seamen ate sawdust and
leather, and bought rats as "a delicacy," he came at last to the
Philippine Islands. He had sailed a course so northerly that he
came nowhere near Australia.</p>
<p>In the Philippine Islands, Magellan fought the heathen to make
them Christians, and was killed. But the Spaniards sailed on in one
of his ships, named the <i>Victoria</i>, and reached the Spice
Islands. They "bought cloves like mad," and then sailed for home.
As they feared to meet the Portuguese&mdash;for the Portuguese
allowed none but Portuguese to trade in the islands&mdash;they did
not go by the Portuguese way, but struck Southward by a passage
between the islands. They called at the island of Timor, and their
course cannot have been very far from the North-West coast of
Australia, though it is unlikely that they saw it. And so the
<i>Victoria</i> rounded the Cape, and sailed home to Spain, the
first ship to put a girdle round the earth&mdash;in three and a
half years!</p>
<p>So both Portuguese and Spaniards had sailed fairly near
Australia, but they had not seen Australia; and I do not think
that, in the 16th Century, they ever saw Australia. The Portuguese
sailed to their settlement in the Spice Islands by way of the East
coast of Africa, India, and the Straits of Malacca; a way that
would not take them in sight of Australia. They came to know the
North coast of Sumatra, of Java and of the string of islands east
of Java. And they came to New Guinea, and called it a "large
island," which seems to show that they knew something about the
South coast, as well as about the North. But I feel pretty sure
they never reached Australia; though they may possibly have heard
islanders talk of a very unpleasant land in the South to which you
were sometimes driven by storms, and whence you got away as fast as
you could, for it was a land in which no sensible person would live
who had a chance to live anywhere else.</p>
<p>And the Spaniards were equally unlikely to see Australia. After
a time they made a settlement in the Philippine Islands; but they
sailed thither from Mexico&mdash;for the way through the Straits of
Magellan was given up as too long, too dangerous, too terrible. And
their voyages between the Philippines and Mexico did not take them
within sight of Australia; though, like the Portuguese, they got
some little knowledge of New Guinea, and wondered whether it was an
island. Of what lay further South no one knew anything, and
therefore everyone could guess what he liked.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-1-2" id="ch-1-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>HOW THE SPANIARDS SOUGHT FOR A CONTINENT IN THE SOUTH SEA, AND
HOW THEY FOUND (1) THE SOLOMON ISLANDS, (2) THE NEW HEBRIDES, AND
(3) TORRES STRAIT.</h3>
<p>What was down South? Was it an empty ocean? Or was it an ocean
crowded with islands? Or was it, in the main, a continent? Various
guesses were made. But the more geographers thought about the
matter, the more they came to the opinion that the last of these
guesses was the right one. The Unknown South must in the main be a
continent. There were continents in the North; why not in the
South? Nay, as there were continents in the North, there must be
continents in the South. The world, argued the geographers, is a
rolling ball, and a ball can only roll as a ball should roll if it
is round, and its sides are of the same weight. Now in the known
world there is far too much weight in the North; all Europe, nearly
all Asia, and the most solid parts of Africa and America. To
balance this weight in the North, there must be weight in the
South. For if there were nothing in the South to balance the weight
in the North, the world would not roll about in the orderly way in
which she does roll about. If her shape had been more like that of
a pear than that of an apple, with more weight at one end than at
the other, she would not roll, but would wobble or bounce, and we
should have a pretty world-sick sort of time.</p>
<p>Men of science to-day do not think that this was a good
argument. The South, they say, could be heavy enough even if it had
no continent; for continents are not so heavy as the masses of
metal which press down the ocean beds. But 16th Century geographers
were quite sure that their argument was good, and indeed
unanswerable. And they were all the more sure of this because they
thought that an early traveller named Marco Polo had said that he
had actually got news of a rich continent South of Java, where
there was "gold in incredible quantity." (This was a mistake, for
Marco had really been talking about Siam, and the gentleman to whom
he was talking had misunderstood him.) So geographers drew on their
maps a Southern Continent which pretty well filled up the Unknown
South, and they said that this was the land of which Marco Polo had
heard.</p>
<p>But, as no one had ever seen this continent, each map-maker
could draw it in the shape he liked best. A Portuguese map-maker
asked you to believe that one of the islands to the East of
Java&mdash;remember that the Portuguese knew only the North coasts
of these islands&mdash;was the tip of a huge continent which
stretched far South below Java, and he called it "Java the Great."
He drew the continent in a way that made it cover the ground that
is covered by Australia, and a great deal more ground too. Some
writers think that this map-maker knew a good deal about Australia.
But I do not think so. It seems to me that the map-maker, feeling
pretty sure that there must be a huge continent in the South,
thought it was just as likely to be to the South of Java as
anywhere else. So he put a continent in the map just below Java,
and called it "Java the Great," in order to warn people that if a
continent ever was found there, it would, of course, like Java,
belong to Portugal.</p>
<p>This Portuguese map has been lost. But French geographers had
somehow got hold of it, and they used it in making their own maps.
These maps, however, seem to have been little known, and no one
seems to have had much belief in them. Seamen never sailed to look
for "Java the Great." But other geographers drew a quite different
map of the Southern Continent, which was generally accepted as
true, and which led to voyages of discovery of great interest to
us.</p>
<p>These geographers were much excited by the story of Magellan's
famous voyage through the Straits. As he sailed through them, he
had seen to the South a land with many fires burning, and had
called it "Tierra del Fuego," Land of Fires. Well then, what is
Tierra del Fuego? Clearly, said these geographers, it must be a
promontory of the unknown Southern Continent! Magellan, it is true,
had seen only a few hundred miles of coast; but no doubt that coast
went stretching across the ocean, slightly to the West of the
course of Magellan's ships. And where did it appear next? In New
Guinea, of course, or thereabouts; for one cannot be sure whether
New Guinea is an island, or is, like Tierra del Fuego, a part of
the continent. So these geographers drew a coastline all the way
from Tierra del Fuego to New Guinea, and wrote behind
it&mdash;"This is the Southern Continent, called by some the
Magellanican region from its discoverer"&mdash;though, in truth,
all that Magellan had discovered of it was the northern coast of
Tierra del Fuego! Then they drew the coastline of the unknown
continent Westward from New Guinea, making a big bay in it, because
they had to find room for an island which they thought&mdash;quite
wrongly&mdash;had been visited in that part of the world by the
early traveller, Marco Polo. Then they made a great promontory grow
up that nearly reached Java, and wrote on it that these were the
regions of which Marco Polo had told. Then the coastline of their
continent fell steeply to the South-West&mdash;slightly Eastward of
the homeward course of the <i>Victoria</i>&mdash;and, after
rounding the Cape of Good Hope, ran across the South Atlantic, and
joined the Eastern coast or Tierra del Fuego!</p>
<p>The people most interested in maps of this shape were the
Spaniards, and especially the Spaniards of Peru. Why, you have only
to sail Westward from Peru for a few days, and you are bound to run
into a continent bigger than either Asia or America! And what a
continent it will be! Straight opposite Peru, is it not certain to
be as rich as Peru, and richer! Is it not indeed likely that the
Incas came from it to Peru, and left behind them even greater
riches than they brought with them? Will it not prove a land full
of gold and silver and jewels and spices&mdash;of everything that
the heart of man can desire and that the stomach of man can enjoy?
Will you not find in it millions and millions of natives whom you
can&mdash;if you like&mdash;make Christians, and whom you
can&mdash;if you like&mdash;make slaves? Here is your chance to do
what Columbus did, nay to do something far more splendid!</p>
<p>In 1567 two Spanish ships sailed from Peru, under a Spanish
nobleman named Menda&ntilde;a, to look for the golden continent. They
sailed West, on a course which would have taken them&mdash;had they
gone far enough&mdash;to Cooktown, two hundred years before Cook!
But, as they saw no land, they changed their course to North-West,
and discovered, not Australia, but the Solomon Islands. They
thought at first that they had discovered a continent "an extent of
land that seemed to have no limit"; and, at all events, a continent
must be very near. They looked hard for gold; and, though they
found no gold to put in pocket, they felt quite sure that soil and
stones were full of it. They sailed home with gold, not in pocket,
but in brain. And, over their wine in taverns, they talked gold so
loudly and so everlastingly that people came to think they must
have discovered "those isles whence Solomon fetched gold to adorn
the Temple at Jerusalem"; and the islands became known as the
"Solomon Islands."</p>
<p>Menda&ntilde;a was eager to sail again, to take possession and to found
a colony. But there were long delays. And when at last in 1595 he
sailed in search of the golden islands he had discovered
twenty-eight years before, he failed to find them; and two hundred
years passed before they were found again. They were lost; and
map-makers began to wonder whether they had ever been found. Now
this losing of the Solomons was a strange chance. For had the
Spaniards settled in them after Menda&ntilde;a's discovery, it is likely
that, sailing thence, they would have discovered Australia two
hundred years before the <i>Endeavour</i> sailed.</p>
<p>But there was still a chance that Spaniards would discover
Australia. The man who sailed as Chief Pilot with Menda&ntilde;a in the
voyage of 1595, was a Portuguese seaman, named Pedro Fernandez de
Quiros. Portugal at that time was ruled by the King of Spain, and
Portuguese seamen sailed in Spanish ships, though Spanish seamen
were very much inclined to dislike them. The business of a Pilot on
a Spanish ship was to know all that was known about navigation; and
there were few Pilots who knew so much as Quiros. And there was no
one who felt such hot desire to find the Continent of the South.
For he was a missionary in spirit. His wish was, not to get gold,
but to get souls; to wrest millions of souls from the Devil, and to
lead them to Christ.</p>
<p>He persuaded the King of Spain to help this noble plan; and in
1605 he sailed from Peru, in command of three ships, on a course
that would, had he sailed far enough, have brought him to New
Zealand or Australia. He had hoped to sail in the summer, and to
have had good weather for a voyage in the South. But there had been
delays; and the seamen, feeling little interest in the venture,
refused to sail South in the winter. So Quiros, like Menda&ntilde;a in
1567, unwillingly changed his course to North-West; and he sailed
on till he came, not to Australia, but to the islands which Cook
explored 170 years later, and called the "New Hebrides."</p>
<p>But Quiros was sure that he had found the Continent, and that it
stretched as far as the South Pole. He called it "Austrialia of the
Holy Spirit." I think he would have called it "Australia," had it
not seemed a good plan to put an i into the middle of the word in
order to please the King of Spain, whose ancestors ruled Austria.
Then he sailed Southward "to make out for certain whether it was
mainland." But the ships were driven back by a hurricane. It was
mid-winter now. The seamen were weary of the voyage, and were
thankful to a hurricane that blew them North, and gave them a
chance to force the captain to sail for home. Quiros was very
ill&mdash;he had indeed been very ill all through the voyage. The
seamen disliked him as a Portuguese, and a man of dreams. He was
forced once more to let them have their way, and sorrowfully he
sailed for Peru, dreaming&mdash;always dreaming&mdash;of the
foundation in time to come of a Christian colony&mdash;a "New
Jerusalem"&mdash;in the Southern Land of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Quiros never had a chance to make his dreams come true. But news
came that the commander of one of his ships, Louis Vaez de Torres,
had made a wonderfully interesting voyage. Torres was a
matter-of-fact man of strong character, determined to stick to
plans, and to have his own way. "My temper," he wrote, "was
different from that of Captain Pedro Fernandez de Quiros!" Neither
hurricanes nor seamen should stop him! He sheltered in a harbour
from the hurricane which blew Quiros Northward and then, with the
other two ships, sailed South-West on a course which, had he sailed
far enough, would have taken him to Brisbane 218 years before
Brisbane was founded. It was a brave deed. "We had at this time
nothing but bread and water; it was the height of winter, with sea,
wind, and ill-will against us. All this did not prevent me from
sailing South to 21&deg;, for the ship was good. It was proper to act
in this way, for these are not voyages performed every day, nor
could Your Majesty otherwise be properly informed."</p>
<p>But, seeing "no sign of land," even Torres had to give up the
search for the continent, and go on the course which Quiros had
planned&mdash;which was now to make for the East end of New Guinea,
and to sail along its fairly well-known Northern coast to the
Philippine Islands. He came to the East end of New Guinea&mdash;and
met winds that made it impossible to get round! What was he to do?
The only plan seemed to be to sail West along the South coast of
New Guinea&mdash;to sail, that is, through the most dangerous sea
in the world, bristling with islands, sandbanks, coral reefs, both
above water and below water, and with no certainty that there was
any way out of it at all&mdash;for the map-makers could not agree
whether New Guinea was an island or part of an unknown
continent!</p>
<p>Yet Torres, the hero, sailed West, and he got through! Between
the 10th of August, and the 18th of October, 1606, probably between
the 12th and the 15th September, he&mdash;first of
Europeans&mdash;sailed through the strait that is now called by his
name. On his North was New Guinea. On his South was
Australia:&mdash;but how was Torres to know that? All he saw was
"some very large islands." One of them, perhaps, was Cape York. But
Torres had never heard of Cape York, and little dreamed that the
"island" was the tip of a great continent. Away sailed the
matter-of-fact man, glad, and with good reason, to have escaped
alive from the lurking dangers of the worst of all possible
seas.</p>
<p>He came to the Philippine Islands, and wrote a very short letter
to the King of Spain, which tells all that we shall ever know of
this wonderful voyage. The King read the letter, and put it away in
a pigeon-hole; and it was not printed till 200 years later! A
Spanish writer, named Arias, got the news, and wrote a little
book&mdash;it was printed in 1640&mdash;in which he said that
Torres had sailed South of New Guinea. But the little book was
forgotten; and it was not till a few years before the sailing of
the <i>Endeavour</i>, that it was read again&mdash;by an
Englishman, Alexander Dalrymple. He told what he had read to Mr.
Joseph Banks, who sailed on the <i>Endeavour</i>; and it was,
perhaps, partly on this account that the captain who sailed through
Torres Strait the second time, was Captain James Cook.</p>

<h3>HOW THE DUTCH SETTLED IN JAVA, AND DISCOVERED TWO AND A HALF OF
THE FOUR SIDES OF AUSTRALIA, A BIT OF TASMANIA, AND A BIT OF NEW
ZEALAND.</h3>
<p>If Torres saw Australia&mdash;we cannot be sure that he
did&mdash;he was not the first European who saw Australia. About
March 1606&mdash;six months before Torres sailed through the
strait&mdash;a Dutch ship, the <i>Duyfken</i>, coming from the
West, sailed along the Southern coast of New Guinea, crossed the
strait&mdash;wondering whether it <i>was</i> a strait&mdash;and
then sailed a good way down what <i>we</i> call Cape York
Peninsula. So <i>Dutchmen</i> were the first Europeans who
certainly saw Australia; and, during the next thirty-eight years,
Dutchmen discovered all that was known of Australia and of New
Zealand when Captain Cook sailed in the <i>Endeavour</i>.</p>
<p>The Dutch came to the East because they were at war with Spain.
We remember how, while Elizabeth ruled England, the tyranny of
Philip II. and the cruelty of Alva made the Dutch rise in
rebellion, fight their War of Independence, and found the Dutch
Republic. Now the Dutch fought this war, as much as they possibly
could, on <i>sea</i>; for, while the Spaniards were at that time
the best soldiers in the world, the Dutch and the English were the
best seamen in the world. Thousands of the Dutch were fishermen,
more at home on sea than on land, and always ready for a big
voyage. And their merchants, the best men of business in Europe,
were always ready to send their splendid ships to trade with every
country in the world&mdash;no country was too far away. Now
merchant ships in those days easily became Dreadnoughts; and the
Dutchmen soon had a fleet of two thousand war-ships manned by
seamen "accustomed," as they boasted, "from our cradle to the
ocean," who find it "difficult <i>not</i> to conquer soldiers and
landsmen, qualmish at the smell of bilge-water, and sickening at
the roll of the waves!" They smashed Spanish Armadas off the Dutch
coast; they smashed them in the Mediterranean; and they went on
smashing them till they smashed them at the end of the earth, and
grabbed the spice-trade, which hitherto none but Spaniards and
Portuguese might touch. For just as easily as a merchant ship
became a Dreadnought, a Dreadnought became a merchant ship, and
came home after victory, brimming over with cloves and nutmegs.</p>
<p>For nowhere did the Dutch as much wish to trade as in the Far
East where the spices grew. In a few years they overthrew the
Portuguese&mdash;who at this time were, as we have seen, subjects
of the King of Spain&mdash;took their place as over-lords of the
Indian Ocean, and made a Sea-Empire which spread "from Madagascar
to Japan, from New Guinea to the Red Sea." They occupied St. Helena
and the Cape as ocean taverns on the long sea-road between East and
West. They occupied Mauritius, as a place whence they might explore
the far South. They traded in the Red Sea, and in the Persian Gulf.
They conquered Ceylon, and made trade-settlements in India. They
captured the great Ocean Junction of Malacca, and passed the
straits. They traded in China and Japan. They conquered the Spice
Islands. In the big rich island of Java, they built the big rich
city of Batavia, and sent ships to explore the unknown seas in the
South. And that is why Dutchmen first saw Australia.</p>
<p>But we wonder, perhaps, why not Englishmen? For Englishmen also
were at war with Philip of Spain. Englishmen also smashed Spanish
Armadas. Englishmen also were traders, eager to get shiploads of
cloves and nutmegs. And, in truth, Englishmen came to the Spice
Islands before the Dutch. Drake came to them in his voyage round
the world; and he made a treaty with a King of the Spice Islands
which gave Englishmen&mdash;at least so Englishmen said&mdash;the
sole right to buy spices. And a few years later Thomas Cavendish
came the same way, and brought home stories of "the incomparable
wealth of that country." "If it please Her Majesty," he said, "with
a very small power she may take spoil of them all." So English
traders, like Dutch traders, sailed well-armed to Indian Seas,
smashed Portuguese ships, captured Portuguese forts, and brought
home "precious cargoes." Like the Dutch traders, too, they made
settlements in the Persian Gulf, in India, in the Spice Islands, in
Java. Wherever Dutchmen came, there also came their dear old
friends, the English; and one might guess that Dutchmen and
Englishmen would probably turn up in Australia about the same
time.</p>
<p>But in fact the first Englishman who turned up in Australia was
William Dampier, who turned up in 1688, eighty-two years after the
first Dutchman had turned up in 1606. And after Dampier's second
visit in 1700, seventy more years passed before the next Englishman
turned up&mdash;Captain James Cook. And the reason was that, in the
Far East, Dutch and English, the dear old friends, became bitter
enemies&mdash;and the Dutch won. The Spice Islands, it was true,
had spices enough for Dutch and English and everybody else, and the
reasonable and fair thing was to share them. But that was not the
17th Century way of doing business. A nation in those days must
have, not a share of a trade, however big, but the whole of it.
<i>Greedy</i> must have <i>All</i>. "No other nation in the world,"
said Dutchmen in plain Dutch, "shall have the least part." And they
got their way. With great cruelty they drove Englishmen out of the
islands altogether. And the mean and unpatriotic Stuart King,
Charles I., put Dutch money into his pocket, and did nothing! So
Englishmen had to be content with what then seemed the second-best.
They withdrew to India. Dutchmen had the islands to themselves. And
that is why Dutchmen, and not Englishmen, first saw Australia.</p>
<p>Dutchmen came to Australia by two paths:&mdash;</p>
<p>Firstly, as we have seen, they sailed along the South coast of
New Guinea, till they came to a very dangerous tangle of islands,
and sandbanks, and reefs. Whether there was a way through the
tangle they could only guess. The seamen in the <i>Duyfken</i>
(1606) guessed there was a way through. But when the seamen in a
later voyage in the <i>Pera</i> and the <i>Arnhem</i> in 1623 tried
to find it, they were "caught in the shallows as in a trap," and
were very glad to get out of the trap by the way they got in. Their
opinion was that it was not a passage, but a "shallow bight" or
bay; though, after all, it was impossible to be sure. Anyway, the
Dutch ships had to sail South past the tangle, whatever it might
be, and they soon came to solid coastline again running South. It
was what we call the Western coast of Cape York peninsula; but this
the Dutchmen could not possibly know. If the tangle was not a
passage, but a bay, this coast must be part of New Guinea, and they
called it "New Guinea"&mdash;calling our New Guinea "West New
Guinea."</p>
<p>They sailed down this coast nearly to the bottom of what they
called the Gulf of Carpentaria, after the name of Governor-General
Carpentier. But was it really a gulf? Or was it a passage right
down South? One could only guess. Either a gulf or a passage it
must be. For the <i>Arnhem</i>, one of the Dutch ships of 1623, was
blown Westward across it, and discovered a land that was named
"Arnhemsland." And later (in 1636) another Dutch ship came to a
land, pretty near Arnhemsland which was named after the new
Governor-General, "Van Diemen's Land"&mdash;a Van Diemen's Land in
the <i>North</i>, observe, which we must distinguish from the more
famous Van Diemen's Land in the <i>South</i>, discovered six years
later.</p>
<p>Secondly, Dutch seamen came to Australia by a quite different
path. They were sailing from the Cape to Java; and, instead of
sailing by the old way along the coast of Africa, they tried a new
way which proved far quicker. They sailed about 4000 miles Eastward
from the Cape, before they turned North. Now if you sail about 4000
miles, or a little more, Eastward from the Cape and then aim at
Java, you are bound to see the West coast of Australia; indeed you
will be lucky if you don't actually run on to it, and get wrecked;
as several Dutch ships actually <i>were</i> wrecked on the Abrolhos
Islands. Captain after captain saw the coast of "the South Land,"
as they called it; and bit by bit their discoveries were pieced
together till, in 1628, a Dutch geographer was able to draw a
wonderfully accurate map which gave the Western coast of Australia
from Cape Leeuwin to a river they called Willems River near
North-West Cape, and the Southern coast from Cape Leeuwin to the
Islands of St. Peter and St. Francis, about the head of the great
Australian Bight.</p>
<p>So Dutchmen had discovered three separate scraps of
coast&mdash;(1) the Western coast of our Cape York Peninsula, which
they thought was probably a part of New Guinea; (2) Arnhemsland and
Van Diemen's Land (of the North); (3) the coast between Willems
River (near North-West Cape), and the head of the Australian Bight.
And all these coasts were very bad in every respect. West and South
were just as bad as North: "the most arid and barren region that
could be found anywhere on the earth." Nothing grew that you could
eat. You were lucky if you could dig up a little water, or find a
puddle in a rock. There was nothing that even a Dutchman could make
money out of. The natives were the ugliest, poorest, savagest,
beastliest natives that had ever been seen by Dutch eyes!</p>
<p>Still a Dutchman does not like to leave a job unfinished,
especially a job like this&mdash;a job so enormously big, as well
as so enormously ugly&mdash;that some good thing must surely in the
long run be found. Governor-General Van Diemen made up his mind
that two things, at least, must be done. Firstly, you must fill in
the gaps;&mdash;find what there is between the three separate
stretches of coast now known; and find out in doing so, if you can,
whether the tangle South of New Guinea is a bay or a strait. And,
secondly, you must find out what is Southward and Eastward of all
these lands. This most wretched of all countries is surely not the
golden continent of the South! Perhaps it is merely a barren
promontory of that golden continent. Perhaps the golden continent
lies beyond, Southward or Eastward. We must see, said
Governor-General Van Diemen. And he found a captain, named Abel
Tasman, as skilful a seaman as ever came to Batavia, and eager to
make voyages of discovery in the South. And in 1642 and 1644 Tasman
made two voyages which put on the map everything that was on the
map when Cook sailed in 1768.</p>
<p>The plan in 1642 was to find out what there was to the South and
to the East of the bits of South Land that had been discovered.
Tasman was to sail all round them. He had command of two ships, the
<i>Heemskirk</i> and the <i>Zeehaen</i>. First, he went to
Mauritius to get refreshments, and to make a good start for a
summer voyage far down South. From Mauritius he sailed as far South
as seemed safe, and then struck East, till he came to the land
which he called "Van Diemen's Land," and which we call "Tasmania."
He saw the two mountains on the West coast, which were afterwards
called, after his two ships, "Mount Heemskirk" and "Mount Zeehan."
Then he sailed round the South coast, and up the East coast as far
as "Van der Lyns' Island"&mdash;our Freycinet
Peninsula&mdash;whence he struck Eastward.</p>
<p><a name="tasman" id="tasman"></a>Now look at <a href=
"#il-05">Dalrymple's map</a> and see what Tasman has done. He has
discovered another separate scrap of coast line. Of what lay to the
North, between Van Diemen's Land and New Guinea, and of what lay to
the North-West between Van Diemen's Land and Nuytsland (or the head
of the Australian Bight) Tasman had not the least idea: and no one
had the least idea till Cook filled in the one gap in 1770, and
Flinders filled in the other gap in 1801. And the new scrap of
coast line Tasman had discovered was a scrap which no one wanted to
see again. Tasman landed at a place on the East Coast, which he
described so well that we know exactly where it was. Mr.
Moore-Robinson has taken a photograph of the place&mdash;now, as
then, there is a group of trees on a shingle beach&mdash;and has
put an X on the spot where the Dutch flag was placed. Tasman called
it a "barren valley." The seamen saw no natives, but they saw
notches on the trees five feet apart. They seemed to form "a kind
of steps to enable people to get up the trees" and people who climb
trees in five-foot steps must surely be "of very tall stature." A
barren valley inhabited by giants did not seem a very promising
discovery&mdash;though, no doubt, if the giants could be persuaded
to order Dutch trousers, much good business would be done.</p>
<p>Then Tasman sailed <i>Eastward</i>, till he came to land which
we should describe as the North-West corner of the South island of
New Zealand. He sailed along it northward till he came to the cape
which the next corner, Captain Cook, when about to sail away from
New Zealand along the course by which Tasman had come to it, called
Cape Farewell. Rounding it, he saw a large open bay, and thought it
a good place to get refreshments. Maori prows rowed out, and an
artist made a splendid sketch of them. The Dutch launched a boat in
a friendly way. Whereupon the people in one of the prows paddling
furiously&mdash;Maoris rowed in the style of a University
Eight&mdash;rammed the boat, hit the seamen with short thick clubs,
and killed four of them. Clearly this was no place for
refreshment!</p>
<p>Tasman called the bay "Murderers' Bay," and sailed Eastward into
a bay which seemed likely to end&mdash;so tides and currents made
him think&mdash;in "a passage to the open South sea." He tried hard
to get through; but wind and tide were against him. So on his map
he drew, not a passage, but a bay which he called "Zeehan's Bight."
I suspect, however, that he was by no means sure that it was not a
passage. His Pilot drew a chart which shows that he, at all events,
thought it probable that there was a passage. One hundred and
twenty-seven years passed before the next comer, Captain Cook,
sailed through the passage, and named it "Cook's Strait."</p>
<p>Then Tasman sailed along the coast Northward till he came to a
Cape which he named "Maria Van Diemen's Cape"&mdash;Maria was the
Governor-General's wife&mdash;and an island which he named the
"Three Kings Island," "because we came to anchor there on twelfth
night even."<sup>*</sup> He sent a boat to the island, to see if
water could be got. The seamen said there was plenty of good water
coming down from a steep mountain, but the surf made landing
impossible. They had seen persons of tall stature walking in
enormous strides&mdash;persons akin no doubt to the giant
tree-climbers of Van Diemen's Land. Again not a very promising
discovery.</p>
<p class="note">[* "Twelfth Night was the festival held on the
"twelfth night" after Christ's birth, to commemorate the visit of
the "three Kings" from the East.]</p>
<p>Tasman felt sure now that he had come to the northern <i>end</i>
of the new-found land, and that Dutchmen would be able to sail
round it, and attack their old enemy the Spaniard in South
America&mdash;a thing they greatly wanted to do. So he could now
sail northward for home. But what was this second scrap of
coastline he had discovered? We could have told him that it was a
scrap of the coastline of the two islands of New Zealand. But
Tasman had no chance of knowing, or even of guessing, this. All he
knew was that he had sailed along a scrap of coastline, running
roughly North and South, with a bay <i>or</i> a passage in the
middle. To him the most reasonable guess was that it was a bit of
the continent which, the maps told you, filled up the whole unknown
Southern Ocean. "It seems," he wrote, "to be a very fine country,
and we trust it is the main-land coast of the unknown South-land."
If a seaman had discovered this coastline thirty years before, he
would have guessed that it ran straight on to Tierra del Fuego. But
in 1616 a Dutch captain had sailed round Cape Horn&mdash;named
after the town from which the ship sailed&mdash;so Tasman knew that
the land he had discovered could not join Tierra del Fuego. But the
same Dutch captain had seen a land on the East side of Tierra del
Fuego, which, he believed, was a tip of the unknown continent, and
he had called it "Staten Land." Tasman thought it likely that the
land which <i>he</i> had just discovered went right round the South
of Tierra del Fuego, and joined Staten Land; so he called it also
"Staten Land" When, soon afterwards, it was found that the Staten
Land on the East of Tierra del Fuego was an island, a new name had
to be found for Tasman's discovery, and it was named "New Zealand."
But it still seemed likely enough that it was a bit of "the
mainland coast of the unknown-South"; and this still seemed likely
when Cook approached it in the <i>Endeavour</i> in 1769.</p>
<p>Tasman now sailed Northward for home, meaning to call at the
Solomons&mdash;if only he could find them&mdash;and then make for
the northern coast of New Guinea. He came to the Tonga Islands, and
had a very good time there. Then, sailing West, he got dangerously
entangled among the Fiji Islands. There was talk of still sailing
West, on a course that might have taken him to the New
Hebrides&mdash;Quiros's Austrialia of the Holy Spirit&mdash;and
have given him a chance to sail home by way of Torres Strait, as
Torres had sailed when he left the New Hebrides. But Tasman had no
knowledge of Torres' voyage through the strait; and he feared that,
if he took this Westward course, he might be "cast aside into a
bay, from which it might be difficult or impossible to beat out
again." So he went North again, to look for the Solomons. He went a
little too far North, and just missed them. Then he sailed along
the Northern coasts of New Ireland and New Britain&mdash;without
learning that they were islands&mdash;and so, along the fairly
well-known northern coast of New Guinea, home to Batavia&mdash;"God
be praised and thanked for this happy voyage. Amen."</p>
<p>The voyage of 1642 had added two more scraps of coastline to the
three scraps already known. The plan of the voyage of 1644 was to
fill in the gaps. Tasman sailed along the South coast of New
Guinea, and tried his best to find out whether the tangle to the
South was a strait or a shallow bight. His journal has been lost,
so we do not know exactly what he did, or exactly what he thought.
The map he made shows a shallow bight; but I suspect that, if you
had talked over the matter with him, he would have told you that he
had not dared to go far enough into "the trap" to make quite sure
what was at the end of it. Then Tasman sailed down the known coast
Southward, wondering whether the Gulf of Carpentaria was a gulf, or
a passage that would bring him to the Van Diemen's Land of the
South he had discovered two years ago. He found that the Gulf was a
gulf, and he sailed along its coast till he came to the already
known Arnhems Land and Van Diemen's Land of the North. The people
were the same sort of people you always found in the South
Land&mdash;"naked beach-roving wretches, destitute of rice, and not
possessed of any goods worth mentioning, excessively poor, and of a
malignant nature." Then he traced the coast from Van Diemen's Land
of the North to the Northern end of the old discoveries on the
West, finding there was a coast&mdash;or at least what looked more
like a coast than it looked like an ocean passage. And then he
sailed back to Batavia, and made the map which, 124 years later,
Cook had on board the <i>Endeavour</i>, as the map which gave the
very latest information about the ocean and the lands which he was
to explore; save that Cook had just been told that Torres had
sailed <i>Southward</i> of New Guinea.</p>
<p>Look again at <a href="#il-05">Dalrymple's map</a>, and see what
he has done, and what he has left to be done. He has put on the map
two and a half of the four sides of Australia&mdash;or "New
Holland" as the South Land now came to be called. Going
<i>Westward</i> from our Cape York, we find the coastline traced
with wonderful accuracy all the way to the head of the Bight: But
going <i>Eastward</i> from our Cape York, we find no coastline at
all till we get to the head of the Australian Bight, save the tiny
scrap which Tasman had discovered and had named Van Diemen's Land.
There are two big gaps between this scrap of coast and New Guinea
to the North and Nuytsland to the North-West, in which the
coastline was still entirely unknown. No one could possibly say how
far the unknown Eastern coast of New Holland bulged Eastward. It
might fill up the whole ocean Westward of the line marked by the
track of Tasman's ships. It might include Quiros's Austrialia of
the Holy Ghost (the New Hebrides), and run quite near to the
Solomons. Southward Tasman had proved that New Holland was not part
of the unknown Southern Continent you saw on the map. That
continent, no doubt, lay further South. It was likely enough that
the scrap of coastline called Staten Land or New Zealand was one of
its promontories; and that, if you sailed round its Northern point,
you would find the coastline stretching South-Eastward right across
the ocean till it rounded the South of Tierra del Fuego!</p>
<p>It seems strange that, after so much had been discovered between
1606 and 1644, nothing whatever was discovered between 1644 and
1769, though it was clear that ever so much remained to be
discovered. And no one could have been more eager to make further
discovery than was Anthony Van Diemen. "This vast and hitherto
unknown South Land," he wrote to the Dutch rulers, "has by the said
Tasman been sailed round in two voyages, and is thought to comprise
eight thousand miles of land. Now it can hardly be supposed that no
profits of any kind should be obtainable in so vast a country,
situated under various Zones between 43&frac12;&deg; (Tasmania) and 2&frac12;&deg; (New
Guinea). Thorough exploration of newly discovered lands is no work
for the first comer. God grant that some silver or gold mine be hit
upon." But the rulers in Holland were sick of the South Land. No
doubt there might be gold there, but it would need a lot of looking
for. The best gold mine, they thought, was trade with Asia. So
Dutch voyages of discovery almost came to an end. Dutch ships now
and then explored the partly known coasts of the West and
North-West. But everything they saw was still very, very bad. New
Holland was a hopeless place!</p>

<h3>HOW WILLIAM DAMPIER, THE FIRST ENGLISHMAN WHO CAME TO
AUSTRALIA, WROTE AN INTERESTING DESCRIPTION OF LAND AND
PEOPLE.</h3>
<p>Yet New Holland was so big that, sooner or later, explorers of
other nations were bound to think it worth while at least to have a
look at it! And in 1688 an <i>Englishman</i> for the first time
came to have a look at it. He came by a curious chance. William
Dampier was in some ways like James Cook, and in some ways like
Joseph Banks. Like James Cook, he was a farmer's boy, who became a
first-rate seaman. Like Joseph Banks, he was a boy of insatiable
curiosity, who was determined to travel, to see the world, and to
study everything in it&mdash;animal, vegetable, and mineral. His
travels brought him to Jamaica; and there he found that the best
people to travel with were pirates, whose business it was at this
time to raid and rob Spaniards wherever they could get at them.
Dampier had no special liking for piracy, though neither had he any
special objection to "the trade," as he calls it. He sailed with
pirates, not because they were pirates, but because as he says,
they were "travellers"&mdash;"more to indulge my curiosity, than to
get wealth." With them he crossed the Isthmus to the South Seas,
sailed Southward to the Island of Juan Fernandez, where he saw, one
after another, three men who had lived, one after another, alone on
the island like Robinson Crusoe&mdash;indeed he told the story in a
way that put Robinson Crusoe into Defoe's head. Then he sailed with
the pirates Northward to Mexico, crossed the ocean to the
Philippine Islands, and went on to New Holland "to see what the
country would afford us."</p>
<p>The pirates landed (January 1688) in a bay that was afterwards
called by the name of the pirate-ship, "Cygnet Bay," with islands
in it that were called the "Buccaneer Archipelago." This was no new
discovery, for it was part of the coast along which Tasman had
sailed, and which he had put down on his map. But Dampier wrote an
account of the land and of the people so interesting that one could
not forget it. Australia and Australians were the worst land and
the worst people that ever Dampier had seen. The land was "a dry
and dusty soil" that was "destitute of water except you make
wells," and that was entirely destitute of food. The people were
"the miserablest people in the world; and, setting aside their
human shape, they differ but little from brutes. They are tall,
strait-bodied and thin, with small long limbs. They have great
heads, round foreheads and great brows. Their eyelids are always
half-closed to keep the flies out of their eyes; they being so
troublesome here, that no fanning will keep them from coming to
one's face; and, without the assistance of both hands to keep them
off, they will creep into one's nostrils, and mouth, too, if the
lips are not shut very close. They have great bottle noses, pretty
full lips, and wide mouths. The two front teeth of the upper jaw
are wanting in all of them; neither have they any beards. They are
long-visaged, and of a very unpleasing aspect, having not one
graceful feature in their faces. Their hair is black, short and
curled, like that of the negroes; and not long and lank like the
common Indian. The colour of their skins, both of their faces and
the rest of their body, is coal-black, like that of the negroes of
Guinea. Their costume consists of a piece of the rind of a tree or
a handful of grass or bough." We shall find that when Cook and
Banks saw blackfellows on the Eastern side of New Holland they
looked at them very carefully to see if they were like the
blackfellows Dampier had seen in the West.</p>
<p>Dampier's stories were found so interesting by the men of
science of the Royal Society that they persuaded the Government to
give him command of a ship to explore New Holland. For, in spite of
his unlucky experience, he had sense enough to feel sure that there
must be in New Holland a great deal that was well worth seeing. In
"this large and hitherto almost unknown tract of land, situated so
very advantageously in the richest of climates in the world," he
"could not but hope to meet with some fruitful lands, continents,
or islands, productive of rich fruits, drugs or spices (perhaps
minerals also) that are in other parts of the torrid zones." He
hoped to make a thorough exploration, not only of New Holland, but
also of the South Seas; and, if he had been fairly treated by the
Government, he would perhaps have left Cook little to do.</p>
<p>But he was treated most unfairly. He was given a ship&mdash;the
<i>Roebuck</i>&mdash;which foundered on the way home "through
perfect age," after an attempt to mend the leak had shown that "the
plank was so rotten that it broke away like dirt." The seamen were
as bad as the ship&mdash;lazy, dirty, drunken, smellful,
rebellious, murderous and "heartless enough to the voyage at best."
Dampier had meant to sail, as Cook afterwards sailed, round Cape
Horn, in order first to explore the "Eastern or less well-known
side of the Southern Lands." But he had to sail at a time of the
year when it would have been too cold to round Cape Horn. So he
must come by the old Dutch route round the Cape, which brought him
to Sharks Bay on the <i>Western</i> coast already explored by
Tasman.</p>
<p>But he still hoped to sail all round New Holland. One way of
doing so was to sail South to Cape Leeuwin, then East to the head
of the Bight, and then on through one unknown gap to Van Diemen's
Land, and through the other unknown gap to New Guinea. Had he gone
this way, he might have been the first to sail through Bass's
Strait, the first to coast Eastern Australia, and the second to
sail through Torres Strait. But it was now mid-winter (July 1699).
Dampier hated cold, and he believed that the richest lands were
"directly under the sun." So he decided to go round New Holland the
other way; "to coast to the Northward, and so to the East, and so
thought to come round by the South in my return back, which should
be in the summer time there."</p>
<p>Sailing Northward, then, he made more careful exploration of the
coast drawn in Tasman's map, wondering whether it was really as
solid as Tasman had drawn it, or whether, behind the islands, there
was not some big ocean passage that might bring you through to the
East or to the South. On Rosemary Island he found the first good
thing that had ever been found in Australia&mdash;beautiful
wild-flowers. He landed in a bay, now called. "Roebuck Bay," not
far from his old landing place. But both land and people were as
bad as before, and even worse. Sailing round the North of New
Guinea, he discovered the passage&mdash;"Dampier's
Passage"&mdash;which separates from New Guinea the island which he
named "New Britain." At last he had come to a beautiful and rich
island "directly under the sun"&mdash;an island which, he thought,
"may very probably afford as many rich commodities as any in the
world." Why should not New Britain become the British Spice
Island?</p>
<p>Now was the chance to sail Southward and explore the unknown
East and South! But it was impossible. "The many difficulties I at
the same time met with, the want of conveniences to clean my ship,
the fewness of my men, their desire to hasten home, and the danger
of continuing in these circumstances in seas where the shoals and
coasts were utterly unknown, or must be searched out with much
caution and length of time, hindered me from prosecuting any
further my intended search." In truth, had Dampier sailed South he
would never have come home. He sailed back the way he came, till
the ancient and rotten little ship foundered at the Isle of
Ascension. The crew were rescued by British men-of-war, and Dampier
brought home his precious note-book.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-1-5" id="ch-1-5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>HOW THE BRITISH AND THE FRENCH BEGAN TO EXPLORE THE SOUTH
SEA.</h3>
<p>Dampier came home in 1701; and he described what he had seen in
a book so interesting that everybody read it who read anything at
all. Yet seventy years passed before another Englishman landed in
Australia. Nor need we be surprised. Dampier had described
Australia in a way that made everyone feel that Australia was the
very best place in the world to live as far away from as you could.
New Britain, no doubt, seemed a promising place. But New Britain
was ever so far away, and you would have to put ever so much money
into it, before you could hope to get a penny out of it. A man of
business would do far better by trading in India and America. In
fact the British and French, the only nations likely at this time
to think of big adventures in the South, were busy enough in India
and America, not only in trade, but also in fighting one another.
They had no time, no energy, no money for anything else.</p>
<p>Yet in the early 18th Century, there were people both in Britain
and in France who thought a good deal about the <i>Unknown
South</i>, and wondered what it might contain. What strange things
might be there! When Dean Swift wrote <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>, he
made Gulliver come to land, in two of the four voyages, in islands
to the South of Australia. The Liliputians lived in an island "to
the North West of Van Diemen's Land," and the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos
in an island South of Cape Leeuwin; they were quite as likely to
live there as anywhere else. And though, no doubt, it was unlikely
that things quite so strange as things seen by Gulliver really
existed in the Unknown South, it would be very surprising if things
did not exist very unlike the things you saw in
Europe:&mdash;things that would be very interesting to men of
science, very profitable to men of business, and very well worth
the attention of statesmen who wished to found colonies, and to
increase the Sea Power of their nation. It was not to be believed
that a huge country like Australia could everywhere be as bad as at
the places where Dampier had landed. New Britain at all events, was
a beautiful and fertile island; and so was Quiros's Island,
Austrialia of the Holy Ghost, which could not be far away; and so
were the Solomon Islands, if only you could find them. And away to
the South <i>must</i> be a huge unknown continent&mdash;as huge as
Asia or America, and as rich as Peru&mdash;to balance the
continents of the North.</p>
<p>Both French and British writers wrote books to urge exploration
and settlement in the South Seas. And when in 1763 the great war
was ended by the treaty which gave Britain mastery in Canada and in
India, both French and British statesmen began to think the time
had come to do something down South. One of the most famous of the
French soldiers who had fought under Montcalm a valiant fight in
Canada was M. de Bougainville. And in 1763, the very year when
France had to give up hope of a French Empire in America,
Bougainville with brave heart was planning a French Empire in
Australasia. "The French nation," he wrote, "is capable of
conquering the greatest difficulties, and nothing is impossible to
her efforts, as often as she will think herself equal at least to
any nation in the World!" Was the next war then, thought British
statesmen, to be a war for the Pacific? If so we must act at once.
It is true that, for the present, we don't want the Pacific. But,
if the French mean to peg out that ocean, we must peg it out
first.</p>
<p>So in 1765 the British Government sent a ship, and in 1766 they
sent two ships, to explore the Pacific. They sailed through the
Straits of Magellan, and then struck a North-West course which
brought them round the North coast of New Guinea; and they
discovered nothing of much importance, save the beautiful and
delightful island which its discoverer, Captain Wallis, called
"King George the Thirds Island"&mdash;it is now called
"Tahiti"&mdash;an island which plays a great part in the story of
exploration.</p>
<p>The British had got away first in the race, but in three months
Bougainville was after the two ships of 1766. He did not mention
his plan to the British, and they knew nothing about the voyage
till it was over. He came to Tahiti&mdash;which Wallis had
discovered and annexed for Britain&mdash;and annexed it for France.
Then he sailed on a more Southerly course than the British ships
had taken. He came to the New Hebrides&mdash;Quiros's Austrialia of
the Holy Ghost&mdash;and annexed them also! Then boldly he sailed
Westward. Had he sailed far enough, he would have come to the
unknown Eastern coast of Australia near Cooktown; and, very likely,
he would have run on to a coral reef, as Cook did two years later.
But, after a week's sail, he found himself in midst of frightful
dangers. He saw sandbanks and shoals and breakers that seemed to
stretch without end. He was, in fact, about 80 miles from the outer
edge of the Barrier Reef. Bougainville had never heard of the
Barrier Reef; but he saw that to try to go further Westward would
be madness.</p>
<p>So he turned Northward, and came to the Southern coast of New
Guinea, near the point to which Torres had come in his voyage 160
years before. Torres, we remember, unable to get round the East
point of New Guinea, had, greatly daring, steered Westward, and had
found his Strait. But Bougainville had read no account of Torres'
voyage; and, though he thought it probable that there was a strait,
he dared not face the risk of running into a trap. So, he faced the
almost equal risk of fighting his way, in spite of winds and tides,
round the Eastern point of New Guinea. For a dreadful fortnight he
was in the greatest danger, caught in a huge gulf that bristled
with shoals and reefs and islets, while a south-eastern swell was
heaving him towards the land. But at length he rounded the
point&mdash;"Cape Deliverance," he called it. Then he picked his
way round the North coast of New Guinea, called at Batavia, and
came home by the usual Cape route, catching the slower of the two
British ships as he came near Europe in March 1769.</p>
<p>About a year before this time, British statesmen had begun to
think of sending another ship to explore the South Pacific. Though
they did not know that Bougainville had sailed on the heels of the
British ships, they knew very well that he had big plans in mind,
and that something must be done to checkmate them. Moreover a
famous geographer, named Alexander Dalrymple, was seeking to
persuade them that, if they would send a ship further South than
any ships had yet sailed, the captain of that ship would find a
huge and rich continent, which he could annex before Frenchmen knew
anything about it.</p>
<p>Alexander Dalrymple had been a servant of the East India
Company, and had sailed a great deal in the Eastern seas, and knew
them very well. He had also studied with delight the stories of
Columbus and Magellan, and the other famous explorers; and he
longed himself to be the hero in some great voyage of discovery in
the Unknown South. He was as certain as Quiros had been certain
that the Unknown South "must be nearly all land." The coastline of
a huge continent ran, he was sure, just to the West of the course
that had been taken by ships as they sailed from the Straits of
Magellan, or from Cape Horn, for the North of New Guinea; a
coast-line which ran straight on to New Zealand, and then fell away
Southward. How large this continent must be&mdash;larger than the
whole of Asia from Turkey to the extremity of China! And how rich!
Peru was probably its colony! And how populous! In the American
colonies there were only two million people. In the Southern
Continent there were probably fifty millions. "The scraps from this
table would be sufficient to maintain the power, dominion and
sovereignty of Britain, by employing all its manufacturers and
ships."</p>
<p>And, as to the way back, Dalrymple knew a very interesting fact,
known to no one else, that gave chance of a very interesting
voyage. He had <i>got</i> possession of the long-forgotten little
Spanish book of 1640, which had told that Torres had sailed
<i>South</i> of New Guinea! and he knew that therefore there must
be a strait there. In 1767 Dalrymple printed a tiny book&mdash;it
was not published till 1769&mdash;which explained how easy it would
be to discover the great rich, populous continent of the South; and
in it was a map which for the first time showed the track of Torres
running through Torres Strait. <a href="#il-05">Here</a>, you will
see a part of Dalrymple's map.</p>
<p>And in February 1768 there seemed a good chance that the British
Government would send a ship to explore the South Pacific, and that
Dalrymple would be her captain. In that month the men of science of
the Royal Society asked King George III., the "Patron" of the
Society, to send a ship to the South Pacific with astronomers on
board to observe the transit of Venus; and they recommended
Dalrymple as "a proper person to be sent to the South Seas, having
a particular turn for discovery, and being a navigator, as well as
skilled in observation." King George and his advisers willingly
agreed to send the ship, and to give the money that was needed.
But, as to Dalrymple, there was a hitch. The commander of a King's
ship must be an officer of the King's Navy; and Dalrymple, though a
good observer and a good navigator, was not an officer of the
King's Navy. And the end of the matter was that Alexander
Dalrymple, who knew tropical seas so well, and who had read
everything written about the Southern Continent, had to stay at
home; and the command of the ship was given to James Cook, who had
never crossed the equator, and who perhaps did not even know that
the Southern Continent existed! Alexander Dalrymple never forgave
James Cook. But he gave his booklet to a young aristocrat, Mr.
Joseph Banks, who sailed with Cook in the <i>Endeavour</i>, and was
able to tell him what Dalrymple knew about the South Pacific and
about Torres Strait.</p>
<p>So now we have learnt what, when the <i>Endeavour</i> sailed,
men knew about the South Seas, and what they guessed and expected
to find. We shall see next why the men of science of the Royal
Society were so anxious that a ship should be sent to observe the
transit of Venus, and why in the end it was James Cook who was
asked to command the ship of discovery.</p>

<p>PART II. THE VOYAGE OF THE <i>ENDEAVOUR</i>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-2-1" id="ch-2-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>HOW CAPTAIN JAMES COOK, MR. JOSEPH BANKS, AND NINETY-TWO
OTHERS, SAILED IN THE ENDEAVOUR.</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 24th of November, 1639, the Reverend
Jeremiah Horrocks, a young man of 22 years of age, Curate of the
little village of Hoole, in Lancashire, woke with an excited mind.
It was Sunday, and the Reverend Jeremiah must conduct services in
the Church which nothing in the world would make him neglect. But
he was thinking when he woke, not of the Church and its services,
but of a darkened room in his cottage, in which a tiny half-crown
telescope gave the wintry sun a chance to throw its light upon a
screen. It was his belief that, in the course of the day, a small
black speck would crawl across the sun-lit circle. That small black
speck would be the shadow of the planet Venus passing between Earth
and Sun. If one could watch its crawl, one might learn something no
one at present knew about Sun and Planets, and the strange
wonderful whirligig universe of which astronomers were beginning to
get some little understanding.</p>
<p>Nearly a hundred years had passed since the Polish astronomer
Copernicus had proved&mdash;to those who could understand
him&mdash;that Sun and Planets do not go round the Earth, but that
Earth and Planets go round the Sun. But even in 1639 there were few
people who believed this strange new opinion&mdash;so unlike what
you saw every day with your own eyes. But the astronomers knew that
the strange opinion was the right opinion; and they knew also that,
if they pushed on their studies, they would in time be able to
prove to everybody that it was the right opinion. What they wanted
most of all was an instrument that would enable them to study the
heavens with greater exactness than you can study them with an
un-helped eye. And in 1609&mdash;thirty years before that Sunday
morning in 1639&mdash;the Italian astronomer Galileo had put
glasses together in a way that made them what was called a
telescope.<sup>*</sup> You were now able to see plainly things that
hitherto you had only been able to see obscurely, or had not been
able to see at all. You could see spots on the sun, and mountains
on the moon. You could see that Venus sometimes appears in crescent
form like the moon, which proves that Venus goes round the sun, and
gets light from her. You could see that Jupiter has satellites, and
that Saturn has a ring. You could see eclipses of the sun, and
eclipses of the moon. And you had good hope to see&mdash;if only
you could find the right time to look&mdash;Mercury and Venus pass
between the Earth and the Sun. And everything you saw made more
certain and more plain that the strange opinion was the right
opinion, and that now, for the first time there was chance, not
merely to "consider" but also in some measure to understand what
the Psalmist called "the Heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon
and the Stars which Thou hast ordained."</p>
<p class="note">[* The discovery that this was possible had been
made by chance by a Dutchman in 1608.]</p>
<p>No wonder that Jeremiah Horrocks, a poor Cambridge student with
wonderful gift in the study of mathematics, had become an
astronomer. In what other branch of learning was there such a
chance to make really <i>big</i> discoveries? He had no money
wherewith to buy a good telescope&mdash;his salary as parson was
&pound;40 a year. But he had bought a telescope for half-a-crown; he had
watched with it an eclipse of the sun; and he hoped to watch with
it an event which no one yet had watched. For he had a very
wonderful power to think things out, and to work out sums which
would show what must happen from time to time as planets run their
rounds. And he had worked out a sum that made him believe that, on
the 24th of November, Venus would pass between the Earth and the
Sun; and that, if he darkened his room and fixed his half-crown
telescope before a screen, he&mdash;Jeremiah Horrocks&mdash;would
see, what no astronomer had ever yet seen, the shadow of Venus
crawling along a sun-lit circle.</p>
<p>It was a fine morning, and the November sun shone its best into
the telescope, and made a bright circle on the screen; and the
Reverend Jeremiah would have given all that possibly could be given
of his &pound;40 salary to buy a right to watch that bright circle all
day long. But he was God's servant; and it is not right that God's
servant should neglect God's service, even to watch the shadow of
Venus. So, as usual, he was in good time for Church service: and,
as usual, he preached and prayed in a very earnest way; though
perhaps a Lancashire man who listened to him said to his wife as
they walked home that there seemed to be "summut on th' parson's
mind." But at a quarter past three he was free to hurry
back&mdash;<i>in the sunshine</i>!&mdash;to the darkened room; and
there! actually crawling over the sun-lit circle was a black speck!
He watched it crawl till the sun set at ten minutes to four. And he
rejoiced with a great joy. For he had proved that the two
planets&mdash;the Earth and Venus&mdash;whirled round the Sun
exactly in the way in which he had thought they whirled. And he
knew more about Venus than the most famous astronomer knew.</p>
<p>Jeremiah Horrocks died a year afterwards, at the age of
twenty-three. He left writings which prove that he was a very great
astronomer. And he left also the memory that it was an Englishman
who had first observed the transit of Venus; that is, the passing
of Venus between Earth and Sun. English astronomers were proud of
the fact; and they made up their minds that Englishmen should
always be on the outlook for the transit of Venus, and should make
it their pride to carry on the study which an Englishman had begun.
You had, it was true, sometimes to wait a long time&mdash;a hundred
years or so must not worry you&mdash;for Venus to get exactly into
the place in which you wanted her. But at all events she was
regular in her habits, and, if you worked out your sums rightly,
you could foretell even the day when the transit would take
place&mdash;though that day might not come for a hundred years, and
you yourself had not the ghost of a chance to see what you
foresaw.</p>
<p>Thus in 1716 a famous astronomer, Mr. Halley, foresaw that a
transit would take place in 1761, and another in 1769; and as,
being 60 years of age, he could not hope himself to see these
transits, he implored the English astronomers who should be alive
at those dates not to neglect their duty as astronomers and as
Englishmen. So in 1760 British astronomers began to make their
plans. All famous men of Science were members of the Royal Society;
and the Royal Society asked the British Government to send
astronomers in 1761 to St. Helena and Sumatra, which seemed to be
the two best places from which to observe an event which, they
explained, had been "predicted in the last century by an
Englishman, and never observed but once since the world began, and
that by another Englishman." The Government consented, and the
astronomers sailed. But the observations in St. Helena were spoilt
by very cloudy weather; and the ship that sailed for Sumatra was
attacked by the French, and never got there.</p>
<p>These failures made the Royal Society more anxious that the
transit of 1769 should be observed with the greatest care. In
February 1768 they wrote a letter to George III., the "Patron" of
their Society. They praised his "remarkable love of science," and
they explained how necessary it was to observe this transit, for
"the like appearance will not happen for more than a hundred
years."<sup>*</sup> Other nations&mdash;French, Danes, Swedes,
Russians&mdash;were making plans of observation. Was it not right
that the British nation should make quite sure that the British
observations were the best: "the British nation, justly celebrated
in the learned world for their knowledge of astronomy, in which
they are inferior to no nation in the world, ancient or modern!"
Astronomers should this time be sent to three places:&mdash;to
Spitzbergen or the North Cape; to Hudson's Bay; and to <i>some
place in the South Pacific</i>. The expense would be four thousand
pounds.</p>
<p class="note">[* The next transits took place in 1874 and
1882.]</p>
<p>The four thousand pounds were willingly given, not only because
George III. was interested in science, but also because, as we have
seen, British statesmen were interested in the South Pacific, and
were just at that time thinking of sending another ship to make
more thorough exploration. It would be a first-rate plan, they
thought, to send a ship to Tahiti&mdash;Captain Wallis returned in
May 1768 with news that he had discovered that island&mdash;with
instructions to observe the transit of Venus, and then to sail
Southward in search of the Southern Continent, take possession of
it, if they could find it, and bring home news of its greatness and
fertility.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[*</p>
<p>1. It was thought till recently that the "instructions" given to
Cook were lost. But, it was found that the document still exists;
and it is now in the Mitchell Library, Sydney.]</p>
<p>The next thing was to find a Captain&mdash;the sort of Captain
that is not easy to find; for he must be (1) a first-rate seaman,
(2) a first-rate astronomer, and (3)&mdash;seeing that he was to
command a King's ship&mdash;a first-rate officer of the King's
Navy. Now a first-rate seaman is not often a first-rate astronomer:
and a first-rate astronomer is not often a first-rate seaman: and,
if by good chance you find a man, like Alexander Dalrymple, who is
both a first-rate astronomer and a first-rate navigator and
map-maker, the Lords of the Admiralty point out that he is not an
officer of the King's Navy, and will not look at him. But, by
wonderful luck, both the Lords of the Admiralty and the Council of
the Royal Society knew a man who had all the three things that were
needed. James Cook was a first-rate seaman, a first-rate
astronomer, and a first-rate officer in the King's Navy. The Lords
of the Admiralty made him Captain of the ship, with the rank in the
navy of First-Lieutenant, and a wage of five shillings a day. A
Council of the Royal Society was held, and "Mr. Cook was called
in." The Councillors thought that he was "a proper person to be one
of the observers" of the transit, and they wished to see him, and
to talk over the matter. Mr. Cook came into the room. The
Councillors were very glad to make his acquaintance. And so are we.
But, before we look at him, we will learn what we can about his
early life.</p>
<p>James Cook's grandfather was a pious Scotchman, an elder of the
Kirk. James Cook's father&mdash;whose name also was
James&mdash;went to live in Yorkshire. "God send you Grace," said
his mother as she said good-bye; and God answered the prayer by
sending him a wife of that name. In a tiny two-roomed cottage in
the tiny village of Marton, James was born in October 1728; and the
parson who baptised him wrote down in his book, "James, the son of
a day labourer." Later, James's father became a builder. He cut his
and his wife's initials&mdash;J.G.C.&mdash;over the doorway of a
house, and there they may be seen to-day.</p>
<p>Son James went to school, learned reading, writing and
arithmetic, and got a wonderful grip of these subjects, and indeed
of everything he tackled. All the village knew that he had a mind
and a will of his own. In later days old school-fellows would tell
stories to show how, in looking for birds' nests, as afterwards in
looking for islands and continents, he had a way of forming his own
plans, and of sticking to them. Then he helped his father in farm
work, was perhaps a stable-boy for a short time, served customers
in a grocer-and-draper's shop for a year and a half, and in 1746,
at the age of eighteen, became "prentice" in a big coal-shipping
business at Whitby, a famous old town on the Yorkshire coast. For
nine years he made voyages in coal-ships, getting loving knowledge
of the sort of ship which he proved to be the best in the world,
not only for carrying coal, but also for carrying explorers.
Quickly and thoroughly he learnt the whole duty of seamen. He got
on very well with his employer, Mr. Walker, who became his friend
for life: and in 1755, at the age of twenty-seven, he was offered
the position of Captain of a ship. But he refused it. War was
breaking out with France&mdash;the war that made Canada and India
parts of the Empire. Skilful seamen were badly wanted in the Royal
Navy, and Cook offered to serve, "having a mind to try his fortune
that way."</p>
<p>From 1755 to 1758 Cook served in ships which cruised the
Channel, and fought what fights they could get. Unhappily he told
no stories of his fights, nor did anyone else. We have to make the
most we can of this sort of record in the log of his ship: "we
killed her 50 men and wounded her 30; she killed us 10 men and
wounded us 80." The log gives the scores of the fight as if it had
been a football match&mdash;deaths and wounds in place of goals and
tries&mdash;but tells you nothing about the players. In 1758 Cook
sailed to Canada in the fleet commanded by "wry-necked Dick"
Boscawen, "Old Dreadnought," and took modest part in famous deeds
at Louisburg and Quebec. But there are no stories of the part Cook
played in these famous deeds. All we know is that, while Wolfe was
planning the capture of Quebec, Cook was doing splendid work in
sounding the St. Lawrence, and in drawing maps which showed its
difficulties and dangers, and the chances of successful attack on
the fortress above.</p>
<p>Cook's maps of the St. Lawrence were so good that he was asked
to draw maps of Labrador and Newfoundland; and these were so well
drawn that they are useful even now. How he got this wonderful
skill to draw maps of unknown coasts better than such maps had ever
been drawn before is a great puzzle. For it was skill of the sort
which generally only comes to a man who has made long and deep
study of mathematics under first-rate teachers. And Cook, on ship
off Canadian coasts or in Canadian harbours, had few books and no
teachers; indeed, he had never had teachers, "save his own
industry," since at very early age he had left school to help his
father in farm-work. In the winter evenings at Whitby, when he was
back from one voyage and waiting for the next, a kindly
house-keeper "allowed him a table and a candle that he might read
and write by himself, while the other apprentices were engaged in
idle talk"; and, no doubt, he had read and had written with
terrible industry. He had a head for mathematics, as the idle
apprentices had, perhaps, heads for cricket; and he was as keen on
making calculations as they were keen on making runs. It is good
that we take our pleasures in different ways, and that one boy's
poison is another boy's meat. James Cook did sums because he liked
doing sums, and the end was that a farm-labourer's son became the
best map-maker in the King's Navy.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a name="il-03" id="il-03"></a><img alt=""

<br>
Captain Cook</p>
<p>Moreover, James Cook, like Jeremiah Horrocks, took keen interest
in astronomy. If you can make a good clear map of the earth, why
not also make a good clear map of the heavens? In 1766&mdash;like
Jeremiah Horrocks in 1639&mdash;he observed an eclipse of the sun,
and his observations were studied by members of the Royal Society,
who said that he was "a good mathematician, and was expert in his
business." Thus when the Lords of the Admiralty, knowing all about
Cook's skill in seamanship and map-making, made him Captain of the
ship that was to carry astronomers to Tahiti, the members of the
Royal Society were very well pleased; for they knew that the
Captain himself would be a first-rate astronomer, as well able to
observe Venus, and to bring back facts that could be used to make a
new map of the heavens, as he was able to observe strange coasts,
and to bring back facts that could be used to make a new map of the
South Pacific. As he came into the room they looked at him with
keen interest, and so do we.</p>
<p>He was now a man of thirty-nine, The best description of his
appearance was written about ten years afterwards, by an officer
who had sailed with him in his last voyage: "His person was above
six feet high, and, though a good-looking man, he was plain both in
dress and appearance. His head was small; his hair, which was dark
brown, he wore tied behind. His face was full of expression, his
nose exceedingly well shaped, his eyes, which were small and of a
brown cast, were quick and piercing, his eyebrows prominent, which
gave his countenance an air of austerity." Mr. Cook, thought the
Councillors, looks a man who'll make a first-rate job of this
voyage; and they made a good guess of his character. "Nature,"
wrote the officer ten years afterwards, "had endowed him with a
mind vigorous and comprehensive, with a clear judgment, strong
masculine sense, and the most determined resolution; with a genius
peculiarly turned for enterprise, he pursued his object with
unshaken perseverance; vigilant and active in an eminent degree;
cool and intrepid among dangers; patient and firm among
difficulties and distress; fertile in expedients; great and
original in all his designs, active and resolute in carrying them
into execution. He was a modest man, and rather bashful; of an
agreeable lively conversation, sensible and intelligent. In his
temper he was somewhat hasty, but of a disposition the most
friendly, benevolent and humane; "&mdash;his temper was good but
short.</p>
<p>The Councillors of the Royal Society could not see all this at
one glance. But they saw enough to make them sure that Cook was the
man for them; and they asked him straightway to be one of the
observers of the transit. They promised him 120 guineas&mdash;in
addition, of course, to the five shillings a day he got as captain
of the ship. Cook was well pleased, and thought himself a lucky
man. The Councillors also appointed another observer, Mr. Green, a
first-rate astronomer, the son of a Yorkshire farmer, who was to
get 200 guineas, and, if the voyage lasted longer than two years,
100 guineas a year. And Mr. Cook and Mr. Green were further to have
&pound;120 a year for "victualling" themselves, that is for buying, when
they had a chance, better food and better drink than the food and
drink served out to the seamen.</p>
<p>There was one member of the Royal Society whose interest in the
voyage was far greater than the interest of the other members for
he had determined himself to go. Joseph Banks was a rich
Lincolnshire squire, twenty-five years of age. Like Dampier, a
hundred years before, he had been born with an insatiable curiosity
and a determination to see the world and everything in it; and he
had a far better chance than poor Dampier to travel in good
company. He was the sort of boy whom it is a joy to know. An old
schoolmate long afterwards described him as "a remarkably
fine-looking, strong and active boy, whom no fatigue could subdue,
and no peril daunt. His whole time out of school was given up to
hunting after plants and insects. Joe cared mighty little for his
books, and could not understand anyone taking to Greek or Latin."
Joe himself used to tell how, when a boy, strolling down a lane, he
exclaimed&mdash;"How beautiful! Would it not be far more reasonable
to make me learn of these plants than the Latin and Greek I am
confined to?" Perhaps he was all the fonder of hunting plants and
insects because he was not "made" to learn of them, but hunted them
while "strolling down a lane." I think that he had the same sort of
tastes as Martin, "the madman," in <i>Tom Brown's Schooldays</i>,
who kept hedgehogs and rats in his cupboard, and carried tame
snakes in his pocket; though Joe Banks, no doubt, was a good bit
less mad than Martin, and a good bit cleaner in his manners and
customs. A boy must be allowed to have his own notion of what is a
real good time. When Jim Cook meant to have a real good time, he
worked out the hardest sums he could find. When Joe Banks meant to
have a real good time, he hunted insects.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a name="il-04" id="il-04"></a><img alt=""
src="1204111h-images/il-04.jpg"><br>
<br>
Mr. Joseph Banks</p>
<p>At Oxford University he went on with the same studies, getting
help now from a good teacher, and strolling down Oxford lanes with
great delight. Then he strolled over England, always, as in
schoolboy days, hunting plants and insects, and indeed everything
that grows, or flies, or swims, or crawls in this very fascinating
world. Then he was off to Newfoundland on the same hunt, at the
very time (1766) when Cook was making maps of its coasts. And then
he heard with excitement that a ship of discovery was to sail for
the South Sea. That's the ship for me, said Joe.</p>
<p>His friends told him he was an ass. Why not go the usual "grand
tour," that every young swell goes round the gay cities of Europe,
have a jolly good time in them, and return to England in tip-top
form to have a jolly good time there for the rest of your life?
"That's not the 'grand tour' for me," said Joe. "Every blockhead
does that! My grand tour shall be round the world." And he was
never sorry that he had made this choice. More than half a century
later, he wrote a letter to a young man of science, whose friends
were trying to dissuade him from making a voyage to Java on the
ground that the climate was unhealthy. They want to force you, he
wrote, to spend your life in eating and drinking&mdash;"a serene,
quiet, sober way of slumbering away life. <i>I</i> was about 23
when I began my peregrinations. You may be assured that if I had
listened to a multitude of voices that were raised to dissuade me
from my enterprise, I should have now been a quiet country
gentleman, quite ignorant of a number of matters I am now
acquainted with, and probably having attained to no higher rank in
life than that of country Justice of the Peace." So wrote Sir
Joseph Banks, the friend of the King, the adviser of statesmen, the
President of the Royal Society and the Father of New South Wales!
To none of these things would Joe have attained had he not
possessed the strength of body and mind and soul which made him
prefer three years of salt junk and weevilly biscuits, perils of
disease and wreck, the company of seamen who cared no more for
plants and insects than they cared for Greek and Latin, to a jolly
good time in Europe with the motto "the best of everything not good
enough for me!"</p>
<p>It is pleasant to think of him as he started on this "grand
tour" of the world, radiant in youth, health and strength, brimming
over with joy of life, eager to see, to know and to achieve. He was
rich enough to do things in a grand style. He took with him a
famous botanist named Dr. Solander (pupil of the still more famous
botanist Linnaeus), four artists and four servants&mdash;two of
whom were negroes. "No people," wrote Mr. Ellis, Fellow of the
Royal Society, "ever went to sea better fitted out for the purpose
of Natural History or more elegantly. They have a fine Library of
Natural History, all sorts of machines for catching and preserving
insects; all kinds of nets, trawls, drags and hooks for coral
fishing; they have even a curious contrivance of a telescope, by
which, put into the water, you can see the bottom at a great depth
when it is clear. They have many cases of bottles with ground glass
stoppers of several sizes to preserve animals in spirits. They have
several sorts of salts to surround the seeds. In short Solander
assured me this expedition would cost Mr Banks &pound;10,000"&mdash;that
is to say, more than twice as much as the cost of the ship itself,
even after the cost had been nearly doubled by repairs and
additions.</p>
<p>For the ship had been chosen and bought. A deal of thought had
been given to the choice. The first plan was to send, as in
previous voyages, a war-ship. But it was now understood that the
sort of ship that is good for war is not the sort of ship that is
good for discovery. There are certain things which a ship of
discovery must have. She must be a good sea-boat, able to face all
sorts of weather with a calm mind. She must be a roomy ship, with
plenty of space down below for men to make themselves comfortable.
She must have a small draft in order to sail in shallow waters. She
must be of a shape that will make it possible, in case she runs
aground, to get her off again without much damage: and, in case she
is much damaged, to lay her down on shore for repairs. And she must
have a body big enough to carry enormous quantities of provisions.
Now you would never find all these things in a war-ship. But you
found all of them in a sort of ship called a cat-built bark, that
was built in Norway&mdash;cat comes from the Norwegian word for
ship&mdash;and in Yorkshire ports like Whitby. So a cat-built bark
was chosen.</p>
<p>Her name was the <i>Earl of Pembroke</i>; but she was renamed
the <i>Endeavour Bark</i>. She had been built at Whitby in 1764,
and had carried coal for four years. Her price was &pound;2800: and
&pound;2294, nearly as much as the price of the ship, was spent in
repairing her, sheathing her, and generally fitting her for the
voyage. Sheathing was very necessary for a voyage of discovery, as
Cook was to prove off the Endeavour River. It was there to stand
hard knocks, and to prevent "the worm" from boring holes in the
ship's sides.<sup>*</sup> And big changes must be made to turn a
coal-ship into a ship of discovery with comfortable room for 94
men, including Mr. Joseph Banks and his friends&mdash;who must, of
course, have all the best cabins.</p>
<p class="note">[*</p>
<p>1. In the previous voyages of 1765 and 1766, copper sheathing
had been used for the first time. But Cook did not use it, because
it destroyed the iron work, especially about the rudder. He
preferred the old-fashioned wooden sheathing. The trouble was that
worms bored holes in the sheathing itself. To-day turpentine wood
is used which worms don't like.]</p>
<p>The writer of the earliest <i>Life</i> of Cook says that Cook
chose the <i>Endeavour</i>. Dalrymple says <i>he</i> chose her.
Exactly what happened, we don't know. But, in any case, Cook
approved the choice in the strongest possible way. In a Whitby
coal-ship he was as much at home as a Scotchman whose foot is on
his native heath. And, in his opinion, the success of the voyage
was as much due to the <i>Endeavour</i>, as it was due to Captain
Cook. "It was the good qualities of the <i>Endeavour</i>," he said,
"which enabled me to remain so much longer in the South Sea than
anyone had been able to do before."</p>
<p>How lucky it would have been if one of Mr. Banks's artists had
sat down and drawn a picture of the <i>Endeavour</i>, ready to sail
on the voyage that was to bring her to Botany Bay. Not one of them
did so.<sup>*</sup> But, happily, one of them drew a picture of the
ship as she lay ashore in the Endeavour River to be repaired. And,
if you look at <a href="#il-08">this picture</a>, you'll get some
rough idea of her appearance. And, happily again, we have in Sydney
two plans of her hull that enable a seaman who understands
ship-building to draw a more exact picture, showing many things
which Mr. Banks's artist, drawing the ship at a distance when she
was leaning on her side, could not show.</p>
<p class="note">[*</p>
<p>2. In the <i>Historical Records of New South Wales</i> (Vol. 1,
Part I., opposite page 308) is a picture described as "Hull of
Lieut. Cook's vessel The <i>Endeavour</i>, from a pencil sketch by
Buchan." Buchan was one of Mr. Banks's artists, and a sketch of the
<i>Endeavour</i> by him would be of great value. But it is certain
that the ship drawn in this picture is <i>not</i> the
<i>Endeavour</i>.]</p>
<p>One of these plans, now at the Pioneer Club, Sydney, is dated
25th April, 1768, and gives the hull of the <i>Endeavour</i> when
she entered Deptford dock, and the additions that are to be made.
Firm lines show the old coal-ship: dotted lines show the additions
that will make her a ship of discovery. The second plan, now at
Kurnell, Botany Bay, is dated 11th July, 1768, and shows the hull
when the additions have been made, and she is ready for the voyage.
Using these two plans Captain Bayldon has drawn the picture of the
<i>Endeavour</i> which you will find immediately below. There may
possibly be a few small mistakes, but I doubt that anybody but
Captain Cook can find them. If Captain Cook had watched the drawing
of the picture, he would, perhaps, have taken pencil in hand, and
put in a slight alteration here or there. But he would have told
you that it is a first-rate picture of the <i>Endeavour</i> as he
sailed her, accurate, not only in a general way, but also in
details. For, in addition to the plans of the hull, good use has
been made of other information. When you study Cook's journal with
care you find that he tells a good deal about the various parts of
the ship. And there are books written about this time which give a
full account of everything in a ship and everything on
it&mdash;masts, sails, rigging, capstans, windlasses, anchors and
everything else. There is not a single line in the picture for
which a good reason cannot be given.</p>

Captain Bayldon's drawing of the <i>Endeavour</i><br>

<p>As we are to be passengers in the voyage, we'll take a good look
at our ship, go on board and make ourselves at home. A friendly
seaman promises to run us over the ship, and to explain the things
we see. And we'll add to his information what we've learnt about
the ship, and shipboard life, from the journals of those who sailed
upon her. Please look at the picture.</p>
<p>First we'll note the ship's measurements. Her length is 105
feet, that is, less than twice the length of a cricket-pitch, and
just half the length of a Manly ferry steamer. Her breadth is 29
feet, a little less than the breadth of a Manly ferry
steamer&mdash;you can walk across her comfortably in ten paces. Her
depth amidships is 20 feet, about double the height of a room. The
water-line marks her draft when starting on her voyage&mdash;13
feet 8 inches. Had she been full of coals, instead of being full of
provisions, she would have been 1 foot 4 inches deeper in the
water, with a draft of 15 feet. Her tonnage is 366 tons; the
tonnage of a Manly ferry steamer is a third as much
again.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[*</p>
<p>The measurements of the largest Manly ferry steamers are: length
210 feet; breadth 32 feet; tonnage 500 tons. The measurements of
the largest North Shore ferry steamers are: length 183 feet;
breadth 30 feet; tonnage 447 tons.]</p>
<p>You'll notice that she's painted in three colours: yellow
(sulphur) on top; then a band of black (tar); and at bottom a daub
of pitch and brimstone, which gives you green or brown, according
to your mixture.</p>
<p>Climbing on board, we first go down the ladder into the hold.
There's plenty of room, for it stretches the length of the ship,
and amidships is 11 feet high. "<i>This</i> room," says our friend,
"you can't enter. It's the spirit cellar. It's locked up, and the
Captain has the key. The hold, you see, is pretty full up. Here's a
good store of coal&mdash;for the kitchen-oven, and for stoves to
keep us warm as we go round Cape Horn, and to give damp parts of
the ship a good airing. At the bottom of the hold, beneath
everything else, is iron ballast; for the cargo isn't heavy enough
to make the ship safe and stable in a storm. These are casks of
water. We seamen don't quite like the look of them. Water <i>in
cask</i>, especially when it's Thames water, is apt in a few weeks
to go bad, and even stinking; and there's a dreadful rule in the
navy, made by "Old Grog" 28 years ago, which says that our rum and
brandy must be mixed with water!<sup>*</sup> One must, no doubt,
have water on board&mdash;plenty of water. John Thomson, the cook,
wants water for cooking. And the Captain has a strange and
troublesome idea that we ought to wash ourselves regularly to keep
off scurvy. Water is good for several purposes; but not for
drink."</p>
<p class="note">[* At first spirits were served out pure. But in
1740 Admiral Vernon, called "Old Grog" on account of a grogram coat
he wore in dirty weather, ordered that the spirits must be watered
before issue&mdash;how much watered depended on what the officer
thought of the seaman&mdash;the worse the seaman, the more the
water. The mixture was called <i>grog</i>.]</p>
<p>"But the main cargo is casks of provisions&mdash;enough to eat
and drink, they say, for eighteen months; and we suspect we'll have
to make them last a good deal longer than eighteen months. For the
Captain has a pestilent notion that at a pinch we can get along on
two-thirds allowance; and the pinch&mdash;a long hard
pinch&mdash;is sure to come, whenever he sees a chance of making a
discovery at the cost of our stomachs! The Captain's notion of a
bill of fare at <i>full</i> allowance is this: 'Suppose,' he says,
'four men to mess or eat together, which is very common, their
daily allowance will be as follows:&mdash;Each man is allowed every
day one pound of biscuits, as much small beer as he can drink'
("good!") 'or a pint of wine,<sup>*</sup> 'or half a pint of
brandy, rum or arrack' ("mixed with cask-water!") 'They' (that is
the mess of four) 'will have besides on <i>Monday</i>&mdash;half a
pound of butter, about 10 ounces of Cheshire cheese, and as much
boiled oatmeal or wheat as they can eat: <i>Tuesday</i>&mdash;two
four-pound pieces of beef, <i>or</i> one four-pound piece of beef,
3 pounds of flour, and one pound of raisins, or half a pound of
suet: <i>Wednesday</i>&mdash;butter and cheese as on Monday, and as
much boiled pease as they can eat: <i>Thursday</i>&mdash;two
two-pound pieces of pork with pease: <i>Friday</i>&mdash;the same
as Wednesday: <i>Saturday</i>&mdash;the same as Tuesday:
<i>Sunday</i>&mdash;the same as Thursday. Sugar and oil are served
in place of butter and cheese: a pound of the one or a pint of the
other are equal to one pound of butter or 21 ounces of
cheese.'"<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Cook took on board "as much wine as the ship can
conveniently stow."]</p>
<p class="note">[** This was the bill of fare in Cook's ship in his
next voyage in the <i>Resolution</i>. No doubt the bill of fare in
the <i>Endeavour</i> was similar. I fear, however, a <i>seaman</i>
did not get "as much small beer as he could drink." Beer for only
28 days was put aboard: a great pity, thought Cook, for it "proved
very good to the last cask." Beer casks for <i>seamen</i> took too
much room. There was only room for the beer casks of "gentlemen."
Mr. Banks and his friends had "small beer and porter on tap" in the
Pacific, and enjoyed it thoroughly.]</p>
<p>"On the whole we think we'll have enough to eat. But, seeing
that this is to be our bill of fare <i>for three years</i>, it does
look a bit monotonous! Day after day, week after week, year after
year, the same old biscuit, the same old pork! We wonder what state
they'll be in when we take them out of cask a year or two
hence."</p>
<p>In truth they were for the most part in better state than there
was reason to expect. On the 23rd of September, 1769, more than a
year after they had been put on board, Mr. Banks wrote down what he
thought of them. "Our ship's beef and pork are
excellent:<sup>*</sup> pease, flour and oatmeal are at present, and
have been in general very good; our bread" (that is, biscuit),
"indeed, is but indifferent, occasioned by the quantity of vermin
that are in it. I have seen hundreds, nay, thousands, shaken out of
a single biscuit.<sup>**</sup> We in the Cabin" (that is, the
dining-room of the officers and "gentlemen") "have, however, an
easy remedy for this, by baking it in an oven, not too hot, which
makes them walk off, but this cannot be allowed to the ship's
people" (that is the crew), "who must find the taste of these
animals very disagreeable, as they every one taste as strong as
mustard, or rather spirits of hartshorn. They are of five
kinds"&mdash;and Banks gives their Latin names!&mdash;"this last,
however, is scarce in the common bread" (that is, biscuit), "but
vastly plentiful in white meal biscuits, as long as we had any
left. Wheat has been boiled for the breakfasts of the ship's
company, two or three times a week, in the same manner as frumenty"
(porridge)"is made. This has, I believe, been a very useful
refreshment to them, as well as an agreeable food, which I myself
and most of the officers in the ship have constantly breakfasted
upon in the cold weather. The grain was originally of a good
quality, and has kept without the least damage. Portable soup is
very good; it has now and then required an airing to prevent it
from moulding. Sour krout is as good as ever. Our malt liquors have
answered extremely well; we have now both small beer and porter on
tap, as good as ever I drank, especially the latter. The small beer
has some art used to make it keep."</p>
<p class="note">[* The excellent beef and pork, however, grew less
excellent. About a year later, when they were on two-third
allowance, Banks admits that "our provisions were by now so much
wasted by keeping that that allowance was little more than was
necessary to keep life and soul together!" Mr. Forster, a man of
science who sailed with Cook in his next voyage, wrote of "the
loathed diet of salted meat, of which the juices were utterly
destroyed by lying in pickle for 3 years." Pickled meat was called
salt junk. <i>Junk</i> was the name given to remnants of old cables
and ropes.]</p>
<p class="note">[** "I have sometimes," Banks writes elsewhere,
"had twenty at a time in my mouth, every one of which tasted as hot
as mustard."]</p>
<p>But how provisions taste depends a good deal on the cook. "Climb
up this ladder to the lower deck," says our friend. "You'll find
things pretty comfortable again. At all events you'll be able to
stand upright; for on the <i>Endeavour</i> there are seven feet
between lower and upper decks, whereas in a war-ship there are only
five or six. Now walk forward, and you'll find John Thomson, in his
galley or kitchen&mdash;when we go on the upper deck, we'll see his
kitchen chimney coming out abaft the foremast. As for John Thomson,
the fact is, we seamen would like to know a little more about him
and his cookery. The first man the Lords of the Admiralty sent on
board as cook was found by the Captain to be a lame infirm man,
incapable of doing his duty! The Captain managed to get him
removed, and recommended a man named Pritchard. But the Lords of
the Admiralty replied that a job must be found for John Thomson,
and that the only job open was that of cook on the
<i>Endeavour</i>. So we'll have to eat John Thomson's dishes for
the next three years!"</p>
<p>John Thomson proved a thoroughly good cook. No complaints about
his dishes are made in the journals, and I'm sure complaints would
have been made had his cookery been bad. The Captain, says one who
travelled with him in his last voyage, "always kept a good table."
He expected a cook, as well as other men, to do his duty, and he
would have said something strong had John Thomson failed to do his.
Mr. Joseph Banks, who had eaten the best dinners in London,
thoroughly enjoyed Thomson's porridge at breakfast, says that a
shark cooked by Thomson was so good that everyone "from the Captain
to the swabber, dined heartily upon it," and describes a soup made
by Thomson out of a cuttle-fish as "one of the best soups I ever
ate." Who would not be delighted to get a cook who could show such
a testimonial from Mr. Joseph Banks? I'm sure that John Thomson's
cookery had a great deal to do with the success of the voyage. And
it is with regret that I read in the Captains journal that among
four men who died in one day in the dreadful voyage from Batavia to
the Cape was "John Thomson, ships cook." I think the Captain might
have found time, even on that sad day, to write one sentence in
praise of the thousand good dinners John Thomson had cooked on the
<i>Endeavour</i>.</p>
<p>The seamen&mdash;you'll see some of them in the picture of the
<a href="#il-06">landing at Botany Bay</a>&mdash;eat their dinners
in the big open space amidships. Here at night they sleep in
hammocks; and here at mid-day, hammocks rolled up and put away,
they sit on rough benches at a rough table, eat John Thomson's
dinners, and talk the talk of 18th century seamen. It's strong,
rough, full-flavoured sort of talk. Mr. Forster, a pompous German
man of science, who sailed with Cook in his <i>next</i> voyage,
overheard the seamen talking, as, huddling round a fire, they ate
one of the first meals ever eaten by Englishmen in the New Zealand
bush. They "recited," he says, "a number of droll stories,
intermixed with hearty curses, oaths and indecent expressions, but
seldom without real humour." At a later date, during a violent
tempest, he heard "the voices of the sailors louder than the
blustering winds or the raging ocean itself, uttering horrible
volleys of curses and oaths. They execrated every limb in varied
terms, piercing and complicated beyond the power of description.
Inured to dangers from their infancy, they were insensible to its
threats, and not a single reflection bridled their blasphemous
tongues. I know nothing comparable to the dreadful energy of their
language."</p>
<p>After dinner comes the big smoke or chew&mdash;though in truth
it's hard to say when the chew does not come. It's curious that
while in the journals there's endless news of drink, there's hardly
any news of tobacco. But tobacco is always in pouch, and nearly
always in mouth. One of Cook's servants made tobacco-pouches out of
seal-skin, and the seamen were very keen to get one.<sup>*</sup> In
Tahiti a curious thing happened. Banks was told that a friendly
native named Tubourai was dying, and hastened to his house. He
found Tubourai leaning against a post. He had been deadly sick, and
"told me he would certainly die in consequence of something our
people had given him to eat, the remains of which were shown me
carefully wrapped up in a leaf. This, upon examination, I found to
be a chew of tobacco, which he had begged of some of our people,
and, trying to imitate them in keeping it in his mouth, as he saw
them do, had chewed it almost to powder." Tubourai was feeling just
as anyone feels when he's smoked his first cigar. He knows he's
dying, and wishes he was dead. "I prescribed cocoa-nut milk," says
Banks, "which soon restored him to health." Banks himself disliked
the habit of chewing tobacco, and writes of "the nauseous smell of
that herb."</p>
<p class="note">[* The desire for a tobacco pouch took a big part
in a very sad story. One evening a marine threw himself overboard.
"He was a very good young man," says Banks, "scarcely 21 years of
age, remarkably quiet and industrious." One of the Captain's
servants, going away in a hurry, had given him a sealskin to hold.
The servant was going to cut up the seal-skin to make <i>tobacco
pouches</i>. He had promised a pouch to several men, but had
refused to give one to this marine, who now took his chance to cut
off a piece. The owner, returning, took the piece from him, but
made no complaint to the officers. But the <i>marines</i> "stood up
for the honour of their corps so highly that they drove the young
fellow almost mad by representing his crime in the blackest
colours." The Sergeant declared that he would himself complain of
his most inexcusable crime. "This affected the young man much, so
he went to his hammock; soon after the Sergeant called him on deck;
he got up, and slipping past the Sergeant, went forward; it was
dusk, and the people were not convinced that he had gone overboard
till half an hour after the event."]</p>
<p>Aft of the seamen's dining-sleeping room, a bulk-head or wooden
partition runs across the deck. Behind it are the cabins of
officers and "gentlemen." They dwell apart from the crew&mdash;the
"common people" Banks calls them&mdash;glad not to overhear "the
dreadful energy of their language," and to get a chance of quiet
rational conversation about navigation and botany. The arrangement
of their cabins, under the quarter deck, is made to suit the
comfort and convenience of Mr. Banks and his friends. There are so
many of them that it's necessary to have the cabins in two floors.
The cabins on the lower floor are only 5 feet high&mdash;miserably
uncomfortable for a voyage of three years! Those on the upper floor
are 7 feet high&mdash;the extra 2 feet makes a big difference. They
are occupied by the Captain, Mr. Green (the astronomer), Mr. Banks,
Dr. Solander and Mr. Banks's draughtsmen. The unfortunate officers
are in the pokey 5-feet high cabins on the lower floor. On one side
of the ship are the cabins of the First Lieutenant (Lieut. Hicks),
the Surgeon (Dr. Monkhouse), and the Gunner (Mr. Forwood); on the
other side are those of the Master (Mr. Molyneux), the 2nd
Lieutenant (Lieut. Gore), and the Captain's Clerk (Mr. Orton). You
can see all their cabins marked and allotted on the plan of the
hull.</p>
<p>It's a pity Mr. Banks could not take a photo of his cabin. But
he drew a pretty good picture of it in two passages in his journal.
The first is a description of a scene one stormy night. "My bureau
was overset, and most of the books were about the cabin floor; so
that, with the noise of the ship working, the books, etc., running
about, and the strokes our cots or swinging beds gave against the
top and sides of the cabin, we spent a very disagreeable night!"
The second passage describes a scene in the cabin when the
<i>Endeavour</i> was approaching New Zealand. "Now I do wish that
our friends in England could, by the assistance of some magical
spying-glass, take a peep at our situation: Dr. Solander sits at
the cabin table describing; myself at my bureau journalising;
between us hangs a bunch of seaweed" (just picked up); "upon the
table lie the wood and barnacles" (also just picked up; is Dr.
Solander "describing" them?); "they would see that, notwithstanding
our different occupations, our lips move often; and, without being
conjurors, might know that we were talking about what we should see
upon the land which, no doubt, we shall see very soon."</p>
<p>The Captain, the gentlemen, and the officers dine in the "great
cabin" in the stern. The Captain and Mr. Banks can enter it from
their sleeping cabins, the others come to it through a "lobby." The
furniture of the room is comfortable; for the Captain, as well as
Mr. Banks, likes to see things done in good style. There's a good
table, and comfortable chairs. The floor covering is green baize.
It's a well-lighted and airy room; for, in addition to two windows
in the sides, there are five windows in the stern&mdash;see the
<a href="#il-08">picture</a>&mdash;giving an excellent look-out.
How I would like to give you the table-talk of Captain Cook and Mr.
Joseph Banks!</p>
<p>"Now," says our friend, "climb these steps. They take you from
the gentlemen's cabins to the upper deck. You'll come out at a
hatchway between the wheel and the capstan. This is the
quarter-deck, and is reserved for the use of officers and
gentlemen. Seamen only come upon it when on duty. You see the
wheel? The rudder is moved by a long tiller, which is fastened by
ropes and pulleys to the wheel; so that a turn of the wheel directs
the ship's course. You can see the tiller under a platform which
the Captain has had built over it, in order that Mr. Banks and the
gentlemen&mdash;who, between you and me, are clumsy landlubbers,
and sometimes a bit of a nuisance&mdash;may walk about and take the
view, without tumbling over tiller and tiller-ropes. At the stern,
every two hours, stand seamen who have to find out how fast the
ship is travelling. They drop a small line into the sea, and note
how many feet of the line run out in a certain number of seconds.
Just ahead of the steersman at the wheel is the bittacle; a small
locker containing a compass and other nautical instruments. The
capstan is for heaving on ropes. Here are a couple of
carriage-guns&mdash;they can be wheeled about as you like&mdash;and
some small swivel guns. This boat is the <i>yawl</i>, well lashed
down on deck. She's about ten feet long, and can just hold seven
men. Hanging over the stern is the <i>jolly boat</i>, about eight
feet long, and able to hold about five men. Mr. Banks also has a
tiny boat of his own, in which he'll paddle round the ship when
there's no wind, shooting birds and fishing up things that will
astonish you. It might hold say four men at a pinch."</p>
<p>"Now, step down to the main-deck, the seamen's deck. They reach
it by ladders from their dining-sleeping room you've seen down
below on the lower deck. There are two of these ladders. Look
carefully at the hatchways where they come to the upper deck. They
are simply holes, surrounded by coamings&mdash;that is, boards of a
foot or so high&mdash;but with no other protection. In very bad
weather we may have to fasten them up with hatches, or boards. But,
if we do, we'll get pretty well stifled down below; and in general
we count on having them open. No doubt that looks a bit dangerous,
for if a sea gets on board, it'll go right down the hatchway, and
swamp the lower deck. You think we ought to have an extra-high
bulwark to keep the sea out? No, the bulkwark here at the waist is
only one foot high, yet we feel perfectly safe."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Mr. Banks writes:&mdash;"The ship during the
gale has shown her excellence in <i>laying to</i> remarkably well,
shipping scarce any water, though it blew at times vastly strong.
The seamen say they never knew a ship lay to so well as this does,
so lively and at the same time so easy. The ship goes better since
her shaking." On the other hand, Banks says the <i>Endeavour</i>
was "but a heavy sailer"; "indeed we could not expect her to be any
other from her <i>build</i>." Seven miles an hour was "no very
usual thing."]</p>
<p>"What a fine sea vessel," says Captain Bayldon, "the cat-built
bark really was, to need only this little bulwark. Our iron
wool-clippers, with bulwarks five feet high, would frequently be
filled with the green seas they used to ship aboard. What sad
scenes these little bulwarks witnessed between Batavia and the
Cape, when seamen were dying each day. Resting on them was the
plank on which was placed the dead seaman, sewn up in his canvas
hammock, with a round shot between his feet, and covered with the
old Red Ensign. Then the brief burial service; and the plank tilted
upwards to 'commit the body to the Deep, in the hope of a joyful
Resurrection.'"</p>
<p>The boat on the main deck is the long-boat, about 22 feet long,
and able to carry about 20 people. The pinnace&mdash;out of sight
in the picture&mdash;is about 14 feet long, and can carry about 12.
All boats are firmly lashed down. They play a <i>very</i> important
part in the story. They explore the shores of Botany Bay, and feel
the way mile by mile, almost inch by inch, among the treacherous
coral reefs off the coast of Queensland. When the ship was stuck on
the coral reef, it seemed that the boats would offer the only
chance of escape; and a very poor chance it seemed, "for we well
knew," says Banks, "that our boats were not capable of carrying us
all ashore, so that some, probably most of us, must be drowned."
There were about 90 men on board, and the boats would find it hard
to carry more than 50.</p>
<p>The thing on the after side of the foremast is the
windlass.<sup>*</sup> It's for heaving in the big hempen cables, 12
inches round and 720 feet long. It's a roller; and the cable's
wound round it. Bars are fitted into holes in it, and the seamen
heave down on them, and "howl"&mdash;it's a long hard
job&mdash;some fore-runner of the later beautiful heaving-in songs.
When they left Batavia, everyone was so glad to get away that there
wasn't a man on ship, says Banks, who didn't heave. I like to think
of Mr. Joseph Banks heaving and howling with "the common people."
When the cable's hove in, it's carefully examined, to see if it's
badly chafed by a rocky sea-bottom. If so, the chafed part is cut
out, and the two ends are spliced together&mdash;a splice that's
very difficult to make, and a good seaman prides himself on making
it well. Then the cable's put away on the deck down below, and the
anchor's secured to the bow, ready for use any moment. When the
anchor's let go, a long buoy-rope's made fast to it, by which, in
case the cable parts, the anchor can be hove up again.</p>
<p class="note">[* The <i>capstan</i> on the quarter-deck is the
same sort of thing as the <i>windlass</i>; but at a capstan the men
heave <i>on</i> or <i>push</i>, as they go a round on the deck. You
can use more force heaving <i>down</i> at a windlass than heaving
<i>on</i> at a capstan.]</p>
<p>You see there's not much room to move about on deck, There are
two hatches, and two boats. There's the kitchen chimney. There are
four pumps, one on each side of the main- and the fore-mast; they
look like village pumps. There are pens for pigs, and coops for
fowls. There are two spare top-masts and two spare top-gallant
masts lying on deck; for it's not uncommon for masts to break in
gales. Foreward also the deck is crowded&mdash;there's the
bowsprit; there are heavy baulks of timber called bitts, for making
the cable fast, when lying at anchor; and there are the anchors
themselves. The biggest anchor, the sheet anchor, is used only on
special emergencies. The next biggest, the best bower, and the
small bower, are in general use, one on each side. Then there are
stream-anchors, and kedge-anchors, for use in boats when sent to
heave the ship in some particular direction&mdash;all most useful
off the Queensland coast.</p>
<p>Over the sides of the ship are the chains, by which the rigging
is fastened to the hull. Between the chains and the ship-side is a
heavy plank. On dangerous coasts a seaman will stand on it, heaving
in the lead and calling the depth. Never were leadsmen so
hard-worked as the leadsmen of the <i>Endeavour</i> off the
Queensland coast. "We have sailed," wrote Cook, "about 360 leagues
(1080 miles) by the lead, without ever having a leadsman out of the
chains; a circumstance that perhaps never happened to any ship
before, and yet it was here absolutely necessary." Mr. Banks found
the plank a convenient place to stand on, big net in hand, pulling
up anything that got into it.</p>
<p>The sails in the picture are the sails that would usually be
carried in moderate weather. Cook notes day by day their furling
and unfurling, and so makes it possible for a seaman to know
exactly what sails were used, and exactly how they were used. Look
at the three masts, the foremast, the main-mast, the mizen. Each is
formed of parts firmly fastened together; so that if a gale smashes
a top-mast, or a topgallant mast, you can clear away the wreckage,
and make good use of the spare masts on the deck. The height of the
top of the main-mast from the deck is nearly 100 feet. Imagine Mr.
Banks and Tupia at the mast-head, saying farewell to beautiful
Tahiti; or young Nick shouting at top-voice that he sees the coast
of New Zealand; or Captain Cook, looking with keen eyes at the
coral reefs, and wondering "is it possible I'll ever get through
them?" "After having viewed our position from the mast-head, I saw
we were surrounded on every side with dangers, in so much that I
was quite at a loss to know which way to steer!"</p>
<p>Then look at the Flags. The Flag at the stern is the <i>Red
Ensign</i>. It was under the Red Ensign that both Naval and
Merchant ships sailed in the 18th Century. The White
Ensign&mdash;now the Naval Ensign&mdash;was then only flown when
ships were under the command of a Vice-Admiral; the Blue Ensign
only when under the command of a Rear-Admiral. Cook, therefore, on
all three voyages, sailed under the Red Ensign. He might also hoist
the Union Jack on a small flag-staff on the bowsprit; and, when he
approached a Dutch island, he "hoisted a Jack on the foretopmast
head." Ashore also he hoisted the Jack&mdash;as, for example, at
Tahiti, at New Zealand, at Botany Bay, and at Possession Island. It
was like the Union Jack of our days, without the diagonal red cross
of St. Patrick, which was added in 1801, at the Union of Great
Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p>Now look at the Pennant or Pendant. The chief difference between
the Navy and the Merchant service was that, whereas Naval vessels
carried Pennants at the masthead, Merchant vessels were not allowed
to do so. Pennants were of various designs: either entirely red; or
red, with St. George's cross on a white field; or red, white and
blue throughout the entire length. They had either one, or two or
three tails. There seems to have been no strict regulations as to
which kind of pennant was to be used.</p>
<p>And now, we'll make acquaintance with the <i>men</i> of the
<i>Endeavour</i>. James Cook is Lieutenant in command. It was not
till his return from the voyage that he was given the rank of
Captain. But the seamen of the <i>Endeavour</i> called him
"Captain," and so will we. The First Lieutenant, Zachary Hicks, is
ill of consumption, and "hath been dying ever since," wrote Cook,
recording his death only a month before home was reached. The
Second Lieutenant is John Gore, a first-rate seaman, who has
already sailed round the world, and who is to sail in Cook's third
voyage, and to bring the ships home. He is also a first-rate shot,
the first Englishman who ever shot a kangaroo. The Master&mdash;a
very important officer, who looked after matters of
navigation&mdash;is Robert Molyneux, an able fellow, who drank
himself to death. Surgeon Monkhouse is a <i>most</i> excellent man;
a splendid doctor, and a delightful companion if you get the chance
of a walk ashore. Of Stephen Forwood, the Gunner, we shall hear
more in a moment. He's in charge of 10 carriage guns and 12
swivels. There's an armourer. There's a boatswain, a carpenter and
a sailmaker, with their workshops on the lower deck. Each officer
has his "mate" or assistant. And there are about forty "able
seamen." There are twelve marines&mdash;that is, soldiers who serve
on ships. And Mr. Banks, his men of science, and his servants, make
ten. Ninety-four in all.</p>
<p>There's no parson on board. The Captain reads Divine Service on
Sundays&mdash;though perhaps not every Sunday. He "celebrated
Divine Service" at least twice at Tahiti; and Banks fixed an hour
when natives could be present, "that they might see our behaviour,
and that we might, if possible, explain to them the reasons for
it." "The natives," he says, "imitated my motions, standing,
sitting or kneeling as they saw me do." But they asked no
questions, and would listen to no explanations! No doubt the
Captain celebrated Divine Service in the conscientious way in which
he did everything. His widow treasured the Bible he had used. In
her old age&mdash;she lived fifty-six years after his
death&mdash;she "kept four days in the year of solemn fasting,
during which she came not out of her own room." They were the days
on which she had lost her husband and her three boys. She passed
those days in prayer and meditation with "Mr. Cook's Bible." That
Bible is now in the Australian Museum, Sydney. It has marvellous
pictures of the entrance into Noah's Ark, and of the death of
Goliath. We are told that Cook used this Bible "in his last
voyage." I do not know whether he also used it on the
<i>Endeavour</i>. It is old enough to make that possible. For it
was printed in 1765, three years before the <i>Endeavour</i>
sailed.</p>
<p>We glance down the list of seamen's names, and wonder what sort
of men they were, how they passed the endless time, and what they
talked about. As we sail round the world with them, we shall make
acquaintance with a good many; and we shall find that we are in
company of very human men, of very remarkable faults, and of even
more remarkable virtues. Some of them we shall come to know better
if we sail with Cook in his later voyages; for the best of Cook's
men had a way of sticking to him; and when they heard he was off
again, were aye ready to be off with him.</p>
<p>Look at these young fellows on deck. Some of them are men of
high ability and of charming character. Here is midshipman Isaac
Smith, cousin of Cook's wife. He was "of great use to me," wrote
Cook at the end of the voyage, "in assisting to make surveys,
plans, drawings, etc., in which he is very expert." So "expert,"
indeed, was he in these and in other matters that, in the end, he
became Admiral Isaac Smith. In days when New South Wales was a
prosperous colony under Governor Macquarie, the Admiral would tell
you that he was the first Englishman who had ever jumped ashore at
Botany Bay. "Now then Isaac," sang out Cook as the boat rowed in,
"you go first!" and Isaac jumped on to a rock which you may jump on
to to-day.</p>
<p>In 1830, sixty years after he had jumped this jump, Admiral
Smith, living in London with his cousin Mrs. Cook, was asked for
information about Captain Cook by a gentleman who had heard it said
that the Captain had been a severe man. The Admiral wrote him a
letter, the rough draft of which is now in the Australian Museum,
Sydney. "Mrs. Cook," he wrote, "feels herself hurt by the idea that
the Captain was severe, and says he was a most kind and
affectionate husband, and a good father to his children, whom he
truly loved, and she always found fault with the picture for that
stern look which it has, though otherwise a good likeness. As for
myself, who was with him the two first voyages as a petty officer,
a youngster, I never thought him severe, and he was both loved and
properly feared by the ship's company; and when he was very ill,
the first question asked both by officers and men on the relief of
the watch at night was <i>how does the Captain do, is he
better</i>?"</p>
<p>Make a friend, as soon as you can, of Charles Clerke, master's
mate. Let me tell you something about him. He served as a boy in
the war against France. In one fight he was stationed in the top of
a mast. The mast was shot clean overboard, and overboard went
Charles Clerke with the mast. Happily he was fished up alive and
unhurt. He's already once sailed round the world, and he's to sail
in all Cook's voyages. After Cook's death, he took his place in
command, though himself in desperate health&mdash;he died a few
months later in Kamschatka. If you would know what sort of man
Charles Clerke was, read the letters he wrote at later dates to his
friend and fellow-voyager, Mr. Joseph Banks. In these letters he
drew, without knowing it, a picture of himself&mdash;a jolly
seaman, slap-dash in talk and action; planning to escape his
creditors, in order to make another voyage with Cook; ready to sail
to the South Pole with Mr. Banks, if Mr. Banks insists, in a ship
so unsafe that the pilot will not even take her down the
river&mdash;"by God," said he, "I'll go to sea in a grog-tub if
required"; writing "at sea" in hopeless illness five days before
his death&mdash;"my friends will have no reason to blush in owning
themselves such, for I have most perfectly and justly done my duty
to my country, so far as my abilities would enable me." His spirits
were high and his talk was jolly, says his friend, to the last
hour. He refused to sail into warmer climate&mdash;he was trying to
find a way round the North of North America&mdash;though that was
the one chance of saving his life. One likes to know that Charles
Clerke was master's mate on the <i>Endeavour</i>; and we shall find
that there were many among the seamen who had some share of his
simple boyish heroic spirit.</p>
<p>Yet we should be wrong if we thought that the seamen of the
<i>Endeavour</i> were faultless men. Ask Captain Cook what he
thought of them; or, if you have no chance of doing that, turn over
the pages of his journal, where, you'll find, he expresses his
opinion quite freely. Twenty-one times he writes that he has
"punished &mdash; &mdash; with a dozen lashes," or, in bad cases,
"two dozen lashes." Though sometimes a bit "hasty," Cook was a
humane man; and you may be sure that, when Cook lashed, there was
generally good reason for lashing. And, if you had a talk with him,
he'd tell you stories that would make you wonder&mdash;especially
if you lived in the 18th Century&mdash;how he managed to take a
crew of such fellows round the world with punishments so few and so
trifling! For, after all, twenty-one floggings are not very many in
a voyage of three years, and every honest seaman of the reign of
George III. will tell you that a dozen or two lashes now and then
are necessary to make a ship go.</p>
<p>Ask the Captain, for example, his opinion of John Reading,
boatswain's mate, whose death he describes in the following
words:&mdash;"At 10 departed this life Jno. Reading, boatswain's
mate; his death was occasioned by the boatswain, out of very good
nature, giving him part of a bottle of rum last night, which, it is
supposed, he drank at once. He was found to be very much in liquor
last night; but as this was no more than was common with him when
he could get any, no further notice was taken of him than to put
him to bed, where this morning he was found speechless and past
recovery."</p>
<p>Or get the Captain to talk about Stephen Forwood, gunner, who
one night between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., with the help of three "able
seamen," "found means to take out of the spirit-cask on the
quarter-deck between 10 and 12 gallons of rum, being the whole that
was in the cask." They were caught in the act, and each able seaman
got the twelve lashes he so well deserved. The gunner escaped
lashing because he was the gunner; though, in truth, wrote Cook, he
"richly deserved the whole upon his back"; for his drunkenness had
made him "the only useless person on board ship."</p>
<p>Cook wrote down the horrid story next morning in such anger that
his corrections and inter-linings make the passage hard to read.
And then&mdash;at a later date, I think&mdash;he drew his pen
through it, so that it does not appear in the copy of the journal
he sent to England. I wonder if he did so after the following
event. The <i>Endeavour</i>, in extreme danger&mdash;I shall tell
the story later on&mdash;was making a dash for a very narrow
opening in the Great Barrier Reef. In the height of the
danger&mdash;"we were about 100 yards from the reef, where we
expected the ship to strike every minute"&mdash;Mr. Green, the
astronomer&mdash;by no means a faultless person&mdash;with the help
of two officers, calmly took an observation, which proved to be
"very good." The two officers who helped him were Mr.
Clerke&mdash;one is not surprised to find him there&mdash;and "Mr.
Forwood, the gunner." After all, he is not, it seems, an entirely
"useless person." When the <i>Endeavour</i> came home, Cook wrote a
letter to recommend that Mr. Forwood should be appointed to a soft
job in order to "give him sufficient time to recover his health,"
and become fit to serve as gunner in a new voyage.</p>
<p>And then ask the Captain to tell you how midshipman Magra and
Richard Orton, the clerk, spent a night off the coast of
Queensland. Both these men are of special interest to us. For
Richard Orton wrote the copy of Cook's journal which you may see
to-day in the Australian Museum, Sydney&mdash;and mighty well he
wrote it, seeing that he, too, was commonly dead drunk whenever he
could get drink. And James Magra, the son of a well-to-do and loyal
citizen of New York, was the man who in 1783, with name changed to
Matra, after much talk with his old fellow-voyager, Mr. Banks,
wrote a proposal that a colony should be founded in the bay in New
Holland which Mr. Banks and he had visited thirteen years
before&mdash;a proposal which was read by Lord Sydney, and was in
Lord Sydney's mind when he set about the foundation of the colony
five years later.</p>
<p>"Last night," wrote the Captain, "some time in the middle watch,
a very extraordinary thing happened to Mr. Orton, my clerk. He
having been drinking in the evening, some mischievous person or
persons took advantage of his being drunk, to cut off the clothes
from his back; not being satisfied with this, they sometime after
went into his cabin, and cut off parts of both ears as he lay
asleep in his bed. The person whom he suspected to have done this
was Mr. Magra, one of the midshipmen." Cook was told that "Magra
had once or twice before this in their drunken frolics cut off
Orton's clothes, and had been heard to say that, if it was not for
the law, he would murder him." These things considered, Cook
thought that "Magra was not altogether innocent." Mr. Orton, it was
true, was "a man not without faults," and it seemed that "he
himself was in some measure to blame." Still&mdash;so the matter
seemed to Cook&mdash;there was something wrong on board ship, if a
well-meaning man could not go comfortably to bed dead drunk without
danger of finding, when he woke up, that the ends of his ears had
been cut off, without his knowledge, by someone whom he could only
suspect! So he "dismissed Magra from the quarter-deck, and
suspended him from doing any duty in the ship." He was "one of
those gentlemen," he wrote angrily, "frequently found on board
King's ships that can very well be spared&mdash;to speak more
plain, good for nothing."</p>
<p>But that's not the end of the story. Three weeks later, after
the fearful adventure on the top of the coral reef, Cook groped his
way into the Endeavour River. "In justice to the ship's company,"
he wrote, after telling the story of escape, "I must say that no
men ever behaved better than they did on this occasion; animated by
the behaviour of every gentleman on board, every man seemed to have
a just sense of the dangers we were in, and exerted himself to the
utmost." Mr. Richard Orton wrote as usual his copy of Cook's words;
and then Cook, himself taking pen in hand, wrote on the margin of
the paper:&mdash;"This day I restored Mr. Magra to his duty, as I
did not find him guilty of the crimes laid to his charge." What I
very much suspect is that the real cause of the change in Cook's
opinion was some brave unrecorded action by the suspected
gentleman-midshipman. And it was at the same time, perhaps, that,
looking over old dates, he crossed out the unkind words that
"gentlemen" like Mr. Magra were "good for nothing." It is with
difficulty that one can make them out under Cook's cross
lines.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* This is so in the copy of the journal sent home
from Batavia. Cook forgot to make the correction in his own
journal.]</p>
<p>We must think of the men of the <i>Endeavour</i>, as Cook
thought of them. They were men "not without faults." Put a seaman
face to face with a bottle of rum, and he'll drink that bottle to
the last drop&mdash;and die. But put him face to face with danger,
and he'll become a hero&mdash;though he'll use pretty strong words
if you say so&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>We aren't no Jack Tar 'eroes,<br>
Nor we aren't no blackguards too,<br>
But thirsty men on shipboard,<br>
Most remarkable like you.</blockquote>
<p>A Captain's job was to get such thirsty men to do their best. In
Cook's opinion a dozen or two lashes now and then were a useful
means of persuasion. But he believed far more in the persuading
power of words of encouragement and praise; and he gave them, as he
gave lashes, when they were deserved, and much more frequently.
And, when faults were incurable, he thanked God that they were not
worse. Cook's face, said his friends, had "an air of
austerity"&mdash;the sort of "air" a schoolmaster's face has when
the rod's in hand&mdash;and his temper, they added, was "somewhat
hasty." You would think that a man with an "austere face" and a
"hasty temper" would find it hard to live day by day with a clerk
who got dead drunk night by night. But, after all, let us make the
best of things! Richard Orton, when dead drunk, goes quietly to bed
and sleeps it off; and next morning, he's ready to write with a
firm hand, which the soberest man might envy, a fair copy of the
account of last night's "drunken frolic!" Let us thank God that
Richard Orton is not worse! When the ship came home, Cook
recommended him as "worthy of promotion" to "some place in the
Custom-house, or any other public office."</p>
<p>If you wish to understand Cook's mind, note his way of getting
seamen to eat sour krout&mdash;krout means cabbage. The toughest
part of a Captain's job was to prevent seamen from dying from
scurvy, a disease caused mainly by lack of fresh food, and
especially by lack of vegetables. Now, if you had asked Cook what
words he would most like to have cut on his tombstone, he would
perhaps have answered:&mdash;"Here lies James Cook, who conquered
scurvy"; for he was prouder, I think, of his conquest of scurvy
than of his discoveries in the South Pacific. Now the best food to
conquer scurvy was stuff called <i>sour krout</i>&mdash;stuff,
which, I imagine, tastes as bad as it sounds. At least the seamen
thought so, and no amount of argument could persuade them to take a
mouthful. Now observe Cook's plan&mdash;a plan which, said he, "I
have never known to fail with seamen." He had sour krout dressed
every day for the cabin table for the benefit of the officers. As
for the seamen, they might take it or leave it, exactly as they
liked. In a week there was such a demand for sour krout that it was
"necessary to put everyone on board on an allowance; for such are
the tempers and disposition of seamen in general that whatever you
give them out of the common way&mdash;although it be ever so much
for their good&mdash;will not go down, and you will hear nothing
but murmurings against the man that first invented it; but the
moment they see their superiors set a value upon it, it becomes the
finest stuff in the world, and the inventor an honest fellow."</p>
<p>Cook's words help us to understand the temper and disposition,
not only of the seamen, but also of the Captain. We understand that
temper and disposition even better when we read what he wrote after
a catch of turtles and fish at the Endeavour River:&mdash;"Whatever
refreshment we got that would bear a division, I caused to be
equally divided among the whole company, generally by weight; the
meanest person in the ship had an equal share with myself, or any
one on board; and this method every commander of a ship, on such a
voyage as this, ought ever to observe." When we read these words we
have good hopes for the success of the voyage.</p>

<h3>HOW CAPTAIN COOK FAILED TO FIND A SOUTHERN CONTINENT, AND
SAILED ROUND NEW ZEALAND.</h3>
<p>One reason why the voyage of the <i>Endeavour</i> makes an
interesting story is the fact that the voyagers tell us so much
about it.</p>
<p>Captain Cook and several of the officers wrote logs&mdash;that
is, statements written from day to day, which tell in a few words
what has happened&mdash;how winds have blown, how sails have been
furled and unfurled, and at what rate the ship has travelled. More
interesting are the journals written by Captain Cook and Mr. Banks,
sometimes written from day to day, sometimes written up after a few
days have passed, and sometimes written&mdash;when a country like
New Zealand or Australia has been visited&mdash;during the leisure
of the voyage.</p>
<p>Captain Cook's journal was long thought to be lost, and we had
only the copies of it written by the clerk, Richard Orton. One of
these copies was bought by Mr. F. H. Dangar, who gave it to the
Australian Museum in Sydney, where it may now be seen. But recently
news came that the journal which Cook himself wrote still existed.
In 1923 it was bought by the Government of Australia; and, if you
call at the Mitchell Library in Sydney, you can read the words in
which Cook described in his own handwriting his stay in Botany Bay,
and his view of Port Jackson, as he sailed past. In his journal
Cook wrote down at some length, not only what happened, but also
what he thought about things; and it is here that we must look if
we wish to know, for example, his opinion of New Zealand and of
Australia as countries in which Britishers might settle.</p>
<p>Still more interesting is Mr. Banks's journal; for, while Cook
wrote to give information to the British Government, Banks wrote to
please himself; and everything that came into mind went down
red-hot on to the paper, in words written sometimes in such a hurry
that he feared he would scarcely understand his own language when
he read it again. Yet his writing, even when he wrote in a hurry,
is easier to read than the writing of most of us; and very
fascinating it is to read a story of adventure written on the day
he had lived it. This journal also disappeared, and we had to use a
copy of it which had been made. But happily <i>it</i> also
reappeared and is now, like Cook's journal, in the Mitchell Library
in Sydney.</p>
<p>And in telling the story of the voyage, I shall tell it as it
was told by Captain Cook and Mr. Banks in their
<i>journals</i>.</p>
<p>They sailed on the 26th of August, 1768, "all in excellent
health and spirits," says Banks, "perfectly prepared (in mind at
least) to undergo with cheerfulness any fatigues or dangers that
may occur." On the 10th of September they "dined in Africa, and
took leave of Europe for Heaven knows how long, perhaps for ever";
and the memory of friends made Banks sigh once, but not twice! A
<i>second</i> sigh, he says, would have given more pain to the
sigher than pleasure to those sighed for. Five precious days he
botanised in Madeira. One of them had to be sacrificed to the
"unsought honour of an official visit from the Governor"; but Banks
revenged himself on His Excellency by sending ashore an electrical
machine which "shocked him fully as much as he chose." At the
Equator, all who had not crossed before must be ducked, from Cook
and Banks to dogs and cats, or must buy off in rum or brandy. At
Rio there was trouble, for the Governor declared that Cook was a
trader<sup>*</sup>&mdash;foreign traders were not welcomed at
Rio&mdash;and locked up his sailors in loathsome dungeons on the
ground that they were smuggling. Cook's suspicion was that they
were "smuggling" the clothes off their own backs for rum. His
temper rose, and he and the Governor bombarded one another with
"memorials." On Christmas Day they were at sea, and, says Banks,
"all good Christians, i.e., all good hands, got abominably drunk,
so that all through the night there was scarce a sober man in the
ship. Weather, thank God, moderate, or the Lord knows what would
have become of us." They took the route round Cape Horn; and, on
the East coast of Tierra del Fuego, Banks led a botanical
expedition to some distant hills. They were surprised by a
snow-blizzard, and had to camp for the night. The two negroes got
the rum-bottle, drank every drop, and froze to death. Buchan the
artist fell in a fit<sup>**</sup>; and fat unhappy Solander lay
down on the snow, and said he must sleep. But the weather cleared
the next day; the survivors reached the ship; and the botanists
were supremely happy collecting shells and plants.</p>
<p class="note">[* The <i>Endeavour</i> certainly looked more like
a trader than a King's ship.]</p>
<p class="note">[* Buchan died at Tahiti.]</p>
<p>They sailed from Tierra del Fuego on the 21st of January, 1769.
They took a course more <i>westerly</i> than was usual, and looked
for the great rich and populous continent which, said Dalrymple,
must run "but a little way West of the common track"; and indeed
they would have run straight on to the continent, had the continent
been where Dalrymple said it must be. But they looked in vain. On
the 1st of March they were 1680 miles West of Chili, sailing
through what ought to have been a continent. But there were no
signs of land, nor were there even currents&mdash;"a great sign
that we have been near no land of any extent, because near land are
usually found currents."</p>
<p>On the 13th of April, 1769, they came to anchor at Tahiti, where
they were to observe the transit on the 3rd of June. On the night
of June 2nd-3rd, "one or other of us was up every half hour to
report on the weather." It was sometimes "clear," sometimes "hazy."
But "the sun rose as clear and bright as we could wish him." "There
was not so much as a cloud intervening," says Cook. "We very
distinctly saw an atmosphere or dusky shade round the body of the
planet."<sup>*</sup> Captain Cook and Mr. Green had done the duty
which, half a century before, Mr. Halley had committed to their
care. British astronomers, with up-to-date 18th Century telescopes
of two-feet focus, had carried on the study which Jeremiah Horrocks
had begun with his half-crown telescope that Sunday 130 years
before.</p>
<p class="note">[* Mr. Gale tells me that the "dusky shade"
prevented Cook from making the observation as <i>exactly</i> as was
desired. The chief aim was to determine the distance of the earth
from the sun, and the "dusky shade" threw out the
calculations&mdash;which were not completed till 1824&mdash;by a
few million miles. The observations of the next transits&mdash;in
1874 and 1882&mdash;were also spoilt by the "dusky shade."]</p>
<p>Meanwhile Banks was having the time of his life. He was in love
with the beautiful island, and with everything and everybody in it.
It was not only the "very pretty girl with a fire in her eyes." The
men were only less charming than the women. Banks gave them the
names of famous Greeks and Romans&mdash;Lycurgus (his real name was
Toobouratomital), Hercules, and Epicurus, who "ate most
monstrously." One would like to know <i>how</i> monstrously
Epicurus ate; for a <i>small</i> eater, says Banks, would make an
end of three bread-fruits (each bigger than two fists), two or
three fish, 14 or 15 bananas (each six to nine inches long, and
four or five round), and then "conclude his dinner with about a
quart of food as substantial as the thickest unbaked custard."
They, in return, named their visitors as they pleased. Cook became
"Toote," Solander "Torana," Banks "Tapane," and they drank the
health of King George under the name of "Kilnargo." With their new
friends the English kept perpetual holiday. Even their one fault
added to gaiety. They were thieves, but they were thieves of a
cleverness that turned thieving into miracle. If ever a man slept
with one eye open, that man was Cook; yet they stole his stockings,
he says, "from under my head, and yet I am certain I was not asleep
the whole time." Banks was chief thief-catcher; and very seriously
and very happily he played the game: "away we set at full cry, very
much like a pack of foxhounds; we ran and walked and walked and
ran, for, I believe, six miles"&mdash;to find that, very early in
the chase, the criminal had turned aside to take a quiet bath in a
brook.</p>
<p>But Banks was a man of science as well as a man of pleasure; and
nothing done by men, animals, fishes or plants was uninteresting to
his mind. With great vigour and with great happiness he studied
Nature in all its forms. In company with Surgeon
Monkhouse&mdash;fat Solander this time wisely left behind&mdash;he
had a long day's walk inland, past the hill slopes planted with
bread-fruit trees, past the last of the houses whose owners
refreshed them with cocoanuts, up among steep rocks and cascades,
where long strips of bark served as ropes by which to scramble from
ledge to ledge, though even on the ledges none but goats or Indians
could stand. For minerals Banks looked in vain. But he observed
that "the stones everywhere showed manifest signs of having been at
some time or other burnt." His guess was that the island had been
thrown up by a volcano, now extinct. And, to comfort those who
believed in the continent, over part of which Cook had sailed, he
suggested that perhaps it had been "sunk by dreadful earthquakes
and volcanoes two or three thousand fathoms under the sea, the tops
of the mountains only remaining clear above the waters in the shape
of islands."</p>
<p>But men are even more interesting than Nature; and Banks studied
them in his usual thorough way. The best plan, he thought, was "to
act a character." "I was prepared," he explains, "by stripping off
my European clothes, and putting on a small strip of cloth round my
waist, the only garment I was allowed to have. They then began to
smut me and themselves with charcoal and water, the Indian boy was
completely black, the women and myself as low as our shoulders; we
then set out." He gives a lively account of the ceremony, and of
"the surprise of our friends" at the Fort. The end was "we went
into the river and scrubbed one another until it was dark before
the blacking came off." Better fun and better science than the
blockhead's "grand tour" in weary old Europe!</p>
<p>On the 13th of July, 1769, they sailed from Tahiti. With them
sailed a native named Tupia, "a most proper man, well-born, chief
Tahowa or priest of this island." Banks had added him to his
"suite." "Thank Heaven," he says, "I have a sufficiency, and I do
not know why I may not keep him as a curiosity as my neighbours do
lions and tigers." The pious priest often prayed for a wind, and
boasted of the success of his prayers, which, adds Banks, he "never
began till he perceived a breeze so near the ship that it generally
reached him before his prayer was finished." Under the guidance of
Tupia and his winds, Cook visited the neighbouring islands, annexed
them, and named the group "the Society Isles," because "they lay
contiguous to one another." Then, on the 9th of August, 1769, they
"launched out into the ocean in search of what chance or Tupia
might direct us to."</p>
<p>Cook's next job, according to the instructions given him, was to
plunge South in search of the continent, whose coast, said
Dalrymple, must be not far away from Tahiti. He plunged South 1500
miles to 40&deg;, where he <i>should</i>, according to Dalrymple, have
been in the middle of a continent as big as Asia. But he could see
"not the least visible sign of land"; and the most that Banks could
see was some seaweed and a seal. Cook had meant to sail even
further Southward; but the weather grew so tempestuous that he
thought it wise to sail Northward into better climate. No doubt
there might be a continent further South; and, if there was a
continent, it would not be Cook's fault if he did not find it
sometime. But there was no chance to look for it now.</p>
<p>For what he had to do next, according to his instructions, was
to make for the strip of coast which Tasman had discovered 127
years before, and which had been called New Zealand. Tasman had
believed that this strip of coast was the Western edge of the
unknown Continent; and this was still the belief, not only of
Dalrymple, but also, says Banks, of "most thoughtful people,"
including Banks himself. This question at least could be settled. So
Cook sailed South-West for New Zealand.</p>
<p>On the 7th October young Nick sang out from the mast-head that
he saw land, and Cook named the point "Young Nick's Head." He
sailed into a bay which he named "Poverty Bay," "because it
afforded us no one thing we wanted"&mdash;a very bad name, say New
Zealanders, who have found in it a great deal that <i>they</i>
want.<sup>*</sup> Natives appeared in canoes; and Cook, wishing to
capture them and gain their friendship, fired over their heads. He
expected them, it seems, to jump overboard and surrender. It was
not a wise way of seeking friendship, though it might possibly have
succeeded in Tahiti. Instead of surrendering, the Maoris took their
arms, and attacked with such ferocity that the Englishmen had to
kill two or three to save their own lives. Cook admits that he had
made a bad mistake; but one cannot consent, he adds, to be knocked
on the head.</p>
<p class="note">[* The fact is that the voyagers, in fear of the
natives, were "always upon the same spot." They took only one walk,
which led then to a swamp.]</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a name="il-05" id="il-05"></a><img alt=""
src="1204111h-images/il-05.jpg"><br>
<br>
Sketch from Dalrymple's Map</p>
<p>Then he sailed South, past the great bay which he called Hawke's
Bay after the First Lord of the Admiralty. He followed the coast to
Latitude 40&deg; 34'; and then, "seeing no likelihood of meeting with a
harbour, and the face of the country visibly altering for the
worse," he decided that his time would be better spent by examining
the coast to the Northward. He gave Cape Turnagain its name
"because here we returned." Sailing North, he rounded East Cape,
visited the "Bay of Plenty," observed the transit of Mercury in
Mercury Bay, explored a "very fine river" which he named the
Thames, because it was as "broad as the Thames at Greenwich,"
anchored in the Bay of Islands, and, rounding Cape Maria Van Diemen
and the Three Kings, proved that Tasman had been right when he had
claimed the discovery of a sea-way to Chili. Off the Three Kings
the sailors celebrated their second Christmas "in the old-fashioned
way," ate goose pie, and "in the evening all hands were as drunk as
our forefathers used to be on like occasions."</p>
<p>Then Cook sailed down the West Coast, charting its features with
"a mingled audacity and caution" that are greatly admired by the
modern chart-maker. "Never," says Admiral Wharton, "has a coast
been so well laid down by a first explorer." He passed the islands
which screen Auckland with the remark that they probably "formed
some good harbours." He noted the noblest hill he had ever seen,
and named it Mount Egmont. Then he came to a "very broad and deep
bay or inlet, the Southern side of which seemed to form several
bays." Into one of these bays he determined to go, in order to
careen the ship and to obtain refreshment. He sailed up an inlet
which he named Queen Charlotte Sound, and anchored in "a very snug
cove," which he named Ship Cove. He calculated that Tasman's
Murderers' Bay was fifteen miles away; in reality it was seventy
miles away. The natives heaved a few stones, but became friendly
after conversation with Tupia. They had no tradition of Tasman's
visit; and, in fact, the tribe which had murdered the Dutchmen in
1642 had itself been murdered long before 1770.</p>
<p>The next business was to find whether Tasman and his Pilot had
been right when they had thought that the currents in the bay made
it probable that it was the entrance to a passage. Cook thought so
too; and he proved that they and he were right. While Banks and
Solander were botanising, he "climbed to the top of a hill, and in
about an hour returned in high spirits, having seen the Eastern Sea
and satisfied himself of the existence of a strait communicating
with it." An old native told him further that the land South of the
passage was not a continent, but consisted of two islands that
might be circumnavigated in a few days. On the 7th of February,
1770, he sailed through "our new straits"&mdash;which, says Banks,
"are to be called Cook's Straits"&mdash;feeling "the force of the
tide which roared like a mill-stream and ran at four knots when it
flowed fastest." Some of the officers still thought it possible
that the land they had now three-quarters circumnavigated might
nevertheless be united to a continent by an isthmus somewhere
between Cook's Straits and Cape Turnagain. To settle this question,
Cook sailed North till Cape Turnagain was seen from the South. "I
then," says Cook, "called the officers upon the deck, and asked
them if they were now satisfied that this land was an island, to
which they answered in the affirmative."</p>
<p>It remained to be seen whether the land to the South was also,
as the old man had told them, no part of a continent, but two
islands that might be circumnavigated in a few days. They sailed
Southward; and Banks who, though he had his doubts, was an
enthusiastic "continent-monger," noted with regret that "the land
inclined a good deal to the West." "We on board," he writes, "were
of two parties, one who wished that the land in sight might, the
other that it might not, be a continent. I myself have always been
most firm in the former wish, though sorry I am that my party is so
small, that I firmly believe that there are none more heartily
desirous of it than myself and one poor midshipman; the rest begin
to sigh for roast beef"; an accusation marvellously unjust to Cook,
to whom discovery was meat and drink, and who would have preferred
a continent, and indeed something very much smaller, to all the
roast beef of Old England.</p>
<p>By the 10th of March, it had become evident "much to the regret
of us continent-mongers," that the coast was falling away to an
end. They supposed Stewart Island to be a peninsula, and were
carried round a point "to the total destruction of our aerial
fabric called Continent." They coasted Northward, noting "steep
hills covered with prodigious fine woods," a beautiful and fertile
country, yet without the smallest sign of inhabitants. On the 25th
of March, they were once more in the western entrance of Cook's
Straits, and two days later anchored in a bay which was called
"Admiralty Bay." Cook noticed another bay to his Westward, which he
did not explore. He called it "Blind Bay," and believed that it was
Tasman's Murderers' Bay. And he was nearly right. Murderers' Bay is
a small bay in the North-West of Cook's Blind Bay.</p>
<p>The search for Dalrymple's continent had come to an end. Cook
had sailed over it, East, North and West. He had proved that it
came nowhere near Chili, nowhere near Tahiti, nowhere near New
Zealand. This was a disappointment for "continent-mongers." Yet
there was consolation for sensible people. For New Zealand, though
not part of a golden continent, was a group of islands, beautiful
and fertile, fit in all ways to be the happy home of British
colonists. Both Cook and Banks write with high praise of the
richness of the soil, shown by the growth of trees, the
straightest, the cleanest, the largest, Banks had ever seen, of
timber "fit for any kind of buildings, and thick enough to make
masts for vessels of any size." "It was the opinion of everyone on
board," wrote Cook, "that all sorts of European grain, fruit,
plants, etc., would thrive here; in short, was this country settled
by an industrious people, they would very soon be supplied not only
with necessaries, but many of the luxuries of life. Should it ever
become an object of settling this country, the best plan for the
first fixing of a colony would be either in the River Thames or the
Bay of Islands." Both these places have good harbours. In the River
Thames ships might be built, and settlements might easily extend
inland. Banks also votes for the River Thames, as "in every respect
the most proper place we have yet seen for establishing a
colony."</p>
<p>To some visitors it might have seemed that a strong reason
against any plan to establish a colony in New Zealand was the
manners and customs of the Maoris. This is Cook's description of
the welcome they gave him:&mdash;"As soon as they came within a
stone's throw of the ship, they would call out&mdash;'Haromoi
harenta a patoo ago!' that is, 'come here, come ashore to us and we
will kill you with our patoo patoos!"<sup>*</sup> They regard
foreigners as enemies, he explains, kill them all if they can, and
then eat them! Very unpleasant neighbours, some people would have
thought. But Cook took a kindlier view. "It does not appear to me
at all difficult," he says, "to form a settlement in this country."
He took the Maori yells as calmly as we take the yells of New
Zealand footballers. Cannibals, he explains, may be quite pleasant
people to live with, if you take care not to be eaten by them. And
there is no need to be eaten by them. The Maoris, in spite of a few
bad habits, are "a brave, open and warlike people, and void of
treachery." Show them, firstly, that you are stronger than they,
and secondly, that you don't mean to use your strength to hurt
them, and they ever after are "your very good friends."</p>
<p class="note">[* Banks writes:&mdash;"Their words were almost
universally the same-'Haromai haromai, harre uta a patoo-patoo
oge.' 'Come to us, come to us, come but ashore with us, and we will
kill you with our patoo-patoos.'" In the Australian Museum, Sydney,
you may see some of the patoo-patoos Cook brought home from New
Zealand.]</p>
<p>So New Zealand is an excellent place for a colony. "After
displaying the English colours," wrote Cook, "I took formal
possession of the place in the name of His Majesty." Indeed our
wonder must be that colonisation was so long delayed.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-2-3" id="ch-2-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>HOW CAPTAIN COOK DISCOVERED THE EASTERN COAST OF
AUSTRALIA.</h3>
<p>Cook's "instructions" said that he was to return to England
either by way of Cape Horn, or by way of the Cape of Good Hope.
There was no suggestion that he might return by way of the East
coast of New Holland. But Cook was allowed to think things out for
himself, and was free "to return to England by such route as I
should think proper." He would have liked to return by way of Cape
Horn, to settle the question whether there was a continent further
down South than he had sailed this voyage. But sails and rigging,
says Banks, had been rendered so bad by the blowing weather off New
Zealand, that we were by no means in condition to face the hard
gales which must be expected in a winter passage so far South. It
would have been easy enough to sail home by way of the Cape; but
there would have been no chance by that way to make discoveries.
They had still on board six months' provisions at two-thirds
allowance; and that was enough to allow them to go home by another
way, a way by which no ship had ever yet sailed, and which was
bound to lead them to very interesting discoveries. "It was
resolved," says Cook ,"upon leaving this coast to steer to the
Westward until we fall in with the East coast of New Holland, and
then to follow the direction Northward, or whatever direction it
might take us, until we arrive at its Northern extremity; or, if
this should be found impracticable, then to endeavour to fall in
with the land or islands discovered by Quiros"&mdash;that is our
New Hebrides.</p>
<p>Remember that when Cook wrote this, all he knew about the East
Coast of New Holland was what was drawn on Tasman's map, together
with the statement of a Spaniard, who had written 150 years before,
that Torres had sailed along the South of New Guinea. Of what lay
between Van Diemen's Land and New Guinea Cook knew no more than
Tasman had known; that is to say he knew nothing whatever. What he
hoped to do was to fill in the great gap; and he had not the least
idea what his discoveries would look like when put upon the
map.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* See <a href="#il-05">Dalrymple's map</a>.]</p>
<p>The first thing, therefore, was to fall in with Van Diemen's
Land as near as possible to the place where Tasman had left it when
he had sailed from Van Diemen's Land to New Zealand. So on the 1st
of April, 1770, Cook sailed Westward from the cape which Tasman had
seen when he had arrived in New Zealand, a cape which Cook, leaving
New Zealand, called Cape Farewell. What he meant to do was to sail
Westward till he came to the point in Van Diemen's Land whence
Tasman had sailed East. Unluckily he got a bit too far to the
North. Banks&mdash;who always must have his joke&mdash;chaffed Cook
that the ship was drawn that way by the distant scent of English
roast beef. But, as Cook explained, when you're in a sailing ship,
you can't go precisely the way you wish to go&mdash;not even if
you've Mr. Joseph Banks on board. Cook was, in fact, aiming as well
as he could at the point of Tasman's departure, and he had a good
chance of hitting it. On the 18th of April he was sailing on a
course which would probably have enabled him to link his
discoveries with Tasman's, or at least would have made him the
discoverer of Bass's Strait. But on that day Cook
records&mdash;"Winds <i>Southerly</i>, a hard gale with heavy
squalls attended with showers of rain, and a great sea from the
same quarter." Before the Southerly gale he ran, with the result
that Bass's Strait remained undiscovered till 1798. At daylight on
the 20th of April, Lieutenant Hicks saw land, "sloping hills
covered in part with trees and bushes, but interspersed with large
tracts of sand." Cook named the land "Point Hicks." They could see
no land to the South. Van Diemen's Land ought to be there, and "the
soon falling of the sea after the wind abated" seemed to prove that
it was there. But the coast "trended South-West, or rather more to
the Westward," and this made Cook "doubtful whether they are one
land or no. However," he said, "everyone who compares this journal
with that of Tasman will be as good judge as I am."</p>
<p>From Point Hicks Cook sailed North, looking for a harbour. On
the 22nd of April, he noted Bateman's Bay as a place "very little
sheltered, and yet the only likely anchoring place I have yet seen
on the coast." Next day he vainly sought an anchorage in the
neighbourhood of "the Pigeon House." On the 26th he noted that
Jervis Bay appeared to be sheltered from the North-East wind; but
the appearance was not favourable enough to induce him to "lose
time in beating up to it." On the same day Banks compared the
country to "the back of a lean cow, covered in general with long
hairs, but, nevertheless, where her scraggy hip bones have stuck
out further than they ought, accidental rubs and knocks have
entirely bared them of their share of covering." On the 28th they
tried to land in the yawl at some place near Wollongong, but they
were prevented by "the great surf which beat everywhere upon the
shore." Banks had to be content to "gaze upon, the products of
nature" in one of the most lovely and fertile regions of
Australia.</p>
<p>Next morning, the 29th of April, "the land appeared different,
barren, without wood." But "at daylight," writes Cook, "we
discovered a bay which appeared to be tolerably well sheltered from
all winds, into which I resolved to go with the ship." As they
approached the South Head, a small smoke rose from a very barren
and rocky place; and, directing their glasses that way, they saw
ten "Indians," who soon left the fire and "retired to a little
eminence, whence they could conveniently see the ship." Cook sent
the master in the pinnace to sound the entrance. Some of the
Indians followed; and, coming down to a cove a little within the
harbour, "invited our people to land by many signs and words." It
was observed, however, that they were "armed with long pikes and a
wooden weapon made like a short scimitar"&mdash;in <i>fact</i> it
was a throwing stick for the pike. Meanwhile other Indians remained
on the rocks opposite the ship. The bodies of some were painted
with broad white strokes, resembling a cross-belt, garters and
bracelets.</p>
<p>By noon the <i>Endeavour</i> was "within the mouth of the
inlet." Natives were seen on both heads of the bay. Under the South
Head were four small canoes, "the worst canoes," says Cook, "I ever
saw, made of one piece of bark, drawn or tied up at one end, with
the middle kept open by a stick." In each canoe was a man "who held
in his hand a long pole, with which he struck fish, venturing with
his little embarkation almost into the surf. These people seemed to
be totally engaged in what they were about; the ship passed within
a quarter of a mile of them, and yet they scarcely lifted their
eyes." At 2 p.m. the <i>Endeavour</i> anchored under the South
Shore, abreast of a small village of six or eight houses. An old
woman came in from the bush with some sticks. She looked at the
ship, but expressed neither surprise nor concern, and lit a fire.
The fishermen landed and dressed their dinner, totally unmoved by
the sight of the ship about half a mile away. The Englishmen also
dined, and then manned the boats. "But, as soon as we approached
the rocks, two of the men came down, each armed with a lance about
ten feet long, and a short stick, which he seemed to handle as if
it was a machine to throw the lance." They showed themselves
"resolved to dispute our landing to their utmost, though they were
but two, and we thirty or forty." A parley of a quarter of an hour
was fruitless. The Indians "remained resolute." Muskets with small
shots were fired, lances were thrown, and the two defenders of
Australia ran away. The Englishmen went to the "houses," threw
beads and ribbons to the children, and took away some forty or
fifty lances.</p>

<br>
Landing of Captain Cook at Botany Bay</p>
<p>Cook's chief wish was for water. He dug in the sand, and found a
little. He crossed to the North side, but found only some pools on
the rocks. He returned to his diggings in the South, "by which
means and a small stream they found fresh water sufficient to water
the ship." "A very fine stream" was afterwards found on the North
Shore "in the first sandy cove within the island, before which the
ship might lie almost land-locked, and wood for fuel might be got
everywhere."</p>
<p>On the 2nd of May a party of ten explored the South Shore, and
"walked," says Banks, "till we completely tired ourselves." The
country, he notes, "consists of either swamps or light sandy soil,"
and its products are gum trees, and "vast quantities of grass."
Cook's impressions were more favourable. The country, he says, was
"diversified with woods, lawns and marshes. The woods are free from
underwood of every kind, and the trees are at such a distance from
one another, that the whole country, or at least a great part of
it, might be cultivated without being obliged to cut down a single
tree. We found the soil everywhere, except in the marshes, to be of
a light white sand, and produceth a quantity of good grass, which
grows in little tufts about as big as one can hold in one's hand,
and pretty close to one another; in this manner the surface of the
ground is coated." James Cook, the farm-labourer's boy, knew far
more about agriculture than I do. But may I ask, is "light white
sand" particularly suitable for "cultivation"? In fact, no
cultivators have yet tried the experiment; and the "light white
sand" still remains unfurrowed and undug a few miles away from a
population of nearly a million. I understand, however, that there
are horses in the bush who agree with Cook that the grass which it
produceth is "good."</p>
<p>On the 4th of May, while Banks gave the day to drying his
"collection of plants, now grown immensely large," Cook went in the
pinnace "to the head of the bay; after which," he says, "we took
water and went almost to the head of the inlet." Here he landed and
travelled some distance inland. The country was as before, but
"much richer"; for "instead of sand," writes Cook, "I found in many
places a deep black soil, which we thought was capable of producing
any kind of grain. At present it produceth, besides timber, as fine
meadow as ever was seen; however, we found it not all like this,
some places were very rocky, but this I believe to be uncommon. The
stone is sandy and very proper for building."</p>
<p>Where was the meadow which Cook thought "as fine meadow as ever
was seen"? When, eighteen years later, colonists came to Botany
Bay, they looked everywhere for such a "meadow," and failed to find
it; and very angry they were with Cook for telling such a lie, or
for making such a mistake. But James Cook could no more tell a lie
than could George Washington. And he always described what he saw,
or thought he saw, in a very careful way. Captain Tench (in 1790)
thought that Cook's "fine meadow" was the bog at the mouth of our
Cook's River, up which Cook rowed to a point near Tempe railway
station. "These meadows," says Captain Tench, "instead of grass,
are covered with high coarse rushes growing in a rotten spongy bog
into which we were plunged knee-deep at every step." I used to
agree with Captain Tench that Cook had probably made the mistake of
thinking that a spongy bog was a fine meadow. But I think that Mr.
C. H. Bertie has shown this view to be wrong. In the first place it
is hard to believe that an observer like Cook could make such a
mistake. And, in the second place, other passages in Cook's journal
seem to show that, when he wrote "head of the bay," he meant that
part of the head you reach by rowing up the <i>South</i> Shore; and
that the inlet up which he rowed afterwards was our George's
River&mdash;though in truth, he rowed up that river, not "almost to
its head," but only about as far as Tom Ugly's Point, which he drew
very badly! We cannot say with certainty, exactly where the meadow
was. But I agree with Mr. Bertie that the best guess is that it was
the good soil near Sans Souci. It was up George's River that
Captain King, eighteen years later, noticed "an exceedingly fine
black mould, with some excellent timber trees, and very rich
grass." And it seems curious that Captain Tench did not guess that
"very rich grass" was more likely to be Cook's "meadow" than was a
"rotten spongy bog."</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 5th, Cook crossed to the North Shore,
and walked three or four miles towards the future site of Sydney.
"We met with nothing remarkable," he says; "great part of the
country, for some distance inland from the sea coast is mostly a
barren heath diversified with marshes and morasses." One may to-day
take Cook's afternoon walk, and still find "a barren heath
diversified with marshes and morasses," though a suburb is at last
on its fringe. It is a lovely bush walk, on the side of still
lovelier coastal scenery. But Cook was thinking, not of scenery,
but of commerce and colonies; and the Sydney side showed "nothing
remarkable."</p>
<p>What name shall we give to this bay, so "capacious, safe and
commodious?" Two things had seemed specially remarkable, the fish
and the wild-flowers. Shall we name it after its stingrays, or
after its botany? The stingrays seemed likely to win. The-seamen's
journals are full of praise of their number and of their size. But,
though Banks ate stingrays with reasonable appetite&mdash;"a
stingray," he says, "was not quite so good as a skate, nor was it
much inferior,"&mdash;he was far more excited about his collection
of plants, now grown so immensely large that it had become
necessary to take extraordinary care lest they should spoil in the
books. One day, he says, he "carried ashore all the drying paper,
nearly two hundred quires, of which the greater part was full, and
spreading them upon a sail in the sun, kept them in this manner
exposed the whole day, and sometimes turning the quires in which
there were plants inside out. By this means they came on board at
night in very good condition." They are still in very good
condition, in spite of a bad soaking in the Endeavour River, and
some of them are now in the Mitchell Library in Sydney, a few miles
from the spot where they were gathered a century and a half ago. No
wonder if Banks began to think them more worthy than a 336 lbs.
stingray to give name to the bay.</p>
<p>But the evening before Cook sailed, "the yawl"&mdash;so he tells
the story&mdash;"returned from fishing, having caught two stingrays
weighing near 600 lbs.," and they had a jolly good supper. The time
had come to name the bay, and after such a supper, what name could
be given but "Stingray Harbour? "And that name was given. "The
great quantity of this sort of fish found in this place," wrote
Cook in his journal, "occasioned my giving it the name of Stingray
Harbour." And whenever, in the course of his voyage up North, he
mentioned the bay, he always called it "Stingray Harbour."</p>
<p>But before the <i>Endeavour</i> reached Batavia, Cook decided to
change the name. If you look at the page of his journal which is
printed here, you will find that he drew his pen through "this sort
of fish" and "Stingray Harbour," and made such corrections that the
sentence became&mdash;"The great quantity of new plants, etc., Mr.
Banks and Dr. Solander collected occasioned my giving it the name
of <i>Botanist</i> (corrected to <i>Botany) Bay</i>."</p>

<br>
Facsimile of passage in Cook's Journal</p>
<p>Cook often changed the names he had given to places when better
names came into mind And, in this case we can easily imagine how
the change was made. Banks had spent his last day in the bay
collecting, not stingrays, but "specimens of as many things as we
possibly could, to be examined at sea." As, day by day, the plants
were examined, and as the botanists came to understand how "new"
and how wonderful they were, it seemed to them a shocking thing
that the bay should be named after a gigantic fish, eaten weeks
ago! "My dear Captain," said Mr. Banks, "the thing's absurd! You
should have named it <i>Botanist Bay</i>." "Well," answered the
Captain, "we had a very good supper, you know. You'll remember that
third helping! However, hand me the journal. <i>Botanist Bay</i>,
you said, I think. No? You think <i>Botany</i> sounds better? Well,
there now, the thing's done&mdash;<i>Botany Bay</i>!"</p>
<p>The week's visit to Botany Bay fixed the site of the first
British colony in the Pacific. In 1779 Banks was examined by a
committee of the House of Commons that had been appointed to
consider the question, what shall we do with our convicts? If it
was thought expedient to establish a colony of convicted felons in
a distant part whence escape would be difficult, and where, from
the fertility of the soil, they might be enabled to maintain
themselves after the first year with little or no help from
England, what place did Mr. Banks think best? His answer
was&mdash;"<i>Botany Bay</i>!" The seven months' voyage, he said,
would make escape very difficult. The natives were few and
cowardly. The climate was like that of the South of France. "The
proportion of rich soil was small in comparison to the barren, but
was sufficient to support a very large number of people." There
were no beasts of prey, and sheep and oxen would thrive. There was
fish in plenty. The grass was long and luxuriant. There were
eatable vegetables. The country was well supplied with water. There
was abundant timber for fuel and for buildings. The convicts would
need one years provisions, but "afterwards with a moderate portion
of industry might undoubtedly maintain themselves without
assistance from England." They would buy goods from England, and
send goods to England. Banks's testimony was the main cause of the
choice of Botany Bay as the site of the colony. And when the colony
was founded, and, after a time of desperate misery, began to
prosper, he said that be had always known that this would happen.
"The climate and soil," he wrote in 1797, "are in my opinion
superior to most that have been settled by Europeans. I have always
maintained that assertion, grounded on my own experience."</p>
<p>After reading these words, we turn with interest to Banks's
account of his week at Botany Bay, and expect to find some glowing
picture of the place which had impressed his mind so favourably. We
are disappointed and even amazed! Not one word is there to suggest
that, as he walked himself tired over the light sandy soil of the
South Shore, tramped the sandy moors of the North, or looked for
shells on Bare Island, he was dreaming of a British colony on "soil
superior to most that have been settled by Europeans." He had
described Tahiti as "an Arcadia." He had recommended the River
Thames in New Zealand as "the most proper place we have yet seen
for establishing a colony." But he has no such words of praise for
Botany Bay. Reading his journal, we get the impression that he
thought Botany Bay to be a very good place for botanists, and a
very bad place for colonists. And, if he thought that, he thought
right.</p>
<p>The curious thing is that, while Banks, the enthusiast, has no
word of praise for anything in Botany Bay except its botany, Cook,
the cautious, has praise for nearly everything. It is Cook who
describes the bay as "capacious, safe and commodious," and who
points to "the very fine stream" on the North Shore, in a place
where "a ship might lie almost land-locked." It is Cook who says
that the country might be cultivated without the cutting down of a
single tree. It is Cook who found at the head of the inlet "a deep
black soil capable of producing any kind of grain," and that did
produce "as fine meadow as ever was seen." It is Cook again who
notes that "the stone is sandy and very proper for building." In
short it is Cook who thought that Botany Bay would be a good place
for a settlement. One may guess that his conversation impressed his
friends, and among them Banks. Banks's recommendation of Botany Bay
as a place of settlement leaves me puzzled. But we may note, in
partial explanation, that, while it receives no support from his
own journal, it receives fairly good support from Cook's.</p>
<p>And Cook was wrong. Botany Bay is "capacious" enough, and seamen
say that it is "safe," though sometimes uncomfortable. But no one
since Cook has ever said that, for settlers, it is "commodious."
When, eighteen years later, Governor Phillip sailed into the bay
with his seven hundred convict colonists, he found that there was
no shelter from the East winds, and that the greater part was so
shoal that ships of even a moderate draught of water were obliged
to anchor with the entrance of the bay open, "exposed to a heavy
sea that rolls in when it blows hard from the
Eastward."<sup>*</sup> "I did not see any site," he wrote, "to
which there was not strong objection." The "very fine stream" on
the North Shore was observed, and La Perouse must have used it when
he anchored by that shore a week later. But to Phillip it seemed
that the least bad of all bad places was near Point Sutherland,
where there was a small run of good water, though in very
insufficient quantity, and in a place which the ships could not
approach. The "light sandy soil," that might so easily be
cultivated, still remains uncultivated. Angry colonists searched in
vain for "the fine meadows talked of in Cook's voyage." "I could
never see them," writes Surgeon White, "though I took some pains to
find them out; nor have I ever heard of a person that has seen any
part resembling them." In George's River, at the head of the bay,
"several good situations offered," wrote Phillip, "for a small
number of people, but none that appeared calculated for our
numbers," and "the swamps rendered the most eligible situation
unhealthy." It was true that there was plenty of good stone, but
the colonists were asking, not for stone, but for bread. Botany Bay
proved to be, as a London writer summed up the news, "picturesque
and pleasing to <i>philosophers</i>." It is, however, fair to
remember that Cook was not thinking of a colony of convicts, and
that he never promised that they would be able to maintain
themselves after one year without help from England.</p>
<p class="note">[* On the other hand, seamen say that it seldom
<i>does</i> blow from the Eastward.]</p>
<p>Cook sailed from Botany Bay at daylight on the 7th of May. At
noon they were two or three miles from land, and "abreast of a bay
wherein there appeared to be safe anchorage." Cook called the bay
"Port Jackson," in honour of a Secretary of the Admiralty whose
name had already been given to a bay in New Zealand. Banks does not
mention a bay, but he remarks that the coast "appeared broken and
likely for harbours." Eighteen years later Governor Phillip,
exploring the coast for some harbour less bad than Botany Bay, came
to Port Jackson, saw in a flash of an eye that it was "the finest
harbour in the world," and dumped his convicts down on the banks of
Sydney Cove, five miles from the heads. Cook, who sailed two or
three miles from land, could see only a little way into the
harbour, but his chart, says Admiral Wharton, "gives the shape of
what he could see very accurately."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Captain Bayldon writes:&mdash;"Cook saw
considerably more of the harbour than he is generally credited
with. His chart shows <i>all</i> that <i>could</i> be seen from
seaward; namely, North Harbour practically to Manly, the entrance
to Middle Harbour, and the main or southern harbour to a line drawn
from Inner South Head across to Chowder Head. He saw that it was a
fine enough harbour to name after one of his most influential
friends, Sir G. Jackson, who surely would not have been pleased had
he named only a small anchorage after him."]</p>
<p>Next day he saw "some broken land" that appeared to form a bay,
which he named "Broken Bay"&mdash;the splendid entrance to a river
which a famous visitor thought more beautiful than the
Rhine.<sup>*</sup> On the 11th Cook saw "a small round rock or
island lying close under the land"; it was Nobby Head at the
entrance to Newcastle Harbour. Next day he noted an inlet which he
named "Port Stephens," which appeared to him, as he looked from the
mast-head, to be sheltered from all winds. He described the land
Northward from Botany Bay as "diversified with an agreeable variety
of hills, ridges and valleys and large plains all clothed with
woods."</p>
<p class="note">[* On his <i>map</i>, says Captain Bayldon, Cook
wrote "Broken Bay" on the coast about Narrabeen; but this was one
of his few slips. His <i>words</i> show that what he saw was
<i>our</i> Broken Bay, the entrance to the Hawkesbury.]</p>
<p>On the 16th he saw a "wide open bay," which he named "Morton
Bay." Banks thought there must be a river at the back of it,
because the sea looked paler than usual; but Cook thought this
appearance was explained by the fine white sandy bottom. "Be this
as it may," he writes, "it was a point which could not be cleared
up, as we had the wind; but, should anyone be desirous of doing it
that may come after me, this place may always be found by three
hills which lay to the Northward of it";&mdash;he named them the
"Glass Houses." The land was sandy, and had no signs of fertility.
With these words Cook passed the bay into which flows the river on
which Brisbane stands. On the 23rd he anchored in "a large open
bay," where he found "room for a few ships to lay very secure, and
a small stream of fresh water." They killed a bustard, and named
the place "Bustard Bay." The country was visibly worse than Botany
Bay. Banks noticed some tropical plants, "sure mark that we were on
the point of leaving the Southern temperate zone." Some ants
noticed <i>him</i>, and bit more sharply than any he had felt in
Europe.</p>
<p>Northward from Bustard Bay, "the coast is encumbered with
shoals," and Cook kept outside them. Hence he passed Port Curtis
without observation. Among islands and reefs he groped into
"Thirsty Sound," so named "by reason we could find no fresh water."
The land was again bad; "no sign of fertility was to be seen."
After two days' stay, Cook sailed through a sea "so strewed with
dangers" that our modern chart-maker is amazed that he "managed to
keep his ship off the ground." He had sailed so close to the land
that he was not aware of the Great Barrier Reef, which now began to
near the coast.<sup>*</sup> At sunset on the 11th of June he saw
the first coral shoal. He decided "to stretch off all night, as
well to avoid the dangers we saw ahead, as to see if any islands
lay in the offing, especially as we now began to draw near the
Latitude of those discovered by Quiros, which some geographers, for
what reason I know not, have thought proper to tack to this land."
It was possible that he might see Austrialia of the Holy
Spirit&mdash;the New Hebrides.</p>
<p class="note">[* Modern sailing ships, making from Brisbane to
Torres Straits, sail <i>outside</i> the Barrier Reef. It is not
safe even now to <i>sail</i> the way Cook sailed. The modern
<i>steamer</i> takes a course <i>inside</i> the Barrier Reef that
has been carefully marked.]</p>
<p>It was a clear moonlight night, and he sailed with a fine breeze
of wind. The water deepened from twelve fathoms to twenty-one, and
then suddenly fell to twelve, ten, eight. Cook ordered all to their
stations, and prepared to anchor. But again they had twenty and
twenty-one fathoms, and continued in that depth until a few minutes
before 11 p.m., when they had seventeen;&mdash;and, before the man
at the lead could heave another cast, the ship struck. Banks,
thinking the danger past, had gone to bed in perfect security; but,
he writes, "scarcely were we warm in our beds when we were called
up with the alarming news of the ship being fast upon a rock, of
which she in a few minutes convinced us by beating very violently
against it. We were upon sunken coral rocks, the most dreadful of
all on account of their sharp points and grinding quality, which
cut through, the ship's bottom almost immediately."</p>
<p>Cook had, as usual, undressed and gone to bed; and he was
probably, as usual when in bed, sound asleep. But he "was upon deck
in his drawers as the second blow was struck, and gave his orders
with his wonted coolness and precision"&mdash;so Banks long
afterwards told the story to a famous statesman, the son of an old
school-mate. The ship had struck "about the top of high water" at
11 p.m. The hope was to get her off at the next high tide. They
threw overboard guns, ballast, casks, hoop-staves, decayed
stores&mdash;forty or fifty tons&mdash;but the ship was not afloat
by a foot or more. The tide again ebbed, and again rose, and the
leak gained upon the pumps. "It was," writes Cook in careful
language, "an alarming and terrible circumstance, and threatened
immediate destruction." Banks despaired of the ship, packed what
might possibly be saved, and prepared for the worst. The only hope
now was to haul on the anchors. Yet, if the ship were got off the
rocks, the leak would be still bigger, and the end would come at
once. The land could be seen eighteen or twenty-one miles away. But
"we well knew," writes Banks, "that our boats were not capable of
carrying us all ashore, so that some, probably most of us, must be
drowned; a better fate, may be, than those would have who should
get ashore without arms to defend themselves from the Indians, or
provide themselves with food, in a country where we had not the
least reason to hope for subsistence, so barren had we always found
it; and, had they even met with good usage from the natives and
food to support them, debarred from the hope of ever seeing again
their native country, or conversing with any but savages, perhaps
the most uncivilised in the world."</p>
<p>But the danger had to be faced. The capstan and windlass were
manned, and they began to heave. At 10 p.m. she floated, and was
hauled into deep water. To their delight and amazement she leaked
no worse than before. By some miracle the desperate peril had
passed. The miracle was explained a little later. But for the
present we should note that the escape was due, not merely to
miracle, but also to character. "In justice to the ship's company,"
wrote Cook, "I must say that no men ever behaved better than they
had done on this occasion; animated by the behaviour of every
gentleman on board, every man seemed to have a just sense of the
danger we were in, and exerted himself to the utmost." Banks, who
had worked with the rest for twenty-four hours till he was "much
fatigued," writes in livelier language:&mdash;"The seamen worked
with surprising cheerfulness and alacrity; no grumbling or growling
was to be heard throughout the ship, not even an oath, though the
ship was in general as well furnished with them as most in His
Majesty's service." Their conduct seemed to Banks, not only
admirable, but also somewhat surprising; for, "as soon as a ship is
in desperate situation," the seamen, so he had always heard,
"commonly begin to plunder and refuse all command." He thought
their virtue on this occasion was due to "the cool and steady
conduct of the officers, who, during the whole time, never gave an
order that did not show them to be perfectly composed and unmoved
by the circumstances, however dreadful they might appear." Both
officers and gentlemen proved themselves heroes. But let us not
miss this opportunity to do justice to the seamen of the
<i>Endeavour</i>. They were not wholly heroes. They got drunk
whenever they could get drink. They had "tapped" every cask of wine
on board, says Banks. They grumbled, and growled and swore. Yet
they were at least able to see something heroic in the man who
ruled them, and to strive bravely and faithfully in face of
appalling danger.</p>
<p>The leak, though less, still gave anxiety, and it was decided to
"fother" the ship. Cook gave the job to Midshipman Monkhouse, who
had seen the thing done. Banks describes it in detail. A large
quantity of finely chopped oakum and wool was loosely stitched to a
sail, which was sunk under the ship. The hope was that the oakum
and wool would be sucked into the leak, and would close it. The
experiment was entirely successful. "In about a quarter of an hour,
to our great surprise, the ship was pumped dry, and, upon letting
the pumps stand, she was found to make very little water."</p>
<p>The boats were sent to look for a harbour, and returned with
good news. They had found the mouth of a river, the entrance of
which "was, to be sure, narrow enough and shallow, but, when once
in, the ship might be moved afloat so near the shore that, by a
stage from her to it, all the cargo might be got out and in again
in a short time." Entangled among shoals, Cook cautiously groped
towards the opening. Twice in the narrow channel the ship ran
ashore. But "by the evening she was moored within twenty feet of
the shore, and before night much lumber was taken out of her."</p>
<p>On the 22nd of June, at the place where Cooktown now stands, the
<i>Endeavour</i> was beached and examined. It was found that the
hole was large enough "to have sunk a ship with twice our pumps.
The coral rock had cut through the plank, and deep into one of the
timbers, smoothing the gashes before it, so that the whole might
easily be imagined to have been cut with an axe." Then the rock had
broken off, and had plugged the hole with a stone as big as a man's
fist. Hence the miracle that the ship, when hauled off, had not
sunk. The sheathing had been torn off, which Cook feared, would
"let the worm into her bottom and be of bad consequence." But no
thorough repair, no thorough examination even, could now be made.
Cook did his best to believe the assurances of the master and the
carpenter that no very serious damage had been done. He had to sail
his ship to Batavia "through an unknown and perhaps dangerous sea,"
and he could only hope that she would get there. What repairs were
possible were finished by the 26th of June. But they failed to get
the ship afloat till the 4th of July; and persistent South-East
winds prevented sailing till the 6th of August.</p>
<p>It was a happy month for Banks. He and Solander were already
ashore "plant gathering," while the <i>Endeavour</i> was blundering
up the channel, and they enjoyed every hour. It was a time of
zoological romance. A seaman told Banks that he had seen "an animal
about the size of, and much like, a one-gallon cagg. It was," says
he, "as black as the devil, and had wings; indeed I took it for the
devil, or I might easily have catched it, for it crawled through
the grass." In the end Banks concluded that the crawling devil was
a large bat; it was what <i>we</i> call a flying fox.</p>
<p>But greatest excitement was caused by news of "an animal as
large as a greyhound, of a mouse colour, and very swift." Banks
himself got an imperfect view of the strange monster&mdash;"he was
not only like a greyhound in size and running, but had a tail as
long as any greyhound's; what to liken him to I could not tell;
nothing that I have seen at all resembles him." Later, the monsters
were chased by Banks's dog; "but they beat him, owing to the length
and thickness of the grass, which prevented him from running, while
they, at every bound leapt over the tops of it. We observed, much
to our surprise, that instead of going on all fours, the animal
went only upon two legs, making vast bounds." At last Lieutenant
Gore, "had the good fortune to kill the animal which had so long
been the subject of our speculation. To compare it to any European
animal would be impossible, as it had not the least resemblance to
any one I have seen." Next day they ate it for dinner, and it
proved "excellent meat." Later they spent a day "hunting the wild
animal," and killed "a very large one, weighing eighty-four
pounds."</p>

<br>
The <i>Endeavour</i> in Endeavour River</p>
<p>Banks saw many other remarkable things. The nests of white ants
reminded him of Druidical monuments. The pinnace brought back
cockles so large that one of them contained twenty pounds of meat,
more than two men could eat. The coxswain, who was a little man,
said that he had seen a shell so large that he had been able to get
inside it. Cocoa-nuts were picked up crested with
barnacles;&mdash;"a sure sign that they have come by sea," probably
from the land discovered by Quiros&mdash;our New Hebrides. How far
that land lay to Eastward Cook thought it hard to say. But at all
events he had, so he claimed made it "morally certain" that Quiros
"never was upon any portion of this coast." He did not know that,
the year before, Bougainville had made the same thing absolutely
certain by sailing from the land of Quiros to the reefs off New
Holland.</p>
<p>One day Banks and Lieutenant Gore walked a good way up the
river, and Banks made the most favourable remark that he ever made
about any part of Australia. The country, he said, was "generally
low, thickly covered with long grass, and seemed to promise great
fertility, were the people to plant and improve it." They camped
for the night on the banks of the river, and made a fire; but the
mosquitoes "followed us into the very smoke, nay almost into the
fire, which, hot as the climate was, we could better bear the heat
of than their intolerable stings." Next day they hunted "the
animal," and camped at night on a broad sand-bank, lying on
plaintain leaves under the shade of a bush. The mosquitoes did not
trouble, and the weary were at rest&mdash;"all of us slept almost
without intermission." They returned to the ship next day, shooting
some ducks, and observing a seven-foot alligator crawl from the
mangroves into the water.</p>
<p>It was in the Endeavour River that the Englishmen made their
only successful attempt to become acquainted with the natives. At
Botany Bay these had remained sullenly hostile. At Bustard Bay and
Thirsty Sound none had been seen. But at Endeavour River a very
precarious friendship was established. For, though the natives
showed no interest in the Englishmen's toys, they showed a very
deep interest in the turtles which the Englishmen caught on the
reef. They came on board ship and asked for one, and when their
request was refused&mdash;it was their reef, and therefore it was
their turtle&mdash;they began to haul it away. And, when the unjust
Englishmen took it from them, they started a bush-fire, which all
but consumed Banks's tent. "I had little idea;" he writes, "of the
fury with which the grass burnt in this hot climate, nor of the
difficulty of extinguishing it, when once alighted."</p>
<p>The men of science were anxious to see if the natives of the
East resembled the natives of the West, who had been described by
Dampier, in general "a faithful relater." "They are," Dampier had
written, "of a very unpleasing aspect, having no one graceful
feature in their faces. Their hair is short and curled like that of
the negroes, and not long and lank like the common Indians. The
colour of their skins is coal-black, like that of the negroes of
Guinea." And he had mentioned that "the two fore-teeth of their
upper jaw are wanting in all of them." Banks noticed that the
appearance of the Eastern natives was different. They did not want
front teeth. Their hair was lank, and neither woolly nor frizzled.
Their outside appeared the colour of wood-soot; but, as they were
covered with eternal filth, the native colour of the subterranean
skin was hard to tell. Banks, with his usual scientific
thoroughness, spat on his finger, and tried to penetrate the crust.
As he worked deeper, the colour altered very little, but perhaps
was nearer chocolate than coal-black. They had holes through their
noses, with "sprit-sail yards rigged across," said the sailors.
Still they were very much pleasanter to look at than had been the
inhuman creatures whom Dampier had seen in the West. Cook thought
their features "far from being disagreeable," and their voices
"soft and tunable."</p>
<p>They lived, however, like Dampier's Westerners. "They seem,"
writes Cook, "to have no fixed habitation, but move about from
place to place, like wild beasts in search of food. We never saw
one inch of cultivated ground in the whole country. Their houses
are mean small hovels, not much bigger than an oven. They have not
the least knowledge of iron or any other metal; their working tools
must be of stone, bone and shell." Their darts, however, could be
hurled by throwing-sticks to a distance of forty or fifty yards
with almost, if not quite, as good an aim as an English musket. It
was Cook's duty, as an eighteenth-century philosopher, to add that,
though the natives of New Holland were apparently the most wretched
people on the earth, they were "in reality far more happier than we
Europeans, being wholly unacquainted with the necessary
conveniences so much sought after in Europe; they are happy in not
knowing the use of them." Banks expressed the same opinion; but, as
we have seen, he had no wish to stay in New Holland to learn the
happiness of the simple life.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Cook had been tied to the ship, anxiously supervising
repairs, and sending out boats to seek a channel among baffling
shoals and reefs. He never found time even to go to the head of the
harbour. He climbed the hills, however, and saw "a melancholy
prospect of the difficulties we are to encounter; for, in whatever
direction we looked, it was covered with shoals as far as the eye
could see." At last, on the 6th of August, he put to sea to face
one of the most dangerous tasks that has ever been faced by seamen.
He knew that the ship was in a bad state, though happily he did not
know how very bad its state was. He had provisions only for three
months, at short allowance. He had to race against time through a
sea of which he had no knowledge save that, in the very face of
him, it bristled with difficulties and dangers. If ever Cook in
later years had bad dreams&mdash;though I do not believe he
had&mdash;they were probably founded on his experience between
Endeavour River and Cape York. The voyage was a nightmare in
navigation. Probably Cook did not dream about it; but he described
it, in words that were as true as they were simple, as "the most
dangerous navigation that perhaps ever ship was in."</p>
<p>Sending the pinnace ahead to sound, Cook kept a lookout from the
mast-head. He could see no passage;&mdash;nothing but breakers
extending endlessly to sea. He made a little way Northward; but his
hopes were disappointed by more reefs and breakers, "in a manner
all round us"; and in hot bad temper he called one deceiving
headland "Cape Flattery." Landing on an island, he climbed a high
hill, whence he saw a reef of rocks, two miles away, extending out
of sight, on which the sea broke very high. It was the outer edge
of the Great Barrier Reef. He saw several breaks in the reef, and
he determined to sail through one of them into the open sea. "By
keeping in with the main land we should be in continual danger,
besides the risk we should run in being locked in with reefs and
shoals." So he sailed through the passage in the Barrier Reef that
is now known by his name, and "found a large sea rolling in from
the South-East," which gave him "no small joy." Ever since the 26th
of May he had been "entangled amongst islands and shoals." He had
"sailed above three hundred and sixty leagues (a thousand and
eighty miles) by the lead, without ever having a leadsman out of
the chains when the ship was under sail; a circumstance that
perhaps never happened to any ship before, and yet it was here
absolutely necessary."</p>
<p>Cook now sailed outside the Barrier Reef. But the course was
unsatisfactory. He was missing the chance of surveying an unknown
coast. He was also afraid of "overshooting the passage (between New
Holland and New Guinea), supposing there to be one"; and he "firmly
believed" there was one. And he now found that the dangers of the
outside course were even greater than those of the inside. The
"large hollow sea" proved that the ship had been more damaged than
had been thought, and one pump had to be kept constantly at work.
The trade wind blew them towards the reef, and they studied its
formation with an interest that was keener than that of simple
curiosity, and made Banks write an admirable description. "A reef
such as one speaks of is scarcely known in Europe. It is a wall of
coral rock, rising almost perpendicularly out of the unfathomable
ocean, always overflown at high water, generally seven or eight
feet, and dry in places at low water. The large waves of the vast
ocean, meeting with so sudden a resistance, make a terrible surf
breaking mountains high, especially where the general trade wind
blows directly upon it." The tide dragged them within eighty or a
hundred yards of the breakers. "The same sea that washed the side
of the ship rose in a breaker prodigiously high the very next time
it did rise; so that between us and destruction was only a dismal
valley, the breadth of one wave, and even now no bottom could be
felt with one hundred and twenty fathoms." Shipwreck seemed
inevitable. Land was thirty miles away, and the boats could not
possibly carry the crew. "All the dangers we had escaped were
little in comparison of being thrown upon this reef, where the ship
must be dashed to pieces in a moment."</p>
<p>Cook made for a small opening in the reef, not wider than the
length of the ship. They reached it&mdash;just too late, "the tide
of ebb rushing out like a mill-stream, so that it was impossible to
get in." The boats, with the help of the tide, pulled them one and
a half miles away; but the returning tide would certainly bear them
back on the reef. Cook made for another opening, a quarter of a
mile broad. "Narrow and dangerous as it was, it seemed to be the
only means of saving her, as well as ourselves. A light breeze soon
sprang up at East-North-East, with which, and the help of our
boats, and a flood tide we soon entered the opening, and were
hurried through in a short time by a rapid tide like a mill-race."
Once more the faulty men of the <i>Endeavour</i> had shown ability
to grasp fortune. "In this truly terrible situation," says Cook,
"not one man ceased to do his utmost, and that with as much
calmness as if no danger had been near." They could not have been
calmer than the men of science. When the danger was at its height,
they were taking an observation to obtain the Longitude. "These
observations," records Mr. Green, "were very good. We were about a
hundred yards from the reef, where we expected the ship to strike
every minute, it being calm, no soundings, and the swell heaving us
right on."</p>
<p>Cook had leapt from the frying-pan into the fire, and was now
glad that a second leap had brought him back into nothing hotter
than the frying-pan. He was again encompassed on every side by
islands and shoals; "but so much does a greater danger swallow
lesser ones that those once dreaded spots were now looked upon with
less concern." Moreover he was determined to clear up once for all
the ancient uncertainty whether or not a strait existed between New
Holland and New Guinea. In this determination he was facing a great
risk. If there proved to be not a strait but a bay, he would have
to fight out, as Bougainville had fought out, against the trade
wind, and in most dangerous seas. But he had been convinced, by
Dalrymple's map, and by Banks's explanations, that it was very
probable there was a strait, and he had come "to the fixed
resolution" to bring home exact news of it.</p>
<p>It is hard to trace his progress among shoals and islands "by a
route that no one has again followed," with a boat all the time
ahead signalling shallow water. On the 22nd of August they observed
that "the main looked very narrow; so we began," says Banks, "to
look out for the passage we expected to find between New Holland
and New Guinea. At noon one was seen, very narrow, but appearing to
widen." Cook named the Northern Promontory "York Cape, in honour of
his late Royal Highness."</p>
<p>Ahead they saw islands, detached by narrow channels from the
mainland. Cook sent the boats to sound the channel next to the
main. Shoals and rocks were discovered, and he signalled the boats
to lead through the next channel to the Northward. The ship
followed, and Cook satisfied himself that he "had at last found out
a passage into the Indian Seas." He had now completed his survey of
the Eastern coast of New Holland from Latitude 38&deg;; a coast which
he was confident had "never been seen or visited by any European
before us." He landed on an island which he named Possession
Island; and, "a little before sunset, took possession of the
country in his Majesty's name, and fired 3 volleys of small arms on
the occasion, which was answered from the ship." With the pinnace
feeling the way before her, the <i>Endeavour</i> sailed through the
strait to which Cook gave the ship's name, passing safely over the
great bank which nearly bars its Western end, and has caused it to
be disused in favour of the "deep though narrow channel" North of
Prince of Wales Island. He landed on Booby Island, "now the great
landmark for ships making Torres Strait from the West." A swell
from the South-West, "together with other concurring circumstances,
left me no room to doubt but we had got to the Westward of
Carpentaria, or the Northern extremity of New Holland, and had now
an open sea to the Westward; which gave me no small satisfaction,
not only because the dangers and fatigues of the voyage were
drawing to an end, but by being able to prove that New Holland and
New Guinea are two separate lands or islands, which until this day
hath been a doubtful point with geographers. As I believe it was
known before, I claim no other merit than the clearing up of a
doubtful point." That is to say, Cook had been told by Banks that a
long-forgotten Spanish writer had said that Torres had sailed to
the South of New Guinea; and he had now proved that this was
possible. He had sailed through one channel, and he believed that a
better channel would some day be discovered among the islands he
could see to the North, "if ever it became an object to be looked
for."</p>
<p>In his log, written from day to day, Cook said that "possession
was taken of the country"; no name is mentioned. Banks in his
journal, described the country he was leaving under the headline:
"Some account of New Holland";&mdash;evidence again that no new
<i>name</i> had been given. In the copy of Cook's journal which he
sent home from Batavia the country is named "New Wales"; which
seems to show that that name was given in the course of the voyage
from Cape York to Batavia. In Cook's journal itself, the country is
twice named "New Wales." But, in one instance, the words are
crossed out, and "New South Wales" is written in their place.
Probably Cook made the correction during the voyage from Batavia to
England. In the other instance, he did not notice the words "New
Wales," and they stand uncorrected. In two copies that were
probably written on the voyage from Batavia to England, the name is
<i>New South Wales</i>. And Banks, probably at the same date,
corrected his headline as follows:&mdash;"Some account of that part
of New Holland now called <i>New South Wales</i>." We do not know
why Cook gave the name of "New Wales," nor why he changed that name
to "New South Wales."</p>
<p>Both Cook and Banks wrote long descriptions of the land which
they had coasted for two thousand miles.</p>
<p>Banks's description was in the highest degree unfavourable. We
cannot rightly be angry with him, for he wrote an accurate
description of what he saw. But we may regret that our candid
friend did not see some of the more pleasing aspects of the country
which he was to recommend nine years later as the best possible
place for a British settlement. One would imagine, as one reads his
journal, that his main purpose was to make quite sure that no
Englishman would ever think of settling in Australia.</p>
<p>"In the whole length of the coast which we sailed along there
was a very unusual sameness to be observed in the face of the
country. Barren it may justly be called, and in a very high degree,
at least as far as we saw. The soil in general is sandy and very
light; on it grows grass tall enough, but thin set, and trees of a
tolerable size, never however near together, being in general
forty, fifty or sixty feet apart. This and spots of loose sand,
sometimes very large, constitute the general face of the country,
as you sail along it, and, indeed, the greater part even after
penetrating inland as far as our situation would allow us to do.
The banks of the bays were generally clothed with thick mangroves,
sometimes for a mile or more in breadth. The soil under these is
rank, and always overflowed every spring tide. Inland you sometimes
meet with a bog, upon which the grass grows rank and thick, so that
no doubt the soil is sufficiently fertile. The valleys also between
the hills, where runs of water come down, are thickly clothed with
underwood; but they are generally very steep and narrow, so that
upon the whole, the fertile soil bears no kind of proportion to
that which seems by nature doomed to everlasting barrenness. Water
is a scarce article, or at least was so when we were there (April
to August), which I believe to have been the very height of the dry
season. At some places we saw not a drop. This drought is probably
owing to the dryness of a soil entirely composed of sand in which
high hills are scarce.</p>
<p>"A soil so barren, and at the same time entirely void of the
help derived from cultivation, could not be supposed to yield much
to the support of man. We had been so long at sea, with but a
scanty supply of fresh provisions, that we had long been used to
eat everything we could lay our hands upon, fish, flesh, or
vegetables, if only they were not poisonous, yet we could only now
and then procure a dish of bad greens for our own table, and never,
except in the place where the ship was careened, did we meet with
sufficient quantity to supply the ship"; and Banks gives a list of
the "bad greens" they had managed to eat. They had found no eatable
fruits, save in the South a cherry with nothing but a slightly acid
taste to recommend it, and in the North "a very indifferent fig."
They tried some palm nuts, but were "deterred from a second
experiment by a hearty fit of vomiting." The hogs ate the nuts with
good appetite, and the men envied the hogs their powers of
digestion; but two hogs died, and the rest were saved only by
careful nursing. The only useful plants were the gum tree, and a
bulrush which gave a resin of a bright yellow. In view of the
barrenness of the soil, the variety of the plants seemed wonderful,
but they were as useless as they were varied. Even the timber was
so hard, that the carpenter who cut firewood complained that his
tools were damaged.</p>
<p>As to fish, flesh and fowl, voyagers sick of sea-fare could eat
with joy anything that was not salt and that was not poisonous. "A
hawk or a crow was to us as delicate, and perhaps a better relished
meal than a partridge or a pheasant to those who had plenty of
dainties." But "kangooroos" were scarce, and birds were shy. "A
crow in England, though in general sufficiently wary, is, I must
say, a fool to a New Holland crow; and the same may be said of
almost all, if not all the birds of the country." And, making an
effort to say all that could be said for the country, he concludes
as follows:&mdash;"Upon the whole, New Holland, though in every
respect the most barren country I have seen, is not so bad but
that, between the production of sea and land, a company who had the
misfortune to be shipwrecked upon it might support themselves even
by the resources that we have seen; undoubtedly a longer stay and a
visit to different parts would discover many more."</p>
<p>That was the best that Mr. Banks could say in favour of our
country. He made no suggestion that colonists would do well to
settle in New South Wales; the nearest he got to that suggestion
was in the remark, that "were any man to settle here," he would
find the study of ants uncommonly interesting&mdash;industrious as
they are, their courage, if possible, excels their industry."</p>
<p>On the other hand, Cook's description shows that, in his
opinion, New South Wales might in time prove to be a good place for
British colonists. He states plainly, it is true, that "the land
naturally produced hardly anything fit for man to eat," that "the
natives know nothing of agriculture," and that "the country itself,
so far as we know, doth not produce any one thing that can become
an article in trade to invite Englishmen to fix a settlement upon
it." However, he continues, "this Eastern side is not that barren
and undesirable country that Dampier and others have described the
Western side to be. We are to consider that we see this country in
the pure state of nature; the industry of man has had nothing to do
with any part of it, and yet we find all such things as nature has
bestowed upon it in a flourishing state. In this extensive country,
it can never be doubted but what most sorts of grain, fruit, roots,
etc., of every kind would flourish here were they once brought
hither, planted and cultivated by the hands of industry, and here
are provender for more cattle at all seasons of the year than ever
can be brought into the country." It is "indifferently well
watered, even in the dry seasons, with small brooks and springs,
but no great rivers, unless it be the wet season." The soil, though
sandy, is "indifferently fertile, and clothed with woods, long
grass, shrubs, plants, etc." The coast North of 25&deg; "abounds with a
great number of fine bays and harbours, sheltered from all
winds."</p>
<p>It was not Cook's way to write with enthusiasm. He said enough
to show that he thought the soil of New South Wales would probably
do "indifferently well" if "planted and cultivated by the hands of
industry." And when he wrote "hands of industry," he meant, not
hands of convicts, but hands of ironside farmers from Scotland or
Yorkshire.</p>
<p>The voyage of discovery was finished. "On the West side," wrote
Cook, "I can make no new discovery, the honour of which belongs to
the Dutch navigators." He was henceforth in seas that had been
charted by predecessors. He tried the coast of New Guinea, but,
like, Torres, was driven off by everlasting shoals, after "one of
the most fortunate escapes we have ever had from shipwreck." They
managed, however, to land on a part of the coast that is "scarcely
known to this day." They tried to climb some cocoa-nut trees, but
failed to do so. Cook, with remarkable humanity, refused to cut
down the trees, because that would certainly have led to an attack
by the natives, and to undeserved slaughter.</p>
<p>He determined to leave the New Guinea coast, and make for
Batavia. Banks, who never could get enough of travel and adventure,
complains that nearly everybody was homesick. No one in the ship,
he says, was free from this contemptible disease, except the
Captain, Dr. Solander and himself; "and we three," he explains,
"have ample employment for our minds."</p>
<p>It was true, indeed, that the sailors, if not very homesick,
were, at all events, very hungry for roast beef. And anyone but
Cook and Banks would have forgiven them, when he remembered that
for two years and a half&mdash;apart from the good things at
Tahiti&mdash;they had lived mainly on ancient salt junk, and on
biscuits so full of crawling things that they tasted like mustard.
They wanted to land at Timor, to get at least a good dinner or two.
But the Dutch had a strong fort there, and regarded every foreigner
with a jealous eye. So Cook sailed on, and the sailors said
something that has not been recorded. But when they came by chance
to the little Dutch island of Savu, and saw "a flock of cattle
grazing," the demand for roast beef could not be resisted. The
Dutch allowed Cook to buy buffaloes&mdash;at an extortionate price.
But they complained that the English were far too inquisitive about
spices. And, indeed, Parkinson the draughtsman afterwards boasted
that he had taken nutmegs and cloves ashore, and had found that the
people were acquainted with them.</p>
<p>On the 4th of October Cook was off Java, and got the news of the
day, or rather of the year, from a Dutch ship. It was that "the
Government in England was in the utmost disorder, the people crying
up and down the streets: 'Down with King George! King Wilkes for
ever!'" that "the Americans had refused to pay taxes of any kind,
and an English army had been sent to deal with the rebellion." He
anchored at Batavia on the 11th of October.</p>
<p>It was evident that the <i>Endeavour</i> could not go on without
thorough examination and thorough repair. Cook found, to his great
annoyance, that it would be necessary to place her in the hands of
Dutch shipwrights. The ship was shown to be in a condition far
worse than had been supposed. "In one place two and a half planks
near six feet long were within <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch of
being cut through; and here the worms had made their way quite
through the timbers, so that it was a matter of surprise to
everyone who saw her bottom, how we had kept her above water; and
yet in this condition we had sailed some hundreds of leagues in as
dangerous a navigation as in any part of the world, happy in being
ignorant of the continual danger we were in." In the end Cook gave
the Dutch shipwrights a very handsome testimony:&mdash;"I do not
believe there is a marine yard in the world where work is done with
more alertness than here, and where there are better conveniences
for heaving ships down in point of safety and despatch." The Dutch
methods were different from the English, and better.</p>
<p>From Batavia Cook sent home in a Dutch ship the <i>copy</i> of
his journal which you may see to-day, if you like, in the
Australian Museum, Sydney. He also wrote a letter that is of great
interest, because it gives his own impressions of one of the most
famous, most dangerous and most fruitful voyages of British
History. "Although," he wrote, "the discoveries made in the voyage
are not great, yet I flatter myself they are such as may merit the
attention of their Lordships, and although I have failed in
discovering the much-talked of Southern Continent (which perhaps
does not exist), and which I myself had very much at heart, yet I
am confident that no part of the failure of such discovery can be
laid to my charge. Had we been so fortunate not to have run ashore,
much more would have been done in the latter part of the voyage
than what was, but, as it is, I presume this voyage will be found
as complete as any before made to the South Seas on the same
account."</p>
<p>Cook stayed in Batavia from the 11th of October to the 26th of
December. It was a dreadful time. When the Englishmen arrived, they
were, thanks to Cook's system of sour krout and bathing, in
insolent good health. Not one man had been lost by sickness
incurred on shipboard during the whole voyage.<sup>*</sup> There
was not one sick man on board. The sailors, rosy and plump, "jeered
and flaunted much" at the white-faced Dutch who came alongside.
They were warned of the extreme unwholesomeness of the place. But
they laughed, thinking themselves well-seasoned to any climate, and
"trusting more than all," writes Banks, "to an invariable
temperance in everything, which we had unalteredly kept during our
whole residence in the warm latitudes";&mdash;a statement which is,
no doubt, true in some sense, but which nevertheless surprises
readers who remember the events of Christmas Days, and of other
days. But in Batavia trust in "invariable temperance" was
misplaced. Everyone fell sick. The only exception was the
sailmaker, an old man of seventy or eighty&mdash;ages were vague in
those days&mdash;who had been invariably
intemperate:&mdash;"generally more or less drunk every day."
Surgeon Monkhouse died. Tupia died:&mdash;"a shrewd, sensible,
ingenious man," says Cook, "but proud and obstinate, which often
made his situation on board both disagreeable to himself and to
those about him." Banks was "seized with a fever, the fits of
which," he says, "were so violent as to deprive me entirely of my
senses, and leave me so weak as scarcely to be able to crawl
downstairs." His servants were as bad as himself, and Solander
became ill for the first time in his life. The two sick botanists
bought a Malay woman apiece, "hoping that the tenderness of the sex
would prevail even here, which, indeed we found it to do." In
charge of their nurses, they went to a country-house, and gradually
recovered strength. But, when the ship sailed, seven had died,
forty or more were sick, and the rest were weakly. Cook said that
Batavia was the unhealthiest place upon the globe. "We came in here
with as healthy a ship's crew as need go to sea, and, after a stay
of not quite three months, left it in the condition of a hospital
ship; and yet all the Dutch captains said we have been very
lucky."</p>
<p class="note">[* Sutherland, who died at Botany Bay, "died of a
consumption."]</p>
<p>Banks had not been too ill to use his eyes and to take notes.
The country reminded him of the flatness of his native
Lincolnshire. The canals made carriage very cheap, but also made
the air very unwholesome. He writes high praise of the fertility
and wealth of Java. He describes the Dutch management of the spice
business. Nutmegs, for example, have been extirpated in all the
islands except Banda, "which easily supplies the world, and would
easily supply another, if the Dutch had another to supply." He
understood, however, that there were spices on islands away to the
East, which the Dutch had not examined. In a curious and not very
pleasing passage, he discusses the chance of capturing Batavia, and
decides that it is a very good one. The defences are weak; and, of
every hundred soldiers who arrive, at the end of the year fifty are
dead, twenty-five in the hospital, and not ten in perfect health.
Banks evidently thought, as Bougainville had thought two years
before, that it would be well to claim a share in the spice trade,
in the teeth, which were not very sound teeth, of the Dutch dog in
the manger.</p>
<p>The <i>Endeavour</i> sailed from Batavia on the 26th of December
in good repair, though "in the condition of a hospital ship." But
they were out at sea again, and there was no expectation of
tragedy. But the disease was in them, and broken health grew worse.
Disasters came fast, and Cook's journal for this passage is mainly
a list of those who died. Corporal Trusslove died, "a man much
esteemed by everybody on board"; then Mr. Sporing, "a gentleman
belonging to Mr. Banks's retinue"; Mr. Sydney Parkinson, Natural
History painter to Mr. Banks, who left, in addition to his
pictures, an interesting journal; Mr. Green, the very skilful,
industrious, and courageous observer, who had taken a successful
observation when a hundred yards distant from almost inevitable
destruction on the coral reef, but who had "lived in such a manner
as greatly promoted the disorders he had had long upon him";
Midshipman Monkhouse, who had "fothered" the ship; John Ravenhill,
the aged and much-drinking sailmaker, who perhaps had not been
permitted to be so invariably intemperate on ship as he had been on
land. Twenty-three in all died; and those who did not die were
hardly able to tend the sails, and to nurse the sick. Banks, who
had "endured the pains of the damned almost," was the only stricken
man who recovered.</p>
<p>At last the South-East trade-wind brought relief. They came to
Capetown in March 1771, and stayed a month. The Australian, whose
feelings have been a little hurt by Banks's statement that his
country is in every respect the most barren country he had ever
seen, is pleased to find that he thought South Africa more barren
still. "The infinite and, to an European, almost inconceivable
barrenness of the country," he wrote, "makes it necessary that
people should spread themselves very widely"; and Cook wrote
plainly that no country seen this voyage&mdash;not even New
Holland!&mdash;"afforded so barren a prospect as this, and not only
so in appearance, but in reality." The true importance of the Cape,
it was rightly observed, was as the half-way house between Europe
and Asia; "the whole town may be considered as one great inn fitted
up for the reception of all comers and goers." Banks, as always,
has interesting things to say about the ladies. "In general," he
wrote, "they are handsome, and when married (no reflection upon my
countrywomen), are the best housekeepers imaginable, and great
child-bearers. Had I been inclined for a wife, I think this is the
place of all others I have seen where I could have best suited
myself." The fact, however, is that, when Banks was inclined for a
wife, he suited himself in England.</p>
<p>They reached St. Helena on the 1st of May, and stayed until the
5th. Cook was nearing home. On the 18th of June he got late
political news from New England schooners cruising for whales. King
George had behaved very ill for some time, but the colonists had
brought him to terms at last. Disputes were at an end; "and to
confirm this, the Master said that the coat on his back was made in
Old England." On the 13th of July Cook anchored in the Downs. "I
flatter myself," he wrote to the Admiralty, "that the discoveries
we have made, though not great, will apologize for the length of
the voyage." Their Lordships replied that they extremely well
approved of the whole of Cook's proceedings. Cook had an hour's
talk with the King, who was pleased to express his approbation. The
Royal Society also was gratified. Cook had been well worth his
hundred and twenty guineas, and the grant of four thousand pounds
had proved more than was needed. The Society generously voted that
the balance should be expended on a bust:&mdash;a bust not, of
course, of Cook, but of George.</p>
<p>"I have made no great discoveries," Cook repeats in a letter to
his old employer, Mr. Walker, of Whitby, "yet I have explored more
of the South Sea than all that have gone before me; in so much that
little remains now to be done to have a thorough knowledge of that
part of the globe." There is a curiously apologetic tone in all
Cook's estimates of the value of his discoveries. He had to meet
the accusations of geographers, like Dalrymple, that he had not
discovered the Southern Continent. And he can only modestly suggest
in self-defence that one reason of his failure is that the
continent does not exist. But Banks, at all events, had no need to
apologize. Geographical discoveries might not be satisfactory to
geographers. But botanical discoveries had far surpassed the great
expectations of botanists. Mr. John Ellis, Fellow of the Royal
Society, who had written to Linnaeus the great news that Banks and
Solander were setting forth, now wrote to him the still greater
news that they had returned:&mdash;returned "laden with the
greatest treasure of natural history that ever was brought into any
country at one time by two persons." Linnaeus implored his
correspondent to persuade Solander to send him "some specimens of
plants from Banksia in Terra Australis"; for, he added, "the
newfound country ought to be named 'Banksia' from its discoverer as
America from Americus." The great botanist will see these specimens
as Moses saw Canaan. He has been distressed, and even deprived of
sleep, by the report that Solander intends to set out on a new
voyage before cataloguing what he has brought home:&mdash;"this
matchless and truly astonishing collection, such as has never been
seen before, nor may ever be again." There were good reasons in
those days to approve the change of name of "Stingray Harbour" to
"Botany Bay"! The week spent on its sandy shores was to make an
epoch in botanical studies, as well as in political geography. It
led to the foundation of Sydney, and to the British colonization of
Australia. And it also, wrote a famous botanist of later date,
"proved the example and spur of all that has been done for natural
science, during half a century, in Britain, perhaps in every
quarter of the world."</p>
