<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>Outside the sky rained down waves of quivering light from its
metallic blue on the tawny desert. Every now and then, on a sudden
puff of hot wind from nowhere, the sand danced in little whirls and
dust-devils, and shimmered beneath it, and then subsided again into
a goblin quiet. Some Arabs stood in a tense silence waiting, with
their tools laid beside them&mdash;waiting&mdash;and for what?</p>
<p>The shaft, cutting the sand like a gash, shored up with beams
and planks, led down to the mysteries below, and about the opening
lay two painted coffin lids, with rings and pottery and many broken
fragments, the relics of a dead ancientry. Men, burrowing like
moles in the drift of time, had upheaved these things to the light
of day and they lay there lamentably, their very use forgotten.</p>
<p>There were great heaps of sand and rocks where the work had gone
on beneath the crags tumbled from the huge honeycombed cliffs
above. It was a rubble of <i>d&eacute;bris</i> with neither end nor
beginning, unsightly, repulsive.</p>
<p>In the passage at the bottom of the shaft the heat was
frightful. It was as though the stored central heat of the world
was escaping through it like a chimney. The silence of ages brooded
there, dark, stagnant, repellent. Miles Seton wiped the sweat out
of his blinded eyes with a dripping handkerchief and looked at
Conway, leaning exhausted against a jut of rock before the sealed
door of the unopened tomb chamber. The passage that they had
already explored, with no hair-raising result, lay in two
directions, empty, exploited. They had been at it for two long
years. Those years, the money poured away into the sand, the hope
deferred and disappointed time after time, all seemed to fall on
them with a cumulative weight, and now that they stood before the
last bar to their last hope, they were too played out to be eager
any more. Honestly, at that moment, they did not give a damn for
anything they might find inside that door. That mood would pass, of
course. Mere physical strain. The human brain in each of us is
keyed up to a certain pitch and beyond that it declines to
respond.</p>
<p>Outside, the Arabs broke out into a sudden jabbering and
yelling, now the great moment had come&mdash;invocations for luck and
protection from what the opened door might let loose upon
them:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We take refuge with Allah from the stoned fiend!"</p>
<p>"In the name of Allah, and the blessings of the One be upon our
lord Mohammed and his family and his companions one and all!"
"Allah makes all things easy"&mdash;and at last subsided into the
silence of expectation.</p>
<p>Four trusty men kept them out of the shaft, doing sentry-go at
the top. Masoud, the head-man, was down below with the two leaders.
Not a sound in the depths.</p>
<p>To them, it had been the most extraordinary business from
beginning to end. Never a queerer. The two men, Conway and Seton,
among their war experiences had run up against a Frenchman from
Egypt&mdash;a liaison officer at Poperinghe. They got friendly, for
French was a strong suit of Seton's and Conway's, and the other
fellows got no further than a few nouns and expletives&mdash;and the
man's English was truly French. They were sorry for the poor chap,
and he often spent the evening in their dugout, talking nineteen to
the dozen and picking up stray crumbs of comforts, for the British
Army had enough and to spare, and the less said about French
comforts the better.</p>
<p>Looking back, they reckoned him a more unusual fellow than they
had guessed at the beginning, for his neat dark head, finished
little features and trimmed up moustache had something of the
<i>petit ma&icirc;tre</i> about them&mdash;the kind of thing they used to
guffaw at foolishly in the French comrade until they came to know
the fire and the vim of him&mdash;and at first the two Englishmen were
inclined to be a bit patronising. That soon wore off. There was
nothing of the <i>petit ma&icirc;tre</i> about him, not a bit of it. He
went a long way outside his duty one rainy night when there was a
poor devil with a smashed leg groaning out in No Man's Land, for
when Conway and Seton got back from outpost duty, they found it was
Alphonse who had brought him in. That was by no means the only
time, either. The little man was a rapier in an ornamental sheath.
His name was not Alphonse, of course. He was Monsieur le Capitaine
Jules Geosfrin de Neuville, and equally, of course, that was
frankly impossible, so he became Alphonse in the partnership of
three. He never got anything from home&mdash;not so much as a
letter&mdash;might not have had a friend or relation in the world, but
he paid his way for all that, for he rewarded his pals with
Romance&mdash;the best gift any man can take or give, the easer of toil,
the draught of nepenthe, the Light that does not fail.</p>
<p>Heavens, what romance! He had been everywhere, seen everything.
He would sit in the light that invariably failed&mdash;a candle stuck in
a bottle&mdash;with his glittering dark eyes fixed on distance and the
nerves in his lean face working, and tell them of places they never
heard of before. Of Cambodia and the King's dancing girls, the
golden Buddha with the diamond eyes, the jade Buddha of the Lamas,
set with priceless pearls. Of the vast forests where, sealed in the
knotted jungle, sleep the dead treasures of Angkor Wat, and of the
splendours farther in the unknown, which the dark men whisper of to
each other, but never to the white stranger. That man had the gift
of words, if ever man had it. One might rake in the shekels if one
could set down the phrase, the incomparable manner&mdash;the pause
before the dramatic moment, with the spiked forefinger to point it,
the torrent that broke forth when rhetoric was needed. Seton told
him once that he could have made his fortune as a professional
story-teller in the Eastern bazaars, and he laughed quietly and
cocked his eye at him.</p>
<p>"I have done it, <i>mon ami</i>! I was a hanashika in Japan for
a lean year or two. But I was born there. A man must know the
language, for the East takes its jokes and its love full-flavoured.
And there are <i>nuances</i> also. It is a poor living, but
amusing," he said, and went on to the next story.</p>
<p>It happened to be Egypt. He had been helping De Cartier, the
great Egyptologist, on his excavations at Abu Tisht, and was
present when the Osirian cave was opened up. Conway was not a
person of particularly swift imagination, but Seton saw him
transfixed as Alphonse gradually fired him with pictures of the
close, airless passages they crept through on hands and knees, the
final emergence into a shaft leading down, a velvet blackness, into
the very bowels of the earth, the fall, as into a well, which
nearly ended his earthly adventures, and then&mdash;then, the light, the
frescoes, the stunned amazement, as the men looked round and
realised the presence of an antiquity that left them dumb, before
which Europe became a mushroom impertinence and themselves the
barbarians of yesterday.</p>
<p>"For look you, my friends," said Alphonse one night, "these
people were Egyptians, they had forgotten more than our wise men
know. It is true they did not devote their research to steam, oil,
electricity, flying and the like (a wild shriek, as a shell tore
overhead, to settle, a bird of prey, one knows not where). The
arrow and the sword were good enough for killing with. It was the
secrets of life they wished to probe&mdash;of life that laughs at death.
Therefore it was in the mind&mdash;in the soul&mdash;they made their
triumphs. What we call magic, they had at their command. Marvels,
miracles&mdash;and all the result of a science of which we know but the
alphabet."</p>
<p>"A trick of their priests!" Conway said contemptuously. "Priests
are the same the world over."</p>
<p>"Yes and no, my friend. So far as the priests made the gods
responsible&mdash;a trick. But that these things were done&mdash;no trick.
The mind of man. That was their kingdom. It was a secret lore,
handed down, probably, from the lost Atlantis."</p>
<p>They had swallowed as much from Alphonse as in a physical sense
he had swallowed from them, but this was too much. He had drawn the
line at fairy tales previously, and Conway picked up his three
weeks' old Times, and Seton a grimy pack of cards, with which he
played solitaire like a maiden aunt when he was bored unendurably.
Alphonse repeated, undismayed.</p>
<p>"What say you to this, when I tell you I have seen?"</p>
<p>"What then? You aren't nearly as effective as usual,
Alphonse."</p>
<p>"Seen a papyrus that came from Sais and speaks of the
Atlantis."</p>
<p>"Go along with you!"</p>
<p>"I have seen it in the Valley of Kafur, and very strange was the
writing. My master deciphered some and would have done more but for
the cholera. Cholera respects not learning. He died."</p>
<p>He drew the well-thumbed notebook, which had been the text of
many stories, from his pocket and read aloud.</p>
<p>"The Burden of Isis (she also was a great goddess of Sais).
Hearken to the beautiful words of my lament. Fallen, fallen is the
land of the Great Ocean. Weep for her queens, her wise men, her
captains, terrible in war. Weep for her maidens, the light of all
the earth. For the sea has swallowed them, the fishes swim in their
palaces and for joy there is weeping. Behold, they are gone, as a
dream flitting through the night. For the anger of the gods was
upon them, and they were broken by their fury.</p>
<p>"Have mercy upon them, O Osiris! Be not angry for ever. Set the
soul of them in a land they knew not. Restore their beauty and
delight and let them live once more.</p>
<p>"And Osiris answered Isis his wife, that entreated before
them:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'The Great White People shall put on again the garment of
flesh, and their sinews shall be iron and their strength terrible.
They shall dwell in the North and come out from it like locusts,
and run over the earth with wings and wheels, and the nations shall
abase themselves. And the sign of this shall be that Nefert, the
Queen, Lady of Crowns, she whose body sits in the land of Egypt,
shall return from the place of the dead. She shall glory in her
beauty. She shall live and triumph.'"</p>
<p>He clasped the book again.</p>
<p>"I had a copy made of that when de Cartier died. I took it to
Buisson, the greatest of our hieroglyphic readers. He read it
attentively and pronounced it to be the oldest writing he had yet
seen. 'As to the prophecy,' he said, 'I can say nothing.
Superstition&mdash;poetry? Who knows? But the Egyptians could sensitise
the human heart as we cannot, for we have bartered that domain of
spiritual knowledge for commercial success, and it is difficult to
run the two in harness. Still&mdash;if ever the body of this Queen
Nefert is found, there may be strange happenings.' That was his
verdict. But the body is not yet found."</p>
<p>"Then was this Nefert a queen of Atlantis?" Seton asked.</p>
<p>"That is not said, but one imagines it. She had an Egyptian
lover, certainly. Buisson said another curious thing, which has
remained in my memory. He said, 'It is a mistake to open these very
ancient Egyptian tombs. They were sealed with solemn ceremonies,
and for excellent reasons. And when they are torn open, strange
things find their way into the world.'"</p>
<p>"Diseases?" suggested Conway.</p>
<p>"Certainly diseases, my friend; did not Buisson die mysteriously
almost directly after? The first out break of the plague form of
influenza was coincidental with the opening of the tomb of Atet.
And if, like me, you have the curiosity to trace cause and effect,
you will find plague, cholera, many other little pleasantries of
nature, emerging into history with the disturbance of famous tombs.
But that is not all."</p>
<p>"What then?"</p>
<p>"Difficult to explain&mdash;and you might laugh if I told you.
Influences&mdash;more&mdash;much more, for those who have skill to read the
occult. Those places were shut and should be respected. Have you
not noticed, also, that good luck never attends the riflers of
tombs?"</p>
<p>He ran off a list of adventurers who had certainly met with
inexplicable misfortunes. They listened, interested but
unconvinced. He added:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yet this did not keep me&mdash;I who speak with you&mdash;from trying my
luck. Learning the place from this document, I opened the tomb of
Khar. And I had the devil's own misfortunes. Every one got the
credit of my work except myself, and as I sit here now, my pay is
the only thing between me and starvation, and my heart is racing me
to death even if the guns spare me. All the same, I would do it
again to-morrow if I could! I would go to Khar, and follow up the
shaft of which I saw the traces during my own excavations. It
leads, I dare swear, to a gallery in the rocks of Khar, and the
finds there may astonish the world."</p>
<p>"I say, let's make up a party of three after this blessed
business is over, and go there together," said Conway eagerly.</p>
<p>"Alas, I shall not be there to accompany you," sighed Alphonse,
gently possessing himself of another cigarette. "In the curse
sealed upon the tomb inscriptions, the robber of the Khar scarabs
was promised a violent death. I robbed them. I shall take my
punishment like a man. I shall not march into Berlin with you at
the end of the war."</p>
<p>"Where then?" asked Seton, stupidly enough.</p>
<p>"Ah, my friend, if I could tell you that, the very guns, opening
the gate to so many, would stop to hear me. Exploring the
underworld, interviewing the august ghosts of the Atlantean queens
(for there were none but queens among that ancient but gallant
people, and the royal consort was a very small person compared with
his wife), but dead in any case. Simply dead!"</p>
<p>He laughed as they stared at him. Not that there was anything
strange in an expectation common to all out there. But there was
something weird, predestined, in his way of putting it. They liked
Alphonse, too. Remember that.</p>
<p>"But when I go, I bequeath you this notebook as the reward for
many cigarettes and much <i>camaraderie</i>," he said, striking a
dramatic hand upon his pocket. "It has copies of more than one
document, and a later papyrus, and it will give you the clues. If
you like excitement better than ease, to follow them up. But
yet&mdash;pause! I counsel you not to let Queen Nefert loose upon a
world which has troubles enough already. She is best where she
is."</p>
<p>A week after that Alphonse was killed. There were no friends to
be informed, no sign of whom he had been. Many a dog might be
blotted out with more compunction and observance than that very
gallant and singular soldier of fortune. Conway and Seton were his
only mourners, and they missed him amazingly. Of course they took
the notebook. Of course they pored over it until every word was
photographed on their brains, and that is why they found themselves
in Egypt when the guns had spoken their last word and the
statesmen's turn had come and the world had settled down to enjoy
the peace (heaven save the mark!) which the soldiers had won for
it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>I resume where the two of them, faint yet pursuing, leaned
against the rock in the downward shaft of the chamber in the Khar
Valley and faced the sealed door. And it was then a curious thing
happened.</p>
<p>Masoud, their head-man, had a kind of fainting fit. Not
surprising, for he was a big, bull-necked fellow, had been exerting
himself to exhaustion, and the dull, stagnant heat in there nearly
did for his masters as well as himself. He slid in a limp white
heap to the ground, and Seton had to tilt a few drops of brandy
down his throat before they could do anything with him. He began to
talk, as if in sleep, the black agates of his eyes showing in a
faint line under the half-shut lids. French! Seton stared at Conway
and he at Seton over the man's head. Masoud did not know a word of
French! Extremely rocky English&mdash;that was all his store, and little
enough for his day's work. But this was French, with the true
Parisian roll to it.</p>
<p>"The guns! the guns!" he said faintly, then was silent.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>! That shell! It screamed like a woman! How can
a man talk in such a devil's uproar?"</p>
<p>They were in a silence like the very heart of the tomb, the only
sound the dull throbbing of the heart-beats in their ears. Seton
saw Conway's eyes dilate and fix. They knew the voice, though it
came weak like blown wind through leagues of distance.</p>
<p>"That which is sealed is sealed. So! Do not open the doors to
the curse shut down with power. Let the dead bury their dead."</p>
<p>Another awful pause. Then, in a wild cry:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The Horror! the Horror! Turn, turn, while there is time!"</p>
<p>And whatever it was went out of him with that last rending cry,
and the man crumpled up altogether. They thought for a moment he
was dead. Conway emptied his water-bottle over his head, and that
was all he could do. After that they waited, Seton kneeling beside
him, feeling it to be a discouraging prelude to the great
experience. Presently, and astonishingly, Masoud sat up and looked
about him, and instead of the gradual and painful recovery they
expected, the next thing he did was to stagger to his legs and
apologise. In fact, never was a man more apologetic&mdash;he had twisted
his ankle, but it was nothing&mdash;a flea-bite. Let them now go on.</p>
<p>Conway, winking at Seton, addressed him in French, to the effect
that the delay was nothing and they scarcely supposed he would be
up to any more work that day. Masoud, still a livid yellow,
evidently thought the heat had affected Conway's brain, and stared
at him in amazement, leaning on the pick-axe which had done such
good service. Not one word did he understand. That was plain as mud
in a wine glass. A pause, and Seton motioned to him to go on, and
with a great heave he let drive at the barred door, now clear of
rocks and earth.</p>
<p>"But, I say," whispered Conway, "did you hear that, Seton? Who
did you think it was? Not Masoud, I'll swear. Of course, it's all
bunk, but still&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Of course it's bunk. What else? It sounded like Alphonse&mdash;if
you mean that. But who's to say Masoud didn't serve with De Cartier
and Alphonse? Who's to say he hasn't his own reasons for trying to
stop us? These fellows are as deep as this shaft, and deeper. You
can never catch up with the Arab brain. They think in a different
cycle."</p>
<p>"I know. Still&mdash;Can't say I liked it. Did you?"</p>
<p>"Not worth thinking of twice."</p>
<p>"That's true." Conway was relieved. "They're one and all born
tomb-robbers, and he has his little game to play. Come on. I don't
give a fig for all the ghosts and devils in Egypt!"</p>
<p>Nor did Seton. But yet&mdash;yet&mdash;</p>
<p>The enormous darkness, fold on fold, stirred only on the edge by
the faintly flickering lanterns; the stagnant silence; the littered
wall of rock; the door it had disclosed, with God knows what
lurking behind it&mdash;these things caught at any braggart words and
made them cheap. Sounding brass and tinkling cymbals, and nothing
behind them.</p>
<p>Conway picked up another axe and set to beside Masoud. They were
by no means scientific explorers, only impatient men, running the
show on their own and eager to get through the shortest way. Their
blows resounded up the shaft to the burnished sunshine where the
Arabs waited and jabbered. Suddenly the door splintered and
yielded, and there was an outrush of imprisoned air, exactly as
when a boy bangs an inflated paper bag against a wall, but foetid,
sickly. They stood back and scrambled half-way up the shaft, and
sat down to await events, staring down into the dark, both of them,
and each thinking his own thoughts. Seton's were a mere confusion.
After all, what was the use of getting the wind up? The place might
be empty, rifled already. Empty? Yet the air went up beside them
like the flitting of dry wings, and the silence of expectancy below
was horrid. And Masoud's strange fit! The man sat, hugging his
knees, below them, staring down into the dark also, with the
lantern below him flinging its light upward and dilating his eyes
and peaking his chin. It was easier to be nervy than normal as they
sat there and said nothing.</p>
<p>They waited half an hour, then Masoud got down again and they
followed. He lit a candle and fixed it on a stick, and held it at
arm's length into the yawning jaws of the dark. At first it burnt a
little blue and flickering, but presently a clear orange, revealing
a few feet of emptiness about its small beam.</p>
<p>At that safety signal Conway trimmed and wiped the three
lanterns and motioned to Seton to go first by right of seniority.
There was a big raised ledge to the door, and he stepped over it
and down, the others following.</p>
<p>The lanterns were good of their kind, and they strung them out
to throw the light as far as possible.</p>
<p>A great chamber, roughed out from a cave, with overhanging juts
of rock from the roof. It was a huge oblong, unexpected recesses
caving in here and there, as far as the main surface went; entirely
empty. There was no time then to explore the bays, as Conway called
them. That must wait.</p>
<p>Suddenly he halted and flashed his light upward as gold and
colours swam into sight. A fresco. The wall of rock was smoothed
with the utmost care into a broad band, possibly four feet high and
twelve in length, and thus prepared for the artist with a surface
smooth as marble and then apparently gilded. In this the figures
were deeply incised and filled with either coloured stones or
pastes as hard as stone, level with the gilded surface and polished
off like enamel&mdash;the colours fair and fresh as when they left the
hands of the craftsmen ages ago. They were as hard as adamant,
whatever the substance, and turned the edge of Conway's knife.</p>
<p>There is a passage in the Bible which describes exactly what met
their astonished eyes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"There portrayed upon the wall the images of the Chaldeans,
portrayed with vermilion, gilded with girdles upon their loins,
exceeding, in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to
look to."</p>
<p>Solemn lines of nobles, not a woman among them, converging to a
throne supported on lions' legs and claws of gold and raised upon a
high dais, so that the occupant towered above the heads of the
hushed audience, as an idol to be worshipped. Wide rays of gold
broke from the crown and conveyed an impression of divinity, and
lo&mdash;this divine ruler was a queen.</p>
<p>It is difficult to convey the majesty of the seated figure. A
solemn black river of hair descended on either side of her face,
which was painted an ivory white, in contrast with the dark
features of the surrounding Egyptians and Nubians. The eyes were
closed, the full lips were dark vermilion. The head, supported by
the high inlaid background of the throne, was crowned with a diadem
so singular that they had never seen the like&mdash;golden snakes
interwound, their three venomous heads darting outward above the
brows.</p>
<p>Rows and rows of jewels encircled the throat, and fell in a
flood of splendour to the knees, meeting a jewelled girdle above
the loins, in plaques of jewels set in gold. The bare feet rested
upon a couchant sphinx, dreaming its secrecies also, it seemed, for
the eyes were dosed. Mystery of mysteries!</p>
<p>They stood before this great fresco, for great it must be
called, from the sense it gave of an awe-stricken crowd, of waiting
suspense, majesty.</p>
<p>Suddenly he started. A shout from Conway, more like a cry:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Seton, come here! Quick!"</p>
<p>He could not see them. They had stepped into a bay, but the
dream shattered and was gone, and he sprang to join them.</p>
<p>Heavens! The bay was the low entrance to an inner chamber, and
the others had gone on and in. He must stoop almost to the level of
his knees to follow, and struck his head smartly in doing it, and
all but fell into the lower level of the floor beneath. Then,
recovering, he hurried on to join the other two, who stood like
statues, flinging their lights far and upward.</p>
<p>What&mdash;what was it that dawned spectral through the gloom? They
were not alone. A Fourth was added to their party. But a silent, a
terrible one.</p>
<p>On a dais of black granite from Syene, polished like a mirror,
an astonishing magnificence for such antiquity, was raised a
throne: a throne with a curved seat and stately back of ivory,
poised on lions' legs and claws of gold. A figure sat upon it, the
bare feet resting on a sphinx of black granite dead white,
reflected in the black water-like surface of the stone. The head
was crowned. The hair&mdash;</p>
<p>They stared, dumb. The woman of the fresco, living but
sleeping.</p>
<p>That was the first impression. Then&mdash;no, not living, not
sleeping. No breath heaved the fair bosom, stirred the locked lips.
There was no trembling in the stiff hand that had grasped the
golden lotus for ages; the cross of life never wavered in the
other. Dead. Death is always terrible. Ten thousand fold more in
this petrified loveliness. In the picture outside she held her
court amid hundreds of eyes that sought her as a divinity. Here,
alone, and the more majestic, she sat with closed eyes, surveying
some inward secret, unspeakable and dreadful.</p>
<p>The first impression passed. Conway, the earliest to recover,
set his lantern on the ground, snatched out his pocket sketch-book,
and began to draw feverishly.</p>
<p>"They won't believe it. They can't, unless we have a record. I
don't believe we can photograph even with a flashlight&mdash;but get the
camera down. Why, I'm not certain I'm not dreaming it myself! For
God's sake, look at the jewels!"</p>
<p>But Seton stood lost&mdash;utterly abstracted. All the imagination
Conway lacked was his in double portion, and, heaven knows, if
there were ever anything to strike a man's imagination dumb, it was
here.</p>
<p>He got out his notebook and began systematically
cataloguing.</p>
<p>"Necklace: flat emeralds set in square plaques of gold, with
golden lions and vultures interposed. Diadem: three twisted snakes,
heads projecting above forehead. Girdle of gold fringes and jewels,
so long as to be a garment to the knees. Armlets and anklets of
gold, crystal and emeralds. Feet supported on granite sphinx.
Golden lotus in right hand. In left&mdash;"</p>
<p>He stopped suddenly, seeing a small object beside the throne&mdash;a
ring of dull beaten gold with a large carbuncle cut deeply with
figures. It lay upon the sand as if it had fallen from the lovely
hand that held the lotus. Then it had been hers! In life she had
worn it. Now it had passed to him.</p>
<p>He glanced over his shoulder and saw that Conway was hard at
work on his sketch; Masoud had turned to the entrance. Seton
stooped quickly, and retrieving the ring, slipped it on the third
finger of his left hand. A pledge&mdash;a token? What? It had evidently
been a thumb-ring, for it fitted him well. He went on with his
list, reading aloud for Conway's benefit, but with his heart
throbbing like a girl's.</p>
<p>"In the left, ivory <i>ankh</i>, or Cross of Life. On steps of
throne at each side ivory and crystal vases. Hieroglyphics on back
of throne and on each step."</p>
<p>He stopped. Again the weird sense of memory captured him. What
was the use of making lists when Beauty, incarnate Beauty, sat
before him and called on some sealed chamber of his brain until it
echoed responsive? Could he catalogue her charm&mdash;that faint,
maddening smile that set her apart, though with his hand he could
have touched the white foot that rested on the sphinx? He dared not
touch it. An insane longing to drive his companions out of the
cave, to end the profanation that disturbed her dream, to sit down
there alone and worship&mdash;these were the thoughts which narcotised
his reason. Was it the hot, close air, or some miasma imprisoned
for ages in the heart of the tomb-cave, or was it her ring that
clasped his finger?</p>
<p>"I'd give something to know how they preserved her in this
life-like way," said Conway from behind.</p>
<p>"She might be asleep. Nothing of the mummy about that! But the
chemists will get at the secret. She must have been a handsome
woman."</p>
<p>Unbearable! Hateful! He felt he could stand it no longer. Must
she be lifted from her throne and set down in some museum for cold
and curious eyes to stare at? Was he to see rough hands profaning
her lovely limbs&mdash;and he himself the cause of what he felt would
torture her?</p>
<p>Better shovel the sand over the whole thing and blot out all
memory of it to the Day of Judgment. But no, it was too late
already! Masoud had carried the news to the men above and they were
shouting themselves hoarse with delight and excitement. For good or
evil, the thing was done.</p>
<p>He came to his senses. Conway had finished, Masoud was bringing
down the camera. They took several flashlight photographs, hoping
for the best. They took rubbings of the hieroglyphics. They closed
and barred the door and set a guard, and, climbing up the shaft,
despatched the great news by camel to the Egyptian authorities, and
then dined, too excited almost to eat, and lay down, exhausted, to
sleep in their huts. And the ancient night, crest-jewelled with the
moon of Hathor and the stars of Isis, brooded over the outrage to
the majesty of forgotten kings, the gash and wound in the smooth
golden sands of the desert.</p>
<p>Conway slept soundly that night. Seton not at all. The darkness
was full of voices that answered no questions, but mourned and
mourned. Who was she? Could she be the lost Nefert of Alphonse's
story? Why had the manner of her burial differed from that of every
other royalty known in the long history of tomb-exploration? Why
had she died so young? True&mdash;</p>
<p>"Queens have died young and fair,<br>
Dust hath closed Helen's eye."</p>
<p>Surely there must be some wild and terrible romance behind it
all. How could he breathe in peace until the hieroglyphics were
deciphered and the truth known? He pressed the ring to his lips and
felt the sharp-cut inscription against them. It was sickening to
feel it a mystery.</p>
<p>All night he lay and stared out at the dim glimmer of light in
the opening of the tent.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>The next day brought with it Walworth, a skilled hieroglyphist,
who happened to be working up at the neck of the valley, fourteen
miles away, on a little problem of his own. They had sent him word
the afternoon before, and he came, eager as a boy, though a man of
sixty, a picturesque figure, with his long white beard, perched on
the swiftly moving camel, and attended by his faithful retainer,
Ali Agha, known also to all Egyptologists, and himself nearly as
learned in antiquities as his master.</p>
<p>Seton and Conway almost dragged Walworth off his beast in the
excitement of seeing knowledge at hand. They fed him, they put the
sketches of the fresco and their notes before him (by agreement
holding the secret of the dead queen as yet); they tried to wile or
drag opinions from him which he was too wary to give until he could
see for himself; and finally the three descended to the shaft with
Masoud and Ali Agha in attendance.</p>
<p>No need to recapitulate his astonishment at the inlaid fresco.
It very much surpassed their own, for he had knowledge to back his,
and when he assured them that the earliest known example hitherto
discovered was at least eight centuries later, his expression of
awe and wonder quieted all Conway's jubilations.</p>
<p>"It will revolutionise our knowledge of Egyptian history and set
hack Egyptian art to eight thousand years B.C.&mdash;if not
earlier."</p>
<p>He stood before it like a worshipper at the shrine of his
devotion, and they could hardly persuade him to have it for the
inner chamber.</p>
<p>"There can be nothing more amazing than this," he repeated again
and again, "for there are many points of interest which you fellows
are too young in Egyptology to appreciate. The dress, the
ornaments, the features, all point to a most astonishing antiquity.
And the woman hasn't the appearance of an Egyptian. I take her to
be a goddess, not a queen. It is evidently an act of worship."</p>
<p>He turned to Ali Agha, who broke into rapid Arabic, pointing,
waving, almost dancing in excitement.</p>
<p>"Queer! He persists that it's a woman, a stranger queen. Well,
we shall know presently. I have my papers here. No, boys, don't
show me anything else! I must digest this marvel first. Strange it
should have come to you two with so little time and experience,
whereas I've been at it all my life and seen nothing like it! Well,
luck's luck!"</p>
<p>Seton was waiting silently. The dominant thought in his heart
was that he would see her again. It was like a man standing at the
door of a royal audience chamber.</p>
<p>But Conway could endure the waiting no longer. He almost dragged
Walworth into the inner chamber. He must see the marvel of marvels,
and without preparation. She should break upon him, a light
sundering in darkness&mdash;he too must worship at the altar of the
loveliness of the Eternal Sleep.</p>
<p>A trembling took Seton as he followed mechanically. Was it some
strange quality in the air, some miasma which affected him only? He
could hear their cheerful voices hollow from within, then a kind of
cry, and dead silence. He leaped after them, wild with anxiety.</p>
<p>The lanterns flashed on emptiness. She was gone! The throne
still stood there, the sphinx, the vases, all, all, but the one
jewel, the central splendour. The gracious figure was gone. Who had
stolen her? Or had she stepped through the guarded door? Only one
thing was certain. The world would never now look upon that fair
face shining like a star in the darkness of the tomb. She had
escaped them. He sprang up the steps of the dais, unheeding
Walworth's cry of warning. A heap of dust lay before the
throne&mdash;the necklace, the girdle, half buried in dust, lay there,
the anklets and armlets had fallen on the steps as if they had
slipped softly from smooth limbs overpowered with their gorgeous
weight. He heard Conway gasping, almost sobbing, with the cruel
disappointment. He heard Walworth's calm, incurious voice.</p>
<p>"Sure you saw it? Sure it wasn't another fresco, or a reflex
image of the one outside thrown on the dark? Oh&mdash;ah! all three of
you saw it? Curious. Sketch&mdash;photographs? I hope they'll come out.
She's crumbled into dust. It has happened with the bodies of ibises
and some of the sacred cats at Bubastis. Sad pity! Yes, indeed!
What a loss to the world. Lucky the jewellery survives."</p>
<p>Thus they meandered on, while Seton stood dead silent, raging
inwardly.</p>
<p>So she was snatched from him. How had he been presumptuous
enough to think a queen of Egypt would stay for his poor worship?
No&mdash;she had fled to her royal kindred in their strange secret
paradise. The barbarians had broken into her solitude, they had
sought to commercialise her beauty and majesty. She refused the
outrage.</p>
<p>It almost terrified him that she had been so real a presence to
him&mdash;a dead woman, long dead&mdash;what bond could there be between
them? But it had left his heart empty. How should he face it? That
was the problem. If he had been alone&mdash;but no!&mdash;how could he even
think with Walworth rambling on.</p>
<p>"It was the outer air. No, my boy, you couldn't have averted,
it. Opening to the outer air was fatal. You never could have moved
her. Never mind. You have the sketch, and the photos may be better
than you think. That's always something. Now let me sit down to the
hieroglyphics."</p>
<p>That roused Seton at last. He came heavily down the granite
steps and stood behind Walworth, while Ali Agha set his camp stool,
and got his papers, and brought two fresh lanterns and set them to
best advantage.</p>
<p>Conway, in a bitter bad temper, occupied himself in
photographing the fresco as best he could in the cave outside.</p>
<p>"There's an inscription on each step in characters I never saw
before," was the great man's final verdict. "Ali Agha says the
same, and he has seen everything there is to see. It rather
suggests the cuneiform character, but is not that. The
hieroglyphics that run underneath, I believe to be a translation.
If so, we're in luck."</p>
<p>After four hours of steady work, they all returned to the light
of day for food and rest, and, that over, Walworth gave them his
results so far.</p>
<p>"The Queen of the Great Land. The Queen Nefert, beloved of
Hat-hor. Companion of Isis. Lady of jewels. She who treads on the
necks of her foes. Before whom the Kings are abased.</p>
<p>"But where's the document that he spoke of? De Cartier is dead.
So is Buisson; but if Buisson had seen such a thing, the news of it
should have reached every Egyptologist within a week."</p>
<p>"But we've the copy, sir&mdash;Alphonse's copy. It's not worth a rap
to the scientists, for, of course, they'll say he forged it, but to
us and to you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yesterday I should have said without hesitation that he had
forged it. To-day&mdash;I don't know. Fetch it out and let us have a
look. The internal evidence may damn it in the first few
characters."</p>
<p>In the late afternoon Walworth laid before them what he had
achieved. Better give it as he completed it later.</p>
<p>It repeated Alphonse's prophecy of the reincarnation of the lost
people, and proceeded:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The burden of Nefert, the Queen. She went down to the grave
with scorn and loathing. With scorn and loathing shall she arise.
Break not the door. Cast not down the stone, lest she arise and
come very terrible. In the same form shall she come, and her sign
is war and blood."</p>
<p>There was more, but it read like a kind of wailing repetition of
the above, with invocations to strange gods and secret ceremonies
to propitiate them. It ended with a cry:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The curse of a rent heart and a desolate home be on him who
breaks the seal I, Zezar, have set upon the door."</p>
<p>Walworth laid down the parchment and blinked serenely on them
through moony spectacles.</p>
<p>"If this is authentic&mdash;mind you, <i>if</i>, for it is a most
singular document&mdash;there was evidently some grievance against the
lady, and they sealed her down for keeps. She may have been one of
the firebrands of antiquity, a sort of nearly antediluvian
Cleopatra. Why I think the document may be authentic is that there
are so few ideographs. You don't understand? Well, a hieroglyph is
a picture more or less of an actual object seen. An ideograph is an
attempt at rendering an idea, such as love, hope, etc. Naturally
these came much later. Now this document is nearly all hieroglyph.
I don't suppose that would have occurred to a forger."</p>
<p>They listened with breathless interest. Conway's cigarette had
dropped from his fingers as he leaned forward.</p>
<p>"Ali Agha tells me&mdash;what I knew before&mdash;that there's a
superstition here that when the door is opened for them, these
buried royalties&mdash;and indeed the lesser fry also&mdash;reincarnate and
give trouble. They will have it the Kaiser was born just after the
tomb of Rameses the Twelfth was opened. He brought ruin on his own
dynasty and on Egypt, and for a time she was enslaved. The
characters of the two men being alike, probably worked up the
story, but the people believe these things, and they infect
others."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>Six weeks later Miles Seton, white and drained of strength and
almost of memory, was convalescing at Abuksa, and Conway was in
Cairo up to his eyes in business, doing two men's work, and tasting
all the pleasures and displeasures of being a celebrity in a small
way. The strange story of their find had stirred Europe and Asia
with a thrill of supernatural romance, and, had it not been for the
ticklish condition of the snarling little Balkan States, nothing
else would have been talked of for at least a week. That was the
credit side of the account. On the debit, the authorities were
driving him into daily furies with their claims and prohibitions.
And there was no Seton to calm him with the assurance that it would
all be the same a hundred years hence, and to shed the oil of a
perfect serenity on the billows of impatience. Perhaps that would
have maddened him the more&mdash;Conway was an impatient man&mdash;and he
made the most of all his grievances, including the fact that Seton
had crocked up and left him to face the music alone.</p>
<p>He had been in Cairo a fortnight, and more, and Seton, at
Abuksa, was beginning to get about a little and to feel a spark of
awakening interest in success, in the things that seemed to matter
once, ages ago, in another life, as it seemed. There were curious
changes, however. He had gone through experiences in that illness
which no mortal man but himself would ever know. How her face had
haunted him, the closed eyes that must dream so sweetly under the
black lashes lying like midnight upon the pale cheek, the divine
tranquillity, moon-like in the gloom. She possessed him. Sometimes,
a living woman, she looked at him with eyes so lovely that all the
beauty of life and death commingled in them to drive him wild with
longing. He pursued her down avenues of hopeless quest, where she
dipped and vanished like a star below the sea-rim when ever he
seemed nearest to achievement. She was enchantment, fugitive and
torturing, and fled before him with a backward look that forbade
pursuit&mdash;and ensured it. Madness, indeed, to die for a beauty
entombed for ages, but then, what magic had preserved it to madden
unborn ages? Surely Death himself must have been her lover, to use
her so tenderly that decay's effacing finger had never brushed the
marvel in his sheltering arms.</p>
<p>But always the dreams ended in horror. Within his very arms she
would crumble, a torrid wind sweeping away a handful of gray ash,
or, worse still, she would shrink cowering from him, the dreadful
eyes staring at him from a death's head of bleached bone. And then
he awoke, shuddering from head to foot, the clammy sweat standing
on his forehead, exhausted, done for.</p>
<p>Gradually he began to observe the other guests at the little
hotel with a languid curiosity. It was filling up for October,
though the rooms were still empty enough. Two women caught his
wandering eyes first and intrigued him by a doubt about their
relationship. They could scarcely be mother and daughter, and, if
not, were difficult to place, one was so much the elder.</p>
<p>He heard the younger calling one day outside his window:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sara, Sara, do hurry up. Have you gone to sleep again?" and
liked the voice, gay and sweet, with a kind of suppressed laughter.
The answer came from the window above:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Don't wait, Venetia&mdash;do you hear? Go on with the Greys. I can't
come yet."</p>
<p>Seton went back to his long chair in the cool colonnade and
dismissed them from his mind. But they returned. There was so
little else to look at, for one thing. Sometimes he heard them
talking to each other in a language entirely unknown to him; more
than once he heard the same voice reading aloud behind the pillar
that hid them. He listened. It was a romance of India, and she read
it with a sense of beauty and the value of words which gave it the
charm of a soft, grave music. His thought was, "I could listen to
that for ever. It rests me."</p>
<p>He heard quite plainly when no one else happened to be talking
or passing. This story was not modern, not the facile amours of the
hills and the racket of life in garrisons, but an old story, of
veiled women, of conquerors sweeping down the Afghan passes, of
empire, of wild and stirring romance, with the exquisiteness of
beautiful words, the perfect phrase, the perfume of the hidden
spiritual mysteries underlying the golden and coloured veil of
visible life in India. There must be something more than common in
the woman who cared to read that book and linger over it.</p>
<p>"That does me good," he thought. "It makes life worth while. A
man wants to mount and ride when he hears that kind of thing."</p>
<p>This went on for two or three days more, and now he began to
wish he had the courage to speak to the elder one. She looked about
forty-six&mdash;a clear, open face, with brown eyes set widely apart, a
healthy colour in the cheeks, and dark hair touched with gray. The
younger he had scarcely visualised as yet under the brim of her sun
hat&mdash;he thought of her as a delicious voice, no more.</p>
<p>Next day he was walking up and down the colonnaded verandah,
when the elder came in with a book in her hand. Suddenly she
stopped beside him, her colour rising like a girl's.</p>
<p>"We've just finished this book, and I wondered whether it would
amuse you. We have been so sorry for you&mdash;all alone. And evidently
not strong. Do forgive me if I intrude. I have been rather ashamed
of saying and doing nothing for so long."</p>
<p>Seton knew in an instant how he had needed the sympathy of a
woman's voice. It soothed him inexpressibly, seconded by the kind,
uplifted eyes.</p>
<p>"If you knew how I wanted you to speak to me I shouldn't have to
tell you how grateful I am," he said eagerly. "I've been ill, and
it's been a long pull up."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;and without your wife!" she said kindly. "They told me at
the office she was to join you later."</p>
<p>"My wife? I don't possess such a blessing! Why this wild
romance?" Seton said laughing, and the circumstantial tale, patched
together from heaven knows what misunderstandings, made them
friends at once.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I deserved this show-up for having had the curiosity to
go and ask who you were," she confessed. "A pretty cool proceeding,
wasn't it? And when they told me you were the celebrated finder of
the dead queen&mdash;"</p>
<p>He winced a little at that, and deflected the talk.</p>
<p>"Well, as I went myself to ask about you&mdash;And did that villain
set me as much adrift as he did you? He said you were two ladies
from London, sisters, and that your name was Grant?"</p>
<p>"No, that's quite right, except that we're half sisters. My
sister is young enough to be my daughter. I know we're a perplexing
pair."</p>
<p>She sat down in a wicker chair beside him and took out her
knitting. The soft evening breeze blew gently down the colonnade
and the divine boat of Ra, the Sun, was nearing its western haven.
The shadows in the sands were of a floating ocean blue, like deep
water, and against the sky a line of palms stood out scribbled in
black on gold. He felt better than he had felt yet, and the
prospect of a talk was delightful.</p>
<p>"Surely, it was a great pity your friend had to leave you alone.
His name is Conway, isn't it? We have talked of your wonderful
finds almost night and day for the last month."</p>
<p>She was so eager, so keenly desirous to hear, that Seton
launched out a bit, his own interest lighting up as he saw hers.
After a while she laid down the knitting, her hands clasped on her
knee as she listened entranced.</p>
<p>"Then it was all true? You really did find the queen like that?
Wonderful! If only my sister were here! I shouldn't have this treat
all to myself. May I call her. Oh, here she comes!"</p>
<p>Light feet were running up the steps and a light figure stood
against the sky for a minute. A waking moon showing like a young
goddess floating in rosy clouds above the fringe of palms, made the
coming night lovely, and the silence of the desert drowned all in
tranquillity. So he saw her for the first time.</p>
<p>She came up to him with the same well-bred frankness as the
other. An introduction was scarcely needed. She sat down at once
and slid into the talk.</p>
<p>There are some people, Seton reflected, in whose presence
everything pleasant and easy seems to flower. They say exactly the
right thing to prompt you. You talk better with them than with any
one else, in the happy certainty that they can understand and
sympathise. It never struck him that a girl of two or three and
twenty might prefer a lighter subject for talk than Egyptian
antiquities. Her eyes were so sparkling as he described the great
fresco that he never doubted she was as keen as he was himself. No
attention could be more flattering. It led him to the entrance to
the inner chamber, and there for a minute he paused. Could he speak
openly of that strange experience? Was it possible? Her eyes
encouraged him. He went on. It grew easier when he was once
launched.</p>
<p>"One pities her like a living human being," cried Sara Grant.
"There's something terrible to me in thinking of a young girl
sitting there in the dead dark all those ages. I can't help feeling
she must have known it and been thankful when you let the light in
at last."</p>
<p>"But it ended her," Seton said, with darkling eyes. "She might
have been there, eternally beautiful, but for that. I felt next day
as if we had killed her."</p>
<p>"I think of her as a prisoner chained to her dead body. You set
her free," Venetia Grant said in the low voice that redeemed her
every word from common place. But Seton started. It recalled other
words to his mind. Buisson's, quoted by Alphonse:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I counsel you not to let Queen Nefert loose upon a world which
has troubles enough already."</p>
<p>That also was freedom, and the first harvest from the furrow of
the open grave had not been joy. Eight Arabs dead, and he himself
escaped by such a miracle of constitution that the doctors told him
he bid fair for a hundred years unless he came across another
Egyptian tomb. His face was troubled and she read it swiftly.</p>
<p>"Have you any superstition about opening these tombs, Mr. Seton?
I read a book of Buisson's after we came here, where he hints of
something of the sort. Only a hint."</p>
<p>"Not the least," he assured her. Could it be called a
superstition when all one's reason denied it&mdash;when it was only a
dark, shapeless cloud hovering in the back of one's being&mdash;a relic,
no doubt, of primitive savage beliefs long relegated to the scrap
heap? "There have been one or two coincidences," he added, "and of
course they're remembered and the rest forgotten, and so the story
grows. But we've talked of nothing but my adventures! Mayn't I know
a little about you and where you're going?"</p>
<p>They were here to see a little of Egypt, on their way to India.
They liked travelling, were keenly interested in Oriental life, had
been in China, Burma, Java&mdash;everywhere.</p>
<p>"India, we know best of all, and love it best," Sara Grant
concluded. Venetia took up the tale.</p>
<p>"We're going to pay a most interesting visit there. We are going
to the native state of Mianpur to visit the old Begam&mdash;the queen.
We have known her all my life and a great deal of my sister's, for
our uncle, Lord Cheriton, was English Commissioner there, and my
sister kept house for him. The Begam is the mother of Mahmud Mirza,
the Amir of Mianpur, and we used to be with her constantly. The
most wonderful old woman. You can imagine how interesting it was to
have the run of the zenana in that way. We know the younger Begam,
his wife, very well indeed too. The loveliest girl&mdash;like a princess
in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>."</p>
<p>"Now, that's fascinating," said Seton. "You should write a book
about it. Is he one of the powerful princes? Surely the title Amir
is very unusual in India?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and it has a history. His ancestor came down over the
passes with the first Mogul emperor of India, and he was granted
the State of Mianpur and the title of Amir. He was descended from
one of their uncles and had the rank of Mirza, which, after the
name, always means royal blood. They have married Mogul and Persian
princesses from time to time."</p>
<p>"Of course, I have heard of them. Then he is really a very big
man among the princes?"</p>
<p>"About the grandest in India, and utterly loyal to the British
Raj. His grandfather did splendid service in the Mutiny in
sheltering English women and children, and since then&mdash;and
before&mdash;Mianpur has been the right hand of the Government in India.
They are the kindest people, and really fond of my sister and me.
Mahmud Mirza thought great things of my uncle."</p>
<p>"Do you stay in the palace?"</p>
<p>"Oh no. The differences of custom would make that rather a
<i>g&ecirc;ne</i> for us all. There is the most delightful royal guest
house overlooking the lake. They turn that over to us. You should
just see the beauty of the place! We never are so happy as
there."</p>
<p>"Any one who could adequately describe the Begam in a book
should make their fortune," Sara put in. "A perfect old character,
and yet a great lady in her way&mdash;a very great lady. Mianpur is a
most beautiful city and quite a bit of ancient India. Hardly any
tourists get in and Mahmud Mirza doesn't welcome them. We have been
three times there since my uncle died."</p>
<p>"I envy you!" said Seton emphatically. "If only I could see
India from the inside like that, I'd go to morrow."</p>
<p>When they parted later, they were strangers no longer. They knew
some of the same people in Sussex, they had done the same things,
shared the same tradition, and a great content filled his mind as
he looked out over the mysterious sands, quiet as a sea beneath the
moon. The ease and friendliness of that intercourse&mdash;how he liked
it! Women so well-bred that they were certain of themselves and of
the deference of every man they spoke to.</p>
<p>And now he began to remember and consider Venetia's face. Her
personality had been too engrossing for him to study it in her
presence.</p>
<p>Her figure&mdash;that was charming, light as a flower swaying in the
wind, or the delicate sweeping of grass when a light-foot breeze
runs over it. Her eyes&mdash;yes, they were dark blue, hyacinth blue,
with a haze of gold-touched lashes about them matching her darkly
auburn hair, pressed close to the head in waved abundance,
beautiful hair, and growing beautifully, springing in strong curves
from the low brow and temples, massive as the bronze ivy-leaves of
a Greek nymph. Was she a beautiful woman, he asked himself&mdash;one
that all male hearts must sway to from their orbits? Not a bit of
it! Until she smiled&mdash;and then&mdash;no, not beautiful, but lovable,
infinitely kind, gracious, sweet.</p>
<p>"And that suits me a thousand times better," he thought, and
pulled up short. "Me?" What had he to do with her? Ridiculous.</p>
<p>All the same, he watched her from his little lonely table at
dinner. They were talking what he was now sure must be Hindustani,
and there seemed to be a perfect companionship between them, in
spite of the difference in age. They talked and laughed in a
never-ceasing ripple of interchange, and he felt like a man
standing outside a firelit window that is none of his&mdash;lonely and
envious. He was the only one left of his family, had never known
that kind, familiar intercourse.</p>
<p>So it went on for some days. They never passed him by now, and
the acquaintance grew steadily. Sara Grant talked to him often when
Venetia was away with the Greys, sketching and what not. He learnt
what he could about her. Her mother had been a beautiful Highland
girl from Lewis, little older than Sara, a McLeod of Skaebost,
brilliant, frail, gifted with the second sight, a mystic, a
poet.</p>
<p>"She knew she would die at my sister's birth. She told me so and
it killed my father. You would understand that if you had known
her," Sara said gravely, "That is why my sister is so different
from me. I could think sometimes that it's her mother sitting and
looking at me."</p>
<p>Yes, they were different indeed. But he liked them both, each in
her different way. He counted on their sympathy. He began to be
sure they liked him, for though it had begun with pity, it was pity
no longer: it was the happy dawn of friendship. There were days
when he looked no longer at his ring, and cared nothing for the
unread mystery of the inscription.</p>
<p>One night he stood in the colonnade, looking up to the stars
that hung so low and golden over the ancient land. He was waiting.
Of course he would not intrude on their kindness, but whenever a
step came along, his eye shot sidelong, hoping it was one or the
other, but most of all Venetia. At last! It was Sara Grant. They
sat in the mingled starlight and electric light under a palm which
made a nook of its own, and talked of India.</p>
<p>"My sister is so excited about getting back that she can
scarcely wait. You can't think what an interesting place it is.
Mahmud Mirza is a great collector of old Indian art, and not only
of that, but of Persian and Egyptian as well. He has really a fine
museum in the palace. If any of your discoveries were ever to be
sold, he would surely be a buyer. He's enormously rich."</p>
<p>"I'll remember that when the English and Egyptian Governments
have done fighting over them," he said, laughing. "But do you think
that would be any sort of introduction if I asked leave to go to
Mianpur later on? Should I have a chance of getting in and seeing
anything? I hate the ordinary tourist's line."</p>
<p>"Certainly, he will have heard of you. Say who you are when you
want to get in."</p>
<p>"I wish I were going now. I want to get out of Egypt. I want to
smell the sea," he said wistfully. Then suddenly, in response to
those kind eyes, "Why shouldn't I do it? Would it bore you if I
went in the same boat? Be frank. But honestly, I don't think you
could be anything else if you tried."</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>"I shan't try, and I have nothing to hide. We should be as
pleased as possible if you were on board the <i>Akbar</i>. And
there's another inducement for you. That wonderful Mr. Revel is
going too."</p>
<p>"Never heard of him. Do tell me?"</p>
<p>"Why, he's that mysterious, fascinating European personality
behind so many things. Hand in glove with various governments, rich
as rich, and nobody really knows who he is. Young, handsome, knows
everything&mdash;one of those wonderful quick minds, bright as an
electric flash, talks well&mdash;altogether a most unusual person. We
met him in Cairo, and he was very nice to us. He's going out on a
visit to Mahmud Mirza. That came out when we spoke of the
Begam."</p>
<p>"But where does he come from?" asked the cautious
Englishman.</p>
<p>"I don't know. A sort of international figure. His name may mean
nothing. He simply said that, except for an English education, his
life had been spent more or less in the eastern Mediterranean
countries. He had been in India before and had an Indian servant
who seemed devoted to him. I think he knew Mr. Conway, for he spoke
of asking him some questions."</p>
<p>"Probably a Levantine. Don't like 'em!"</p>
<p>She laughed again.</p>
<p>"Let me reassure you. Very rich. That's a good letter of
introduction."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;if other things fit in. Not, if not. So many of these
Levantines are most dangerous bounders. Why is he going to
Mianpur?"</p>
<p>"Because he is a friend of Mahmud Mirza's. I believe they knew
each other first as collectors of Egyptian antiquities. He has
stayed at the palace more than once."</p>
<p>Venetia coming up, slipped into the talk without a break. She
welcomed the suggestion of his seeing India. Of course he should!
It delighted Seton to look at her, the frank eyes, the humorous
smile that hovered about her mouth when she was pleased or amused,
but, more than all, the sunshiny air that came and went with
her.</p>
<p>"Now you're talking of Mr. Revel. The most interesting person I
ever met."</p>
<p>"Revel&mdash;that might be English," Seton said reflectively.</p>
<p>"Well, his Christian name is Theon. No mistaking that. He said
his mother was Greek. I think if you do come in the <i>Akbar</i>
you'll like him. I never heard any one make antiquities live as he
does. He told us the story&mdash;indeed, he was in Rome at the time&mdash;of
the discovery of a very ancient tomb&mdash;have you heard of it?&mdash;when
they found a beautiful girl's body that fell into dust almost as
soon as they looked at it. He saw it."</p>
<p>"It's extraordinary we should know two people who have seen that
amazing sight. It never crossed my mind before," said Sara. "It
almost frightens me to think of seeing a woman who lived when the
world was young. I should like to hear you both discussing and
comparing."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;those long, lovely nights on the Indian Ocean, with a
great moon and dipping stars&mdash;it will be delightful to sit and
listen to you two learned people. Not that Mr. Revel looks learned.
He looks like&mdash;" She hesitated.</p>
<p>"Like what?</p>
<p>"I won't say like a Greek god, for that's the most
worked-to-death, disgusting old chestnut that ever! What is it,
Sara? You describe him."</p>
<p>"I tried before you came, and failed. Well, he's straight, dark,
and tall, but lots of men are that. He has a quiet, passive sort of
manner, sometimes as if he were half asleep, and yet a kind of
radiance behind it. You feel as if there were something bright and
wonderful that might break out and startle you. Some kind of hidden
power."</p>
<p>Seton laughed.</p>
<p>"I know. An engine working at half pressure, and then you turn a
steam cock and, gee whiz! the revolutions fairly dazzle you."</p>
<p>"That's my theory, on a lower plane," Sara Grant said, laughing
too. "Now, Venetia, come along. It's getting late, and there are
heaps of things to be done."</p>
<p>But Venetia lingered a little.</p>
<p>"I know what he's like," she said. "That bronze Death in the
Uffizi. A dark, mysterious face, shut into itself, secret. He
doesn't want one to think that. He laughs and talks&mdash;but&mdash;one gets
no nearer."</p>
<p>"I know what you mean&mdash;but there's something which concerns me
much more. Will you mind my coming to India in the
<i>Akbar</i>?"</p>
<p>"Mind?" she said cordially. "Why, no. I'm glad you're
coming."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>An unexpected thing happened four days later. They were all
dining together in the long, cool coffee room, the jalousies open
to the evening air, when a man came lightly in and looked about
him, the waiters hurrying to find a table. Glancing easily round,
his eye fell on the Grants dining with Seton, and instantly he
crossed the room.</p>
<p>"Miss Grant? What a pleasure! I little thought I should find you
here at this sort of between-season time. Miss Venetia! How are you
both? May I sit here?"</p>
<p>A chair was brought and they introduced him to Seton. "Mr.
Revel."</p>
<p>It was all as cordial as possible. While the others were
knitting up the broken threads, Seton had time to look at the
stranger and draw his own conclusions.</p>
<p>Handsome? Yes. Haughty? yes. His bow had been distant, though of
a type Seton could approve; his speech was faultlessly refined,
though with a distinct and not unpleasant foreign accent which
Seton could not place. He might be twenty-eight, the hard,
unsympathetic brilliance of youth softening a little with knowledge
and experience. His clothes hinted at a skilled London tailor; he
wore only one ring, a carbuncle set in gold. Sara Grant was right.
The man was unusual, something to be deciphered&mdash;a personality,
intricate and baffling. You must look again, must listen. You
caught yourself wondering what he would say, how he would look
next. A kind of suspense came with him, not unpleasant,
stimulating. He knew more, could be more, than he seemed. That was
the feeling. And with it the wish to follow him up, as it were, and
await developments. Presently he turned to Seton.</p>
<p>"It's strange you should be the first person I'm introduced to,
for I came up to see you before sailing for India. I met Mr. Conway
in Cairo the other day, and, though he could scarcely stop for a
minute, in fact snubbed me mercilessly, what he said decided me to
try to catch you before you moved on. The fact is, I have been
tremendously interested in your work, and I have some information
which may or may not be useful."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>Seton's eyes leaped to life at once. This promised better than
the bombardment of ignorant curiosity which drove Conway half mad
in Cairo. Revel looked like a man who might know things worth
knowing. As Sara Grant rose, they joined up and followed the women
to the verandah.</p>
<p>"Yes. May we smoke, Miss Grant?"</p>
<p>Revel offered a cigarette-case contrived out of a very ancient
flat box of greenish gold. The design was intricate. It had a
beautiful scarab of lapis-lazuli set in the side. Seton, trained by
three years in Egypt, thought and said that the scarab looked very
rare. Revel courteously held the case out for examination, and as
he did so, Seton's eye fell again upon the engraved carbuncle on
the slender olive hand. It had a familiar air that startled him.
Certainly not shaped like his own&mdash;and yet&mdash;</p>
<p>With his eyes on the ring he asked as easily as he could, "Can
you make out the inscription?"</p>
<p>"'Thou endest the night.' It is part of a most ancient charm,
quoted in the Book of the Dead. That scarab was given to a Greek
ancestor of mine who visited Egypt with Herodotus. A family
tradition."</p>
<p>"How long ago?" Venetia asked, touching the ring with
curiosity.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you would scarcely believe me if I told you. The jewel
in my ring, which is older still, was found later, and I had it set
in the box for a reason."</p>
<p>"May we know?" she asked with interest.</p>
<p>They settled down under the pot palms which shaded the verandah
and the sisters faced them. Venetia was gazing at Revel with an
eagerness which seemed to breathe her lips apart and hold back a
heart-beat that she might hear&mdash;the most unconscious flattery in
the world, entirely self-forgetting. Her eyes were soft as the
midnight sky, darkly azure in their long lashes.</p>
<p>But Revel politely ignored her question. He lit his cigarette,
and his head, with its fine-cut dark features lay back against his
chair, his thoughts on something which certainly was not Venetia,
and his answer was not to her but to Seton.</p>
<p>"My reason turns partly on the information which I think may
interest you. Will you hear it now?"</p>
<p>"I'm greatly indebted to you. The sooner the better."</p>
<p>The moon was showering pale glory over the sand, now the colour
of old ivory in her mysterious light. The silhouette of black palms
was thrown up against her and she peered between them with cold
curiosity a goddess not wholly detached from the world she
illumined, she appeared to lurk and listen. There was a great
silence.</p>
<p>Revel reflected a moment, and began.</p>
<p>"Some years ago I was travelling in Egypt on my way to Khartoum,
with a man named Ibn ul Farid, a Persian, descended from one of the
famous Magians who have given their name to 'magic'&mdash;a man of the
strangest occult powers. I won't lay myself open to ridicule by
saying I believe in the word 'magic' as it is commonly used, but I
have certainly seen Ibn ul Farid do things which must be grouped
under that name for want of a better. We were passing through the
Valley of Khar, then undisturbed by human hands, and had camped
there on just such a night as this&mdash;a moon nearly full, not
friendly, not a moon of lovers, but cold, dangerous, sinister, as
we see her now."</p>
<p>Seton looked up at the moon. She seemed to stare at them with a
pinched and pallid inquiry through the palms. Venetia shuddered
imperceptibly. Sara knitted on unperturbed.</p>
<p>"We had eaten our evening meal," Revel went on, "and sat at the
tent door talking, as it might be now. I remember he was repeating
some verses to me from the Secret Rose Garden (I know some
Persian), and suddenly he stopped in the middle of a sentence. We
two might have been alone in the desert valley.</p>
<p>"He caught my hand and held it firmly, and instantly I saw,
dimly at first, as one sees the negative of a photograph held
against the light, and steadily clearing up with definite form and
outlines. A man and woman were standing under the crag which rises
beside the shaft you opened. But not people of to-day&mdash;no, no. The
man was in the tightly swathed garment we know in old Egyptian
figures, the woman in a robe which clung to her like flowing water.
He wore a mitre-shaped headdress with a gold snake about it darting
an angry head forward. She had a diadem of three gold snakes
intertwined, the three heads striking as if at prey. By no means an
Egyptian crown."</p>
<p>Seton started slightly, but said nothing. Revel's quick eyes
caught the motion.</p>
<p>"Am I too diffuse?"</p>
<p>"Pray go on."</p>
<p>The women were breathless. Sara Grant's eternal knitting had
dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>"They stood, as it seemed, in silence, but with clasped hands:
then, loosening hers, he drew from his breast a roll which looked
like papyrus and offered it. Covering her face with one hand as if
in grief, she took it, and even as she did so, a dagger flashed out
in his right hand, and he drove it into her heart. One instant she
wavered, and then fell at his feet, the dry sand scattering as she
fell. I started forward to help, to defend, and so wrenched myself
from Ibn ul Farid. All was gone. There was nothing. The sickly
moonlight fell on an empty world&mdash;sand and rocks which looked
deserted since the beginning of time."</p>
<p>"You saw that?" Seton's tone was coolly critical and
incredulous.</p>
<p>"And more," Revel answered. "For the Persian caught me back
savagely&mdash;'There is danger&mdash;danger!' he cried. 'Around these things
the air is charged with deadly vibrations. Keep back! Watch what
happens!' I yielded, for his grip was like iron, and once more I
saw. No longer the crags. A chamber so great that the end vanished
in darkness. Nubians, black as ebony, holding torches as if at a
great solemnity. Behind them in the flickering light men like
princes, each with a band of gold about his head, and on a throne a
dead woman holding her silent court. You have seen that sight, Mr.
Seton. I need not describe it&mdash;but mark what follows."</p>
<p>His own face looked ashen-pale in the strange moonlight. His
voice sank to something like a whisper.</p>
<p>"I saw the man take from his breast a roll of papyrus. I saw the
chief priest ascend the steps of the throne and open what I must
call a panel in the ivory and gold of the back, beneath a great
carved sun disc. In this he deposited the roll, and, even as he did
it, all the Nubians flung down their torches and darkness rushed
upon them like a sea, and I heard a great voice that wailed and
thundered in the echoes of the chamber:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Nefert the Queen shall bear her doom and carry her secret
until times and a time.'</p>
<p>"And Ibn ul Farid flung my hand from him, and I saw only the
moonlight and the sand and crags. And again there was a great
silence."</p>
<p>There was one also in the verandah. Seton stared at the ground,
conscious of distaste and unbelief, yet impressed in spite of
himself by the solemnity of the man's tone, though he condemned it
inwardly as theatrical. The others waited for him to speak. After a
minute Revel reached out for another cigarette, lighted it, and
smoked composedly. That relaxed the tension, though the women
looked anxiously at Seton. He lifted his head.</p>
<p>"You're certain you saw this? And what was the Persian's
explanation?"</p>
<p>"Before I give you that, I must tell you that at dawn I went
over and over the place where I had seen the two standing. You will
remember this was more than two years before you made your shaft
and that nothing was even guessed of the treasures beneath. Lying
in the sand I found this scarab now set in my case. On the lower
side is incised a name&mdash;the name of Zezar, but not the Zezar of any
Dynasty we know&mdash;a king of some utterly unknown time, of whom all
we can say is that he was a king in Egypt. You will see that on the
upper side is cut an emblem no one has yet deciphered&mdash;it looks
like a fish and a boat!"</p>
<p>Seton now examined the box with the closest attention, then
looked up sharply.</p>
<p>"And you carry a treasure like that about with you, loose&mdash;a
thing you might forget or drop! Surely that's a little&mdash;well, rash,
isn't it?"</p>
<p>"I have a reason for keeping it upon me and in company with the
jewel in my ring. But if we speak of treasures, may I look at your
ring? Indeed, that's a very fine one, if I am a judge at all."</p>
<p>He leaned over eagerly, and Seton, feeling the blood rise in his
face, "fool-fashion," as he said to himself, had no choice but to
stretch out his hand to the stranger. He would not take the ring
off. He drew the line there. Revel seized his hand and examined the
ring closely, comparing it with his own.</p>
<p>"That's an extraordinary thing!" he said. "Look! Do you see it's
the same stone, the same inscription as mine? 'Thou endest the
night.' Well, that is truly amazing. But yours is a carbuncle, too,
and far older than mine. The Egyptians did not reverence the scarab
in pre-historic time. The scarab god, Khepera, came much later.
Haven't you deciphered the inscription? But hold hard&mdash;this
inscription underneath: '<i>Sutem Hemt Urt</i>.' It means, 'Royal
wife, Great Lady.' I haven't got that on mine."</p>
<p>He stopped, looking keenly at Seton.</p>
<p>"Where did you get it? Mine has been in my family for more years
than I dare say."</p>
<p>"I got it some time ago." That was all the answer he
vouchsafed.</p>
<p>"Do pardon me&mdash;but can't you throw any light? Imagine the
interest to me?"</p>
<p>Imagine the interest to Seton! But nothing would wring an
admission from him.</p>
<p>"It was found amongst a raffle of Egyptian odds and ends. I
never knew its history."</p>
<p>Revel saw he could go no further. He drew back politely.</p>
<p>"Well, if you ever are interested, I'll tell you the history of
mine. It's a most interesting thing, and most singular that part of
the inscription should be the same as mine. I've never seen it
anywhere else, and I had inquiries made, I can assure you. But to
return to the Persian. I demanded an explanation next day, for that
night he would say nothing. He told me that he was 'sensitive' to
the influences of the past, and that just as a water-diviner feels
the neighbourhood of water, so he felt instinctively when what he
called the dead vibrations are set trembling. 'Do you mean you feel
and see the spirits of the dead?' I asked. He answered, 'The
Egyptians believe that the Ka, or double, inhabited the tomb. That
is what I see, and what you saw when I grasped your hand. Below
those crags there are certainly the bodies of the dead and what we
have seen are their doubles, the Dwellers in the Tomb.' I asked,
'Did you know we should see this?' He answered, 'How should I&mdash;I, a
Persian from Azerbajan? All I now say is: We have seen. Let us
leave the place swiftly.' I made a small sketch map of the crags
and fixed the position and we moved on with the utmost haste. Our
dragoman (who had seen nothing, remember!) said, 'This place not
good&mdash;men sick if staying. We go on.' And we did."</p>
<p>Venetia leaned forward, pale also in the weird moonlight.</p>
<p>"Do you believe that anything really was hidden in the
throne?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. But whether it is there now is another story. I
don't know what precautions Mr. Seton has taken. It's worth trying.
That is why I give him the information. Ladies, it grows very late,
and I make an early start to-morrow. Will you permit me to say
good-night?"</p>
<p>They all rose and he kissed the sisters' hands, foreign fashion,
then bowed to Seton. It seemed as though there were an
unaccountable coolness between them&mdash;on Seton's side at least. He
hated that ring business! He pulled himself together hurriedly,
catching Venetia's astonished eyes.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much for a most interesting talk. I shall be
meeting my colleague in Cairo and we'll examine the throne
together. It is in the Vaults of the Osirian Museum now. From one
or two things you've let drop, I see you have knowledge of these
matters, and I shall very much hope for more talk with you."</p>
<p>"A great pleasure! But I sail for India in the <i>Akbar</i>, so
my time is short."</p>
<p>"Oh, but Mr. Seton talks of coming, too," cried Sara Grant. "And
in that case there are endless opportunities. He even talks of
Kashmir&mdash;our own goal. It's not settled yet, though."</p>
<p>Suddenly Seton knew he was going. There was no more hesitation.
The reason was not yet clear to him.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm going by the <i>Akbar</i>," he repeated. "I shan't be
wanted in Cairo for some months and my friends will see to our job
meanwhile. Must have a change."</p>
<p>The usual pleasant courteous things were said, and presently he
was alone. He lit a cigar and sat down to think.</p>
<p>Was it all tomfoolery? Was it a lie, a trick? What motive could
the man have? What lay behind the inscrutable courtesy of the
smile? Or was it possibly true that strange and sinister influences
haunt these sealed repositories of the dead and that some minds,
more sensitive than others, are taken by storm, flung open to their
assaults? But if so...He shuddered a little, and the night grew
colder. The wearied moon, was sinking now behind the western palms
with a decaying light, a dull phosphorescence. The air seemed
brooding, unwholesome.</p>
<p>And the ring, what of that? He stared heavily at it. He savagely
resented the notion that any man but himself should own one even
remotely like it. "Thou endest the night." Strange! He had ended
her night, the almost eternal darkness. How it fitted in! What a
marvellous coincidence that he should have found that, dropped as
it were from her hand, spoken as it were by her dead mouth. His
fancy played about this for a while, half fearfully, with a groping
dread.</p>
<p>He sat late and long, then rose and went slowly in.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>That evening was the last but one before the Grants' return to
Cairo and he was afraid they might have no time to spare after
dinner, though he had not seen them all day. But Venetia was pacing
slowly up and down the empty verandah, and alone, the other guests
playing bridge or talking in the lounge inside. Her eyes were an
invitation and he joined her at once and fell into step.</p>
<p>"My sister may be down later. I've finished my own work," she
said. "There are things no one can ever pack for one, and I fled
from her struggles."</p>
<p>The sense of soothing and rest that came with her presence
filled the air about him. It was always the same. Whether she spoke
or was silent, a mute harmony moved her feet. It was delicious to
be with her, to watch the soft uplift of her long lashes when she
looked at him with the candour that showed the untroubled soul
behind. Where the modern girl is dry, sharp, over eager, Venetia
was dewy, lingering, infinitely gentle. She dwelt in a citadel of
calm. Oh, that she could open its doors to him! His strange
sickness had left him nerve-wearied, on edge, and sorely needing
rest, and he dared to picture her touch on his hot temples, like
cool water gliding into the hollows and closing his eye lids in a
sleep of peace. Was it the thought of her which had made the voyage
to India inevitable? A faint perfume from the beautiful hair that
crowned her like a goddess was breathed against his nostrils as she
walked beside him&mdash;he could not take his eyes from the deep bronzed
waves that sprang so strongly from her white forehead and were
rolled and tamed to bind her head. What it would be to see it
flowing about her, released from constraint&mdash;to bury one's hands in
the warm silken masses, to see her eyes like hidden pools of light
in the meshes, to...He scarcely heard what she was saying; what she
was, at the moment eclipsed even her words. Now he awoke with a
start, because she spoke of Revel.</p>
<p>"Don't you think Mr. Revel has something very unusual about him?
I often try to define it, but I never can. It's a beautiful
face&mdash;but it isn't only that. What is it?"</p>
<p>His dream fled. He was broad awake now.</p>
<p>She looked up at him expectantly.</p>
<p>"He's a very good-looking fellow, certainly," he agreed, a
little dryly. "He reminds me of something or some one I've seen,
but I can't place him."</p>
<p>"I can. He's exactly like that wonderful bust of the young
Antinous in Paris. You must know the one I mean. Those very long
agate eyes, the sensitive nostrils, the beautifully cut lips&mdash;a
little full&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You seem to have studied him," Seton interrupted, and was
instantly ashamed of himself before that clear look. He went on in
a different tone. "Yes, you're right. It is the Antinous. The same
firm marble chin with a cleft in it, and the heavy, carved eyelids
and full throat. They say Antinous was a Syrian. Something
dangerous about him. I felt as if those eyelids might suddenly
flash open and reveal&mdash;what?"</p>
<p>"You felt that?" she said, interested. "So did I. The languid
beauty of that bust is just a mask. Do you feel that about Mr.
Revel?"</p>
<p>Seton considered a moment.</p>
<p>"If you mean that he's inscrutable&mdash;yes. Dangerous...I don't
know yet. I can tell you more when we touch Bombay. It may only be
the different race that shuts one off. Very difficult to get over
that. One must always allow for it. It's more than the Greek
mother, I think."</p>
<p>He was determined to be generous, just because he was certainly
piqued by the interest she showed so plainly. She went on, as if
thinking aloud.</p>
<p>"He dulls the people about him, if you know what I mean. Makes
them less alive. His own vitality is so vivid that other people
seem torpid. His mind goes in a kind of grasshopper leap, and he's
there before you know he has started. But it's more than that&mdash;I
feel as if he were&mdash;how shall I say it?&mdash;how one struggles with
words!&mdash;a part of nature, beautiful, unscrupulous, radiant; as if
what lay behind it all might be something dreadful, if one could
only know. Did you feel anything of that?"</p>
<p>"Nothing&mdash;but then you know him&mdash;I don't. I am not sure I
believe his story, and don't see his reason for telling it. It
<i>may</i> be antiquarian interest, but it didn't convince me,
somehow."</p>
<p>She went on as if she had not heard.</p>
<p>"That is how I could picture a faun. Seeing nothing as we see
it. A heart as cold as marble, only full of wants to be satisfied
at any cost. A beautiful animal with the brain of a man. Nero must
have been like that."</p>
<p>"You certainly are not flattering to Revel!" Seton laughed, but
was secretly pleased.</p>
<p>"Oh, it may be utter nonsense. Sara likes him immensely. But I
feel&mdash;as if he belonged to some different race altogether and could
never understand or let us understand him."</p>
<p>"No doubt he does. He probably represents a perfect pool of
races. They're often very good to look at, these mongrels, but you
can never trust them."</p>
<p>After a long while&mdash;</p>
<p>"What are you thinking?" he asked suddenly. She answered
frankly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Thinking how glad I shall be to be in India again. I found my
peace there. In Europe there is such a war of creeds and thoughts,
passion, anger, groping. In India, the peace of the old, old
teaching of the wise men. My uncle was a believer in it. Sara never
cared for it, but he taught me&mdash;The greatest gift of all my
life."</p>
<p>"What is it? I know nothing. Tell me."</p>
<p>"How can I? But it transfigured all life into harmony for me.
Where others see injustice, I see justice, in everything the
working out of Law. Beautiful, wonderful!"</p>
<p>"This world beautiful?" he said with astonishment. "No, no! I
think of the war, of Russia, of all the horrors about us and yet to
come. You can't call that beautiful. You live in a heaven of your
own thoughts and forget the rest. Well, I don't blame you. It's the
only way. It's well we none of us know the future. How should we
have courage to face it?"</p>
<p>"Because we make our own future by our own character. Character
is destiny, and we are what we choose to be. I'm certainly not
afraid of the working out of what I have done in past lives and in
this, because even if it hurts, it will be to strengthen&mdash;growing
pains, you know, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Do you mean to tell me you believe in reincarnation?" he
interrupted in astonishment. "A heathen belief like that&mdash;where a
man may be a dog or an ape in the next life&mdash;a series of
transformations which seem like the mad dreams of an opium-eater?
Surely your uncle&mdash;I've heard what a brilliant man he was&mdash;never
could have taken up with such an extraordinary creed?"</p>
<p>"I think it was because he <i>was</i> a brilliant man," she
said, laughing. "And as to what you say about reincarnation, that's
the western way of putting it, not ours. I wish you could have
known my uncle's friend, Jadrup Gosein. I never saw&mdash;I suppose I
never shall see&mdash;a human being so full of joy, shining, like an
ocean calm lying still beneath the sunshine. If I had known
nothing, heard nothing more, I should have wanted to be what that
man was."</p>
<p>"And what was he? A Buddhist?"</p>
<p>"He was what Buddhism sprang from&mdash;a teacher of the ancient
Vedic books, and he thought the Buddha a mighty teacher. So you
see, I have drunk at the fountains of wisdom."</p>
<p>She stopped suddenly, as if words faltered under the weight of
bliss, and looked up at him. Happiness had flowed in and filled
her, it rippled sparkling in her eyes.</p>
<p>"But this is most extraordinary!" he said perplexed. "You are a
mere girl&mdash;I suppose you may be twenty two&mdash;how can you know things
like this and care about them? This is for scholars, not for
you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm much older than I look. I was twenty-eight on my last
birthday. And remember, I was brought up to this from almost the
beginning. My uncle was fond of Sara, but he loved me, and he gave
me the very best he had&mdash;the best in all the world."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Next day he came upon her, hurrying to look for a book Sara had
left in the colonnade.</p>
<p>"She gets these bad headaches, and it's so hot to-night. You
look tired, Mr. Seton. What have you been doing?"</p>
<p>"Waiting. There's nothing so tiring as suspense. There's
something I want to say to you. Can you stay a minute?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;a minute&mdash;" she hesitated a little.</p>
<p>"I won't delay you long. You were talking of things last night I
want to know more of. I haven't found life so satisfying that I
couldn't do with something better. Could you put me in the way in
India of hearing more of these things? You know the ropes. I
don't."</p>
<p>"If you really wish&mdash;" she said, hesitating still, with doubtful
eyes.</p>
<p>"Certainly I wish. Might I come to Mianpur?"</p>
<p>"Are you sure you care to?" She looked up at him now, but still
perplexed. "I shouldn't have thought&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, and <i>I</i> shouldn't have thought a short while ago, but
such strange things have happened in the last few weeks that I've
come to know that whole chapters of life are closed to me, and the
very chapters I want to read. But I want to say more than
that."</p>
<p>He looked down, frowning a little, as if in deep thought, then
swung round and looked her in the face.</p>
<p>"Miss Grant, I must ask you a question that's vital to me. I'm
going to India for the change, for these things you speak of,
yes&mdash;but with a hope behind it which may mean life or death to me
later. If you feel there's no chance for me&mdash;never could be&mdash;quite
out of reach&mdash;be merciful, and say so now. I don't ask more than
that. Just say, 'I can't tell. It's too soon. Some day it might not
be utterly impossible.' Do I ask too much?"</p>
<p>Seton never could do things like other men. He made no attempt
to approach her, to touch her hand, to say a single word to win
compassion. Perhaps it was because the occasion was stripped of
decoration that the stark earnestness of his voice struck home.</p>
<p>She stopped and looked as straight at him as he at her.</p>
<p>"I understand you. I can't say more and I won't say less. I
repeat your words. It's too soon. I can't tell. Some day it might
not be utterly impossible. Yes&mdash;I'll add one thing more. I'm glad
you're coming to India."</p>
<p>"With all my heart and soul I thank you. This binds you to
nothing. But my own mind is absolutely fixed."</p>
<p>Again his eye fell on his ring. It had meant all to him a few
days ago. Did it mean nothing now? "Thou endest the night." What
night was ended? What light was dawning?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>The time in Cairo was hectic. Conway, over-worked, thwarted and
delayed by the Egyptian Government at every turn, was irritable and
inclined to resent Seton's flight to India. He knew he needed the
rest, none better&mdash;but it was the handiest grievance to pick up and
he worked it for all it was worth. Perhaps he, too, was a little
used up by this time.</p>
<p>They were together at Shepheard's, in the sitting-room where all
his business was transacted, and Seton had just laid Revel's
information before him.</p>
<p>"And do you expect me to approach these Egyptian Johnnies with a
fairy tale like that? If the man had anything sensible to say he
could have said it here, instead of going off to you at
Abuksa."</p>
<p>"Well, as a matter of fact, he said you were too busy to be
bothered. What did you think of him?"</p>
<p>"Didn't think at all. Too busy. But people here make a
tremendous fuss of him, though no one seems to know where he comes
from. He spends a lot of money, they say. What did you think
yourself?"</p>
<p>"Don't know." Seton's tone was doubtful. There was a pause, then
he went on: "After all, you know, old man, Alphonse's sounded as
like a fairy tale as anything else and it's largely worked out into
fact. I'm for examining the throne."</p>
<p>"So might I if I could get at it!" Conway retorted bitterly.
"But the latest development of this blithering government is that
they claim the whole show, and until they've argued it out with our
people at home they'll no more let you or me go near it than
they'll pitch it into the Nile. It takes the heart out of a
fellow."</p>
<p>Here was a facer. Conway sat drumming impatiently on the table,
tense with vexation and irritability. Seton looked moodily out of
the window. It was not only the Revel business. It meant delay,
vexation, possible failure of every hope. For a minute he rejoiced
that the dead queen had escaped the sordid commercialism and
exploitation of the cruel day that had awakened her. Brutal
curiosity, vulgar advertisement&mdash;better a thousand times the clean
gray ash, blown on a careless wind to mingle for ever with the
lonely desert sands.</p>
<p>"There's nothing we can do then?" he said at last, heavily.</p>
<p>"Nothing, but kick our heels here. I'm half minded to chuck the
whole blooming show and go off and let the big wigs fight it out
themselves. Oh, my sainted aunt, what a world it is!"</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door as this discouraging conclusion
was reached, and Conway yelled, "Come in!" as furiously as if he
knew a personal enemy were outside. The door opened quietly, and
Revel stood before them. "I fear I intrude," he said.</p>
<p>Both men were on their feet in a moment, with the smile of
civilisation that means as little as the outstretched hand. Conway
was barely civil and no more. He looked rather suspiciously at the
visitor as he thrust a chair forward.</p>
<p>Revel took it in his calm way, a little stiffened with
haughtiness. He was faultlessly dressed in a suit of light gray. It
set off the ivory pallor of his face and the curiously long agate
eyes set in such dark lashes as any Western beauty would have
coveted. The other two looked war worn, time worn, dulled, beside
that amazing clearness and youth and slender strength.</p>
<p>"Thank you. I shall only detain you a few minutes," he said,
then drew out the cigarette case Seton remembered so well and took
a small object from it which he kept in his hand.</p>
<p>"Referring to our talk at Abuksa, Mr. Seton&mdash;no doubt you have
put the matter before your friend&mdash;are you likely to go any
further?"</p>
<p>"As we're up against the Egyptian Government, it seems the whole
thing is stalled," Seton said. "I fully appreciate your kindness in
running up to Abuksa, but we're properly done in."</p>
<p>"To put it in a nutshell," Conway interrupted, "while the
British and Egyptian Governments are quarrelling about dividing the
swag, the unlucky finders are&mdash;to put it literally&mdash;not to have a
look in. At the same time, you'll forgive my saying that they could
hardly be expected to raise the blockade for&mdash;a ghost story!"</p>
<p>Revel looked at him with cool unconcern.</p>
<p>"I believe I might get you in if you want to investigate."</p>
<p>"I don't think!" Conway said grimly. "All the paths of log
rolling, palm greasing, and <i>bakshish</i> have been tried out
pretty thoroughly. No can do!"</p>
<p>"Those are not exactly my methods."</p>
<p>Revel was still looking steadily at Conway, his shoulder turned
to the other.</p>
<p>"May we know them?" Conway demanded. Seton still was curiously
silent, his eyes fixed narrowing on Revel.</p>
<p>"To be frank," the latter said coldly, "neither your words nor
manner are encouraging, Mr. Conway. If you will not think it
discourteous, I prefer to discuss them with Mr. Seton."</p>
<p>Conway got up, shrugging his shoulders, and lounged slowly out
of the room. He flung a warning word over his shoulder as he
went.</p>
<p>"As you please. But remember, Seton, it's my business as well as
yours."</p>
<p>The door shut upon him, and there fell a long silence, broken
only by the noises from the street outside. There was a sense of
expectancy in the air. It was growing dark and there was a cold
flare of electric light on the wall from without that enabled them
to see each other fairly well. Seton put out his hand to the
switch, but the other held it back. His voice, very low and quiet,
was dominating:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have a very reliable servant, a Lahori Indian. No&mdash;don't
trouble yourself to speak. I know what you would say&mdash;that unless
you see the thing done yourself you have no guarantee against
fraud."</p>
<p>Why was it an effort to speak? Why did the splash of light on
the wall contract and focus to a hard white circle whirling
giddily? It dazzled him&mdash;it held his eyes&mdash;his tongue felt like
lead in his jaws. The cool voice threaded his stupor.</p>
<p>"Fix your eyes on this," Revel was holding out a small
glittering object, very dazzling. "You're not well&mdash;you're
ill&mdash;faintness coming on. This will help you to steady yourself.
Look at it."</p>
<p>He surrendered and could not tell how.</p>
<p>"So&mdash;so! Lean your head back. Watch the light steadily.
Now&mdash;quiet!"</p>
<p>Seton heard a man's voice in the far distance. It seemed to say:
"Ibn ul Farid."</p>
<p>Suddenly there was another man&mdash;but how? Now the light appeared
to circle his face. Every sense of Seton's was absorbed in staring
at this face with the giddily revolving light about it. He could
not move his eyes, could not tell what Revel was doing. The
glittering thing had vanished. Then something seemed to burst in
his brain and all the light went out in darkness and quiet. It was
as if he had sunk leagues deep into the night. A hand held his now.
He was walking&mdash;where? A huge vaulted room, with what appeared to
be a low groined ceiling, solid and dark, lit by a faintly
flickering light carried by a man in front. Strange objects, half
veiled in shadow, wholly grotesque and terrible, surrounded them;
stiff figures, some swathed in bandages like mummies, some boarded
up to the shoulders; great chests; still vaguer shapes beyond
melting into invisibility.</p>
<p>They turned to the left and into a recess. Suddenly the man in
front whirled his light sharply. It fell on an object very familiar
to him&mdash;the throne of the dead Queen Nefert.</p>
<p>For one wild moment he believed he saw her loveliness
enthroned&mdash;the crowned head, the white features composed in that
unutterable calm. Illusion, illusion! That vanished like a dream.
There was the throne, gold and ivory, beautiful exceedingly. The
man with the light had disappeared somehow. Things came and went,
blurred and vanished. There were the uncertainties of dream about
it all.</p>
<p>The light struck upward on the bossed ivory back. It
strengthened. He noted the great sun disc that centred the
ornamentation, the sun with rays about it. Memory sprang awake
instantly and stormed his brain: "Revel&mdash;the papyrus! I'm here for
that."</p>
<p>It seemed to him that he went up the steps which before he had
almost dreaded to touch with a finger, lest the burden of the ages
should come upon them and they too crumble into dust. Kneeling on
one knee at the top he pressed his finger firmly on the great sun
at the back, in the very middle. Something was loose under his
hand! It revolved slowly, but smoothly, as when the workmen passed
it complete, sliding over the flattened surface of design to one
side. There was a cavity that went down the length of his arm
behind. He ran round the back and plunged his hand in and brought
up a roll, tried again, to the utmost length of his fingers, found
nothing more, and, as he withdrew his arm, saw the disc slide
smoothly back into position once more.</p>
<p>"It's done. That's what I came for!" he said, exulting, the roll
clasped firmly in his hand, and even as he said it, the swimming
giddiness seized him again, he became conscious of the whirling
circle of light on the wall&mdash;but there was no face in it now, he
noted that&mdash;and suddenly he was again sucked down into the vortex
of the night and knew no more. Time ceased to be.</p>
<p>A smell of brandy, a wet towel on his forehead, a sickening
faintness slowly clearing off&mdash;the lights lit in the hotel sitting
room, himself lying on the atrocious red velvet couch, and Revel
and a stranger standing beside him made up his first consciousness.
He lifted heavy eyelids and struggled to his elbow.</p>
<p>"What is it? What happened?"</p>
<p>The stranger advanced blandly and took possession of his
wrist.</p>
<p>"Ah, pulse much better now. That's good! You've had a fainting
fit, sir. I am Dr. Moore. This gentleman summoned me from
downstairs. Quiet&mdash;for a bit, and you'll be as right as rain."</p>
<p>He closed his eyes again, feeling strength returning with every
breath now, but still unspeakably bewildered between the real and
the unreal. Was it a dream? Every detail was photographed on his
brain in sharpest outline. Good God, what an extraordinary
thing!</p>
<p>The two talked in low voices at the window while he recovered,
and still the processes of thought went on. But he was
there&mdash;there&mdash;a while ago, as truly and really as he lay here now.
He had never been in the vaults of the Museum, but if ever he got
in and could compare them with this vision, he could swear the
place would be the same. He remembered one great seated figure of
Thothmes the First, with a singular break in the forehead that gave
the effect of an axe driven down and cleaving the granite like a
wedge. That that was there in verity he needed no assurance&mdash;how
could he imagine a thing he had never seen? It was as real as the
chairs and tables about him now. But the roll&mdash;he fumbled on the
sofa for that. He pushed his hand under the red velvet pillow.
Nothing. He sat up stark and searched hurriedly about him, felt
under the sofa&mdash;nothing. The doctor came up again at the
movement.</p>
<p>"Feeling better? That's good. It was the merest nothing and you
won't have any return. Mr. Revel tells me you had an illness not so
long ago, and no doubt this was just a little reminder not to go
too fast. That's all. Well, well! Glad to be useful."</p>
<p>He bowed himself out, and Seton sat up and looked about him.
Revel came and stood by him, looking down at him kindly.</p>
<p>"What happened?" he repeated.</p>
<p>"Very soon told. We were speaking about the papyrus roll and the
throne, and quite suddenly, without any warning whatever, you
fainted off. I did my best with water from your room and brandy,
but after a minute or two I 'phoned down for a doctor. And, as you
see, he succeeded. Have you ever done it before?</p>
<p>"Never, and I'm all right now. Extraordinary! But I can't get
the thing clear. Did you speak to your servant before&mdash;I went
off?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. I said I had a very useful servant, a Lahori man,
and that I should employ him to get us what we want. Why?"</p>
<p>"I remember that. Is his name Ibn ul Farid?"</p>
<p>Revel looked at him in the utmost surprise.</p>
<p>"No. How did you get hold of that? His name is Saad."</p>
<p>"They told me in the hotel at Abuksa."</p>
<p>"They were entirely wrong. But again, why?"</p>
<p>"I thought I heard you call&mdash;Ibn ul Farid."</p>
<p>Revel shook his head, laughing a little.</p>
<p>"What else did you think?"</p>
<p>Seton got up and threw himself into an armchair.</p>
<p>"The most astonishing&mdash;amazing thing! I was in the vault of the
Museum here..."</p>
<p>"Do you know it? Have you ever been there?" the other
interrupted.</p>
<p>"Never. But there it was. And I went through all the junk stored
there, and there was the throne, and, by George! I found the pin in
the sun disc and shoved it back and got the papyrus, and I'm as
certain the thing happened as that I sit here."</p>
<p>Revel looked at him good-humouredly.</p>
<p>"As I have been with you ever since you fainted, I'm afraid I'm
not open to that solution. It was suggested to you by our talk. The
last conscious impression you had was of the throne, the papyrus,
and the Museum. The horse went on galloping when the bit and bridle
of reason were withdrawn. I have seen it before."</p>
<p>It appeared so insane to contradict this that for a moment Seton
was dumb. Then he gathered his forces again.</p>
<p>"Have you ever been in the vaults?"</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"Then answer me this: Is there or is there not a red granite
statue of Thothmes, the First, with a wedge-shaped chunk cut out of
the head and running right down the nose?"</p>
<p>He waited for the answer so eagerly that Revel smiled a little
before replying.</p>
<p>"Certainly there is, and you may see a picture post card of it
in the lounge downstairs and in every shop of the kind in the city.
That is the famous Thothmes which was said years ago to be a Greek
reproduction, and they have removed it to the vaults till the
question is settled. You must have seen the picture a thousand
times."</p>
<p>Seton was silenced. That was undeniable, however much of his own
conviction defied it. He considered a minute and tried again.</p>
<p>"I saw the throne standing in a deep recess to the left, near
the top of the room as I came up by the statue of Thothmes. If it's
standing in that exact position that's a proof..."</p>
<p>"Of what? You certainly never left this room. I did not even
leave you to 'phone. What are we arguing about when that certainty
confronts us?"</p>
<p>Revel was perfectly courteous. Indeed, he was humouring the
fancies of an invalid, but Seton began to be conscious that to
persist in face of this assertion would be gross rudeness. He
apologised with a good grace, and yet could not shake off his
rooted conviction.</p>
<p>"You must pardon me, Mr. Revel. Time and space cease to be when
one is unconscious and one is at the mercy of the unknown. I owe
you many thanks for your kindness while I was helpless. It
convinces me that I badly want a sea voyage to put me completely on
my legs again. By the way..."</p>
<p>He stopped a moment and looked with bewilderment at his
hand.</p>
<p>"Where's my ring?"</p>
<p>The carbuncle was missing! In a moment he was on his knees by
the sofa, hunting distractedly in every corner. Revel stood above
him.</p>
<p>"Are you certain you had it on when you fainted?"</p>
<p>"Certain? Why it has never been off my finger day or night since
I had it. There's nothing I wouldn't sooner lose!"</p>
<p>"Then let me help you. I never saw it fall."</p>
<p>Revel was on his knees, too, in spite of Seton's adjurations.
They hunted in every direction. Finally Revel uttered a cry of
triumph, holding it up in his hand, where it glowed with sullen
fire.</p>
<p>"It had rolled into the extreme corner. But if it's as loose for
you as that, you should certainly have it looked to."</p>
<p>"Thanks awfully! But it isn't loose!" Seton protested. "Look
here, see! I can only just get it on."</p>
<p>He twisted it slowly on to his finger, Revel watching with
interest.</p>
<p>"I don't understand it at all," he said good-humouredly.
"However, it's found, and that is the important point. I suppose
there's no break in it? I once knew a jade ring split clean through
the band, without any cause apparently."</p>
<p>"Split? Why, that ring has lasted for ages and may last ages
more. Not it! But thank you very heartily, for this and for all
you've done for me. I apologise for all the trouble I've given you,
and all I can say is, I'll do as much for you if ever you need it.
The sea voyage and a rest is all I want to put me right."</p>
<p>"A very wise conclusion!" Revel said, smiling. "And I look
forward to many pleasant hours on board. Now I shall take myself
off. But to repeat what I was saying&mdash;I have my own methods, and
with Saad's help I think there is a prospect of success with that
roll. I'll let you know the result when we meet on board. Indeed,
if there were any way in which you could help, I should call upon
you before we sail."</p>
<p>Nothing could be franker and fairer. The two men shook hands
cordially and Revel went off.</p>
<p>Seton looked at his watch&mdash;a quarter to eight&mdash;and deciding
against dinner, he sat down by the window. Five minutes later
Conway came in.</p>
<p>"Not coming down to feed? What's gone wrong? You look as
if,"...he searched for a word, "as if you'd been on the
razzle-dazzle."</p>
<p>"So I have, in a way. Conway, what time was it when you went
off?"</p>
<p>"Nearly seven. Why? I went off to see Achmet Bey and have
another shot at the vault. Not that I believe in the papyrus, and
of course I never hinted at such a thing&mdash;but I'd rather do it
ourselves than be cut out by the Levantine gentleman. But look
here! What's gone wrong?"</p>
<p>Seton told his story, and even in the telling realised that he
was making an ass of himself in Conway's eyes.</p>
<p>"I can't hope to make you see how real it all was!" he said at
last, stopping helplessly.</p>
<p>"If the bridge had been stronger, my tale had been longer,"
quoted Conway, yawning. "Well, old man, you were always the
imaginative member of the firm, but you've beaten your own record
this time. What had you for lunch? Revel seems to have behaved very
decently, staying with you after the doctor came, and so
forth."</p>
<p>"But, Lord bless me! I must have been fainting for nearly an
hour! That never struck me before!" cried Seton. "You say you went
at seven, and now it's nearly eight. I never heard of such a thing!
How could that be?"</p>
<p>"It evidently was." Conway was getting bored. "I'm not certain
of the time anyhow, and I expect you and Revel were yarning
indefinitely before you went off. Shall I send you up
anything?"</p>
<p>Seton shook his head, and as the papers say, the incident was
closed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>After much consideration, Seton ventured to the Continental that
evening, meaning to walk casually through the place and do no more
unless he happened to see the Grants. Judgment prompted him to wait
for an invitation; longing&mdash;a spirit in his feet&mdash;led him, in spite
of himself, to her presence.</p>
<p>Sara Grant was knitting in a corner and beckoned to him at once,
exclaiming with pleasure that he looked much better&mdash;all sympathy
and kindness.</p>
<p>"I declare, I was frightened about your coming to India&mdash;you
looked as if you'd been through such a bad time. But now, I
foresee, we shan't be able to keep pace with you at all, and the
sea will finish the cure. Won't it be heavenly after these winds? I
never can tell whether they're hot or cold when they scorch
you&mdash;and the dust and sand! I love Egypt&mdash;can't keep away from it,
but I'm glad to go. Can you wait to see my sister? Oh, here she
comes!"</p>
<p>Venetia came gliding along the great room. She had a silvery
gown which fell closely about her, and the pillar of her throat,
bare of ornament, and lovely, rose warmly white from the shimmering
metallic lustre. The weight of hair, very simply garlanded about
her head and shining with the glossed smoothness of polished
bronze, was supported by barbaric silver pins. A gracious
figure.</p>
<p>"Lovely," his heart said, even while his reason denied it. Some
of the women in the place, smoking, lounging, could easily outmatch
her features, but who had that divine tranquillity? She was like a
quiet sea on a gray day, fathomlessly at peace, touched with a
sparkle of silver hiding brooding deeps of calm. Her voice, too&mdash;he
had always had the fancy that voices have colours and perfumes. An
edged soprano might be a metallic blue. Hers was a melting amber,
with the scent of a summer rose. Lover's nonsense. He almost
blushed for himself&mdash;and yet knew that, even as she came, troubles
fled before her and all happy things seemed possible and near. He
might have expected a trace of consciousness in her manner from the
memory of their last talk at Abuksa&mdash;but there was none. All was
simple, natural, friendly, no more, and whether to draw hope or
fear from her attitude he could not tell.</p>
<p>"I saw Mr. Revel in the street to-day," Sara said after a while.
"He never saw me. He was walking quickly along with his servant
behind him, and the two were evidently on business bent. I noticed
people turning to look at him. He certainly is worth looking
at!"</p>
<p>"He's too beautiful for this matter-of-fact age," Venetia said,
laughing. "He really belongs to a very different time and
country."</p>
<p>"How do you place him?" Seton never was uninterested when she
spoke of Revel. He drew her on.</p>
<p>"Oh, a young king, splendid in robes and jewels, sitting on a
throne with adoring, despairing multitudes before him. He should
have been the lover of your beautiful lady who crumbled into dust.
I'm certain he belongs to four or five thousand years B.C. Look at
him! We don't matter to him. He hears what we say, he sees us&mdash;but
we're like tiny figures seen through the reversed telescope of
thousands of years. We mean no more to him than ants."</p>
<p>Yes, that was his own feeling, too. Something remote, unhuman,
about Revel. Courteous, pleasant, but one never got further.
Friendship was unthinkable&mdash;how could it exist where one could
never tell how a man's mind worked&mdash;where something startling,
amazing, might suddenly flash into being and leave one gasping. She
had implied that herself in speaking of him before at Abuksa, so it
was not his own feeling only.</p>
<p>"I wonder what his history is, where he comes from?" Sara said.
"What can you know of a man if you don't know that? If I can scrape
up courage, I shall ask him, some moonlight night in the Indian
Ocean when we all get confidential."</p>
<p>"You might ask and he answer, but you would never know," Venetia
said. "He couldn't make you understand if he tried, and he wouldn't
try. But he interests me. I like to watch the curious power he has
with people. The servants cringe if he looks at them. People have a
startled look when they first see him. I wonder what he was in his
last incarnation. If he comes to Mianpur, I shall ask Jadrup
Gosein."</p>
<p>"Does he live there?"</p>
<p>"If he is alive still, certainly."</p>
<p>"Then could I speak to him?"</p>
<p>"He sees very few English people&mdash;but I think he would see you
if he thought it would serve you in any way. He speaks a sort of
English, rather beautiful, I think."</p>
<p>"I never could imagine what my uncle saw in that man!" Sara
said, with her little air of finality. "A thriftless person,
supported on the offerings of people nearly as poor as himself, and
a heathen of the deepest dye."</p>
<p>"But you never saw him, Sara dear. You never would!" Venetia
protested. "And you know he cares nothing for money, he has none;
and, as for food, he lives on what a Western workingman would
despise. He's a very learned man."</p>
<p>"Well, what good that sort of learning does himself or any one
else, I have yet to hear. Take my advice and don't go near him, Mr.
Seton. But what's this about your coming to Mianpur? I didn't know
you thought of that."</p>
<p>He felt his face grow warm under the quick look through her gold
eyeglasses.</p>
<p>"How can I resist the chance of being sheltered by the skirts of
your protection, as Masoud puts it? I may get a chance to see the
real thing there, if you'll waste an hour on me sometimes. And it
must be almost unique in India."</p>
<p>"It's certainly that. A most beautiful place. And Mahmud Mirza
is resolved to keep it so. Yes, I think you're wise to have a look
at it. You could go on to Kashmir later, and our servant Ramnath,
who meets us in Bombay, can get you a good man. You must have some
one who knows the ropes."</p>
<p>Seton thanked her, and asked why the place was called
Mianpur.</p>
<p>"Because of all the little green parrots flying about. But you
must get a permit to travel all over the State, for there are some
other delightful towns, and there's very fine shooting if you care
for that."</p>
<p>She went on talking and describing, while Venetia sat silent.
When Sara went across the room to speak to a friend, he turned to
her.</p>
<p>"You say Revel has a strange influence. I don't know about that,
but I've spoken so harshly of him that I think I should make the
<i>amende honorable</i> and tell you how kind he can be when he
chooses."</p>
<p>He told her the story of his fainting and the life-like,
poignant dream of the Museum. She listened with fixed interest.</p>
<p>"It was very strange," she said at last slowly. "<i>Very</i>.
Has it struck you&mdash;But no. I suppose it's the unusual things I've
known in India which puts such thoughts into my head. Of course
you've not quite recovered yet. It was all quite natural."</p>
<p>Seton leaned forward eagerly.</p>
<p>"Do please tell me what you think! You know these Orientals so
much better than I, and for all his perfect English and white skin,
I never feel Revel is a European. There's always a something that
checks one and says 'Thus far and no farther'&mdash;the boundary of race
which we can never cross. What is in your mind?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing!" she said lamely. "It just occurred to me&mdash;Suppose
that curious feeling one has of <i>influence</i> about him were
true, and it were a kind of hypnotic influence&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But he never hypnotised me&mdash;never dreamt of it. Why, he was so
frightened he sent for a doctor at once. Oh no, there's nothing in
that."</p>
<p>She agreed hastily.</p>
<p>"Nothing&mdash;of course there couldn't be! But I have seen and heard
such amazing things. Jadrup Gosein himself has most extraordinary
powers, and my uncle learnt one or two things through him which you
would hardly believe if I told you."</p>
<p>"I would believe anything on earth you told me. Tell me
now."</p>
<p>"Not until we are in India and I have Jadrup Gosein's
permission. He always said that these things were not to be lightly
gossiped about. There were reasons..."</p>
<p>But she pulled herself up there and changed the subject somewhat
abruptly compared with her usual grace of manner.</p>
<p>"Have you quite made up your mind about India?"</p>
<p>"Quite. I secured my passage on board the <i>Akbar</i> the first
day I reached Cairo. I shall go up through Delhi and Agra and see
the sights there, and then join you in Mianpur."</p>
<p>She looked at him, smiling a little, and he believed he might
have asked her then and there if she were glad or sorry, but that
Sara returned and settled down, as if the talk had never been
interrupted, to the beauties of Mianpur. He had not another chance
of a word alone with Venetia that night, and what had been said
about Revel passed entirely from his mind. What filled it was the
wish that he had had the courage to press his suit a little
further, tempered with a certainty that delay would serve him best
in the end. After all, this budding understanding had its charm
too&mdash;a charm seldom to be tasted in the present day. For all her
knowledge of the world and its deeper things, on these points she
was shy and sensitive, eluding capture even while her sweet eyes
invited it, swaying softly aside as a willow bough from the
grasping hand and whispering delight that no ear as yet must hear.
He left late and reluctantly, and, stepping outside into the warm
and jewelled night, met Revel going the opposite way.</p>
<p>"I'll turn and walk with you, Mr. Seton," he said, offering a
cigarette from that strange case with its scarab gleaming in the
hotel lights. The ring glowed on his finger with its legend, "Thou
endest the night." He glanced at Seton's.</p>
<p>"I always feel that that queer coincidence of the inscription
makes a kind of blood brotherhood between us. I wonder what it
means," he said.</p>
<p>"Less than nothing, I dare say. I never asked where you were
staying. Is this on your way?"</p>
<p>"I'm staying with a friend. He and I have business to settle and
it suited me better. I don't know how long I may be in India, you
see."</p>
<p>They walked in silence a few moments, the moonlight and city
lights alternately throwing their shadows, black as ebony before
them.</p>
<p>"By the way, you never used your servant after all in that
papyrus business. I thought you intended to."</p>
<p>"Ah, it turned out so simple, that I had no need of Saad. I had
been able to do a little stroke of business for the Egyptian
Government, and you saw how it worked out. Saad is a different
proposition."</p>
<p>"I gathered from your story at Abuksa that he was a very unusual
person. You remember you said you saw that vision through his
intervention."</p>
<p>Revel stopped and looked at him in astonishment.</p>
<p>"That was not my servant. That was Ibn ul Farid. You have mixed
up the thing."</p>
<p>"May I ask who Ibn ul Farid is?"</p>
<p>"I told you. A Persian with very remarkable occult powers. I
hate the word 'occult.' It has been utterly misused and vulgarised,
but I know no other. He is a descendant of the ancient Persian
Magians and carries on their strange traditions and powers. Do you
remember how often the Magians are spoken of in the Oriental story
as magicians?"</p>
<p>Another pause. Then Revel said in a friendly way:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If it would interest you to meet Ibn ul Farid before we sail, I
think I could manage it. He speaks no English, but I believe you
would find it interesting. He is an extremely devout
Mohammedan."</p>
<p>Seton agreed eagerly, and with the feeling that he had been
somewhat discourteous to a man whose own manners were
irreproachable. They parted, after Revel had arranged to call for
him at Shepheard's next day at three.</p>
<p>"It's exceedingly kind of you," he said, "to do so much for a
man you know so little as me."</p>
<p>"Not at all, not at all!" Revel hastened to assure him. "One
little circumstance has drawn us together&mdash;the ring coincidence.
No, I could never feel you were a stranger."</p>
<p>Seton tried to say something gracious, to infuse a little warm
blood into his reply, but there was always that cold, translucent
wall in his mind between him and Revel. He felt himself gauche,
ungracious, typically insular, as he looked at the calm, beautiful
face before him, covering its deep reticence with a mask of
graceful ease and delicately tempered warmth.</p>
<p>"Well, it's very kind. I'll be ready to-morrow at three." That
was the best he could do.</p>
<p>As he went in, he saw a man in native dress join Revel and they
went off together.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>Revel came next day with most courteous punctuality, and they
very soon left the streets he knew, which, as a matter of fact,
were not many, and plunged into the Oriental section of the city,
with narrow ways and the indefinable odours that the eastern end of
the Mediterranean brings as a foretaste of the true Orient. Little
but Arabic was heard about them now, though some turbaned figures
here and there were unintelligible even to the native Egyptians,
and yet again, mingling with the mass of humanity, were
unmistakable Far Easterns, more at home in their stolidity than
Seton or any European would ever be.</p>
<p>"They understand each other in a way we don't," he said
reflectively. "If ever they all join hands&mdash;and they may!&mdash;the day
of the Nordic race is done, and the white man's empire will take a
seat on the shelf with Assyria and Egypt."</p>
<p>"They may," Revel agreed, leading on swiftly and looking
straight before him. "Well, we shall see what Egypt does with her
freedom. After all, Mr. Seton, the white man has not done all that
was hoped with his civilisation. The life in big cities has
drawbacks, and from the religious aspect..."</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders and said no more. They turned down a
narrow side street, then two more, and, passing several large
houses, stood in front of one that had the air of an even more
closed and shuttered secrecy than the rest. The windows looking
into the silent street were covered by the most closely carved
wooden lattices imaginable, a tracery of the greatest beauty and
delicacy, but so fine that it seemed it must be almost as nearly
impossible to see out as to see in. Evidently a very old house. The
huge two-leaf doors were extraordinarily massive, ornamented with
beautifully wrought iron bars and bolts, with a fine stone arch
above them in intricate designs of palms and flowers.</p>
<p>Age, wealth, and secrecy&mdash;these were the photographs it flashed
on the mind as Seton looked up at the exquisite workmanship of the
lattices, pentagons, and geometric shapes of solid ivory carved in
relief in arabesque and set in frames and interlacings of what
appeared to be true ebony. He halted a moment to admire, and Revel
said appreciatively:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Ah, I see you know a good thing! These screens came from the
ruined Jama of Darut on the edge of the Libyan desert. There is
really nothing like them in Cairo to-day. This is a very ancient
house, a fine type of the rich merchant's of the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>, who desires to keep his concerns to himself and lives
very retired. All his interests are antiquarian. He is called
Sayyid Hasan. Ibn ul Farid is visiting him."</p>
<p>He took the iron pendant rod as he spoke and set in motion a
very large and jangling iron bell hung above the gate, and
immediately, as if at attention, a Nubian opened the doors,
flinging them wide and saluting as if for highly honoured guests.
They entered a great courtyard, so beautiful in the sudden
transition from the grimy street, that Seton could hardly forbear
an exclamation of astonishment.</p>
<p>Acacia trees stood about the black and white marble-tiled
pavements, and vines loaded with exquisite blossom swung from one
to the other, garlanding them with trails of lavish beauty. They
were trees indeed, for the pavement had been laid down around them
when the house was built; birds of dazzling plumage flew about the
branches, apparently as free as in the wild woods. As he looked in
astonishment, Revel, laughing, pointed upward, and he saw that at
the utmost height of the house wonderfully transparent glass
roofings closed the great courtyard in and gave the birds their
freedom&mdash;with a reservation. Three fountains cooled the air,
springing from marble pools of exquisite grace, where white
nenuphars laid their ivory chalices on the crystal surface that was
broken only by the falling plash of water, and about them, forming
green recesses for languid hours of ease, were huge receptacles of
marble, with palms, tree-ferns and every loveliest exotic that
money can buy. Magnificent rugs from Bokhara and Samarcand lay here
and there, their subdued splendour showing up against the white
marble, and low divans were beneath the trees.</p>
<p>To one of these Revel motioned Seton and addressed a few words
to the Nubian, who stood like a man's image in black marble to
await his orders. He replied, salaaming deeply. Revel
translated.</p>
<p>"He says his master is absent for two days and Ibn ul Farid will
represent him. Pray be seated while I go for him."</p>
<p>Seton obeyed, looking round upon a scene to be described only in
Oriental hyperbole.</p>
<p>Quiet voices drawing near, and Revel came between the trees with
a young man beside him in long <i>caftan</i> of richly flowered
silk, a white <i>jubbeh</i> and a red girdle with a white turban
wound about the <i>tarb&ucirc;sh</i>. The dress of the country, nothing
more, but of the finest material and suiting the background so
admirably that he fell, at once, as it were, into the picture, as
even Revel's distinction, hampered by the ugly European dress,
failed to do. His face was olive, clear cut, with dark eyes set
deep in the thick lashes of the Orient, languid in repose but
singularly swift and far-darting when aroused. His manner seemed
dignified and courteous to Seton as they were presented to each
other and took their seats on a low divan at a respectful distance
apart. Revel interpreted so well that there was hardly more pause
than in an ordinary conversation, and after some words had been
exchanged, Ibn ul Farid clapped his hands and thick black coffee
and pomegranate syrup with sherbet was brought, and, following
this, <i>chibouques</i> for smoking, handsome pipes with jasmine
sticks, according to the Mohammedan saying that "coffee without
tobacco is as meat without salt."</p>
<p>Seton looked with full appreciation at the exquisite little
porcelain cups and pearl-inlaid tables such as the tourist never
sees in the bazaar, the work of the craftsman who loves his work
and lingers for love's sake.</p>
<p>"May Allah make it pleasant to thee!" ejaculated Ibn ul Farid
politely, as the guest raised his cup.</p>
<p>He clapped his hands then and ordered the music to attend them,
and much to Seton's delight, two Abyssinian women slaves came in,
unveiled, each carrying a <i>k&acirc;nun</i> or dulcimer, and sat before
them on the ground cross-legged in obedient silence until Ibn ul
Farid raised his hand with a grave:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sing, Uns el-Wufud!"</p>
<p>Their crimson and gold garments set off their dark features with
a something more emphatic than beauty itself and he could not take
his eyes from them as they sang. The first, preluding to the
sonorous strings, gave a love-song.</p>
<p>"Like to the moon would she be, were it not for her raven
locks,<br>
Like to a star, save for her beauty-spot fragrant as musk.<br>
Her cheeks to the sun I would liken, save that, unlike the sun,<br>
She needs not to fear an eclipse, she needs not to shrink from the
dusk."</p>
<p>Revel clapped his hands softly when the song was done, saying to
Ibn ul Farid:&mdash;</p>
<p>"By Allah, her hand on the strings is as the hand of Daood the
King! Be thanks to thee, my friend, for this music!"</p>
<p>He turned, laughing, to Seton and asked him whether it had
pleased him, and Seton saw the quick dark eyes of the girl, swift
as the eyes of a cat, abase themselves in humility as he
replied.</p>
<p>The other, with a little silver brazier before her, on which she
cast a dark powder from time to time, sang the praises of wine. Her
face, seen through the delicate whirls of blue smoke rising from
the brazier, had a strange, heavy-lidded, sullen fascination from
which he could not escape, with the guttural, almost masculine
tones of her deep voice in the unknown tongue still further to
perplex the senses.</p>
<p>"Bring me the wine that may be called a melted ruby in its
cup.<br>
Or like a scimitar, unsheathed, in the sun's noonday light held
up.<br>
Bring me the cup, not till 'tis drained shall my hand drop or set
it by.<br>
Its sweetness falls as sleep's own balm steals o'er the vigil-weary
eye."</p>
<p>And as she finished, she knelt and offered a cup of beaten gold
with the rosy wine of her song mantling within it. With a glance at
Revel to be sure that he transgressed no etiquette, Seton took it
in both hands, according to custom, and drained it, Revel and Ibn
ul Farid refusing.</p>
<p>"<i>Alhamdolillah!</i> Praise to Allah, Lord of the three
worlds, and may his favour and protection rest on the Prophet and
his family!" said the latter with dignity, and, making a sign to
them, the girls disappeared, leaving only the brazier with its
spirals of blue, fragrant smoke behind them. But they had done
their work. The music and the strong wine were tingling in Seton's
brain. He had not the keen, balanced watch on his senses which he
had before. Had that fragrant smoke anything to do with it also?
Impossible, with the sunlight bright above them in the square of
blue sky framed by the house. Still, he waited the next event with
a fainter grip on reality than before.</p>
<p>They smoked awhile in silence, according to the grave dignity of
Eastern leisure, into which Seton, in a waking dream, fell like a
leaf in softly gliding water. Not a sound from the city outside.
The quiet, the stealing, scented blue smoke, were as a veil dropped
between him and the world he knew.</p>
<p>Quiet.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>The minutes drifted on and finally Revel said gravely:&mdash;</p>
<p>"See, my friend, I have brought this Frankish gentleman to
partake of your wisdom. Be pleased to honour us with an exhibition
of such skill as Solomon the Wise might have desired to
behold."</p>
<p>"<i>Ay 'w' allah</i>! Yes, by Allah!" returned Ibn ul Farid with
composure. "What would he have? There is nothing within my power
that is not open to the friend of my lord. Let him speak."</p>
<p>Seton appeared to consider, though he had in reality made up his
mind long ago. He looked up with deference, but resolutely.</p>
<p>"I desire to know from the master of wisdom where is the roll
that was hidden in the throne of the Queen Nefert?"</p>
<p>The wish transmitted to Ibn ul Farid, he bowed and sat a while
gravely silent, his eyes fixed on the plash of the fountain. Revel,
equally silent, was apparently wrapped in his own thoughts. The
servants had all disappeared. Seton waited with a throbbing
constriction in his throat&mdash;a sense of imminent events. Presently
Ibn ul Farid rose, and moving up the divan, sat beside him and took
his hand in his with slender brown Eastern fingers, cold as a
snake's skin.</p>
<p>"You would know a mystery, my friend? Extolled be the perfection
of Him who opens the eye to see and the understanding to penetrate!
Gaze on the water and be at rest."</p>
<p>He fixed his eyes on the dripping fountain&mdash;the sparkling silver
monotone. How it glittered, dripped&mdash;glittered...! As with a flash,
instantly the courtyard, the trees, the fountains, Revel himself,
all were gone. His eyes, wide open, staring in amazement, saw a
strange sight. The tomb chamber of the Khar Valley, every detail of
which was photographed on his mind, dark, silent, lit only by a
flickering light that fell on the fair face of the queen as she sat
there, dimly beautiful. Two men in the immemorial undress of
ancient Egypt, the cloth wrapped about the loins and legs, no more.
Seton could follow every movement as if he were one of them. The
elder had a roll of papyrus in his hand. Furtively looking about
them and listening, shielding the lamp as if in terror lest the
light should betray them, they crept round to the back of the
throne&mdash;they slipped the ivory sun-disc back, they withdrew a roll
from the secret place, they substituted the other. Seton saw the
stealthy retreat without a word spoken, the heavy door swung back,
barred, secured, sealed, and then&mdash;then&mdash;the vision thinned as
darkness thins before the dawn. He could look through the walls of
the tomb chamber, through the men's bodies; and now they fluttered
like thin clothes in a wind, dispersed and vanished. The vision was
gone, and the courtyard and drip and glitter of the fountains were
about him again, the two other men looking quietly at him. He felt
perfectly sane, clear, assured. But he had certainly seen. For a
moment he had a difficulty in speaking.</p>
<p>"Extraordinary! Was it like that?" he said eagerly.</p>
<p>"Like what? You forget we saw nothing," Revel answered.</p>
<p>He described the vision as well as he could, they listened
attentively. Ibn ul Farid took up the word:&mdash;</p>
<p>"To the eye of wisdom the present and past are one; you have
certainly seen a thing which took place."</p>
<p>"But how do you explain it? How can the past be recalled? If
this is so, the thing was stolen centuries ago."</p>
<p>"Nothing that ever existed is dead. It exists for ever. It is as
with a lost book. You find it and turn the page and read what you
will in the future as in the past."</p>
<p>"But how is it done? What does it mean? What happened to
me?"</p>
<p>"One portion of the brain is stimulated, another put to sleep,
and the veil is thus lifted. And as to the future, be it remembered
that the soul of a man is a thing of eternity and casts its light
before as behind it."</p>
<p>"But how did you do it?"</p>
<p>"By a secret wisdom, aided externally by this smoke of a
precious gum and by the wine and music. These lull the external
senses and set the spirit free. It can be done far otherwise, but
this is a way opened to us by the Imaum of his Majesty, our lord
Mohammed, the lord among mankind."</p>
<p>"I always thought it probable that roll was stolen when the tomb
was first robbed," said Revel. "We know it now."</p>
<p>"Will you make me see more? Show me the place where I am going
in India. Then, if it agrees with fact, I will believe."</p>
<p>Again the immobile silence of the two. Again Ibn ul Farid took
his hand in a close, cold pressure. The court yard and fountains
glided slowly away like a vanishing dream, or as the scenes in a
theatre are lifted and disappear, disclosing what lies behind.</p>
<p>He saw a blue lake stretching farther than eye could see,
balustraded with marble as though for a great king's garden
pleasance. Strange trees waved about it, children of a more torrid
sun. Far out in the blue and sparkling water were white palaces,
faint and dream-like, built to all appearance on the very bosom of
the water, floating as it were like the white lotus flowers of the
gods. Surely it was too beautiful to be earthly! A dream barge,
with high, curved bow and stern glittering with gold, the rowers in
garments of gold and scarlet, hovered near the latticed windows,
that the veiled princesses might take their pleasure in the cool
water world about them. Now, very softly, that scene glided by, and
he saw instead snow mountains that dwarfed his utmost imagining,
storming the skies with silver peaks and guarding in their recesses
a valley most beautiful, a land of rivers and forests and high,
secret passes where the bear and the snow leopard are lords, and
above it the very airs of paradise. He saw it, he thirsted for its
loveliness, and then&mdash;remorselessly&mdash;that, too, was gone, The snowy
ramparts drifted away in wreaths of mist and again the courtyard
was about him and Ibn ul Farid had dropped his hand and sat with
his eyes fixed on the ground.</p>
<p>"Wonderful! wonderful!" cried Seton, and sat silent for a
minute, lost in the memory, his brain still lit up with the same
strange sensation of perfect lucidity.</p>
<p>"If you will tell us what you have seen, we may locate it,"
Revel reminded him.</p>
<p>He obeyed with eagerness.</p>
<p>"That is the water palace of Mianpur. I know it well," said
Revel. "You may feel certain that you will be there. For the last,
it is the valley of Kashmir. You will go there also. You will then
be satisfied that this is truth."</p>
<p>Seton reflected a minute.</p>
<p>"Yes, but these places are known to you. Have I unconsciously
been put in touch with your brain? If so, it is wonderful, but not
wholly convincing. Is it possible that my own secret thought can be
read and set before me here? Something unknown to any one but
myself. There is no sort of belief I could refuse then."</p>
<p>Revel turned to Ibn ul Farid and spoke with him in his own
language. At first he shook his head, but Revel persisted, eagerly
now, and at last, throwing his hand out as if with a gesture of
surrender, Ibn ul Farid evidently agreed. Through Revel he desired
Seton to lie back on the divan, and folding his hands on his breast
to compose himself in an attitude like death and to abstract his
mind completely from all external matters.</p>
<p>"This is more difficult," he observed, "but what is impossible
to the Supreme, the Unchanging? Fix your thoughts on what you
desire to see and relax in soul and body as though in sleep."</p>
<p>And Seton obeyed, finding it at first amazingly difficult to
concentrate, for the Western mind has a tendency to ramble, to
spill over, as it were, in all directions, and his thoughts fled
hither and thither like startled birds. What he determined to think
of, however, was the dugout where he had spent so many hours with
Alphonse and Conway. That would indeed be a test, since these men
could know nothing of that closed chapter in his eventful life. At
last he succeeded. The birds had fled away; his mind was like an
empty cup. Another sight and hearing flowed into it. He heard the
roar of the guns overhead. The corner where Alphonse used to lie on
an old rug, smoking, smoking eternally, became visible. Conway was
there with his long legs hoisted up before him on a box. It began
to take shape, to form almost solidly. Alphonse&mdash;was that his
voice, high, animated, dramatic? It was going to work&mdash;to be
successful&mdash;he felt it! A strange power was sculpturing, painting
the whole scene before his eyes. He saw, he heard, and, even as
this happened, a stronger impulse shattered the picture and he saw
instead&mdash;a woman. Clear as in life, Venetia was before him. A great
tree towered above them&mdash;a lime tree, surely, with perfumed tassels
of blossom filling the air with delight, hummed over by innumerable
bees&mdash;a soft <i>bourdon</i> of sound like the audible dreaming of
some divine day in summer. But such a tree his eyes had never seen.
It soared aloft carrying the sweet breath of earth into the very
sky. Its gray and mighty bole was a fortress, its boughs swept the
ground and bowered the grass at its roots with dense layers of
shade. Half hidden by the branches, tangled among them, she stood,
her hands stretched out entreating, her eyes full of fear and
doubt. "I can't come through. I can't get to you!" she breathed. "I
have tried and tried. You must come to me." He did his best, but
the resolute boughs barred the way. And suddenly a great wind
lifted the leaves and flung them apart, and he rushed through the
opened way and caught her in his arms with passionate joy. Their
lips met; he felt her trembling against him.</p>
<p>It was gone.</p>
<p>He sat up, his mind clear as brilliant daylight. He sprang back
to real life. There was no drifting, no gradual recovery. He stood
up and looked at them. This was no place for a man among these
Oriental enchantments! Well enough for play, he loathed it directly
a woman's name was brought into it&mdash;a name he loved. Who could tell
how much these men knew, what means they had of bedevilling the
brain and forcing it to the revelation of its most sacred things?
No, no more of this for him. He was on guard at once, every sense
keen as bared steel.</p>
<p>"Most interesting," he said coldly. "I am very much indebted to
your friend, Mr. Revel, and what I thought of I saw&mdash;a dugout in
France. The mind is a curious thing, and you have given me a
wonderful demonstration of its powers."</p>
<p>He looked at his watch.</p>
<p>"Later than I thought! I must be getting back. Are you coming?
No? Then will you express to this gentleman my thanks for a most
enjoyable afternoon? I am sorry not to have seen my host. Will you
give him my acknowledgments for his hospitality?"</p>
<p>Not a moment would he delay. The beauty had become hateful, and
it was as if he had seen an obscene mask grinning among the glowing
fruits and flowers. Every minute of delay was unbearable.</p>
<p>He made for the great gates, the other two attending him with
the utmost courtesy. He gave a <i>bakhshish</i> to the Nubian
porter, and the wide leaves swung open, and, closing behind him,
shut in the green and sparkling paradise of the courtyard. He
strode through the narrow, jabbering streets outside, flushed,
furious with disgust at himself for ever having gone there, for
having trafficked in these unwholesome byways and possibly exposed
Venetia's name to insult. He felt as if he had dragged her in the
mud. And yet, not willingly. He had purposely emptied every thought
of her out of him and deliberately called up the other for a
screen. Strange! Then it must be true that in some stratum far
below the conscious will were the thoughts and impulses that really
dominate a man and mould his life. Those were the forces to be
counted with&mdash;not the weak little hopes and wishes that flutter the
surface. A man is the slave of his secret being, not of his
conscious will. Well might the ancients say "Know thyself," before
they added "Rule thyself." But how? He was frightened of his own
inmost being as he hurried along with a sense of flight.</p>
<p>The other two turned back slowly into the shade of the
trees.</p>
<p>"Extolled be the perfection of the Perfect, who is merciful to
his servants! This is indeed a very good subject," the man who had
been called Ibn ul Farid said calmly. "And having taken the
impression of the ring last time, it was easy to slip the duplicate
upon his finger this time. He cannot know, and the true one is now
at your disposal, benefactor of the humble. Guard it as the apple
of your eye. Great are its powers in inducing the trance and the
sight. He spoke also while he saw&mdash;that is well. This ring is a
priceless gem indeed."</p>
<p>"It is of great virtue, and we shall need it with a greater than
he. The plans are laid, Saad; the way is made and the goal in
sight. Fortunate indeed was I to secure the ring."</p>
<p>"Certainly, oh dispenser of bounty. Also we have learned that
the Frankish woman is the mainspring of his heart, and he who knows
this secret rules the man. Praise be to Allah, who has allotted to
some wisdom, to other men folly!"</p>
<p>"Praise be to Allah!" echoed Revel mechanically. "It is done&mdash;we
have him now. Yet I noted his manner changed when he awoke this
last time, and, as it were, suspicious and angry. We must risk
nothing, for he is our eyes in the camp of the enemy. I will take
Umar, not you, with me to India."</p>
<p>"He is a glass to read in, praise be to the eternal!" said the
man. He paused and added:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Oh, prince of wisdom, let him never guess it was your will that
moved him. Proceed very slowly and with caution, oh, hope of the
world, and he shall be in your hands to guide as you will. The
woman also."</p>
<p>"The woman is less than the dust in my sight," Revel said
coolly. "In the great game, what is a woman&mdash;and a Frankish woman!
No, sharer of my wisdom, she is but a means to hold the man. I now
depart, and you shall abide in this my house and be answerable for
it until I return in joy. May the blessing of the Most Merciful and
Beneficent make fragrant your life. Great shall be your reward from
the lady and from me. She also works steadfastly to our ends even
now."</p>
<p>"Depart, my lord, in the blessing of the Unity," the other
answered gravely. "Yet stay a moment and worship. It is <i>el
Asr</i>."</p>
<p>For the sweet cry of the <i>Muezzin</i> rang from the minarets
at hand, summoning the faithful to prayer. Revel started as if from
a dream, and, following his friend's example, prostrated himself
with face turned to Mecca, and recited the necessary prayers.</p>
<p>After this, attended by the man called Ibn ul Farid, he went to
the gate, which was opened for him with profound reverence.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>They were passing down the Suez Canal with the desert sands
dreaming into the horizon in golden levels, calm as the sea at
sunset, more remote than the mind of man can conceive, with here
and there a blue pool of shadows&mdash;mirage water to tempt the
traveller to hope and death. Long strings of camels were picking
their disdainful way through Wonderland, the foremost blending in
sensibly with the background and vanishing like ghosts into the
infinity that stretches beyond&mdash;caravans travel ling to reach the
House of Nothingness, the cold caravanserai where so many have
preceded them to rest covered by deeper sands than the desert's
own&mdash;the sands trickling through Time's hourglass, obliterating all
footsteps and covering men's bones with the pall of quiet.</p>
<p>"When first I came down here," said Venetia to Seton as they
watched the camels, "the old gods of Egypt were good to me, and I
saw a wonderful mirage. I looked over the desert, and there&mdash;just
where I'm pointing now&mdash;was a long stretch of blue water and a
great boat with oars passing slowly over it. And I think it was the
sun-boat of old Egypt, the boat of Ra, as you see it in the tomb
frescoes. Wasn't that wonderful?"</p>
<p>"Wonderful! And what had you done to deserve such a favour?"</p>
<p>"Many things. I've burnt incense before an image of Osiris
wearing the <i>Pshent</i> and holding the Cross of Life in one
stony hand. We had a noble image of him in my uncle's house in
Mianpur, given by Mahmud Mirza, who collects beautiful Egyptian
things. They told me he was a god, and so I did my best with
incense bought in the bazaar and hibiscus flowers from the garden.
My uncle never discouraged me. You see, he believed all the gods
are One, and that you may name that One as you please. Does the
desert give you a feeling of measureless antiquity&mdash;more so than
the Sphinx, the pyramids, or anything in Egypt?"</p>
<p>"Measureless. It's because it always brings the image of the
caravan, and that is life itself. See how those camels blend with
the distance and are gone! We shall never see them again&mdash; "'They
have entered the Valley of Silence and lifted the Triple Veil.'</p>
<p>"and it drops behind them. Done!"</p>
<p>She caught his wistful tone instantly.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;I know. But they are never really gone. They return.</p>
<p>"'They have drunk of the waters of silence, and eaten the lotus
of dream,'</p>
<p>"but life is immortal, and they come' back, refreshed with sleep
for the pew life, bringing their sheaves with them."</p>
<p>"Their sheaves?"</p>
<p>"Things they have done and thought. What they have made
themselves."</p>
<p>"That might be a very terrible business," he said, staring out
over the terrible golden calm. "Suppose a man charged with
malignant hatreds, with treasures of knowledge, remembering and
using the past as a weapon with which to break the present, not one
knowing or guessing his powers&mdash;think of the possible wreckage! No,
no, let me believe the dead are dead. There's no safety for us
else!"</p>
<p>"Yet that explains some of the world-wreckers and world
catastrophes. It does away with the possibility of injustice.
Perhaps it's because I heard that creed so early that all others
seem so illogical to me."</p>
<p>"You rest on it? The thought of birth and re-birth doesn't weary
you? I have been so tired sometimes of this life as to have very
little heart for another."</p>
<p>"Perhaps that proves that you need it all the more. But ask
Jadrup Gosein. He will tell you what will make you understand. Do
you suppose Mr. Revel can remember his incarnations? He must have
had a strange past."</p>
<p>That evening, almost as if he felt his seclusion had been
noticeable, Revel came on deck after dinner and made his way to the
corner where Seton always en camped with the Grants.</p>
<p>It was a glorious night of deep tranquillity, the star very
large and lucent, Venus, like a lesser moon, sending a quivering
path of light over the marble blackness of the sea.</p>
<p>"I'm very glad to see you at last!" Sara said briskly. "Where,
on earth have you been? I thought you must have fallen
overboard."</p>
<p>"That really might have been pleasanter! No, I have been at
work. Hard work. I got so engrossed that I had even my meals in my
cabin."</p>
<p>"And what work are you doing? Interesting?" He stood, finishing
a cigar and looking down on the group with a friendly smile.</p>
<p>"That depends. Interesting to me. A book."</p>
<p>"A book? A novel? I guess&mdash;a story of ancient Egypt."</p>
<p>"Quite and utterly wrong! A history."</p>
<p>The young, smooth outline of his face looked so unlike a
historian that Sara told him so, laughing.</p>
<p>"How you underrate me, Miss Grant! Why not a history? But not
quite the usual sort. A history of the future, drawn from a certain
knowledge of the past." Venetia looked up at him.</p>
<p>"Certain knowledge of the past? That sounds im possible. What do
we really know about the past? A few records that may or may not be
true, must be coloured to the taste of the recorder, a few
monuments&mdash;and the rest&mdash;the real life of the people&mdash;dead and
gone, for ever out of reach."</p>
<p>He pulled a chair up and sat down by her.</p>
<p>"You are right, and wrong. It is hopelessly gone for those who
only live in the surface world about us, the world of the three
dimensions; but there are men who can see more than that. I have
known them. There is a whole chain of ideas quite different from
those which possess the world at large, and these men have access
to them."</p>
<p>"Is it possible to believe that?" Seton asked. "They would be
inhuman, terrible, possessed of powers we can't even imagine. They
might let loose devastating forces..."</p>
<p>Revel lit another cigar before answering.</p>
<p>"They might. But don't you think a higher wisdom demonstrates
the futility of such an argument as violence?"</p>
<p>"I like not the security," Seton said, launching his quotation
with a final air.</p>
<p>"Like it or not, it's the only one. These men have these powers.
I call them four-dimensional men, for they are not deceived by the
limits of time and solidity, and, taking them for what they are,
they think in totally different terms and can do things which
appear miraculous to the ordinary man."</p>
<p>"What things?" Even Sara's knitting went down on her knee and
she leaned forward to listen.</p>
<p>"They can make seemingly solid bodies pass through seemingly
solid bodies&mdash;their own, for instance. They can transfer themselves
from one place to another instantaneously, for to them our
time-limit means nothing."</p>
<p>"But how&mdash;how?" cried Sara.</p>
<p>"That is impossible to explain clearly to those who are bound by
ordinary conditions, so I can only say that such a man might
disappear from any enclosure you would understand, by a movement in
the fourth dimension."</p>
<p>Seton had been reflecting while he listened.</p>
<p>"Isn't it possible," he asked slowly, "that there may be more
dimensions than four, and that one of these omnipotent persons may
be cornered at any moment by coming in contact with something as
inexplicable to him as his fourth dimension is to us?"</p>
<p>A sort of quick tremor ran over Revel's face like a ripple on
water.</p>
<p>"That is possible," he said briefly.</p>
<p>"Does this knowledge include the belief in reincarnation?"
Venetia asked.</p>
<p>"Certainly, and that is what I meant to say when I began. True
history, as against fiction history, can be revived by a man who
understands that time is not a line, as we think it, but a plane
where an initiate can dwell and move from one event to another as
he pleases."</p>
<p>On an impulse he could not define, Seton asked abruptly.</p>
<p>"Is Ibn ul Farid such a man?"</p>
<p>Again the quick ripple of nerve-play in Revel's face, but he
answered composedly.</p>
<p>"Certainly. What I have told you of his vision in the Valley of
Khar demonstrates it&mdash;and your own experience with him in
Cairo."</p>
<p>Seton winced. He had never mentioned that incident to the
Grants. For reasons not entirely clear to himself, he did not wish
Venetia to hear of it. But he had only himself to blame for Revel's
reply.</p>
<p>"I believe you thought it remarkable at the time." Revel added,
and it was natural that Venetia should ask eagerly what it had
been.</p>
<p>Much against his will, Seton gave a brief account of all but the
last vision, ending, somewhat ungraciously.</p>
<p>"An experience I should never repeat. I think it extremely
unwise to dabble in things one doesn't under stand."</p>
<p>"Surely that would rather limit one's horizon?" Revel's tone was
perfectly courteous, but something in his cool, bright glance
pointed the implication. It roused Seton into instant
opposition.</p>
<p>"Can you explain to me how the thing was done?" he asked
doggedly. "For if not, I'm afraid I must persist in thinking that
anything that subjects the brain to another man's will, is
distinctly undesirable."</p>
<p>"Are we sure it was subjected at all? In each case (as I
remember what happened) you asked Ibn ul Farid a question and
yourself supplied an answer. You asked him to show you where and by
whom the theft of the papyrus had taken place. Surely your brain
was stimulated, rather than subjected. It was not at his will you
saw, but at your own. Again, with your vision of Mianpur&mdash;he simply
set your brain free."</p>
<p>"I don't want another man to have any power over my brain,
either to bind or loose," said Seton, on tenterhooks lest Revel
should make any reference to the last vision and eager at all
hazards to avert the talk. Revel made the obvious retort, but with
his invariable courtesy.</p>
<p>"The easy remedy for that is to abstain from asking questions.
Ibn ul Farid is the last man to force his science on any one.
People seek him. He does not seek them."</p>
<p>"That is perfectly true, and I apologise. All I mean is, it is
an experience I would not invite again."</p>
<p>"Feeling like that, you would be well advised to avoid it,"
Revel said pleasantly; "but I think if you made a study of it, you
would find it very simple. It has nothing whatever to do with
hypnotism or suggestion."</p>
<p>Venetia had listened with breathless attention.</p>
<p>"It's all profoundly interesting. Do you mean, Mr. Revel, that
these things, this knowledge, lies around us for the taking?
Because, if so, you are saying exactly what my uncle's friend,
Jadrup Gosein, teaches. Word for word. He says the bonds of time
and space in which we live are pure illusion, and that any man who
reaches a certain point of knowledge can be free of them."</p>
<p>"That is true. All wise men see the same truth. The bonds of
dogmatic religion are dropped long before a man reaches that higher
knowledge."</p>
<p>"But, according to Jadrup Gosein, that knowledge is open to bad
men as to good&mdash;and that means ruin," she added.</p>
<p>"The wise man sits above good or evil, as we know it," Revel
said coldly. "The phases of ordinary morality are meaningless in
his ears."</p>
<p>"Then I hope," Sara put in emphatically, "that none of us will
ever attain that so-called wisdom; for to live in the world as we
know it, without morality, may be all very well to discuss, but
very unpleasant to try. And I must say, Venetia, if that was the
teaching of your Jadrup Gosein, the less you have to do with him
the better. I never liked your uncle's taking you there."</p>
<p>She shattered the speculative tone of the talk into the
practical. Revel said gravely:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I agree with you, Miss Grant. These Hindu ascetics are often
very dangerous people and very far from the asceticism they
profess. They have that worst kind of ignorance, the ignorance
which assumes knowledge and misleads innocent people."</p>
<p>But Venetia flashed, indignant.</p>
<p>"So far from Jadrup Gosein's ignoring morality, it forms the
very ground of his teaching. He lives and teaches the Sermon on the
Mount translated into Indian terms, and he declares that that is
the only road to the highest knowledge, where the miracles Mr.
Revel talks of become nothing because they are lost in light. And
when men salute Jadrup Gosein they say only, 'Praise the indwelling
Deity,' because he is so near attainment."</p>
<p>Bright tears of emotion glittered in her eyes. She added
impulsively as she rose:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I think Ibn ul Farid's powers must be very unlike his."</p>
<p>Revel's look was indescribable. Seton thought it was one of
repulsion.</p>
<p>"'One star differed from another in glory!'" he said coolly.
"Well, I must say good-night, Miss Grant, and return to the grind.
How long do you stay in Bombay? Only a night? Exactly my plan. I go
on next morning to Ahmadabad, and expect to be at Mianpur in about
a fortnight. What do you intend, Mr. Seton? I do wish I could have
stayed to show you round Bombay. There are interesting bits still,
if one knows where to look."</p>
<p>Seton thanked him&mdash;he would go on the day after they reached
Bombay. He knew no one there&mdash;had a friend at Poona, and they had
planned for Mahahalesh war. He would see Ahmadabad himself later,
on his way to Mianpur, his friend Marriott had settled that.</p>
<p>They separated, and Revel scarcely was seen again until the
<i>Akbar</i> lay alongside the Ballard Pier. He did not even appear
at the Raj Hotel, but sent a chit to say he was leaving so early
next morning for Ahmadabad that he would wish them good-bye until
the meeting at Mianpur. Seton saw him next morning as he left the
hotel, and he waved his hand, laughing.</p>
<p>"Just off to Ahmadabad!" he said. "And you to Poona? <i>Au
revoir!</i>"</p>
<p>He waved his hand and was gone.</p>
<p>Sara and Venetia went off an hour later, and when Seton had seen
them go he felt alone in India.</p>
<p>If the voyage had not brought him any mental satisfaction, it
had at least restored his health. The morbid cloud of depression
had drifted away in the cool sea breezes, and he was himself again,
strong and stable in mind and body. Much that he had felt during
the past four months seemed sickly dreaming now. He wondered also
why he had felt such disturbance about Ibn ul Farid. The man had
gone his way, never to be seen again, and the thing itself had been
a curious experience and therefore worth while. He regretted his
little outbreak of annoyance as something churlish and prejudiced.
It certainly might have appeared so to Venetia with her quick
interest in such matters. Summing up his relation to her, he
believed he had neither lost nor gained ground. There had been
nothing to encourage him to a step further, but nothing to
discourage him in the friendly position he had gained. He might
still hope, but love's thermometer registers changes more sensitive
than any mercury's and he had an instinct that it was safer to
delay.</p>
<p>Summing up Revel, he began to feel that his estimate of him was
overcharged, possibly foolish, and a part of the morbid condition
left by his illness. An arresting personality, and with its own
reserves, perhaps not especially congenial to himself. Mianpur
might reveal more, but he scarcely expected that.</p>
<p>So he labelled Revel and laid him aside, and set him self to the
business of sightseeing. There was to be more time than he
expected, for word came from Poona that Marriott could not meet him
for a week, and then at Ahmadabad. He caught himself wishing that
Revel, with his knowledge of the place, might still be there when
they arrived.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>India is a dark woman, gliding with soft bare feet behind the
curtains of the palace. She is the jewelled mystery, the perfume of
the rose. Hers is the magic that, if ever it vanishes into the hard
light of day, will leave the whole world beggared of its most
poignant romance. And on Seton it laid its spell, as it does on the
few who tremble lest the time should come when it ceases to be more
than a story in a printed book&mdash;no longer living and lovely.</p>
<p>That first day when he saw India face to face he never would
forget. The goddess in her shrine is not revealed in Bombay, the
city of the Sahib, but even the curtains of common life which veil
her are splendid with their woven sunshine of light and colour.</p>
<p>"Behold how Colour, the soul's bridegroom, makes<br>
The House of Heaven splendid for the bride,"</p>
<p>and he saw colour rained about him from the fervid sky until the
rejoicing of the earth was like gongs and cymbals.</p>
<p>It was the evening of that first day of miracle, and he was
passing the door of the Hotel Carnatic. The heat was relaxing as
the sun sank, and the great glass lounge was thrown open to catch
the sea breeze, the lights already lit under the palms.
Consequently the people inside were brilliantly visible to
passers-by, and he looked up instinctively.</p>
<p>Singular! In the right-hand corner Revel was sitting, in close
talk with a man whose face was turned from the street. Revel was
facing it full, so it was impossible to be mistaken, in spite of
the astonishing fact that he was wearing a turban, though the rest
of his kit was European. It certainly altered his face
considerably, bringing out a strong Oriental strain that was new
and startling. He looked like the handsome, long-eyed men all about
the city, who were at present difficult to distinguish, so alike,
so romantic did they seem to an unaccustomed eye. But Seton was
keen and retentive about faces. He knew his man at once. Singular.
He had seen Revel go off with his baggage for Ahmadabad, had heard
his very words, yet here he was. Then why&mdash;Seton halted.</p>
<p>Certainly a man may change his plans&mdash;he had changed his own,
but yet&mdash;he was always being lulled into confidence about Revel,
always being jolted out of it. Possibly there was an underlying
distrust that never was quite asleep, do what he would. Why should
he have made a mystery? Nobody cared a damn whether he stayed in
Bombay or didn't! What one did hate was the sort of thing that made
you feel there were plottings and plannings going on under the
surface. If people had nothing to conceal why should they not be
open and aboveboard? He resolved he would walk in casually and
casually let Revel know that he had seen him. Up the steps he
marched and straight to the office.</p>
<p>"Mr. Revel staying here?"</p>
<p>A copper-coloured finger travelled down the list of guests, a
beady black eye pursued the finger. The <i>chi-chi</i> English
clipped his ear.</p>
<p>"Sartainly not, sar! There is noa gentleman of that name. Oah
no!"</p>
<p>"But I saw him in the lounge!"</p>
<p>"Noa, sar! He iss not."</p>
<p>"I will just walk in and look for myself. I saw him."</p>
<p>"Sartainly, sar."</p>
<p>The clerk drew back, but watched him with some curiosity.</p>
<p>He walked into the lounge. The two men were still there, the
light was bright, there were not many people about. He walked
straight to Revel&mdash;and pulled up like a horse on its haunches in
sheer astonishment.</p>
<p>Revel, if it was Revel, brushed him with his eyes with the
polite indifference of a stranger and went on with what he was
saying.</p>
<p>Seton began to doubt his own eyes. His certainty wavered. It
must be&mdash;it couldn't...He turned on his heel and back to the
office.</p>
<p>"Who is that gentleman in the lounge? There in the corner?" He
pointed an impatient finger. The bored Babu smiled agreeably.</p>
<p>"There, sar? Yess. Hiss name is Ibn ul Farid. A gentleman from
Persia via Cairo."</p>
<p>Seton stared at him, and without another word went down the
steps and out into the gathering dusk&mdash;for the sun had dropped like
a shot bird.</p>
<p>What to make of it, he could not tell for the life of him. He
stood outside, secure that he could not be seen in the shadows, and
stared in. Revel! Though, if even it were Ibn ul Farid, there was
no reason why he should cut him. He stood so for some minutes.</p>
<p>"'If I don't know you, Johnny my boy, in spite of all your
beard,<br>
Why, then I am a duller dog than ever has yet appeared!'"</p>
<p>he hummed to himself, turning away contemptuously at last. He
hated that kind of thing! Then, as the situation grew clearer in
his brain, he halted once more. Up the steps he went again.</p>
<p>"Can you tell me who the gentleman was who was talking with the
first one?"</p>
<p>"Sartainly, sar! That is Sir Gobind Srinavastri."</p>
<p>Seton emerged, reflecting deeply. He knew the name&mdash;who did not?
A wealthy merchant, his firm specialising in the gold brocades of
India, the <i>kincob</i>, as it is called, which the Indian princes
wear when, like birds of paradise, they glitter at state functions.
Curiously enough, his name had been mentioned on board the
<i>Akbar</i>, for Venetia Grant, describing a durbar at Delhi,
spoke of the magnificent princes, and added:&mdash;</p>
<p>"And I have a dress of the very same. Pure woven gold, shot with
rose, like a splendid sunset. My uncle brought it from India, and
it is guaranteed to last three hundred years. It's the best of all,
for it came from the great <i>kincob</i> people, Srinavastri."</p>
<p>"Who's that?" Revel had asked. "Never heard of him."</p>
<p>"Oh, every one who knows India has heard of him. Very rich, very
charitable. He was knighted because of the big hospital he built at
Mianpur. Sir Gobind Srinavastri."</p>
<p>"A Hindu, then?"</p>
<p>"Of course, and very bigoted. He loathes the Mohammedans We went
over the hospital at Mianpur. It is a very fine one."</p>
<p>"Strange I should never have heard of him."</p>
<p>"Yes; but then, you see, he only mixes with his own people. You
might be at Mianpur for ever and never see him. He is never there.
I believe he lives at Satispur, where he has a palace."</p>
<p>Seton recalled all this now. Odd, for he could take his oath
that the two men, talking eagerly and with heads so close together
in the lounge, were anything but strangers. Why should Revel have
denied that he knew a man held in such high respect in India? If
his denial were true, how came they to be on such intimate terms so
soon after landing in Bombay? Why should Srinavastri be hand in
glove with a Mohammedan like Ibn ul Farid? And why, most of all,
should Revel be masquerading as Ibn ul Farid?</p>
<p>Digesting these questions he walked back to the Raj. His mind
was by no means a quickly working one when intrigue was concerned,
and he could not make head or tail of this. It was contradictory,
foolish as a complication in a dream. How could Revel for one
moment suppose he could be unrecognised by a man who knew him well?
Childish! That was all there was to it. He should certainly speak
frankly on the point when they met at Mianpur, and Revel could take
it or leave it as he pleased. Also he should tell Venetia&mdash;no, Sara
would be better!&mdash;exactly what had happened, and leave her to draw
her own conclusions. He was beginning to distrust and dread the
friendship between those two women and Revel.</p>
<p>These thoughts occupied him a good deal during his solitary
dinner and escorted him to the smoking room, where he sat looking
out upon the lights of the Apollo Bandar, more than a little irked
by them. Suddenly a light figure passed between them and his
unseeing eyes, and Revel was drawing up a chair beside him.
Instinctively Seton hitched his own back, the white of his eye
showing a little like a dog's on guard. Revel was perfectly easy
and good-humoured.</p>
<p>"I felt I owed you a little explanation of what must have seemed
very odd to you just now, so I ran on the chance of catching you
before you were off to Poona."</p>
<p>"I need no explanations," Seton said stiffly. "If a man cuts
one, one doesn't seek his further acquaintance. I really think we
needn't discuss it."</p>
<p>"For my own sake you owe me the opportunity. I value your good
opinion and can't forfeit it for nothing. I thought you had left
for Poona this morning..."</p>
<p>"That was obvious." There was a polite cynicism in the
remark.</p>
<p>"It's a part of my explanation. I know no one in Bombay and it
allowed me to meet Sir Gobind Srinavastri in the character of a man
for whom, although he is a Mohammedan and Sir Gobind a Hindu, Sir
Gobind has the highest respect, though they have only
corresponded."</p>
<p>A pause. Seton kept a frigid silence but was listening with all
his ears. Revel went on.</p>
<p>"The Srinavastri firm has had great business dealings with a
firm which employed Ibn ul Farid as an intermediary. It was
impossible for Ibn ul Farid to come to India, and I undertook to
see him instead, but, as he entirely refuses to meet any
Mohammedans but Ibn ul Farid, for whom he has a personal respect,
and will have nothing to do with Europeans, I was obliged to use
Ibn ul Farid's name in the hotel, and you will see that your coming
up to me at the moment would have been most unfortunate. In the
hurry of the moment, I was able to think of no better plan than to
act as I did. This explanation is due to you, but also to myself. I
detested the necessity, and apologise."</p>
<p>Seton reflected. Nothing could be franker than Revel's manner,
and he had spoken with the utmost earnestness. But there was an
unpleasant scent of intrigue about the whole business for all
that.</p>
<p>"Do I understand that Sir Gobind believed you to be a man you
are not?"</p>
<p>"That was an unpleasant necessity of the position."</p>
<p>"Surely it will be uncomfortable for you, to say the least of
it, if you come across him later in India?"</p>
<p>"Not at all. He knows the fact already. There never was a
thought of concealing it after the interview. He would not have
seen me, had not the Persian firm arranged his meeting with Ibn ul
Farid. Nothing was said and he took me for granted. Directly the
business was done, I explained who I was. I should have done so
anyhow, but your dropping in as you did clinched the matter. I saw
the position was at the mercy of chance."</p>
<p>Again a pause. Seton burned to ask how the revelation was taken,
but would say nothing. Revel went on instantly.</p>
<p>"He was quite pleasant about it, said even an old man's
prejudices were not so bigoted as all that came to, and that if any
other matters arose while I was in India, he would see me, in view
of the circumstances. The thing being done, he accepted it. Then I
came away to you. Have I made myself clear?"</p>
<p>Seton felt he could raise no legitimate objection. After all, in
business dealings with Orientals you must accommodate yourself to
prejudices which seem very unreasonable to the average Western, and
there was no question as to the esteem Sir Gobind was held in by
the British Government. He thought Revel had certainly cleared up
the situation to a great extent. He was just about to speak when
one of the servants brought a note in for Revel and handed it with
all due ceremony and salaam.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," he said, and opened and read it, im mediately
afterwards putting it in Seton's unwilling hand. "It's from Sir
Gobind, and in his rather ineffective English. I should like you to
read it."</p>
<p>"DEAR SIR, Our interview. I romitted to speak that the sum half
lac rupees creditable from my firm be paid usual interest through
respected Ibn ul Farid fourth day of approaching month. Kindly
inform him.<br>
<br>
"Signed,<br>
<br>
"GOBIND SRINAVASTRI."</p>
<p>"Thank you," said Seton, and handed it back. "You have certainly
explained matters, and there is no more to be said. I did not need
to read the note, though I appreciate your motive in giving it to
me. Of course, I shall say nothing about this to any one. I regard
it as confidential."</p>
<p>"Thank you. That will be better. Srinavastri is a very peculiar
man. Utterly loyal to the Government of India, one of its strongest
supporters, but as bigoted a Hindu as ever stepped, and held away
from Europeans by every caste prejudice imaginable. His theory of
India is the absolute government of the country by England until
the natives have evolved about a century further than they are now,
but natives and British to be in watertight compartments as far as
any social, religious, or racial mixing up goes. Personally, I
rather hold with his view. The two peoples can't mix&mdash;fire and
water are more possible! You must live in India to understand the
depth and passion of the racial and religious hatred."</p>
<p>"I must suspend judgment until I know a little of the
country."</p>
<p>The talk became general then. Revel deplored the changed
attitude of both the Hindus and Mohammedans to Europeans. It was
all since the war, of course, and owing to the senseless agitation
being carried on by men who knew no more of Europe than they did of
Mars. Knowing India, he strongly advised Seton to be courteous but
very guarded with any Orientals he might happen to meet.</p>
<p>"The country is like a powder magazine just now&mdash;all sorts of
explosive stuff lying about. As far as pleasure goes, I shouldn't
have come here now. Nothing but business brought me. And if I had
had anything to do with Miss Grant and her sister, I should have
advised putting off their trip. Women are in the way unless all is
smooth sailing. Still, they know the country, and with time matters
may improve, for men like Srinavastri have immense influence. But
for the present, the old days are gone."</p>
<p>And so on. He stayed an hour or more, and then went off
pleasantly, looking a very striking and hand some young Oriental in
his turban. He always wore it in India, he said: his work lay among
Orientals, and it made them more at home with him.</p>
<p>"And I like it myself. I'm not ashamed to confess that there is
a Mianpur princess a long way back in my family history. A most
romantic tale&mdash;you shall hear it one day."</p>
<p>It all seemed clear enough when Seton got to bed, having
instructed his Indian servant as to the start for Ahmadabad.
Somehow his enthusiasms were a little ironed out. He could not tell
why.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>Mianpur. He had broken the journey at Delhi and Agra, and turned
a few more picture leaves in the Wonder Book of India, and now
before him was one of even more startling beauty. For he had
arrived the night before at the rest house in the little city of
Mianpur.</p>
<p>A wonderful place indeed, and none the less so because the city
was small. Its autocrat had decided that it should be, and would
not hear of growth and crowd and squalor near his own royal
palaces, and, therefore, the things by which the city lived
transacted themselves in the huge ant-heap of the town of Sellore a
few miles distant, and all about these precincts lay a lovely
quietude of old-world Indian beauty.</p>
<p>A bazaar, yes, where all the many-coloured merchandise of the
Orient was sold in stalls that might have come from some theatre
where Oriental beauty had been studied by observant artists and all
hint of poverty or squalor omitted from the picture. "Theatrically
beautiful" was indeed the first phrase that occurred to Seton, as
he lounged and wandered along the narrow streets, sheltered from
the sunshine which lay hard and brilliant in the open places
outside them. He was looking up, then, at the mighty mosque where
Mahmud Mirza himself worshipped. The camels were winding their way,
laden with bales from the jungle-covered country outside, and here
and there wandered the little mouse-gray bulls, sacred to Shiva,
snatching unforbidden, any dainty that caught their eyes on the
stalls of the merchants.</p>
<p>The people passed him in crowds, but though a dark face here and
there turned in Seton's direction, as a whole they ignored him. He
felt rather like a ghost, present, but not of them. People in
former days had told him of kindly curiosity, or laughing crowds
about the camera, eager to help and share in the fun. There was
nothing of that. They went their way and expected him to go his,
and though there was no open hostility, there was thunder in the
air. Exactly as Revel had warned him, all was changed since the
war. It gave him a curious feeling of helplessness. He could not
tap one of their means of communication. He was like a child among
grown-up people with their secrets to hide. Still, he rejoiced that
he had come. It was true India, the India of the pictures and
dreams of long ago, as truly as Ahmadabad itself, but of an
entirely different type. Bombay, even Delhi and Agra, were nothing
as compared to this, for one who wished to study native life. It
was small enough to be comprehensible, yet perfect of its kind.</p>
<p>The rest house was uncomfortable enough, the beds apparently
stuffed with boulders, and the dinner last night had been a fowl
whose haggard bosom and muscular limbs were discouraging in the
extreme. But it was worth it, a thousand times over, and also,
there was Venetia. He had not seen her yet. A remnant of good sense
compelled him not to thrust himself upon them too soon, to meet
them accidentally and then act according to his reception. He had a
kind of hope that they might be sightseeing this exquisite morning
and their paths cross.</p>
<p>But no. He wandered about until tiffin time, supremely blessed,
but for the lingering suspense that kept him on the watch at every
turn, and then returned, sated with sunshine and colour, to the
remnants of the feast of the night before. And the Fates were to
meet him at the threshold.</p>
<p>A Colonel Gifford was at the table, the only other occupant of
the bungalow, a pleasant-looking man of about forty-five,
apparently in a more communicative mood than he had been the night
before, when a few reserved courtesies had passed between them. He
explained that he had learnt at the palace, where he had been to
announce himself, that Mr. Seton, of Egyptian fame, was the new
arrival.</p>
<p>"Seeing the world?" he asked, lighting his cigar after tiffin,
when they both spread themselves out to rest in the long
wicker-chairs. The rest house was on the edge of the city, and only
a noiseless, barefooted traffic went by in the soft khaki dust.</p>
<p>Seton, too, was communicative. They had discovered a common
acquaintance, and, for 'another thing, he liked the look of the
man&mdash;a keen, worn face, very frank and good-humoured, the kind of
man you could know all about in ten minutes, if you were
observant&mdash;open as the day, he was sure. Gifford, too&mdash;a good old
English name.</p>
<p>"Saw you going about the city. Ever been here before?"</p>
<p>"Never. Only out from Egypt a month or so. Wonderful place,
isn't it?"</p>
<p>"The longer you stay here the more you'll think so. You see,
this is just a bit of the real old India, kept like a curio in a
cabinet. That's why Mahmud Mirza won't have the railway within
twenty miles, and the number of tourists allowed in the city is
fixed at four a month. Wonderful man, Mahmud! A very good specimen
of the ruling prince in India. Indeed, they have a fine record down
from the days of the Mogul emperors."</p>
<p>"You know him personally?"</p>
<p>"Rather! I was detailed to look after him more or less when he
was a youth at the Princes' college, and I often come to have a
look at him. Generally I stay at the palace, but he has some fellow
there with whom he's quite a bit taken up, I believe, and there are
ladies at the guest house."</p>
<p>"And what is he like personally, and what does he do with
himself? I saw the archway of his palace to-day. Magnificent! Like
a frowning old fortress."</p>
<p>"Ah, you should see the inside. I'll get you a chit. He's a fine
fellow in his way. A devout Mohammedan, never perfectly at home
with the infidel. Looks the Amir to the life, dark, tall, with the
look of great race these people have. Educated in England and at
Ajmere and speaks English well."</p>
<p>"It must be rather hard for a man like that to be in tutelage to
us," Seton said meditatively. "I suppose there's a Resident here
who tells him exactly what to do?"</p>
<p>"Well, he's called a Commissioner. Natives call him the
'Kumpsioner Sahib.' But there never has been any difficulty. His
predecessor was a tower of strength to us in the bad time."</p>
<p>"You've been a long time in India, Colonel, I take it. What's
your view of the feeling here now? Any risk of the Mutiny business
again?"</p>
<p>The Colonel looked round cautiously and slightly raised his
voice, as though for the benefit of possible hearers.</p>
<p>"Risk? Oh, no, no! Little flurries on the surface. No more. Yes,
I've been in India more or less all my life. It runs in the family.
We all stick out here. You get to like the life and find it a bit
dull at home. Be sides, things are changed since the war. I was
discussing it with that young fellow who's at the palace now&mdash;he
seems to know his Europe pretty well and more than a bit about
Asia. I should say his head was screwed on the right way."</p>
<p>"Young fellow? You don't by any chance mean Revel?"</p>
<p>"That's his name. A very much all-there specimen. He lives at
the palace and is very much with Mahmud Mirza. As much as an
outsider can be with a real, pukka royalty. Do you know him?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes, rather well in a way. Do tell me what you know and
think of him."</p>
<p>"What I know is nothing. He's very attractive, and I'm told by
the Diwan&mdash;Minister&mdash;I haven't yet seen the Amir&mdash;that he knows
exactly how to please Mahmud Mirza."</p>
<p>"As how?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he's great on Egyptian antiquities, and that's rather a
hobby in the palace. By the way, that ought to get you in. Revel is
said to have a far-away strain of the Mianpur blood in him, too,
and Oriental leanings and tastes. Mahmud Mirza's mother, the Begam,
is a Persian princess, and he thinks so much of his blood that a
drop of it makes a kind of kinship, whoever the owner may be. I
hear that the Begam, a very clever and wonderful old lady, has
accorded audience to Revel, with a pretence of a veil and extremely
sociable."</p>
<p>"By George! What an interesting time he must have," Seton said
enviously.</p>
<p>"I should say! Make interest with him, if you know him, and you
may get a look in. By the way&mdash;those ladies at the guest house;
they can do anything with the Begam. Grant, their name is. Their
uncle, Lord Cheriton, was Commissioner here, and a close friend of
Mahmud Mirza's father, as well as his own. Now, if you got to know
them&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I have the good luck to know them, too," Seton said with
reserve.</p>
<p>"Why, you're in luck's way, indeed. You should see more than
ninety-nine out of a hundred. Especially in view of your Egyptian
discoveries. I prophesy you'll hear from his Highness before
long."</p>
<p>"Will you be my sponsor?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. And as I'm just idling here, as I often do, I shall
have plenty of time at your disposal. Would you like to stroll to
the Hathi Bagh Gardens to day?"</p>
<p>The talk took a wider range after that, and Seton picked up a
lot of interesting knowledge from the Colonel, who knew his own
India like a book. Only his own, and he pretended to no more. India
is not one book, but a library, and one that it would take many
lifetimes to master. They were sitting, much at their ease, when a
tramp of horses was heard, and at a gay speed a gallant cavalcade
came by, led by a princely looking man who rode as though part of
his horse&mdash;a very centaur. His quick, dark eyes swept over Colonel
Gifford and his companion, and he pulled up instantly, halting the
whole cavalcade. At his left hand rode Revel. Instantly the Colonel
was on his feet, saluting, and Seton knew that he saw the ruler of
Mianpur, undistinguished by any splendour except the glorious
emerald that clasped his turban and the perfect horses that formed
his train. He beckoned to Gifford.</p>
<p>"Ah, Colonel Sahib, you here, and not at my guest house? Is that
friendly? When do you come to see me?"</p>
<p>"At your Highness' pleasure. The guest house is occupied by
ladies, and an old campaigner like myself does better here."</p>
<p>"Come this evening. Who is this gentleman?" Seton sprang to
Gifford's side, and was presented in due form as the discoverer of
the Egyptian treasures which had startled the world. Revel nodded
cordially in the background'.</p>
<p>"I consider your visit an honour to my dominions," said Mahmud
Mirza; "and I beg you will come with Colonel Gifford to the palace
when he visits me this evening. We have a few antiquities there,
but nothing to compare with the interest of yours. We are off to
the polo ground now. Will not you two gentlemen follow and see a
chukker? Bring horses!"</p>
<p>He motioned to an aide-de-camp, who rode back hell for-leather
along the way they had come, while the Amir and his suite swept on,
as gallant and chivalrous a picture as you could see, the guard of
cavalrymen with pennons fluttering at their lance heads, and one
and all riding like the wind.</p>
<p>"By George, that's a fine sight! It carries one back to the
Middle Ages. I feel like a dowdy anachronism." cried Seton, craning
out to catch the last brilliant flare of colour as they took the
corner.</p>
<p>"Not bad, and the polo better still. They play the best game in
India here. Worth coming from Europe to see it. I never saw such
ponies anywhere."</p>
<p>And Seton agreed heart and soul when, mounted on black Arabs,
they took up their post of vantage, and the game began. A splendid
sight, indeed, both for skill and fire, Mahmud Mirza easily first
in both. Seton was by no means a despicable hand at polo himself
and would have given his ears to dash into the scrimmage, but even
he was doubtful of holding his own with these perfect cavaliers, to
whom life and limb seemed matters of no account.</p>
<p>At the end of the first chukker, Revel, who was not playing,
drew up and greeted Seton warmly.</p>
<p>"I've been here ten days," he said, "and having a very good
time. You came yesterday? Yes, fine sight, isn't it? He plays
sometimes at night with a luminous ball, as the Emperor Akbar used
to do. That's even better. Each man carries a light, and it's
really nerve-shaking to watch. You must certainly see that."</p>
<p>There was more idle talk in the intervals, for speech was
impossible in the soft thunder of the ponies' hoofs and the frantic
excitement of the win and lose. When it was done, the Amir,
apparently cool as a cucumber, not a fold of his turban awry, got
on his horse again and rode up to the two Englishmen.</p>
<p>"Great game, Amir Sahib!" said the Colonel. "The ponies seem
even better this year than last."</p>
<p>"You can hardly say that of their masters, Colonel&mdash;we all grow
a little older," returned the ruler, looking the very picture of
handsome manhood in its youth. "No doubt Seton Sahib has seen much
better work at Ranelagh. But we do our best. You will both dine at
the palace to-night."</p>
<p>He waved a careless hand, and he and his train clattered and
jingled off, the other two riding slowly back, far behind the
golden dust cloud their swift passage raised as they went.</p>
<p>It was the fitting end to a day of wonders when they entered the
frowning fortress gate of the palace in the velvet dark, lit by
countless torches and the less romantic glare of electric light.
Seton knew his India so little at that time, that he was startled
when they were ushered, with Revel, into a fine European dining
room, furnished with old oak panelling and sideboards in the best
manor-house fashion, the great carved chairs decorated with Mahmud
Mirza's cipher in dim gold, and heavy brocaded curtains over the
long windows. On the walls were portraits of departed rulers, not,
perhaps, of the highest artistic merit, in huge gilt frames, and
over the great oak mantel two spirited pictures of the King-Emperor
and Queen-Empress, in full state costume, each surmounted by an
Imperial crown. But for the motionless Indian servants in their
white and gold, the scene might easily have been some Jacobean hall
in England.</p>
<p>And stranger even than this, the host's chair at the head of the
table was empty, and remained so.</p>
<p>"He never eats with Europeans," said Revel, replying to Seton's
look. "He comes in afterwards, and I am deputed to do the
honours."</p>
<p>He did them very well, and the dinner was perfectly well served,
the plate especially being magnificent and the wines of the best.
Revel and Gifford talking, absorbed Seton's interest. Each knew a
different aspect: of India and each knew it well, though Revel
deferred perpetually to the Colonel's longer experience, setting
his own aside with the utmost grace and courtesy. Like all else he
did, it conveyed the impression of reserved power, and Seton was
inclined to wonder whether, in spite of the difference in years, he
might not know more than the other. The Colonel's English
diffidence might belie him, however, he decided, and clearly his
own part was to listen and pick up what crumbs he might. They all
rose as the coffee came in and Mahmud Mirza followed with his chief
of staff, a fine, venerable-looking man, who spoke no English.</p>
<p>Polite questions and replies, and the host, standing, raised his
glass to the King-Emperor's health, with due response from his
guests, then led the way to the library which still further carried
out the illusion of seventeenth century England.</p>
<p>"But, Colonel, I want to see the gorgeous East," said Seton.
"I've seen this kind of thing in Sussex. Is all the palace like
this?"</p>
<p>"Not a bit of it! Wait till you see the cut-glass bedsteads and
arm-chairs and the gold divans and&mdash;Yes, your Highness. Mr. Seton
certainly hopes for your permission to see the throne room and so
forth."</p>
<p>But the royal eyes were fixed on Seton's ring.</p>
<p>"The little I know about Egypt tells me that is a wonderful
ring," he said.</p>
<p>Seton immediately drew it off and put it in his hand.</p>
<p>"'Thou endest the night,'" translated Revel, stand ing at his
shoulder. "And the singular thing is that it matches my ring in the
inscription. There is not another ancient jewel known with this
inscription."</p>
<p>Mahmud Mirza compared the two.</p>
<p>"This is very surprising," he said. "Have either of them occult
powers? It is certain that some of these rings were worn with that
view. It appears to me to be a talisman."</p>
<p>Revel answered gravely.</p>
<p>"Mine certainly has, your Highness. Of Mr. Seton's I know
nothing."</p>
<p>He took the two rings in his hand and held them while he talked,
giving descriptions of others that were famous, then returned
Seton's, who slipped it upon his finger, Mahmud Mirza asking that
he might be informed if ever it should be for sale, a suggestion
that Seton negatived instantly.</p>
<p>They were shown the Egyptian treasures after this&mdash;a fine
gallery set apart for them and filled with the stern images of gods
and Pharaohs and all the objects that had been their delight in
life and their solace in death. It seemed a strange taste for an
Indian ruler, but there were family reasons for it, his Persian
mother being, as he told Seton, a direct descendant of the Persian
King Darius, who ruled in Egypt. He pointed to several rings and
vases inherited from him and the starting point of the collection.
Darius had adopted the religion of Egypt, he said, and some strange
secrets of its wisdom were preserved in his line. Mr. Revel had
been able to give him the history of some of these objects, and he
hoped for even more light from Seton. His account of the discovery
of the body of the Queen Nefert would be of the utmost
interest.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more cordial or full of promise, and of a type
so new as to be delightful; and Revel, smiling in the background,
had the air of managing the whole occasion and setting it off to
perfection with his own attractions.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>Seton came away, musing deeply. He seemed to have got into a
world of wonders where many strange things might be&mdash;whether hoped
or dreaded, he scarcely knew. He went as one in a dream until
Colonel Gifford guided him through the guarded palace gate, dark
and mysteriously shadowed in the blaze of the full moon.</p>
<p>"Come this way for one of the most wonderful sights in
India."</p>
<p>He guided him down a little street, now hushed for the night,
and so to a flight of broad and very ancient stone steps. Presently
they stood beside a great water balustraded with marble before the
town, but stretching away into the bosom of the night,
moon-blanched and still. Above it on one side rose the stern and
solemn walls of the palace they had just left, and far, far out,
where the moonlight met the darkness, were white marble domes,
floating as if asleep upon its shimmering bosom, exquisitely
beautiful pale shadows, ghost palaces, dream delights to be beheld
in silence.</p>
<p>But a shudder that was more than delight shook Seton.</p>
<p>"I have seen them before," he said in his heart; "in a courtyard
in Cairo."</p>
<p>The air was full of dim enchantments. That sudden recognition
struck a chill among them&mdash;they paled and faded. A cloud drifted
across the moon.</p>
<p>In his sleep that night was no oblivion, but a maze of sinister
figures crossing and recrossing endlessly with dark, averted faces,
on secret errands.</p>
<p>It was next morning, before setting out on his morn ing's walk
that he decided to ask the Colonel about Srinavastri and his
hospital. What did he know of him? He had never lost his feeling of
curiosity about that strange meeting with Revel at the Carnatic in
Bombay.</p>
<p>"Oh, old Gobind Srinavastri! Quite a well-known character.
Enormously rich and very charitable in his own way. Has given away
lacs of rupees. A Hindu of the old type, as bigoted as he can be,
and regards the Mohammedans one and all as children of Shaitan&mdash;he
will have nothing to do with them. Just as well, too. That hatred
between the Hindu and the Mohammedan is the great buttress of our
power in India. Divide and rule&mdash;you know the old Roman maxim."</p>
<p>"Does Srinavastri make no exceptions?" Seton was turning the
Carnatic business over in his mind.</p>
<p>"None. And his caste stands in the way also. I must say, the
Mohammedans repay the compliment with interest. They detest and
despise the Hindus."</p>
<p>"You don't think, then, he would be likely to do business
personally with a Moslem?"</p>
<p>"Not he I Some low-caste clerk would run it. Why, he won't even
see Mahmud Mirza, who naturally would be civil to him because of
the hospital and other benefactions in his state. There's an armed
neutrality, and no more."</p>
<p>"Very odd," said Seton, lost in thought.</p>
<p>"Not a bit odd if you consider the difference of religion,
history, politics, everything. The Hindu has never for gotten the
fact that the Mohammedans conquered India and ruled it under the
Mogul emperors until we stepped in. Resents it still."</p>
<p>"I didn't quite mean that," said Seton, and reached for his sun
helmet. Naturally, he could not explain His promise stood in the
way.</p>
<p>He walked slowly out into the khaki-coloured road with the
lovely minarets and domes of the city cutting the hyacinth sky with
the lines of beauty. The barefoot people went by him softly through
the dust on their unknown occasions, and he neither saw nor heard
them. He was thinking of Revel. Like most healthy-minded men, he
detested everything that savoured of mystery, and it seemed that
nothing but mystery had dogged his steps since that meeting with
Revel at Abuksa. He went over it in his thoughts&mdash;his was not a
swiftly moving mind&mdash;item by item, very carefully. The ring,
Revel's story of the papyrus, his vision of the Museum vaults, the
empty papyrus, the courtyard and Ibn ul Farid, Gobind Srinavastri.
It totted up into consider able puzzledom, yet, taken separately,
every point might be explained satisfactorily&mdash;if one allowed for
some Oriental skill in hypnotism or whatever you chose to call it,
and possibly a little economy of truth, to put it mildly. Still,
Seton knew he hated all that kind of thing; it was as if a mesh, so
fine as to be scarcely perceptible, were delicately winding itself
about his feet. He half wished that he might break free from it
all, going straight off and never seeing or hearing of Revel again.
India was wide, the world wider still. There was room for both of
them and to spare.</p>
<p>Well enough, but for Venetia. Where she was, he must be, unless
and until she drove him from her, and that, he thought, would never
be. He knew her enough now to estimate, better than he had done at
the time, the value of the encouragement she had given him at
Abuksa. Another woman might hint, trifle, and doubt in such a
matter, but not she. Even though she did not understand herself, he
understood her, and knew that hesitation was acceptance, unless
some turn of fate never to be foreseen should dash the cup from his
lips.</p>
<p>So cogitating, he walked slowly along the road under the palms
and tamarind trees, for the city was beautifully wooded and the
Hoti River, now a little shrunk by the summer, flowed through it
under stone bridges finely arched. Before him rose the principal
mosque, the Char Minar, with its magnificent arcades opening into
the interior. The building was so singular that it arrested him at
once. From the four slender minarets at the corners sprang mighty
arches, supporting a roof on which was built a small and exquisite
mosque, sacred to Mahmud Mirza's private worship&mdash;an extraordinary
and beautiful feat of architecture, rising in the majesty of
centuries from the swarming street.</p>
<p>And as he stood looking at it with delight, footsteps came along
the road behind him, and he heard her voice. She was speaking to
Sara and had not seen him. His heart leaped like a boy's. He turned
and went to meet them, rejoicing.</p>
<p>She flushed delicately, but then she was one of the women who
flush at any emotion, and the pale glow was gone in a moment and
left her smiling and composed. He thought the shade of her sun hat
gave her face the last touch of refinement and grace, and the heat
had given a languor to her eyes that stressed their liquid
beauty.</p>
<p>"So here you are!" cried Sara. "I thought you must be about due.
How well you look&mdash;the very picture of health! Do tell us about
your wanderings. We have thought of you so often. Come back with us
to lunch, and then we shall have time."</p>
<p>Of course he accepted, and they strolled through the great
parklike gardens, the glory of Mianpur, by the lesser lake, where
doves coo all day above the lotus flowers and the hedges of
hibiscus and massed bougainvilleas almost daze the eye with
splendid tropic bloom. They sat awhile on a marble bench sheltered
from the heat, and exchanged adventures, and, keenly as he watched,
he could not detect anything more than a little reserve in
Venetia's manner. Revel was spoken of and naturally. They had met
him several times in Mianpur, and the old Begam, Mahmud Mirza's
mother, had spoken of him when they visited her in the zenana.</p>
<p>"She's a really wonderful old lady," said Sara Grant. "I have
known her almost since I was a child and she herself was young. She
knows everything that goes on in every part of that vast rabbit
warren, and uses her tongue like a whip lash to keep them all in
order. She has more influence with Mahmud Mirza than any one and is
his chief adviser, I believe."</p>
<p>"I thought the Mohammedan princes treated their women folk more
as dolls than anything else."</p>
<p>"Some may&mdash;not Mahmud Mirza. He is descended from the great
Mogul emperors of India, and they were never too proud to consult
their women. Besides&mdash;you should see the Begam! Never was any one
less like a doll. She has wonderful long black hair and fierce
black eyebrows&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And a black moustache!" added Venetia. "She may have been
beautiful once&mdash;they say she was&mdash;but one has to take it on
hearsay. A most alarming old lady, and hates all foreigners. You
know she was a Persian princess."</p>
<p>"And why does she see you?"</p>
<p>"Because, as I told you, she doesn't count us as foreigners. We
both speak Hindustani and some Persian, and our uncle was
Commissioner here once and she has known Sara from a child and me
since I was born. He was a great friend of her husband's, Mahmud
Mirza's father, and did him some important services, not the least
of which was that he got our Government to grant him a salute of
twenty-one guns. That counts, you know."</p>
<p>"I can imagine it would," Seton said grimly. "But why does she
see Revel?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he has quite captured her! She has seen him several times
and thoroughly enjoyed a good gossip with him. As she truly says,
if at her age she mayn't enjoy herself, when may she? She was
brimful of his good looks and amusing ways last time we saw her. He
is certainly all things to all men&mdash;a priceless gift."</p>
<p>"She admires Mr. Revel very much," Sara put in. "She says:
'Mashalla! He is a pearl in the eye of beauty, a sword in the eye
of men.' She warned him to go out with his eyes on the ground, lest
he should steal the hearts of those who were peeping at him from
every corner. I've no doubt they were! She told us this herself.
Quaint, isn't it? We go there again next week to see her jewels.
She's very proud of them."</p>
<p>Seton laughed, and then, as a thought struck him:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Mahmud Mirza has never been unfriendly to the British rule, has
he?"</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, no! Strictly correct and on the best terms with the
authorities. He's a striking-looking young man, isn't he? You
should see him in all his splendour as I have in the durbar at
Delhi&mdash;a blaze of magnificence. It's wonderful how Mr. Revel has
won him, too. Any one might envy him his gift of pleasing."</p>
<p>Yes&mdash;under certain conditions, Seton thought, but did not say.
Criticism that might savour of jealousy was much to be avoided. But
supposing this flash and play of colour on the surface were
specially designed to cover secrecies, to dazzle with its glitter
until signs and omens were no longer discernible&mdash;then the real
Revel might be a very different man from the Revel who scattered
delight about him like flowers.</p>
<p>And even as this current of thought tingled through him, another
followed and swept it away. Baseless suspicion, folly, the habit of
watching until the smallest incidents were distorted&mdash;that
accounted for so much and probably for all. It was much easier to
take the happy surface of things for granted in that divine
sunshine, with the jewelled peacocks pacing before them like guests
at a king's festival, and the marble elephants guarding the rosery
flinging up jets of radiant water to catch and imprison the
sunbeams in spray and diamonds. He dismissed it, and when Sara
strolled off to the roses, he caught at the opportunity and asked
Venetia if she had seen Jadrup Gosein. She smiled, as she always
did at his name.</p>
<p>"Yes, twice, and I spoke of you. He said he would see you very
gladly. That you had been in his mind."</p>
<p>"In his mind 2 But he never saw, never heard of me until you
told him! He couldn't have meant that."</p>
<p>"He meant it. Perhaps he will tell you when you meet. You have
only to send a message."</p>
<p>He resolved he would do that instantly. The man who had so
influenced Venetia and Marriott&mdash;He spoke of Marriott to her, and
again she smiled that inward smile.</p>
<p>"I should like to know him. I know he has been here more than
once, but we never had the chance of meeting him. He is a very
interesting man himself, a great lover of ancient India."</p>
<p>A letter from Conway, destined to raise fresh questions awaited
him at the rest house. "After compliments," as the diplomats say,
he dashed into his grievances. Things were still dragging along,
the British and Egyptian Governments fighting over the find.</p>
<p>"I believe"&mdash;wrote Conway&mdash;"that if Queen Nefert had survived,
they would have torn her in pieces between them. I'll never go
exploring again, if I have to sweep a crossing for my living!
There's a rumour flying over Cairo now that the real document was
stolen from the throne in the Museum and was sent to India. Ask
Revel if he has heard anything. And they say that a Persian has
declared it contained not only the history of Queen Nefert's love
affairs with an Egyptian king, but a prophecy about the Bolshies
collaring India. Did you ever hear such rot? Isn't that Cairo all
over?"<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>There was more, but that is all that matters. Seton read it
carelessly at first&mdash;then closely. Revel! Was his mind never to be
at ease about Revel? It recalled that horrid affair at Shepheard's,
his dream of the Museum, his fainting fit, Revel's presence.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of this that he slept villainously badly
that night, and in a brief sleep before dawn dreamed the whole
thing over again, but now with the addition that Revel glided
through it all, menacing, sinister, a figure of dark possibilities.
He woke, furious with himself, in the morning, and cursed Conway's
letter, which had started him off again on these bewilder ing
uncertainties. Still, he would tell Revel' when they met what
Conway had said. And meanwhile he sent his message to Jadrup
Gosein.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>Having sent the message of request before him, Seton started
next morning in a dewy quiet to his interview with Jadrup Gosein.
Life begins early in India, and it was scarcely five o'clock as he
rode slowly under the neems and tamarinds and saw the thin smoke
rising blue from many small homes where the morning meal was being
prepared, after due sacrifice and worship. It was a day of divine
beauty, still and golden as an antechamber of heaven, the leaves
diamonded with a frail glitter of dew, the world in a great silence
drinking at the pure chalice of the dawn. Presently the silence
stirred into happy life. The palm fronds hung on blue air like
seaweed in a translucent ocean, and through them darted flights of
little green parrots like the fish of that sleeping sea. The "Seven
Sisters" chattered, the bell birds echoed their eternal note one to
the other, all rejoicing in the returning stride of the Golden God
over the horizon.</p>
<p>It was a place of quiet, and the more so because a voice was
speaking within, words unknown, the words of a most ancient
language, but charged like a great music with power. He would have
delayed, but the man led onward, and thus they came into a very
small courtyard, surrounded by whitewashed walls above the height
of a tall man and shaded by boughs of the trees outside. No place
could be simpler or poorer. It was neatly sanded, and at one side
sat an old man with a white robe thrown about him, a white turban,
bare-footed&mdash;a sight to be seen any day and anywhere in India. A
young man, grave-faced and reverent, stood at his shoulder, looking
calmly at the advancing stranger. It was nothing new to him&mdash;many
men, of all ranks, from the highest to the lowest, had crossed the
little sanded floor and had gone away the richer. For himself, he
lived and breathed in that clear air and knew no other. He salaamed
and brought a small European chair for the visitor as the old man
raised his head from the book he held and looked his guest in the
face. It was then that Seton became aware that whatever Jadrup
Gosein might be, his face was the perfection of human beauty for
the eye that can pierce the unessential to the soul. It was like
the golden image of an ancient god seeing the worlds he had made in
their archetypal beauty, even as he had conceived them, and
rejoicing therein in a calm more blissful than any joy. But who can
describe the soul's work upon the body, the delicate, imperceptible
chiselling of great thought and emotion which refine away the flesh
until it is but a lamp through which the indwelling spirit may
shine? It seemed there was nothing at all left but that hovering
beauty, nothing to distract eye or thought from the Indweller, the
Essential. It seemed to Seton that never before had he seen a
<i>man</i> face to face.</p>
<p>"You are come, my son," he said. "Be seated and let us speak of
glad things."</p>
<p>Nothing could have been more unexpected. Seton had prepared an
explanation&mdash;allusions to Venetia, to Marriott, hopes, apologies.
They vanished. He sat down, as a son sits in the presence of his
father, and waited the next words in content. The old man spoke
English&mdash;the English achieved by reading great books&mdash;spoke it
freely and masterfully.</p>
<p>"I have expected you. Your longing came before you, telling me
your need. You desire to find yourself. Is this not so?"</p>
<p>In profound amazement at words which he had never yet spoken to
human being, Seton replied:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I desire to find God."</p>
<p>"And in the discords of the life about you He is lost?"</p>
<p>"So deeply lost that I have lost belief in His existence."</p>
<p>"Then have I not said truly that you desire to find yourself,
for thus only can you find God?"</p>
<p>"Myself? What am I?" Seton said, with a tinge of bitterness. The
austere inwardness of the eyes which met his constrained him to a
stark candour. "Is that all?" he added. "All you can tell me&mdash;to
find myself? But I am not worth the finding! The teaching of
Christianity is to lose yourself. That seems nearer my need. I am
sick of my own follies."</p>
<p>"That also is true. But how can a man lose what he has never
found? Find yourself first, my son; and since you are a part of the
Divine, though the Divine is not you, you will, in finding
yourself, lose yourself, and so find what you seek, and with
it&mdash;the Peace."</p>
<p>Seton leaned forward. Here was a flaw. He would not be
subjugated, he would reply, argue, repel.</p>
<p>"Is not that a contradiction? If I am It, It is me."</p>
<p>"The wave is of the ocean, but the ocean is not the wave. But
you, no doubt, have studied many things at your University. Have
you ever studied your self?"</p>
<p>"Never. I felt that the less a man thinks of and dissects
himself the better."</p>
<p>"You think, then, that all life should be objective, not
inward?"</p>
<p>"I have certainly thought so."</p>
<p>"And yet you seek God? Where then?"</p>
<p>"In life."</p>
<p>"And life has thwarted you by its injustice and cruelty, and He
is lost?"</p>
<p>"Lost."</p>
<p>There was a pause. The sun, rising higher through the leafy
bowers, made a shining mist of myriad particles of gold in the
little courtyard, beautiful with the shadows of floating leaves. As
Seton faced the east this shining dazzled him and at the same time
seemed to light up a spiritual perception which had hitherto slept
within him. He gathered himself, and sat re-collected and
aware.</p>
<p>"Then if you lost Him by looking outward, is it not reasonable
to look inward before you abandon the search? Is it not in virtue
of having done this that the wise man, who does not blind himself
to the daily discords of the world about him, can gaze on them
undisturbed, knowing that they, in spite of their loud insistence,
are but as mist rising from the marshes at evening fall? The time
will come, my son&mdash;it is indeed nearing rapidly&mdash;when you will look
at these wreathing mists with interest, nay, with amusement at
their portentous shapes, deceived no longer by your eyes and
ears."</p>
<p>"If that could be&mdash;But how?"</p>
<p>"By taking the Bow of great Love and the Arrow of Wisdom&mdash;by
knowledge and experience. By finding the right way of life and
walking faithfully in it. And if this seem small to you, remember
that heights of experience must be reached before the vast
conception of the truth can be absorbed by any man, and that the
average man is incapable of receiving it. Have patience, there
fore. Do certain things, and the next step will become a little
clearer, and, that attained, the next. And though you cannot as yet
see, you will in time know that the mists rolling away disclose an
untroubled heaven and an eternal sunshine. This is certain."</p>
<p>There was another pause. Then Seton said, with hesitation:&mdash;</p>
<p>"And can you give me such a rule of life?"</p>
<p>"Most certainly. A rule that may be practised in the market
place as in the forest. And as your spiritual forces expand, you
will gain vision, and vision is peace. It is because you were not
wholly blind in a former existence that here and now you desire the
higher. This is your reward. Deserve a greater, and you will
receive full measure."</p>
<p>"Then am I to suppose that you can see what befell me in a
former existence, if such there was?"</p>
<p>He would have disbelieved the assertion fiercely had it not been
for certain things in the man's look which compelled belief. For
when the voice authentic speaks, the soul must hearken whether it
will or no, being of the same immortal kindred.</p>
<p>"My son, I have a gift. All, I do not know. Some has reached me.
And in a strange country of cold gray seas and beaten rocks, where
a great fortress clings to a precipice hidden in spray and mist,
rising from tossing abysses beneath, with white birds wailing about
it, I behold you living a stern life, but in certain matters a
dutiful and courageous, your consciousness unsunned by beams of the
Divine, but faithful to a little. You can not remember but one day
you will know, and if you recall a certain day when you beheld and
loved that home of your heart, my words will reach you."</p>
<p>Seton sat rigid. The castle that hung to the crags of Morven had
passed from his people. Once, long ago, he had visited the ruins,
half hidden in spray and mist from the boiling Atlantic abysses
beneath. He had stood there, with the crying of the sea mews about
him that seemed the crying of his own heart for things that had
been a part of him, now dead and vanished, unreal as the cloudy
shapes that veiled the mountains behind it. He had never forgotten
that day and the mute appeal of the deserted home of men for love
and memory, the dead voices that death cannot silence. He never
spoke of it&mdash;could not, for it lay beneath, or above, the plane of
speech, an encysted grief&mdash;his own.</p>
<p>He stared dumbly at Jadrup Gosein. The old man looked into his
eyes with calm too deep for a smile, yet with all its
sweetness.</p>
<p>"Let us talk together with trust, my son," he said, "And come
when you will, or rather, when you can, for there is close at hand
a trial and a test wherein your manhood will be tried to the
uttermost. And since the knowledge that I would share with you is a
sword and a shield for others as for yourself, come freely, for the
clouds are gathering."</p>
<p>Before that look, that warning, something in Seton's heart
seemed to soften, to melt, to dissolve in warm human sympathy. He
drew nearer to Jadrup Gosein, looking up with a hope
unutterable.</p>
<p>"Teach me!" he said.</p>
<p>They talked until the sun stood over the little court yard, and,
to aid the shielding of the boughs, the chela spread an awning of
canvas above them, and still they talked, the one confessing, the
other hearing and counselling with untiring patience.</p>
<p>As Seton stood outside at last, he remembered the words of
Marriott&mdash;"I have heard a man say to Jadrup Gosein, 'Is that all?'
I have said it myself. But suddenly it dawns upon you that a door
is broken open, and you have stepped out into the fourth
dimension." True. He felt like a man taken to the heart of a god,
and restored to earth with new thoughts, emotions. A new
birth&mdash;that was what the old phrase meant, meaningless then,
surcharged with meaning now. And so simple that it seemed
incredible he should ever have been ignorant. The way lay before
him. He had even taken the first steps long ago, although
unconsciously.</p>
<p>Onward&mdash;onward.</p>
<p>Not even to Venetia could he speak of that breaking of dreams.
He told her of the meeting and thanked her. And she was silent,
with the silence of perfect comprehension. He went again and yet
again, to the House of Knowledge. It was as though a thing familiar
had become divine in the utterance.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>It was a very curious and characteristic room in which the Begam
received Sara and Venetia a week later, a large cool hall with
closely latticed windows open to the faint breeze that blew off the
lake, and furnished with great divans covered with exquisite
Persian and Indian brocades and cushions stiff with gold and
embroideries. The hangings were such as great queens might choose
for a coronation robe, but before each divan stood an ordinary
round table, covered with a European cloth of the most ordinary
fringed tapestry, and on all these tables and in every available
corner were European clocks, ticking so loudly as to form an
accompaniment to the Begam's remarks. There were cuckoo clocks,
mechanical clocks with marionette figures that danced in and out at
the quarters; there was a clock where Time with his scythe mowed
down each hour as it showed its innocent head in the shape of a
flower, and there were erections of gold and crystal that filled
the air with silvery chimes, the more frequent because every clock
went at its own sweet will and kept up no sort of connection with
the rest.</p>
<p>"It is the sole duty of one slave to wind them," announced the
Begam with becoming pride as they were admired. "Many indeed are
new in this last year. Behold the elephant who trumpets the hours
and the driver who attends him! It is true the Faith forbids
images, but the Prophet&mdash;may Allah honour his face in paradise&mdash;was
gracious to the weakness of women. Be seated, delights of my
heart." She pointed to two glittering cut-glass arm-chairs,
decorated with pine apple knobs of dazzling brilliance and
cushioned with gold and blue brocade.</p>
<p>The old lady was short, and immensely stout, and as she sat
embedded in cushions, a splendid robe of silk and a short coat of
mulberry satin flowered with gold seemed quite inadequate to
contain her overflowing outlines. She wore a curious cap of gold
and jewels, stiffened into a kind of peaked diadem in front, and a
gold gauze veil flowing over her abundant gray-streaked hair, which
fell in two thick tails, braided with jewels, below her waist&mdash;a
romantic dress, no doubt, for a young beauty, but scarcely suited
to the Begam's years. Her ponderous face was full of shrewdness and
humour, and the black brows could frown or smile with an
astonishingly quick transition from one mood to the other. She had
risen and salaamed charmingly as the two sisters were ushered in,
for the moment a great princess.</p>
<p>"You are welcome, Miss Sahibs, a thousand times welcome!" she
cried, in a hearty guttural which told of years of good living.
"Laili, where are the garlands for the necks of my heart's
children? Run, fetch them with speed. Our old custom to be forgot!"
She turned and continued, "Here in the seclusion of the zenana talk
is as refreshing to the soul as roses to the nose. Be seated in
these two arm-chairs and allow Laili to put on these pearl slippers
that your feet may rest. Is it possible you walked across the
courtyards? <i>Barik Allah</i> (Blessing of Allah)! Such little
feet, and to walk so far! Very wonderful are the women of the
Feringhis."</p>
<p>Cigarettes were offered in approved European fashion, while the
Begam enjoyed her own chilum like a man, inhaling the scented smoke
with the utmost enjoyment. It did not in the least, however,
interrupt her flow of talk. Sara and Venetia, who knew her ways,
settled themselves back in their glittering seats and prepared to
be amused.</p>
<p>"And the King-Emperor is well, and the Empress (this was the
invariable beginning)? Allah be praised! Wondrous are His
blessings. And the Shahzada (the Prince)? It is the power of God!
And so you are come again to see the old woman, Miss Sahibs? It
makes my face to shine to have your company, and that of the
beautiful Miss Sahib, who is indeed a consumer of hearts. It is
known to Allah that if my son sees such beauty, the ladies of his
palace will please him no more!"</p>
<p>This was, of course, a mere compliment, and to be received as a
flower of speech only. Venetia then tendered an offering, a
beautiful box of European candies, for the Begam's sweet tooth was
known to all her world. She threw up her hands in exaggerated
astonishment.</p>
<p>"In the name of the Most Merciful and Compassionate, what a
gift! May your condescension never decrease! Wah, wah! It is
accepted. Laili, call Gulbadan Begam (Queen Rose-Body), that she
also may savour this honey of delight."</p>
<p>The young wife of Mahmud Mirza was here ushered in with some
ceremony, which, however, soon collapsed into ease, and she curled
up on a divan, devouring candies and listening languidly enough. A
lovely girl, black haired as night, with a golden fruit-face most
delicately narrowing to the chin, her mouth like a crimson
pomegranate bud, and hands and feet fine and small as a fairy's.
Almost a child to look at, but for the stormy dark eyes with their
hidden world of passion and pain.</p>
<p>"And will you see the jewels again, children of my soul?" said
the Begam, with her mouth full of sugar plums. "Do I forget your
pleasures? May the stoned devil remember me when I do! And there
are new ones since you beheld, splendid as the treasures of
Suleiman, son of Daood. Laili, delay not, go fetch Maryam Khanum
and bid her instruct the keeper of the jewels&mdash;and delay not,
according to your sinful custom!"</p>
<p>Laili fled like an arrow from the bow and the jewels were
presently brought in&mdash;the famous emeralds, known to the
connoisseurs of all the capitals, great table emeralds, lakes of
pure green, set flat in heavily chased gold, and the embossed
pendant the largest, an inch every way. The pigeons' blood rubies
from Burma came next, and the mighty diamond known as the Glory of
the Universe. Venetia, who had seen most of them before&mdash;for the
jewels were a favourite amusement of the zenana&mdash;handled them
reverently, though it must be owned their splendours almost paled
before the glass knobs of the chair in which she sat, cunningly
illuminated by small hidden electric lights at the back!</p>
<p>But the ancient jewels in the marvellously wrought settings were
really interesting, especially as the Begam threw in romantic
histories attaching to each one of them.</p>
<p>"And this," she said finally, poising in the air a great chain
of strung black opals flashing sinister flame from their mysteries,
"came from the Great Emperor, the Conqueror of the world, who ruled
in Russia two hundred and fifty years since. May the Peace be upon
him, though an infidel! He sent an embassy to the Mogul emperors,
the forefathers of my son, with precious jewels from the Ural
Mountains, and this was the least. The rest are in the palace
treasury. Is it not beautiful, Miss Sahib? But it is an evil
thing."</p>
<p>Beautiful indeed, but ominous, Venetia thought. Laili put it
about Sara's neck, that it might be the better seen, and all
exclaimed in delight.</p>
<p>"Jewels remain when empires vanish," said the shrewd old lady.
"Love also! Therefore, secure jewels, Miss Sahib, as I have done,
to comfort your old age. In Russia now the base-born rule, and the
emperors are no more. Have you heard talk of this new beauty who
pulls the heartstrings of Orsinoff, who rides the country with whip
and bit? They tell me she is the wonder of the age, and none knows
whence she comes. Have you not heard?"</p>
<p>Venetia saw the younger Begam alert, her eyes brilliant in a
moment.</p>
<p>"No. Pray tell us. Your Highness has all the know ledge! Can
there be beauty more beautiful than the Lady Rose-Body?" she said,
indicating the young wife crouching on the divan.</p>
<p>"Thu!" cried the Begam, spitting on the ground. "She is but as
the handmaiden of the Russian beauty, who is the moon of the world
and the burner of hearts. But what should a Miss Sahib know of the
loveliness that melts the hearts of men like water! Lamb of my
heart, you are young and foolish!"</p>
<p>Venetia digested the rebuke while Sara implored the old lady to
continue, which she did with immense relish.</p>
<p>"Orsinoff&mdash;may his face be cold before Allah!&mdash;was plundering a
palace of one of the princes, four months since&mdash;I have it from
Inayet Khan, who came down the passes a month past&mdash;and there in
the deserted palace, seated alone, he found this girl, and took her
to be his. Her hair lay on the ground as she sat, and her face was
heart-shaped, and her great eyes were like lakes of blackness, and
the beauty of her mouth was like the flower of the rose-apple, and
her teeth were more white and even than the pearls on the knees of
my daughter. Tall she was and graceful as a swaying willow. And
before Orsinoff, whom all view with terror, she neither abased her
eyes nor feared, but met him like a queen."</p>
<p>"It sounds like a romance of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>," said
Sara, enjoying the old lady's gusto.</p>
<p>"Not Scheherazade herself told such a tale!" was the rejoinder.
"But hear further. He married her, for her pride bent to necessity,
and this is the way of women, but, as is also their way, she only
stooped to conquer, and it is the word of Inayet Khan and of all
who know that the man is as a child in her hands, and is but the
wax she presses with her own image for a seal. Therefore, it is
she, and she only, that rules Russia."</p>
<p>"She must be a woman nearly as clever as yourself, Hazrat
(Majesty)."</p>
<p>The old lady chuckled consumedly at this.</p>
<p>"A few things I know, a few things I have seen, and the hearts
of men are not unknown to me. But though I was a comely girl, I had
not the sword of this woman's beauty in my hand. When they oppose
her will, she has but to smile and&mdash;ya Allah&mdash;it is done. This,
Miss Sahib, is a very great power over the very enemies of
Orsinoff. She has thus drawn the teeth and cut the claws, and they
follow her like tame cats. Would I were young and beautiful again!
There is no joy like power! Out on the women who cannot enchant
their husbands!" She cast a vindictive glance at Gulbadan.</p>
<p>"Before your Highness all tremble!" said Venetia politely. "What
would you have more?"</p>
<p>"A Miss Sahib cannot tell what I would have more!" cried the
Begam, who invariably put Venetia in her right place, worlds below
that of a wife and mother. "Her day will come and then she will
understand. But to resume. The marvel is that none knows this
woman's name. She said no more than that she was a companion to the
princess they had killed, and since her people were all dead, why
speak their perished name? Natalia&mdash;that is what they call her, and
Inayet Khan reports that Orsinoff himself knows no more. Ya Allah!
A man will take a dog to his bosom if it be beautiful! But since
Inayet Khan knows I love to hear and to tell, he brought for my
acceptance a&mdash;how do you say it?&mdash;a sun-picture of the beauty, that
my eyes may feed and be satisfied. Bring it hither, Laili."</p>
<p>Laili, a slim brown creature robed in crimson and green, fled
again obedient, and in a moment a fine photograph of unusual size
was in Sara's hand. Venetia leaned over her as she unwrapped it
from the silk it had travelled in to the Begam's hands. They
expected a corpulent, <i>caf&eacute; chantani</i> type of beauty at best,
dark browed and sensuous. Both stared in astonishment. In a great
chair, richly carved with the dead symbols of imperial
power&mdash;doubtless a possession of the ruined dynasty Orsinoff had
succeeded&mdash;sat a young woman, pale, with large calm eyes fixed on
some thought beyond the reach of the artist who had pictured her.
Her long hair, unbound, fell in two solemn rivers of blackness to
the ground on either side of her marble face. The curled lashes
shadowed the eyes with heavy darkness, her beautiful mouth was firm
and sad as Destiny, the hands resting lightly on the arms of the
chair were exquisitely fragile and fine. She wore a simple flowing
dress of some Eastern stuff, clasped at the bosom with an Egyptian
scarab set between the widespread wings of the Egyptian Mother
Goddess, Mut&mdash;familiar to all who know the art of Egypt. No picture
was ever more innocent of adornment. None ever more arresting.
Underneath was written in a clear, small handwriting,
"Natalia."</p>
<p>"Wonderful!" said Sara at length. "I never saw a more exquisite
face. Sad, to a degree, but no wonder! There is black tragedy in
that woman's life. It is written all over her face."</p>
<p>"Did I not say so!" cried the Begam. "But, protection of Allah,
what beauty! The perfection of the Creator's handiwork. This is a
woman indeed! Pity that He is not more lavish with His gifts, say
I! If all women were like her, no one of them would hold the sword
of destruction in her hand. As to this one, she could let loose the
hordes of Russia upon the world to-morrow, if she so willed. The
men about her are mad as Mejnoon for love. Beauty like this is
mischief incarnate."</p>
<p>"Is her influence on Orsinoff said to be good or bad, Hazrat?"
asked Venetia. Even while she spoke she could not take her eyes
from the face, exquisite and heart-moving in its tragic calm.</p>
<p>"Inayet Khan reports that the talk is of great events stirring,
so that men hold their breath, but as yet none know what her share
in it may be. Coffee, Laili, and my offerings for the Miss
Sahibs."</p>
<p>The thick black coffee was brought, and a little gold tray
filled with trinkets that the guests might choose for themselves.
This choice was courteously refused with overflowing thanks, and
the Begam herself chose and presented to each a pierced gold case
containing a bottle of attar of roses, the cover set with small
turquoises and garnets. Profuse acknowledgments were made, which
the Begam waived off, superior.</p>
<p>"What is this between friends? There is no strength nor power
but in the High, the Great, to give, and this is but a grain of
dust!"</p>
<p>She actually rose and waddled a few steps to the door in their
honour as they prepared to go, and still Venetia delayed.</p>
<p>"The lamb of my soul has a wish unsatisfied! Let her speak, and
it is done. <i>Barik Allah</i>&mdash;blessings of Allah, we are not so
poor but that we can gratify a friend!" said the Begam graciously.
"Fetch again the tray of trinkets, Laili, that the Miss Sahib may
choose."</p>
<p>"Highness, it is not that&mdash;far from it!" Venetia said earnestly.
"Your generosity is bottomless as the ocean! It is&mdash;if my prayer
may be heard, that I may make a picture of that beautiful face. The
sun-pictures do not give the tints of lip and cheek, and the face
is but a dead rose. May I do this as a gift for your Highness? I
have a little skill with the brush."</p>
<p>"Excellent, excellent!" clapping her hands. "Wrap it up, Laili,
in a covering to protect it and give it to the Miss Sahib, whose
knowledge is like that of Aflatoun (Plato)! Now depart in the Peace
of Allah, guests of my heart, and in His safety return shortly to
bless mine eyes."</p>
<p>Amid profuse adieux, they departed, not daring to remove the
heavily scented garlands until they reached the guest house and
sank into luxurious European chairs. A cut-glass arm-chair is more
splendid than restful, and an hour with the Begam as four with a
lesser woman, so ceaseless was her flow of conversation.</p>
<p>"She's a dear old thing!" said Sara, looking kindly at the
perfume bottle; "but I really think half an hour is as much as I
can stand in a general way. Did you ever see such jewels? Those
emeralds!"</p>
<p>"Wonderful! But this photograph and the story were what I found
most thrilling. What a face! What can be the history behind it? Did
you notice Gulbadan's look of jealousy? Poor little thing! Lucky
the beauty is not here."</p>
<p>She had unwrapped the photograph and was looking at it
again.</p>
<p>"Where's your magnifying glass, Sara? I want to see her scarab
better. It looks to me like the one Uncle Cheriton gave the Museum.
I suppose it was among the imperial treasures. I like those
wonderful narrow out spread wings. Are they diamonds?"</p>
<p>The glass was found and Venetia studied the portrait. Suddenly
she laid it down.</p>
<p>"Sara! Unless I'm a perfect idiot, that inscription is the same
as Miles Seton's ring. Though I can't read the hieroglyphs, I think
they look very much like the others. Let us send for him!"</p>
<p>They did, and two hours later he came, eager as a boy because he
had been summoned before the appointed meeting. They were sitting
in the softly shaded verandah that overhung an arm of the marble
tank, and the west was blushing before the sun-setting, the lotus
flowers dreaming asleep in the rosy water.</p>
<p>"This doesn't mean, I hope, that you don't want me to-morrow,"
he began. "I waited outside the palace gates in hopes of catching
you as you came out of the zenana, and I don't know now how I
missed you."</p>
<p>"Really? No, of course we want you to-morrow, but Venetia has
something to show you, and she never can wait."</p>
<p>He turned with interest.</p>
<p>"A photograph," she said. "But though the woman is so beautiful,
that isn't the point. She's wearing a scarab which strikes me as
very like your ring, though I believe it's modern. Look! Inayet
Khan brought the picture to the Begam from Russia."</p>
<p>She put it in his hand and sat watching him triumphantly.
Indeed, she thought herself exceedingly clever to have noticed the
likeness, and expected nothing but praise and astonishment. The
astonishment was hers, however. Seton went dead white; the picture
slid from his hand. He stooped and picked it up mechanically.
Silence.</p>
<p>"It is some one he knows and cares for!" was the thought that
flashed through Venetia's mind. With rather a forced smile, she
said slowly: "Don't you admire her? I never saw a more beautiful
woman. Sara thinks so, too."</p>
<p>Sara looked keenly at him. No mysteries for her where Venetia
was concerned!</p>
<p>"Do you know her?" she asked curtly.</p>
<p>He found voice at last, but not his usual one. It sounded
strained and odd.</p>
<p>"Know her? You won't believe what I'm going to say, for I can't
believe it myself. This is the Queen Nefert, as I saw her in the
tomb chamber. Then she was dead. Now she is alive. That is
all."</p>
<p>"Good heavens! Impossible!" cried Sara. "It's one of these
amazing likenesses, but surely&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Of course it's no more." Seton was recovering himself. "But a
more astonishing likeness I never saw. It isn't only the
likeness&mdash;The whole <i>effect</i> is the same, if you know what I
mean. I often wished you could have seen what we saw. Now you know.
Only the jewels are gone."</p>
<p>"The scarab!" Venetia reminded him.</p>
<p>He caught up the magnifying glass now and looked eagerly at the
photograph. Then at his ring.</p>
<p>"'Thou endest the night,'" he read, almost in a whisper, and
laid down the glass.</p>
<p>Silence again. Presently:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Good God! What is a man to think?"</p>
<p>Neither of them disturbed his thoughts for a few moments-if
indeed he could be said to think, so confused was his brain. It
must surely be illusion, a dream that would vanish at the touch of
reality. At last he roused himself.</p>
<p>"How did you get it? Forgive my amazement, and tell me the
story. I suppose quite an ordinary one and this Natalia is just
some new actress. Perhaps in the eternal round of being, the same
face must recur sometimes. One would like to know the facts."</p>
<p>Venetia told him all they had heard from the Begam, and he
listened with ever-growing amaze. Then, bethinking himself, he
pulled out his notebook and showed them the rough duplicate of the
sketch Conway had made of the dead queen. Though very imperfect, it
left Venetia and Sara silent with astonishment. The coincidence of
likeness and attitude was enough, but, taken with the scarab, it
was overwhelming.</p>
<p>"You are sure&mdash;sure of the scarab?" asked Venetia searchingly.
"How would it be to send for Mr. Revel? He knows them both so well.
And then there is his own&mdash;"</p>
<p>Seton evolved this rapidly. There could be no concealment.
Revel, in the palace, in touch with the Begam, would certainly see
the photograph, if he had not seen it already. As well sound him as
not. On the other hand, he wished to do nothing that would bring
Revel into the company of the Grants. There was a deep instinct
that cried "Beware!" and he would not thwart it.</p>
<p>"That's a good suggestion. I haven't met him for a week, and I
want him for another reason," he said, rising. "I'll see him, and
you shall hear everything that happens. There may be nothing to it,
but it's curious, and you never can tell. I'll take the utmost care
of the picture, Miss Venetia."</p>
<p>He had quite recovered his composure now.</p>
<p>"Do!" she said laughing. "The Begam will have me bowstrung if
anything happens to it, and, besides, I want to copy it."</p>
<p>Seton went off, and straight to the palace guard house to ask if
Revel could be seen. A fine old officer was on duty, who knew a few
words of English and told him that Revel Sahib was boating on the
lake with Inayet Khan.</p>
<p>"If it pleases the Presence, a boat shall be sent."</p>
<p>"No, no. Ask him to come to the rest house as soon as it is his
pleasure."</p>
<p>And the stately old man salaamed and saluted. Inayet Khan! Then
certainly Revel would have the latest news from Russia.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p>It was nine o'clock that night when Revel rode up through the
moonlight and dismounted by the bungalow, tethering his horse to
the gatepost. India had mysteriously Orientalised the man, and he
looked a slim and splendid young Eastern in his smartly tied
turban, as he strode up, spurred, to the verandah. Seton, watching
from behind the bougainvillea blossoms, noted this, and was subtly
glad. That dark-browed beauty was the mark of a division that cut
to the very soul of things. He had no desire now to approach
Revel.</p>
<p>He rose, however, and went out to meet the guest, and led him to
the verandah, where the long chairs and the long drinks were in
readiness. Colonel Gifford was spending the evening with Mahmud
Mirza, to discuss a tiger-shooting expedition at the Hizar hunting
palace, and they had the place to themselves.</p>
<p>Revel lit the proffered cigar, and apologised with all his usual
courtesy.</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry to have delayed you, but I could not get away
until after dinner. Mahmud Mirza wanted me even then to stay and
discuss the hunting business. What is it, Mr. Seton?"</p>
<p>"Have you seen this photograph?" He pulled the lamp nearer
Revel's elbow.</p>
<p>"Certainly. The Begam showed it to me. It is this woman who
seems to be coming rapidly to the front of Russian politics. Very
handsome woman, don't you think so? She has only been heard of
lately."</p>
<p>"Very. But what interests me, is this. Look here!" He laid
Conway's sketch in Revel's hand. The latter regarded it calmly.</p>
<p>"You mean&mdash;Oh, I see! Yes, the pose is very much the same. How
very odd! Has the sketch been reproduced anywhere?"</p>
<p>"Nowhere. But it is much more than the pose. The likeness is
perfect."</p>
<p>"You don't say so! That is very remarkable. But come, Mr. Seton,
the beautiful Natalia must have seen that sketch somewhere, and
posed accordingly. She saw the likeness, and it has suited
her&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;style. Women are quick in that way."</p>
<p>"I tell you," Seton repeated obstinately, "it has <i>not</i>
been reproduced. She could not have seen it any more than she can
have shaped her face into the likeness. But there's more to it than
that. Have you examined the scarab?"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;beyond thinking it a handsome ornament, set in those wings
of Mut."</p>
<p>"Look at it now."</p>
<p>He pushed the magnifying glass across the table. Revel
scrutinised the photograph keenly and curiously.</p>
<p>"'Thou endest the night,'" he read aloud. "I own this is a very
strange coincidence. We shall have to wise our opinion as to the
rarity of this inscription. We now know of three. But I believe
this is a copy."</p>
<p>Seton was about to exclaim, but checked himself resolutely.</p>
<p>"Could you tell me," he asked composedly, "what is known of this
woman?"</p>
<p>With equal composure Revel repeated the Begam's story.</p>
<p>"I believe no more is known," he added. "The ignorant Russians
declare that she has some charm which makes her irresistibly
beautiful. Inayet Khan told me she harangues the troops, and with
an eloquence that no one can resist. She speaks three European
languages perfectly."</p>
<p>"Does no one know where she comes from?"</p>
<p>"They say not. She was found by Orsinoff in Prince Zouroff's
palace on the Volga when it was plundered. Every one else was dead
or fled. Orsinoff may know, but no one is likely to ask him."</p>
<p>"Is it known at all what she is driving at with Orsinoff in
public affairs?"</p>
<p>Revel laughed lightly.</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing of any consequence, I gather. The usual hot-air
stuff about Russia ruling the world and imposing her codes on all
the rest of mankind. Nothing in it at all! A woman as pretty as
that may say what she pleases."</p>
<p>He flicked the ash off his cigar and looked at his watch.</p>
<p>"I wonder," said Seton thoughtfully, "if it strikes you as
strangely as it does me, that a woman with the face of the Queen
Nefert should have chosen the queen's inscription?"</p>
<p>"Did you ever know for certain it belonged to the queen?" Revel
countered neatly.</p>
<p>"No&mdash;no! But the place where I found it, certainly suggested the
idea."</p>
<p>"The place?"</p>
<p>But Seton was silent. That was not for Revel's ears. The latter
rose to go.</p>
<p>"If you want me no more, I will get back to Mahmud Mirza. I
believe he intends to ask you to be one of the hunting party ."</p>
<p>"Very good of him. But before you go&mdash;Do you think the situation
is worse or better, in India?"</p>
<p>"Better. Infinitely better. There is growing up again the warm,
kindly feeling toward the British Government. Of course, the
personal liking for men who work the machinery in India has never
died out, but the other is coming back too. I hear a great deal in
the palace and can answer for that. After all, why shouldn't it?
These people appreciate justice and care for them as well as any
one else, and they know what they owe to your Government."</p>
<p>"'Your?' And what is yours, Mr. Revel?"</p>
<p>"Mine?" The clear dark eyes looked straight into his. "My
grandmother was Persian, my mother Greek, my father English. How do
you define me?"</p>
<p>He turned laughing away, and Seton could scarcely press the
question. Yet once more he detained him. This time to speak of
Conway's letter. He read the passage about the lost document aloud,
casting keen glances at his listener to see how he took it. With
becoming interest, nothing more.</p>
<p>"Cairo is always a hot-bed of gossip. It may not be a bad guess
as to the contents of the document. I have always believed it
contained the queen's story. As to Russia, that is obviously
inspired by the horrors going on there now. There is nothing in
that. The idea of the document being in India is as reasonable as
any other, and might easily be true. But I see no evidence of it,
do you?"</p>
<p>Seton, baffled as always, admitted he saw none. Could Revel name
any one in India likely to be interested?</p>
<p>"I could name dozens. This is the land of occult beliefs and
superstitions, and, as an antiquity, no doubt Mahmud Mirza himself
would covet it. But I have heard not a word at the palace. I'll
keep my ears open, however, and you shall know if I hear anything
at all. Remember me to Mr. Conway."</p>
<p>That was all. A minute later and his horse was cantering down
the road. He turned and waved his hand as he went.</p>
<p>Seton sat there in the moonlight. He had much to think of.</p>
<p>It was near midnight when Colonel Gifford came in from the
palace, looking tired and depressed. He flung himself into the
chair by Seton. His manner was so marked, that Seton presently
roused himself from his own thoughts and began to wonder whether
the Colonel also had his anxieties, and if so, whether he might
venture to question or sympathise. He tried the ice cautiously
first.</p>
<p>"A touch of sun, Colonel? You don't look as chirpy as usual
to-night. Or was the dinner dull?"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;all as usual. I'm quite fit, thank you. But&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But what? Anything I can do?"</p>
<p>"I wonder!" said Gifford, and was silent.</p>
<p>His sensible, resolute face looked dark and overcast, and Seton
studied it curiously for a moment. He liked the Colonel&mdash;an honest,
straightforward fellow. You knew where you were with him, not like
these Levantine mongrels! No secrets, no mysteries here, all clear
as daylight.</p>
<p>After a while Gifford broke silence, but with an odd
preliminary. He hitched his chair nearer to Seton's and spoke in
French. To say the latter was astonished is to put it mildly,
especially as the Colonel's French was not such as it is a delight
either to speak or to hear, though laboriously correct. Each
sentence involved thought and trouble, and a little suspense to the
listener.</p>
<p>"Two things have happened to-night which have rather startled
me. Can I speak to you in confidence? I have a reason for wishing
to."</p>
<p>"Certainly. Absolute. I give you my word." "I was inclined to
speak before, but I did not know you well enough. Even now, I
hardly know. You are real English, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Certainly." Seton was lost in amazement.</p>
<p>"Well, I'll risk it, and the more so as I like you, if you'll
pardon my saying so. But I'm going to surprise you. There is
trouble brewing, I could swear&mdash;apart from the general tangle of
Indian affairs as they are now. And, like charity, it seems to be
beginning at home&mdash;here in Mianpur."</p>
<p>"Trouble? Disaffection?"</p>
<p>"Hard to say. Beyond me at present, but perplexing. Mahmud Mirza
has always been most loyal, and though there has lately been some
bad trouble from agitation in his outlying dominions, he has always
done his best to suppress it. The home authorities feel they can
count upon Mianpur, and he has told me he is consulted on almost
every important step that is taken out here. One felt one could
talk without reservation before him, and so forth. Of course we
have a Commissioner here (what the natives call the Kumpsioner
Sahib), and he knows all that goes on&mdash;Sir Edward Fairfax. He had a
bad accident in the jungle a year ago and went back to England to
recover, and a deputy, known as 'the Dipty Sahib' by the people, is
doing his work. To tell the truth, the Dipty Sahib, Kincaid, is a
fool, and the worst sort&mdash;a conceited one. No doubt they thought
Mianpur such a safe place that any one could do the routine. I
thought so too. Now I am not sure."</p>
<p>"Why?" Seton was profoundly interested.</p>
<p>"First, I don't like that Revel. Where has he come from? Why has
he such influence with Mahmud Mirza? I've never seen a European or
a semi-European (which ever he is) living at the palace before or
received by the Begam. If you knew the way things are done here,
you would appreciate that point."</p>
<p>Seton was tense with listening now. Revel! The cloud loomed
nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>"And Revel is intimate with Inayet Khan, Mahmud Mirza's distant
cousin. And Inayet Khan I would trust as far as I could throw him,
and no farther."</p>
<p>The French was involved here, but still intelligible. The
Colonel helped it out with an English word now and then, comic
enough if either of the men had been in the mood for comedy.</p>
<p>"Inayet Khan has been in Russia lately, the second or third trip
within eighteen months. The reasons given are excellent, if they
are the true ones. But, you may say, this is all suspicion, no
more. Well, to-night I was waiting for Mahmud Mirza and I overheard
two men talking. They did not see me&mdash;I was in one of the bay
windows, overlooking the lake&mdash;and they spoke, of course, in their
own tongue. To summarise: Mahmud Mirza has more or less lost his
heart to the portrait of the Russian beauty who is supposed to lead
Orsinoff by the nose, and Inayet Khan's last errand was to make
overtures. Now, that woman..."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!" cried Seton.</p>
<p>He had the sense of being on the verge of some vast and awful
discovery, something that would fuse all the mysteries and present
them as a connected whole. He could scarcely endure the Colonel's
painstaking French.</p>
<p>"Go on, for God's sake!" he cried.</p>
<p>"That woman is a danger to the world. She has urged Orsinoff on
to all the cruelties and madnesses he has perpetrated, and now&mdash;if
she should come here..."</p>
<p>"But they say Orsinoff is madly in love with her. Do you suppose
Mahmud Mirza could get her? And if so&mdash;he has a wife already."</p>
<p>"<i>Cela n'emp&eacute;che!</i>" the Colonel quoted with grim humour;
"and one more or less scarcely counts. The point in harem life
is&mdash;which has the influence? That, and that only. And as to
Orsinoff's life&mdash;do you think that is worth an hour's purchase if
this woman wants to get rid of him? They say Barikoff is her
creature, and he has been wanting to step into the other man's
shoes for the last two years."</p>
<p>"I see&mdash;I see."</p>
<p>"I heard more&mdash;but this part I am not sure of. The two men spoke
of a paper which predicts that this woman should return from a
previous incarnation and bring ruin to Europe, and Empire to India
and the Orient. Of course, this seems nonsense to you, but re
member, reincarnation is the commonplace of India. If that woman
has been able to get that story believed here, there is
<i>nothing</i> she may not do, and we are in for big trouble."</p>
<p>"Of what sort?" the other man asked, his thoughts racing. A
paper&mdash;Revel&mdash;the lost document! He could scarcely concentrate
enough to ask the question.</p>
<p>"A general rising. The 1857 Mutiny will be a fool to it,
especially if Russia is in the game also. It may mean the end of
everything out here. However&mdash;the second thing is that, as I came
away, I swear I saw old Gobind Srinavastri in the library in talk
with the Prime Minister."</p>
<p>"But that must be impossible! You said your self..."</p>
<p>"I know I did, but I saw it. Now, if that be so, it means that
the most bigoted, fanatical, wealthiest Hindu is in touch with the
Mohammedan party, and in secret. I don't think I need explain what
that means, and especially in the present temper of the people.
Now, the question is&mdash;what am I to do, how am I to know? I would
give all I'm worth for some one who could tell me what the women in
the palace are thinking&mdash;the Begam and Mahmud Mirza's young wife.
It might save the Empire! As I said before, Kincaid, the 'Dipty
Sahib,' is a fool. He will start the birds too soon. Oh, for real
knowledge!"</p>
<p>"Keep it to ourselves and watch," suggested Seton. "And look
here, Colonel; I know something of that paper you speak of. If you
can in any way enable me to lay hands on it, we may know a great
deal more than we know now."</p>
<p>In the talk that followed the two men grew to know and
understand each other well, and the uncertainties cleared up into a
determination to watch in silence for a time and compare notes. The
chief question in Seton's mind was whether it would be well to
induce the Grants to leave Mianpur, in case there were any
possibility of a rising, and on this he consulted the Colonel. He
advised against it for the present.</p>
<p>"Do nothing, say nothing, yet. I cannot and will not believe
that Mahmud Mirza would do anything against his salt in a case of
that kind, and remember the Begam knows and likes the ladies. I
think they are probably safer here than they would be in any part
of India near about, and we are here to protect them. But keep them
away from Revel. I distrust that gentleman entirely. If only we
could know what is going on in the palace!"</p>
<p>"Would you stay on here indefinitely then?"</p>
<p>"For the present, yes. If things are coming to a head, there may
be deadly danger in the thousands of miles between us and Bombay.
Besides, if there is anything in all this, the authorities may find
a man on the spot useful."</p>
<p>So they parted for the night, little guessing how soon the
avalanche would be upon them.</p>
<p>It was perhaps a result of Seton's disturbed state of mind, that
he went off next morning to see Venetia. The excuse was that he
must tell her of his meeting with Revel, the truth being that he
was desperately in need of the peace and sunshine her presence
always mysteriously brought with it. Her voice, her smile, seemed
to lay all the ghosts, to call the flowers into bloom, the birds
into song, and make the world wholesome and simple once more.</p>
<p>Sara had gone out for a stroll, and Venetia was sitting in the
verandah, already at work, with the photograph of Natalia before
her. She laid her brushes down as Seton came up and looked up in
his face, her eyes brimming with light and pleasure.</p>
<p>"Well? I have been longing to hear. What happened? Is it the
same inscription?"</p>
<p>"Yes. You were perfectly right. But there was nothing more. It's
a mystery. Don't talk of it. This is the first time I've found you
alone for ages, and I won't waste a minute. Talk to me&mdash;let me look
at you."</p>
<p>His tone said much more than his words. He put his hand out
beseechingly, moved beyond himself suddenly and irresistibly. With
the same impulse she laid hers in it, and so they sat for a moment,
rapt in the new wonder of love and beyond all need of speech. The
distance, the little shadows, had all melted like clouds in a deep
blue zenith, and they sat in a golden sunshine of perfect peace and
comprehension. Better things might come, but nothing again could be
like that first rapture.</p>
<p>"You love me!" he said at last, not questioning but asserting,
in a kind of wonder of quietude, and without any word she smiled,
as he put his arms about her and drew her to his breast. Love is a
stormy dawn for many hearts, blood-tinctured with passion and
unrest, brother to pain. For these two it was a divine and perfect
tranquillity, like the calm rising of a windless tide from the
heart of the boundless ocean of being. She lay against his shoulder
with closed eyes, lost in an inward dream of bliss, looking neither
backward nor forward, utterly content. So love is justified by
love.</p>
<p>But with him it could not last. Even in that perfect moment he
remembered. In the background were the dark presence of Revel, the
mystery of the theft of the document from the Museum in Cairo&mdash;a
matter in which he began to guess explanations&mdash;and its possible
terrible connection with events in India. Not even love itself
could for long shut out the phantoms which waited, pale and
menacing, at the gate.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p>The minutes drifted by. It seemed a long time since they had
spoken, but at last they touched the lower level of words again in
the sweet give and take of lovers, retracing together all the steps
of knowledge and under standing that had brought them to the
exquisite revelation.</p>
<p>"I know now that I meant it even when we talked at Abuksa," she
said at last.</p>
<p>"It was to be from the beginning," he answered, touching with
wondering fingers the beautiful hair that lay against his shoulder.
"But, why, why, Venetia, do you care for such an ordinary sort of
fellow as I am? I simply don't grasp it!"</p>
<p>"The 'celebrated explorer'!" she said, smiling up at him under
her long lashes.</p>
<p>"The celebrated idiot!" he retorted. "What have I done but
burrow? Any rabbit can do that. Here's the prophecy lost on which
the whole interest turned, and the queen a heap of dust,
and..."</p>
<p>"But she seems to have been reincarnated!"</p>
<p>She pointed, laughing, to the photograph. It sobered Seton
instantly. He tightened his grasp about the slender body and spoke
gravely. It pressed on him that he must prepare their minds for the
possibility of a retreat from Mianpur. They should take no risk he
could avoid for them.</p>
<p>"Venetia, now you are all mine, my wife to be, I want to talk to
you seriously, and with the certainty that what I say won't even
reach Sara unless I agree. I know I can trust you, darling."</p>
<p>"Utterly," she replied, and there was that in Venetia which made
her word equal to another woman's asseverations.</p>
<p>"It has to do with the lost document&mdash;and more."</p>
<p>As briefly as possible, he repeated what Colonel Gifford had
told him of Revel's influence with Mahmud Mirza. With his fears of
a general rising he would not trouble her. He spoke of the matter
merely as a thing to be watched, lest it should one day shape
itself into a danger. He felt her little grasp tighten on his hand
as he talked.</p>
<p>"It is your first confidence to your wife," she said; "and she
won't fail you. I quite understand. You want the document. You
distrust Mr. Revel. I distrust him myself; there is something
inhuman under all his beauty and courtesy, something that says
'Beware,' every time I talk to him&mdash;long ago I told you that. Now,
what can I do to help? Remember, we are intimate in the
palace."</p>
<p>Till that moment it had never occurred to Seton as possible that
she should help in any way. He wanted to secure her against any
friendliness with Revel which could possibly reveal the precautions
he and Colonel Gifford might take, and, above all, he yearned for
her sympathy and confidence. But help? No, he had not considered
that. It flashed on him, however, now in remembering Gifford's
words, that a woman of her calm intelligence and unusual position
with the Begam might be much more than a looker-on. A man could do
nothing in that vast intricacy. A quick intuition might make
priceless observations, not only for him but for the whole British
power in India. He looked her straight in the face, conscious that
he had a comrade as well as a sweetheart, and ready to speak fully
now.</p>
<p>"You would like to help me, darling? Then I believe you
could."</p>
<p>She rippled into delight at once, eager and attentive. "Tell me
exactly," she said, and settled herself to listen.</p>
<p>He spoke now as frankly as Colonel Gifford had done to him. He
told her of the fear of a general rising and a combination of the
Mohammedan and Hindu interests, reserving, of course, the points
that Gifford had given him in confidence and mentioning neither the
"Dipty Sahib" nor Srinavastri. Indeed, it was also better in every
way that they should have her unbiased observations. He asked her
earnestly whether she thought it better she and Sara should retreat
to Bombay instantly, while the way was still open, since Gifford
believed the blow might fall at any moment.</p>
<p>"I, of course, shall stay here with Gifford in Mianpur, for the
Government must have people it can depend upon, and with all my
heart I should rejoice to know you were safe at Bombay," he said,
looking at her wistfully. Her answering smile was full of gaiety
and courage.</p>
<p>"What! Go and leave you here, if there were danger? You don't
think me such a miserable craven as that? No. Tell me what you
think I can do, and then I'll tell you my own ideas."</p>
<p>It came to this. To visit the Begam as usual and learn, if
possible, whether anything was known of the prophecy, for Seton
believed that prediction might throw light on any plans made in
Mianpur. Still more would it be necessary to learn whether anything
further was known of Natalia and any negotiations between her and
Mahmud Mirza. The Begam was an unguarded talker. Her volubility
might drop invaluable hints as to Revel's influence with her son,
the chain of intrigue with Russia, and so on.</p>
<p>"I could do that," Venetia said slowly. "She thinks of me as a
child. And I see from what you say that there is danger to the
whole British rule out here. You may trust me, Miles. I will be
wise. I know her well. I can do it better than Sara&mdash;she is so
outspoken, and believes every one to be honest as she is. I won't'
say one word to her. But when the danger comes near, don't be
afraid to tell me. The Begam would protect us, and I have no fear.
In the Mutiny year Mahmud Mirza's grandfather sheltered many
English refugees here, and it is their pride."</p>
<p>Her quiet good sense and courage steadied him enormously. If he
had needed anything to make him realise the value of the treasure
he had gained, it was this. She would not fail nor falter, nor be a
dead-weight on her husband, whatever troubles life might bring
them, but always a bright light ahead, a shining strength in grief
and joy, a crown of courage and pride to the man she loved.</p>
<p>"You see," she went on earnestly, "this is work that only a
woman can do. A man hasn't even a look in, in the intrigues of
these palaces, and don't you think I must be thankful and proud
that my knowledge of India may be useful now? And this too&mdash;I have
liked Mahmud Mirza and the Begam ever since I can remember, and
have really an affection for poor little Gulbadan. I shall simply
rejoice if I can prove they are innocent of any plotting at all.
Personally, I am sure they are. I would not undertake this, even
for you, if I thought it would injure my friends. It will all blow
over."</p>
<p>Seton shook his head. Where Revel had influence, trouble would
follow inevitably. He told her so.</p>
<p>Later, Sara came in, and all the story must be told again to
her, and the happiness redoubled in her delight.</p>
<p>"You know, I just saw from the first what was coming, and if I
hadn't approved&mdash;well, you would never have seen us again!" she
said. "Venetia is all I have, and her safety is more to me than my
own. She will be safe with you, I know."</p>
<p>Those words of perfect confidence were ringing in Seton's ears
as he went away. Safe? But was he putting his own treasure and
Sara's on a service of danger? Had the country the right to demand
such a sacrifice as that? A man's life&mdash;a million men's lives, yes!
But a woman's? He trembled as he thought of all it might mean. He
walked through the gardens unconscious of their beauty and of the
glorious sunshine of the Indian winter, resolving, hesitating,
trembling&mdash;a horrid moment of uncertainty, and even as he neared
the town gateway, he saw Gifford coming towards him and determined
to consult him. He was really faint with the inward struggle by
this time, and Gifford saw at once that something was amiss.</p>
<p>"Sit down here," he said, leading to a seat by the fountain.
"What's wrong? Bad news?"</p>
<p>"No, but I want your advice about as badly as a man could want
it. In the strictest confidence."</p>
<p>He told the Colonel the events of the morning and besought his
counsel as to whether the ladies should be sent at once to Bombay,
and whether, if they stayed, Venetia's help should be accepted.</p>
<p>"We are just engaged," he added, "and I know you'll understand
how I feel about it all."</p>
<p>For all answer the Colonel drew a letter from his pocket and
laid it in Seton's hand. It was very brief, and he read it with the
utmost astonishment, for it seemed to have no reference to anything
he had said.</p>
<p>"DEAR COLONEL,"&mdash;it began&mdash;"the young man you kindly recommended
for the position of secretary to Mr. Dalrymple writes to say he is
unable to take it on account of serious illness. It is a great
disappointment, especially as time presses and Mr. D. leaves India
shortly. If you think of any one else, please write at once. It is
urgent.<br>
<br>
"In haste, Very truly yours,<br>
<br>
"H. D. WISE."</p>
<p>"But this..."</p>
<p>"I see I must take you into my full confidence now. The time has
come, and that being so, I am thankful I have a man to depend upon.
I am here on secret service. That note is from a man&mdash;a link in the
chain&mdash;at Fyzapur. It is the agreed signal that they are on the eve
of a dangerous rising there. Now, that answers one part of your
question. You will see for yourself that if the Fyzapur district is
up, the women cannot travel to Bombay. I fully agree with Miss
Venetia Grant. I think whatever Mahmud Mirza may do, that English
women, and especially Lord Cheriton's nieces, are safe with him.
The Begam also. The last sentence in that note: 'If you can think
of any one else,' etc., means, 'Send us all intelligence possible.
Great events at hand.' I leave you to say whether Miss Grant may
not be able to do the Government priceless service. As to
danger&mdash;Let her write nothing, speak no word of importance, to any
one but you (your engagement will cover that), and I see no danger.
Mohammedans are disposed to take women as pretty, chattering dolls.
Let that be her r&ocirc;le."</p>
<p>They talked for an hour of what the secret service meant and how
far it threw its tentacles; and the more he heard, the more Seton
admired its choice of the Colonel. The easy transparence and good
nature of his manner, his perfect knowledge of things Indian and
command of at least three languages of the Peninsula, armed him at
every point, and none the less because the native world at large
gave him credit for speaking Hindustani only, and was, therefore,
likely to be careless before him in other languages.</p>
<p>"But I, of course, could have done nothing with the women," he
ended, "and very much more important gratitude than mine will be
due to Miss Venetia Grant for even her intention. It is an
invaluable public service. One word before we part: if Mahmud Mirza
should press you to take up your quarters at the guest house,
refuse. Say it is not etiquette in view of your engagement. That
always appeals to the Oriental. You and I must be together, but not
too much. Only at the dak-bungalow or the palace."</p>
<p>So they parted, and Seton, relieved in mind by the sense of a
strong presence, but strung to a tense watchfulness, went on his
way to the House of Knowledge. As a traveller in the desert for
water, he craved for the peace of the little courtyard. A man hid
with the Divine and looking down from starlit spaces of quiet.</p>
<p>In a few moments more the old man was looking at him through the
dim, unearthly sweetness left from his communion with the Unseen.
He beckoned, but did not speak for a moment. At last:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You have come from a great bliss to a greater. Speak as freely
to me as you will."</p>
<p>In words as brief, Seton told him of Venetia. From the meeting
reticences of the Oriental and the English man, she had never been
mentioned between them, though there had been a certainty in his
mind that the old man comprehended and sympathised.</p>
<p>"It is well," he said slowly, "and better than well. Marriage is
the gate of manhood, and fatherhood the gate of understanding. And
you have chosen as a man should choose&mdash;" (he quoted from the
ancient Sanskrit injunction) "'A wife beautiful, well born, chaste
in mind and body, of courage and piety.' But even this, my son,
will not hold you for ever, nor can it hold her. The freed soul
asks more, and she leads you on the way. This love is a part of the
journey, it is not the goal. Be glad that for a time you may walk
together, but look steadfastly to the heights where there awaits
you a union beyond all that can now be comprehended."</p>
<p>He ceased, and Seton stood silent, absorbed in listening.
Presently he resumed:&mdash;</p>
<p>"But what I would say is this: great sorrows, great troubles are
at hand. Much I must not utter, some I may. Hear, therefore, with
attention, for I will instruct you. You shall not be deserted. It
is truth that no man, no creature in the universe is ever deserted,
and sure help pursues him if he will but stretch his hand to hold
it. But there is more for you than this, since you have reached the
point where it becomes possible. In your sorest strait you shall
sensibly know you are remembered, and succour shall come to you. I
cannot now tell you how. It is not yet revealed to me, but this
gift is given. Believe it."</p>
<p>To believe it was not difficult in the light of those eyes.
Seton ventured one question.</p>
<p>"Is it lawful that I should hear whence the danger comes?"</p>
<p>"From a woman and a man burdened with the karma of an evil past.
A woman and a man most pitiable."</p>
<p>"And with what weapons shall I meet it?"</p>
<p>"My son, is that question needed? What weapons are there but
courage and truth, and loyalty to the enemy as to the friend? This
is an old wisdom, but ever new."</p>
<p>"May I be strengthened!" Seton said slowly, and his tone was as
much promise as aspiration.</p>
<p>"That wish is fulfillment," was the answer.</p>
<p>They sat together in a silence all words, and presently Seton
rose and went quietly away.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p>It was with a trembling heart that Venetia, utterly unused to
secrecy of any kind, praiseworthy or other wise, walked into the
Begam's reception room beside the unsuspecting Sara a day later,
and it was almost a relief to find that the Begam was not present
and that only Gulbadan Begam was to entertain them. Laili brought a
message with profound salaams, to the effect that the Begam had
eaten too freely of a dish of pilau with pistachio nuts the night
before, and that if the elder Miss Sahib would visit her in her
bed-chamber and advise some noble medicine that would remove the
weight (comparable only to that of mountains) which lay upon her
chest, her heart would be dilated and her eyes enlightened;
Gulbadan Begam would meanwhile solace the younger Miss Sahib with
sweetmeats and a hearing of the new instrument which shouted like a
man or a woman through a silver trumpet according to the desire of
the hearers.</p>
<p>Sara immediately followed the messenger, well used to the
Begam's touching faith in "European medicines" and her own
knowledge of their use, and the two girls were left together with
only Gulbadan's devoted foster mother in attendance.</p>
<p>The young Begam looked the part of the Fair Persian to
perfection that day in her trousers of dark green and gold and coat
of mulberry silk embroidered with golden flowers. She wore about
her neck the magnificent pea cock in gold and jewels, with
outspread tail, which Venetia knew as a famous jewel of the house,
and in this splendid setting, though she glowed darkly beautiful
like a velvet damask rose hiding in leaves of shadowy green, her
eyes were heavy and languid, her mouth sullen. She pointed silently
to the glass arm-chair, but Venetia sat down beside her on a
cushion of the divan and asked whether her head ached, that being a
frequent result of the sickly sweet stuff eaten all day in the
zenana.</p>
<p>"It is my heart that aches," was all the reply vouchsafed, and
Gulbadan drew her hand away from any possible contact.</p>
<p>Humouring her like a child, old Zaynab, her foster mother, set
the gramophone going, and very strange it was, in those rooms
sacred to women, to hear a raucous man's voice shouting: "My
Pickaninny Love." It did not shout for long. In a sudden fury,
Gulbadan sprang at the braying trumpet and flung the whole thing to
the ground. Silence.</p>
<p>"It is broken, the devil's voice! I am glad&mdash;I am glad!" she
cried, stamping and glaring at Zaynab.</p>
<p>"So am I," said Venetia calmly.</p>
<p>Her serenity fell like cold water on Gulbadan's rage. She pulled
off her long gloves and took off her hat, the girl staring at her
half in envy, half in a kind of fascination. She could never
understand the foreign women&mdash;they were strong with strength of
which she knew nothing, their sorrows and joys incomprehensible.
Venetia saw clearly that the poor child was suffering either in
mind or body, and she took the frail brown hand and pressed it with
affection. Instantly Gulbadan flung herself on her knees at
Venetia's feet, and burying her face in her lap, sobbed wildly,
great rending sobs which seemed to tear their way out of her
slender body, bruising and torturing it as they came. Venetia
looked in alarm over her head at Zaynab, who shook hers sadly.</p>
<p>"It is not naughtiness, Miss Sahib. My child is gentle as the
blessed Lady Fatmeh. But it is the lot of women to suffer, and she
suffers."</p>
<p>Venetia laid her hand tenderly on the lovely dark head, and the
quiet touch seemed to soothe the girl. The sobs grew quieter and
ceased presently with a convulsive trembling that ran through her
whole frame.</p>
<p>"Forgive me, Miss Sahib," she said brokenly. "I suffer. Oh, that
I could die and be at rest? But how should you understand, who love
no man? Wise indeed are you to keep your heart locked and sealed,
for if it passes from one's own bosom..." She sobbed again, then
raised her heavy dark eyes, brimming with tears. "You have seen me
in my glory and happiness. Three years ago I was married, and the
paradise of Allah was not so glorious to me as this palace. And
now, what am I&mdash;a childless wife, a wife forgotten! Pity me, lady,
whose heart is cold and safe."</p>
<p>Naturally, Venetia had before this known that the root of
Gulbadan's tragedy would one day be her childless state. That is
the curse of women in India, and doubly so in a royal house. She
had had three years' grace as the only wife. Now...! It needed no
words to explain the miserable future of the woman who loves her
husband and sees her day done.</p>
<p>"You are so young! Indeed, indeed all will be well yet. Have
patience."</p>
<p>"Patience?" she laughed bitterly, then went on. "No, it is
finished for me. If you pity me, Miss Sahib&mdash;and I know your heart
is gentle&mdash;pray to your gods for me, that I may die and be
forgotten. In a few days comes the new wife, and then I shall see
his face no more. And once he loved me as the heart of his
heart!"</p>
<p>"See his face' no more? Do you mean he will divorce you because
you have no children?"</p>
<p>"He could do that, for our law allows it," said Gulbadan
sombrely, "but my people are great in the land. No, Miss Sahib. Our
law permits a man to have four wives. I shall be forgotten, that is
all. He loves me no more. The other women I could endure. But a
wife!"</p>
<p>She said it with such a fury of concentrated bitter ness that
Venetia stared at her in dismay. Here was a wound beyond all
healing, and no word occurred to her that did not seem insultingly
inadequate. Her own new gladness made her even more tender to the
hopeless girl at her feet. She put her arm round the slim shoulders
and was silent. Suddenly the torrent broke forth again.</p>
<p>"And if it had been a woman of my own people, perhaps I might
have borne it, for surely in her heart she would have known that
her day, too, might pass, as mine. But this is a woman of a race I
never saw, of a tongue I never heard, and their beauty lasts when
they are old women and ours is all withered and gone. It is
sorcery; it is the great Shaitan's work. I know it!"</p>
<p>"Who is she?" asked Venetia, so bewildered by the suddenness of
the whole thing that she had not time to consider. "Is she
English?"</p>
<p>"No, no, Miss Sahib. For your sake and your sister's I trust the
English. This is a woman from Russia. Her husband died a few weeks
ago and they kept it secret, and now, when she should be weeping
for him, she takes my lord from me. An accursed woman! You saw her
picture and did not know."</p>
<p>With a flash, knowledge and certainty shot through Venetia&mdash;a
horror also that the poor girl should run the risk of betraying her
husband's secrets. What dark and dreadful fate might not befall her
if that were guessed! She must stop her instantly, however valuable
the knowledge might be.</p>
<p>"Highness, you should not tell me this. I cannot listen," she
said earnestly. "If your husband had wished it known, he would have
spoken himself. Let us speak of it no more."</p>
<p>The girl rose instantly to her feet, and with a tragic look at
Venetia, as of one utterly forsaken, walked out of the room and she
did not see her again. Zaynab delayed.</p>
<p>"You are right, Miss Sahib, a thousand times right. It is great
danger that my bird should speak. A woman must take what Allah
sends her and endure, there is no other way. The Begam speaks out,
for she neither fears her son nor any other, but a mother may dare
what a wife may not. Shall I call Laili to ask her pleasure about
you?"</p>
<p>Laili brought word that the Begam would now see the Miss Sahib,
and Venetia was escorted with pomp to the state bedroom whither the
Begam had herself conveyed from a less ceremonious and more
comfortable resort when visitors were expected. The room was
panelled with looking-glass, and as the Begam sat up in bed, her
gray-black hair wildly dishevelled, a thousand stout, elderly
ladies sitting up among pillows in a brocaded garment highly
unsuited to repose, stared at her from every angle and repeated the
eccentricities of her toilette. They all salaamed to Venetia on her
entrance as grace fully as circumstances allowed, and one voice for
the thousand mouths poured forth greetings.</p>
<p>"Surely my heart is dilated already by the welcome company of my
friends," cried the Begam. "It is not for nothing that I held this
lovely one in my arms when she was but a month in the world. And
now I hear that she takes to herself a husband! Ah, it is time, my
heart's delight! Already should I have held children of yours in my
old arms. But it will come, it will come. And the fortunate
one&mdash;your lord&mdash;is he worthy of such a jewel? High born? A soldier?
With riches and beauty?"</p>
<p>Assurances were tendered that all was satisfactory, and most
cordially received.</p>
<p>"How should it be otherwise?" cried the old lady. "Your uncle,
who was indeed your father in spirit, was a great lord. May the
protection of Allah encircle his tomb! And now, beloved of my soul,
rejoice with me also. My son, the Sword of the Faith, chooses a
wife!"</p>
<p>She looked at them brightly, triumphantly, and both were, of
course, far too well skilled in Indian ways to make any
inconvenient comment. Sara, who knew and guessed nothing beneath
the surface, was as friendly and sympathetic as could be desired,
and Venetia did her best to follow suit.</p>
<p>"Doubtless a daughter of a great house, who will strengthen the
power of Mianpur, if that were possible." said Sara, after due
congratulation. "Is it permitted to ask the name of the favoured
lady?"</p>
<p>The Begam surveyed them with exultation.</p>
<p>"Her name, oh friends of my soul, is Shirin, which in your noble
language signifies Sweet, and she is distantly allied to me, being
of royal Persian blood. She travels even now through Afghanistan
and arrives next week, when the marriage will be celebrated. It is
as though I received a daughter to my old arms."</p>
<p>Her eye on them was keen as a parrot's. Sara met it with perfect
innocence, Venetia with what passed very well for it.</p>
<p>"And Gulbadan Begam?" she asked, gathering her courage.</p>
<p>"Thu!" cried the old lady, spitting on the ground with huge
scorn. "What is she? A useless, childless woman that never should
have entered the palace. Still, she knows her duty and is prepared
to meet Shirin like a sister. It is the will of Allah. He gives and
withholds sons at his pleasure."</p>
<p>She closed her eyes devoutly for a moment, then dived her hand
beneath the uncomfortable but gorgeous pillow of stiff gold
brocade.</p>
<p>"Here is the portrait of Shirin Begam. Scarce can my son eat or
sleep for looking on her beauty, which indeed resembles the
immortal houris of the paradise. What is your thought?"</p>
<p>"Beautiful indeed!" said Sara, regarding the small water-colour
picture with as much admiration as voice and gesture could express.
Friendship demanded no less, and indeed it represented a pretty,
almond-eyed girl of the languid Persian type, who could be
commended without untruth, no more.</p>
<p>"Two most beautiful ladies has your Highness shown us, this time
and the last," said Sara. "Varied are the gifts of heaven, in that
two should be so lovely and so unlike."</p>
<p>"The other is indeed beautiful, but of her we know nothing," the
Begam replied gravely. "This is our daughter, the pillar of our
house."</p>
<p>Venetia heard and was silent while the talk drifted away to the
old lady's ailments and the "draught of power" which Sara had
promised to send from her medicine chest. It was a simple
effervescing draught, but faith is might, and its fizzing was as
music in the ears of the Begam.</p>
<p>As they came away, Venetia looked about her for Gulbadan Begam
or Zaynab, but all was silent. Only Laili and the ordinary women in
attendance were on duty, and not a word did she breathe to Sara of
that strange interview.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p>When she laid it before Seton next day as they sat in the
gardens, it was very clear to them both that the news was
important, and that the Europeans in Mianpur were to know nothing
of the origin of Mahmud Mirza's new bride. In their deep pity for
the forsaken Gulbadan, it was resolved that, though Gifford must
know the facts, he need know nothing of the person who had revealed
them to Venetia. That secret, wrung out of agony, should remain a
secret so far as they were concerned. It was safe with her foster
mother, and might be entirely ignored.</p>
<p>"She shall tell me nothing more," said Venetia. "I mean to stop
her instantly, whatever we lose."</p>
<p>And Seton agreed. It had been settled between him and Colonel
Gifford that any talks they held should be in the gardens, and when
Venetia had gone he waited about for him to pass, getting out the
papers which were to be the pretext for the next discussion. He
came, quiet and cheerful as usual, but evidently with much to say,
and plunged into it straightway.</p>
<p>"Orsinoff was murdered a month ago and they've kept it dark. The
woman Natalia is supposed to have done it. I've just heard through
the Secret Service. Keep it dead dark."</p>
<p>"I will, indeed. Listen here!" said Seton, and told Venetia's
story.</p>
<p>Gifford's eyebrows drew together.</p>
<p>"Then she's coming. Look out for trouble. They're foisting this
woman on Mahmud Mirza&mdash;some plot of Revel's&mdash;for he loves his wife,
whatever the old lady may say. You see how it all fits in? The
Begam's ruse with the pictures was childish, for I can't see how
they hope to hide where she comes from for long. Probably she knew
too what I have just heard; that the rising in Fyzapur is begun. We
have arrested the man who is supposed to be the leader, but that's
no good now. Ah, if we could only lay our hand upon the man who is
the mainspring of it all&mdash;the man who is the bond between the
people in Europe and here!"</p>
<p>"Is it known who he is?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. A young man, a very wealthy one, believed in India
to have extraordinary occult powers. He was last seen in Cairo. His
name is Ibn ul Farid."</p>
<p>Seton recoiled as if he had been shot.</p>
<p>"But, good God, I know him! I've seen him. In Cairo."</p>
<p>Nothing could shake the Colonel's outward composure. It was too
long a habit, and any one might be studying their faces from behind
the trees. He never moved an eyelash.</p>
<p>"Be quiet, control yourself," he said, in his usual even voice.
"This is most important. Hold hard! Here comes one of Mahmud
Mirza's Jemadars."</p>
<p>The officer saluted as he passed, with the strictest punctilio,
and it served better than anything else to recall Seton to the
instant needs of the situation. His careless manner matched
Gifford's as he spoke again, swinging his walking-stick.</p>
<p>"I was a fool. I'll be careful in future. Yes, Revel made me
known to him in Cairo and he gave me a taste of his art."</p>
<p>"Go on. Miss nothing," Gifford threw in. "We can walk here
safely for about twenty minutes more and then I go to the palace.
There's a review in the grounds."</p>
<p>Without a minute's loss of time Seton detailed the scene in the
courtyard in Cairo, describing Ibn ul Farid's appearance, his
manner, his words&mdash;everything.</p>
<p>"Had he been mentioned before by Revel?</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"Tell me every word about that."</p>
<p>Seton began with the first meeting at Abuksa and the story of
the revelation that the prophecy was hidden in the throne. He went
on to his fainting fit at Shepheard's, and his extraordinary dream
of the Museum vaults. And when he had finished with the meeting at
the Carnatic (for he considered that necessity absolved him now
from his volunteered promise to Revel of silence on that head) and
Revel's assumption of Ibn ul Farid's name for the purpose of
meeting with Srinavastri, the chain he laid before Gifford was
complete as far as he could make it.</p>
<p>"You've forgotten nothing?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. What do you deduce?"</p>
<p>"Firstly, that the prophecy is the key of the situation so far
as you are concerned. It's evidently been of vital importance to
their plans, and therefore it's of the same importance to us to
collar it. You were hocused&mdash;or rather hypnotised&mdash;at Shepheard's.
Now, let's think that out. How did they do it? Had you any thing on
connected with the document in any way?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. By George, yes, though. That ring!" He held the ring
under Gifford's eyes. "But what's the connection?"</p>
<p>"Why, in the Orient far more than in the West, though it's known
there, too, an object connected with the subject is used for
suggestion. I've had to study these beliefs as part of my Secret
Service work. They come into a lot of things out here. One of these
fortune tellers will say: 'Give me a ring of the Missy Baba's,
anything she touch, and I seeing.' That first visit of Revel's to
Abuksa was made to find out if you had anything Ibn ul Farid could
use in that way. He found out you had. Then came the same at
Shepheard's. They used your mind and ring as a mirror, saw where
the document was hid, and one or both went off while you were
unconscious and secured it. You say you missed the ring when you
woke?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Revel gave it back to me."</p>
<p>"You see? Pretty clear, I think. I wonder if it's the right ring
or a fake? Let me look."</p>
<p>In deep anxiety, Seton pulled it off, and first Gifford, then
he, looked it over keenly. Impossible to be sure. That must be kept
for later investigation. Gifford went on:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The visions at the Cairo house were, of course, to get you
under the spell again and make you talk. They were searching and
tabulating your mind, I needn't tell you, of course, that once
done, hypnotism and suggestion open the way to further mastery by
the hypnotiser. You must be careful never to allow such a thing
again."</p>
<p>No need for warning there, Seton told him grimly. He had made
that resolve long ago.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;but it's very quickly done, you know. I've seen a man hold
up a glittering object and the other fellow go off as if he were
shot. Be on your guard."</p>
<p>They walked a minute in silence, the Gifford went on:</p>
<p>"From what you say, there seems a kind of mystery about Revel's
servant. I suppose Ibn ul Farid is not passing himself off in that
way?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. How should I? Heavens, what a fool I've been! You
make me feel like a child!"</p>
<p>"Very far from that," the Colonel said heartily. "You've given
me some of the mot useful information I ever had in my life. You've
brought me to close quarters with the elusive Ibn ul Farid and
connected him direct with Revel, and you've told me what may lead
to putting salt on his tail. It was a lucky day when I opened my
mind to you, Seton. Now we must get hold of the prophecy, as I said
before. I'd wager a hundred to one Revel has it in the palace, and
we shall never know why until we get it. Don't change a hair in
your manner to him. He's the nucleus to the plot, and some thing in
that document is being used in India. Mahmud Mirza is as loyal a
man as breathes, and if Ibn ul Farid were here, I should suspect
that this influence Revel has gained over him is based on some of
their occult tricks. I don't suspect Mahmud Mirza but I fear they
may use and then discard him&mdash;possibly murder him. I wish we could
net the prophecy!"</p>
<p>He strode away, whistling carelessly. It seemed to Seton that
everything that had happened was falling now into a harmony of
event and consequence. It would never have been in Revel's power to
deceive him any more. Henceforth it would be an equal encounter of
wits.</p>
<p>It may be said, however, that neither he nor Gifford knew all
the cards in Revel's hand.</p>
<p>Ten days later the city was <i>en f&ecirc;te</i> for Mahmud Mirza's
marriage. The bride had reached the palace in the night, escorted
by a guard of honour, and the bazaar was ringing with stories of
her beauty and grace, the Hindus as keen as the Mohammedans. Sara
and Venetia had a special invitation from the Begam that when the
marriage was over they might be presented to the bride, now
described as Shirin Begam, daughter of Sultan Husain Mirza. They
had already visited the palace to see the magnificent jewels
presented by the bride groom, which the old Begam showed off with
truly Oriental pride. All was excitement and pleasure, and there
was no jarring note to mar the triumph.</p>
<p>Beneath the surface, however, things were very different. News
came in to the Colonel of sporadic risings from various parts of
India; and of risings in Mongolia and Chinese Turkestan more
alarming still, if possible. It was undoubtedly the working of a
new and terrible fermentation in Asia, and who could predict the
underground ramifications? As a bonfire may blow its sparks abroad
and kindle new flames, so it seemed that the Fyzapur outbreak had
given the signal. There was nothing to alarm the most timid in the
Indian papers, nor yet in such English papers as reached them, but,
as Gifford explained, the Government were in absolute control
there, and not a word was published but under the censorship. In
reality, the women and children were all being got into safety so
far as possible, and troops were pouring in at Bombay and
Karachi.</p>
<p>"Should I warn Miss Grant?" Seton asked Gifford.</p>
<p>"What use? There is nothing to be done. The way out of Mianpur
is closed. Her anxieties will begin soon enough, and the less they
are believed to know, the safer they will be. You are asked to
Mahmud Mirza's wedding reception, I suppose!"</p>
<p>Not only Seton, but all the Mianpur world, including the "Dipty
Sahib," Kincaid, were at that gorgeous reception in the palace
gardens, where Mahmud Mirza received them standing in a shamiana
(tent) of the utmost splendour, surrounded by his staff, his breast
covered with orders, including the Indian Constellation. A very
kingly figure, though Gifford and Seton noticed that his eyes wire
haggardly brilliant and that he looked ill and weary. He accepted
their congratulations with perfect graciousness and, according to
Eastern etiquette, no allusion whatever was made to the bride; they
referred simply to a joyful event in his Highness' house hold.
Revel stood at Mahmud Mirza's shoulder, and the two Europeans
observed how often the latter glanced at him, as if at a prompter,
as the little talk went on.</p>
<p>Revel was cordiality itself. Sugary sweet champagne was served,
in which the guests drank their salaams to the bridegroom, and the
ceremony closed with the usual "God Save the King," rendered by the
palace band.</p>
<p>"I would give more than a little to see the bride and know what
underlies all this show," said the Colonel, as they came away
together. "Men, soldiers, are trick ling quietly away out of the
city and joining the enemy forces at Fyzapur. This state is so far
off the beaten track that they can hold it with comparatively few
men and send off the rest where they are more needed. I am not
afraid of the loyalty of the ruling princes. The fear is that men
like Revel, whom I believe to be agents of the Russians, may worm
in and get the reins. If so, the lives of such men as Mahmud Mirza
will be no safer than our own. There is an ominous stirring in the
bazaar. The next event will be an invitation to us all to put
ourselves under Mahmud Mirza's protection. I heard this morning
that the mails are no longer safe and only verbal messages will
reach me. Things are going badly for us at Fyzapur."</p>
<p>"Will any native be found loyal and brave enough to risk his
life as a messenger?"</p>
<p>"Thousands. They did it in the Mutiny; they will now. When you
were at Delhi, didn't you see the monument commemorating the
gallantry of those who fought and died there with us? There were
natives in the gallant little band that blew up the Kashmiri Gate.
I shall send and receive news regularly. When do your friends visit
the bride?"</p>
<p>"In four days. Is it safe?"</p>
<p>Seton's face was pale with anxiety. Those days and their
suspense were wearing enough, but every hour of them added to his
love and his trust in Venetia. He could not have imagined a more
courageous, sweeter nature than she showed in these straits. Never
a cloud on her brow, never a word of fear. It did not surprise him
later when Sara, who, of course, knew nothing of the hidden
terrors, said to him one day:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I always thought Venetia the dearest, happiest girl in the
world, but she seems happier and brighter than ever now. I can't
tell you, Miles, how grateful I am to you for that. You know what
I've always felt about her."</p>
<p>She saw him before she went to the palace to visit the bride.
Sara was putting the last touches to an imposing toilette, and the
lovers had a moment together.</p>
<p>"But, Miles, supposing she isn't the woman of the picture, what
shall you think then? And supposing she is, will it mean that the
troubles begin here at once? Will you come over to-morrow morning?
I don't like you to be walking about at night now the bazaar is so
much disturbed. Promise me not to."</p>
<p>"As far as I can, sweetheart; but I don't know what may be
necessary, and I am absolutely at Gifford's disposal. You mustn't
grudge me my share!"</p>
<p>"That's the only part I don't like," she sighed, and as Sara
came in the sigh vanished in a smile, and the closest watcher could
have seen no trouble in the summer blue of her eyes. He went away
marvelling at her, marvel ling even more at the strange fate which
had given the love of such a woman to him, unworthy.</p>
<p>The Begam received them with her usual blending of pomp and
somewhat down-at-heel comfort. It was never possible to forget she
was a great lady, but it was also impossible not to feel sometimes
that it was greatness tempered by such manners as made it extremely
human. Her coat of glorious gold kincob was, for instance, on this
bridal occasion, ruthlessly slashed with a pair of scissors up the
sides, on account of a sudden and poignant realisation that a
garment which had fitted her Highness' slenderness as a young
bride, had not increased with the years as she herself had done.
And, moreover, it could not be denied that the tight plum-coloured
satin trousers would have become the august lady better in the days
when her grace was so celebrated that all over India men spoke of
the "Pearl of Mianpur."</p>
<p>But Sara and Venetia were used to these contradictions&mdash;indeed,
the oddities of the Begam were among their earliest memories.</p>
<p>"<i>Subhan Allah</i> (praise be to Allah)! Oh, raisers of my
heart, we meet this day in joy!" she cried, motion ing them to the
glass arm-chairs. "May the blessing of the Prophet and the twelve
Imaums be upon it! Have I not pined for it, until my shadow was
attenuated and my countenance darkened? But now, Mashalla! I shall
nurse a grandson on my knees, and my friends rejoice in my
joy."</p>
<p>"The joy of a friend is better than our own joy," said Sara.
"And in token thereof have we not brought a mean offering, totally
unworthy of the bride of the son of our friend? May it be
accepted!"</p>
<p>"May your condescension increase!" cried the Begam, curious as a
child to see what the silk-wrapped box might contain. "Laili,
summon here my daughter the bride, and inform her that the two
pearls, the Angriz (English) ladies, peerless as the sun in beauty,
generous as our ancestor, Babar the Conqueror, are here with a
noble gift for her satisfaction. Haste, child, haste!"</p>
<p>Her look as Laili fled was peculiar&mdash;even Sara noticed it.
Venetia at once made up her mind as to the result of the mission,
and was therefore not in the least sur prised when Laili returned,
breathless and unsuccessful. She spoke rapidly with the Begam in
Persian, and the latter threw up her hands in a most expressive
gesture.</p>
<p>"Compassion of Allah, what a misfortune! Well is it said that
every light has its shadow. Here is my bride, and but this morning
did she say to me that her whole soul panted to behold my two moons
of delight and hear their mellifluous voices. And now has she been
eating too many julabis (a sweetmeat), and her head aches to
bursting, nor can she raise it. May your favour and forgiveness be
upon her!"</p>
<p>They both sympathised, Sara sincerely, for she knew the habits
of the Zenana too well to feel any surprise at the statement.</p>
<p>"Carry in this box to the women of Shirin Begam," ordered the
old lady. "But, oh, my doves, my little lambs, tell me what it
contains, and so shall my heart be at peace, for surely a closed
box is a mote in the eye of curiosity until the lid is raised."</p>
<p>She was gratified with a peep at the really beautiful smelling
bottle of gold, the stoppers set with pearls and coral, which Sara
had spared from her treasures, and amid her exclamations of delight
and wonder, Venetia cautiously intruded a question.</p>
<p>"The world has heard of the beauty of the Begam herself when she
was a bride. Is her new daughter as lovely?"</p>
<p>The delight of the old lady broke into a flood of reminiscence
and comparison. Her daughter-in-law was a peri, an houri, but she
herself had certainly had hair that touched the ground, whereas the
bride's did but reach her ankles.</p>
<p>"Still, her beauty is comparable only to the full moon, and the
sweetness of her voice to honey. She...But what is this,
Laili?"</p>
<p>For Laili, called by some mysterious signal to the door,
returned with a deep obeisance and a missive bound with silk, which
the Begam tore open and read at once. She flung it on the divan and
began to weep loudly and demonstratively.</p>
<p>"Ya Allah, who can say what a day shall bring forth? Surely He
raises and abases, and who shall question? Favoured of my soul,
these words are from my son, the Sword of the Faith. He says&mdash;'Say
to the ladies, the nieces of the great Commissioner Sahib whom we
loved, that there is danger. There is a rising among the low
persons of the bazaars, and it is necessary, until these are dealt
with, that the two ladies should abide under the protection of my
mother, the Shah Begam, and there shall they be entertained in
safety and magnificence, and when the danger is past they shall
depart in peace and gratitude. It is an order.'"</p>
<p>"Do you mean that we are not to leave here now?" asked Venetia,
her very lips blanching at the thought of this sudden separation
from Seton. Could any one have guessed, have suspected, that she
was watching, and was this the means taken to cut off information?
She stood up instantly. "Hazrat, we must go. It is impossible I
should stay here. You know that Seton Sahib and I are betrothed,
and if there is any danger I cannot be separated from him. He will
protect my sister and me. Sara, come! We must go at once."</p>
<p>Sara, utterly perplexed for the moment, looked from Venetia to
the Begam in consternation, and said nothing. The Begam wrung her
hands.</p>
<p>"Ya Allah, what are we to do with her? Verily, love is a fever
in the young, and even the aged are not exempt. Miss Sahib, lamb of
my heart, my son must be obeyed. The gates are closed and none may
leave or enter with out his seal. Would he say there was danger if
there was not? The <i>budmashes</i> (scoundrels) of the bazaar have
broken loose, and it can but be a day or more before they are
restrained, the owls, the cut-off ones, the cold of
countenance!"</p>
<p>"I will go to Seton Sahib!" Venetia repeated immovably.</p>
<p>"My own dear, have you considered?" Sara en treated in English.
"You know how kind and loyal these people have always been. If they
say it is unsafe, do you suppose Miles would wish you to run into
danger? Be patient."</p>
<p>"Sara, you don't understand. You don't know. I must go, I will.
You must stay here if you wish, but I shall go."</p>
<p>"Run, Laili, run, and have word sent to Mahmud Mirza that the
young Miss Sahib is run as mad as Mejnoon and declares she will not
stay in safety, no, not if they massacre her in the bazaar!
Represent to him that all her talk is of Seton Sahib and his
danger, and ask his commands."</p>
<p>She turned to Sara.</p>
<p>"Friend of my soul, vein of my heart, quiet your sister until
Mahmud Mirza shall have spoken. I will depart a moment and leave
you to reason with her. Oh, day of misfortune, how is our face
blackened that shone with delight! Extolled be the perfection of
Allah, in whom is no change! Attend me, Laili!"</p>
<p>She waddled off and the two were left together. Sara put her arm
about Venetia and tried to draw her to her, but she was cold and
unresponsive as marble, her thoughts fixed in sternest
concentration. It was not her own danger, nor even Sara's that
occupied her mind.</p>
<p>"Hush, Sara, don't talk for a minute. I want to think," she
said, and stared over her sister's shoulder at the window.</p>
<p>How&mdash;how could she get word to Seton? How would this affect his
plans and Gifford's? Her deadly fear was lest her dropping out
might affect the whole chain of communication. And yet&mdash;if that
could be held intact, there might be opportunities for knowledge in
the palace that she could never get elsewhere. How should she
know?</p>
<p>"Sara," she said, so suddenly that Sara started back, "I should
not mind staying here if you think it best&mdash;if I could know what
has happened to Miles. Do you suppose Mahmud Mirza would see us for
a moment? That would set my mind at rest."</p>
<p>"He might," Sara said doubtfully. "Of course, we have always
known him. Whom should we ask?"</p>
<p>Oddly enough, though Sara had invariably led hitherto, it was
Venetia who was taking command now. At the moment it seemed quite
natural; neither of them realised the change. She thought a moment,
then clapped her hands to call one of the zenana women. It was
Laili's younger sister, Aziza, who ran in. They knew her well.</p>
<p>"I desire that word be sent to his Highness Mahmud Mirza that
the nieces of his friend thank him for his hospitality, and desire
to speak with him, that they may ask a question."</p>
<p>Venetia spoke with a kind of stern gravity, her face so unlike a
girl's in its expression at the moment that Sara, who understood
nothing but what lay on the sur face, thought she had never seen
her so dignified and collected. Aziza, listening with the wondering
dark eyes of some little woodland creature, salaamed and ran off to
seek the Begam and lay this new and startling development before
her.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Gifford and Seton at the rest house, were considering
a message, written in faultless English and brought by a guard of
Mahmud Mirza's Sowars, gallant figures on their reined-up black
horses, the little pennons fluttering on their lances. It was from
the Diwan, the minister whom they had often seen in attendance, and
conveyed the intimation of danger and promise of safety in the
palace. The Miss Sahibs were already under the Begam Shah's
protection, and if any other European ladies were in the Mianpur
principality, they would be brought in. Kincaid Sahib had also been
notified, but had preferred to retire to Sellore, much against the
advice of the Mianpur court.</p>
<p>The two men spoke French in discussing it. "What is your
opinion? Are we most useful inside or outside?" Seton asked.</p>
<p>"Inside," the Colonel replied promptly. "All my information is
that there is no real danger yet in Mianpur. Revel is pulling the
strings and has frightened Mahmud Mirza about his responsibility
for European lives. He and the new wife are plotting for all they
are worth, and they want to make us prisoners in the palace so that
we shall not know what goes on. They will send us to the Summer
Palace on the lake, on pretence of greater safety. Easy to row
guard there, you know, and we shall not be able to see the Russian
lady. We are all as right as rain, unless Revel and the woman
bedevil Mahmud Mirza body and soul. But my diagnosis is that, as
they are out to make India a Russian community, Mahmud and the
other ruling princes will have as short a shrift as they can
devise, and then, of course, we are in the deuce of a tight
place."</p>
<p>"But," asked Seton, listening breathlessly, "can you carry on
there? Can you get information when you're interned in the middle
of the lake?"</p>
<p>Colonel Gifford smiled a little.</p>
<p>"I was prepared for this some time ago. Moreover, do you suppose
that if they lay a finger on Mahmud Mirza we shall not have
partisans all over Mianpur to avenge him? Even then I don't give up
hope altogether. India can never be Bolshevik. We shall have a
fearful catastrophe, no doubt, but the people will come to their
senses as a man does after a debauch on drugs. Revel and his allies
are drugging the country into madness now."</p>
<p>"Will it be possible for us to see the ladies?"</p>
<p>"I think so. That was allowed when Mahmud's predecessor
sheltered our folk before. Now, are you content? I must write."</p>
<p>Seton agreed, and the message was written and dispatched, half
the guard remaining, with two led horses, to conduct them to the
palace. They hurried through their packing and then rode off,
noticing as they went that, though the selling stalls were closed,
there was hardly any one about and not a sign of disturbance in the
city.</p>
<p>They were received in the great reception room by the Diwan, a
stout, elderly man with a stubbly black beard, who looked
thoroughly disturbed and uneasy. He salaamed profusely, and seemed
to hesitate in introducing the subject.</p>
<p>"I beg to represent," said Gifford, very erect and on strict
service, "that we have come to place ourselves under your master's
august protection, according to his counsel. It is now proper that
we should have the reasons for his proposal."</p>
<p>There was the note of authority veiled in the courtesy of the
little speech. The Diwan certainly could not be surprised by it,
but he hesitated painfully.</p>
<p>"On general lines, Colonel Sahib," he said at last, "it is known
to you that there is a deplorable tension in the public mind. His
Highness cannot guard you and the ladies as he wishes in the town,
and there fore..." (another marked hesitation) "he has had
preparations made in the Farhat Bakhsh (Giver of Joy) Palace for
your honourable reception, Huzoor."</p>
<p>"The Lake Palace? We thank his Highness. We understand the
ladies are with her Highness the Begam Shah now?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, Colonel Sahib, and they will also be provided
for."</p>
<p>Seton's heart lifted on hearing this. To be under the same roof
with Venetia, possibly to see her walking in the little lovely rose
garden, shaded with sweeping trees&mdash;he felt that all things were
endurable while that was possible, and he and the Colonel might
guard them.</p>
<p>"The ladies desired to see my master, for the information
startled them," the Diwan went on, "but he judged it would be more
agreeable if he communicated with them through the Sahibs."</p>
<p>"No doubt&mdash;no doubt," the Colonel agreed. "Then may we expect to
see his Highness now?"</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, he slept ill and is indisposed. I beg to
represent the pleasure is only postponed. If..."</p>
<p>An almost noiseless step interrupted him, and, starting
violently, the minister turned to meet Revel. Seton thought he had
never seen him look so handsome, so cool and unembarrassed.</p>
<p>"I have just heard what has happened," he said gravely. "If you
gentlemen are inconvenienced in any way by such a hurried move, all
I have is at your disposal. His Highness has commissioned me see
that everything is done for your comfort."</p>
<p>"Do I understand that you represent his Highness?" asked the
Colonel amiably.</p>
<p>"By no means. But he imagined that, being a European, I should
be more likely to understand your requirements. You have only to
name them, as far as possibilities go."</p>
<p>"We are very grateful. When do we embark for the Farhat
Bakhsh?"</p>
<p>"In half an hour, I believe. The ladies go in the same boat. You
will wish that?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. One other matter. Does his Highness ensure us free
communication by mail and otherwise with the outer world?"</p>
<p>"As far as his powers go. But you are aware that the Fyzapur
State is in a very disturbed condition, and on the southern border
Chilanbad is impassable with roving bands of dacoits. It is almost
impossible to get things through now. For the last two days he has
been trying and has failed."</p>
<p>"It is most unfortunate," the Colonel said, in a tone of
annoyance very natural in the circumstances, "for I wish to
communicate with my relatives and lawyer. But after all, if his
Highness is in the same predicament, we should not complain. Well,
Mr. Revel, we are ready when the boat is."</p>
<p>Revel went away, and they were left once more with the Diwan.
The little stout man walked up and down the room, evidently
perturbed beyond all bounds of Oriental etiquette. Gifford followed
him.</p>
<p>"Kwaja Hussein!" he said; "I have known you for many years and
have ever found in you the heart of honesty and the tongue of
truth. Has Revel Sahib authority here or has he not?"</p>
<p>"Do not ask me, Huzoor. It is not for the servant to speak when
the master is silent. But I fear for my master. Very greatly do I
fear."</p>
<p>He escaped without another word, and Gifford resumed his French,
as he strolled to the window with an air of ease that would have
deceived any listener.</p>
<p>"You see, Seton? Mischief's afoot. Remember, now, in case we are
separated (but we shall not be yet), that the prophecy is the
point, and all Miss Venetia can hear through the women is
invaluable. The view from this window is unrivalled, is it
not?"</p>
<p>Seton answered, little suspecting that through a grille
contrived in the ornament of the great door, watchers on the floor
above could observe every one in the reception room at their ease.
A pair of eyes, dark and beautiful, strained to see his every
movement and each detail of his face. A voice he had never heard
murmured, "Thou endest the night," while white fingers clasped over
a carbuncle ring he would have recognised very readily.</p>
<p>"Bored?" asked the Colonel, coming back to him. "Well, just a
bit!" he admitted. "Don't like the wait between the acts."</p>
<p>The Colonel chuckled under his moustache.</p>
<p>"You may come to be thankful for even that, Seton Sahib," he
said.</p>
<p>In half an hour's time there was spectacle enough to content the
greediest, for, as they walked down the courtyard which opened to
the lake, a very striking scene met their eyes. The sunset was
burning on the water in the splendour of gold and rose, and on its
fiery reaches a mile away lay the white marble palace, flushed like
an Alp with the sun's last kiss. It looked as unreal, as visionary,
as the palace of a dream. The Sleeping Beauty might have dreamed
beneath those exquisite cupolas, the Queen of Fairyland might have
embarked in the magnificent barge, curved and high and golden, with
fretted carving at bow and stern, its rowers glitter ing in gold
and crimson above their gilded oars and its canopy and curtains of
rose dragon brocade from China. But it was not the splendour that
struck Seton dumb. It was that he had seen it all before&mdash;in a
courtyard in Cairo.</p>
<p>Sara and Venetia, very quiet and controlled, were sitting hidden
under the canopy as the men stepped aboard. They said nothing, but
it was not difficult to understand the look of relief as they
appeared. Seton set the time at once by greeting them in French,
touching Venetia's hand furtively as he spoke. It was good to be
near her again.</p>
<p>"Are we prisoners or guests? I can't quite make out," said Sara.
"I interviewed the Begam before we started, but as she was
alternately weeping and devour ing Turkish Delight, I made very
little headway. Venetia was much more enterprising. She demanded to
see Mahmud Mirza, but was told he was ill."</p>
<p>"So were we," said Seton. "Isn't this the most unexpected turn
of fortune? Never mind&mdash;so long as we're together. Colonel Gifford
says there's nothing to fear."</p>
<p>Venetia looked into his eyes.</p>
<p>"I wasn't afraid in the ordinary way, Miles. I was only afraid
of not being able to see you."</p>
<p>He understood the double meaning of her words, and so did
Colonel Gifford. They knew they had a fearless ally in her.</p>
<p>It was a strange moment when they landed at the lovely marble
pier of the Farhat Bakhsh and crossed a lacework bridge to the rose
garden. Seen from there across the water, the palace of Mianpur
loomed dark and threatening, like a thundercloud overhanging the
town. The lights were being lighted, the large one on the western
tower among the first, known as the Moon of the Amir, and always
lit when Mahmud Mirza was in residence. They stood a moment or two
looking back and then turned to the palace, Venetia following with
Seton, to the Hathi Pol, the Elephant Gate, where several officers
of the Household waited to receive them. The women were led to the
zenana and given into the care of two of the Begam's ladies, the
men to their rooms, looking sheer over the water, the windows only
about twelve feet above it; having seen these, they were taken to
the Pleasure Hall, a beautiful little chamber of carved marble,
white, blue, and veined with gray, the effect being marvellously
delicate and refined.</p>
<p>"Here," said the Ressalder who escorted them, "the Madam Sahibs
will also sit when it pleases them. They have, indeed, a divan room
of their own, but it may be their pleasure to come hither."</p>
<p>Mahmud Mirza had certainly left them nothing to complain of in
their accommodation so far as lay in his power. The luxury was
endless, but, as the Colonel remarked, a little less marble and a
few more bathrooms would have been acceptable, a sentiment that
Sara and Venetia echoed on seeing their beautiful rooms. Yet this
was ungrateful, for in all the world could be found no more
exquisite bath than the one set apart for them of white marble sunk
to the floor level, the edge carved with great lotus flowers and
their leaves, so beautiful that the absence of hot water and the
fact that it must be emptied and filled by hand should count for
little to the aesthetic mind.</p>
<p>Their Indian experience and knowledge of the language served
them well, and Seton, as envious of the power as he was ready with
languages, spent every spare moment in learning Hindustani with the
Colonel's help. It gave an explanation, too, for endless
conferences over the outspread books.</p>
<p>Some quiet days followed&mdash;another wait between the acts, and it
was impossible to guess what was happening in the beautiful city
across the lake. It might have been another planet, for all they
knew&mdash;all, that is, except Gifford. It was on the sixth day, as
Seton and he had been smoking in the rose garden under the shade of
the pippala and neem trees with a book before each of them, that,
speaking in French, he said laconically:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What would you make of the message I have had this morning? Any
good at guessing riddles?" He paused a moment, then added: "This
did service once in Indian history, but my informants, of course,
have altered the numbers. 'A great pearl has been dissolved, two
gold mohurs have been lost, and of the silver and copper coins are
vanished ten.' Is that decipher able?"</p>
<p>"Not to me. I know a gold mohur means a coin."</p>
<p>"It means simply this: Mahmud Mirza has been murdered, with two
of his ministers and ten of the minor officials."</p>
<p>The Colonel was leaning on the marble balustrade, looking down
into the placid water that lapped against it. With a violent effort
Seton repressed a start of horror. He glanced furtively over his
shoulder. No one was in sight, but the rose bushes and hibiscus
might hide a listener. The beauty that veiled such happenings was
terrible in that moment, as he looked across the blue serenity to
the city of the tragedy and the sullen palace dominating it.</p>
<p>"Go on," he said in a stifled voice.</p>
<p>"Not much more to tell. I have been expecting this, as you know.
It means that Revel and the woman are in the saddle, and what their
next move will be, who can tell? I wish we knew who that woman is.
It might throw some light on her future doings. Does she belong, I
wonder, to one of the small states that has such wrongs to avenge
on the greater powers? Is she an Armenian, Czech, Russian, or
what?"</p>
<p>"If I told you what I think, you would say I was a raving
lunatic. You would never trust me with a secret again."</p>
<p>"My dear fellow, in the Secret Service what most men call
lunacies are the mainsprings of great events. I shall laugh at
nothing you say. It may be of vital consequence at this terrible
time. For I must tell you that the Nawab of Fyzapur has also been
murdered with his ministers, and two other ruling princes. You will
see that the Russians are breaking up all the loyalties which might
help the British Raj. This is steadily spreading throughout the
land. Now, light your cigar and chat as it were, but tell me."</p>
<p>Seton sat on top of the balustrade, his long legs swinging
carelessly as he talked. Any one looking at the little group of two
would have supposed they were loafing in the delicious laziness
that had given its name to the fairy palace and gardens. The sound
of the water was like a kiss against the marble, the faintest
breeze breathed in their faces, ineffably sweet with rose per fume,
as Seton's grim tale unfolded itself from point to point, and
Gifford listened, yawning now and then, and flinging rose petals
into the lake, but with the bright of his eye on the speaker.</p>
<p>"And this was the prophecy Alphonse had copied: 'The great white
people (of Atlantis) shall put on again the garment of flesh, and
their sinews shall be iron and their strength terrible. They shall
dwell in a cold land of the north and come out from it like
locusts, and run over the earth with wings and wheels, and the
nations shall tremble and abase themselves. And the sign shall be
that the dead queen Nefert, she whose body lies in the land of
Egypt, shall return from the Land of the Dead. She shall glory in
her beauty. She shall live and triumph.'"</p>
<p>"Interesting! Go on," said the Colonel, feeling for another
cigar.</p>
<p>"Then there were the hieroglyphics we found with the body.
Walworth read them for us: 'The Queen, Nefert. She went down to the
grave with scorn and loathing. With scorn and loathing shall she
return. Break not down the door. Cast not down the stone, lest she
arise and come, very terrible in hatred. In the same form shall she
come, and her sign is war and terror.' Then there was a curse on
those who broke the seal. And we broke it."</p>
<p>"Go on. Give me every point," said the quiet voice. "Light a
cigarette&mdash;let's look as casual as we can."</p>
<p>Seton gave every point, conscious all the time that it sounded
far more like a fairy tale than sober information for the Secret
Service. He ended almost despairingly,</p>
<p>"Do you think there's anything in reincarnation, Gifford? I
never gave it a thought until I came to India&mdash;but now..." He
paused, thinking of Jadrup Gosein, and added hastily, "In short,
I'm a convert. You won't agree with me, but there it is."</p>
<p>"'The geography of that country is written only by those who
have never visited it,'" Gifford quoted. "How can we know? But I'll
go as far as this&mdash;I have found it more than once a very sufficient
working hypothesis in India. Let us work on it now."</p>
<p>Seton looked at him gratefully.</p>
<p>"By George, you're a broad-minded fellow! One isn't afraid to
bring anything to your notice."</p>
<p>"I should be little fit for my job if you were. Tell me&mdash;do you
associate Revel with this woman's past?"</p>
<p>"Ah, we must wait for the lost prophecy to tell us that. I do
associate him with it of late, but I have no reason for it as yet.
But hush&mdash;here's Venetia. Must we tell her about Mahmud Mirza?"</p>
<p>"No, no. She'll know it soon enough. We want to keep their hope
and courage going."</p>
<p>She came, walking leisurely and daintily under her white
sun-umbrella lined with pink. It spread a lovely glow on her face,
and her eyes were blue and deep as the lake. A charming woman in
white, come out without a care on her mind, to enjoy the roses
exhaling their hearts in perfume in the sunshine, she added the
last touch of beauty and security.</p>
<p>"She has something to tell us. I know, because she looks so
happy," Seton said, with a lover's intuition, and the two men
turned to meet her, as care-free as she.</p>
<p>For a few minutes she spoke of the view of the city, the
flowers, anything. Then, quietly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The Begam is coming here to-day, and the women have a rumour
that Mahmud Mirza is ill. Doesn't it seem strange she should come
away when he is ill? I believe he is dead. Sara and I remember when
the other son, Ahmad Mirza, died, and it was hidden for a fort
night. There is something mysterious."</p>
<p>Seton looked at Gifford with a kind of triumph. His face said,
"Trust her altogether, she will not fail." Gifford responded at
once. He was too good a judge of human stuff to be mistaken either
in man or woman, given the opportunity of judging. With brevity and
simplicity he told her all he knew.</p>
<p>"You can't be too guarded, Miss Venetia. The Begam will not
know, but Mahmud Mirza is dead. For your life, watch any hints she
lets drop about Revel. That may be her salvation, as well as our
own. And, of all things, win Gulbadan Begam's confidence. Don't
scruple, for you will probably save her life if we are armed with
knowledge. At present I should say it is scarcely worth an hour's
purchase, with that devil in the palace. Gulbadan's jealousy will
have kept her alert."</p>
<p>"If it is dangerous for her to do this, even now I forbid it,"
Seton interposed. "Is it fair&mdash;is it fair, I ask you, now we have
come to this, to put a woman in the post of danger? I never guessed
it would be a service of blood and ruin like this when it began.
Venetia&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My dear fellow, when I said Gulbadan's life was not worth an
hour's purchase, I might have said the same of Miss Venetia's and
all our lives and of the British Raj in India. She is a brave
woman, and, being a woman, can do what we cannot. She is fighting
for her life and for us all. Let her judge."</p>
<p>"Miles agrees with you absolutely, Colonel Gifford, and so do
I," Venetia answered with her fearless smile. "I shall be thankful
for this chance of helping to the last day of my life, whether it
comes to-morrow or fifty years hence. And so will he. Now, walk
about with me a little, and then I will go in. Sara has a bad
headache."</p>
<p>They walked awhile, Seton marvelling at her as men marvel at the
woman they love&mdash;the inward harmony which had shaped lips and eyes
into finer, more sensitive lines than those of other women. He and
she had never spoken together of his meeting with Jadrup Gosein,
but now, before she went in, she turned to him suddenly.</p>
<p>"The less you said, the more I knew what you had felt about
Jadrup Gosein. How could one be afraid in the world he has opened
to one? The true world. You feel that?"</p>
<p>"I feel it entirely," Seton said gravely. "And I must tell you,
Venetia, what he said of the trouble that is before us now."</p>
<p>He repeated it.</p>
<p>"Have you tried yet?"</p>
<p>"No. I am waiting for a sharper pinch than this."</p>
<p>"If you were meant to have tried, you would have had the
signal," she said, gathering a rose and pressing it against her
lips. "There might be watchers."</p>
<p>"What signal? How?"</p>
<p>"It is different at times, but one always knows. Sometimes like
a drift of music&mdash;but not music that one hears. One feels it. Like
strange, beautiful vibrations. How can I put it into words?
Sometimes like a sudden silence where one can hear one's heart
beat. I always know."</p>
<p>"Does it come often?"</p>
<p>"Not very&mdash;but when it does, you will understand. It's quite
unlike anything else. I have had it once since all this began."</p>
<p>"And what was it? Can you tell me?"</p>
<p>"A vision of the end of it all. Quiet, under great trees, with
blue mountains seen through tracery of leaves, and&mdash;well, Victory.
Something well done and laid aside for ever. Not that anything
ends, but yet finished and good."</p>
<p>"It sounds like heaven. Where?"</p>
<p>"How can I tell? It Is heaven wherever one feels such things.
Heaven is within one, the rest matters nothing. Now I must go."</p>
<p>She went contented away, and Seton paced up and down, for the
moment contented also.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<p>In the afternoon they saw the state barges put off, and the
Begam came, attended by Laili and her favourite ladies. A few were
left at the palace to serve Shirin Begam, she told Venetia. Always
voluble, she was so hurried and flurried by the sudden removal,
that at first she was scarcely coherent, but after a while she
settled down in comfort and gossip and the most hospitable
satisfaction that Venetia and her sister were at the Farhat
Bakhsh.</p>
<p>"For indeed, lamb of my soul, the budmashes (scoundrels) of the
city are very insolent persons, and it is credibly told me that
they have plundered the guest house and murdered the keeper&mdash;may
Allah not have mercy on their graves and may the stoned devil
possess them! Therefore, it is understood by you that my son, the
Sword of the Faith, judged wisely in sheltering you and your sister
here. Great is his wisdom!"</p>
<p>"Great indeed!" Venetia repeated, sick at heart to see the poor
mother in ignorance of her loss and ruin. "May God be good to him
in all his comings and goings."</p>
<p>"It is certain that he will," the Begam said proudly, "for it is
noticeable that the worthy are under the Protection. But seat
yourself by me, my full moon, and tell me of your sister. A pain in
the temples, her head like a coal of fire? What words are these, my
child? Ya Allah, this must not be neglected! Run, Laili, fly for
the prescription that hakim (doctor) wise as Aflatoun (Plato), gave
me to drink when I ailed at Sikanderbagh. Lose not a moment in
foolish chatter, according to thy wont, oh, daughter of
Shaitan."</p>
<p>Laili, who little deserved this rebuke, darted off like a hare,
and in less than five minutes the precious paper was in the Begam's
hand.</p>
<p>"It will cure aught but the pangs of childbirth, or unrequited
love. Now hearken, oh, brightener of my countenance."</p>
<p>She read aloud with immense enjoyment:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful; and
blessings and peace be on our Lord the Prophet, and his family and
his companions one and all. But afterwards let him take bees' honey
and cinnamon and <i>chob-chini</i> (ginseng), of each half a part,
with gum mastic, which let him pound and mix with honey and form
boluses, each bolus the weight of a small nut, and of it let him
use every day a nut on the saliva (fasting). Verily, wonderful are
its effects. And let him abstain from flesh, fish, vegetables,
sweetmeats, flatulent foods, acids of all description, as well as
the greater ablution, and live in perfect quiet. So shall he be
cured, by the help of the One, the Healer, and the Peace."</p>
<p>She folded it and looked triumphantly at Venetia.</p>
<p>"Maryam Khanam, whose skill is known, shall compound the
boluses, and fear not but you see the face of the sister shining
with health the morn's morrow. Run, Laili, give this to Maryam
Khanam, and desire that she be speedy. And now, to talk, dil
khushar (heart's delight)."</p>
<p>Venetia had but to listen as it poured on, a torrent of the
little affairs of the zenana&mdash;and indeed her attention wandered,
until a name arrested it.</p>
<p>"And the wise exult not in the morning, but when the day is
done, and had I known what now I know, I had not given my chain of
opals to Shirin Begam."</p>
<p>"And why not, Highness?"</p>
<p>The old lady lowered her voice and glanced about her. For the
moment they were practically alone, for Laili was preparing her
pipe at the end of the hall and the newly arrived ladies were all
making arrangements for their own and their mistress' comfort.</p>
<p>"Lamb of my soul, the Frankish women are not as the women of
Hind. To them one may speak and it is as if a stone were dropped in
a well: it is no more heard. To you, then, I say thus&mdash;Natalia
Begam unveiled her face this day to a man, to Revel Sahib, for she
received him in the Garden Pavilion Hall and there spoke with him
with only one woman in attendance, Hamada Khanan (may her
countenance be cold before Allah!) and this lasted for half an hour
and Laili brought me word."</p>
<p>The eyes she fixed on Venetia were round with horror, and the
girl knew it must have been a terrible shock for the Begam.</p>
<p>"It is very strange, oh mother!" was all she dared to say.</p>
<p>"It is so strange that if my son hear it, he has the right to
pack her back to her own people&mdash;or worse," said the Begam
ominously.</p>
<p>"But surely, a lady of your Highness' own family would not act
so amiss?" Venetia ventured cautiously.</p>
<p>"Of my own family, girl? Thu!" cried the Begam, spitting in
disgust and totally forgetting her former assertion. "It is
foolishness to anoint a rat's head with oil of jasmine, and to
treat a Kafir (an infidel) as one of the princes is no less folly.
She is&mdash;"</p>
<p>But Laili approached with the pipe, and the Begam, receiving it,
made a gesture of understanding common to all countries. She
winked, unroyally but peremptorily. Laili withdrew to the
window.</p>
<p>With all the air of indifference she could muster,</p>
<p>Venetia attempted a step further. The name of Natalia had
sounded as the stroke of doom.</p>
<p>"Has your Highness known who this Revel Sahib is? Surely his
rank and worth must be high if Shirin Begam thus honours him? And
was he not as the right hand of the Amir Mahmud Mirza?"</p>
<p>Again the Begam lowered her voice.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>Mahi-alum</i> (moon of the world), surely it is known to
you that Revel Sahib is a mighty magician, comparable only to
Suliman the Wise. Great seeings has he shown my son of his wealth
and advancement even to heights I name not, and who can resist the
power of the <i>Djinns</i> (evil spirits)? Have not I myself seen
wonders at the hands of Revel Sahib&mdash;such things as caused my heart
to burn within me for pride? The future is as an open page before
him."</p>
<p>The fear and awe in her face were so great, the superstition of
the Oriental vibrant and conquering, that Venetia, to recall her to
herself, recited the great Moslem formula, "There is no power save
in God, the Supreme, the Compassionate," and it calmed the old
woman, who devoutly repeated it after her.</p>
<p>"True, oh young and wise, most true. Yet the heart of my son was
swayed like a creeper in the wind. Revel Sahib and this woman
Shirin&mdash;But what do I, a talkative old woman, wasting the time of
the consumer of hearts, that would be sitting by her sister or
talking with her lord to be? Go, my child, in the protection of
Allah, and may the bolus (taken on the saliva) bring health to the
sister who is even as your mother."</p>
<p>Venetia rose obedient at the signal of dismissal, and asked but
one question more.</p>
<p>"Gulbadan Begam, Hazrat? Is she also come?"</p>
<p>"She is come, but sits silent. I bethink me that I was hasty
with the child. This at least I know: <i>she</i> would be hewn in
pieces ere she would show her face to Revel Sahib, or any man. Talk
with her, dove of my soul, and bid her be comforted. Tell her a
man's heart may make a day's journey and yet return to his
home."</p>
<p>This was an unheard of concession from the Begam, who had never
owned herself mistaken within the memory of man or woman. It
touched Venetia inexpressibly, knowing that the royal heart she
spoke of had set out on a journey, longer than that to any woman's
heart, from which there is no return.</p>
<p>"Indeed, I will see her," she said warmly, "now&mdash;this minute&mdash;if
I may."</p>
<p>"Run, Laili, conduct the Miss Sahib to Gulbadan Begam."</p>
<p>And the old lady composed herself to her pipe.</p>
<p>Venetia could never forget the scene that followed. Laili
brought her through devious passages to a small room of purest
marble, white as the heart of a deep-sea shell, with a long window,
jealously latticed with marble trellises of sea-foam beauty,
looking toward the city and the palace over a mile and more of
water, with the evening rising like mist from its hushed surface.
Lights were lit in the palace. It glittered like a constellation,
and above it shone on the western tower the great light, Moon of
the Amir, which denoted the presence of Mahmud Mirza in his city.
Gulbadan Begam sat, darkly beautiful, on a pile of cushions, a dim
lamp burning at her elbow, her head pressed against the lattice,
her eyes steadfastly fixed on the far-away light that spoke of her
lord. She neither turned nor moved when Venetia entered, and Laili
made a frightened little salaam and vanished. No lady was in
attendance. The young Begam was absolutely alone.</p>
<p>There was silence for a minute, and then, gathering her failing
courage&mdash;for grief is more terrible than sovereignty&mdash;Venetia
advanced very softly and knelt on a cushion by the girl. And still
she neither spoke nor moved, and the minutes went by, each, as it
were, frozen in her attitude.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as they watched, the brilliant light, the Moon of the
Amir, was extinguished, and from the city came the sound of a great
multitude, mixed, as it were, with the wailing of women, and as
this happened, the young queen threw her head backward and covered
her face with her hands.</p>
<p>"My sister, my sister!" cried Venetia, all the founts of pity
broken up and pouring from her eyes.</p>
<p>It was some minutes before Gulbadan spoke, and then with a cruel
self-control more touching than any demonstration. She held
Venetia's hand in a tight, cold clasp all the while.</p>
<p>"My sister, strengthen me! Weaken me not with tears, for my task
is before me. What now you see, I knew yesterday, and have endured
alone, but for my foster mother, Zaynab&mdash;may Allah approve her, for
she is a good woman! And now, since it is not possible for me to
see Gifford Sahib and Seton Sahib, will my sister be my tongue and
my heart and bear my words to them?"</p>
<p>Her eyes were burning into Venetia's with a fearful earnestness,
her grip strengthened until it hurt. "What you tell me, I will
faithfully repeat."</p>
<p>"Then bend your ear while I whisper."</p>
<p>They sat cheek to cheek as the passionate whisper went on.</p>
<p>"This man, this woman, have murdered my lord. For this reason
she came. They are brother and sister, and of all things most evil;
and because the people about him were faithful and therefore Revel
Sahib could not slay him, he brought the woman, that my lord might
trust her and die. But this is not all; for my lord's heart was
mine, but Revel Sahib made him see this woman in waking dreams and
visions, until her beauty so possessed him that he could dream of
nothing else, waking or sleeping. And in these visions also he
showed him how he might be emperor of India and of the world, so
that he might be called Alumgir, World Conqueror, like his
forefather, Aurungzib. It is a great and fearful magic, Miss Sahib,
and he does it through the power of a certain ring, brimming with
red fire and full of enchantments, for when that ring is on the
hand of any man or woman, they must see as Revel Sahib wills. And
they are lying visions! Also he gave him such things as destroy the
soul, hashish, benj&mdash;horrible things that break a man into worse
than death."</p>
<p>She paused for a moment, shaking from head to foot as if her
slight frame could not sustain the weight of the passion that
poured through. Venetia, trembling also, clung to her. Presently
she went on.</p>
<p>"Thus, by these two, all power was taken from my lord, and the
Diwan saw it and could do nothing, for what are men to fight
against the evil spirits? And all my lord's soldiers were sent
forth to slay and murder in Fyzapur and throughout the provinces,
and there is a great fire kindled in India, and it is the work of
these two."</p>
<p>Again a tense silence, and over the water came the sound of the
multitude, like the cry of a wild beast that seeks its prey; and
close at hand in the Palace of the Lake where they sat, arose a
piercing cry of the lamentation of women.</p>
<p>"At last his mother knows," said Gulbadan sombrely. "I had
thought, when an only child died, the very winds would carry the
news to a mother. But no&mdash;she did not know until they put out the
light, as they had put out the light of his life. The love of a
wife is more. But, speak for me, beloved lady, all I have said, and
tell them this: that while these two live, the world goes down to
hell. Let them slay them, as they would slay the very Shaitan! This
is my word. I have spoken. Now leave me to my anguish."</p>
<p>Venetia still clung to her and kissed the cold cheek.</p>
<p>"My sister, have comfort. Shall not death restore what death has
taken?"</p>
<p>Gulbadan did not hear. Her mind was weary miles away, beside a
dead man in the palace of Mianpur. Then once more she roused
herself.</p>
<p>"Yes, and add this also to my words. They have a charm, very
ancient, written on a paper whereof I have not seen the like, and
this also they use for the bewilderment of men. Let it be burned
with them."</p>
<p>She spoke with a cold concentration that was fearful in its
intensity, and then drew her hand away and turned once more to the
lattice. Again the dreadful silence. It lasted so long that at last
Venetia broke it.</p>
<p>"One last word: Where do they hide that paper?"</p>
<p>"Revel Sahib wears it about his neck."</p>
<p>The voice seemed to come from a great distance. Her thoughts
were already out of reach. There was no more to be done or
said.</p>
<p>At the door she met Zaynab, white as a sheeted ghost, standing
on guard.</p>
<p>"The Amir...May the lights of Allah be his testimony!" she
said.</p>
<p>"She should not be alone," Venetia whispered, the tears falling
from her eyes. "Oh, go to her, and do not leave her for one moment.
The water is too near."</p>
<p>The curtain fell across the doorway, and she saw them no more.
But as she passed alone along the passages, she heard the sound of
bitter weeping from the rooms of the mother.</p>
<p>Food was brought to the party of three in the marble hall as
usual, but it was hurriedly eaten, for the news of the catastrophe
was now spread openly through the Lake Palace, and grief and fear
were in every face. Sara, too, was worse, and Venetia, though
anxious to be with her, yet felt she must not lose a moment in
giving the terrible message of Gulbadan Begam.</p>
<p>They went out into the verandah afterwards to watch the path of
glory on the water that led to the tragic city with the palace, and
there the Colonel considerately left them and strolled down, a
black figure, to the balus trades that overhung the lake, while
Venetia, in the fewest, barest words, told her story, trembling
lest even the leaves should be listeners, and then glided away to
her post in the upper rooms. The name of Natalia, revealed by the
old Begam, was all in all.</p>
<p>Seton immediately went down to the Colonel. He listened with the
utmost attention to the story, making a few laconic comments here
and there, and when it was finished, stood a moment consider
ing.</p>
<p>"This clears up a good deal, Seton. I think it certain now that
your ring was stolen in Cairo, and that they use it for the purpose
of hypnosis. He gave it back to you, no doubt, but it was taken
again while they had you under influence in that house in Cairo.
You know the Indian superstition of the Doubles? A pair of amulets
is made, exactly alike, and the wearer of the one is called the
Giver, and the wearer of the other the Taker, and neither can act
with out the other. They took your ring from you there to use on
Mahmud Mirza in conjunction with Revel's. What you are now wearing
is a fake. Knowing this, I don't fear they can hypnotise you any
more, unless, indeed, he gets the real ring back to you now Mahmud
Mirza is done for."</p>
<p>"But why should he want me? What good can I be?"</p>
<p>"A renegade Englishman&mdash;one who knows things they cannot, may
always be useful," returned Gifford gravely. "Be on your
guard&mdash;especially against the woman."</p>
<p>"You don't think she will break <i>purdah</i> (be seen
openly)?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. Now, for <i>my</i> news. The whole Peninsula is
breaking into flame, and at Cawnpore and Meerut the horrors of 1857
have been repeated, and Mongolia is certainly on the move. Russia
is pulling the strings and the loyal princes are all either
slaughtered or marked for death. The Hindus have united with the
Moslems, and officers from Russia are leading them. In Mianpur
Srinavastri is Revel's right-hand man, and finding huge sums of
money, and behind him is a man named Pir Khan, a Sayyad, a
descendant of the Prophet, and he is preaching a holy war, in which
all parties and beliefs can unite. If indeed your wild fancy were
true, you let loose a scourge worse than Attila upon the world when
you opened that tomb."</p>
<p>Seton clenched his hand as it lay on the marble of the
balustrade.</p>
<p>"If I did, I'll close it again, Colonel! He shall not find me
the fool he has always made me. Gulbadan Begam is right. The death
of those two devils is the only remedy."</p>
<p>"They will not be easy to get at. But make your plans&mdash;that can
do no harm. Now, for another matter. All our lives are pretty
uncertain. I think you should give the ladies this little packet
and tell them a few grains on the tongue will put them painlessly
and swiftly beyond the reach of danger. It is an easier way than
shooting. You had better have some too, in case you are
disarmed&mdash;otherwise you and I would naturally prefer shot or steel.
And, another thing: you should know how I communicate, in case I go
first. Swimmers brave the alligators and bring news under my
window, and there are signals from the town which I shall show you.
The password here or on land is the old Thug password: '<i>Ali khan
bhai salaam</i>, the Peace to Ali Khan my brother.' Now I must
despatch my message."</p>
<p>When they parted the way was straight before them as far as
human foresight could straighten it. But the unreckonable, the
unforeseen was at hand.</p>
<p>Next morning Seton gave Venetia the packet and the instructions,
his lips set and white, and yet half disbelieving in the reality of
the horror that was upon them. She accepted it without any show of
emotion that could weaken either of them&mdash;even smiling a
little.</p>
<p>"I'll take care of it, and I know it will make your mind easier
that we have it," was all she said, and then turned to another
subject. "Sara is worse this morning. I'm afraid she's very ill. I
wish we had a doctor. The Begam is prostrate, Laili tells me. I
pity her with all my heart. As for Gulbadan&mdash;"</p>
<p>Her look finished the sentence. Gulbadan still sat by the
window. Zaynab had moistened her lips with milk, but still she
neither spoke nor moved, looking steadfastly toward the city.</p>
<p>Towards two o'clock in the afternoon the two men, watching, saw
the state barges putting out once more from the palace of Mianpur,
to which they had returned after bringing the Begam. Revel?
Natalia? It was a moment of strained suspense, and when Venetia
left them to return to Sara, her hand was hovering over the packet
in her bosom, and the men knew it might well be they should never
meet again. At such moments little is said, nor is it well to think
overmuch. Venetia was perhaps the best off of the three, for the
time she could spare from Sara the Begam demanded, that she might
have her sympathy and a listener to the endless lamentations and
recitations of her son's worth and perfect loyalty to the British
Raj. The girl could not be certain whether she accepted the story
of cholera which was spread about, or guessed the blacker tragedy
which lay beneath.</p>
<p>Then, leaving her to her ladies, Venetia went and stood,
solitary, by Sara's lattice, to see the proud and beautiful boats
come over the water with the freight that must mean life or death
to the watchers.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<p>The state barge neared the Farhat Bakhsh in a dead silence.
There was no sound of voices on board The canopy hid whoever might
be sitting within it, and Colonel Gifford, standing by the
balustrades with Seton, used his field-glasses in vain. Neither
showed any strain of anxiety. The Colonel had always his little air
of frankness and good humour which concealed his thoughts so
effectually, and Seton really felt almost relieved that the long
suspense was ended and they were face to face with the worst Revel
could do. From the zenana wing of the palace, in which were the
sisters' rooms, there came no sound at all. Indeed, the silence was
oppressive. Their last news from Venetia had been that no one might
see or speak with the Begam, that Gulbadan Begam also was
invisible, and that Sara seemed rather better. They had warned
Venetia to keep to her room unless they sent for her.</p>
<p>Colonel Gifford shut up his glasses and turned to Seton.</p>
<p>"They will have landed in ten minutes."</p>
<p>"Yes. Have you formed any idea of what is likely to happen?"</p>
<p>"To a certain extent. I was watching then for a signal from the
city. They have murdered Kincaid, the Deputy Commissioner. Revel is
on board with Shirin Begam, as the natives call her. And I had word
a while ago that all is over at Fyzapur and the Russian party in
power. In Satispur also. Srinavastri has pulled the strings there
for them. There is a heavy account against these gentlemen piling
up. Our Government will pay it off one day. But not yet."</p>
<p>No, not yet. And where would they all be when that deferred day
of reckoning came? thought Seton. Not that his individual fate
affected him particularly; the men who have gone through the war
have little to learn, either of fear or hope, and Death has been a
neighbour so long that he has lost all strangeness&mdash;almost all
terror.</p>
<p>For the Colonel, too, things would be well. For many years past
he had walked with his life in his hand, and looking in his quiet
eyes, any one might read how little it would cost him to open the
hand and let it slip away like water, if only it were, as it would
be here, a part of his undertaking.</p>
<p>That was all right, and Seton dismissed it from his thoughts
once and for all. But Venetia&mdash;the women. How strange it all
seemed! As if Fate had taken a hand in it and led them deliberately
and of set purpose into this snare. It came about so naturally, so
inevitably, and now it had ended in this. Revel must have planned
it from the first, with ruthless disregard for their lives, but
what indeed were their lives likely to count in the fearful
holocaust that was being offered up in India now?</p>
<p>The Colonel caught his sad, fixed look and answered it.</p>
<p>"Don't fret about them, boy. Her courage is of a finer quality
than any woman's I've ever known. I have known women as brave, but
she has something behind all that&mdash;that shines. Besides, she has
the means of safe and swift deliverance for her sister and herself.
Need one so bitterly regret a thing like that, even for the people
one loves? Death lays an ungentle hand on us sooner or later; what
I have given her is a gentle one. Besides, hope is not over. We
don't know what Revel's plans are. The women's lives may be
essential to them. A man doesn't want to damn himself
unnecessarily. The whole world would ring with it if he injured
them."</p>
<p>Who could tell what Revel might do? Seton shook his head and did
not speak. The silent barge was drawing close to the pier. One last
word Gifford uttered as they turned to meet it.</p>
<p>"Revel is Ibn ul Farid. The man in Cairo was only a fake&mdash;a
nobody. Revel is the man. But keep his identity to yourself, and
remember, that if in any way you can rid the world of him, you will
have rid it of a monster that deserves hell as well as death. That
is my own fixed determination, and if I snuff out, I leave it to
you."</p>
<p>Seton put out his hand quietly and gripped the Colonel's. It was
the seal of a covenant that needed no seal. But Fate has her own
secrets. Did the revelation startle him? He could not tell. The
moment was too strained with its own revelation, now so near.</p>
<p>A moment, and the boat was at the pier. They stood watching as
the rowers tossed oars in salute, and the curtains of the canopy
parted and Revel came out, leading a woman. Revel! But at first
they doubted, and with reason, for he was dressed in a uniform
unknown to either of them except by name, a red uniform, frogged
and decorated with silver, and a cap of the German type with the
peak pulled forward over his eyes; a sword by his side.</p>
<p>"Russian," said the Colonel serenely.</p>
<p>Seton nodded.</p>
<p>The woman was dressed as a native lady, and the sari thrown over
her head hid her face completely. She walked with a light, strong
step beside Revel along the pier where a guard was formed up, and
behind them followed four men, evidently acting as staff. Seton
recognised three of them as officers he had seen in attendance upon
Mahmud Mirza. Now they wore the alien uniform, and apparently
without shame. The group advanced towards the two men who waited
there so silently.</p>
<p>Revel leaned lightly on his sword as he spoke.</p>
<p>"You're my prisoners&mdash;the women also," he said. "You expected
that."</p>
<p>"Certainly," the Colonel agreed. "We have no means of
resistance, but you know what you will have to answer for to our
Government."</p>
<p>Revel put that aside, smiling, as a matter of no importance.</p>
<p>"What are your intentions as regards the ladies?" Seton
demanded.</p>
<p>"No decision has yet been come to," was the answer. "For
yourselves, you are under arrest. You are responsible for them,
Azaf Khan."</p>
<p>"Will you have the goodness to tell me what Government, what
power you represent?" the Colonel said calmly, with a touch of
contempt.</p>
<p>"The Free Brotherhood, the principles of which, starting in
Russia, have overflowed the world. Against this there is no appeal.
It is supreme at this moment in eight of the principalities, and
the British are being driven into the sea in Bombay, Karachi,
Calcutta, and Madras."</p>
<p>Seton flushed up to the ears with fury. He started forward, but
the Colonel waved him back, calm as ever, though he plainly did not
relish the implication.</p>
<p>"The truth is best, however unpleasant. Are we to recognise any
overlord of this new order of things, Mr. Revel?" "Certainly, but
he prefers to remain unknown for the time being. All that concerns
the conquered power in India is that orders coming from Ibn ul
Farid shall be obeyed. The State of Mianpur is in the hands of
Shirin Begam, to whom her late husband left absolute authority. The
Deputy Commissioner representing the British Government has
fled."</p>
<p>The veiled woman stood rigidly by his side while he spoke. Seton
had a sense of eyes upon him, but no breath stirred the veiling
sari. Revel turned to Azaf Khan.</p>
<p>"Take them to their rooms. They overhang the water on the west
side, and see that boats row guard there night and day."</p>
<p>They were led off without any further notice. It was a respite,
however short, and already the Colonel's brain was busy with plans
for the future. It would not cut off his communication, for he had
foreseen all possibilities, and though the swimmers' messages must
cease, he had a complete code of signals with the city. His first
concern was to transmit these new developments. As to Revel's
words, he discounted a good deal. The Government in India is like a
majestic oak&mdash;the attention concentrates on the splendour and
strength of the waving branches, but none save those in the secret
know how far and deep the massive roots go below the surface,
gripping into the very rock. He almost smiled as he thought of
Revel's assertion. Driven into the sea? "Yes, but even if so, that
is our native element, and to touch it is to feel life and vigour
rushing in our veins," said he in his heart. He knew the men whose
hands were on the wheel, their tested strength and cool endurance.
They are never beaten because they will never believe they are, he
thought again, smiling a little as he went, and remembering Salway,
Outram, Coning-ton, Fane, and many more. In a way, Revel seemed to
him a very poor creature, even as men despise the writhing cobra,
though his fang is death.</p>
<p>The guard led them into their two communicating rooms, dropped
the purdahs before the entrance, and stationed sentries.</p>
<p>Revel and the veiled woman walked slowly through the rose
garden.</p>
<p>"So that is he!" she said in modern Greek, and her voice was
sweet as dropping honey. "Send him a dream to-night, Ibn ul Farid,
my brother, that shall make him desire me&mdash;for he shall be mine! I
swear it, by this new-fangled Allah of the Moslems."</p>
<p>Revel looked at her keenly.</p>
<p>"He is yours, my sister, body and soul. I have be devilled him
with dreams already in Cairo, so that he knows not truth from
falsehood. Was it not through him we have the prophecy and the
story of Nefert, the Queen? And we have made your beauty like to
her beauty that he might believe and be ruined. Very cunning have I
been in the service."</p>
<p>"Forget not also to commend Ibrahim the Jew for his fabrications
of the scarab," she said, touching the scarab on her breast set in
the outspread wings of Mut. "It was a mind, a great and mighty
mind, that compelled the dead queen of the ancient land into our
service and made her our slave. But now, oh, brother, oh wise one,
what is your heart's desire?"</p>
<p>"Power. Conquering and to conquer!" he said sternly. "To raise
Asia against the West and trample it under our feet, and to set
free the delights and glories of the ancient days to rule the world
once more and flood it with love and colour and pomp and music for
the great ones who know and desire. Down with these gray, dull
nations that toil for gold and know not its use when they have it!
Down with the weeping saints, the martyred ascetics, and up once
more with the days when men were great indeed, with the peoples as
slaves below them! Fear not, my sister! We will let loose the
armies of Asia on the West, and very greatly shall we triumph."</p>
<p>"It is a noble dream, my brother," the soft voice returned from
beneath the veil. "But what woman shall sit beside the Emperor of
Asia? What is life without love? Is it the Western woman?"</p>
<p>"What? With her cold, frank eyes like a boy's, and the ice that
runs in her veins for blood? No, my sister I She is my hold on the
Englishman. To bind her, to break her were a day's sport, no more.
It is Gulbadan, the wife of the dead man. I have seen her eyes like
wells of darkness and her mouth of crushed roses, and for every
stroke I gave him when he died, I counted a kiss from her. I go now
to her."</p>
<p>"What? And he but just dead! Brother, it will make trouble. Be
patient. These veiled women..."</p>
<p>"Must obey their masters, my sister. And now the queen's rooms
are made ready for you. Go in and wait."</p>
<p>He took her by the hand and led her ceremoniously into the
palace, to the wonderful suite of white and jewelled rooms set
apart for the chosen of the king. Already the second barge had
brought her women, and the slaves and attendants of the old Begam
were in waiting. There was concentrated the splendour of the
dynasty that had sprung from the loins of the Mogul emperors, and
even as they built at Delhi and Agra, jewelling their marble with
jade and malachite and lapis-lazuli and cornelian, so had their
sons built here. And in the midst of the chambers was a throne
room, where, seated on a throne carved from marble into miracle,
and inlaid with lilies of lapis and cornelian, the queen might give
audience with even her king a subject at her little rosy feet.</p>
<p>To Gulbadan Begam, crouching by her lattice, and looking always
toward the dark palace of the city, her foster mother, Zaynab,
brought word of all that had been said and done, and having
finished this, she added, stammering and trembling:&mdash;</p>
<p>"And oh, my child, my Queen, my darling, this new ruler whom we
called Revel Sahib, but who now has another name, desires to speak
with you."</p>
<p>"He cannot speak with me," she answered, looking away over the
water. "Let him speak with my mother, if he must break into our
grief."</p>
<p>"Alas, my daughter, it is you&mdash;you only."</p>
<p>"And why? Has he not killed my lord? Would he kill me also? But
if it be this, he is welcome indeed."</p>
<p>There was a pause, and the woman said, in a veiled voice, very
low and breathless:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My child, it is not anger but love."</p>
<p>Gulbadan turned a speechless look upon her, then fixed her eyes
once more upon the darkening water and the dim palace. Presently
the lights sprang into being and starred it all over and only the
Moon of the Amir was unlit. The golden reflections rippled in the
water, as if the sky had dropped its largesse into its dark
bosom.</p>
<p>The silence was so deep that Zaynab believed her mistress had
forgotten in the stupor of grief. She laid a hand timidly on her
arm and spoke once more:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Child of my bosom, the man desires you very greatly. If you
refuse, it is death, as I well believe. Consider, therefore. In the
name of the Merciful, consider!"</p>
<p>"Death is my heart's desire."</p>
<p>There was another long silence, and Zaynab could not see the
hidden face. Then Gulbadan roused herself to speak, but still with
face averted.</p>
<p>"Speak to me, my mother. This horrible thing is true?"</p>
<p>"It is true. He would enter now."</p>
<p>For a veiled woman, especially of rank, the very suggestion was
outrage. Another heavy silence. Gulbadan covered her face with her
hands and remained so long a bowed and speechless figure of woe,
that at length her foster mother, in terror lest the blow had
stricken her to death, laid a hand on her arm and forced her to
look up.</p>
<p>"My daughter, my Queen, may I be your sacrifice I will die at
the door sooner than he shall break the <i>purdah</i> (the curtain)
of a Mogul princess. Do not fear. There are loyal hearts still to
rally about the wife of their king."</p>
<p>She raised her head slowly.</p>
<p>"I am no wife. I am a miserable widow, and my life is worthless
as the dust of the desert. Draw the curtain, that I may see no more
the place where I was glad, and make beautiful my hair and eyes
that I may please my new master. The time for weeping is done."</p>
<p>The woman stood staring and terrified as she rose, stretching
her arms upwards, as if to shake off a weight of grief. At her
command Zaynab summoned two of the women attendants, and they
unloosed the silk-soft coils of black hair until it fell about her
like the veils of night. They bathed her lovely limbs, and choosing
among the stores of splendour, they garmented her in supple silver
cloth, with the great rubies her husband had given her glowing on
her breast. They braided her hair with pearls, and it hung below
her knees, and they darkened her heavy eyelids with soorma until
the perilous long eyes shone like stars in clouds and her cheeks
were like burning roses. And Zaynab, drawing back, said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Never have I seen my Queen so beautiful, no, not even on the
day of her marriage."</p>
<p>"That day is forgotten. Let me see myself, then veil me, and
dismiss the women and send for the man."</p>
<p>Zaynab led her before the great glass set in silver enriched
with jade and jasper, and the princess stood looking at her own
beautiful image, as if it had been a picture, with eyes of cold
judgment.</p>
<p>"Paint my lips. Crimson, like a rose of Shiraz. Put the silver
tassels on the ends of my braids of hair. Bring the veil of Dakka
muslin seeded with pearls and put it upon my head. And my
arm-rings. Now it is enough. I am content."</p>
<p>The women who had robed her looked with horror at her as they
withdrew. That a woman widowed but a few hours should be dragged
shrieking to the conqueror, they could understand, but that she
should dress herself out to win his heart, made her viler in their
eyes than any outcaste. There was no well deep enough for such
infamy! They almost shuddered to touch her as they added the last
exquisiteness to her beauty with the veil that half concealed
it.</p>
<p>"And now," she said, turning to Zaynab. "I am ready."</p>
<p>But the faithful woman judged her better than the others had
done. She caught her by the wrist, and then flinging herself on the
ground, clasped her knees.</p>
<p>"Have pity on yourself, my Queen! Have pity on the woman in
whose bosom you lay and smiled as you will never smile again. It is
too much! It is too hard for you! His fate will find him elsewhere,
in field or chamber, but never in the arms of a Mogul queen&mdash;he,
the infidel dog, the scum of the people! Take death from his hand,
not love."</p>
<p>"Be at peace, my nurse, and help me as one woman may another,
for in Allah is no help at all. I have prayed, I have besought, for
the poor I have made offerings and have kept all the precepts, and
what is come but death and dishonour? And as for death, it is not
difficult, but listen..."</p>
<p>She stopped a moment, as if to collect her thoughts, and went on
swiftly</p>
<p>"In the old days there was a gallant Raja of the Hindi people,
and he had a wife most beautiful and desirable and of a great
family, and, like me, a curtained woman. So his enemies took him
and tortured him. And as the sun set he lay dead in the cage where
they had killed him. Then that evening to the tent where sat the
enemy prince, drinking among his lords, came a dancing girl,
beautiful and shameless, and demanded admittance that she might
sing and dance before them. So it was allowed, and before those
lords she danced the foul bee-dance of the bazaars:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'If my love loved me, he should be a bee,<br>
I, the yellow jasmin, love the honey of me.'</p>
<p>"Not a step, not a motion of that dance did she miss, and they
gazed on her enraptured, and most of all the Prince. And when his
lords were gone, he demanded that she should lie in his arms, and
she smiled. And when he bowed to kiss her, she flashed a dagger
from her breast and stabbed him, and, as he wallowed at her feet,
with her own hand she cut his head from his neck, and with this
terrible thing grinning in her clutch, she came to her own people
in the night, and they took her husband's body and she entered the
fire with him and they were burned together. And to this day her
people tell of her great deed and rejoice in her nobility. Now, my
mother, if this could be done by a Hindi princess, what shall not
be expected from one of the Mogul blood? And there is more
too&mdash;matters that you know not. Send to me the younger Miss Sahib,
the fair and good, for I would speak with her."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<p>If anything could have amazed Venetia further, it would have
been the sight that struck her eyes when she followed Zaynab and
entered the chamber of Gulbadan. She had known her for many a day,
but yet the woman who met her now was a stranger. Gone was the
crouching girl, sullen and grieving, the half-spoilt, half-pettish
creature of most changeable moods, uncertain of herself and others,
subjected alike by her husband and the Begam. The woman who now
took her hand and drew her to a seat beside her was clothed like a
great queen, composed and stately; her voice had the ring of
command and assurance, her beautiful mouth was firm, her speech
calm. It was as though she had risen, a new birth, from the ashes
of her grief.</p>
<p>Venetia, pale and startled, lifted anxious eyes to her face. It
seemed for the moment as if they had changed places and
characters.</p>
<p>"We have gone through much, my sister, since I saw you. It has
made your beauty pale. The elder Miss Sahib&mdash;has the sickness left
her?"</p>
<p>"She is not well," said Venetia mournfully. "And you, Gulbadan
Begam, you have suffered also. My heart has wept for you and for my
friend."</p>
<p>"I know it. Better are old friends than new. But for me, I weep
no more. I go on a long journey soon. Presently I return to my own
people."</p>
<p>This appeared very natural to Venetia. She knew the Begam had
been more of a despot than a mother to the girl, and for a
childless widow there is little place at an Indian court. She was
even glad to hear it, knowing that Gulbadan had been an only
daughter of the court at Gondwana. She would at least be sheltered
and loved there, for her mother was still living.</p>
<p>"Pleasant is the road that leads home, my sister," she said
softly.</p>
<p>"My sister, yes," returned the young Begam, and was silent.
Presently she began again, with perfect calm of manner.</p>
<p>"My beautiful sister, we have for many years been friends. I
came here a child of nine, and for nine years your face has been
dear to me, though I had not many words, because the Shah Begam
(may her name be great!) has so many."</p>
<p>She even smiled a little in saying this, but Venetia could not
answer the smile. There was something ominous in the atmosphere of
the quiet room. She clasped the slim golden hand closer.</p>
<p>"But before I depart, there is one thing I would say. Seton
Sahib is a good man. I have seen him through the <i>purdah</i>, and
I know. Gifford Sahib also, a true friend of my lord. My sister,
the danger is great. What can I do as a gift to my friends before I
go? Speak with me, heart open."</p>
<p>Venetia rushed at the opportunity.</p>
<p>"My sister, there is a paper, a very ancient paper, which
Gifford Sahib needs sorely. It holds the plotting of these alien
people who have struck down the mighty. This is the paper to which
you spoke to me formerly, saying that Revel Sahib wears it about
his neck. If there are still loyal people in the palace, with whom
you can speak, that paper is all our hope."</p>
<p>"What I can, I will do," said the princess slowly. "If it is
much, my sister will rejoice. If little, she will forgive. And now
we part. But remember this, beloved sister, whose heart is high and
whose words are truth&mdash;If what you hear of me is hateful, still
believe I am true. If they tell you I am vile, say this in your
soul: 'Still! believe.' You swear this to me?"</p>
<p>"I swear," Venetia said solemnly "But as for the paper, put
yourself in no danger! Not one of our lives is more precious than
yours, and Seton Sahib would die sooner than you should risk a hair
of your head. And there are happy days before you, my sister."</p>
<p>"Many," the princess agreed gravely. "And very certainly the
jackals who now lie in the lair of the tiger will be driven out in
shame and confusion. Fare well."</p>
<p>With the same calm she laid her cheek against Venetia's, then,
drawing apart, clapped her hands for Zaynab, and stood watching
while the heavy curtain was lifted. Venetia turned then, and with a
last look saw her standing, a lonely and beautiful figure in her
splendid dress. She waved her hand, and they had parted.</p>
<p>With her mind full of doubts and fears, she looked forward to
the time of the evening meal, that she might consult Seton and
Gifford. Sara had been too ill to take any interest in affairs, and
in any case was to be kept in ignorance of the undercurrents, and
it was a very great burden to bear alone. But when she entered the
Hall of Meeting, it was empty save for the servants, and when in
deadly anxiety she questioned them, a blank wall of ignorance
opposed her everywhere&mdash;they did not know. Were the Sahibs still in
the palace? They did not know. Had they left any message for her?
They could not tell. This was the worst blow, and but for the utter
need to keep herself well and strong, since all now must fall on
her, she could not have touched a morsel. To add to her terrors,
when the meal was finished and she was rising to go back to Sara,
the great curtain was drawn aside, a man entered, and she found
herself alone with Revel. The breath was almost dashed from her
lips by astonishment when she saw him in the uniform that all
Europe began to know and to dread. It altered him in the most
extraordinary way, hardening and coarsening his face and
accentuating the Oriental strain which before had only been a most
elusive mystery in the background. It altered his manner even more.
The graceful, yielding courtesy was gone. He spoke almost
brusquely, like a man who means to be obeyed and chooses that you
shall know it instantly. His sword clanked as he walked up to
Venetia.</p>
<p>"I am glad of the opportunity of a word with you, Miss Grant.
There are one or two matters really necessary to be discussed.
Please be seated."</p>
<p>It would not do to show any fear. No, she must be ordinary and
natural, and of course, appear to expect the treatment they had
always had from him. She sat down quietly.</p>
<p>"Thank you. I have not seen you for some time, and so much has
happened since then.</p>
<p>"Yes, the death of Mahmud Mirza. The State of Mianpur is now
ruled by my sister, his widow, Shirin Begam. She is anxious to take
you under her protection, for, as you know, the whole country is
terribly disturbed."</p>
<p>"It is very considerate of her, and I beg you will convey my
thanks; but I hope for the protection of my future husband, and my
countryman, Colonel Gifford."</p>
<p>"Unfortunately," Revel said inflexibly, "both those gentlemen
have been discovered plotting against the Government represented by
my sister, and they are to be deported. You and your sister will
remain under the protection of Shirin Begam."</p>
<p>"Deported? And where? Then my sister and I demand to be deported
with them."</p>
<p>"That is impossible. The journey they are to under take is to
Kashmir, whose ruler remains constant to the British Government.
But the way lies through fear fully disturbed country and is quite
unfit for ladies."</p>
<p>Venetia's quick wit at once saw it was of no use con testing and
arguing at this point, especially as she did not believe a word he
said. He would simply counter her all along the line. Better, far
better, wait for the communication she was certain would come from
her men, and then act as they told her. She sighed a little,
hesitated, and said gravely:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You make me very anxious. But I know you will do whatever is
possible. As for Shirin Begam, it is a great honour, but if we
remain here, may it not be with our old friends the Shah Begam and
Gulbadan Begam?"</p>
<p>With the utmost difficulty she repressed her start of amazement
when he replied, looking full in her eyes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The Shah Begam, who has behaved in such an extraordinary way
that she cannot be in her right senses, is to be sent in
guardianship to the Gukserai palace."</p>
<p>He undervalued her knowledge of history and custom, and Venetia
heard and shivered inwardly. She knew the evil reputation of that
little palace in the jungle. Its history was long and tragic, for
in the troubled centuries of the Mogul reign in India it was there
that the deposed rulers of Mianpur had always been imprisoned, and
they had never once emerged alive.</p>
<p>With a great effort, she controlled her face and voice.
"Gulbadan Begam&mdash;" she began.</p>
<p>"Gulbadan Begam is to become my wife," he said, still looking
coldly and steadily in her eyes.</p>
<p>"But&mdash;"</p>
<p>She was on the point of protesting that the girl had said she
was returning to Gondwana, of crying out against the hideousness of
the thing, when his cool stare arrested and froze the words on her
lips. A sense of her loneliness and the dreadful danger that
confronted them all suddenly swept over her, and to her own bitter
shame, the tears brimmed in her eyes and spilt helplessly down her
cheeks, as her whole heart cried out for her lover and his support
and protection. In that moment Revel was terrible to her. She could
no more comprehend how his mind worked than she could comprehend
any of the dark, impassive faces about her, and it was an added
terror that she had once thought him so fascinating an
acquaintance. She remembered saying to Seton at Abuksa that there
was a mystery about Revel, things hidden and delightful that lay
behind his charming manner and might be revealed surprisingly at
any moment. They were beginning to be revealed, but they were
hideous, paralysing. One knew now that if one saw them as they
truly were, the sight would strike one speechless.</p>
<p>She rose trembling.</p>
<p>"Mr. Revel, I must go to my sister. I feel sure that when you
have considered, you will see it is desirable that we should leave
with Mr. Seton and Colonel Gifford, who are our natural protectors.
There is no danger we would not face with them rather than remain
here without them. I don't know Shirin Begam&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Who speaks of me. I am here!" said a soft voice at her elbow,
and turning hurriedly, she saw a slender, veiled figure beside her.
She had entered so noiselessly that neither of them noticed her
coming and Revel turned as sharply as Venetia.</p>
<p>She slid into a chair with the limp grace that these tall
slender women have, especially those of Oriental strain, and the
veiled eyes looked up at Venetia, appraising her from head to foot
even while the voice sounded like the sighing of angels. Angels,
for instance, who speak Hindustani perfectly, but with a slight
foreign accent.</p>
<p>"My brother tells me that the dangers outside the city make it
impossible for you to leave, Miss Sahib. I will do my utmost to see
that you have all you need. Ask for what you desire, and your
wishes shall be obeyed."</p>
<p>"Your brother has probably told you, your Highness, that I am
engaged to be married to Mr. Seton. You will understand, therefore,
how impossible it is I should be happy where he is not, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>Suddenly she stopped. It was terrible, pleading to that veiled
face, and Revel's impassive stare behind it. A sudden hopelessness
made words seem useless. They died on her lips. Her hands fell by
her side. She gave up the battle for the moment.</p>
<p>"May I go to my sister?" was all she could say.</p>
<p>"<i>May</i> you?" Revel's voice was suavity itself. "It is we
who are at your command."</p>
<p>She moved slowly away in a kind of terror that weakened her very
knees. The veiled figure made a graceful salutation with head and
hands, and Revel held the curtain aside for her to pass out. It was
a horrible travesty of their former relations.</p>
<p>Before she went in to Sara she stopped a while out side to
steady her face and voice, for her body was shaking like an aspen
and she felt withered and old. The terror had struck into her very
veins.</p>
<p>From the wing of the palace where they were imprisoned, Seton
watched every evening to see the light spring up in the rooms he
knew for Venetia's, but never a word or a sign from her reached
him, and he dared not attempt a signal, lest it should bring danger
to her. A silence like death had fallen between them, except that
sometimes the Colonel received a mysterious word to the effect that
Sara was well again and that the sisters had nothing to complain of
as to any lack of care or attention. He heard also that in the dead
of night the old Begam had been conveyed away to the Gukserai, the
lonely palace in the woods&mdash;which explained the sound of muffled
oars they once heard at midnight when all the world was still.
Seton could only wonder if Venetia had heard it also and guessed
its dreadful significance. The Colonel had now taught him his code,
so that he too could read when cloths of various colours hung out
by daytime in certain windows of the city, and he knew what it
meant when Ismail, the clouter of shoes, worked late with a couple
of lamps to aid his failing eyes. He knew how to send in return the
messages which told exactly what word must be sent to the outer
world from the city, how the troops of Mahmud Mirza had been
marched and railed to other States and strangers drafted in who
were absolutely at the bidding of Revel and Shirin Begam. And he
knew exactly which among the palace servants responded to the
salutation of "<i>Ali Khan bhai salaam</i> (the Peace to Ali Khan,
my brother)," and could therefore be trusted. And the day was very
near at hand when this knowledge would be necessary.</p>
<p>It was about a fortnight later when two important items reached
them. The Shah Begam, shortly after reaching the Gukserai, had been
seized with an attack of cholera and was dead. Colonel Gifford had
given her a month's lease of life, but the murderers were swifter
than his guess, and, as he said, nothing could show better their
fearlessness of any public opinion. Public opinion indeed existed
no longer in the city of Mianpur, whatever it might do in the outer
parts of the State, for the alien troops held the people down and
used and abused them as they pleased. Still, when the marriage of
Gulbadan Begam to himself was announced, Revel apparently thought
it as well it should be celebrated in the Lake Palace. The people
would hear less, see less there, and the thing be done more
quietly.</p>
<p>"I doubt," said the Colonel in his precise French to Seton,
"whether that poor girl's life will be much longer than the Shah
Begam's. He is marrying her simply because she was Mahmud Mirza's
cousin, and her people have a claim on the Mianpur throne. You see,
it will conciliate the Mianpur people, for they hold by the old
stock. But when he has secured that right as her husband, I should
be sorry to predict what will happen."</p>
<p>"The whole business is so ghastly that one almost begins to have
the feeling about life that one had in the war. There seems no hope
of relief or help, no light at all on the horizon," Seton said,
looking despairingly at Venetia's distant window.</p>
<p>"There's a sort of light in holding on to the end," the Colonel
said reflectively. "I should like to put the job through, if
possible. All my training has prepared me for this kind of thing,
though we none of us guessed exactly the shape it would take. But I
doubt if I shall see it through. The slightest slip by one of my
colleagues and Revel will know my business. Then&mdash;"</p>
<p>He slightly shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<p>So the preparations for the marriage went on, and neither
Venetia nor the men heard a word of the bride. In the city decent
men and women shuddered when they spoke of her, so foul a traitress
did they think her to the memory of her noble husband.</p>
<p>"Was the lake not deep enough for her to find death in it? If
they deprived her of poison, could they prevent her from swallowing
broken glass? What were her fingers for, if not to strangle herself
in the night when none watched?"</p>
<p>So they asked in the city, and spat when they named her name</p>
<p>Perhaps Gifford did not understand Revel's feelings entirely.
Even his cold nature must have been warmed a little by thoughts of
the beauty of the girl, for it is certain that he was reported to
be restless and excited as he had never been before. The jewels of
the Shah Begam were brought to the Lake Palace and many of them
sent to Gulbadan, and the tidings ran round the palace and reached
even the prisoners, that she had received them with delight and
profuse thanks to the new lover.</p>
<p>"Women are extraordinary creatures," said the Colonel. "What do
you think of one who forgets her husband in a month&mdash;a very noble
young fellow too, before Revel besotted him&mdash;and is not only
prepared to hand herself over to the man who murdered him, like the
Lady Anne in Shakespeare's play, but also to rejoice over the
spoils of his poor old mother? What do you deduce from that,
Seton?"</p>
<p>"Why, that Shakespeare knew an incredible side of women's
natures. What else? She must either be utterly vile or utterly
brainless. You can't make more of it than that."</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact, I think I can," Gifford answered, staring
out over the lake through his field-glasses. "As I said before,
women are extraordinary creatures. Have you ever seen a Mohammedan
marriage? The Mullahs come to-morrow, I hear, to perform the Nika.
I wonder what religion Revel favours among his many
accomplishments!"</p>
<p>No more was said, for a red cloth was hanging from more than one
window in the city, and they were soon absorbed in question and
answer.</p>
<p>The news of the marriage was a shock under which even Venetia's
faith might have staggered at first, but for her meeting with
Gulbadan. Of the Begam's death she knew nothing. That news was for
none of the prisoners, and she had no informants, which perhaps was
as well for her and for Sara, for the old woman was a cherished
friend, a memory of many years, and the knowledge that she was
doomed to the Gukserai palace overshadowed the sisters like a
cloud. But when Sara heard of Gulbadan's intended marriage, her
wrath broke out in flame, and no words were strong enough to
express her contempt for the girl who was false to every bond of
honour and duty. Possibly Venetia might have agreed but for a quiet
voice in her ear:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If what you hear of me is hateful, still believe I am true. If
they tell you I am vile, let some word in your soul say: 'Still I
believe!'"</p>
<p>And Venetia believed, and trembled, and was silent.</p>
<p>The day of the marriage dawned in cloudless beauty, the lake the
very azure of heaven, and the sunny sparkles dipping in it like a
golden laughter. The air was heavy with perfume from the rose
garden and the garlands that made the zenana beautiful with scent
and colour, but all was done so quietly, so secretly, that none of
the prisoners but Gifford and Seton knew the great day was come.
The latter knew that it would be announced publicly in the city
next day and there would be illuminations, a review, and the usual
feastings and alms. As far as Sara and Venetia could remember
afterwards, there was no sound or sign to mark the day off from any
other, unless it were a little more hurry than usual of feet and
voices from the women's quarters so close to theirs. So the day
wore on, and the night came, soft and lucent, with moon and stars
reflected in glory in the water.</p>
<p>Venetia sat by the window long after Sara slept, drawing
tranquillity from the midnight beauty. In that large serenity all
human passions seemed to dwindle and become insignificant. How many
scenes of joy and terror had those stars watched in the Lake
Palace? How many would they watch when all the anxious hearts that
beat within it now were dust? She sat there late and long, then,
drawing the curtain open between her room and Sara's, she crept
beneath her mosquito net and slept deep and sound. It was a night
of peace, even for prisoners and captives.</p>
<p>Afterwards, she could never be certain at what hour, she awoke
to the sound of a long and frightful cry. She flung herself half
out of bed, sitting upright, the cold perspiration on her forehead
and her heart racing. Something that had been pushed into her
breast dropped on the ground beside her, and even the light noise
of its falling turned her sick with fear. A flat envelope, very
thin, bound with a twist of floss silk and stained in one part with
a red stain. It was daylight, full daylight, and Sara calling
fretfully from the next room.</p>
<p>"The noise they make! Those women are impossible. What is it,
Venetia? Do come!"</p>
<p>"Presently. Wait a minute!"</p>
<p>It was a muffled voice that answered her, for thought and reason
had come back to Venetia now and she saw the instant need for
secrecy. She passed another ribbon through the loop and slung the
paper about her neck, hiding it securely; then ran to the room
where the huge earthenware tub stood that supplied them with water
and plunged her face in the cool water and shook the drops out of
her hair and eyes. And so, white, but clear-eyed and clear-headed,
she went in and stood by her sister.</p>
<p>"Was that a cry, Sara? I was sound asleep and something waked
me."</p>
<p>"I suppose they let something drop. What o'clock is it? I forgot
to wind my watch."</p>
<p>Venetia would have looked, but suddenly there was a rush and
hurry of feet and men's voices speaking. Men? In the zenana!
Impossible! They both listened, every sense concentrated into
hearing.</p>
<p>"Somebody must be ill!" Sara said at last. "It may be the
<i>hakim</i> (doctor). They let him feel their pulses through the
curtain. I hope it's Gulbadan. She deserves it!"</p>
<p>Again they waited, and nothing more happened, and at last the
terror faded away into the normal; and at the appointed time the
women came to attend them, and food was brought; and the sunlight
was gay in the ripples of the lake, and the white cranes stood in
the reeds, and Sara, sitting by the window, yawned and knitted
alternately; and Venetia might have believed it all a nightmare,
but for the stained paper that lay on her heart. But that was a
terrible burden. It was certain she must get it to Seton&mdash;but
how&mdash;but how? Even yet she scarcely dared to speculate in what
dreadful straits it had been gained. It might not even be what she
had hoped for&mdash;the last thing it suggested was an important
document. It was easy to guess how it had reached her. The entrance
to her room was guarded only by a curtain and the half-door,
latched across in the way known to every dweller in India, and
nothing could be easier than for any one to creep in, slide the
paper in her breast, and disappear like a shadow. Could it be the
bride? It seemed madness to suppose such a thing, but then
who?&mdash;who else would dare? Oh, hateful place of mysteries and
tragedies! She felt she would give half her life for freedom and
clean living again, if only those who suffered with her could share
them.</p>
<p>It was in the hour of the afternoon siesta that enlightenment
came. Sara, completely reassured as far as reassurance could go in
their imprisonment, was asleep in her room, and Venetia sat by her
window pretending to read, but thinking in a weary round of
repetition. And as she sat, the curtain at the entrance seemed to
waft a little, and a figure crept in very noiselessly and stood
salaaming before her. It was Zaynab. Her face was enough.</p>
<p>"I know&mdash;I know!" Venetia said, shrinking as if from a blow.
"She is dead."</p>
<p>"<i>Subhan Allah</i>! Praise be to the Merciful, the Com
passionate! She is dead. Listen, Miss Sahib, for it is death if
they find me here&mdash;but all are busy now. She stabbed him in the
night, and as I lay at the door, she came to me and said: 'Take
this where you know,' and in your breast I put it as she willed.
And when I returned she said: 'Go now, in the protection of Allah,
and be far from this accursed room when the day dawns.' And her
eyes were dreadful. And&mdash;oh, coward that I am&mdash;I fled. And when
they came in the morning he was dead and she was gone. They do not
know, but I know. In the lake, where now I go! Miss Sahib, I have
lived too long, that have seen the House go down in the dust."</p>
<p>"Oh, Zaynab, Zaynab," Venetia cried in a tragic whisper, "do not
go yet! One moment! How shall I get this paper to Seton Sahib?
Gulbadan Begam's work is not done&mdash;she has died in vain if this is
left undone."</p>
<p>Her eyes entreated for her, although she said no more. It seemed
that her very life hung on the issue.</p>
<p>"Give it to me," the woman said at last, and wrapped it in the
folds across her breast and drew her veil about her face. Without
another word or look she went out, and Venetia, in cruel
uncertainty whether she had saved or lost the treasure for which
two lives had paid, crouched half fainting in her chair, for the
moment unable to bear any more or even to try and estimate the
forces she had set in motion. But Gulbadan&mdash;Gulbadan! Her heart
cried the name; her lips almost shaped it aloud, thinking of the
warm, living, fragrant beauty cold in the arms of Death.</p>
<p>So Zaynab, hurrying by chambers and passages far from the
zenana, came at last to where the sentry paced before the door
leading to the rooms of the prisoners. He was a tall, black-bearded
man, very splendid in the dress of the palace guard, and glanced an
eye of contempt at the huddled figure as she hurried by. As she
passed, she breathed rather than whispered:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The Peace to Ali Khan, my brother! The death message of
Gulbadan Begam:" and, dropping the paper on the floor at his feet,
was gone like a shadow.</p>
<p>With a terrified glance right and left, he pounced on it,
flashed it up and hid it in his breast, just as steps came along
the passage and his Jemadar passed and found the sentry stiff at
the salute.</p>
<p>"All well, Mir Ali?"</p>
<p>"All is well, Jemadar Sahib."</p>
<p>"<i>Shabash</i>&mdash;well done! Pir Khan relieves you in ten
minutes. If the <i>Kafirs</i> (infidels) say anything you can
understand, report it."</p>
<p>"May I be your sacrifice, Jemadar Sahib! I will not fail. But
they speak a language I know not."</p>
<p>Ismail Jemadar loitered, adjusting the hilt of his sword, and
the soldier stood bolt upright, a bronze image, until he passed
along the passage and out of sight. Then, with another swift glance
up and down the way, he lifted the corner of the curtain that
covered the entrance to the prisoners' rooms and with a quick twist
of his arm sent the envelope skimming along the tiled floor inside,
and instantly resumed his noiseless march up and down, within
hearing of their voices. The Colonel was well served, even within
the palace.</p>
<p>Seton stood by the window, looking with longing eyes at the
water and blue, far hills of Seranji beyond. So short a way and
then a good horse between his knees and freedom ahead, and if his
friends were safe and Venetia beside him, he felt at the moment as
if crowns and empires might go hang for him! They would go away up
into Kashmir, into some exquisite fastness of the mighty Himalaya,
and let the mad world rage on its mad way, forgetting it all in
peace and the beauty that man made not, neither can he mar. To
forget&mdash;to rest&mdash;that seemed the highest happiness the universe
could offer. He looked at the Colonel, with his stead fast
field-glasses watching for the bi-weekly hanging out of Giaffar
Khan's laundry in the city, his shoulders stooped a little, the
grizzled hair showing over his ear; and that, too, seemed vanity
and vexation of spirit. And as he watched, the envelope came
spinning along the smooth tiles to his feet, and the dream was
done.</p>
<p>He gathered it up, hiding it under his arm, and went into his
own room, the inner one.</p>
<p>"Colonel, on guard!" he said coolly in French.</p>
<p>In a moment he had unfastened the envelope, for that room,
having no entry of its own, was safe, provided one of them watched
in the outer one. The Colonel was on duty there now, moving about
rather noisily to cover any rustle of paper. What Seton expected he
scarcely knew, for at the moment the prophecy was not in his mind,
but he saw this was of consequence, and the red seal of blood on it
stamped it. Whatever it was, it was not ancient; the paper, thin
but good, was such as could be bought in any European shop in
Calcutta or Bombay. He unfolded it rapidly and ran his eye down the
sheet enclosed in the first empty one.</p>
<p>"Verbatim," it was headed. And then...then...</p>
<p>"Good God!" said Seton under his breath.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>"To the great goddesses of Bast and Sais I make my worship, for
though they have betrayed and forsaken me, yet is their day
everlasting and the wings of their power sweep the uttermost East
and West. And to their justice do I commit Nefert, the Queen, that
her wickedness be not forgotten, and that in her waking she shall
meet the wrath of the goddesses and be again dashed swiftly down to
the gates of Hell. For thus hath she sinned. (Here [this was
written in English] is a break that must cover a long paragraph. It
then continues):&mdash;</p>
<p>"So, seeing her beautiful above all the daughters of Egypt, I
loved her, and I put my heart in her hand. And she took my good
gifts that I gave her, the gold, the jewels, and the slaves and the
peoples, and my heart, even the heart of the King, and she did evil
mightily. For she drew her brother, the Prince Mer-Sekt, from his
loyalty and made him king beyond the river, and she gave him gold
and armies and sent him forth conquering among the peoples between
the two rivers (Mesopotamia), and further, to a country in the
North, and me she took and put in chains and in prison. But to me
by night came secretly the priest of the goddesses, and he said
thus and thus: 'This is the word of the Winged, the Eternal, Who
sees, but not with eyes, and hears, but not with ears&mdash;Behold,
Nefert, the Queen, has troubled the world with a great trouble, and
to her is a certain time given that she may do evil, and then the
end.' So I said: 'Oh, holy one, what is her time?' And he said:
'Eight years.' And I said: 'For six years now have I groaned in
darkness.' And he answered: 'Endure for two more and it is done.'
And I said: 'I cannot.'"</p>
<p>(Here is another break. It then continues):&mdash;</p>
<p>"So when I was set free secretly I met her alone in the Valley
of Khar, promising her word of great treasures, and in her greed
she came, and she knew me not. So I stabbed her to the heart, and
she died, and again I took the throne, and my heart was glad. But
in the day of my rejoicing there came to me the priest of the
goddesses, and he said thus and thus: 'Seal down the Queen. Bar the
door with strength and bolt it with might and set upon it the
fearful names of the great gods, for her time is not ended. And if
she breaks loose as the lion from his lair, great and terrible
mischiefs are in her hand.' So I said: 'For how long?' And he
answered, 'For four years, and blood shall flow in rivers and
kingdoms shall break down before her, and she shall shake the great
people that as yet is not, upon the throne they have made in the
East, and they shall flee before her to the West, and with her
shall be her brother, the Prince Mer-Sekt. And because of them very
fearful shall be the calamities of the earth and very great their
triumph.' And I said: 'Shall these things be in Egypt?' And he
said: 'No, but in a land of the North where is the white rain and
water hard as glass. And with them she shall come conquering and to
conquer, and they shall trample the world before them. But because
they despise the gods and know not mercy and justice...'" (Here
were stains that obliterated the rest.)<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Seton read to the end, his brain almost refusing to grasp the
magnitude of the thing&mdash;then began again at the beginning and read
it carefully twice more. There was a note in shorthand overleaf. He
could read that:&mdash;</p>
<p>Original at the States Bank in Nimuegen.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>That was in Holland, of course. Having mastered it, he went
quietly into the outer room and told Gifford in as few words as
possible what had happened, taking his place by the window while he
went inside in his turn. It seemed a short time before he came back
and, with his usual careless air, pulled up a long chair and lit
his pipe. No one looking at the two could have imagined they were
discussing anything of special interest, for they spoke slowly and
with intervals of reflective smoking, speaking English, but very
low.</p>
<p>"First, Colonel: how was that got, and whose is the blood?"</p>
<p>"I imagine," said Gifford, with a yawn that might have deceived
the very elect, "that the bride has murdered the bridegroom. It
comes from her. I knew a daughter of her house would not sell her
honour. We shall get news of his death to-day or to-morrow, though
they'll keep it dark."</p>
<p>"I hope to God you're right," Seton said, pulling a spray of
jasmine from the window and tossing the little flowers into the
water below.</p>
<p>"You'll find I'm right. These women are like that. Of course,
you can see that a prophecy like this, used in India, as they would
use it, would set the Peninsula alight from one end to the other.
It was a prophecy that the East India Company's rule would end in
1857 that made the Mutiny possible and terrible. It was fulfilled,
too, by the way, by Queen Victoria's taking over the rule from the
Company then. These prophecies have a knack of fulfilling
themselves. But, Seton, this four years' business is important. Say
something&mdash;anything I I don't want to seem to be holding forth, and
then I'll tell you something."</p>
<p>Seton talked insanely about the weather, polo, any thing he
could think of for the next five minutes, Gifford throwing in
appropriate remarks at the proper intervals. Then he returned to
business.</p>
<p>"I must get away from here and get back to my base. The moment
I'm certain Revel is done for, I shall start, and you must carry on
the communications instead of me. You can do it now, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Must start? But how in the world can you get out?"</p>
<p>"I should have been out long ago but for the importance of being
where this precious pair were. Now I shall go, and you'll let us
know any outstanding events. This is a specially good time for me
to get a move on, because, if I'm right, there will be a good deal
of con fusion in the palace and Barikoff is not here yet."</p>
<p>"Barikoff? Who's he?"</p>
<p>"If Revel was the right hemisphere of the brain of the
conspiracy, Barikoff is the left. A very dangerous person. But your
part is this. You'll hear a splash in the middle of the night&mdash;an
almighty loud one! Rush out instantly and rouse the sentry and tell
him you think I've drowned myself. I've been despondent, and so
forth. That's all. It's better you should know no more. And then,
of course, keep your eyes skinned and let us know all you
hear."</p>
<p>A pause, and once more he spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>"And now the most important thing of all&mdash;a thing I never told
you even up to now, for secrecy is vital." He lowered his voice to
a whisper. "The keynote of our hopes is this." His voice was like a
thread&mdash;Seton strained his ears to catch it. "The Maharajah of
Junwar is absolutely loyal, though he outwardly accepts the Russian
rule and is serving as honorary general in their army in Junwar.
His soldiers will follow him to a man when he rises, and, Hindu
though he is, the Moslems will rise with him. We have brought them
in touch with Gulbadan Begam's people in Gondwana, with the Nizam
of Bipur and also with Prince Hazrat Sultan, Mahmud Mirza's cousin,
who is hidden in Mianpur city in disguise as a seller of jewels.
Thus you will see that Hindus and Moslems are waiting in several
places to cast off the Russian yoke, and naturally we're backing
them for all we're worth. But if this particular connection breaks,
I fear all is lost. Hazrat Sultan is at the back of the signalling
from Mianpur. Take word, take orders from him&mdash;from no one else.
Keep in touch with him all you can and guard this secret with your
life. On him all depends. If he goes, all goes."</p>
<p>"I understand," Seton said earnestly. "And now, one question.
Have you a chance for your life?"</p>
<p>"Only a fighting chance, and I wouldn't risk it, for I have my
uses here, but that this paper has opened new avenues of attack and
defence. I see now how they're working, and we can counter. If that
poor child could know, she would think it worth her life. Don't
worry about me, Seton. I leave a good man behind me, both for the
work and looking after the women, and this paper is my signal to
march. Could you possibly memorise it, and so will I, for we must
not have it about us."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<p>That evening the cobbler was very busy with his clouting and the
weaver in the next street was late at his loom. Gifford and Seton
read their news together without needing to exchange a word. Revel
was dead. His body had been taken secretly to the mainland.
Barikoff was expected in two days from Sellore.</p>
<p>"That settles it," said Gifford, getting out of his pocket the
cards with which he played solitaire. "Everything is watched, and
we had better not seem to be in serious talk. One last word. If you
come to grief, the people in the city will carry on, but, as your
life is valuable, don't get knocked on the head unless you
must."</p>
<p>Not a word more of consequence did he say, but settled down to
his cards with his usual absorption, while Seton, his thoughts far
enough away, pretended to be buried in the second of their books.
Not a sound of the life of the palace reached their wing, and
except for the barefoot tread of the sentry and the soft lap of the
water outside, they might have been in a tomb. Even the windows
were dark that night, and he perplexed himself with wondering why
Venetia's should be so and whether she knew or guessed what had
happened.</p>
<p>Then his thoughts turned to Revel. As yet he could scarcely
believe that that secret, evil personality had ceased to be. A
scratch from a dagger driven by a hand like a child's, and all
over! The bitter irony of life!</p>
<p>And what would it lead to? What would be the driving force
behind Shirin Begam now? Or was she capable of standing alone, and,
not only that, but of guiding the whirlwind she and her brother had
raised? Had she originally been the secret poison working in the
heart of Russia since the war? If so, anything was possible of the
woman who had set that venom flowing in the veins of the world.
Four years! If one believed in prophecies, she and her brother
might well seem terrible. How strangely history repeated itself! He
whispered under his breath the lines he had memorised: "And with
her shall be her brother, Mer-Sekt, and very fearful shall be the
calamities of the earth because of them and very great their
triumph." Frightfully true&mdash;but surely only because they had found
and used the prophecy for their evil ends? Dared he believe
otherwise? Could this be what Jadrup Gosein had shadowed forth in
his words: "A man and a woman burdened with the Karma of a most
evil past," or had he merely inferred the past from the wicked
present, as any Indian teacher must do? If he could but enter the
House of Knowledge, sit at his feet and entreat the aid of his
great wisdom, there might be some solution to these dark
mysteries&mdash;but how otherwise? He wondered if the woman were as like
to the dead queen as her photo graph made her. Probably not: in
life there would be many subtle differences to mark the imposture.
Should he ever see her, he wondered, and if he did, would she have
the impudence to refer to the ring? In that case he would meet
effrontery with contempt, and so...</p>
<p>"And now, good-night," said Gifford, rising, and driving his
thoughts sharply into a new channel. "In case anything should go
wrong with me, you'll hear it as usual. But, whatever happens,
carry on."</p>
<p>That was all, and after that what sleep could be possible? The
night went on noiselessly. The sentries relieved each other, but so
quietly that only a straining ear could catch any sound through the
curtain. There was nothing, nothing to hinder sleep but the
ceaseless working of his brain, until...</p>
<p>Suddenly and most awfully the silence was rent by a loud splash
in the water, and a stifled cry, and Seton, startled out of his
wits, although prepared, leaped from his bed and made for the
window in something un commonly near a panic. As he reached it, he
realised his folly, but utilised it instantly and shouted for the
sentry.</p>
<p>"<i>Puna-i-Khoda</i>, God protect us! What was that?" cried the
man, rushing in at the same instant. "Where is the Colonel
Sahib?"</p>
<p>For all answer Seton pointed to the window, and the man, wild
with terror of punishment, ran out of the room shouting: "Swords
out!" like one mad, until there was a rush of bare feet along the
marble and several other men arrived, headed by the Jemadar. They
rained questions on Seton, whose newly acquired skill in Hindustani
stood him in better stead than he expected. The Colonel must have
leaped from the window. He had been despondent, had spoken of
death, and now...Seton was silent, and then the officer leaning
out, yelled for a boat, and the plash of oars was not long in
answering.</p>
<p>Up and down they rowed, they searched, they shouted, but nothing
could they find, and Seton, almost distracted with real anxiety,
had no difficulty in playing the part assigned him. He was really
unable to form the slightest idea of how the Colonel had got off,
and was in such obvious misery of mind that not one of them
suspected him of complicity. At last, doubling the sentries, they
went off for the night, assuring him he would be strictly
questioned next day, and leaving him to such a weight of loneliness
as he had thought a man could scarcely suffer and live. Oh, for a
word with Venetia&mdash;or even Sara! The sense that some one depended
on him would energise him and make everything endurable. It was the
help less captivity that lay like a leaden weight upon him as he
envied Gifford far off in the bright clash of danger. Surely,
surely, if there were truth in the word of Jadrup Gosein, now was
the time that help should reach him Could loneliness be lonelier,
helplessness more helpless? But nothing came. The darkness of the
night weighed on him like a pall and for a while hope lay dead
beneath it.</p>
<p>With the earliest morning light he watched for signals, but only
the black veil of the cobbler's wife was drying in the breeze. "No
news,"&mdash;and the long day was before him.</p>
<p>It was, however, to be more exciting than he supposed. After he
had eaten his breakfast, the Jemadar, with a file of men, marched
up the passage and ordered him to follow. It might be to execution;
he judged that very likely, and if it were so, so far as he was
concerned he did not fear to meet it. But Venetia! That was what
tore at his heart. He thought of Bombay and the free open sea and
the English ships, like towers of safety, riding at anchor, and his
whole soul was one sick longing that she could be there, if twenty
lives like his could buy her freedom.</p>
<p>But they led him by a way he did not know, and through the rose
garden, and by a pavilion, and into a marble chamber of coldest,
most exquisite purity, like the heart of a pearl, shimmering into
milky rose and ivory, and there the guard opened out to either side
and he saw a woman, seated on the marble seat which might well pass
for a throne.</p>
<p>Instantly the scene recalled to him the great fresco in the
outer chamber of the tomb of Queen Nefert. There were the men, all
silent, all gazing toward the figure raised above them. The
narrowing lines seemed to converge on that, to exalt it into a
mysterious power. But there were differences. In the fresco there
had been no prisoner bound before the throne, and this woman was
not crowned, but covered with a very ample and semi-transparent
black veil which wrapped her from head to foot and hid her face. He
was only conscious of hidden eyes that watched him intently.</p>
<p>The men saluted, and she acknowledged the salute with an
imperial wave of the hand, and then, in a voice of thrilling
sweetness, addressed some words to Seton in Hindustani. He shook
his head. What she said escaped him. It sounded unlike the
Hindustani he knew. She tried Russian. He shook his head again.
Then French. Apparently she spoke that as fluently as he did, and
so communication was established.</p>
<p>She questioned him first on the Colonel's disappearance, and
there he could answer&mdash;that he believed he had leaped from the
window. Suicide? It might be; but if he were wrong in this guess,
he would be only too thankful for any news of him. Her next
question was whether he had any reason to think Gifford was sending
information out of the palace? None whatever, he replied without
hesitation. How was it possible in a place so strictly guarded? To
which she briefly answered that it would certainly be madness, but
Allah was witness that men were often mad and rushed on their own
destruction.</p>
<p>He tried to decide whether she were European or Oriental, and
could not. The French had an extremely foreign accent, though
perfectly correct, and she made the frequent references to Allah
that a Moslem woman indulges in as a mark of formal piety. They
sounded odd enough in French. Afterwards he found that every one to
whom she spoke had thought her accent foreign, whatever language
she used. Hindustani, Persian, French, Russian&mdash;all men and women
bore witness that she was none of their people.</p>
<p>It was the strangest interview. Not one word that they said was
comprehensible to the men on duty. They stood impassive, and what
their thoughts were, who could say?&mdash;though Seton knew enough of
India by this time to be certain that for a woman so recently
deprived both of her husband and her brother to receive a man, even
with her face veiled, must be anathema. Power, however, makes its
own laws, and in every line of her figure, in every tone of her
voice, in every queenly gesture, power spoke its own unmistakable
language.</p>
<p>"You have thought," she said at length, very slowly and gravely,
"that I took no heed of my prisoners, but it is not so. The sentry
on your door last night was I, and had you spoken French&mdash;"</p>
<p>He started violently and stared at her, the hair almost rising
on his head with deadly anxiety. She continued, unruffled, her
voice sweet as calmly flowing water.</p>
<p>"But it was your own tongue and I could not know. Will you now
tell me when and how the Colonel Gifford escaped? It will be better
for you if you do."</p>
<p>The threat was uttered as gently as all the rest, the meaning of
the words scarcely credible in the tone.</p>
<p>"I know nothing of when and how he escaped," Seton said
defiantly. "I waked in the night, hearing a loud splash in the
water, and that is all I know. I believe he threw himself in. If
you know more, I entreat you to tell me. I would give my right hand
to know whether he is alive or dead. He is a brave man, whom even
his enemies must respect."</p>
<p>"We never respect our enemies," the gentle voice said. "Why
should we? They are our enemies; that is enough. And as to your
question; you cannot think I should tell you even if I knew. One
thing I can tell you, however. I have to-day put a stop to all
communication with the city from a certain window. The cobbler will
cobble, the weaver weave no more. You will always see the black
veil of the cobbler's wife when you look across the water, as you
did this morning. At last we have discovered it."</p>
<p>His arms dropped by his side in despair. All was ended then.
What use could he be to his country, to Venetia, to the
Colonel&mdash;any one? In that moment he wished himself dead in
sincerest, cruellest truth. She was silent, watching him, and
finally he raised his head and faced her.</p>
<p>"Have so much pity as to tell me whether he is dead or
alive?"</p>
<p>"Your own fate concerns you more than his, and I have sent for
you to tell you it depends on your revealing what passed between
you and your friend yesterday. Nothing can save you otherwise."</p>
<p>"Then nothing shall save me, for I can tell you nothing. You
must do with me what you please. I can add nothing to that."</p>
<p>"Do you mean that you have nothing to tell, or that you will not
tell it?"</p>
<p>"I mean both. If there were anything, I should refuse to tell
it. But there was nothing."</p>
<p>Again she was silent, studying his face, then spoke with the
same gentleness.</p>
<p>"You must go back to your prison and think the matter over. You
may change your mind. Meanwhile I have one thing for your
hearing."</p>
<p>His lips shut in a firm, close line. Instinctively he braced
himself to meet a blow. She continued calmly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have resolved that the women shall leave to-day for Kashmir.
That State is still friendly to the English and they will find a
refuge there. Because I will not give a handle to my enemies, I
have decided to be rid of them in this way. Where is your
gratitude?"</p>
<p>For he was struck dumb. All that the Colonel had told him of the
danger of passing through the disturbed and rebellious States
rushed upon him now, with miser able memories of the terrible
experiences of the women and children, who even in the Mutiny year
of 1857 had to face perils less dreadful than those to be expected
from an enemy who feared neither God nor man and made Science
herself the procuress of cruelty.</p>
<p>"I entreat, I beseech your Highness, to keep them here in
safety, if you will not send me with them," he said at last. "You
are a woman, you must know and pity the miseries and risks of such
a journey. Why, even the railways are impassable, they say, and
Kashmir is in the far north! Your brother told me the women should
stay here."</p>
<p>"The railways are impassable in parts, yes. But no matter. It is
an order. For yourself, if you change your mind, send word to me.
You certainly cannot expect to go with them. You are a prisoner of
too much importance to be set free. And there are reasons. You must
content yourself here."</p>
<p>Then suddenly, in Hindustani, turning to the Jemadar, she
ordered him to leave her alone with the Englishman.</p>
<p>"But be within hearing, and when I clap my hands, return
swiftly."</p>
<p>They filed out, and in the silent hall were left only the woman
and her prisoner.</p>
<p>With slow hands, almost languidly, she began to unwrap the
transparent veil from the zenana garment of rich Bokhariot silk
brocaded with flowers, which she wore beneath it. Of a sudden she
blazed with kingfisher blues, royal purples, humming bird crimsons
and subtle greens, all blended in a harmonious and confused
splendour, sumptuous as a heap of jewels.</p>
<p>He watched her, fascinated by the lovely movements of her
slender hands and arms. Without a word at last she drew the veil
from before her face and let it drop backwards over her shoulders,
then, leaning her head against the marble, she looked full at him.
On each side of her face flowed two solemn rivers of black hair,
her full lips, most delicately cut and shaped, were of a dark
vermilion, her eyes, fringed with the glooms of night, were like
shadowed pools of darkness, and on her fair breast she wore the
scarab set in the outspread wings of Mut. At last her lips parted
and she spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Thou endest the night."</p>
<p>He stared at her in speechless wonder.</p>
<p>"<i>That</i> is the reason why you stay," she added, and slowly
drew the veil about her, eclipsing her splendours in its cloud.</p>
<p>Before he could move or speak, she had clapped her hands
sharply, and the soldiers marched in and sur rounded him.</p>
<p>"Take Seton Sahib back to his rooms," she commanded. "Give him
all he needs. Treat him with honour, but watch him night and day.
For if he escapes, I swear by the Prophet of God that every hair of
your heads shall answer it."</p>
<p>They marched him out, leaving her, a veiled figure seated on the
throne.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<p>It was very difficult for Venetia or Sara to remember afterwards
the details of that dreadful journey so suddenly thrust upon them.
They were awakened one morning with the news that they must be
prepared to start in two hours for Kashmir, and their knowledge of
India and its way, so far from helping them, terrified them the
more with the sure knowledge of the dangers and miseries which lay
ahead of them. Sara, not yet quite recovered from her illness,
broke down into helpless tears, and perhaps it was the best thing
for Venetia that she must put her own griefs aside and devote her
self entirely to consoling Sara and doing what was necessary. She
could not even guess whether Seton and the Colonel knew their fate,
and though she ran sacked her wits again and again, could think of
no way of communicating with them. She asked the silent ayah who
waited upon them whether she could see Zay-nab, but had only a deep
salaam and the assurance that Zaynab was gone to her own people.
Finally, in despair, she wrote a message to Shirin Begam to ask
whether Seton Sahib, "who will be my husband," would travel with
them, and, failing that, if they might see him, according to the
English custom, before they went. An hour passed without answer and
the ayah brought a verbal message from her Highness.</p>
<p>"The custom of the palace did not permit that ladies in the
zenana should talk with any man, and Seton Sahib had decided to
remain in Mianpur. This was his free decision. The Colonel Sahib
had already gone. If the Miss Sahib chose to write to Seton Sahib,
her message would be sent, and if he made any answer she should
have it."</p>
<p>Through brimming tears she looked along the many lines of
windows for a wave, a signal of some sort from Seton. That it might
be possible was but a fading hope, and she had no real expectation
of it. But they were all empty, except that at one she imagined she
saw a veiled figure standing. And soon they were beyond reach of
signals and the palace receded into the unreal and cloudy
loveliness that fascinated all eyes from the farther shore&mdash;a dim
white swan floating on a lake of heaven.</p>
<p>A rough cart with curtains was waiting by the landing place and
a strange ayah beside it, and that was all the preparation. Sara's
heart sank when she saw, for it was a dreadful foretaste of what
might be expected on the long northward journey, and though Venetia
tried to speak cheerfully, she also realised the slight intended.
There was nothing to be done, however, but to get in as soon as
possible, to avoid the curious eyes staring at the humiliated
Englishwomen, for ten or twelve people had collected at the landing
stage.</p>
<p>"<i>Allah Akbar</i>, God is great!" said one old man. "And I
remember their uncle, the great Kumpsioner Sahib, a prince in his
own land and here, and the friend of the King&mdash;and now it is thus
and thus. Who shall covet the greatness of this world? It is gone
like a breath!"</p>
<p>That voiced the general feeling, for there was no active insult,
and then the curtains were drawn and with much creaking and jolting
they rolled into the unseen streets, and the journey was fairly
begun.</p>
<p>She had felt certain they must pass through Lahore or Pindi and
that some sort of news might be picked up there. Not a fragment had
reached their ears hitherto, and the woman with them was silent as
death, except for her necessary service, and time seemed to have
resolved itself into an endless jolting in the half-dark of the
cart, as if all their former life had vanished and this were an
eternal journey in some strange, inhospitable planet, amid cruel,
careless faces that took no heed of what they suffered. A terrible
experience for two lonely women.</p>
<p>The last night in the train she fell into a restless sleep, as
wearying as wakefulness&mdash;the only sleep she had known since she
left the Lake Palace. At first, as she entered the confines of
dream, she was still conscious of the rough jolting, the clash, the
rattle, and Sara sighing and moaning in her unquiet sleep.
Gradually these faded and deep night was about her, without moon or
star, dark as the nameless beginnings of things, and there for a
time she groped, lost, bewildered, her heart burdened with a
nameless pain. The darkness thinned, as it does before greyest
dawn&mdash;still more, more&mdash;it was transparent now as thin water, the
victory of the light was sure. A bird darted through it, arrowy,
charged with a message&mdash;but what? The air breathed roses, charged
with a message&mdash;but to whom? The air was full of vibrations,
subtle, interweaving, thrilling, crossing&mdash;not music, but the
inmost soul of it, which at last, over-brimming in beauty, is sound
to the ears of men. She knew then, and rising, as it seemed, pre
pared to hear, stilling every earthly cry within her, awaiting the
choral rush of light from the dark, profoundly withdrawn from life
and filled with a measureless content. Out of the dark flowed blue
skies&mdash;a meadow of grass and flowers, a gently gliding stream with
grass beneath it flowing, as it were, with the water&mdash;a place of
unutterable sweetness and rest. A towering tree, a lime tree,
fragrant with blossom, with the dream-sound of innumerable bees
hovering about it to plunder its sweetness, raised mightier boughs
than ever earthly growth into the divine depths of azure. Seton
stood by it, his face perplexed and pale, his eyes closed. He
groped, more like a man in darkness than in the supernal sunlight
turning the very leaves to glitter and glory of refulgent green.
She could not hold away, she stretched her hands to guide him, ran
to him, hid her face in his breast, wept upon him tears of radiant
joy. The grief was past, the time of the singing of birds was
come.</p>
<p>Were one writing fiction, at this point it would be easy to
describe a visible assurance, actual work of supernatural
direction, a celestial fingerpost pointing a way that cannot be
missed. But in all the universe is nothing supernatural, though
there is not seldom the supernormal, which is, indeed, the normal
of enlightenment.</p>
<p>It was sufficient. They were together in a deeper sense than any
earthly meeting. He bent his head, their lips met. They were one,
not only with each other but with all the beauty about them and
some more bewildering beauty behind it. For the moment she was
herself pure spirit, comprehending the language that unites all
visible nature with spirit invisible, and inevitably as the
majestic resurgence of the sun from the rim of the ocean, assurance
blossomed within her that in all the wide universe is no room for
fear or dismay, that parting and grief are but the flying garments
of the departing dark, and that human events, happen as they will,
are the germ-bearers of eventual perfection. It was enough, and
more than enough. By slow gradations of lessening bliss, her spirit
glided down the heights of paradise to the colder levels, but the
atmosphere of the higher countries was still about her when she
awoke in content to the toils of the day, healed, refreshed,
shielded, and sworded against grief and fear. Sara looked at her in
astonishment.</p>
<p>"You look as if you'd been sleeping for weeks! I was awake
nearly all night, the noises were so frightful."</p>
<p>Venetia smiled. What was there to say&mdash;though all the world to
feel?</p>
<p>At long last, at a wayside station with a name utterly unknown
to them, they were bundled into the train once more, in a
third-class carriage like a cattle-pen, the windows curtained to
show it was occupied by women, the rest of the cars filled with
shouting soldiers. And then an endless journey of misery and
anxiety followed. Sara almost collapsed. She was utterly worn out
with fear and fatigue, and nearly all day long sat with her head
resting on her sister's shoulder in a kind of stupor.</p>
<p>Venetia looked for a halt at Lahore or Pindi, having entirely
lost knowledge of where they were, but though they passed through a
city which might have been Lahore, she could not be certain, and
they never halted. Nothing but that invisible strength sustained
her when, after having disgorged the rabble of soldiers at another
wayside station, the train went on some miles farther and stopped
at a small wayside halt where they were then told curtly to get
out&mdash;a carriage was waiting.</p>
<p>A carriage! She could scarcely believe her eyes when she saw a
landau and pair drawn up on the dusty road where the train had
pulled up. She put her arm round Sara, her last instinct to protect
her sister to the end, as a smartly turned-out native officer came
to meet the official who had them in charge.</p>
<p>"I now hand over in health, the English ladies who have
travelled from Mianpur," said the man sullenly and without any
salaam.</p>
<p>He turned away roughly and the officer struck him with the flat
of his sword on the back.</p>
<p>"Do homage, dog and son of a shameless mother, to the officer of
his Highness the Maharaja of Kashmir, and lick the ground before
the feet of these ladies. And take this vile woman with you&mdash;we
have other attendants for the friends of his Highness."</p>
<p>The voice rang gay and clear in mastery, the very note of
freedom. The man, salaaming like a slave, bent down his head to the
earth before their feet, his cruel face ash-colour with terror.</p>
<p>"Let the eye of mercy behold the repentant, Huzoor," he cried.
"It was an order, and I have but obeyed it," and so, almost licking
the dust indeed, crawled away like a serpent and was gone.</p>
<p>Safety had come at last with a clash of steel, and the long
strain snapped and Sara slipped through Venetia's grasp and fell
fainting to the ground.</p>
<p>"May the curse of Maheshwara and the vengeance of Durga light on
those Moslem dogs!" said the Hindu officer. "You are safe, Huzoor,
and welcome as roses in summer."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<p>It was little wonder that Venetia saw nothing of Seton at the
window. By Shirin's orders he had been moved into a room that
looked to the north during that half hour, and at his window she
herself leaned, watching, until the boat had pulled a considerable
way to the city and she was assured the foreign women were gone for
good. The letter he had neither seen nor answered.</p>
<p>He guessed very well why he was moved, and his very soul
rebelled against his helplessness. The Colonel was either playing
the part of the man or dead on the field of honour, the woman he
loved was facing danger, and he could swear, facing it gallantly.
He alone was shut up like a sick sheep in a pen, useless,
outwitted, and the world went on without him. A trust had been left
in his hands and he could not fulfil it. If only he could get one
word through to tell the friends outside that communication was
cut, and through no fault of his! And then the thought that he
might be believed faithless burst like madness into his brain. What
stories might not be spread and believed of the English Sahib who
had chosen to remain safe and alone in the Lake Palace of Mianpur
with the beautiful Shirin Begam, when all his friends were
gone?</p>
<p>When they took him back to his rooms and left him alone, he
focused the field-glasses at once on the windows that had been the
only voices from outside. Blank, empty. He made the agreed signal,
flashing with a light on a small mirror. No answer. He waved the
white cloth inside the window, careless now if he were seen, so
long as it could be known he had tried to get through, so long as
he could reach the disguised Prince Hazrat Sultan. No answer. And
at last he sat down to face the frightful loneliness, an almost
broken hearted man.</p>
<p>One night, as he lay in the waking lassitude that took the place
of sleep, he watched the pattern of moonlight filtering through the
marble tracery in beautiful shadow patterns on the tiled floor. The
shadow is often more lovely than the reality, and so it seemed to
him then.</p>
<p>It made a dream-story in his mind at last, a pattern of
whimsical, meaningless grace, to be watched idly like the play of
irresponsible children, a miniature world with events of its own
possibly as great to them as in the world he himself had once
thought so worth while. The futility of it all! And a passing cloud
blotted it out gone&mdash;and what matter? Now the emerging moon lit it
into defined figures again. A pattern; and life itself no more.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as he watched, there came an overpowering sleep. It
struck him like a blow on the head, submerged and held him fast as
a man anchored in tangled weeds at the bottom of a great ocean.
Dead, dumb, he lay, as it seemed to him, passive in the arms of the
Mighty, with weights of ages and oceans pressing him down, down,
into darkness. Dim green light, such as may filter down through
miles of green water&mdash;it thrilled, quivered&mdash;No, how strange! He
was mistaken. It was light, dappling through the boughs of a
towering lime tree&mdash;an uprushing fountain of earth, gladness,
rejoicing, bloom and leafage, and the humming of happy bees about
it. With delight his eyes followed the smooth gray bole that lost
itself in the heaven of moving, whispering life far, far above
where it mingled with the sky. Such a glory of verdure he had never
seen. Soft winds and odours breathed about it. They seemed the life
of the tree, exhaling in dewy sighs of content. He turned, and at
the other side of the towering trunk Venetia stood, her eyes
shining through the leaves like misty stars.</p>
<p>"I thought&mdash;I thought you were gone! They told me so," he said,
stammering with excess of bliss, unable to move hand or foot.
"Where have you been?"</p>
<p>She smiled, still standing apart.</p>
<p>"It was only because you were in prison that you thought I was
gone. How could I go away from you? They caught you, and you let
your mind slip into prison with your body. I remember a song&mdash;we
all knew it:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Stone walls do not a prison make,<br>
Nor iron bars a cage.'</p>
<p>"But you thought they did, and so now&mdash;I can't tell you how hard
it has been to get in through the bars. I have been trying for
weeks. I could see you through them, but as for getting in! I
belong outside!" She laughed, like the softest note of a bird. "But
at last I squeezed through. Of course, Jadrup Gosein helped me&mdash;how
could I have done it else? One has to know the word."</p>
<p>"And what is it? For God's sake, tell me! And come nearer. I can
only see your eyes through the leaves."</p>
<p>"I'm not allowed to break the rules. You're still in prison. You
see, you're only dreaming this tree and the blue air. You dreamed
it long ago, in Cairo. Don't you remember?"</p>
<p>"And am I only dreaming you, heart of my heart?"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;you see, I was able to get in. I'm real. I learnt the way,
but you can't get out. If you could, I could come round the tree,
and that would be real too. It's only a dream-tree, painted on the
blue sky you looked at so hopelessly yesterday over the lake. And
presently I shall escape through the bars again and you will have
to stay. Oh, if I could only tell you!"</p>
<p>"But I beseech you to tell me!" he cried, in wild anxiety lest
she should vanish in a creeping mist. "See, the tree is going&mdash;the
grass! Oh, Venetia, stay!"</p>
<p>For the tree was fading like a dissolving view, the grass was
drifting away like water. Through both he saw the marble walls and
floor of his loathed prison.</p>
<p>"I told you," she said, now standing apart by the window. "Why
will you believe the stupid thing is real? If you would only see
what is pretence, you could take my hand and we could float away
out of the window and be free together. There's nothing real
between us."</p>
<p>"But the word&mdash;the word?" he cried, almost distracted.</p>
<p>"The word is of no use unless you know what lies behind it, and
you keep on believing this."</p>
<p>She struck with her soft hand lightly on the walls and they
melted&mdash;the lake lay in dipping moonlight, a boat was gliding into
the heart of the night, the immense freedom of midnight skies was
about them, beyond the lights of the city were a galaxy of stars
far down on the horizon.</p>
<p>"You see," she said. "Nothing! If one knows how..." She thought
a moment and added: "When you know the way to the fourth dimension,
you can rise out of the prison of the three dimensions with a wish,
pass through them, step out of them. They are make-believe when one
knows."</p>
<p>"Teach me&mdash;I implore you!" was all he could say, entreating as
if for life itself.</p>
<p>She stood with the liquid glory of the lake for a back ground,
and beyond it the night leaning over it, jewelled like an Ethiop
queen, the moon for her crest-jewel.</p>
<p>"It's difficult," she said, "because your mind stands in the way
of your real self, which is stronger than all the strengths if you
would but set it free. Your mind believed they could put the real
you in prison, but they never could unless you had believed it.
That was play ing into their hands. Throw that false belief away,
and they can never do it again. Do you believe me <i>now</i>?"</p>
<p>"I believe you with all my soul," he said passionately, and even
as the words left his lips, the room was gone and they stood again
on grass, green and living, with the tree, a tower of bloom and
greenery, between them, the broad lower branches sweeping the grass
with layers of frondage.</p>
<p>"Touch it. You think it's real?"</p>
<p>He pressed the leaves to his lips and breathed in the dewy
odour.</p>
<p>"I know it. Painted&mdash;not it!"</p>
<p>"Then hold as fast to <i>my</i> belief and I can come to you,"
she said, laughing for delight. "Look! Watch!"</p>
<p>She parted the clustering boughs and cleared the leaves from her
sweet eyes and came through the path she made, nearer, nearer. He
saw her feet on the grass&mdash;the little feet sunk in moss. Nearer. He
stretched his arms and they caught her living warmth, thrilling,
against him. He felt the beating of her heart against his. Her lips
touched him, divinely warm and sweet. The tree lifted and blew
softly away, a cloud in the breeze. There was a cold sighing, like
rain, in the air&mdash;like dewdrops shaken from overladen boughs. His
arms were empty. He woke as suddenly as he had slept, and stretched
his hands to desolation.</p>
<p>No, not desolation. The message breathed from her living
presence was warm about his heart, the perfume of her hair was on
his lips. The man she loved in prison&mdash;a slave? Impossible!
Healing, new life, flowed warmly through his veins. He stood up and
looked out into the rejoicing world, himself rejoicing, renovated,
knowing beyond all reason that his joy rested on foundations
unshakable as the roots of the hills melting in, blue veils of
light in the lovely distance.</p>
<p>It was some days before that high certitude left him. He had
believed it never could or would, but the mind dominates the
average man, and the sails flapped in the stagnant calm and apathy
gripped his heart in its cold tentacles again. A dream! What wise
man would build on anything so false and fugitive? Childish! How
could any strength sustain itself on that flimsy food? The prison
walls closed about him once more, body and soul.</p>
<p>Two weeks later the Queen sent for him, and the guards who
escorted him were Russians. This time, in utter defiance of custom,
he was taken to a great room in the zenana, where the old Shah
Begam and the long line of dead and gone princesses and queens of
the great house of Mianpur had held their court of women. Perhaps
Seton did not know enough of India to realise the full horror of
the proceeding, but even he could guess (what the Colonel would
have known) that the arms of Russia had triumphed far and wide in
the Peninsula or the woman would never have dared to break the
purdah of so many centuries in Mianpur and in the zenana show her
face unveiled to a man. Furthermore, she was attended by two ladies
of the old Begam's, women of rank and hitherto of decency also,
who, unveiled, stood on either side of her chair, displaying bold,
handsome faces and trying very unsuccessfully to stand Seton's
astonished gaze without flinching. The Colonel could have told him
a little of what this would mean in the city, of the rage and shame
that would fill the hearts of the native-born, whether Mohammedan
or Hindu, at the new licence imported by the people they had called
in to redress their wrongs and who were now their conquerors. In
India the conquerors have been many, and many and differing the
manners they brought with them to impose on the conquered. Yet,
when the legions have thundered past, she has returned to her
immemorial quiet, and her customs, trampled down for the moment,
have grown up mysteriously, impenetrable as the jungle once more.
What the English have never dared in India, could the Russians dare
with any hope of prosperity? The sword is the lightning of a
moment. The heart of a people endures.</p>
<p>She motioned him to a seat in front of her and dismissed the
guards. He sat listlessly, almost humped in his chair; the long
weeks had told upon him and his tongue was stiff in his jaws with
silence. It had become such a habit that he scarcely cared one way
or another now. If she sentenced him to death, let her&mdash;he did not
care. If she set him free, what chance was there that he could ever
regain the treasures he had lost? And any interest as to her
history, her future, was dead in him. To the over-sexed women who
stood beside her it appeared incredible that a man so privileged
should never even lift his eyes to the beauty of the Queen, but he
stared at the marble before his feet and said nothing. It was
certainly not the drama they had promised themselves. The time had
seemed long when she spoke to him in French.</p>
<p>"Again we meet. You have not sent for me. I send for you. I have
pitied your sufferings with a full heart, but I could not spare you
until the time came. If you have thought me cruel&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I have not thought of you at all," he said, and it was all but
true. "Why should I? You are nothing to me."</p>
<p>He did not even look up. She waited a moment and then said, so
quietly that the listening women, who knew not a word, believed her
to be speaking of indifferent matters:&mdash;</p>
<p>"But you are much to me."</p>
<p>He made no reply. He was watching a patch of sun shine shift
almost imperceptibly along the floor where it filtered in through
the jealously carved lattices, making a pattern like the one he
knew in his prison. At the moment it interested him more than
anything she was likely to say.</p>
<p>"You are much to me," she repeated. "It was you whose hand
opened my prison and gave me back to the light of day&mdash;to the
beautiful world of life and sunshine and love. 'Thou endest the
night!' Oh, the long and frightful night in the hot, stagnant dark,
with the years dropping by endlessly as the grains of sand that
sifted from the rocks! What prison on earth was ever so frightful
as that prison? And you delivered me. Look up to my face and see in
my eyes the thanks I can never utter."</p>
<p>It was utterly unexpected. He had believed her first word would
be a threat of death if he did not reveal Gifford's secret. In
amazement, he looked up at her for the first time. She was
beautiful&mdash;unspeakably beautiful, the deep eyes shining through
unshed tears, the lips parted, revealing the little pearls within,
the glorious hair, like clouds about the moon of her pale sweet
face, where every emotion showed like the flame within a lamp of
alabaster. Most dear, most desirable, though not to him. She leaned
forward a little, like an apple-blossom bough swaying in a wind of
spring; a subtle perfume from her garments reached him. Every
pulse, in his body cried Danger, and he turned his eyes from her
again. Suddenly she drew back and stiffened in her seat. With a few
words she dismissed her women. The curtain dropped behind them, and
they were alone.</p>
<p>She leaned forward again, and in a voice of exquisite sadness,
as it seemed with the simplicity of a child, she whispered:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My words beat against you in vain. Can I find any that will
touch your heart?"</p>
<p>He said violently:&mdash;</p>
<p>"None. What you wish me to believe, I don't believe. To me you
are only an adventuress who has seized upon an amazing likeness to
serve her own ends. Terrible ends, too. If your face matched your
soul, it would be so hideous that you yourself would shudder at it.
I am not your dupe."</p>
<p>She opposed no violence to his. She only sighed bitterly.</p>
<p>"I am my own dupe. I believed&mdash;with all my heart and soul I
believed&mdash;that when we met you must love me because you saved me.
And now you look me in the eyes and hate me. I, who have known
death, think life more terrible of the two."</p>
<p>"I agree with you."</p>
<p>"And yet I must speak with you and you must trust me," she said
earnestly, "for there are tremendous things in hand and you and I
are part of them. You must make a great decision, and very soon.
But first, I want to restore this to you."</p>
<p>She drew from her thumb a carbuncle ring and held it out to him.
With a cry of amazement he saw it. His ring&mdash;but which was which,
for so far as he knew, his ring was already on his hand? He looked
sharply at both and could see no difference, then up at her and at
the scarab on her breast between the wings of Mut.</p>
<p>"What does it mean?"</p>
<p>And even as he spoke, he recalled Gifford's suggestion that
Revel had stolen the ring from him at the house in Cairo for some
mysterious purpose of his own. Instantly he guarded his lips with
silence. She should speak, and he would draw his own
conclusions.</p>
<p>"The one I gave you is your own ring. Of that ancient
inscription there are but two in the world. The one is on my
breast, the other in your hand. Both were a love gift to me in the
dim ages that are forgotten, and in the dust of death I carried the
ring on my finger. You found it where I sat waiting. Now this ring,
for reasons you shall not know, is charged with power, and this is
so with certain amulets and jewels, and my brother, in this life
called Ibn ul Farid, had need of one. Therefore, he went to Abuksa,
that he might see this ring, for the fame of it had reached him.
And he took it from you in Cairo, and after that had power over you
to make you see what he would. But the ring he gave you in its
place is nothing&mdash;a toy made by a Jew."</p>
<p>She spoke as calmly as if robbery and cheating were in the
common order of things. Seton could have ground his teeth with rage
to think how he had been fooled. Probably she was fooling him again
in some way he could presently decipher. He watched her with keen,
suspicious eyes.</p>
<p>"And why do you give it back to me?"</p>
<p>"Because its power over you died with him, and for myself, I
desire no power but what comes from your own heart. Your love is
what I pray for. Long, long ago in Egypt you loved me, though that
is a tale I will not tell you now; and surely, since in the world
our lives touch again, again you will love me as I love you. But
take the ring, for my brother is dead, and now I desire but the
power of every woman&mdash;my beauty and love."</p>
<p>He slipped the ring on his finger in place of the other. "No
doubt you set a price upon it. Speak plainly. What is it?"</p>
<p>She looked at him proudly.</p>
<p>"I set no price. My gift is free. Being given, let us forget it.
But there is more to say. In your prison you did not know the world
outside. In northern and central India there is scarcely a place
that our armies have not overflowed, as the Nile floods the land
for the sowing, and our harvest is near. And in the lands above the
Himalayas is a great stirring for the rising of the sun, and though
the dawn be red with blood, the day shall be glorious."</p>
<p>Her voice was like a song, she spoke with a majesty that was
eloquence itself, her beautiful face glowed with inspiration. Seton
dimly understood the wild and passionate enthusiasm she might rouse
in the hearts of men who heard and saw her, but she left him cold
as steel. He said not a word, but only looked steadily at her. The
Angel of the Revolution type of woman had no attraction for
him.</p>
<p>"But because we are winning so many hearts and swords, we need
more, and surely all the ways of Fate have brought you and me
together that we might go hand in hand along the ways of hope. Your
people have misruled and trodden down where they might have raised
and gladdened. Your people, do I say? But the term of one short
life cannot make an alien people yours, and long ago you were a
king in Egypt. Take my hand in yours, as you did once in the dead
years, and let us make a great throne, and rule in righteousness
and justice. Long, long ago you loved me. Love me again, heart of
my heart! Come back to your own people!"</p>
<p>Her voice was like the wooing of a dove in a drowsy, golden
afternoon, as she stretched her arms to him, incredibly sweet and
winning. But it did not win Seton. Behind it he heard the boom of
guns, the cries of miser able, despairing wretches whom her
frightful gospel had deprived of all hope. He remained steadfastly
silent, watching for revelations.</p>
<p>Her arms fell at her side; there were tears in her voice.</p>
<p>"If you could know my heart! If you could only guess that though
I am a queen and have great power. I am a woman, and wholly at your
mercy! Could you not pity me then?"</p>
<p>She glowed upon him with hope and entreaty.</p>
<p>"I could never pity you," he said sternly. "Wherever you go,
your steps are marked in blood. The men who trust you, you ruin.
Beneath your angel face you have the heart of a fiend, and your
teachings wither the world. Send me back to my prison! Shoot me, if
you will, but never ask me to hear your voice again. I loathe
you."</p>
<p>He expected that she would rise, a quivering Fury, and let loose
her wrath upon him. But no, only the great eyes looked darkly and
pitifully at him, the soft mouth murmured its plea.</p>
<p>"Once, long ago in Egypt, you were angry for a while, but you
forgave me, you loved me, you came to my heart. See&mdash;if our gospel
displeases you, I will leave it all! What is it to me compared with
you? We will escape together and far, far away, in a land I know
well, we will forget the mad world and be happy in each other's
arms."</p>
<p>Then the pent-up truth flashed out of him. He sprang to his
feet.</p>
<p>"And if I could believe your Egyptian lies, do you think I would
trust you? I have seen the prophecy. I know how the queen betrayed
the miserable king who trusted her. I know that at last he drove
his dagger into her false heart, and sealed her down, lest she
should escape and ruin the young world as she did the old. Are you
not afraid, here alone with me, lest I should choke the breath out
of you and rid the world of a monster? You are no queen, you are
the refuse of some base Parisian faubourg, where women such as you
grow like weeds in the ditches. Now at last I have spoken. Do what
you will."</p>
<p>And still she looked at him with a lingering sweetness.</p>
<p>"Even those cruel words cannot turn my heart from you," she
said. "The day will come&mdash;must come, when you will know what I say
is truth, and then all will be well. Now you shall go, and before
many days are over I will set you free, because I love you. I would
do it now, this moment&mdash;I would say, 'Go, forget me if you will,
but be free,' but that is not in my power, and I must act with
caution. You have no word for me. My last word to you is this: When
we were king and queen in Egypt, you loved me. You will love me
again."</p>
<p>He stared at her in confused bewilderment&mdash;at her amazing
generosity&mdash;the last thing he had dreamed of.</p>
<p>She clapped her hands very softly and the two women returned
from their post outside the curtains of the entrance.</p>
<p>"Call the guard," she said briefly, and so sat, with her chin in
her hand, gazing away into the dim horizon beyond the lake, while
the guards strode clanking in and marched him back to his prison
with rough jests and mockery. In that strange moment, he almost
believed her. He looked back through the curtains, and his last
glimpse of her was a seated figure, brooding over some thought she
could not utter. She looked a great queen.</p>
<p>An hour later she wrote to Barikoff in the city of Mianpur, and
despatched it by boat with orders to be speedy. And what she wrote
was this:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have done my best, and failed. There is no hope, none at
all&mdash;of getting the secret from him through me. The men of his
people have hearts of stone. They cannot be set alight. But one
thing I achieved; the ring is on his finger again. Since Ibn ul
Farid, the only man who could make him speak, is dead, it is
necessary that he should be at the mercy of some one who can
hypnotise him into speech, for not only is there the secret, but he
has seen the prophecy. And with that ring on his hand he is at your
will. Now I will set him free, and you shall know the day and hour.
The rest is to you, my friend, and well do I know that Ibn ul Farid
himself had not more skill in the arts that break the will than
you."</p>
<p>And when Barikoff read the letter, he struck his hands together,
laughing, and said: "I have him."</p>
<p>She sat very still long after she had written, and then, calling
a woman with her sitar, she lay listening to the languorous,
throbbing music and the strange muted song, until day died on the
lake and the waning moon floated dimly on its bosom.</p>
<p>But Seton, in his room alone, leaned out of the window and
dropped the ring she had given him into the deep blue water below
and watched until the last watery circle had died away into the
unruffled surface. He would have none of their witchcrafts&mdash;no, not
though his heart was softened by the melancholy kindness of her
eyes. In its place he slipped on the worthless ring that Revel&mdash;Ibn
ul Farid&mdash;had given him for a cheat, and after that he slept
heavily, as a man may on the brink of the grave.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<p>Eight days went by, and one day a little folded paper skidded
along the floor to his feet as he sat silent at the window,
wondering how to endure the long empty hours of the day. No one
spoke to him now. His food was slid in under the curtain as if to a
wild beast. He heard the sentries changing, and that was all.
Venetia, Gifford, all the world might be dead for all he knew.
Communication had entirely ceased with the outer world. No clothes
were hung out, no lights flashed.</p>
<p>He picked up the paper listlessly. It was written in French, and
at the first words the blood shot into his face and his heart
leaped.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>"What I promised shall be done. You are free. At twelve o'clock
to-night a boat will be outside your window. They will send you up
a rope. Use it&mdash;and go your way. But when you think of me, remember
that I gave you your freedom. Mine is not the love that would
imprison. It gives all and asks nothing. Yet in this life or
another, you will return to me, for our bond is eternal. Destroy
this with care. It is my danger. N."<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Once more he read it, and then destroyed it carefully and sat
lost in thought. Her words rang true, her face reflected them.
Could she be utterly vile? It was not the act of a vile woman to
let her prey escape, and by a way that might well mean danger to
herself. He wished he had not spoken so harshly. He wished he could
see her for a moment, that her last memory of him might be a word
of gratitude. All day, if there were a breath, a movement outside
his door, he fancied he heard the rustle of silken draperies, the
light footfall of a woman. But she never came, and of all the long
days in his weary prison, this seemed the longest. He grew so
restless at last that he could sit no longer, but walked up and
down desperately, trying to still the mind by the activity of the
body. Suddenly he halted and caught up the field-glasses. A
cloth&mdash;two cloths were drying on a window sill in the city. Not the
old one, but another.</p>
<p>"We will meet you," they said, and full of restless eagerness,
he threw down the glasses and walked and walked till his head was
dizzy.</p>
<p>As night drew on, he made a small bundle of the things he must
have, and then, to evade any watching eyes, he lay down on his bed
and shut his eyes, and the night began.</p>
<p>The long dark! It weighed on him like lead. Would the end never
come?</p>
<p>It came in the most unexpected way. There was a fall, like as
the brushing of a bird's wing on the marble inside his window. He
crept along cautiously, and lo, there lay a little arrow, such as a
child may shoot from the baby bows he had often seen in the streets
of MVlian pur, and that was all! No&mdash;as he looked closer he saw it
carried a thin silken thread attached, and then, leaning out, in
the velvet dark of night and water under his window a deeper
shadow&mdash;the boat. Instantly he understood. With trembling fingers
he drew the silk tenderly in until it ended in a knot and a slender
twine followed. He reeled it in until a strong new rope of
bullock's hide appeared, ending in a strong hook of iron. He tied
the bundle about his neck, hooked the rope into a bar of the marble
ornamentation at the side of the lattice, and was ready. One last
look around the hateful room, and he mounted the window sill and
let himself down, hand over hand, towards the water. If they were
cheating him and the boat was not there, he would swim for it.</p>
<p>But they were there. A man's voice whispered beneath:&mdash;</p>
<p>"This way, <i>Khodawund</i> (my lord), <i>Alhumd-ul-Illah</i>,
God be praised, all is well."</p>
<p>Willing hands received him, and softly, noiselessly, the muffled
oars pushed them ahead, and the Lake Palace was a thing of
memory.</p>
<p>Seton straightened himself, his nostrils dilated to breathe the
clear air again. He could not see his rescuers, for it was the
night of no moon, when evil things move in the dead dark, but he
could hear their breathing and the tension when they gave way on
the oars.</p>
<p>It seemed a very short time when the shingle grated under the
bow, and he stood up and shook himself like a dog, as if to scatter
the last taint of prisondom to the wind. There were two men on the
shore, two tall men, turbaned, and with cloaks thrown about
them.</p>
<p>"Friend, <i>Khodawund</i>, friend!" one said in a soft guttural.
"To the right, and swiftly."</p>
<p>He followed without a minute's delay. One grasped his coat to
guide him, for it was pitch dark, and so they went wordless, until
they reached a door that opened as if automatically in their faces.
A bright light flashed dazzling, a cloth was thrown over his
head.</p>
<p>With hands and feet bound and blinded by the cloth, Seton was
carried along what sounded like endless passages. It is useless to
dwell on the agony of disappointed hope, the sick helplessness that
was heavier than the hands of his gaolers. Then she must have meant
to betray him all along! But no, she had risked freeing
him&mdash;perhaps she would pay as dear for it as he.</p>
<p>But he could not think connectedly, his mind was a mere vortex
of whirling odds and ends of thought and dread. He submitted, for
it was hopeless to resist&mdash;that was all.</p>
<p>A halt. They let him down awkwardly on the floor, they dragged
the cloth from his face, and now he recognised the room. It was the
English-furnished library of Mahmud Mirza, but Mahmud Mirza's no
longer.</p>
<p>The soldiers unbound his hands and feet presently&mdash;big, hairy,
savage-looking men, stupid and loutish as beasts, a contrast indeed
to the slim golden soldiers of the dead ruler. They were laughing
coarsely among themselves at his plight, and one of them went and
kicked at a door and called in his unknown jabber, and another man
put out his head and retreated, and a few minutes passed, and Seton
struggled up into a sitting position, and stared about him
confusedly. But his brain was clearing. Now that he knew where he
was, he could guess pretty well what lay ahead of him.</p>
<p>The door opened again and a stout, dark man in civilian's dress
walked in, eyes as sharp as gimlets, sensual jowl blue with a
twenty-four hours' beard, nose broad and fleshy at the base, with
retracted nostrils like a Tartar's. Seton knew the face: not a few
of the illustrated journals had presented it to the world.
Barikoff, the most important man for the moment in the Indian
Empire.</p>
<p>He fixed his eyes on Seton and bowed slightly, then motioned to
his men to push him a chair and took one himself. He glanced at a
paper and gave an order. The men filed out at the door and he
opened the talk in perfect French the moment they were alone.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to incommode you, sir, but military necessity has no
law, and you have been caught in the act of escaping. You will
almost anticipate my next words."</p>
<p>"Death," said Seton.</p>
<p>"Precisely."</p>
<p>A pause. Then Seton said coolly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Then why delay? I am ready."</p>
<p>"Because a few questions are necessary first, and if I find you
in the right frame of mind, it is possible we may suggest another
way. Did any one in the palace help your escape?"</p>
<p>Naturally he could not give her away.</p>
<p>"No one."</p>
<p>Barikoff laughed a little, softly, as if a relishing thought
were in his mind.</p>
<p>"Well, well! We must not ask too closely where a woman and a
good-looking young man are concerned. Our teaching is not hard upon
little human peccadilloes. But we must not let her tenderness lead
us into forgetful ness of political needs. I will come to the point
at once. When Colonel Gifford left you, we have reason to believe
he confided a military secret to you. We want it."</p>
<p>"I have no secret."</p>
<p>Barikoff yawned ostentatiously.</p>
<p>"Surely," he said, "we can get past all the inevitables and to
business? Can I speak plainer? You hold the key to a situation that
delays and puzzles us. We mean to have it. And there is a further
matter. A paper has disappeared which Mr. Revel carried about with
him. Do you know anything of it?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"You will be wise to reconsider that reply.</p>
<p>"You have my answer."</p>
<p>"I hope you will not put us to the pain of drastic measures?
Contrary to the world's belief, the Free Brotherhood is merciful.
What we should like best of all is that you should throw in your
lot with ours frankly&mdash;"</p>
<p>Seton did not waste a word. He laughed.</p>
<p>"Ah, I imagined that would be your reply. Then we must take the
other line. Understand clearly, we must have that secret. The want
of it is halting us all along the line. Have you ever realised that
there is such a thing as torture, and that it did not end with the
Middle Ages?"</p>
<p>"I realise what you say."</p>
<p>"Then&mdash;still, no?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>A great quiet was in the huge room. He could hear Barikoff's
heavy breathing, he could hear his own heartbeats. He raised his
hand, and saw the ring on his finger.</p>
<p>That ring&mdash;it had been the centre of so much. Why had she given
it back so generously? Was there more than lay on the surface in
the gift? He was wandering in a maze of deceit, but was it possible
that this could be a clue? Now he went over her words in his mind,
while Barikoff stared at him. "And Ibn ul Farid took it after he
had used it on you in Cairo, and after that because it had power to
make you see what he would." Power? Then had she given it back that
some else might succeed to that power, might use him,
might...Surely this was a folly of the Dark Ages&mdash;it could not be!
Yet again&mdash;Cairo. What had he done in Cairo when he believed he was
in the vaults of the Museum? Where had he been during that lost
hour? Why had Gifford said to him: "Beware lest they hypnotise you
again&mdash;it is always easier after the first time "? They should not.
He swore it to himself, with Barikoff's un wavering stare upon
him.</p>
<p>And then&mdash;then, like a flash of light in the darkness, a thought
came to him, a resolution.</p>
<p>"You see," Barikoff went on, "the hard necessity of the case. We
have no wish to kill you. If we could get what we need, you are
perfectly at liberty to make your way out of Mianpur and to your
friends. If you <i>can!</i>"</p>
<p>The last sentence was sinister. Seton put his hand to his head
wearily.</p>
<p>"I don't ask for mercy, and I will not tell you what I know&mdash;but
may I ask this much? I can't collect my thoughts, I am dead
tired&mdash;even while I speak, my brain is whirling and aching, the
pain is almost unbearable: may we postpone this talk until
to-morrow? I hope then to show myself a man."</p>
<p>Barikoff leaned toward him, looking straight into his eyes.</p>
<p>"I was once a physician. Yes, I see you are exhausted&mdash;the pain
is in the temples&mdash;I know. Look up at me&mdash;I may magnetise it away.
We want your brain clear for our own purposes."</p>
<p>Seton fixed his eyes on Barikoff's, with a weak motion of his
hands as if to repel something he dreaded. They stared at each
other, for what seemed more than a minute, then he said
feebly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;that's better&mdash;that rests me. The relief is extraordinary.
How do you do it?"</p>
<p>Barikoff, without relaxing his gaze, drew a small, glittering
object from his pocket and held it up.</p>
<p>"Look at this!"</p>
<p>Seton obeyed mechanically, with the dull movements of a man
drowsing awake. In a minute more his eyes had closed, his head fell
back upon the chair, he was apparently in a deep sleep. Barikoff
whistled softly, scarcely above his breath, and a tall thin man
came in. He had a dry precise manner and gold spectacles fixed on a
hawk's beak of a nose.</p>
<p>"Test his eyes, doctor. I want to be sure."</p>
<p>Seton held to his resolution with a grip of iron while the man
rolled his eyelid back between his finger and thumb.</p>
<p>"<i>Ja, es geht gut</i>," he said in German. "But I'll try the
pin trick, too. Better be sure."</p>
<p>He took a pin from the lapel of his coat and ran it right into
the patient's arm. There was not a flinch or a wince. It might have
run into putty.</p>
<p>"Ach so! You can go on. He is off. I should not say he was a
good subject, but according to Ibn ul Farid, the ring is a hypnotic
charm, especially once it has succeeded. He said it would react
instantly."</p>
<p>"Absolutely. And we can get him afterwards when ever we want.
Now, watch. I ask him."</p>
<p>He leaned forward.</p>
<p>"Can you see?"</p>
<p>A dull voice from Seton's lips, but unlike his own,
answered:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"I make you see a room in the Lake Palace, and your self and
Colonel Gifford. Do you see now?"</p>
<p>"I see."</p>
<p>"Do you hear?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;his voice."</p>
<p>"Repeat to me exactly what Colonel Gifford told you of the plans
you were to remember. You are now in that room, you hear him."</p>
<p>A struggle in the throat&mdash;the voice hoarse and whisper ing, as
if in agony:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I cannot&mdash;I cannot!"</p>
<p>"You must. Begin at the beginning. I wait."</p>
<p>The voice faltered, stammered. There was a long wait. Barikoff
remained deep-still, his eyes fixed greedily on the working face
before him. Then the voice made way, as if through some impediment
in the throat, and flowed on in a weak, faltering rill of
sound.</p>
<p>"He said this, this&mdash;'The most important thing of all, the thing
I never told even you up to this. It's vital. We counted on the
Maharaja of Junwar, and he sold us. He is hand and glove with the
Russians. Trust him no longer. Rao Singh has taken his place. He is
in Sellore now. All the wires run through him. He is to give the
signal for the rising. We have powerful friends among the Russians
and Barikoff himself is sold to us. Barikoff! We can get him
directly the signal is given. Others also. We have spent much money
among the Russians. At the end Ibn ul Farid was playing our game.
Get yourself kept in Mianpur. On no account leave. If you are
killed Rao Singh will take on and Weardale will go in. He can pass
as a native anywhere. They will never trap him. The signal for the
rising is a rocket from the Hathi Bagh.'"</p>
<p>The voice stopped for a moment, and Barikoff put another
question.</p>
<p>"Does he say who had betrayed Barikoff?"</p>
<p>"No. A secret for the heads, and I never knew." Then,
suddenly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My God, have I said? Oh, the hell of having to remember&mdash;to
have it dragged out of me! Stop, stop! Let me go!"</p>
<p>"He's beginning to come to," the doctor said, leaning over
him.</p>
<p>"Is there any more?" Barikoff demanded ruthlessly, but with lips
ash-white.</p>
<p>"Nothing. Nothing." The head fell back. He was sinking into a
sleep of stupor. "Oh, the lake and the prison and the endless
days!" he muttered.</p>
<p>The doctor rolled up his eyelid again.</p>
<p>"Test him quick, if you want to, or I will. How did Gifford
escape? Was he drowned?"</p>
<p>"He planned it to look like suicide. He said: 'Stay there. Say
nothing.' I stayed."</p>
<p>"You see!" the doctor said coolly. "He wouldn't have revealed
that willingly. Yes, we have had an authentic revelation,
undoubtedly. Ask quick. This will be the last chance."</p>
<p>"Where is the paper? Was it destroyed?"</p>
<p>"No, no. In a cylinder. In the lake. Under our window. Oh, wake
me! I am in agony. Wake me!" "By the Holy Trinity!" said Barikoff,
using a very obsolete Russian oath, and then fell silent.</p>
<p>He looked suspiciously at the doctor. The doctor looked with
equal suspicion at him.</p>
<p>"Friends? If I knew their friends they should have a short
shrift and a long rope. If it were conceivable&mdash;"</p>
<p>"The entirely damnable thing is that this Gifford has escaped,
and no one knows how," said the doctor, meeting the glance
resolutely. "What will you do with this man? Is it any use to shoot
him? If so&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Use? Are you a fool?" Barikoff was furious. "No, no. Didn't you
hear what he said? Set him free and watch him. See whom he gets in
touch with. See who helps him. Get him out of the place, or we
shall have Weardale, who is a real danger; we shot for the sake of
shooting at first, and were the devil's own fools for our pains No,
no. Track the dog every inch of his way. It concerns me more at
this moment to know who are the traitors among us than even to
trace the Junwar plot. Who is Rao Singh? We must know. We must warn
Junwar. Will this man remember anything he has said when he
wakes?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. I'll wake him now. First you tell him he's to
wake."</p>
<p>"Wake, it's over. Wake!" said Barikoff in a tone of command.</p>
<p>Seton's eyelids did not move.</p>
<p>"I tell you&mdash;Wake!"</p>
<p>Still he lay immovable.</p>
<p>"Sometimes it affects the heart," said the doctor.</p>
<p>"Hold hard, I'll try this. But first&mdash;do you want the ring
again?"</p>
<p>"Not I. While he wears it we can affect him even at a distance.
Ibn ul Farid said so. We may want him yet."</p>
<p>The doctor opened his little medicine case and broke a capsule
of nitrate of amyl under Seton's nose. The pungent smell brought
the blood rushing to his face and his eyelids flickered, opened
feebly, closed, opened again on Barikoff.</p>
<p>"You sent me to sleep," he said feebly. "A heavenly rest. My
head's better already. You gentlemen are not perhaps quite so black
as you're painted."</p>
<p>"We could scarcely be as black as that," Barikoff replied, with
a laugh that attempted bonhomie rather unsuccessfully. "But I hope
you will sleep well to-night. You have a long journey before you
to-morrow."</p>
<p>"A journey? Where? Are you going to shoot me?"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;why should we? I do assure you we are not devils incarnate.
You can do us no harm and there's no object in shooting you.
Indeed, we respect your courage in refusing to betray your
secret."</p>
<p>He showed wolf's teeth as he smiled amiably. Seton thanked him
gravely and briefly.</p>
<p>"Show the gentleman where he is to sleep, doctor." And as the
doctor left the room with Seton behind him, Barikoff said under his
breath:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I always distrusted that devil, the doctor. He was Orsinoff's
creature. I dare swear he's one of those in the British pay, and a
doctor has a lot in his power. A pinch of stuff in a man's food,
and pouff!&mdash;the thing's done. I'll have him watched night and
day."</p>
<p>Precisely the reflection passing through the doctor's mind, as
he led Seton away, talking with the utmost courtesy. And Seton,
half an hour later, lying in a comfortable European bed, said to
himself in the dark:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Not a bad inspiration on the spur of the moment. Gifford would
have liked it, I think. They'll have some trouble in finding Rao
Singh&mdash;can't think how the name came into my head. And
Weardale&mdash;Conway used to rag me about being an imaginative fellow,
but it comes in useful sometimes. And if they shoot me to-morrow,
at least I've set them by the ears. I wish to God I could have
understood what they said to each other! That was the only
blot&mdash;but a man can't have everything in this world."</p>
<p>He turned on his side and slept the sleep of the just.</p>
<p>Thus it befell that next morning Seton, on a good horse, and a
safe-conduct in his pocket, was passed out at the Sikanderbagh
Gate, with the world before him where to choose. He said
incidentally that he inclined to make for Kashmir, and parted,
quite pleasantly, with Barikoff, who, begging him to observe that
Russians were much the same as other men when it came to human
feeling, returned to keep an eye on the doctor in return for the
doctor's eye on him, and to detail a spy to look after Seton. And
the incident thus dosed pleasantly and profitably for all
concerned.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<p>Six weeks went by, and nearly all India was aflame. Kashmir and
one or two other states were unseduced by the Russian lure, and to
a man the princes themselves were loyal, in spite of terrible
sufferings and dangers. In the south one great state was pulling
itself together shamefacedly after its debauch of Russian thought
and action and its ruler had been entreated to return. This formed
a rallying point for the British. But frightful, unforgettable
things had been done there and elsewhere under Russian inspiration,
the people themselves having suffered worst of all for their
misplaced trust. And the sky was black with thunder.</p>
<p>Venetia, in Srinagar, heard the news from the resident, a very
old family friend&mdash;such news as he judged well to tell. Much it was
as well to keep from women's ears. He came there each day with his
gazette of selections.</p>
<p>"Colonel Gifford is the hero of the Secret Service," he
announced, sitting in the comfortable cabin of the house-boat
<i>Dilkushar</i>, which the sisters had rented. "He brought them
priceless news from Mianpur, where most of the Russian bigwigs
concentrated. But his escape was the record for all time."</p>
<p>"How did he do it?" Sara asked eagerly. "Can it be told?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, for it's the kind of thing that might always be
repeated by the right man. He followed the plan by which Burton
made his famous journey to Mecca. He became a Pathan from Rahmat
Ullah, skilled in medicine. His friends in Mianpur dyed his hair
and stained his face, and the rest was easy. He knows every trick,
every turn of the lingo, and was doctoring the Russian soldiers all
along the route and made his way into Chester's camp at Diglao,
simply chock-full of information. You know him, Miss Grant. Is it
true that he has an air that is childlike and bland? They say he
looks like an especially frank schoolboy."</p>
<p>"I should think so! I don't&mdash;I won't believe he's a Secret
Service man!" cried Sara. "There's nothing secret or tricky about
Colonel Gifford. Don't ask me to believe it. He was a man without
guile."</p>
<p>"I don't know about guile, but he certainly had friends all over
Mianpur, and even in the Lake Palace." A pause, and Mr. Deeping
added:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I wish the other man had been like him. That was a bad
business."</p>
<p>"You mean Mr. Seton?" Venetia asked quietly. "Yes; that's a sad
story."</p>
<p>"I haven't heard it. May I hear?"</p>
<p>Sara made a frantic sign to him, which, man-like, he never
noticed.</p>
<p>"Yes. The Russians either forced or beguiled him into betraying
some of our secrets&mdash;something very important, which may alter the
whole turn of events. They say Gifford turned as white as a sheet
when he heard they were boasting that Seton had given the show
away. It may even incline the balance against us. The beautiful
Begam was the bait, they say. Anyhow, he's betrayed his salt,
though no one yet knows what he revealed."</p>
<p>Venetia turned and walked out of the cabin, her throat very
stately and erect. Sara rounded instantly upon the Resident.</p>
<p>"She was engaged to him. Surely even a child could have seen I
was trying to make you stop."</p>
<p>He stared at her, utterly abashed.</p>
<p>"The blithering ass that I am! But why didn't you tell me?" he
cried. "Engaged to that miserable creature! I don't believe it even
now."</p>
<p>"If I know Venetia, she won't be engaged to him long! I wish she
never had seen him. I was very fond of him, I own, but if this is
true, the sooner she forgets him the better."</p>
<p>The Resident was silent, and Sara added mournfully, "The worst
of it is, she doesn't forget. Things go so dreadfully deep with
her."</p>
<p>"She is young," Mr. Deeping said consolingly; "and there's
something in that kind of treachery that turns one a bit sick. It
should revolt any woman. I should rub it in about the Begam, Miss
Grant. I should, indeed. No woman could forgive that, even if she
could pardon the other. I'll let you know all I hear."</p>
<p>And now the night of grief closed down on Venetia. Sara, every
one about her, believed that Seton was a renegade. Human reason
protested it. Faith must borrow eagle wings to soar through and
above the thick atmosphere. For he was utterly lost to sight. There
was no breath, no word or sign of communication&mdash;had been none
since the day their boat left the palace. And though death or
imprisonment might have accounted for his silence in nobler ways,
that could hardly be when their own friends in Mianpur reported
that he had been closeted with Barikoff, had been seen walking
unmolested in the city, and finally riding out, well attended, on
his way to Sellore, whence he had returned, they said, to the Lake
Palace and the company of Shirin Begam.</p>
<p>Such stories grow, and this assumed terrible pro portions. He
had adopted the faith of Islam. He had been seen in native dress as
an officer with the troops. He had enriched himself with the
plunder of the Amir's treasury. And as many Europeans, fleeing
northward, took refuge in Srinagar, the town, both native and
European, was an exchange for the most circumstantial rumours in
the Peninsula. Therefore, though her faith remained a pure and
perfect chrysolite, she suffered infernal agonies, and in ways
people could scarcely be expected to protect. Sara could not
restrain her con tempt for the renegade and felt it almost a duty
to express it, since it might seal his doom with Venetia&mdash;if such a
thing as wavering could be imagined. She ventured on the subject
two days after Deeping's comments.</p>
<p>"Venetia, I know how you must suffer in hearing these terrible
things. I can hardly endure it myself, and what must it be for you!
A man we loved and trusted&mdash;"</p>
<p>Venetia, with quiet hands laid in her lap, looked up at her.</p>
<p>"You can never have loved him, Sara, if you believe these
horrors."</p>
<p>"Do you mean that you don't? When Colonel Joyce&mdash;when Mr.
Deeping&mdash;when Captain Leigh, who was almost <i>in</i> Sellore&mdash;all
say&mdash;Oh, Venetia, surely, surely&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I believe not one word of it."</p>
<p>"You accuse them of falsehood? Your own country men&mdash;honourable
men? You must be mad!"</p>
<p>"I know they believe what they have heard. I don't. That is the
difference."</p>
<p>"But they have grounds for their belief. You&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I have stronger grounds for my belief."</p>
<p>"Simply that you loved him! Love is blind, but I never could
have imaged that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Love is the clearest-sighted thing in all the world. Listen,
Sara&mdash;would you believe that I could do a base, lying, cowardly
thing? Would you ever believe that?"</p>
<p>Sara made a feeble gesture with her hands.</p>
<p>"No, no. But then I've known you always. I know you to the bone.
We've only known him a few poor months&mdash;it takes years to
understand a man's character. I know he must have been in frightful
straits. I pity almost as much as blame him. But there it is."</p>
<p>There was silence. Venetia, sitting by the cabin window, looking
out upon the swiftly gliding river, crystal pure from the deep
springs in the mountains, turbid from the long journey through the
soilure of human life, to be purified again in the infinite bosom
of the eternal sea. So illusions fall thick about the soul and
cloud its transparence until, resumed into the Infinite, pure with
the pure, it finds its home at last.</p>
<p>It was impossible to combat Sara's belief, impossible to stem
the torrent of opinion around her. It was therefore useless to
speak. And why blame them? They thought they knew, and though she
herself knew better, her assurance was based on things she could
never make clear to them. So it must be endured, with the same
courage as that with which Seton, somewhere out of sight, was
enduring&mdash;unless, indeed, he were dead. But if he were, then she
believed some sign, some sound from the invisible must have reached
her.</p>
<p>Presently, looking up, she said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Please try to let us go on as if nothing had happened. I can't
speak of this. We'll wait, and I know one day you'll he glad as
little was said as possible. Do this for me, dear."</p>
<p>Something in her face made Sara stoop and kiss her almost
passionately. She never willingly alluded to the subject again, and
shielded where it was possible, though she understood nothing of
Venetia's real mind and thought she understood all, with the
perfect miscomprehension that sometimes falls between people
closely allied in blood and yet at planetary distances of
spirit&mdash;distances that no unwinged love can bridge.</p>
<p>There were agonies to be endured also in ways people could
scarcely be expected to understand. Mr. Deeping would come in with
tales of courage and endurance in the beleaguered cities and lonely
villages. His voice thrilled as he told of men, despairing of help,
fighting to the end, shooting their women when no more could be
done sooner than let them fall into the hands of the enemy, and
then, at the last, turning their guns on themselves. He looked
round eagerly for sympathy, Sara in tears, Venetia cold as stone.
He began to dislike her&mdash;a girl who had no heart for her country's
glories and sorrows. After all, a woman who could love a man like
that beast Seton could have no high sense of what either men or
women should be!</p>
<p>There was one day when he brought the story of a young Indian
officer, a son of the great house of Gondwara, who had lost his
life in a desperate <i>sortie</i>&mdash;an attempt to dynamite the
Saranpore Gate of Sellore&mdash;a tale that rang like a trumpet call
with all its pride and glory of heroism, which for the moment is
failure, and shines like a star for ever and ever in the dimmed
eyes of humanity.</p>
<p>"Of the men," Mr. Deeping read monotonously, "only two escaped,
horribly wounded. The rest&mdash;"</p>
<p>Venetia rose, looking straight before her, and walked out of the
cabin. He stared in amazement after her, laying down his glasses
and speaking not unkindly.</p>
<p>"Miss Grant, can it be possible&mdash;I scarcely like to hint at such
a thing&mdash;but can it be possible that your sister's sympathies are
with the enemy? Such extra ordinary conduct surely&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, can't you see&mdash;can't you understand her? She's half dying
of shame because he failed when others are so glorious. And now,
this young prince&mdash;men of all nations do nobly, only he failed. Mr.
Deeping, you have daughters of your own. Try to pity her a little;
but for God's sake, never show your pity, for I think it would kill
her."</p>
<p>She clasped her hands in despair, looking pleadingly at him. He
shook his head gravely.</p>
<p>"It seems a very incomprehensible state of mind to me. Such a
man is best forgotten. And indeed, my dear Miss Grant, I have
spared her all I could. News reached me yesterday that all
communication has ceased with Mianpur owing to Seton's defection,
and that Colonel Gifford is compelled to risk his precious life
again in going there to complete some necessary link in the
chain."</p>
<p>"But perhaps he is dead. Let us pray that he may be," said Sara
passionately. "You none of you seem to consider that possibility.
He may have killed himself for shame."</p>
<p>"I wish we could think so. No, he was seen riding out of the
Hathi Bagh Gate, with that scoundrel Barikoff bidding him a
friendly farewell, evidently all on the best of terms."</p>
<p>"Has anything more come through?"</p>
<p>"Only that he showed Barikoff's safe-conduct to a party of men,
one of whom was in our interest. That speaks for itself. The rumour
goes that he's working with them now in Sellore. After all, Miss
Grant, horrible as it is, such cases have been known before. Shall
I continue my reading?"</p>
<p>"I think not to-day, please," Sara said faintly.</p>
<p>The thing would have sickened her, even apart from Venetia. As
it was, she trembled at the very thought of Seton. Heroism and
victory, the only things to lift the burden of those anxious days,
were changed into terror for her now. She dreaded lest Venetia
should hear anything, for all was leavened with pain, and to save
her from it was impossible.</p>
<p>But for the time it alienated the sisters. It set a gulf between
them which kind words could not cross.</p>
<p>Venetia withdrew into herself, and what Sara mistook for shame
was a very humanly wounded pride. And because that pride too, was a
lack of understanding, it darkened her own inward light, and she
moved in a dark land of besieging pains and fears, though she never
lost faith in the man she loved. She lost it in much else&mdash;in
Sara's lifelong affection, in the attempted tender ness of friends,
in her own courage. Night after night she shut herself in her
cabin, imploring a word, a sign from the implacable darkness, and
none came. The midnight sky was as iron above her, the stars
followed their cruelly remote, transcendent law, the human love and
sorrow seemed of as little consequence as the cross ing of flies in
the air. She paled and waned under the burden, shut herself away
and endured proudly and repellently, closing all approaches.</p>
<p>It was worse when, a month later, came news so important that
she must meet it wherever she went, since it was a triumph in every
one's mouth. Mianpur had fallen&mdash;Mahmud Mirza was avenged.</p>
<p>"I think, Venetia, you had better go for a row in the
<i>shikara</i> this morning," Sara said, quaking inwardly. "It is
such a lovely day."</p>
<p>"Why should I go?"</p>
<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" Then, desperately: "Mianpur is taken."</p>
<p>"Well, what of that?"</p>
<p>"I can't keep Mr. Deeping away. He has the news."</p>
<p>"Why should you?"</p>
<p>"I don't want you to hear."</p>
<p>"Why shouldn't I hear, like every one else? I don't understand
you. Of course I shall stay!"</p>
<p>There was no more to be said. Mr. Deeping came with his budget,
and Venetia received him coldly and courteously and then sat
looking out of the window, her profile clear against the strong
sunlight.</p>
<p>"The great significance of the fall of Mianpur is not only that
it was the chief stronghold of the enemy, but that it was brought
about by treachery among the Russian leaders. A man, a doctor, they
say, betrayed their plans to our people. It is a confused story,
but it appears Barikoff had some reason for suspecting this man,
and intended to have him shot. The man did a bolt and gave himself
up to Colonel Gifford, and the rest followed. He apparently
suspected that Barikoff him self had already sold the pass! Not
much honour among thieves in Mianpur, you see."</p>
<p>"Then have they got Barikoff?" Sara asked.</p>
<p>"Certainly. And that's the beginning of the end, I suppose, Ibn
ul Farid being dead, he was the backbone of it all."</p>
<p>"And Shirin Begam?"</p>
<p>It was Venetia's voice, very quiet and cold.</p>
<p>"No. Her whereabouts is not known."</p>
<p>Mr. Deeping could never expand with Venetia. She chilled him in
every nerve. Even now, she never turned her head his way.</p>
<p>"But," he went on to Sara, "the Maharaja of Junwar has done
splendidly. It seems they had forced him to hold some nominal
office in their army, and there he kept his eyes open. Barikoff
sent him word from Mianpur that they had heard a man named Rao
Singh was at the back of all the attempts against Mianpur. It
appears that there is no such person, and the Maharaja knew it, but
tumbled to the idea at once, saw it was a blind for them and worked
up a long story with all sorts of embellishments about the
activities of Rao Singh, keeping them so busy on these false trails
that our friends in Mianpur were able to get a good deal done under
cover. I feel certain we shall hear all this invaluable work was
run by Colonel Gifford. He knows Mianpur State like a book. There
are splendid rewards in store for him, and well he deserves them
all!"</p>
<p>"Well, indeed!" cried Sara. "I know Mianpur enough to know what
it means, and it rejoices my heart to think that Mahmud Mirza and
the two queens are avenged. Will they shoot Barikoff?"</p>
<p>"They'll be fools if they don't!" Deeping said grimly. In the
silence that followed, Venetia spoke clearly. "Was any trace found
of Mr. Seton, when Mianpur was taken?"</p>
<p>"None at all. He had been seen leaving it long before."</p>
<p>She said not another word while he remained, and he noticed when
he shook hands with her how coldly handsome she looked. It seemed
as if the whole character of her face was changing. The sparkle,
the life of it were gone. Perhaps for the first time some glimmer
of pity and understanding entered his mind.</p>
<p>"He has fled with the woman," was Sara's thought.</p>
<p>And again the weeks went by, separating her from Venetia with
words and looks almost imperceptible, but dividing as death. They
were never alone together now if they could avoid it, and when they
could not, the frontiers of both were guarded, and no messenger
from either heart could pass with true tidings. There were the
courtesies of combat or an armed neutrality, no more.</p>
<p>It was one day when Sara had gone with a party to the Peri
Mahal, that Venetia was sitting alone in the cabin of the
<i>Dilkushar</i>. She was doing nothing but thinking&mdash;she seldom
did anything else now&mdash;for when she was alone the mask could be
dropped, and she looked what she was&mdash;a woman in bitter
trouble.</p>
<p>And as she sat looking up to the great height of the
Takht-i-Sulieman, wearied as if she had climbed the height on
bleeding feet, the never-opened door opened, and a figure stood
within it, the figure of Jadrup Gosein, lit by a dim light from the
cell behind him.</p>
<p>He looked down upon her with the tenderest sympathy.</p>
<p>"Your feet bleed, my daughter&mdash;your heart also&mdash;yet you have
struggled up this height. That was well done."</p>
<p>She looked up exhausted, and put out one hand faintly towards
him. He came down the steps and bent over her.</p>
<p>"You must have shelter from the rain. Follow me into the
temple."</p>
<p>She rose and stood bewildered.</p>
<p>"It is not allowed. That door is shut."</p>
<p>"The door stands open. What temple door was ever closed to need?
Follow me, my daughter."</p>
<p>He turned and went slowly up the steps, and, trembling before
the terror of some imminent revelation, she followed.</p>
<p>In the little gray cell the air was warm and still as in the
heart of a bird's nest. There was a sense of brooding wings, of
peace and protection. A small altar with flowers and holy vessels
and the symbol of the god&mdash;no more&mdash;and Jadrup Gosein standing
beside it. The sound of the rain outside falling gently,
incessantly, resembled the sands of time dropping into the abyss of
Eternity.</p>
<p>Presently, in a voice that seemed a part of the silence, he said
slowly and as if in meditation:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My daughter, why have you forsaken the light?"</p>
<p>"It left me," she answered proudly.</p>
<p>"You know better. When did the light leave what is of its own
essence? Even those who hate it, walk in glory if they would but
open their eyes to see. From the feet of the murderer, the traitor,
are scattered flakes of radiance, though they will not know. And
you&mdash;how have you forgotten?"</p>
<p>Arraigned before a justice indisputable, she could only
stammer:&mdash;</p>
<p>"They disbelieved what I knew, they distrusted, despised what is
better than they. How could I forgive it?"</p>
<p>"And because you were wiser, and therefore, happier than they,
you withdrew yourself and your love from them and shut yourself
into the darkness? Daughter of the Highest, you fell far."</p>
<p>She trembled. There was a silence of infinite healing. The
falling of the rain was full of lovely things; the stirring of
seeds in spring, the mute growth of beauty to blossom in season. It
seemed that her eyes were suddenly opened, and the sealed channels
of her heart thawed in a warmth like spring.</p>
<p>"I fell far," she repeated with sobbing breath, the tears
overflowing her eyes. "Can I climb again, as I have climbed this
hill?"</p>
<p>"It is a steeper way, my daughter. Human relations quiver on so
fine a balance that once disturbed it may take more lives than one
to readjust them. But you can climb&mdash;and hope. There are no wings
for that journey. The wrong done is done, but to know it is to set
one's face to the ascent. And&mdash;the night is far spent. Behold the
dawn."</p>
<p>She saw the cresset on the altar dwindle and pale before the
invading armies of a great light without. He moved slowly to the
door, and with one majestic gesture flung it wide.</p>
<p>Oh, sight of wonder and bliss! The city slept below. From all
its glittering waterways rose a silvery mist, veiling the houses,
little and great, in a concealing beauty. It lay afloat on a sea of
cloud, uplifted to the divinity of the encircling mountains with
their pure pinnacles of snow, a thing more of heaven than earth,
mystic, wonderful.</p>
<p>He stood on the aged, broken steps, looking down upon it, and
she a step below him.</p>
<p>"It is beautiful indeed, my daughter, but more beautiful by far
to him who has eyes to see. Behold!"</p>
<p>And as he spoke, the sun rose above the serrated line of the
eastern mountains and the snows flushed into the glory of a great
dawn. Rose or gold? What human eye could comprehend or tongue
record that immense wave of flowing life and light? The rolling
billows of glory broke upon the mountains and drowned them and the
valley beneath in an ocean of divinest day. The mists, dissolving,
floated down the river like empty garments of departing dark, and
the city, revealed, lay sleeping and beautiful beneath the broad
and generous sunlight of the risen dawn.</p>
<p>She turned, rejoicing, for sympathy. He was gone. The sheltering
door of the temple was closed and only a faint scent of marigolds
and incense was in the air. It drifted from her like a dream, and
she awoke in the little cabin, with the gleaming' river gliding in
netted sunshine by the windows, in a gladness deeper than all the
springs of speech.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<p>Sara's first thought in the change was that Venetia, casting
aside the past and her unworthy lover, had turned her face to life
again with a resolute courage worthy of all honour. She could
understand that mood and commend it, and did so, with a gently
persistent miscomprehension deserving of a worse cause. But Venetia
was impregnable. Content, unaffected, un restrained, spoke in every
look of her bright eyes, every note of her voice. It was Sara now
who, when un deceived, found the matter too painful for discussion.
What was it possible for her to reply when Venetia was so
hopelessly confirmed in a perversity which to her mind brought
disgrace upon them both? She felt it the more because her r&ocirc;le had
always been more that of mother than of sister and Venetia had
deferred to her in trifles without a thought of resistance. It was
hard to shut her heart against the lovingness which was the dearest
thing in her life, but she achieved it outwardly, hoping, as so
many hope, that harshness might be the sharp-toothed hound to drive
the sheep back to the fold. It might have done, though it seldom
succeeds, but that the sheep was shielded in another fold, where
the pastures were free and the living water stilled to reflect the
shining of a diviner light.</p>
<p>She needed the safeguard, for, as the news of her persistent
loyalty spread, it gained her the reputation of disloyalty to the
common cause. A woman who still considered herself engaged to a
traitor, condoning, excusing the horrors of which he had been
guilty&mdash;what was there to be said for her? That was a crime that
even men could apprehend and condemn in a young and attractive
woman, and, in spite of courageous efforts, she was at last forced
to see they would have none of her.</p>
<p>She caught Sara alone one day and offered to go on a camping
expedition by herself in the mountains.</p>
<p>"I think I need a change," she said wistfully, "and it would be
much, much easier for you, Sara. Every day I see how hard it is,
and how bravely you bear it. Let me go."</p>
<p>Sara burst into tears. It was very unlike her, but she was
frayed, irritated, wearied at every turn, for every arrival of news
brought the same miserable friction, and the pity she received on
all hands fostered her belief in her own rectitude and
certainties.</p>
<p>"Oh, Venetia," she sobbed, "can't you change? Can't you give it
up? It puts us in such a frightful position. It is like having to
do with Germans during the war. It stamps you&mdash;ruins you."</p>
<p>A long silence. At last</p>
<p>"Sara&mdash;let me go. You can't understand, nor I explain. If I
could love a man capable of what you believe, I should be all you
think. But I don't. Let me go. It's the only way. You and I have
loved each other so many years, and this is hurting it. It's too
precious to be hurt. You'll think of me more kindly when I'm
away."</p>
<p>Sara wept and protested and wasted herself in en treaties, but
in her heart she knew it was best. They had come to the parting of
the ways&mdash;they would meet again, but not now. So a little houseboat
was chosen, and the faithful ayah, Jamala, who had rejoined them in
Kashmir, with the man who had served them from Venetia's birth,
elected to follow her fortunes. They loved Sara, but Venetia they
adored, and, since the story of Scion Sahib had percolated through
the bazaars, they also knew it and were prepared to die in defence
of his honour. What!&mdash;the Presence&mdash;the Sahib, he join with defiled
beef-eating Moslems? They knew better! And their belief was a
little earthly light among the great stars that lit her way.</p>
<p>The <i>Roshanara</i> had dropped down to Gunderbal and lay there
at rest in solitude, for the concentration of news at Srinagar made
a great concourse of Europeans there. It was at Gunderbal, among
the trees, under the shadow of the mighty hills, that Venetia first
tasted the healing of outward peace. She rode, attended by one
silent syce, she walked, while he followed at her heels, dutifully
within reach of call, no more. She read in the quiet evenings in
the lonely cabin, or lost herself in thoughts more sweet&mdash;and she
knew that daily her inner self strengthened and grew. Sara wrote
tenderly and expressed no wish for her return, and never made the
faintest allusion to news from India. It was a time of great
peace&mdash;a time like autumn, when the earth, laying aside her
loveliness petal by petal, leaf by leaf, prepares herself for the
tranquil sleep of winter, the hope of spring in her bosom. She had
begun to believe that Seton was dead on the field of honour. That
might well be, and if so, she knew what her course would be.
India&mdash;and the work for which her meditations had fitted her.</p>
<p>So she sat one evening by the window, watching the evening star
trembling in the water outside, broken in the gentle swaying of
tall reeds. A night bird cried in the shadows. Softly from the
distance came the splash of approaching paddles&mdash;the leaf-shaped
paddles of Kashmir. A light shikara was gliding up the
waterway.</p>
<p>She rose and began to arrange her books and writing for the
night. There was the soft plash of oars outside, and a voice that
spoke to Ramdas. No&mdash;no, it could not be! She started up, with one
hand instinctively to her heart, pale with joy&mdash;the other leaning
on the table gripping the paper she had tried to read, and
waited&mdash;waited!</p>
<p>"The Miss Sahib is here?" the voice said, and steps came along
the little passage.</p>
<p>He came in.</p>
<p>His arms were stretched out, he made a wild step towards her,
his face all broken up into light and hope and quivering joy.</p>
<p>"Venetia! Darling! The tree!&mdash;I've got through at last!"</p>
<p>She sprang forward, radiant, rejoicing, and even as she touched
him, he collapsed, staggering against a chair and slipping down to
the floor. In her utter joy she had not seen how worn, how ill he
looked, with a great seamed scar that crossed his forehead, his
clothes worn and almost in rags, a pitiable figure. It was he&mdash;that
was enough. Then, suddenly, she saw, and as when a freshet tears
through the barrier of ice in spring and grinds it to fragments and
sweeps it wildly away, terror and pity burst up in her heart. She
threw herself on the miserable heap that lay there, the mere wreck
of a man, and the tears rushed from her eyes in torrents as she
clasped her arms about him.</p>
<p>"I love you, I would die for you! I care only for that. We'll go
away together from all their cruelty and forget it all. Oh, look up
and love me, my dear, my very dear! You are well&mdash;you're only
tired, exhausted, and no wonder. Oh, look up&mdash;look up! I'm with
you, my own dear heart."</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Is it needful to write the end of the story? Love is enough. But
there are things that must be understood. He had gone through so
much.</p>
<p>The boat was hurried back to Srinagar with a doctor on board,
summoned in haste, but life ebbed very low, and for many days it
seemed that the tide surging from the boundless ocean was drawing
back to it once more in the peace of a deep unconsciousness.
Gifford had arrived in Srinagar by the Pir Panjal route the day
after Seton came in by Baramula, and he was charged with news which
dissipated the flying rumours once and for all. At last the whole
gallant story could be told, while the hero of it lay in the dark
no man's land between life and death, unknowing even that Venetia
was with him, forgetting all alike in the silence of the great
Presences who make clear the way for the Lords of Life and
Death.</p>
<p>Gifford told the story first to Venetia, rising on a wind of
wrath and scorn as he told it, scorn of the men and women who had
been willing to believe the worst of a man who had no voice with
which to defend himself. She listened in a deep delight, the joy of
faith lost in sight, of hope exalted into victory. It was known and
told, partly from Barikoff's revelations before they shot him,
partly from the reports of the faithful few in Mianpur, who knew
the whole story as they knew everything that went on in the palace.
But there was more. Of the little group led by Gulbadan's cousin,
the young Prince of Gondwara&mdash;those who had tried to dynamite the
Sellore Gate&mdash;Seton was one. He and another were the only
survivors, and the scar across his forehead would be the witness of
it while he lived.</p>
<p>"We owe Mianpur entirely to him," Gifford said in his quiet way.
"His dealing with Barikoff was an inspiration, for, once the
Russian leaders suspected treachery among themselves, the game was
up. I should never have thought of that. And then his work at
Sellore&mdash;not to mention the blowing up of the gate with that
splendid young Gondwara! Nothing's good enough for Seton. I bless
the day we met at Mianpur. Not only that, but his dealings with the
Maharaja of Junwar and the whole counter-plot were masterly. I can
carry a web of intrigue through as well as most men. I can't see
ahead and plan like that. And he did it alone&mdash;alone, without one
of us to help him, his life in his hand night and day for
months."</p>
<p>His audience, when he spread this abroad, had the grace to be
ashamed. The usual excuses were made:&mdash;</p>
<p>"After all, what could we think? It was as circumstantial as
could be. We even heard you had corroborated it...'</p>
<p>"I may be a fool, but not such a fool as that," Gifford said
coolly. "No, gentlemen, you made a bad break in Seton's business.
Have the grace to admit it. And moreover, he heard it all as he
came up country. If he dies&mdash;"</p>
<p>They turned away silent.</p>
<p>There were moments when Sara felt she could never forgive
herself, but Venetia would hear no word of forgiveness.</p>
<p>"We love each other. We always did. Forget it, Sara. I am so
happy, that it's all lost in sunshine, whether he lives or
dies."</p>
<p>"If he dies, I shall never have the courage to see you again,"
Sara said, sobbing.</p>
<p>"And break my heart? Oh, Sara, no. I should want you more than
ever then. Kiss me&mdash;I can't do without you for one second. Come now
and help me. Come."</p>
<p>But how could Seton die with such love about him? Sara fought
for his life, if possible, more passionately then Venetia, and,
fighting together night and day, they won their victory.</p>
<p>One day, when he was lying languidly on deck in the shade of a
big canvas, Venetia sitting where a stray sun beam touched the
bronze of her hair to gold, Gifford came up the steps. They had
been married a week before, by the English chaplain at Srinagar&mdash;a
dawn of new life and hope, though both bore tragic traces of
suffering still. Gifford looked up at them kindly as he pulled up
the chair he always sat in.</p>
<p>"You're pounds better to-day. It won't be long before you're off
to the mountains for your honeymoon, you two. Mrs. Seton, I shall
take you for a pull presently&mdash;you never leave him."</p>
<p>"I don't want to," she said, her lip trembling.</p>
<p>"But you must. Now, wait a minute and then get your hat. I've a
bit of news."</p>
<p>"Good or bad?" she asked with instinctive terror.</p>
<p>"Good. Listen, Seton. Shirin Begam is dead."</p>
<p>He started up half sitting and fell back again.</p>
<p>"Yes. It appears she had been hidden in a house in Mianpur, a
house belonging to that old villain, Srinavastri. His women gave
her shelter. Rumours got about, however, and our people searched
the place. She must have got wind of it, for when they entered the
room, she was sitting in a great chair, stone dead. It is said she
had poisoned herself. Now, it's a curious thing&mdash;of course, you
remember the prophecy?&mdash;that it should be just four years since she
first appeared in Russia and began her mischiefs."</p>
<p>"Do you think," Venetia asked earnestly, "that there was any
truth in that theory of reincarnation, or was it all fraud? Did she
believe it all herself, or were they more than they knew?"</p>
<p>The Colonel shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"Who knows the secrets of the Lords of Life and Death? The
Orient believes such things with un questioning faith, and what is
our knowledge compared with theirs? If she and her brother used it
as fraud, even believed it all their own fabrication, still it may
have been true. There are truths beyond what we ourselves know, and
they make us their puppets. But if it was all a fake, she knew the
game was played out; and if she had any belief in herself, she knew
from the prophecy that four years were her allotted span, and that
was out too. The truth is probably quite independent of what they
believed, and it is utterly beyond our ken. I have lived too long
in India to deny the improbable flatly. I simply don't know. What
do you think, Seton?"</p>
<p>"It's beyond me," said Seton.</p>
<p>That was always his answer. True, Revel and she, plotters all
through, might only have seized the prophecy and used it
villainously among a superstitious people for vile ends. They were
capable of that and more. But if the tree falls as it lies, might
not the evil spirits of ancient days come back armed with evil,
even as the prophecy had foretold? There were things he never could
account for, even to himself, incredible, mysterious, to be felt
rather than known, that made him doubt. Life and death&mdash;who knows
their secret cycles? He had learnt to believe that the soul of man
obeys the law of stars, going and returning in a mysterious orbit,
unknown to the wanderer himself until a higher enlightenment is
reached at last. And, therefore, those miserable souls might have
been working out the doom they had themselves imposed on ancient
Egypt, before passing on to the next act of their age-long drama,
and this all unknown to their blindness. Terrible is the law to the
evildoer&mdash;the law of which he is at once the judge and the victim.
But she was so beautiful. Had she loved him a little? Were their
lives still to touch in some dim future? Should he think of her
again as he had thought when he saw her, coldly beautiful and apart
in the tomb, when she stirred his blood into fever? He remembered
the passion of desire that followed his strange illness in the
desert. Dead&mdash;dead. Lying in gray ash. Would this or another life
revive it, or was it dead forever? In dreams he believed he should
see her sitting there again in the thick darkness, waiting&mdash;for
whom? "Thou endest the night." And the night had closed about her
once more&mdash;impenetrable. What was true and what false? Oh, for the
wisdom of Jadrup Gosein to answer the unanswerable!</p>
<p>He closed his eyes wearily. At present oblivion was the greatest
good. Later he could think.</p>
<p>"You'll be glad to see Conway when he turns up. And it's good
news that the Egyptian Government will share your finds with the
British Museum. What with all that, and the coming decoration,
you'll be a bit of a hero, old man! Now, come along with me, Mrs.
Seton."</p>
<p>Venetia lingered a moment. She said with a shiver, as of a
sudden cold</p>
<p>"I think the Arabs are right. I think those old tombs of dead
dreadful things should never be opened. Let the dead bury their
dead."</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The flames subsided. The fire died out in India and left
desolation behind and a sad quiet. The sullen tide of the Russian
armies rolled back, shattered, among the terrible mountain passes,
and the peace of the world was secure for a decade, if no more. Had
they learned their lesson? The question was beyond even the wise
acres of the daily press. It lay on the knees of the gods.</p>
<p>But in the green uplifted quiet of the Himalayan heights, with
the stark and steadfast pines about them, Seton completed the one
lesson of life worth learning. And he owed it to a man of the
ancient Aryan people, who knew not where his next meal would come
from if not from the hand of charity. He had learnt the possibility
of touching hands with the Divine Consciousness which man carries
with him from birth to birth. And whoso has learnt that secret is
invulnerable. All darts fly past him, all swords are blunted.</p>
<p>As he sat one day by the tent opening, his feet deep in moss, a
mountain stream, clear as broken diamonds, running beside him with
its singing message from the heights of snow outsoaring the clouds,
he saw a man making his way up the small winding trail from the
rush ing river&mdash;a man with a cotton dhoti wrapped about him, a thin
coat of cotton to shield his breast from the mountain breezes, his
feet bare&mdash;no poverty could be poorer. But his eyes were aflame
with the joy of the mystic, who, seeing through all illusion,
beholds the hidden heart of peace. He stopped, salaaming before the
Sahib.</p>
<p>"Presence, I bring a word from the Holy One. Is it your pleasure
to hear?"</p>
<p>Seton rose, as to a king's messenger. There was a moment's
silence, filled by the crystal rippling of the stream, while the
man collected himself to speak.</p>
<p>"This is the word of the Holy One to the Presence: 'My son, for
him who has found the real self within him, desire fades away and
temptation is no more temptation, but becomes even as a shadow
effaced by the glory of the noonday sun. And the Wise Ones will aid
him as it is needful, for when the disciple is ready, the Master
appears, and when the next link of the chain is wanted, lo,
suddenly it is at hand. Free is that man who has laid aside
illusion. And in the light of life and death is none other
freedom.'"</p>
<p>The voice ceased, and salaaming humbly, the man turned to
depart. With an effort, Seton delayed him. "You return to the Holy
One?"</p>
<p>"I see him no more. I go on my way to the shrine of the Great
God in the mountains. <i>Hari&mdash;Aum&mdash;Hari</i>!"</p>
<p>He understood, and, moving aside, watched as the steadfast
figure parted the pine boughs and without a look earthward, took
the way to the eternal snows.</p>
