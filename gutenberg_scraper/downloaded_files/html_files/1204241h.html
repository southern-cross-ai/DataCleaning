  <h2><a id="ch01"
     name="ch01">CHAPTER 1.</a><br>
  "Country of origin&mdash;Tibet; home town Lhasa."</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was one of those days when not even Cockneys like London.
  Spring had made a false start. Fog, wind, rain, sleet, and a prevalent stench
  of damp wool. Even the street noises sounded flat and discouraged. Big Ben
  was invisible through the fog from Trafalgar Square, and the lions around
  Nelson's monument with rain streaming from their granite flanks resembled
  mythical ocean monsters. Lights in the windows of Cockspur Street suggested
  warmth, and there was a good smell of hot bread and pastry exuding through
  the doors of tea shops, but that only made the streets feel more
  unpleasant.</p>

  <p>Tom Grayne turned up his overcoat collar, stuck his hands in his pockets,
  and without particular malice cursed the umbrellas of passers-by.</p>

  <p>No one noticed him much. He was fairly big, tolerably well dressed. He was
  obviously in the pink of condition; he walked with the gait of a man who
  knows where he is going, and why, and what he will do when he gets
  there&mdash;the unhurried, slow-looking but devouring stride of a man who has
  walked great distances.</p>

  <p>A policeman with the water streaming from his black cape nodded to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, hello Smithers. Nice day for your job!"</p>

  <p>"H-awful! But we 'as to get used to it."</p>

  <p>"When do they close the Aliens Registration Office at Bow Street?"</p>

  <p>"Five o'clock I <i>think</i>, but you've plenty of time. I didn't know you
  were a foreigner."</p>

  <p>"American, born in London, Smithers. Dual citizenship. Two sets of very
  suspicious officials to convince I'm not a traitor to the human race."</p>

  <p>Tom Grayne grinned, but as a matter of fact he savagely resented the
  indignity of having to report in person and register his address every month.
  He had a right to British citizenship if he should choose to claim it. He
  chose not. As he saw it, he had a right to be and to do what he pleased, and
  to go where he pleased, provided he didn't make a nuisance of himself. He
  detested bureaucracy, hated to ask favors, loathed having to explain himself,
  and liked people who didn't put on artificial lugs.</p>

  <p>He wasn't unreasonable about anything else, so far as he knew, but by the
  time he turned out of the Strand toward Bow Street police station he was
  feeling hostile, and he was glad of it. He wanted to punch somebody. But
  there was nobody to punch except a few poor devils trudging through the rain,
  and a policeman leading along a prisoner. One does not punch policemen
  profitably, and besides, a police man especially in London is what he
  pretends to be, so he doesn't stir antagonism, or shouldn't. But the smug
  stride of that particular one, and the melancholy resignation of his
  prisoner, who trudged beside him un-handcuffed, goaded Tom's already
  pugnacious disposition and aroused his sympathy at the same time. He felt an
  almost irresistible impulse to horn in and be a nuisance.</p>

  <p>Even so, he might have gone about his own business, down in the basement,
  but there was something familiar about the prisoner's appearance that held
  his attention. He hesitated. He didn't recognize the prisoner. He had never
  seen him before; he was positive about that. But he felt the same sort of
  wordless and unreasoned impulse that makes a man choose something unusual for
  dinner. He followed through the main door to the desk, where an alert-looking
  sergeant stood ready to book the new arrival. Tom was just in time to
  overhear the charge. Then he knew instantly that his hunch had been right.
  Memory overflowed.</p>

  <p>"Th&ouml;-pa-ga&mdash;of the Josays Sept of the Kyungpo&mdash;whatever that
  means&mdash;country of origin Tibet&mdash;home town Lhasa."</p>

  <p>"How d'you spell it? Here, give me that warrant. Go on."</p>

  <p>"Last known address&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, all right, that's written here."</p>

  <p>"Charged with noncompliance with the Aliens Registration Act, under
  section&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's on the warrant."</p>

  <p>"Arrested at eighty-eight Oxted Street."</p>

  <p>"Say anything?"</p>

  <p>"Said nothing."</p>

  <p>"All right. Cell eighteen."</p>

  <p>"Bail!" said Tom Grayne, suddenly, as if he were making the high bid at an
  auction.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, sir?"</p>

  <p>Before Tom could answer a man entered who looked much more Mongolian than
  the prisoner. The prisoner might have passed for a New Orleans quarter-breed
  at first glance. He was a good-looking fellow, with a sad face and an air of
  patient resignation. But this other man looked like a devil. His head was
  framed in the hood of a long, black, glistening waterproof. He had brilliant,
  sunken eyes, high cheek-bones and a skin like dirty parchment. He was several
  inches more than six feet tall, and fairly broad in proportion. More like a
  figure of death than a human being. He spoke rapidly to the prisoner, who
  stared sullenly but didn't answer. The desk-sergeant caught one word, thrice
  repeated:</p>

  <p>"Shang-shang? Sounds like Chinese."</p>

  <p>Tom unbuttoned his overcoat in an unconscious gesture. This was something
  he could lend a hand at. He interpreted:</p>

  <p>"Tibetan. Something like a cross between a harpy and a nightmare, with
  eight legs."</p>

  <p>"Is there one in the Zoo?" the sergeant asked.</p>

  <p>"No, nor in Nuttall's Dictionary. A shang-shang is employed by magicians
  in Tibet to terrify people to death and then to hound them into hell after
  death."</p>

  <p>"Never heard of that one," said the sergeant, "although we've some strange
  superstitions in London&mdash;more than you might suppose. We had some
  witches in here a week ago, arrested for alleged practises that 'ud make your
  hair stand on end if you weren't used to horrors&mdash;and bunkum."</p>

  <p>Slowly, in Tibetan, through thin peculiarly mobile lips that seemed to
  enjoy the flavor of the words, and with his face thrust close to Tom
  Grayne's, the man who looked like death spoke:</p>

  <p>"You-who-know-the-meaning-of-a-shang-shang&mdash;if-you-
  do-not-wish-to-add-experience-to-hearsay&mdash;let-alone-that-
  one-who-is-a-stranger-to-you!"</p>

  <p>"Go to hell," Tom answered, in plain English. He added the equivalent in
  the Tibetan language.</p>

  <p>"What's your name, you?" said the sergeant.</p>

  <p>The tall Tibetan produced a soiled card from an inner pocket. The sergeant
  laid it on the desk and speared it with a pencil-point.</p>

  <p>"<i>Doctor</i> Noropa, eh? What kind of doctor? Medicine? Law? Music?
  Philosophy? We'd a man in here the other day who called himself a doctor of
  blackmail. What do you want here? You a friend of the prisoner?"</p>

  <p>Instead of answering, the tall man turned and walked out. The sergeant
  wrote on a slip of paper the name and address that were on the card and
  handed the paper to a man in uniform at a desk behind him.</p>

  <p>"Check that. Have him followed. Step lively.&mdash;And now you,
  sir"&mdash;he stared penetratingly at Tom Grayne&mdash;"I think you mentioned
  bail. Are you a householder?"</p>

  <p>"No. Is there any charge against the prisoner besides not having
  registered as an alien?"</p>

  <p>"No, not at present. But that one's serious. He's liable to imprisonment
  and subsequent deportation. If you're not a householder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Phone," said Tom Grayne. He went to the coin-in-the-slot machine, in the
  booth in the corner. The prisoner laid the contents of his pockets on the
  desk; he had been marched off to a cell before Tom was out of the booth.</p>

  <p>"Sergeant, I have phoned to Professor Mayor at an address in Bloomsbury.
  He will be here with a solicitor's clerk as fast as a taxi can bring
  him."</p>

  <p>"Professor Mayor, eh?" The sergeant's manner changed perceptibly. "Of
  Bloomsbury? Not Clarence Mayor? The Home Office Expert?"</p>

  <p>"British Museum&mdash;specialist on Tibetan manuscripts and works of
  art."</p>

  <p>"That's the man. The Home Office calls him in on special cases. Does he
  know the prisoner?"</p>

  <p>"I think not. But he is as interested as I am."</p>

  <p>"What makes you so interested, if I may ask?"</p>

  <p>"Tibet is my subject."</p>

  <p>"Ever been there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Oh."</p>

  <p>Tom Grayne went outside, and below to the basement. He reported no change
  of address. There was no one else in the office. The uniformed clerk behind
  the long counter was civil and inclined to make conversation:</p>

  <p>"With all the hotels and boarding-houses there are in London, I can't help
  wondering why you stay at that ad dress, sir. Not that it's any concern of
  mine. I'm merely curious."</p>

  <p>"I don't mind telling you," said Tom Grayne. "It's inexpensive and I can
  live there as I please. I live hard, so as to keep fit. There are no luxuries
  in the country I hope to re visit before long, and the climate might easily
  kill a man who'd lived soft. I even practise not eating for days at a
  time."</p>

  <p>"Some folk," said the clerk, "starve 'emselves just to annoy the police.
  We'd one man in the cells who wouldn't eat because, he said, he was a
  high-caste Hindu, but he turned out to be a Scotch bigamist."</p>

  <p>Tom returned to the upstairs office and waited for Mayor, who came in
  presently wiping rain from gold-rimmed spectacles and followed by a
  stoop-shouldered lawyer's clerk in a bowler hat, who went straight to the
  desk.</p>

  <p>"Silly fellow!" said Mayor, wiping his pinkish, boyish-looking old cheeks
  with a big silk handkerchief. "Befriending shang-shang victims? What next?
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga, you say his name is? Wasn't he at Oxford?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I thought you'd be interested."</p>

  <p>"If I weren't, I shouldn't have left a comfortable fireside, tea, buttered
  toast and a book."</p>

  <p>"Come and have supper at my place and we'll find out why this fellow was
  in hiding."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens! Your place? You live in a fish-shed, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite. I can make you comfortable. Good grub. I have a notion it
  might be dangerous to take him to your house."</p>

  <p>"Dampness&mdash;fog&mdash;rats! Tom Grayne, I haven't your fortitude.
  However, perhaps it's wiser. Very well. I'll risk my health and my opinion of
  you."</p>

  <p>The formalities of bailing out the prisoner took time. Mayor was at the
  desk for several minutes. After that, he went into the phone booth, talked
  for a long time and emerged chuckling as if he had played a good joke.</p>

  <p>"Can you accommodate four, Tom? I've invited O'Mally."</p>

  <p>"Who is O'Mally?"</p>

  <p>"Horace Farquarson O'Mally of Harley Street, you ignoramus. Consulting
  physician to half the crowned heads and multimillionaires in the world."</p>

  <p>"Okay. What's he good at?"</p>

  <p>"He likes Chateau Yquem. You'll have to stop and get some at a place I'll
  show you. He can smell a vintage from a mile off."</p>

  <p>Th&ouml;-pa-ga was under bail by the time O'Mally arrived, very fashionably
  dressed. Top hat, spats, a monocle. He looked as tough as a prize-fighter,
  with Chesterfieldian manners.</p>

  <p>"Came away in the middle of an operation, I suppose?" said Mayor. "Or did
  you leave another death-bed?"</p>

  <p>"Who told you my patients ever die?" O'Mally answered, in a voice like a
  disciplined thunder-storm. "Is this the man?" He refixed his monocle, stared
  at Th&ouml;-pa-ga for about two electric seconds, and then faced Tom Grayne.</p>

  <p>"Our host," said Mayor.</p>

  <p>"I have heard of you," said O'Mally. "How do you do?" He shook hands.</p>

  <p>"Don't you tell him how you are," said Mayor. "Let him find out. He will
  cut you open if you let him."</p>

  <p>No one spoke to Th&ouml;-pa-ga; he stood looking orientally calm, incurious,
  melancholy. The solicitor's clerk snapped his little handbag shut and
  vanished into the rain.</p>

  <p>"My car is waiting," said O'Mally.</p>

  <p>Mayor laughed: "I once rode in a royal wheelbarrow. I knew a gardener at
  Windsor Castle when I was a small boy. I know how to behave. My feet are wet;
  will they ruin the carpet?"</p>

  <p>O'Mally and Mayor raised their hats to the Law, or the desk, or the King
  or somebody&mdash;perhaps to the sergeant; he looked pleased. Tom Grayne
  thrust his arm through Th&ouml;-pa-ga's and followed, into a Rolls Royce limousine
  that bore an almost microscopical coat of arms on the door panel.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch02"
     name="ch02">CHAPTER 2.</a><br>
  <br>
  "Th&ouml;-Pa-Ga is Time-Is-Come."</h2>

  <p class="first">ALL London was streaming homeward for the night. The
  limousine with its oddly assorted passengers sped along streets that were
  rivers of liquid fire, with the traffic incredibly borne on the surface. They
  stopped for several minutes at a wine shop favorably known to Mayor, whence
  Tom Grayne emerged with a brown paper parcel. Thence they headed for Kew and
  the River, where Tom gave intricate directions to the chauffeur, and at last
  they had to leave the limousine to thread their way on foot, in almost
  darkness, through pools of slush, beneath dripping eaves. O'Mally didn't seem
  to mind that his top hat was being ruined, but Mayor was plaintive; he had to
  be lent a hand along the slippery and rather rotten planking of a wharf. But
  at the end of the wharf was shelter.</p>

  <p>Tom unlocked the door of what looked in the dark like a fish- or net-shed.
  But when he lighted a couple of oil lamps the place was cosy enough. There
  was a big stove; he had that going in a minute. There was everything a man of
  Tom Grayne's disposition needed, and nothing he didn't need. Bunks,
  cooking-pots, shelves of books, a sink, two tables, a few chairs, two big
  lockers.</p>

  <p>"Umn! No woman, eh," O'Mally remarked.</p>

  <p>"Good job, too," said Mayor. "Can you imagine the kind of woman Grayne
  would select?"</p>

  <p>"He would choose an actress," said O'Mally. "Each of them would try to
  make the other famous and there'd be the usual divorce. Or am I in poor form
  this evening?"</p>

  <p>"Some one died on you?" Mayor asked.</p>

  <p>"This place," said Tom, "was rented by a retired sea captain, who fixed it
  up to suit himself. But some one thought he had money and murdered him. He
  died on that bunk with his throat cut, and I read about it in the
  paper&mdash;front-page illustration with an X to mark the spot, and so
  on&mdash;three-day mystery. I came to look and found the landlord sure he'd
  never get another tenant because people are afraid of ghosts. So I rented it
  cheap."</p>

  <p>"And the ghosts?" asked Mayor.</p>

  <p>Th&ouml;-pa-ga shuddered. Tom was already cooking supper. Coffee was on. A pot
  of stew was simmering and beginning to smell delicious. Tom laid the table.
  Mayor opened the paper package.</p>

  <p>"I told you Chateau Yquem!"</p>

  <p>"I liked the shape of those bottles better. It's Berncasteler Doktor '21.
  Help yourself."</p>

  <p>O'Mally took the corkscrew from its nail on the wall and pulled a cork
  expertly. He shook down his clinical thermometer and inserted it in the neck
  of the bottle.</p>

  <p>"Good enough," he remarked after a minute. "I am now in no hurry."</p>

  <p>"No more patients?" Mayor asked. "Have they all found you out?"</p>

  <p>"I am on vacation&mdash;first in nearly four years. I catch the eight
  o'clock boat train for Harwich to-morrow evening. Going to Moscow. A man of
  whom I'm jealous has cut off a dog's head and kept it alive for three days,
  during which it eats and reacts to sight and sound. That interests me.
  Where's a wine glass? These they?" He produced cut glasses from an old sea
  captain's wine chest. "Are they clean?"</p>

  <p>"Boiled."</p>

  <p>"What's that delicious smell?" asked Mayor.</p>

  <p>"Lobster mulligan. Or do you mean the toasted barley? I eat barley. So, I
  think, will our friend."</p>

  <p>Mayor was pulling off his boots and socks. Th&ouml;-pa-ga was doing nothing,
  saying nothing, seated on one of the bunks with the palms of his hands on the
  edge, as if he expected to have to jump up at a second's notice.</p>

  <p>"May I have that dish-pan nearly full of hot water, and then some
  mustard," said Mayor. "Unlike O'Mally, I'm important. Serious things might
  happen if I were to catch a bad cold."</p>

  <p>O'Mally filled a wine glass. "Yes," he said, "if you should die, and this
  mysterious gentleman from Tibet should take it into his head to disappear,
  they would confiscate the house you have pledged as security." He walked over
  to the Tibetan. "Drink this."</p>

  <p>Th&ouml;-pa-ga shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Abstainer? Never mind. It's medicine. Drink it"</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose is wrong with him?" Tom Grayne asked, stirring the
  mulligan.</p>

  <p>"I know," O'Mally answered. "It requires no thought whatever. Come along,
  young fellow&mdash;you understand English, don't you? Drink this."</p>

  <p>The Tibetan hesitated, smiled wistfully and then suddenly obeyed. He
  swallowed the wine at a gulp. The wind howled under the eaves and he
  shuddered either at that or at the feel of the wine as it went down. O'Mally
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"My professional advice would be: return as soon as possible to Tibet." He
  was watching Th&ouml;-pa-ga's eyes. "He will talk presently. He has been wanting
  to talk all the way from Bow Street. He has been thoroughly frightened, and
  he is suffering from&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Words of one syllable, please!" said Mayor. "I can use
  twenty-one-syllable Sanskrit words, but mine mean something." Mayor was
  sloshing his feet in the dish-pan and the steam from the hot
  mustard-and-water had dimmed his spectacles. He wiped them, to watch
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga.</p>

  <p>"He is suffering from being too near sea level," said O'Mally. "If he
  really is from Tibet, he is used to a minimum altitude of twelve or fourteen
  thousand feet. It is as if he had taken to deep-sea diving without the proper
  physique and training. Barometric pressure for prolonged periods, plus a
  constitutional lack of resistance to micro-organisms that don't exist at high
  altitudes, produce a mental and physical change. But those are a vicious
  circle; one produces the other. He will die if he doesn't return to
  Tibet."</p>

  <p>"I would rather die," Th&ouml;-pa-ga said suddenly, in good English. The wind
  howled. They all shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Damn our English climate!" Mayor exclaimed. "They say it's worse in
  Tibet, but I don't believe it!" It wasn't the wind that had made him shudder.
  He knew that.</p>

  <p>Tom Grayne struck the stew-pot with an iron spoon:</p>

  <p>"Yesterday's mulligan, warmed up&mdash;canned soup added&mdash;homemade
  barley bread baked by a Stornoway fisherman's widow, New Zealand butter,
  American cheese, celery and white wine. Come and get it."</p>

  <p>They drew up chairs to the table. Th&ouml;-pa-ga elected to eat mulligan. Tom
  Grayne munched barley alone.</p>

  <p>"Wise enough, if you vary your diet now and then. But it's hell to be
  wise," said O'Mally. "Are you in training?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, for Tibet. The important thing is not to eat too often. Discipline
  your belly."</p>

  <p>"Don't forget the sugar. When do you go to Tibet?"</p>

  <p>There was no time to answer. There came a peremptory knock at the door. It
  sounded authoritative, like a police man's, only there was a suggestion of
  deliberate rhythm, as if it might be a prearranged signal. A weird howl of
  wind drove squalling rain against the side of the hut. Beneath, the river
  sucked and splashed amid wharf-piles. Th&ouml;-pa-ga froze motionless.</p>

  <p>"Now I understand why I came," O'Mally remarked. He poured wine for
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga. "This is very interesting."</p>

  <p>Tom Grayne went to the door and opened a peephole. He could see nothing;
  it was all dark outside.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>No answer. No sound outside except wind and splash.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps your chauffeur?"</p>

  <p>"No," said O'Mally, "I sent him home. Can you open the door without
  cooling the stew?"</p>

  <p>Mayor pulled a blanket from the bunk behind him and wrapped it around his
  knees. Tom Grayne tried to open the door only a few inches, against the wind.
  A hand seized it&mdash;wrenched it suddenly. A man crashed into him,
  thrusting him backward on his heels. The door slammed. It was Dr. Noropa, in
  his dripping black waterproof. He turned calmly and bolted the door.</p>

  <p>"Give me some more of that excellent stew before he murders us," said
  Mayor.</p>

  <p>O'Mally snorted: "Don't talk nonsense. Grayne can lick him. I can help, if
  necessary."</p>

  <p>Th&ouml;-pa-ga neither moved nor seemed to breathe; he stared straight in front
  of him. He looked guilty of something and ready for death. There was silence
  for probably sixty seconds. Then, from the midst of a circle of rain from his
  dripping waterproof, the gaunt Noropa spoke:</p>

  <p>"I come to tell you Th&ouml;-pa-ga is time-is-come. If you know what is
  shang-shang, you will let him alone. Th&ouml;-pa-ga must go home."</p>

  <p>"Well, he should," said O'Mally. "But who are you?"</p>

  <p>"I know who you are," Noropa answered. He looked at Mayor. "And I know who
  you are." Then, at last he met Tom Grayne's eyes. "You, who should know
  better, having been in Tibet, do you wish a shang-shang sending?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I never saw one. Send the thing by parcel post. Get out of
  here."</p>

  <p>Noropa's death-like face betrayed no emotion. Tom Grayne slid the bolt and
  Noropa walked out, forcing the door open against the wind with such
  prodigious strength that he seemed hardly to have to exert himself.</p>

  <p>The door slammed. Then suddenly Th&ouml;-pa-ga gulped wine and shook off
  silence. He seemed unconscious of O'Mally's professional critical gaze. His
  left hand rested on the table, but he seemed not even aware that O'Mally's
  fingers touched his wrist. He spoke, if to any one at all, to Mayor:</p>

  <p>"You, who are kind to a stranger, you don't know. Me they will not kill.
  Because me they need for purposes. But you they will make away with by
  magical means. That is to say, if you befriend me. It is therefore not seemly
  for me to have friends, because I get them into trouble."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come now, come," said Mayor. "The police at Bow Street showed me your
  record. You're an Oxford graduate. You surely don't believe in magic."</p>

  <p>"You mean, <i>you</i> don't," said O'Mally. "Early environment, early
  associations, ill health, worry, nostalgia, <i>and</i>
  persecution&mdash;don't overlook that&mdash;readily produce receptivity to
  hypnotic suggestion. Those are words of one syllable, more or less. They're
  all in the dictionary. Have you caught cold?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mayor.</p>

  <p>"That was magic. Before you were put into knickerbockers, your mother or
  your maiden aunt or your nurse told you a hot mustard foot-bath would prevent
  colds in the head. It won't, of course. But it did, didn't it? Don't
  interrupt him&mdash;go on talking, Th&ouml;-pa-ga. Who are you? Why are you in
  London?"</p>

  <p>"I am of a sub-sept of the Josays Sept of the Kyungpo. It is a secret
  sub-sept, and my father, who was a nobleman, was Keeper of the Thunder Dragon
  Gate, of which you have never heard."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, indeed we've heard of it," said Mayor. "Tom Grayne knows as well
  as you or I do, it's a figure of speech. It means a state of consciousness,
  through which the Arhants* have to pass on the Road to Enlightenment. It is
  referred to in the New Testament as the Eye of a Needle."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Arhant, arhat</i> (Sanskrit: enlightened one)
  &mdash;a Bhuddist who has realized certain high stages of attainment. The
  implications of the term vary based on the respective schools and traditions.
  ]</p>

  <p>"That," said Th&ouml;-pa-ga, "is what you may have read in books, or what you
  have deduced. But what I know is other wise, and so I warn you. When my
  father had died and my mother was made to go into a nunnery, I wished never
  to become the Keeper of the Thunder Dragon Gate, although they said I had
  inherited my father's spirit and his duty also. There was an Englishman who
  came to Lhasa, a very kind man who represented the Indian Government. I ran
  away and asked that Englishman to give me work to do. He begged my freedom
  from the Dalai Lama. There was money. It was simple. I was sent to Oxford for
  an education, and I have it. But before I reached Oxford, he who had done me
  that great kindness was already dead&mdash;they said, of poison. And at
  Oxford there began to be a very soon beginning of a shang-shang sending not
  at all a mystery to me."</p>

  <p>The blinded window-pane above the back of Mayor's head smashed
  suddenly&mdash;three distinct crashes of splintering glass. The wine bottle
  broke into a dozen pieces. The mulligan stew-pot fell off the stove to the
  floor. O'Mally stared at his top hat, on a nail on the wall. There was a hole
  through it.</p>

  <p>"This is London, England," O'Mally remarked. "Or am I dreaming?"</p>

  <p>Tom Grayne took a flash-light from the locker, leaned his weight against
  the wind-blown door and walked out.</p>

  <p>"They will not kill me," said Th&ouml;-pa-ga, "because they need me for a
  purpose. But they will kill you&mdash;each of you and every one."</p>

  <p>"Who are 'they'?" asked Mayor.</p>

  <p>O'Mally reached for his top hat. "Exactly! Who are they? Does a
  shang-shang spit a soft-nose Webley bullet? Go on&mdash;don't interrupt him,
  Mayor&mdash;tell us. I wish now I weren't going to Russia."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch03"
     name="ch03">CHAPTER 3.</a><br>
  "Say it, then, behind his back, to Ambleby!"</h2>

  <p class="first">A POLICE whistle&mdash;three shrill blasts. In rain and
  darkness there is no other sound like that. O'Mally straightened his tie. The
  whistle shrilled again. Tom Grayne wrenched the door open and came in,
  dripping.</p>

  <p>"Cops!" he said abruptly.</p>

  <p>He had hardly said it when the door thundered to a man's fist. He
  uncovered the peephole&mdash;peered through.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's the Law. Shall I let 'em in?"</p>

  <p>In response to O'Mally's nod he leaned his weight against the door. A
  policeman's flash-light&mdash;foot&mdash;knee&mdash;shoulder&mdash;face
  beneath an oilcloth-covered helmet&mdash;an official voice:</p>

  <p>"What's going on in here? There's a broken window&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come in&mdash;for God's sake, come in and let's shut the door!"</p>

  <p>Two policemen entered, oilskinned, bulky, suspicious, cautious because
  they had no warrant.</p>

  <p>"Anybody hurt? A fight? Any firearms in here?"</p>

  <p>O'Mally answered: "No."</p>

  <p>"May I have your names, please&mdash;<i>and</i> addresses."</p>

  <p>O'Mally produced his card. He showed the flap of his wallet, then his new
  passport.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Sir 'Grace. And these others?"</p>

  <p>"Dr. Mayor of the British Museum and the Home Office. Mr. Tom Grayne,
  American. Mr. Th&ouml;-pa-ga, from Tibet."</p>

  <p>"Ah! How long has <i>he</i> been in here?"</p>

  <p>O'Mally gave a telegraphically terse synopsis of what had happened. He
  described Noropa.</p>

  <p>The policeman produced his note-book. "I was asked in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tom interrupted him: "Yes, I invited you in. Take a seat at the table;
  you'll write easier."</p>

  <p>He poured them coffee. One policeman stood, sipping noisily. He didn't
  like American coffee, but he was polite about it. The other sat, reading
  aloud what he wrote:</p>

  <p>"Nine-eighteen P.M. A man was seen and heard to fire three shots with a
  revolver in the direction of this shed&mdash;occupied by&mdash;broken
  window&mdash;broken wine bottle, upset cook-pot&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>And</i> a top hat ruined," said O'Mally.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;hole in a top hat. Does any of you gentlemen know how it happened,
  or why? Bearing in mind, please, that any thing you say may be taken down and
  used in evidence against you."</p>

  <p>Tom Grayne told the whole story. The policeman wrote down the details of
  Tom's passport.</p>

  <p>"And now what next?" O'Mally asked. "You were tipped off by Bow Street to
  follow Noropa, and he followed my car. Am I right, constable?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't know, sir. I'm what is known as acting on information
  received. I've no warrant, but I could get one. I heard three shots, saw one
  of them, and flashed my light on a tall man in a hooded black waterproof. I
  saw him throw his revolver into the river. There were other witnesses besides
  me. I believe it would be best for all concerned if his here Mister Th&ouml;-pa-ga
  (two dots, you said, over the 0) would come with me to the police
  station&mdash;I mean, if he'd come willing&mdash;and be locked up for the
  night, where he'd be safe and warm and comfortable, and we could make
  enquiries in the morning."</p>

  <p>Th&ouml;-pa-ga reached for his overcoat.</p>

  <p>"Damn!" remarked O'Mally. "We were just getting his story. Professor Mayor
  went bail for him. Ask the Professor."</p>

  <p>Mayor glanced at Th&ouml;-pa-ga. The Tibetan nodded; he had already buttoned
  his overcoat up to his ears.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand my legal position," said Mayor. "You must do as you
  see fit, constable."</p>

  <p>"He seems willing to come with me, sir."</p>

  <p>"I'll go with the policeman and Th&ouml;-pa-ga," said Tom Grayne. "There's
  plenty more wine. You two make yourselves at home until I come back."</p>

  <p>Mayor nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said O'Mally. "Are they pursuing Noropa?"</p>

  <p>"Begging your pardon, sir," the constable answered, "the man wasn't
  identified. He slipped away into the shadows, but I daresay he won't go far
  before they catch him. If it should happen his name's Noropa he'd have more
  than a bit to explain. There's a watch being kept on this place; you'll be
  safe here until daylight. Or I could phone for your car, Sir 'Orace."</p>

  <p>"No thanks."</p>

  <p>"As you say, sir."</p>

  <p>It was a long way to the police station. Tom Grayne trudged through the
  storm in silence beside Th&ouml;-pa-ga, who kept stride with the policeman. There
  was no sense in trying to talk to Th&ouml;-pa-ga, who seemed more gloomy than
  ever&mdash;an unusual state of mind for a Tibetan; Tibetans usually laugh at
  anything. Tom felt baffled. He had already begun to count on this accidental
  meeting as just the very stroke of luck he had been hoping for for months.
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga might&mdash;anything is possible&mdash;might help him to reenter
  Tibet. If not, he might have connections in Tibet who would honor an
  introduction. No plan yet, of course, but a strong hunch. Busted hunches are
  more disappointing than broken promises: one expects results from a hunch.
  This was the wrong kind of result.</p>

  <p>At the police station, what with sending out a messenger to find a
  cigarette slot-machine, and then telling the long tale all over again for the
  benefit of the sergeant on night duty, nearly two hours went by. There was no
  sense in making a mystery for the police; the obvious thing to do was to keep
  them friendly.</p>

  <p>So it was after midnight before Tom Grayne returned to the storm-swept hut
  where he had left his guests. He found O'Mally stoking the stove and arguing
  with Mayor.</p>

  <p>"That is why," Mayor was saying, "I need your influence."</p>

  <p>"At the Foreign Office? I have none&mdash;none whatever," O'Mally
  answered. "I'm consulted now and then by the Home Office, just as you are, in
  special cases. At the Foreign Office I'm an absolute nonentity."</p>

  <p>"How about the India Office?"</p>

  <p>"Worse and worse! An Indian Rajah, who got himself into political trouble,
  was one of my patients. I'm supposed to have advised him how to prove he
  didn't poison his aunt."</p>

  <p>"Give him wine, Grayne! Make him drink it. O'Mally, I am not your patient,
  so you needn't lie to me. I happen to <i>know</i> you're on the Foreign
  Office list. That's why I invited you here. I repeat: if I should go to the
  Foreign Office, with a Home Office introduction, and tell that graciously
  insolent Sphinx Ambleby that Tom Grayne ought to go to Tibet, I should be
  courteously informed that no one is allowed to enter Tibet. Even as it is,
  Grayne is on the black book for having entered Tibet and remained there
  without permission. If you were asked what you think of him, what would you
  say?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't tell him or you that," O'Mally answered.</p>

  <p>"Say it, then, behind his back, to Ambleby." Mayor sipped wine. O'Mally
  clipped the end of a big cigar, with a platinum clipper&mdash;a personal gift
  from a crowned head. Mayor continued: "You are Ambleby's physician. He's a
  credit to you. Hundreds of people have wished him dead a thousand times over,
  but you've kept him alive. Oh, yes, I heard all about his being poisoned by a
  spy, and how you invented an antidote."</p>

  <p>"I didn't."</p>

  <p>"It was kept out of the papers, if that's what you mean. And I know,
  without being able to prove it, that you're off to Russia on a medical errand
  of your own, but with a secret errand, too, for Mr.
  Foreign-Office-Secret-Service Ambleby, who has a high opinion of your gift
  for bluff innocence and discreet observation."</p>

  <p>"You are guessing," said O'Mally. "You are talking non sense."</p>

  <p>"If," said Mayor, "<i>you</i> should go to Ambleby, and tell him what I
  have just now told you; and tell him your real opinion of Tom Grayne, Ambleby
  would regard that as a very proper introduction. I tell you, he hasn't
  another man to send to Tibet; there simply isn't one available who has Tom
  Grayne's knowledge of the country, Tom's physique and Tom's ability to take
  care of himself. And I repeat: this case isn't simple. It isn't merely a
  Tibetan feud; nor is it just another psychopathic case for you to pause and
  analyze on your way to a peerage. It's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He hesitated. O'Mally grinned.</p>

  <p>"Go on, man! Are you weakening? Say it!"</p>

  <p>"I have said it already three times."</p>

  <p>"Grayne know what you think it is?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He and I together deciphered a Japanese document that baffled me
  until Tom broke the code. If it were known Tom had seen it, I should never be
  trusted again. It was one of those documents that governments always denounce
  as forgeries when secret service agents find them in a dead man's
  wallet."</p>

  <p>O'Mally looked sharply at Grayne: "What do <i>you</i> think it is?"</p>

  <p>"I agree with Mayor."</p>

  <p>"You agree with him because you wish to go to Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"No, Sir Horace. I intend to return to Tibet with or with out a Foreign
  Office permit. You may say so, if you want to."</p>

  <p>O'Mally liked that. He uncorked another bottle of wine. He filled a glass
  for Grayne, who had hitherto not tasted it.</p>

  <p>"Here's luck to you! So you agree with Mayor? Splendid! You believe, then,
  that this is a cog in the wheels of a Japanese scheme to get control of
  China?"</p>

  <p>"Sure as you're alive," said Tom Grayne.</p>

  <p>"I'm alive, my boy. I'm alive and interested."</p>

  <p>"Then do your plain duty!" said Mayor. He was getting short-tempered. He
  laughed at himself. Then he yawned. "Strong wine&mdash;not used to it."
  Suddenly he clutched the table.</p>

  <p>The wind was howling, but it wasn't wind that shook the door. O'Mally
  dropped his monocle&mdash;caught it in mid-air&mdash;pretended he did it on
  purpose. Grayne picked up a heavy broomstick.</p>

  <p>"Sh-h-h!" said Mayor.</p>

  <p>They all listened. One lamp flickered out, short of oil. The river sucked
  the wharf-piles. The wind howled. The shed creaked. The door thudded again,
  three times, as if some one kicked it.</p>

  <p>"You're an en-n-t-tertaining host!" said Mayor. His teeth chattered.</p>

  <p>Grayne went to the peephole, saw nothing and suddenly opened the door. The
  other lamp blew out. It was pitch dark, and a gale in the room.</p>

  <p>"Duck!" yelled O'Mally. He up-ended the table, crashing everything to the
  floor. He and Mayor crouched behind the table. The door slammed. The stove
  belched smoke. Grayne had hold of some one. They were struggling, crashing
  among upset chairs and broken dishes.</p>

  <p>"Hold him!" O'Mally shouted. "I'm coming!"</p>

  <p>But he tripped over a table-leg and before he was up the door opened and
  slammed. A sudden blinding electric torch&mdash;darkness again.</p>

  <p>"All right, sir, all right, I have him! Has he hurt you?"</p>

  <p>"Police?" asked Mayor's voice. "Sure you've got him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, he's out o' mischief for the present. Get up, you! Stand over
  there!"</p>

  <p>The policeman held his flash-light steady until O'Mally relighted the
  lamp.</p>

  <p>"Lucky I saw him! Sure you're not hurt, sir?"</p>

  <p>Noropa, handcuffed, with his hands behind him, stood glaring with his back
  to the wall. One of Noropa's eyes was closing up; he was bending a bit
  forward, as if hit in the wind. Tom Grayne's coat was torn and there was
  blood on his lip. O'Mally took a stride toward Tom:</p>

  <p>"Hurt?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>O'Mally examined the prisoner. The policeman stared at the mess on the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"Did he do all this?"</p>

  <p>"No, he didn't," said O'Mally.</p>

  <p>"Thought he couldn't have. I was close on his heels. How did all this
  'appen?"</p>

  <p>O'Mally laughed testily. "It was a part of my arrangements for going to
  Russia! I didn't wish to be shot. You say you followed him here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. The constable on watch at the end of the alley saw him first,
  but I was on my way here with a message, so I killed two birds with one
  stone, as you might say. All I saw him do was kick the door. Maybe when they
  search him at the station&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What's the message?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. I took the liberty a while ago of phoning for your auto. Sir
  'Grace. It's 'ere already, at the street corner, two 'undred yards away. We
  had to phone Scotland Yard about all this. They phoned back ten minutes later
  to say there's a gentleman from the Foreign Office&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Didn't I say so?" Mayor interrupted.</p>

  <p>"He said, sir, you'd know his name without his giving it, and he'd be very
  much obliged if, on your way home, you'd drop in and see him."</p>

  <p>"At his office?"</p>

  <p>"No, at his rooms."</p>

  <p>"Told you so," Mayor repeated.</p>

  <p>Tom was staring at Noropa. "You're no Tibetan! You're not Chinese, either!
  Are you?"</p>

  <p>Noropa said nothing. He glared with one eye; the other was already swollen
  shut.</p>

  <p>"They may need my hat for evidence," remarked O'Mally. "Lend me one of
  yours, Grayne&mdash;yes, that cap will do nicely, thanks. Are you coming,
  Mayor? I can drop you at your house on my way to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Victoria Street, Westminster!" said Mayor. "Yes, I know where you're
  going."</p>

  <p>The policeman led his prisoner outside. O'Mally waited until the door had
  slammed shut behind them.</p>

  <p>"Just one moment. You, Mayor. And you, Grayne. If either of you should
  mention my name, in connection with this night's work, or for any other
  reason, at the Foreign Office, it would be breach of confidence, an
  unfriendly gesture and a damned serious indiscretion. Have I made myself
  clear? Very well. Thank you, Grayne, for supper and entertainment. Both were
  excellent. Good night. See you again some day, I hope."</p>

  <p>"Good night, Tom," said Mayor. "How early can you be at my house in the
  morning?"</p>

  <p>"Much too early for you. I'll be waiting for you down stairs."</p>

  <p>Mayor winked twice behind his gold-rimmed spectacles. He jerked his
  respectable gray head toward O'Mally's back. Grayne let them out.</p>

  <p>He had cleaned the place and was asleep on a bunk within ten minutes.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch04"
     name="ch04">CHAPTER 4.</a><br>
  "If you can do it!"</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was like any other door in the long, dim, draughty
  corridor, except that a man in blue uniform stood outside and asked Tom
  Grayne's business. The Foreign Office is like all the rest of Whitehall;
  comfort hadn't been invented when they built it. On the other hand, tradition
  was already ancient; it grows older, but it never dies, in that kind of
  building. The muscular, military-looking man in blue tapped on the door as if
  a lady were asleep within, opened the door cautiously, tiptoed in, murmured,
  and came out smiling. A neatly dressed Japanese gentleman walked along the
  corridor from behind Tom Grayne and turned the corner at the far end.</p>

  <p>"Go right in, sir. Mr. Ambleby expects you."</p>

  <p>Tom Grayne circumnavigated a beautiful old Spanish leather screen, so
  arranged that whoever stepped into the room presented his face to the desk in
  profile in the light from a high window. There was a coal fire, in a
  hideously dignified Georgian fireplace. Over the fireplace was a
  three-quarter length mirror&mdash;new glass in an antique frame; it very
  clearly reflected whoever entered the room, but it did not reveal the desk to
  him who entered.</p>

  <p>Against a background of books, in the dimness behind a big, antique desk,
  sat Arthur Tremaine Ambleby. An astonishing man, because he was so different
  from what one expected. He stood up as Tom Grayne entered and without a word,
  but with a very gracious gesture, offered him the chair beside the desk. That
  placed Tom in the light from the window.</p>

  <p>Ambleby looked like a poet, or perhaps an editor of a very learned review.
  He looked capable of having written Locksley Hall, or he might have
  translated Homer into English elegiacs. Gray hair. Wise eyes. A clean-shaven,
  courteous, civilized face. A dark leather bow tie. A leather waistcoat. An
  immaculately tailored jacket of a color that couldn't be guessed exactly
  against the background of books in the dimness. A man of perhaps sixty, who
  looked fifty and conveyed, without the slightest trace of self-importance,
  the impression of knowing all the secrets in the world and thoroughly
  enjoying them.</p>

  <p>"Professor Mayor told me to come and see you," said Tom.</p>

  <p>Ambleby nodded. There was nothing on his desk. No notes. No papers.
  Nothing that suggested that the room might be the exact center of an
  invisible spider-web of secrets that reached all over the world, into men's
  minds, hopes, ambitions, histories, forgetting nothing, overlooking not much.
  There were no files in the room. There was not even a door leading into
  another room where files perhaps might be.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Ambleby. "I spoke with Professor Mayor at three o'clock this
  morning and we discussed you. You have helped him, I believe, to decipher
  some curious documents in Tibetan and&mdash;er&mdash;and other
  languages."</p>

  <p>Tom Grayne kept silence. He liked this man, right off the bat. He was just
  the kind of man he did like. Knew his stuff. Nobody's fool. But Tom was
  thoroughly on guard against him; he anticipated one of those simple, utterly
  in nocent traps that are much harder not to fall into than the complicated
  sort. It appeared:</p>

  <p>"You have an acquaintance in Harley Street?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Wasn't he with you last night?"</p>

  <p>"Man who wears a monocle and spats? Oh, yes, I've met him. That's all. He
  doesn't know me. I don't know him."</p>

  <p>"You have visited Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I intend to return."</p>

  <p>"And you use an American passport?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"How do you propose to do it? You understand that the terms of a treaty
  between the Tibetan and Indian Governments preclude our supplying you with
  anything in the nature of a permit?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"We couldn't even give you unofficial recognition. Quite the
  contrary."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I understand that."</p>

  <p>"How then do you propose to enter Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"That, sir, is my secret. Short of locking me up or shooting me, I'm
  fairly confident that nobody can prevent my getting in."</p>

  <p>"I know how you got in, as you call it, last time."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I'm not an animal. I don't try the same trick twice
  running."</p>

  <p>"What do you propose to do in Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"Study the country. It's my subject."</p>

  <p>"Some very interesting books have been written about Tibet," said Ambleby.
  "Which particular field will your book cover?"</p>

  <p>Tom avoided that trap also. "I don't write books. The British Museum is
  crowded with information about Tibet that needs checking. Anything I learn
  for a fact I'll report to Mayor. He can do as he likes with it."</p>

  <p>"Does he supply you with funds?"</p>

  <p>"No, I have enough money of my own. I don't need much, the way I
  travel."</p>

  <p>"You know a Tibetan named Th&ouml;-pa-ga?"</p>

  <p>"Slightly. I know where he is. Professor Mayor withdrew bail at the
  request of the police, so Th&ouml;-pa-ga is either on his way from Kew or else
  already in a cell at Bow Street."</p>

  <p>"Do you know a Tibetan named Noropa?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He isn't a Tibetan."</p>

  <p>"You surprise me. What do you think he is?"</p>

  <p>"I know. He's half-Jap, half-Chinese&mdash;I'd say a Chinese father, and
  that's unusual."</p>

  <p>"He bears a bad reputation," said Ambleby. "Who is the person named John
  Sinclair, who was in the place where you live when the reporters called early
  this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;that's me. I invented that name. Old friend, phoned for by Tom
  Grayne to come and occupy the place in his absence.&mdash;Hadn't seen me
  recently&mdash;hadn't had time to talk over the phone&mdash;just hurried
  over&mdash;didn't know where I was, or when I'd be back."</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Grayne, I am not in a position to do anything for you
  officially. You are well recommended. As far as I am concerned, there is no
  objection to your entering Tibet, <i>if you can do it</i>. But, of course,
  that has nothing to do with my office. I have been in communication with the
  Home Office, and with Scotland Yard. I know what took place yesterday. Would
  you object to telling me, in confidence, what you think it all means?"</p>

  <p>"Th&ouml;-pa-ga," said Tom, "is wanted back in Tibet. Noropa has been sent to
  hound him back there. That's as clear as daylight. Probably Noropa pestered
  him with shang-shang magic, until he went into hiding. Then Noropa tipped him
  off to the police for not registering a change of address, and got him locked
  up, so he'd be deported."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that seems clear. But why should Noropa fire three bullets through
  your window?"</p>

  <p>"Simple. It costs money to return to Tibet, but if you're deported you
  travel free. Maybe, too, he wants to return on the same ship with Th&ouml;-pa-ga.
  He was careful to throw his pistol into the river. It would be pretty
  difficult, I imagine, to convict him of anything serious. And-"</p>

  <p>"Yes? And?"</p>

  <p>"If Noropa were deported by the British Government, that wouldn't
  compromise any foreign legation that other wise might have to get him visas
  and supply the necessary funds, and all that."</p>

  <p>Ambleby listened as if he were being told something that he didn't know.
  He looked vaguely, politely, not exactly incredulous but non-committal. Tom
  Grayne knew he was being studied, parsed, analyzed, doped out, criticized,
  considered&mdash;all behind a mask of courteously guarded interest.</p>

  <p>One thing was already quite clear in Tom's mind: if he wanted Ambleby's
  help in any way, for any purpose, he had first to demonstrate his own value,
  and even so the help would not be openly done or acknowledged. Ambleby would
  tell him nothing more than he already knew.</p>

  <p>"Hell!" Tom said suddenly. "Mayor gave me a hint who you are, so I'll talk
  horse. The Japs will have to starve and even cease to be a nation if they
  can't grab China. There's nothing else for them to do. Therefore, China it
  is. And China used to own Tibet. The new ruler of Tibet will be a young child
  in the hands of regents. That's to say when they've found the right child,
  and they haven't yet, though they pretended they had. But the Tashi Lama* is
  another story. He's the religious head of things. His influence, under a
  semi-political mask, still reaches all through China, along Buddhist
  channels. The Japs thoroughly understand the Buddhist psychology."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Tashi Lama</i>&mdash;any of a succession of Tibetan
  monks and spiritual leaders, second in importance to the Dalai Lama. Also
  called Bainquen Lama, Panchen Lama, Panchen Rimpoche. ]</p>

  <p>"Do you think they do?" asked Ambleby.</p>

  <p>"Sure. Lots of Japs are Buddhists. They understand it, any how, a damned
  sight better than the Germans understood the rest of us in 1914. There's a
  secret sept in Lhasa called the
  Wishful-ones-who-stand-in-awe-before-the-Thunder-Dragon-Gate. It's one word.
  They are reputed to be black magicians. They're said to be (and I think it's
  true) the only Tibetan really secret sept who will admit Chinamen into their
  ranks. Th&ouml;-pa-ga's father was the figurehead lama known as the
  Worshipfully-born-Keeper-of-the-Thunder-Dragon-Gate. That is also one word.
  Most lamas are forbidden to marry, but that particular lama is obliged to
  marry. He has to marry a woman selected for him by the men in the dark, who
  have the real power. They are known as the Worshipful-name-
  less-ones-in-the-dark-who-see-the-light-that-is-coming. That again is one
  word. The Keeper of the Thunder Dragon Gate is merely their mouthpiece, but
  he issues oracular messages, prophecies and commands, that filter through, in
  writing and by word of mouth to wherever Buddhism has any influence open or
  secret. The office of Keeper of the Thunder Dragon Gate descends from father
  to son, which is another thing unusual in Tibet. Every thirteenth one in
  succession is always named Th&ouml;-pa-ga. The name means 'Wonderful-to-hear.' And
  there's a tradition, thoroughly believed, that the ones named Th&ouml;-pa-ga are
  more important than the others: that their coming always coincides with great
  changes."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know all that," said Ambleby. It was a rather surprising admission
  from him.</p>

  <p>Tom continued:</p>

  <p>"Well then, what is there to stop the Japs from getting control of the
  Keeper of the Thunder Dragon Gate? If he's a shang-shang victim&mdash;that's
  to say if he has been thoroughly well voodooed&mdash;they can make him send
  out propaganda, by word of mouth and secret writing, that should favorably
  influence quite a lot of Chinese in the matter of Japanese designs on
  China."</p>

  <p>"Do you think the Chinese might be influenced in that way?"</p>

  <p>"Just as readily as we Americans were coaxed into the World War. Why not?
  Artfully managed propaganda can accomplish anything. But it has to be artful.
  The Japs understand that perfectly. That's why they prepared a throne in
  Manchukuo for the ex-Emperor of China. That's again why about thirty million
  Chinese have already emigrated into Manchukuo. The Emperor isn't a Chinaman,
  he's a Manchu. They know it. He has no power. They know that. But he means
  something to the Chinese mind that can't be substituted. All the Japs have to
  do after that, is to provide a tolerable government, for which the Chinese
  give the puppet Emperor the credit."</p>

  <p>"So you think Th&ouml;-pa-ga is being hounded back to Tibet to become the
  mouthpiece of Japan?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, to about a hundred million people&mdash;some of 'em in India, some
  in Ceylon and Burma&mdash;some in French Indo-China&mdash;many of 'em in
  Malaysia and the Dutch East Indies&mdash;but the great majority in
  China."</p>

  <p>"But why, Mr. Grayne, should they go to all that trouble? For instance,
  supposing young Th&ouml;-pa-ga should have been shot dead in your dwelling last
  night, why couldn't they put a substitute in his place?"</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what they will do&mdash;and they'll pick an obedient
  nitwit, some one they have thoroughly psychologized to do the job, if they
  can't get hold of the real man. But if you know the first thing about Tibet,
  you'll realize they'd prefer the right man. Those people believe their own
  medicine. A substituted Th&ouml;-pa-ga would undo their own belief in themselves
  and their magic. This man probably has well-known birth-marks. And besides,
  they'd have to murder him before they could put in a substitute. They'd have
  a job on their hands to bring the substitute in from abroad, because it's
  common knowledge in Lhasa that Th&ouml;-pa-ga was sent to England for an
  education. The Dalai Lama's regents, who hate the Tashi Lama like the devil,
  would be pretty sure to try to expose and denounce a substitute. The Japs
  wouldn't have any faith in a substitute, either."</p>

  <p>Ambleby betrayed no other emotion than courteous interest.</p>

  <p>"It does sometimes happen," he said, "that certain governments employ a
  strictly unofficial means toward an undeclared objective. I have, of course,
  no knowledge of Japanese methods. However, there is a medical report to the
  effect that Th&ouml;-pa-ga might die soon, if he were permitted to remain in
  England. In the circumstances, since there is a balance to the credit of the
  fund that was sent from Tibetan sources for his Oxford education, it might be
  quite the proper thing to send him home in charge of some one. Are you
  willing to undertake that? Could you leave, say, day after to-morrow, from
  Hendon?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes."</p>

  <p>Ambleby's next remark withdrew the corner of a veil from undercover
  statecraft:</p>

  <p>"Dr. Noropa will be deported, I am told. In England there are legal
  difficulties, but in India he can be detained for enquiries, under an Order
  in Council that provides for such contingencies. You are unlikely to be
  troubled by Noropa.&mdash;Do you happen to know any one in Delhi?" The
  question sounded quite casual.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes."</p>

  <p>"For instance?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, lots of people."</p>

  <p>Ambleby smiled. "It wouldn't help you in the least," he said, "if you
  should mention me. But when you reach Delhi, if you should call on Mr. Norman
  Johnson, of the Bureau of Ethnology, and mention Professor Mayor, you might
  find Mr. Norman Johnson helpful. He would be interested to meet Th&ouml;-pa-ga.
  With his help, I imagine Th&ouml;-pa-ga will be able to reach Tibet."</p>

  <p>"Okay."</p>

  <p>"Could you leave your passport with me? I will have it visaed. I am
  informed that the police have saved your effects from being put out into the
  rain by your landlord."</p>

  <p>"Oh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It appears the wharf is unsafe. Where would you like your things
  sent?"</p>

  <p>Tom smiled. All his private papers were locked in a bank vault.</p>

  <p>"Robbin's Hotel," he said, "Golden Square."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Mr. Grayne. Th&ouml;-pa-ga will meet you at the plane, at Hendon,
  day after to-morrow. Your ticket as far as Delhi and your passport shall be
  handed to you at the same time. Keep away, please, from Professor Mayor. No
  harm, I think, in phoning to him, provided you use discretion, but don't be
  seen at his house or in his company. I think that is all for the present.
  Should you ever return alive from&mdash;er&mdash;Delhi, drop in and see
  me."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. Yes, I'll do that."</p>

  <p>It was raining like the devil. Tom took a taxi. It was followed by another
  taxi to Robbin's Hotel, an old-fashioned place, recently redecorated, of the
  type that Americans dread but the English permit to survive. Tom went
  straight to the desk and signed the register. A very well-dressed Japanese
  followed him into the hotel, asked for mail, received it and stood reading it
  near the desk.</p>

  <p>"Can I have my usual room? Any mail for me?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the same room. No, Mr. Grayne, no letters."</p>

  <p>"Is Miss Burbage in? I will speak on the phone."</p>

  <p>"Booth One, sir."</p>

  <p>"Hello Elsa."</p>

  <p>"Hello Tom. Did you read the morning paper?"</p>

  <p>"No. Why should I?"</p>

  <p>"You're on the front page."</p>

  <p>"That's no reason. Get your facts from him as knows 'em! Listen: you'll
  need your cheque-book."</p>

  <p>"Tom, are you in trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Hell, no. Have you your passport? Indian tourist visa?"</p>

  <p>"I have had it in my purse for six weeks."</p>

  <p>"Cut along down to Cooks and buy yourself a reservation on the plane for
  Karachi, day after to-morrow. Better go to the bank first.&mdash;Yes, about
  that much&mdash;draw out plenty&mdash;fifty pounds more would be better.
  After you've made your reservation, meet me in the downstairs room at
  Doby's."</p>

  <p>"All right, Tom."</p>

  <p>He returned to the desk. The Jap was still there, writing something. "I'm
  expecting a couple of suit-cases and a load of junk from Kew. Put the junk in
  the cellar&mdash;everything else into my room."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Did you see your name on the front page?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. I spelt it for them."</p>

  <p>They had spelt his name wrong, which was all to the good. He turned up his
  overcoat collar, thrust his fists into his pockets and walked out, striding
  like a man who meant to walk around the world. As he turned the corner he saw
  the Jap standing in the hotel doorway&mdash;saw him nod to a taxi-driver. The
  taxi drove away, slowly, and turned the same corner. It might mean nothing.
  But he was the same smart, well-dressed Japanese who had walked along the
  corridor in the Foreign Office.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch05"
     name="ch05">CHAPTER 5.</a><br>
  "They should rate you AAA One Hundred Plus."</h2>

  <p class="first">"Ton, I don't look excited. I swear I don't! Yes, I got the
  last seat there was. They had just sold the last-but-one. I have twelve
  hundred pounds in the bank. I have kept a small trunk packed ever since you
  warned me to be ready. And I'm so sick of Robbin's Hotel&mdash;no I'm not, I
  love it!&mdash;I will kick it good-by, and come back a couple of years from
  now and love it all over again!"</p>

  <p>"Kick your trunk good-by," he answered. "Stick some doodads in a handbag.
  Buy all the rest of the stuff in India."</p>

  <p>"Tom, this isn't true! It simply isn't."</p>

  <p>"It won't be, if you don't listen carefully. The least slip, and it's all
  off. They'd cancel everything."</p>

  <p>"I am all ears."</p>

  <p>She wasn't. She had remarkably well-shaped ears, half hidden in a
  wind-blown bob of curly dark hair, under a Cossack kaftan. She was so small,
  and full of naturally ready laughter, that she looked almost Tom Grayne's
  opposite, except for a similar, equally hard to define but quite evident
  vigor of being. She might be twenty-two or twenty-three, but looked younger.
  She had small, strong, sun-browned hands. Her feet were tucked under her, in
  the big red leather arm-chair. Doby's downstairs fireplace was living up to
  its reputation; it was about the most comfortable fireside in London in rainy
  weather. There were a lot of luncheon tables, but no one ever came there much
  before twelve-thirty. The waiter had brought tea, taken his cue from the size
  of the tip, and left them alone. The tea was untouched.</p>

  <p>"You take the airplane bus to Hendon," said Tom, "day after to-morrow. I
  take a taxi. There'll be a messenger with flowers for you and some fruit and
  chocolates, in the name of oh, any old name I think of when I order 'em.
  We're just nodding acquaintances, you and I. We get to know each other a bit
  on the journey, and after that, you use your wiles on Th&ouml;-pa-ga. Worm your
  way into his confidence."</p>

  <p>"I've never been in a plane. I want to make enormous noises on a B-flat
  saxophone."</p>

  <p>"You understand now, don't you, how all this happened? Or shall I repeat
  it?"</p>

  <p>"No, no. I have understood you. I understand that Th&ouml;-pa-ga is being
  hounded back to Tibet, and that he doesn't guess what we're after, or know
  you except for last night's happenings, or trust you or trust any one
  else."</p>

  <p>"Th&ouml;-pa-ga," said Tom, "needs friends. He needs them badly. He needs some
  one to whom he can talk. He has a persecution complex, and I don't blame him,
  poor devil. He's a particularly sensitive type of oriental. He would
  instantly detect an unsympathetic motive. He suspects Mayor. He suspects me.
  He mustn't suspect you, and there's only one possible way to fix that. You
  must make up your mind to be his friend, no matter what he does or what
  happens to him. You must be absolutely on the level with him. Never tell me
  his secrets without his full permission. Gradually get him to trust me."</p>

  <p>"And then what?"</p>

  <p>"I told you: he needs friends, not enemies. We can't get what we're after
  on a basis of something for nothing. Th&ouml;-pa-ga comes first, or we'll be
  fooled badly. All of us will be."</p>

  <p>"How about Uncle Clarence?"</p>

  <p>"Not one word to him! Not a hint! Not a word to a soul except Emily
  Foster, and nothing to her except to repeat instructions, from a public phone
  booth, if you think it necessary&mdash;but don't go near her. She is simply
  to put any thing you send to her into another envelope and mail it to
  Professor Clarence Mayor. Your Uncle Clarence doesn't know our private code.
  It would be a mistake if he did. The idea is this: you know the code by
  heart&mdash;you're sure? Word perfect?"</p>

  <p>"I can say it backwards. I can signal it faster than you can read it."</p>

  <p>"Okay. If I should write from India to Professor Mayor in London, my
  letters would be read in transit, even if they should never reach him, which
  they very likely wouldn't. But if I send something to you, by mail or
  messenger, in code, and you decode it and mail it to Emily Foster&mdash;an
  innocent, middle-aged lady who lives at Dorking&mdash;and she re-mails it to
  your Uncle Clarence, he will safely receive an unsigned communication that
  can't easily be traced back."</p>

  <p>"Then you and I won't be together in India?"</p>

  <p>"Not noticeably, to begin with. Certainly not in the same hotel. You're a
  tourist, remember. You'll have to play that part carefully; tourists, as a
  rule, don't visit India in the hot season. Don't let on that you can read
  Tibetan, or that you know anything about Tibet. Don't even let Th&ouml;-pa-ga know
  that, if you can help it. But if you get caught knowing more than girls of
  your age usually know, you can admit that you've studied a bit at the British
  Museum and that you picked up odds and ends from Th&ouml;-pa-ga on the
  journey."</p>

  <p>"I'll be careful."</p>

  <p>"Better be. If you make even one bad break, the Indian Government, of
  course, would simply ask us to leave India. But the Tibetan gang would give
  us the works. Very likely poison."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why I can't tell Uncle Clarence. Isn't he in on it?"</p>

  <p>"No, you chucklehead! He doesn't even guess that the deaf-and-dumb loony,
  who files away the notes I send him, copies them and passes them along."</p>

  <p>"Tom, <i>that</i> poor old thing?"</p>

  <p>"He's a Polak, whose father was an interpreter at the U.S. consulate in
  Warsaw for twenty-five years. Draw your own conclusions, but keep them under
  your hat. The system is run on a basis of never letting one agent know
  another agent, or what the other agent is doing if it can be helped, and
  never letting any one agent know more than necessary. Your Uncle Clarence is
  a useful man, in his particular line. They'd can him in a second if they
  guessed his deaf-and-dumb clerk is my go-between. If they thought Mayor
  guessed what you're up to, they'd never trust him again. It's an unforgivable
  offense to have a private iron in the fire, and an almost unthinkable thing
  for a girl like you to try to enter Tibet. If you should tell Mayor, he'd be
  furious. He'd warn Ambleby. That would be the end of me. They're only using
  me because there's no one else who fits the problem at the moment. If they
  guessed you are in my confidence, they'd have no use for me whatever. I'm
  only using them because it's the best chance in sight. They haven't okayed me
  yet. The man in Delhi may not like my guts. They're touchy, the Indian
  Government crew; they like the Foreign Office outfit about as much as I like
  being told what to believe. The India Office people, here in London, love me
  like a Bolshevik."</p>

  <p>Elsa looked puzzled. Curled in the chair, she suggested a terrier, aching
  to be taken hunting, absolutely confident that any hunting, under Tom's
  direction, would be first rate. Some women, even to-day, have that excellent
  faith in a man. But it was not as simple as all that evidently.</p>

  <p>"Then, if we get into Tibet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>When</i> we get there," he corrected.</p>

  <p>"All right, when! You will&mdash;you say we're merely making use of
  them&mdash;you will ditch all this and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't believe that for a second," he answered. "Nothing for nothing in
  this world. Make your bargain, settle clearly in your own mind what the
  bargain is, then deliver the goods or bust. It isn't only the British Empire
  that is vitally interested in knowing who is planning what in China. I'm as
  interested in the Thunder Dragon Gate as they are. If I weren't, I'd find
  some other way of getting into Tibet. Pay as you go. Then you get what you're
  after. Speaking of which, you'd better go and buy yourself a letter of
  credit. Have it drawn on a bank in Delhi. If you've anything to say to me at
  the hotel, talk deaf-and-dumb and use the code. Don't phone my room if you
  can avoid it. Store your trunk. Twenty-eight pounds of luggage. Burn your
  boats. Hernando Cortez had nothing on you and me."</p>

  <p>"I know it. Tom, do you guess how thoroughly I've burned my boats? They're
  ashes. If I don't make good, I'm done for."</p>

  <p>"Scared?"</p>

  <p>"No, Tom, are you? Please don't be. I won't let you down. I'm little to
  look at, but&mdash;d'you think I'm&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted: "Don't talk piffle. You're game, all right. You're on the
  level. But some jobs are too tough for some people. Even now it's not too
  late to call it off. I'd trust you to hold your tongue."</p>

  <p>"I have burned my boats!" she answered. "Tibet!"</p>

  <p>Tom scowled. He hated to have to explain himself.</p>

  <p>"You're full of enthusiasm," he said, "so you believe what you wish to
  believe. I'm reminding you for the last time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't, Tom, you don't need to."</p>

  <p>She might as well have tried to stop a steam-roller.</p>

  <p>"You've no rating. None. I've no authority from any one to tell you my
  secrets&mdash;let alone to try to get you into Tibet."</p>

  <p>"Tom, I know all that. You're being generous beyond the dreams
  of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Generous nothing. If you'll keep your head you can be useful. There isn't
  another girl on earth who has your special ability. But remember, I turned
  you down flat in the first instance, and I told you why."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Tom."</p>

  <p>"Certain people trust me because they know I don't get tangled up with any
  woman who might soften me or blurt out what I'm doing. I have trained you as
  well as I could in the little time we've had. But we're taking a whale of a
  long chance. Both of us. If it were known I married you to give you a certain
  amount of possible legal protection in case I'm bumped off, they'd rate me
  from then on as a sentimentalist. In my profession that's the zero
  rating."</p>

  <p>Elsa nodded. "They should rate you AAA One hundred plus."</p>

  <p>"That's the point. They rate a fellow by results. You can't look to me for
  the slightest recognition of anything but your personal value to me as an
  assistant, strictly on your merits&mdash;and a secret assistant at that."</p>

  <p>"I expect nothing else."</p>

  <p>"Not now, you don't. But you don't know what's ahead. No matter how tight
  the jam you're in, you've got to stick to the agreement. Your only value to
  me is your intelligence, obedience and pluck. I want nothing else from you.
  Your marriage certificate simply entitles you to the key to my strongbox if
  I'm bumped off. Your marriage is so secret, and so otherwise meaningless,
  that you mayn't even get a divorce without my permission&mdash;and I won't
  give permission until secrecy no longer matters."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said. "I agree. I understand perfectly."</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to get you into Tibet simply and solely because I think you'll
  be useful."</p>

  <p>"I will deserve it," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Damn!" he said suddenly, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

  <p>The Jap had come in. The same Jap. Because of the high chair-back Tom
  hadn't noticed him until he slipped into a chair in the corner by the row of
  pegs, on which they had hung their overcoats. The Jap ordered tea. When the
  waiter had brought it he sat sipping and studying something that he took from
  an envelope. He didn't stare noticeably.</p>

  <p>"Get your coat," Tom signaled with the fingers of one hand. "What is he
  reading?"</p>

  <p>Elsa went and powdered her nose before she lifted her coat from the peg.
  She used a rather large square mirror. She was less than six feet away from
  the Jap. There was not a lot of light in that corner of the room; the
  manipulation of the mirror was quite plausible.</p>

  <p>"Airplane ticket," she announced, when she returned to the fireside.</p>

  <p>"Where to?"</p>

  <p>"Couldn't read it, but it looks like Karachi."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch06"
     name="ch06">CHAPTER 6.</a><br>
  "Have your meals with me while you're in Delhi."</h2>

  <p class="first">EIJI SARAO, the Japanese merchant, made himself altogether
  too agreeable. He was very widely traveled. He could talk the colloquial
  peasant speech that passes muster along the Chino-Tibetan border, and he
  missed no opportunity, on the long flight from London to Karachi, to get in
  conversation with Tom, Elsa and Th&ouml;-pa-ga.</p>

  <p>However, Th&ouml;-pa-ga was ill&mdash;not plane-sick but becoming feeble from
  some obscure ailment that was aggravated, if not produced by his mental
  depression. It had been very difficult indeed to talk to Th&ouml;-pa-ga. He was an
  aristocrat; he resented that peasant dialect, and besides, he had partly for
  gotten it, or said he had. Mr. Eiji Sarao had not learned much from
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga.</p>

  <p>But he made it almost impossible for Tom and Elsa to exchange confidences.
  His bright little eyes watched them continually. He detected their use of
  finger signals. He tacitly assumed that they were traveling together. At
  every pause in the long journey, he tried to get them into a three-cornered
  conversation.</p>

  <p>At Karachi he had no trouble at all with the immigration authorities. Tom,
  on the other hand, had to enter an office near the hangar and answer
  searching questions. His passport, visaed in red ink by the India Office,
  merely stated that he was accompanying Mr. Th&ouml;-pa-ga as far as Delhi. The
  immigration officer, a gray-mustached ex-soldier, referred to a little
  indexed memorandum-book.</p>

  <p>"You have visited India before, Mr. Grayne. Weren't you invited to
  leave?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But do you recognize that visa?"</p>

  <p>"That isn't the point. For what reason, two years ago, were you told to
  get out?"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't. As you put it the first time, I was invited to leave. You can
  get the facts from your files, can't you? If you choose to disregard that
  visa, take the consequences. I have no idea what they'll be. For all I know,
  you may have authority to override the India Office. If so, do it and let's
  see what happens."</p>

  <p>The officer smiled. He had very intelligent brown eyes. "What is the
  nature of your relationship with Mr. Eiji Sarao?" he asked after a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"You mean that Jap who traveled on the same plane? None whatever. I don't
  know him. Never spoke to him or heard his name before he boarded the plane at
  Hendon."</p>

  <p>"I am informed that you and he made frequent use of the deaf-and-dumb
  alphabet during the journey."</p>

  <p>Tom laughed. "That airplane steward probably has one glass eye. Did he say
  he saw the Jap doing it?"</p>

  <p>"Very well, to whom were you signaling?"</p>

  <p>"To myself, for practise."</p>

  <p>"Mm! Have you designs on Tibet this time?"</p>

  <p>"Delhi."</p>

  <p>"Nothing beyond Delhi? Are you willing to agree to do your business in
  Delhi, and to leave India within a reasonable time&mdash;say, three
  weeks?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Understand me, Mr. Grayne: I have no information that suggests you should
  be classed with what are commonly called undesirable aliens. But it might put
  the Indian Government to a very great deal of trouble and expense if you
  should attempt to repeat your former indiscretion. Tibet is a closed
  frontier. To bring you back from the border of Tibet would be a thoroughly
  unnecessary episode, that might have awkward diplomatic consequences, and is
  well to guard against."</p>

  <p>"Okay. Guard against it."</p>

  <p>"Will you give your promise, in writing?"</p>

  <p>"You mean not to enter Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"Not to try to enter Tibet. You could never do it again, I can assure you.
  But not to try to do it."</p>

  <p>"If a promise is all you want," said Tom, "I'll make one. How's this: I
  promise faithfully, on my word of honor, to do everything humanly possible to
  get into Tibet as soon as I can."</p>

  <p>The officer grinned.</p>

  <p>"Well, you're frank about it! Any friends in Delhi?"</p>

  <p>"Dozens."</p>

  <p>"To whom do you intend to deliver Mr. Th&ouml;-pa-ga?"</p>

  <p>"To the first good doctor I can find. The man's sick."</p>

  <p>The officer scribbled a name and address on a slip of paper.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Lewis has had a lot of experience with Tibetan cases. He was
  stationed for a long time at Darjeeling. Try him. Very well, Mr. Grayne, I
  shall have to report you as dangerous."</p>

  <p>"Deadly!" Tom answered. "Obviously in league with a Japanese cotton-goods
  salesman to bring about a communist revolution led by shamans from
  Tibet!"</p>

  <p>The officer stood up to shake hands. "I enjoyed your article on Tibetan
  magic in the <i>Asian Review</i>," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I didn't write it," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"Isn't your <i>nom de plume</i> Bloomsbury?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Will you give my regards to Dr. Lewis?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>It had been almost on the tip of Tom Grayne's tongue to say that P.K.
  Bloomsbury was Dr. Clarence Mayor's <i>nom de plume</i>. Not that that
  mattered. Dozens of people knew it. But if Tom had confessed that <i>he</i>
  knew it, that might have had disastrous consequences. As he had drummed into
  Elsa's consciousness on every possible occasion, there is no knowing who has
  been told to discover, by means of apparently innocent questions, whether or
  not you can be trusted not to mention names or claim acquaintance with men on
  the inside.</p>

  <p>And now, the Jap even invaded the same compartment on the train. He was
  very courteous. He offered aspirin to Th&ouml;-pa-ga, who seemed to suffer
  tortures from the heat and lolled back limply in a corner. Eiji Sarao knew
  all about Delhi hotels; he recommended one to Elsa&mdash;told her, too, of
  shops where she could buy whatever clothes she might need. Elsa, observing
  Tom's signal, accepted the Jap's advice about where to stay. Tom remarked he
  would probably stay with a friend; leading questions only led to more and
  more evasive answers.</p>

  <p>When they reached Delhi at last, and the heat under the station roof
  almost made Th&ouml;-pa-ga collapse, the extremely friendly Mr. Eiji Sarao was
  rather evidently puzzled by the farewell between Tom and Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Good-by. Thanks for all your kindness."</p>

  <p>"Kindness nothing. I enjoyed your company. Hope you'll enjoy India.
  Perhaps we'll meet again some day, somewhere. Who knows? Good-by."</p>

  <p>Tom took a taxi with Th&ouml;-pa-ga to Dr. Lewis's office. That address had not
  been given him for nothing. No one&mdash;absolutely no one was going to take
  responsibility for his entering Tibet. They wanted him to do it, off his own
  bat, at his own risk. No one was going to tell him anything, of any
  importance, in so many plain words. If he hadn't enough intelligence to
  understand hints, then he was the wrong man for the job and the usual
  governmental agencies would easily stop him in the course of the usual day's
  work. If he hadn't wits enough, he would be stymied without being able to say
  that any one had even as much as suggested to him that it might be possible
  to cross the Tibetan border.</p>

  <p>That immigration officer wasn't the regular man; he hadn't even known
  where to look for the switch to regulate the force of the electric-fan in the
  office. But he had done his job pretty well. He had served warning to Tom to
  look out for the departmental mechanism that prevents the unwise, wishful
  wanderer from breaking bounds. He had warned him, too, against Eiji
  Sarao&mdash;as if that were necessary!</p>

  <p>In the taxi, whirling through the crowded Delhi semi-modern streets that
  reeked of hot humanity and sprinkled pavement, he didn't have to bother about
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga. The man was almost comatose, although Tom was pretty sure he
  wasn't as ill as he looked; he was suffering from a sort of psychic blue
  funk. It was probably true, as he had declared suddenly in the shed that
  night, that he would rather die than return to Tibet. Perhaps Dr. Lewis could
  fix that. If not, a high elevation would do it. Meanwhile, Eiji Sarao?
  Noropa? The mysterious Noropa had had time to phone to half the Japanese in
  London in the interval between the Bow Street incident and his arrest that
  night at Kew.</p>

  <p>Embassies and consulates don't openly employ a shang-shang expert. It
  would be an absolutely safe bet that no one, not even the secret service, or
  Scotland Yard, or Ambleby could prove any connection between "Doctor" Noropa
  and the Japanese Government. No doubt Eiji Sarao was an eminent man of
  affairs who represented a Tokyo cotton combine, as he said. But some third
  person, who knew Noropa, also might know Eiji Sarao. Or possibly Eiji Sarao
  knew Noropa. Eiji Sarao's visit to the Foreign Office might have been a mere
  coincidence; there was no reason why a distinguished foreign visitor to
  London shouldn't call there. But it hardly looked like a coincidence that
  Eiji Sarao booked a seat on that plane to Karachi. It was certainly not a
  coincidence that he had followed from Robbin's Hotel to Doby's downstairs
  lunch room. He had probably had a spy in the street&mdash;perhaps a
  taxi-driver.</p>

  <p>It would be a fairly safe bet that a warning was already en route, in the
  innocent guise of a commercial telegram, to some confederate in Northern
  India to keep an eye on Tom Grayne <i>and</i> Elsa Burbage. Not so good.</p>

  <p>Some one in Eiji Sarao's pay certainly would go through Elsa's belongings
  at the hotel. Japs excel at that game; in Japan they even open all the
  letters that the tourist school-marms send home to their sisters and their
  cousins and their aunts. They wouldn't learn much from Elsa's luggage.</p>

  <p>Dr. Lewis's office turned out to be on the ground floor of a hospital
  courtyard. There was the usual crowd of patients and patients' relatives
  squatting on the shady side of the yard; the usual half-obsequious,
  half-insolent <i>chuprassi*</i> at the office door; the usual Chi-chi clerk,
  inclined to give him self airs; the usual delay, on bent-wood chairs beneath
  a whirling fan. A vague smell of iodoform. A portrait of King George on an
  otherwise blank wall. A "no smoking" sign. A painted glass window in a door
  marked "Private. No admittance." A spot of glass, from which the paint had
  been removed, about the size of a half-rupee, at about the height of a man's
  eye from the floor.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Chuprassi</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a uniformed doorkeeper;
  also a messenger or servant wearing an official badge. ]</p>

  <p>Tom was aware he was being stared at through the peep-hole for two or
  three minutes before the door opened and Dr. Lewis came out to greet him. He
  was in a white suit, white aproned, pulling off rubber gloves. A
  jolly-looking fellow. Sharp nose. One eyebrow higher than the other. Two or
  three scars on his face. Straight, unruly, almost carrot-colored hair. Very
  likely fifty, perhaps older. Half his right-hand middle finger missing.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tom Grayne? How do you do? Come in. This the patient? Some one phoned
  me from Karachi to expect you. Bring him in and let's see what's wrong."</p>

  <p>He motioned Tom to a chair beside a desk and led Th&ouml;-pa-ga to another
  chair beside a window. He got busy at once with a stethoscope.</p>

  <p>There was a long counter at one end of the room, burdened with all sorts
  of bottles, phials, scales and retorts. On the desk was a microscope and a
  lot of implements. Something that smelt pretty rank was boiling in a covered
  container over an alcohol burner on a white-enameled table on wheels. There
  was nothing in the room worth particular attention except Lewis himself, the
  fact that he had indicated that particular chair beside the desk instead of
  either of two other chairs&mdash;and the radio message that lay on the desk,
  exactly where whoever should use that particular chair couldn't possibly help
  seeing it. Tom's eyes devoured it:</p>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>DR. MORGAN LEWIS<br>
  EDITH CAVELL MEMORIAL HOSPITAL<br>
  DELHI, INDIA<br>
  AWAIT BY AIR MAIL GRAIN CONSIDERED SUITABLE FOR SHANG-SHANG EXPERIMENT AND
  ALSO NECESSARY MONGOLIAN EXTRACT RECOMMEND BOTH TO YOUR DISCREET ATTENTION
  BEST WISHES AND KIND REGARDS HORACE O'MALLY</tt></p>

  <p>The date tallied. Sir Horace O'Mally had despatched that from London
  before leaving for Russia&mdash;after his midnight interview with somebody in
  Westminster.</p>

  <p>Th&ouml;-pa-ga had his shirt off. He was being systematically thumped. The
  doctor strode to the desk presently, touched a button and returned to the
  patient. He appeared to doubt one of the lungs. He resumed business with the
  stethoscope, until an orderly appeared&mdash;another Chi-chi, twice as dark
  as the Tibetan.</p>

  <p>"Bath&mdash;bed&mdash;light diet&mdash;observation. Private room. And tell
  the head nurse I will be up there to study the case in half an hour."</p>

  <p>"Card, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I will sign that later."</p>

  <p>"It's against the rule, sir, to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do as I tell you."</p>

  <p>Th&ouml;-pa-ga, with his shirt unbuttoned, followed the orderly out of the
  room. Dr. Lewis came and smiled in front of Tom Grayne. He lit a cigarette
  and offered his case.</p>

  <p>"The rules," he remarked, "are blessed in the breach, like etiquette. But
  breach 'em at the right time! That thing boiling in there is a gentleman's
  liver. He hadn't sense enough to break a rule. He was too polite. He ate what
  was put in front of him. We shall know soon what it was he died of, and
  perhaps who did it&mdash;although that's less likely. Your man will be dead
  pretty soon if you can't get him up to the Hills. I can probably put him in
  shape for the journey. I advise Darjeeling."</p>

  <p>He picked up the radio message, as if he hadn't known it was there. He put
  it into a drawer.</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to know my friend Horace O'Mally of Harley Street?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Tom Grayne. "I have met him, once, casually, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Didn't he leave on a visit to Moscow?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Take that other chair, it's easier, and tell me something that you do
  know."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Tom, "I know the road to Tibet."</p>

  <p>"Good. Then you don't need my advice to be careful what you eat and drink.
  I'm going to give you some iron rations of my own invention, for emergency
  use, when you happen to doubt what's set in front of you."</p>

  <p>"Damned kind of you."</p>

  <p>"No. Merely thoughtful. Have your meals with me while you're in
  Delhi."</p>

  "Memo. buy some american chewing-gum."</h2>

  <p class="first">"I SPENT eleven years near the Tibetan border," said Lewis.
  He wasn't looking at Tom Grayne; he stuck his hands deep in his pants
  pockets, leaned against the desk, and talked familiarly, as if to an old
  acquaintance, as if there was no need to do any thawing whatever. Tom,
  however, knew that any overt attempt on his part to win Lewis's confidence
  would have the opposite effect. He maintained his reserve and let the doctor
  do the leading.</p>

  <p>"Sikkim?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and Bhutan."</p>

  <p>"Good country. I bet you liked it."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I made a lot of friends among the lamas. Knew a lot of sorcerers,
  too&mdash;shamans&mdash;all sorts of people. Tried to swap facts with 'em.
  Couldn't. I spent two-thirds of my pay on medicines and so on, to give to the
  shamans: cascara, quinine and stuff like that, that they passed along as
  elementary magic. In exchange they'd tell me pretty nearly any thing I knew
  already, but nothing more than that. Poisons? Couldn't get a word from them.
  Magic? They'd laugh and swear there was no such thing. If you added it up, I
  daresay I spent a third of my time trying to get what I supposed you'd call
  the low-down on a shang-shang. I used to write to O'Mally in London. He's
  well read. He's a very intelligent student of the vagaries of the human mind,
  is Sir Horace O'Mally. But his suggestions of lines of investigation led no
  where. Our letters on the shang-shang subject alone would make a fat volume.
  In the end we both came to the same conclusion."</p>

  <p>"That a shang-shang exists in the realm of illusion," Tom suggested.</p>

  <p>"No. It lives and moves and has its being, but the legends about it are
  lies. That's why a shang-shang is so damned deadly. And I'm convinced that
  the Thugs, who used to terrorize India, were rather mild and inoffensive
  gentry compared to the shang-shang magicians. They're a very highly
  organized, intelligent and mysterious gang of terrorists, with no
  discoverable motive for their practises other than sheer malice and
  self-importance."</p>

  <p>"Did you happen to hear of the Thunder Dragon Gate?" Tom asked him.</p>

  <p>Lewis glanced at him sharply and looked away again. "Yes. I did. That's
  where shang-shang sendings are supposed to come from. I'm convinced it's an
  actual temple or shrine of some sort. But I don't know where it is."</p>

  <p>"Th&ouml;-pa-ga is the hereditary Keeper of the Thunder Dragon Gate," said Tom
  Grayne.</p>

  <p>Again Lewis looked straight at him. "Has he told you anything about
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing that I didn't know already."</p>

  <p>Lewis nodded. "I might be able to make him talk. Care to come upstairs and
  see me try?"</p>

  <p>"No," Tom answered. "He's suspicious of me as it is. I want his
  confidence. If you can help me indirectly to get that, I'll reciprocate, if,
  as and when possible."</p>

  <p>Lewis nodded again. "Where are you staying in Delhi?"</p>

  <p>"Don't know yet. Came straight here."</p>

  <p>"Try Ingleby's Hotel. It's a new place."</p>

  <p>"Okay, thanks, I'll do that. Any suggestions about Darjeeling?"</p>

  <p>"Are you acquainted there? Do you happen to know the Ringding Gelong
  Monastery? The Abbot's name is&mdash;damn, I'll forget my own name
  next&mdash;well, no matter, it's in my note-book."</p>

  <p>"Mu-ni Gam-po," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you know him, do you? Well, you couldn't do better than take your man
  to that monastery. The high elevation, the familiar monastic atmosphere and
  old Mu-ni Gam-po's amused arbitrariness should do more to restore him to
  health than anything else I can think of. How did he react to air plane
  altitudes?"</p>

  <p>"Splendid. At high altitudes he grew almost talkative."</p>

  <p>"To you?"</p>

  <p>"No. I didn't crowd him. I let him talk to any one he pleased. I haven't
  asked him a question beyond is he feeling better, or how about a clean shirt
  or a stick of chewing-gum. I'm not trouble, I'm the lad who pulls him out of
  it and doesn't give a damn why."</p>

  <p>"All right. Well, I'll go upstairs and see him. If you'll dine with me,
  I'll meet you at the Service Club at nine; I'll be there waiting for
  you."</p>

  <p>"I haven't a dress suit."</p>

  <p>"Very well, meet me at Logan's&mdash;know where that is?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. I'll like the grub at Logan's better. Club grub dulls my intuition.
  It's all right when you've nothing important to do. Could I have a slip of
  paper?"</p>

  <p>Tom wrote a short note, sealed it in a plain envelope and addressed it to
  himself at Ingleby's Hotel.</p>

  <p class="letter">Memo. Dine to-night at Logan's 9 P.M. Cancel other
  engagement by phone.<br>
  Memo. Buy some American chewing-gum.</p>

  <p>He almost never made written memoranda. He didn't have to; he had trained
  his memory. But he gave the envelope and a coin to a filthy-looking Punjabi,
  who was loafing in front of the hospital. The man offered his services with
  rather noticeable persistence. He was possibly a spy. Anyhow, Tom hoped so.
  He told him to deliver the message at Ingleby's Hotel, and watched him for
  half a block, until he was quite sure he was being followed by a much
  better-dressed Punjabi Moslem. That settled it. Tom took a taxi in the
  opposite direction, made sure that he wasn't being followed by another taxi,
  and then drove to one of the new administration buildings, where he had some
  difficulty in finding the Ethnographic Office. When he found it at last, at
  the end of an upstairs passage, he was rather guardedly welcomed by Norman
  Johnson, a man in spectacles, bulky, morose and used to being treated with
  more deference than Tom betrayed.</p>

  <p>"Professor Clarence Mayor of the British Museum suggested I should call on
  you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes?" He didn't even invite Tom to be seated. The room was lined with
  evidently much-consulted books. The desk was piled with papers. There was an
  atmosphere, an emphatic suggestion of too much work to be done and too little
  time in which to do it. "What does Mayor want? I have a whole file of his
  letters. He always wants something that he could dig up for himself in the
  Museum if he had the patience. What is it this time?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing that he told me."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you the man who entered Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"I have been in Tibet."</p>

  <p>"Well, I must say it surprises me that Mayor should send you to me. He
  knows perfectly well it's forbidden to do what you did. Does he think I'm
  going to help you to repeat the offense?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what he thinks, and I'm damned if I care," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you any other introduction?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Know any one at the Foreign Office?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Remaining long in Delhi?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going from here?"</p>

  <p>"Darjeeling."</p>

  <p>"I may perhaps meet you there. I should be there now, but there was too
  much work to be done here first."</p>

  <p>"Mail or messages will reach me at the Hindu Kush Hotel in Darjeeling,"
  said Tom.</p>

  <p>"And in Delhi?"</p>

  <p>"Ingleby's. I see you're busy. I'll be off."</p>

  <p>"Good of you. Yes, I am busy. I will look forward to a conversation with
  you in Darjeeling."</p>

  <p>So much for him. Tom chuckled as he walked out. He didn't expect to be
  kissed on both cheeks and told what to do. One very famous explorer,
  officially forbidden to enter Tibet, cooled his heels for months, continually
  applying for permission and continually rebuffed, until at last he waked up
  and discovered that a road had been made all clear for him. All he had to do
  was to pretend he had slipped across the Tibetan border without the Indian
  Government's knowledge. No competent secret service has any sympathy for
  stupidity; and no successful government does openly what is better done
  left-handed in the dark.</p>

  <p>Tom drove to Ingleby's Hotel, registered and ordered his bag brought from
  the station. There was no self-addressed message. Good. Pretty stupid of some
  one. A really smart man would have opened it, read it, sealed it up again and
  sent it on its way. He took a shower in his room and went down to the broad
  veranda that faced the street and a row of good green trees. It was already
  late afternoon. About a dozen people were using the long chairs, drinking.
  They all stared and immediately lost interest. Tom took a chair at the far
  end. He ordered ginger-ale&mdash;hated the stuff, but you have to order
  something; it was too hot for tea. He sat still, frowning, doing nothing,
  mentally reviewing the day's conversations and wondering about Elsa. He was a
  bit worried about her. But his frown relaxed when a box-wallah spotted him
  and patiently worked his way along the veranda, offering cheap jewelry and
  similar rubbish for sale. Because he expected just that, Tom spotted the
  legerdermain with which the fellow added a small box of spearmint
  chewing-gum. As he drew near he placed it in full view on the top tray.</p>

  <p>"Melikani tschooin-gum, sahib? <i>Bohut atcha</i>&mdash;new-fresh-jus'
  arrive by steamer&mdash;same as sell in New York, Paris,
  London&mdash;original package&mdash;good&mdash;cheap&mdash;guaranteed."</p>

  <p>Tom bought his entire stock of the stuff. It didn't seem to have been
  tampered with. There was no evidence of the wrappers having been disturbed. A
  moment later he silently cursed himself and laid the box on the floor at his
  left hand. A very pleasant-looking missionary woman in the next chair on his
  right leaned toward him and spoke:</p>

  <p>"If I had seen the chewing-gum, I would have bought some. Do you want it
  all? May I buy some from you?"</p>

  <p>Well, he couldn't tell her he suspected it was poisoned. He couldn't let
  her go ahead and take a chance and chew the stuff.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he answered. "It's for a sick friend. Promised him." Pretty lame
  excuse, that. Better touch it up a bit. "I'm going for a stroll," he added.
  "If you like, I'll get some for you. Would you like a whole box?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, please don't trouble. It was just a passing fancy. I haven't
  dared to eat any Indian sweets since I was poisoned in Darjeeling."</p>

  <p>She met Tom's gaze steadily. Gray-eyed, gray-haired. Jolly-looking woman,
  with a good grim trouble-eating lip line. Good ears. Scarred knuckles.
  Carried her head right. Licked a whale of a lot of bad grief in her day. Damn
  her, why didn't she break ice? Suddenly she did it, quite naturally:</p>

  <p>"Are you Mr. Tom Grayne? Some one we both know phoned a few minutes ago to
  say you're going to Darjeeling. So am I&mdash;to-morrow morning. Do you know
  Darjeeling? Perhaps I can be of some use to you there. I keep a school for
  Hill children."</p>

  <p>She didn't mention Ethnological growling Johnson's name, so he'd be damned
  if he would. How could he check up?</p>

  <p>"Do you know Mu-ni Gam-po?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We're great friends."</p>

  <p>"Give him my kind regards."</p>

  <p>"Would you care to meet him at my house?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>Tom hesitated, although he didn't appear to. The unlikeliest people are on
  the inside. Equally unlikely people are among the mischief-makers and merely
  curious who imagine themselves on the inside.</p>

  <p>"I'd enjoy meeting Mu-ni Gam-po anywhere," he answered.</p>

  <p>"I am Nancy Strong," she said. "Does that mean anything?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He wondered why he hadn't guessed it. But a man can't remember everything.
  He should, but he doesn't; a brain doesn't work that way. He had heard of her
  scores of times, from scores of people. Even her Christian enemies spoke of
  her with respectful appreciation. Tom remembered a district judge remarking
  that the more he hated her the more he liked her. Funny&mdash;he had imagined
  her as a totally different type of woman; he had avoided meeting her for that
  reason. Had forgotten her for the same reason.</p>

  <p>"You will call on me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Sorry I didn't long ago."</p>

  <p>"I will look forward to it."</p>

  <p>She got up, so of course Tom did, and she walked away with an air that
  made her look as likable as one of those rather impoverished county
  gentlefolk, who, all the world over, keep the good traditions going while the
  bad ones die. Tom went into the lobby and wrote a letter to Elsa, in code
  lest Eiji Sarao should see it:</p>

  <p class="letter">Not for Mayor. Go as soon as you like to Darjeeling. Any
  good hotel will do. Soon after you get there call on Miss Nancy Strong,
  School for Hill Children. Tell her all you care to about Th&ouml;-pa-ga but show
  no interest in me. Everything progressing favorably. Better destroy this.<br>
  TOM</p>

  <p>He mailed it, stuffed his hands into his hip-pockets, and went for a
  stroll.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch08"
     name="ch08">CHAPTER 8.</a><br>
  "Said it was a shang-shang.<br>
  Then he said it was his own soul looking at him."</h2>

  <p class="first">LOGAN'S is a queer place. Its proprietor is Greek and the
  cooking Chinese. It stands at a corner where a busy street becomes a
  tributary of the Chandni Chowk and never less than thirteen nations mix into
  a stream that readily becomes a turbulent vortex. Any wind of politics can
  whip that swarm into a tantrum. In time of riot it is one of the first points
  that the armored lorries and machine-guns visit. European and American ladies
  have frequently been spat on at that corner by oriental gentlemen of
  prejudice and peculiar views.</p>

  <p>Tom Grayne, at three minutes to nine, with his hands in his pockets, was
  more alert than he looked, but he was almost not alert enough. As he crossed
  the street toward Logan's a Ford roadster whipped around the corner, driven
  by a nondescript in a dirty turban. It missed him by less than an inch. As he
  turned his head to try to recognize the driver or take the car's number, a
  second Ford, coming the same way, actually touched him as it whirled by. He
  stepped backward against a burly Sikh, who cursed him savagely, inviting a
  blow, that would have led to a fight, that would have brought the police. Tom
  knew better than to get himself into police toils.</p>

  <p>He grinned at the Sikh: "Run and tell them what you would have done if
  you'd dared!"</p>

  <p>He walked into Logan's, where Dr. Lewis was already seated at a table. He
  sat down facing him and laid the box of chewing-gum on the table.</p>

  <p>"Doped out yet what ailed that liver you were boiling?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. A very rare poison, distilled from the roots of a small plant that
  grows in Sikkim. It takes twenty or thirty roots to yield a few drops of the
  stuff. It's sure death in a couple of days&mdash;attacks the liver&mdash;and
  seems to break it down in a way that I don't understand. I'm sending some of
  it to O'Mally. He won't make much of it steeped in alcohol&mdash;or I think
  not. But he'll enjoy the poison&mdash;three drops that would kill I don't
  know how many people."</p>

  <p>Eiji Sarao entered. He nodded and smiled to Tom and took a table whence he
  could watch without turning his head. Tom spoke to Lewis:</p>

  <p>"The two sticks of gum that are lying loose on top are new ones that I
  bought half an hour ago at Catesby and Simonds. Take one."</p>

  <p>"Why? I hate the stuff."</p>

  <p>Tom insisted. He took the other loose stick, broke off the paper.and
  chewed it. Lewis followed suit. Both chewed. They ordered dinner.</p>

  <p>"After dinner, take the box," said Tom, "and have it analyzed." He
  explained why, and how he had come by the box. "Eiji Sarao," he added, "is
  having a whale of a good time watching us chew. Don't look at him. He's
  grinning to himself like a Chinese idol&mdash;cocksure funeral-to-morrow kind
  of grin. Any news at your end?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Quite a bit. A man who said he had come recently from Giang-tze,
  showing what may have been forged credentials from the Tashi Lama of all
  improbable people, came to the hospital and demanded to see Th&ouml;-pa-ga."</p>

  <p>"How did he know he was in there?"</p>

  <p>"That's the point. I asked him. He was nonplussed for a second, but
  they're quick to cover up, are those Northerners; they're not like Indians.
  An Indian only thinks he's inscrutable; whereas a trained Tibetan, is. He
  told me Th&ouml;-pa-ga has been expected for a long time, so he was on the lookout
  for him. He said that a patient who was discharged this after noon had run
  and told him. Lie, of course."</p>

  <p>"Sure. Eiji Sarao told him, that's a safe bet. Did your visitor interview
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga?"</p>

  <p>"No. Thought of letting him. Thought better of it. I said he's too ill. He
  isn't. Lungs are right enough. He'll get well at a high altitude, but he has
  been eating the wrong kind of food&mdash;such slush as this, for instance.
  Altitude and monastery grub will soon put him to rights. I didn't even tell
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga he'd had a visitor."</p>

  <p>"Good."</p>

  <p>"But he knew it."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh?"</p>

  <p>"I was sent for in a hurry. He was sitting up in bed raving. Said he'd
  seen a shang-shang, so there must be some one come from Tibet."</p>

  <p>"Any one else see it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The head nurse. Th&ouml;-pa-ga is in a small room with his bed by the
  open window. There's no fire-escape there, but the wall is easily negotiable
  by any active person. I could climb it myself. In fact, we all suspect that
  window has been used to deliver forbidden drugs to patients. There's a locked
  fly-proof screen, but the wire gauze was recently damaged by a violent
  patient who tried to commit suicide. It was repaired, but the repair was
  badly done&mdash;probably on purpose&mdash;and the fact wasn't brought to my
  attention. It is quite easy, from outside, to detach and pull outward a whole
  corner of the wire gauze. Th&ouml;-pa-ga had asked for shaving tackle and a
  mirror. The head nurse let him have them. It's usual, unless forbidden in
  special cases. She had let him have one of those nickel-framed magnifying
  mirrors that was left behind by a patient and never claimed. Safety razor.
  She had left him with the mirror against his knees, leaning back against a
  heap of pillows, with his back to the window, shaving him self. He started
  raving before she had reached the next room. She was back in the nick of time
  to see through the window what <i>she</i> said (and she may have been right)
  was a Tibetan devil-mask. But she said it was green, which hardly fits. She's
  a good, strong, level-headed woman, but she may have been too badly
  frightened to observe it accurately. Th&ouml;-pa-ga had seen it in the shaving
  mirror, magnified and probably distorted. First he said it was a shang-shang.
  Then he said it was his own soul looking at him! The nurse had to keep him
  from cutting his throat. He had the blade out of the safety razor. So she
  couldn't look out of the window; and, of course, by the time they'd sent for
  me the thing was gone. I raised particular hell, but no one who had any
  business in the yard below would admit having seen anything."</p>

  <p>Tom watched Eiji Sarao get up and go. They nodded to each other.</p>

  <p>"If I were the Indian Government," he said to Lewis, "I would run Mr. Eiji
  Sarao out of the country so fast that he'd burn the tracks."</p>

  <p>"And the evidence, too!" Lewis answered. "Understand me, I'm entirely
  ignorant of what it's all about or what the Government intends. I know
  nothing about you. Nothing. You called on me, mentioned the name of a mutual
  friend, and I'm living up to the Welsh reputation for hospitality."</p>

  <p>"Quite so."</p>

  <p>"So I'm going to introduce you, simply as an act of hospitable kindness,
  to a rajah. Have you eaten enough of this ullage? Like some dessert? More
  coffee? Let's go then. He's the Rajah of Naini Kol, which is a little bit of
  a principality tucked away in the Hills a couple of hundred miles from
  here."</p>

  <p>"I think I've heard of him. Isn't he the scientist?"</p>

  <p>"M-m-yes. He dabbles. He can afford it. His name is Dowlah, which it
  shouldn't be. He's a descendant on the female side of the famous
  Suraja-ud-Dowlah of Clive's day. Adopted or something. Anyhow, he hasn't
  inherited political ambition. He neglects his subjects, which is very
  fortunate for them; they're backward, but they're pretty decently ruled by a
  fat prime minister, who's too afraid of them to try any tyranny and too
  honest to steal; a damned rogue but a good bloke, if you understand me. He
  has his points. Dowlah has traveled a good deal, but he lives most of the
  time nowadays in Delhi. He is one of my private patients; I had to treat him
  for a nervous condition induced by too much effort to become a scientist
  without the necessary mental training."</p>

  <p>"Strange hour to call on him, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you another peculiar thing. We're going to call on him without
  any one knowing but you, he and I. I'm going to leave you alone with him.
  Come and see me in the morning at the hospital and I'll let you know what
  reaction I get from this chewing-gum."</p>

  <p>They took a taxi to Lewis's club, where Lewis squandered nearly two hours
  talking to acquaintances while Tom, on a veranda chair, sat staring at the
  night. But at last Lewis borrowed a friend's auto, driven by an ex-sepoy.
  They were whirled after that through so many streets that Tom was hard put to
  it to keep his sense of direction. Obeying orders, the ex-sepoy, a Mahratta,
  doubled and redoubled on the course until there was no longer the slightest
  question of their being followed. The car stopped at last in almost total
  darkness, beneath neem trees, on the western outskirts of the city.</p>

  <p>Lewis dismissed the car. He and Tom walked to a high teak gate that opened
  in response to knocks and admitted them into a heavily scented garden. A
  fountain splashed. A path led to a front door, in a house that looked
  centuries old but recently modernized. An ancient, white-bearded attendant in
  a white smock emerged like a ghost from the shadows, greeted Lewis
  profoundly, and rang the bell.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch09"
     name="ch09">CHAPTER 9.</a><br>
  "Tee-Hee! Isn't she a lulu!"</h2>

  <p class="first">RAJAH DOWLAH of Naini Kol, to put it mildly, did not stand
  on ceremony. Some one had opened the front door by mechanical means; there
  wasn't a servant in sight as he came like a dancing master down the hall to
  greet his guests. The hall was severely furnished in the latest modern
  fashion&mdash; metal chairs&mdash;one astonishing oil painting&mdash;indirect
  light&mdash; imported travertine&mdash;a long strip of gloxinia-hued
  hand-woven carpet. There were two full-length mirrors, framed in chromium;
  the one at the end that faced the front door made the hall seem twice as long
  as it actually was, and you seemed to walk toward yourself.</p>

  <p>The Rajah was in a European dinner-jacket and canary-colored silk turban.
  He didn't walk, he pranced. He didn't smile, he giggled. He didn't hold out
  his hand, he flourished it. He didn't shake hands, he shook himself, offering
  a hand to either guest and using theirs for leverage.</p>

  <p>"Lewis, old thing, how are you? Who is your friend? Not a patient, I
  hope?"</p>

  <p>He had very intelligent eyes. Beneath an air of triviality and gush he
  seemed to have the coldly concentrated, alert attention of a gambler, in a
  game where the stakes are big and the opponents not notorious for fair
  play.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense, Lewis! No, no, I won't listen to you! You must have
  a drink and a smoke. You must stay at least until after I've shown you my
  latest!"</p>

  <p>"Perpetual motion?" asked Lewis.</p>

  <p>Dowlah giggled at Tom. "He's jealous! He's afraid they will make me an
  F.R.S.!&mdash;Lewis, you incredulous old Taffy, I have a shang-shang! Alive!
  In captivity! Come along and I'll show you."</p>

  <p>"You're a damned liar," said Lewis. "I'll look."</p>

  <p>The Rajah led the way. The library, as he called it, was as full of
  scientific instruments as books. It was a big room, lined with travertine.
  There was another full-length chromium-framed mirror, its effect spoiled by a
  cabinet that stood against it, draped with a huge embroidered silk shawl.
  There were microscopes, cameras, retorts, but none of the dirt and disorder
  that usually accompany amateur nights into physics. There were also three big
  easy chairs, a table, decanters, syphons. The Rajah offered whisky and
  cigars. Lewis accepted both, Tom neither; Tom had a way of declining, without
  excuse or apology, that left nothing to argue about. Then, suddenly:</p>

  <p>"I can't wait, Lewis! I simply must show you!"</p>

  <p>"Go ahead, Dowlah, you idiot. Show us!"</p>

  <p>Dowlah led, on excited tiptoes, toward the glass cabinet that stood in
  front of the mirror. He jerked off the silk shawl and revealed a glass case,
  six feet long, four wide, standing on a heavy teak table.</p>

  <p>"Hold your breath! Sssh-sh! Take a look! Take a look!"</p>

  <p>On the floor of the glass case was a brute like a huge green spider with a
  body as big as a quart pot, spiked like a horned toad's. Its legs were two or
  three times as long as a spider-crab's and had projecting bristles. It was
  emerald green. It had a face like a shrunken devil-mask&mdash;a blind
  malignant face. Its real eyes were on top. They were opal colored. Its
  mandibles moved continually, as if it were feeding itself on something that
  it couldn't see. There was a big, dead rat near one corner of the cage,
  caught in a network of web as thick as sewing silk, and sucked dry.</p>

  <p>"Weighs seven pounds, six ounces and a half," said Dowlah. "Angry! Mad
  angry! She's from the Hills. The heat here maddens her. But isn't she a
  beauty! Lewis, my boy, that's a genuine shang-shang. She's a young one. They
  say they grow to be twice her size. That's the beast you said doesn't exist!
  That's the killer-spider of the Himalayas that can thrive up near the snow
  line. That's the origin of half the Tibetan legends, and of nearly all the
  superstition, about murder by magic! Death? Hah! There's death for you, Lewis
  my boy! How'd you like that on a dark night! Devilish death! Painful! Worse
  than a hamadryad! If the tales are true, that creature's bite sets every
  nerve in its victim's body aflame with agony. But you can't scream. You can't
  move. You die speechless. Would you like to see her kill another rat
  now?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Lewis. "How d'you know it's a shang-shang and how did you get
  it?"</p>

  <p>Dowlah didn't answer the questions. "How would you like her loose in your
  bedroom?" he retorted. "That's her job! That's what the shamans catch 'em
  for! They're a thousand times as dangerous and difficult to catch as cobras
  or panthers. I'll show you. This brute can jump clear across the room, so
  keep out of its way! Out of <i>her</i> way! She's the female of the species.
  The male is small, dark red, non-poisonous. She invariably kills and eats
  him. However, I'll let her loose and show you what she's good for."</p>

  <p>"No, you won't," said Lewis.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. It's quite simple. If you don't get between her and where she's
  going, you'll be quite safe until after she gets there. I'll trap her all
  right. You watch. I'll show you how it's done. She has a one-track mind, like
  any other spider&mdash;always does the same thing in the same way. She's
  almost human in that respect. Stand over there by the wall."</p>

  <p>It was a very long room. On another table, against the wall at the far
  end, there was a glass case similar to the one that contained the
  shang-shang, similarly covered with a silk drape. Its hinged top was raised
  and held open by a string suspended from a pulley on the wall; it could be
  opened and shut from half a room away. Dowlah took a small stick like a
  conductor's baton, tied a wad of cloth to the end, dipped the wad in
  something in a saucer&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Warm meat extract. Blood is better. But when she's very angry warm meat
  extract does the trick."</p>

  <p>He opened a small slide at one end of the glass case and proceeded to
  irritate the shang-shang with the rag on the end of the stick. The thing's
  ferocity was horrible. It flew at the stick. It bit the rag. Its leg
  movements were so swift and powerful that it seemed to fly. The interior of
  the six-foot-long case became a whirl of something vividly green that moved
  too swiftly for the eye to follow. Dowlah removed the stick and closed the
  slide. The monstrous insect crouched itself over the slide and appeared to be
  trying to force it open.</p>

  <p>"Now!" said Dowlah. "Watch this! <i>Arichnida ferox shang-shang
  Dowlah!</i> They will hardly be so jealous as to deny it the use of my name,
  will they? I'm its discoverer. I'm the first to have a captive shang-shang
  under observation."</p>

  <p>He began to touch the floor, tables, furniture, even the books on the
  shelves, with the rag on the end of the stick. He laid a zigzag scent that
  led all over one half of the room, until he finally came to the open glass
  case, untied the rag and dropped it in. Then he removed the saucer of meat
  extract into the hall, closed the door again, locked it to prevent a servant
  from entering unannounced, switched off the two electric ceiling-fans,
  attached the end of a cord to a ring on the lid of the case, stood back ten
  feet away&mdash;pulled the cord&mdash;opened the lid.</p>

  <p>Out came the shang-shang, swiftly, with a sidewise spider movement. It
  crouched on the glass on the top of the cabinet. Seen against the mirror, in
  three dimensions, it was nauseating&mdash;an emerald horror.</p>

  <p>"God!" exclaimed Lewis.</p>

  <p>Tom Grayne noticed a bottle of cyanide on a shelf in a case behind him. It
  might be better than no weapon in a pinch.</p>

  <p>The Rajah giggled: "Tee-hee! Isn't she a lulu! Find her an adjective, Mr.
  Grayne&mdash;lulu is already antique&mdash;isn't she entitled to a new word?
  You're an American. You invent it!"</p>

  <p>"Shut up! For God's sake, watch the brute!" Lewis said irritably. "Here,
  give me that window-pole. I warn you, I'm going to swat your shang-shang if
  it heads my way."</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry. She won't. But I bet you couldn't hit her&mdash;not with
  that," said Dowlah.</p>

  <p>Lewis reached down the brass-hooked pole from the ring on the ventilator
  window up high on the wall.</p>

  <p>The shang-shang began to move again, crabwise, with its legs spread wide.
  It looked like three different things, all horrible: crab, spider, octopus.
  It moved like none of them&mdash;like all three of them&mdash;raising its
  body up and down. Suddenly it leaped to the floor, soundless&mdash;crouched
  there, swaying as if ready for a spring&mdash;then dashed in a sudden,
  absolutely silent zigzag course from point to point that had been touched by
  the rag on the end of the stick. Almost lightning speed, effortless.</p>

  <p>From the time it started it seemed less than a second before Dowlah let go
  the cord that shut the lid of the cage at the end of the room.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" Lewis leaned on the window-pole and wiped his forehead. "The
  damned thing scared me. I admit it."</p>

  <p>"Now you know," said Dowlah, "how the shamans kill a victim. First find a
  shang-shang. Where to find them is a secret that's been well kept. Next,
  catch a female. If you can do that without being killed, you're a magician!
  After that, contrive to touch your victim with something smelly that excites
  a shang-shang's anger. Blood! Human blood, if you have it. Make a trail back
  to your shang-shang. Let her go. And you've one more mysterious murder!"</p>

  <p>"Can they catch 'em again?" asked Lewis.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, but I doubt it. Mrs. Shang-shang, I imagine, makes tracks
  for the Hills. She likes high altitudes. Her natural food is mice, snakes,
  birds&mdash;and her unfortunate husband."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure she's in that case?" asked Tom Grayne. He glanced again at
  the cyanide bottle.</p>

  <p>"Yes, she's in there. I keep the sides of the case covered because she
  gets so angry if she can't hide behind some thing."</p>

  <p>"You damned fool!" exclaimed Lewis. "She isn't in there! Look! That's her
  leg! She's between the case and the wall! By God, she's coming for us!"</p>

  <p>Tom reached down the cyanide. Lewis held the window-pole like a spear.</p>

  <p>"Pretty pussy!" remarked Dowlah. "Now we have to use our guessing
  apparatus&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

  <p>Lewis exploded: "God damn! Where's your shotgun?"</p>

  <p>"Don't kill her! Man alive, don't kill her! Let's be scientific!" Dowlah
  seized the silk shawl that had covered the nearer of the two glass
  cabinets.</p>

  <p>The shang-shang moved. Another leg appeared above the cabinet. Tom set the
  cyanide bottle on a table and pulled down two drapes from the wall. He
  offered one to Lewis.</p>

  <p>"Bull-ring tactics. If she bites that she'll waste her venom."</p>

  <p>The shang-shang emerged. Its opal-colored eyes looked rotten with cancered
  malice. They shone in the electric light like iridescent evil. Suddenly the
  creature darted up the wall, zigzagged across the ceiling like a silent green
  shadow, and vanished through the ventilator window. It was hinged along the
  bottom. It had opened downward when Lewis jerked away the window-pole.</p>

  <p>"Sinners and drunkards in care of the Lord!" said Lewis. "Well, we have
  her!" He used the pole to slam the ventilator shut. "She can't get out of
  there."</p>

  <p>"Oh, can't she? I could cry," said Dowlah. He let go fathoms of profanity
  in an unknown tongue. "I hadn't even photographed her! All I have now is a
  dead rat, from which to extract poison that the analysts will say is
  something else! Oh, why am I irreligious? Why haven't I a God to blame? Oh,
  damn! You jinxes! You brace of alien intruders! There's a shaft there that
  leads to another, larger one that sticks up through the roof."</p>

  <p>"No screen on it?"</p>

  <p>"No, double-damn my magnanimity! There was one of those cowls at the top,
  that spin and suck the air up. It needed repairs. I permitted a delay of
  three days because the man who had taken the thing to his workshop had a sick
  son. That was why I kept the ventilator shut. Lewis, you calamity! I know now
  why the Welsh worship goats and are weaned on onions!"</p>

  <p>"Better send out an alarm," said Lewis. "If she gets out, she'll be
  killing some one."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes? Are you going to say you saw a shang-shang? Even now, you're
  known as Crazy Taffy. You'd be sent home and locked up."</p>

  <p>"Remember your manners," said Lewis.</p>

  <p>Dowlah threw himself into a chair and sat with his head between his hands.
  "Lewis, old thing, I would pay you, or any one else, half a lakh of rupees to
  bring that shang-shang back again alive! I'd pay a whole lakh if I had
  it."</p>

  <p>"You haven't half a lakh," said Lewis.</p>

  <p>"Can't we climb the roof?" asked Tom Grayne. "If we had a good thick bag
  that it couldn't bit through&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dowlah interrupted. "Did you see my roof? It's as steep as a
  candle-extinguisher. It was built by a Swiss, to keep our lousy Hindu gods
  from sitting on it. No. I don't mind being silly, if there's any sense in it.
  But I don't chase a runaway shang-shang. She's gone, she's gone. Dammit,
  she's gone. She can hide&mdash;kill&mdash;scoot&mdash;she will make for the
  open country&mdash;then the Hills. Whoever sees her will believe his sins
  have found him out. Snakes will get the credit for any murdering she does.
  Lewis, you unlucky omen, have another drink, and go away, and leave me alone
  with my sorrow."</p>

  <p>"I will leave you alone with Tom Grayne," Lewis answered. "Yes, I need a
  drink, please."</p>

  <p>Dowlah studied Tom Grayne. He kept glancing at him so intently that he
  poured Lewis's tumbler nearly half-full of whisky. Then the soda ran over the
  top. He handed the drink to Lewis without looking at him.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said to Tom at last, "I'd like to talk with you. You're the only
  man in the room who wasn't frightened."</p>

  <p>"Hell," Tom answered, "I was scared stiff."</p>

  "You and I are equally in danger."</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Rajah seemed to have collapsed for the time being. He
  sprawled in an arm-chair, absent-mindedly jerking at the trigger of an empty
  soda-water syphon. But he was studying Tom, and Tom knew it. There were going
  to be no preliminaries. There was a tacit assumption already that each man
  understood the other's importance. Each wanted the upper hand. There would be
  a battle of wits, and, like a dog fight, it would begin in the middle.</p>

  <p>"I've a thought," said Tom Grayne.</p>

  <p>"Drown it then in whisky. I can think of nothing but the loss of my pet.
  That isn't thought, it's emotion. All is lost save honor, which is not an
  asset."</p>

  <p>"If we should open that ventilator," Tom continued, "the brute might
  return. She might try to kill you. We could catch her." He went and opened
  the ventilator. "Have you, for instance, a big butterfly-net on a fairly long
  pole?"</p>

  <p>"She won't come back. She could bite through a muslin net. She's too quick
  to be caught. You couldn't hit her with a shotgun. Don't talk like a
  cuckoo."</p>

  <p>Dowlah took a long drink. Then he got up and locked the decanter away.</p>

  <p>"Out of sight, out of mind," he remarked. "Who is that girl who came with
  you to Delhi? I will save you the trouble of lying. Her name is Elsa Burbage.
  Who&mdash;what&mdash;why? You'd better tell me."</p>

  <p>"Why should I talk to you about a girl who happened to be on the plane?"
  Tom answered. He hadn't expected that twist. He wasn't ready for it, but he
  betrayed no embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"You and I," said Dowlah, "have to understand each other. As a doctor,
  Lewis is a regular, orthodox run-of-the-mill mediocrity. But are you such an
  ass as to suppose he brought you here to save a wench's reputation by being
  sentimentally evasive?"</p>

  <p>"Lewis didn't tell you about Elsa Burbage. Who did?"</p>

  <p>"What's she good at?" Dowlah asked him.</p>

  <p>"Can you see the whites of my eyes?" Tom retorted. "You fire first. If we
  put that saucer full of meat extract up there near the ventilator, possibly
  the shang-shang might come down to get it. If she's hungry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If she's hungry she will hunt for something she likes better than warm
  Bovril. What I hope," said Dowlah, "is that she will go and kill the shaman
  from whom my servant stole her. That would save me some emotions. My servant
  should have killed the shaman, but he didn't."</p>

  <p>"So the shaman's gunning for you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but not with a gun. I don't know why he brought the creature to
  Delhi. I do know that if he learns who stole her, my number is up. That is
  why I didn't send out an alarm. I don't want a Tibetan shang-shang tamer
  heaping blessings on me."</p>

  <p>"There may be more than one shang-shang in Delhi," said Tom. "A man named
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga is rather credibly reported to have seen one through a bedroom
  window."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that? Don't be silly. That would be a dummy on a pole. They want to
  scare Th&ouml;-pa-ga back to Tibet in a proper state of dismal-mindedness.
  Tibetans, even educated ones, believe a shang-shang not only can kill them
  but hound them in hell after death. There's a man in Delhi who has come for
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga. He owns the shaman who owned the shang-shang. He's an anonymous
  Number One, in hiding. He won't want you in the way and he doesn't love
  me&mdash;not if he's sane, he doesn't. You and I are equally in danger. But
  before I play with you I want to know more about you. Who is Elsa
  Burbage?"</p>

  <p>"You tell me," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>There was no longer the slightest trace of nonsense about Dowlah. His
  yellow turban suggested mustard-gas. His nose was an interrogation mark, his
  eyes insolent.</p>

  <p>"Very well, I will tell you. Elsa Burbage is a girl who holds her tongue
  too damned well to be innocent. Why won't she talk about you?"</p>

  <p>"Have you tried to make her do it?" Tom asked. He sounded, looked, was
  casual. There was no anger in his eyes, no particular interest. The battle
  was on.</p>

  <p>Dowlah chuckled. "You seem as close as she is! Elsa Burbage can't be
  persuaded to talk even with her big toe in a nut cracker. She wouldn't even
  yell."</p>

  <p>"If her feelings were any of my concern, you wouldn't dare to tell me
  that," said Tom. "Talk horse. Why am I here?"</p>

  <p>No embarrassment. Not a trace of it. Tom's hands were at ease, unclenched.
  His voice was level, his eyes cold. Dowlah tried another angle:</p>

  <p>"I propose to help you into Tibet, Mr. Tom Grayne. If I do that, what will
  you do for me in return?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Why should you help me, if you could get along somehow else? I'm
  necessary, or I shouldn't be here."</p>

  <p>Dowlah nodded. "Well, I'll tell you. I'm afraid of this Elsa Burbage. You
  appear trustworthy. You have been well recommended to me. But a
  girl&mdash;well, Eiji Sarao has warned me. He says he saw you two together in
  London. He says Th&ouml;-pa-ga has come more or less under her influence."</p>

  <p>Tom betrayed no surprise whatever. He understood the system. He was not
  being tested to find out how much or how little he knew, but whether or not
  he would tell what he knew.</p>

  <p>"Am I wasting time? Why am I here?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Eiji Sarao told me you intend to find the Thunder Dragon Gate and to go
  in."</p>

  <p>"Not he. Some one else told you that."</p>

  <p>"Is it true?"</p>

  <p>"Ask your informant. I don't tell my business without good reason."</p>

  <p>"Eiji Sarao says you know Noropa."</p>

  <p>"If you believe Eiji Sarao, why ask me about it?"</p>

  <p>Dowlah grinned. "Why, do you suppose, do I enjoy the confidences of a
  Japanese cotton-mill representative?"</p>

  <p>"Easy. You're the con man. Probably the Jap secret service people imagine
  you're their number one bet on the Indian board. Probably Eiji Sarao trusts
  you, to the extent that a Jap spy trusts any one. He probably believes you're
  a secret enemy of the Indian Government."</p>

  <p>"Not so bad," said Dowlah. "Now it's your turn. Who is Elsa Burbage?"</p>

  <p>"If I knew, I wouldn't tell you."</p>

  <p>"Very well then, answer this one. Th&ouml;-pa-ga needs very artful handling, if
  you hope to find the Thunder Dragon Gate. You will have to use Th&ouml;-pa-ga.
  There is no other possible way. Elsa Burbage is reported, by Eiji Sarao, who
  is a rather keen observer, to have Th&ouml;-pa-ga's confidence, more or less.
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga, he says, shows a tendency&mdash;nothing more than a tendency
  yet&mdash;to open up&mdash;almost to be in love with her. If so, she might be
  useful. It 'ud be devilish risky to use an inexperienced girl, but we could
  kill her if she made a <i>faux pas</i>. Do you think she'd tune in?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" Tom answered. "Why not ask her?"</p>

  <p>"Very well, I will," said Dowlah.</p>

  <p>He got up, and went out into the hall, leaving the door open. Tom caught a
  glimpse of him in the mirror behind the case that had contained the
  shang-shang. Saw him enter a door in the hall. Saw him govern his face as he
  came back.</p>

  <p>"She appears unconscious at the moment," he said as he closed the door
  behind him. "I suppose we rather overdid the third degree."</p>

  <p>"You're overdoing tommyrot!" Tom answered. "Bring her in."</p>

  <p>Dowlah laughed. He returned to the hall. Tom waited calmly. If Elsa had
  made any bad breaks, she had made them. If she hadn't, she hadn't. Nothing to
  be gained by getting worked up. He would know, in a minute, how she came to
  be there.</p>

  <p>But it was nearly five minutes before Dowlah returned.</p>

  <p>Elsa had hold of his arm. Tom watched them in the mirror. She walked
  beside him as if they were old friends. She was laughing at some joke he had
  made. A bit pale&mdash;a trifle wild-eyed&mdash;just a trace
  excited&mdash;but well in control of herself. She looked very small beside
  the tall, lean Dowlah.</p>

  <p>She walked at Dowlah's right. The fingers of her right hand moved like
  lightning&mdash;shorthand&mdash;almost too fast for Tom to read it. He was
  afraid Dowlah might notice it in the mirror; not that it mattered much,
  because Dowlah couldn't understand it, but he glanced at the mirror to make
  sure. He almost betrayed that he was startled. His blood ran cold. It wasn't
  so much that he saw Eiji Sarao's face peering through the partly open door,
  disturbing though that was; it might mean anything. But, peering over Eiji
  Sarao's shoulder from behind him, was Noropa&mdash;unmistakably
  Noropa&mdash;the six-foot eight-inch figure of death, who should be in an
  English prison. How the devil had Noropa reached Delhi?</p>

  <p>Only one glimpse. The Rajah turned to close the door, and Elsa's fingers
  kept on furnishing vital information. He had to watch them. She could see Tom
  in the mirror, but she pretended not to&mdash;made no sign of recognition.
  She was be having splendidly.</p>

  <p>Dowlah pretended to be trying the lock. He turned suddenly, to try to
  catch them making signals, but he couldn't see Elsa's right hand. She
  finished signaling. Tom stood up:</p>

  <p>"Well, Elsa Burbage! It hasn't taken you long to find your feet in Delhi!
  Pleased to meet you again."</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Tom. I'm less surprised than you are. You're the kind of
  man, aren't you, who turns up in all sorts of unexpected places."</p>

  <p>Dowlah looked amused. "Nothing unexpected about me," he remarked. "I'm the
  most conventional, correct and predictable man in the world. And I'm as easy
  to fool as the income-tax man."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">CHAPTER 11.</a><br>
  "But on whose side is Dowlah?"</h2>

  <p class="first">RAJAH DOWLAH resumed his mask of inconsequential inanity. He
  giggled as he pulled up an arm-chair for Elsa beneath the ceiling fan and
  arranged a huge cushion. But he was watching for signals. Tom was quite sure
  of that. Three times in less than sixty seconds he saw him glance at the
  mirror behind the empty shang-shang cage. Evidently Dowlah wanted to know too
  much and to tell too little before committing himself. It was time to unmask
  Dowlah's batteries. The weather in the passes leading toward Tibet wouldn't
  wait on Dowlah's moods.</p>

  <p>Tom went and unlocked the door without a word. He strode into the hall. He
  heard Dowlah's voice behind him:</p>

  <p>"Silly ass, he's jealous!"</p>

  <p>Then Elsa's: "Kindly take your hands off!"</p>

  <p>But almost any man can make a girl say "take your hands off!" It's
  particularly easy for an oriental to make a white woman say it. Tom didn't
  even glance backward.</p>

  <p>He tried the door on the left. It was locked, although he could hear some
  one on the far side. The second door opened readily. He walked into a
  beautiful room&mdash;apricot-hued carpet, travertine walls, indirect
  lighting&mdash;three or four exquisite Chinese vases&mdash;modern chairs and
  chaise longue. Three men: Eiji Sarao, Noropa and another.</p>

  <p>A bit of a puzzle, that third man. Tall&mdash;obese&mdash;a little round
  embroidered skullcap on a bald head&mdash;a full, shovel-shaped beard, dyed
  with henna&mdash;a fine white linen smock be neath a severely cut black
  frock-coat&mdash;long white pantaloons&mdash;Persian slippers. Vaguely he
  resembled a friar, only he lacked the fringe of hair and looked less
  insolent. He put on pince-nez to stare at Tom, but his gaze was mild,
  inoffensive, rather bovine.</p>

  <p>Eiji Sarao's eyes glittered amid leathery wrinkles. If he was startled, he
  didn't show it. He smiled, stuck his hands in his dinner-jacket pockets and
  waited for Tom to speak first. Tom didn't speak&mdash;not yet. He went
  straight up to Noropa, swiftly, as if he meant to hit him. The tall
  Mongolian, looking more than ever like a figure of death, took a short step
  back wards. He threw his left hand forward, palm outward, as if to ward off
  an expected blow. Tom seized his wrist. There was a second's spasm of
  jiu-jitsu, but Tom had expected that. Noropa's arm curled in an agonied knot
  behind his back; he could obey, or, if it pleased him, lose the use of that
  arm for ever. He surrendered, speechless.</p>

  <p>"So you know that?" said Eiji Sarao. He was still smiling; his hands were
  still in his side-pockets, with his thumbs outside. "Please tell me why you
  violate this person." He spoke as if he were asking the way or something.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you in the library," Tom answered. "Last door on the right at
  the end of the hall. Now, please. I don't want to have to knock this man
  cold, but if I have to tackle you, I'll do it. Turn to the right, then last
  door on the right&mdash;go straight in."</p>

  <p>The obese man in the pince-nez with the henna-tinted beard had got out of
  his chair. He looked now rather like a father-abbot about to bless some
  penitents.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Tom asked him.</p>

  <p>"I am the prime minister of Naini Kol."</p>

  <p>"Oh. Pardon the disturbance. Come along if you care to. Suit
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"I always do," he answered. Then he wiped his pince-nez on a white silk
  handkerchief and stood aside to signify that he preferred to walk last. That
  was all right with Tom; a fat prime minister wasn't likely to use a
  blackjack. Poison, yes, perhaps, but not an automatic. Besides, Dr. Lewis had
  been at pains to describe him; he was very likely all right.</p>

  <p>Noropa said never a word. He was nearly a head taller than Tom, and Tom
  was six feet in his socks. He had the vaguely buttery-smoky smell of a
  Tibetan, but Tom was more than ever sure he wasn't one. He had on a more or
  less European black silk suit, brand new. There was a knife under his shirt,
  held in place by his belt; he had to hold his stomach tight against the belt
  to keep the knife from slipping. No Tibetan would have done that; a Tibetan
  by nature pouches a thing in his shirt as a kangaroo carries her young. He
  permitted him self to be marched along the hall toward the library. Eiji
  Sarao opened the library door. They all entered the room in a group, Eiji
  Sarao leading, in order to signal to the Rajah, as Tom noticed in the mirror.
  The prime minister came last, closed the door, locked it, but made no
  signal.</p>

  <p>All eyes were on Tom Grayne, so it was easy for Elsa to use the fingers of
  her left hand; they moved as rapidly as a concert pianist's and not even Eiji
  Sarao saw it. By the time his glittering brown eyes had moved to see what Tom
  was looking at, Tom already had Elsa's information. Tom pushed Noropa into a
  chair, removed his long knife, tossed it on the table and then let go his
  wrist. Noropa's lips moved, but he said nothing audible; he sat chafing his
  arm. Rajah Dowlah giggled. Eiji Sarao scowled at him; he looked suddenly
  bossy, like a Japanese official ordering a tourist not to photograph a
  barrack gate.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations!" said Tom. "Good staff work! You must need Noropa pretty
  badly, though, to spirit him so quickly from a jail in London. Looks like a
  miracle."</p>

  <p>Eiji Sarao smiled. He raised his shoulders in a deprecating gesture.</p>

  <p>"I am sorrow for you," he said gently. "You are found out. You are
  American Government spy. It is better you go home."</p>

  <p>Tom's voice was equally restrained, but less silky:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Eiji Sarao, I want both your hands over your head&mdash;
  now&mdash;quickly! Up with them!"</p>

  <p>"You'd better do it, Eiji!" said the Rajah. "I don't want him killed in my
  house. Better humor him."</p>

  <p>The Japanese didn't obey, but he took his hands out of his pockets,
  probably to protect himself. He was obviously puzzled. Tom's hands were into
  his pockets before he could turn to glare at Dowlah. One hip-pocket and the
  inside jacket-pocket. Quick work. Eiji Sarao sprang away and struck very
  smartly at Tom's forearm, but he just missed paralyzing the muscle he aimed
  at. The crack of his heel on Tom's instep didn't hurt much because Tom was
  ready for that&mdash;all Japanese know that dodge, and it's quite a trick to
  counter it.</p>

  <p>Eiji Sarao's inside pocket tore. Tom had what he wanted. Eiji Sarao
  glared, straightening his jacket, ruffled, indignant, dignified, bewildered,
  savage, but still in command of his manners.</p>

  <p>"I am no longer sorrow for you. It is your fault that you shall be
  liquidated."</p>

  <p>That was a strange word for a Japanese to select. But what was more
  significant was Eiji Sarao's glare at Dowlah. He expected support,
  protection. He didn't get it. He was baffled. Tom, on the other hand, noticed
  that Dowlah was looking well pleased with the turn of events.</p>

  <p>Tom examined his find. Three documents that Eiji Sarao had not had time or
  opportunity to stow safely away. One was his own memorandum about the dinner
  engagement with Lewis, and the chewing-gum. The second was the coded message
  he had mailed to Elsa. Stolen from the mail. Not so easy to do. It meant a
  thoroughly well-organized spy-system. Tom's fingers told Elsa its contents.
  The third was a cablegram in French, from Paris, signed "Jeanne Marcel,"
  enclosed in an envelope with a Pondicherry postmark and addressed to Eiji
  Sarao in Delhi. That one he translated aloud into English: "Harley has wired
  from Moscow warning some one to tell Barley you are in charge of
  negotiations."</p>

  <p>"Some one" might be Ambleby. "Harley" was undoubtedly Sir Horace O'Mally,
  who lived and performed his miracles of doctoring in Harley Street. "Barley,"
  equally undoubtedly, was Tom Grayne. It was just the kind of message that
  gets by the censors without arousing suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Swell network," said Tom. "Moscow to London&mdash;by way of
  Finland?&mdash;phoned to Paris&mdash;cabled to Pondicherry&mdash;
  innocent-looking envelope from Pondicherry to your hotel&mdash;and you a
  perfectly innocent piece-goods salesman! Clever. You Japs are up against it,
  aren't you, what with Russia watching you as well as Great Britain and the
  British Indian Government. To use your own phrase, I am sorrow for you. Care
  to come with me to Tibet?"</p>

  <p>Eiji Sarao's expression changed. He looked maliciously amused.</p>

  <p>"You," he answered, "you are going nowhere."</p>

  <p>Tom retorted: "Well, it's pretty obvious that Dowlah is liaison man
  between Japan and certain Indian seditionists. Your dilemma is that Dowlah
  fears you'll double-cross him. Almost any one could guess that in the dark.
  He feels he has gone a bit too far. He can't afford to be caught with the
  goods."</p>

  <p>"Can any one afford that?" the prime minister asked. He was sitting like a
  bishop in an arm-chair, next to Elsa; it appeared he liked them young, small,
  with a wind-blown bob. She did look good. Her frock was obviously bought that
  afternoon in Delhi, but it suited her. The old chap's taste in women
  evidently wasn't as eccentric as his figure.</p>

  <p>"Take a seat, Mr. Sarao. You'll get tired standing," said Tom. He was
  watching Elsa's fingers. It didn't matter that the prime minister was also
  watching them; even if he could read that rapid shorthand code, it didn't
  matter. And if Eiji Sarao, as seemed possible, could read at any rate some of
  it, that didn't matter either, because his back was toward her. He sat down,
  dignified but as comfortless as a suspicious cat, on a chair near Noropa. Tom
  could look straight at him and, at the same time, watch Dowlah in the mirror.
  At the moment he didn't need any more information from Elsa, she had told him
  enough.</p>

  <p>Dowlah's face was dramatic&mdash;amused, amazed, alert&mdash;a mask of
  semi-imbecility, a bit too transparent; beneath it was almost savage
  excitement. Tom resumed the offensive. Spur-of-the-moment guesswork.
  Hammer-blows of downright statement. He was like a man in the ring, slugging
  his opponent to compel him to reveal his weakness.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Eiji Sarao, the Russian, British and Indian Governments all know what
  your game is. You're no mystery. The British Home Office allowed Noropa to
  leave England at his own expense. That's obvious. He took the plane to Paris,
  flew from there to Damascus, and made connections with a fast special plane
  that happened to be leaving for Karachi. That's equally obvious. Surely, even
  you must realize you're being watched. Do you, or does the Japanese Foreign
  Office want it known that Rajah Dowlah has been their secret agent for Lord
  knows how long?"</p>

  <p>"As for me, rather than face that, I would bump myself off," said the
  prime minister. "They would send me to the Andamans. Have you ever seen the
  Andamans? Have you heard of them? Ugh!"</p>

  <p>Tom hadn't expected support from him; he looked too bovine to be a
  conspirator. Eiji Sarao said nothing. Tom continued:</p>

  <p>"You have made some bad breaks, Mr. Eiji Sarao. In the first place you
  behaved suspiciously in London. On the journey you were too damned
  inquisitive. Here, you walked straight into a couple of my traps. You tried
  to have me poisoned with chewing-gum. You tried to have me killed in the
  street. You robbed the mail. Why are you here to-night?"</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>"All right. Hold your tongue and listen. Your grip on Rajah Dowlah is the
  old one, that all secret services use: if he doesn't obey orders, he'll be
  tipped off to his own government. That would be the end of Dowlah. Or so you
  think. But how about the end of your own rope? Your Foreign Office won't ask
  questions if you're not heard from for a while. Not official questions.
  Nothing through diplomatic channels. You're not going to be heard from. Would
  you care to come with me to Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"Say more," said Eiji Sarao. His face was a mask.</p>

  <p>"Some one has come to Delhi to take charge of Th&ouml;-pa-ga? Who is he?"</p>

  <p>Eiji Sarao's expression changed. It became vacant. He shook his head. He
  didn't know. But he overplayed it; it was clear enough that he did know.</p>

  <p>"Well, you've a minute or two to refresh your memory," said Tom. "This
  afternoon you very kindly showed Miss Burbage where to do her shopping. Why
  did you introduce her, in the back room of a clothing shop, to an alleged
  Chinese, allegedly from Turkestan, to whom, however, you spoke Japanese? And
  why did you explain to him what sympathy she feels for Th&ouml;-pa-ga, and how
  gratefully he reacts to it?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't. You are guessing," said Eiji Sarao. "No one can have told you
  such a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He shut up suddenly. It possibly had occurred to him that Elsa might have
  signaled the information.</p>

  <p>Tom glanced at Dowlah. With the corner of his eye he had detected signs
  that Dowlah wasn't as amused or confident as he wished to appear.</p>

  <p>"Tell him what you think, Dowlah."</p>

  <p>Dowlah rose nobly to the occasion. No man possibly could have looked more
  embarrassed, more silly, more incompetent to carry his end of a dilemma. He
  even pulled off his turban, ran his fingers through his black hair and wiped
  his forehead with a handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I am frightened!" he said, after several seconds. "Double-dammit and to
  hell with all this, do I pay a minister to sit still and fold hands on his
  belly? Curse you, Abdul Mirza, all this comes of listening to you! You talked
  me into it. Get me out of it! Hurry up now! Wake up! Tell him what I think
  &mdash;or what I ought to think&mdash;or, if you're worth your salary, what I
  will think!"</p>

  <p>The prime minister rose out of his chair. He was a tall man. Standing, he
  carried his big belly with dignity. He stroked his hennaed beard with both
  hands, parting it in the middle. His mildly intelligent dark eyes, behind
  ridiculous pince-nez, looked at each face in turn but dwelt longest on
  Elsa's. His little gold-embroidered skullcap, slightly awry, suggested a
  caricature of the pill-box caps that British cavalrymen used to wear for the
  delight of French cartoonists.</p>

  <p>"To discuss the modesty of my emolument, and to compare it with the nature
  of my services, seems inappropriate at this time," he began. "I think it also
  inappropriate to enter into details of an alleged&mdash;ah&mdash;foreign
  entanglement that, if it did in fact exist, would be&mdash;ah&mdash;deadlier
  to handle than a&mdash;ah&mdash;cobra. I am for simple solutions, though they
  may appear&mdash;ah&mdash;complicated."</p>

  <p>"Cut all that!" said Dowlah. "Tell us."</p>

  <p>"Fortunately Mr. Grayne wants something, which only we are willing to
  supply. I am informed that he wishes to go to Tibet for a secret purpose.
  Only we can help him. Then it follows that a basis exists,
  whereupon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You may cut that, too," said Dowlah. "This isn't my birthday. You're not
  honeying the tax-payers. Talk sense."</p>

  <p>"Sense is this," said the prime minister. "Neither Tibet nor Japan would
  welcome Mr. Grayne: Tibet simply from a habit of excluding
  visitors&mdash;Japan in order not to let the light of curiosity expose a
  beautiful intrigue."</p>

  <p>"You blimp, you talk like an unpaid radio performer," Dowlah
  interrupted.</p>

  <p>The prime minister wiped his pince-nez.</p>

  <p>"It appears to me," he said, "that we should first assure ourselves of
  secrecy, and next decide who shall accompany Mr. Grayne. If Mr. Eiji Sarao,
  or Mr. Grayne, or this extremely beautiful young lady, should betray by the
  merest accident our motives, our intentions or our&mdash;ah&mdash;secret
  affiliations&mdash;that would be a catastrophe comparable to the fate of the
  Czar of Russia."</p>

  <p>"Cut that, too!" said Dowlah. "You make me shudder. Do you understand him,
  Eiji? The fat fool means we're in a fix. I'm through. No more of this sort of
  game for me. I know the ropes; you'd ruin me by tipping me off to the
  British, if I gave you half a chance. But I won't. You and that fellow Noropa
  go with Tom Grayne to Tibet, where I hope you all get bitten by a
  shang-shang!"</p>

  <p>Abdul Mirza sat down, drooped his eyelids and appeared to lapse into a
  dream. Tom resumed the offensive, for Eiji Sarao's benefit:</p>

  <p>"Miss Burbage came here to dinner on Eiji Sarao's invitation, but at your
  suggestion, Dowlah. Why?"</p>

  <p>Dowlah didn't hesitate a second. He exploded like a petulant weakling,
  found out and blurting the truth:</p>

  <p>"Why? Damn you, because Eiji said she's with you. So she is! She and you
  are prisoners! You don't believe it? Show them, Abdul Mirza! Get up, you fat
  loafer! Go and show them!"</p>

  <p>The prime minister hove himself out of the arm-chair with a sigh. He wiped
  his pince-nez, put his feet into his slippers, walked to the door, listened,
  unlocked it, opened it wide and stepped backward. Armed men!</p>

  <p>There was no longer a light in the hall. But the light from the room shone
  on the faces of at least a dozen men&mdash;dark-skinned, turbaned,
  cummerbunded, bearded&mdash;six in the front row. There were faces behind
  them, and more heads in the shadow beyond.</p>

  <p>"Prisoners!" said Dowlah. He strode to the door, pushing Abdul Mirza back
  toward the middle of the room. Without a word of explanation or warning he
  switched out the lights.</p>

  <p>In pitch-black darkness Tom took one step sideways and five forward,
  reached Elsa's chair and groped for her hand. She could touch-read; there was
  no need for her to see his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Well done. Just what I wanted to know."</p>

  <p>"But on whose side is Dowlah?"</p>

  <p>"His own, you cuckoo!"</p>

  <p>There was a sudden cat-fight exclamation in the darkness from about the
  spot where Tom was standing when the lights went out.</p>

  <p>"Keep your hair on!" Tom signaled. Those were ten tough seconds for a girl
  who was new to the game. He could feel Elsa as taut as a violin-string.
  Something fell to the floor. Dowlah turned the lights on.</p>

  <p>Blood ran from Eiji Sarao's neck. Not much blood; the blow had missed his
  jugular. Noropa's knife lay on the floor. Noropa stood near Eiji and gaped
  like a ghost that saw a super-ghost and couldn't understand. Not even a
  Mongolian terrorist can see in total darkness. Noropa had stabbed the wrong
  man.</p>

  <p>Dowlah laughed. The armed men hadn't moved in the doorway. There was an
  altogether new, dynamic note in Dowlah's voice:</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd try that, Eiji! You fool, how dare you try to kill a man
  in my house?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't! "said Eiji.</p>

  <p>"Liar!" Dowlah answered. "<i>You</i> meant to use jiu-jitsu!"</p>

  <p>Dowlah went to a nest of drawers on a shelf and pulled out medicated
  cotton&mdash;gauze&mdash;bandages&mdash;tossed them to Eiji Sarao. Then he
  turned fiercely on Abdul Mirza. It was clear enough now that Dowlah was
  covering almost hysterical nervousness under a cloak of insolence.</p>

  <p>"You should be at Geneva, you should! When you've finished thinking up
  some resolutions, go and phone for Dr. Lewis! Care to lie down, Eiji? Very
  well then, they'll show you a bed."</p>

  <p>He gestured like a conductor coaxing woodwind through a waning tumult of
  the brass. Four men armed with sabres marched in. Two of them hustled Noropa
  pretty roughly. The other two politely led out Eiji Sarao, supporting him
  between them.</p>

  <p>Dowlah came near and stood grinning at Tom and Elsa. He had to grin for
  thirty seconds before he could speak with an air of being rather scornfully
  amused. He was only calm on the surface. There was an expression in his eyes
  that suggested almost terror. It was certainly not less than anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Don't you wish," he said, "you had a private army! I'm allowed two
  hundred and twenty-four men, but I'm supposed to keep 'em all at Naini Kol.
  I'd get hell if it were known I have a few of 'em in Delhi. However, you
  don't do badly, you two. I'll have to work up such a system of signals as you
  use&mdash;it's a dandy. Damned if I can read it."</p>

  <p>"Miss Burbage would like a drink. Can she have one?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p>Dowlah turned away to unlock the liquor cabinet. Tom's fingers
  signaled:</p>

  <p>"Admit nothing. Tell him nothing until he tells us."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">CHAPTER 12.</a><br>
  "Your chewing-gum kills rats."</h2>

  <p class="first">DOWLAH pressed a button on the wall and spoke into a
  telephone that looked like a small brass ventilator:</p>

  <p>"<i>Barraff!</i>"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Barraff</i> (Hindi): ice. ]</p>

  <p>Ice arrived on a dumb-waiter, along with syphons. He poured two drinks and
  glanced at Tom.</p>

  <p>"You?"</p>

  <p>"No thanks."</p>

  <p>Dowlah drank deep, watching Elsa sip hers. "Got me to look away, didn't
  you! Well, you're a smart pair. I admit it. Both of you shall go to Tibet. I
  don't envy you. I wouldn't go there for a fortune. Frost-bite at eighteen
  thousand feet. Holy murder stalking you at every turn of the road. Tibetans
  are jolly people. I've seen 'em flog a girl as pretty as you, Elsa Burbage,
  and then leave her naked to die of cold in the night."</p>

  <p>For about fifteen minutes he described the tortures that Tibetans and
  their neighboring semi-Chinese cousins use on foreigners.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Grayne has told me all about it," Elsa interrupted at last.</p>

  <p>"Dowlah, you're wasting time," said Tom. "If you've a card up your sleeve,
  either play it or call the game. Make up your mind to do one or the
  other."</p>

  <p>Dowlah giggled again. "I am not your nurse," he answered. "Think you're
  very clever, don't you! If you are, you'll have to prove it. Show your own
  hand."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Tom answered. "If it's my lead, lock up Eiji Sarao and loose
  Noropa."</p>

  <p>"Do you want him with you in Tibet?" Dowlah could ask a silly question
  with the earnest innocence of a really artful attorney.</p>

  <p>"No, you ass. But I'm going to have your confidence, or else your enmity,
  right now."</p>

  <p>Dowlah chuckled. He sat down on the arm of a chair and crossed his legs.
  The giggle had gone, like the moisture from the outside of a glass.</p>

  <p>"Which do you prefer?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Frankly, I don't give a damn. I'd rather buck you than count on you and
  be let down. My guess is that you're in a corner. You don't act like a man
  who can please himself what he'll do next. What use are you to me?"</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" asked Dowlah.</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. Dowlah went and unlocked it. Abdul Mirza
  entered, a bit too meek looking and benevolent to be innocent of mischief. He
  wiped his pince-nez, to get a better look at Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Lewis is here," he remarked. "He is stitching up Eiji Sarao. I have
  not told Dr. Lewis how it happened."</p>

  <p>Dowlah seemed relieved to have some one to brow-beat.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, you bag of platitudes! Listen to what this man wants."</p>

  <p>Abdul Mirza looked over the top of his pince-nez at Tom.</p>

  <p>"I think he will demand too much," he answered. "Such men usually do. What
  is it?"</p>

  <p>"I want Eiji Sarao under lock and key. Turn Noropa loose to make his own
  mistakes. Eiji Sarao won't talk, and I don't think you'll find any
  information in his wallet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not a thing, not a thing," said Abdul Mirza. "Nothing but a correctly
  visaed passport and some money."</p>

  <p>"&mdash;but to hold him incommunicado may throw the whole Japanese system
  out of gear between here and Tibet, for the time being."</p>

  <p>Dowlah nodded. Abdul Mirza readjusted his pince-nez, belched, and
  addressed a remark to the ceiling:</p>

  <p>"Naini Kol is not a resort for tourists. We had the runaway wife of a
  twenty-one gun maharajah there for two years, and no one knew it."</p>

  <p>"No one would know it now, if you weren't such a clapper-tongued ass,"
  said Dowlah. "Go on, Tom Grayne. What else?"</p>

  <p>"Any one could play it," said Tom. "It's one, two, three. Noropa is a
  fanatic, with a certain narrow intelligence, who obeys orders from high up.
  He's a Number One man's factotum. Turned loose, he'll behave like a dog that
  you can count on absolutely to betray his owner by his effort to protect him.
  He has a one-track mind, and it's a bad track. That's why some one sent him
  to London to scare Th&ouml;-pa-ga back to Tibet. That's why the British Foreign
  Office let him fly to India; they turned him loose just to see what he'd do.
  I want him locked up, talked to, and helped to escape."</p>

  <p>"Who's to talk to him?" asked Dowlah.</p>

  <p>Tom glanced at Elsa. Dowlah's eyes studied her thought fully. He
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"Noropa must be given to understand," said Tom, "that Eiji Sarao has a
  secret and tremendously important message that he absolutely must deliver to
  the personage who came from Tibet to take charge of Th&ouml;-pa-ga. Noropa wounded
  Eiji. How should he know the wound isn't serious?"</p>

  <p>"The personage from Tibet isn't, so to speak, notorious for simple-minded
  incompetence or, let us call it complacency," Abdul Mirza remarked.</p>

  <p>"Take it or leave it," Tom answered. "I have said what I want."</p>

  <p>Some one knocked on the door.</p>

  <p>Abdul Mirza seemed suddenly to wake up. He stared over the top of his
  pince-nez.</p>

  <p>"Answer the door," commanded Dowlah. "If it's Dr. Lewis, let him in."</p>

  <p>Lewis breezed in. He had the half-comical air of a physician who has
  competently dealt with a disaster that he foresaw&mdash;a sort of "well,
  boys, what next?" expression.</p>

  <p>"Grayne, your chewing-gum kills rats," he said cheerfully. Then he looked
  hard at Dowlah. "I have just taken five stitches in the neck of that
  Gurkha."</p>

  <p>"Quarrelsome people, Gurkhas," said Abdul Mirza.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and reticent," said Lewis. "He didn't tell me his name, or how it
  happened. Pour me a drink, Dowlah. Nothing serious. The Gurkha will be all
  right in a day or two. What a striking resemblance they bear to the Japs. Oh,
  by the way, your shang-shang has been celebrating her escape. There are two
  snake-bite cases, one man, one woman, miles apart, both of 'em bitten in bed
  on a roof, both paralyzed and speechless&mdash;dying, of
  course&mdash;probably dead already. Thirty or forty people swear they have
  seen the devil and at least one mosque is full of Moslems praying to be saved
  from it. A police officer saw the thing. He tried to shoot it. He described
  it as three times the size of a goat, and he's at the club now, getting drunk
  and rather tired of being laughed at."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Lewis, Miss Burbage," said Dowlah.</p>

  <p>Lewis ceased looking at her sideways. He stared.</p>

  <p>"How d'you do. Are you the lady who befriended a Tibetan named Th&ouml;-pa-ga,
  on the plane from London? He keeps asking for you."</p>

  <p>"How is he?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I think he's coming along all right. He should be fit to travel in a
  few days. If you've time, I wish you'd call and see him. New to India?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. My first visit."</p>

  <p>"Take care what you eat." Lewis glanced at Tom Grayne.</p>

  <p>"Miss Burbage tells me she'll be going to Darjeeling," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"Oh. That so? Uh-huh. Well, I'll tell you. Perhaps it would be better,
  after all, not to call on Th&ouml;-pa-ga. Drop me a line instead&mdash;to Dr.
  Morgan Lewis, Edith Cavell Hospital, and let me know when you're off. I'll
  try to get him off by the same train. I'm sure that any kindness you can show
  him will be a godsend to him. He's lonely. Not homesick. Quite the reverse.
  The poor devil doesn't want to go home."</p>

  <p>"Glad to do whatever I can," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Careful what you eat, remember!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you for the warning."</p>

  <p>"Heart all right? Can you stand high altitudes? Darjeeling, you know, is a
  great many thousand feet higher than Delhi. How's the blood-pressure? Care to
  have me test that?"</p>

  <p>Tom's fingers moved.</p>

  <p>"How awfully kind of you," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Come into the other room," said Lewis. "It'll only take a minute or
  two."</p>

  <p>Elsa uncurled her legs from the arm-chair and followed Lewis out into the
  hall.</p>

  <p>"Damn his eyes," said Dowlah. "Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief,
  Taffy came to my house and stole a girl from under both our noses! He's a
  rotten doctor, but he's good at learning more than anybody tells him."</p>

  <p>"Rot!" Tom answered. "Pretty decent of him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes?" Dowlah stared in assumed amazement. "Are you such a cuckoo as
  all that? Do you think any one but she and you will give a damn if either of
  you dies in Tibet?"</p>

  <p>Tom didn't answer. He was as curious as Dowlah, at least as curious, to
  know what Lewis and Elsa were talking about. However, Elsa would tell him
  soon enough, whereas she wouldn't tell Dowlah. He had the edge on Dowlah.</p>

  <p>Dowlah knew it; he finished his drink and poured himself another.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">CHAPTER 13.</a><br>
  "Young man, you remind me of a bomb with the fuse ignited."</h2>

  <p class="first">ABDUL MIRZA'S pudgy, but somehow competent-looking fingers
  were interlocked on his belly. He leaned back in the arm-chair, looked over
  the top of his pince-nez, coughed to call attention to himself and spoke:</p>

  <p>"It is my duty to advise Your Highness. You are what is called a
  semi-independent ruler. You are now, however, semi- so-to-speak menaced by
  three antagonistic elements&mdash;Tibetan, Japanese, British&mdash;to say
  nothing of the Indian police, who are not students of extenuating
  circumstances. As Your Highness well knows, the police and the secret
  intelligence are mutually exclusive, and to each other incomprehensible
  necessities of state. To be foul of the police is not a signal for help from
  certain quarters that I need not name. Call that semi-independence, or if it
  suits you better, call it a dilemma&mdash;a predicament&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are a sententious mule," Dowlah interrupted. "Cut the prologue."</p>

  <p>But Abdul Mirza was not to be hurried. He was conceivably talking for
  Tom's benefit; else why lecture the Rajah in Tom's presence? He
  continued:</p>

  <p>"It is true that Your Highness possesses a certain gift for
  sub-diplomatic, I might say almost subterranean intrigue. But unless the
  Japanese have changed their character within the last hour or two, they will
  presently learn that you have double-crossed them. And unless they have
  changed their religion, they will know what to do about that. Will the
  British Government protect you? Or will it moralistically make a gesture to
  the Japanese by strafing you for having done what it knew you were doing and
  what it secretly but non-committally approved? Answer me that one. As for the
  Tibetans, there is no need to remind you that the Thunder Dragon Gate is not
  a source of abstract homiletics. Nobody knows much about it except that it is
  certainly a source of fanatical ferocity controlled by B&ouml;n*-tutored Tibetan
  shamans, who will presently discover it was you who stole their
  shang-shang."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>B&ouml;n</i> (Tibetan). Generally, the oldest extant
  spiritual tradition of Tibet (see <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6n"><i>Wikipedia</i></a>.) Here, a
  syncretic religion that arose in Tibet during the 10th and 11th centuries,
  with strong shamanistic and animistic traditions. ]</p>

  <p>"I will tell them you did that," said Dowlah.</p>

  <p>"Then I fervently hope that the indescribable felicity of being Your
  Highness's prime minister may descend upon more competent shoulders. As for
  me, I shall learn what eternity is&mdash;if it is."</p>

  <p>Tom listened, but he was watching the open ventilator. One of the
  shang-shang's green legs kept appearing. Just the tip of it. A spidery
  web-spinning motion. No sign of a web. Dowlah seemed unaware of it. The prime
  minister's back was toward it. Perhaps Dowlah had lied about the cowl on the
  roof being missing. Maybe he knew the monster couldn't possibly escape.
  Perhaps he knew how to recapture it uninjured. There were some phials of
  chloroform and cans of ether on the shelf where the cyanide stood; he might
  intend to try those. The possession of a living shang-shang would be worth
  almost any risk, to a man of Dowlah's temperament.</p>

  <p>But didn't it mean that there must be more than one shang-shang in Delhi?
  Otherwise, what about the people who, according to Lewis's account, had been
  bitten to death? What about the police officer who had seen a shang-shang and
  had tried to shoot it?</p>

  <p>Abdul Mirza went on talking like a rather sleepy lecturer to a class of
  theological students:</p>

  <p>"There are reasons beyond Reason's comprehension. It is sometimes wise to
  act unreasonably, simply because all the reasonable actions will be used or
  foreseen by one's opponent. There isn't any reasonable reason for employing
  Miss Elsa Burbage. Therefore&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> didn't think of that," said Dowlah.</p>

  <p>Abdul Mirza bowed. "I thank Your Highness for the compliment. You and Mr.
  Grayne thought of that. I have only called attention to the fact that the
  thought is irrational and therefore at the moment&mdash;ah&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He perked up suddenly, glanced at Tom and then looked straight at Dowlah.
  In a surprisingly sharp voice he added:</p>

  <p>"Can't you recognize Nemesis? Cover your tracks!"</p>

  <p>Dowlah walked out of the room. Tom took the pole and closed the
  ventilator. Abdul Mirza nodded approval:</p>

  <p>"As it happens, quite unnecessary, Mr. Tom Grayne. No one could overhear
  us through that ventilator."</p>

  <p>He polished his pince-nez furiously. Tom waited. He noticed he hadn't
  slammed the ventilator tight enough. The brass latch hadn't caught in the
  socket.</p>

  <p>"Young man, you remind me of a bomb with the fuse ignited. I have seen
  one. It looked as patiently potent as you. It was dealt with by removing the
  fuse."</p>

  <p>Tom said nothing.</p>

  <p>"You are an American citizen?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"It is known that the United States State Department is very interested in
  the efforts being made by Japan to get control of China."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Tom. "I've read a lot about that in the daily papers."</p>

  <p>"If I thought you were an agent of the United States' secret service, I
  would trust you more than I could other wise," said Abdul Mirza. His manner
  more than vaguely suggested a father-confessor explaining the essential
  difference between cardinal and venial sin. He placed his finger-tips
  together and continued:</p>

  <p>"Not that American secret agents are so specially competent or reliable,
  but because I should then understand your&mdash;ah&mdash;real motive. It is
  men's motives that&mdash;ah&mdash;govern probable behaviour
  in&mdash;ah&mdash;circumstances that demand discretion. There are no
  witnesses. Tell me."</p>

  <p>Tom laughed. "Hell. I know nothing about that. But do you suppose a secret
  agent would admit he was one? My goal is the Thunder Dragon Gate. I couldn't
  find it last time. If my efforts this time have any particular value to your
  intelligence department, hitch your trailer to my tow-bar. Okay with me. I've
  no secrets."</p>

  <p>"But you have a mistress?"</p>

  <p>"Me? No. Can't afford it. I have nothing to offer the kind of woman who
  could interest me. Besides, women have a way of becoming too important. A man
  can't have his cake and eat it. Liquor, tobacco and women are off the
  menu."</p>

  <p>"Why, then, did Miss Elsa Burbage, tactfully and with charming discretion,
  but nevertheless plainly admit, this evening at dinner, that her relationship
  with you is of a special nature?"</p>

  <p>"She didn't," Tom answered. "You guessed it&mdash;<i>after</i>
  dinner."</p>

  <p>"You are very clever with your signals to each other."</p>

  <p>Silence from Tom. The ventilator fell forward on its chain, wide open.
  Four of the shang-shang's legs, and then part of its hideous, blind face
  appeared. It couldn't possibly see, because its eyes were on top of its back.
  It might be listening, smelling, or using some extra sense that humans can't
  imagine.</p>

  <p>"An intelligent, competent, daring young lady is your Miss Elsa Burbage!"
  Abdul Mirza was watching Tom's face, but Tom's expression didn't make him
  glance up at the ventilator. He continued speaking, quite unconscious of the
  green monster that moved its mandibles beneath a snout like a Tibetan
  devil's.</p>

  <p>"A personage from Tibet, who has been reported to me to be eager to talk
  with Eiji Sarao, is here in Delhi. It is probable that the personage was
  concealed, and listened, perhaps even saw Miss Burbage in the back room of a
  shop to which she was escorted by Eiji Sarao this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"He can't have learned much," Tom answered. "He is probably the Number One
  man from whom Noropa gets his orders."</p>

  <p>"Correct. And let us hope that he did not learn too much. He expects Eiji
  Sarao to tell him more."</p>

  <p>The shang-shang retreated until only the tip of one leg was visible. Abdul
  Mirza continued:</p>

  <p>"For the moment we have Eiji Sarao&mdash;ah&mdash;fortunately in disposed.
  Dr. Lewis gave him a&mdash;ah&mdash;sedative. Noropa, in another room, has
  been permitted to believe that Eiji Sarao is dying. Noropa is not afraid of
  us. He cares nothing for Eiji Sarao. He understands our predicament. He knows
  it would be inconvenient for us to hand him over to the police. Because such
  people as Noropa have been trained from early infancy to more than Jesuitical
  obedience, they dread, beyond anything that you and I can imagine, the anger
  of their master&mdash;the anger of him whom they obey. Do you follow me?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. Tell me something I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Very well then, Mr. Tom Grayne, your success or failure now depends on
  our convincing the Number One personage that Miss Elsa Burbage means nothing
  to you, but that she is indispensable to Th&ouml;-pa-ga, who otherwise will rather
  die than go to Tibet and become the so-called Keeper of the Thunder Dragon
  Gate." Abdul Mirza looked over the top of his pince-nez. "She is not your
  mistress? Not your wife? Sweetheart?"</p>

  <p>"I already told you," Tom answered. "No, she isn't."</p>

  <p>"That," Abdul Mirza remarked, "is what I mean by removing the fuse from
  the bomb."</p>

  <p>Tom kept the corner of one eye on the shang-shang.</p>

  <p>Abdul Mirza insisted: "You assure me she is not your property in any way?
  Is she free to behave as she pleases?"</p>

  <p>"Hell, yes."</p>

  <p>"Th&ouml;-pa-ga, when he returns to Tibet, will find a woman waiting for him,"
  said Abdul Mirza. "She has been well trained, by B&ouml;n magicians, who are very
  expert. She is of a tribe whose women have been accustomed for many centuries
  to discipline a number of husbands. Polyandry. The reverse of polygamy. Dual
  moral code reversed and votes for men unthinkable. The inferiority of the
  male so well established that the women beat their husbands. The women are
  the sorcerers and priestesses. This one is to control Th&ouml;-pa-ga. The
  magicians control her. Japan proposes to control them."</p>

  <p>"Yes? Well?"</p>

  <p>"Eiji Sarao, when the effect of the&mdash;ah&mdash;sedative wears off, may
  suspect that the Japanese secret service has&mdash;ah&mdash;overestimated
  the&mdash;ah&mdash;affection of Rajah Dowlah. But&mdash;Dr. Lewis has ordered
  Eiji Sarao kept quiet. We can provide for him, I assure you, a more than
  monastic retreat. It will&mdash;ah&mdash;as we will explain to
  him&mdash;preserve him from the&mdash;ah&mdash;undiplomatic attentions of the
  police who will wish to know more about some poisoned chewing-gum. Having
  made an unprovoked attack upon a guest in Rajah Dowlah's house, he is,
  moreover, in no position to make any protest that would cause police
  investigation."</p>

  <p>Tom nodded. "Sure thing. He'd be canned by his own people, right off the
  bat."</p>

  <p>"Very well then, Mr. Tom Grayne, some one has made the bright suggestion
  that if Miss Burbage should&mdash;from&mdash;ah&mdash;sheer young feminine
  excitement&mdash;compromise herself a bit with Th&ouml;-pa-ga, something might
  come of it."</p>

  <p>"For instance?"</p>

  <p>"She might be believed, if she should carry a secret message from Eiji
  Sarao."</p>

  <p>"To whom?"</p>

  <p>"To the Number One man."</p>

  <p>"Better fetch her in and ask her."</p>

  <p>"She has gone already."</p>

  <p>"Alone?"</p>

  <p>"No. Noropa took her."</p>

  <p>Tom didn't have to restrain his voice or control his eyes. The shang-shang
  gave him all the excuse he needed for using words like punches:</p>

  <p>"Don't move suddenly! You hear me? Get out of your chair quietly and
  pussy-foot for the door! The shang-shang's coming down the wall!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Allah!"</p>

  <p>"I said, move slowly!"</p>

  <p>The prime minister's slippers were off. He held his breath and tiptoed
  barefoot, with his hands high, like a man balancing himself along a wall. Tom
  picked up one of the slippers. He hurled it and hit the shang-shang at the
  same moment that Abdul Mirza jumped out of the room and slammed the door
  behind him. The slipper fell to the floor.</p>

  <p>The shang-shang spread out like a huge green crab, shot down the
  wall&mdash;pounced on the slipper&mdash;bit it&mdash;worried it&mdash;
  carried it&mdash;dropped it and fled to the end of the room. It made no
  sound. Midway up the end wall it spread itself again and crouched, dancing a
  little, like a livid green octopus, staring with huge opal eyes. Its
  mandibles moved continually. It was head downward, if that sickening blind
  mask was its head.</p>

  <p>Tom reached for the window-pole. He put the hook into the slipper and drew
  it toward him. It had been torn by the shang-shang's jaws. There was slimy
  liquid on it. There was just one chance that the brute had spilled all her
  poison&mdash;might want to creep away like a teased snake, and hide, and brew
  more. Pretty slim chance, that. But he had to do something. The monster was
  watching him. It wouldn't stay long where it was. No use trying to hit it
  with a bottle or with Noropa's knife; its eyes were on top; it could see a
  missile coming. Safer to try to catch the damned thing.</p>

  <p>He went and opened the glass cage, the one by the mirror. Keeping an eye
  on the shang-shang, he covered the cage with the shawl to make it look like a
  nice dark hiding-place. The cord that passed through a pulley to hold the lid
  open was a long one. Taking care to keep the poison off his fingers he tied
  the free end of the cord to the slipper. It was a fool's chance, but it might
  work. Probably the shang-shang hadn't any brains to speak of. Probably, as
  Dowlah had said, it always did the same thing in the same way. Question was,
  what would it do? Which same thing? Perhaps its habit was to spring at
  people. It could jump like a flash of green light, without apparent effort.
  No use waiting for it to do that.</p>

  <p>Tom threw the slipper on the end of the cord as far as it would reach. It
  fell about five feet away from the wall, directly underneath the shang-shang.
  The brute didn't move. Probably hadn't seen the slipper coming. Eyes on top,
  like a spider's that can't see a marauding wasp until it's close enough for a
  fight to the death. The worst part of the brute was its silence&mdash;that
  and its moving mandibles that seemed to be stuffing invisible food into its
  blind face. It pulsed on the tips of its long legs as if pruning itself for a
  spring off the wall.</p>

  <p>Tom drew the slipper along the floor, slowly, in short jerks. Still the
  shang-shang didn't move. He put the slipper into the cage and untied it,
  taking care to leave a scent up the side of the cage. Then he picked up the
  other slipper. Some one tried the doorknob. Dowlah's voice:</p>

  <p>"Grayne, are you in there? Are you all right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Dammit, keep out!"</p>

  <p>Tom turned the key in the door and hurled the slipper. It hit the wall
  hard, about two feet higher up than the shang-shang. The monster saw that
  one&mdash;saw it coming&mdash;wasn't there when it hit&mdash;dodged, as quick
  as light, toward the corner. Even so, it reached the floor before the slipper
  did. It climbed the table, crawled along it. Suddenly it seemed to go mad. It
  danced on the table-top. It knocked over an electric lamp. Then it got under
  the table and hung head-downward.</p>

  <p>That was a chance. Heavy drapes, then chloroform. Tom reached for a drape.
  As if the shang-shang knew what he intended, it crept out on the far side of
  the table, four legs on top, four underneath, mandible-end
  upward&mdash;angry. Tom picked up a book and threw that. The brute saw it
  coming and leaped to the floor, exactly on the trail of the slipper. It had
  followed the trail and was into the cage in less than the time between two
  heartbeats. It savaged the slipper instantly. The lid thudded shut. Tom went
  and shot the brass bolts home. Then he arranged the covering shawl neatly,
  shoved one hand in his pocket and went and opened the door.</p>

  <p>Dowlah stared at him: "The shang-shang?"</p>

  <p>"In the cage. Where's Elsa?"</p>

  <p>"Elsa Burbage? What do you care?" Dowlah answered. "For the shang-shang, I
  congratulate you in the name of Science, my immortal mistress." He went and
  peeped into the cage. "You pretty, precious pussy! Tweet-tweet!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">CHAPTER 14.</a><br>
  "Tum-Glain! Tum-Glain!"</h2>

  <p class="first">DOWLAH went and picked up the lamp that the shang-shang had
  knocked over. He rearranged a number of other objects, lit a cigarette and
  smiled reflectively.</p>

  <p>"You are a wonderful fellow," he remarked. "I believe I'd trust you if I
  held a pledge from you of some sort."</p>

  <p>"No witnesses," said Tom. "It's getting late. Talk turkey."</p>

  <p>Dowlah took a mock-poetic pose.</p>

  <p>"Science!" he remarked. "My immortal mistress Science! My only love! My
  muse! She takes nothing for granted&mdash;searches all things; questions all
  things. Each of us is a potential danger to all the others. One little
  blunder, and whoopsy-daisy!&mdash;all sorts of plain and fancy
  combustibles&mdash;two or three million volts of malice&mdash;a short
  circuit&mdash;whoopee! Whoever caused the short circuit would burn, and bad
  luck to him! But then what? When the moralists discover what their
  governments are doing, governments have to go to war to prove how virtuous
  they are. Tell me now: what have you discovered so far?"</p>

  <p>"That you're afraid," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>Dowlah giggled, like a woman being tempted to betray her something less
  than irreproachable virtue.</p>

  <p>"Do be seated, Grayne. Standing, you give me an inferiority complex.
  That's better. Have you ever considered the appalling fact, that of a
  thousand volunteers for secret sub-diplomacy, very rarely one is found fit
  for the work?"</p>

  <p>"No," Tom answered. "Sub-diplomats don't come applying to me for a
  job."</p>

  <p>"Of any thousand," said Dowlah, "twenty-five may be fit for policemen; fit
  for regular routine duty subject to the rules. One or two if competently
  handled may be fit for rather ticklish situations; such men as Eiji Sarao,
  for in stance&mdash;not really clever. Seldom one, and never more than one,
  in any thousand who begin by being spies, is fit to be trusted to understand
  what he's doing. How long have you been in the secret service?"</p>

  <p>"Never was," said Tom. "My subject's Tibet."</p>

  <p>"Would you care to come with me to Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"If I thought you were really going there," said Tom, "I'd think that
  over."</p>

  <p>"Well, if I were really going, I might make you an offer. You speak
  Tibetan?"</p>

  <p>"Fat chance I should have in Tibet, if I couldn't."</p>

  <p>"What strange things men study!" Dowlah remarked. "Except for my
  scientific researches, which I am frequently assured are puerile and
  undisciplined, I have studied very little. I was sent to the usual school for
  princes' sons. We were taught the three princely virtues: mediocrity,
  hypocrisy and cricket. I was good at the first two. Common sense was an
  extra, but nobody took that. Tibetan was not in the curriculum."</p>

  <p>He glanced at the shang-shang cage, got up and crossed the room to change
  the angle of an electric-fan, so that it would blow on the cage and cool the
  monster inside it. When he sat down again he glanced at the shelves of books,
  as if wondering what to say next.</p>

  <p>"Well, good night," said Tom. "I see we're getting no where. I'll go to
  the hotel and turn in."</p>

  <p>Dowlah betrayed an almost imperceptible flutter of annoyance.</p>

  <p>"No, don't go yet. I expect an interesting visitor."</p>

  <p>"At this hour?"</p>

  <p>"Time means nothing to him. Did you ever hear of the Most Reverend and
  Holy Lobsang Pun?"</p>

  <p>Tom almost betrayed excitement. "No," he answered.</p>

  <p>"He is the Tashi Lama's confidential representative."</p>

  <p>Dowlah was watching Tom's face, but apparently he detected nothing to
  suggest that Tom was more than politely interested.</p>

  <p>"Lobsang Pun," he continued, "is probably in Delhi to persuade our
  Government to help the Tashi Lama to return to Tibet. Since the Dalai Lama
  died in Lhasa there's been a slowly developing chance for the Tashi Lama to
  return and seize control."</p>

  <p>Dowlah appeared to be talking to kill time. He looked as if he were
  thinking of something else while he made conversation.</p>

  <p>"Strange system of government, isn't it," he continued. "But it couldn't
  be worse than ours, so perhaps it's better. Dalai Lama in Lhasa, in charge of
  civil affairs. Tashi Lama, at Tashi-lunpo, in charge of spiritual law and
  order. Theoretically equals. Both of 'em moralists. Actually as chummy as a
  couple of bobcats in a cage with one bird between 'em."</p>

  <p>"That's the fault of their subordinates," said Tom. "As a general rule, it
  isn't the men at the top who make trouble. It's the men who want to be on
  top."</p>

  <p>Dowlah nodded. "Yes," he said, "the man who wants to see his master cock
  of all the dunghills is a menace. And what a way to choose a successor when
  one of 'em dies! I daresay it's as good as our way, if you don't mind poison
  as a political argument. It's logical enough to have the Tashi Lama
  superintend the selection of a dead Dalai Lama's successor&mdash;and the
  Dalai Lama, in turn, do the same thing when a Tashi Lama dies. But what
  actually happens? A committee gets itself appointed to go hunting, at public
  expense, all over Tibet, for a child who was born at the hour of the late
  lamented ruler's death. Eventually they find one with certain birth-marks.
  Those and his horoscope are supposed to prove he's a reincarnation of the
  deceased. That's as good as any plebiscite. Perhaps it's better. But again,
  what happens? A Council of Regents gets itself appointed to educate the
  child, and to govern in the child's name, until his eighteenth year. So, if
  they poison him before he's eighteen, that gives 'em another eighteen years
  of power. And, of course, the followers of the surviving Lama scheme like
  devils to control the Board of Regents. Lobsang Pun would like that job. You
  know, they haven't chosen the child yet. They said they had. The political
  gang in Lhasa tried to rush proceedings before the Tashi Lama could return
  from exile. But he started from Peking the moment he heard the news. He made
  a prodigious forced march to the Tibetan border. Some say he used a Chinese
  airplane. Some say camels. Anyhow, there he is, on the eastern border of
  Tibet. They won't let him enter Tibet, but without him they can't legally
  select a new Dalai Lama. Stalemate, unless Lobsang Pun can move a hidden
  piece or two."</p>

  <p>"Do you know him well?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p>Dowlah avoided the question. "Lobsang Pun," he said, "is a picturesque
  prelate with a string of astonishing titles half a yard long. He has a
  reputation for severity. No vices. He imposes floggings on sinners who use
  tobacco, and on ladies who are scandalously indiscreet. He has
  traveled&mdash;widely. And he has been through the Tibetan self-denial
  mill&mdash;frightful austerities&mdash;said to have lived somewhere near Mt.
  Everest, at an altitude of seventeen thousand feet or so, immured in a cave,
  naked in all weathers and fed on five grains of parched barley a
  day&mdash;for two years&mdash;until he was sent for by the Tashi Lama. Some
  say he did it to convince the Tashi Lama of his iron will. Those fellows
  believe in more than theory. They like their secret diplomatic agents to be
  practically tested first, before they trust them. Even so, they sometimes
  pick a wrong 'un. Lobsang Pun is as right as a shang-shang, if you get my
  meaning. When he comes, don't talk Tibetan."</p>

  <p>Tom's eyes smiled. Dowlah noticed it.</p>

  <p>"Lobsang Pun knows English none too perfectly. Stick to English and
  perhaps he'll slip up."</p>

  <p>"All right."</p>

  <p>"Have a drink on that," said Dowlah.</p>

  <p>"No thanks."</p>

  <p>They were silent for several minutes before a knock at the door announced
  the visitor. Abdul Mirza bowed him alone into the room, said nothing, retired
  and closed the door. Dowlah got up and stood with his back to the shang-shang
  cage. Tom stood, smiling. All three bowed simultaneously. The Most Reverend
  and Holy Lama Lobsang Pun murmured his blessing.</p>

  <p>He was even more astonishing than when Tom last saw him. He had been fat
  then, but he had grown fatter. If he was recently from Tibet, it was amazing
  that he shouldn't have lost weight on the exhausting journey. A big drum
  belly bulged above his girdle. An unruly thatch of black hair. A black toga.
  Black robe. A jade rosary, each bead carved to resemble a human skull. A nose
  like an owl's beak, protruding between cheeks that looked as if he were
  puffing them out on purpose. High cheek-bones. Twinkling, deep-sunk,
  humorous, malicious black eyes. Pretty nearly six feet of him.</p>

  <p>He didn't appear to suffer from the heat. If it was true that he had once
  lived immured in a cave near Mt. Everest (and it might be true), then
  perhaps, too, he had partly learned the hermits' mysterious art of enduring
  extremes of temperature. He had certainly recovered from the effects of the
  alleged diet of five grains of barley a day.</p>

  <p>He had a grand voice. He and Dowlah, going through the ritual of polite
  question and answer about each other's health, sounded like priest and
  acolyte intoning a litany. Not a phrase was omitted, to the last, almost
  physically embracing:</p>

  <p>"Your Highness's happiness?"</p>

  <p>And Dowlah's: "That is crowned and rendered deathless by Your Eminence's
  visit."</p>

  <p>During the entire ritual Lobsang Pun was watching Tom's face in the mirror
  behind Dowlah. He chose a chair from which he could continue that espionage.
  But he pretended not to recognize Tom until the Rajah formally introduced
  him. Tom winked.</p>

  <p>Instantly, the Lama's features broke into an ivory-leathery torment of
  grinning wrinkles. He opened a mouth from which half the teeth were missing
  and roared with laughter that shook his big belly. He seized Tom's hands and
  shook them as if they were prayer pumps.</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain! Tum-Glain! Oo-ha-ha-hah!&mdash;Player efficacious! 'Leven
  hunderd monks all playing that the snow not overtaking you! I ordering it.
  Oo-ha-ha-hah!"</p>

  <p>Tom returned the laugh. It was a thoroughly Tibetan joke.</p>

  <p>"Your Eminence's confidence in prayer almost persuades me to become a
  Tantric Buddhist! You expelled me, as I don't doubt you remember, just a few
  days ahead of the winter blizzards. At the time I thought you
  cruel&mdash;even homicidal, but I see I was mistaken."</p>

  <p>"Oo-ha-ha-ha-hah!"</p>

  <p>The Most Reverend and Holy Lobsang Pun hadn't had such a laugh since the
  news of the late lamented Dalai Lama's death. Even so, there was a hint of
  gales of laughter in reserve. He might be saving those for the day when the
  Tashi Lama should return across the border and become the ruler of Tibet
  without any rival at all.</p>

  <p>He let go Tom's hands at last and leaned back in the chair, studying him
  intently, lowering his eyebrows, pouting judicious lips.</p>

  <p>Dowlah watched both of them, visibly puzzled. He appeared slightly
  nervous. He interrupted the tense silence:</p>

  <p>"Somebody has told His Eminence that you, Tom Grayne, were Th&ouml;-pa-ga's
  protector in London. That your influence in certain quarters preserved
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga from prison. That at great self-sacrifice you brought him to India,
  neglecting your own interests. And that here in Delhi you lodged him in a
  safe place where his enemies couldn't get at him. Is that an
  exaggeration?"</p>

  <p>"It is," Tom answered. "His Eminence is a man of vast experience. He'll
  believe we're lying to him if we yes each other."</p>

  <p>"Oo-ha-ha-ha-hah! Th&ouml;-pa-ga having many enemies," said Lobsang Pun. "You
  his friend, you Tum-Glain?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think he trusts me."</p>

  <p>Suddenly again the Lama burst into roars of laughter.</p>

  <p>"Player efficacious. Oh, yes! Ah-ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>He nodded to Dowlah. Enough. The interview was at an end. He was used to
  terminating interviews. He scrooged himself up from the arm-chair, became
  solemn, flicked like lightning about twenty or thirty beads of his rosary,
  bestowed his blessing and began to stride toward the door&mdash;long strides,
  taken slowly, to permit the proper courteous expressions of regret that he
  should take away the splendor of his presence.</p>

  <p>Dowlah followed him into the hall, shutting the library door with a slam
  that flatly told Tom to remain in the room. There was quite a bit of noise in
  the hall, but through the thick door it was impossible to guess what caused
  it. It might be the commotion of departing guests. All was quiet when Dowlah
  returned after fifteen or twenty minutes. He looked excited.</p>

  <p>"That's the Number One man," he remarked. "That's the fellow who showed
  the Japanese what they can do in Tibet. Money couldn't buy him. But a chance
  to make his nominal master, the Tashi Lama, sole ruler of Tibet would justify
  him, in his own opinion, for setting all the nations of the world at one
  another's throats. He would know how to go about it, too, the old devil. I
  like him, and I wish he liked me. Grayne, you surprised me. You lied with
  artistic calm. I didn't guess you knew him. You behaved a lot better than I'd
  have done. By God, if he had ever kicked me out to perish in the snow, and
  had the impudence to pray for me on top of that, I'd have shown some
  resentment. However, it's too late to discuss that. I won't detain you any
  longer."</p>

  <p>He paused. He gave Tom a chance to question him. He went and poured
  himself another drink. He needed one, to judge by the way he swallowed it.
  Tom stood waiting, silent.</p>

  <p>"Damn you," Dowlah said at last, "you're tough. Why don't you ask about
  Elsa Burbage?"</p>

  <p>Tom laughed: "You're responsible. She's your guest."</p>

  <p>"I perceive you're a sensible man," said Dowlah. "Nowadays it's no one's
  business what a young woman is doing at 4 A.M."</p>

  <p>"As late as that, is it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Lewis doesn't usually turn up at the hospital much before nine in
  the morning. But the doctor who should be on duty was taken ill, so Lewis is
  on the job. You'll find a taxi at the front gate."</p>

  <p>"Okay. Good night."</p>

  <p>"Don't tell Lewis anything. Let him tell you."</p>

  <p>Dowlah poured himself another drink.</p>

  <p>A dark-skinned, bearded servant, whom Tom hadn't seen before, accompanied
  him to the front gate. There was a decrepit taxi waiting there. Its driver
  was a Sikh, three good sheets to the wind and sleepy. He didn't know how to
  find the hospital. So it was nearly 5 A.M. when Tom walked into Lewis's
  office and found him irritably adjusting an electric light for the microscope
  on his desk. Lewis looked tired out and bad tempered. On the desk was Elsa's
  small white hand kerchief embroidered with a blue goose on the wing&mdash;one
  of a dozen that Tom had bought for her in London from a man who had no legs
  and did that kind of thing for a living. There was no possibility of it not
  being her handkerchief. Lewis slipped it into a drawer, after he was sure Tom
  had seen it.</p>

  <p>"Is she here in the hospital?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p>"No, she isn't."</p>

  <p>"Let me see that."</p>

  <p>Lewis took it out of the drawer and laid it on the desk, blue goose
  upward. Tom took it, sniffed it, eyed it, stuffed it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Meaning?" Lewis asked him.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. How is Th&ouml;-pa-ga?"</p>

  <p>"Gone," said Lewis. "Damn your chewing-gum. It kills rats. But it isn't a
  metallic poison, and it doesn't show color. It may take me two or three days
  to analyze it."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh? Gone since when?"</p>

  <p>"Half an hour ago."</p>

  <p>"With your permission?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't need it," said Lewis. "No law against his going. I was
  operating&mdash;emergency accident case. Elsa Burbage came in a closed
  carriage and took him away. I was told about it through the slide in the door
  of the operating room. I couldn't leave what I was doing&mdash;bad case of
  haemorrhage."</p>

  <p>"Gone where?"</p>

  <p>"God knows. Haven't you any notion where she'd head for?"</p>

  <p>The phone rang. Lewis answered it with a smile of contemptuous
  reserve.</p>

  <p>"No," he said over the phone. "No. There isn't a snake in the world that
  makes an incision an inch long or an inch deep. No. Snake venom doesn't ever
  do that to the victim's liver."</p>

  <p>He hung up. He caught Tom studying the handkerchief again. In the corner
  below the blue goose was a small square marked with lip-stick. It meant that
  Elsa was all right and that she knew what to do next.</p>

  <p>But beneath that, done in eyebrow pencil was a broad-arrow mark, so small
  that it only covered about ten threads. That meant:</p>

  <p>"Beware of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In the opposite corner, also done with eyebrow pencil, was a row of short
  upright lines in groups, with lip-stick dots between to separate them.</p>

  <p class="note"
     style="text-align:center">

||||.|||||||||||||||.|||||||||||||||||||||||.||||||||||||.|.||||||||<br></p>

  <p>He counted them, using the light from Lewis's microscope:</p>

  <p class="note"
     style="text-align:center">4.15.23.12.1.8.<br>
  D. O. W. L. A. H.</p>

  <p>He nodded to Lewis. "Thanks," he said. "I get you."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">CHAPTER 15.</a><br>
  "What are you looking peaked about, Mr. Grayne?"</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was a railway time-table on Lewis's desk. Lewis drew
  attention to it by picking it up and tossing it down again. That looked like
  a pretty straight hint.</p>

  <p>"That blasted shang-shang," he remarked, "has left a trail all over Delhi.
  Some of my <i>confr&egrave;res</i> are deducing, from the shape of its bite, that a
  new sort of human Jack the Ripper is at large."</p>

  <p>"Maybe there's a pack of 'em loose and lighting for home," Tom
  suggested.</p>

  <p>Lewis seemed to wish to know nothing about it. He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If it weren't for an efficient censorship," he said, "there'd be a
  thousand of them in the morning paper, plus a score of Tibetans escaped from
  the observation ward! I shall have to report this poisoned chewing-gum to the
  police. If you're in Delhi, they'll interrogate you."</p>

  <p>Tom smiled. Lewis didn't. He looked worried.</p>

  <p>"Good-by," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"Good-by. Take care of yourself."</p>

  <p>"Thanks for your hospitality."</p>

  <p>Lewis merely stared. Tom held out his hand. Lewis shook it. Tom walked
  out.</p>

  <p>He refused the first and second taxi that offered themselves, got into the
  third one, drove around a bit to make sure he wasn't being followed and then
  went to the hotel. The door porter was asleep. So was the clerk behind the
  desk. He was only seen by a nondescript sweeper, who was at no pains to
  pretend not to notice him and therefore probably wasn't a spy.</p>

  <p>He bathed and packed the little zipper suit-case that contained all his
  belongings. It had been searched in his absence; even his socks had been
  unfolded and refolded differently. The stitching of the case had been
  unpicked at one corner and something&mdash;probably a sliver of split
  bamboo&mdash;had been inserted between the lining and the leather. However,
  that might not mean much. It might have been done to find out whether he was
  the sort of idiot who carries codes or any other important information in a
  zipper suit-case. Or one of Eiji Sarao's agents might have done it. If so, he
  hadn't learned much.</p>

  <p>Tom awoke the desk clerk, paid his bill and left no for warding address.
  He carried his own bag to a taxi, pitched it in and told the man to drive
  around the corner and wait for him there. Then he walked in the opposite
  direction around the block. All sorts of people up at daybreak on all sorts
  of business. A strong smell of streets being cleaned and watered. Nobody
  seemed interested in his movements. He drove to the station, fairly sure he
  hadn't been observed or followed.</p>

  <p>Typical Indian railway-station crowd. Usual din. Usual smelly droves of
  natives who had slept on the platform all night for fear of losing the
  morning train, or perhaps to save money. Notice board. No need to ask
  questions. Express train at 8 A.M. making connections for Darjeeling. Ticket.
  Reservation&mdash;lucky he was early&mdash;good seat and no trouble at
  all&mdash;didn't even have to bribe the reservation clerk. Corner table in
  the restaurant, with a full view of door and windows. Strong tea and boiled
  eggs&mdash;the best pick-me-up in the world after a sleepless night. Into a
  corner seat, in a front-end compartment, with a good view of the entire
  length of the platform, half an hour before starting time. A bit heavy-eyed
  now, but alert. No Elsa. No one who looked even remotely like her.</p>

  <p>She should be headed for Darjeeling. This was the first train she could
  have caught. True, Eiji Sarao had stolen the letter that instructed her to do
  that. But Tom had signaled the message to her in Dowlah's library when he
  recovered the letter from Eiji Sarao's pockets. Eiji Sarao might already have
  had it copied, but it wasn't likely that any one could break that code,
  without almost incredible luck, short of a couple of weeks of hard work. The
  code was based on an almost unknown Tibetan poem. Names of people and places
  would be particularly baffling for a code-breaker, however expert, because
  each syllable referred to a different syllable in a different Tibetan
  word.</p>

  <p>So it was at least a million to one that no one had under stood the
  message in time to prevent Elsa from taking Th&ouml;-pa-ga to Darjeeling.
  According to Lewis, Elsa had taken Th&ouml;-pa-ga away in a carriage. Whose
  carriage? Five minutes to go. No sign of Elsa.</p>

  <p>Four minutes before starting time came Nancy Strong, in a plain print
  frock, walking down the platform like a teacher on her way to school, making
  no fuss, followed by a string of porters who also made no fuss because they
  knew they would get exactly what was coming to them, neither more nor less.
  Nancy Strong got into a compartment midway down the train.</p>

  <p>Two minutes to go. The train already crowded, and no one yet but Nancy
  Strong whom Tom even knew by sight. Then suddenly, in a hurry, Abdul Mirza,
  in a turban and gray alpaca frock-coat. Six servants, all running and making
  a fuss. Ten or twelve porters. Two long strings of jasmine buds looped over
  Abdul Mirza's shoulders. One servant with a whole basket full of books and
  magazines. The end of Abdul Mirza's turban unavailingly employed to hide part
  of his face. No platform farewells&mdash;into the train like a shot, midway
  between Nancy Strong's and Tom's compartment, and more than sixty seconds to
  spare. Why the hurry? About two compartments-full of turbaned
  secretaries&mdash;people of that type anyhow&mdash;scrambled into the train
  after him in such a hysterical hurry that Tom couldn't even count them. They
  were either six or seven, all in one another's way.</p>

  <p>Three last-minute passengers&mdash;running&mdash;porters ahead and
  following. Conductor's whistle. Engine whistle. And away&mdash;out into
  fierce white sunshine. No Th&ouml;-pa-ga. No Elsa.</p>

  <p>Swell train. All the fancy novelties&mdash;cool air&mdash;ice water&mdash;
  glare-proof glass&mdash;a better dining-car than any pre-war king ever
  had&mdash;lots too many men to ask if you needed anything. White man's burden
  hell, it was a white man's shocking waste of other people's money,
  grudgingly, not too politely shared with the duskier gentry who were taxed to
  pay for the extravagance.</p>

  <p>That wouldn't do. Thinking that kind of tripe is what keeps a fellow from
  minding his own business. No risk of being murdered on the train in daylight.
  Tom leaned back and was fast asleep in less than two minutes.</p>

  <p>It was several hours before he awoke and strolled along the corridor. The
  door of Abdul Mirza's compartment was closed and the curtains down. Further
  down the train Nancy Strong sat by the open door of a compartment that
  contained three other people. One was an Indian lady who couldn't endure life
  very well with her feet on the floor. Nancy Strong had made room for her to
  get her feet up and looked as if she wished she hadn't. She nodded to Tom,
  got up and followed him into the corridor.</p>

  <p>"What are you looking peaked about, Mr. Grayne?"</p>

  <p>"Am I?"</p>

  <p>"How is your sick friend?"</p>

  <p>"Which one?"</p>

  <p>"The other. Not the one who wanted chewing-gum."</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>A train corridor is a perfectly safe place for confidences. Two in
  conversation can look both ways. They can't be overheard above the noise of
  the train, unless they have screech-owl tourists' voices. Nancy
  Strong&mdash;graying, forty-five or fifty years old, humorous, was inviting
  confidence. Her experienced, sensible eyes conveyed that information without
  a word said. But Tom's eyes were as intelligible as hers. She
  understood&mdash;laughed:</p>

  <p>"What a job your mother must have had! Excuse me, won't you. My business
  in life is getting suspicious youngsters to tell me their troubles."</p>

  <p>"Do I look suspicious?"</p>

  <p>"No, of course not. And you're not exactly a youngster. But you wouldn't
  tell me anything I don't know, would you?"</p>

  <p>"Probably I don't know anything you don't know," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>"Now, now. I didn't mean to insult you. Our mutual acquaintance spoke of
  you, over the phone, with such terse approval that I'm more than
  curious."</p>

  <p>"So am I," said Tom. "I listen like a hole in the ground."</p>

  <p>"My informant said something about a girl."</p>

  <p>Tom froze.</p>

  <p>Matter-of-factly, Nancy Strong applied the necessary heat to thaw him.</p>

  <p>"India is a wonderful country for a girl who isn't cursed with too good
  looks, or too much money, or too many brains. She can find a satisfactory
  husband in almost any place she visits, if she is properly introduced. But
  without the proper introduction, India is almost the worst country to come
  to. And for a girl who hasn't introductions, but who has more than normal
  intelligence, it's the most dangerous country on earth."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

  <p>"Because I know it. A really bright girl's curiosity will lead her into
  danger that she hasn't the experience to deal with. At the same time, it will
  keep her away from the good, kind, stupid people who don't ever know that
  such dangers exist, because their lives are too humdrum."</p>

  <p>"Your life humdrum?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p>"I am neither good, kind nor stupid," she answered. "If I were good, those
  little devils of Hill children wouldn't like me. If I were kind, the Almighty
  would give me a villa at Nice, with nothing more cruel to do than cut the
  flowers in the garden. And if I were stupid, I shouldn't be talking to
  you."</p>

  <p>"I'm all alone, up forward," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"Very well."</p>

  <p>They went and sat facing each other in Tom's compartment, silent for about
  five minutes, just as if they were old friends, with the wheels beneath them
  thumping a monotonous refrain that suggested, as train wheels always do
  suggest, that life rolls onward as a river, torn by the rocks that it leaves
  behind, and healed by distance. Tom spoke first:</p>

  <p>"So they've passed the ball to you, have they?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "I think it's your ball. But I can tell you what no one
  else will. I am unofficial. Nothing whatever that I say has the slightest
  authority. I'm a gossip. If you should quote me, you would be quoting a
  garrulous, middle-aged spinster who was a victim of her own romantic
  imagination."</p>

  <p>"Shoot," said Tom. "I get you."</p>

  <p>"Don't shoot me, if I say a few things that you won't like."</p>

  <p>"Say what you please," he answered. "I'll listen. I won't quote you. I
  won't ask questions. But I won't answer 'em either, unless I see fit."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Yes, I think we understand each other. Well, by way of
  gossip, I learned of your bringing Th&ouml;-pa-ga to India. Curiously enough, my
  advice was asked about it. I suggested Mu-ni Gam-po in Darjeeling. My advice
  was asked because it happens that Th&ouml;-pa-ga was lodged in my house in
  Darjeeling for several weeks, some years ago, when he was on his way to
  Oxford for an English education. Would you believe I have lived in
  Tibet?"</p>

  <p>Tom stared. "Tell what you care to," he said. "I won't ask."</p>

  <p>"And you won't quote me?"</p>

  <p>"All right. No. I promise."</p>

  <p>He was studying her skin. Any woman nowadays can buy almost any complexion
  except the kind you have to go and fight for on frozen and dust-laden
  plateaux, sixteen thousand feet or so above sea level. He had noticed it when
  he first met her. Funny he hadn't recognized it. Reasonable, though. In all
  history there haven't been half a dozen white women in Tibet.</p>

  <p>"Th&ouml;-pa-ga," she said, "was a rather precocious boy suffering from a
  severe case of persecution complex. Has he recovered from it?"</p>

  <p>"Not to speak of. He's as superstitious as a Kokonor yak-herd. But they
  gave him a B.A. degree at Oxford."</p>

  <p>"He was very suspicious of me," said Nancy Strong. "To ease his
  homesickness I had made the mistake of talking only Tibetan to him. The poor
  young persecuted runaway&mdash;for that is what he actually
  was&mdash;associated me, because I was a woman speaking Tibetan, with a woman
  they were going to make him marry if they could ever force him to return. At
  the end of four weeks, when at last I understood that, I began to disillusion
  him about me. But by the time I had found the one femininely friendly angle
  from which he could be reached, the money had come and he had to resume his
  journey toward Europe."</p>

  <p>She paused, but Tom made no comment. So she shot a question at him:</p>

  <p>"Have you brought Miss Burbage with you to exploit that femininely
  friendly angle?"</p>

  <p>Tom wasn't to be caught off-guard as easily as that. He answered matter of
  factly:</p>

  <p>"So far as I know, they met for the first time on the plane from London to
  Karachi. Th&ouml;-pa-ga appears to like her."</p>

  <p>"Does she like him?"</p>

  <p>"Honest to God, I don't know," he answered.</p>

  <p>"But she loves you?"</p>

  <p>"What makes you ask that?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind why I ask. Tell me."</p>

  <p>"How should I know? Why should she? Elsa Burbage is a girl with unusual
  gifts, who has had a very unusual education and opportunities. So far as I
  know, she is not in love with any one."</p>

  <p>"But you love her?"</p>

  <p>"Never been in love in my life," Tom answered. "Don't know what it feels
  like."</p>

  <p>"Well, of course, you realize, don't you, that such a person as you are,
  can't bring an unusual girl to India without arousing comment."</p>

  <p>"I had hoped to escape that," said Tom.</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong smiled. "Mr. Grayne, one of the funniest things in life is
  the occasional disingenuousness of otherwise hard-headed, intelligent men!
  Did you really think she wouldn't be checked back to the day of her birth?
  How much money do you suppose the Indian Government spends in a month on
  cables, just for a l<i>ee</i>tle more information than is written on the face
  of a passport? Even I, a mere gossip, know this much: Elsa Burbage is a niece
  of Dr. Clarence Mayor of the British Museum, where she has had the run of the
  oriental department. Her father, Colonel of a Fusilier regiment, was killed
  in action in 1917. Her mother, an ex-actress of considerable reputation in
  her day, died in 1929, of heart-failure following an attempt to climb the
  Matterhorn. Elsa Burbage has an inherited income of eight hundred pounds a
  year; an honor degree from London University; a junior teacher's certificate
  for oriental languages and oriental art; a good seat in a saddle; a little
  house in Dorking rented to a friend; dark hair; very beautiful eyes; a
  slightly pert nose; a ready laugh; a quiet conversational voice; and she
  sings high soprano. I have never seen her, and never heard of her until
  yesterday. Now what?"</p>

  <p>"You tell me," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>"I intend to tell you."</p>

  <p>"Let me order tea first. Fruit&mdash;crackers&mdash;jam? I'll have some
  with you."</p>

  <p>He rang the service bell. He needed an interruption. So far as he knew, he
  hadn't betrayed what he felt. But he was feeling rather as if some one had
  suddenly punched him in the wind.</p>

  <p>He gave the order to the waiter.</p>

  <p>"So they know all that, do they?" he asked when the waiter had gone.</p>

  <p>"They know a lot more than that," said Nancy Strong.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">CHAPTER 16.</a><br>
  "I had no right to exact that promise."</h2>

  <p class="first">"I AM going to Dutch aunt you," Nancy Strong resumed when
  the waiter had removed the tea things.</p>

  <p>"Very well. I'll play Dutch nephew."</p>

  <p>"You're a man in a million, Mr. Grayne, or you wouldn't be secretly
  approved by certain people who can't afford to make mistakes."</p>

  <p>Tom smiled. "That's the formula. Praise 'em and then swat 'em! I can take
  it."</p>

  <p>"But there isn't a known exception, is there, to the rule that geniuses
  all have blind arcs, which cause them to behave like lunatics, or savages, or
  children? A genius is never stupid in his own field. But there is always a
  zone where his genius, with its natural self-confidence, invades what is to
  him a no-man's land. For instance, a poet will try farming. That is an
  extreme instance. Virgil and Horace did it. Horace's farm was stocked chiefly
  with wine and women. Virgil tells us, in beautiful language, how the bees get
  honey from carrion. They were both good poets. Bad farmers. Aren't you trying
  to make a steel tool out of honey?"</p>

  <p>Tom rested his jaw on a fist whose sinews resembled moulded bronze. He
  didn't answer. He wasn't going to until he knew the answer.</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong continued: "No one but a genius would ever have thought of
  employing a twenty-three-year-old girl as a secret accomplice on such an
  expedition as yours. It bears the genius-stamp of unexpectedness. Elsa
  Burbage must be a very competent girl, or you would never have considered
  her. She may be old enough. I was twenty-four when I went to Tibet. If I
  could stand the conditions, probably she can. I lived there,
  secretly&mdash;and it's still a rather close secret&mdash;as the mistress of
  a Tibetan nobleman. His wealth has supported my school in Darjeeling for the
  past twenty-one years."</p>

  <p>That was a staggerer. And yet, come to think of it, it wasn't. Nancy
  Strong had obviously said yes to experience. Her eyes said it. She had made
  the yes good. She had side-stepped nothing that could be tackled, and licked,
  and turned to account.</p>

  <p>"Is he still living?" Tom asked, searching memory of people he had known
  in Tibet. She might be giving him an important clue.</p>

  <p>She ignored the question.</p>

  <p>"So I know what I'm talking about, Mr. Grayne, when I say that Elsa
  Burbage isn't in safe hands."</p>

  <p>"How d'you mean&mdash;safe?"</p>

  <p>"I mean you."</p>

  <p>"She's in no kind of danger from me," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>"That, Mr. Grayne, is what I daresay you believe. Iron-man though you
  probably are, if you were secretly in love with her, you couldn't possibly
  keep your secret in the face of what she will almost certainly experience.
  That is why I asked whether you are in love with each other. Would you care
  to know why I left Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"If you choose to tell. I won't quote you."</p>

  <p>"Because my nobleman, who was in love with me, couldn't endure the
  indignities from which even he couldn't protect me. There were Chinese Ambans
  in Tibet in my day. Their malice was almost incredibly ingenious."</p>

  <p>Tom wanted to ask her whether she loved her nobleman. She knew he wanted
  to. She paused long enough to let him ask. But he could see in her eyes the
  iron answer ready. No sense in inviting a snub.</p>

  <p>She continued: "It is quite agreeable to you to be made use of by men who
  treat you as they would a weapon. They try you out, then use you, and you ask
  nothing better. You don't expect to be rescued if you get into trouble. Your
  value is that you're competent and silent. Their value to you is that they
  can let you do what you couldn't without their leave and, at least to some
  extent, without their secret help. They wouldn't turn you loose if they
  thought you might get into trouble for sentimental reasons. They wouldn't
  risk using that kind of weapon. But is she a weapon such as you are?"</p>

  <p>"Intelligence branch becoming sentimental?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p>"No. Don't be silly. And don't try to make me think you're not feeling a
  twinge of guilt. I am watching your eyes. Are you her friend?"</p>

  <p>"I like her first rate."</p>

  <p>"Somebody told me that a hospital nurse has reported that Th&ouml;-pa-ga talks,
  even in his sleep, of Elsa Burbage. That may be a slight exaggeration. But it
  seems to be a fact that she has his confidence. I gathered there must be a
  very good reason for wanting Th&ouml;-pa-ga to confide in some one.</p>

  <p>I have been asked to find out whether Elsa Burbage has in her the
  necessary steel to make it possible for her to go through with what perhaps
  may happen."</p>

  <p>"Then you know where she is?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't."</p>

  <p>Tom scowled. But he detected the ghost of an observant smile, so he
  straightened out the frown. Nancy Strong continued:</p>

  <p>"The men with whom you are dealing wouldn't send one of their own
  daughters on such an errand as you're letting Elsa Burbage undertake. In a
  way they resemble surgeons. Their sentiment ends where the operation begins.
  They trust nobody&mdash;not even one another. They can't. They mustn't. They
  must find out, but they must never be found out. They send a man or a woman
  into danger or worse as ruthlessly, and with as little compunction as a
  general who sends a platoon by night to a position from which he knows they
  can't return alive. There are all sorts of problems. They can use all kinds
  of women, from a Mata Hari to an Edith Cavell, each in her own field.",</p>

  <p>Tom smiled reproachfully. "I said I'd listen. But&mdash;well, never mind,
  we've lots of time. Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "I know you know all that. But you haven't thought what
  it probably means for Elsa Burbage. A woman, Mr. Grayne, who doesn't
  adventure off the beaten path is entitled to and usually gets conventionally
  humane and sometimes chivalrous treatment, even nowadays. But the minute she
  consciously oversteps the line, she has forfeited her feminine rights and
  privileges. She is no more entitled then to chivalrous consideration than,
  for instance, you are. No part of her is any longer sacred. She becomes a
  weapon. And a weapon that breaks, misfires, becomes rusty, or useless for any
  other reason, is simply thrown away."</p>

  <p>"What do you propose to do about it?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I was asked to study and report, not to interfere or advise. But
  I was also asked to get in touch with you."</p>

  <p>"And to report on me, too?"</p>

  <p>"Are you angry?"</p>

  <p>"If I were, I wouldn't let you know it."</p>

  <p>"Will you play fair?"</p>

  <p>"Now what?"</p>

  <p>"I have told you an intimate personal secret. Don't you think it would be
  fair play to do me a very personal favor in return?"</p>

  <p>"Say what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Send Elsa Burbage home to England!"</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. So, if you okay her, she may go to Tibet, but you don't want the
  responsibility? Is that the idea?"</p>

  <p>"You said you wouldn't ask questions. Send her home, Mr. Grayne."</p>

  <p>"What makes you think she'd obey me? Do you think I would have any use for
  a girl who would scram because some one had told me that some one else said
  she was soft?"</p>

  <p>"Very well. Will you try to persuade her to go home?"</p>

  <p>"Because you told me your secret? Are the cases parallel?"</p>

  <p>"If you know India, and the Hills, and Tibet, then you know I'm right. If
  you don't know what I mean, then you had no right to bring a young girl to
  India."</p>

  <p>Tom conceded a point. "Well, you did lay your bet on the board, I admit.
  Okay, I will put it up to her. But I don't guarantee the result."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. I believe you will keep your promise." Suddenly she laughed.
  "But it's a good example of why the individuals of whom we were speaking
  mustn't trust each other. I had absolutely no right to exact that promise.
  It's entirely personal between you and me."</p>

  <p>"I know better than that," Tom answered. "You're obeying orders and
  shielding the man who told you what to do. That's proper. Tell you what. Move
  your things into my compartment and have it all to yourself. You'll be more
  comfortable without some one's feet in your lap. I'll find a shake-down
  somewhere else on the train."</p>

  <p>She nodded&mdash;understood him to mean he wasn't angry.</p>

  <p>"Isn't there plenty of room for us both in here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose there is."</p>

  <p>Tom went in search of a porter to bring her belongings from the other
  compartment. He took his time about it. He put his own bag on the corner seat
  that Miss Strong had vacated, with a belligerent abruptness that amounted to
  an ultimatum. The seat was henceforth his. He wasn't at all sure he wanted
  much more of Nancy Strong's conversation. She wasn't likely to tell him
  anything important, and it might prove too easy to tell her too much.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">CHAPTER 17.</a><br>
  "Guilty. I shouldn't have done it."</h2>

  <p class="first">TOM tried to peer into Abdul Mirza's compartment, but the
  blinds were drawn. So were the blinds of the other compartment, in which the
  staff of secretaries, or whatever they were, were as silent as dead men. He
  loafed about for a while in the corridor, but the compartment doors didn't
  open, so after half an hour or so he returned and sat down again opposite
  Nancy Strong.</p>

  <p>"Done Dutch aunting?" he hinted.</p>

  <p>"No. I am just getting into my stride. It's very good of you to listen. Do
  you know a little church in Bristol named St. John's? A stone church, where
  the Clifton Road crosses the street that leads to the Suspension Bridge?"</p>

  <p>Tom stared hard. Her eyes were laughing at him. It was a palpable hit, and
  he couldn't hide it.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you pull this out of the bag to begin with?" he retorted.</p>

  <p>"It was at the bottom of the bag. And besides, I'm a woman. Please believe
  it is a sheer coincidence that I happen to know that church. I went there to
  attend my sister's wedding, during the last year of the World War."</p>

  <p>"Well? What of it?"</p>

  <p>"It's your turn," she answered. "Tell me."</p>

  <p>"So they know that, do they?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. But they would like to know more. Why did you marry Elsa
  Burbage?"</p>

  <p>"Dammit, why shouldn't I marry her?"</p>

  <p>"You seem to think you shouldn't have. Isn't she&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tom interrupted. He spoke quietly, without emphasis, and yet every other
  word was like a hammer-blow. It was as if he were laying his thoughts on an
  anvil and cracking them up for his own analysis.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you this much, Elsa Burbage is a little bit of a
  Cossacky-looking, well-bred smiler. She has as much pluck as intelligence. As
  much intelligence as good looks. Too good looking, as a matter of fact, but
  too intelligent to be spoiled by fools who'd like to paw her over. She's on
  the level. Knows her stuff. I taught her most of it, but she learned a lot in
  the British Museum. She can read Tibetan as well as I can, and I'm rated an
  expert. I have a big strong-box in a bank vault chock-a-block with real stuff
  that I've not had time to study, let alone to translate. Elsa is to have all
  that, if I get bumped off. And there's other stuff in there, that shouldn't
  be seen for a generation. Elsa would know what to destroy and what to keep
  and what to publish. As I said, she's on the level. She'd do the right thing.
  She couldn't be tempted to do the wrong thing."</p>

  <p>"But she married you. Was that the wrong thing?"</p>

  <p>"The worst break I ever made. A sentimental mistake. They're the worst
  kind. I could have consulted a lawyer and made a will leaving the contents of
  the strong-box to her."</p>

  <p>"But perhaps you were afraid she might marry some one else?" said Nancy
  Strong. "You know the proverb: a mistress keeps a secret for a week, a wife
  as long as she loves you, a friend forever, but other men's wives never leave
  off telling it."</p>

  <p>"No," Tom answered. "I don't own her. We agreed she can have a divorce, at
  my expense, on demand, at any time, provided she doesn't swap horses in
  mid-stream. If she should fall in love, she'd have to wait until she could
  get a divorce, in Mexico or somewhere, without getting my name into public
  print. It was to be a strictly secret marriage, for strictly business
  purposes."</p>

  <p>"Now that the secret is out, she may have a divorce?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Why not? She'd better do it. D'you know why I've been trusted, quite
  a bit, by certain people?"</p>

  <p>"I believe I can guess," Nancy Strong answered. She was just plump enough
  to be unable to suppress a slight ripple of mirth. "You are probably known as
  a man who can't be taken in or hoodwinked by any woman. Were you hood winked
  by Elsa Burbage?"</p>

  <p>"No, I wasn't. I've told you what she is. I'll back my judgment against
  yours or any one's. In fact, that's what I did do. She was wild to come to
  India, and to help me to enter Tibet. She had worked so hard, and schooled
  herself, and saved her money, and kept physically fit, and so set her teeth
  into the job of making herself useful to me, that I yessed her. I shouldn't
  have. But I did. I even said I'd try to get her into Tibet. She deserves it.
  She's ace-high to any deuce of an adventuress I ever met."</p>

  <p>"But that isn't why you married her?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's one reason. If I should get bumped off, she might stand a
  better chance as my legal widow than if people should find out she'd merely
  tagged me along. I've seen several women get a hell of a cold deal because
  they couldn't show a marriage certificate. And they were damned good women;
  I'm not talking about kept women or Shanghai passage-beggars."</p>

  <p>"You admit you made a bad break."</p>

  <p>"Only time in my life I was sentimental."</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong a bit too visibly suppressed an Old Faithful geyser of
  amusement. She used her handkerchief. It did sound a bit like a sneeze. But
  she controlled her voice perfectly:</p>

  <p>"Hadn't you better ask her to go away and divorce you? Didn't you say, in
  Mexico?"</p>

  <p>"I'll have to think that over."</p>

  <p>Tom went out and paced the corridor. He had something else to think about.
  Dowlah. Abdul Mirza. Noropa. For fifteen or twenty minutes he kept an eye on
  the doors of two closed compartments. However, no luck yet. So he returned
  and sat down again.</p>

  <p>"Verdict?" Nancy Strong asked.</p>

  <p>"Guilty. I shouldn't have done it. It was probably vanity. I guess a
  psychoanalyst would say I craved a she-disciple, to make me feel like a guru.
  Elsa will stick to her guns, mind you. Why shouldn't she? But the marriage
  has ruined the team. If I order her home, she can claim privilege. If I
  should offer any mushy reasons for avoiding danger, she can quote our
  bargain. We agreed, she's entitled to take all chances, at her own risk, same
  as I am."</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong opened her bag and snapped it shut, but she made no other
  sign of having reached a climax. Her voice was normal:</p>

  <p>"Would you like me to suggest in the proper quarter that she should be
  sent home? That would not involve you. She would never know who advised, or
  who ordered it. She need never know that you and I discussed her."</p>

  <p>"Go to hell," Tom answered. "Before I'd do her any dirt like that, I'd
  brain you with a monkey-wrench and throw the wrench into the works. If you or
  they want her run out of India, say it to me. I'll pull my freight and hers,
  too. I know how to get to Tibet without double-crossing a good kid."</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong rippled all over with laughter.</p>

  <p>"Very creditable, Mr. Grayne! One of these days, when you do fall in love
  with a girl, I wonder what lengths you won't go to for her sake. She will be
  able to count on you when her back is turned, won't she! Very well, I promise
  I won't suggest any official move of that sort."</p>

  <p>"Care for some dinner?"</p>

  <p>She laughed again. "You have a grand way of denying anger. Yes, I would
  like dinner. Do you trust me to keep my promise?"</p>

  <p>"If they order her deported, I will know at whose door to deliver the
  bouquet," he answered.</p>

  <p>"And if they don't&mdash;no flowers, Mr. Grayne, by request."</p>

  <p>"Understood and agreed. Let's go eat."</p>

  <p>No sign of Abdul Mirza, nor of any of his companions, except that a waiter
  was removing soiled dishes from the prime minister's compartment, but he had
  closed the door behind him before Tom could get a glimpse. However, it wasn't
  that compartment that interested him as much as the other. Prime ministers,
  as a rule, don't do their own dirty work; they look the other way while some
  one does it who can be repudiated after the event. The other compartment door
  was shut, blinds drawn, and not a sound within.</p>

  <p>However, he had better luck after dinner. A silk-clad secretary sort of
  person came out of Abdul Mirza's compartment and entered the other one just
  as Tom entered the corridor on his way from the dining-car. Nancy Strong,
  behind him, was left imagining what she pleased. Tom passed the door in time
  to get one swift glimpse before it slammed shut. He had seen what he
  wanted.</p>

  <p>"Do you sleep well on a train?" he asked when he and Nancy Strong had sat
  down again facing each other.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I usually turn in early and sleep till daylight."</p>

  <p>"Okay. I won't disturb you. I may find some one to talk to. Might talk all
  night."</p>

  <p>"Talk to me, if that's your trouble."</p>

  <p>But the spell was broken. Conversation lagged. It was barely ten o'clock
  when Tom strolled down the corridor and claimed the lower berth on which he
  had left his bag. He sprawled with the bag under his elbows, so that he could
  see under the blind into the corridor. It was midnight, or later, before he
  moved from that position. Then he opened the door, making hardly a sound, and
  tiptoed out.</p>

  <p>He was almost too late. By the time he reached the car ahead there was
  some one standing by the door of the compartment in which Nancy Strong lay
  asleep. A very tall, bare-headed man in a dark suit. He had opened the door
  and was trying to peer into the dark interior. His back was toward Tom. The
  corridor lights were turned low. There were deep shadows.</p>

  <p>Train thief? Hardly likely on a modern express train.</p>

  <p>There is a whole caste of professional thieves whose only means of
  livelihood is robbing Indian trains and their passengers. So almost anything
  was possible. But the man looked familiar.</p>

  <p>Tom crowded himself against the curve at the end of the corridor. The man
  appeared to be listening. He opened the door a trifle wider. Apparently the
  slight squeak of the hinges awoke Nancy Strong or perhaps she hadn't been
  asleep. She switched on the light. The man scooted away, along the corridor
  toward the car ahead. Tom didn't follow; a train corridor is a mean place for
  a fight, especially with some one who probably carries a knife, or worse.
  Instead, he went and told Nancy Strong to lock the door on the inside.</p>

  <p>"I've found a man to talk to. Good night. See you in the morning."</p>

  <p>He went and turned in&mdash;slept like a top. He didn't wake until the
  train neared Siliguri.</p>

  <p class="first">"SILIGURI! Change for Darjeeling!"</p>

  <p>Pulses begin to beat faster at Siliguri. There the two-foot gauge
  Himalayan Mountain Railway awaits the transcontinental mails. Six hundred
  feet above sea level, six thousand feet below Darjeeling, and piping hot from
  the snipe and rice swamps of Bengal, Siliguri is the threshold of another
  world. The plains cease. The mountains begin. The early morning excites
  imagination&mdash;sends it leaping from forest to forest, across the
  intervening tea gardens, toward the grandest view on earth, where the
  Himalayan ranges rise against the northern sky.</p>

  <p>Tom pitched his bag to a Lepcha porter on the platform and followed it. He
  was the first passenger to leave the train. There were all sorts of people on
  the platform, all in motion&mdash;Lepchas, Gurkhas, Tibetans,
  Bengalis&mdash;tea-planters in Terai hats&mdash;British and Indian
  soldiers&mdash;police&mdash;gazelle-eyed women&mdash;beggars and thieves and
  princes' sons. Tom told his porter to go and wait for him "perhaps a long
  time" in the shade near the auto-parking place.</p>

  <p>He knew the station well. A score of strides and he was hidden in the
  almost dark room where the emergency oil-lanterns stand in a row on a shelf.
  There was only one small dirty window, rather high up; he had to stand on a
  box and clear a peephole through the dust. He saw Abdul Mirza and his
  companions, and presently Nancy Strong go hurrying after their baggage toward
  the narrow gauge train. But no Noropa&mdash;not yet. He was almost beginning
  to lose hope that Noropa had seen him enter the lamp room, when he caught
  sight of a man coming along the platform from the rear end of the train.</p>

  <p>Sure thing! Unmistakably Noropa, in an ill-fitting, hurriedly-made bazaar
  suit and a Lepcha turban, looking like a school-teacher. He was wearing
  spectacles, probably plain glass. He was stooping a little to make his great
  height less noticeable. No bag, no porter. He threaded his way through the
  dwindling crowd as if he had business at the far end of the platform.</p>

  <p>There was a momentary tumult of excitement, just in front of the window,
  where some Indian passengers were being met by noisy friends and relatives.
  Some one's caged monkey got loose and a dog gave chase. Shrieks, shouts,
  roars of laughter. Noropa was very clever, the way he snatched the
  opportunity to step sideways and make for the lamp-room door. He didn't dash
  in. He stopped and stooped to tie his shoe-lace, so as to look back and make
  sure he was unobserved. Then he entered quite quietly.</p>

  <p>But he didn't shut the door swiftly enough. He drew his weapon just a
  fraction of a second too soon; the light shone on it before the door shut and
  Tom recognized the kind of weapon he had to deal with. That was half the
  battle, but the other half wasn't so simple. He didn't want a corpse on his
  hands, nor even a badly injured man. He didn't want a police investigation.
  He would never be forgiven if he set police investigators on the <i>qui
  vive</i>.</p>

  <p>There wasn't a word spoken. Hardly a sound. Noropa's weapon broke against
  the stone wall. Tom's fist thudded on the point of Noropa's
  chin&mdash;dropped him like a steer in a shambles. He lay still. It was a
  pippin of a punch on the jaw; he was likely to lie there for several
  minutes.</p>

  <p>Tom examined the weapon&mdash;eighteen inches of bright tool steel as thin
  as a bodkin, set into a heavy brass-bound wooden hilt. Hilt and blade both
  hollow. A strong spring and about an ounce of poison in the hilt that would
  have gone squirting through the blade into any wound it made. No smell that
  Tom recognized. Probably a quite rare poison. It was oozing out through the
  broken blade&mdash;thick, sticky stuff like molasses. He stuck the blade into
  a crack in the wall to let it bleed, so to speak, without leaving a menace
  for some lamp-trimmer's naked foot.</p>

  <p>Noropa stirred, opened his eyes and blinked. Tom stooped over him, lifted
  him by the shoulders&mdash;the man was as heavy as lead&mdash;and set him
  sitting against the wall. The door opened suddenly. Sunlight fell full on
  Noropa's death-mask face. The station-master&mdash;Anglo-Indian, natty,
  alert, helmeted, smartly uniformed in white&mdash;stood staring. All three
  men had presence of mind. The station-master took a step backward to glance
  left and right for the railway police. Noropa sat still, pretending to be
  much less conscious than he was. Tom spoke to the station-master:</p>

  <p>"Could you get me some ice water? I think he was looking for the lavatory.
  I saw him go in here and fall down, so I followed to see what was the
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Why did you shut the door?" asked the station-master. He was suspicious,
  but Tom's easy assurance impressed him, and there was no obvious sign of a
  struggle. Noropa's chin on his chest concealed the mark of the blow.</p>

  <p>"Was it shut? I didn't notice. I guess I kicked it when I tried to lift
  him."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know?"</p>

  <p>"By his turban he's a Lepcha," said the station-master.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He's on his way to Darjeeling. He told me that on the train," Tom
  answered.</p>

  <p>"Well, he has missed the Mountain train. It's pulling out now. Has he a
  ticket?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know? I've no right to look in his pockets. Tell you what,"
  said Tom, "I'm going up by road, so I'll give him a lift. If he isn't better
  by the time we reach the hotel I'll take him to a doctor. Will you help me
  get him out of here?"</p>

  <p>"I'll call a couple of porters. Have you engaged a car? I'll see if I can
  get one for you."</p>

  <p>When the station-master turned his back Tom shook his fist under Noropa's
  nose for silence. It was hardly necessary. Noropa had heard, understood. He
  even smiled assent to Tom's lie about what had happened. Tom took the knife
  from the crack in the wall, wrapped it in a rag that he snatched from the
  lamp-shelf and thrust it into Noropa's jacket-pocket, forcing it down between
  the jacket and the cheap Italian half-lining. He picked up the broken half of
  the blade and put that into Noropa's side-pocket. Noropa understood that
  also: if the police should show up and become curious, they would find that
  deadly weapon on the person of its owner.</p>

  <p>The station-master returned with two porters.</p>

  <p>"There's only one auto left," he said. "It's a ramshackle old thing, but
  you'll have to take it if you don't want to wait for a couple of hours. He
  looks better already, doesn't he. Some of them, if they're not used to it,
  get train-sick. But I'd take him to a hospital, if I were you, and let 'em
  find out what's wrong. Come on, you, these porters will help you out
  o'here."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">CHAPTER 19.</a><br>
  "You're a mongrel. but I'll give you a chance."</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was an ancient Sunbeam. Its spare tire was down to the
  canvas; the four tires in use were only slightly better. The springs of the
  worn cushions were concealed by a folded stable blanket. The Bengali Moslem
  driver knew no English.</p>

  <p>The engine sounded like a machine-gun getting hot and about ready to jam;
  it was a question which would give out first, engine or tires. But Tom
  couldn't afford to let it go at that. With a grin at the driver he raised the
  hood, pretending to give a half-turn to the screws on a couple of oil cups.
  What he actually did was to open the newly fitted brass water plug just
  enough to establish a steady drip, good for ten or twelve miles at a guess,
  supposing the radiator was full to start with. It probably was full; there
  was a water faucet near by and the water cost nothing.</p>

  <p>Then away, on the rear seat beside Noropa, with a rattle like a tinker's
  cart and the canvas top nodding like a processional canopy. Rubber tooter,
  blowing like the devil to make the Siliguri bullock-carts get out of the way.
  Dead slow, choking dusty, until they turned toward the mountain and began the
  long, comparatively easy, beautifully engineered ascent.</p>

  <p>Tom recovered the weapon then. His left fist, knotted like a club,
  commanded the situation; his right hand searched Noropa's pockets
  competently, considering that picking pockets wasn't his normal occupation.
  All he found was the poisoned dagger in two parts, several hundred rupees in
  paper money, a few small coins and a white gold wrist-watch with a broken
  strap. It was all right, it wasn't Elsa's watch, though it did look like it
  for a moment. No return ticket. One Tibetan coin among the small change
  wasn't anything to arouse comment. But the ten-rupee notes were brand
  new.</p>

  <p>"All a traveler needs nowadays is money, isn't it," said Tom. "Here you
  are&mdash;take it. When a man like you goes to a bank with a cheque they give
  him all the dirty money in the till. Who gave you nice clean bank notes?"</p>

  <p>No answer, but Noropa seemed surprised to get his money back. He stowed it
  away carefully, eyeing Tom sideways, Tom pretending to watch the road.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Thought so! Drop it, or I'll break your wrist!"</p>

  <p>No punch necessary that time. A small knife hidden in a pocket in Noropa's
  shirt had fallen crosswise and hadn't come out handily. It fell to the floor
  of the car as his big-boned forearm creaked in Tom's doubled grip. Tom put
  his foot on the knife.</p>

  <p>"Any more weapons? Kick your shoes off."</p>

  <p>He felt Noropa all over, tapping lightly, because it is easy to overlook
  quite bulky objects if the searcher uses too much pressure. It was all right,
  the man was completely disarmed now. For at least an hour or two he wouldn't
  feel exactly tempted to use that right forearm. He was rubbing it with the
  other hand. There was pain in his eyes. They weren't pleasant eyes to look
  at. Framed in the blue-rimmed plain glass spectacles they looked like the
  eyes of a man on the rack, so full of hate that no pain could conquer
  him.</p>

  <p>"I've conquered tougher guys than you," Tom remarked in a matter-of-fact
  voice. "None of you terrorists can ever stomach your own stuff. Somewhere
  between here and Darjeeling you're going to break. Do you know what that
  means?"</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>"You can have it as rough as you choose. I'm not squeamish."</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>"Where is Miss Elsa Burbage?"</p>

  <p>"Not knowing."</p>

  <p>"Where is Th&ouml;-pa-ga?"</p>

  <p>"Not knowing."</p>

  <p>"Where is the Holy Lama Lobsang Pun?"</p>

  <p>Silence.</p>

  <p>"So you're afraid of Lobsang Pun. What could he do to you?"</p>

  <p>"You-who-know-what-shang-shang-is&mdash;you-bloody-fool-
  you-break-my-arm&mdash;you-get-a-shang-shang-sending."</p>

  <p>"Trot out your shang-shang. Who killed Eiji Sarao?"</p>

  <p>Got him! The meaning of his sudden stare was unmistakable. Some
  one&mdash;very likely Abdul Mirza, but perhaps Dowlah, had told Noropa that
  Eiji Sarao was dead of that wound in the neck. Tom felt fairly confident that
  Eiji Sarao was really being secretly conveyed to Naini Kol. But Noropa
  believed him dead. That was clear. A lucky shot, that. Now for another, a
  thousand to one shot, that wouldn't do any harm if it didn't come off:</p>

  <p>"Lobsang Pun was angry that you killed Eiji Sarao. You come after me, to
  kill me, to make Lobsang Pun forgive you for having killed Eiji."</p>

  <p>Silence. Had the shot missed? Then suddenly:</p>

  <p>"You-bloody-fool-you&mdash;
  shang-shang-sending-killing-you-like-Eiji!"</p>

  <p>That was a stumper.</p>

  <p>"Are you so crazy that you kid yourself you're a shang-shang?"</p>

  <p>No answer. Tom, his imagination leaping from guess to guess, plugged home
  another disturbing question without a query mark:</p>

  <p>"Rajah Dowlah told you Lobsang Pun demanded that you kill me, because the
  Japanese demanded it, because I'm bad for the plan to make use of
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga."</p>

  <p>Got him again! Noropa shook his head in dissent too vehemently. His eyes
  glazed with the smoky oriental sullenness that guards the truth that has been
  touched but still perhaps only guessed at, not discovered.</p>

  <p>"You're an awful boob," said Tom, "if you believed that yarn. You haven't
  a Chinaman's chance to curry favor with Lobsang Pun. He's through with you.
  If you had killed me, he'd have had you hanged by the British. Or, if they
  wouldn't do it, he'd have had you fed to shang-shangs."</p>

  <p>Noropa shuddered. The mention of Lobsang Pun's name seemed to make him as
  nervous as a chela who hears his guru being blasphemed.</p>

  <p>"As for Dowlah," said Tom, "if you trust him, you're a worse fool even
  than I thought you. Dowlah believes in neither god nor devil. He'd betray any
  one, if he thought he couldn't be found out, just for the sake of feeling
  clever. What did Dowlah tell you about me?"</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>"Dowlah told you they've decided they don't need me but they can use Miss
  Elsa Burbage."</p>

  <p>Noropa's intelligence laired in a cavernous mystery of superstition. To
  him, every breath a man breathed&mdash;every word a man said, had a dark
  metaphysical cause; it served some devil's purpose, or it could not be.
  Sulky, sullen, he was frightened by the accuracy of Tom's guesswork. It
  seemed to him supernatural. It had far more effect on him than the punch on
  the jaw and the agonied arm. Tom continued:</p>

  <p>"So Dowlah gave you a weapon and money, but he didn't tell Abdul Mirza.
  You traveled with Abdul Mirza's staff, but they can swear they knew nothing
  about it."</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>They had crossed the wandering narrow-gauge railway track a dozen times,
  when the rotten old rattletrap car at last did even better than Tom hoped.
  Half-way through a mile-wide belt of deodars, between two tea estates, the
  radiator boiled and a rear tire blew like a gun going off. The Bengali
  driver, in a rising off-key yell of misery, named three men, probably
  mechanics. He invited Allah (blessed be His Prophet) to impregnate them and
  all their progeny forever with deathless worms and inward-growing boils that
  should destroy their rest and make sleep a torment. Having attended to that,
  he got down to attend to the tire. Tom eyed Noropa:</p>

  <p>"Put your shoes on and get out."</p>

  <p>The set-up was perfect. A dark wilderness of trees. A convenient hollow
  out of earshot from the road. Probably at least an hour's work for the
  Bengali, patching that rotten tire and then finding out what was wrong with
  the engine. Even if he should think of tightening the water plug, he had
  nothing in which to fetch water; he would have to go in search of a vessel of
  some sort. There was plenty of time, and no risk whatever of
  interruption.</p>

  <p>Noropa tried to escape. Tom's toe hooked his instep as he ducked around a
  big tree. He fell headlong and got up be cause he was kicked up. There isn't
  any fun in kicking even murderers who use poisoned daggers, but there was no
  sense in half-doing the job. Noropa walked backward after that. He didn't
  dare to shout for help, nor did he dare take his eyes off Tom; a fellow whose
  team had depended on him, not so many years ago, for an occasional drop-goal
  from the seventy-five yard line, has a remarkably accurate aim and a toe that
  can hurt. Noropa fell, naturally, several times. He was kicked up again. He
  picked up a rock. It was kicked out of his hand before he could raise his
  hand to throw it. By the time they reached the bottom of the hollow he was
  possessed by an inferiority complex that even his malice hadn't heat enough
  to burn off. Tom did nothing to reduce it:</p>

  <p>"You miserable mongrel. Why d'you call yourself Tibetan? You couldn't fool
  a Tibetan. You're Chinese-Jap. Chinks and Japs are not allowed in Inner
  Tibet."</p>

  <p>Silence. It amounted to sulky assent. No Tibetan would have swallowed that
  insult without protest. Tom's guesses were beginning to have the feel of
  accuracy. It was like working out a mathematical equation with a number of
  unknowns. Get one right and the others logically follow.</p>

  <p>"I'd give a dollar to know your early history, you useless pye-dog."</p>

  <p>Not a word at random. The word "useless" specially chosen. "Pye-dog"* was
  pretty scurrilous, but it was better than its American equivalent, at the
  moment.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Pye-dog</i> (Anglo-Indian from Hindi <i>pahi</i> -
  outsider)&mdash;ownerless half-wild mongrel dog common around Asian villages,
  especially in India. ]</p>

  <p>"You've had an education of sorts. You're a Christian convert. You were
  kicked out of your church."</p>

  <p>A hit! Mystery men hate to be stripped of their veils. They prefer
  physical torture; vanity helps them to endure that. Noropa stood still
  enough, but his mind almost visibly shrank. It found no shelter.</p>

  <p>"You're a killer. You probably murdered a Christian priest somewhere in
  China. Not for money. You'd be too superstitious. The first thing they teach
  you black magicians is you mustn't kill for money. Did you want to take holy
  orders? Did a father-confessor say no? Told you you weren't fit for the
  priesthood? That it?"</p>

  <p>Silence.</p>

  <p>"Tell me when I'm mistaken, won't you! Turned down. Revenge. Was it
  you?&mdash;or wasn't it?&mdash;who tipped off the Chinese to scough a
  mission? But a taste of religion had shown you a way to become important.
  Couldn't get by as a Christian. Tried another line, eh? Fell in with a
  shaman? You've the symptoms. One of those wandering wizards who sell poisons
  and love-potions? Taught you that your ugly mug was fine for scaring women,
  kids, sick folk, and superstitious peasants. Hell, you even tried to scare me
  with it, in London."</p>

  <p>The eyes, now, of a cornered animal that daren't fight and can't run. The
  eyes of a gangster, not only cut off from, but deserted by his gang. Defiance
  dead. Nothing left but a lonely, self-pitying gloom that a man, however tough
  he may be, can't keep out of his. eyes when he knows the gang has disowned
  him. There is the same look in the eyes of an animal that has been driven
  from the herd.</p>

  <p>"Who taught you Tantric Buddhism?" Tom demanded. "Did you learn it in
  Peking, hanging around the legations, doing odds and ends of spy work, while
  you looked for a religion that you could get your teeth into? Lots of exiled
  Tibetans in Peking."</p>

  <p>He was taking long chances. You can't expect a bull's-eye every guess, not
  even when the guessing is comparatively easy. But he was watching Noropa's
  eyes; there wasn't a hint of a gleam of triumph to suggest that he was
  guessing badly. There wasn't even a look of momentary relief.</p>

  <p>"And then the Tashi Lama&mdash;Panchen Lama, you'd call him&mdash;fled
  from Shigatse in Tibet to escape from the political gang in Lhasa. Wanted to
  go to Urga in Mongolia. But the Chinese Government was afraid the Russians
  might get control of him, so they forced him to go to Peking, where they gave
  him an apartment in the imperial palace. The Jap legation had sense enough to
  see his value in a second. You haven't brains enough to have thought of that.
  But by that time you'd made yourself pretty useful to the undercover agents
  of the Japanese legation. Hadn't you? And of course, they threatened you.
  That's routine. Obey, or be betrayed to the Chinese and repudiated&mdash;then
  left to your fate. The prospect of the tortures in a Chinese dungeon didn't
  tempt you, but a chance to get your teeth into a good mysterious religion
  did. One way or another you wormed your way into the Tashi&mdash;that's to
  say the Panchen Lama's establishment in Peking, as a spy for the Japanese.
  Guard? Or were you posing as a humble supplicant for religious teaching? Or
  both? Answer: is that how you came to meet Lobsang Pun?"</p>

  <p>No answer. A glare of sullen obstinacy, instantly met by a resounding
  crack on the jaw from Tom's fist.</p>

  <p>"You heard me. Answer."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Thought so. Who told you about the Thunder Dragon Gate and
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga?"</p>

  <p>Silence. Noropa was rubbing his jaw. His lips were trembling. His fingers
  twitched. Insolence had begun to yield to self-pity. To keep him from
  rebuilding his mental resistance, Tom went at him swiftly from another
  angle:</p>

  <p>"All sorts of undercover dirty work goes on, doesn't it, that the
  Tashi&mdash;I mean Panchen Lama doesn't know about. His Holiness is a gentle,
  benevolent man of peace. Some of his followers aren't. They're more ambitious
  for him than he is for himself. They don't tell him all that goes on, do
  they?"</p>

  <p>Noropa looked puzzled. Suddenly Tom shot a statement at him, and a
  question:</p>

  <p>"The Most Reverend and Holy Lobsang Pun was with the Panchen Lama for a
  while in Peking. Was it he who told you about Th&ouml;-pa-ga. Did Lobsang Pun tell
  you about the Thunder Dragon Gate?"</p>

  <p>Silence.</p>

  <p>"Bound you to secrecy, did he? Shall I repeat the oath for you?"</p>

  <p>"No!" It was almost a shout.</p>

  <p>Tom laughed. He did repeat the oath, in Tibetan:</p>

  <p><i>"This supplicant, in deep humility applying for a revelation from the
  earthly custodian of wisdom and continual blessings&mdash;standing in awe
  before the blessed sacraments and in the holy presence of innumerable saints,
  solemnly avowing secrecy, willingly accepts the penalty of being
  shang-shang-hunted through hell forever, without rest or other mercy, if
  violating this secret at any time for any reason."</i></p>

  <p>"May you die of it!" said Noropa.</p>

  <p>Tom laughed again. He continued:</p>

  <p>"Lobsang Pun was intriguing for Japanese help to enable the Panchen Lama
  to return to Tibet and kick out the political gang in Lhasa. He wasn't
  expecting anything for nothing, either. Didn't the Japanese recommend you to
  Lobsang Pun as a suitable man to be sent to England to make Th&ouml;-pa-ga return
  to Tibet? Answer!"</p>

  <p>Noropa mumbled. The combination of being kicked and hit and stripped of
  mystery had left him almost without a will of his own.</p>

  <p>"You you-knowing-so-well-all-that-why-you-asking-me?" he stuttered.</p>

  <p>"Who sent you to the Thunder Dragon Gate for training before sending you
  to London? Lobsang Pun?"</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>"Lobsang Pun would never send you into Inner Tibet. You know as well as I
  do, it's sure death for a lama to do that without definite orders from Lhasa.
  If he did it, they'd drown him. And Lobsang Pun couldn't get orders from
  Lhasa. How could he? He's the Tashi&mdash;Panchen Lama's man. But you crave
  to go to Inner Tibet. You would like to link up with B&ouml;n magicians. I know
  your yearning. There are plenty like you with that complaint, but you have it
  badly. Therefore you attached yourself to Lobsang Pun. And him you fear and
  obey. There never was a terrorist who didn't have to have a secret
  him-who-is-to-be-obeyed. That's all that keeps you from dying of fear.
  Lobsang Pun is your"&mdash;he used a Tibetan
  word&mdash;"undeniable-one-whose-unspoken-wish-is-sooner-to-be-
  obeyed-than-the-spoken-commands-of-any-other-person. Lobsang Pun is my
  friend."</p>

  <p>That was a staggerer. Noropa took off his spectacles, wiped his face with
  his sleeve and muttered. He was cursing Tom and summoning dark forces. Failed
  by the powers of darkness, there would be nothing left on which to base
  resistance. Tom went at him again:</p>

  <p>"You half-magicians all believe your own stuff, until you find it won't
  work. You can't even keep a secret." He took a dangerous chance now. "The
  Thunder Dragon Gate is near the border between Tibet and Nepal, near Mount
  Everest, where the Most Reverend and Holy Lama Lobsang Pun is supposed to
  have spent two years immured in a cave."</p>

  <p>Pure deduction, based on a retentive memory of hints and chance remarks.
  If it missed it would restore Noropa's self-confidence. But there wasn't a
  glimmering hint of superior knowledge in Noropa's eyes. On the contrary, a
  look of utter desperation had crept into them. Tom followed up:</p>

  <p>"You weren't accepted as a disciple by Lobsang Pun. You're not his
  <i>chela</i>. You're a stool-pigeon. Such a man as Lobsang Pun could see
  through you in half a second. But he helped you to become a novice in the
  Thunder Dragon Gate, because he could do that without betraying his own oath.
  Later, he sent you to England, because you can speak English. Your job was to
  compel Th&ouml;-pa-ga to return. You weren't ordered to return from England. Who
  the hell wants a stinker like you when you've done your business? When you
  followed Th&ouml;-pa-ga to India, you found that Lobsang Pun was very angry with
  you for having dared to get in touch with the Japanese secret agents in
  London and Paris. Who were you that you should dare to step out?"</p>

  <p>Noropa's face was a picture. The last layer of all of his skin of mystery
  was being torn off. Tom went on flaying mercilessly:</p>

  <p>"Eiji Sarao paid your fare to India. Lobsang Pun was particularly angry
  with you for knowing Eiji Sarao. Now you're afraid that Lobsang Pun will slam
  the door on you forever. Why shouldn't he?"</p>

  <p>Pause&mdash;a rather long one. Then:</p>

  <p>"I am the only man in the world who can influence Lobsang Pun to overlook
  your misbehavior."</p>

  <p>Not a flutter, but a kind of false dawn in Noropa's eyes. It vanished. No
  hurry. Two or three more mental wallops, and almost any spark of hope would
  look attractive.</p>

  <p>"Lobsang Pun believes you killed Eiji Sarao because you had been rebuked
  for knowing Eiji Sarao and for accepting his money."</p>

  <p>First miss! But it accomplished more than a hit. Noropa leaped with relief
  at a chance to prove that Tom didn't know everything.</p>

  <p>"Damn-fool-Eiji-waking-up-and-going-library-looking-for-
  Dowlah-not-there-opening-cage-and-shang-shang-bit-him."</p>

  <p>"Where's the shang-shang?"</p>

  <p>"Library-door-open-escaping-into-hall-and-out-through-open-window-good-
  by."</p>

  <p>Tom didn't dare to laugh. Noropa had no sense of humor. He couldn't be
  moved by imagination of Dowlah's mourning for his lost pet and the efforts of
  skeptics to explain away the shang-shang's killings.</p>

  <p>"What d'you think Lobsang Pun will do to you when he learns you took money
  from Rajah Dowlah to kill me? I am Lobsang Pun's friend."</p>

  <p>Silence.</p>

  <p>"What will Dowlah do when he learns you failed?"</p>

  <p>More silence.</p>

  <p>"What will Lobsang Pun do when he learns you told me where the Thunder
  Dragon Gate is?"</p>

  <p>"Ah-h-h! Not me! Not telling! Never!"</p>

  <p>"No? Try to make Lobsang Pun believe you didn't tell me! Try to make the
  guardians of the Thunder Dragon Gate believe you didn't tell me!"</p>

  <p>" You-who-so-well-knowing-Lobsang-Pun-you-say-you-
  talking-him-for-me-yes-why-you-say-that?"</p>

  <p>Quietly: "Where is Miss Elsa Burbage?"</p>

  <p>"Not knowing."</p>

  <p>Tom's foot moved. Noropa flinched&mdash;spoke suddenly:</p>

  <p>"Girl-and-Th&ouml;-pa-ga-in-auto-to-Darjeeling."</p>

  <p>"Where is the Holy Lama Lobsang Pun?"</p>

  <p>"In-auto-to-Darjeeling."</p>

  <p>"Same auto?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe 'nother auto. Not knowing."</p>

  <p>"Coming to Darjeeling, is he? Do you want me to protect you?"</p>

  <p>"You-you-saying-you-his-friend-you-doing-that?"</p>

  <p>"If you obey me. You're a coward. You're a mongrel. But I'll give you a
  chance."</p>

  <p>Noropa's answering gesture was one of almost weird humility. Like a
  de-fanged cobra, he would need time to grow new fangs and brew new venom.</p>

  <p>"But if you miss your chance, don't look to me for pity. Walk ahead. To
  the car. And get in."</p>

  <p>Noropa didn't like walking ahead. He couldn't walk fast, he had been
  kicked too painfully. To reach the road was about all he could manage. The
  Bengali had decided to take a chance with the spare tire; the blown one was
  beyond his skill to repair. He had carried water in a borrowed kerosene tin,
  but he hadn't thought of tightening the water plug. Tom attended to that.</p>

  "Did you have trouble with this man?"</h2>

  <p class="first">DARJEELING enjoys a climate. It endures the weather. All the
  way up the magnificent drive from Siliguri Tom leaned back on the comfortless
  cushions and let his lungs fill with pine scent borne on the snow-sweetened
  breezes from the Roof of the World. He sat cornerwise, to keep an eye on
  Noropa, but he only spoke to him once in a while, with long pauses, always
  speaking suddenly, to give the man no time to invent lies.</p>

  <p>"Can you catch a shang-shang?"</p>

  <p>"No, no!"</p>

  <p>"You useless duffer!"</p>

  <p>"Not-yet-learning-how-to-do-it.
  That-is-secret-only-known-to-some-few-persons-specially-chosen."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. Do they ever get bitten?"</p>

  <p>"No, no. Same-as-serpent-charmers-never-bitten-knowing-proper-magic."</p>

  <p>"Is a shang-shang solitary?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes." Noropa shuddered.
  "She-shang-shang-slaying-any-other-coming-near-it."</p>

  <p>"Who said so?"</p>

  <p>"I seeing."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"Two-three time."</p>

  <p>Sudden rain put an end to the conversation. Not the climate, weather.
  Black clouds, shot with lightning, rolled above the mountain. Purple gloom.
  Chill air. A stupendous deluge that in two or three seconds made an
  overflowing bathtub of the canvas top. Noropa, speaking vehemently, named the
  devils who had done it. Being rotten, the canvas burst and let fall about a
  hundred pounds of water into Tom's and Noropa's laps. The spare tire chose
  that moment for a blow-out. The driver announced he was out of petrol. With
  the air of resignation of a captain who has done his utmost and now proposes
  to sink with the ship, he bowed his head over the wheel and nasally praised
  Allah.</p>

  <p>Tom paid him and left him. A walk in the rain would do Noropa good; it
  would supple him up where the kicks had left him stiff and painful. It was
  only three or four miles to their destination. Noropa could carry the bag.
  That, too, would do him good. It would serve to increase his consciousness of
  defeat. Noropa made a fuss about it. He pretended the elevation made him
  breathless, that the rain chilled him and that the sheer weight of the
  downpour broke his strength. But he didn't like being laughed at, and he
  liked still less the prospect of being kicked. So he shouldered the bag and
  walked ahead, as commanded.</p>

  <p>To reach the Ringding Gelong Monastery, you avoid the township. You follow
  the wonderful road that skirts the cliff, where landslides once fell in the
  rain upon snoozing villages and buried them and all the intervening forest
  beneath hundreds of acres of wet earth. Four miles along that road, above an
  aromatic ocean of deodars, and you round a corner and see the monastery
  rather suddenly, a bit below you. It faces the Himalayas, with Darjeeling
  above, at its back. From its roof you can see Tibet. In fine weather the
  horizon-long Himalayas seem only a few miles distant.</p>

  <p>The rain over Darjeeling, being due to the weather, not the climate,
  cleared as suddenly as it had come. The sun light burst forth and shone upon
  gleaming rocks and roaring torrents. It was almost impossible to hear
  anything above the raging of rain-fed waterfalls. Tom paused to stare at the
  northern sky line. He loved that view. He watched a dark patch, about the
  size of a postage stamp, moving across the surface of the distant
  snow&mdash;a storm in the Hills&mdash;a killer. His ears were full of the
  cascade music. He didn't hear a car overtake him&mdash;wasn't, in fact, aware
  of it until it passed and stopped beside Noropa, who was waiting patiently.
  An Indian policeman got out of the car and ordered Noropa to the front seat
  beside the driver. Noropa obeyed without saying a word, as if he believed Tom
  had done this by superior magic. What else could it be? Tom hadn't
  phoned&mdash;wired&mdash;sent a message ahead.</p>

  <p>A police officer on the rear seat called to Tom:</p>

  <p>"Is that your bag he's carrying?"</p>

  <p>Tom went up and took the bag in silence. The officer stood up to remove
  his waterproof.</p>

  <p>"You're wet through," he remarked. "How far are you going?"</p>

  <p>"I'll be all right. Not far. Is he under arrest?"</p>

  <p>"Detention. Suspected of being an unregistered alien&mdash;held for
  investigation." The officer looked straight into Tom's eyes. He wasn't
  smiling, but his eyes looked merry. "Incommunicado," he added. "The
  station-master phoned from Siliguri. You're expected, so we kept a dekko
  lifting. Followed you along to a quiet place. Is his name Noropa?"</p>

  <p>"That's what he says his name is. Who expects me?"</p>

  <p>"Some one at the Ringding Gelong Monastery."</p>

  <p>"Okay."</p>

  <p>The officer studied the beaten-dog glare in Noropa's eyes:</p>

  <p>"Did you have any trouble with this man?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever. Take care of him, please. I guess I'll need him."</p>

  <p>Hugging Noropa's poisoned dagger beneath his jacket, and carrying his own
  bag, Tom trudged away toward the monastery, humming to himself.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">CHAPTER 21.</a><br>
  "Quite a scholar, the old abbot."</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Ringding Gelong Monastery is a rather large one, built
  in the Tibetan style, with a great main building like a keep and a number of
  courtyards. It dates from the days when Darjeeling was within the political
  boundary ruled by the Maharajah of Sikkim. There were no railways in those
  days. So there are stables, in the first courtyard, for a great number of
  transport animals. Almost the first thing Tom noticed, as he did his
  greetings under the arch over the main entrance, was that the stables in the
  first courtyard were crowded with Tibetan ponies. There were more than forty
  obvious camp-followers squatting in groups in the yard, smelly fellows with
  their sheepskin jackets rolled up beside them. Loads by the dozen, roped and
  ready.</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain! Tum-Glain!" The sloe-eyed monk on duty at the gate was all
  smiles. He took Tom's bag and passed it to another monk.</p>

  <p>Tom was expected; they made that evident. They asked all the proper
  questions about his health and well-being, and they blessed him with
  countless blessings. But beyond that, they said nothing at all.</p>

  <p>He was led across two courtyards, in one of which some devil-dancers were
  practising. Their steps looked very comical without masks and costumes. They
  were being narrowly watched by twenty Tibetans who were seated with their
  backs against the wall, beneath a long wooden gallery that served as corridor
  for the cells and dormitories on the upper story. One was an obvious shaman
  of the type who wander all over Tibet, Turkestan and Mongolia, working fake
  magical cures, selling poison and telling fortunes. The men who sat near him
  looked like herdsmen.</p>

  <p>But one man sat apart. A B&ouml;n priest, six paces away from a sturdy-looking
  novice. They two were hooded mystery men&mdash;magicians&mdash;real
  practitioners of the black arts that survived the conversion of Tibet to
  Buddhism. There was no mistaking them. They were what Noropa craved to be.
  Insolent eyes. Lips that wouldn't care to tell the truth if they were offered
  for it all the plunder in the world.</p>

  <p>Until they noticed Tom's arrival all the others were as rapt as children
  at a picture-show, dividing their attention between the devil-dancers and the
  monks on the opposite roof who were extracting one another's beards with
  tweezers. But they two sat in meditation in the attitude that only B&ouml;n
  magicians can assume. It is acquired by years of self-torture, and it looks
  like a caricature of the posture of Buddhist saints.</p>

  <p>They had strange-looking luggage. It was certainly not Tibetan&mdash;or,
  at any rate, the baskets weren't. Those might have come from the Salween
  country in Upper Burma, where there is cane of which to make such things and
  a more or less Chinese idea of what cane can be fashioned to do. Shaped like
  flat loaves, to be slung on poles and borne by women, or to be mounted one on
  each side of a horse. The two biggest were round, like snake-charmers'
  baskets, only much bigger&mdash;cart-wheel diameter&mdash;with slightly domed
  lids, and neatly covered with waterproofed cloth. Nothing Tibetan about
  that.</p>

  <p>All the same, all those men were recently from Tibet. They bore all the
  signs of having come a long way, by forced marches. Except for the B&ouml;n
  magician and his novice, who sat motionless, they were all munching the last
  of their Tibetan cheese. On top of one basket was a hunk of yak-meat that
  stank like the devil; they had partly covered it with a scrap of cloth and
  the cloth was black with flies. All except the B&ouml;n magicians stared at Tom
  with the silent curiosity of nomads.</p>

  <p>Tom turned aside to speak to them. The B&ouml;n priest ignored him as if he
  didn't exist. So did the novice. He asked the others, in Tibetan, whose
  servants they were. They got up and stood between him and the big
  baskets.</p>

  <p>The monk came running and almost dragged Tom away. He led him up the
  well-remembered stone steps to the gallery. The B&ouml;n priest moved. Followed by
  his novice he went to the middle of the courtyard and got in the way of the
  dancers, in order to watch Tom as he walked the entire length of the gallery
  and turned down a passage toward where Abbot Mu-ni Gam-po's chamber faced the
  winds from the Roof of the World.</p>

  <p>Through a heavy teak door into the antechamber. That was nothing more than
  a wide, dim, masonry passage with a very small window and stone benches
  against the walls for the attendant monks. There were four monks. The most
  solemn of the four&mdash;he had ears that resembled the lugs on a cast-iron
  cooking-pot&mdash;entered the inner room and came out bowing. He dismissed
  Tom's guide with scant ceremony. The guide was evidently not a suitable
  person to enter that sanctum on a Thursday forenoon. Tom entered alone. The
  thick door thudded at his back.</p>

  <p>A weird light, from two arched windows wide apart in masonry walls many
  feet thick. Heavy roof beams in the gloom above the shafts of sunshine. An
  image of Chenrezi* against one wall, flanked by beautiful paintings of the
  Buddha. Two prayer wheels on a heavy table that was almost invisible in
  mid-room because of the difficult light. A prayer drum, in an iron frame on
  the floor, rigged up with a treadle and the free-wheel mechanism from a
  bicycle. Old Mu-ni Gam-po was notorious as an innovator, and a humorist to
  boot. The prayer drum had been given a good treadling, perhaps by the monk
  who had announced Tom; it went on spinning for two or three minutes; two or
  three hundred repetitions of the thousands of prayers written on little
  scraps of paper in the drum.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Chenrezi</i>&mdash;the Tibetan name of the
  Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, the patron deity of Tibet; the god of mercy and
  universal compassion. The Dalai Lama is considered to be an incarnation of
  Chenrezi. ]</p>

  <p>There were two men in the room, but the light was so baffling that he
  could only recognize one of them. Old Abbot Mu-ni Gam-po hadn't changed in
  the least. He stepped down from his dais between the windows, black-robed and
  benevolent, all smiles and blessings.</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain! Tum-Glain!"</p>

  <p>He was very stoop-shouldered from reading and writing all day long in a
  light that would have destroyed most men's eyesight. As thin as a wraith, all
  wrinkles. Big ears with long lobes. Big, good-humored eyes and a firm mouth.
  Skin the color of old parchment. Full of chuckles that shook his frail body.
  A deep voice:</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain! Tum-Glain!" Then in sonorous Tibetan: "O Nobly Born, a hundred
  thousand times a hundred thousand welcomes!"</p>

  <p>Two or three minutes (and Tom out of practise) of galloping Tibetan
  syllables, chained together into words a yard long that spilled themselves
  into sentences like sunlit water burbling over gravel. Then old Mu-ni Gam-po
  took Tom's hand and led him toward the farther window. In the shadow to one
  side of it the other man sat on a throne like the Abbot's, only smaller, of
  raised masonry spread with a woolen rug woven in Lhasa and blessed in
  Tashi-lunpo. Mu-ni Gam-po patted Tom between the shoulders as he introduced
  him to the son of sunlight, incarnation of Kun-fu-tse and blessed with
  millions of blessings&mdash;Norman Johnson!</p>

  <p>"How d'you do," he said gruffly, staring as if Tom hadn't any business to
  be there.</p>

  <p>Tom laughed. He went and treadled the prayer drum until it spun like an
  electric fan.</p>

  <p>"That's how," he answered. "I'm raring to go."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes?" said Johnson.</p>

  <p>His manner and appearance were the same as they had been in Delhi. There
  was the same sullen glower in his eyes, the same hectoring note in his voice,
  the same heft to his shoulders, even in repose, as if he were thrusting his
  way through a crowd.</p>

  <p>"Don't you ever sit down?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Tom went and sat on the deep window embrasure between him and Mu-ni
  Gam-po. There was nowhere else to sit, except the table or the floor. Mu-ni
  Gam-po struck a gong, commanded, and presently a monk brought in a chair. He
  set it facing the light. Tom moved it out of the wedge-shaped zone of
  sunlight and sat down where he could watch both men's faces as conveniently
  as they could watch his.</p>

  <p>Johnson glared at Tom as if he were some sort of strange animal under
  scrutiny. However, Tom didn't mind being stared at.</p>

  <p>"You interrupted a conversation," said Johnson, after at least a minute's
  silence. "The Reverend Abbot was giving me his views of the situation in
  Tibet. His Reverence, as I dare say you know, is a Yellow-hat Lama. His
  religious convictions impose upon him a consistently pacifistic attitude. The
  present state of anarchy in Tibet deeply grieves him. His constant prayers
  have inspired him, so he tells me, to keep this monastery open to all-comers,
  of whatever faction. Thus he keeps himself well informed of what is happening
  beyond the border. He would like to return to Tibet, to die in peace at
  Tashi-lunpo."</p>

  <p>He talked like a lecturer to a class of students of anatomy&mdash;as if
  there were a corpse in front of him and the students must listen whether they
  liked or not.</p>

  <p>"However," he continued, "should His Reverence return to Tibet, he might
  be murdered without having accomplished anything."</p>

  <p>He paused. He appeared to expect comment. Tom glanced at the Abbot:</p>

  <p>"What would happen to this monastery, if His Reverence should go away? No
  fat brethren as long as he's here! No unchaste ones who aren't whipped and
  given 'solitary.' None who dares to miss a midnight service! I've attended
  those services&mdash;cold&mdash;draughty&mdash;full ceremonial&mdash;no cuts.
  But he makes 'em like it."</p>

  <p>Mu-ni Gam-po beamed. Johnson shot a sudden question at Tom.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what happened to the Dalai Lama?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. They poisoned him."</p>

  <p>"Who did?"</p>

  <p>"Some of his own political gang in Lhasa."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"He was too pro-British, for one thing. Too sincere. Wouldn't stand for
  sending B&ouml;n monks to try to poison the exiled Tashi Lama. He was for letting
  the Tashi Lama return to Tibet."</p>

  <p>"How long were you in Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"Two years."</p>

  <p>"You knew the Dalai Lama, of course? I mean, you met him?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Tom, "they poisoned him. You can't ask him that, can
  you."</p>

  <p>"I am trying to discover where your prejudices lie, Mr. Grayne."</p>

  <p>"They don't lie," said Tom. "It's the truth, I haven't any. I'm here to
  listen."</p>

  <p>"I have been told you propose to return to Tibet."</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>"It is no business of mine," said Johnson. "My department is a purely
  decorative one. I assemble dry facts and write reports that no one reads. I
  understand you carry an American passport."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have it with me."</p>

  <p>"Do you know that there are laws and treaties specifically forbidding
  foreigners of almost every nationality from entering Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Tom, "I understand that."</p>

  <p>"The Indian Government has solemnly pledged itself not to permit British
  subjects to cross the Tibetan border."</p>

  <p>Tom sat silent. Mu-ni Gam-po appeared to have gone into meditation.
  Johnson resumed:</p>

  <p>"An Englishwoman, who marries an American, becomes an American citizen,
  doesn't she, Mr. Grayne?"</p>

  <p>Tom laughed. "Damned if I know. The laws are funny. She'd be eligible,
  under certain conditions. Go on. You're telling me."</p>

  <p>"No American," said Johnson, "can be classified as British. That might not
  hold in Tibet, where I imagine they don't know the difference. But we are
  under no treaty obligations to guard the Tibetan frontier against American
  citizens. We are equally under no obligation to protect Americans in
  Tibet."</p>

  <p>"Hell. D'you mean you wouldn't send the British fleet to Lhasa, over them
  thar hills?"</p>

  <p>Johnson rose abruptly. "I must go. I have an appointment. Will you see me
  to the stairhead?"</p>

  <p>"Come back, Tum-Glain. Come quick back," said Mu-ni Gam-po.</p>

  <p>Johnson shook hands with the Abbot and then lingered in the anteroom to
  talk with one of the attendant monks. Tom went ahead and waited midway along
  the gallery, where he watched the devil-dancers until Johnson overtook
  him.</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt?" asked Johnson. "You carry your left arm pretty close to
  your side."</p>

  <p>"No," said Tom. "I'm all right."</p>

  <p>Johnson shed his brusqueness: "Quite a scholar, the old Abbot. He is
  worried about some books in the British Museum. He wants them sent to him, to
  be returned to Tibet, on the ground that they're sacred and were stolen in
  the first instance. The request seems reasonable. I have put him in touch
  with Dr. Mayor. You know Mayor, I believe."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Tom, "I know him." He wasn't going to get garrulous just
  because a brusque ethnologist had suddenly turned civil.</p>

  <p>"Funny," said Johnson. "Old Mu-ni Gam-po wouldn't write to Mayor for fear
  his correspondence might be opened by the censor. We've a pretty drastic
  censorship in force, on account of the Indian Nationalist troubles and one
  thing and another. But that needn't have bothered him. I suppose he's touchy.
  I had to apply for authority to give him my personal word of honor that his
  letters won't be opened in transit." He stared at Tom. "Of course," he added,
  "we never censor anything that comes from Tibet addressed to Mu-ni Gam-po
  himself. If we did, he'd soon know it. He might retaliate by ceasing to keep
  us informed, and that'ud be awkward. Those rogues down below us, for
  instance, have undoubtedly brought him secret news. If it's important he'll
  drop us a hint. Do you know any one in Dorking?"</p>

  <p>"I did," Tom answered. He looked as suddenly casual as a hunter who sees
  his quarry with the side of his eye.</p>

  <p>Johnson smiled. "Dangerous place, Dorking. Lots of traffic accidents.
  Police there are very officious."</p>

  <p>Tom reciprocated promptly. He could hardly have asked for a plainer
  hint.</p>

  <p>"Thank you. Speaking of police," he said, "some of your men might
  recognize this." He produced Noropa's dagger from under his left arm.
  "Careful! It's poisoned."</p>

  <p>"Found that, did you? May I have it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Tom. "If you can't find its original owner, label it a
  souvenir from&mdash;" he began to spell it, pausing on the second
  letter&mdash;"D&mdash;o&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dorking! Yes, yes. I must show this to Abdul Mirza. He arrived this
  morning to discuss the mysterious death of a Japanese merchant. Abdul Mirza
  knows some one who is rather an authority on unusual weapons and rare
  poisons. You know Abdul Mirza?"</p>

  <p>"Good guy."</p>

  <p>"Very. To all intents and purposes he governs Naini Kol. I must get him to
  ask his scientific friend about this thing&mdash;dagger would you call
  it?&mdash;before the&mdash;ah&mdash;scientific friend goes into retirement.
  Abdul Mirza tells me you know Lobsang Pun."</p>

  <p>"Know him? The old hellion booted me out of Tibet. Damn his eyes, he
  waited until it was almost a cinch I'd be caught by winter in the
  passes."</p>

  <p>"So you're enemies, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I like him first rate," Tom answered. "The man's a gentleman. He wouldn't
  stoop to dirty murder. But he'd laugh like hell if you or I should run into
  something we couldn't buck. Then he'd pray for our souls, to a bunch of
  saints who know what humor is. He's a high altitude, high church
  humorist."</p>

  <p>"He's a dangerous man," said Johnson. "If old Lobsang Pun could have
  persuaded the Japanese to do the fighting for him, the Tashi Lama would be
  spiritual ruler of Asia, with all the temporal power that Lobsang Pun could
  filch for him. But the Japanese, as I understand it, turned him down. Both
  sides wanted too much, I imagine. Such men as Lobsang Pun make bitter
  enemies. If he should happen to be murdered while he's under our protection,
  there'd be hell to pay. But who knows which his enemies are?" He changed the
  subject abruptly:</p>

  <p>"I hope the police didn't give you a scare this morning, Mr. Grayne. The
  station-master phoned them from Siliguri, so something had to be done in the
  way of eyewash."</p>

  <p>"Scaring me wouldn't matter," said Tom. "I'm used to it. But third degree
  would&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tut-tut, man, we never use it. In special cases, to prevent anything of
  that sort, it's the rule for an officer to keep a prisoner under continuous
  observation. That Noropa person is a mean customer. It was just as well to
  lock him up until we could discuss him with you. We don't want an American
  citizen murdered in India. Your State Department could be very unpleasant
  about it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, they wouldn't bother about me," said Tom. "I may need Noropa."</p>

  <p>"You may have him&mdash;delivered, if you like, in cellophane. Simply
  press the button."</p>

  <p>"If they should tell him he was being let go as a personal favor to me,
  he'd come and find me. He's feeling friendly at the moment."</p>

  <p>"Very well. But he'd better be shadowed, or he might double back. We don't
  want him in Delhi."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for the tip about how to get my mail through."</p>

  <p>"Not at all. You may count on that. You'll reciprocate, of course?"</p>

  <p>"You bet."</p>

  <p>"Anything addressed to me in Delhi, in any kind of envelope marked Secret,
  reaches me unopened. Thunder Dragon Gate! Where is it? What is it? Why is it?
  Facts, if you please, Mr. Grayne. And don't get bumped off. It isn't you I'm
  thinking of."</p>

  <p>"Sure. I get you."</p>

  <p>"Well then, good luck."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, and same to you."</p>

  <p>Johnson turned away abruptly and strode along the gallery toward the stone
  stairs. Tom turned the other way, toward the Abbot's chamber. Neither man
  glanced back ward. Tom was humming to himself. His stride was vigorous
  &mdash;springy&mdash;the stride of a man who smells the wind and sees the
  long trail open.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">CHAPTER 22.</a><br>
  "Fine."</h2>

  <p class="first">TOM lost no time about eliminating Dorking from his line of
  communication. Abbot Mu-ni Gam-po was delighted to have him draft a letter in
  English to Professor Mayor. The Abbot copied the letter, in beautiful
  handwriting, taking nearly an hour to do it. He enclosed with it, in the same
  sealed envelop, one in Tom's handwriting that Mayor's deaf-and-dumb filing
  clerk would know what to do with.</p>

  <p>Carefully written with one of Mu-ni Gam-po's fine pens, it covered two
  sheets of closely written paper. The fine pen-point went through the paper
  here and there. Mayor would read the letter and toss it to the deaf-and-dumb
  Pole to be filed away. The Pole would transcribe the pen-pricked letters
  only. They would then read:</p>

  <p class="letter">Eiji Sarao dead. Jap system may be out of gear for time
  being. Indian Government Number One using me and in return guarantees my mail
  by this route secret. Leaving for Tibet. Pronto.</p>

  <p>The Polish filing clerk would add to that message the words "No. 88 to No.
  1" and would mail it, in a plain envelope, to an address in the west of
  London. It would reach Washington sooner or later.</p>

  <p>The next thing was to get Mu-ni Gam-po to act as secret postmaster and to
  protect all letters with his big Tibetan seal. That had to be done tactfully.
  Very Reverend Abbots, even more than other people, mustn't let the right hand
  know the good or evil that the left is doing. It says so, definitely, in
  nearly all the sacred scriptures, of all nations.</p>

  <p>So there was patiently copious conversation, cordial, evasive of the
  issue, guarded. The Abbot continually questioned Tom about European politics.
  Tom knew not much more about those than he had read in the papers. In fact,
  the Abbot knew more than he did. Tom kept returning to the subject of the
  Tibetan books in the British Museum, little by little increasing the stress
  on the fact that he was intimately friendly with Professor Mayor. The Abbot
  wished to be told about President Roosevelt.</p>

  <p>They had drunk not less than twenty cups of tea apiece, and it was growing
  dark; they had discussed the probable action of the League of Nations in
  regard to Italy and Ethiopia, the behavior of Japan in Manchukuo, and the
  state of religion in Russia; Tom had had to struggle to explain the New Deal
  in the United States (it was the first time he had ever seriously tried to
  understand it!) before Mu-ni Gam-po gently and persuasively suggested that,
  if Tom should write now and then to Professor Mayor, and if he, the humble
  Abbot Mu-ni Gam-po should forward the letters, perhaps Professor Mayor might
  be thereby reminded to employ a little of his illustrious influence to
  procure the return of the stolen sacred books. That settled that. They
  understood each other without having swapped any naive confidences. Not even
  Tom would be able to swear that the Abbot knew what was going on.</p>

  <p>Then solemn ceremony in the monastery chapel, Tom looking down from the
  gloom of the heavily beamed gallery. A lamp-lit altar, spread with the Eight
  Happy Symbols and large incense pots. A great stone image of Chenrezi,
  twenty-five feet high, between smaller images of Padma Sambhava and Atisa.
  The entire dimness hung with painted banners. Rows on rows of half-seen monks
  all bowed in the flickering shadows cast by scores of tiny oil lamps. At
  intervals they laid their foreheads on the floor in adoration. Gongs. Horns.
  A tinkling silver bell. A murmur, a drone that swelled into a chant and died
  away, to be awakened again by Mu-ni Gam-po's golden voice. In his robes, in
  the lamp-lit dimness, the old Abbot looked like a wooden carving come to
  life; his acolytes and ministering monks, patient though they were, in
  comparison resembled lively worldlings in a hurry to be through with ceremony
  and receive their blessing. There was no sign of the B&ouml;n magician's party,
  though they might have been beneath the gallery, where Tom couldn't have seen
  them.</p>

  <p>After that, the evening meal in the dim refectory. The old Abbot ate
  supper alone; not even for Tum-Glain would he set aside that rule. Tom filed
  into the refectory behind the hooded monks, all two by two, and took his seat
  near the door. Prayer. Blessing. Silence, save for the sound of munching and
  the noise of spoons and platters. Tea, cheese, barley bread. Good grub. Tom
  was used to it. He had long ago learned how to chew the lightly cooked grain
  so that, like the monks, he needed not enough of it to bloat him, though he
  ate enough to leave the table feeling fit for a forced march.</p>

  <p>Again, not a sign of the B&ouml;n magician's party. Perhaps, as rank heretics
  and blasphemers, they were being fed in the outer courtyard along with the
  stablemen and horsemen.</p>

  <p>Prayer, quite a lot of that. Blessing, a bit quick and perfunctory. Then
  up the stone stair to the guest cell, along a passage leading from the
  gallery between two long dormitories, fifty yards from the Abbot's chamber at
  the other corner of the building. Good clean quarters, though a trifle
  draughty from the small, square, unglazed windows that faced the Himalayas.
  Plain stone walls and floor. A truckle bed. A chair. A little table. A lamp
  in a niche in the wall. A strip of matting. A teak door two inches thick,
  without a lock but with a peephole for the dutiful-observant-brother-
  going-rounds-approving-silent-meditation-and-no-visiting-
  each-other-in-the-night.</p>

  <p>The sound of a bell about every fifteen minutes.
  Dutiful-observant-brother's eye, and then his big mouth at the peephole and
  his knuckles on the teak:</p>

  <p style="text-align:left">"Blessed-night-of-celebration-of-wonder-working-
  incarnation-of-the-precious-Lord-Avalokitesvara-whose-mission-
  is-to-liberate-humanity-from-the-Eight-Great-Perils-humbly-
  make-your-meditation-before-midnight-service."</p>

  <p>Thud-thud again on the teak and the slap on stone of
  dutiful-observant-brother's retreating sandals. Thud-thud on another door,
  and another, and another. A monk might sleep if he could.</p>

  <p>Then the weather again, not the climate. Darjeeling actually boasts of a
  hundred inches of rain in June. But it wasn't June. It was merely getting
  ready for June, six weeks ahead. The rain came down in swishing torrents that
  cascaded to the courtyard flags until night was all one tumult of crashing
  and gurgling water.</p>

  <p>Damp walls, as cold as the devil. Meditation indicated. Tom, in two shirts
  and his sleeved leather waistcoat, was meditating where to buy the necessary
  garments for the venture into Tibet, when he heard a clatter in the inner
  courtyard that sounded more like stones being thrown from the roof than
  falling rain. A twenty-foot radong* blared like a fog horn. Shouts.
  Hoof-beats&mdash;couldn't be anything else: the walls re-echoed them until
  they sounded like a regiment of horse arriving.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Radong</i> (Tibetan)&mdash;a long, trumpet-like
  ritual instrument with a bell-shaped end. Often telescopic. ]</p>

  <p>Tom made his way to the gallery by torchlight reflected off the wet walls
  of the courtyard. A fabulous scene. Some of the light was electric&mdash;one
  of Mu-ni Gam-po's innovations, very good for discovering monks up to mischief
  in holes and corners. Economical, too: penalty-of-work-in-meditation-
  time-on-monastery-woodpile-paying-cost-of-batteries-for-torches.</p>

  <p>Seen through the rain from above, the electric torches and the spluttering
  pine-knots weirdly suggested a wet night in Trafalgar Square. There were
  things that suggested Landseer's lions, dripping wet. In place of Nelson's
  Column in the midst, there was a man on horseback.</p>

  <p>Couldn't possibly mistake that man&mdash;even from above, in pouring rain,
  near midnight&mdash;even under that pointed black hood, on a steaming horse,
  beneath a small black canopy on long poles held by four men, that kept him
  liberally splashed with water from its tasseled fringe whenever the horse
  moved or the bearers fell out of step. He was riding forward across the
  courtyard toward the gallery, dead slow.</p>

  <p>The things that looked at first like Landseer's lions revealed themselves
  after a moment or two as enormous, shapeless loads covered by black
  tarpaulins. Six or eight men&mdash;a confusion of legs&mdash;staggered
  beneath each.</p>

  <p>There were monks on the run, all hooded, with their robes up and the
  torchlight gleaming on wet bare thighs and calves. Greetings. A great howdydo
  of obeisance. A big yellow umbrella that wouldn't come open was being made
  ready by monks who struggled against gusty squalls at the foot of the gallery
  stairs. Even the Lord Abbot of a Ringding Gelong Monastery must be summoned
  from his bed, or meditation as the case may be, to do the honors for such a
  prelate as the Most Reverend and Holy Lobsang Pun.</p>

  <p>It was he all right. He bulked on the back of the horse like a black
  balloon, but he sat the saddle like an experienced horseman. The
  thrice-blessed horse was a little bit gone in the knees and looked inclined
  to kneel and pray beneath the staggering weight. But the total effect was
  magnificent.</p>

  <p>Tom stared. Lobsang Pun on the march meant climax. It meant that one of
  Asia's dynamic geniuses had decided to forge an event or two, instead of
  waiting for Time and Destiny to do it.</p>

  <p>Mu-ni Gam-po passed, followed by his four attendants, hurrying along the
  gallery. They took no notice of Tom. They had passed him a minute ago; he was
  leaning, head and shoulders in the rain, with his elbows on the rail, when he
  felt a touch on his shoulder. He didn't turn. Probably one of the monks had
  been sent to tell him to keep out of sight. He stole the last second to stare
  at the scene.</p>

  <p>"So you're Tum-Glain, are you! I asked for Mr. Tom Grayne and they
  corrected my pronunciation!"</p>

  <p>"Elsa! Well, thank the Lord! Where's Th&ouml;-pa-ga?"</p>

  <p>"At Nancy Strong's."</p>

  <p>"How is he?"</p>

  <p>"Moony. But he's better. He began to get better as soon as we started to
  climb from Siliguri."</p>

  <p>"Moony? About you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And he's afraid to go to Tibet. He's like a man awaiting execution.
  Nancy Strong offered to keep him as a teacher in her school, but he
  says&mdash;you know his funny phrases&mdash;spiritual things might happen.
  What he means is, he's afraid of shang-shang sendings. He's afraid they would
  wish them on Nancy Strong."</p>

  <p>"She lend you the waterproof? It's nearly big enough for Lobsang Pun! Who
  brought you here?"</p>

  <p>"I came. I didn't need to be brought. I held Lobsang Pun's horse's tail.
  He didn't mind. Nancy Strong says you will send me back to England.
  Tom&mdash;please!"</p>

  <p>"How did you come from Delhi?"</p>

  <p>"Some one's carriage to the Edith Cavell Hospital, I don't know whose.
  Then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why did you go to the hospital?"</p>

  <p>"Dr. Lewis asked me to, at Dowlah's house, when he was testing my
  blood-pressure. He didn't test it seriously. What he wanted to do was to
  talk. I didn't see him at the hospital. He was operating, or so the head
  night-nurse said. They brought Th&ouml;-pa-ga down&mdash;he was hysterical, he was
  so glad to see me&mdash;and the carriage took us about twenty minutes' drive
  through dark streets to a place where a big closed Daimler car was waiting.
  Some one had brought my bag from the hotel and paid the bill, the receipt was
  on top of the bag, tucked under the strap. We were off in a minute. It was a
  perfectly wonderful drive, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Before that happened, did Dowlah send you with a message to Lobsang
  Pun?"</p>

  <p>"No. Abdul Mirza's servant did. He begged me not to mention Dowlah, so I
  didn't. He asked me to go with Noropa, in a closed carriage, and say that
  Eiji Sarao was dying and must speak to Lobsang Pun before it was too late.
  The house we went to seemed to be heavily guarded. We drove through so many
  streets in the dark that I haven't the slightest idea where it was. The walls
  were hung with Tibetan pictures. Lobsang Pun turned out to be the man to whom
  Eiji Sarao had introduced me through a panel in the wall of a shop in the
  Chandni Chowk that afternoon. Tom, it was fun. I loved it. All intriguey.
  Lobsang Pun&mdash;enormous&mdash;like a great gorilla in a black
  robe&mdash;in a rather dark room, all lined with carved wood. Of course I
  knew Eiji Sarao wasn't really dying. I lied to a most reverend and holy
  prelate! Wasn't that awful? He could speak pretty good English, and he asked
  me lots of questions about Th&ouml;-pa-ga."</p>

  <p>"Did he speak to Noropa?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He cursed him. He called some one and ordered Noropa driven from the
  house. They treated Noropa pretty roughly. I felt sorry for him, though on
  the way in the carriage he had done his best to scare me. He kept looking
  into my eyes. He kept repeating one sentence: 'Telling Lob sang Pun Noropa
  brought you! Telling Lobsang Pun Noropa brought you!' I think he tried to
  hypnotize me, but perhaps he's mad. Anyhow, I didn't say Noropa had brought
  me. The last I saw of Noropa was when he was thrown out of that house into a
  dark street. Lobsang Pun came with me in the carriage, back to Dowlah's
  house, and another carriage followed us, full of, I think, Tibetans. They all
  had weapons, and excepting Lobsang Pun they all acted scared. Lobsang Pun
  seemed just the opposite of scared. He treated me like a favorite niece or
  something. He held my hand all the way in the carriage and kept patting it
  and laughing."</p>

  <p>"So you were in Dowlah's house when Lobsang Pun was in there?"</p>

  <p>"No, I wasn't. Abdul Mirza met me at the front door and took me back to
  the carriage. He leaned through the window and said 'Be clever, sweet maid,
  and let who will be good. Open your eyes and shut your mouth, be kind to
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga, and you shall see where King George will send you!' He told the
  coachman where to drive, and the next thing I was at the hospital, where I
  knew what to do."</p>

  <p>"You did well," said Tom. "Did Dowlah proposition you at any time?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. All through dinner. He was rather good at it. He has an original
  line. I couldn't consult you of course, so I pretended to be awfully thrilled
  but rather scared."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you come here first?" Tom asked. "Why did you go to Nancy
  Strong's house?"</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't I have? Th&ouml;-pa-ga wanted to go there. Dr. Lewis had advised it,
  though he said I should probably find you here. It was awfully late, but
  Nancy Strong seemed to expect us. She had food ready, and two bedrooms
  prepared. She expected me to stay the night. But Tom, her account of her
  conversation with you in the train&mdash;I couldn't stay still until I had
  asked you about it. She said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How did you meet Lobsang Pun again?"</p>

  <p>"He came to Nancy Strong's house on horseback. I've no idea where he came
  from. He may have overtaken us in another auto during the night. Or he may
  have come by plane. I simply don't know. He demanded to see Th&ouml;-pa-ga, who
  was already in bed, so Nancy Strong took him to Th&ouml;-pa-ga's bedroom, and I
  don't know what happened. I should say he was alone with Th&ouml;-pa-ga for at
  least half an hour. Nancy Strong told me Lobsang Pun was coming here to see
  Mu-ni Gam-po. She said she was glad he was leaving her house, because his
  enemies are after him and there might be serious trouble. So I borrowed her
  waterproof, and I didn't ask Lobsang Pun's leave or anything. I just held on
  to his horse's tail, because it was dark and I could hardly force my way
  against the rain. I'm wet, but here I am. And now, Tom, tell me."</p>

  <p>He met her eyes and spoke bluntly:</p>

  <p>"I have promised to do my best to persuade you to return to England."</p>

  <p>Elsa waited several seconds before she answered. Her face, in the
  reflected torchlight, was a picture of alarm&mdash;wide-eyed. She didn't
  flinch, but her voice changed:</p>

  <p>"Tom, do you think that's honorable?"</p>

  <p>Tom's voice had changed, too: "I can't go back on a promise."</p>

  <p>A pause&mdash;bleak, grim, gusty&mdash;eyes to eyes in semi-darkness.</p>

  <p>"How about your promise to me?"</p>

  <p>Thunder and lightning cannonaded for sixty seconds be fore he could
  answer:</p>

  <p>"That was conditional."</p>

  <p>He writhed. He knew he couldn't keep her from detecting it. He knew the
  keenness of her enthusiasm, the sharpness of her disappointment. He could
  guess how she felt by how he himself felt. That was why he had set his jaw
  and raised his voice to make it harshly penetrate the noise of splashing and
  of voices echoed off the courtyard walls. Even in his own ears it sounded
  cruel.</p>

  <p>Lobsang Pun and Mu-ni Gam-po, followed by a dozen monks, were coming up
  the stone stairway. He took Elsa's arm and almost hustled her into the dark
  passage that led toward his cell. There he faced her again. It wasn't easier,
  even so, where he could hardly see her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Conditional on the marriage being secret," he said. "It isn't. They know
  it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered. "Nancy Strong didn't say so, but I knew she knew it,
  from the way she spoke about your conversation on the train." She laid her
  hands on his forearms. "Tom&mdash;do you believe I told?"</p>

  <p>"No. I know you didn't."</p>

  <p>"Did you tell?"</p>

  <p>"No. But I've admitted it. They've checked back. Simply routine, that.
  Punch a button nowadays, and you can find out anything, about anybody. The
  gaff's blown, Elsa."</p>

  <p>"Tom, are you being fair? Have I failed you? Is there any reason, that we
  didn't discuss before we left England, why you should order me home now?"</p>

  <p>"No, by God," he answered. "Damn the woman. I told her flat I wouldn't
  order you home."</p>

  <p>"Then I won't go."</p>

  <p>"Fine," said Tom. "That settles that. Tell her I kept my promise."</p>

  <p>She laughed, suddenly, gaily. "Tom, you're&mdash;Please forgive me. I was
  scared. I was afraid I hadn't made good. I should have know you wouldn't use
  a trick to get rid of me. She didn't say so, but she made me think you had
  asked her to have me sent home."</p>

  <p>"Hold on to yourself," he answered. "Scares have hardly begun. Eiji Sarao
  is dead&mdash;of a shang-shang bite. They've canned Dowlah&mdash;caught him
  double-crossing every one, I don't doubt. They have okayed you, unless Nancy
  Strong should report unfavorably and I don't think she will. They've given me
  my head and all the privilege I could ask. I have Noropa by the short hair.
  I've a line on where the Thunder Dragon Gate is. Now we go to the mat with
  Lobsang Pun. The old bird's a top-notcher, so there won't be any easy
  show-down. He's the Tashi Lama's political chief of staff. He's the Tibetan
  Number One. When Number One steps out, there's trouble. If his enemies are
  out to get him, that's my answer to all the prayers I've prayed since I was
  your size. You'd better stay and see the midnight ceremony. Are you too wet?
  Are you tired? Wait, I'll get a blanket for you. If we're in the gallery
  before the show begins there'll be no questions asked."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">CHAPTER 23.</a><br>
  "They're taking Th&ouml;-Pa-Ga away!"</h2>

  <p class="first">THE dark gallery ran the entire length of one side of the
  chapel. It was so high up under the roof that Tom could touch the rafters. No
  lamps up there, but there was plenty to look at if one could only see it.
  Wood carving. Pictures. His little pocket flash-light hardly served to show
  the details of a Tantric Hell depicted on a panel on the rear wall. A sound,
  while he and Elsa were looking at that, drew his attention to the fact that
  they were not alone in the gallery. He left her in the dark and went to
  investigate.</p>

  <p>The B&ouml;n magician, his novice, the shaman and four more of the party he had
  seen in the courtyard, were grouped together at the far end, in the darkest
  corner. They had had to move the benches to make room for their two big
  baskets covered with black waterproofing. They stirred like evil birds
  disturbed by the pin-ray light. The shaman spoke, in Tibetan. He said nothing
  polite. Tom didn't answer. There was nothing to be gained by trying to make
  conversation. He groped his way back to Elsa and they went to the opposite
  end of the gallery overlooking the high altar. The benches were too low for
  any one seated to see over the rail to the floor below, so they leaned on the
  breast-high rail.</p>

  <p>There were little lights on the altar, and two big lamps at the opposite
  end, but all the middle of the chapel was in darkness until two monks
  entered, one with an electric torch to show the other where to use his taper
  on a long pole. They lighted all the little oil-lamps in the niches in the
  walls, and in the iron lanterns hanging from the beams, until the chapel was
  aswim with smoky light that spread rich shadows flickering amid colored
  banners and upon the calm features of Chenrezi above the high altar. But it
  was almost as dark as before, up there in the gallery.</p>

  <p>After a while the gallery door squeaked open and thudded shut. Footsteps.
  Stealthy. No slap of sandals. Tom used his flash-light. It wasn't bigger than
  a cigarette-case; it made a circle of light about two feet in diameter.</p>

  <p>In the midst of that appeared Noropa's death-mask face&mdash;Noropa's
  eyes, like a cat's. He was smiling&mdash;the first smile Tom had seen on that
  humorless face&mdash;wan, hideous, a bit pitiful, unpleasant. He came
  forward, making very little noise for such a tall, strong, awkward specimen.
  He thrust his face close to Tom's, stuttered and then spoke with more than
  his usual breathless speed, as if a thousand syllables could form only one
  word:</p>

  <p style="text-align:left">
  "My-not-knowing-you-such-very-Number-One-man-they-letting-
  me-go-saying-you-demanding. Now-my-understanding-you-plotecting-my-
  obeying."</p>

  <p>The man was trembling with excitement, or relief, or anxiety&mdash;or
  perhaps with all three. He could speak English better than that when he was
  in a normal condition.</p>

  <p>"What did the police do to you?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p style="text-align:left">
  "Nothing-only-telling-me-your-being-Number-One-Amelikan.
  My-being-glad-plotection-and-obeying-Number-One."</p>

  <p>"Go and find out what's in those baskets. Come back and tell me."</p>

  <p>Tom drew Elsa close to him. She snuggled and he felt for given for
  suggesting she should go home. He laid his hand on her neck to feel if she
  was shivering with cold. She wasn't. He found her hand and used their private
  code:</p>

  <p>"Giving Noropa his chance. That man in the far corner is a black
  magician&mdash;B&ouml;n&mdash;perhaps a hot wire."</p>

  <p>"Do you trust Noropa?"</p>

  <p>"Too friendly all of a sudden."</p>

  <p>Monks began filing in, two by two, until the floor below resembled a dark
  carpet of bowed heads. At the far end, facing the altar, a raised stone
  platform was left clear. The wall behind it was hung with pictures of Tibetan
  saints. Old Mu-ni Gam-po, followed by acolytes and ministrants, entered to
  the sound of a gong and weird wind-music that accompanied a chant. He took
  his seat on the high-backed throne-chair beside the altar. Motionless, in
  heavy vestments, he looked like a carving in old wood and ivory. One monk,
  seated beside a flat drum, which he tapped with a strangely irregular beat,
  intoned a hymn. Most of the words went lost amid the rafters. But it wasn't a
  regular Buddhist hymn. It sounded more like a ballad describing miraculous
  feats by the followers of the holy saint Avalokitesvara, against the sinful
  minions of the Eight Great Perils. Decidedly not pacifistic poetry. Mu-ni
  Gam-po looked ill at ease. The monks kept glancing at each other.</p>

  <p>Silence, as if something had gone wrong. It lasted two or three minutes.
  The noise of rain and wind from the courtyard suggested a storm at sea. There
  was a sudden booming blare of radongs&mdash;twenty-foot long trumpets. All
  the monks' faces turned toward a door beneath the gallery. There was thudding
  and commotion, but Tom and Elsa couldn't lean over far enough to see what
  caused it. The devil-dancers appeared&mdash;sixteen of them, two abreast, in
  grotesque devil-masks and full costume.</p>

  <p>Tom signaled to Elsa: "Something fishy. Devil-dancing is done outdoors.
  Looks to me like trouble brewing. Tibetan monks are scrappers when they're
  roused."</p>

  <p>"Would they fight in here?" she answered.</p>

  <p>"Fight anywhere, like hornets. Rouse 'em, that's all."</p>

  <p>The monks had to make way for the devil-dancers, who forced quite a wide
  passage down the midst of the chapel, dancing a curious, stealthy step, in a
  formation that opened and closed like scissor-blades. The same step
  constantly repeated. Behind them came a heavy palanquin, borne on poles by
  eight monks. It was a closed, old-fashioned thing, held together by big
  wooden pegs inserted into tongues protruding through slots in the woodwork.
  Its shape looked almost Chinese. But the dragon, on the panel that could be
  seen from the gallery, wasn't Chinese. It was a crudely painted monster with
  a devil's face and eight legs, belching a crimson fury of flame through a
  long snout that was almost like a trumpet.</p>

  <p>Elsa signaled Tom: "The monks look scared."</p>

  <p>"Hold on to yourself," he answered. "Don't talk. Watch. Keep close to
  me."</p>

  <p>She crowded herself against him, so that he shouldn't have to look for
  her. He put his arm around her.</p>

  <p>Behind the palanquin&mdash;at a noticeable distance behind it&mdash;
  walked Lobsang Pun. He was preceded by one attendant bearing a bronze dorje
  on a cushion&mdash;a thing shaped like a thunder-bolt. It meant that he
  represented the Tashi Lama. He was dressed in the full robes of a Yellow-hat
  lamaistic hierarch, including cone-shaped hood. He looked enormous. He took
  long strides, slowly, that made his robes sway, so he looked arrogant.</p>

  <p>He paused, exactly in the middle of the chapel and faced the high altar,
  until his eight attendant monks had formed into a group behind him. Then,
  with convincing reverence, he bowed before the image of Chenrezi. Nothing
  could have been more decorous, meek, dignified. He appeared unconscious of
  the disturbance behind him. One of his attendants slapped a monk belonging to
  the monastery who hadn't backed out of the way fast enough. There was quite a
  scuffle. Lobsang Pun marched forward toward the high altar, followed by only
  seven attendants; the eighth was being carried out, apparently stunned by a
  blow on the head. He bowed to Mu-ni Gam-po and then seated himself on a
  throne like the Abbot's, on the other side of the altar, with his attendants
  grouped on his left hand.</p>

  <p>Elsa whispered: "Do you notice the Abbot's face?"</p>

  <p>Tom signaled: "Shut up! Watch!"</p>

  <p>The palanquin was carried to the dais at the far end of the chapel. The
  bearers' clothing was slightly different from that of Mu-ni Gam-po's
  congregation. They might perhaps be Lobsang Pun's men. As they raised the
  palanquin to the dais one of them slipped on the stone. He fell and was
  soundly kicked in the ribs by one of Mu-ni Gam-po's monks. He seized the
  monk's leg in both hands and bit it. He was kicked in the face. The palanquin
  almost toppled over, but a monk with a sharp stick came and restored order,
  prodding as if he were driving animals to market. He was a very efficient
  person, competent to prod the right man at the proper moment. The palanquin
  was lifted to the dais and planted there facing the altar with its poles
  removed. The devil-dancers, on the floor to right and left of it, swayed and
  gestured. They appeared not to be illustrating any midnight adoration
  theme.</p>

  <p>Abbot Mu-ni Gam-po looked like a man in the seat of torture. His face was
  a picture of impotent indignation. He raised his right hand. One of his
  acolytes struck a gong. There was a subdued blare of horns. There began the
  regular midnight ritual, more than vaguely resembling High Mass droned by
  long-used, rather listless voices. But Lobsang Pun's voice was as clear as a
  bell. He led the chanting. By the vigor of his reverence he re-created a
  sensation of mystical midnight devotion. The ritual grew real.</p>

  <p>"Arbitrary old devil," Tom signaled to Elsa. "Champion churchman. Hellion.
  Humorist. I bet his plan is to commit Mu-ni Gam-po to something the old chap
  disapproves. But I think there's trouble brewing."</p>

  <p>Noropa groped his way back stealthily. He appeared excited. He came to
  Tom's left side and whispered.</p>

  <p>"Their-saying-baskets-containing-relics-for-blessing-by-
  Holy-Lobsang-Pun-when-this-service-finishing."</p>

  <p>Tom signaled to Elsa: "Beats me how that B&ouml;n magician got in here
  unchallenged. He wears a Japanese dagger. I saw the hilt. Think he must have
  told Mu-ni Gam-po he is Lobsang Pun's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Perhaps has a forged document.
  I bet he's laying for Lobsang Pun. You're going to see some magic. Fold that
  blanket so that you can spread it wide in a second, then wrap it back on your
  shoulders."</p>

  <p>Noropa whispered again. He thought Tom hadn't heard; he seemed more
  excited than ever. The second hymn ceased. It was time for the homily. Mu-ni
  Gam-po should have delivered that, but Lobsang Pun seemed to be stealing the
  show. One of his attendants brought him a sacred book and laid it opened on
  his lap.</p>

  <p>There fell a silence so intense that there seemed to be no wall to deaden
  the splashing of rain. Lobsang Pun leaned forward in the teacher's attitude,
  one elbow on his knee, and read a long text from very ancient scripture.
  Mu-ni Gam-po perceptibly shuddered. The very last word of the text,
  pronounced slowly, distinctly, with an even stress on each syllable, was like
  three distinct words of command:</p>

  <p>"The name of him whose spoken word in Thunder Dragon Gate shall move men's
  minds and stir their hearts, so that these things shall come to pass, shall
  be like unto the Holy Spirit that directs his sayings: TH&Ouml;-PA-GA!
  (wonderful-to-hear.)"</p>

  <p>He paused. At the far end of the chapel some one opened the palanquin. The
  leaves of the double door banged sharply against the sides. Every head in the
  chapel faced suddenly in that direction. Within the palanquin, motionless,
  looking like a dead man except that his eyelids moved, sat Th&ouml;-pa-ga. The
  devil-dancers had not ceased swaying. Their monotonous motion emphasized
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga's stillness. Two monks directed flash-lights at Th&ouml;-pa-ga's face.
  His eyes shone like dark jewels.</p>

  <p>Mu-ni Gam-po stood up. Tom gripped Elsa's hand to signal to her. There was
  all the electric suspense that precedes sudden bloodshed. A sensation of
  resented sacrilege, increased and heated by Lobsang Pun's air of triumph.</p>

  <p>Lobsang Pun hove himself up from his throne-chair. Be fore Mu-ni Gam-po
  could forestall him by dismissing the monks to their cells as he seemed to
  intend, Lobsang Pun stole the thunder. His magnificent voice rang through the
  chapel. In the name of His Holiness the Tashi Lama he proclaimed Th&ouml;-pa-ga
  the Keeper of the Thunder Dragon Gate, the Mouthpiece and the Voice of
  Prophecy, the Sender-forth&mdash;</p>

  <p>Even he had to cease. Even his beaked, belligerent, triumphant face froze.
  Not a doubt of it: he wasn't pretending. He was struck dumb. Horror.
  Amazement. All eyes followed his.</p>

  <p>A gasp of fear struck like a gust of wind and died away into ghastly
  silence. Three hundred prayer wheels were snatched from girdles and set
  whirling. Three hundred monks backed away in a wave toward the wall that
  faced the gallery. The rear ranks kicked and struck at those in front to save
  themselves from being crushed.</p>

  <p>A shang-shang was on the chapel wall, midway between Th&ouml;-pa-ga and the far
  end of the gallery. It was motionless, except that its mandibles moved.
  Elsa's hand clutched Tom's.</p>

  <p>He signaled: "Opportunity!"</p>

  <p>The brute was hugely bigger than the one that had escaped from Dowlah's
  house. Its livid green body was about three feet long. The spread of its
  hairy legs was not less than ten feet, perhaps twelve. In the basket it must
  have curled them in under itself. Crab, spider, octopus, all three, and devil
  features added. Its eyes were horrors of the size of tea-plates, motionless,
  without irises. They looked like opalescent sores. Its snout was a foot long;
  the moving mandibles beneath it seemed to be wiping one another in
  preparation for a meal.</p>

  <p>About a hundred monks threw themselves prostrate on the chapel floor. Old
  Abbot Mu-ni Gam-po was the first to break silence. He began to chant a
  mantram. His voice broke, but two hundred monks took up the mantram. In a
  moment the roof was booming to the chant. It appeared to annoy the
  shang-shang. It moved like a spider up and down the wall, then suddenly,
  almost too swiftly for eye to follow, it shot sideways, and became still
  again directly over Th&ouml;-pa-ga's head. Th&ouml;-pa-ga didn't move; he was like a
  man in a trance. Some fool blew a radong. Two monks turned their flash-lights
  on the monster.</p>

  <p>The flash-lights seemed to drive the brute crazy. It began to scamper all
  over the walls, making no sound whatever. It passed along the wooden front of
  the gallery with the tips of its upper legs over the rail. Tom jerked Elsa
  away, but the brute had passed before they could step backward. Noropa fled
  into the gloom, upsetting benches. The shang-shang leaped to the floor of the
  chapel. It made two or three short starts in different directions and then
  scooted toward the high altar, climbed that and continued upward over the
  great image of Chenrezi to the gloom of the wall above. There it became
  motionless again, visible only by its eyes that reflected the chapel lights
  like pale danger signals, one above the other.</p>

  <p>Lobsang Pun stood his ground. So did Mu-ni Gam-po, but he changed the
  mantram; Lobsang Pun stuck to the first one, and about half the monks did the
  same, so that for at least a minute there was a babel of voices, and two
  tunes. Noropa came sneaking back and Tom seized his wrist. Lobsang Pun was
  looking up at the gallery. Tom began to drag Noropa toward the far end of the
  gallery.</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are!" he commanded. But Elsa followed. Tom didn't know it,
  because Noropa began to resist and to try to break away. Tom hit him hard
  enough to slow him up:</p>

  <p>"You fool, here's your chance!"</p>

  <p>But Noropa became panicky. He struggled. He wouldn't be dragged, he was
  useless. Tom knocked him out of the way and hurried forward. Elsa overtook
  him.</p>

  <p>"Damn you," he said. "Obey orders!"</p>

  <p>But she wouldn't obey. There wasn't time to argue. He couldn't treat her
  like Noropa.</p>

  <p>The B&ouml;n magician was coming toward him, followed by his novice and the
  shaman. They seemed in a hurry, but they hesitated. Behind them, the other
  four men were carrying the big black baskets, one basket empty with the lid
  half-open. The B&ouml;n magician had his hands inside his black robe, getting
  something ready in the line of sharp-edged, very likely poisoned magic. Tom
  hesitated, too. He glanced back at Elsa:</p>

  <p>"Damn you, run! There's a shang-shang in that other basket! I'm going to
  turn it loose. Get the hell out of here!"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered. "Go ahead. I've a blanket in case you need it."</p>

  <p>Tom had learned combative magic on football fields. The magician cannoned
  backward into his novice. The novice crashed into the shaman. They both fell.
  Tom leaped them and bucked the basket-bearers. The empty basket and the man
  who carried it went reeling away over upset benches. The three who held the
  other basket dropped it, to put up a fight. There were ends of benches in the
  way that tripped them. One of them stopped a hay-maker that cracked on his
  jaw like the blow of a meat-ax. There was an awful din be low the gallery,
  but no time to guess what caused it. Tom heard Elsa's voice:</p>

  <p>"They're taking Th&ouml;-pa-ga away !"</p>

  <p>No time to look. He hove up the big black basket and balanced it on the
  gallery rail. It stank foul. He tore off the waterproof cover and it stank
  worse. There was an iron hasp and a big iron padlock&mdash;no key. He
  wrenched the hasp until it tore loose from the cane into which it was
  threaded and wired. Then he opened the lid and hove the basket over, to the
  floor below. It spilled a shang-shang. The awful brute crept out and spread
  itself on top of the basket. It was even larger than the other, but it looked
  sick&mdash;or perhaps it was stiff from close confinement.</p>

  <p>"Tom! Help!"</p>

  <p>Elsa's stifled scream, from down in the dark on the gallery floor.
  Flash-light. The shaman and the B&ouml;n magician's novice were trying to gag her
  with her own blanket. Two of the basket-porters stood in Tom's way. They were
  as easy as ninepins. But he stumbled over the legs of an upset bench and
  didn't kick the shaman hard enough. The shaman, B&ouml;n magician, novice and all
  the rest of them fled from the gallery, slamming the door. Noropa nowhere to
  be seen, perhaps hiding among upset benches.</p>

  <p>"Hurt?"</p>

  <p>"No, not much."</p>

  <p>"Good girl. They'd have pulled that off, if you'd obeyed me."</p>

  <p>They returned to the rail. Sudden silence had fallen again. A monk's foot
  rutching on the chapel floor was an explosion of noise. Four monks, running
  into the gallery with flash lights, made a prodigious din as they stumbled
  over upset benches. Elsa's fingers signaled on the back of Tom's hand:</p>

  <p>"The devil-dancers were trying to drag Th&ouml;-pa-ga away."</p>

  <p>No sign of them now. Th&ouml;-pa-ga sat quite still. All the monks were crowded
  back against the far wall, but the devil-dancers weren't there any longer.
  They might have fled under the gallery, out of sight. One shang-shang was
  still on the wall above the high altar. The other was on the floor in
  mid-chapel. It pulsed up and down on the tips of its wide-spread legs as if
  flexing them. The monks in the gallery turned their flash lights on the
  monsters. Tom signaled Elsa:</p>

  <p>"Unless Noropa lied, they'll fight. They're cannibals. That's why they're
  rare."</p>

  <p>The brute on the wall dropped to the altar and poised it self, hanging
  over so that its eyes, on top of its body, looked straight at the other
  brute. The one on the floor began to pulse up and down more violently. Stuff
  that looked like froth bubbled on the end of its snout. Suddenly it launched
  itself toward the high altar. The other fled up the wall. The big one gave
  chase. Lobsang Pun's voice broke upon the breath less silence, booming
  scripture:</p>

  <p>"Blessings create blessings in an endless cycle. Evil creates evil until
  evil-doers perish. For the devils shall destroy them selves and one another,
  and their dupes shall perish with them."</p>

  <p>The shang-shangs vanished, up amid the shadows of the roof beams. The
  flash-lights discovered them. One dropped to the floor&mdash;a fifty-foot
  drop on to stone that made hardly a sound. The other followed, flourishing
  its legs in mid-air. It missed its pounce by a yard. The first one fled to
  the altar, leaped it and crouched with its body resting on Chenrezi's head.
  The other followed, not so fast now, stalking, crab-wise, with a kind of
  see-saw movement. It stood still on the altar platform between the Abbot and
  Lobsang Pun. Slowly it approached the altar, climbing it crab-wise, in short,
  almost imperceptible movements. When it reached Chenrezi's feet the other
  pounced on it. The chapel seethed with its congregation's gasp of horror.</p>

  <p>The brutes fought in Chenrezi's lap and all over the altar, knocking altar
  vessels to the floor with a crash that broke the spell that had held the
  monks motionless. Some of them ran and hustled Mu-ni Gam-po away from the
  altar platform. The competent fellow with the sharp stick ran and tried to
  belabor the brutes. He was joined by taper-on-a-pole. They prodded, whacked,
  and hit nothing except the altar and Chenrezi's statue, for several minutes.
  But they were gallant fellows. They stuck to it. The shang-shangs fought like
  wolverines, dragon-flies, octopuses, tearing, leaping, gnawing off each
  other's legs. They were as quick as lightning. The only sound they made was
  of rending flesh. They were tearing each other to pieces in a lather of vile
  froth. One had torn the other's eyes out before the brave man with the stick
  hit one of them at last. He skewered the blind one. Then he beat the other.
  It had only three legs left. It dragged itself toward him. Lobsang Pun picked
  up a heavy charcoal brazier and crushed the brute. Then he laughed&mdash;his
  big laugh from the depths of his huge belly:</p>

  <p>"Oo-ha-ha-ha-ha-hah!"</p>

  <p>The monks swarmed around the altar. Tom seized Elsa's wrist. He didn't
  signal, he spoke:</p>

  <p>"Come and talk to Th&ouml;-pa-ga. It's trespass, but I guess he needs us."</p>

  <p>No sign of Noropa. They hurried out of the gallery and down the stone
  stairs. That brought them into the courtyard. They had to run in the rain
  around a stone building and its long buttresses to the chapel entrance.
  Double door. Dark vestibule. Another double door&mdash;it swung open against
  them.</p>

  <p>Tom caught a glimpse, against the light within the chapel, of grinning
  devil-masks and of Th&ouml;-pa-ga between the B&ouml;n magician and the shaman, coming
  on the run toward him. Something struck him on the head. He lost
  consciousness.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">CHAPTER 24.</a><br>
  "Sign your name as representative plenipotentiary!"</h2>

  <p class="first">TOM didn't remain long unconscious. He was alone in the
  vestibule, in almost total darkness. There was a lot of noise in the chapel.
  He could feel his scalp was bleeding, but not too badly. He had evidently
  been hit on the top of the head with a cudgel. He felt dazed. When he stood
  up it took him a minute or two before he could steady himself. Then he went
  out into the rain and doused his head under a gush of water from a dram-pipe
  off the gallery roof. After a minute of that he was wet to the skin, and
  sore-headed, but in full possession of his senses.</p>

  <p>As fast as he could run he crossed two courtyards to the monastery gate.
  The monk on gatehouse duty came out of meditation rather resentfully,
  spinning his prayer wheel.</p>

  <p>Yes. A number of people, including the B&ouml;n magician and some devil-dancers
  and others, had passed out through the gate about fifteen minutes ago, and
  good riddance to them. The B&ouml;n magician had produced a document that bore
  Lobsang Pun's signature. Forgery? Nonsense! Who would dare to forge Lobsang
  Pun's blessed name? In all there were probably thirty people, but he wasn't
  sure, he hadn't counted. There had been others waiting for them outside, he
  didn't know how many. To the Powers of Darkness with such rogues. He had
  locked the gate behind them and returned to his prayers.</p>

  <p>No, he hadn't noticed Elsa, nor any one who looked like a European woman.
  No, he hadn't seen Th&ouml;-pa-ga; didn't know what he looked like; didn't wish to
  know. Yes, they had all seemed to be in a great hurry, but in no greater
  hurry than he had been to see the last of them. He didn't know what had come
  over Mu-ni Gam-po of late, that he should admit such people to the monastery.
  Those devil-dancers, for instance: not like good Darjeeling devil-dancers.
  Dissolute, bold, ill-mannered fellows, recently from Tibet, where they must
  have been corrupted by political and religious quarrels.</p>

  <p>The rain ceased. No, the monk wouldn't open the gate for Tom&mdash;not
  unless he had an order from the Abbot. It would have to be in writing. Yes
  Lobsang Pun's written order would be all right, because Lobsang Pun was a
  high dignitary, even higher than the Abbot. No, if Tom should try to climb
  the wall, he would summon the watch, who were armed with cudgels. The gate
  would be opened again at sunrise, and no sooner. Then respectable people
  could walk out with the holy Abbot's blessing, and might the blessing go with
  them wherever they should set foot.</p>

  <p>Tom returned to the inner courtyard. All the monks had poured out of the
  chapel. Mu-ni Gam-po looked deathly sick; he was being supported by his four
  attendants. Tom wasn't allowed to approach him. A monk thrust a spluttering
  torch so close to Tom's face that it singed his eyebrows. He said the holy
  Abbot might be dying. If so, he mustn't be interrupted; otherwise his spirit
  might be hounded away by shang-shangs and prevented from reincarnating at an
  early moment. None but holy men who knew how to deal with shang-shangs should
  come anywhere near him; but if he didn't die Tom might speak with him
  to-morrow. Several other monks were of the same mind. It was no use trying to
  approach the Abbot.</p>

  <p>Faggots. At least a hundred monks were bringing them. They were building a
  big pyre in the center of the court yard, spreading it evenly, waist high.
  Others were carrying a big black sheet out of the chapel, holding it by the
  four corners. They were surrounded by monks with twirling prayer wheels, all
  chanting a mantram. Other monks were blowing horns. On the sheet lay the
  bright green remains of the two shang-shangs, looking smaller than when they
  were alive, because most of their long legs had been bitten off while they
  fought and they had been swept into a heap.</p>

  <p>Behind the black sheet marched Lobsang Pun, exorcising. He was closely
  followed by his personal attendants, all singing at the top of their lungs
  and whirling prayer wheels. With his dorje in his right hand Lobsang Pun
  described magical signs in the air. He had a great reputation as an exorcist.
  He looked the part. The torchlight crimsoned his big, beaked face. His
  swaying gait lent something even more than dignity. He looked victorious,
  triumphant. He, not Mu-ni Gam-po, had quoted the scriptural text that set the
  shang-shangs to slaying each other&mdash;evil destroying evil! He believed
  that. There wasn't a scrap of insincerity about him. His was faith militant,
  triumphant.</p>

  <p>They laid the shang-shangs, desecrated black curtain and all, on the pyre.
  The wood was dry. A dozen torches plunged into the faggots. The flames
  leaped, crimsoning the surrounding walls. The wet courtyard paving resembled
  a lake of liquid fire, on which shadowy, two-dimensional monks stood twirling
  prayer wheels, throwing shadows in their turn that made flickering waves of
  wet light. The monks pitched their chant against the roar and crackle of the
  flames.</p>

  <p>Tom watched Lobsang Pun until he turned away from the scene, but that
  wasn't until Mu-ni Gam-po's four attendants had half-carried the old man up
  the gallery stairs. It appeared that Lobsang Pun didn't exactly crave the
  Abbot's company or conversation just then. He showed no sympathy for the
  Abbot&mdash;none whatever&mdash;no concern about him. He walked down a narrow
  passage off the courtyard. Tom followed. A door was slammed in his face. He
  thrust and kicked it open before there was time to shoot the bolt. He was
  inside before any one could prevent him.</p>

  <p>A four-square stone-walled room. Lobsang Pun. Seven monks. One sturdy
  wooden bed. A heavy table. Benches. An imported oil lantern. Six or eight
  candles and a little oil lamp in a niche in the wall. Some heaps of corded
  luggage. All seven monks had Mauser pistols; each man's loaded pistol lay in
  its holster on the table, with belt attached. When Tom entered they buckled
  on their pistols in a hurry, beneath their robes.</p>

  <p>Not a word. Tom and Lobsang Pun stared at each other. With his right
  thumb, like a London policeman directing traffic, Tom indicated the seven
  monks, one by one, then the door. Lobsang Pun nodded. He, too, gestured. The
  monks filed out. Tom shot the bolt in the door behind the last one.</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain! Tum-Glain!"</p>

  <p>"Your Eminence?"</p>

  <p>Silence again. Lobsang Pun spoke in a challenging tone in Tibetan:</p>

  <p>"Your wanting what?"</p>

  <p>Tom answered in Tibetan. He didn't dare to be misunderstood. He knew more
  Tibetan than Lobsang Pun knew English. But he hadn't time nor mood to adorn
  his language with the phrases, of humility and reverence, that ought to have
  preceded and loaded every sentence. The structure of his phrases was as
  nearly English as the Tibetan speech would permit. It was crude, but it
  didn't make Lobsang Pun laugh.</p>

  <p>"Write your permit for me to travel where I please in Tibet."</p>

  <p>Lobsang Pun looked startled, as if by an idea. Oriental diplomat, he
  temporized, to gain time to think:</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, who am I that I should write that?"</p>

  <p>Tom retorted bluntly: "I didn't ask who you are. I know. I am saying:
  write that permit or take the consequences. I will use it and take the
  consequences."</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you want to be arrested by the British authorities on the charge that
  your agent, bearing your instructions, over your signature, threw
  shang-shangs into a monastery chapel and then carried off Th&ouml;-pa-ga and Miss
  Elsa Burbage?"</p>

  <p>The arbitrary absolutist Lobsang Pun made no attempt to appear
  indifferent. He was visibly shocked:</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, that is untrue!"</p>

  <p>"Prove it! That B&ouml;n magician showed the monk at the gate a document with
  your signature. Probably that same document passed him across the border into
  British territory with his baggage unexamined. He used it to get admission to
  this monastery. Forgery perhaps, but prove it!"</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, I am on my way to Tibet. I will swiftly overtake and
  punish."</p>

  <p>"Overtake? You?" Tom's fist thumped the table. "I want five or six of your
  best men. Ten horses. Provisions. That permit. After that, if you can
  overtake me you're a wizard! Here's the table. Pen. Ink. Paper. Sand. A
  chair. Sit down and write!"</p>

  <p>"But Tum-Glain, they can not have gone far&mdash;not yet. My seven
  monks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tom snorted: "Oh, yes, Mauser pistols. Pursuit. A fight on British
  territory! Dacoity! Sikkim military police! Your Eminence, if the police,
  here in Darjeeling, get a hint of what has happened, every road will be
  blocked by telephone within half an hour. Then what? Do you wish to stay here
  and face an enquiry?"</p>

  <p>"You shall not go to the police!" said Lobsang Pun. His eyes blazed
  indignation.</p>

  <p>Tom laughed. "Very well then, write that permit, and the order for horses,
  provisions and five men."</p>

  <p>"Tell your thinking, Tum-Glain."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you your own thoughts!" Tom answered. "That B&ouml;n magician, who
  carries a forged authority from you&mdash;or isn't it forged?&mdash;was
  wearing a Japanese dagger in his girdle. You came to India to get the British
  to support the Tashi Lama. Don't say you didn't. I know you did. You'd been
  intriguing with the Japanese, but they wanted too much in return for their
  help, so you turned pro-British without warning the Japs. But the British
  weren't any too enthusiastic. They didn't want you in Delhi&mdash;you and
  your Tibetan intrigues, so you were diplomatically hung up. You only heard of
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga's return from England after he reached Delhi. Eiji Sarao told you
  about it. You hadn't expected Th&ouml;-pa-ga so soon. You weren't quite ready. But
  the opposition was."</p>

  <p>"Your not understanding what you're talking, Tum-Glain."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no? Listen to this, then. The Japanese saw through your
  turn-about-face, so they lined up promptly with the Lhasa gang who murdered
  the Dalai Lama. That B&ouml;n magician belongs to the Lhasa outfit. They, you,
  Russia and Japan all want control of the Thunder Dragon Gate. You want it for
  His Holiness the Tashi Lama's benefit, and for him only, in order to make him
  the ruler of Tibet. They want it in order to keep the Tashi Lama out of
  Tibet. Russia wants it to use against Japan. The Japanese want it for
  propaganda purposes, to further their aims in China and Inner Mongolia. Now
  then: if the Lhasa politicians get the Thunder Dragon Gate, and if the
  Japanese control them, what chance has the Tashi Lama?"</p>

  <p>Silence. Lobsang Pun's expression was a mixture of out raged dignity,
  suspicion, embarrassment, alertness and lurking humor. The humor was in
  ambush, behind cunning eyes. But he liked Tom. He couldn't disguise that he
  liked him. A brow-beater himself, he respected a man who stood up to him and
  dared to bully him with questions that carried no question-mark. Tom kept
  hard at him:</p>

  <p>"You know well you'd be discredited forever if there's a police
  investigation."</p>

  <p>"No police, Tum-Glain."</p>

  <p>"Very well then, listen. Suppose they kill Th&ouml;-pa-ga. Suppose he dies on
  the journey. How would that suit you? Would they admit he's dead? Not likely!
  He'd be out of the way. They'd bury him, or throw his body to the dogs, and
  put another in his place&mdash;they'd pick a devil&mdash;and they'd say he
  was the real man just returned from abroad. The very first thing that their
  devil would do would be to denounce the Tashi Lama from the Thunder Dragon
  Gate. After that, he'd begin prophesying that the long-awaited, all-redeeming
  Maitreya, who is to unite Asia under one benign government, is the Emperor of
  Japan! Am I right?"</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>"What will they do to Elsa Burbage, if Th&ouml;-pa-ga dies on the journey? Do
  you want the credit for that&mdash;you and your B&ouml;n magician, who, you
  <i>say</i> forged your name to a document!"</p>

  <p>A plea at last. Not guilty! Accomplished diplomatic liar Lobsang Pun might
  be, but his eyes told the truth. Black, oriental, malicious, reserved,
  fierce, intelligent eyes, they were. But they weren't lying now. Whatever his
  intentions might have been, concerning Elsa, he hadn't been a party of her
  abduction. He perceived its implications.</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, they didn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They did. They have carried her off to keep Th&ouml;-pa-ga from dying of
  terror and depression. That dog Noropa suggested it to them. If Th&ouml;-pa-ga
  dies, they'll kill her. Then what?"</p>

  <p>Lobsang Pun displayed a philosophic doubt on that score.</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, now your talking foolishness. Why their killing a young woman?
  Nancy Strong, true, not stolen, but having lived long in Tibet, not dead
  yet."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh? Write that permit!"</p>

  <p>"She being your woman?"</p>

  <p>"You've sixty seconds to take that pen in your hand."</p>

  <p>The diplomat's canniness came to the surface:</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, your not wanting police, eh? Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Very well, I'll tell you. More than two years ago, when you turned me out
  of Tibet, I was hunting for the Thunder Dragon Gate. I am hunting for it now,
  and so is Elsa Burbage. Stop either of us&mdash;stop us if you dare! Time's
  up. Write. Here you are." He dragged the heavy chair to the table. "Sit down.
  Write."</p>

  <p>Lobsang Pun sat and took the pen in hand, but he still hesitated:</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, no good. My representing Blessed Holiness Panchen Rinpoche,
  Tashi Lama. His being exiled beyond border of Tibet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't I know that? Do you think I'll show your permit to the soldiers or
  officials from Lhasa? Sign your name as representative plenipotentiary, and
  set your seal to it. There isn't a tax-ridden layman in all Tibet, nor a
  decent monk, who doesn't love His Holiness the Tashi Lama and want him home
  again at Tashi-lunpo. Write it. I'll take the consequences."</p>

  <p>Lobsang Pun demurred. "Tum-Glain, my writing evidence, my aiding your
  entering Tibet, contrary to law? Signing my sentence of death!"</p>

  <p>"I'm American. There is no law against my entering Tibet. Against all
  other foreigners, yes. An American, no."</p>

  <p>"They not understanding that."</p>

  <p>"Does Your Eminence understand that every minute is of consequence? I'll
  take care your enemies don't get hold of the permit to use against you.
  Rather than that, I'll eat it."</p>

  <p>Lobsang Pun wrote. But he paused again before he signed.</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, your never returning alive!"</p>

  <p>"No? You went in, didn't you? Here you are. Are you dead?"</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, my not going in there. Never. More than two years, many years
  ago, not daring, staying outside."</p>

  <p>"You sent Noropa in."</p>

  <p>"No. His not going in, also."</p>

  <p>"Too bad. Well, Your Eminence, signature please. Now the seal. Thank
  you."</p>

  <p>Tom sanded the document and stowed it away in an inner pocket. Then he
  opened the door.</p>

  <p>By word of mouth, to one of his seven attendant monks, Lobsang Pun gave
  the order for horses, provisions and five men.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">CHAPTER 25.</a><br>
  "I'm ready. Let's go."</h2>

  <p class="first">"HIS HOLY EMINENCE commands you to give me that pistol,"
  said Tom.</p>

  <p>All seven monks looked stonily indignant. Lobsang Pun had commanded
  nothing of the sort. But he didn't deny it. Tom unbuckled a Mauser, belt and
  all, from the waist of the monk who had been told to see about horses,
  provisions and men. He strapped it on under his own shirt. Lobsang Pun
  roared:</p>

  <p>"Oo-ha-ha-ha-hah! Tum-Glain!"</p>

  <p>Then he did an astonishing thing. He ordered all the other monks to unload
  their pistols and to give Tom the ammunition.</p>

  <p>"Your going quick, you, Tum-Glain, better not letting my catching you!
  Oo-ha-ha-hah!"</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly he offered to shake hands. He wouldn't let go. He
  belly-roared his blessings until Tom almost tore himself loose. The monks
  couldn't get out of his way fast enough.</p>

  <p>He ran up the gallery steps, fetched his bag from the guest cell and
  demanded to see Mu-ni Gam-po. If the Abbot really was dying of shock, it
  might be possible to invent a new line of communication even on the spur of
  that moment. But the monks told him to wait. They were not in the least
  impressed by his impatience. Fuming at delay, he watched the monks in the
  courtyard shoveling the fire, burying the shang-shangs' ashes beneath a huge
  cone of glowing crimson embers. They were taking no chances on the brutes
  returning to life!</p>

  <p>But there was something else going on. Twice, two messengers ran past him
  along the gallery, going and coming. They crossed the fire-lit courtyard and
  vanished in the direction of the main gate. A monk came and said the Abbot
  would see Tom presently, but he must wait a little longer.</p>

  <p>Ten more minutes passed, and then came Abdul Mirza up the stairs, all
  alone, wrapped head and shoulders in a shawl. Tom didn't recognize him until
  they were face to face.</p>

  <p>"You?"</p>

  <p>"You?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know what has happened here?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing. I am looking for Noropa."</p>

  <p>"You won't find him. How did you get by the main gate?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I made a noise like a prayer wheel. What are you doing here with your
  bag in your hand?"</p>

  <p>"Waiting for word with the Abbot. What had you to do with Dowlah sending
  Noropa to stab me with a poisoned dagger? Noropa traveled with your
  party."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Noropa begged to be allowed to travel under my protection. He said
  he was coming here to beg facilities to return to Tibet."</p>

  <p>"What is Dowlah doing?"</p>

  <p>Abdul Mirza made a wry face. "He has vanished. Are you on your way to
  Tibet? Can I help you with equipment?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks, I guess that's all attended to."</p>

  <p>"Have you money?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Indian rupees."</p>

  <p>"Then why wait? It is my private opinion, Mr. Grayne, that Rajah Dowlah
  also is on his way to Tibet. I have no proof, but I believe he knows where
  the Thunder Dragon Gate is. I am not in his confidence. I never have been. It
  has always been a game between him and me, as to which could outwit the
  other. It was my duty to prevent him from making serious mistakes, but he has
  made at least one too many. Your arrival on the scene, I think, precipitated
  crowning indiscretion. He was always ambitious, always jealous. Even as a boy
  he was possessed by irrepressible curiosity. Contempt for other people's
  intelligence is his worst fault. I believe his plans have been secretly laid
  for a long time. He believes the Thunder Dragon Gate will give him fame and
  power. He, and twenty men, have vanished."</p>

  <p>Tom saw what looked like light on the situation.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said, "a B&ouml;n magician, devil-dancers and some others, less
  than an hour ago, raised hell here with a couple of shang-shangs at the
  midnight service. They have carried off Th&ouml;-pa-ga and Elsa Burbage. D'you
  think Dowlah had a hand in that?"</p>

  <p>Abdul Mirza stared into Tom's eyes. His own were far-sighted from
  advancing age, and he couldn't get out his pince-nez quickly from under the
  shawl.</p>

  <p>"You say they carried them off? And you wait here? No, I don't think
  Dowlah had a hand in that. He can't have, or I think not. How could he? He
  will take advantage of it, if he learns it has happened. He is very partial
  to European women. Intelligent ones. Young ones. Good looking.
  Unconventional. Have you warned the police?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I haven't."</p>

  <p>"There are very efficient police in Sikkim," said Abdul Mirza.</p>

  <p>"Yes, a damned sight too efficient. At a word they'd be under way in less
  than fifteen minutes."</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid the abductors would murder Miss Burbage, if pursued by the
  police? I think that unlikely."</p>

  <p>"That isn't the point," Tom answered. "You should know that."</p>

  <p>"My young friend, then what is the point?"</p>

  <p>"If a B&ouml;n magician and his party can cross the passes at this time of
  year, and reach the Thunder Dragon Gate, I can follow. If they can get in, I
  can."</p>

  <p>"And Miss Elsa Burbage? Mr. Grayne, the police&mdash;I am afraid. If it
  should be said I knew, but that I did nothing, did not tell the
  police&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right, you don't know. You haven't spoken to me. You haven't seen me.
  Can't wait any longer on the Abbot. Good-by."</p>

  <p>Tom went hurrying to the stables. The monk stood swinging a lantern. There
  were several men in line&mdash;some packed loads&mdash;two tents&mdash;a
  string of ten shaggy Tibetan ponies. He could see at a glance that one pony
  was lame; the other nine were probably not much better, and the men
  worse&mdash;malingerers, thieves, weaklings. The monk, no doubt, was out for
  vengeance for the requisitioned Mauser pistol.</p>

  <p>Tom examined the loads first, rejected one tent as unnecessary and
  demanded another load of tea, sugar and canned milk. Then an extra load of
  cheese, and another of ground barley. He rejected a bale of rotten dried
  apricots. They stank. He found another bale of them that didn't stink. He
  demanded more blankets. By a high-handed display of impatience and money he
  bought, at an outrageous price from a sleepy Tibetan, a sheepskin coat and
  hat. They reeked of ghee* and yak-dung smoke, but they were in good
  condition. Then he went into the stable and requisitioned the ten ponies that
  were haltered in a line in the dark at the farther end.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Ghee</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a clarified semifluid
  butter. ]</p>

  <p>That started a fine rebellion. The monk went nearly frantic. Those were
  the special personal ponies reserved for the use of the Holy and Reverend
  Lobsang Pun!</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Tom. "I guessed that."</p>

  <p>He didn't actually have to fight, but he did have to go in and lead out
  the ponies. Such a row was raised about them that he found out who the best
  men were, because the monk appealed to them and ignored the others. So Tom
  picked five of those. He promised each of them a bonus of fifty rupees, over
  and above regular pay.</p>

  <p>"<i>Bhod!</i>* Tibet! Now!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Bhod!</i>&mdash;Tibetan name for Tibet. ]</p>

  <p>So be the trail lay northward, men and beasts were willing. Saddling up
  took next to no time. Such delay as there was, saved valuable minutes. Abdul
  Mirza caused it. He came, wrapped in his shawl, like a prowling Haroun al
  Raschid of Baghdad. He had an order to open the main gate, which Tom did not
  have. True, he might have managed with Lobsang Pun's seal and signature, but
  Abdul Mirza's signed pass from the Abbot was better.</p>

  <p>"Tom Grayne, I have salved my conscience, such as it is. You appear to
  have none, so may peace ride with you. We have been too stupid, some of us
  statesmen. Others have been too clever for their own good. Between those
  extremes, the middle, and perhaps the only wise course, is madness. Go ahead
  and be mad, and may Allah guide you."</p>

  <p>"How's the Abbot?"</p>

  <p>"Shocked. Recovering. But almost overwhelmed with spiritual dread. He
  feels a consciousness of sin that held open the door to the shang-shang
  sending. The poor old fellow thoroughly believes that burning shang-shangs'
  corpses is merely a gesture that soothes ignorant monks but can't allay the
  spiritual menace. You saw those monsters fight?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"What Dowlah missed! How that sight would have thrilled him!"</p>

  <p>"Did you speak of me to the Abbot?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He sends his blessing. He will pray to a thousand saints to protect
  you, wherever you go. I don't know what he meant, but he mentioned some
  sacred books. He begs you kindly not to forget to write about them."</p>

  <p>"Did you speak of Elsa Burbage?"</p>

  <p>"Why inflict on him more anxiety? No. Nor of Noropa. I prevaricated, Mr.
  Grayne, about Noropa. I didn't come here to enquire about him. Mu-ni Gam-po
  is occasionally very well informed. I hoped that perhaps he had heard
  something of Dowlah's plans&mdash;some rumor&mdash;or perhaps some detail
  about provisions and porters waiting for him between here and Tibet."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"He knows nothing."</p>

  <p>"What's your particular worry about Dowlah?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-one years my prince! Tom Grayne, it needs more than twenty-one
  hours to destroy an aging man's love for the boy he tried to build into a
  man. I always knew he was a rogue. May Allah, blessed be His Prophet, show me
  mercy&mdash;I have never been able to love sincerely persons who were so
  righteous that butter wouldn't melt in their mouths!"</p>

  <p>Abdul Mirza glanced into the stable and took a horse-blanket down from a
  hook on the wall. He removed his own beautiful Kashmir shawl and wrapped the
  smelly blanket over his head and shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It will be cold in the passes. Should you overtake her, she may need
  this."</p>

  <p>"I will say it's a present from you."</p>

  <p>"And will you do me a favor?"</p>

  <p>"If it's possible. What?"</p>

  <p>"Dowlah's bankers in Delhi were served, this midnight, by phone and
  special messenger, with an order forbidding them to cash Dowlah's drafts or
  to forward money to him through their agents or by any other means. They will
  not dare to disobey that order. If you should find Dowlah, will you give him
  this package?"</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand rupees. All I have."</p>

  <p>"I knew you were a good egg," Tom answered. "Yes, I'll do that. If he
  kills me, he'll take it anyhow. Go ahead, will you, and get 'em to open the
  gate. I'm ready. Let's go."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">CHAPTER 26.</a><br>
  "Who would speak of such a valley?"</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Tibetans hadn't seen the shang-shang battle, but they
  had heard about it. Storm or no storm, they were in a momentary mood to go as
  far away as possible, at top speed. Abdul Mirza had his carriage waiting
  outside the monastery gate. He was staying at the Hindu Kush Hotel. He
  promised to wake the clerk, get Tom's mail, should there be any, and send it
  by messenger to Nancy Strong's house.</p>

  <p>Rain, thunder, lightning. Deserted, dark streets. Even the police were
  under cover. A light in Nancy Strong's living-room. All the rest of her house
  dark. No one at the gate. A fork of lightning revealed a rather bare compound
  with a lean-to children's play-shed that served to shelter the men and
  ponies.</p>

  <p>Tom had a deuce of a time to get the front door opened. Rain and thunder
  out-dinned his thumping on the panel, and there was no bell. However, a
  servant opened at last, dried him off a bit and showed him into the
  living-room. Nancy Strong, in a quilted dressing-gown, was hugging the fire,
  reading and making notes. She looked middle-aged and untidy with her gray
  hair down over her shoulders, but she didn't seem embarrassed. She looked
  over the top of horn-rimmed reading-glasses and shot a question at Tom before
  he had time to speak:</p>

  <p>"Did you persuade her?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Did you try?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Nothing doing. I want her bag, please."</p>

  <p>"Your Elsa Burbage is exactly the kind of girl I feared she might be. You
  are using a thoroughbred, Tom Grayne, to do a mule's job."</p>

  <p>"Too late to discuss that," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Th&ouml;-pa-ga? Lobsang Pun?"</p>

  <p>"Ask Johnson. He probably knows by now. Perhaps he'll tell you. Tell him I
  said nothing. Or you might ask Abdul Mirza. He's more talkative."</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong went for Elsa's bag. Apparently it had to be repacked; she
  was a long time bringing it. Tom paced the room, staring at framed Tibetan
  photographs. There was one of Lobsang Pun, many years younger, in a silver
  frame on the piano. A portrait of the late Dalai Lama. Several Tibetan
  landscapes in water-color, a bit school-marmy in conception and execution,
  but not too bad&mdash;probably Nancy Strong's work. Several photos of Nancy
  Strong, young and rather good looking, in Tibetan costume, two on horseback
  and one on camelback.</p>

  <p>Tom's ears were alert. He heard a pounding on the front door and opened it
  to Abdul Mirza's messenger. A telegram. Nothing else.</p>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>HARLEY BELIEVES TEIVOS SALESMAN EITHER ON THE WAY OR
  PERHAPS ALREADY MAKING BID FOR CONTRACT. CAVELL</tt></p>

  <p>Marching orders! Gate into Tibet open and its custodians not looking! Sir
  Horace O'Mally of Harley Street, physician extraordinary to kings and
  millionaires, had evidently learned a lot more in Moscow than how to cut off
  a dog's head and keep it alive. The word "Teivos" couldn't be anything else
  than "Soviet" reversed. "Soviet salesman" must mean "Russian secret agent,"
  on his way to the Thunder Dragon Gate or there already. "Cavell" was
  certainly Dr. Morgan Lewis of the Edith Cavell Hospital.</p>

  <p>If the telegram meant anything whatever, it meant: "Ride like the devil
  and get there ahead of them all!"</p>

  <p>The United States, Great Britain, Russia, Japan, the Tibetan Council of
  Regents in Lhasa, and the agents of the Tashi Lama, were all in the running!
  Dowlah, Lobsang Pun, the B&ouml;n magician, and how many others?</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong brought two bags, Elsa's and another filled with such
  luxuries as raisins, chocolate, soap, face cream and a small first-aid
  kit.</p>

  <p>"I have nothing small enough for her, so I have put in needles, thread,
  scissors. She will have to make her own warm clothing, of any material she
  can get. Oh, you iron men! Is she out in this storm? Have you plenty of
  money? Have you a Mauser pistol? Tibetans believe a Mauser has some sort of
  magical superiority over all other weapons. They won't face Mausers. Have you
  ammunition? You won't be able to get any in Tibet. Have you wind-proof
  clothing?"</p>

  <p>Tom almost tore himself away. He didn't even wave his hand as she stood in
  the open doorway with the yellow light behind her. He was afraid she might
  summon him back for some last-minute argument.</p>

  <p>He had no difficulty in getting the Tibetans and ponies to face the storm
  again. The Tibetans laughed. They said it would cease before daylight, and it
  did. There were washed-out roads and some dangerous bridges, but nothing to
  delay a small, self-sufficient, experienced party. The going might have held
  up dude explorers, or a heavily laden caravan. But the ponies' loads were
  reasonably light. There was nothing to be bought but corn, in small
  quantities, to enable the ponies to keep up the grueling pace; so they didn't
  have to linger anywhere and answer questions. The principal problem for three
  days was to remove leeches from the ponies' legs and bellies every time they
  crossed one of the almost countless streams in the tropical valley
  bottoms.</p>

  <p>Up from the steaming jungle, up above the tree line, above the clouds.
  Down again into the tropical heat. Up again, over the freezing sky line,
  sleeping, all huddled together for warmth, in one tent. No privacy, but no
  chance for conspiracy. The seeds of mutiny are laid in whispers in the night,
  but the Tibetans couldn't whisper in the night without Tom's overhearing.</p>

  <p>His hardiness puzzled them. He did more than his share of the work. He
  could load two ponies while any one of them was loading one. He ate the same
  coarse food, consumed the same greasy salted tea and seemed to have an even
  greater craving than their own to reach the Roof of the World and its windy
  desolation.</p>

  <p>He asked no questions along the road. There were fifty trails through
  Sikkim that the B&ouml;n magician's party might have taken, but they all had to
  converge to one point. There the B&ouml;n magician might be held up by the police
  or border officials, but more likely he would get by with Lobsang Pun's
  forged signature. The Sikkim military police might spot Elsa, but more
  probably not, if she were swaddled up in blankets. The road into Tibet was
  open to let Th&ouml;-pa-ga go home and unlock a secret.</p>

  <p>Once over the seventeen thousand-foot Sepo La, there were two roads. One
  of them toward Lhasa. A main road, absolutely certain to be guarded by
  Tibetan troops. If the B&ouml;n magician intended to take that road, then it was
  of the utmost importance to head him off. But if his objective was the
  Thunder Dragon Gate, and if the Thunder Dragon Gate was somewhere near the
  northern slope of Everest, he would take that other road, westward, skirting
  Nepal. Somewhere along that rarely traveled western road was a Yellow-hat
  monastery. It would be Lobsang Pun's only possible base for supplies. As the
  Tashi Lama's representative the old prelate was to all intents and purposes
  an outlaw in Tibet. If his objective, also, was the Thunder Dragon Gate, that
  monastery, whose monks were very likely faithful to the exiled Tashi Lama,
  would be his first goal. There was nowhere else where he could have left
  provisions safe from bandits and Tibetan troops.</p>

  <p>Tom talked it over with the headman, who wasn't much impressed by the need
  for haste. The more he thought about the B&ouml;n magician, the less he liked the
  prospect of over taking him.</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, I saw it happen. I saw those devil-dancers pull their costumes
  off, in darkness, in the stable courtyard, pack them hurriedly and,
  shouldering their own loads, follow the B&ouml;n's party out through the gate, on
  foot.</p>

  <p>"That," he insisted, "means they had animals waiting for them, hidden
  somewhere, ready. They behaved like men who have a plan well laid. That they
  dared to offend the Holy Lobsang Pun is proof enough that they are bad
  rogues. Such men are cunning. They use magic. They can make themselves
  invisible. They wouldn't take a straight road through Sikkim. That black
  devil knows where he can get supplies from people in out-of-the-way places
  who won't betray which way he went for fear he might send them a sending. I
  say, they are far behind us."</p>

  <p>Tom watched for signs of Elsa. There were countless chortens, cairns,
  trees beside the road to which pious travelers had tied strips of rags to
  flutter ceaseless prayers in the wind. But there was no rag that might have
  been torn from Elsa's dress. In the lead, on the sturdiest pony, mile after
  mile, day after day, Tom searched with tireless eyes for anything whatever
  that she might have put to use as an intelligible signal.</p>

  <p>The Tibetans laughed, not at him, but at the notion that a prayer streamer
  might be a message to any one in this world.</p>

  <p>"Those are to bring blessings upon us. <i>Om mane padme hum</i>!* They
  repeat it again and again."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Om mane padme hum</i> is the most important mantra
  in Buddhism. It is the six syllable mantra of the Bodhisattva of compassion
  Avalokiteshvara. The basic English translation is "Om Jewel in the Lotus Hum"
  or "Praise to the Jewel in the Lotus." ]</p>

  <p>"Watch, I tell you! Unless they tied her hand and foot, she will leave her
  mark somewhere. It isn't likely they would ill treat her. That would have a
  bad effect on Th&ouml;-pa-ga, and it is him they think of."</p>

  <p>"For Th&ouml;-pa-ga, so I have heard, they have another woman waiting," said
  the headman. "Is this one your woman? If so, she should give them the
  slip."</p>

  <p>"She will stand by Th&ouml;-pa-ga," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, is she his woman?"</p>

  <p>"Keep your eyes open for some sign of her."</p>

  <p>But they saw no sign until the ten wearying ponies had toiled up the long
  gradual ascent of the Sepo La. Near the cairn at the summit, that marks the
  boundary between Sikkim and Tibet, was the first snow&mdash;a mere acre or
  two in the lee of a ledge, out of reach of the bitter westerly wind. The
  Tibetans made haste to off-load. The ponies rolled in the snow on the edge of
  a fifty-foot precipice, while Tom hunted for signs of the B&ouml;n's party having
  bivouacked thereabouts. There were plenty of traces of traders' caravans.
  There were skeletons of yaks and ponies, scattered apart and cracked up by
  wolves. But nothing recent. There was nothing attached to the boundary cairn,
  or hidden near it.</p>

  <p>But in a hollow a considerable distance off the road he found embers and a
  lot of horse-dung that was not many hours old. A party that had carried wood
  up to that elevation, and that could afford to waste embers and not to burn
  the horse-dung, must have plenty of ponies and be traveling in great haste.
  He examined the ground carefully, kicked over a stone and picked up one of
  Elsa's blue goose handkerchiefs.</p>

  <p>It was very likely her last one. The headman laughed like a child at the
  embroidered blue goose.</p>

  <p>"Such a prayer flag should bring happiness! Better leave it where you
  found it, Tum-Glain."</p>

  <p>No lip-stick marks. Probably she hadn't any lip-stick. But, wrapped in the
  handkerchief, there was a small strip of bark off a piece of firewood. On the
  inside it showed thumb-nail marks. First, a broad-arrow mark. Danger. Then a
  series of groups of nail marks, as easy to read as a telegram if one knew the
  code:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Th&ouml;pe well. B&ouml;ns fear pursuit. Look out for ambush.
  Turning westward."</p>

  <p>Nothing about herself. No complaint. Nothing to indicate whether she was
  being well or ill treated.</p>

  <p>"Leave it where you found it, Tum-Glain. Interfering with happy prayers
  brings miserable curses. We have trouble enough."</p>

  <p>It was high noon. Men and ponies wished to bivouac in the shelter of that
  hollow, and the ponies had earned it. But Tom fed the ponies and refused to
  pitch camp. There would be a full moon. Night, with the moon on the snow
  would be nearly as bright as day, and for many miles there would be an easy,
  gradual descent to a level of about fifteen thousand feet.</p>

  <p>"Forward!"</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, we are too few. The B&ouml;n magician is a devil with plenty of
  servants, who will kill us if we overtake them. They might see us from a long
  way off and use magic against us. Better keep far behind them until we are
  overtaken by the Holy Blessed Lobsang Pun Rinpoche."</p>

  <p>"Did he order you to obey me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then obey."</p>

  <p>By nightfall they had reached the fork where the rough but clearly marked
  track toward Lhasa winds around to the right of an unclimbable peak. The
  other road, westward toward the maze of mountains that hide Nepal, is little
  used and usually difficult to find. But it was easy now. There was a maze of
  hoof-prints in the snow. Even before moonrise it was easy to tell that the
  track had been ploughed up too recently for the blown snow to hide it
  again.</p>

  <p>There was no avoiding a halt to rest men and animals. The Tibetans boiled
  tea in the lee of a rock, and while he waited for moonrise Tom checked up on
  his previous guess work. It was dangerous to ask questions, because if the
  headman should start lying to him there would be no end to it. He had to
  pretend he knew the main facts and needed only to know minor details.</p>

  <p>"Soon we shall run out of food for the ponies. How far is it to the
  monastery where the Holy Lobsang Pun has stored his supplies?"</p>

  <p>"Three days. Four days."</p>

  <p>"At my speed?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps two days, if the ponies can endure it. This is a bad road. It
  leads upward and upward. Once it was a main road toward Nepal, but the pass
  into Nepal is so steep and high that it has been abandoned these many years,
  and now only a few monks use this road&mdash;they and bandits&mdash;and some
  pilgrims."</p>

  <p>"What pilgrims?"</p>

  <p>"I have never heard what pilgrims, nor whither they go, nor why."</p>

  <p>The beginning of lies and evasions. Tom pretended to lose interest. It was
  enough for the moment that he knew he was right about that monastery.
  Moonlight touched the far-off peaks and made them serenely beautiful. The
  loveliest view in the world. It filled the Tibetans with mystic fears. They
  spoke of spirits, and of snow-men, and of devils. Not even they knew which of
  those peaks was Everest, although they claimed to know what monstrous
  phantoms lived on which mountain. There were a score of moonlit summits,
  perhaps a hundred miles away, or less, all indescribably white against
  moonlit sky. On some of them no human being had ever set foot. Somewhere in
  among them was a valley, unmapped; unphotographed even from the air;
  unvisited even by Sven Hedin* or by the Mt. Everest expeditions; sacred;
  dreaded; secret.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Sven Anders Hedin</i> (1865-1952)&mdash;a Swedish
  explorer, geographer and geopolitician. Hedin led several expeditions to
  Central Asia and mapped large parts of the Tibetan highlands but he never
  reached his ultimate goal: the then forbidden city of Lhasa. See <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven_Hedin">Wikipedia</a></i> for more
  information.</p>

  <p>Tom questioned the headman: "Year after year, pilgrims by the hundred
  visit a secret valley down yonder. How is it that the secret is so well
  kept?"</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, who would speak of such a valley?"</p>

  <p>"How, then, do they find the valley?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know?"</p>

  <p>"Some of them," said Tom, "come hundreds of miles, measuring the way by
  lying prone on the earth after each step."</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't they?" said the headman. "But what should I know about
  it?"</p>

  <p>The headman turned questioner: "Tum-Glain, are you thinking of daring to
  fight that B&ouml;n magician? All that darkness between here and there is full of
  devils that will aid him but oppose us."</p>

  <p>"Where he leads," Tom answered, "we can follow."</p>

  <p>"Not so, Tum-Glain. I know the way to the first monastery, which is easy
  enough to find. But he knows caverns, hermitages, secret valleys, where he
  may have hidden what he needs for the journey. He can go faster than we. And
  he will kill that woman, just to spite you, if you press him hard. Those B&ouml;ns
  are devils."</p>

  <p>"Keep your eyes open for signs of her. If she possibly can do it, she will
  leave a mark to show us where to follow."</p>

  <p>"But the snow, Tum-Glain, is continually driven by the gales that never
  cease hereabouts. It will cover any marks she might make, even if she makes
  any. I think she will be suffering from the cold. Unless you follow fast, you
  may find her dead or dying. But if you follow too fast, you will have to
  fight the B&ouml;n magician. He might kill her, rather than let you have her
  before she has served his purpose, whatever that may be. I say, wait here,
  feeding the ponies as little as possible, until the Blessed Lobsang Pun
  Rinpoche overtakes us. He will use some magic on the B&ouml;n that will bring him
  bad luck, so that perhaps he will let the girl go."</p>

  <p>"You're warm and well fed, among friends, in your own land. You talk like
  a lucky fool," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>He redistributed the ponies' loads, doing most of the work himself,
  pressed forward, until midnight, camped, and was away again at daybreak,
  wearing out men and ponies without getting as much as a sight of the B&ouml;n
  magician's party.</p>

  <p>Most of the following day the wind blew with hurricane force, ice-cold
  from the peaks around Everest. But he disregarded the Tibetans' protests and
  bucked the wind, with as few halts as possible. The blown snow had covered
  all tracks, but the magician's ponies could be no better than his; the
  magician's strength no greater than his own. No sign, all day, of Elsa, who
  was probably too numbed by cold and altitude to think of anything but how to
  keep life in her body.</p>

  <p>But late that afternoon the wind died down to a normal gale. Soon after
  that, where the track emerged from a grim defile on to a bit of a plateau
  where the snow lay sheltered from the wind, there were signs of two
  considerable parties having met and milled around on the snow before they all
  went westward. There was horse-dung, still unfrozen.</p>

  <p>"Bandits!" pronounced the headman. "See, they came this way, captured them
  with no trouble at all, and carried them off along the way they came, no
  doubt to some secret cavern. All Tibet is full of bandits since the Blessed
  Holiness Tashi Lama Rinpoche was driven into exile. His Blessed Holiness took
  religion with him, and evil people are no longer afraid to do wrong."</p>

  <p>Tom decided to rest men and animals, but he only waited until moonlight
  silvered the distant summits. Then he was off in the lead, on foot, leaving
  men and ponies to follow. The track wound amid dismal piles of raw rock
  sketched by star light against faintly luminous snow, along a ledge around a
  precipice. It was almost too dark to see the edge, and the altitude was
  telling on him. It made his head swim. His heart pounded like a trip-hammer.
  He felt his way with one hand on the face of the cliff, his fingers numb with
  cold in spite of a big sheepskin glove. But the men obeyed. He could hear
  them coming. They made a lot of noise, stumbling over loose rock. If they
  could stand it, he could.</p>

  <p>Then the moon rose. The rough track opened out on to a few square miles of
  hummocky plateau, patched with snow and wind-blown rock. It was hedged in by
  a wilderness of snow-clad peaks. In the distance, perched like a swallow's
  nest on an almost unclimbable crag, perhaps seventeen thousand feet above sea
  level, the monastery walls were etched gray by the light of the moon. The
  winding track was a series of dark shadows and pale white snow. To the right
  of the track, two hundred yards ahead, or less, sat a man with his back to a
  rock.</p>

  <p>The man didn't move, although he appeared to at first. It was his
  unfastened yak-skin coat that fluttered in the wind. He was dead. He couldn't
  possibly be alive, and sit still, facing the wind, with his coat open, in
  that temperature. Fifty yards or so beyond him, against another rock, also
  with his coat unfastened, sat another man. Between the two there was a
  shadowy track in the snow, as if the man farther away had dragged himself to
  the place where he sat, and had died there. It looked as if they had killed
  each other.</p>

  <p>Tom went up and examined the first man. He was the B&ouml;n magician. He sat
  bareheaded, with his head tilted back against the rock, so that he was
  staring at the sky with his mouth wide open and a bullet hole in his
  forehead, about an inch above the right eye. He was stone-cold, but his watch
  was still going. He hadn't been touched by birds or animals. Apparently he
  hadn't been looted, not even of his Japanese dagger.</p>

  <p>Tom examined him more closely. There was nothing in the pockets of his
  long sleeves, nor in the looseness of the bokkus above his belt, where a
  Tibetan normally carries his odds and ends and even his provisions. The
  Japanese dagger was tight in its sheath. He had no firearms, pistol holster,
  ammunition belt. No money. And no document bearing Lobsang Pun's signature.
  Nothing in writing whatever. He had been thoroughly looted by some one to
  whom a silver watch and an expensive dagger were of no interest.</p>

  <p>The other man was the B&ouml;n magician's novice, with a bullet hole beneath
  his left eye. He hadn't dragged himself along the snow. He had been shot,
  standing, where he now sat propped carefully against a rock. The tracks in
  the snow had been made by some one walking from one dead body to the other
  and back again. He had a Japanese, or it might be Korean knife in a sheath at
  his waist, a heavy jade charm at his neck, and a Japanese silk shirt
  underneath a heavy woolen sweater made in Massachusetts. There was nothing in
  his pockets.</p>

  <p>Barring bullet holes and the blood on their faces, there was no evidence
  of a fight. They appeared to have left the road at points more than fifty
  paces apart, to have walked about fifty yards along parallel courses almost
  due northward, to have turned when they reached those rocks, and to have been
  shot at rather close range. Then some one had walked back and forth, more
  than once, from one to the other.</p>

  <p>"Bandits!" remarked the headman, when he came up with the leg-weary
  ponies. "I said so."</p>

  <p>"Would a bandit leave behind a silver watch, jade charm, daggers, good
  clothing, boots?"</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, some one may have warned the bandits of Your Excellency's
  coming, so that they fled in haste."</p>

  <p>Tom went and examined the ponies. They were dog-tired. But by dividing up
  the loads it might be possible to reach the monastery. He did the work with
  numbed hands, and then led the way, leaving the five Tibetans to follow on
  foot, arguing about the proper distribution of the B&ouml;ns' belongings.</p>

  <p>Moonlight gleamed on the two bodies, sitting, naked now, staring at the
  sky. The Tibetans had been careful to leave them in the proper attitude of
  death. There would be wolves soon, and then, in the morning, vultures.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27">CHAPTER 27.</a><br>
  "I am Su-Li Wing."</h2>

  <p class="first">MIDNIGHT amid the frozen filth at the foot of the cliff on
  which the monastery perched. Utterly foundered ponies. A path led steeply
  upward, in and out of moonlight, like a monstrous, fantastic stairway in a
  dream. The loaded ponies couldn't possibly negotiate that. Notched against
  the moon two or three hundred feet in the air, there was a dark projection
  with something hanging to it. That was the monastery elevator, operated by a
  hand winch&mdash;a big basket made fast to a hide rope that passed over a
  roller at the end of a beam. It was sure to descend presently. The monks had
  seen Tom's party crossing the snow in moonlight and had sounded several long
  blasts on their radongs.</p>

  <p>Tom was feeding the ponies with scraps of stale barley bread, with his
  back toward the steep stone ramp at the foot of the ascending path, when some
  one touched his elbow. He turned suddenly and stared into the face of a
  woman.</p>

  <p>It was a clean face, which is rare in Tibet. Her features were Chinese.
  Astonishingly good looking in that weird light. Age difficult to
  guess&mdash;perhaps twenty-seven, or even thirty. The moonlight filled her
  eyes with sparks of pale green swimming in golden brown. She was wearing,
  over the customary woolen clothing of a Tibetan lady, an American man's
  coonskin overcoat of very fine quality. She was breathing hard.</p>

  <p>She had evidently come down that monstrous stairway. An active, healthy,
  daring, intolerant-looking woman, with an odor of expensive perfume.</p>

  <p>"I am Su-li Wing," she remarked, as if the name explained everything. "Who
  are you?"</p>

  <p>She spoke in a rather Chinesey voice, with a synthetic accent.</p>

  <p>"Staying in the monastery?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p>She laughed: "Men only! They won't admit me. If you are seen talking to
  me, they won't admit you."</p>

  <p>"Anything particular to talk about?"</p>

  <p>She laughed again. "Very well, Mr. Mind-your-own-business-
  with-ten-tired-ponies, do you know a man named Rajah Dowlah?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Shortly before sunset he shot two monks. Perhaps you saw their bodies. He
  seized and carried off an English girl, and a Tibetan named Th&ouml;-pa-ga. Do you
  happen to know who they are?"</p>

  <p>"How do you know he did it?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him do it. If you're Tom Grayne I am glad to meet you. I will tell
  you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm Tom Grayne."</p>

  <p>"I was Dowlah's friend. I was waiting for him in Nepal. He met me at
  Khatmandu and we crossed the forbidden Khambu-shar-kang Pass. It was a
  dreadful journey. The idea was to get into Tibet ahead of Lobsang
  Pun&mdash;and ahead of you, too, if you should still be alive. Dowlah seemed
  to think you were probably dead. We turned in this direction to requisition
  some of Lobsang Pun's supplies, that Dowlah guessed were in this monastery.
  Scouts went ahead of us. They brought back word so we all rode forward, past
  this monastery, and held up a party who turned out to be Th&ouml;-pa-ga in charge
  of a B&ouml;n magician, with an English girl whose name is Elsa
  Something-or-other, a mongrel named Noropa, a lot of devil-dancers and some
  others. There were about thirty of them; about forty of us. There wasn't a
  fight. They were exhausted after a hard march. Noropa shouted to them to
  surrender and the devil-dancers all obeyed him. Dowlah's men are nearly all
  from Naini Kol, and well armed. The B&ouml;n magician had a pistol, but they took
  it away from him."</p>

  <p>Tom began off-loading the ponies. They were too tired to roll. The five
  Tibetans piled the loads against the wind and took shelter behind them. The
  ponies herded themselves in a melancholy group behind a flying buttress of
  gray rock.</p>

  <p>"Are you listening?" asked Su-li Wing. "If you know Dowlah as well as he
  says he knows you, perhaps you can guess what it meant to him to capture
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga. He had expected to have to set an ambush, further westward, and to
  fight Lobsang Pun's party."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it meant nothing to you?" Tom suggested.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. Nothing! I am the woman, who was to replace the woman, who has
  been waiting for several years for Th&ouml;-pa-ga. Dowlah said Elsa
  Something-or-other is worth a dozen of me. He left me flat, here, in the
  night, without luggage or servants."</p>

  <p>Tom stepped more into the moonlight. She followed him. That way he could
  see her face better.</p>

  <p>"How is Elsa Burbage?" he demanded. "Did she seem all right? Did you speak
  to her? What did she say?"</p>

  <p>"Very little to me. She was all wrapped up in smelly sheep skin, so I can
  hardly say I saw her. She was very angry with Dowlah because he and Noropa
  shot the B&ouml;n magician and his novice. Dowlah ordered them to go and stand
  where he could speak to them separately, each out of the other's hearing.
  Then he and Noropa walked up and blew their brains out. Dowlah flew into a
  rage with me after that because I told him he was a fool to start murdering
  people. He would have shot me, if he had dared, but Th&ouml;-pa-ga and Elsa
  Burbage defied him. That was the only reason why he didn't shoot me. I was
  surprised at Th&ouml;-pa-ga. Dowlah had said he was a spiritless booby. He isn't.
  He took that girl's part and he swore like an English lord."</p>

  <p>"You seem to think you know who I am."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. Who else could you be? Dowlah told me. All the way over that
  awful pass from Khatmandu, whenever we had any conversation, he kept laughing
  about Tom Grayne, the American spy. He said you were dead, but I think he
  doubted it. He seemed surprised when one of the B&ouml;n magician's men claimed to
  have killed you with a club when they carried off Th&ouml;-pa-ga in Darjeeling.
  Dowlah told that to Elsa Burbage."</p>

  <p>"Did she believe it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. She didn't say."</p>

  <p>"So Dowlah found his way through Nepal, did he? That took some doing. You
  say you're his friend?"</p>

  <p>"I said, I <i>was</i> his friend."</p>

  <p>"What are you now ? "</p>

  <p>"Well, I came all the way from Peking to Lhasa, lived more than a year in
  Tibet and traveled from Lhasa to Khatmandu, at my own expense, on the
  strength of Dowlah's promises. I kept him very well informed of what is
  happening in Tibet. I organized most of his secret line of communication. And
  I know he took to himself the credit for all the work that I did. He left me
  without money or food or servants, as he expressed it, to entertain the
  monks. I suppose I think of Dowlah what Elsa Burbage thinks of you, if she
  has any sense. Is it true she was your girl friend? Dowlah said you sold her
  to Th&ouml;-pa-ga. He laughed about it. She'll belong to Dowlah soon, unless you
  do in Dowlah. Or do you count on her to seduce Dowlah and betray him to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Before Peking, where were you?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I'm a can of sardines?" she retorted. "You ask questions
  like a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Moscow?"</p>

  <p>"Since you've guessed it, yes."</p>

  <p>"Lenin Institute, for special training? Former member of the Kuomintang?
  Now Revolutionary Instrument Number So-and-so?"</p>

  <p>"Supposing that's true, then what?"</p>

  <p>"Did you play with Dowlah with the notion of getting to India under his
  protection and stirring up sedition among the Indian women?"</p>

  <p>"You're smart, aren't you! Get me close enough to Dowlah to kill him, and
  I'll tell you anything you want to know."</p>

  <p>Tom laughed. "Tell me why you and he quarreled. If I believe that, perhaps
  I'll believe the rest of it. Look out! Stand clear. Here comes the hotel
  elevator! You say the monks won't give you shelter?"</p>

  <p>"No. No women. And I made a mistake. I shouldn't have mentioned the
  Thunder Dragon Gate. I did it to impress them. But it worked the wrong way.
  Now they say I'm shang-shang-ridden. They know more than you'd think. They
  have mysterious ways of sending and receiving messages. They don't know who
  Dowlah is, but they knew his name&mdash;knew he was coming. They expect
  Lobsang Pun, and they had sent a messenger along the road eastward to warn
  all travelers against Dowlah. The B&ouml;n captured the messenger, but he escaped
  when Dowlah shot the two magicians. Have you anything to eat?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28">CHAPTER 28.</a><br>
  "You shot Tara-eke! You blamed Pavlov."</h2>

  <p class="first">IT could hardly be called a basket. It was a crate built of
  tamarisk boughs, lashed with raw-hide. It swung in the wind at the end of its
  rope and made a sort of parachute landing, about a hundred feet to one side
  of its beam. Two monks let themselves out, no worse for the
  adventure&mdash;smiling, gentle-looking fellows, spinning prayer wheels at
  sight of Su-li Wing, courteous to Tom, and even reverential when he showed
  them Lobsang Pun's seal in the moonlight. One by one they pressed the seal
  against their foreheads.</p>

  <p>After that, they invited Tom to enter the basket and be hauled up. But he
  wanted food for the ponies, nothing else. He had his own tent. He reproached
  them for refusing shelter to Su-li Wing. They whirled their prayer wheels in
  self-defense, and appealed to Tom's own Tibetan followers for corroboration
  that it wasn't customary, or even lawful to admit women. Above all, not that
  woman. There and then mutiny started.</p>

  <p>The headman announced he was going no further. He and his men would wait
  for the Holy Lobsang Pun, whose servants they were. He demanded to be paid
  off, and to receive the promised bonus. Taking his cue from the monks, he
  declared Su-li Wing was a witch who would bring to pass terrible disaster.
  When the Holy Lobsang Pun Rinpoche should come and exorcise the evil that
  otherwise would certainly result from the B&ouml;n magician's death, then it might
  be sensible to dare new dangers. He climbed into the basket. Tom hauled him
  out.</p>

  <p>"One of the others may go up, along with the monks, and bring down plenty
  of feed for the ponies. After that, you may all go to the devil. Ask Lobsang
  Pun for your bonus and see what you get!"</p>

  <p>So one man went up, he and the monks singing together in the cage that
  swung in the biting wind and bumped the cliff. The ascent took fifteen
  minutes. At the summit they had to catch a mooring rope and be hauled in to a
  dock that was out of sight from below. Meanwhile, the headman tried to change
  Tom's mind. He couldn't. So he changed his own. He would go anywhere with
  Tum-Glain, now, at once, or at any other time. But it would be better to have
  nothing to do with that woman.</p>

  <p>"If these holy monks, who are good people, won't give her shelter, she
  must be very evil."</p>

  <p>"Pitch the tent. Prepare tea," Tom ordered.</p>

  <p>He spread his own blankets, on a doubled yak-hide on the snow, for Su-li
  Wing. She turned in, well fed by the Tibetans, and fell asleep almost at
  once. When the basket came down with several loads of grain, and he had fed
  the ponies, Tom turned in, between her and the headman. The Tibetans put a
  prayer streamer and a turquoise charm between her and him. They chanted
  several mantrams before falling asleep.</p>

  <p>When the first daylight stole into the tent, Tom lay still watching Su-li
  Wing searching his bag. She found Abdul Mirza's package,
  weighed&mdash;felt&mdash;considered it. Presently her hand came feeling
  inside Tom's jacket for his Mauser pistol. She stifled a scream when he
  gripped her wrist and held on until she let go of the Mauser and he was sure
  she hadn't a knife in her other hand.</p>

  <p>"Dowlah took mine," she remarked matter of factly. "You are not such an
  oaf as Dowlah said you are. You sleep like a weasel, with one eye open."</p>

  <p>The Tibetans boiled tea again, over horse-dung fuel. The monks sent down a
  meal of hot barley porridge, with the Abbot's compliments. Tom went to
  examine the ponies. He fed them before he returned to the tent.</p>

  <p>"Su-li Wing, how tired were Dowlah's ponies?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nearly as tired as yours. He left food for them, and his tents, in charge
  of two men at this end of the high pass that leads to Nepal. That's where
  he's camped with your girl friend. But what do you think you can do to
  Dowlah? You and five men with one pistol between you! If you want my help,
  buy it."</p>

  <p>"Su-li Wing you are going to talk."</p>

  <p>"Oh, am I? Suppose I wait for Lobsang Pun. These monks expect him. What if
  I wait and talk to him?"</p>

  <p>Tom reached inside her coonskin coat. She had cached some dry bread,
  cheese and two cans of condensed milk. He placed them out of reach.</p>

  <p>"Wait for Lobsang Pun if you like. You'll be hungry."</p>

  <p>"You'd let me starve?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, why not?"</p>

  <p>"Buy me. Tom Grayne, I need money. Dowlah took mine. I know more about
  Tibet than you'd ever dream. And I need five thousand rupees."</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"It costs money to return to Peking."</p>

  <p>"Not five thousand rupees, it doesn't."</p>

  <p>"Well, can I live in Peking on nothing? Tom Grayne, what I know is worth a
  high price. You could sell it two or three times over, if you're clever."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you've been too clever," Tom answered. "Moscow wouldn't leave you
  short of funds if you'd played straight. Dowlah took your money? He'd do it.
  But I bet you hadn't any. You hadn't paid your servants, or they'd have stood
  by you, not Dowlah. Talk, Su-li Wing, or I'll leave you flat."</p>

  <p>"Will you give me a break, if I tell?"</p>

  <p>"Depends on what you tell. You'd better come clean."</p>

  <p>"Tom Grayne, there's a Russian named Pavlov, who is so jealous of me that
  he can't see straight. He ditched me and reported me to Moscow."</p>

  <p>"Bela Pavlov? The half-Hungarian who shot the Chinese magistrate in Urga
  three years ago? Was it he who polished up your English? I was at school with
  that bird. He and I learned Tibetan from a Chinese herbalist in Cleveland.
  Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"That is part of the information that I will sell, for a fair price."</p>

  <p>"Try to sell it to Lobsang Pun. I've heard he has 'em whipped if they
  won't answer questions. Compared to that old humorist, I'm easy. I will stake
  you to some journey money, on conditions. Lobsang Pun would stake you to the
  fresh air and a flogging, with his blessing to follow. Why did you quarrel
  with Dowlah? Tell it like a telegram. I don't want any dope on communism, or
  why girls leave home."</p>

  <p>"Are you so wise you know truth when you hear it?" she retorted. "Well,
  111 try you. Did you know that Dowlah is unmarried&mdash;that he has no
  ranee?"</p>

  <p>"I never gave a damn about it, one way or the other."</p>

  <p>"I told Dowlah in a message that I sent to him by way of Nepal, that he
  could make me Ranee of Naini Kol or I would betray to the Indian Government
  his link-up with Moscow. In that way, I could have restored my standing with
  the Comintern. I could do a lot with the Indian women. Dowlah answered he
  would do it. That was why I went to Khatmandu to meet him."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't Dowlah kill you somewhere in the passes?" Tom asked. "Who'd
  have blamed him?"</p>

  <p>"He thought he needed me," she said, "until he captured Elsa Burbage.
  After that, he'd have liked to kill me, but she made such a fuss about his
  killing the B&ouml;n magicians that he thought twice. He's sweet on her. He
  doesn't want to quarrel with her. He supposed I would die of hunger, anyhow,
  or perhaps be eaten by wolves. He knew the monks wouldn't shelter me. Like a
  fool, I told him that every monk between here and Lhasa believes it was I who
  killed Tara-eke. I didn't. Pavlov did that. But they blame me, because Pavlov
  said I did it. The monks don't mind her being killed. Her very name makes
  them shudder. But whoever kills a devil is supposed to be entered into by
  that devil's spirit. That makes you safe from assault. They're afraid to do
  anything to you&mdash;that includes giving you food and shelter."</p>

  <p>"Who was Tara-eke?"</p>

  <p>"The woman they were keeping for Th&ouml;-pa-ga, to make him mentally
  complacent. Pavlov shot her. Then the B&ouml;ns of Djaring-dzong&mdash;some of
  them have been to Moscow&mdash;tried to put me in her place. The Abbot
  wouldn't let them. So they tried to kill him."</p>

  <p>"Who tried?"</p>

  <p>"The Thunder Dragon Gate people. Pavlov said that was my fault, because I
  wouldn't go in and face it."</p>

  <p>"Face what?"</p>

  <p>"It. In the Thunder Dragon Gate. You wouldn't believe if I told. Let's
  say, I don't know. Perhaps Dowlah will make your Elsa Burbage face it."</p>

  <p>"How did you keep in touch with Dowlah, while he was in Delhi, and you in
  Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I went to see him in Delhi. I was ordered to do that. I traveled as a
  pilgrim across Nepal. On the return journey I arranged the line of
  communication. They teach you in Moscow how to do that, and it's always
  easier to do in a forbidden country than an open one, because the people of a
  closed country feel mysterious and like to have dangerous secrets. After that
  Dowlah came and met me once in Khatmandu, and then again this time."</p>

  <p>"How many Japanese at Djaring-dzong?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, fourteen or fifteen, under a man named Chou Wang, whose real name is
  Naosuki. They pretend they're Chinese Buddhists and very pious, but the monks
  know better. It was Chou Wang, as he calls himself, who persuaded the Thunder
  Dragon Gate people to send a shang-shang party into India, to scare Lobsang
  Pun and to get hold of Th&ouml;-pa-ga, because it was known that Lobsang Pun had
  sent Noropa to London to compel Th&ouml;-pa-ga to return home. They couldn't do
  much without Th&ouml;-pa-ga. They couldn't put a substitute in his place as long
  as he was alive, because he might show up some day. And they didn't dare to
  murder him in England or in India, because the story might reach
  Tibet&mdash;and besides, the Japanese connection with it might have leaked
  out. The English are very fussy about murder, unless they do it them selves
  with machine-guns. But they can kill anybody in the Thunder Dragon Gate, and
  no one the wiser. The Japanese have a substitute ready for Th&ouml;-pa-ga if he
  should prove intractable."</p>

  <p>Tom was keeping an eye on the ponies. He was giving them all the time they
  needed to munch barley and recover their spirit. They were hardy little
  bad-tempered brutes. One of them was already kicking at the others. It was
  already warm in the direct rays of the sun, although it was zero cold in the
  shade of the tent. It was nearly time to saddle up. Tom glanced at the five
  Tibetans, talking together in low tones.</p>

  <p>"And Dowlah?" he asked. "Are he and Pavlov buddies? I mean, are they
  riding the same horse?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered. "Dowlah was afraid of Pavlov. He had never met him,
  but he knew his reputation. Dowlah wouldn't move until I sent him word that
  Pavlov had fled to Sinkiang. The monks drove Pavlov away not long after he
  shot Tara-eke."</p>

  <p>Tom stared at her a moment.</p>

  <p>"You shot Tara-eke," he said suddenly. "You blamed Pavlov for it and he
  bolted. Is that his coat you're wearing?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh? Pavlov," said Tom, "is no easy mark. You must be pretty hot stuff
  if you put one over on him. Pavlov got him self booted out of the United
  States for sedition, racketeering and living off the earnings of prostitutes.
  He went to Russia and became an agent of the Comintern. Trusted agents of the
  Comintern aren't sentimentalists. But they don't leave women subordinates
  without funds, in such a country as Tibet, merely because they're jealous.
  Jealous of you? I know Pavlov. He's a hard, mean, cynical killer, without a
  compunction in his kit. He's too sure of himself to know what jealousy feels
  like. You could lie about that for a year, and I wouldn't believe you. Did he
  try to kill you before he bolted? Quick now! Come clean!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered. "What made Dowlah think you're stupid?"</p>

  <p>"If he thinks I'm dead, that's even better."</p>

  <p>Tom caught the headman's eye and signed to him to begin loading the
  ponies. The Tibetans began pulling down and rolling up the tent and roping
  loads. Since daybreak they had been sitting on the upturned saddles, to warm
  them a bit for the ponies' backs. If a Tibetan thinks of a pony's back, with
  out being ordered to do it, he has something else than mere benevolence in
  mind. Tom quietly cocked the Mauser underneath his jacket, but he continued
  talking:</p>

  <p>"Dowlah counted on capturing Th&ouml;-pa-ga?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But he expected to have to waylay Lobsang Pun. That is why he
  brought so many men. He expected Lobsang Pun would get possession of
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga in Darjeeling. It was very difficult to bring so many men across
  Nepal. Forbidden country, even to Dowlah. Terrible roads. The Gurkhas as
  suspicious as snakes. If it hadn't been for my preparations, he could never
  have done it. They all had to wrap their weapons inside their loads and pose
  as pilgrims. Even so, we were pursued, pretty nearly to the top of the
  Kambu-shar-kang. Dowlah's men almost mutinied. They can't stand the cold and
  the high altitudes. Dowlah planned to lay an ambush for Lobsang Pun,
  somewhere near this monastery, but I think he doubted his men. That was why
  he was so delighted when things turned out as they did."</p>

  <p>Tom whipped out his pistol. He didn't say anything. He didn't need to. The
  five Tibetans reined in. They had mounted the five best ponies and were
  trying to steal away. Warm saddles had been only one precaution; they were
  leading a pony loaded with nearly all the remaining food. They dismounted and
  stuck out their tongues, each man thrusting his right ear forward with his
  hand, in sign of humiliation. Tom gestured with the all-commanding Mauser and
  they returned to work, loading the other ponies. Then he beckoned the
  headman.</p>

  <p>"What is the usual punishment for that offense?"</p>

  <p>"A flogging. But Your Excellency doesn't do usual things. And of what use
  would flogged men be?"</p>

  <p>"You are the headman."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Your Honor."</p>

  <p>"Therefore, it was your fault. Shall I send you with a letter to the Holy
  Lobsang Pun, inviting him to administer justice?"</p>

  <p>"Better anything than His Blessed Holiness's anger!" said the headman.
  "Let me beat these others, and then next time they won't listen to me if I
  tell them to desert Your Excellency."</p>

  <p>"It is you who shall be punished. Since you are too wise to take back a
  letter to His Holiness Lobsang Pun, you shall have a chance to restore
  yourself in my favor, and earn merit, by other means."</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you at the right time."</p>

  <p>Tom examined the loads and the ponies' girths. He hoisted Su-li Wing onto
  a pony with scant ceremony, and gave her a double blanket for her legs. He
  commanded the Tibetans to walk beside their mounts. He led the way on foot,
  striding too fast for the loaded ponies, westward, toward Mt. Everest, that
  gleamed in the sun in the midst of the frozen tumult of peaks that rear
  themselves against the sky between Nepal and Tibet.</p>

  "It would be wasted on me."</h2>

  <p class="first">"TUM-GLAIN," said the headman, "who shall protect us from
  all the devils of these parts? This is evil country. There are snow-men, who
  come like the wind from the mountain-tops."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen one?"</p>

  <p>"No. But I have heard of them. They bite off the tip of a man's nose and
  toes and fingers. They leave the rest of his body undestroyed, and frozen. A
  man can't get another body until this one is utterly decomposed. And the gods
  won't defend us against them unless we have some blessed person with us who
  knows how to pray, and whose prayers are acceptable because of merit earned
  in former lives. You and I lack merit. Otherwise, you wouldn't be a foreigner
  and I wouldn't be compelled to obey you."</p>

  <p>"Acquire merit by obedience," Tom answered; and that gave the headman
  enough to think about to keep him quiet for a couple of hours.</p>

  <p>It was easier to think than to talk, with the bitter wind blowing a gale
  from the eternal ice and snow of the tremendous peaks that blocked the
  horizon. With the monastery out of sight behind them, they were now
  completely surrounded by mountains, whose devils, said the headman, created
  the wind, so that there was no protection from it. Westerly, it seemed to
  come from every direction. It followed ravines and glaciers, dividing into
  howling blasts that fought with one another as they struck the open spaces at
  different angles and whirlwinded the snow in great clouds from wherever it
  clung.</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy even to think. Cold and altitude combined to produce the
  deadly lethargy that had to be fought against minute by minute, stride by
  stride. Frequent halts were necessary.</p>

  <p>"Let us ride, Tum-Glain!" advised the headman. "The beasts are stronger
  than we are."</p>

  <p>But it was better to preserve the riding ponies' strength against
  emergency. Dowlah might have a number of comparatively fresh mounts. The main
  thing was to get in touch with Elsa: let her know she was closely
  followed.</p>

  <p>During one halt, Su-li Wing, with her back to the wind, made another
  attempt to persuade Tom. She was as sentimental as the blizzard; as
  persuasive as the butt-end of a Marxian realist's club.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you pitch the tent and be sensible? Are you so crazy about your
  girl friend that you forget Dowlah has weapons? She is all right. She has all
  my luggage. There is even perfume in one of the bags. Dowlah's tents are
  luxurious, and the cots have air mattresses. She is clean and comfortable,
  and being made love to by Dowlah. No woman is in trouble while she is being
  made love to&mdash;not as long as it lasts. If Dowlah should shoot you, you
  won't have a chance even to be second fiddle."</p>

  <p>At the next halt she was even more contentious. Wind, snow-glare and the
  ultra-violet rays were irritating her beyond endurance.</p>

  <p>"Are those her bags among the loads? Give them to me. then, in exchange
  for mine that Dowlah stole from me to give to her. I need face cream. I need
  snow spectacles. Dowlah took mine. Are you such a brute that you don't care
  how badly I suffer? God! I wouldn't choose to be your girl!"</p>

  <p>Tom gave her the stump of a stearine candle from the tent lantern.</p>

  <p>"Warm that under your arm-pit. Smear it on under your eyes. Keep your face
  covered. You don't have to look charming. It would be wasted on me."</p>

  <p>It was about a mile after that when Tom caught sight of two men crouching
  in the shelter of a frozen snowdrift that formed a bridge between two rocks.
  They were alive, those two. They appeared to be armed.</p>

  <p>"Bandits!" announced the headman.</p>

  <p>"Dowlah's scouts!" said Su-li Wing. "Just beyond that spur of raw rock is
  the ravine where the track begins that leads upward to the pass into Nepal.
  That's where he pitched camp. Oh, you damned fool! Turn back before it's too
  late! Listen. Is it the Thunder Dragon Gate you're after? Turn back, and I
  will show you the other way in! It's longer, and more difficult. But we will
  have the wind behind us at least part of the way, and if we travel fast we
  may get there ahead of him. Do that, and I'll show you how to defeat him and
  let other people kill him."</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" Tom commanded. He turned to the headman.</p>

  <p>"Go forward alone. Tell those two men to come here to me."</p>

  <p>"They may kill me."</p>

  <p>"To earn merit, after behaving treacherously, a man, should be willing to
  run some risk."</p>

  <p>"Well, that is true. But if they kill me, it will be your karma. I will
  try it. Tum-Glain, if they shoot me, you must ask the Holy Lobsang Pun
  Rinpoche to pray for me&mdash;many prayers. After all, I am his servant. I
  don't want to go to hell. It takes a long time to get out of hell, and then
  one has to be gin at the bottom with all sorts of miserable
  incarnations&mdash;worms and rats and such-like."</p>

  <p>He mounted and rode forward slowly. Both men came toward him. They were
  not Tibetans. As they came nearer they appeared to be turbaned Indians, in
  good wind-proof clothing. One had a rifle wrapped in greased cloth; the other
  a repeating pistol in a holster. They walked awkwardly over the snow,
  stumbling, as if their feet were frozen.</p>

  <p>They evidently had no speech in common with Tom's headman. After two or
  three minutes of futile gesturing they took hold of his saddle, one on either
  side, and submitted to be half-towed to where Tom waited for them. Bearded.
  Brown-eyed. Military looking. They saluted respectfully. After the man with
  the repeating pistol had beaten the frozen snow out of his beard and had
  smoothed it a bit, he handed Tom a scrap of folded tin-foil from a cigarette
  tin.</p>

  <p>Tom turned his back to the wind, removed his gloves and unfolded the tin
  foil within the shelter of his opened over coat. Inside it was a piece of
  thin white paper, also from a cigarette tin. It was almost covered with
  pin-pricks. He smeared the back of the paper with soot from the top of the
  candle-lantern. It was easy to read then:</p>

  <p class="letter">Th&ouml;pe is being splendid. Dowlah says you dead. I don't
  believe but fear you may be too late. Tom, I think Dowlah is desperate. His
  men are mutinous. I will carry on to give you every possible chance. Man who
  takes this offered help me escape but Thundergate not far now and you may be
  near. So will stick it out. Good luck. ELSA.</p>

  <p>Tom turned to the man with the rifle and spoke in Hindustanee:</p>

  <p>"What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, Rajah Dowlah brought us sepoys of Naini Kol, by way of Khatmandu
  in Nepal, across the Roof of the World. We came by forced marches, not
  knowing why, but because we were his men and he ordered it." He stared at
  Su-li Wing. "In Khatmandu, this woman waited for us. And as long as she was
  with us all went well, although the Gurkhas of Nepal made trouble. But she
  showed us how to escape from the Gurkhas. In the high pass we nearly
  perished. After we had pitched camp at the foot of the pass, Rajah Dowlah led
  us along this way, past a monastery. He commanded us to attack a party of
  Tibetans, who rode toward us. But there was no fighting. They surrendered.
  He, and a man named Noropa whom we had seen in Delhi, slew two leaders of the
  party, and from one of the dead leaders he took a writing&mdash;I know not
  what, but it pleased him greatly. There were many Tibetans, and among them an
  English lady, who gave me that message when I crawled to the tent before
  daybreak, whispering to her that we sepoys of Naini Kol are honorable men,
  who perceive that we are being forced to become brigands, to which we now
  refuse consent before it shall be too late."</p>

  <p>"How is she?" Tom demanded.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, she is a very brave young woman, full of mockery of Rajah Dowlah.
  When he entered her tent she threw hot tea at him. There is a Tibetan named
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga among the prisoners. They protect each other, they two, and they
  share the same tent. He was in there when I crept to the tent for speech with
  her. I said: we sepoys of Naini Kol would protect her. I told her the truth,
  that we had agreed among us to go no farther with Rajah Dowlah, but to see
  what could be done about reaching India by some other route. She spoke to me
  of Tum-Glain, and I remembered having seen Your Honor through the door of His
  Highness's library, one night in Delhi. She begged me, if by any means I
  could, to deliver a message to Your Honor. So I promised, and she pricked it
  with a pin by candlelight. When morning came we refused to march. There was a
  bad scene. His Highness rode away westward, with the lady and with all the
  Tibetans we had captured."</p>

  <p>"Had you all your weapons?"</p>

  <p>"No. Nor much food, sahib. Rajah Dowlah had sent that man Noropa in the
  night to steal as many rifles from us as he could. He stole nine, one by one
  I suppose, while their owners slept. We were very weary. Rajah Dowlah had
  said we need not post a sentry. Knowing we were disaffected, before daylight
  he had armed those Tibetans with the rifles that Noropa stole from us."</p>

  <p>"Did you try to protect Miss Burbage?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. We called to her. We bade her turn back, and we slapped our rifles.
  She saw, sahib. She heard. She understood. She waved her hand and said
  nothing, smiling. But at me she looked with meaning, as much as to say I
  should not for get my promise. Had she appealed to us, we would have acted
  otherwise. But it seemed to us all that she knew what she was doing."</p>

  <p>"Did Dowlah take all the ponies?"</p>

  <p>"No, he left the lame ones."</p>

  <p>"How many are you?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty men, sahib, with one pistol and eleven rifles."</p>

  <p>"Weren't you forty, all told?"</p>

  <p>"We from Naini Kol are twenty men. There were also twenty
  porters&mdash;Sherpas from Nepal. They all deserted by way of the pass, at
  daybreak. We feared to follow, not being mountaineers. Sherpas are like
  monkeys on a mountain, and they love snow."</p>

  <p>"Who is in command of you?"</p>

  <p>"I am, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Have you any money?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Enough provisions to reach India?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. How far is it? By which road? Sahib, did we do wrong to permit
  the English lady to ride away? We are true men, we sepoys. We deserted our
  prince because our <i>izzat</i>* was offended by the murders we saw him do.
  We are afraid, but we are not cowards. If the sahib will take command of us,
  we will obey."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Izzat</i> (Persian and Urdu)&mdash;honor: the honor
  or reputation of a person, organization, or institution. ]</p>

  <p>"I find no fault," Tom answered. "That is, if you are telling the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"If I have lied by as much as a word, may Allah do so to me, and
  worse!"</p>

  <p>Tom went to his bag and broke open Abdul Mirza's package. He counted out
  fifteen hundred rupees. He gave a thousand rupees to the man from Naini
  Kol.</p>

  <p>"I can't accept your offer. You and your men must march to India by way of
  the Sepo La. Start immediately. Wire from the first telegraph-station in
  Sikkim to Abdul Mirza, in care of Miss Nancy Strong of Darjeeling. I will
  write her address for you. She will know where he is. You will report to
  Abdul Mirza, at whatever place he directs, and you will tell him that I gave
  you money for your journey, so that you needn't beg or pillage. If, on your
  way you should encounter a Tibetan priest-nobleman named Lobsang Pun, with a
  large following, you may tell him your story and say that Tum-Glain urges him
  to come with all possible speed. Thereafter, until you meet His Excellency
  Abdul Mirza face to face, you hold your tongue, lest trouble come of it.
  Silence. Do you understand that?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Atcha</i>,* sahib. But how shall we find this what is it? this Sepo
  La?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Atcha, acha</i> (Hindi)&mdash;good! all right!
  ]</p>

  <p>"This lady&mdash;Su-li Wing&mdash;will show you. Ask her no questions, and
  you will not need to lie when you say, like an honest soldier, that you know
  nothing against her. When you reach India, but no sooner, give her this, for
  herself."</p>

  <p>Tom handed him five hundred rupees. Then he turned to Su-li Wing:</p>

  <p>"There you are. I said I'd stake you to some journey money. You've an
  escort thrown in."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean you're running me out of Tibet?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Without prejudice. Tell your own story. About the worst they can do
  is to deport you from India and pay your fare."</p>

  <p>"Do you call that giving me a break? Marching orders and five hundred
  miserable rupees? My luggage, that your girl friend has stolen, is worth at
  least five thousand rupees! I hope Dowlah rapes her, and then kills her! Give
  me her luggage. It's worth at least <i>something</i>."</p>

  <p>Tom turned again to the man from Naini Kol.</p>

  <p>"Did Rajah Dowlah carry off this lady's luggage?"</p>

  <p>"No, sahib. There are several loads of it. His Highness offered it to the
  English lady, but she refused. She wouldn't even permit the porters to carry
  it into the tent we pitched for her."</p>

  <p>"Snooty little bitch!" said Su-li Wing.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30">CHAPTER 30.</a><br>
  "Bandits! Let us turn back!"</h2>

  <p class="first">DOWLAH'S camp site, at the foot of the almost unnegotiable
  pass into Nepal, looked stricken, dismal, hopeless. The men from Naini Kol
  lined up and faced the wind. They were ashamed of being mutineers. They said
  so. They were equally ashamed of feeling beaten by the cold, the unaccustomed
  food and the altitude. They were angry with their subadar* for having agreed
  to return to India. They said that vehemently. They felt guilty of having let
  Elsa Burbage ride away with Dowlah. Muffled to their ears, and with their
  loads already packed on half-starved and exhausted ponies, they demanded,
  with chattering teeth, to be given a chance to restore their
  <i>izzat</i>&mdash;their soldierly honor.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Subadar</i>&mdash;an Indian Army mid-rank officer
  equal to a Captain. ]</p>

  <p>"That's a brave offer," said Tom. "I respect you for it. But I can't
  accept. I'm not a British official, I'm American. You men are in foreign
  territory without permission or authority from any one. As I see it, you
  obeyed your Rajah's orders until you had reason to believe he was acting
  criminally. After that, you refused to obey. Well and good. But if the
  Tibetan soldiers from Kalimpong should catch you, you'd be massacred. That
  might cause bad international trouble. I am here as a foreigner at my own
  risk. I have no authority. But I have given your subadar a letter to Abdul
  Mirza, and I don't think you will be in disgrace when you get back, if you
  hold your tongues."</p>

  <p>Su-li Wing tried harder than the men from Naini Kol to change Tom's
  mind.</p>

  <p>"Look here," she said, "Tom Grayne, I'm for sale. You buy&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>"No, I've told you."</p>

  <p>"Don't you be a damned fool," she insisted. "If you follow Dowlah, he will
  kill your girl friend, sooner than let you get her. I know him. Once a man of
  Dowlah's type be comes a killer, he goes on killing. I have seen scores of
  men, in China and in Russia, who burned their bridges after intriguing
  themselves into a desperate situation because they thought themselves more
  clever than any one else. They all took to murder. First they killed one
  person, then another, and then several. After that, they were like wolves
  that kill sheep, because to kill sheep is so easy."</p>

  <p>"You're a killer yourself," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>"You can't prove it! But you can buy me. I will stay bought. Give me the
  breaks, and I will show you how to get what you want in Tibet. I will show
  you how to get ahead of Dowlah. I haven't told you all I know. We
  professional spies should be as members of one brotherhood."</p>

  <p>"Good-by," said Tom. "Good luck to you. Short rations as far as Sikkim,
  Su-li Wing. After that you'll be able to eat your fill. If you take my
  advice, you'll talk small when you get to India."</p>

  <p>He offered to shake hands. She refused. He returned with a genial grin the
  salute of the men from Naini Kol, then rode away at the head of his Tibetans.
  He was uncertain why they followed without protest. But after a mile or two
  the headman explained:</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, in some other incarnation you must have done something to
  entitle you to wisdom in this one. In another life you ought to be entitled
  to some mercy, for your mercy to us now. We feared that for a punishment you
  might dismiss us and take some of those Indians instead. Then the soldiers
  from Kalimpong would have killed us, should they catch them, as is likely,
  because that woman is a bad-luck bringer."</p>

  <p>"You think, then, that the Tibetan authorities may send out a patrol from
  Kalimpong?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Along this road?"</p>

  <p>"No. The soldiers are afraid of the evil spirits hereabouts, so their
  officers wouldn't be able to lead them along this road. But they will block
  the road. Why shouldn't they?"</p>

  <p>"Do you think the Tibetan troops will oppose the Holy Lobsang Pun
  Rinpoche?"</p>

  <p>"A million blessings on His Sacredness, they might! There is no knowing
  how wicked or how stupid soldiers can be. But His Blessed Holiness would make
  a magic, I think, and get by them unseen. If he wishes to come this way, he
  will do it."</p>

  <p>Tom made the most of the Tibetans' changed mood. He accomplished marvels
  of marching, changing the loads frequently from one pony to another. But
  Dowlah's speed was next thing to a miracle. Two days and two nights at his
  heels, but not a sight of him. Tom's mood was merciless to man and beast,
  himself included, but instead of causing mutiny it stirred the Tibetans'
  superstition in his favor. Whenever he called a halt, to let them boil their
  slimy salted tea, in some cave or lee of a rock, or beside black and white
  water that welled amid treeless wastes of moraine and snow, their remarks
  revealed less curiosity than guarded approval. It was the same when they
  huddled together at night, in the tent.</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, tell us how is it that you, a foreigner, who hadn't the
  advantage of being born in this blessed beautiful land, nevertheless are so
  good to be with? You speak our speech so that it sounds comical, although we
  understand you, and you understand us. Which is it? Were you one of us in a
  former life? Were you reborn into some miserable foreign country for your
  former sins? Or are you a foreigner, too good for your own wretched country,
  being made ready, be cause of merit, to be reborn, at the proper time, in
  this blessed land? If so, better die soon, sooner to be reborn!"</p>

  <p>One more day, speed dwindling, and then food for the famished ponies! A
  load of barley on the snow, beside a dead horse. Ravens had arrived, but no
  vultures. The horse's carcass was hardly cold. The Tibetans apologized for
  cutting off meat for themselves. They admitted they were robbing birds and
  wolves. It wasn't decent food. Nevertheless, it wasn't so indecent as if they
  themselves had killed the animal. Hungry men mayn't be choosers. They were
  pious about it. They said their prayers for the soul of the sinner that had
  been incarnated in the horse because of sins in former lives. They wished him
  a better incarnation next time. They ate the meat raw, ravenously, throwing
  stones at the ravens because they are birds of very bad omen for the
  liberated soul whose dead carcass they insult with their beaks. They shouted
  aloud for the vultures to come and drive the ravens away.</p>

  <p>Tom studied the trail, protecting his eyes from the wind with his gloved
  hand. It would be dark in less than two hours. The dead horse lay exactly at
  the summit of a narrow pass between high mountains that were part of the
  jumble of summits that hide Everest from almost every direction. From where
  he stood, a crag-flanked, bouldered gorge led downward, so nearly straight
  between the flanks of mountains that he could see the black-purple shadow of
  a valley, perhaps twenty miles away, five thousand feet below him. Darker
  seams in that shadow might even be tamarisk scrub. It looked like comfortable
  country, as one reckons comfort in Tibet. Fuel. Less wind. Altitude where
  breathing would be no effort, where three or four hours' deep sleep would
  really rest man and beast.</p>

  <p>But the ponies couldn't possibly do twenty more miles. It might take them
  another day to reach that valley. They needed eight hours' rest, and another
  meal, before attempting the boulder-strewn descent. It would be a sheer
  impossibility in darkness. It would be many hours before the moon would rise
  over the peaks, and then not long before it would pass behind other peaks, so
  there would be no night march in any event. He looked for a good place to
  bivouac, wishing he had field-glasses.</p>

  <p>Presently, on the right-hand side of the descending trail, about four or
  five miles away, and two hundred feet above it, he saw what looked, in the
  sunset shadow, like the mouth of a cave. If he could have only afforded the
  time, it would be a good place to await the morning sun. A good place any
  how. It seemed accessible. There would be room in there for the ponies, and
  no need to pitch the tent. He pointed it out to the Tibetans and led the
  way.</p>

  <p>For a while he lost sight of it, because the track led down ward, a
  thousand feet in half a mile, between broken cliffs where the loaded ponies
  had to be manhandled over the slippery rock. Then he saw it again, through a
  saw-tooth gap&mdash;halted&mdash;beckoned the headman:</p>

  <p>"Can you see any one in that cave?"</p>

  <p>"Bandits! Let us turn back!"</p>

  <p>"How many can you see?"</p>

  <p>"One."</p>

  <p>"I also. Man or woman?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell. It is some one sitting by a fire of sticks, not a
  dung-fire. That means horses, or else porters, and that means danger for us.
  There are no prayer flags hereabouts. This is a country where the holy lamas
  haven't driven away the devils. So whoever is here is a dugpa,* who obeys
  devils, or else they obey him, which would be even worse. Let us turn back
  quickly, while there is time."</p>*

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Dugpa</i>&mdash;devil-priest; strictly speaking, an
  adherent of the Buddhist religion of Tibet who, previous to the reform by
  Tsong-kha-pa in the 14th century, followed sorcery and other more or less
  Tantric practices, which are entirely foreign to the pure teachings of
  Buddhism. ]</p>

  <p>Tom led forward, doing two men's share of the exhausting work of holding
  up ponies over rock worn smooth by ice and wind. Here and there a hoof-mark
  was discernible. In one place, on a pocket of frozen snow, there were at
  least twenty hoof-marks. But no sign of Elsa.</p>

  <p>At last the ponies stood heaving, with trembling legs, while he studied
  the mouth of an ascending, winding track that led through a break in the rock
  wall on the right hand, toward the cave on the mountain-side. From where he
  stood he couldn't see the cave, but it was a well-worn causeway that led to
  it. Some of it was artificial, laid with flat stones set edgewise. There were
  traces of yak-dung in the crevices, left by the men who had gathered the
  stuff for fuel. There was quite a lot of yak-dung farther down the trail
  toward the dark valley, and some of that was recent.</p>

  <p>The Tibetans refused to go a step farther. They declared they would wait
  for the moon and then turn back, unless some one should come from that cave,
  meanwhile, and kill them all. They were panic-stubborn.</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, if we die at dugpas' hands, without a holy lama to protect us,
  devils will pursue our souls through outer darkness. No, not another footstep
  forward! Go on alone, if you are as brave as all that."</p>

  <p>Tom glanced at the pony that carried the load that held the money-bag.
  That pony&mdash;it was his own, the strongest&mdash;might perhaps have had
  enough strength to retreat uphill. Tom laughed at the headman.</p>

  <p>"What would you do with money in the next world?"</p>

  <p>Then he filled his lungs and shouted:</p>

  <p>"Hullo-hullo-hullo! <i>Koi hai! Koi hai!</i>"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Koi hai</i> (Hindi)&mdash;Is anyone there? ]</p>

  <p>The shout went clamoring from crag to crag. It seemed endless. It was like
  a thousand hollow voices of the devils of the night, that came hurrying out
  of the valley. The Tibetans laid their foreheads on the rock between
  flattened hands. The headman moaned the sacred <i>"Om mane padme hum!"</i>
  The others, a word behind him, moaned it louder, until they caught up with
  him, all chanting faster and faster. It sounded like "Three Blind Mice."</p>

  <p>Tom cocked the Mauser and waited, gripping the butt with his ungloved hand
  inside his overcoat. He was dog-tired. He leaned in the icy shadow of a huge
  boulder in the middle of the track, flexing his muscles to keep them from
  growing numb.</p>

  <p>It seemed ten minutes, but the shadow wasn't ten minutes deeper, before
  footsteps clamored on the causeway. Echoes magnified them into a prodigious
  noise that resembled the clatter of small stones falling from the higher
  ledges. Who ever was coming made no secret of it. But Tom stayed in the dark
  where he was, making sure of his footing. He made sure of his grip on the
  Mauser. The Tibetans ceased chanting and lay as still as dead men.</p>

  <p>It seemed ten more minutes before a man came and stood in the gap, in the
  last of the reflected sunset, staring. He was wearing snow-spectacles, with
  his head in a hood, above wind-proof, fur-lined clothing. He stared at the
  Tibetans&mdash;at the ponies&mdash;pulled off his spectacles to peer into the
  deepening shadows&mdash;</p>

  <p>Tom spoke, quite quietly:</p>

  <p>"Dowlah, put your hands up! Put them high over your head!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's you, is it? I thought&mdash;I mean, I hoped they had buried you
  in Darjeeling."</p>

  <p>"I won't repeat the warning."</p>

  <p>Dowlah put his hands up. "Curse you, are you an immortal? Where's that
  Chinese woman? You must have passed her."</p>

  <p>"Keep your hands up!"</p>

  <p>Tom told the headman to go and search him. Comforted by the Mauser, the
  headman obeyed.</p>

  <p>Dowlah had no weapon.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31">CHAPTER 31.</a><br>
  "I was in trouble some years ago."</h2>

  <p class="first">"You see, I had to sleep," said Dowlah. "Hee-hee! I've had a
  good sleep. You haven't had. What are you going to do about that Mauser?
  Shoot me, or strike a bargain?"</p>

  <p>They sat facing each other, across a wood-fire near the mouth of the cave,
  their faces glowing but their backs protected with heavy sheepskin from the
  icy wind. No moon yet. Pitch dark. The Tibetans had refused to enter the
  cave. They said it belonged to dugpas; it was occupied by home less souls,
  too wicked to have bodies. They were afraid, too, of Dowlah. But Tom had
  prevailed on them to lead the foundered ponies, and to climb with the loads,
  to a wide ledge below and beyond the cave. There they had pitched the tent
  and 1 ad a fire of their own, amid leaping shadows.</p>

  <p>The cave contained plenty of fuel, tied in yak-load bundles. Tom had
  cooked tea and a meal for himself and Dowlah. No lantern. Firelight was
  sufficient.</p>

  <p>Tom was sleepy. Dowlah knew it. Tom had shaved recently and his tired face
  looked at least civilized, but Dowlah's tangle of black whiskers was a
  scandalous mess, through which his eyes gleamed with fire-lit malice. The
  dilettante, amateur scientist's pose had vanished, but he hadn't lost his
  giggle. If he was feeling beaten or afraid, he didn't show it.</p>

  <p>Tom forced the issue. "My Tibetans," he said, "are out of gas. Four flats
  to a man. They won't go another yard for ward. In the morning I'm going to
  take the two best ponies and go on alone."</p>

  <p>"To your death," said Dowlah.</p>

  <p>"You may go with my Tibetans," Tom answered. "Over take your own men.
  They're a bit ashamed of having let you make a monkey of yourself. They'll
  take you safe back to India. The British will probably let you go and live in
  Monte Carlo on a pension, like the other rotten rajahs, who aren't worth
  hanging. They're not bad sorts, the British. True, you're a bloody murderer,
  and they'll soon know it. You're a double-triple-crosser, and they already
  know that. But they've plenty of sense. They're not likely to make a public
  scandal, if you accept banishment and hold your tongue."</p>

  <p>"My dear man, what an imbecile you are," said Dowlah. "You're a poor spy
  and a worse psychologist. Do you mistake me for a man who will accept
  humiliation? Are you going to use that Mauser?"</p>

  <p>"I don't have to," Tom answered. "I need sleep. I'm going to fix you
  first. What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"Produce a drink and I'll tell you."</p>

  <p>"I don't use liquor. There's plenty of tea. Help yourself. I won't ask any
  question twice. How did Elsa put one over on you?"</p>

  <p>Dowlah grinned. "You strong, silent, tough, abstemious, big blundering
  brutes never fail to fall for little women, do you! You may as well be
  disillusioned now as later. I will tell you the truth about your
  sweet-innocent Elsa Burbage. Smart little devil! I told her you're dead, as I
  supposed you were. A man said he had killed you. She didn't care a damn. Not
  a damn, Mr. Lowly Lothario Grayne. Mr. Mute Mephistopheles Grayne and your
  miniature Marguerite! She began to play her own hand from that minute."</p>

  <p>He paused, watching Tom's eyes in the firelight. His own eyes were
  contemptuous, but cunningly alert. He continued:</p>

  <p>"I confess she put one over on me, as you call it. She saw me get rid of
  Su-li Wing, and I don't doubt that gave her this idea. Clever little
  hypocrite! Butter wouldn't melt in her mouth. Pretended to be sorry for Su-li
  Wing. Needed clothing like the devil, but wouldn't even look at the other
  woman's luggage. Su-li Wing fooled Pavlov, but she hadn't guts enough to kill
  him, and she hadn't brains enough to fool me. All Su-li Wing ever wanted was
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga. He is all that anybody needs, to get control of the Thunder Dragon
  Gate. Elsa Burbage has him by the heartstrings."</p>

  <p>He paused again, but Tom's eyes told him nothing. He continued:</p>

  <p>"It was one of those crises, Grayne, that occur in the midst of all
  well-laid intrigues. The unpredictable. My men had become a liability&mdash;a
  dangerous nuisance. Carefully-chosen men, nevertheless mutinous. So I armed
  some of the B&ouml;ns with their weapons and told them to go home. They're sure to
  fall foul of Tibetan troops from Kalimpong or some where, and be wiped out.
  Serve them right, the ingrates!"</p>

  <p>Tom put some wood on the fire.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Dowlah, "I realized at once, in Delhi, that Elsa Burbage
  was merely using you for her own ends. She hadn't been in my house twenty
  minutes before she was measuring me with her eyes for a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tom interrupted: "Cut that, Dowlah, if you need your front teeth."</p>

  <p>Dowlah chuckled. "Grayne, accept your natural role of victim of a pretty
  little woman's cunning! She is quite capable of taking care of herself. The
  B&ouml;n magician's men&mdash;more than half of them devil-dancers&mdash;regard
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga as the incarnation of a god. She is the god's handmaiden. His
  daffadowndilly. His joy. Thanks to her companionship&mdash;and whatever
  else&mdash;Th&ouml;-pa-ga has recovered his spirits. They share the same
  tent."</p>

  <p>"To protect her from you?" Tom suggested.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I hadn't a chance. Not a chance. Don't be jealous. The B&ouml;ns gave her
  credit for preserving Th&ouml;-pa-ga's life, so she very soon had the B&ouml;ns eating
  out of her hand. Even that treacherous dog Noropa grovels to her. It was he
  who gave her one of my men's pistols. She had the impudence to threaten me
  with it. Tee-hee! Imagine being held up, at my age, by a ninety-pound girl
  with a Mauser! I don't believe she knows how to pull the trigger."</p>

  <p>"She can hit an egg with a service repeater at thirty feet five times out
  of six," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"Oh, can she? Well, the B&ouml;ns were a bit difficult. You see, I had shot
  their leaders. I had to do that. It wouldn't have been safe to get rid of my
  own men while those two rascals were alive. Without leaders, and with
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga and Elsa Burbage on my side, the B&ouml;ns should have been easy to
  manage, but I underestimated her spunk and cunning. I expected she would
  regard me as a rescuer. Instead, she jockeyed me into the position of having
  to look to her for protection. She can talk Tibetan, confound her! I can't. I
  had to depend on her influence with Th&ouml;-pa-ga to keep the B&ouml;ns from killing
  me. I had to pipe down, as they say in the Navy. The only tactical error that
  she made was preserving my life. I can't imagine why she did it."</p>

  <p>"How did you travel so fast?" Tom asked him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the B&ouml;ns had caches of provisions and fresh remounts. Good ponies. We
  rode like the devil. One brute burst his heart at the top of a hill."</p>

  <p>"That's how I found you."</p>

  <p>"Lucky blunderer! Grayne, you were riding to certain death."</p>

  <p>"Talk sense," said Tom. "Your number's up, Dowlah. You know it."</p>

  <p>"Grayne, if you had half the intuition of a dog, you would know without
  being told, that I have burned my bridges. No retreat possible. And I'm not
  the man to be beaten by a situation like this. There's Noropa, a half-boiled
  mystic who believes the gods will love him if he swaps horses often enough.
  By flattering him and telling him a few facts more or less embellished, I
  contrived to undermine egregious Elsa's position. She will find she has no
  secrets, but lots of opposition when she gets to Djaring-dzong. Because of
  promises that I made to Noropa, he is quite sure to bring or send a
  rescue-party. According to my calculation, they should be here by noon
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Does Noropa trust you? Or you him?"</p>

  <p>"No. But he has seen my credentials."</p>

  <p>"The forged letter that you stole from the man you murdered?"</p>

  <p>"Who says it's forged? Who's to prove it, you infatuated ass? It's from
  the Tashi Lama himself."</p>

  <p>"Bunk."</p>

  <p>"Hah! I haven't it on me. It's well hidden. If you should shoot me, you
  couldn't find it. If I had known of its existence a year ago I would have got
  hold of it in time to avoid all this mess. I have known for more than a year
  that I would have to bolt sooner or later. Abdul Mirza, damn him, betrayed me
  a day too soon. But no matter. I got away, through Nepal. That route fooled
  them."</p>

  <p>"You rewarded Su-li Wing for it, didn't you!"</p>

  <p>"Blackmailing bitch!" Dowlah spat into the fire. "When we reached this
  place, I did lose a trick, I admit. There was another gang of B&ouml;n monks
  waiting for us, down below there on the trail, with a herd of yaks.
  Murderous-looking swine. They put most of our loads on the yaks and sent the
  ponies along unloaded, downhill. Some of them wanted to kill me. Elsa
  prompted Th&ouml;-pa-ga, and he objected. Some one challenged his identity, so
  they stripped him naked behind a screen of blankets, to look for his
  birth-marks. He has 'em. They bowed down and worshipped. He'll be a wonder,
  under proper control. He had to do a lot of talking to protect me, but he did
  it. Elsa Burbage asked me to go up to this cave, where I'd be safe while
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga orated. I had no suspicion of what the little sorceress intended. I
  got some of the Tibetans to carry up a few of my personal loads and light a
  fire. I made tea, and I opened a bottle of prunes. I declare she had doped
  them. I remember noticing that the cap wasn't screwed on the bottle tightly.
  When I awoke, it was morning. I had been disarmed. There was no one in
  sight."</p>

  <p>Tom eyed him with curiosity. "You skeptics," he said, "are always
  credulous. Where would Elsa get dope?"</p>

  <p>"Damned if I know. Perhaps you gave it to her for Th&ouml;-pa-ga. Would a
  Tibetan have written in the ashes, with a stick or his fingers, in English:
  'Now it's your turn to be left flat. How do you like it?' Waspy little devil!
  She'll be singing to another tune though, before those Tibetans have
  finished, unless you accept my offer."</p>

  <p>"You haven't made any offer," said Tom. "You weren't doped. You were
  drunk. On the way up here I saw the broken whisky bottle where you threw it.
  Frazzled nerves, and your last bottle of Scotch. One slug might make you
  pye-eyed at this altitude. You drank a whole bottle and fell asleep. Are the
  fumes still in your head? Or are you going to listen to sense?"</p>

  <p>"The point is: have you any sense?" Dowlah retorted. "Are you vain enough
  to think I have been talking for your entertainment? Do you flatter yourself
  that I enjoy your company? Or that I have the slightest intention of
  accepting favors from you? I wish you in hell."</p>

  <p>Tom grinned. "Same to you. I'll bet on my wish. You'll starve here,
  betting on Noropa, until Lobsang Pun turns up, and he'll send you to hell
  with bells on. You haven't food, tent, money, horse or weapon. What's your
  offer?"</p>

  <p>"I know where the Thunder Dragon Gate is."</p>

  <p>"So do I! Down in the valley. Less than a day's march. I've had that doped
  out since day before yesterday. This must be the valley that explains the
  fifty-mile discrepancies on all the maps."</p>

  <p>"But I know how to get in!"</p>

  <p>"Says you, Dowlah."</p>

  <p>"And I know what to do when I get there."</p>

  <p>"I know what to do with you, unless you come clean, Dowlah. I'm not going
  to let a crook like you keep me awake much longer. Speak up."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I will tell you enough to satisfy you that I know a great deal
  more."</p>

  <p>Dowlah stared at the night. There was a wistful melancholy in his eyes, as
  if he were bidding silent farewell to a treasured secret. He leaned forward
  as if he couldn't force himself to say it aloud; he must whisper it. Suddenly
  he scraped up embers with his naked hands and pitched them at Tom's face. As
  quick as a snake he made a grab for the Mauser&mdash;and took the
  consequences.</p>

  <p>"Cry out when you've had enough," said Tom.</p>

  <p>Ready for anything, he had dodged most of the embers, a bit singed,
  nothing serious. He took Dowlah by the neck and rubbed his face in the hot
  ashes.</p>

  <p>"If you want to be killed, try one more trick!"</p>

  <p>He kicked the fire together, holding Dowlah by the neck to examine his
  face by the light.</p>

  <p>"Help yourself to cooking grease from that can. Smear on plenty."</p>

  <p>Dowlah spat ashes. He snarled: "I won't forgive that."</p>

  <p>Tom gave him tea to wash the ashes from his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Dowlah, you're a busted flush and a rotter. But I'll give you a break if
  you act sensibly. You've taken crazy chances. It's a cinch you've a card up
  your sleeve, or think you have. You count on some one in the Thunder Dragon
  Gate. Who is he?"</p>

  <p>Dowlah tied a handkerchief over a scorched eyelid. It made him look like a
  colored-supplement pirate. Tom fetched a bundle of wood and began feeding the
  fire.</p>

  <p>"Sixty seconds," he remarked. "I'll count 'em. One&mdash;two&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dowlah interrupted: "You do show an occasional spark of intelligence. Yes.
  You have guessed it."</p>

  <p>"Do I count? My limit's sixty."</p>

  <p>"I have the goods on Naosuki. Do you know who he is?"</p>

  <p>Tom laughed outright. "Must be good goods! Naosuki is the man who faked
  the Soviet Army mobilization plans that were sold to Germany. He sent the
  genuine ones to Japan. All the insiders were laughing about it. Goods on
  Naosuki, have you? Just now he goes by the name of Chou Wang. I've never met
  him, but that's the ninth or tenth name that I've heard of him using. He's
  the toughest and trickiest secret mischief-maker that Japan ever turned
  loose. He's the man who played the fiddle for the recent dance in Sinkiang
  that cost China a province. Before that, in China, he was too smart even for
  Borodin. Dowlah, are you still so full of whisky that you really believe you
  can blackmail Chou Wang? What's to stop him from having you bumped off? He'd
  no more hesitate to do that than to kill a bed-bug."</p>

  <p>Dowlah snorted disgust. "What is the use of talking to a fool like
  you!"</p>

  <p>"It's your only chance," Tom answered. "Tell me the truth and make me
  believe it. I promised old Abdul Mirza to give you a break if you'd give me
  half an excuse."</p>

  <p>"Oh. What did Abdul Mirza tell you?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty. Do I start counting? All right. One&mdash;two&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I was in trouble some years ago," said Dowlah. "Never mind what. Abdul
  Mirza suggested to me that the best way to regain prestige with the Indian
  Government would be to distinguish myself as a secret agent. Damn his eyes,
  they had already made him ruler of my state, to all intents and purposes. I
  was deeply in debt. Even my house in Delhi belongs to a swine of a
  money-lender. He even holds a bill of sale on the furniture. Instead of
  increasing my income, Abdul Mirza cut it to the bone, to relieve taxation. He
  is one of those humbugging democrats who wants to be loved by multitudes.
  However, I have a natural gift for this game. I did pretty well. But no
  better than rather well, until I got in touch with Naosuki. Yes, he is Chou
  Wang at the moment. I did him lots of favors. You know how it is. You've sold
  your country's secrets scores of times, I don't doubt."</p>

  <p>"I never knew 'em," said Tom. "Our State Department keeps the secrets,
  along with the gold, in a locked tin box."</p>

  <p>"Don't be a sententious hypocrite!" Dowlah retorted. "There isn't an
  international spy in the world who doesn't make a business of selling
  anything he knows to whoever will pay. How much! That's the only question. I
  could never get enough money, but what I craved was intellectual excitement.
  Chou Wang was the man to provide that. I excited him, and he me. All of us
  have our Elsa Burbages on the job. Few of them are quite as smart as yours;
  but very few of us are such blundering boobies as you. Through a woman in
  Singapore, who found a fool of your type in a responsible position, I
  obtained for Naosuki photostatic copies of some plans of the new British
  naval base. They're in Japan now. He has very likely sold copies of them to
  several nations. In exchange, he supplied me with details of some of the
  Japanese defenses of Formosa. Very opportune. I turned those over to the
  British Secret Intelligence in the nick of time to allay their suspicions of
  me."</p>

  <p>"What's the idea of bragging to me that you're a worse crook than I
  thought you?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p>He stirred the fire. Dowlah's uncovered eye glittered with contemptuous
  malice. He lighted a cigarette before he answered:</p>

  <p>"Tom Grayne, unless you can develop enough sense to agree with me, you
  will be dead, or worse, by to-morrow night. Have you ever been tortured? If
  you kill me now, I shall have ceased to care who knows my secrets. When they
  kill you, you will cease to remember them. Is that clear? You ass, you said
  you wish to be convinced. I am convincing you. In simple phrases. Adapted to
  your mulish intellect. For my own purpose. To persuade you that I mean what I
  say in all seriousness, and that I know what I'm talking about."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," said Tom. "I'll listen."</p>

  <p>"What I did not turn over to the British Secret Intelligence was Naosuki's
  private code and some plans of the fortifications of Kobe that reveal his
  finger-prints under the microscope. He sent those to me in exchange for
  certain details of the new American anti-aircraft guns."</p>

  <p>Tom grinned. "How did you get those?"</p>

  <p>Dowlah grinned back. "If you want that information, buy it! I will sell it
  to you. Naosuki is afraid of nothing on earth except myself and the Japanese
  Secret Intelligence. The Japanese are a strange people, as I daresay you
  know. Naosuki is an unmitigated blackguard, who would rather die, of any kind
  of torture, than be shown up as a traitor to his own country. Traitor he is.
  So you see, I have him. Have you enough intelligence to understand that?"</p>

  <p>"If he should kill you, how could you betray him?" Tom retorted. "Left the
  evidence in India, I suppose, to be sent to Japan in case you and he quarrel?
  Dowlah, you're not so bright. How can you communicate with India? Seems to
  me, Dowlah, that you've lost your senses along with your number. Too much
  liquor? All you nervous numbers seem to go by that route."</p>

  <p>Dowlah leaned forward and tapped Tom's knee.</p>

  <p>"Naosuki knows that unless my secret agent in India should hear from me,
  at frequent intervals, my agent will convey that evidence to Tokyo and give
  it to the Japanese Government."</p>

  <p>"Hell! Hasn't Naosuki any agents? Do you kid yourself that his man can't
  shadow your man, and kill him?"</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Tom Grayne, I never kid myself, as you poetically phrase it. I
  have stolen a march on Naosuki. My messenger is already on the way to Tokyo.
  He may be there already. Naosuki's number is up, but he doesn't suspect it.
  By wireless, and secret lines of communication by way of India, it will take
  the Japanese two or three weeks to reach Chou Wang and kill him, or make him
  kill himself, or make his subordinates kill him. But they'll do it. They
  never fail to kill their traitors. By that time, thanks to Naosuki, you and I
  will have possession of the Thunder Dragon Gate and Th&ouml;-pa-ga. I hate to do
  it, but I'm going to have to okay you with Naosuki, in exchange for the
  protection of your Mauser until we connect with him. That is my offer."</p>

  <p>Tom stirred the fire and added fuel. "What do you propose to do with the
  Thunder Dragon Gate?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Even you may appreciate that when you get there. Ditch Elsa. Have her, if
  she's alive. I don't care what you do with her. But if you've any sense at
  all you will give her to Th&ouml;-pa-ga and let her make a fool of him. Th&ouml;-pa-ga
  is the whole problem. There is nothing more to it than Th&ouml;-pa-ga. I will put
  one thought into your thick head and let it try to find lodgment. Suppose you
  should return to America and offer your opulent government a continuous, day
  after day, week after week, authoritative, psychologically skilful
  anti-Japanese propaganda to reach the whole of Asia, but especially China,
  how much would they pay?"</p>

  <p>"Oh. I'm the salesman, am I?"</p>

  <p>"And no sales resistance!" said Dowlah. "You know there's a world war
  coming. If Mussolini doesn't start it, some one else will. All Europe, India,
  Africa. Japan's opportunity to gobble China! Bang goes America's trade, along
  with all the capital invested in China. America's alternatives are guns or
  propaganda. The Thunder Dragon Gate is worth at least a billion to any
  government. And think of the chance for us to make a splash in the
  world&mdash;ten times the splash that Lenin made!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm thinking of that," said Tom. "I draw a modest salary, for taking
  chances now and then to stop that kind of splash before it happens."</p>

  <p>"You? You think you can stop it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know yet. I'm going to keep a promise I made to Abdul Mirza. He
  gave me money for you, but I gave some of it to your destitute men and to
  Su-li Wing. I'm giving you what's left."</p>

  <p>"How much?"</p>

  <p>"Eight thousand five hundred rupees."</p>

  <p>"Keep it! I daresay that's as much as you earn in a couple of years. In
  exchange for it, lend me a pony and escort me either as far as the
  Djaring-dzong Monastery, or until Noropa's messengers meet us on the way.
  After that, you may go to the devil."</p>

  <p>"Here's your money," said Tom. "I'm going to the tent now, to sleep with
  the Tibetans. Don't try to hire 'em to murder me. I might get rough. Offer
  them a fair price in the morning and perhaps they'll take you with them."</p>

  <p>"Where to?"</p>

  <p>"Damned if I care, Dowlah. Good night."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32">CHAPTER 32.</a><br>
  "This is a dreadful place."</h2>

  <p class="first">DOWLAH, a mere fire-lit shadow at daybreak, called from the
  mouth of the cave.</p>

  <p>"To your death, you idiot!"</p>

  <p>The Tibetan headman remonstrated:</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain, turn back with us. We dare not go with you down into that
  valley. Nobly Born, it is from down yonder that come the shang-shangs. It is
  bad luck even to speak of the place. But we like you. We wish to save you
  from terrible things. Perhaps Your Honor hasn't heard that shang-shangs kill
  a man in this world, and then hound him in the next, so that he can't
  reincarnate. Down yonder they give dead men's bodies to the shang-shangs
  instead of feeding them to the dogs and vultures as is decent. Give that man
  Dowlah a pony. You wait here. Let it happen to him. Perhaps then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tom interrupted. "Do as I said in the night. Delay him. Later, if he wants
  a pony, let him have one and follow me, if he wishes. As for you, I have
  praised you in that letter that I have given you for Lobsang Pun. The sooner
  you deliver it, the sooner you will receive his commendation and his
  blessing."</p>

  <p>"But if His Holiness Lobsang Pun Rinpoche should not be coming this way,
  then what?"</p>

  <p>"His Holiness is too shrewd not to come," Tom answered. "The point is that
  he should come quickly."</p>

  <p>Dowlah shouted again from the mouth of the cave.</p>

  <p>"Grayne, I want to talk to you. Come up here for a few minutes."</p>

  <p>Tom continued talking to the headman:</p>

  <p>"Don't rob him. Money or valuables taken from a killer, such as he is, are
  very evil and produce nothing but bad luck. Hold him here until the sun warms
  the morning a bit. Then let him have a pony and go his own way. You go yours.
  Is there another road than this that the Holy Lobsang Pun might follow?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, there is a shorter way than this one. It turns off this side of
  that monastery where they let down the basket. It saves a great distance, and
  it rejoins this road not far from where the dead horse lay. But it is a
  sacred road, and only holy people dare to use it. That is why the B&ouml;ns didn't
  use it. Even those rogues wouldn't have dared to bring foreigners by that
  route."</p>

  <p>"But you are the Holy Lobsang Pun's servants, so you may go and meet him
  along that road? Do that. If you meet him, bid him make haste."</p>

  <p>"Nobly Born, Dowlah may follow and kill you! Better let us take him with
  us."</p>

  <p>Tom laughed. He answered with a Tibetan proverb: "The dog that follows in
  order to steal, by his bark betrays the men who come to slay."</p>

  <p>He shook hands with all the Tibetans and started on his way with the two
  best ponies, lightly loaded. No tent. The loads were principally food, Elsa's
  bags and his own.</p>

  <p>In the distance, from above, the sharp descent had looked almost straight.
  It actually wound like the narrow track of a snake between fifty-foot cliffs
  that had once contained a glacier. It was choked with smooth boulders, and in
  many places so steep and difficult that he had to lend the ponies his
  strength to save them from crashing headlong.</p>

  <p>At the end of ten miles he had descended something like four thousand
  feet. There he rested on a sloping acre of moraine that provided the first
  clear view of the valley into which the trail led. Down below there, spring
  had already greened scant herbage on the banks of aquamarine-colored
  streams.</p>

  <p>The serene splendor produced an almost hypnotic sensation of unreality.
  Much warmer, and the air much easier to breathe. Ponies sweating. No sign of
  the Monastery of Djaring-dzong. It probably faced southward, around a corner
  to the right, where there was a vague haze. Not smoke. It looked more like
  steam from hot springs, hardly moving on a breath of wind. The westerly gale,
  that blows all day long on Everest, seemed not to touch that valley.</p>

  <p>Tom hadn't long to rest. He had twice caught sight of Dowlah, miles
  behind, once riding, and once scrambling be side his miserable pony down a
  fifty-foot glissade. The Tibetans must have been impatient to get started up
  the steep grade and got rid of him sooner than Tom anticipated.</p>

  <p>Uphill from the valley were coming three men, who might be the
  rescue-party that Dowlah had said he expected. Be cause of turns and
  intervening crags and boulders, they had been invisible until they were quite
  near. They were riding yaks, brutes that can climb like goats. One man had a
  bow and arrows; the others had heavy, old-fashioned, long-barreled guns with
  two-legged metal supports on which to rest the weapon when in use.</p>

  <p>The man with the bow and arrows seemed to be the leader. He vaulted off
  his yak, stuck out his tongue at Tom respectfully, placed his hand behind his
  ear and walked straight forward with a letter in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Nobly Born, are you Rajah Dowlah?"</p>

  <p>Rajah Dowlah's name was on the outside of the sealed parchment envelope.
  It had been written with a brush dipped in Chinese ink. The handwriting was
  unmistakably Elsa's. Tom almost snatched the letter from the Tibetan's hand,
  broke the wax seal and tugged it from the parchment envelope. It was in code,
  difficult to read because of the brush strokes. He lay on a rock in the sun
  to work it out with the aid of a pencil. The Tibetans began transferring his
  loads to the yaks.</p>

  <p class="letter">DEAR TOM,<br>
  I <u>know</u> you're not dead, although Noropa and the others all say you
  are. There is a man here who says he killed you in Darjeeling, but I saw the
  blow, so I don't believe him. I know you're coming. I know it. I will stick
  this out to the very end, to give you all the possible chances. I couldn't
  think of any other way than this to get a message to you, but if Dowlah gets
  it he can't read it, so no matter. Dowlah is expected by a man named Chou
  Wang, who is a devil. This is a dreadful place. There have been murders and a
  kind of civil war is going on. The Abbot, who is a Yellow-hat and a friend of
  Mu-ni Gam-po, is Chou Wang's prisoner. Chou Wang has some people here who
  look to me like Japanese. They are well armed. But they are in fear of their
  lives from a faction of Red-hats and B&ouml;ns who occupy the other half of the
  monastery and are supposed to obey a man named Pavlov. There seems to be no
  Pavlov, but I think he is a man who was murdered or else escaped after either
  he or Su-li Wing shot the woman who was being kept here for Th&ouml;-pa-ga. So
  says Noropa, who, however, seldom tells the same tale twice running and is
  obsequious one minute, insolent the next. Chou Wang hates my influence over
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga, who is being a brick and is respected by all except Chou Wang, who
  bullies him. He bullies everybody. He scoffs at the idea of substituting me
  for the Tibetan woman who was shot, but Th&ouml;pe and I are playing that hand for
  lack of a better. Chou Wang had Noropa flogged severely for not having killed
  Dowlah, whom Chou Wang fears, I don't know why. Now Noropa is spying on Th&ouml;pe
  and me, toadying to Chou Wang, but I think he would like to kill Chou Wang,
  whom he certainly hates. But he would kill me if Chou Wang ordered it, as
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga believes he intends. Chou Wang interrogated me so menacingly about
  Dowlah that I had to pretend to weaken to avoid violence. He even threatened
  torture. Thinking me weak, he became care less, so I caught on that he would
  like to trap Dowlah, who he fears is too cunning to come within reach. I
  doped out that they both pretend friendship for each other but are actually
  enemies and from something that Chou Wang said about Su-li Wing, it appears
  that she obeyed Chou Wang's orders to betray Dowlah to the Indian Government.
  Chou Wang accused me of being Dowlah's accomplice. Then I thought of
  pretending to write to Dowlah asking him to come and take me away. Chou Wang
  jumped at that. He thinks I am very simple and scared out of my wits. But I
  insisted Th&ouml;pe must see the letter before it goes. Th&ouml;pe shall show it to
  Chou Wang. I am writing two letters, and when Chou Wang has read the one to
  Dowlah Th&ouml;pe will destroy it and substitute this. Perhaps Chou Wang will kill
  me, when he thinks I have done what he wants. But we may be able to defeat
  Chou Wang by my pretending to be Th&ouml;pe's wife or mistress. It appears these
  monks won't stand for murdering Th&ouml;pe's woman. But it's awkward. Th&ouml;pe takes
  it seriously. He insists you are dead and that you came to him in a dream and
  said so. He wants me to be another Nancy Strong and live with him in Tibet,
  and I daren't be too stand-offish or he might blow up. Th&ouml;pe has my pistol
  safely hidden and not even Chou Wang dares to touch Th&ouml;pe or search him. Some
  of these monks seem decent although madly superstitious, and I think I could
  persuade them to send me safely away. But that wouldn't be right, because I
  think Th&ouml;pe can get me inside the Thunder Dragon Gate, and that may make it
  possible for me to smuggle you in, though I don't yet know how. Tom, I can't
  imagine you dead. I know you're not dead. I know it. I can't imagine you
  doing any thing but win through. I know you will. I'm counting on it. I'm
  positive you're not far away. You shall not fail through any cowardice of
  mine. I have described you, not Dowlah, to the messengers, though Dowlah's
  name is on the envelop. So, if you get this, you will know I am almost at the
  end of my tether but counting on you. Tom, if you should come too late, this
  is good-by and God bless you. ELSA</p>

  <p>Tom shoved the letter into his pocket. The Tibetan messenger led one of
  the yaks toward him, blindfolded, because if a yak should see the act of
  mounting he would presently use his horns to get rid of his rider.</p>

  <p>"Nobly Born, a good beast, who will carry you in comfort."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he saw Tom's eyes. He stepped backward.</p>

  <p>"Have I done wrong? Have I spoken offense?"</p>

  <p>Tom vaulted on to the yak from behind.</p>

  <p>"How far to the monastery?"</p>

  <p>"Nobly Born, being downhill, it should take two-thirds of the time from
  daybreak until now. Your Honor's eyes are angry. How have I given
  offense?"</p>

  <p>"You haven't. Walk beside me and let us talk as we go."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33">CHAPTER 33.</a><br>
  "Got to get into the monastery."</h2>

  <p class="first">DOWLAH was either an expert or immensely reckless horse man.
  He wasn't more than two miles behind when Tom saw him crossing the sloping
  moraine where he had read Elsa's letter. As he vanished again in the bed of
  the winding track, the snub-nosed, gently mannered Tibetan asked:</p>

  <p>"Does Your Honor know who that is who follows?"</p>

  <p>"Have you heard of Tum-Glain?" Tom answered.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Are you a monk?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of the Josays Sept, that used to keep the Thunder Dragon Gate, until
  these changes came to pass. Some of us began to wear lay clothing as a
  protest. Later, they forced us all to do that, and made us labor at the mean
  tasks. We, who used to receive the pilgrims and instruct them, are now
  rhagbyas, reckoned of no account. They even make us handle dead men's bodies.
  They have taken away even our prayer wheels."</p>

  <p>Tom quoted the Tibetan proverb:</p>

  <p>"Night follows the day, but day follows the night."</p>

  <p>"Nobly Born, this is a long night! Ever since the Holy Panchen Lama
  Rinpoche was driven away into exile from Tashi-lunpo by the blasphemers in
  Lhasa who control the army, there has been nothing like the old order.
  Foreigners came here&mdash;two factions&mdash;both claiming&mdash;we say
  falsely&mdash;high authority from Lhasa. But who has true authority in all
  Tibet since the Holy Dalai Lama Rinpoche died? Who knows? They have found
  none yet to replace him. No Tashi Lama! No Dalai Lama! No Th&ouml;-pa-ga! In all
  sacred Tibet, no voice of true authority that all may trust! No longer are
  the pilgrims sent away from here to the ends of the earth with blessed
  messages of peace and wisdom from the lips of the Th&ouml;-pa-ga."</p>

  <p>"Hasn't Th&ouml;-pa-ga returned? I heard he had."</p>

  <p>"Nobly Born, yes&mdash;with a woman, of whom we know nothing except that
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga loves her. Why should he love a foreign woman? Is it the sign of
  the end of all things?"</p>

  <p>"Where is the woman?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. She was in the monastery. But I think now she is with
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga within the Thunder Dragon Gate. They say it. In the old days, none
  would have dared to take her in there. But our Abbot admitted those black
  devils of B&ouml;ns to the monastery, because the Holy Panchen Lama Rinpoche said
  that there is no such thing as evil men, but only evil that corrupts men by
  illusion. Prayer and meditation might have conquered their evil. But there
  was too much evil, and they too fond of it. It was they and their cursed
  magicians who brought the shang-shangs hither, and put them within the
  Thunder Dragon Gate, so that no one else dared to enter. The shang-shang
  doesn't harm them, because their souls are black."</p>

  <p>"Shang-shang? One or many?"</p>

  <p>"One now. At first there were many. The dreadful monsters destroy one
  another unless prevented. Who is to prevent? The females kill the males, and
  it is said that the shamans can't find any more males on the mountain-ledges.
  There were five left, and one little male that was harmless and very afraid.
  Four of them the shamans took to India, in baskets, I don't know why. Some
  said it was to terrify His Holy Eminence Lobsang Pun. Others, that it was to
  greet Th&ouml;-pa-ga, who was known to be coming. Perhaps it was for both those
  reasons. But they left the great one within the Thunder Dragon Gate, with the
  one male&mdash;the very little one. She slew it. Nobly Born, she is enormous
  and old. She is the mother of all those others."</p>

  <p>"Whom do the B&ouml;ns obey?" Tom asked. His eyes were as alert as his ears. He
  could still not see the monastery. Half a mile ahead, a thousand feet lower,
  the track divided left and right. The left-hand fork led upward, past a
  number of caves; but it seemed to lead downward again in the distance and to
  curve to the right to rejoin the other. Half-way along the right-hand track,
  he caught sight of a number of men on foot. It was only a quick glimpse,
  through a gap. He wasn't sure how many.</p>

  <p>The monk answered: "They obey Chou Wang, as I do also, since I must. Chou
  Wang ordered me to bring that letter to Your Honor."</p>

  <p>"Who are the men coming uphill toward us?"</p>

  <p>"Nobly Born, I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Which of the roads below should we take?"</p>

  <p>"The one to the right is easier."</p>

  <p>"Let us take the left one swiftly. They behave like men who wish not to be
  seen."</p>

  <p>The monk made no objection. That, in a Tibetan, was remarkable. All three
  monks went to great pains to keep out of sight, from above or below, until
  the loaded yaks and unloaded ponies began to scramble up the steep left-hand
  fork behind a fanged screen of enormous boulders.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid of those fellows?"</p>

  <p>"Nobly Born, we Josays never know nowadays what to expect. They shoot us
  one at a time, for no reason at all except that we are faithful and say our
  prayers. If we are seen speaking together they shoot us."</p>

  <p>"Who do?"</p>

  <p>"Chou Wang and his followers, who declare they are Chinese, although we
  doubt it. They seem to us like foreigners from some other country. Perhaps
  devils. They throw our shot bodies, while they are still warm, to the
  shang-shang. Does Your Honor know that shang-shangs are the images in this
  world of the monsters that pursue the dead through all eternity? Who shall be
  saved from shang-shangs in the other world, whose body has been mauled by
  them in this present life?"</p>

  <p>"Why haven't you run away?"</p>

  <p>"We are the faithful. We await the coming of the Holy Panchen Lama
  Rinpoche, or of his delegate the Holy Lobsang Pun, to restore the old order.
  Lobsang Pun sent word. He promised it shall not be long now. Should he come
  here and find no faithful?"</p>

  <p>"How many are you?"</p>

  <p>"Nine-and-forty. We were eighty."</p>

  <p>"Why do you trust me with these confidences?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? We faithful await a messenger from Lobsang Pun Rinpoche, who
  isn't likely to send any one we know, lest the messenger should be recognized
  by the B&ouml;ns and slain. I have never before heard the name Rajah Dowlah. How
  should I know Your Honor's business? You speak and you look like one who has
  authority. You might be the messenger, to say His Holiness is coming. If not,
  no matter. What harm could you do?"</p>

  <p>Tom pulled out his permit with Lobsang Pun's seal and signature. He
  unfolded it and held it in front of the monk's eyes.</p>

  <p>The monk stared. He almost went mad. He jumped, danced, slapped his
  thighs, thrust forward his forehead for Tom to touch it with the seal. He
  held it pressed against his forehead as long as Tom would let him. The other
  two came scrambling over rocks to see what the excitement was about, saw the
  seal and signature, and began chanting. All three laid their foreheads on the
  ground until Tom ordered them to get up.</p>

  <p>"My name isn't Dowlah. I am Tum-Glain. Here, you see it written. That man
  who rides the road below us is Dowlah. They who are coming toward him on foot
  are probably some of the B&ouml;ns who brought Th&ouml;-pa-ga. They have been sent
  secretly by a man named Noropa, who may be with them. Have you faithful any
  weapons?"</p>

  <p>"Only such as these things, and no powder! We are men of peace, not
  killers, such as B&ouml;ns are."</p>

  <p>"Would you fight, if I would lead you?"</p>

  <p>"No, Nobly Born. We aspire to merit, on the Middle Way."</p>

  <p>"Would you kill a shang-shang?"</p>

  <p>"We are not killers of anything."</p>

  <p>"What if I should do it?"</p>

  <p>"We would bless you!"</p>

  <p>"You three, with the yaks and ponies, go as fast as you can to the
  monastery. Get your forty-nine together, if you can, and tell them I'm the
  man who saved the Holy Lobsang Pun from two of the shang-shangs that the B&ouml;ns
  took to India! Tell them I'm coming to kill the big one! Wait now&mdash;wait
  a minute! Secretly if possible, get word to that woman who came with
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga. Say to her you have spoken with Tum-Glain. In proof of it, give
  her this."</p>

  <p>He opened Elsa's bag, groped at random and found a little red vanity-case.
  The monk hid it in the voluminous bokkus above his belt.</p>

  <p>"There is magic in that bag. Good white magic, blessed by His Holiness
  Lobsang Pun. Take care that she gets it, and no one else sees it. Tell her
  Tum-Glain is close at hand and very pleased with her. Repeat that."</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain is close at hand and very pleased with her."</p>

  <p>"Right. If you faithful want to acquire great merit, and to receive the
  thousand-fold-fruitful-blessing of the
  Holy-Panchen-Lama-Rinpoche-Representative Lobsang Pun&mdash;in person, mind
  you, he shall bless you in person, touching you with his right
  hand&mdash;then obey that woman! Do whatever she tells you! For every act of
  obedience with which you obey her, I will demand, for each of you faithful,
  one thousand blessings from Lobsang Pun Rinpoche! Now hurry!"</p>

  <p>Tom set the example. He was out of the monks' sight in thirty seconds,
  keeping his head and shoulders low as he clambered diagonally, zigzag,
  downward, toward the point where he estimated Dowlah would meet the men
  coming uphill. He scrambled, slid, fell, clambered and arrived in time to
  look down from a ledge and see Dowlah talking to Noropa. There were seven
  others. They turned and led the way down hill, Noropa leading, Dowlah
  bringing up the rear. Tom scrambled along the ledge. He shouted:</p>

  <p>"Dowlah!"</p>

  <p>Almost too late. A machine-gun from behind some rocks on Tom's left ripped
  out half a belt that mowed down all the Tibetans and Dowlah's pony. Noropa
  was the first to be hit. Dowlah crawled out from under his pony, took cover,
  and climbed until Tom could take him by both hands and haul him to the
  ledge.</p>

  <p>"Got your Mauser?" he asked, panting. There was blood on his knees from
  the climb.</p>

  <p>"Lie still."</p>

  <p>Six men climbed down from the machine-gun nest into the narrow road-bed to
  examine their victims. They were dressed in padded khaki uniforms without
  insignia, and woolen puttees&mdash;short, stocky-looking fellows, as active
  as cats. Tom crawled along the ledge, making too much noise over loose rock.
  There was a tumbled heap of boulders between him and the spot he had marked
  down as the machine-gun nest. Holding his breath, and with the Mauser ready,
  he peered over&mdash;eyes to eyes, breath to breath with a Japanese who was
  looking to see what made the noise. The Mauser's muzzle touched the Jap's
  nose.</p>

  <p>"Shoot, you idiot!"</p>

  <p>But it was Tom's left fist that sent the Jap sprawling head-over-heels
  into the hollow, where a Japanese machine-gun lay in place on its tripod in a
  gap between boulders. Tom jumped on to him. He wasn't hurt much. He had a
  knife, but no pistol. He shouted, once, but a kick in the ribs stopped him
  and the shout didn't seem to be heard by the men below. Dowlah scrambled down
  into the hollow and went straight for the machine-gun. Tom
  objected&mdash;with the Mauser.</p>

  <p>"Come here, Dowlah. Stand there. Keep still."</p>

  <p>Instead of admitting that he knew Japanese, Tom tried the Japanese with
  Tibetan, getting no more response than an ambiguous grin. He tried English.
  The grin changed to a defensive, tight-lipped alertness. So he continued in
  English, speaking slowly:</p>

  <p>"You are one of Naosuki's men. Don't lie about it. I know. He calls
  himself Chou Wang. This man is Rajah Dowlah, to whom Naosuki sold the plans
  of the fortifications of Kobe. The evidence against Naosuki is already in the
  hands of the Japanese Foreign Office. Naosuki is a traitor to his
  Emperor."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"A traveler. Perhaps you have heard of Eiji Sarao? Knowing I was on my way
  to join an expedition, Eiji Sarao asked me to find you people, and to say
  that as many of you as are found in Naosuki's outfit will be handed over to
  your own government. Unless you, too, are traitors to your Emperor, you will
  separate yourselves from Naosuki."</p>

  <p>"Why he&mdash;Eiji Sarao not make that in writing?"</p>

  <p>"Eiji Sarao is dead," Tom answered. "That was his dying message. Get down
  there and tell those others!"</p>

  <p>"Why should they believe?"</p>

  <p>"Dowlah," said Tom, "go down there with him, establish your identity, and
  tell them."</p>

  <p>"What do you take me for?" asked Dowlah.</p>

  <p>"I won't tell you again, I'll kick you down there."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you let them shoot me in the first instance? Is this your
  bucolic idea of a joke?"</p>

  <p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dowlah obeyed. Because his knees hurt him he let the Japanese help him
  down the face of the steep ledge. Tom covered him with the machine-gun. It
  was in good order and perfectly placed; it could sweep the road below in
  either direction. There was a small box of ammunition. Two loaded Japanese
  military rifles lay on a blanket behind a boulder. Below, Noropa's body lay,
  more hideous in death than when alive. Dowlah talked like a machine-gun, too
  fast, very nervous and too emphatic.</p>

  <p>Tom couldn't hear what he said. He lowered his voice&mdash;lowered it
  again. He appeared to be bargaining like a huckster, and the Japs, clustered
  around him, seemed in doubt what to do. At last he climbed back, swearing
  savagely at the pain in his knees.</p>

  <p>"They want us to come and confront Naosuki."</p>

  <p>"Do you dare?" Tom asked him.</p>

  <p>"No. He'd shoot me on sight. Those men admit they were acting on Naosuki's
  orders to blow me to hell."</p>

  <p>"Will you go if I go with you?"</p>

  <p>"No, you madman! I might have convinced Naosuki he's mistaken in
  mistrusting me if you hadn't told that fellow what I've done. You blew my
  last chance, and your own, too, when you did that, damn you!"</p>

  <p>"Okay, I'll go alone," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>"You are absolutely mad," said Dowlah. "<i>Pogal!*</i> You have <i>la
  rage</i>&mdash;hydrophobia!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *<i>Pogal, poggul, poogle, puggly</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a
  fool; an idiot; a madman; often used colloquially by Anglo-Indians. ]</p>

  <p>Tom unloaded both the Japanese rifles. He smashed one rifle against a
  rock. He used the other as a club to break the lock of the machine-gun. Then
  he smashed that rifle, too.</p>

  <p>"Play your own game, Dowlah."</p>

  <p>"Curse you. You might at least have let me have one of those weapons."</p>

  <p>"Taking no chances on you, Dowlah."</p>

  <p>"Chances? But you go with those men?"</p>

  <p>"Sure thing. Got to get into the monastery."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34">CHAPTER 34.</a><br>
  "Any dog can kill!"</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE were outcrops of onyx. A two-mile march into a valley
  that roared with the hurrying water of scores of streams. Stone bridges, well
  built. The monastery came suddenly into view around the thousand-foot high
  corner of a cliff that curved like the handle and blade of a sickle. There
  were splits in the face of the cliff; rough trails marked by chortens,
  vanished into them.</p>

  <p>The monastery was almost snow-white; the diagonal shadow across its face,
  bright blue. It was backed by snow-clad mountains that looked like huge waves
  breaking in dazzling foam. On the roof were the usual chortens, bells and
  Buddhistic symbols. There was almost no wind, so the bells were silent. From
  behind the main building there arose a cloud of dense white steam to a great
  height before it mushroomed and spread, shutting off part of the view of the
  mountains. A high wall enclosed the monastery&mdash;main building, two long
  wings, and what looked like a small town of jumbled roofs. Heads peered over
  the wall; until they moved they looked like big black birds.</p>

  <p>Tom walked behind the Japanese. There had been an argument about that.
  They all had repeaters, but he had his Mauser, so they yielded the point,
  grinning, as much as to say they could manage him comfortably when they
  should be out of Dowlah's range. They had no idea Tom had broken the
  machine-gun.</p>

  <p>Striding along behind them, he was careful to look as little as possible
  like a prisoner. They didn't know he understood Japanese, so they talked.
  They seemed to be puzzled, anxious, discontented.</p>

  <p>He noticed a prodigiously long radio aerial strung high above the
  monastery roof. That was the only modern touch; it looked new; the copper
  wire hadn't turned green.</p>

  <p>The very military-looking man in command of the escort seemed rather
  afraid of his men. He was almost diffident toward them. They kept whispering
  to one another without turning their heads, the way prisoners and monks do
  where there is a rule of silence. Twice he told them they had not acted nobly
  in refusing to try to recapture the machine-gun and rifles. They laughed, and
  one of them retorted that he hadn't led with any noticeable valor. Discipline
  seemed to have become undermined by resentment or disillusion.</p>

  <p>The trails debouching on the monastery from the fissures in the face of
  the cliff looked well worn. Tales of pilgrims from the ends of Asia, secretly
  wending their way to the Thunder Dragon Gate for words from the lips of
  "Wonderful-to-hear," seemed credible. There were caves, too, in plenty that
  might be, or might formerly have been occupied by solitary hermits. It might
  be true that His Holy Magnificence Lobsang Pun had once occupied one of
  those. There isn't any limit to religious eccentricity in Tibet. Humility
  earned in a cave at thirty below zero is exchangeable for arbitrary
  vigor.</p>

  <p>Outside the monastery main gate there was a huge heap of refuse and stable
  manure. It was being carried away in baskets by men in the rags of religious
  clothing. They appeared to be starving. One of them, bent under his stenching
  load, didn't get out of the way soon enough. He was knocked down, and kicked
  as he lay, by the man in command of the escort, who seemed relieved by
  encountering some one on whom he dared to vent malice.</p>

  <p>Tom helped the monk to his feet. The Japanese had marched a dozen paces
  before they realized what he was doing. They didn't hear what he said in
  Tibetan:</p>

  <p>"The Holy Lobsang Pun Rinpoche is coming! Run swiftly and tell your
  brothers!"</p>

  <p>The Japanese, cockier now they were close to the wall, surrounded Tom.
  They tried to make him march in their midst. Their leader, having kicked a
  man and feeling consequently overbearing, laid a hand on him with the usual
  Japanese assurance that no foreigner knows anything about jiu-jitsu. He began
  to use pressure and his other hand reached for Tom's Mauser. So he landed on
  the manure heap, heels-over-head, on his face, with a mouth full of filth.
  Tom drew the Mauser.</p>

  <p>"Shoot it out if you like! There are others coming. Kill me, and see what
  you get!"</p>

  <p>The man who knew English interpreted. Two or three of them got in the way
  to prevent shooting and one of them went to his officer's rescue, brushing
  him off and talking to him. Tom caught the name Naosuki.</p>

  <p>The great gate opened. They marched in, Tom last. There were forty or
  fifty monks within the wall, in groups that seemed unfriendly to one another.
  At least two groups. Perhaps three. They had a sort of jail-yard atmosphere.
  Instead of laughing at the sight of a foreigner, as would be normal in Tibet,
  they scowled; instead of whirling prayer wheels, they talked in surly
  undertones, group by group. Some had cudgels.</p>

  <p>At irregular intervals there was an unplaceable sound like muted thunder.
  It seemed to come from every direction. It was like an earthquake noise,
  without any perceptible earth tremor. Weird.</p>

  <p>Tom's escort turned sharp to the right, marched along the face of the
  right wing of the monastery and turned left into a long courtyard that
  separated the wing from a maze of stores and stables. There were several big
  chortens, and a building that looked like a mausoleum, with a flight of stone
  steps leading to a door near the top of the wall.</p>

  <p>At the far end of the yard was an enormous prayer wheel, built of heavy
  lumber. It was at least fifty feet high, about twelve feet broad, big enough
  to contain millions of prayers written on scraps of paper. It had been
  recently mended with iron straps. It was kept in motion by a waterfall that
  plunged out of the cliff above it, turned the wheel and spilled into a
  sluice, along which it vanished into a hole in the ground. The officer went
  and washed his face at the sluice, rinsing his mouth and grimacing
  savagely.</p>

  <p>Near the wheel a couple of obvious Japanese, dressed as Tibetans, stood
  guard with rifles over a small, newly built stone shed, into which a raw-hide
  belt disappeared. The great wheel had been hitched to a dynamo; its hum was
  quite distinct above the thump-thump-thump of the wheel and the splash of
  water.</p>

  <p>The man who knew English grinned at Tom. He seemed tolerably unresentful
  of the punch he had had in the jaw. He touched his own chest. His eyes nearly
  disappeared amid wrinkles as he grinned with the pride of showmanship:</p>

  <p>"Dynamo&mdash;come in pieces&mdash;long way&mdash;killing many
  horses&mdash;camels! Me, mechanic!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Banzai</i>!" Tom answered, purposely mispronouncing the word, and the
  Japanese laughed.</p>

  <p>Through a thick door in the wall on the left hand they entered a long,
  dark, draughty passage. Near the door there were some monks on mats, engaged
  in silent meditation. One of them stood up and bowed to the Japanese with
  surprising humility, although he didn't stick his tongue out. They took no
  notice of him. Behind their backs he pressed a scrap of paper into Tom's
  hand. Then he squatted again on his mat and appeared to resume his meditation
  where it left off.</p>

  <p>Tom unfolded the scrap of paper. Where a shaft of sun light filtered
  through a narrow slot high in the wall he stopped and pretended to blow his
  nose. Every man of the escort faced about suspiciously, but he managed to
  read the note without their seeing it.</p>

  <p class="letter">Your message received. Oh, Tom! Thundergate entrance is
  through chapel. Beware of shang-shang. Sudden rumor that Lobsang Pun is
  coming has created new situation. They believe he must be bringing a foreign
  army. Th&ouml;pe and Abbot busy propaganding you are special sending to prepare
  way for Lobsang. Chou Wang, deadly desperate, has locked me in room behind
  his office, but this monk is pro-Abbot. He will deliver this to you and get
  me out of here. He promises. ELSA</p>

  <p>Tom crunched the paper in his left fist and followed the Japs. There were
  two stands of piled rifles with fixed bayonets, near a door at the end of the
  long passage. Opposite the door was another, open, through which came
  cigarette smoke and the talk and laughter of the guard. One sentry lounged
  near the rifles. He knocked on the closed door. A bell rang. He opened the
  door. The escort stood aside for Tom. Two of them, the commander and the man
  who knew English, followed him into the room, where they stood at attention
  to right and left of the door.</p>

  <p>Stone walls. Pictures of heaven and hell. Against one wall a large
  radio-receiving set, not yet quite fully assembled, with all its parts
  exposed to view. One window, glazed with oiled paper. A charcoal brazier. A
  tea urn. An immense table. Some Chinese cigarettes. A rather small man seated
  at the table, facing the door, in a heavy wooden chair heaped with cushions.
  An automatic pistol on the table within reach of his right hand. In front of
  him, near the ink-pot, a big bronze dorje, emblem of authority. Beside him,
  at his right, a kneeling monk was rummaging in one of Elsa's bags and laying
  her belongings one by one on the table. Tom's bag was also on the floor, as
  yet unopened. A high, carved screen behind the man in the chair suggested
  that there might be a door there leading into another room.</p>

  <p>Tom walked straight up to the table and spoke first, standing with his
  back to the window within reach of the kneeling monk.</p>

  <p>"Are you Chou Wang-Naosuki?"</p>

  <p>The man at the table touched the automatic. After one sharp glance at Tom
  he nodded to the officer, who at once began speaking very rapidly in
  Japanese, reporting what had happened. He spoke so fast that Tom could hardly
  follow what he said, but that gave him plenty of time to study the man in
  front of him.</p>

  <p>Small, but mentally and physically powerful. His eyes and mustache were
  cat-like. Not a trace of humor. Prodigious shoulders for his size, lumpy with
  muscle and rather stooped. He was wearing a magnificent embroidered Tibetan
  lama's cloak over a red Russian blouse. He looked incapable of any emotion
  other than sulky delight in enforcing his will. Brown, absolutely merciless
  eyes of the color of English ale, which revealed nothing except that mercy
  wasn't in them.</p>

  <p>"Why was this man not disarmed?" he demanded angrily.</p>

  <p>Before the officer could answer he met Tom's eyes and said sharply, in
  English:</p>

  <p>"Lay your weapon on the desk."</p>

  <p>Tom went one step nearer to the kneeling monk.</p>

  <p>"You damned rat, Naosuki!"</p>

  <p>Naosuki pushed his chair back, stood up suddenly and snatched his
  automatic off the desk. Tom kicked the kneeling monk and sent him sprawling
  against Naosuki's legs, upsetting his balance and spoiling his aim. His
  bullet pierced the paper window, followed by another. Tom's fist hit him hard
  on the nose. With his other hand he snatched Naosuki's automatic, hurled it
  through the window, splitting the oiled paper from top to bottom, letting in
  a flood of cold, bright day light.</p>

  <p>It all happened too quickly for the other two men in the room to do
  anything about it. By the time they had drawn their weapons, Naosuki was
  writhing in Tom's arms, barking his own shins against the table edge in his
  efforts to kick Tom's, and crying out to his men not to shoot. They might
  have shot Tom, but they would much more probably have killed Naosuki.</p>

  <p>The noise brought the guard on the run. They nearly broke the door down in
  their hurry. The B&ouml;n monk, on the floor under the table, tried to get his
  teeth into Tom's leg, but all he bit was the top of a boot. Tom had Naosuki
  helpless in an agonizing hold. He shook him the way a terrier shakes a rat,
  hefted him and pitched him across the table into the midst of the guard.
  Their rifles broke his fall. He slid to the floor unharmed, off sloping butts
  and bayonets and got up fuming like a madman, making horrible faces. He
  seemed on the verge of an epileptic fit. Tom's feat of strength so astonished
  the guard that they stood still gaping at him.</p>

  <p>He kicked the monk in the face to make him let go. Then he sat down in
  Naosuki's chair, a split second ahead of a bullet that splintered the screen.
  He produced his Mauser, but didn't answer the shot. And at last he spoke
  Japanese, using the jargon that passes muster along harbor-fronts, pungent,
  plain. He hadn't time to remember grammar and flowers of speech:</p>

  <p>"I have been sent to tell you fools to clear out before you're caught in
  that man Naosuki's company. Have the others told you that he betrayed your
  Emperor's secrets to Rajah Dowlah?"</p>

  <p>Plainly, the guard had been talking it over. Plainly, they had long
  suspected Naosuki. Plainly, if they could only feel justified, they were
  ready to turn on him.</p>

  <p>"Naosuki is a thief, a murderer, a forger, a liar and a traitor to his
  Emperor," said Tom. "What are you honest men going to do about it?"</p>

  <p>Naosuki tried to snatch an automatic from a man's belt, but its owner
  wouldn't let him have it.</p>

  <p>"The game is up," said Tom. "Your expedition has failed. Naosuki betrayed
  you by betraying his Emperor. Save your Emperor's face and what is left of
  your own honor by going away swiftly, leaving no disgraceful tracks. You may
  take a pack-train from the monastery stables and get out of Tibet by the way
  you came. You may do what you please with Naosuki."</p>

  <p>"Who says it?" asked one of the guard.</p>

  <p>"I say it, and who I am is none of your business. Naosuki has been
  counting on the support of Tibetan troops from Lhasa and Kalimpong. It isn't
  coming. There isn't a soldier, officer or man, in Tibet who would dare to
  invade this sacred valley to support foreigners, or for any other reason than
  to rid the place of foreigners. There's a force on the march, how ever, that
  doesn't consist of Tibetan soldiers. You will be cornered here like rats,
  unless you pull out quickly. If you're caught, you'll be sent to Japan by way
  of India, with a letter to say you are Naosuki's accomplices. The proof of
  Naosuki's treason to his Emperor is in Japan now."</p>

  <p>They all stared at Naosuki. Tom continued:</p>

  <p>"Naosuki sent you out to shoot the man who knows the truth about
  him&mdash;Dowlah. By saving Dowlah, I have saved you all from being parties
  to Naosuki's guilt. Now I will save you from something else."</p>

  <p>He stood up, pulled aside the screen and let it fall to the floor with a
  crash. There was a locked door, with a key in the lock. He went on
  talking:</p>

  <p>"Living or dead, do you wish to be known or remembered as savages? Have
  you been parties to the rape or torture of a defenseless woman? You see her
  bags. Naosuki was dishonorably pilfering from them. You see her clothing on
  the table. Where is she?"</p>

  <p>He turned the huge key in the ancient lock and flung the door wide open.
  It revealed a bare room&mdash;empty. The key fell to the floor. He picked it
  up and stuck it in the lock on the inside of the door, carelessly, as if he
  wasn't thinking what he was doing.</p>

  <p>"Where is she? What has Naosuki done to her?"</p>

  <p>Naosuki was speechless, making grimaces as inhuman as a tragic actor's on
  a Japanese print.</p>

  <p>"You were told you were heroes," said Tom. "You were told you were being
  sent to do an honorable duty for Japan, to make it easy for Japan to conquer
  Asia. You have been lied to and misled by a traitor who sold his Emperor's
  secrets. Where is that woman?"</p>

  <p>Without the slightest suggestion of hurry, he entered the inner room and
  shut the door behind him. The ancient lock, as he turned the key, made hardly
  any noise. It was a very thick door; through it he could barely hear the
  murmur of angry argument.</p>

  <p>There was another door, unlocked, with the key on the outside. On the
  stone floor near it was the broken lip-stick with which Elsa had scrawled on
  the panel:</p>

  <p class="sign">Chapel. Hurry. ELSA</p>

  <p>He hurried, with methodical decision, making better speed than if he had
  run wildly. There was a maze of doors and corridors, stone stairways leading
  to the upper floor and downward to the kitchens and into echoing cellars.
  There were passages within walls that were twelve feet thick. At almost every
  corner there was a dark hole where a monk might sit and meditate or lurk in
  ambush.</p>

  <p>But there was no one in sight, only sounds of men running&mdash;the boom
  of a great bell&mdash;a roar of voices from a long way off, like a
  sea-roar&mdash;and the weird, intermittent, irregular muffled thunder-sound
  that shook nothing but seemed to come from all directions. Then, suddenly,
  the unmistakable staccato rattle of rifle-fire&mdash;no guessing whence it
  came, along echoing passages.</p>

  <p>Out into a courtyard, and the sound of rifle firing louder. A long
  cloister to a courtyard behind the monastery. Steam&mdash;lots of it. On the
  far side of the courtyard a big chapel, door wide open and a riot roar coming
  through it. Tom entered quietly.</p>

  <p>No sign of Elsa or of Th&ouml;-pa-ga, but a monk with bull lungs, standing on a
  platform, was holding up Elsa's frock. It was the frock she bought in Delhi.
  He was tearing it into strips, like prayer streamers, and distributing them
  at random to whoever could get near enough. At the end of the chapel, on the
  altar platform, an old man in a yellow robe, who couldn't be any one else
  than the Abbot, surrounded by a dozen monks who were protecting him, held a
  carved box above his head. It probably contained sacred relics. The monks
  surrounding him were all shouting at once, and one of them was pounding an
  enormous gong as if his life depended on it.</p>

  <p>There were not less than a dozen dead or dying or severely wounded monks
  underfoot, amid pools of blood. In mid-chapel about thirty monks were
  fighting thirty or forty half-starved wretches in rags, who were led by the
  bow-and-arrow yak-man who had told Tom he wouldn't fight in any
  circumstances. He wasn't using bow and arrows. He and his two comrades, for
  some reason better fed than the scarecrows they led, were hard at it with
  cudgels. Religious frenzy had burst the restraint of doctrine. The meek had
  inherited righteous indignation. The skulls of the proud were cracking.</p>

  <p>It was easy to distinguish the proud. They were B&ouml;ns, with their backs to
  the wall&mdash;the long wall, with a dais in the middle and a gallery above
  that. They were the well-fed ones.</p>

  <p>Beneath the gallery, behind the dais, was a studded door, deeply carved
  and painted red. On either side of it were hideous tantric images of devils
  devouring men who yearned upward in agony toward the carved head and
  shoulders of Gautama Buddha, smiling from an arched recess, illuminated by
  colored glass lamps in the dimness above the door and below the gallery.</p>

  <p>Apparently no one had any firearms, but there were missiles flying in all
  directions, chiefly prayer wheels and brass lamps. Nearly all the paper
  windows were broken. The B&ouml;ns seemed to outnumber all the others, but to have
  used up all the missiles within their reach. They were chanting, to invoke
  their magic and to fortify their courage. The man who was tearing Elsa's
  dress into strips appeared not to be a B&ouml;n. It was hard to guess what he was.
  He seemed to be preaching a war of his own. It was he who first caught sight
  of Tom. He went into a frenzy, pointing at him, bellowing, slobbering.
  Impossible to tell what he was shouting about&mdash;demanding summary
  execution or offering welcome.</p>

  <p>Tom went for him. As he crossed the floor, scrumming his way through the
  brawl, a bow-and-arrow man let drive at him from the gloom under the gallery.
  The arrow buried itself in a monk's back. Some one slew the bowman with a
  bronze candlestick. Another bowman, from the doorway by which Tom had
  entered, took a shot at the Abbot. He hit him. The Abbot fell. There was a
  roar of rage. Some one struck down that bowman from behind. A man entered,
  cowled like a monk, but black-whiskered like no monk in all Tibet. He had a
  rusty sword, but when he tried to use it some one snatched it from him, and
  in a second there were ten monks fighting for it, all in a scrimmage, rolling
  over one another on the floor.</p>

  <p>The new arrival followed Tom. He reached him just as Tom reached the man
  who was tearing into little pieces the last shreds of Elsa's dress.</p>

  <p>"Where's your Mauser, you fool?"</p>

  <p>Dowlah! He and Tom became the center of a maelstrom of yelling monks.
  Dowlah shouted in Tom's ear:</p>

  <p>"Japs shot the stable-men&mdash;took all the best horses&mdash;they're on
  the run with all the loot they could pack!"</p>

  <p>"Who's coming?"</p>

  <p>"Damned if I know! Some one. They'd an outpost in a cave up on the
  mountain. I saw the flash of his helio. Look out! Who's that? Where's your
  Mauser?"</p>

  <p>Chou Wang-Naosuki! Dressed in his yellow lamaistic robe. Silent in the
  doorway. Stoop-shouldered. Head forward. Scowling. In his right hand an
  automatic.</p>

  <p>Tom couldn't draw the Mauser. The monks were pressing him too closely.
  Dowlah tried to snatch the weapon. Failing, he ducked. Chou Wang-Naosuki drew
  down his eyebrows, raised his right hand, took deliberate aim at Tom, fired,
  missed him and killed the bull-lunged fellow who had torn up Elsa's
  dress.</p>

  <p>Panic. Imprecations&mdash;yells of terror&mdash;anger. Every one except
  the B&ouml;ns who had their backs to the door scattered in search of cover. They
  struggled to hide behind one another. Naosuki calmly entered the chapel.
  Dowlah almost screamed at Tom:</p>

  <p>"Shoot him, you damned idiot!"</p>

  <p>"Any dog can kill," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>He did draw the Mauser. He whipped it out, thrusting Dowlah aside. The
  shove forced Dowlah backward, off-balance. A monk tripped him. He fell.
  Naosuki laughed suddenly&mdash;once. It was like a big dog's sullen bark. He
  tossed his weapon to the floor at Tom's feet. Dowlah pounced on it&mdash;
  leaped to his feet&mdash;aimed&mdash;drew the trigger. Empty! Naosuki had
  used his last shell. He sneered and walked toward the door under the gallery.
  The B&ouml;ns made way for him. One of them opened the big red door. He entered,
  not looking back ward.</p>

  <p>Tom went through the midst of the B&ouml;ns with such explosive ferocity that
  he reached the door before the brass bar fell in place. He charged through,
  Dowlah behind him, into darkness.</p>

  <p>"Elsa!"</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>"Elsa!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35">CHAPTER 35.</a><br>
  "Banzai!"</h2>

  <p class="first">Nothing but an echo in the darkness. Silence. Then muffled
  thunder. That sound, and the accompanying warmth, explained itself and the
  steam that could be seen from far off. Masses of boiling water down below
  somewhere&mdash;one of earth's cauldrons, obedient to some incalculable
  rhythm. Tom groped for his pocket flash-light. He and Dowlah were in a tunnel
  whose walls were coated with a black shiny film of glassy basalt. There were
  niches in the wall on both sides; there were pottery lamps on some of them,
  but no lamp burning. Tom shouted again:</p>

  <p>"Elsa!"</p>

  <p>Echo. Underground thunder. Silence. Then some one's footsteps. Naosuki's?
  Somewhere ahead, at an unguessable distance, there appeared a patch of dim
  light about the size of a man's hand. Tom strode forward, Dowlah lagging. It
  turned out to be reflected light, at a turn of the tunnel&mdash;dim daylight.
  It increased. The tunnel made several turns, grew narrower, then wider and
  opened suddenly into a daylit space so full of steam that it was all whirling
  whiteness and noise.</p>

  <p>"Grand place for a miracle!" said Dowlah. "Look out for shang-shangs. Can
  you use a Mauser?"</p>

  <p>Tom answered irritably: "Shut up!"</p>

  <p>Dowlah shoved his elbow. "There's Naosuki! Go on&mdash;shoot! You can't
  miss!"</p>

  <p>"Damn you, pipe down, or I'll kill you!"</p>

  <p>Dowlah giggled: "Write him a courteous letter! Why not? Your name should
  be Woodrow!"</p>

  <p>Naosuki, silhouetted against whirling white steam, stood framed in the
  mouth of the tunnel, staring down into the place where the steam came from.
  Tom hurried toward him. Naosuki glanced backward along the tunnel, turned
  left and vanished.</p>

  <p>Dowlah clutched Tom's arm. "Look out!" he said. "I warn you! He'll be
  waiting for us around the corner. Give me the pistol. You go forward, and
  when he jumps out at you, I'll shoot him!"</p>

  <p>Tom shook him off. He hurried to the spot where Naosuki had stood. It was
  the lip of a crater, slippery with some kind of glassy lava. Left and right a
  wet path vanished into steam. The sudden, muted thunder of water boiling
  underground was almost deafening. There was a surge of invisible water that
  fell back on itself. Steam belched upward. And then silence.</p>

  <p>"Elsa!" Tom shouted. "Elsa!"</p>

  <p>No answer. He took the left-hand path and followed Naosuki, blinded by the
  white steam, keeping his hand on the sheer face of the encircling rock wall.
  The smooth, wet path sloped outward toward the crater. Dowlah slipped and
  grabbed him, almost dragging him over the edge, but the wall was covered with
  carvings of monsters; Tom's fingers caught a devil by the open mouth and hung
  on. After that he made Dowlah keep five or six paces behind.</p>

  <p>It was all noise&mdash;muffled, deadened, ominous. There was a vague smell
  of sulphurous gas. Scraps of sky appeared, brilliant blue, and here and
  there, through gaps in the whirling steam, there were glimpses of wet cliffs
  hundreds of feet high.</p>

  <p>The path widened. It became fifty feet wide. There were stone altars, of
  onyx, very ancient, in a curved row near the edge of the crater. Grooves on
  the tops of the altars led to holes through which blood could run off.</p>

  <p>"Human sacrifice!" said Dowlah. "Tee-hee! Kill 'em beautifully! Chuck 'em
  in and boil 'em, for a meal for devils in the next world! Holy! Holy! Holy!
  That's the door to the B6n-po hell, that crater! They've boiled your Elsa, I
  bet you!" He giggled, stepping backward out of range of Tom's fist. But he
  needn't have troubled. He had lost, if he ever had it, any power over Tom's
  impulses.</p>

  <p>The carved cliff closed in again toward the crater's edge, but it sloped
  backward, letting in more light than on the far side.</p>

  <p>"There he is!" said Dowlah. "Shoot him! Damn you, shoot him! I say, shoot
  him!"</p>

  <p>A hundred feet up, a half-arch of glistening wet rock, shaped like a
  pheasant's spur, curved outward from the cliff and was almost lost to sight
  in steam above the crater. Hewn steps in the rock face zigzagged upward
  toward it. On the farthest tip, looking like a ghost in the steam, stood
  Naosuki, motionless. In his lama's robe he looked like a high priest. Tom
  called to him:</p>

  <p>"Naosuki! Do you know where Elsa Burbage is? Your life for hers!"</p>

  <p>No answer. Naosuki took no notice whatever. Suddenly he cried aloud in
  Japanese and leaped, feet foremost and together, with his robe wrapped tight
  around him and his right hand raised. He vanished into steam. The muted
  thunder rose and greeted him. The invisible boiling surge up-hove and laved a
  smooth wall, falling back upon itself.</p>

  <p>"<i>Banzai</i>!" said Tom, and that time he pronounced it properly. He
  turned on Dowlah. "That's more than you've the guts to do!"</p>

  <p>Dowlah sat down on an onyx altar, with his head between his hands.</p>

  <p>"All I need is a drink," he remarked. Then, suddenly recovering his
  self-control, savagely: "You blockhead! Do you realize there's nothing now
  between you and me and what we're after?"</p>

  <p>There came a cry through the craterous thunder. It sounded far off. Tom
  shouted:</p>

  <p>"Elsa! Elsa!"</p>

  <p>He began running. He followed the path until it curved under the
  projecting half-arch. Beyond that it turned left again along a wider ledge.
  Around that corner there was a door, once painted red, but nearly all the
  paint had scaled off. It was heavily reinforced with iron. Four feet from the
  bottom was an iron grille, about ten inches square. It had a huge iron
  padlock, not very ancient, not very rusty, slick with recent greasing.</p>

  <p>"Elsa !" he shouted.</p>

  <p>"Tom? Oh, thank God!"</p>

  <p>"Coming!"</p>

  <p>He resumed his unhurried mood. He examined the lock, rubbing his thumb
  along the surface. It bore the legend: <i>Honorable East India Company.
  1845</i>.</p>

  <p>"Tom, we're in here with a shang-shang! Th&ouml;pe has fainted. It's dark."</p>

  <p>"Half a minute!"</p>

  <p>He put a shot into the padlock. Then another. He found a rock then and
  hammered. The padlock broke. The door swung open and Elsa nearly fell into
  his arms. She was wearing Tibetan clothes, too big for her, with turquoise
  jewels.</p>

  <p>"Get Th&ouml;pe, Tom."</p>

  <p>"Okay. Watch Dowlah."</p>

  <p>He groped in darkness, found a leg and dragged out the Tibetan, left him
  lying, stepped inside again and shut the door. Then he spoke through the
  grille:</p>

  <p>"Elsa&mdash;come on&mdash;tell me."</p>

  <p>She answered quietly, with her face as close as his to the grille: "Tom,
  please come out of there."</p>

  <p>"Good girl now. Hang on to yourself. Tell me."</p>

  <p>"Tom, there's a passage for thirty feet. Beyond that there's a cavern with
  a great pit at the far end. If you look for a long time by the light of the
  grille, you can see the shang-shang's eyes on the rear wall."</p>

  <p>"Okay. I can see them. It's the last of the brutes. No hurry. If it comes
  toward me I couldn't miss it. How did you get in here?"</p>

  <p>"There was a fight in the chapel. About Th&ouml;pe&mdash;and me. The B&ouml;ns said,
  if Th&ouml;pe is genuine he can manage the shang-shang. They tore my clothes off
  and gave me these, and brought us here and left us."</p>

  <p>"Where's your revolver?"</p>

  <p>"Noropa stole it."</p>

  <p>"Okay. Noropa's dead. Dowlah's unarmed, but watch him."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Damned if I know. Stay where you are, and yell like hell if he starts
  anything."</p>

  <p>Tom switched on his little pencil of light and went slowly forward into
  stenching darkness. To right and left were about a dozen cells hewn in the
  rock, with doors made of poles set two inches apart. Most of the doors stood
  ajar. Away ahead in the darkness the shang-shang's eyes glowed pale opal, as
  big as soup plates, almost exactly one above the other. All the rest of the
  brute was invisible. The eyes didn't move, didn't blink. They looked unreal,
  almost like holes in the rock through which a wan light entered.</p>

  <p>At the end of thirty or forty feet the passage widened into a broad cavern
  and the pin-light picked up the edge of a gap in the floor at the farther
  end. It extended the full width of the floor and as far as the rear wall.
  Mutterings came out of it, but no steam. Near the edge of the gap was a naked
  human corpse, dried up, like a mummy.</p>

  <p>With the Mauser in his right hand and the light in his left, Tom leaned
  against the corner where the passage opened into the cavern. He tried to
  trace the outlines of the monster, but it was so huge that the pin-light
  couldn't follow its spidery legs into the darkness. Its body was as big as a
  barrel, vivid green, and foul with what looked like crimson fungus. Its
  mandibles moved. It was beginning to blubber with foam at the snout. The
  light annoyed it. It moved.</p>

  <p>Tom fired&mdash;two shots, one at each eye. The second shot was probably a
  miss. The shang-shang curled up like a swatted spider and vanished, writhing,
  down into the chasm.</p>

  <p>Tom went and looked, but the pin-light couldn't fathom the utter darkness.
  He could hear water, but couldn't see it. He pushed the human corpse into the
  chasm and turned away, striding resolutely, not too fast, lest horror should
  make him lose his self-control.</p>

  <p>Dowlah was nowhere in sight when he opened the door. Th&ouml;-pa-ga was
  standing beside Elsa, looking mournful, but twice the man he was when Tom
  last saw him. In spite of having fainted, there were signs of iron in him,
  and of self-control. He had more actual control than Tom had at the moment.
  He was dressed in gorgeous yellow silk, with an embroidered crimson toga. He
  held out his hand. In his peculiar, stately English he said:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Grayne, I thanking you so much for all this."</p>

  <p>"Th&ouml;pe has been a perfect brick," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>They were all embarrassed. Tom was watching Elsa sideways. She said
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"I, who ran away from destiny, am disciplined," said Th&ouml;-pa-ga.</p>

  <p>Tom didn't know what to say.</p>

  <p>"Where's Dowlah?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he turned to Elsa and took hold of her and kissed her. He kissed
  her a long time. She was quite still in his arms, but he could feel her heart
  thumping as fast as his own.</p>

  <p>"Tom," she said at last, "you don't owe me anything. It's dear of you, and
  generous, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted: "I lied to you like hell. I half knew I was lying. You're
  a damned good gallant little woman and I loved you from the day we first met.
  But neither do you owe me anything. Go and get your divorce."</p>

  <p>She chuckled, with her arms on his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Tom, I lied much worse than you did! I believe you meant it, or at least
  you believed you meant it. I didn't! Not once, for a single minute. I've been
  all yours, any time you'd have me, from then until now! But have I played
  fair?"</p>

  <p>He almost crushed her.</p>

  <p>"Th&ouml;pe, old fellow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Th&ouml;-pa-ga smiled wanly. "Oh," he said, "I take the Middle Way, I think,
  from now on. I am no good in the world."</p>

  <p>"Rot!" Tom answered. "Buck up! But for you, this place would be a
  shang-shang-ridden nest of lousy propaganda! Thanks to you there are no more
  shang-shangs. Take the credit for it! Take hold! Clean up! Run the show and
  root hard for the Tashi Lama. He's a good man. Work to get him back to
  Tashi-lunpo. Do a man's job. Help to keep all foreign devils out of
  Tibet!"</p>

  <p>Elsa interrupted: "Tom, is it as over as all that? Is it true about
  Lobsang Pun? Is he here yet?"</p>

  <p>"Let's go see. Where's Dowlah?"</p>

  <p>No sign of Dowlah. They returned around the crater amid steam and muted
  thunder and then groped their way along the tunnel to the great red door. It
  was locked. There was a roar of voices in the chapel, frantic gong-beats, and
  a new noise&mdash;the triumphant blare of conches and long radongs.</p>

  <p>Th&ouml;-pa-ga protested: "Wait here! That man Dowlah&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ride yourself!" Tom interrupted. "Now's your big chance. If they opened
  for Dowlah, they'll open for us. If Dowlah hasn't found some liquor he has
  shot his last bolt. Stand back."</p>

  <p>He fired three shots at the door and reloaded his Mauser. A monk opened
  the door. Th&ouml;-pa-ga stepped through, then he, then Elsa. The sunlight through
  the smashed windows was dazzling. The place was a wreck. Monks' dead bodies
  lay in pools of blood, in a litter of fallen banners, pictures and broken
  lamps. No sign of Dowlah. The monks were marching around and around the
  chapel to a blare of trumpets and thunder of drums. They swarmed around
  Th&ouml;-pa-ga.</p>

  <p>"Your chance!" Tom shouted at him.</p>

  <p>The monks bore Th&ouml;-pa-ga away toward the altar. He stood there smiling.
  There fell a hush, breathless. No other sound than the groan of a wounded
  monk and the flutter of torn window paper. Then Th&ouml;-pa-ga's voice, ringing
  clear:</p>

  <p>"<i>Om mane padme hum!</i> Blessed be the Word that goes forth! There are
  no more shang-shangs! The Thunder Dragon Gate no longer speaks for Evil.
  Clean up! Clean up!"</p>

  <p>Tom hurried Elsa out of the chapel. In the yard, between the chapel and
  the monastery wall, stood twenty bearded skeletons in sheepskins, beside
  scarecrow ponies. Dowlah's men! On the monastery steps stood Dowlah, staring
  at them, and they stared at him. They didn't see Tom and Elsa; even Dowlah
  didn't. They weren't speaking. They were simply staring at Dowlah in
  resentful silence, and he at them. Dowlah turned his back and walked into the
  monastery. Tom went up and spoke in Hindustanee to the subadar.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, that Holiness Lobsang Pun is a bahadur of the old school! Aye, a
  burra wallah general bahadur! There is the spirit in him. On our way we met
  him, near that monastery. Lo, he swept us up and rolled us westward! We have
  marched like men in a dream. He had a hundred monks behind him, and more than
  two hundred ponies and yaks. That monastery belched provisions for
  him&mdash;aye, and more monks. And he knew where those devils of B&ouml;ns had
  cached their ghee and barley meal. Nay, nay, we haven't starved, nor have our
  ponies. He marched us thin! He is a magic-maker! That Lobsang Pun Bahadur
  could conquer the world! If he sleeps, then he sleeps on horseback, and it
  needs relays of horses in half-hour spells to stagger at such speed beneath
  His Honor's weight!"</p>

  <p>"And the woman&mdash;Su-li Wing?"</p>

  <p>"She came, too. She has no more heart for India than we have, with our
  shame upon us. But we saw no shame in being led by Lobsang Pun Bahadur. Bold
  he is, and arrogant, and godly. He could make a dead man march to the world's
  end! Lo, behold us, sahib, we are all here, not a man is missing."</p>

  <p>"And now what?"</p>

  <p>"God knows, sahib."</p>

  <p>Tom and Elsa went into the monastery. They had to step over the legs of
  monks who sprawled, dead weary, in the corridors. They had loads, but no
  weapons. More than half of them were asleep on any kind of mat or blanket
  they had been able to find. Some of them lay like dead men, snoring on the
  flagstones.</p>

  <p>At the end of a passage there was a crowd of monks out side an open door,
  through which came Lobsang Pun's voice, reprimanding, roaring orders.
  Unmistakably his voice, ringing with energy. In the midst of the monks lay
  Dowlah, stone dead, in a pool of blood. There was a knife in his back.</p>

  <p>Not a monk had laid a hand on Su-li Wing. She was standing near the door,
  still wearing her coonskin overcoat. She seemed to have shriveled inside it.
  She looked uttterly worn out, and years older. But when she saw Tom and Elsa
  she laughed&mdash;metallic&mdash;nasal&mdash;high pitched&mdash;cruel.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't give me a break," she said, "but there's your Dowlah! He saw
  me. He knew I did it."</p>

  <p>She stood aside to let Tom and Elsa enter the room. The Abbot's dead body
  lay in state on a table with lighted candles, surrounded by kneeling monks.
  Lobsang Pun was in a great chair by a table loaded with the monastery
  records. Monks were on the run with more records. He had some B&ouml;ns up in
  front of him, with their hands tied. He was pronouncing sentences, pursing
  his lips to taste the flavor of godliness and then opening them wide to
  roar:</p>

  <p>"Mercy to man and beast. It isn't merciful to let men die in sin. That
  foul stuff leaves, the way it entered, through the body. Two hours'
  flogging!"</p>

  <p>The minute he saw Tom and Elsa he roared with laughter. They went up and
  bowed.</p>

  <p>"Shang-shang?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Your Eminence, the last one is dead," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>"Chou Wang-Naosuki?"</p>

  <p>"Dead, too. Th&ouml;-pa-ga is safe in the chapel."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I knowing it."</p>

  <p>"I have the honor to present my wife, Your Eminence."</p>

  <p>"Oo-ha-ha-ha-hah! Tum-Glain, what your doing in Tibet? Get out! Go
  home!"</p>

  <p>Tom laughed. He liked Lobsang Pun. He struck his right hand on his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"Your Reverend and Holy Eminence," he said, "has surely not forgotten that
  permit to travel wherever I please in Tibet."</p>

  <p>"What your wanting?"</p>

  <p>"Ponies. Provisions. An outfit. Men&mdash;I might take Dowlah's, if Your
  Eminence can't spare a few. I will follow the trail of the Japs. I want a
  messenger to-morrow morning, to carry my mail to Mu-ni Gam-po in
  Darjeeling."</p>

  <p>Lobsang Pun stared at Elsa. His big beak of a nose twitched and his eyes
  almost disappeared into a maze of wrinkles. He smiled at her. He
  chuckled.</p>

  <p>"You? "he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Tom says I have won my spurs, Your Eminence. I am his wife. I will go
  where he goes."</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain! Oo-ha-ha-ha-hah! What about that Chinese woman?"</p>

  <p>"Send her packing," Tom answered. "Send her to India."</p>

  <p>Lobsang Pun objected. "Better mercifully two hours' flogging. Beat the sin
  out. Save her a million years in hell."</p>

  <p>Tom grinned: "Your Eminence's magnanimity is famous. But I beg you, as a
  personal favor to me, not to waste it on that woman. Please let her go."</p>

  <p>Lobsang Pun looked scandalized. His eyes glared autocratic
  indignation.</p>

  <p>"What your wanting, Tum-Glain? Two women? One not enough for you? Your
  being too sinful. My letting Su-li Wing go, unadmonished by two hours'
  whipping, if Th&ouml;-pa-ga requesting. Otherwise, my blessing her with suitable
  rebuke."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Tom answered, "I will plead with Th&ouml;-pa-ga. By the way, Your
  Eminence, the money in Rajah Dowlah's pocket belongs to Abdul Mirza, who's a
  good old honest fellow with a lean purse. May he have it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my sending to him."</p>

  <p>"And I think you'll find a letter, bearing your signature&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Forged!"</p>

  <p>"That he took from the B&ouml;n magician&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oo-ha-ha! I have it! See? I have it.&mdash;Now you, Tum-Glain, now your
  knowing Thunder Dragon Gate, your going to the moon next? Tum-Glain! Elsa!
  Oo-hah-ha-ha-ha-hah!"</p>
