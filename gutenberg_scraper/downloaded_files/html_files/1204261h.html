  <h2><a name="chap1"
     id="chap1">CHAPTER 1</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A blood-red sun rested its huge disk upon a low mud wall
  that crested a rise to westward, and flattened at the bottom from its own
  weight apparently. A dozen dried-out false-acacia-trees shivered as the
  faintest puff in all the world of stifling wind moved through them; and a
  hundred thousand tiny squirrels kept up their aimless scampering in search of
  food that was not there.</p>

  <p>A coppersmith was about the only living thing that seemed to care whether
  the sun went down or not. He seemed in a hurry to get a job done, and his
  reiterated "Bong-bong-bong!"&mdash;that had never ceased since sunrise, and
  had driven nearly mad the few humans who were there to hear it&mdash;
  quickened and grew louder. At last Brown came out of a square mud house, to
  see about the sunset.</p>

  <p>He was nobody but plain Bill Brown&mdash;or Sergeant William Brown, to
  give him his full name and entitlements&mdash;and the price of him was two
  rupees per day.</p>

  <p>He stared straight at the dull red disk of the sun, and spat with
  eloquence. Then he wiped the sweat from his forehead, and scratched a place
  where the prickly heat was bothering him. Next, he buttoned up his tunic, and
  brushed it down neatly and precisely. There was official business to be done,
  and a man did that with due formality, heat or no heat.</p>

  <p>"Guard, turn out!" he ordered.</p>

  <p>Twelve men filed out, one behind the other, from the hut that he had left.
  They seemed to feel the heat more than Brown did, as they fell in line before
  Brown's sword. There was no flag, and no flag-pole in that nameless
  health-resort, so the sword, without its scabbard, was doing duty, point
  downward in the ground, as a totem-pole of Empire. Brown had stuck it there,
  like Boanerges' boots, and there it stayed from sunrise until sunset, to be
  displaced by whoever dared to do it, at his peril.</p>

  <p>They had no clock. They had nothing, except the uniforms and arms of the
  Honorable East India Company, as issued in this year of Our Lord, 1857
  &mdash;a cooking-pot or two, a kettle, a little money and a butcher-knife.
  Their supper bleated miserably some twenty yards away, tied to a tree, and a
  lean. Punjabi squatted near it in readiness to buy the skin. It was a big
  goat, but it was mangy, so he held only two annas in his hand. The other anna
  (in case that Brown should prove adamant) was twisted in the folds of his
  pugree, but he was prepared to perjure himself a dozen times, and take the
  names of all his female ancestors in vain, before he produced it.</p>

  <p>The sun flattened a little more at the bottom, and began to move quickly,
  as it does in India&mdash;anxious apparently to get away from the day's ill
  deeds.</p>

  <p>"Shoulder umms!" commanded Brown. "General salute! Present-umms!"</p>

  <p>The red sun slid below the sky-line, and the night was on them, as though
  somebody had shut the lid. Brown stepped to the sword, jerked it out of the
  ground and returned it to his scabbard in three motions.</p>

  <p>"Shoulder-umms! Order-umms! Dismiss!" The men filed back into the hut
  again, disconsolately, without swearing and without mirth. They had put the
  sun to bed with proper military decency. They would have seen humor&mdash;
  perhaps&mdash;or an excuse for blasphemy in the omission of such a detail,
  but it was much too hot to swear at the execution of it.</p>

  <p>Besides, Brown was a strange individual who detested swearing, and it was
  a very useful thing, and wise, to humor him. He had a way of his own, and
  usually got it.</p>

  <p>Brown posted a sentry at the hut-door, and another at the crossroads which
  he was to guard, then went round behind the but to bargain with the
  goatskin-merchant. But he stopped before he reached the tree.</p>

  <p>"Boy!" he called, and a low-caste native servant came toward him at a
  run.</p>

  <p>"Is that fakir there still?"</p>

  <p>"Ha, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Ha? Can't you learn to say 'yes,' like a human being?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"All right. I'm going to have a talk with him. Kill the goat, and tell the
  Punjabi to wait, if he wants to buy the skin."</p>

  <p>"Ha, sahib!"</p>

  <p>Brown spun round on his heel, and the servant wilted.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib!" he corrected.</p>

  <p>Brown left him then, with a nod that conveyed remission of cardinal sin,
  and a warning not to repeat the offence. As the native ran off to get the
  butcher-knife and sharpen it, it was noticeable that he wore a chastened
  look.</p>

  <p>"Send Sidiki after me!" Brown shouted after him, and a minute later a
  nearly naked Beluchi struck a match and emerged from the darkness, with the
  light of a lantern gleaming on his skin. He followed like a snake, and only
  Brown's sharp, authority-conveying footfalls could be heard as he trudged
  sturdily&mdash;straight-backed, eyes straight in front of him&mdash;to where
  an age-old baobab loomed like a phantom in the night. He marched like a man
  in armor. Not even the terrific heat of a Central-Indian night could take the
  stiffening out of him.</p>

  <p>The Beluchi ran ahead, just before they reached the tree. He stopped and
  held the lantern up to let its light fall on some object that was close
  against the tree-trunk. At a good ten-pace distance from the object Brown
  stopped and stared. The lamplight fell on two little dots that gleamed. Brown
  stepped two paces nearer. Two deadly, malicious human eyes blinked once, and
  then stared back at him.</p>

  <p>"Does he never sleep?" asked Brown.</p>

  <p>The Beluchi said something or other in a language that was full of harsh
  hard gutturals, and the owner of the eyes chuckled. His voice seemed to be
  coming from the tree itself, and there was nothing of him visible except the
  cruel keen eyes that had not blinked once since Brown drew nearer.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, he does not answer."</p>

  <p>"Tell him I'm tired of his not answering. Tell him that if he can't learn
  to give a civil answer to a civilly put question I'll exercise my authority
  on him!"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi translated, or pretended to. Brown was not sure which, for he
  was rewarded with nothing but another chuckle, which sounded like water
  gurgling down a drain.</p>

  <p>"Does he still say nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely nothing, sahib."</p>

  <p>Brown stepped up closer yet, and peered into the blackness, looking
  straight into the eyes that glared at him, and from them down at the body of
  the owner of them. The Beluchi shrank away.</p>

  <p>"Have a care, sahib! It is dangerous! This very holy&mdash;most holy
  &mdash;most religious man!"</p>

  <p>"Bring that lantern back."</p>

  <p>"He will curse you, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Do you hear me?"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi came nearer again, trembling with fright. Brown snatched the
  lamp away from him, and pushed it forward toward the fakir, moving it up and
  down to get a view of the whole of him. There was nothing that he saw that
  would reassure or comfort or please a devil even. It was ultradevilish; both
  by design and accident&mdash;conceived and calculated ghastliness, peculiar
  to India. Brown shuddered as he looked, and it took more than the merely
  horrible to make him betray emotion.</p>

  <p>"What god do you say he worships?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, I know not. I am a Mussulman. These Hindus worship many gods."</p>

  <p>The fakir chuckled again, and Brown held the lantern yet nearer to him to
  get a better view. The fakir's skin was not oily, and for all the
  blanket-heat it did not glisten, so his form was barely outlined against the
  blackness that was all but tangible behind him.</p>

  <p>Brown spat again, as he drew away a step. He could contrive to express
  more disgust and more grim determination in that one rudimentary act than
  even a Stamboul Softa can.</p>

  <p>"So he's holy, is he?"</p>

  <p>"Very, very holy, sahib!"</p>

  <p>Again the fakir chuckled, and again Brown held his breath and pushed the
  lantern closer to him.</p>

  <p>"I believe the brute understands the Queen's English!"</p>

  <p>"He understanding all things, sahib! He knowing all things what will
  happen! Mind, sahib! He may curse you!"</p>

  <p>But Brown appeared indifferent to the danger that he ran. To the fakir's
  unconcealed discomfort, he proceeded to examine him minutely, going over him
  with the aid of the lantern inch by inch, from the toe-nails upward.</p>

  <p>"Well," he commented aloud, "if the army's got an opposite, here's it! I'd
  give a month's pay for the privilege of washing this brute, just as a
  beginning!"</p>

  <p>The man's toe-nails&mdash;for he really was a man!&mdash;were at least two
  inches long. They were twisted spirally, and some of them were curled back on
  themselves into disgusting-looking knots. What walking he had ever done had
  been on his heels. His feet were bent upward, and fixed upward, by a
  deliberately cultivated cramp.</p>

  <p>His legs, twisted one above the other in a squatting attitude, were lean
  and hairy, and covered with open sores which were kept open by the swarm of
  insects that infested him. His loin-cloth was rotting from him. His emaciated
  body&mdash;powdered and smeared with ashes and dust and worse&mdash;was
  perched bolt-up-right on a flat earth dais that had once on a time been the
  throne of a crossroads idol. One arm, his right one, hung by his side in an
  almost normal attitude, and his right fingers moved incessantly like a man's
  who is kneading clay. But his other arm was rigid&mdash;straight up in the
  air above his head; set, fixed, cramped, paralyzed in that position, with the
  fist clenched. And through the back of the closed fist the fakir's nails were
  growing.</p>

  <p>But, worse than the horror of the arm was the creature's face, with the
  evidence of torture on it, and fiendish delight in torture for the torture's
  sake. His eyes were his only organs that really lived still, and they
  expressed the steely hate and cruelty, the mad fanaticism, the greedy
  self-love&mdash;self-immolating for the sake of self&mdash;that is the
  thoroughgoing fakir's stock in trade. And his lips were like the graven lips
  of a Hindu temple god, self-satisfied, self-worshiping, contemptuous and
  cruel. He chuckled again, as Brown finished his inspection.</p>

  <p>"So that crittur's holy, is he? Well, tell him that I'm set here to watch
  these crossroads. Tell him I'm supposed to question every one who comes, and
  find out what his business is, and arrest him if he can't give a proper
  account of himself. Say he's been here three days now, and that that's long
  enough for any one to find his tongue in. Tell him if I don't get an answer
  from him here and now I'll put him in the clink!"</p>

  <p>"But, sahib&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You tell him what I say, d'you hear?"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi made haste to translate, trembling as he spoke, and wilting
  visibly when the baleful eyes of the fakir rested on him for a second. The
  fakir answered something in a guttural undertone.</p>

  <p>"What does he say?"</p>

  <p>"That he will curse you, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Sentry!" shouted Brown.</p>

  <p>"Sir!" came the ready answer, and the sling-swivels of a rifle clicked as
  the man on guard at the crossroads shouldered it. There are some men who are
  called "sir" without any title to it, just as there are some sergeants who
  receive a colonel's share of deference when out on a non-commissioned
  officer's command. Bill Brown was one of them.</p>

  <p>"Come here, will you!"</p>

  <p>There came the sound of heavy footfalls, and a thud as a rifle-butt
  descended to the earth again. Brown moved the lamp, and its beams fell on a
  rifleman who stood close beside him at attention&mdash;like a jinnee formed
  suddenly from empty blackness.</p>

  <p>"Arrest this fakir. Cram him in the clink."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir!"</p>

  <p>The sentry took one step forward, with his fixed bayonet at the "charge,"
  and the fakir sat still and eyed him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, have a care, sahib!" wailed the Beluchi. "This is very holy man!"</p>

  <p>"Silence!" ordered Brown. "Here. Hold the lamp."</p>

  <p>The bayonet-point pressed against the fakir's ribs, and he drew back an
  inch or two to get away from it. He was evidently able to feel pain when it
  was inflicted by any other than himself.</p>

  <p>"Come on," growled the sentry. "Forward. Quick march. If you don't want
  two inches in you!"</p>

  <p>"Don't use the point!" commanded Brown. "You might do him an injury. Treat
  him to a sample of the butt!"</p>

  <p>The sentry swung his rifle round with an under-handed motion that all
  riflemen used to practise in the short-range-rifle days. The fakir winced,
  and gabbled something in a hurry to the man who held the lamp.</p>

  <p>"He says that he will speak, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Halt, then," commanded Brown. "Order arms. Tell him to hurry up!"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi translated, and the fakir answered him, in a voice that
  sounded hard and distant and emotionless.</p>

  <p>"He says that he, too, is here to watch the crossroads, sahib! He says
  that he will curse you if you touch him!"</p>

  <p>"Tell him to curse away!"</p>

  <p>"He says not unless you touch him, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Prog him off his perch!" commanded Brown.</p>

  <p>The rifle leaped up at the word, and its butt landed neatly on the fakir's
  ribs, sending him reeling backward off his balance, but not upsetting him
  completely. He recovered his poise with quite astonishing activity, and
  shuffled himself back again to the center of the dais. His eyes blazed with
  hate and indignation, and his breath came now in sharp gasps that sounded
  like escaping steam. He needed no further invitation to commence his cursing.
  It burst out with a rush, and paused for better effect, and burst out again
  in a torrent. The Beluchi hid his face between his hands.</p>

  <p>"Now translate that!" commanded Brown, when the fakir stopped for lack of
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, I dare not! Sahib&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Brown took a threatening step toward him, and the Beluchi changed his
  mind. Brown's disciplining methods were a too recently encountered fact to be
  outdone by a fakir's promise of any kind of not-yet-met damnation.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, he says that because your man has touched him, both you and your
  man shall lie within a week helpless upon an anthill, still living, while the
  ants run in and out among your wounds. He says that the ants shall eat your
  eyes, sahib, and that you shall cry for water, and there shall be no water
  within reach&mdash;only the sound of water just beyond you. He says that
  first you shall be beaten, both of you, until your backs and the soles of
  your feet run blood, in order that the ants may have an entrance!"</p>

  <p>"Is he going to do all this?"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi passed the question on, and the fakir tossed him an answer to
  it.</p>

  <p>"He says, sahib, that the gods will see to it."</p>

  <p>"So the gods obey his orders, do they. Well, they've a queer sense of
  duty! What else does he prophesy?"</p>

  <p>"About your soul, sahib, and the sentry's soul."</p>

  <p>"That's interesting! Translate!"</p>

  <p>"He says, sahib, that for countless centuries you and your man shall
  inhabit the carcasses of snakes, to eat dirt and be trodden on and crushed,
  until you learn to have respect for very holy persons!"</p>

  <p>"Is he going to have the ordering of that?"</p>

  <p>"He says that the gods have already ordered it."</p>

  <p>"It won't make much difference, then, what I do now. If that's in store
  for me in any case, I may as well get my money's worth before the fun begins!
  Tell him that unless he can give me a satisfactory reason for being here I
  shall treat him to a little more rifle-butt, and something else afterward
  that he will like even less!"</p>

  <p>"He says," explained the Beluchi, after a moment's conversation with the
  fakir, "that he is here to see what the gods have prophesied. He says that
  India will presently be whelmed in blood!"</p>

  <p>"Whose blood?"</p>

  <p>"Yours and that of others. He says, did you not see the sunset?"</p>

  <p>"What of the sunset?"</p>

  <p>Brown looked about him and, save where the lantern cast a fitful light on
  the fakir and the sentry and the native servant, and threw into faint relief
  the shadowy, snake-like tendrils of the baobab, his eyes failed to pierce the
  gloom. The sunset was a memory. In that heavy, death-darkness silence it
  seemed almost as though there had never been a sun.</p>

  <p>"'A blot of blood,' he says. He says the order has been given. He says
  that half of India shall run blood within a day, and the whole of it within a
  week!"</p>

  <p>"Who gave the order?"</p>

  <p>"He answers 'Hookum hai!'&mdash;which means 'It is an order!' Nothing more
  does the holy fakir say."</p>

  <p>"To the clink with him!" commanded Brown. "I'm tired of these Old Mother
  Shipton babblings. That's the third useless Hindu fanatic within a week who
  has talked about India being drenched in blood. Let him go in to the depot
  under guard, and do his prophesying there! Bring him along."</p>

  <p>The sentry's rifle-butt rose again and threatened business. The Beluchi
  gave a warning cry, and the fakir tumbled off his dais. Then, with the
  trembling Beluchi walking on ahead with the lantern, and Brown and the sentry
  urging from behind, the fakir jumped and squirmed and wabbled on his all but
  useless feet toward the guardroom. When they reached the tree where the goat
  had bleated, the Punjabi skin-buyer rose up, took one long look at the fakir
  and ran.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be!" exclaimed the sentry.</p>

  <p>"You'll be worse than that," said Brown, "if you use that language
  anywhere where I'm about! I'll not have it, d'you hear? Get on ahead, and
  open the door of the clink!"</p>

  <p>The sentry obeyed him, and a moment later the fakir was thrust into a
  four-square mud-walled room, and the door was locked on him.</p>

  <p>"Back to your post," commanded Brown. "And next time I hear you swearing,
  I'll treat you to a double-trick, my man! About turn. Quick march."</p>

  <p>The sentry trudged off without daring to answer him, and Brown took a good
  look at the fakir through the iron bars that protected the top half of the
  door. Then he went off to see about his supper, of newly slaughtered
  goat-chops and chupatties baked in ghee. His soul revolted at the thought of
  it, but it was his duty to eat it and set an example to the men; and duty was
  the only thing that mattered in Bill Brown's scheme of things.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's true," he muttered, "and maybe it's all lies; there's no
  knowing. Maybe India's going to run blood, as these fakirs seem to think, and
  maybe it isn't. There'll be more blood shed than mine in that case! 'Hookum
  hai'&mdash;'It is orders,' heh ? Well&mdash;there's more than one sort of
  'Hookum hai!' I've got my orders too!"</p>

  <p>He doubled the guard, when supper bad been eaten and the guardroom had
  been swept and the pots and kettle had been burnished until they shone. Then
  he tossed a chupatty to the imprisoned fakir, spat again from sheer disgust,
  lit his pipe and went and sat where he could hear the footbeats of the
  sentries.</p>

  <p>"They can't help their religion," he muttered. "The poor infidels don't
  know no better. And they've got a right to think what they please 'about me
  or the Company. But I've no patience with uncleanliness! That's wrong any way
  you look at it. That critter can't see straight for the dirt on him, nor
  think straight for that matter. He's a disgrace to humanity. Priest or fakir
  or whatever he is, if I live to see tomorrow's sun I'll hand him over to the
  guard and have him washed!"</p>

  <p>Having formed that resolution, Brown dismissed all thoughts of the fakir.
  His memory went back to home&mdash;the clean white cottage on the Sussex
  Downs, and the clean white girl who once on a time had waited for him there.
  For the next few hours, until the guard was changed, the only signs or sounds
  of life were the glowing of Brown's pipe, the steady footfalls of the
  sentries and occasional creakings from the hell-hot guard-room, where
  sleepless soldiers tossed in prickly discomfort.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap2"
     id="chap2">CHAPTER 2</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Bill Brown, with his twelve, had not been set to watch a
  lonely crossroad for the fun of it. One road was a well-made highway, and led
  from a walled city, where three thousand men sweated and thought of England,
  to another city, where five thousand armed natives drew England's pay, and
  wore English uniforms.</p>

  <p>The other road was a snake-like trail, nearly as wide but not nearly so
  well kept. It twisted here and there amid countless swarming native villages,
  and was used almost exclusively by natives, whose rightful business was
  neither war nor peace nor the contriving of either of them. It had been a
  trade-road when history was being born, and the laden ox-carts creaked along
  it still, as they had always done and always will do until India awakes.</p>

  <p>But there are few men in the world who attend to nothing but their
  rightful business, and there are even more in India than elsewhere who are
  prone to neglect their own affairs and stir up sedition among others. There
  are few fighting-men among that host. They are priests for the most part or
  fakirs or make-believe pedlers or confessed and shameless mendicants; and
  they have no liking for the trunk roads, where the tangible evidence of Might
  and Majesty may be seen marching in eight-hundred-man battalions. They prefer
  to dream along the byways, and set other people dreaming. They lead, when the
  crash comes, from behind.</p>

  <p>Though the men who made the policies of the Honorable East India Company
  were mostly blind to the moving finger on the wall, and chose to imagine
  themselves secure against a rising of the millions they controlled; and
  though most of their military officers were blinder yet, and failed to read
  the temper of the native troops in their immediate command, still, there were
  other men who found themselves groping, at least two years before the Mutiny
  of '57. They were groping for something intangible and noiseless and
  threatening which they felt was there in a darkness, but which one could not
  see.</p>

  <p>Baines was one of them&mdash;Lieutenant-General Baines, commanding at
  Bholat. His troops were in the center of a spider's web of roads that criss-
  crossed and drained a province. There were big trunk arteries, which took the
  flow of life from city to walled city, and a mass of winding veins in the
  shape of grass-grown country tracks. He could feel, if any man could, the
  first faint signs of fever rising, and he was placed where he could move
  swiftly, and cut deep in the right spot, should the knife be needed.</p>

  <p>He was like a surgeon, though, who holds a lancet and can use it, but who
  lacks permission. The poison in India's system lay deep, and the fever was
  slow in showing itself. And meanwhile the men who had the ordering of things
  could see neither necessity nor excuse for so much as a parade of strength.
  They refused, point-blank and absolutely, to admit that there was, or, could
  be, any symptom of unrest.</p>

  <p>He dared not make new posts for officers, for officers would grumble at
  enforced exile in the country districts, and the Government would get to hear
  of it, and countermand. But there were non-commissioned officers in plenty,
  and it was not difficult to choose the best of them&mdash;three men&mdash;
  and send them, with minute detachments, to three different points of vantage.
  Non-commissioned officers don't grumble, or if they do no one gets to hear of
  it, or minds. And they are just as good as officers at watching crossroads
  and reporting what they see and hear.</p>

  <p>So where a little cluster of mud huts ached in the heat of a right angle
  where the trunk road crossed a native road some seventy miles from Bholat,
  Bill Brown&mdash;swordsman and sergeant and strictest of martinets, as well
  as sentimentalist&mdash;had been set to watch and listen and report.</p>

  <p>There were many cleverer men in the non-commissioned ranks of Baine's
  command, many who knew more of the native languages, and who had more
  imagination. But there was none who knew better how to win the unqualified
  respect and the obedience of British and native alike, or who could be better
  counted on to obey an order, when it came, literally, promptly and in the
  teeth of anything.</p>

  <p>Brown's theories on religion were a thing to marvel at, and walk
  singularly wide of, for he was a preacher with a pair of fists when
  thoroughly aroused. And his devotion to a girl in England whom no one in his
  regiment had ever seen, and of whom he did not even possess a likeness, was
  next door to being pitiable. His voice was like a raven's, with something
  rather less than a raven's sense of melody; he was very prone to sing, and
  his songs were mournful ones. He was not a social acquisition in any
  generally accepted sense, although his language was completely free from
  blasphemy or coarseness. His ideas were too cut and dried to make
  conversation even interesting. But his loyalty and his sense of duty were as
  adamant.</p>

  <p>He had changed the double guard at the crossroads; and had posted two
  fresh men by the mud-walled guardroom door. He had lit his pipe for the
  dozenth time, and had let it go out again while he hummed a verse of a
  Covenanters' hymn. And he had just started up to wall over to the cell and
  make a cursory inspection of his prisoner, when his ears caught a distant
  sound that was different from any of the night sounds, though scarcely
  louder.</p>

  <p>Prompt as a rifle in answer to the trigger, he threw himself down on all
  fours, and laid his ear to the ground. A second later, he was on his feet
  again.</p>

  <p>"Guard!" he yelled. "Turn out!"</p>

  <p>Cots squeaked and jumped, and there came a rush of hurrying feet. The
  eight men not on watch ran out in single file, still buttoning their
  uniforms, and lined up beside the two who watched the guardroom door.</p>

  <p>"Stand easy!" commanded Brown. Then he marched off to the crossroads,
  finding his way in the blackness more by instinct and sense of direction than
  from any landmark, for even the road beneath his feet was barely visible.</p>

  <p>"D'you mean to tell me that neither of you men can hear that sound?" he
  asked the sentries.</p>

  <p>Both men listened intently, and presently one of them made out a very
  faint and distant noise, that did not seem to blend in with the other night-
  sounds.</p>

  <p>"Might be a native drum?" he hazarded.</p>

  <p>"No, 'tain't!" said the other. "I got it now. It's a horse galloping.
  Tired horse, by the sound of him, and coming this way. All right,
  Sergeant."</p>

  <p>"One of you go two hundred yards along the road, and form an advance-
  post, so to speak. Challenge him the minute he's within ear-shot, and shoot
  him if he won't halt. If he halts, pass him along to Number Two. Number Two,
  pass him along to the guardroom, where I'll deal with him! Which of you's
  Number One? Number One, then&mdash;forward&mdash;quick&mdash; march!"</p>

  <p>The sentry trudged off in one direction, and Bill Brown in another. The
  sentry concealed itself behind a rock that flanked the road, and Brown spent
  the next few minutes in making the guard "port arms," and carefully
  inspecting their weapons with the aid of a lantern. He had already inspected
  there once since supper, but he knew the effect that another inspection would
  be likely to produce. Nothing goes further toward making men careful and
  ready at the word than incessant and unexpected but quite quietly performed
  inspection of minutest details.</p>

  <p>He produced the effect of setting the men on the qui vive without alarming
  them.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the farthest advanced sentry's challenge rang out.</p>

  <p>"Frie-e-e-e-nd!" came the answer, in nasal, high-pitched wail, but the
  galloping continued.</p>

  <p>"Halt, I tell you!" A breech-bolt clicked, and then another one. They were
  little sounds, but they were different, and the guard could hear them
  plainly. The galloping horse came on.</p>

  <p>"Cra-a-a-a-ack!" went the sentry's rifle, and the flash of it spurted for
  an instant across the road, like a sheet of lightning. And, just as lightning
  might, it showed an instantaneous vision of a tired gray horse, foam-flecked
  and furiously ridden, pounding down the road head-on. The vision was blotted
  by the night again before any one could see who rode the horse, or what his
  weapons were&mdash;if any&mdash;or form a theory as to why he rode.</p>

  <p>But the winging bullet did what the sentry's voice had failed to do. There
  came a clatter of spasmodic hoof-beats, an erratic shower of sparks, a curse
  in clean-lipped decent Urdu; a grunt, a struggle, more sparks again, and then
  a thud, followed by a devoutly worded prayer that Allah, the all-wise
  provider of just penalties, might blast the universe.</p>

  <p>"Stop talkin'!" said the sentry, and a black-bearded Rajput rolled free,
  and looked up to find a bayonet-point within three inches of his eye.</p>

  <p>"Poggul!" snarled the Mohammedan.</p>

  <p>"Poggul's no password!" said the sentry. "Neither to my good-nature nor to
  nothing else. Put up your 'ands, and get on your feet, and march! Look alive,
  now! Call me a fool, would yer? Wait till the sergeant's through with yer,
  and see!"</p>

  <p>The Rajput chose to consider a retort beneath his dignity. He rose, and
  took one quick look at the horse, which was still breathing.</p>

  <p>"Your bayonet just there," he said, "and press. So he will die
  quickly."</p>

  <p>The sentry placed his bayonet-point exactly where directed, and leaned his
  weight above it. The horse gave a little shudder, and lay still.</p>

  <p>"Poggul!" said the Rajput once again. And this time the sentry looked and
  saw cold steel within three inches of his eye!</p>

  <p>"Your rifle!" said the Rajput. "Hand it here!"</p>

  <p>And, to save his eyesight, the sentry complied, while the Rajput's ivory-
  white teeth grinned at him pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Now, hands to your sides! Attention! March!" the Rajput ordered, and with
  his own bayonet at his back the sentry had to march, whether he wanted to or
  not, by the route that the other chose, toward the guardroom. The Rajput
  seemed to know by instinct where the second sentry stood although the man's
  shape was quite invisible against the night. He called out, "Friend!" again
  as he passed him, and the sentry hearing the first sentry's footsteps,
  imagined that the real situation was reversed.</p>

  <p>So, out of a pall of blackness, to the accompanying sound of rifles being
  brought up to the shoulder, a British sentry&mdash;feeling and looking
  precisely like a fool&mdash;marched up to his own guardroom, with a man who
  should have been his prisoner in charge of him.</p>

  <p>"Halt!" commanded Brown. "Who or what have you got there, Stanley?"</p>

  <p>"Stanley is my prisoner at present!" said a voice that Brown vaguely
  recognized.</p>

  <p>He stepped up closer, to make sure.</p>

  <p>"What, you? Juggut Khan!"</p>

  <p>"Aye, Brown sahib! Juggut Khan&mdash;with tidings, and a dead gray horse
  on which to bear them! If this fool could only use his bayonet as he can
  shoot, I think I would be dead too. His brains, though, are all behind his
  right eye. Tie him up, where no little child can come and make him
  prisoner!"</p>

  <p>"Arrest that man!" commanded Brown, and two men detached themselves from
  the end of the guard, and stood him between them, behind the line.</p>

  <p>"Here's his rifle!" smiled Juggut Khan, and Brown received it with an ill
  grace.</p>

  <p>"How did you get past the other sentry?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, easily! You English are only brave; you have no brains. Sometimes one
  part of the rule is broken, but the other never. You are not always
  brave!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're angry because he killed your horse?"</p>

  <p>"I am angry, Brown sahib, for greater happenings than that! The man
  conceivably was right, since I did not halt for him, and I suppose he had his
  orders. I am angry because the standard of rebellion is raised, and because
  of what it means to me!"</p>

  <p>"Are you drunk, Juggut Khan?"</p>

  <p>"Your honor is pleased to be humorous? No, I am not drunk. Nor have I
  eaten opium. I have eaten of the bread of bitterness this day, and drunk of
  the cup of gall. I have seen British officers&mdash;good, brave fools, some
  of whom I knew and loved&mdash;killed by the men they were supposed to lead.
  I have seen a barracks burning, and a city given over to be looted. I have
  seen white women&mdash;nay, sahib, steady!&mdash;I have seen them run before
  a howling mob, and I have seen certain of them shot by their own
  husbands!"</p>

  <p>"Quietly!" ordered Brown. "Don't let the men hear!"</p>

  <p>"One of them I slew myself, because her husband, who was wounded, sent me
  to her and bade me kill her. She died bravely. And certain others I have
  hidden where the mutineers are not likely to discover them at present. I ride
  now for succor&mdash;or, I rode, rather, until your expert marksman
  interfered with me! I now need another horse."</p>

  <p>"You mean that the native troops have mutinied?" "I mean rather more than
  that, sahib. Mohammedans and Hindus are as one, and the crowd is with them.
  This is probably the end of the powder-train, for, from what I heard shouted
  by the mutineers, almost the whole of India is in revolt already!"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"God knows, sahib! The reason given is that the cartridges supplied are
  greased with the blended fat of pigs and cows, thus defiling both Hindu and
  Mohammedan alike. But, if you ask me, the cause lies deeper. In the meantime,
  the rebels have looted Jailpore and burned their barracks, and within an hour
  or two they will start along this road for Bholat, which they have a mind to
  loot likewise. My advice to you is retire at once. Get me another horse from
  somewhere, that I may carry warning. Then follow me as fast as you and your
  men can move."</p>

  <p>"Bah!" said Brown. "They'll find General Baines to deal with them at
  Bholat."</p>

  <p>"Who knows yet how many in Bholat have not risen? Are you positive that
  the garrison there has not already been surrounded by rebels? I am not! I
  would not be at all surprised to learn that General Baines is so busy
  defending himself that he can not move in any direction. And&mdash;does your
  honor mean to hold this guardroom here against five thousand?"</p>

  <p>"I mean to obey my orders!" answered Brown.</p>

  <p>"And your orders are?"</p>

  <p>"My orders!"</p>

  <p>"Would they preclude the provision of another horse for me?"</p>

  <p>"There's a village about a mile away, down over yonder, where I think
  you'll find a decent horse&mdash;along that road there."</p>

  <p>"And your honor's orders would possibly permit a certain payment for the
  horse?"</p>

  <p>"Positively not!" said Brown.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"To seize a horse, for military use, under the spur of necessity, and
  after giving a receipt for it, would be in order."</p>

  <p>"So I am to spend the night wandering around the countryside, in a vain
  endeavor to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Brown was doing mathematics in his head. Two men to guard prisoners,
  two on guard at the crossroads, two at the guardroom door&mdash;six from
  twelve left six, and six were not enough to rape a countryside.</p>

  <p>"Guard!" he ordered. "Release that prisoner. Now, you Stanley, let this be
  a lesson to you, and remember that I only set you free because I'd have been
  short-handed otherwise. Number One! Stand guard between the clink and the
  guardroom door. Keep an eye on both. The remainder&mdash;form two-deep. Right
  turn! By the left, quick-march! Left wheel!..... Now," he said, turning to
  Juggut Khan, "if you'll come along I'll soon get a horse for you!"</p>

  <p>The Rajput strode along beside him, and gave him some additional
  information as they went, Brown taking very good care all the time to keep
  out of earshot of the men and to speak to Juggut Khan in low tones. He
  learned, among other things, that Juggut Khan had lost every anna that he
  owned, and had only escaped with his life by dint of luck and swordship and
  most terrific riding.</p>

  <p>"Are all of you Rajputs loyal?" asked Brown.</p>

  <p>"I know not. I know that I myself shall stay loyal until the end!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;the end is not in doubt. There can only be one end!" commented
  Brown.</p>

  <p>"Of a truth, sahib, I believe that you are right. There can only be one
  end. This night is not more black, this horizon is no shorter, than the
  outlook!"</p>

  <p>"Then, you mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I mean, sahib, that this uprising is more serious than you&mdash;or any
  other Englishman&mdash;is likely to believe. I believe that the side I fight
  for will be the losing side."</p>

  <p>"And yet, you stay loyal?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"All the same, Juggut Khan&mdash;I'm not emotional, or a man of many
  words. I don't trust Indians as a rule! I&mdash;but&mdash;here&mdash; will
  you shake hands?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sahib!" said the Rajput. "We be two men, you and I! Why should
  the one be loyal and the other not?"</p>

  <p>"When this is over," said Brown, "if it ends the way we want, and we're
  both alive, I'd like to call myself your friend!"</p>

  <p>"I have always been your friend, sahib, and you mine, since the day when
  you bandaged up a boy and gave him your own drinking-water and carried him in
  to Bholat on your shoulder, twenty miles or more."</p>

  <p>"Oh, as for that&mdash;any other man would have done the same thing. That
  was nothing!"</p>

  <p>"Strange that when a white man does an honorable deed he lies about it!"
  said Juggut Khan. "That was not nothing, sahib, and you know it was not
  nothing! You know that from the heat and the exertion you were ill for more
  than a month afterward. And you know that there were others there, of my own
  people, who might have done what you did, and did not!"</p>

  <p>"But, hang it all! Why drag up a little thing like this?"</p>

  <p>"Because, sahib, I might have no other opportunity, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well? And what?"</p>

  <p>"And the Rajput boy whom you carried was my son!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chap3"
     id="chap3">CHAPTER 3</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The finding of a remount for Juggut Khan was not so
  troublesome as might have been supposed. The rumors and plans and whispered
  orders for the coming struggle had been passed around the countryside for
  months past, and every man who owned a horse had it stalled safely near him,
  for use when the hour should come.</p>

  <p>There were country-ponies and Arabs and Kathiawaris and Khaubulis among
  which to pick, and though the average run of them was worse than merely bad,
  and though both best and worst were hidden away whenever possible, good
  horses were discoverable. Within an hour, Bill Brown; with the aid of his
  men, had routed out a Khaubuji stallion for Juggut Khan, one fit to carry him
  against time the whole of the way to Bholat.</p>

  <p>The Rajput mounted him where Brown unearthed him, and watched the signing
  of a scribbled-out receipt with a cynical smile.</p>

  <p>"If he comes to claim his money for the horse," said Juggut Khan, "I
  &mdash;even I, who am penniless&mdash;will pay him. Good-by, Brown sahib!" He
  leaned over and grasped the sergeant by the hand. "Take my advice, now. I
  know what is happening and what has happened. Fall back on Bholat at once.
  Hurry! Seize horses or even asses for your men, and ride in hotfoot.
  Salaam!"</p>

  <p>He drove his right spur in, wheeled the horse and started across country
  in the direction of Bholat at a hand-gallop, guiding himself solely by the
  soldier's sixth sense of direction, and leaving the problem of possible
  pitfalls to the horse.</p>

  <p>"If what he says is true," said Brown, as the clattering hoof-beats died
  away, "and I'm game to take my oath he wouldn't lie to me, I'd give more than
  a little to have him with me for the next few hours!"</p>

  <p>The men came clustering round him now, anxious for an explanation. They
  had held their tongues while Juggut Khan was there, because they happened to
  know Brown too well to do otherwise. He would have snubbed any man who dared
  to question him before the Indian. But, now that the Indian was gone,
  curiosity could stay no longer within bounds.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Sergeant? Anything been happening? What's the news? What's
  that I heard him say about rebellion? They're a rum lot, them Rajputs. D'you
  think he's square? Tell us, Sergeant!"</p>

  <p>"Listen, then. Rebellion has broken out. The native barracks at Jailpore
  have been burned, and all the English officers are killed&mdash;or so says
  Juggut Khan. He's riding on, to carry the news to General Baines. He says
  that the mutineers are planning to come along this way some time within the
  next few hours!"</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do, then?"</p>

  <p>"That's my business! I'm in command here!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but, Sergeant&mdash;aren't you going back to Bholat? Aren't you
  going to follow him? Are you going to stay here and get cut up? We'll get
  caught here like rats in a trap!"</p>

  <p>"Are you giving orders here?" asked Brown acidly. "Fall in! Come on, now!
  Hurry! 'Tshun&mdash;eyes right&mdash;ri'&mdash;dress. Eyes&mdash; front.
  Ri'&mdash;turn. By the left&mdash;quick&mdash;march! Silence, now! Left!
  Left! Left!"</p>

  <p>He marched them back toward the crossroads without giving them any further
  opportunity to remonstrate or ask for information.</p>

  <p>It was not until he reached the crossroads, without being challenged, that
  he showed any sign of being in any way disturbed.</p>

  <p>"Sentry!" he shouted. "Sentry!"</p>

  <p>But there was no answer.</p>

  <p>"Halt!" he ordered, and he himself went forward to investigate. The
  blackness swallowed him, but the men could hear him move, and they heard him
  fall. They heard him muttering, too, within ten paces of them. Then they
  heard his order.</p>

  <p>"Bring a light here, some one."</p>

  <p>One man produced a piece of candle, struck a match and lit it. A moment
  later they had all broken order, and were standing huddled up together like a
  frightened flock of sheep, peering through dancing, candle-lit shadows at
  something horrible that Brown was handling.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Sergeant?"</p>

  <p>"What in hell's happened?"</p>

  <p>"Who was that swearing?" inquired Brown, with a sudden look up across his
  shoulder. "You, Taylor? You again? Swearing in the presence of death? Talking
  of hell, with your two comrades lying dead at the crossroads, and you like to
  follow both o' them at any minute?"</p>

  <p>Both of the guards lay dead. They lay quite neatly, side by side, without
  a sign about them to show that they had met with violence. Brown rolled one
  body over, though, and then the cause of death became more obvious. A stream
  of blood welled out of the man's back, from between the shoulder-blades
  &mdash;warm blood, that had not even started to coagulate.</p>

  <p>"They've been dead about three minutes!" commented Brown, rising, and
  wiping his hands in the road-dust to get the blood off them. "Pick 'em up.
  Carefully, now! Frog-march 'em, face-downwards. That's better! Now, forward.
  Quick, march!"</p>

  <p>The procession advanced toward the guardhouse in grim silence, and once
  again there was no challenge when there should have been. The lamp was still
  burning in the guardroom, for they could see it plainly as they drew nearer,
  but there was no noise of a sentry's footfalls, or hoarse "Halt!" and "Who
  comes there?"</p>

  <p>Nor was there any sign yet of the man whom Brown had left to guard both
  "clink" and guardroom. Brown let them take their dead comrades into the
  guardroom first, then set two fresh guards at the door, and covered up the
  bodies with a sheet before commencing to investigate.</p>

  <p>He started off toward the cell where he had imprisoned the fakir. He went
  by himself, and no one volunteered to go with him.</p>

  <p>He had gone five yards when the second explanation met his eyes. This time
  there was no need to stoop down, nor to turn any body over. The sentry whom
  he had left to guard both cell and guardroom stood bolt upright, with his
  mouth and his eyes wide open; skewered to the wall of the guardhouse by an
  iron spike, which pierced his chest.</p>

  <p>"A lamp and four men here!" ordered Brown, without waiting to let the
  horror of the sight sink in. "Take that poor chap down, and lay him in the
  guardroom beside the others. How? How should I know? Pull it out, or break it
  off&mdash;I don't care which; don't leave him there, that's all."</p>

  <p>He walked on toward the cell-door, while they labored, and fingered
  gingerly around the spike, which must have been driven through the sentry's
  chest with a hammer.</p>

  <p>"I thought as much!" he muttered. And, though be had not thought as much,
  he might have done so. "I knew that a man who could maim his own body in that
  way was capable of any crime in the calendar!"</p>

  <p>The door of the cell stood open, and there was no sign of any fakir, or of
  any one who might have helped him go&mdash;nothing but an empty cell, with
  the haunting smell of the fakir still abiding in it.</p>

  <p>Bill Brown spat, and closed the cell-door.</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking that Juggut Khan told nothing but the truth," he muttered.
  "Things look right, don't they, if that's so! Obey, Obey! I'd have liked to
  see England just once again&mdash;I would indeed. If I could only see her
  just once. If I'd a letter from her, or her picture. This is a rotten,
  rat-in-a-hole, lonely, uncreditable way to die! I wish Juggut Khan were here.
  I'd have somebody to help me keep my good courage up in that case."</p>

  <p>The lock on the cell-door was broken, so he only closed it, then started
  back toward the guardroom.</p>

  <p>"Three rifles, and three ammunition pouches gone!" he muttered. "That's
  three weapons they've got, in any case. A hornet's nest'd be better stopping
  in than this place."</p>

  <p>He overtook the men who were carrying in the nail-killed sentry, and he
  saw that their faces were drawn and white. So were those of the other men,
  who were clustered in the guardroom door.</p>

  <p>"What next, Sergeant? Hadn't we better be quick? Why not burn the place?
  That'd do instead o' buryin' the dead ones, and it'd give us a light to get
  away by. Might serve as a beacon, too. Might fetch assistance!"</p>

  <p>It was evident that panic had set in.</p>

  <p>"Fall in!" commanded Brown, and his straight back took on a curve that
  meant straightness to the nth power.</p>

  <p>"'Tshun! Ri'&mdash;dress! Eyes&mdash;front!"</p>

  <p>He glared at them for just about one minute before he spoke, and during
  that minute each man there realized that what was coming would be quite
  irrevocable.</p>

  <p>"I'm sergeant here. My orders are to hold this post until relieved.
  Therefore&mdash;and I hope there's no man here holds any other notion; I hope
  it for his own sake!&mdash;until we are relieved, we're going to hold it!
  Moreover, this command is going to be a real command, from now on. It's going
  to buck up. I'm going to put some ginger in it. There are three dead men here
  to be avenged, and I'm going to avenge 'em, or make you do it! And if any man
  imagines he's going to help himself by feeling afraid, let me assure him that
  the only thing he needs to fear is me! I've a right to command men&mdash;I
  know how&mdash;I intend to do it. And if I've got to make men first out of
  whey-faced cowards, why, I'm game to do it, and this is just where I begin!
  Now! Anybody got a word to say?"</p>

  <p>There was grim silence.</p>

  <p>"Good! I'll assume, then, until I'm contradicted, that you're all brave
  men. Into the guardroom with you!"</p>

  <p>"Sahib! Sahib!" said a voice beside him.</p>

  <p>"Well? What?"</p>

  <p>It was the Beluchi interpreter who had carried the lamp for him that
  evening when he arrested the fakir.</p>

  <p>"Run, sahib! It is time to run away!"</p>

  <p>"Go on, then! Why don't you run?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of the men who slew the soldiers. Sahib! Remember what the fakir said.
  You will be pegged out on an anthill, sahib, when you have been beaten. Run,
  while there is yet time!"</p>

  <p>"Did you see them kill my men?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"How was that?"</p>

  <p>"I ran away and hid, sahib."</p>

  <p>"How many were there?"</p>

  <p>"Very many. The Punjabi skin-buyer brought them."</p>

  <p>"He did, did he? Very well! Did he go off with the fakir?"</p>

  <p>"I think he did. I did not see."</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll suppose he did, then. And when the day breaks; we'll suppose
  that we can find him, and we'll go in search of him, and I wouldn't like to
  be that Punjabi when I do find him! Get into the guard-room, and wait in
  there until I give you leave to stir."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap4"
     id="chap4">CHAPTER 4</a></h2>

  <p class="first">An Indian city that has yet to have its mysterie's laid bare
  and banished by electric light is a stage deliberately set for massacre. The
  bazaars run criss-crosswise; any way at all save parallel, and anyhow but
  straight. Between them lies always a maze of passages, and alleys, deep
  sided, narrow, overhung by trellised windows and loopholed walls and guarded
  stairways.</p>

  <p>For every square inch where the sun can shine there are a hundred where a
  man could hide unseen. Through century piled on suspicious century, no
  designer, no architect, no builder has neglected to provide a means of secret
  ingress, and still more secret egress, to each new house. And the newest
  house is built on secret passages that hid conspirators against the kings of
  men who lived before the oldest house was thought of.</p>

  <p>After the Mutiny of '57 came broader roads&mdash;so that a cannon might be
  trained along them.</p>

  <p>But in '57, Jailpore was a nest of winding alley-ways and blind bat and
  rat holes, where weird smells and strange unlisted poisons and prophecies
  were born. In its midst, tight-packed in a roaring babel-din of many-colored
  markets, stood a stone-walled palace, built once by a Hindu king to
  commemorate a victory over Moslems, added to by a Moslem Nizam, to celebrate
  his conquest of the Hindus and added to once again by the Honorable East
  India Company, to make a suitable barracks for its native troops.</p>

  <p>From the rat-infested slums, from the hot shadows and the mazy back-
  bazaars, from temples, store-houses, shops, and from the sin-steeped
  underworld, there screamed and surged and swept the many-graded, many-minded
  polyglot rebellion-spume. A quarter of a million underdogs had turned against
  their masters. A hundred factions and as many more religions, all had one
  common end in view&mdash;to loot. All were agreed on one thing&mdash;that the
  first stage of the game must be to turn Jailpore and, after Jailpore, India,
  into a charnel-house.</p>

  <p>Around and around the burning palace the mob screamed and swept
  uncontrolled. Moslem looted Hindu, and Hindu Moslem. Armed sepoys, with the
  blood of their British officers fresh-soaked on their British uniforms, and
  the unspent pay of "John Company" still jingling in their pockets, danced
  weird, wild devil-dances through the streets, clearing their way, when they
  saw fit, with cold steel or wanton volleys. Women screamed. Caste looted
  caste. Loose horses galloped madly through the streets. Here and there a
  pitched battle raged, where a merchant who had wealth had also courage, and
  apprentices and friends to help him defend his store.</p>

  <p>And through all the din and clamor, under and above the howling and the
  volleys and the roar of flames, sounded the steady thumping of the sacred
  war-drums. The whole sky glowed red. The Indian night was scorched and smoked
  and lit by arson. Hell screamed with the cooking of red mutiny, and throbbed
  with the thunder of the sacred temple-drums. And that was only one of the
  hells, and a small one. India glowed red that night from end to end!</p>

  <p>Juggut Khan, free-lance Rajput and gentleman of fortune, had ridden out of
  that caldron of Jailpore. His house was a heap of glowing ashes, and his
  goods were tossed for and distributed among a company. But his mark lay
  indelibly impressed upon the town. There were three European women and a
  child who were nowhere to be found; and there was a trail that led from
  somewhere near the palace to the western gate. It was a red trail.</p>

  <p>In one spot lay a sepoy pierced through by a lance, and with half of the
  lance-shaft still standing upright in him. That had been bad art&mdash; sheer
  playing to the gallery! Juggut Khan had run him through and tried to lift him
  on the lance-end for a trophy. It was luck that saved the day for him that
  time, not swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>But a man who has done what he had done that day may be forgiven. There
  lay nine other men behind him where his lance was left, and each of them lay
  face upward with a round red hole in his anatomy where the lance had
  entered.</p>

  <p>And from the point where he had broken his lance and left it, up to where
  a self-appointed guard had refused at first to open the city gate for him,
  there was a trail that did honor to the man who taught him swordsmanship. One
  man lay headless, and another's head was only part of him, because the sword
  had split it down the middle and the two halves were still joined together at
  the neck.</p>

  <p>There were men who claimed afterward that of the twenty-three who lay
  between his lance-shaft and the city gate, some five or six had been slain in
  brawls and looting forays. And Juggut Khan was never known to discuss the
  matter. But the fact remains that every man of them was killed by the blade
  or point of a cavalry-saber, and that Juggut Khan broke out of the place
  untouched.</p>

  <p>And another fact worthy of record is, that underneath a stone floor, in a
  building that was partly powder-magazine-surrounded at every end and side by
  mutineers who searched for them, and very nearly stifled by the dust of
  decaying ages&mdash;there lay three women and a child, with a jar of water
  close beside them and a sack of hastily collected things to eat. They lay
  there in all but furnace-heat, close-huddled in the darkness, and they
  shuddered and sobbed and blessed Juggut Khan alternately. Below them the
  whispering echoes sighed mysteriously through a maze of tunnels. Around them,
  and around their sack of food, the rats scampered. Above them, where a
  ten-ton stone trapdoor lay closed over their heads, black powder stood in
  heaps and sacks and barrels. Closing the trapdoor had been easy. One pushed
  it and it fell. Not all the mutineers in Jailpore nor Juggut Khan nor any one
  could open it again without the secret. And no man living knew the secret.
  The three women and the child were safe from immediate intrusion!</p>

  <p>Those three women and that child were not so exceptionally placed for
  India, of that date. Two of the women had seen their husbands slain that
  afternoon, before their eyes. They were mother and daughter and grandson; and
  the fourth was an English nurse, red-cheeked still from the kiss of English
  Channel breezes.</p>

  <p>"If only Bill were here!" the nurse wailed. "I know he'd find a way out.
  There wasn't never nothing nowhere that beat Bill. Bill wouldn't ha' left us!
  Bill'd ha' took us out o' here, an' saved our lives. Bill&mdash;snnff,
  snnff&mdash;Bill wouldn't ha'&mdash;snnff, snnff&mdash;shoved us in a
  rat-hole and took hisself off!"</p>

  <p>She had not yet lost her English point of view. She still believed that
  the strong right arm of an English lover could play ducks and drakes with
  Destiny. One-half of the world, at least, still swears that she was wrong,
  and her mistress and the other woman thought her despicable, ridiculous,
  unenlightened. It was a hardship to them, to be endured with dignity and
  patience, but none the less a hardship, that they should be left and should
  have to die with this woman of the Ranks Below to keep them company. She was
  an honest woman, or they would never have engaged her and paid her passage
  all the way to India. But she was not of their jat, and she was a fool. It
  happens, however, that her point of view saved England for the English, and
  that the other point of view had brought England to the brink of utter
  ruin.</p>

  <p>"If you'd leave off talking about your truly tiresome lover, and would
  pray to God, Jane," said Mrs. Leslie, "the rest of us might have a chance to
  pray to God too! This isn't the time, let me tell you, to be thinking of
  carnal love-affairs. Recall your sins, one by one, and ask forgiveness for
  them."</p>

  <p>In the gloom of the vault, poor Jane was quite invisible. The sound of her
  snuffling and sobs was the only clue to her direction. But her bridling was a
  thing that could be felt through the stuffy blackness, and there was a ring
  in her retort that gave the lie to the tears that she was shedding.</p>

  <p>"The only sin I ask forgiveness for," she answered in a level voice, "is
  having let Bill come to India alone. Pray to God, is it? Go on! Pray! If Bill
  was here, he'd start on that stone door without no words nor argument, unless
  some one tried to stop him. Then there'd be an argument! And he'd get it open
  too. Bill's the kind that does his prayin' afterward, and God helps men like
  Bill!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'm afraid that your Bill isn't here, and can't get here. So
  the best thing that you can do is to pray and let us pray."</p>

  <p>"I'll pray for Bill!" said Jane defiantly. "Bill don't know that I'm in
  India, and he surely doesn't know I'm here. But if he knew&mdash;Oh, God! Let
  him know! Tell him! He'd come so quick. He'd&mdash;snnff, snnff&mdash;
  he'd&mdash;why, he'd ha' been here long ago! Dear God, tell Bill I'm here,
  that's all!"</p>

  <h2><a name="chap5"
     id="chap5">CHAPTER 5</a></h2>

  <p class="first">General Baines was in a position to be envied. No soldier
  worthy of his salt is other than elated at the thought of war. Now for the
  proving of his theories. Now for the fruit of all his tireless preaching and
  inspection and preparing&mdash;the planned, pegged-out swoop to victory!</p>

  <p>He knew&mdash;as few men in India knew&mdash;the length and the breadth of
  what was coming. And when two of his non-commissioned officers sent in word
  that the whole country was ablaze, he realized, as few other men did in that
  minute, that this was no local outbreak. The long-threatened holocaust had
  come, and he had to act, to smite, to strike sure and swift at the festering
  root of things, or Central India was lost.</p>

  <p>But his hands were tied still. He knew. He could see. He could feel. He
  could hear. But he had his orders. That very morning they had been repeated
  to him, and with emphasis. In a letter from the Council he had been told that
  "slight disturbances, of a purely local character, were not without the
  bounds of possibility, due partly to religious unrest and partly to local
  causes. Under no circumstances were any extended reprisals to be undertaken
  until further orders, and generals commanding districts were required to keep
  the bulk of their commands within cantonments."</p>

  <p>The countryside was up. All India probably was up. His own men, set by
  himself to watch with one definite idea, had confirmed his worst fears. And
  he was under orders to stay with the bulk of his command in Bholat! Corked up
  in cantonments, with three thousand first-class fighting-men squealing for
  trouble, and red rebellion running riot all around him though it might be
  quelled by instant action!</p>

  <p>And then worse happened. Juggut Khan clattered in to Bholat, spurring a
  horse that was so spent it could barely keep its feet. It fell in a woeful
  heap outside the general's quarters, and Juggut Khan&mdash;all but as weary
  as the horse&mdash;swung himself free, staggered past the sentry at the door
  and rapped with his hilt on the tough teak panel. They had to give him brandy
  and feed him before he could summon strength enough to tell what he had seen
  and heard and done.</p>

  <p>"And Brown stayed on at the crossroads?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, General sahib! He stayed!"</p>

  <p>The general sat back and drummed his heels together on the floor in a way
  that his aides had come to recognize as meaning trouble.</p>

  <p>"You say that all of the European officers in Jailpore have been
  killed?"</p>

  <p>"I did not count. I did not even know them all by mine or sight. I think,
  though, that all were killed. I heard men among the mutineers declare that
  all had been accounted for, save only three women and a child, and me. Those
  four I myself had hidden, and as for myself&mdash;I too was accounted for,
  and not without credit to the Raj for whom I fight!"</p>

  <p>"I believe you, Juggut Khan! Did you have to cut your way out?"</p>

  <p>The Rajput smiled.</p>

  <p>"There was a message to deliver, sahib! What would you? Should I have
  waited while they arrested me?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! You managed to evade them, did you?"</p>

  <p>"At least I am here, sahib!"</p>

  <p>The general chewed at his mustache, leaned his chair back against the wall
  and tapped at his boot with a riding-cane.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Juggut Khan," he said after another minute's thought, "what is
  your idea? Is this sporadic? Is this a local outbreak? Will this die down, if
  left to burn itself out?"</p>

  <p>The Rajput laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"'Sporadic,"' he answered, "is a word of which I have yet to learn the
  meaning. If 'sporadic' means rebellion from Peshawur to Cape Cormorin&mdash;
  revolution, rape, massacre, arson, high treason, torture, death to every
  European and every half-breed and every loyal native north, south, east and
  west&mdash;then, yes, General sahib, 'sporadic' would be the proper word. If
  your Honor should mean less than that, then some other word is needed!"</p>

  <p>"Then you confirm my own opinion. You are inclined to think that this is
  an organized and country-wide rebellion?"</p>

  <p>"I know of what I speak, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"You don't think that you are being influenced in your opinion by the fact
  that you have seen a massacre, and have lost everything you had?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib! This is no hour for joking, or for bearing of false tidings.
  I tell you, up, sahib! Boots and saddles! Strike!"</p>

  <p>The general chewed at his mustache another minute.</p>

  <p>"You know this province well?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"None better than I. I have traversed every yard of it, attending to my
  business."</p>

  <p>"And your business is?"</p>

  <p>"Each to his trade, sahib. My trade is honorable."</p>

  <p>"I have good reasons for asking, and no impertinence is meant. Be good
  enough to tell me. I wish to know what value I may place on your
  opinion."</p>

  <p>"Sahib, I am a full sergeant of the Rajput Horse retired. I bear one
  medal."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I sell charms, sahib."</p>

  <p>"What sort of charms?"</p>

  <p>"All sorts. But principally charms against the evil eye, and the red
  sickness, and death by violence. But, also love-charms now and then, and now
  and then a death-charm to a man who has an enemy and lacks swordsmanship or
  courage. I trade with each and every man, sahib, and listen to the talk of
  each, and hold my tongue!"</p>

  <p>"Strange trade for a soldier, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Would you have me a robber, sahib? Or shall I sweep the streets&mdash; I,
  who have led a troop before now? Nay, sahib! A soldier can fight, and can do
  little else. When the day comes that the Raj has no more need of him
  &mdash;or thinks that it has no more need of him&mdash;he must either starve
  or become a prophet. And his own home is no place for a prophet who would
  turn his prophesying into silver coin!"</p>

  <p>"Ah! Well-now, tell me! What is your opinion, without reference to what
  anybody else may think? You have just seen the massacre at Jailpore, and you
  know how many men I have here. And you know the condition of the road and the
  number of the mutineers. Would you, if you were in my place, strike at
  Jailpore immediately?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib. That I would not. I would strike north. And I would strike so
  swiftly that the mutineers would wonder whence I came. In Jailpore, all is
  over. They have done the harm, and they are in charge there. They have the
  powder-magazine in their possession, and the stands of arms, and the first
  advantage. Leave them there, then, sahib, and strike where you are not
  expected. In Jailpore you would be out of touch. You would have just that
  many more miles to march when the time comes&mdash;and it has come, sahib!
  &mdash;to join forces with the next command, and hit hard at the heart of
  things."</p>

  <p>"And the heart of things is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Delhi!"</p>

  <p>"You display a quite amazing knowledge of the game."</p>

  <p>"I am a soldier, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"You would leave Jailpore, then, to its fate?"</p>

  <p>"Jailpore has already met its fate, sahib. The barracks are afire, and the
  city has been given over to be looted. Reckon no more with Jailpore! Reckon
  only of the others. Listen, sahib! Has any message come from the next
  command? No? Then why? Think you that even a local outbreak could occur
  without some message being sent to you, and to the next division south of
  you? Why has no message come? Where is the next command? The next command
  north? Harumpore? Then why is there no news from Harumpore? I will tell you,
  sahib."</p>

  <p>"You mean, I suppose, that the country is up, in between?"</p>

  <p>"You know that it is up, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"You think that no message could get through to me?"</p>

  <p>"I know that it could not! Else had one already come. My advice to you,
  sahib, as one soldier to another and tendered with all respect, is to up and
  leave this Bholat. Here, of what use are you? Here you can hold a small city,
  until the countryside has time to rise and lay siege to you and hem you in!
  Outside of here, you can be a hornet-storm! They will burn Bholat behind you.
  Let them! Let them, too, pay the price. Swoop down on Harumpore, sahib
  &mdash;join there with Kendrick sahib's command. There make a fresh plan, and
  swoop down on some other place. But move, quickly, and keep on moving! And
  waste no time on places that are already lost."</p>

  <p>"Then you would have me leave those women and that child, that you tell me
  of to their fate?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib! I am not of your command. I have done my duty to the Raj, and
  I now go about my own business."</p>

  <p>"And that is?"</p>

  <p>"To repay a debt that I owe the Raj, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Your answers are rather unnecessarily evasive, Juggut Khan. Be good
  enough to explain yourself!"</p>

  <p>"I ride back to Jailpore, sahib. I would have stayed there, but it seemed
  right and soldierly to bring through the news first. Now, I return to do what
  I may to rescue those whom I hid there. I owe that to the Raj!"</p>

  <p>"You mean that you will ride alone?"</p>

  <p>"At least half of the distance, sahib. I had a favor to ask."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Are you marching north, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"I have not determined yet."</p>

  <p>"Determined, sahib! This is no hour for dallying! Give orders now! Up!
  Strike, sahib! Listen! Should you march on Jailpore, the mutineers, who far
  outnumber you, will learn beforehand of your coming, and will put the place
  in a state of defense. It may take you weeks to fight your way in! Leave
  Jailpore, and those who are left in it to me, and lend me that
  non-commissioned officer of yours who guards the crossroads, and his twelve
  men. With a few, we can manage what a whole division might fail to do. And
  you march north, sahib, and burn and harry and slay! Strike quickly, where
  the trouble is yet brewing, and not where the day is lost already!"</p>

  <p>It was case of the British power in India on one side of the scale,
  against three women and a child on the other; sentiment in the balance
  against strategy. And strategy must win, especially since this Rajput was
  offering his services.</p>

  <p>"What are their names, you say?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Leslie, wife of Captain Leslie; Mrs. Standish, wife of Colonel
  Standish and mother of Mrs. Leslie; Mrs. Leslie's child&mdash;I know not his
  name, he is but a child in arms&mdash;and the child's nurse."</p>

  <p>The general still found it difficult to make up his mind.</p>

  <p>"What proof have I of you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, my honor is in question! I have a debt to pay!"</p>

  <p>"What debt?"</p>

  <p>"To the Raj."</p>

  <p>"To the Raj?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, Sahib! I have but one son, and his life was saved for me by a
  British soldier. A life for a life. Four lives for a life. I ride! I need,
  though, a fresh horse. And I ask for the loan of that sergeant, and those
  twelve men."</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether a man such as you can realize exactly what it means to
  us to know that white women are in Jailpore, at the mercy of black mutineers?
  I mean, are you sufficiently aware of the extreme horror of the
  situation?"</p>

  <p>"Knew you Captain Collins Sahib, of the Jailpore command?"</p>

  <p>"Know him well."</p>

  <p>"Knew you his memsahib?"</p>

  <p>"She was a niece of mine."</p>

  <p>"I slew her myself, with this sword!"</p>

  <p>"When? Why?"</p>

  <p>"Yesterday. Because her husband could not get to her himself, and since he
  and I knew each other, and he trusted me. I said to her, 'Memsahib! I have
  your husband's orders!' She asked me 'What orders, Juggut Khan?' I said, 'Why
  ask me, memsahib? Is my task easier, or yours?' She said 'Obey your orders,
  Juggut Khan, and accept my thanks now, since I shall be unable to thank you
  afterward!' And then she looked me bravely in the face, and met her death,
  sahib. Of a truth I know! I am to be trusted!"</p>

  <p>"I believe you, Juggut Khan. And, incidentally, I beg your pardon for
  having doubted you. Have you slept ?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, Sahib. And I sleep not on this side of the crossroads!"</p>

  <p>"I don't place Sergeant Brown under your command&mdash;you'll understand
  that's impossible&mdash;but, it's quite impossible for him to catch me up. He
  may as well cooperate with you. Wait." He paused, and wrote, then continued,
  "Here is a note to him, in which I order him to work with you, and to take
  your advice whenever possible. Go to the stables, and choose any horse you
  like except my first charger. Here&mdash;here is money; you may need some.
  Count that, will you. How much is it? Four hundred rupees? Write out a
  receipt for it. Now, good luck to you, Juggut Khan. And if you should get
  through alive&mdash;I'll pay you the compliment of admitting that you won't
  come through without the women, and I know that Brown won't&mdash;if you
  should have luck, and should happen to get through, why, look for me at
  Harumpore, or elsewhere to the northward of it. I start with my division in
  an hour."</p>

  <p>"Salaam, sahib!" said Rajput, rising and standing at the salute.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, Juggut Khan! Take any food, or drink, or clothing that you want.
  Good-by, and your good luck ride with you. I feel like a murderer, but I know
  I've done the best that can be done!"</p>

  <h2><a name="chap6"
     id="chap6">CHAPTER 6</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Now if Sergeant Brown possessed a sweetheart, and the
  sweetheart lived in England, and if Brown still loved her&mdash;as has
  already been more than hinted at&mdash;it is not at all unreasonable to
  wonder why he had no likeness of her, no news of her, nothing but her memory
  around which to weave the woof of sentiment&mdash;at least, it's not
  unreasonable so to wonder in this late year of grace.</p>

  <p>Then, though, in 1857, when a newspaper cost threepence or thereabouts,
  and schools were so far from being free that only the sons of gentlemen (and
  seldom the daughters of even gentlemen, remember) attended them, the art of
  reading was not so common as it now is. Writing was still more uncommon. And
  it has not been pretended that Brown was other than a commoner. He was a
  stiff-backed man, and honest. And the pride that had raised him to the rank
  of sergeant was even stiffer than his stock. But he came from the ranks that
  owned no vote, nor little else, in those days, and he owned a sweetheart of
  the same rank as himself, who could neither read nor write. And when people
  whose somewhat primitive ideas on right and wrong lead them to look on
  daguerreotypes as works of the devil happen too to be living more than five
  thousand miles apart, when one of the two can not write, nor readily afford
  the cost of postage, and when the other is nearly always on the move from
  post to post, it is not exactly to be wondered at that memory of each other
  was all they had to dwell upon.</p>

  <p>A journey to India in '57 meant, to the rank and file, oblivion and worse.
  There were men then, of course, just as there are now, who would leave a girl
  behind them tied fast by a promise of futile and endless devotion; men who
  knew what the girls did not know&mdash;that India was all but inaccessible to
  any one outside of government employ, and that a common soldier's chance of
  sending for his girl, or of coming home again to claim her, was something in
  the neighborhood of one in thirty thousand.</p>

  <p>But there were other men, like William Brown, who were a shade too honest
  and too stiff-chinned to buckle under to the social conditions of England in
  those days, and who were consequently not exactly pestered with offers of
  employment. And a man who could see the difference between doffing his ragged
  cap to a dissolute squire or parson, and saluting his better on parade, could
  also see the selfishness of leaving an honest girl to languish for him. Brown
  could not get a living in England. So he told his girl to get a better man,
  swung his canvas bag across his shoulder and marched away.</p>

  <p>"What kind of a man is a better man than Bill?" she had wondered. Men like
  Bill seem to have a knack of judging character, and of picking girls who are
  as steadfast as themselves. So it is not to be wondered at that almost before
  her tears were dry she had set about attempting what few women of her type
  and time would have dreamed of. If Bill had set her free, she reasoned, Bill
  had no more authority over her, and she might do exactly what she chose. Bill
  could release, but he could not make her take another man. So, for all that
  the local yeomen, and local tradesmen even, haunted the little cottage on the
  Downs, and pestered her with their attentions, no one supplanted Bill.</p>

  <p>Bill could tell her&mdash;and had told her&mdash;that India was no country
  for a white woman; that there were snakes there, and black men and tigers and
  even worse. But, since he had set her free, if she could manage it she was
  quite at liberty to brave the tigers and the snakes. And, once there, she
  would see whether she was free or not, and whether Bill was, either!</p>

  <p>It took Bill Brown six years of constant honest effort to become a
  sergeant. It took Jane Emmett six weeks of pride-consuming and vexatious
  vigilance to procure for herself a job as nurse in a soldier-family. And it
  took her six more years of unremitting diligence, sweetened by all the
  attributes that seem desirable when nursing other people's children and
  embittered by the shame of grudging patronage, before she was considered
  dependable enough to be recommended for the service of a family just leaving
  for Bengal. Then, however, her world was a real world again!</p>

  <p>Five months on a sailing-ship around the Cape&mdash;deep-laden, gunwales
  awash in a beam&mdash;on Bay-of-Biscay "snorer," hove-to for a week off Cape
  Agul&mdash;has, while the clumsy brigantine rolled the masts loose in her,
  all but dismasted in a typhoon come astray from the China Sea, fed on moldy
  bread, and even moldier pork, with a fretful child to nurse, and an exacting
  mother to be pleased! Jane Emmett laughed at it. Bill had been there before
  her, and had done more on his way, and worse Bengal did not frighten her. Nor
  did the knowledge, when she reached it, that Bill was very likely still some
  hundreds of miles away. She, who had come five thousand miles as the crows
  are said to fly and nine thousand by the map, could manage the odd hundreds.
  And she could wait. She had waited six long years. What was another month or
  two?</p>

  <p>She had not even a notion where Bill was, beyond a vague one that he
  belonged to another province. For when the Honorable East India Company was
  muddling the affairs of India, the honors and emoluments and privileges
  &mdash;such as they were!&mdash;were reserved for the benefit of the
  commissioned ranks.</p>

  <p>So a transfer to Jailpore did not mean to Jane Emmett ten extra degrees of
  heat, the neighborhood of jungle-fever and a brand-new breed of smells. Those
  disadvantages, which weighted down the souls of her employers, were
  completely overshadowed, so far as she was concerned, by the knowledge that
  she was traveling nearer by a hundred leagues or so to where her Bill was
  stationed. She was going west; and somewhere to the west was Bill. Anything
  was good&mdash;fever, and prickly heat, and smells included&mdash;that
  brought her any nearer him.</p>

  <p>There would be no sense in endeavoring to analyze her sensations when the
  sudden outburst overwhelmed the inner-guard at Jailpore. The sight of white
  women being butchered, and of white men with the blood of their own women on
  their hands, selling their lives as dearly as the God of War would let them
  in a holocaust of flames, blinded her. It was probably just a splurge of fire
  and noise and smoke and blood in her memory, with one or two details standing
  out. The only real sensation that she felt&mdash;even when a tall, lean
  Rajput flung her across his shoulder, ran with her and dropped her down
  through a square hole into stifling darkness&mdash;was a longing for Bill
  Brown, her Bill, the one man in the world who could surely stop the
  butchery.</p>

  <p>The others prayed. But she refused to pray. She felt angry&mdash;not
  prayerful! Had she come nine thousand miles, and sacrificed six good years of
  youth and youth's heritage, to be cast into a reeking dungeon and left to die
  there in the dark? Not if Bill should know of it! And so she changed her
  argument, and prayed for Bill. If only Bill knew&mdash;straight-backed,
  honest, stiff-chinned, uncompromising, plain Bill Brown. He would change
  things!</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bill! Bill! Bill!" she sobbed. "Dear God, bring Bill to me!"</p>

  <h2><a name="chap7"
     id="chap7">CHAPTER 7</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When a man knows what is out against him, and from which
  direction he may look to meet death, he only needs to be a very ordinary man
  to make at least a gallant showing. Gallery or no gallery to watch, given
  responsibility and trained men under hire, not one man in a thousand will
  fail to face death with dignity.</p>

  <p>But Brown knew practically nothing, and understood still less, of what was
  happening. He had Juggut Khan's word for it that Jailpore was in flames, and
  that all save four of its European population had been killed. He believed
  that to be a probably exaggerated statement of affairs, but he did not blink
  the fact that he might expect to be overwhelmed almost without notice, and at
  any minute. That was a fact which he accepted, for the sake of argument and
  as a working-basis on which to build a plan of some kind&mdash;His orders
  were to hold that post, and he would hold it until relieved by General Baines
  or death. But there are several ways of holding a hot coal besides the rather
  obvious one of sitting on it.</p>

  <p>It would have been a fine chance to be theatrical, had play-acting been in
  his line. Many and many a full-blown general has risen to authority and fame
  by means of absolutely useless gallery-play. He believed that he would
  presently be relieved by General Baines, who he felt sure would march at once
  on Jailpore; and had he chosen to he could have addressed the men, have set
  them to throwing up defenses and have made a nice theatrical redoubt that he
  could have held quite easily with the help of nine men for a day or two. And
  since the really worthwhile things go often unrewarded, but the gallery-plays
  never, nobody would have blamed him had he chosen some such course as
  that.</p>

  <p>But Brown's idea of holding down a place was to make that place a thorn in
  the side of the enemy. And since he did not know who was the enemy, or where
  he was, nor why he was an enemy, nor when he would attack, he proposed to
  find out these things for himself preparatory to making the said enemy as
  uncomfortable as his meager resources would permit, when eked out by an
  honest "dogged-does-it" brain.</p>

  <p>He buried the three men whom Fate had seemed to value at the price of a
  fakir's freedom. And, being a religious man, to whom religion was a fact and
  the rest of the universe a theory, he was able to say a full funeral service
  over them from memory. He said it at the grave-end, with a lantern in his
  hand and one man facing him across the grave&mdash;as the English used to
  drink when the Danes had landed, each watching for the glint of steel beyond
  the other's shoulder.</p>

  <p>And, four on each side of the trench that they had dug, the remainder
  knelt and faced the night each way&mdash;partly from enforced piety, and
  partly because eight men back to back, with their bayonets outward and their
  butts against their knees, are an awkward proposition for an enemy. They
  mumbled the responses because Brown made them do it, and they kept their eyes
  skinned because the night seemed full of other eyes, and sounds.</p>

  <p>"And now, you men," said Brown, changing his voice to suit the nature of
  his task, "you can get your sleep by fours. I don't care which four of you
  goes to sleep first, but there are only two watches of us left, and there are
  about four hours left to sleep in, by my reckoning. That's two hours' sleep
  for each man. And we'll keep clear of the guardroom. As I understand my
  orders, the important point's the cross-roads. I'm supposed to halt every one
  who comes, and to ask him his business. And that'd be impossible to do from
  the guardroom here. Let this be a lesson to you men, now. In interpretin'
  orders, when a point's in doubt, always look for the meaning of the orders
  rather than the letter of them, obeying the letter only when the meaning and
  the letter are the same thing. The letter of our orders says the guardroom.
  The meaning's clear. We're here to guard the cross-roads. We take the
  meaning, and let the letter hang!</p>

  <p>"Besides! The way it seems to me, if there's any more trouble cooking in
  this neighborhood, it's going to cook pretty fast, and it's going to boil
  around that guardroom; and if we're not in the guardroom, why, that's point
  number one for us! Leave the guardroom lantern lighted, and bring out nothing
  but your cartridge-pouches and the box of ammunition. Leave everything else
  where it lies. Quick, now."</p>

  <p>They obeyed him on the run, afraid to be out of his sight for a moment
  even, trusting him as little children trust a nurse, and ready to do anything
  so long as he would only keep them up and doing, and not make them stay by
  the scene of the murders. Brown knew their state of mind as accurately as he
  knew the range of their service rifles, and he knew just how he could best
  keep panic from them. He knew too, if not what was best to do, at least what
  he intended doing, and he knew how he could best get them in a state to do
  it.</p>

  <p>Behind his own mind lay all the while a sense of loneliness and
  hopelessness. He did not entertain the thought of failure to hold the
  crossroads, and he was so certain that General Baines would come with his
  division that he could almost see the advance-guard trotting toward him down
  the trunk road. But there is no accounting for a soldier's moods, and
  something told him&mdash;something deep down inside him that he could neither
  name nor understand&mdash;that he was out now on the adventure of a lifetime,
  and that the heart-cord which had held him tight to England all these years
  had been cut. He felt gloomy and dispirited, but not a man of the nine who
  followed him had the slightest inkling of it.</p>

  <p>He halted them outside the guardroom, and bullydamned two of them because
  some unimportant part of their accouterments was missing; and he "'Tshuned"
  them, and stood them at ease, and "'Tshuned" them again, until he had them
  jumping at the word. Then he marched them two abreast in and out among the
  huts in search of any sign of native servants. They found no sign of any one
  at all. Though in that black darkness it would have been quite possible for
  half a hundred men to lie undetected. Brown decided that the camp was empty.
  He thought it probable that any one concealed there would have tried his luck
  on somebody at least, at close range as he passed.</p>

  <p>So he marched them back to the guard-room once again, and sent two of them
  in to drag out the shivering Beluchi, who had taken cover underneath a cot
  and refused to come out until he was dragged out by the leg. The native's
  terror served to pull the men together quite a little, for Tommy Atkins
  always does and always did behave himself with pride when what he is pleased
  to consider his inferiors are anywhere about. They showed that unfortunate
  Beluchi how white men marched into the darkness&mdash;best foot foremost;
  without halt or hesitation, when ghosts or murderers or unseen marksmen were
  close at hand.</p>

  <p>The Beluchi let himself be dragged, trembling, between two of them. It was
  he who first saw something move, or heard some one breathe. For he was
  absolutely on edge, and had nothing to attend to but his own fear. The others
  had to keep both eyes and ears lifting, to please Brown the exacting. The
  Beluchi struggled and held back, almost breaking loose, and actually tearing
  his loin-cloth.</p>

  <p>"Sahib!" he whispered hoarsely. "Sahib!"</p>

  <p>"What is it?" demanded Brown, scarcely waiting for an answer, though.
  Something told him what it was that moved, and his own skin felt goose-fleshy
  from neck to heel.</p>

  <p>"The fakir, sahib!"</p>

  <p>There was a murmur through the ranks, a sibilant indrawing of the
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Did I hear anybody swear?" asked Brown.</p>

  <p>Nobody answered him. All nine men stood stock-still, leaning on their
  rifles, their heads craned forward and their eyes strained in the direction
  of the gloomy baobab.</p>

  <p>"Form single rank!" commanded Brown.</p>

  <p>There was no response. They stood there fixed like a row of chickens
  staring at a snake!</p>

  <p>"Form single rank!"</p>

  <p>He leaped at them, and broke the first rule of the service&mdash;as a man
  may when he is man enough, and the alternative would be black shame.</p>

  <p>His fist was a hard one and heavy, and they felt the weight of it.</p>

  <p>"Form single rank! Take one pace open order! Extend! Now, forward&mdash;
  by the right! Right dress, there!"</p>

  <p>He marched in front of them, and they followed him for very shame, now
  that he had broken their paralysis.</p>

  <p>"Halt! Port-arms! Charge bayonets!"</p>

  <p>He was peering at something in the dark, something that chuckled and
  smelled horrible, and sat unusually still for anything that lived.</p>

  <p>"Numbers One, Two, Three&mdash;left wheel&mdash;forward! Halt! Numbers
  Seven, Eight, Nine&mdash;right wheel&mdash;forward! Halt!"</p>

  <p>They were standing now on three sides of a square. The fourth side was the
  trunk of the baobab. Between them and the trunk, the streaming tendrils
  swayed and swung, bats flitted and something still invisible sat still and
  chuckled.</p>

  <p>"One pace forward&mdash;march!"</p>

  <p>They could see now. The fakir sat and stared at them and grinned. Brown
  raised the lamp and let its rays fall on him. The light glinted off his eyes,
  and off the only other part of him that shone&mdash;the long, curved, ghastly
  fingernails that had grown through the palm of his upstretched hand.</p>

  <p>"How did you get here?" demanded Brown, not afraid to speak, for fear that
  fright would take possession of himself as well as of his men, but quite well
  aware that the fakir would not answer him. Then he remembered the
  Beluchi.</p>

  <p>"Ask him, you! Ask him how he came here."</p>

  <p>The Beluchi found his tongue, and stammered out a question. The fakir
  chuckled, and following his chuckle let a guttural remark escape him.</p>

  <p>"He says, sahib, that he flew!"</p>

  <p>"Ask him, could he fly with nine fixed bayonets in him!"</p>

  <p>There was a little laughter from the men at that sally. It takes very
  little in the way of humor to dispel a sense of the uncanny or
  mysterious.</p>

  <p>"He answers, sahib, that you have seen what comes of striking him. He asks
  how many dead there be."</p>

  <p>"Does he want me to hold him answerable for those men's lives?"</p>

  <p>"He says he cares not, sahib! He says that he has promised what shall
  befall you, sahib, before a day is past&mdash;you and one other!"</p>

  <p>"Ask him, where is the Punjabi skin-buyer?"</p>

  <p>The fakir chuckled at that question, and let out suddenly a long, low,
  hollow-sounding howl, like a she-wolf's just at sundown. He was answered by
  another howl from near the guardroom, and every soldier faced about as though
  a wasp had stung him.</p>

  <p>"Front!" commanded Brown. "Now, one of you, about turn! Keep watch that
  way! Is that the Punjabi?&mdash;ask him."</p>

  <p>"He says 'Yes!' sahib. He and others!"</p>

  <p>"Very well. Now tell him that unless he obeys my orders on the jump, word
  for word as I give them, I'll hang him as high as Haman by that withered arm
  of his, and have him beaten on the toenails with a cleaning-rod before I fill
  him so full of bayonet-holes that the vultures'll take him for a sponge! Say
  I'm a man of my word, and don't exaggerate."</p>

  <p>The Beluchi translated.</p>

  <p>"He says you dare not, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Advise him to talk sense."</p>

  <p>"He says, sahib, 'You have had one lesson!"'</p>

  <p>"Now it's my turn to give him one. Men! We'll have to give up that sleep I
  talked about. This limping dummy of a fakir thinks he's got us frightened,
  and we've got to teach him different. There's some reason why we're not being
  attacked as yet. There's something fishy going on, and this swab's at the
  bottom of it! We want him, too, on a charge of murder, or instigating murder,
  and the guardroom's the best place for him. To the guardroom with him. He'll
  do for a hostage anyhow. And where he is, I've a notion that the control of
  this treachery won't be far away! Grab him below the arms and by the legs.
  One of you hold a bayonet-point against his ribs. The rest, face each way on
  guard. Now&mdash;all together, forward to the guardroom&mdash;march!"</p>

  <p>The fakir howled. Ululating howls replied from the surrounding night, and
  once a red light showed for a second and disappeared in front of them. Then
  the fakir howled again.</p>

  <p>"Look, sahib! See! The guardroom!"</p>

  <p>It was the Beluchi who saw it first&mdash;the one who was most afraid of
  things in general and the least afraid of Sergeant Brown. A little flame had
  started in the thatch.</p>

  <p>"Halt!" ordered Brown. "Two of you hold the fakir! The remainder&mdash;
  volley-firing&mdash;kneeling&mdash;point-blank range. Ready&mdash;as you
  were&mdash;independent firing&mdash;ready! Now, wait till you see 'em in the
  firelight, then blaze away all you like!"</p>

  <p>His last words were cut off short by the sound of rifle-fire. Each rifle
  in turn barked out, and three rifles answered from the night.</p>

  <p>"Let that fakir feel a bayonet-point, somebody!"</p>

  <p>The fakir cursed between his teeth, in proof of prompt obedience by one of
  the men who held him.</p>

  <p>"Tell him to order his crowd to cease fire!"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi translated, and the fakir howled again. The flames leaped
  through the thatch, and in a minute more the countryside was lit for half a
  mile or more by the glare of the burning guardroom.</p>

  <p>The flames betrayed more than a hundred turbaned men, who hugged the
  shadows.</p>

  <p>"Keep that bayonet-point against his ribs. See? That comes o' moving
  instead o' sitting still! If we'd shut ourselves in the guardroom there, we'd
  have been merrily roasting in there now! We stole a march on them. Beauty
  here was sitting on his throne to see the fun. Didn't expect us. Thought we'd
  be all hiding under the beds, like Sidiki here! Goes to prove the worst thing
  that a soldier can do is to sit still when there's trouble. We're better off
  than ever. We're free and they won't dare do much to us as long as we've got
  Sacred-Smells-and-Stinks in charge. Form up round him, men, and keep your
  eyes skinned till morning!"</p>

  <h2><a name="chap8"
     id="chap8">CHAPTER 8</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Of course, discussing matters in the light of history, with
  full and intimate knowledge of everything that had a bearing on the Mutiny,
  there are plenty of club-armchair critics who maintain that England could not
  do otherwise than win in '57. They always do say that afterward of the side
  that won the day.</p>

  <p>But then, with history yet to make, things looked very different, and
  nobody pretended that there was any certainty of anything except a victory
  for the mutineers. All that either side recognized as likely to reverse
  conditions was the notorious ability that a beaten and cornered British army
  has for upsetting certainties. So the rebels had more than a little argument
  as to what steps should be taken next, once the initial butchery and loot had
  taken place.</p>

  <p>For instance, in Jailpore</p>

  <p>More than a hundred fakirs and wandering priests and mendicants had sent
  in word that the province from end to end was ready, and that the British
  slept. But there were those in Jailpore who distrusted fakirs and religious
  votaries of every kind. They believed them fully capable of rousing the
  countryside, of working on the religious feelings of the unsophisticated
  rustics and setting them to murdering and plundering right and left. But they
  doubted their ability to judge of the army's sleepiness. These doubters were
  the older men, who had had experience of England's craft in war. They knew of
  the ability of some at least of England's generals to match guile against
  guile, and back up guile with swift, unexpected hammer-strokes.</p>

  <p>There were men who claimed that what had happened in Jailpore would be
  repeated in Bholat and elsewhere. There was no need, these maintained, to
  march and join hands with other rebels. Each unit was sufficient to itself.
  Each city would be a British funeral pyre. Why march?</p>

  <p>Some said, "The general at Bholat will learn of the massacre, and will
  learn too, that not quite all were killed. He will come hotfoot to find the
  four we could not find. For these British are as cobras; slay the he cobra
  and the she one comes to seek revenge. Slay the she one and beware! Her
  husband will track thee down, and strike thee. They are not ordinary
  folk!"</p>

  <p>There were other factions that maintained that General Baines was strong
  enough, with his three thousand, to hold Bholat, unless the men of Jailpore
  marched, to join hands with the Bholatis&mdash;who were surely in revolt by
  this time. There were others who declared that he would leave Bholat and
  Jailpore to their fates without any doubt at all, and would march to join
  hands with the nearest contingent, at Harumpore.</p>

  <p>The bolder spirits of this latter faction were for setting off at once to
  prevent this combination. For a little while their arguments almost
  prevailed.</p>

  <p>But another faction yet, and an even more numerous one, insisted it were
  best to wait for news from other centers.</p>

  <p>Why march, they argued, why strike, why run unnecessary risks, before they
  knew what was happening elsewhere?</p>

  <p>"Surely," these argued, "the English will hear that four here are still
  unaccounted for. Some attempt will be made to find and rescue them. But if we
  find and slay them, and send their heads to Bholat, then will the English
  know that they are indeed dead. Then there will be no attempt at rescue, and
  we shall hold Jailpore unmolested as headquarters."</p>

  <p>That piece of logic won the day for a while, and parties were made up to
  explore the place, and search in every nook and cranny for the three women.
  and a child who surely had not passed out through any of the gates, and who
  were therefore just as surely in the city. A reward was offered by the
  committee of rebel-leaders and, although nobody believed that the reward
  would actually be paid, the opportunities for looting privately while
  searching were so great that the search was thorough.</p>

  <p>It failed, though, for the very simple reason that nobody suspected that
  the huge stone trap-door in the floor of the powder-magazine had ever been
  opened, or ever could be opened. The magazine had been a white man's watch.
  White men had kept guard over it for more than a hundred years, and the
  natives had forgotten that a maze of tunnels and caverns lay beneath it.</p>

  <p>So, while bayonet-points and swords were pushed into crevices, while smoke
  was sent down passages and tunnels and great, loose-limbed, slobbering hounds
  were led on the leash and cast to find a trail, the three women and the child
  lay still beneath the piled-up powder, and doled out water, and biscuit in
  siege-time measures. They lay in pitch-darkness, in a vault where not even a
  sound could reach them, except the whispered echo of their own voices and the
  scampering of the rats. They were growing nearly blind, and nearly crazed,
  with the darkness and the silence and the fear.</p>

  <p>Every second they expected to see daylight through the cracks above, as
  rebels levered up the door, or to hear feet and voices coming through the
  vaults below, for doubtless the vaults led somewhere. But for their fear of
  snakes and rats and unknown horrors, they would have tried to find a way
  through the vaults themselves. But as each movement that they made, and each
  word that they spoke, sent echoes reverberating through the gloom, they lay
  still and shuddered.</p>

  <p>Once they heard footsteps on the stone flags overhead. But the footsteps
  went away again, and then all was still. Soon they lost all count of time.
  They were only aware of heat and discomfort and fear and utter weariness.</p>

  <p>One woman and an infant wept. One woman prayed aloud incessantly. The
  third woman&mdash;the menial, the worst educated and least enlightened of the
  three, according to the others' notion of it&mdash;stubbornly refused to
  admit that there was not some human means of rescue.</p>

  <p>"If Bill were here," she kept on grumbling, "Bill'd find a way!"</p>

  <p>And in the darkness that surrounded her she felt that she could see Bill's
  face, as she remembered it&mdash;red-cheeked and clean-shaven&mdash;six years
  or more ago.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chap9"
     id="chap9">CHAPTER 9</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The blazing roof of the guardroom lit up even the crossroads
  for a while, and Brown and his men could see that for the present there was a
  good wide open space between them and the enemy. The firelight showed a tree
  not far from the crossroads, and since anything is cover to men who are
  surrounded and outnumbered, they made for that tree with one accord, and
  without a word from Brown.</p>

  <p>"We've all the luck," said Brown. "There's not a detachment of any other
  army in the world would walk straight on to a find like this!"</p>

  <p>He held up one frayed end of a manila rope, that was wound around the
  tree-trunk. Some tethered ox had rendered them that service.</p>

  <p>"Fifty feet of good manila, and a fakir that needs hanging! Anybody see
  the connection?"</p>

  <p>There was a chorus of ready laughter, and the two men who had the
  unenviable task of carrying the fakir picked him up and tossed him to the
  tree-trunk. The roof of the guardhouse was blazing fiercely, and now they had
  fired the other roofs. The fakir, the tree and the little bunch of men who
  held him prisoner were as plainly visible as though it had been daytime. A
  bullet pinged past Brown's ear, and buried itself in the tree-trunk with a
  thud.</p>

  <p>"Let him feel that bayonet again!" said Brown.</p>

  <p>A rifleman obeyed, and the fakir howled aloud. An answering howl from
  somewhere beyond the dancing shadows told that the fakir had been
  understood.</p>

  <p>"And now," said Brown, paraphrasing the well-remembered wording of the
  drill-book, in another effort to get his men to laughing again, "when hanging
  a fakir by numbers&mdash;at the word one, place the noose smartly round the
  fakir's neck. At the word two, the right-hand man takes the bight of the rope
  in the hollow of his left hand, and climbs the tree, waiting on the first
  branch suitable for the last sound of the word three. At the last sound of
  the word three, he slips the rope smartly over the bough of the tree and
  descends smartly to the ground, landing on the balls of his feet and coming
  to attention. At the word four, the remainder seize the loose end of the
  rope, being careful to hold it in such a way that the fakir has a chance to
  breathe. And at the last sound of the word five, you haul all together,
  lifting the fakir off the ground, and keeping him so until ordered to
  release. Now&mdash;one!"</p>

  <p>He had tied a noose while he was speaking, and the fakir had watched him
  with eyes that blazed with hate. A soldier seized the noose, and slipped it
  over the fakir's head.</p>

  <p>"Two!"</p>

  <p>The tree was an easy one to climb. "Two" and "three" were the work of not
  more than a minute.</p>

  <p>"Four!" commanded Brown, and the rope drew tight across the bough. The
  fakir had to strain his chin upward in order to draw his breath.</p>

  <p>"Steady, now!"</p>

  <p>The men were lined out in single file, each with his two hands on the
  rope. Not half of them were really needed to lift such a wizened load as the
  fakir, but Brown was doing nothing without thought, and wasting not an
  effort. He wanted each man to be occupied, and even amused. He wanted the
  audience, whom he could not see, but who he knew were all around him in the
  shadows, to get a full view of what was happening. They might not have seen
  so clearly, had he allowed one-half of the men to be lookers-on.</p>

  <p>"Steady!" he repeated. "Be sure and let him breathe, until I give the
  word." Then he seized the cowering Beluchi by the neck, and dragged him up
  close beside the fakir. "Translate, you!" he ordered. "To the crowd out
  yonder first. Shout to 'em, and be careful to make no mistakes."</p>

  <p>"Speak, then, sahib! What shall I say?"</p>

  <p>"Say this. This most sacred person here is our prisoner. He will die the
  moment any one attempts to rescue him."</p>

  <p>The Beluchi translated, and repeated word for word.</p>

  <p>"I will now talk with him, and he himself will talk with you, and thus we
  will come to an arrangement!"'</p>

  <p>There was a commotion in the shadows, and somewhere in the neighborhood of
  fifty men appeared, keeping at a safe distance still, but evidently anxious
  to get nearer.</p>

  <p>"Now talk to the fakir, and not so loudly! Ask him 'Are you a sacred
  person?' Ask him softly, now!"</p>

  <p>"He says 'Yes,' sahib, 'I am sacred!"'</p>

  <p>"Do you want to die?"</p>

  <p>"All men must die!"</p>

  <p>The answer made an opening for an interminable discussion, of the kind
  that fakirs and their kindred love. But Brown was not bent just then on
  dissertation. He changed his tactics.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to die, a little slowly, before all those obedient worshipers
  of yours, and in such a way that they will see and understand that you can
  not help yourself, and therefore are a fraud?"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi repeated the question in the guttural tongue that apparently
  the fakir best understood. In the fitful light cast by the burning roofs, it
  was evident that the fakir had been touched in the one weak spot of his
  armor.</p>

  <p>There can scarcely be more than one reason why a man should torture
  himself and starve himself and maim and desecrate and horribly defile
  himself. At first sight, the reason sounds improbable, but consideration will
  confirm it. It is vanity, of an iron-bound kind, that makes the wandering
  fakir.</p>

  <p>"Ask him again!" said Brown.</p>

  <p>But again the fakir did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Tell him that I'm going to let him save his face, provided he saves mine.
  Explain that I, too, have men who think I am something more than human!"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi interpreted, and Brown thought that the fakir's eyes gleamed
  with something rather more than their ordinary baleful light. It might have
  been the dancing flames that lit them, but Brown thought he saw the dawn of
  reason.</p>

  <p>"Say that if I let my men kill him, my men will believe me superhuman, and
  his men will know that he is only a man with a withered arm! But tell him
  this: He's got the best chance he ever had to perform a miracle, and have the
  whole of this province believe in him forevermore."</p>

  <p>Again the fakir's eyes took on a keener than usual glare, as he listened
  to the Beluchi. He did not nod, though, and he made no other sign, beyond the
  involuntary evidence of understanding that his eyes betrayed.</p>

  <p>"His men can see that noose round his neck, tell him. And his men know me,
  more or less, and British methods anyhow. They believe now, they're sure,
  they're positive that his neck's got about as much chance of escaping from
  that noose as a blind cow has of running from a tiger. Now then! Tell him
  this. Let him come the heavy fakir all he likes. Tell him to tell his gang
  that he's going to give an order. Let him tell them that when he says 'Hookum
  hai!' my men'll loose his neck straight away, and fall down flat. Only, first
  of all he's got to tell them that he needs us for the present. Let him say
  that he's got an extra-special awful death in store for us by and by, and
  that he's going to keep us by him until he's ready to work the miracle.
  Meantime, nobody's to touch us, or come near us, except to bring him and us
  food!"</p>

  <p>The fakir listened, and said nothing. At a sign from Brown the rope
  tightened just a little. The fakir raised his chin.</p>

  <p>"And tell him that, if he doesn't do what I say, and exactly what I say,
  and do it now, he's got just so long to live as it takes a man to choke his
  soul out!"</p>

  <p>The fakir answered nothing.</p>

  <p>"Just ever such a wee bit tighter, men!"</p>

  <p>The fakir lost his balance, and had to scramble to his feet and stand
  there swaying on his heels, clutching at the rope above him with his one
  uninjured hand, and sawing upward with his head for air. There came a murmur
  from the shadows, and a dozen breech-bolts clicked. There seemed no
  disposition to lie idle while the holiest thing in a temple-ridden province
  dangled in mid-air.</p>

  <p>"In case of a rush," said Brown quietly, "all but two of you let go! The
  remainder seize your rifles and fire independently. The two men on the rope,
  haul taut, and make fast to the tree-trunk. This tree's as good a place to
  die as anywhere, but he dies first! Understand?"</p>

  <p>The fakir rolled his eyes, and tried to make some sort of signal with his
  free arm.</p>

  <p>"Just a wee shade tighter!" ordered Brown. "I'm not sure, but I think he's
  seeing reason!"</p>

  <p>The fakir gurgled. No one but a native, and he a wise one, could have
  recognized a meaning in the guttural gasp that he let escape him.</p>

  <p>"He says 'All right! sahib!' " translated the Beluchi.</p>

  <p>"Good!" said Brown. "Ease away on the rope; men! And now! You all heard
  what I told him. If he says 'Hookum hai!' you all let go the rope, and fall
  flat. But keep hold of your rifles!"</p>

  <p>The fakir's voice, rose in a high-pitched, nasal wail, and from the
  darkness all around them there came an answering murmur that was like the
  whispering of wind through trees. By the sound, there must have been a crowd
  of more than a hundred there, and either the crowd was sneaking around them
  to surround them at close quarters, or else the crowd was growing.</p>

  <p>"Keep awake, men!" cautioned Brown.</p>

  <p>"Aye, aye, sir! All awake, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Listen, now! And if he says one word except what I told him he might say,
  tip me the wink at once "</p>

  <p>Brown swung the Beluchi out in front of him where he could hear the fakir
  better.</p>

  <p>"I'll hang you, remember, after I've hanged him, if anything goes
  wrong!"</p>

  <p>"He is saying, sahib, exactly what you said."</p>

  <p>"He'd better! Listen now! Listen carefully! Look out for tricks!"</p>

  <p>The fakir paused a second from his high-pitched monologue, and a murmur
  from the darkness answered him.</p>

  <p>"Stand by to haul tight, you men!"</p>

  <p>"All ready, sir!"</p>

  <p>The rope tightened just a little&mdash;just sufficiently to keep the fakir
  cognizant of its position. The fakir howled out a sort of singsong dirge,
  which plainly had imperatives in every line of it. At each short pause for
  breath he added something in an undertone that made the Beluchi strain his
  ears.</p>

  <p>"He says, sahib, that they understand. He says, 'Now is the time!' He says
  now he will order 'Hookum hai!' He says, 'Are you ready?' He says, sahib,
  &mdash;he says it, sahib,&mdash;not I&mdash;he says, 'Thou art a fool to
  stare thus! Thou and thy men are fools! Stare, instead, as men who are
  bewitched!'"</p>

  <p>"Try to look like boiled owls, to oblige his Highness, men!" said Brown.
  "Now, that's better; watch for the word! Easy on the rope a little!"</p>

  <p>The men did their best to pose for the part of semimesmerized victims of a
  superhuman power. The flame from the burning roofs was dying down already,
  for the thatch burned fast, and the glowing gloom was deep enough to hide
  indifferent acting. With their lives at stake, though, men act better than
  they might at other times.</p>

  <p>The fakir spun round on his heels and, clutching with his whole hand at
  the rope, began to execute a sort of dance&mdash;a weird, fantastic, horrible
  affair of quivering limbs and rolling eyeballs, topped by a withered arm that
  pointed upward, and a tortured fingernail-pierced fist that nodded on a
  dried-out wrist-joint.</p>

  <p>"Hookum hai!" he screamed suddenly, waving his sound hand upward, and
  bringing it down suddenly with a jerk, as though by sheer force he was
  blasting them.</p>

  <p>"Down with you!" ordered Brown, and all except Brown and the Beluchi
  tumbled over backward.</p>

  <p>"Keep hold of your rifles!" ordered Brown.</p>

  <p>The fakir's wailing continued for a while. With his own hand he took the
  noose from his neck and, now that the flames had died away to nothing but
  spasmodic spurts above a dull red underglow, there was no one in the watching
  ring who could see Brown's sword-point. Only Brown and the fakir knew that it
  was scratching at the skin between the fakir's shoulder-blades.</p>

  <p>"It is done!" said the fakir presently. "Now take me back to my dais
  again!" And the Beluchi translated.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to hear their trigger-springs released," suggested Brown. "This
  has all been a shade too slick for me. I've got my doubts yet about it's
  being done. Tell him to order them to uncock their rifles, so that I can hear
  them do it."</p>

  <p>"He says that they are gone already!" translated the Beluchi.</p>

  <p>"Tell him I don't believe it!" answered Brown, whose eyes were straining
  to pierce the darkness, which was blacker than the pit again by now.</p>

  <p>The fakir raised his voice into a howl&mdash;a long, low, ululating howl
  like that he had uttered when they found him on his dais. From the distance,
  beyond the range of rifles, came a hundred answering howls. The fakir waited,
  and a minute later a hundred howls were raised again, this time from an even
  greater distance.</p>

  <p>Then he spoke.</p>

  <p>"He says that they are gone," translated the Beluchi. "He says he will go
  back to his dais again."</p>

  <p>"'Tshun!" ordered Brown. "Now, men, just because we've saved our skins so
  far is no reason why we should neglect precautions. We're going to put this
  imitation angel back on his throne again, so the same two carry him that
  brought him here. There's no sense in giving two more men the itch, and all
  the other ailments the brute suffers from! Form up round him, the rest. Take
  open order&mdash;say two paces&mdash;and go slow. Feel your way with your
  fixed bayonet, and don't take a step in the dark until you're sure where it
  will lead you. Forward&mdash;march! One of you bring that rope along."</p>

  <p>The weird procession crawled and crept and sidled back to where it had
  started from not so long before&mdash;jumping at every sound, and at every
  shadow that showed deeper than the coal-black night around them. It took them
  fifteen minutes to recross a hundred yards. But when they reached the earthen
  throne again at last, and had hoisted the fakir back in position on it, there
  had been no casualties, and the morale of the men in Sergeant Brown's command
  was as good again as the breech-mechanism of the rifles in his charge.</p>

  <p>They were scarcely visible to him or one another in the blackness, but he
  sensed the change in them, and changed his own tune to fit the changed
  condition.</p>

  <p>His voice had nothing in it but the abrupt military explosion when he gave
  his orders now&mdash;no argument, no underlying sympathy. He was no longer
  herding a flock of frightened children. He was ordering trained, grown men,
  and he knew it and they knew it. The orders ripped out, like the crack of a
  drover's whip.</p>

  <p>"Fall in, now, properly! 'Tshun! Right dress! To two paces&mdash;open
  order&mdash;from the center&mdash;extend! Now, then! Left and right wings
  &mdash;last three at each end forward&mdash;right wheel&mdash;halt. That's
  it. 'Bout face. Now each man keep two eyes lifting till the morning. If
  anything shows up, or any of you hear a sound, shoot first and challenge
  afterward!"</p>

  <p>They were standing so when the pale sun greeted them, in hollow square,
  with their backs toward the fakir, who was squatting, staring straight in
  front of him, on his dais, with his back turned to the tree and his withered
  arm still pointing up to heaven like a dead man's calling to the gods for
  vengeance.</p>

  <p>A little later, Brown made each alternate man lie down and get what sleep
  he could just where he was, with a comrade standing over him. He himself
  slept so for a little while. But one of the men heard something move among
  the hanging tendrils of the baobab, investigated with his bayonet-point, and
  managed to transfix a twelve-foot python. After that there was, not so much
  desire for sleep. The fakir either slept with his eyes open or else dispensed
  with sleep. No one seemed able to determine which.</p>

  <p>When the day grew hotter, and the utterly remorseless Indian sun bore down
  on them, and on the aching desolation of the plain and the burnt-out
  guardhouse, the fakir still sat unblinking, gazing straight out in front of
  him, with eyes that hated but did nothing else. He seemed to have no time nor
  thought nor care for anything but hate and the expression of it.</p>

  <p>At noon, three little children came to him, and brought him water in a
  small brass bowl, and cooked-up vegetables wrapped in some kind of leaf.
  Brown let him have theirs, and bribed the frightened children to go and bring
  water for the men and himself. He gave them the unheard-of wealth of one
  rupee between them, and they went off with it&mdash;and did not come
  back.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the fakir had drunk his water, and had poured out what was left.
  He had also eaten what the children had brought him, and suddenly, from
  vacant, implacable hatred, he woke up and began to be amused.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" he laughed at them. "Ho-ho!" And then he launched out with a
  string of eloquence that Brown called on the Beluchi to translate.</p>

  <p>"Who said there would be thirst, and the sound of water! Is there a
  thirst? Who spoke of an anthill and of hungry ants and raw red openings in
  the flesh for the little ants to run in and out more easily?"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi translated faithfully, and the men all listened.</p>

  <p>"Tell him to hold his tongue!" growled Brown at last.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!" laughed the fakir. "The heat grows great, and the
  tongues grow dry, and none bring water! Ho-ho! But I told them that I needed
  these for a deadlier death than any they devised! Ho-ho-ho-ho! Look at the
  little crows, how they wait in the branches! Ha-ha-ha-ha! See how the kites
  come! Where are the vultures? Wait! What speck sails in the sky there? Even
  the vultures come! Ho-ho-ho-ho!"</p>

  <p>"I hear a horse, sir!" said one of the men who watched.</p>

  <p>"I heard it more than a minute ago," said Brown.</p>

  <p>The fakir stopped his mockery, and even he listened.</p>

  <p>"Ask him," said Brown, "where are the men who set fire to the
  guardroom?"</p>

  <p>"He says they are in the village, waiting till he sends for them!" said
  the Beluchi.</p>

  <p>"Keep an eye lifting, you men," ordered Brown. "This'll be a messenger
  from Bholat, ten to one. Mind they don't ambush him! Watch every way at once,
  and shoot at anything that moves!"</p>

  <p>"Clippety-clippety-clippety-cloppety&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The sound of a galloping horse grew nearer; a horse hard-ridden, that was
  none the less sure-footed still, and going strong in spite of sun and heat.
  Suddenly a foam-flecked black mare swung round a bend between two banks, and
  the sun shone on a polished saber-hilt. A turbaned Rajput rose in his
  stirrups, gazed left and right and then in front of him&mdash;from the
  burned-out guardhouse to the baobab&mdash;drew rein to a walk and waved his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"By all that's good and great and wonderful," said Brown aloud, "if here's
  not Juggut Khan again!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">CHAPTER 10</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It is not easy to give any kind of real impression of India
  twenty-four hours after the outbreak of the mutiny. Movement was the keynote
  of the picture&mdash;stealthy, not-yet-quite-confident pack-movement on the
  one hand, concentrated here and there in blood-red eddies, and, on the other
  hand, swift, desperate marches in the open.</p>

  <p>The moment that the seriousness of the outbreak had been understood, and
  the orders had gone out by galloper to "Get a move on!" each commanding
  officer strained every nerve at once to strike where a blow would have the
  most effect. There was no thought of anything but action, and offensive, not
  defensive action. Until some one at the head of things proved still to be
  alive, and had had time to form a plan, each divisional commander acted as he
  saw fit. That was all that any one was asked to do at first: to act, to
  strike, to plunge in headlong where the mutiny was thickest and most
  dangerous, to do anything, in fact; except sit still.</p>

  <p>Even with the evidence of mutiny and treachery on every side, with red
  flames lighting the horizon and the stench of burning villages on every hand,
  the strange Anglo-Saxon quality persisted that has done more even that the
  fighting-quality to teach the English tongue to half the world. The native
  servants who had not yet run away retained their places still, unquestioned.
  When an Englishman has once made up his mind to trust another man, he trusts
  him to the hilt, whatever shade of brown or red or white his hide may be.</p>

  <p>But, since every rule has its exceptions, there were some among the native
  servants, who remained ostensibly loyal to their masters, who would better
  have been shot or hanged at the first suggestion of an outbreak. For
  naturally a man who is trusted wrongly is far more dangerous than one who is
  held in suspicion. But it never was the slightest use endeavoring to persuade
  an average English officer that his own man could be anything but loyal. He
  may be a thief and a liar and a proved-up rogue in every other way; but as
  for fearing to let him sleep about the house, or fearing to let him cook his
  master's food, or fearing to let him carry firearms&mdash;well! Perhaps, it
  is conceit, or maybe just ordinary foolishness. It is not fear!</p>

  <p>So, in a country where the art of poisoning has baffled analysts since
  analysts have been invented, and where blood-hungry fanatic priests, both
  Hindu and Mohammedan, were preaching and promising the reward of highest
  heaven to all who could kill an Englishman or die in the attempt, a native
  cook whose antecedents were obscured in mystery cooked dinner for a British
  general, and marched with his column to perform the same service while the
  general tried to trounce the cook's friends and relatives!</p>

  <p>But General Baines felt perfectly at ease about his food. He never gave a
  thought to it, but ate what was brought to him, sitting his horse most
  likely, and chewing something as he rode among the men, and saw that they
  filled their bellies properly. He had made up his mind to march on Harumpore,
  and to take over the five-hundred-strong contingent there. Then he could
  swoop down on any of a dozen other points, in any one of which a blow would
  tell.</p>

  <p>He was handicapped by knowing almost too much. He had watched so long, and
  had suspected for so long that some sort of rebellion was brewing that, now
  that it had come, his brain was busy with the tail-ends of a hundred scraps
  of plans. He was so busy wondering what might be happening to all the other
  men subordinate to him, who would have to be acting on their own initiative,
  that his own plans lacked something of directness. But there was no lack of
  decision, and no time was lost. The men marched, and marched their swiftest,
  in the dust-laden Indian heat. And he marched with them, in among them, and
  ate what the cook brought him, without a thought but for the best interests
  of the government he served.</p>

  <p>So they buried General Baines some eighty-and-twenty miles from Harumpore,
  and shot the cook. And, according to the easy Indian theology, the cook was
  wafted off to paradise, while General Baines betook himself to hell, or was
  betaken. But the column, three thousand perspiring Britons strong, continued
  marching, loaded down with haversacks and ammunition and resolve.</p>

  <p>It was met, long before the jackals had dug down to General Baines'
  remains, by the advance-guard of Colonel Kendrick's column, which was coming
  out of Harumpore because things were not brisk enough in that place to keep
  it busy. Kendrick himself was riding with the cavalry detachment that led the
  way southward.</p>

  <p>"Who's in command now?" he asked, for they had told him of General Baines'
  death by poison.</p>

  <p>"I am," said a gray-haired officer who rode up at that moment.</p>

  <p>"I'm your senior, sir, by two years," answered Kendrick.</p>

  <p>"Then you command, sir."</p>

  <p>"Very good. Enough time's been wasted. The column can wait here until my
  main body reaches us. Then we'll march at once on Jailpore. This idea of
  leaving Jailpore to its fate is nonsense! The rebels are in strength there,
  and they have perpetrated an abominable outrage. There we will punish them,
  or else we'll all die in the attempt! If we have to raze Jailpore to the
  ground, and put every man in it to the sword before we find the four
  Europeans supposed to be left alive there, our duty is none the less obvious!
  Here comes my column. Tell the men to be ready to march in ten minutes."</p>

  <p>He turned his horse, to look through the dust at the approaching column,
  but the man who had been superseded touched him on the sleeve.</p>

  <p>"What's that? Better have a rest? Tired out, you say? Oh! Form them all up
  in hollow square, then, and I'll say a few words to them. There are other
  ways of reviving a leg-weary column than by letting it lie down."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later a dull roar rose up through a steel-shot dust-cloud, and
  three thousand helmets whirled upward, flashing in the sun. Three thousand
  weary men had given him his answer! There was no kind of handle to it; no
  reserve&mdash;nothing but generous and unconditional allegiance unto hunger,
  thirst, pain, weariness, disease or death. It takes a real commander to draw
  that kind of answer from a tired-out column, but it is a kind of answer, too,
  that makes commanders! It is not mere talk, on either side. It means that by
  some sixth sense a strong man and his men have discovered something that is
  good in each other.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">CHAPTER 11</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"You've made good time, friend Juggut Khan!" said Brown,
  advancing to meet him where the men and the fakir and the interpreter would
  not be able to Overhear.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, I killed one horse&mdash;the horse you looted for me&mdash;and I
  brought away two from Bholat. One of them carried me more than fifty miles,
  and then I changed to this one, leaving the other on the road. I have orders
  for you, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Hand 'em over then," said Brown. "Orders first, and talk afterward, when
  there's time!"</p>

  <p>The Rajput drew out a sealed envelope, and passed it to him. Brown tore it
  open, and read the message, scowling at the half-sheet of paper as though it
  were a death-sentence.</p>

  <p>"Where's the general?"</p>

  <p>"With his column-twenty or thirty miles away to the northward by now!"</p>

  <p>"And he's left me, with this handful, in the lurch?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib! As I understood the orders, he has left you with a very
  honorable mission to fulfil!"</p>

  <p>Brown stared hard at the half-sheet of notepaper again. Reading was not
  his longest suit by any means, and at that he infinitely preferred to wrestle
  with printed characters.</p>

  <p>"Have you read it, Juggut Khan?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib. I can speak English, but not read it."</p>

  <p>"Then we're near to being in the same boat, we two!" said Brown with a
  grin. "I'll have another try! It looks like a good-by message to me&mdash;
  here's the word 'good-by' written at the end above his signature."</p>

  <p>"There were other matters, sahib. There was an order. I can not read, but
  I know what is in the message."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"You, and your twelve&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nine!" corrected Brown.</p>

  <p>"Three dead?"</p>

  <p>Brown nodded.</p>

  <p>"Your nine, then, sahib, and you and I are to proceed immediately to
  Jailpore, and to gain an entrance if we can, rescue those whom I concealed
  there and bring them to Harumpore, or to the northward of Harumpore, wherever
  we can find the column."</p>

  <p>"Eleven men are to attempt that?"</p>

  <p>Brown was studying out the letter word by word, and discovering to his
  amazement that its purport was exactly what Juggut Khan pretended.</p>

  <p>"If there are no more than eleven of us, then yes, eleven! And, sahib,
  since you seem to hold at least an island here where a man may lie down
  unmolested, I propose to sleep for an hour or two, before proceeding. I have
  had no sleep since I left Jailpore."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort!" said Brown. "If we're to march on Jailpore, off we
  go at once! You can sleep on the road, my son! It's time we paid a visit to
  that village, I'm thinking. Those treacherous brutes need a lesson. I'd have
  been down there before, only I wanted to be in full view of the road in case
  anybody came looking for me from Bholat. We'll need a wagon for the fakir.
  You can sleep in it too."</p>

  <p>"Sleep with a fakir? I? Allah! I am a Rajput, sahib! A sergeant of the
  Rajput Horse, retired!"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't want to sleep with him myself!" admitted Brown. "Come and look
  at him. You can smell him from here, but the sight of him's the real
  thing!"</p>

  <p>The Rajput swaggered up beside Brown, after loosening his horse's girths
  and lifting the saddle for a moment.</p>

  <p>"He's not the only one that needs a drink!" said Brown. "We're all dry as
  brick-dust here, except the fakir!"</p>

  <p>"He must wait a while before he drinks. Show me the fakir. Why, Brown
  sahib, know you what you have there?"</p>

  <p>"The father of all the smells, and all the dirt and all the evil eyes and
  evil tongues in Asia!" Brown hazarded.</p>

  <p>"More than that, sahib! That is the nameless fakir&mdash;him whom they
  know as HE! Has there been no attempt made to rescue him?"</p>

  <p>"They rescued him once, and murdered three of my men to get him. When they
  tried again, I put a halter round his neck and he and I arranged a sort of
  temporary compromise."</p>

  <p>"And the terms of it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's supposed to have performed a miracle.</p>

  <p>He made us unslip the halter, and fall down flat, and he's supposed to be
  keeping us by him, by a sort of spell, so's to give us something
  extra-special in the line of ghastly deaths at his own convenience. That way,
  I was able to wait for news from Bholat&mdash;see?"</p>

  <p>"You could have captured no more important prisoner than that, sahib, let
  me tell you! They believe him to be almost a god; so nearly one that the gods
  themselves obey his orders now and then! It was he, and no other, that told
  the men of Jailpore that he would make them impervious to bullets. If we have
  him, sahib, we have the key to Jailpore!"</p>

  <p>"We, have certainly got him," said Brown. "You can see him, and you can
  smell him. I'll order one of the men to prick him with a bayonet, if you want
  to hear him, too! I wouldn't feel him, if I were you!"</p>

  <p>"He must come, too, to Jailpore!"</p>

  <p>"Of course he comes!"</p>

  <p>"Then, sahib, let us move away from here to where there is water. There
  let us rest until sundown, and then march, in the cool of the evening. It
  will be better so. And of a truth I must sleep, or else drop dead from
  weariness."</p>

  <p>"Does that message put you in command?" asked Brown, a trifle
  truculently.</p>

  <p>"No, sahib! But it orders you to listen to my advice whenever
  possible."</p>

  <p>"That means that you are under my orders?"</p>

  <p>"That letter does not say so, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Very well, are you, or are you not?"</p>

  <p>"We are supposed to act in concert, sahib."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't say so in the letter! Yes, or no? Are you going to obey
  orders, or aren't you? In other words, are you coming with me, or do you stay
  behind?"</p>

  <p>"I come with you, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Then you obey my orders!"</p>

  <p>"But the letter says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That I'm to take your advice whenever possible! I don't need advice just
  at the moment, thanks! I've got orders here to march, and I'm off at once!
  You can please yourself whether you come with me or not, but if you come you
  come on my terms."</p>

  <p>"I go with you, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Under my orders?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>"All right, Juggut Khan. Here's my hand on it. Now, we'll swoop down on
  that village, and take the fakir with us, with a halter round his neck for
  the sake of argument. We'll get two bullock-carts down there, and we'll stick
  him in one of them, with Sidiki the interpreter tied to him. Sidiki won't
  like it, but he's only a Beluchi anyway! You get in the other, and get all
  the sleep you can. You and I'll take turns sleeping all the way to Jailpore,
  so's to be fresh, both of us, and fit for anything by the time that we get
  there!"</p>

  <p>"I am ready, sahib."</p>

  <p>"You two men who carried old Stinkijink before, pick him up again!"
  shouted Brown. "Let him feel the bayonet if he makes a noise, but carry him
  gently as though you loved him. The rest&mdash;'Tshun! Form two-deep
  &mdash;on the center&mdash;close order, march. Ri' dress. Eyes front. Ri'
  turn. By the left&mdash;quick march."</p>

  <p>The Rajput strode beside Brown, wondering wearily whether it was worth his
  while to offer him advice or not, and keeping his tired eyes ever moving in
  the direction of the distant huts.</p>

  <p>"They have rifles, sahib?" he queried.</p>

  <p>"Lots of 'em! Three that they took from my men, among others."</p>

  <p>"It would not be well to march into a trap at this stage."</p>

  <p>"As well now as later." "True, sahib! And my time has not come yet; I know
  it. Else had I died of weariness, as my horse did."</p>

  <p>Brown kept rigidly to that point of view in everything he did, from that
  time on until he reached Jailpore. He believed himself to be engaged on a
  forlorn hope that was so close to being an absolute impossibility as to be
  almost the same thing. He had no doubt whatever in his own mind but that his
  own death, and the death of those with him, was a matter now of hours, or
  possibly of minutes. His one resolute determination was to die, and make the
  others die, in a manner befitting their oath of service. He had orders, and
  he would pass them on according to his interpretation of them. He would obey
  his orders, and they theirs, and the rest was no business of his or
  anybody's.</p>

  <p>They put the fakir in a hut; where Juggut Khan&mdash;too weary for
  foraging&mdash;stood guard over him. When a crowd collected round the hut,
  and Juggut Khan applied the butt of a lighted cigarette to the tender skin
  between the fakir's shoulder-blades, the anxious fakir-worshipers were told
  that all was well. They were to let the white soldiers take two wagons, or
  three even, if they wanted them. They were to return to their houses at once,
  and hide, lest the devils who would shortly overwhelm the white men should
  make mistakes and include them, too, in the whelming. He, the fakir, intended
  to take the white men for a little journey along the road toward Jailpore,
  where the devils who would deal with them would have no opportunity to make
  mistakes. And, since the natives knew that Jailpore was a rebel stronghold,
  and that ten white men and a native would have no chance to do the slightest
  damage there, they chose to believe the fakir and to obey him.</p>

  <p>Hindus have as stubborn and unalterable a habit of obeying and believing
  their priests&mdash;when the fancy suits them&mdash;as white men of other
  religions have.</p>

  <p>If the fakir had told them through the doorway of the hut that he intended
  going with the white men in the direction of Bholat, they would most surely
  have prevented him. But it suited them very well indeed to have the white men
  killed elsewhere. It was not likely, but there might be a column on its way
  from Bholat now; and if that column came, and found the bones of British
  soldiers as well as a burned-out guard-house, vengeance would be dire and
  prompt. Between where they were and Jailpore, the white men could not
  possibly escape. And at Jailpore, if not sooner, they must surely die. So
  they believed the fakir, and retired to the seclusion of their houses.</p>

  <p>It was wonderful, of course, but no more wonderful than a thousand other
  happenings in '57. All laws of probability and general average were upset
  that year, when sixty thousand men held down an armed continent. Even
  stranger things were happening than that two bullock-carts should dawdle
  through a rebel-seething district in the direction of a plundered,
  blood-soaked rebel stronghold; stranger even than that on the foremost
  bullock-cart a lean and louse-infested fakir should be squatting, guarded by
  British soldiers, who marched on either hand; or that a Rajput, who could
  trace his birth from a thousand-year-long line of royal chieftains, should be
  sleeping in the bullock-cart behind, followed closely by a black charger with
  a British saddle on its back, which ate corn from the tail-board of the
  wagon; stranger things, even, than that a British sergeant should be marching
  last of all, with his stern eyes roving a little wildly but his jaw set firm
  and his tread as rigid and authoritative and abrupt as though he were
  marching to inspect accouterments.</p>

  <p>In more than a dozen places, about a dozen men were holding a fort against
  an army. They were using every wile and trick and dodge that ingenuity or
  inspiration could provide them with, and they were mostly contriving to hold
  out. But there were none who did anything more daring or more unusual than to
  march to the attack of a city, with a hostile fakir in the van, and nothing
  else but their eleven selves and their rifles to assist them. There is a
  tremendous difference between defending when you have to, and attacking when
  you might retire.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12">CHAPTER 12</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There were many more causes than one that worked together to
  make possible the entry of Brown and his little force into Jailpore. They
  were brave men; they were more than brave and they held the ace of trumps, as
  Brown had stated, in the person of the fakir known as "He." But luck favored
  them as well, and but for luck they must have perished half a dozen
  times.</p>

  <p>They marched the whole of the first afternoon, and met no one. They only
  overtook little straggling parties of rebels, making one and all for
  Jailpore, who bolted at the sight of them, imagining them probably to be the
  advance-guard of a larger force. The very idiocy of marching eleven strong
  through a country infested by their enemies was in their favor. Nobody could
  believe that there were no more than eleven of them. Even the English could
  not be such lunatics!</p>

  <p>That night, they rested for a while, and then went on again. During the
  day following they lay in a hollow between some trees and rested, and slept
  by turns. They suffered agonies from the heat, and not a little from hunger,
  and once or twice they were hard put to it to stop the Rajput's charger from
  neighing when a native pony passed along the nearby road. But night came
  again, and with it the screen of darkness for their strange, almost
  defenseless caravan. Once or twice the fakir tried to shout an alarm to
  passing villagers, but the quick and energetic application of a cleaning-rod
  by Brown stopped him always in the nick of time, and they came within sight
  of the battlements of Jailpore without an accident.</p>

  <p>Then, though, their problem became really serious, and it was a series of
  circumstances altogether out of their control and not connected with them
  that made their entry possible. The mutineers in Jailpore had learned that
  Kendrick sahib was coming down on them from the north by forced marches with
  thirty-five hundred men or more. They were putting the place into a state of
  siege, and getting ready by all means in their power to oppose him.</p>

  <p>Little attention was being paid to small parties of arrivals from no man
  knew or cared where. And, in a final effort to find the four who were the
  lure that was bringing Kendrick down on them, the city was once more being
  turned upside down and inside out, and men were even being tortured who were
  thought to know of hiding-places.</p>

  <p>With purely Eastern logic, the leaders of the rebels had decided that the
  sight of the bodies of the four, writhing in their last agony on the sun-
  scorched outer wall, would mightily discourage the British when they came. So
  no efforts were being spared and no stones left unturned to find them. The
  hooks on the wall were sharp and ready, so that they might be impaled without
  loss of time in full view of their would-be rescuers.</p>

  <p>Almost every secret passage of the thousand odd had been explored. In the
  hurry to run through them and explore the next one, doors had been left open
  here and there that had been kept closed in some instances for centuries.</p>

  <p>One door in particular, placed cornerwise in a buttress of the outer wall,
  was spotted by Juggut Khan as he circled round the city on his charger at
  dusk on the day following their arrival. He brought his charger back to where
  the others lay concealed, and then went on an exploring-expedition on foot
  &mdash;to discover that the outer city wall was like a sponge, a nest of
  honey-combed cells and passages wandering interminably in the
  fifty-foot-thick brick and rubble rampart.</p>

  <p>And while he searched amid the mazy windings of the wall, Bill Brown sat
  in the forked top of a tree and studied out the ground-plan of the city. He
  was imprinting landmarks in his memory for future reference, and trying
  &mdash;with a brain that ached from the apparent hopelessness of the task
  &mdash;to figure out a plan.</p>

  <p>He knew by now that the four he had come to rescue were hidden underneath
  the powder-magazine, and he could see the magazine itself. But he could think
  of no way of rescuing them, for the city absolutely boiled with frantic,
  mixed-up castes and creeds picked at random, and thrown in at random from the
  whole of India. A mouse could not have passed through the streets undetected!
  And yet, from a soldier's point of view, there were certain fascinating
  details to be noticed about that powder-magazine. In the first place, it had
  been constructed for a granary by an emperor who never heard of Joseph, but
  who had the same ideal plan for cornering the people's food-supply. And since
  labor had been unlimited, and cheap, he had gone about building the thing on
  the most thoroughly unpractical and most pretentious plan that he and his
  architects could figure out. It was big enough to hold about ten times as
  much grain as the province could grow in any one year of plenty. And, since
  that was the least practical and most ungranary-like shape, he had caused it
  to be built like an enormous beehive, with a tiny platform at the top.</p>

  <p>Winding round and round the huge stone dome, and on the outside, was a
  six-foot-wide trail, which was the elevator. Up this, each with a sack or a
  basket on his head, the population was to have been induced to run in single
  file, dumping its hard-won corn into the granary through an opening at the
  top until the granary was full.</p>

  <p>The emperor died&mdash;by poison&mdash;before he could see his cherished
  project put into execution, but he had been a very thorough calculator, and a
  builder who believed in permanency. He had foreseen that when the granary was
  full, and the screw-jacks were turned beneath the cost of living, there would
  probably be efforts made by unwashed, untutored, unenlightened mobs to rape
  his storehouse. So he had made the little platform at the top a veritable
  fortress of a place, such as a handful of men could hold against a hundred
  thousand.</p>

  <p>There was no known entrance to the granary above ground, except on the
  ground level, where a huge stone gateway frowned above a teak-and-iron door.
  Above that door there were galleries, and fortalices and cunningly invented
  battlements in miniature, from behind whose shelter a resolute
  defending-party could pour out a hundred different kinds of death on a hungry
  crowd. The place was naturally fire-proof and naturally cool&mdash;as far as
  any building can be cool in Central India. It was a first-class, ideal
  powder-magazine, if useless as a granary; and the last new conquerors of
  India had hastened to adopt it as a means of storing up the explosive
  medicine with which they kept their foothold.</p>

  <p>Naturally, none but White soldiers, and a very few of the more trusted
  natives, had ever been allowed to go inside the powder-magazine. The secret
  passages beneath it had never been intended for public convenience or
  information. They had been designed as a means of rushing defenders secretly
  into the granary, and they connected with a tunnel underneath the palace that
  had just been burned. They also connected with the outer wall in such a way
  that defenders from the ramparts might be rushed there too, if wanted in a
  hurry. But, since there never had been corn kept in the granary, and nobody
  had ever had the slightest need to force an entrance, the knowledge even of
  the existence of the passages had become barely a memory, and there was not a
  man living in Jailpore who knew exactly where they began or where they ended.
  There was a man outside who knew, but none inside.</p>

  <p>The point about the powder-magazine which most appealed to Brown&mdash;
  next after his knowledge of its contents, mineral and human&mdash;was the
  fact that the little platform at its summit overlooked the city-wall, and
  that the side of the granary actually touched the wall on the side of the
  city farthest from where he sat and spied it out. Ten men on that protected
  platform, he thought, might suffer from the sun, but they could hold the
  building and command a good-sized section of the city ramparts against all
  comers.</p>

  <p>He noticed too, though that seemed immaterial at the time, that one well-
  aimed shot from heavy ordnance might crash through the upper dome and set off
  the powder underneath. There was no artillery that could be brought against
  the place, either with the British force or with the mutineers, but the
  thought set him to wondering how much powder there might be stored on the
  huge round floor below, and what would happen should it become ignited. It
  was a sanguinary, interesting, subtle kind of thought, that suited the
  condition of his brain exactly! He climbed down from the tree, feeling almost
  good-natured.</p>

  <p>At the bottom he met Juggut Khan, waiting for him patiently.</p>

  <p>"What have you seen, sahib?" he asked him. "Have you formed a plan?"</p>

  <p>"I've been wishing I was Joshua!" said Brown. "I'd like to make my men
  march round the city and blow trumpets, and then see the walls fall down. I
  can think of several things to do, if we could only get inside. But I can't
  think how to get there."</p>

  <p>"I have found a way in!" said Juggut Khan. "I have cross-questioned that
  fakir of ours as well, with a little assistance from a cleaning-rod wielded
  by one of your men. He knows the way too. He says he is the only man who
  knows it&mdash;in which he lies, since I too have discovered it. But his
  knowledge may help as well."</p>

  <p>"What's that about a cleaning-rod?" asked Brown.</p>

  <p>"It was used on him to help him forget his vow of silence."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"When you were up that tree, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Have you been giving my man orders?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"How did he come to beat the fakir, then?"</p>

  <p>"We both arrived at the same conclusion at the same moment, and the fakir
  received the benefit!"</p>

  <p>"Who held him, you?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib! God forbid! I am a clean man. I listened to his conversation.
  The Beluchi held him."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Well, I like you well enough, Juggut Khan, but there are things about
  you that I don't like. You're too fond of doing things on your own
  responsibility, and you're much too fond of using oaths. Y our soul is none
  o' my business; you're a heathen anyhow, and no longer in the Service. But,
  I'll trouble you not to use those disgraceful oaths of yours in the presence
  of the men! Do you understand me?"</p>

  <p>"I understand you, sahib. If my respect for all your other qualities were
  not so profound, I would laugh at you! As it is, if your honor should see fit
  to turn the bullocks loose, and tie the fakir fast between two men and follow
  me, it seems to me dark enough by now, and I know the way. Might I
  furthermore suggest that the ammunition-box would make a reasonable load for
  another two men?"</p>

  <p>"Hadn't we better bring our rifles too?" asked Brown sarcastically. "Upon
  my honor, Juggut Khan! You're getting childish! Are your nerves upset, or
  what? Lead on, man! Lead on!"</p>

  <p>"Listen. There are two ways, sahib. One way leads from the burned-out
  barracks to the cellar where the women lie hidden. That way is closed by
  debris. The other way leads from the outer wall by a very winding route to
  the cellar where the women are. The fakir knows that way, and I do not,
  though I know of it. There is a third way, though, that leads from the outer
  wall, where I have been exploring, straight almost, if you disregard a wind
  or two, to the inside of the powder-magazine. It enters the magazine through
  a doorway secretly contrived in an upright pillar&mdash;or so the fakir
  swears. Now this is my notion, sahib. If we go in by the lower way, we must
  come out that way, and run the risk of being caught as we emerge. That risk
  will be greatly enhanced when we have frightened women with us whose eyes
  have been blinded by the darkness. But, if we go in by the upper way, and
  enter the magazine itself, I can make the fakir show us how to lift the stone
  trapdoor I spoke of&mdash;the one that I closed when I hid the women. Then I
  can ascend with him, and with say four men, while you ascend to the platform
  at the top with the remainder of the men, and guard our rear and our exit.
  From the top, you will be able to see us as we emerge, and can cover our
  retreat, and follow."</p>

  <p>"That sounds like a roundabout sort of plan to me!" said Brown. "Why not
  go straight in by the lower route, and gather up the women, and carry 'em
  out, and make a bolt for it?"</p>

  <p>"Because, sahib, we will be at the fakir's mercy."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! He's at our mercy."</p>

  <p>"Think, sahib! There, he will be in his own bat's nest, so to speak. These
  fakirs are the only men who know the windings of all the secret passages.
  They are the rats of religion and intrigue. At any step he might lead us into
  an ambush, and we might be overwhelmed before we knew that we were attacked.
  If we go the other way, though, I can lead the way myself, and we need only
  take the fakir to show us how to open the door."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Brown. "Let's get a move on, though! I'm beginning to
  think that you're a better talker than a fighter, Juggut Khan!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib? I trust there will be no fighting!" But the Rajput smiled as
  he said it, and thought of a certain lance-shaft which had been broken in the
  streets of Jailpore.</p>

  <p>"Lead on! Fall in behind me, men! Walk quietly, now, and remember. Hold
  your tongues! Each man keep his eye on me, and a finger on the trigger!"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi and the fakir and Juggut Khan moved in the van, with two men
  to hold the fakir. Next marched, or rather tiptoed, Sergeant Brown, followed
  by the other men in single file. In that order they hastened after Juggut
  Khan, through the darkness, across a dried-out moat and round the corner of a
  huge stone buttress. There they disappeared inside the wall, and a stone
  swung round and closed the gap behind the last of them. There was no alarm
  given, and not a sign or a sound of any kind to betoken that any one had seen
  them. Inside the walls the city roared like a flood-fed maelstrom, and
  outside all was darkness and the silence of the dead.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">CHAPTER 13</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was some smart work done inside the powder-magazine.
  To be able to appreciate it properly one would be obliged to do what they
  did&mdash; wander through a maze of tunnels in a city-wall, blinded by
  darkness, oppressed by the stored-up stuffiness and heat of ages and deafened
  by the stillness&mdash;then emerge unexpectedly in the lamp-lit magazine,
  among mutineers who sprawled, and laughed; and chewed betel-nut at their ease
  upon the powder-kegs.</p>

  <p>Both sides were taken by surprise, but the mutineers had the nominal
  advantage, for their eyes were accustomed to the light. They had the
  advantage in numbers, too, by almost two to one. But they dared not fire, for
  fear of setting off the magazine, whereas Brown and his little force dared
  anything. They fully expected to die, and might as well die that way as any
  other. And a quick death for the women down below would be better than
  anything the rebels had in store for them. Brown yelled an order, and the
  rest was too quick, nearly, for the eye to follow.</p>

  <p>Three rebels died with bullets in them, and the rest stampeded for the
  teak-and-metal door, to find it locked on them, and Brown and the Rajput
  standing in front of it on guard. The mutineers attacked fiercely. They flung
  themselves all together on the two. But they had yet to learn that they were
  tackling, or endeavoring to tackle, the two finest swordsmen in that part of
  India. And when they turned, to find more room to fight in, or to draw their
  breath, they had to face nine bayonets that hemmed them in, and drove them
  closer and even closer to the swords again. They shouted, but no sound could
  pierce the walls or escape through that tremendous door. Even the sound of
  firing merely echoed upward until it reached the dome, and then filtered out
  and upward through the opening above. They might as well have shouted to
  their friends in Bholat!</p>

  <p>For ten minutes, perhaps, the battle surged and swayed on the stone floor
  first one side rushing, then the other. But man after man of the mutineers
  went down&mdash;appalled by the amazing swordsmanship, disheartened by the
  grim determination of their adversaries, bewildered to feebleness by the
  suddenness of the attack.</p>

  <p>Soon there were but eight of them facing the blood-wet steel, and then
  Brown shouted for a fresh formation, swung his contingent into line and led
  them with a rush across the floor that swept the remaining mutineers off
  their feet.</p>

  <p>Three more went down with steel through them, and then the rest
  surrendered, throwing down their arms, and begging mercy. Brown made a bundle
  of their arms, stowed it in a corner and made the prisoners stand together in
  a bunch, while he searched them thoroughly.</p>

  <p>"If we can't get that trapdoor open now, with these to help us," he
  remarked, panting and wiping the dotted blood off his sword on a Hindu
  prisoner's trousers, "it'll be a heavier proposition than I think!"</p>

  <p>"There's a trick to it," said Juggut Khan, panting too, for the battle had
  been fierce and furious while it lasted. "The fakir knows the trick. It is
  heavy, in any case. But, if we make him tell us, we can manage it."</p>

  <p>There followed delay while the fakir was induced to forego the pleasure of
  a sulking fit. He seemed like a child, anxious to emphasize their dependence
  on his knowledge, and needing to be recompelled to each new thing they needed
  of him. He was perfectly content, though, to surrender when he felt the
  weight of a cleaning-rod on his anatomy, or something in the way of fire
  &mdash;a match or cigarette for instance&mdash;placed where he would get the
  most sensation from it.</p>

  <p>Then followed more delay, while they rigged a lever of sorts, and a rope
  through an iron ring in the trap, and while Juggut Khan hunted for the secret
  catch that the fakir swore was hidden underneath a smaller stone that hinged
  in the middle of the floor. He found it at last, moved it and came across to
  lend a hand with the lever and the rope.</p>

  <p>The fakir sat still and smiled at them. His eyes gleamed more horridly
  than ever, and his withered arm seemed more than ever to be calling down dire
  vengeance on them.</p>

  <p>"I believe that monster is up to tricks of some kind!" swore Brown.</p>

  <p>"He can't do anything," said Juggut Khan. "If we were all to put our
  weight against this, all together, we and the prisoners, sahib, we could get
  it open in a second."</p>

  <p>"All together, then!" said Brown. "Come on, there! Lend a hand!"</p>

  <p>The prisoners and Brown's men and Juggut Khan and the Beluchi bent their
  backs above the lever, or hauled taut on the rope, and the fakir wriggled
  with some secret joke.</p>

  <p>"At the word three!" said Brown. "Then all together!"</p>

  <p>"One!"</p>

  <p>"Two!"</p>

  <p>The fakir writhed delightedly. He seemed more than ever like a wickedly
  malicious child.</p>

  <p>"Three!"</p>

  <p>They strained their utmost, and the huge stone trap gave way with a sudden
  jerk.</p>

  <p>"For the love of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They all jumped, but they were strained in the wrong position for a quick
  recovery, and the ten-ton rock rolled back on unseen hinges to crush them
  all, and rolled back and yet farther back&mdash;and then stayed! Brown had
  snatched a rifle, and had placed it between the rolling rock and the
  wall!</p>

  <p>He stood wiping the sweat from his forehead, while the rest recovered
  their lost balance and walked out from behind unscathed. The rifle creaked
  and bent and split. Then the stone leaned farther back, reached the wall and
  stayed there!</p>

  <p>"A near thing that!" said Brown. "That fakir's a bright beauty, isn't
  he!"</p>

  <p>"Shall I kick him, sir?" asked one of Brown's men.</p>

  <p>"Kick him? No! What good'd that do? What next, Juggut Khan?"</p>

  <p>But Juggut Khan was bending down, and listening at the hole laid bare by
  the huge hinged trap.</p>

  <p>"Silence!" commanded Brown.</p>

  <p>The men held their breath, even, but not a sound came up from the darkness
  down below.</p>

  <p>"Are they dead, d'you suppose?" asked Brown.</p>

  <p>And, even as he asked it, some one in the darkness snuffled, and he heard
  a woman's voice that moaned.</p>

  <p>"Snff-snff-snff! I wonder if I'm dead yet! I wouldn't be, I know, if Bill
  were here! He'd ha' got us out!"</p>

  <p>"There is one of them alive!" said Juggut Khan.</p>

  <p>"So I notice!" answered Brown, with a strange dry quaver in his voice. "Go
  down and bring her up, please! Take three or four men with you. It won't do
  to bring women and a child up here and let 'em see this awful fakir and these
  corpses. Take your time about bringing 'em up, while I make the prisoners
  carry their dead up on to the roof. I'll take the fakir up there too where
  he's out of mischief!"</p>

  <p>Just as a six-foot-wide pathway ran round and round the outside of the
  dome, another one, scarcely more than a yard wide, ran round the inside, and
  formed a roadway to the top in place of a stair. It took the prisoners and
  Brown's men fifteen minutes of continuous effort to carry up the dead and the
  fakir, and lay them on the roof.</p>

  <p>"Pitch the dead over!" ordered Brown, and the mutineers obeyed.</p>

  <p>"I've a mind to pitch you over too!" he growled at the fakir, and the
  strange creature seemed to understand him, for his eyes changed from their
  baleful hatred to a look of fear.</p>

  <p>The bodies slid and rolled down the rounded roof, and fell with a thud
  against the battlements, or else went rolling down the circular causeway that
  led to the street below.</p>

  <p>Brown seemed to be garnering ideas from watching them. He gazed down at
  the noisy tumult of the city, watching for a while the efforts of an ill-
  directed crowd to put out a fire that blazed in a distant quarter of the
  bazaar.</p>

  <p>There seemed to him something strangely preconcerted about much of the
  hurrying to and fro below him. It struck him as being far too orderly to be
  the mere boiling of a loot-crazed mob.</p>

  <p>His prisoners gave the secret to him. They were leaning against the
  parapet on the other side&mdash;the side closest to the city-wall, and
  farthest from the top of the causeway&mdash;and they were chattering together
  excitedly in undertones. Brown walked round to where they stood, and stared
  where they stared. Just as they had done, he recognized what lay below
  him.</p>

  <p>It was faintly outlined in the blackness, picked out here and there by
  lanterns, and still too far away for most civilians to name it until the sun
  rose and showed its detail. But Brown, the soldier, knew on the instant, and
  so did his men.</p>

  <p>Suddenly and unexpectedly and sweetly, like a voice in the night that
  spoke of hope and strength and the rebirth of order out of chaos, a bugle
  gave tongue from where the lanterns swung in straight-kept lines.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Juggut Khan! Oh, Juggut Khan!"</p>

  <p>Bill Brown's voice boomed through the opening in the dome, and spread down
  the walls of the powder-magazine as though in the inside of a speaking-
  trumpet.</p>

  <p>"Brown sahib?"</p>

  <p>"The army has got here from the north! It has come down here from
  Harumpore! It's outside the walls now, lying on its arms, and evidently
  waiting to attack at daylight!"</p>

  <p>"I, too, have news, Brown sahib! All four are living! All four lie here on
  the floor of the magazine, and they recover rapidly. They are all but strong
  enough to stand."</p>

  <p>"Good! Then come up here, Juggut Khan!"</p>

  <p>That winding pathway up the inside of the dome took longer to negotiate
  than an ordinary stairway would have done, but presently the Rajput leaned
  against the parapet and panted beside Brown.</p>

  <p>"D'you see them? There they are! Now, look on this side! D'you see the
  preparations going on? D'you realize what the next thing's going to be?
  They'll come for powder for the guns, so's to have it all ready for the
  gun-crews when the fun begins at dawn! Listen! Here they are already!"</p>

  <p>A thundering had started on the great teak door below&mdash;a thundering
  that echoed through the dome like the reverberations of an earthquake. It was
  punctuated by the screams of women. The prisoners changed their attitude, and
  eyed Brown and the Rajput with an air of truculence again.</p>

  <p>"They'll be up this causeway in a minute, sahib! Listen. There! They've
  seen the dead bodies that you tossed over. Better it had been to keep them up
  here for a while."</p>

  <p>"Never mind! We can hold this causeway until morning! Men! Take close
  order. Line up at the causeway-entrance. Kneel. Prepare for volley-firing.
  Now, let 'em come!"</p>

  <p>"I am for making an immediate escape, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Go ahead!" said Brown, almost dreamily.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be thinking hard on some other subject as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, one of the women there&mdash;she who is maid to the other two
  &mdash;asked me where Bill Brown might be! She swore to me that she had
  recognized his voice when the trapdoor opened up above her. Are you not Bill
  Brown?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm William Brown!"</p>

  <p>"Her name, she says, is Emmett!"</p>

  <p>"You don't surprise me, Juggut Khan! I thought I had recognized her voice.
  It seemed strangely familiar. Well&mdash;here come the rebels up the
  causeway. See? They're at the bottom now with lanterns! Ready, men!"</p>

  <p>There came the answering click of breech-bolts, and a little rustling as
  each man eased his position, and laid his elbow on his knee.</p>

  <p>"Can you find your way out through the way we came, Juggut Khan?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I can!"</p>

  <p>"Are all the women on the floor?"</p>

  <p>"Three women and the child."</p>

  <p>"Can you close the trap-door again?"</p>

  <p>"Surely! It is only opening it that is difficult."</p>

  <p>"Then close it before you go. I've got a reason! Send one of my men up
  here with a lantern&mdash;one of those that are burning in the magazine. I
  want to signal."</p>

  <p>"Very well, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Then take the women, with four of my men to help them walk, and get out
  as quickly as you can by the way we all came in. Wait for the rest of my men
  when you reach the opening in the outer wall, and when they reach you allot
  two men to carry each woman, and run&mdash;the whole lot of you&mdash;for the
  army over yonder. One of the women will object. She will want to see me
  first. Use force, if necessary!"</p>

  <p>"Are you, then, not coming, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"I have another plan. Here they come! Hurry now, be off with the women!
  Volley-firing&mdash;ready&mdash;present!"</p>

  <p>Pattering footsteps sounded on the causeway, and a little crowd of nearly
  doubled figures came up it at a run.</p>

  <p>"Fire!"</p>

  <p>The volley took the rebels absolutely by surprise, and no man could miss
  his mark at that short range. Five of the rebels fell back headlong, and the
  rest, who followed up the causeway, turned on their heels and ran.</p>

  <p>"'Bout turn!" Brown shouted suddenly. "Use the steel, men! Use the
  steel!"</p>

  <p>His own sword was flashing, and lunging as he spoke, and he had already
  checked a sudden rush by the prisoners.</p>

  <p>They had thought the moment favorable for joining in the scrimmage from
  the rear.</p>

  <p>"All right! That'll do them! I'll attend to 'em now!"</p>

  <p>A man came running up with the lantern Brown had asked for, and Brown took
  it and began waving it above his head.</p>

  <p>"They must have heard that volley!" he muttered to himself. "Ah! There's
  the answer!"</p>

  <p>A red light began to dance over in the British camp, moving up and down
  and sidewise in sudden little jerks. Brown read the jerks, as he could never
  have read writing, and a moment later he answered them.</p>

  <p>"Now, down below, the lot of you! Give me your rifle, you. I'll need
  it."</p>

  <p>"Not coming, sir."</p>

  <p>"Not yet. There's something else yet, and I can do it best. Besides, some
  one has got to guard the causeway still. There might be a rush again at any
  minute. Listen now. Obey Juggut Khan implicitly as soon as you get down. His
  orders are my orders. Understand? Very well, then. And you without a weapon,
  your job is to shut the door that you leave the magazine by tight from the
  outside&mdash;d'you understand me? Call up when you're all through the door,
  and then shut it tight!"</p>

  <p>"But, how'll you get out, sir?"</p>

  <p>"That's my business. One minute, though. Here they come again. Get ready
  to fire another volley!"</p>

  <p>The mutineers made another and a more determined rush up the causeway,
  coming up it more than twenty strong, and at the double. Brown let one volley
  loose in the midst of them, then led his men at the charge down on them and
  drove them over the edge of the causeway by dint of sheer impact and cold
  steel. Not one of them reached the ground alive, and in the darkness it must
  have been impossible for the mutineers below to divine how many were the
  granary's defenders.</p>

  <p>"That'll keep 'em quiet for a while, I'll wager! Now, quick, you men! Get
  down below, and follow Juggut Khan, and don't forget to shut the door tight
  on you. These prisoners here are going to follow you&mdash;they may as well
  go down with you for that matter. No! that won't do. They could open the door
  below, couldn't they? They'll have to stay up here. Got any rope? Then bind
  them, somebody. Bind their hands and feet. Now, off with you!"</p>

  <p>Brown spent the next few minutes signaling with the lantern, and reading
  answering flashes that zig-zagged in the velvet blackness of the British
  lines. Then, as a voice boomed up through the granary, "All's well, sir! I'm
  just about to shut the door!" he fixed his eyes on the fakir, and laughed at
  him.</p>

  <p>"You and I are going to turn in our accounts of how we've worked out this
  'Hookum hai' business, my friend!" he told him. "You've given orders, and
  I've obeyed orders! We've both accounted for a death or two, and we've both
  accepted responsibility. We're going to know in less than five minutes from
  now which of us two was justified. There's one thing I know, though, without
  asking. There's one person, and she a woman, who'll weep for me. Will anybody
  weep for you, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>A lantern waved wildly from the British camp, and Brown seized his own
  lantern and signaled an answer.</p>

  <p>"See that? That's to say, you glassy-eyed horror you, that our mutual
  friend Juggut Khan has been seen emerging like a rat from a hole in the wall.
  I'll give him and his party one more minute to get clear. Then there's going
  to be a holocaust, my friend!"</p>

  <p>He cocked his rifle, and examined the breech-bolt and the foresight
  carefully. The fakir shuddered, evidently thinking that the charge was
  intended for himself.</p>

  <p>"No! It won't be that way. I know a better! I'm taking a leaf from your
  book and doing harm by wholesale!"</p>

  <p>Brown leaned down into the opening of the dome, and brought the rifle to
  his shoulder. There was a chorus of yells from the prisoners, and a noise
  like a wounded horse's scream from the fakir. The rest were bound, but the
  fakir rose and writhed toward him on his heels, with his sound arm stretched
  up in an attitude of despair beside the withered one.</p>

  <p>A chorus of bugles burst out from the British camp, and a volley ripped
  through the blackness.</p>

  <p>"All right! Here goes!" said Brown. And he aimed down into the shadowy
  powder-magazine, and pulled the trigger.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later, an army three thousand and five hundred strong marched
  in through the gap made in the outer wall by a granary that had spread itself
  through&mdash;and not over&mdash;what was in its way. There were seventeen
  tons of powder that responded to the invitation of Brown's bullet.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14">CHAPTER 14</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Explosions are among the few things&mdash;or the many
  things, whichever way you like to look at it!&mdash;that science can not
  undertake to harness or account for. When a gun blows up, or a
  powder-magazine, the shock kills whom it kills, as when a shell bursts in a
  dense-packed firing-line. You can not kill any man before his time comes,
  even if a thousand tons of solid masonry combine with you to whelm him, and
  go hurtling through the air with him to absolutely obvious destruction.</p>

  <p>The fakir's time had come, and the prisoners' time had come. But Sergeant
  William Brown's had not.</p>

  <p>They found him, blackened by powder, and with every stitch of clothing
  blown from him, clinging to a bunch of lotus-stems in a temple-pond. There
  was a piece of fakir in the water with him, and about a ton of broken
  granary, besides the remnants of a rifle and other proof that he had come
  belched out of a holocaust. The men who came on him had given their officer
  the slip, and were bent on a private looting-expedition of their own. But by
  the time that they had dragged him from the water, and he had looted them of
  wherewithal to clothe himself, their thoughts of plunder had departed from
  them. Brown had a way of quite monopolizing people's thoughts!</p>

  <p>There were twenty of them, and he led them all that night, and all through
  the morning and the afternoon that followed. He held them together and worked
  them and wheeled them and coached and cheered and compelled them through the
  hell-tumult of the ghastliest thing there is beneath the dome of heaven
  &mdash;house-to-house fighting in an Eastern city. And at the end of it, when
  the bugles blew at last "Cease fire," and many of the men were marched away
  by companies to put out the conflagrations that were blazing here and there,
  he led them outside the city-wall, stood them at ease in their own line and
  saluted their commanding-officer.</p>

  <p>"Twenty men of yours, sir. Present and correct."</p>

  <p>"Which twenty?"</p>

  <p>"Of Mr. Blair's half-company."</p>

  <p>"Where's Mr. Blair?"</p>

  <p>"Dunno, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Since when have you had charge of them?"</p>

  <p>"Since they broke into the city yesterday, sir."</p>

  <p>"And you haven't lost a man?"</p>

  <p>"Had lots of luck, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Who are you, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"I'm Sergeant Brown, sir."</p>

  <p>"Of the Rifles?"</p>

  <p>"Of the Rifles, sir."</p>

  <p>"Were you the man who signaled to us from the magazine and blew it up and
  made the breach in the wall for us to enter by?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Are you alive, or dead? Man or ghost?"</p>

  <p>"I'm pretty much alive, sir, thank you!"</p>

  <p>"D'you realize that you made the taking of Jailpore possible? That but for
  you we'd have been trying still to storm the walls without artillery?"</p>

  <p>"I had the chance, sir, and I only did what any other man would ha' done
  under like circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Go and tell that to the Horse Marines&mdash;or, rather, tell it to
  Colonel Kendrick! Go and report to him at once. Possibly he'll see it through
  your eyes!"</p>

  <p>So Brown marched off to report himself, and he found Colonel Kendrick
  nursing a badly wounded arm before a torn and mud-stained tent.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" said the colonel, as Brown saluted him.</p>

  <p>"I'm Sergeant Brown, sir."</p>

  <p>"Not Bill Brown of the Rifles?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

  <p>"You lie! He was blown up on the roof of the powder-magazine! I suppose
  every man who's gone mad from the heat will be saying that he's Brown!"</p>

  <p>"I'm Brown, sir! I had written orders from General Baines to enter
  Jailpore and rescue three women and a child."</p>

  <p>"Where are your orders?"</p>

  <p>"Lost 'em, sir, in the explosion."</p>

  <p>"For a madman, you're a circumstantial liar! What happened to the
  women?"</p>

  <p>The colonel sat back, and smothered an exclamation of agony as the nerves
  in his injured arm tortured him afresh. He had asked a question which should
  settle once and for all this man's pretentions, and he waited for the answer
  with an air of certainty. It was on his lips to call the guard to take the
  lunatic away.</p>

  <p>"Juggut Khan, the Rajput, took them, with nine of my men, and brought them
  in to your camp last night, sir. I naturally haven't seen them since."</p>

  <p>"Will the women know you?"</p>

  <p>"One of them will, sir."</p>

  <p>"Which one?"</p>

  <p>"Jane Emmett, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll see!"</p>

  <p>The colonel called an orderly, and sent the orderly running for Jane
  Emmett. A minute later two strong arms were thrown round Bill Brown from
  behind, and he was all but carried off his feet.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bill&mdash;Bill&mdash;Bill! I knew you'd be all right! Turn round,
  Bill! Look at me!"</p>

  <p>She was clinging to him in such a manner that he could not turn, but he
  managed to pry her hands loose, and to draw her round in front of him.</p>

  <p>"I knew, Bill! I felt sure you'd come! And I recognized your voice the
  minute that the trapdoor opened and I heard it! I did, Bill! I knew you in a
  minute! I didn't worry then! I knew you wouldn't come and talk to me as long
  as there was any duty to be done. I just waited! They said you were killed in
  the explosion, but I knew you weren't! I knew it! I did! I knew it!"</p>

  <p>"Face me, please!" said Colonel Kendrick. "Now, Jane Emmett, is that man
  Sergeant William Brown, of the Rifles?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Is he the man who entered Jailpore with nine men and a Rajput, and came
  to your assistance?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir! He's the same man who spoke in the powder-magazine;" '</p>

  <p>"Do you confirm that?" he asked Brown.</p>

  <p>"Under favor, sir, my men must be somewhere, if they're not all killed.
  They'll recognize me. And there's the other lot I led all last night and all
  today. They'll tell you where they found me!"</p>

  <p>"Never mind! I've decided I believe you! D'you realize that you're
  something of a marvel?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;except that I've had marvelous luck!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I shall take great pleasure in mentioning your name in despatches.
  It will go direct, at first hand, to Her Majesty the Queen! There are few
  men, let me tell you, Sergeant Brown, who would dare what you dared in the
  first place. But, more than that, there are even fewer men who would leave a
  sweetheart in some one else's care while they blew up a powder-magazine with
  themselves on top of it, in order to make a breach for the army to come in
  by! My right hand's out of action unfortunately&mdash;you'll have to shake my
  left!"</p>

  <p>The colonel rose, held his uninjured hand out and Brown shook it, since he
  was ordered to.</p>

  <p>"I consider it an honor and a privilege to have shaken hands with you,
  Sergeant Brown!" said Colonel Kendrick.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir!" said Brown, taking one step back, and then saluting.
  "May I join my regiment, sir?"</p>

  <p>He joined his regiment, when he had helped to sort out the bleeding
  remnants of it from among the by-ways and back alleys of Jailpore. And the
  chaplain married him and Jane Emmett out of hand. He sent her off at once
  with her former mistress to the coast, and marched off with his regiment to
  Delphi. And at Delphi his name was once more mentioned in despatches.</p>

  <p>When the Mutiny was over, and the country had settled down again to peace
  and reincarnation of a nation had begun, Brown found himself hoisted to a
  civil appointment that was greater and more highly paid than anything his
  modest soul had ever dreamed of.</p>

  <p>He never understood the reason for it, although he did his fighting-best
  consistently to fill the job; and he never understood why Queen Victoria
  should have taken the trouble to write a letter to him in which she thanked
  him personally, nor why they should have singled out for praise and special
  notice a fellow who had merely done his duty.</p>

  <p>Perhaps that was the reason why he was such a conspicuous success in civil
  life. They still talk of how Bill Brown, with Jane his wife and Juggut Khan
  the Rajput to advise him, was Resident Political Adviser to a Maharajah, and
  of how the Maharajah loathed him, and looked sidewise at him&mdash;but
  obeyed. That, though, is not a war-story. It is a story of the saving of a
  war, and shall go on record, some day, beneath a title of its own.</p>
