  <p class="poem"
     style="margin-left:10%">Tides in the ocean of stars and the infinite
     rhythm of space;<br>
  Cycles on cycles of aeons adrone on an infinite beach;<br>
  Pause and recession and flow, and each atom of dust in its place<br>
  In the pulse of eternal becoming: no error, no breach,<br>
  But the calm and the sweep and swing of the leisurely, measureless roll<br>
  Of the absolute cause, the unthwarted effect &mdash; and no haste,<br>
  Neither discord, and nothing untimed in a calculus ruling the whole;<br>
  Unfolding, evolving; accretion, attrition; no waste.<br>
  Planet on planet a course that it keeps, and each swallow its flight;<br>
  Comet's ellipse and grace-note of the sudden fire-fly glow;<br>
  Jewels of Perseid splendor sprayed on summer's purple night;<br>
  Blossom adrift on the breath of spring; the whirl of snow;<br>
  Grit on the grinding beaches; spume of the storm-ridden wave<br>
  Cast on the blast of the north wind to blend with the tropic rain;<br>
  Hail and the hissing of torrents; song where sapphire ripples lave
  &mdash;<br>
  Long lullabies to coral reefs unguessed in a sleepy main.<br>
  Silt of the ceaseless rivers from the mountain summits worn,<br>
  Rolled amid league-long meadows till the salt, inflowing tide<br>
  Heaps it in shoals at harbor-mouth for continents unborn;<br>
  Earth where the naked rocks were reared; pine where the birches died;<br>
  Season on season proceeding, and birth in the shadow of death;<br>
  Dawning of luminous day in the dying night; and a Plan<br>
  In no wit, in no particle changing; each phase of becoming, a breath<br>
  Of the infinite karma of all things; its goal, evolution of Man.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref02">A Nemesis</a><br>
  <small>First published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, September
  1923</small></h2>

  <p class="poem">What little wrong we do, and bury, lies<br>
  No deeper than the wire-grass spaded o'er<br>
  That under the smooth surface multiplies<br>
  And, ten times thriftier than before,<br>
  Crowds upward in the fertilizing rain.<br>
  No virtue lies in long forgetfulness.<br>
  The deed ill-done lives to be done again<br>
  Or undone, or to rise anew and dress<br>
  New difficulties in the graveyard hues<br>
  Of habit and accusing dread &mdash;<br>
  A nemesis &mdash; a phantom that pursues &mdash;<br>
  A foe to fight again, and courage dead.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref03">Unsung As Yet</a><br>
  <small>First published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, November
  1923</small></h2>

  <p class="poem">I set my foot on the forest floor<br>
  Where all is cool and all is still,<br>
  And I will turn back nevermore<br>
  To the haunts I knew. I had my fill<br>
  Lived, handled, tasted all they prize,<br>
  Took, coveted, considered, weighed,<br>
  And I know all the honored lies<br>
  I, too, had honored had I stayed.<br>
  I learned the song of the God for hire,<br>
  Of boughten islands for the blest,<br>
  In gloom 'neath dome and gilded spire<br>
  Hymned to the roof. My way is best.<br>
  <br>
  For the skies are mine, and the wind is mine,<br>
  And down between the breathing trees<br>
  Immeasurable beacons shine<br>
  A-twinkle in the silences.<br>
  All night is full of the friendly speech<br>
  Of leaf and earth and flowing stream;<br>
  Day's wide with league and span and reach<br>
  Of leisured distances a-dream<br>
  Of trails as new as years are long,<br>
  Flung across plain and sky-line crest<br>
  Unlonely solitude and song<br>
  Unsung as yet. My way is best<br>
  <br>
  I know where the future's freedom's bred,<br>
  Where all things wait on him who loves,<br>
  And underfoot, and overhead,<br>
  And all around, the homing droves<br>
  Of ripples from the storied past<br>
  Uplift until the pilgrims scan<br>
  New realms of thought and, thinking, cast<br>
  New efforts forth for visioned Man.<br>
  I feel the sweetness and the thrill -<br>
  The summons-forth on Royal Quest,<br>
  Harped chords of harmony that fill<br>
  A Universe. My way is best.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref04">Understanding</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>He who would understand the Plains must ascend the Eternal Hills, where a
  man's eyes scan Infinity. But he who would make use of understanding must
  descend on to the Plains, where Past and Future meet and men have need of
  him.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref05">The Day And Night Of Brahma</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; Deciphered from a palm-leaf manuscript discovered in a cave in
  Hindustan</small></h2>

  <p>Those who are acquainted with the day and night know that the Day of
  Brahma is a thousand revolutions of the Yugas, and that the Night extendeth
  for a thousand more. Now the Maha-Yuga consisteth of four parts, of which the
  last, being called the Kali-Yuga, is the least, having but
  four-hundred-and-thirty-two thousand years. The length of a Maya-Yuga is four
  million three-hundred-and-twenty thousand years; that is, one thousandth part
  of a Day of Brahma. And man was in the beginning, although not as he is now,
  nor as he will be ... [<i>Here the palmleaf is broken and illegible</i>] ...
  There were races in the world, whose wise-men knew all the seven principles,
  so that they understood matter in all its forms and were its masters. They
  were those to whom gold was as nothing, because they could make it, and for
  whom the elements brought forth ... [<i>Here there is another break</i>] ...
  And there were giants on the earth in those days, and there were dwarfs, most
  evil. There was war, and they destroyed ... [<i>Here the leaf is broken off,
  and all the rest is missing.</i>]</p>

  <h2><a id="ref06">The Essence Of Perversity</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>We should ascend out of perversity, even as we ascend a mountain that we
  do not know, with the aid of guides who do know. None who sets forth on an
  unknown voyage stipulates that the pilot must agree with him as to the
  course, since manifestly that would be absurd; the pilot is presumed to know;
  the piloted does not know. None who climbs a mountain bargains that the guide
  shall keep to this or that direction; it is the business of the guide to
  lead. And yet, men hire guides for the Spiritual Journey, of which they know
  less than they know of land and sea, and stipulate that the guide shall lead
  them thus and so, according to their own imaginings; and instead of obeying
  him, they desert and denounce him should he lead them otherwise. I find this
  of the essence of perversity.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref07">The Middle Way</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>He who puts his hand into the fire knows what he may expect.<br>
  Nor may the fire be blamed.<br>
  <br>
  He who intrudes on a neighbor may receive what he does not expect.<br>
  Nor may the neighbor be blamed.<br>
  <br>
  The fire will not be harmed; but the neighbor may be.<br>
  And every deed of every kind bears corresponding consequences to the
  doer.<br>
  <br>
  You may spend a thousand lives repaying wrong done to a neighbor.<br>
  Therefore, of the two indiscretions prefer thrusting your own hand into the
  fire.<br>
  <br>
  But there is a Middle Way, which avoids all trespassing.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref08">Cash And Credit</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>A certain poet, who was no fool, bade men take the cash and let the credit
  go. I find this good advice, albeit difficult to follow. Nevertheless, it is
  easier than what most men attempt. They seek to take the cash and let the
  debit go, and that is utterly impossible; for as we sow, we reap.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref09">Self-Preferment</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>It is the teaching of financiers and statesmen, and of them who make laws,
  and of most religionists, that of all things a man should first seek safety
  &mdash; for his own skin &mdash; for his own money &mdash; for his own soul.
  Yet I find this teaching strange; because of all the dangers in the universe,
  the greatest lies in self-preferment.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref10">The Eternal Now</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>We live in the eternal Now, and it is Now that we create our destiny. It
  follows, that to grieve over the past is useless and to make plans for the
  future is a waste of time. There is only one ambition that is good, and that
  is: so to live Now that none may weary of life's emptiness and none may have
  to do the task we leave undone.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref11">The Play Of Life</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>When the actor, having thrown aside the costume and the wig, departs
  &mdash; is he a villain? Shall we take stones and murder him because for our
  amusement he enacted villainy?<br>
  <br>
  If he should act death in the play because decency demands that, do we
  therefore burn him afterward and curse his memory? And is his wife a
  widow?<br>
  <br>
  And is life not like the play? The gods who watch the drama know that
  somebody must play the villain's part, and somebody the pauper's. They reward
  men for the acting. He who acts a poor part well receives for his reward a
  more important part when his turn shall come to be born again into the
  world.<br>
  <br>
  He, therefore, who is wise plays pauper, king or villain with the gods in
  mind.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref12">Prostitution</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>Men agree that prostitution is an evil, and they who know more than I do
  have assured me this opinion is right. But there are many forms of
  prostitution, and it may be that among the least of them is that of women,
  bad though that is. I have seen men sell their souls more inexcusably than
  women sell their bodies &mdash; and with more disastrous consequences &mdash;
  to themselves and to the buyer.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref13">Silence</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>The most important thing is Silence. In the Silence Wisdom speaks, and
  they whose hearts are open understand her. The brave man is at the mercy of
  cowards, and the honest man at the mercy of thieves, unless he keep silence.
  But if he keep silence he is safe, because, they will fail to understand him;
  and then he may do them good without their knowing it, which is a source of
  true humor and contentment.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref14">Ignorance And Presumption</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>The man who knows he is ignorant is at no disadvantage if he permits a
  wise man to do the thinking; because the wise man knows that neither
  advantage to one or disadvantage to another comes at all within the scope of
  wisdom, and he will govern himself accordingly. But he who seeks to outwit
  wisdom adds to ignorance presumption; and that is a combination that the gods
  do not love.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref15">The Magic Incantation of San-Fun-Ho</a></h2>

  <p class="poem"
     style="margin-left:10%">Lords of evolving night and day!<br>
  Ye spirits of the spaceless dreams!<br>
  O Souls of the reflected hills<br>
  Embosomed in pellucid streams!<br>
  Magicians of the morning haze<br>
  Who weave anew the virgin veil<br>
  That dews the blush of waking days<br>
  With innocence! Ye Rishis*, hail!<br>
  I charge that whosoe'er may view<br>
  This talisman, shall greet the dawn<br>
  Degreed, arrayed and ranked anew<br>
  As he may wish to have been born!<br>
  Prevail desire! A day and night<br>
  Prevail ambition! Till they see<br>
  They can not set the world aright<br>
  By being what they crave to be!<br>
  Be time and space, and all save Karma&dagger; stilled!<br>
  Grant that each secret wish may be fulfilled!</p>

  whose ordinances are regarded as infallible and binding, and from whom the
  Brahmins are supposed to be descended. ]<br>

  <h2><a id="ref16">Teaching Truth</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>The ways of the gods are natural, the ways of men unnatural, and there is
  nothing supernatural, except this: that if a man does a useless thing, none
  reproves him; if he does a harmful thing, few seek to restrain him; but if he
  seeks to imitate the gods and to encourage others, all those in authority
  accuse him of corruption. So it is more dangerous to teach truth than to
  enter a powder magazine with a lighted torch.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref18">The Great Offense And The Great Merit</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>Treason, as between men, is considered worse than theft; for even thieves
  despise it. He who betrays his country is considered fit for death. But I
  tell you: he who betrays his own soul has no longer any link with honesty,
  and there is nothing sure concerning him, except that he will go from bad to
  worse. And evil grows little by little; he who is faithless in small things
  will ultimately lose all honor. Therefore, strive eternally to keep faith,
  not telling secrets nor inquiring uninvited into those of others; for the
  Great Offense is grounded on an infinite variety of little ones &mdash;
  exactly as Great Merit is the total of innumerable acts of self-control.</p>

  <p class="poem"
     style="margin-left:10%">O Ye who look to enter in through Discipline to
     Bliss,<br>
  Ye shall not stray from out the way, if ye remember this:<br>
  Ye shall not waste a weary hour, nor hope for Hope in vain,<br>
  If ye persist with will until self righteousness is slain.<br>
  <br>
  If through the mist of mortal eyes, deluded, ye discern<br>
  That ye are holier than these, ye have the whole to learn!<br>
  If ye are tied with tangled pride because ye learn the Law,<br>
  Know then, your purest thoughts deny the Truth ye never saw!<br>
  <br>
  If ye resent in discontent the searchlight of reproof,<br>
  In hooded pride ye stand aside, at sin's not Soul's behoof!<br>
  Each gain for self denies the Self that knows the self is vain.<br>
  Who crowns accomplishment with pride must build the whole again!<br>
  <br>
  But if, at each ascending step, more clearly ye perceive<br>
  That he must kill the lower will who would the world relieve<br>
  And they are last who would be first, their effort thrown away;<br>
  Be patient then, and persevere. Ye tread the Middle Way!</p>

  <h2><a id="ref20">Self-Reform</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>He who would reform the world must first reform himself; and that, if he
  do it honestly, will keep him so employed that he will have no time to
  criticize his neighbor. Nevertheless, his neighbor will be benefited &mdash;
  even as a man without a candle, who at last discerns another's light.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref21">True Virtue</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>He who is wise is careful not to seem too virtuous, lest they who dislike
  virtue should exert unceasing energy to demonstrate that he is viler than
  themselves. True virtue suffers from advertisement.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref22">Judgment</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>This much I know: that it is easy to cause offense and easy to give
  pleasure, but difficult to ignore all considerations except justice, and much
  more difficult to judge rightly whoever, ignoring both offense and pleasure,
  leaves the outcome of his actions to the Higher Law. Therefore, judge
  yourself alone, for that is difficult enough; and, depend on it, the Higher
  Law will judge you also.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref23">Diversion</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>Sooner or later we must learn all knowledge. It is therefore necessary to
  begin. And for a beginning much may be learned from this: that men in pain
  and men in anger are diverted from either sensation by a song &mdash; and
  very readily.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref24">The Charm Of The Lotus</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>The secret of the charm of the lotus is that none can say wherein its
  beauty lies; for some say this, and some say that, but all agree that it is
  beautiful. And so indeed it is with woman. Her influence is mystery; her
  power is concealment. For that which men have uncovered and explained,
  whether rightly or wrongly, they despise. But that which they discern,
  although its underlying essence is concealed from them, they wonder at and
  worship.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref25">Beware!</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang

  <p>If a vain man should value your virtue, beware! For he will steal it in
  the name of God, and he will sell your reputation in the market-place.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref26">Wisdom</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>My son, the wise, are few; for Wisdom very seldom pleases, so that they
  are few who seek her. Wisdom will compel whoever entertains her to avoid all
  selfishness and to escape from praise. But Wisdom seeks them who are worthy,
  discovering some here and there, unstupified and uncorrupted by the slime of
  cant, with whom thereafter it is a privilege to other men to tread the self-
  same earth, whether or not they know it.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref27">Vanity And Modesty</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>And this I know: that when the gods have use for us they blindfold us,
  because if we should see and comprehend the outcome we should grow so vain
  that not even the gods could preserve us from destruction.<br>
  <br>
  Vanity, self-righteousness and sin, these three are one, whose complements
  are meekness, self-will and indifference.<br>
  <br>
  Meekness is not modesty. Meekness is an insult to the Soul. But out of
  modesty comes wisdom, because in modesty the god's can find expression.<br>
  <br>
  The wise gods do not corrupt modesty with wealth or fame, but its reward is
  in well-doing and in a satisfying inner vision.</p>

  Where Beauty and the Muses and the Seven Reasons dwell,<br>
  And I saw Hope accoutered with a lantern and a horn<br>
  Whose clarion and rays reach the inner rings of hell.<br>
  Oh, I was in the storehouse of the jewels of the dew<br>
  And the laughter of the motion of the wind-blown grass,<br>
  The mystery of morning and its music, and the hue<br>
  Of the petals of the roses when the rain-clouds pass.<br>
  And so I know who Hope is and why she never sleeps,<br>
  And seven of the secrets that are jewels on her breast;<br>
  I stood within the silence of the Garden that she keeps,<br>
  Where flowers fill the footprints that her sandals pressed;<br>
  And I know the springs of laughter, for I trod the Middle Way,<br>
  Where sympathies are sign-posts and the merry Gods the Guides;<br>
  I have been where Hope is Ruler and evolving realms obey;<br>
  I know the Secret Nearness where the Ancient Wisdom hides.</p>

  <p>In this sense we are our brothers' keepers: that if we injure them we are
  responsible. Therefore, our duty is, so vigilantly to control ourselves that
  we may injure none; and for this there is no substitute; all other duties
  take a lower place and are dependent on it.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref33">Three Unanswered Questions</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>I have conversed with many Priests; and some were honest men, and some
  were not, but three things none of them could answer: if their God is
  all-wise, what does it matter if men are foolish? And if they can imagine and
  define their God, must he not be smaller than their own imaginations?
  Furthermore, if their God is omnipotent, why does he need priests and
  ritual?</p>

  <h2><a id="ref34">Priests</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang
  Samdup</i></small></h2>

  <p>And I have asked this of the priests, but though they answered with a
  multitude of words, their words were emptiness: If it is true that a priest
  can pacify and coax God, or by meditation can relieve another from the
  consequences of his own sin, why should any one be troubled and why do the
  priests not put an end for ever to all sin and suffering? If they can, and do
  not, they are criminals. If they can not, but pretend that they can, they are
  liars. Nevertheless, there is a middle judgment, and it seems to me that
  <b>some</b> of them may be mistaken.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref35">Man And His Deeds</a><br>
  <small>&mdash; from <i>The Book Of The Sayings Of Tsiang

  <p>A man is what he is. He starts from where he is. He may progress, or he
  may retrogress. All effort in his own behalf is dead weight in the scale
  against him. All effort in behalf of others is a profit to himself;
  notwithstanding which, unless he first improve himself he can do nothing
  except harm to others. There is no power in the universe, nor any form of
  intercession that can separate a cause from its effect, action from reaction,
  or a man from retribution for his deeds.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref36">Life And Death</a><br>
  <small>Tsiang Samdup addressing Cotswald Ommony in<br>
  Chapter 29 of <i>Om-The Secret Of Ahbor Valley</i>, 1924</small></h2>

  <p>"My son, we live as long as we are useful, and as long as it is good for
  us to live. Thereafter we die, which is another form of living, even as ice
  and water and rain and dew are the same thing in different aspects. When the
  appointed time comes, we return, as the rain returns, to the earth it has

  <h2><a id="ref37">The Proper Time</a><br>
  <small>Tsiang Samdup addressing Cotswald Ommony in<br>
  Chapter 31 of <i>Om-The Secret Of Ahbor Valley</i>, 1924</small></h2>

  <p>"My son, remember this: the highest motive is of no avail without
  proportion and a sense of fitness; because these are the life of wisdom. Time
  is a delusion. All is the eternal Now. But in a world in which all is
  delusion, of which time is a controlling element, there is a proper time for
  all things. We can not mount the camel that has passed us, nor the camel that
  has not yet come. Neither does the water that has gone by turn the
  mill-wheel. He who feels the force of destiny within him, waits, as birds
  wait for the sunrise &mdash; as the seed waits for the spring. It is not
  enough to do the right thing. If the full moon shines at midday, what does it
  accomplish? If the drum beats out of time, what happens to the symphony? To
  discern the right time, and to act precisely then, is as important as the
  knowledge how to act. But discernment does not come by reason of desire; it
  comes by observation of essential truths &mdash; as that the sun, the moon,
  the stars, the seasons and the tides keep their appointed path, and when they
  fail there is disaster. This is an appointed time. Mark well."</p>
