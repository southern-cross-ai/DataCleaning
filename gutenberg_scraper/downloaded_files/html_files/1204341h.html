  <h3>TO DUNCAN GRANT WARRAND</h3>

  <p class="intro"><span class="smcap">My Dear Duncan</span>:</p>

  <p class="intro">To you, the well-read historian, there is little need to say
  that every event in this tale is not recorded for gospel. It is the story of
  the bleak side of the Forty-five, of goodness without wisdom, of wisdom first
  cousin to vice, of those who, like a certain Lord, had no virtue but an
  undeniable greatness. You will ask my authority for Francis's mission to
  Lovat,&mdash;or the singular conduct of Mr. John Murray. You will inquire how
  the final execution came six months too soon, and you will ransack
  Broughton's <i>Journal</i> in vain to find my veracious narrative of the
  doings of his beautiful wife. Such little matters are the chronicler's
  licence. But some excuse is needed for the introduction of your kinsman, the
  lord President, and the ragged picture of so choice a character. My apology
  must be that my canvas is no place for honest men, and the Laird of Culloden
  would have been discredited by his company.</p>

  <p class="intro">But, such as it is, I dedicate to you this chronicle of
  moorland wars, for the sake of an "auld Highland story" which neither of us
  would wish to see forgotten.</p>

     id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.<br>
  The Birkenshaws of That Ilk and Their Fortunes.</h2>

  <p class="first">When Gideon Birkenshaw&mdash;of Birkenshaw Tower in the
  Forest and the lands of Markit beneath the brow of remote Cheviot&mdash;was
  summoned by death to his account, he left all to his eldest son and turned
  the other penniless upon the world. Robert, the heir, stepped unthinking into
  the dead man's shoes, and set himself to the family task of amassing gear. He
  was a man already grim and aging at thirty, with the stoop of an inquisitor
  and deep eyes to search out the intents of the heart. Of old the house had
  been insignificant raiders, adding field to field and herd to herd by a
  method which it seemed scarce fair to call plunder, so staidly was it
  pursued. No minstrel sang their deeds, no tale of them was told at nightfall
  in the village, but in all decency and hardness they went like oxen to their
  resting-places. They cared naught for politics, but every now and again the
  stock bred a religious enthusiast. A Birkenshaw had served with the Lords of
  the Congregation, and another had spoken his testimony in the face of the
  Grassmarket and a thousand people, and swung off valiantly into eternity. The
  watchword of all was decency and order, and as peace settled upon the land
  they had left off their old huntings and harryings and fallen to money-making
  with the heartiest good-will. And they prospered deservedly. While the old
  poor Lamberts, Horsebrocks, and Burnets, whose names were in a hundred songs
  and tales, who had fought with quixotic gallantry forever on the losing side,
  and spent their substance as gaily as they had won it, sank into poverty and
  decline, the crabbed root of the Birkenshaws budded and put forth shoots.
  With anxious eyes and prayerful lips they held on their wonted path,
  delighting in the minutes of bargaining and religious observance, yet full of
  pride of house and brave with the stubborn valour of the unimaginative.</p>

  <p>It was indeed their pride of race, their inherited spirit, and their
  greater wealth which alone marked them off from the burly farmers of the
  countryside. To see them at kirk or market, their clothes were as coarse,
  their talk as rude, and their companions the same as their neighbours of the
  sheep-farms. But all knew and owned the distinction. Somewhere in the heavy
  brow and chin of a Birkenshaw there lurked passion and that ferocity which
  can always awe the born retainer. The flashes were scarce, but they were long
  remembered. When a son of the house broke the jaw of Chasehope for venturing
  to sell him a useless collie bitch, the countryside agreed that the man but
  got his deserts for seeking to overreach a Birkenshaw beyond the unwritten
  rules of dealing. And darker stories were told&mdash;of men maimed and slain
  in change-houses, even it was whispered at the door of the House of God, for
  chancing in their folly upon the family madness.</p>

  <p>They married women like themselves, hard, prudent, and close-lipped;
  seeking often far and wide for such a wife and never varying from their
  choice. Such marriages were seldom fruitful but never barren; one or two sons
  or daughters were always left to hand on the name and the inheritance. No man
  had yet been found of sufficient courage to mate with a daughter of the
  house, and so it fell out that those gaunt women, strong and tall as the men,
  stayed in the Birkenshaw Tower till their brothers' marriage, and then
  flitted to the lonely dwelling of Markit, where there always waited some
  brother or uncle in need of a housekeeper. Such an order in life brought its
  reward. There were no weaklings to spoil the family credit, and like a
  stripped unlovely pine the stock survived, abiding solitary on its hill-top
  and revelling in storms.</p>

  <p>But in their lives they paid assiduous court to a certain kind of virtue.
  In the old riding days the house had robbed and harried, as it were, under
  protest; and now, being fallen on settled times, they cultivated honesty with
  the greatest diligence. A Birkenshaw's word was as good as his oath, and his
  oath as his bond, and woe befall the man who doubted one or the other. The
  milk of human kindness was confined with them to family channels and
  embittered with the grudging which comes of obedience to the letter. By the
  canon of the Word of God they were men of a singular uprightness, but it was
  a righteousness which took the colour of the family traits. They set
  diligence, honour, and a freedom from gross vices on the one hand, and
  passion, relentless severity, and little love for their neighbours on the
  other, and, finding the result to be a species of pride, labelled it an
  excellence. Withal their penuriousness made their lives frugal and their
  toils gave them health, so that, a race of strong men, they ran their
  imperious course, feared in their faults and hated in their virtues.</p>

  <p>The pastimes of their class were little thought of. It was long since one
  of the name had been seen with the deer-hounds or playing a salmon in the
  floods of Tweed. Long days of riding over their broad lands were varied with
  noisy mornings in the clatter of a market-place or evenings filled with the
  sleep of well-fed lassitude. But when they came among their fellows it was
  with something of a presence,&mdash;the air of masters who cared little for
  the quibblings of superiority but were ready if occasion came to prove it by
  deed. Hence came the owercomes of "A Birkenshaw's glower," and "'Gang out o'
  my gate,' quo' auld Birkenshaw," with which the conversation of the valley
  was garnished to repletion.</p>

  <p>In such manner did life pass by in the grey stone dwelling which crowned
  the Yarrow braes, with Yarrow crooning in the nooks below. It was but
  yesterday I passed the place, which no lapse of years can change. The vale of
  long green hills which falls eastward from the lochs is treeless and desert
  for miles, with a wan stream sweeping 'neath barren hill-shoulders and the
  grey-green bent lending melancholy to all. But of a sudden it changes to a
  defile; the hills huddle together till the waters can scarce find passage;
  and a forest of wildwood chokes the gorge. Brown heather and green hazels
  crest every scarred rock and fringe the foot of Birkenshaw Tower, which looks
  steeply down on its woodland valley. Soft meadowgrass is shaded by a tangle
  of ashes, and in every dell the burn's trickle slips through a wild
  flower-garden; while in broad pools and shining stretches Yarrow goes singing
  her ageless song for evermore.</p>

  <p>Of the two sons born to Gideon Birkenshaw in the house on the hill, the
  elder was even as his father, a man of few words and hard deeds, ungenial,
  honest, and with all his qualities grounded on that rock of devilment which
  lay deep in the temper of his house. His person was such as his nature, and
  it was not hard to see in the spare and sinewy figure of the son the immature
  presentment of the father. But the younger, Francis, was like a changeling in
  the place. From his birth he had none of the ways of the rest; his very form
  was like a caricature of the family traits, and whatever was their strength
  was in him perverted to weakness. He had the Birkenshaw high cheek bones, the
  fleshy chin and the sunken eyes, but all were set carelessly together, as if
  by nature in a moment of sport. He had his father's long limbs and broad
  back, but in him the former were feeble and knoitering, the latter bent in an
  aimless stoop. In character the parody was the more exaggerated. Shrewdness
  became a debased cunning which did not halt at a fraud; energy, mere
  restlessness; and persistence, stupidity. Also the mastery over the bodily
  appetites which marked the kin was wholly absent in him, and early in life he
  took to brandy-drinking and tavern-loafing. Every fold has its black sheep
  and every house its weakling, but to the proud family whence he sprung
  Francis was something more than a ne'er-do-weel. He was a lasting disgrace,
  always at the doors, staring in their faces at kirk and market. It is the
  curse of such a kin that a man who shows somewhat weaker than the rest goes
  straight to the devil without a chance of redemption, and the house of
  Birkenshaw with drawn lips and averted eyes suffered the prodigal to go his
  way.</p>

  <p>But in the trivial Mr. Francis there remained some shreds and rags of
  quality unperceived by his kinsfolk. He alone in the whole history of his
  race possessed some tincture of the humanities, picked up in a ragged way but
  worthy of some note. He had something of a poetic soul and saw wonders in
  hill and water which were not for the busy men of affairs who rode their
  horses over the countryside solely that they might reach an end. He was
  humane in little matters and no dumb creature suffered ill-usage at his
  hands. Even in his vices he preserved some tatters of kindliness and
  <i>bonhomie</i> which endeared him to the folk with whom he consorted. In a
  dim, confused way he strove to guide his shambling life in the way of mercy,
  and in his stumbling made helpless efforts to rise.</p>

  <p>It was clear to all that such a state of matters could not long continue,
  and the mind of the countryside waited for a crisis. It arrived at length and
  in the expected way. The blacksmith of Birkenshaw was one Reuben Gowanlock, a
  drunken ill-conditioned fellow, with a set hatred of the family in the Tower
  and a marvellous power of quarrelling. His daughter Marion, a handsome girl
  of twenty, fell much in the way of Mr. Francis in his village sojournings,
  and an intimacy sprang up between them which endured all through the spring
  and summer of a year. No record exists of its nature, but it is certain that
  the couple took long walks in the sunset vale, during which Francis would
  charm her ears with his flowery rhapsodical talk and her vanity with his
  presence. In the winter a child was born, and in the eyes of all, the laird's
  son stood confessed as the father. The blacksmith cursed deep and swore
  vengeance; poor Marion dared not show herself abroad; and things looked black
  enough for both. But worse was still to follow, for the place was startled
  one morn by the news that Francis had married the girl in all honour and good
  faith. Here was food for gossip and speculation, and it was the common
  verdict that the man had made such reparation in terror of Reuben's menaces.
  Yet it is certain that nothing was less in Francis's mind. Whatever grave
  lack he had, there was no stint in his share of the family courage. His
  motive for the deed was an indistinct sense of honour, a certain ill-defined
  compassionateness of heart, which he scarcely realised and would not have
  sought to defend.</p>

  <p>For the twain the end came sharp and cruel. There was long speech in the
  place of the interview between Francis and his father, and stray fragments of
  what passed were spread abroad. The wretched creature with his farcical
  handsomeness and strength stood shivering before the terrible old man, who
  represented the essence of a long line which knew no mercy. Every inch of his
  face was browned and wrinkled with sun and wind; his eye glanced steely as an
  October sun; and his figure was alive with vigour and wrath. He had been
  absent on a visit to Markit when the events occurred and all was over ere he
  returned. So in riding-boots and greatcoat he sat at the table's end with a
  hunting crop before him. He heard the village explanation of his son's folly
  and he was not slow to believe it. His sentences came out with a dry rasp and
  with an ominous accompaniment of lowering brows. "I will not speak of the
  crime against God's law as written in His book, for that is a matter between
  you and your saul." Indeed, it was said that others of the Birkenshaws had
  erred in like manner, and in any case it was not a sin which involved any
  surcease of pride. "But of one thing I will speak," he went on, "and that is
  of your offence against the bluid of the man that begat ye and the house that
  gives ye your name. Ye have mairrit a tinkler lass, you, ye splaittering
  body, because ye were feared at her faither's mauvering. By God, there was
  never yet ane o' your race wi' sic a taid's hert."</p>

  <p>The wretched son made no attempt at a defence which he would have scarcely
  told to himself. He shuffled with ineffectual feeling, a prey to sentiment
  and inward tears.</p>

  <p>"But 'my son' did I say?" the other went on. "Na, na, ye are nae son o'
  mine. Gang to the midden ye've been pikin' on and let a cleanly honest house
  be quit o' ye. Gang off, the pair o' ye, and breed up bairns to rin for
  porters and serve in byres. By the Lord Almichty I disown ye, and I wis nae
  mair than to see ye in the kennel ye've made for yoursel'. Gang out o' my
  sicht, ye thing o' strae."</p>

  <p>Francis went out of the room with an indistinct pain of heart, for he was
  no more than sober from his morning cups. Yet the grating tones had scarcely
  ceased, the door was scarcely closed, ere the old man laid his head on his
  hands and suffered in dry-eyed misery the pangs of pride wounded through
  affection.</p>

  <p>Of the exact movements of Mr. Francis after that hour there remains no
  adequate record. He could not bide in the house, nor did his remnants of
  pride suffer him to remain in the village. With such small belongings as were
  his he took himself and his wife to Edinburgh and set up dwelling in a dingy
  room in the Monk's Vennel. How he lived no man could tell, but it seems
  likely that when all his gear had gone for brandy this scion of a reputable
  house did odd jobs for whoever was willing to hire him, from copying a bill
  to carrying a bundle. One thing is certain, that his course, whatever it was,
  soon drew to an end. His body was never strong, and his impressionable and
  capricious temper of mind was not far removed from craziness. Poverty and
  dram-drinking so wrought upon him that soon he was little better than an
  enfeebled idiot, sitting melancholy on tavern benches and feeding the fire of
  life on crude spirits. Two more children&mdash;daughters&mdash;were born to
  him, and some five years after his departure from home, Mr. Francis
  Birkenshaw had become a mere wreck of his former wreckage, a parody of a
  parody. Six months later a fever took him, and kindly Death stepped in with
  his snuffer and turned the guttering candle into blackness.</p>

  <p>Hitherto we have not spoken of Mistress Marion Birkenshaw who adorned the
  dim house in the Monk's Vennel. Her beauty, at first considerable, had grown
  with the years to heaviness, and nought remained but singular black eyes. Her
  nature was not extraordinary, but rejoiced in the niceties of gossip and the
  refinements of housekeeping. Her early behaviour was the sudden blossoming of
  romance in an orderly mind, and with the advancing months she returned to the
  placid level of the common. Had she married decently and dwelled in her
  native village she would have been a matron without reproach, a mistress of
  gossip and old-wives' tales, glorying in little hospitalities and petty
  hatreds, an incarnation of the respectable. As it was, she ruled the
  household with a bustling hand, and found neighbours in a desert of
  strangers. The clack of her tongue sounded all day about the doors, or was
  sunk in the afternoon to a contented sing-song when Mistress Gilfillan
  dropped in to sew with her and tell her woes. Even in so hard a place she
  attained to some measure of happiness, and speedily ordered sprawling
  children and feckless husband with a pride in the very toil which would have
  cheered one's heart. Loud-tongued, noisy, coarse as sackcloth, a wallower in
  the juicily sentimental, she yet had something of the spirit of a general,
  and marshalled her ragged forces in decent array.</p>

  <p>On the death of Mr. Francis her action took a characteristic path. For,
  meeting Robert, now master of the broad lands of Birkenshaw, in the High
  Street, one chill February morn, she forthwith detailed to him his brother's
  debts, and with the abandon of her class glided from becoming tears into the
  necessary question of maintenance. The Laird's feelings at the moment would
  be hard to tell. The thought that one of his house should have sunk so low
  that his widow had to beg her bread, stung him like a lash. He lost for the
  moment his habitual reserve. With a mumbled "Tak' it, wumman, tak' it;
  there'll be mair to follow," he thrust some gold into her hand; and
  thenceforth came quarterly payments from Birkenshaw with a bare word of
  communication. Marion took them gladly, for she had no other choice, and on
  such means she reared her children to grown age.</p>

  <p>One incident in her character remains which is eloquent in its
  strangeness. From the day of her departure she held no communication with her
  folk at the smithy, manifesting no interest in their doings and shunning even
  the mention of their names. Deep in her soul was a well of sentiment. She had
  mated with a Birkenshaw and some peace-offering was due to the fetich of the
  family pride. A sense of an honour paid to her hung ever on her conscience;
  it made her look with respect on her own children as something higher than
  herself; and it forced her to the severance of natural ties. It is doubtful,
  indeed, whether they were ever tightly knit, for the drunken father had
  little kindness for any. But, such as they were, they were gladly renounced,
  and with something not far from heroism this foolish woman took loneliness
  for her portion, a solitude brightened with the halo of a great
  connection.</p>

  precipitancy, for in that house life was not suited for a lengthy play-day.
  At five he had been as ugly as sin in face, though well-grown and straight in
  body. His father's hard features and ruddy skin were joined to Marion's
  sloe-black eyes and hair, and such a conjunction is not fair in childhood. So
  peculiarly sinister an appearance would have made him the butt of his
  coevals, had he not possessed a hot temper and an uncommonly hard fist. From
  his sixth year battles were of daily occurrence, and it was rarely that the
  week-end found him with his face unmarked. But inch by inch, wound by wound,
  he fought his way to fame, till the mere sight of his black countenance was
  more than enough to hush the wrangling of the others and incline their ears
  to his words.</p>

  <p>But with those days we have little to do, and it is at the maturity of
  eighteen that we would take up the tale of his life. His sisters, Jean and
  Lisbeth, were now grown to high-coloured, loud-spoken girls, who shared their
  mother's likings and their mother's comeliness. The Birkenshaw payments made
  comfort possible, and the house was conducted in a pleasant stir, with
  gossips sitting at all hours and the sharp tones of the housewife guarding
  its cleanliness and order. The two lasses were the blacksmith's true
  grandchildren, and in no way different from a thousand such maids in the
  city. They loved to dress in their best of a Sabbath and walk in decent
  procession to the Cross Kirk, where the ministrations of Mr. Linklater were
  sugared with the attentions of the young apprentices. They were notable cooks
  and wrought all day to their mother's bidding with a cheery bustle. In a
  word, they were of their mother's pattern,&mdash;honest, fresh-coloured,
  hearty, and friendly to all.</p>

  <p>Had it not been for their brother's presence, the household in the Monk's
  Vennel might have been an abode of prosperous peace. But Francis was a puzzle
  to most folk and a grief to his mother such as her foolish loose-lived
  husband had never been. The years brought him height and strength and a
  handsome face. It would have been hard to find in all the town a nobler
  figure of a man, when anger did not distort the features. From some unknown
  forebear he derived an air of uncommon masterfulness, and a carriage which
  might have vied with that of the greatest buck of the day, my Lord Craigforth
  himself. His temper was like his body, fierce, and strong, and hot as a red
  fire, so that no man could anger him with safety. In happier conditions he
  might have followed the paths of virtue, for there seemed nothing ignoble in
  that brow and eye. But in the kitchen of his home, among the clatter of
  neighbour tongues and women's gossip, in the presence of his mother and
  sisters and the rotund housewives who called them friends, he was wofully out
  of place.</p>

  <p>In his childhood he had cared little for the thing, for the street was his
  home at most hours; but as he grew to age the whole life oppressed him with
  deep disgust. To him alone had fallen a share of the Birkenshaw temper, and
  he revolted from this unctuous existence. For his kin he had fits of
  tenderness, but at his age no feeling is so weak as domestic love. The result
  was not hard to foresee. With such share as he had of the family income he
  took to his own pleasures, and the house saw him not save at meal-time and
  the late night.</p>

  <p>Who shall tell of the glorious Edinburgh of that age in all its colour and
  splendour and dirt? The years of last century were still young, the second
  George was but new on the throne, and in the northern city life flowed freely
  and hotly in a muddy, turbulent stream. The drums of war were still in men's
  memories, and soldiers from the Castle still thronged the street. In the
  narrow alleys which wound like snakes among the high, dark houses there
  lurked filth and disease which have long since gone from the land. Ragged
  Highland lairds and broken gillies, fine periwigged gentlemen, ministers many
  with their sombre black, fair ladies and country wives, honest shepherds in
  homespun from the South, half the gentry of the land, as well as the staid
  merchant or the wandering southerner, were jostled on the narrow causeway by
  French agents and priests in hiding, or fell a prey at dark corners to the
  lurking cut-purse. Roaring east winds disturbed the trials in the Parliament
  House, where half a dozen learned judges administered the law, ere hurrying
  back to dinner and their unfinished treatises on Taste and the Sublime. And
  the same wind caught at the throats of half-starved loyalists shivering in
  entries, and praying and plotting for that day when the King should come back
  to his own. Every now and again the streets were in an uproar over some
  straggling news of a fresh landing, and the good citizens listened to the
  bugle on the Castle rock with a feeling of confirmed security. It was the day
  of riot and bright colour, of fine dresses and rags, of honest poverty and
  the blackguard shuffling in the same kennel,&mdash;a day when no man knew his
  own mind or his neighbours', and the King's peace was more brittle than the
  King desired.</p>

  <p>But above all it was the hey-day of taverns, great houses of festivity
  where beside leaping fires a motley crew dined and grew drunk in all good
  fellowship. The age must be thick with alarums and perils of war to produce
  the fine flower of tavern-life. It is when a man's mind is hot with wild news
  or the expectation of its reception that he leaves his ingle and seeks the
  steaming hearth and the talk of neighbours. And who can tell of the
  possibilities which lie in such an evening, of a door flung open and a
  stranger coming full of unheard-of tales? The inn-lounger is as surely a
  glutton for the romantic as the adventurer upon the sea.</p>

  <p>To such homes of the soul went Francis with more zeal than discretion.
  There, and not in the female atmosphere of the Monk's Vennel, he found the
  things in which his heart delighted. The talk of men in its freedom and
  brutality was his delight, and in the motley concourse of folk he had matter
  for a living interest. A strain of inherited vice made the darker side of it
  soon cease to appall him, and in time he passed from the place of a spectator
  to that of a partaker in many carousals, a sworn friend to half the riff-raff
  in the city, the ally of loose women and causeway sots.</p>

  <p>Yet in this spring-tide of wild oats there was none of the sower's zest.
  After all, he was very much of an amateur in vice, restrained from excess by
  many bonds of memory, convention, and human kindliness. His course was the
  recoil from the paths of fireside virtue, the outcome of something uncommon
  and heroical in a nature run to seed. At moments a sense of the folly of it
  all oppressed him, but the fatal rhetoric of a boy's thoughts put the graver
  reflection to flight. He would regain his self-respect by fancying himself a
  man of the world, living with a hand close on the springs of life, one who in
  all folly was something beyond his allies. And in consequence he sank but
  rarely into brutish drunkenness,&mdash;a sin (for the confusion of all
  doctrines of heredity) which had little hold upon him,&mdash;and even from
  such lapses recovered himself with a certain alertness of spirit. Yet this
  was but the immaturity of his character, a thing to pass away with years, and
  in a little Francis might have looked to grow to a blackguard of some
  quality.</p>

  <p>To his mother his life was a source of uncomprehending grief. Her efforts
  of kindness were now repelled and now met half-way with an inconsistency
  which confounded all her notions. When her son staggered home in the small
  hours, or when Mistress Leithen of the Candle Row retailed strange stories of
  his evil-doing, the unhappy woman was, if anything, less pained than
  mystified. Maternal affection, which for the glorifying of poor humanity, is
  strongest in the coarsely sentimental, bade her sorrow, when all the rest of
  her nature bade her only wonder. So with a patience and a denseness too deep
  for words, she persisted in her tenderness, bore his lordly humours, and
  revolted his soul with a thousand nauseous vulgarities, since to the rake the
  only intolerable coarseness is the respectably plebeian.</p>

  <p>Now it chanced that Fate took it upon her to order events for the saving
  of Francis' soul. About his eighteenth year he had entered a writer's office
  in the city, for no other cause than to give himself some name whereby to
  describe his life. An odd strain of worldly prudence kept him from neglecting
  his duties to dismissal point, and in a sort of careful idleness he copied
  deeds, visited ground for seisin, and collected rents in and out of the town.
  He had no ill-will to the work, provided it did not bear too hardly upon his
  time. But meanwhile in the burgh of Dysart, which sits perched on the steep
  shore of Fife, there lived a Mr. Gregor Shillinglaw, who as the one lawyer in
  the place had a good livelihood and a busy life. He was growing old, and in
  the natural course bethought him of a successor. His head clerk, John
  Henryson, was able and willing for the place, but Mr. Shillinglaw belonged to
  a school of men who have less respect for long services than for family ties.
  Once on a time a Birkenshaw had married a distant cousin of his, and the two
  names had a kinship in his memory. So it fell out that, being in Edinburgh at
  the office of Trumbull and Gleed, who were Francis's masters, he saw the lad,
  heard his name, and was affected with a sudden kindness.</p>

  <p>He asked after his business merits. Good, admirable, said Mr. Trumbull,
  with a smile. And his character? Oh, well, some folk are young and fresh in
  blood, and the same rule does not hold for all, said the lawyer, amazed at
  his own heresy, but bound in honour to say nothing to the discredit of his
  house or servants. Mr. Shillinglaw heard and was satisfied; the hint of
  gentlemanly vices only increased his friendliness for the young man; so
  before the week was out Francis received an offer to go to Dysart to a place
  which with care might bring him to an old age of opulence and respect.</p>

  <p>To Dysart Francis went with a mixture of feelings. He had never lived
  elsewhere than in Edinburgh, and he was glad to make trial of a new habitat
  on the very edge of the sea. More, he had many deeds to his name in Edinburgh
  which would scarce bear the inevitable scrutiny which the days must bring.
  His credit, too, was low, and his debts great; so with a light heart and much
  hope he betook himself to the dark rooms in the little wind-worn town, where
  a man's lips are always salt with the air from the sea, and a roaring East
  sweeps in the narrow lanes.</p>

  <p>The ancient town is now a very little place, unsightly with coal and dingy
  with stagnant traffic. But in the days of Mr. Shillinglaw it was a bustling
  port, where skippers from Amsterdam came with strong waters and cheeses and
  Lord knows what, and carried away beer and tallow, hides and sea-coal. It
  boasted of a town-house where the noisy burgesses met, and elegant piazzas
  where foreign merchants walked and chaffered. In the rock-hewn harbour lay at
  all times twoscore and more of schooners, and the high red-tiled houses
  looked down upon an eternal stir of shipping and unlading. It was a goodly
  place to live, for health came with the clean sea-wind and wealth with every
  tide.</p>

  <p>Of Francis's doings in this place there is scant account save for the
  brilliant episode which marked his departure. It seems that at first he
  wrought well under Mr. Shillinglaw's guidance, and the two would drink their
  claret of a night in all amity. But untoward events soon thickened in the
  younger's path, and, aided by his uncertain temper, he began anew his
  downward course. From the time when he first saw Nell Durward his doom was
  assured, and thereafter his master might grieve or storm, but Francis
  remained untouched. Nell was the provost's daughter, tall and comely, with
  bright cheeks and saucy black eyes which captured his roving thoughts.
  Thenceforth he was her slave, running at her every beck and nod, till her
  father, with some inkling of how matters stood, resolved to put an end to his
  daughter's coquetry, and plainly told the eager lover that Nell was already
  betrothed to a Baillie of the town, one Gow by name, and would shortly be his
  wife.</p>

  <p>Francis flung himself out of the house, and from that hour till after the
  celebration of the wedding drank more deeply than he had ever done before,
  and bade Mr. Shillinglaw and his business go to the devil whence they had
  come. For three weeks he was the bye-word of the town; then, when all was
  over, he returned to his right mind and relapsed into decency with some
  apology for his absence.</p>

  <p>But Fate had still further tricks to play on him. It chanced that a yearly
  dinner was held in the Bunch of Grapes in memory of some former benefactor of
  the town, and thereafter dancing went on till morning in the roomy upper
  chamber, where faded silk hangings and a frowning portrait proclaimed
  antiquity. Hither went Francis in a sober mood, and after the meal drank his
  toddy with the fathers of the burgh as befitted a grave notary. But after he
  had his fill of their company and had grown hot with the fumes of spirits, he
  mounted the stair, and sitting by the fiddlers surveyed the gay scene.
  Suddenly to the assembly there entered Baillie Gow, with the aforetime Nell
  Durward blushing on his arm. The devil of boastfulness, born of early and
  deep potation, drove the man in the direction of his rival. He gaped before
  him, and then with many abusive words delivered him a moral homily. The blood
  of Francis, hot at the best, was roused to madness by the man's conduct and
  the thought of his own unrewarded love. "Let go his arm, my dear," he said
  quietly to the girl, and struck the portly baillie clean on the jaw so that
  he dropped like a felled ox.</p>

  <p>Now Mr. Gow was a great man in the town, and at the sight a party, with
  the landlord, one Derrick, at their head, made to lay hands on his assailant.
  But Francis was strong and young, and with a bench he cleared a space around
  him and fought his way to the door. His head was in a muddle, and his one
  thought was to reach the street. But at the stair-top the landlord confronted
  him, and with a cudgel struck him smartly on the face. The blow roused
  madness to action. With a sudden crazy resolution, Francis drew his knife and
  stabbed the man in the side, and then breaking through the crowd on the steps
  reached the open and ran straight for the distant woods.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the incident goes with still greater spirit. For three
  days Francis lay hid among the brackens with the terror of murder on his
  soul. But none came to seek him, and with the hours his confidence grew, till
  he summoned his courage and sallied out at the darkening of the fourth day.
  With infinite labour he avoided observation, and entered the narrow wynds.
  Now came his chief toil. He must learn of the landlord's fate to ease his
  mind and determine his plans. So in much trepidation he betook himself to the
  only haven he could think of, the house of one Berritch, a man of reputed
  wealth but no reputation, a former ally of his own in tavern-drinking, and
  esteemed a trafficker in the contraband.</p>

  <p>Thither he crept, and won immediate admittance. He heard with relief that
  his enemy was all but recovered, that the wound had been a mere scratch, and
  that his name was free at least from such a stain. But otherwise, Mr.
  Berritch admonished him, things looked black indeed. Mr. Shillinglaw had
  repudiated him, and the respectability of the place had made their faces
  flint against him. It was currently believed that he had returned to the
  purlieus of Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>In such a state of affairs Francis was ripe for an offer, and Mr. Berritch
  did not fail him. He himself would undertake to bring him to France in one of
  his boats, and set him down where there was chance and room for likely young
  lads unburdened with a conscience. He could not remain in Dysart, and the
  city was but a halting-place on the road to beggary. That night a lugger
  would sail from the Wemyss Rocks in which he was welcome to a passage.</p>

  <p>The conclusion of the episode was yet more varied; for when all had won to
  the starting-place, word was brought that the Burnt island gaugers had got
  tidings about Mr. Berritch and his occupation, which would lead them that
  night to pay a visit to his dwelling. The unfortunate man bowed to fate in a
  transport of cursing, and set his face to the boat and the sea; but in the
  nick of time he had mind of valuable monies left in the house, which he would
  little like to see in the hands of the law. He was at his wits' end, when
  Francis, with the uneasy generosity of one in debt, offered to go to fetch
  them. Accordingly he set out and made his way through the dark and filthy
  east streets of Dysart, not without some qualms of anxiety. But at the High
  Street corner he met a man in an advanced stage of drunkenness, stumbling
  over ash-buckets and suffering from the narrowness of the path. A glance
  convinced him that it was none other than Baillie Gow, returning from some
  borough dinner, and flown with wine and talk. A plan grew in Francis's mind
  which made him shake with mirth. Slipping his arm through the Baillie's, he
  led him to Mr. Berritch's house and set him in Mr. Berritch's chair, with Mr.
  Berritch's wig on his head and a tumbler of rum at his elbow. Then he secured
  the gold, and slipped outside the window to wait the result. His patience was
  little tried, for soon there came the tramp of men down the street, a
  knocking at the door, a forced entrance, and a swoop upon their prisoner. He
  heard them read the paper of identification, and give a one-voiced consent to
  every detail. Then with aching sides and smarting eyes he watched them lift
  the innocent upon their shoulders; and when their tread died away he betook
  himself to the cutter in huge delight at his own boyish humour.</p>

  <p>With this bravado begins the history of the doings of Mr. Francis
  Birkenshaw, which he did in the years of our Lord seventeen hundred and
  forty-five and seventeen hundred and forty-six in the reign of George the
  Second, King of England. In such a fine fervour of conceit and daring he
  launched out upon his course. The events of the past weeks seemed like an
  ancient tale from which he was separated by years of maturity. In a night he
  had outgrown any vain schemes for a reputable life of good-citizenship. Now
  he was free to go whither he pleased, and carve his fortune in the manner
  best suiting him without restraint of prejudice. As the vessel rode on the
  waters and the wind sang in the sheets, his heart was strengthened with
  pleasing self-praise, not without a hint of mirth at the comedy of life.</p>

  <p>But for all great designs money was needful, and Mr. Berritch himself was
  the first to mention it. Now the secret of the Birkenshaw payments had always
  been kept hid from him, and he thought that the family substance came from
  some fortune of his father's. There must be some portion remaining to him, he
  thought, and on this he set his hope. So it was settled that the lugger
  should lie well into the Lothian coast during the day, and in the evening he
  should be put ashore to seek his own. Then once again they would set sail for
  their longer voyage.</p>

  <p>The plan was carried out to the letter, and at eight the next night
  Francis was knocking at the door of his mother's house. From within came the
  noise of tongues and women's laughter, and the cheerful clatter of dishes
  which marks the close of a meal. His mother opened to him, wiping her mouth
  with her apron in a way she had, and smirking over her shoulder. At the sight
  of him she started, and he entered unbidden. The place bore all the marks of
  comfort, and in the firelight he saw two women of the neighbourhood, old
  gossips of his sisters and mother. His entrance hushed their talk, and
  sidelong looks and a half-giggle succeeded. Somehow the sight roused his
  gorge unspeakably. He, with his mind intent upon high adventure, with the
  smell of the salt and the fierce talk of men still in his memory, loathed
  this glosing prosperity, these well-fed women, and the whole pettiness of
  life. He took his mother aside and demanded the money which was his share.
  She, good soul, did not tell him the truth, but wrapping herself up in her
  rags of pride, went to a drawer and gave him a meagre bag of gold. It was the
  latest payment, and its loss meant straitened living for months. But he knew
  nothing of this, thought it but his share, and grumbled at its smallness.
  With the irony which riots in life, at that moment he was pluming himself
  upon superiority to such narrow souls, when all the while pride in one was
  making a sacrifice of which he knew nothing. His remnants of filial love made
  him take a kindly farewell of his mother; and then, with nose in the air and
  a weathercock of a brain, he shook off the dust of the domestic, and went out
  to the open world.</p>

  <p>With the doorway of his former home, he passed from vice frowned upon and
  barely loved to vice gilded and set upon a pedestal. A sense of high
  exhilaration grew upon him. He would follow his own desires, with the aid of
  a strong hand and a courageous heart. In his then frame of mind the only
  baseness seemed to lie in settling upon his lees in the warm air of the
  reputable. A hard conscience and a ready hand were a man's truest honour, and
  with this facile catchword he went whistling into a new life.</p>

  <p>But at the moment something from the past came to greet him. As he passed
  a tavern door a girl with the face and attire of the outcast hailed him
  boisterously and made to link her arm with his. He knew her well for one of
  his aforetime comrades. Her face was pinched, and the night wind was blowing
  through her thin frock. But from Francis she got no kindness. His heart at
  the time was too steeled on his own path for old regrets. With a curse he
  struck her harshly with his open hand, and watched her stagger back to the
  causeway. The blow comforted his soul. It was the seal upon his new course,
  the rubicon which at length he had crossed; and when he came to Musselburgh
  sands and the lugger, it was with an increased resolution in his fool's
  heart.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>
  Forth and Tweed.</h2>

  <p class="first">The wind was already shaking in the sails when he clambered
  aboard, and the windlass groaned with the lifting anchor. Mr. Berritch cried
  a cheery greeting from the bow, as Francis, heavy with sleep, tumbled down
  below to bed. The moon was up, the night airs were fine, and in a little the
  lugger was heading by the south end of Inchkeith for the swell of the North
  Ocean.</p>

  <p>At dawn Francis was up and sniffing the salt air over the bulwarks. A
  landsman born, he had little acquaintance with the going down to the sea in
  ships, and the easy movement and the brisk purpose of the lugger delighted
  his heart. He was still in the first heat of adventure; the white planking,
  the cordage, and the tarry smell were all earnests of something new; and with
  the vanishing smoke and spires he beheld the end of a life crimped and
  hampered. He felt extraordinary vigour of body and a certain haphazard
  quality of mind which added breadth to his freedom. But at the last sight of
  the Pentlands' back, sentiment woke for one brief moment ere she shook her
  wings and fled.</p>

  <p>He turned from his meditation to find Mr. Berritch at his elbow with a
  smile and a good-morning. Seen in the first light his face had an ugly look
  about the eyes and ponderous jaw, a shadow in the lines of his mouth. With
  him came another, whose face Francis had not seen before,&mdash;a lean youth
  with bleak eyes, a hanging chin, and a smirk always on the verge of his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Ye came well off frae your venture, Francie," said Mr. Berritch. "I have
  to present to ye Mr. Peter Stark, a young gentleman out o' Dumbarton, bound
  on the same errand to France as yoursel'. Starkie, this is Mr. Birkenshaw I
  telled ye o'."</p>

  <p>The two bowed awkwardly, and the elder man went off and left them. Francis
  got little comfort from the sight of the gawky boy before him. If this were a
  type of the gentleman-adventurer, then it would have suited better with his
  tastes to have chosen another trade. As for Mr. Stark, he assumed an air of
  wonderful shrewdness, which raw youth at all times believes to be the mark of
  the man of affairs.</p>

  <p>"What's garred ye take the road, Mr. Birkenshaw?" said he, with the
  drawling accent of the West.</p>

  <p>The other looked him up and down with rudeness and leisure, scanning every
  detail of his rustic clothes, his ill-tied hair, and the piteous aping of the
  fine gentleman in his carriage. This was no better than the tavern sots in
  Edinburgh with whom he had brawled a year before.</p>

  <p>"What if I do not care to make my business public on every shipboard,
  sir?" he said with chill insolence. "Do you think I should go about making
  proclamation of my past?"</p>

  <p>The boy looked aggrieved and taken aback. "But between men of honour," he
  said sullenly.</p>

  <p>Francis laughed the laugh of the man to whom all old burdens are now but
  the merest names. "Honour!" he said, with a sense of diplomacy in the
  assumption of a part, "honour is not a luxury for you or me, my friend. We're
  running atween the jaws o' government warships, and whatever we may have done
  it's unlikely that there'll be much talk o' fair trial for suspects. Every
  man is his neighbour's enemy till he has put his breast before him to the
  bullet. Then there may be friendship. But what talk is this of honour, sir,
  atween two chance acquaintances?" And he stood, darkly suspicious, in a
  fervour of self-admiration.</p>

  <p>The other bent low in respect for this new revelation of spirit. He felt a
  tingle of shame for his petty villainies in the presence of one whose crimes
  might yet be called high-treason. By a mere chance Francis had fallen upon
  the part best suited to take his comrade's fancy. Henceforth he might act as
  he pleased and yet loom heroic to the reverent eyes of Mr. Stark. The frank
  homage pleased him, and he felt a morsel of liking for this uncouth
  westlander. So leaning over the rail, they spoke of their joint fortunes.</p>

  <p>With the freshets of the wider seas Francis rose in spirits. His mind, in
  the Edinburgh and Dysart days, had always been panoramic, raking the future
  with its spy-glass and finding solace in visions. He had never entered a
  brawl or a debauch without some glimpse of himself in the act of cutting a
  fine figure to cheer his fancy. For the mere approval of gossip he had cared
  little, but much for the verdict of a certain select imaginary coterie who
  kept house in his brain. Now his part was the adventurer, and he sought to
  play it to his satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"They say that France is weel-filled wi' Scots," said Mr. Stark. "I hae
  near twae hunner guineas I took frae my faither, and I'm the lad to mak'
  mair." And he stuck his hat more jauntily, and whistled the stave of a
  song.</p>

  <p>"Guineas for auld men," said Francis. "For me, I have little thought on
  gear, if I but get free hand and fair play. Lasses and gear fall soon to the
  high hand. For myself, I am for the King's court, the rightful King's, as a
  gentleman should. Ye'll be a Whig since ye come from the Westlands, Mr.
  Stark?"</p>

  <p>"Whig did you say? Na, na! I was a Whig yince when Kate Mallison was yin,
  and I gaed to the Kirk to watch her. But noo I'll sing <i>Jamie come hame</i>
  wi' any braw lad that's to my mind." And the boy grimaced and swaggered with
  fine abandonment.</p>

  <p>Something in the attitude struck the finical Francis with disgust. This
  Dumbarton apprentice had not the figure or speech of a King's man. He was on
  the point of giving him back some rude gibe, when a thought of his new part
  smote upon him. He checked his tongue and held a diplomatic peace. To the
  true master no tool was too feeble for use, so he set to to flatter Mr.
  Stark.</p>

  <p>It may be guessed that the task prospered, for soon the face of the one
  beamed with conscious worth. Then the voice of Mr. Berritch broke roughly in
  upon the colloquy.</p>

  <p>"Heh, Starkie, come and gie's a lift wi' this wecht."</p>

  <p>The boy looked queerly at his companion and ambled off to obey. He came
  back with face flushed from stooping, only to find in Francis a mood of stony
  disdain.</p>

  <p>For a little he looked out to sea and bit his lips. Then he said in
  accents of apology: "He askit little to tak' me ower, so I maun needs help
  him in his bit jobs."</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to do with your affairs," said his immovable comrade, "but
  I would be sweered to fetch and carry for any man. And what talk is this o'
  money? Does he charge hire like an Alloa ferryman?"</p>

  <p>To the bargaining mind of the other such a tone seemed uncalled for. "Ye
  wadna expect him to dae't for love? I couldna dae't mysel'."</p>

  <p>"Then, by God, Mr. Stark, ye have most of the lessons of gentility to
  learn."</p>

  <p>At this moment of time the voice of Mr. Berritch was again audible. He
  came aft the vessel with his brow shining from toil. Now, on the high seas,
  he was a different man from the secret gentleman of Dysart. His tones were
  boisterous and full of authority, his eye commanding, and his figure trimmer.
  More, his jaw looked uglier, and his narrow, unkindly eyes a full half more
  disconcerting.</p>

  <p>"Starkie, my lad," he shouted, "ye maun come and gie's a hand. And you,
  Mr. Birkenshaw, gang to the bows and help Tam Guthrie wi' the ropes. I'm
  terrible short-handed this voyage, and I canna hae idlers."</p>

  <p>The hectoring note roused contradiction in Francis's blood. He bore no
  dear affection for Mr. Berritch, and he had no mind to serve him. He scarcely
  even felt the debt of obligation, for had he not already risked his liberty
  for the captain's gold?</p>

  <p>"Ye would not have me work like a tarry sailor, Mr. Berritch?" said
  he.</p>

  <p>"E'en so," said the bold ship's captain. "I would have ye work like a
  tarry sailor when ye're on my lugger." And he looked the young man up and
  down with insolent eye.</p>

  <p>Francis became for the moment magnanimous. "If ye were to ask it as a
  favour, I would be the first to oblige ye, but ..."</p>

  <p>The other cut him short, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Weel, weel, sir, if ye're mindit to play the fine gentleman ye can dae it
  and be damned to ye. But ye'll pay me twenty guineas down for your passage,
  when I micht hae been content wi' ten if ye had shown decent civility."</p>

  <p>Francis grew dusky with sudden wrath.</p>

  <p>"I thought I had paid ye for my passage already," said he, hoarsely.
  "Besides, I had a thought that there was a talk o' friendship in the
  matter."</p>

  <p>Mr. Berritch laughed long and loud. "Is't like," he said, "when ye winna
  dae a bit obleegement when I ask ye? Na, na, my man, ye'll gie me the twenty
  afore ye steer frae thae boards, and seein' that ye're payin' for it a' ye
  can take your leisure like a gentleman."</p>

  <p>It would be hard to tell the full irritation of his hearer's mind. To be
  blocked and duped thus early in his career of adventure by a knavery more
  complete than his own, was bitter as wormwood. A certain trust in the
  generous and the friendly had remained to him even in his renunciation of
  virtue, and now its loss seemed more vexatious than consisted with his new
  view of the world. He was in a maze of self-distrust and wounded sentiment,
  to which, as the minutes passed, was joined the more wholesome passion of
  anger.</p>

  <p>For one brief second he was tempted to a curious course. He had almost
  paid the money demanded, posed as the wounded friend, and continued in this
  lofty character. But the feeling passed, and his vexation sealed his resolve
  to send Mr. Berritch and his crew to the devil rather than yield.</p>

  <p>"What's he taking from you?" he asked Starkie, who stood watching the
  result with the interest of malice.</p>

  <p>"He's daein' it for ten," was the answer.</p>

  <p>"Then this is my word to you, Mr. Berritch," and Francis drew himself up
  with bravado. "Ye offered to take me over for friendliness, and, though we
  fall out over the matter of friendship, I hold ye to your bargain. You land
  me in France hale and safe, or I'll ken the reason why," and he tapped his
  sword-handle with rising pride.</p>

  <p>"And this is my word to you, Mr. Birkenshaw," said the captain, his face
  aflame with rage. He had flung down the rope-end, and stood with arms on hips
  and blazing eyes. "I hae three men here wi' me, ilka ane a match for you, and
  I mysel' could soon gar ye pit up your bit swirdie. But I'm a man o' peace,
  and I likena violence. If ye dinna pay me your farin' here and now, I land ye
  in Berwick afore night, whaur I ken o' some who will hae meikle to say to ye
  aboot your misdeeds."</p>

  <p>The man's whole carriage had changed from the bluff bravado he had once
  affected to an air of cunning and respectable malice. Francis felt the
  hopelessness of his case, and his thoughts grew hotter. He drew his blade and
  was in the act of rushing upon his foe, when that worthy whistled shrilly,
  and at the sign the three ship hands, truculent fellows all, came running to
  his side. Francis glanced toward Starkie and there read the folly of his
  action. If the Westlander had but joined him he would have forthwith attacked
  the quarto with some good-will. But his comrade clearly had no love for the
  sight of steel, for with a very white face and shaking legs he was striving
  to act the mediator.</p>

  <p>The captain regarded his opponent grimly and calmly. As the anger ebbed
  from Francis' brain his reason returned and he regarded his folly with some
  little shame. But sufficient remained to make him obdurate. "Take me to
  Berwick if it please ye," he cried, "but ye'll never see the glint o' my
  money."</p>

  <p>"To Berwick ye'll gang," was the sour answer, "and I wis ye may like it."
  And without more words he went about his business.</p>

  <p>Francis went over to the gunwale and looked out to sea. The September day
  was ending in a drizzle of mist and small rain. He could not see the shore,
  save as a dim outline; but he guessed that they must be well down the Berwick
  coast, seeing that they had rounded the Bass in the early morning. The threat
  of Mr. Berritch had no special terrors for him, his misdeeds were out of the
  region of actual crime, and in any case Berwick was too far away for
  punishment. But, unless he liked to face a ship's crew and captain with the
  bare sword, he would be carried ignominiously into harbour, and find himself
  stranded purposeless once more in his own land. And yet he would never pay
  the money, he reflected, as he became cognisant of his own root of pride. He
  had sudden yearnings towards virtue, produced by his sudden disgust at
  villainy in another. But above all the bitterness rose highest that he should
  be thus frustrated in the first glamour of his hopes.</p>

  <p>The gallant Mr. Stark came up with consolations&mdash;not without
  timidity. His respect for his companion had grown hugely in the last minutes,
  and he was disposed himself to assume something of a haughty bearing. But he
  got no word from the sullen figure at the bulwarks, till he had exhausted his
  vocabulary of condolence.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Birkenshaw," said he, "I hae a word to say to ye anent your ways o'
  getting to France. I haena your experience, but I can see wi' my ain een that
  this road is no the safest. If ye were to land at Berwick, it's no abune
  ninety mile across the country to the west. Ye could walk it in three days,
  and there ye'd find a boat to set ye ower for something less than this man's
  twenty guineas."</p>

  <p>Francis flamed up in wrath. "And ye would have me carried ashore like a
  greeting child! No, by God, though I have to sweem for it, that man and his
  folk will never lay their tarry hands on me," and he stared fiercely into the
  mist.</p>

  <p>But as he looked and meditated some fragments of a plan began to grow up
  in his brain. It would be little to his disadvantage to cross the land and
  embark from the west. It would save him the intolerable humiliation of a
  voyage in Mr. Berritch's company and another scene of wrangling at the end.
  Moreover, it would save him money, and somewhere in Francis, now that he was
  cast on himself, there lurked a trace of the old Birkenshaw providence.
  Again, it would keep up his reputation in the eyes of Starkie and his own
  self-respect; both weighty considerations for a vain man. But the matter of
  the landing still stuck in his throat and had all but driven him to the paths
  of virtue.</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Stark spoke out with resolution.</p>

  <p>"It maitters little to me what way I gang, and I thocht o' offering ye my
  company. Twae men are aye better than yin, and I ken the Westlands." The boy
  spoke with a fine air of the heroical which took the other's fancy. The offer
  screwed Francis's decision to the point of some crazy piece of bravado, and
  none the less stirred some hidden generosity.</p>

  <p>"I have taken a great liking to ye, Mr. Stark," he replied with
  condescension, "and I own I'll be glad o' your company. But there's one thing
  I must tell you if ye would come with me. If when we come to Berwick they
  offer to put hands on me and set me in their bit boat, there and then I gang
  overboard and sweem ashore. Are you fit for the ploy, Mr. Stark?"</p>

  <p>"Sweem," cried the other, joyfully, seeing in this a chance of bravery
  without peril. "I was bred aside the sea, and I've leeved in the water since
  I was a bairn."</p>

  <p>It might have been five in the afternoon, but in the misty weather it was
  hard to guess the time. They were coasting near the land, for the light
  breeze was clear behind them, and the water lay deep under the shadow of the
  craggy shore. Through the haze they could discern the red face of the cliffs,
  thatched with green and founded on a chaos of boulders. Even there they heard
  the lip of water on the beach above the ceaseless hiss of rain. Gulls hung
  uneasily about their track, and through the damp air came the cry of
  sandpipers, thin and far. It was mournful weather, and the heart of the
  soaked and angry Francis suffered momentary desolation.</p>

  <p>But he was recalled to action by the harsh voice of Mr. Berritch behind
  him. "Well, my lad," said the captain, "are ye in a better frame o' mind?
  Yonder's Berwick and mouth o' Tweed, and yonder ye gang if ye dinna dae my
  bidding. So if we are to continue our way thegether, I'll trouble you for
  your guineas, Mr. Birkenshaw."</p>

  <p>Francis looked over the gunwale to the low shore, not three hundred yards
  off. A glimpse of house and wall to the left showed where the town began. To
  hesitate would be to end all his bravado in smoke, so he glanced with meaning
  at the excited Starkie and spoke up with creditable boldness,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I told ye before, I'm thinking, Mr. Berritch, that you would get no
  guineas of mine, and I'm no used to go back on my word."</p>

  <p>"Then we'll hae the boat," said the captain. "Geordie, get the boat
  oot."</p>

  <p>"And I have something more to say to ye, ye thief o' a Fife packman. Ye've
  matched me this time with your promises and smirks, but I'll win my ways
  without ye and pay ye for a' this and mair some day. So I'll bid ye good-day,
  Mr. Berritch, till our next meeting."</p>

  <p>And with this tearful defiance he was over the bulwarks, followed by the
  dauntless Stark, leaving the grim Mr. Berritch someway between irritation and
  laughter. Two heads dipped on the misty waters, and a little after two
  mortals were wringing their clothes on the sanded beach.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>
  A Journey in Late Summer.</h2>

  <p class="first">The cold of the water dispersed Francis' high sentiments. He
  shook himself ruefully, and looked back at the dim outline of the ship. The
  journey had fairly tired him, and it vexed him to see Starkie, the better
  swimmer, as active as ever. But by the time he had wrung his clothes and
  shaken the salt from his hair his spirits had returned, and with the other at
  his heel he clambered up the bank of red earth and made for the nearest
  houses.</p>

  <p>The darkening was already on the fall, and the roofs of the town shone
  faint over a field of corn. The plashing Mr. Francis had no care to find a
  road, but held straight through the crops with a fine disregard of ownership.
  At the end they came to a low stone dyke, and beyond it a muddy road of the
  same unfriendly colour of soil. Thence the cobbles began and a line of little
  houses, stretching steeply down to what seemed a wide grey flood. For a
  second Francis' heart quickened with interest. This was the great river of
  Tweed, from whose banks came his family and his name. The sight momentarily
  enlivened for him the listless scene and the clammy weather.</p>

  <p>Both were hungry and cold, and there was little cause to be finical in the
  matter of lodging; for to both these young adventurers thriftiness was
  something of a noble quality, and they sought to husband their present
  resources. So they went boldly to the first door in the line of houses and
  sought admittance.</p>

  <p>A woman came, a tall, harsh-featured woman of forty and more, with her
  arms bare and her coats kilted. She stared at the intruders with incivility,
  and waited their question.</p>

  <p>"Can you give us a bed for the night, mistress? We are two seafaring men
  who came ashore the day and are ettlin' to travel up the water to our hames.
  We're unco wet and famished, and will pay ye for all that ye may gie us."</p>

  <p>"Whatna vessel came ye aff?" said the woman, with suspicion in her
  eye.</p>

  <p>"The 'Kern' o' Leith," said Francis, readily.</p>

  <p>"And whaur may your hames be?"</p>

  <p>"In Yarrow at the Tinnies' Burnfoot," seizing upon the only place of which
  he had heard the names.</p>

  <p>"The Tinnies' Burn," said the woman, meditatively. "There were Scotts in
  it in my time, but I heard they had flitted. Ye'll be some o' the new folk.
  Come in, and I'll see what I can dae for ye!"</p>

  <p>And she led the ready pair into the kitchen.</p>

  <p>The place was high and wide, with cobwebbed, smoke-grimed rafters and a
  searching odour of comfort. But soon the heat drew the salt fumes from the
  wet garments, and the place smelt like a ship's cabin. The woman sniffed and
  bustled angrily. Then with some brusqueness she bade them get up to the
  garret and put on her husband's breeks, for she would have no sailor-folk
  making her kitchen like the harbour-end.</p>

  <p>Dry clothes and the plain warm meal which followed restored the two to
  their natural cheerfulness. They sat by the fire and fell to speaking in low
  tones about their way overland to the West. It was an ill-timed action, for
  the housewife's suspicious ears caught names which she liked ill, and the
  whispering made her uneasy. She came over to the ingle and with arms squared
  broke in on the talk.</p>

  <p>"What garred ye come ashore sae ill set-up, lads? I've seen mony
  sailor-men, but nane sae puirly fitted as yoursels."</p>

  <p>"We're juist ashore for a wee," said Francis. "We got the chance o'
  winnin' hame and we took it. Twae days will bring us to Yarrow, twae days
  back, and by that time the 'Kern' 'ill be lying loadin' in the harbour. It
  wasna an errand to tak ony plenishing wi' us."</p>

  <p>The woman laughed sardonically. "What bit o' the harbour did ye lie in?"
  said she.</p>

  <p>Francis was at a loss, and cast about warily for an answer.</p>

  <p>"I've never been here but the yince," said he, "so I canna just tell ye
  richt. But we cam maybe a hundred yairds up the river and syne cast anchor by
  the richt wall."</p>

  <p>Again the woman laughed. "And how did ye win up the river? Did ye a' get
  oot and shove the boat wi' your shouthers?"</p>

  <p>"Are you daft, wife?" said the dumbfoundered Mr. Stark.</p>

  <p>"No, my lad," said she; "but ye're the daft anes to come to me wi' a story
  like that. The river the noo is no three feet deep a' ower wi' sands and the
  shift o' the tide-bar. Ye're nae sailors. I warrant ye dinna ken a boom frae
  a cuddie's tail, and yet ye come here wi' your talk o' sailors. Na, I'll tell
  ye what ye are. Ye're Hielandmen or French, I'll no say which, but ye're ower
  here on nae guid errand. Ye cam frae a ship; but it was in a boat under the
  Tranen rocks. Oot o' my house ye gang, and ye may bless the Lord I dinna rin
  ye to the Provost."</p>

  <p>The woman stood frowning above them, so clearly mistress of the situation
  that the hearts of the two wanderers sank. The soul of Mr. Stark, already
  raised high with vague belief in his comrade's dark and terrible designs, was
  genuinely alarmed by this shrewd reading of purpose. He looked to see Francis
  falter and stammer, and when he saw his face still calm and inscrutable, his
  voice yet unshaken, he bowed in spirit before a master.</p>

  <p>As for Francis, he followed the broad path of denial.</p>

  <p>"Hielandman or French," he cried with a laugh. "Is't like, think ye, when
  I haena a plack to spare I should take up my heid wi' beggars' politics? Na,
  na, a Whig am I and my faither afore me. I wadna stir my thoomb for a' the
  Charlies that ever whistled. Gin this were a change-house, mistress, and a
  bowl o' yill were on the board afore me, ye wad see me drink damnation to a'
  Pretenders, and health to King Geordie."</p>

  <p>His words were so violent and so honestly given that the woman looked
  momentarily satisfied. "I've maybe mista'en ye," she said; "but at ony rate,
  whatever ye are, ye're shameless leears."</p>

  <p>"Maybe we are, gudewife," said Francis, with ingratiating candour; "but
  for us wandering men we never ken when we are wi' freends. The truth o' the
  maitter is that we cast oot wi' the Captain, and have e'en ta'en the road to
  the West whaur we'll find another ship. Ye'll forgie us the lee,
  mistress?"</p>

  <p>"Ye look like honest men," said the woman, slowly and hesitatingly. "You
  at ony rate," and she turned to Francis. "Ye've far ower long and sarious a
  face to be a blagyird."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In the morning they were up betimes, and ready for the road.
  The shadow of Mr. Berritch still hung over both, and a dim mist of suspicion
  was in the atmosphere of the dwelling. The final affront came at parting.
  Francis, with conscious honesty, offered payment for the night's lodging. The
  woman haggled and raised the price till she had all but angered him; then,
  with a hearty slap on the back, she bade him begone and live like an honest
  man. "D' ye think," said she, "I wad tak payment frae twae forwandered
  callants? Gang your ways, man, and try gin ye can be as honest as ye're
  bonny." And her laugh rang in his ears as he went down the street.</p>

  <p>At first, the glory of the morning set his spirits high. They were already
  on the western outskirts of the town, where the grey sea-beat tenements
  dwindle to outlying cottages which stare abruptly over meadowland and river.
  The September haze was rising in furling battalions before the wind, and the
  salt ocean air strove with the serener fragrance of shorn hay-fields. There
  was something extraordinarily fresh and blithe in the wide landscape falling
  to the eye under the blue, and the bitter crispness of morn. Insensibly their
  limbs moved faster, they flung back their shoulders, and with open mouth and
  head erect drank in the life-giving air.</p>

  <p>But as they plodded on, Francis soon fell into the clutches of memory, and
  his reflections pleased him little. The whole thought of the day before was
  full of irritation. On the threshold of high-handed adventure he had met with
  a closed door, and had been driven to a poverty-stricken compromise. Hitherto
  in dark moments of self-revelation he had buoyed himself with a flattering
  picture of a keen brain and a dauntless will. Now, both seemed to have failed
  grievously; he had been tricked and laughed at by a peddling sailor. Even the
  rhetorical parting did not comfort him. Seen in the cold light of day it
  seemed crude and boyish. He could have torn his tongue out with rage when he
  thought on the grinning Mr. Berritch and the gaping crew.</p>

  <p>But more than this folly, he regretted his lapse from his first
  resolution. The fine renunciation of virtue which he had performed two nights
  before on the doorstep of his home was rapidly being made of no avail. He had
  been betrayed into compromise, into honesty. The words of the woman at
  Berwick still rang in his ears. She had clearly taken him for some truant
  apprentice, some temporary recreant from the respectable. The thought was
  gall and wormwood. He, the master, the scorner of the domestic, the Ulysses
  and Autolycus to be! And&mdash;alas for human consistency!&mdash;there was
  still another trouble of a vastly different kind. In one matter he was
  ashamed of deception. He had worn the badge of whiggery in the eyes of Mr.
  Stark, and though the need for the step had been apparent, he could not
  divest his mind of some faint scruples, the relics of an earlier ideal of
  gentility.</p>

  <p>The result of such meditations was to drive the meditator into a fine bad
  temper, which he proceeded to vent on the ill-fated Starkie. This gentleman
  had spoken little, being filled with thoughts of his own. Somewhere in his
  curious nature was a strain of sentiment, which revelled in cheap emotions
  and the commonplaces of memory. The charms of Kate Mallison still held her
  fugitive lover, and as he travelled he lingered pleasantly over her face and
  figure, and formed his mouth to words of endearment. The virulence of his
  companion did not disturb him. For this he had made up his mind long ago.
  After all, if one seeks a great man as a friend, one must be prepared to bear
  with his humours. And when Francis, roused by memories of his fall into
  virtue, talked shrilly of desperate plans, Starkie inclined a deaf, yet
  willing ear, and went on with his fancies.</p>

  <p>But by and by with the hours, another feeling grew upon the elder's mind.
  The road ran among low birches with a sombre regiment of pines flanking it on
  the right. Through the spaces gleamed the blue sky, pale with the light haze
  of September, and on the left among reeds and willows twined and crooned the
  great streams of Tweed. Francis was diverted against himself, and, ere ever
  he knew, the old glamour of the countryside had fallen upon him. He, too, it
  was his proud reflection, was a son of this land, born of a family whose name
  was old as the hills and waters. The ancient nameless charm which slumbered
  with the green hillsides, flashed in the streams, and hung over the bare
  mosses, stole unbeknown into his soul, and the stout Francis was led captive
  by the poetry of the common world.</p>

  <p>The mood lasted till near evening, when they slept at a little public
  somewhere by Leader-foot. In the morn they were early awake, for those days
  of delay in their own land were irksome to both. Now they were in a stranger
  country, where hills came down to the water's edge, and the distance showed
  lines of blue mountain. The weather was still the placid and soothing warmth
  of a late summer with roads running white and dry before them, and the quiet
  broken only by the sounds of leisured, rustic toil. For the nonce the
  bustling fervour died in Francis' breast, and he took his way through the
  gracious valley in a pleasant torpor of spirit.</p>

  <p>But by midday, all this was driven to the winds by the conduct of Mr.
  Stark. This gentleman, awakened from his sentiments of yesterday, fell to the
  purposeless chatter in which he specially excelled. Thence, finding his
  companion irresponsive, he glided naturally to the plotting of mischief. He
  had some desire to vindicate his name of adventurer in the eyes of his
  saturnine friend. So he cast about him for a fitting object.</p>

  <p>Now ill luck sent him an opportunity at once too facile and too mean, for,
  when the pair stopped at a wayside cottage for water, he adroitly contrived
  to filch a cut of dried beef from the wooden dresser. In glee he showed it to
  Francis as they halted at midday a mile beyond. He expected approval, or at
  the least tolerance; but his reception sorely discomfited him, for to
  Francis, the thing appeared so aimlessly childish, so petty, that his gorge
  rose at the sight. It was the act of a knavish boy, and the whole soul of
  this man of affairs was stirred to anger. If there was any flicker of honesty
  in the feeling it was sternly suppressed, but to the disgust he gave full
  rein.</p>

  <p>"What for did ye do that?" he asked fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Oh, juist to keep my hand in, belike," said the Westlander.</p>

  <p>"Ye damnable bairn," cried Francis, "d' ye call this a man's work, robbing
  auld wives of their meat, when ye have no need of it? I'll learn ye better.
  Come back with me, see, this minute, and if ye dinna pay her what she asks,
  you and me will quit company. D' ye think I will have ye running at my heels
  like a thieving collie?"</p>

  <p>The elder man had too menacing a brow and angry tone for the feeble Mr.
  Stark to resist. He followed him grumbling, and suffered to be led like a
  sheep within the cottage. The place was bare and poor; the woman, thin and
  white as a bone, and long fallen in the vale of years.</p>

  <p>"My friend happened to lift something o' yours, mistress, and we e'en came
  to pay ye for it," and Francis regarded the strange place with some pity.</p>

  <p>"Were ye starvin', lads?" she asked in a piping voice, "for if sae ye may
  keep the meat and welcome. But it wad hae been mair faisable to speir."</p>

  <p>But, try they their best, she would take no payment, and they had to leave
  in despair. The thing put both into an ill humour. Starkie nursed a
  grievance, and Francis had much the same temper as the Christian who laments
  the failure of judgment upon the wicked. They spoke no words, but stalked
  silently on different sides of the road, with averted eyes and tragic
  bearing.</p>

  <p>But continued surliness was little in Starkie's way. At the end of half an
  hour he was jocose and making farcical overtures to friendship. When he found
  his efforts repulsed, he comforted himself with a song, and when in a little
  they came to a village and a public, turned gladly to the relief of drink.
  Now, whether it was that the landlord's whisky had extraordinary qualities or
  that Starkie drank a wondrous amount, it is certain that ere he had gone far
  it became clear that he was grossly drunk.</p>

  <p>Thence the course of the two became troubled and uncertain. Starkie drew
  up to the other in maudlin amity. Francis had drunk little and his gloomy
  temper still held him. He had never loved drunkenness, and at the moment his
  thoughts dwelt on the failure of his plans. So he sent Mr. Stark to the devil
  with no mincing words. With drunken gravity Starkie retorted, and then with
  more drunken heroism squared himself to fight. The patience of Francis fairly
  gave way. Gripping his assailant by the collar and breeches he tossed him
  easily to the roadside.</p>

  <p>"Lie there, ye drunken swine," he cried, "and I'm glad I'm quit o'
  ye."</p>

  <p>So, pursued by thickly-uttered reproaches, he hastened forward alone.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">With the next dawn Francis found himself on the confines of
  great hills, where the river, now shrunk to a stream, foamed in a narrowed
  vale. The weather had changed with the night to cloud and cold, and the even
  drizzle of a Scots mist obscured the sun. The slopes gloomed black and wet,
  every burn was red with flood, and the sparse trees dripped in dreary
  silence. The place was singularly dispiriting, for nought met the eye but the
  mire underfoot and the murky folds of mist.</p>

  <p>Early in the day he stopped a passing shepherd and asked him his
  whereabouts. He was told with great wealth of detail which further befogged
  his mind. Then on a sudden impulse he asked where lay Yarrow and the
  Birkenshaw Tower. "D' ye see that hill ower the water?" was the answer.
  "That's the Grey Drannock, and the far side o' 't looks straucht down on the
  Yarrow water." This then was the confines of his own land, these were haply
  his forefathers' hills; a sudden pride went through his heart, but the next
  moment he was looking drearily on his lamentable fortunes.</p>

  <p>He was sick of himself, disgusted with his ill-success, and half inclined
  to rue his parting with Mr. Stark. Where were his fine resolutions? All
  vanishing into air under the blast of his spasmodic virtues. As he looked
  back on the events of the past days he was driven by his present sourness
  especially to loathe his glimpses of decency. The dismal weather helped to
  harden him. After all, he reflected, the world is a battle-ground, where he
  wins who is least saddled with the baggage of virtue. Man preys upon man; I
  may expect no mercy from others; and none shall others get from me. So it was
  with fierce purpose and acrid temper that Francis travelled through the
  clammy weather. It had been Starkie, he thought with irritation, and not
  himself that had the true spirit; and he cursed the hour when he had left the
  little Westlander in the ditch.</p>

  <p>By the evening it cleared and the sun set stormily over monstrous blue
  hills. He had passed through the town of Peebles in the early afternoon, and
  now followed the wide western road up the green pastoral dale of the upper
  Tweed. The dusk was drawing on as he left the river and took the path which
  ran to Ayr by Lanark and Clyde. Just at the darkening the lights of a little
  village beckoned him,&mdash;a line of white houses and a cluster of rowans by
  a burnside. His legs were growing weary, and he had not yet supped; so he
  turned to the inn to bide the night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>
  The Portrait of a Lady.</h2>

  <p class="first">In such rough and casual fashion Francis came to his
  Destiny. But to him there was little sign of aught momentous. The inn-kitchen
  was half-filled with men talking boisterously, while the landlord's deep
  tones gave directions to the serving-girl. The noise of soft south-country
  talk came pleasantly on his ears after the clip-clap of the Fife, and a
  wholesome smell of food and drink comforted his senses.</p>

  <p>He sat by himself in a corner, for he was in the mood to shun publicity.
  Supper was brought him, and then he lit a pipe and stretched his legs to the
  fire, since already the evenings grew chilly. In this lethargic comfort his
  follies ceased to trouble him, and he tasted the delights of wearied
  ease.</p>

  <p>But as the hour grew late the room cleared, and Francis awoke to interest
  in his surroundings. He asked the landlord what the place might be.</p>

  <p>He was told, "Brochtoun."</p>

  <p>The name stuck in his memory. Broughton&mdash;he had heard it somewhere,
  linked with some name which had slipped his recollection. He asked who owned
  the land.</p>

  <p>"Murray," was the answer, "Murray o' Brochtoun, kin to them o' Stanhope. A
  graceless lot, aye plottin' and conspirin' wi' them that's better no named.
  Even now him and his leddy wife are awa to the North, trokin' wi' the wild
  Jaicobites and French." The landlord's politics were clear and vehement.</p>

  <p>At the word Francis sat up in earnest. Murray of Broughton was already a
  noted name in the land, the catchword of the whole tribe of needy loyalists,
  reputed to be the confidant and companion of the Prince himself. And in every
  Edinburgh tavern he had heard the toast of the beautiful Mrs. Murray given
  with drunken leers and unedifying tales. If all stories were true, she was a
  lady of uncommon parts and spirit and not too nice a conscience. This, then,
  was the home of the Murrays on which he, the out-at-elbows adventurer, had
  stumbled. As he thought of himself he felt a singular antipathy to this tribe
  of aristocrats,&mdash;doubtless filled with pride of race and the fantastic
  notions of honour from which he had parted for ever.</p>

  <p>The thought had scarce left him when a man who had been sitting at the
  door came up and touched his sleeve from behind. He turned to find a face
  familiar to him,&mdash;a little man with ferret eyes and bushy eyebrows,
  poverty staring from the rents in his coat. He knew him for a chance
  acquaintance in that lowest deep of city life to which he had made some few
  excursions.</p>

  <p>"D' ye no mind me?" said the man, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I've seen ye before," said Francis, ungraciously.</p>

  <p>"Dod Craik," said the man, "I'm Dod Craik. Ye mind Dod Craik. I've seen ye
  at the <i>Pirliewow</i> and <i>M'Gowks</i> and the <i>Three Herrins</i>, and,
  d' ye no mind, ye aince betted me twa crouns I couldna find my way across the
  street ae nicht when I was blind-fou. Ay, and I stottit the hale length o'
  that lang vennel and fell under a baillie's coach and was ta'en aff to jail."
  And the wretched creature laughed with the humour of it.</p>

  <p>"Well, supposing I mind you, Mr. Craik," said the unbending Francis, "I'll
  trouble ye to tell me what ye want. If it's siller, ye'll get none from me,
  for I'm as toom as a kirk plate."</p>

  <p>"It's no siller," cried the man. "Na, na, from a' I hear ye're just a
  venturer like mysel'. But it's a thing wi' siller in 't, and I thocht ye
  micht like to hae a finger in the job."</p>

  <p>The notion pleased, and Francis held out a relenting hand to the little
  man. "If that's your talk, Mr. Craik, then I am with you."</p>

  <p>"Then maybe ye could step ootside wi' me for the maitter o' a few
  meenutes," said the other, and the two went forth into the street.</p>

  <p>The man led Francis out of the light of the houses into the gloom of the
  birk-lined road. "I kenned aye ye were a man o' speerit and withoot
  prejudices, Mr. Birkenshaw," he began.</p>

  <p>"Let my spirit and prejudices alone," said Francis, shortly.</p>

  <p>"And wi' nae scruples how ye cam by money if aince ye but had it."</p>

  <p>"Man, will ye come to the point?" said Francis, who was in doubt whether
  to be pleased or angry at this narration of attributes.</p>

  <p>"Weel, it's this. The Hoose o' Brochtoun is standin' toom or as guid as
  toom, save for a servant or twae. It's kenned that Murray is in league wi'
  rebels and has the keepin' o' their gold. It's beyond credibeelity that he
  can hae ta'en it to the North wi' him, so it maun be left here. Now I propose
  that you and me as guid subjects find a road intil the hoose and lay our
  hands on thae ill-gotten gains. I've lang had this ploy in my heid, and I had
  trysted wi' anither man for the nicht, but he's failed me. The short and lang
  o' the maitter is that the job's ower big for ae man, so when I got a glisk
  o' ye, I made up my mind to gie ye the chance." He waited nervously for the
  answer.</p>

  <p>Francis flushed for the moment. "D' ye ken what ye ask me to do, Mr.
  Craik?" said he. "It's a job that some folk would call house-breaking and
  stouthrief."</p>

  <p>"Na," said the other, "it's no that. It's the lawfu' consequence o'
  poleetical principles. Think ye, if the sodgers in Embro had word o' siccan a
  thing they wadna be the first to tak it? If ye believe me, Mr. Birkenshaw,
  it's a naational necessity."</p>

  <p>"But what do ye ken of my principles?" asked Francis. "Who telled ye I
  wasna as hot a Jacobite as Murray himself?"</p>

  <p>The man looked shrewdly at his neighbour to detect his purpose. Then he
  laughed incredulously. "Gae awa wi' ye and your havers. Ye were aye ower fond
  o' a saft seat and a bieldy corner."</p>

  <p>For a little Francis stood in a sorry hesitation, in two minds whether to
  join forces with this house-breaker or there and then to give him the
  soundest of thrashings. His parting with Starkie still rankled in his mind.
  He called up the designs which he had formed for himself, his abhorrence of
  trivial virtue, his deification of the unscrupulous. This was a chance both
  to better his means and restore his confidence. This would be the rubicon
  over which there was no returning to the dreary paths of the respectable. His
  course was clear, and yet with a vanishing pride he could have beaten this
  little city blackguard who called him companion.</p>

  <p>So he told Mr. Craik of his compliance, and was rewarded with a sigh of
  relief. "Man, I kenned ye wad dae 't, and noo we're shure o' success. Come
  down the road till I tell ye the ways o' 't. I've been hereabouts for days
  till I ken ilka turn o' the place. The Hoose looks north ower a dean o' trees
  and a' to the south is the whinny back o' a hill. There's naether windy nor
  door kept lockit the noo on that gairden side, for at a' hoors there's a
  steer o' men comin' and leavin'." And with a crowd of such directions he led
  him into the shade.</p>

  <p>It was clear that Murray's folk had small liking for their laird. There in
  the inn sat Whiggery triumphant, smiled upon by a Calvinist landlord and a
  score of staunch Presbyterian followers. Further down the water the Cause
  found many adherents, but there, on the very confines of the West, there was
  something dour and covenanting in the air, and the fervours of the master and
  his lady awoke no spirit among the men of Broughton. Had two such characters
  as Mr. Craik and Francis been seen in an Athole or Badenoch inn they would
  have been jealously spied upon; but there they were suffered to go their
  ways, and in a corner of the inn over their glasses they brought the project
  to completion.</p>

  <p>An hour later the two men were climbing the brae which rose from the green
  haughs of the burn to the upland valley where stood the house. Francis had
  the same free stride as ever, but Mr. Craik hastened over the brighter
  patches of moonlight and stole gladly to the shadows. To himself Francis
  seemed something less worthy than before. The mist of daring and escapade,
  with which he fancied his course to be shrouded, had begun to disappear under
  the cold north wind of Mr. Craik's company. He had set out on the ploy for
  money and self-satisfaction; but soon he wished that he had come alone, for
  his disgust rose at the sight of the ferret-faced thing which led him.</p>

  <p>Soon they were on the bare hill-face and looking down upon the back
  windows of the dwelling. To the left there was light in the lower windows,
  where probably dwelt the few domestics, but otherwise the whole of the great
  wall was black with darkness. Mr. Craik chuckled joyfully and led the way
  across the garden fence and down an alley of flowers. At the edge of the lawn
  he stopped and held a whispered consultation.</p>

  <p>"That windy forenent us is never barred; the lock's broke, for I was up
  last nicht to find oot. Now if ye gang in there ye come to a passage which
  takes ye to the maister's ain room. It's no the first door but the second on
  the left-hand side, and there he keeps his siller and valuables. It's aye
  lockit, but I've trystit wi' a servant lass to leave the key in the door.
  Aince ye won there, ye wad lock the thing on the inside and search the place
  at your leesure. Syne ye wad come back to me and I wad help ye oot. The
  reason why twae man's needit is that the windy canna open frae within, and if
  there werena ane oot bye to lift it, there wad be nae mainner o' escape. Now,
  whilk is to gang and whilk is to bide?" and he took a coin from his pocket to
  toss.</p>

  <p>"Ye'd better let me try it," said Francis. "I'm bigger and stronger, and
  maybe I've a better eye for a hidy-hole." Already he was beginning to loathe
  the business, and chose this part of it as the less discreditable. It was
  better to have his hand at the work than to wait outside like a child.</p>

  <p>"Man, ye've speerit," said the other, admiringly and not without
  gratitude. Fear had already begun to wrestle with his avarice.</p>

  <p>So Francis raised the window, which fitted like a portcullis into a socket
  above. His companion held it open till his long legs had struggled through.
  He found himself in a narrow corridor, pitchy dark, save for the glimmer from
  the window. A musty smell, as of an old and little-used house, hung all about
  it, and his groping feet detected an uneven floor. An utter silence
  prevailed, in which as from a great distance he heard the click of the shut
  window.</p>

  <p>He felt out with his hand along the left wall. One door he passed, of
  stout ribbed oak securely fastened. Then the place widened, and he seemed to
  be in a hall with some kind of matting upon the floor. Here his feet went
  noiselessly, and some faint degree of light obtained from a window far in
  front. Then his hand came on the space of a second door, and he stopped to
  test it. This was clearly the place where the key was to be found, as Mr.
  Craik had directed.</p>

  <p>But this was no less closely bolted than the last, and the key-hole was
  empty. He put his shoulders to the panel and shook it. He heard only the rasp
  of a great lock in its place, but the door did not give an inch. Again he
  tried, and this time the wood work cracked. But the noise warned him, echoing
  in that still place with double power, and he desisted.</p>

  <p>Nothing remained but to try elsewhere, so he groped further down the hall.
  Again he touched a handle, and this time with better success; for to his
  amazement he found the door ajar, and pushing it open entered a wide room. He
  turned to look for a key, but found none; this, too, was not the place
  appointed; but since he had found an entrance he resolved to go further. The
  place was black with night. A dim haze of light seemed to hang at the end,
  which doubtless came from a shuttered window. As he groped his way he
  stumbled on furniture which felt rich and softly draped to the touch. A faint
  odour of food, too, lurked in the air, as if the room had been used for
  dining.</p>

  <p>This was not the goal which he had sought, but even here something might
  be found. So Francis was in the act of beginning a hasty scrutiny when a
  sound brought him to a stop. A footstep was crossing the hall and making for
  the room. A pioneer ray of light gleamed below the door. He was in a
  quandary, uncertain whither to turn; he could not flee by the door, and no
  other way was apparent. To hide behind some curtain or cabinet was possible,
  and he was about to creep hastily to the back when a hand was laid on the
  latch. Some instinct prompted him to sink quietly into a chair and wait the
  issue.</p>

  <p>The light of a lamp flooded the room, showing its noble size and costly
  furnishing. Francis sat silent in his chair, curious of the result, and
  busily searching his brains for some plausible tale. The light-bearer saw at
  the table-end a long man, his face dark with the sun, dressed decently yet
  with marks of travel, and bearing somewhere in his dress and demeanour the
  stamp of a townsman, who sat waiting on the newcomer's question with eyes
  half apologetic and half bold.</p>

  <p>As for Francis himself he saw a vision which left him dumb. He had
  expected the sight of a servant or at most some gentleman of the cause using
  the house as a lodging. But to his wonder, at the doorway stood a woman
  holding a lamp above her and looking full from its canopy of light into the
  half-darkness. In the dimness she seemed tall and full of grace, standing
  alert and stately with a great air of queenship. Her gown was of soft white
  satin, falling in shining folds to her feet, and showing the tender curves of
  arm and bosom. Above, at the throat and wrists, her skin was white as milk,
  and the hair rose in dark masses on her head, framing her wonderful
  face,&mdash;pale with the delicate paleness so far above roses. Something in
  her eye, in the haughty carriage of the little head, in the life and grace
  which lay in every curve and motion, took suddenly from Francis the power of
  thought. He looked in silent amazement at this goddess from the void.</p>

  <p>He had waited for surprise, anger, even fear; but to his wonder he found
  only recognition. She looked on him as if she had come there for no other
  purpose than to seek him. A kindly condescension, the large condescension of
  one born to rule and be obeyed, was in her demeanour.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are here," she said. "I thought you had not come. You are my Lord
  Manorwater's servant?"</p>

  <p>For an instant Francis' wits wandered at the suddenness of the question.
  Then his readiness returned, and with some shrewdness he grasped the state of
  matters. He rose hurriedly to his feet and bowed with skill. "I have that
  honour, my lady," said he; and he reflected that his sober dress would suit
  the character.</p>

  <p>As he stood a tumult of thoughts rushed through his brain. This was the
  famous lady whom he had so often heard of, she who was the Cause, the Prince,
  and the King to so many loyal gentlemen. His eyes gloried in her beauty, for
  somewhere in his hard nature there was an ecstatic joy in mere loveliness.
  But the bodily perfection was but a drop in the cup of his astonishment. She
  had clearly been receiving guests in this old house, and guests of quality,
  for the rich white gown was like a state dress, and jewels flashed at her
  neck and fingers. A swift and violent longing seized him to be one of her
  company, to see her before him, to be called her friend. In her delicate
  grace she seemed the type of all he had renounced for ever&mdash;nay, not
  renounced, for in his turbid boyhood he had had no glimpse of it. To this
  wandering and lawless man for one second the elegancies of life were filled
  with charm, and he sighed after the unattainable. Then his mood changed to
  one of fierce revulsion. This was a lady of rank and wealth, doubtless with a
  crazy pride of place and honour, condescending gravely to him as to one far
  beneath; and he, he was the careless, the indomitable, who would yet laugh in
  the face of the whole orderly world.</p>

  <p>But such sentimental reflections were soon succeeded by thoughts more
  practical. He had run his head into a difficult place, and might yet escape
  by this lucky chance which called him a servant of Lord Manorwater's. But
  there was little time to lose, lest the real lackey should come to confront
  him. His ready brain was already busy with plans when the lady spoke
  again.</p>

  <p>"Your master will have told you your errand. This is the letter which I
  desire you to carry and put into the hands of Mr. Murray of Broughton at his
  lodging in the Northgate of Edinburgh. Your master told me you have travelled
  the same road before to the same place."</p>

  <p>Francis said "Ay."</p>

  <p>"Then I have but one word for you. Take the hills from here and keep off
  the high-road, above all near the inn of Leidburn. For I have heard to-night
  that a body of rebel soldiers is lying there. When you come to my husband, he
  will give you his directions, whether to go with him and the royal army or to
  return here. But in any case I can trust the diligence and loyalty of one of
  my Lord Manorwater's men." And she smiled on him graciously.</p>

  <p>"And they brought you in here and left you in darkness," she said, as if
  in self-reproach. "It is a hard thing to live in such troubled times. And
  perhaps you have not supped?"</p>

  <p>Francis protested that he had already had food, in mortal fear lest she
  should delay him with refreshment.</p>

  <p>"I will let you out myself," she said, and lifting the lamp she led the
  way from the room, her soft skirts trailing and the light flickering in her
  dusky hair. Francis followed in a fervour of delight. The sudden vista of a
  great plan had driven all sentiment from his mind. Now at last he might get
  free of petty ill-doing, and exercise his wits on matters of greater import.
  He carried a letter which meant money from any officer of Government; he
  scented plot and intrigue all richly flavoured with peril. He felt himself no
  more the casual amateur, but the established adventurer, meddling with the
  great affairs of nations. The thought restored him to his perverted
  self-respect.</p>

  <p>She opened the hall-door and let him pass into the front garden with a
  word of good-speed. As he departed he turned for a moment, and his sentiment
  flickered to life, for as she stood, a radiant figure of light in the arch of
  the door, his mind reverted to this great loveliness.</p>

  <p>But a second later such thoughts had fled, and, with no care for the
  patient Mr. Craik waiting silently by the back window, Francis took his path
  for the highway and the Leidburn inn.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>
  On the Edinburgh Highway.</h2>

  <p class="first">The moon was up, whitening the long highway to the north, as
  Francis sped gaily on. It was still early night; lengthy hours were to come
  before the dawn; and Leidburn inn was no more than a dozen miles. But the
  exhilaration of escape, of new hope, drove him with eager legs, and he
  watched the trees fall away and the barer hills draw together with pride in
  his fleet strength.</p>

  <p>At the watershed the moors stretched dim and yellow on either hand in a
  melancholy desolation. A curlew piped on the bent, and then all was still as
  the grave but for the clack of his shoes on the hill-gravel. He fell out of
  his run and took to the stride with which he had been wont to stalk through
  the back-vennels of the city. The soft odours of moorland weather hung about
  the place as over a shrine. The luminous sky above had scarcely a hint of
  dark, but shone like an ocean starred with windy isles in some twilight of
  the gods.</p>

  <p>His first resolution had grown and made itself clear in every part. He
  pictured gleefully the incidents of his course. The soldiers found, he called
  for their Captain and delivered his letter. The tide of war was turned, he
  was honoured with reward, and a life of bold intrigue awaited him. Exultantly
  he pictured his fate,&mdash;how the world would talk of him with fear, how
  his name would be on all men's lips and his terror in every heart. Then haply
  Mr. Francis Birkenshaw would set his heel on the neck of his oppressors.</p>

  <p>But his importunate common-sense drew him sharply back from his flights.
  It meant but a guinea for his pocket and a glass of wine for his thirst, for
  he could only pose as a lackey if he wished for credence. Yet even in this
  there was promise. It needed but his wits and his habitual bold presence to
  push his fortune far. Here, in his own land, lay his field. Far better to
  seize a spoke of Fate's wheel as she twirled it here than hunt the jade in
  nations oversea.</p>

  <p>The way led him through a bogland meadow and up again to the skirts of a
  hill. In a little he was among trees, whence came the chilly echo of running
  water and a gleam of light from some sequestered dwelling. Already a wider
  vale seemed to open and high, dark hill-shapes rose on the left. The road was
  wide and even, for by it men chiefly travelled to Carlisle and the South.
  Even as he sped a rumble of wheels came to his ear, and he was in the
  roadside heather watching a four-horse carriage go by. The horses seemed
  weary with forcing, and within the coach by the moonlight he had a glimpse of
  anxious faces. Lord Smitwood, or the great Lady Blaecastle, or the famous
  Mrs. Maxwell, he thought, on their way to put their sundry houses in order
  against an evil day. Clearly wars and rumours of war were thickening in the
  North, and he was soon to have a hand in the game.</p>

  <p>And with this he fell back on thoughts of Broughton and the lady of the
  Jacotot lace and dusky hair. Something in her image as it flashed on his
  memory roused keen exaltation. He would trick this proud woman and all her
  kind, crush them, use them for his purpose. Each feature, as he reflected on
  it, roused his hatred. She was fair; well, beauty for the joy of the strong.
  Men said she was clever; well, he would match her with counter-wits and gain
  the victory. Three hours before, and he had never seen her; now she filled
  his whole fancy with her hateful beauty. He thought of her freely, grossly,
  as he had trained himself to think of women. But somewhere in the man there
  was a string of fine sentiment which jarred at the incongruous. The exquisite
  freshness of her beauty forbade her a place in a gallery of harlots, and to
  his disgust he found himself forced to regard her with decency.</p>

  <p>The thing stuck in his memory and began to vex him. Vigorously he
  questioned himself if he were not falling back to his boyish virtue.
  Re-assured by the hot and lustful spirit within him, he searched for some
  catchword or badge of his resolve. So all the latter part of the way he
  hummed rags of ill-reputed ditties, and now and then in the near
  neighbourhood of a cottage made the night hideous with a tune. For he was now
  at the verge of settled country, where King George held a tight rein, and no
  loyalist gentry would be at hand with a bullet from the wayside. So leisurely
  had been his course that the autumn dawn was already breaking ere he rounded
  the hill and came out on the level Leidburn moss. The place was
  desert,&mdash;acres of peat with the film of morn still raw on the heather,
  and the black reaches of a lazy stream. But through the midst ran the
  fresh-coloured highway, and there, half a mile distant, rose the white walls
  of the inn. Even as he walked the thin air of dawn brought him the noise of
  hens' cackling and the first stir of life. Beyond all there stretched a great
  wide country of meadow and woodland to the horizon of the morning, the smoke
  of a city and the broad curve of the sea.</p>

  <p>The scene was so airy and clear that Francis fell into a rich good-humour
  with himself, and drew near to the inn with pleasant confidence. He had
  expected to find some traces of military, some neighing from the stable or
  bustle of servants, but to his wonder the house was silent. The kitchen door
  stood open, and through it he passed with the appearance of a lackey's
  haste.</p>

  <p>"Landlord," he cried, in a voice of importance, and a heavy man came down
  a trap-stair from a garret. Francis's manner assumed the ease of politeness
  and good-fellowship mingled. "I have word with the Captain," he said, "and I
  maun see him before I hae my breakfast. But quick, man, get something ready
  for me."</p>

  <p>"The Captain!" the landlord cried with disgust, "and whatna Captain, my
  lad? I've had eneuch o' captains in thae fower walls this last week to mak
  hell ower thrang for the deil himsel'. But they're a' cleared noo, gone
  yestreen the last o' them to fecht the Hielandmen. God, I wish them luck.
  They'll find a Hieland cateran's dirkie a wee bit less pleasin' in their
  wames than my guid bannocks."</p>

  <p>Here was news of vexation. "But where have they gone, and can I no meet up
  wi' them?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It's easy to tell that," said the sarcastic host. "They're just in Embro
  and nae further. Cope has landed some way doun the Firth, and a' King
  George's lads are drawing to that airt. They say the Chevalier and his
  Hielanders gang oot the day to meet them. Weary fa' them for spoilin' an
  honest man's trade! Fechtin' tae wi' oot breeks and wi' nae skeel in pouther
  and leid! God!" And the man laughed deep and silent.</p>

  <p>"The Chevalier?" Francis stammered.</p>

  <p>"Ay, the Chevalier," said the man. "Whaur hae ye been wanderin' a' thae
  days that ye havena heard o' him? Chairlie's king o' the castle the day,
  though he may be doun wi' a broken croun the morn."</p>

  <p>"I have been long in the South," said Francis, hastily, "and forbye, I am
  given to doing my ain business and no heeding the clash of the country."</p>

  <p>"Weel, weel, maybe sae. But if I were your maister, my lad, I wad pick ane
  mair gleg at the uptak than yoursel'." And the landlord went off, rolling
  with his heavy gait, to fetch the stranger breakfast.</p>

  <p>Francis sat down to reflect on this state of matters with some philosophy.
  It meant a longer journey for himself ere he disposed of his business, and a
  greater risk of frustration. He thought for a moment of playing the faithful
  messenger after all, and casting his services at the Secretary's feet. But
  the thought was scarce serious, for with it came the unpleasant consideration
  that his position would still be a lackey's, and that he would be likely to
  have difficulties if he ever came within range of Lord Manorwater or the
  Secretary's wife. Soon he was reconciled even to the twenty odd miles which
  still awaited him, for the holding of Edinburgh and the landing of the
  English general meant a crisis of war, when news would be bought and sold at
  a higher price. But he must be wary and quick, or any wandering loyalist
  might trick him. So he cried to the landlord to hurry the meal, and stretched
  his already wearied legs in a chair.</p>

  <p>"Are ye for Embro?" asked the landlord.</p>

  <p>"Even so," said Francis, guilelessly, "since ye say the Captain is
  there."</p>

  <p>"Ye'll hae a gey wark finding him, my lad," said the other. "Captains will
  be as thick as fleas in Embro the noo, and the maist o' them withoot the
  breeks. If ye're wise ye'll look for the man ye're seekin' mair east the
  country on the road to join the ithers. What did ye say was his name?"</p>

  <p>"I wasna told any name," said Francis, feeling himself on the edge of a
  hazard. "A' I got was 'The Captain at Leidburn inn'."</p>

  <p>The landlord laughed. "They keep ye muckle in the dark on your side tae. I
  had thocht that that wark was left for the Hielandmen."</p>

  <p>"What side do ye incline to yoursel'?" asked Francis.</p>

  <p>"Nae side," said the man, shortly. "I treat a' the warld as my customers,
  whether they wear the breeks or no. But my faither was ane o' the Cameronian
  kind, and I'm half persuaded that way mysel'."</p>

  <p>But at this moment a rattle at the door proclaimed another visitor.
  Francis turned anxious eyes, for might not this be some servant of the
  Murrays or Manorwaters? But the sight of the newcomer re-assured him, for
  there in all the dust of travel and abandon of weariness stood the deserted
  Starkie.</p>

  <p>He had not prospered in these last days, for his clothing was much soiled
  and his face was lean with exertion. He fell back at the sight of his
  aforetime comrade, as if doubtful of his reception. But Francis was in the
  humour in which to hail his arrival with delight. Yesterday he had repented
  his loss, and now he was in a mood to atone for it. He greeted him with a cry
  of pleasure, and drew the hesitating Westlander to the fire.</p>

  <p>"We've forgathered again," said he, "and now we'll be the better friends.
  In these stirring times, Mr. Stark, there's no room for ill nature."</p>

  <p>"And I'm glad to see ye, Mr. Birkenshaw, for I have missed ye sair. God,
  I'll ne'er forget that weary wander ower the Tweed hills. I've been a' airts
  but the right yin since I saw ye."</p>

  <p>Both ate their breakfast ravenously, while mutual questioning filled the
  pauses. As they talked, the anomaly of their course came forcibly before each
  mind, and each asked the reason of this unexpected meeting-place.</p>

  <p>"What brought ye to this part, Starkie? This is no road to Clyde and the
  West."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've nae doubt it was the same reason as yoursel'. When I came by the
  top o' Tweed the hale land was turned upside doun wi' rumours o' war, and
  ilka plooman gettin' his musket and sword. They telled me Embro was gotten by
  the Prince, and that a' the brave lads were rinnin' to his flag. So, thinks
  I, I may as weel try my luck in my ain land as in the abroad. Forbye, I'll
  pay out my faither, for gin he heard o' siccan daeings he wad gang out o' his
  mind. He bides ower near the Hieland Line to love the Hielandmen. But if
  ye've nae objections, I wad like to hear what brocht you yersel' this
  gate."</p>

  <p>"Wheesht, Starkie," said Francis, looking darkly at the landlord, "I've a
  ploy on hand to make both our fortunes." And he watched the host till he had
  betaken himself to the far back of the kitchen. Then he leaned forward and
  tapped his companion on the arm. "Starkie, man, I have a letter."</p>

  <p>The Westlander's eyes brightened. "That's guid, and whae is it frae?"</p>

  <p>"From the Secretary's wife to the Secretary's self."</p>

  <p>The announcement was made in stage tones and received with proper awe.
  "Mr. Birkenshaw, ye're great," said Starkie, and Francis's vanity was
  appeased. It had been somewhat wounded by the independent tone which his
  companion had seen fit to assume since their severance.</p>

  <p>Then in brief words he proceeded to unfold his plans. He would make
  straight for the east shore of the Firth, and meet the Government leaders.
  The near crisis of the war would heighten his value and gain him favour. He
  had heard enough of the Prince's men to have little faith in them; time would
  soon work their ruin; and then would come reward for the loyal adherent.
  Starkie listened and approved, so both in their ignorance saw a roseate
  horizon to their boyish policy.</p>

  <p>But the businesslike Westland mind had one addendum. The letter might be
  of the highest consequence; again it might be a trifle, which would merely
  expose the bearer to contempt. It would be well to inquire into its
  contents.</p>

  <p>Francis pondered, hesitated, and then blankly refused. Something, he knew
  not what, held him from opening it. He scouted the idea of honour,&mdash;that
  was flung far behind,&mdash;but a sense of fitness even in the details of
  roguery was strong upon him. He had still some memory of the hands from which
  he had got the letter, and his sentiment had not utterly flown. The feeling
  might permit high, audacious treachery, but not so mean and small a piece of
  bad faith. He was on the verge of the humour in which two days before he had
  flung his companion into the ditch.</p>

  <p>In his luckless way Starkie ministered to the growing repulsion. The
  thought of the future delighted him, and he hastened to sketch its details.
  Alike in his childishness and his flashes of shrewdness he was repugnant to
  the maturer Francis. His view of the conduct of affairs was so plainly
  ingenuous that it filled the other with despair, and his idea of happiness
  was the craziest mixture of the respectable and sillily wicked. Francis,
  still in the heat of a great plan, with his brain yet fired from the deeds of
  the night before, had no tolerance for such a huckstering paradise.</p>

  <p>From ill temper the two were rapidly drifting to a quarrel. These last
  days had found Starkie some independence, and he was scarcely disposed to
  bear with his comrade's megrims. He assumed a tone of consequence, and
  replied to Francis's gibes with flat rustic retorts. The landlord came up
  betimes and tried in vain to mediate. Francis had the grace to hold his
  peace, but not so the other. He sank from vituperation to complaint, and was
  on the verge of confiding all grievances to the open ears of the host.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the hours were passing, and a hot blaze of sun in the windows
  warned Francis that he must soon be stirring. For a second he was tempted to
  leave his companion then and there, but he curbed his irritation with the
  bridle of policy and reflected on his probable usefulness. He was in the act
  of conciliating him by timely concession,&mdash;by falling in with the tune
  of his hopes and throwing him crumbs of flattery, when a noise of hooves and
  wheels sounded without on the road and then stopped short at the
  inn-door.</p>

  <p>Both men sprang to their feet, while the landlord hurried to clear the
  table. A woman's voice was heard as if giving orders, and then a step on the
  threshold, and the door was opened. The blinking eyes of Mr. Stark saw a
  lady, tall and fair, in a travelling cloak of dark velvet, with a postilion
  at her back. But Francis's breath stopped in his throat, for he knew the face
  of the woman he was playing false to.</p>

  <p>"Landlord," she cried in her clear high voice, "the right horse has gone
  lame, and I must be in Edinburgh in an hour. Quick, get me a fresh beast, and
  have the other looked to." Then, as she haughtily cast her eyes around the
  place, she caught sight of the gaping Starkie and Lord Manorwater's trusted
  servant. For a second her face looked bewilderment; then a quick gleam of
  comprehension entered, and her cheeks grew hot with anger.</p>

  <p>"So," said she, "I have found you at last, you cur. You thought to trick
  me with your tales and profession. Doubtless you are now on your way to your
  own master with your news. Perhaps it will please you to know that it is
  valueless, since the Prince's army has taken the field. It was well that I
  warned you against this place, else I might have missed this proof of your
  fidelity. Truly my Lord Manorwater is happy in his servants."</p>

  <p>Plainly she still took him for a lackey, and the thought added gall to his
  discomfiture. To be defeated in bold treachery was bad, but to stand
  condemned as a lying menial was bitter to a man's pride. For a second he
  tried to brazen it, but his overpowering vexation made him quail before her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>But now the landlord spoke out in his harsh, obstinate voice,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You will get nae horse frae my stable, my leddy. I am a King's man, and
  will see you and your Prince in hell ere I stir a fit to help. Ye maun e'en
  gang further and try your luck, mistress."</p>

  <p>"Do you refuse?" she cried. "Then, by Heaven, I will take it myself, and
  lash you round your own yard. I will burn the place over your head ere the
  week is out, and then you may have leisure to repent your incivility."</p>

  <p>The fierce rhetoric of her tone cowed the recalcitrant host, but he had no
  time for a second thought. "Robin," she turned to her man, "you will get the
  horse while I wait here and talk to these gentlemen. But, see, give me your
  whip. I shall have need of it."</p>

  <p>The fellow went, and she turned again to the three astounded
  spectators.</p>

  <p>"Stop! What the&mdash;" cried the landlord, but she checked him with
  uplifted arm. "I have no ill-will to you," she said, "and would prevent you
  from doing yourself a hurt. I am the wife of the Secretary Murray, and you
  will find me hard to gainsay. So I beg you to keep out of my quarrel."</p>

  <p>Then she turned once more to the pair with her intolerable scorn.</p>

  <p>"And you are men," she cried, "made in the likeness of those who are
  fighting at this hour for their honour and King, while you cower in an
  alehouse and lay plots for women. But, bah! I waste words on you. Angry words
  are for men, but a whip for servants. You pair of dumb dogs, you will get a
  dog's punishment." And she struck Francis full in the face with her lash.</p>

  <p>At the first crack of the whip, Starkie with the instinct of his kind made
  for the door, and had the fortune to escape. He had no stomach to encounter
  this avenging Amazon with her terrible beauty and cruel words. But Francis
  stood immovable, his mind crushed and writhing, his cheeks flaming with
  disgrace. This bright creature before him, with queenly air and her high tone
  of command, had tumbled his palace of cards about his ears. He felt with acid
  bitterness the full ignominy, the childish, servile shame of his position.
  The charm of her young beauty drove him frantic; her whole mien, as of a
  world unknown to him and eternally beyond his reach, mocked him to despair.
  For a moment he was the blacksmith's grandson, with the thought to rush
  forward, wrest the whip from her hands, and discomfit this proud woman with
  his superior strength. But some tincture of the Birkenshaw blood held him
  back. In that instant he knew the feebleness of his renunciation of virtue.
  Some power not himself forbade the extremes of disgrace,&mdash;some bequest
  from more gallant forbears, some lingering wisp of honour. He stood with
  bowed head, not daring to meet her arrogant eyes, careless of the lash which
  curled round his cheek and scarred his brow. Marvellous the power of that
  slender arm! He felt the blood trickle over his eyes and half blind him, but
  he scarce had a thought of pain.</p>

  <p>Then she flung down the whip on the floor.</p>

  <p>"Go," she cried, "I am done with you. You may think twice before you try
  the like again."</p>

  <p>He moved dumbly to the door, and as he passed lifted his eyes suddenly to
  her face. Dimly he saw that her gaze was fixed on his bleeding forehead, and
  in her look he seemed to see a gleam of pity and at her mouth a quiver of
  regret. Then with crazy speed he ran blindly to the open moor.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>
  Of a Lady on a Grey Horse.</h2>

  <p class="first">The sun was far up in the sky and the world lay bathed in
  the clear light of noon. The long rough expanse of bog lay flat before him
  with its links of moss-pools and great hags of peat. But he ran as on open
  ground, leaping the water, springing from tussock to tussock of heather, with
  his cheeks aflame and his teeth set in his lips. He drove all thoughts from
  his mind; the bitterness of shame weighed upon him like a mount of lead; when
  he looked back at times and saw the inn still in view, the sight maddened him
  to greater speed. So keen was his discomfiture that he scarcely felt
  weariness, though he had been travelling for a day and a night, with no
  sleep. When at last he came to the limit of the desert and emerged on fields
  of turf he ran the faster, till a ridge of hill hid the hateful place from
  his sight, and he sank on the ground.</p>

  <p>In a little he sat up, for though utterly tired, his whirling brain did
  not suffer him to rest. Now, when the scene of his disgrace was no more
  before his eyes, he strove to take the edge from his mental discomfort.
  Drearily he conjured back every detail, and for a little it seemed as if his
  shame would be driven out by the more bearable passion of anger. But the
  attempt failed lamentably. He had wholly lost his old sentiment of bravado;
  he saw his flimsy schemes wither before the bright avenging presence and
  himself a mere knavish servant in her eyes. In his misery the sight of her
  obstructed all his vision. At one moment he hated her with deadly vehemence;
  at the next he would have undergone all humiliation for a sight of her face.
  The inflated romance which had first driven him out on his travels was
  centred for the time on this one woman, and with it there followed the
  bitterness of despair.</p>

  <p>Then he feebly clutched at his wits and set himself to review his
  position. It was black, black, without a tincture of hope. He had failed in
  his treachery, and something within him made him dimly conscious that this
  form of roguery was somehow or other shut to him henceforth. The r&ocirc;le of the
  high-handed adventurer could not be his; even in a simple matter how dismally
  he had failed. And yet he could scarcely regret it, for at the moment the
  part had lost its charm. He must follow his first intentions and sail abroad,
  but with what altered hopes and spirit! For at that hour Mr. Francis
  Birkenshaw in his youth and strength felt that already he was verging on the
  dull confines of age. But with it all the thought of that foreign journey was
  unpleasing. He had ruined his life in his own land, but yet he was loth to
  leave it, for the vague sentiment which was working in his heart was all
  associated with this barren country and the impending wars. He had the sudden
  thought that his services might still be worth their price in either army,
  but again he found no comfort. King George's forces, alien in race and
  unglorified by any fantastic purpose, did not attract him; the other side was
  a dream, a chim&aelig;ra, and moreover his breach of faith had cut him off from it
  for ever. An acceptable recruit he would appear, when Murray of Broughton was
  a leader!</p>

  <p>So with hopeless purpose he set out over the well-tilled country for the
  shores of the Firth. This new ferment would make Edinburgh as safe for him as
  a foreign city, and it was an easier task to sail from the Firth than from a
  western port. He tried hard to recover his attitude of scorn for fate and
  firm self-confidence. But it was little use. No casuistry could persuade him
  to see his folly in a brighter light; he had lost his grip on the world, and
  now was driven about like a leaf where aforetime he had purposed to hew a
  path.</p>

  <p>It was well on in the afternoon ere he struck a track, for he had taken
  his course at right angles to the main highway and found himself mazed in a
  country of sheepwalks. Thence the road ran down into a broad lowland vale,
  set with clumps of wood and smoking houses, with a gleam of water afar among
  low meadows. Autumn was tinging leaf and stalk, and her blue haze rimmed the
  farthest trees and the line of abrupt hills. But the golden afternoon had no
  soothing effect upon him; he saw all things in the light of his own grey
  future, and plodded on with bent head and weary footstep. The effects of his
  toil, too, were beginning to come over him, and he found himself at times
  dizzy and all but fainting. The few people he met&mdash;farmers with carts,
  packmen, and a half-dozen country lasses&mdash;looked curiously at the tall,
  dishevelled man with his weather-stained clothing. He stopped no one to ask
  the way, for the road ran clear to the city, and at its high places gave a
  prospect of roofs and steeples against the silver of the Forth. But sleep
  overcame him before nightfall, and he had to content himself with a lodging
  in the nearest village.</p>

  <p>This he found to be a straggling place with one great inn in the middle,
  and a little church in a wood of birches at the end. His limbs were so weary
  that he would fain have gone straight to the inn and found supper and a soft
  bed; but he reflected that he must husband his money and find humbler
  quarters in some shed of hay. But first he had need of meat, so to the
  inn-kitchen he went and ordered a modest meal, which he ate ravenously. The
  room was full of men, taling hastily in a rich haze of tobacco-smoke, and the
  stranger's entrance passed unnoticed. But Francis, weary as he was, could not
  keep from catching scraps of their conversation. In all a note of fear seemed
  dominant. Words&mdash;"the Hielandmen," "Chairlie," and a throng of
  ill-pronounced Gaelic names&mdash;occurred again and again till he was
  perforce roused to interest. Some great event must have happened since the
  morning, for the taking of Edinburgh was news already old. He touched the
  nearest speaker on the arm, and with his best politeness asked the cause of
  the uproar.</p>

  <p>"Whaur d' ye come frae?" said the man, with the Lowland trick of answering
  with a new question.</p>

  <p>"I'm frae the South," said Francis, "a wearty traivel I have had. But I've
  heard no word of anything, so I beg ye to tell me."</p>

  <p>"Weel, it's just this. The lad they ca' the Prince has lickit Johnnie Cope
  and the redcoats the day at Prestonpans, and the hale land is like to be fou
  o' skirlin' Hielandmen."</p>

  <p>Here was news. Francis' eye brightened, and he was for asking more. But
  the man had had enough of speaking to an ignorant stranger, and once more he
  was in the heat of debate, the subject apparently being an abstruse
  calculation of the time it would take this new power to give the land to the
  Pope.</p>

  <p>"Sune," said a grave old man, "sune we'll see the fair eedifeece o' the
  Kirk coupit, and the whure o' Babylon, as ye micht say, uphaudin' her heid
  amang the ruins."</p>

  <p>"Sune," said a Laodicean, "we'll see something mair serious, a wheen men
  wi' red heids and naething on but sarks routin' ilka decent man out o' house
  and hame."</p>

  <p>Thereupon some eyes began to turn to Francis as the last comer and a
  probable centre of suspicion. His clothing marked him for higher quality than
  a countryman, and something ragged and desolate in his whole appearance might
  argue the Jacobite.</p>

  <p>"What side are ye on, mannie?" one asked him.</p>

  <p>"None. I am for my own hand," said Francis, truly, as he thought of his
  ill-fated incursion into high politics; and with brief good-night he rose to
  go.</p>

  <p>The night had fallen with a great air of dew and freshness, and without in
  the village street the smoke smelled pleasantly in the nostrils, and the
  noise of the stream rose loud in the silence. From afar, as from the city,
  came an echo of a great stir, drums beating, maybe from the Castle, or the
  pipers playing briskly over the victory. The sense of his desolation, his
  folly, the ruin of his hopes, smote heavily on Francis in this starry quiet.
  And with it all his weariness was so deep that it all but drowned the other;
  and finding a shed at the village-end he lay down on a pillow of hay and was
  soon asleep.</p>

  <p>He was wakened about nine in the morning by a heavy hand pulling at his
  coat. He stared sleepily and saw a man in the act of yoking a cart-horse, and
  another pulling his pillow from below his head. They were ready to abuse him
  for a gangrel, but something in his appearance as he rose stopped their
  tongues, and they gruffly assented as he gave them good-morning and went out
  to the open. Half a mile further on the road he bathed head and shoulders in
  a passing stream, and then, with some degree of freshness, set his face to
  the six mile road to the town. Again the day had risen fair, and all the way,
  beneath the ancient trees or through fields of old pasture, was fragrant with
  autumn scents. The electric air quickened him against his will, and he strode
  briskly along the curving highway till it dipped over a shoulder of hill to
  the city's edge.</p>

  <p>That the place was in a ferment was clear from the din heard even at that
  distance,&mdash;the intermittent notes of bugles, the drone of pipes from
  different quarters, and at intervals the rattle of a drum. Francis found no
  guard set; doubtless in the great panic of the one party and the first
  jubilation of the other precautions had not yet entered men's minds. The
  cluster of little hamlets which lay around the city's extremities seemed
  quiet and desert; doubtless all and sundry were even now adding their share
  to the main confusion. But when once he had entered the streets there was a
  different tale to tell. Never before had he seen the Highland dress on any
  number of men, and now the sight of bright tartans and fierce dark faces, as
  with a great air of triumph Macdonalds and Camerons hastened along the
  causeway, affected him with wonder and delight. The honest burgesses wore
  woful countenances, as they saw trade gone and gains lessened. The graver and
  more religious deplored the abomination at street corners in muffled tones
  for fear of the passing victors; while the younger sort, to whom the whole
  was a fine stage play, talked excitedly of the deeds of yesterday, the tales
  which rumour had already magnified. Francis heard names occur in the snatches
  of talk, names of Grants, Thrieplands, and Ogilvies, linked with stories of
  daring. The ferment was too high to admit of formalities, and each man joined
  the first group of strangers and bore his part in the frightened gossip. In
  this way he heard the tale of the fleeing band of dragoons racing for the
  Castle with a single Highlandman at their heels, of the gate shut in his face
  and his defiant dirk stuck in the oaken panels. Confused tales of rank
  Hanoverian cowardice, the superhuman daring of the Prince's men, were
  diversified with wild speculating on the ultimate course of things. The
  Prince was already on his way to the capital, and in twelve hours the world
  would be turned topsy-turvy.</p>

  <p>In all the stir Francis found himself in the position of a melancholy
  alien. He had no share in this triumph, no share even in the consolation of
  defeat. In all this babble of great deeds and brave men he must remain
  untouched, for had he not failed lamentably alike in loyalty and knavery? He
  was a mere popinjay, a broken reed, and to his unquiet sight there lurked a
  sneer in every passer's eye as if they divined his worthlessness. The man
  grew acutely miserable. This was his own city, his home; somewhere in this
  place his mother and sisters dwelled; the streets were sprinkled with his
  aforetime comrades. And he loathed them all: at the mere thought of his
  boyhood with its dreams of future bravado and its puerile vices, he sickened
  with disgust. Indeed this honest gentleman was fast approaching that attitude
  towards life which ends in its renouncement.</p>

  <p>He drifted aimlessly to the end of the town where the streets were
  thronged to meet the coming army. The Camerons, who had marched straight from
  the battle, were there to meet them, and a host of great ladies and little
  lords with the Jacobite favours on their breasts and knots of white ribbon at
  bridle and sword-hilt. Even as he stood staring with lacklustre eyes at the
  sight, there rose through the lower gate the brisk music of the pipes and the
  tread of many men. No music has so dominant a note, and yet few are so
  adaptable. In the hour of death it rises and falls like the wail of a forlorn
  wind, at a feast it has the drunken gaiety of a Bacchante, and in the lost
  battle from it there comes the final coronach of vain endeavour. But in
  triumph it is supreme, a ringing call to action, a p&aelig;an over the vanquished,
  the chant of the heroic. Now with its note went the tramp of feet and the
  clatter of horses' hooves, and then up the narrow street came the dusty,
  war-stained conquerors. A cry of welcome went up from God-fearing citizen and
  ragged Jacobite alike, for in that moment creeds and practice were forgotten
  in the common homage to bravery.</p>

  <p>But Francis had no eyes for the lines of brown-faced men or the stained
  and ragged tartans. Among the bright crowd which greeted them were many whom
  he knew from old days, wits and gentlemen of the town, ladies of fashion,
  names linked with many tales. In some eyes shone the mere pleasure in a
  gallant show, some were wild with enthusiasm, some in a caustic humour. My
  Lord Craigforth kept up running comments with Mrs. Cranstoun of Gair, and the
  young and witty Miss Menteith chattered to Lady Manorwater with a vivacity
  too sharp for enthusiasm. Young gentlemen with French elegance in their dress
  flicked the dust from their cravats, and smiled with gracious condescension
  to popular feeling. But others&mdash;rosy old lairds from the South and the
  dark retinue of Highland gentlemen&mdash;wore a different air. As the tune of
  "The King shall enjoy his own again"&mdash;a catch long hummed in
  secret&mdash;rose clear and loud in the open street, their feelings rose
  beyond control, and with tears running down their cheeks those honest
  enthusiasts joined their prayers for the true King.</p>

  <p>But with Lady Manorwater rode another, whom Francis' eyes followed till
  she was lost in the thickening crowd. She sat her grey horse and gazed on the
  advancing troops with eyes so honestly earnest, shining with such clear
  delight, that the throng on the causeway whispered her name with something
  like affection. Her bridle and trappings were decked with knots of white
  ribbon, and on her heart was pinned a cockade of white roses. The face above
  the dark velvet riding-cloak seemed pale with weariness,&mdash;or was it
  excitement?&mdash;and her hand visibly trembled on the rein. The mark of her
  lash was still on Francis' cheek, but the sting on his soul smarted a
  thousand-fold worse. Had she been gay and lively, he would have hated her
  like death, this woman who had mocked him. But her white face and the glory
  in her eyes affected him with a sentiment too elusive for words,&mdash;a
  compound of pity and a hopeless emulation of a rare virtue.</p>

  <p>He turned from the show down a little alley, and ran as if from the
  avenger. Soon he came to more empty streets which the people had deserted for
  the sight of the entering army. He felt himself starving, so at a very little
  tavern he ordered a meal. But the food choked him, and he left the dish
  almost untasted. He had no mind to think out a future course, for, at the
  present, emotion had broken down the last battlements of sober reason. Soon
  the street grew full again, and he had to bear the scrutiny of many eyes. He
  had no design in his walking; all he sought was to crush the hot pain of
  discomfiture which gnawed his heart. Once the coolest and most fearless, he
  grew as nervous as a woman. He fancied his life lay open like a book to every
  chance passer; and he detected scorn in idly curious eyes. Sometimes he
  passed a face he knew, but he waited for no recognition. His whole past life
  was so hateful to his thoughts that he shunned anything that might recall it.
  In his wanderings he passed by old haunts of his own, yea, under the very
  windows of his mother's house. But old memories had no place in his mind; the
  dissolution of a scheme of life had crushed out the circumstances of his
  past. He had room merely for a bitter thought on the farce of this return to
  his native town; and then his mind was back once more in the dulness of
  regret.</p>

  <p>Toward evening the stir died down, and save for the sight of armed men and
  the excited talk of street-corners, he felt himself back in the Edinburgh of
  his youth. His misery only grew the more intolerable, but it seemed to shape
  to a purpose. He might yet redeem all and play a manful part in life. He had
  tried the r&ocirc;le of the adventurer and failed; there yet remained the more
  difficult path of honour. The portrait of the lady which filled his mind
  seemed not wholly adamant. He had a dim remembrance of a gleam of pity at the
  inn, and the white light of enthusiasm at the pageant of the morning. He
  thought upon his first meeting at the House of Broughton, and her
  graciousness, which then had roused his bitterness, seemed now his one hope
  of salvation. Before his pride had been his manliest attribute; now he
  realised clearly and mournfully that the time had come to humble himself to
  virtue. It was a grievous thought to the arrogant nature, but as he wandered
  through the streets in the late afternoon he was compelled inexorably to
  submit. And as a purpose shaped itself his humility grew deeper, till it
  brought him to unconditional surrender.</p>

  <p>In the High Street he asked of a Highlander the way to the lodging of
  Murray of Broughton. The man told him, adding that the Secretary was with the
  Prince at the Palace of Holyrood. The news gave him hope, and in the
  September dusk he found the house-door with its watchful sentinel. Even now
  Francis' appearance was not discreditable: his clothes were good though sore
  worn, and he had just the figure that a poor loyalist would bear whose
  intentions were better than his fortunes. So the guard suffered him to pass,
  and the serving-man led him down a dark passage to a hall of some size and
  elegance. He was told that the Secretary's wife did much of her husband's
  work, often meeting the throng of visitors who crowded at all hours to the
  house. Now he was taken for one of those, and the servant opened a door and
  let him enter.</p>

  <p>He found himself in a long dining-room wainscotted in brown oak, and lit
  by a blazing fire on the hearth. Two candles burned faintly on a table, where
  sat a lady poring over a great map. She started at his entrance, and then
  lifting a candle came forward to scan his face. Meantime he was in a pitiable
  state of fear. He who had once been cool and self-possessed beyond the
  ordinary, now felt his knees sinking beneath him. Keenly and cruelly he felt
  the measure of his degradation, and the last rag of pride fell from the
  skeleton of his hopes.</p>

  <p>She glanced at his face and stepped back. Wrath entered her eyes, to be
  straightway replaced by sheer perplexity. She looked again at the haggard
  figure before her, waiting for some word to explain his presence. But his
  tongue was tied, his speech halted and stammered, and he could only look with
  entreating eyes.</p>

  <p>"And what is your errand, sir?" she asked. "Has Lord Manorwater discharged
  you? I have not yet had time to tell him of your villainy, but doubtless he
  has found it out elsewhere."</p>

  <p>The words, with the sting of a lackey's reproach, were the needed
  stimulant to Francis' brain.</p>

  <p>"I am no servant," he said, and then hurriedly and brokenly he stammered a
  word of confession.</p>

  <p>The lady drew back with angry eyes.</p>

  <p>"And you dare to come to me and tell me this!" she cried. "I had thought
  it was but greed and a servant's temptation, and now you cut off your own
  apology and confess yourself doubly a liar. Do you think to get anything for
  this penitence? Do you think that the Prince has open arms for all the rabble
  of the earth? Or do you wish to frighten a woman?" And she laid her hand on a
  pistol, and stood erect and angry like a tragedy queen.</p>

  <p>"I seek nothing," said Francis, with a groan. "God knows I am not worth
  your thought."</p>

  <p>"You value yourself well, Mr. What's-your-name. If I had known you as I
  know you now, no lash of mine would have touched you. A whipping is for a
  servant's fault, which may yet be forgiven. But for such as yours ... And you
  are made in the likeness of a proper man," and a note of wonder joined with
  her contempt.</p>

  <p>The wretched Francis stood with bowed head beneath this tempest of scorn.
  The words fell on dulled ears. His own shame was too heavy on his mind to
  allow of a poignant feeling. He felt like some ineffectual knocker at a
  barred door, some vanquished invader trying to scale a hostile parapet. By
  his own folly he had fallen to a place for ever apart from this proud woman's
  ken. He could but cry for pity like a child.</p>

  <p>Then she cut short reproaches and looked at him keenly. Perhaps something
  in his face or his hopeless eyes struck a chord of pity. "What may be your
  name?" she asked, "if you say you are no servant."</p>

  <p>He told her shortly, though the words burned his lips.</p>

  <p>"Birkenshaw," she cried. "Of the Yarrow Birkenshaws?" And then she fell to
  musing, looking up at him ever and again with curious eyes. "I have heard the
  name. Maybe even it is kin to my own. I have heard the name as that of a
  great and honourable house. And you have lived to defile it!" And for a
  little she was silent.</p>

  <p>"I would to God," she spoke again, "that you had been Lord Manorwater's
  lackey."</p>

  <p>The man said nothing. Deep hidden in his nature was a pride of race and
  name, the stronger for its secrecy. Now he saw it dragged forth and used as
  the touchstone for his misdeeds. It was the sharpest weapon in the whole
  armoury of reproach. For one second he wished himself back in his old temper
  of mind. Why had he thus debased his manhood to the frigid and finicking
  virtue of a woman? Not till he looked again at the face of his inquisitor did
  he find justification for his course.</p>

  <p>Again she spoke, but in an altered voice, and Francis seemed to read a
  hint of mercy.</p>

  <p>"No," she said, "I was wrong. I am glad you are no lackey. Had you been
  but a lying servant there had been no room for repentance. But you come of
  honest folk, you have honest blood in your veins. Gentlemen are none so
  common that one should be lost in the making." And she twined her fingers,
  deep in meditation, looking to the fire with a face from which all anger had
  departed.</p>

  <p>Francis' clouded soul cleared at this dawn of hope. He watched the pale
  woman with the marvellous eyes and hair, and a sudden wild exaltation shook
  him. Sufficient, more than sufficient for him to do the bidding of this great
  lady who had drawn him from the depths.</p>

  <p>"Take me," he cried. "I am weak and foolish. I have no more sense than a
  bairn, and I have done the Devil's work with an empty head. But I swear that
  this is by and done with."</p>

  <p>"You have made ill work of it in the past, Mr. Birkenshaw," said the lady.
  "Will you serve the Prince well, think you, if you have been false to
  me?"</p>

  <p>"I can say nought," said Francis, "but I beseech you to give me trial."
  And then with a touch of old bravado he added, "I am a man who has seen much
  and can turn my hands and head to many purposes. I will prove myself worth
  the trusting."</p>

  <p>The lady frowned and tapped with her fingers on the table, looking over
  his head to the wall beyond. "You have much to learn," she said gently. "Do
  you think it is any merit in your services which would make me take you for
  the Prince?" Then, as if to herself, "It is raw stuff, but it would be a
  Christian act to help in the shaping of it to honesty."</p>

  <p>Then with a sudden impulse she walked straight up to him and looked in his
  eyes. "Lay your hand on mine," she said, "and swear. It is the old oath of my
  house, maybe, too, of your own. Swear to be true to your word, your God, and
  your King, to flee from no foe and hurt no friend. Swear by the eagle's path,
  the dew, and the King's soul."</p>

  <p>"I swear," he said, his hand shaking like a leaf as it touched her slender
  wrist.</p>

  <p>"Now you had better leave me," she said. "Maybe I have done wrong. I am
  but a weak woman, and the heart should be steeled for the high business which
  presses on the land. Yet you have sworn, and I have given you my trust. If
  you will come to-morrow morning you will learn my bidding."</p>

     id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>
  The Journey to the North.</h2>

  <p class="first">In the autumn dusk Mr. Francis Birkenshaw rode down a path
  of mountain gravel into the glen of a little stream. Behind him were the flat
  meadows of his own country, with coiling waters and towns smoking in woody
  hollows. The sea lined the horizon with a gleam as of steel; and, fretted
  faintly against hillside and sky, all but vanishing into the evening haze,
  rose the spires and turrets of the city he had left. From the prosperous
  cornfields five miles back the way had risen slowly to the crest of a ridge,
  whence it turned sharply down to a cavernous mountain vale, which seemed to
  lead sheer into the heart of a gloomy land. All about were acres of dark
  hills, ribbed, curved, and channelled by myriad water-courses, forcing sharp
  peaks into the sunset or falling back in dismal lines to the east and north.
  Down the affronting cleft a storm was coming, and even as he looked it burst
  upon him, and he was cloaked in mist and rain.</p>

  <p>He had ridden hard from Edinburgh since the early morn with the speed of a
  zealous messenger. On the day before, when he had gone to the Murrays'
  lodging, he had been tried with many questions, and then trusted with a
  message which even he, all untrained in the arts of war, knew to be of high
  import. His courage had all but failed him; he had stammered modest excuses;
  and then, heartened by bright eyes and brave words, accepted his commission
  with diffident if resolute purpose. With a smile and a face in his memory he
  had ridden out on the morning of this day into the new world for him but two
  nights old. Never before had he felt such lightness of heart. The September
  sunrise had been a masque of purple and gold, the clear air a divine ether.
  Once more he had found a standing-ground from which to view the world; he
  could look frankly in each passer's eyes; and behind all was a woman's face
  in the gallery of his heart to comfort his travelling.</p>

  <p>The thought of the complexity and peril of his mission was scarcely
  present. That was still in the far future. Meantime there was the fervour of
  hope recovered, a fervour still stung at intervals by flickers of old pride,
  and stronger still the half-pharisaic feeling which springs from a dawning
  virtue. He had no thoughts; the tumult of his feelings left no space for the
  clearer emotions. But the sense of wild adventure was strong upon him. He was
  venturing on an errand of war into a land as little known to him as the
  steppes of Tartary. And the eternal memory of the lady freshened his fancy
  till youth returned once more to the broken man who had two days before been
  at the feet of fate. So with blithe heart he crossed the Firth by the Alloa
  ferry, where sea breeze and land breeze strive with the widening river, and
  took his path for the wall of mystic northern hills.</p>

  <p>But now, as a darker country closed in on him, the strangeness began to
  weigh on his spirits. He was lowland bred, and, with all his boasted
  experience, a traveller within but narrow limits. Moors he knew, the soft
  comely deserts which line Yarrow and Tweed and break ever into green vales
  and a land of meadows. But this was something new,&mdash;this everlasting
  bleak land, where God's hand seemed to have placed no order. The stormy
  afternoon made the sight wilder, and all around him birds cried so constantly
  and so shrilly that the wilderness seemed to have taken to itself a voice.
  But soon his natural ardour rose triumphant to the influence of weather. All
  was but part of this new course, instinct with fierce adventure, a list for
  the conquest of haughty hearts. As the cold of evening grew, and heavy
  shadows fell on his path, he exulted in the mystery of his errand. He saw the
  long hillsides on either hand, grey with banks of rock and rough with birken
  tangles, down which at times came the cry of a fox or the cruel scream of a
  hawk. Little lochs were passed, framed in the ebony of black bogs or edged
  with dolorous rushes. All was strange, uncanny; and as he looked keenly for
  the light which should tell him of his journey's end and relief from the
  craggy path, he felt the joy of the crusader, the wanderer on a reputable
  errand.</p>

  <p>But somewhere on the high hills a storm had gathered, and hurrying from
  mist-filled tarns choked the strait glens with sleet. It caught the traveller
  full in the face, and in a trice had him soaked to the bone. This was all
  that was needed to give the final exhilaration to his spirits. Gaily he urged
  his horse, wrapping his cloak about his shoulders and lowering his head to
  bide the brunt. It stung his face to fire, and sent the blood coursing
  through every vein. The man gloried in his strength. He cried defiance to all
  powers of weather, and thought lovingly on himself in this r&ocirc;le of doughty
  knight-errant. Then through the sheer-falling water a light gleamed, all
  rayed like a star through the sleety veil; the way grew smoother; and Francis
  was aware of his lodging for the night.</p>

  <p>Ere he had dismounted and stretched his legs, a throng of all ages and
  descriptions with lights of many sizes gathered about him. The place was
  small and the door narrow, and in contrast with the sharp out-of-doors the
  air smelled hot and close. Dazed like an owl, he stumbled down two steps into
  a wide low room, where some dozen men sat drinking round the fire or eating
  supper at a table. A fire of peat burned in the middle and the air was thick
  with a blue smoke, which gusts from a broken window were ever blowing aside.
  The inmates were all in Highland dress, save one man who was still at
  supper,&mdash;a florid and stout gentleman of middle age in knee-breeches and
  a dark-blue coat. Room was made for Francis on the settle by his side, and a
  meal placed before him.</p>

  <p>With keen appetite he fell to his supper, looking often and curiously at
  his companions. The place reeked of food and drink and generous living. In a
  corner stood a great anker of whisky with a spigot, whence the Highlanders
  replenished their glasses. A barrel of sugar with a small spade in it was by
  its side, and on the peats the water boiled for toddy. It was a good lodging
  for men who were fresh from wild, cold journeying, for such had no mind to
  mark the filth which was everywhere, the slatternly look of the maids, the
  exceeding dirtiness of the company. The Highlanders were all tall men, with
  gaunt dark faces and ragged tartans. One of them, smaller in stature, wore
  the trews instead of the kilt and seemed a thought more decent and
  presentable. They talked rapidly among themselves in Gaelic, and ever and
  again one would raise a catch, while the whole motley crew would join in. It
  was with some relief that Francis turned from watching them to the
  comfortable figure at his side. He caught the man's eye, and they gravely
  gave each other good-evening. Clearly he was a person of consequence, for his
  dress was good, and his rosy face had the tight lips and clean chin of the
  man used to give orders and be obeyed.</p>

  <p>"It's a coarse day for a journey, sir," said he. "Ye'll be going south to
  Edinburgh?"</p>

  <p>"Even so," said Francis, "and I hope to have the pleasure of your convoy
  on the road to-morrow." This personage had the look of a Whig, and there was
  no need to enlighten him.</p>

  <p>"I am at your service," said the elder man, with a twinkling eye. Francis
  caught the twinkle and put a stricter bridle upon his tongue.</p>

  <p>"I hear," said he again, "that there are stirring times in Edinburgh. We
  country folk in the north hear nocht of a thing till it's bye."</p>

  <p>Francis saw the guile and checked the natural desire of the well informed
  to make a present of his knowledge to every inquirer. "I've heard something
  like it," he said, "but we'll not be long in hearing the truth. How long do
  you call in from here to the town?"</p>

  <p>The other's rosy cheeks grew rosier with suppressed amusement. "That was
  the very question I was on the point of asking you myself," he said. "But go
  on with your supper, sir, and do not let me hinder a hungry man."</p>

  <p>Francis ate with sidelong glances at his companion, who had lit a short
  pipe and smoked vigorously. Once and again he met his eyes, and both smiled.
  Truly this game of hide and seek was becoming amusing. Then he fell to
  studying the image of the man's looks as pictured in memory. Some hint of a
  likeness struck him; these lineaments, that figure, were known to him.
  Carefully he traced the web of his recollections, but could find no thread.
  Doubtless he had seen him in the old Edinburgh days, but where? when? He had
  all but finished his meal when a sudden lift of his comrade's arm, a motion
  to set right his cravat, furnished the key to the mystery. He had mind of
  days in the Parliament House, when he, the lawyer's clerk, took notes and
  papers to the great lawyers. Softly he whistled to himself, blinking with
  amazement. The Lord President! So far, so good; he had the advantage of his
  companion; doubtless the famous Mr. Duncan Forbes had no wish to be
  recognised in this Highland tavern.</p>

  <p>"It's a wild night," said Francis. "Had ye a hard day's riding?"</p>

  <p>"Dub and mire," said the other. "Ye're splashed yourself, so ye ken the
  state of the roads."</p>

  <p>"I think I had a glisk of ye five mile back at the bridge-end," hazarded
  the bold Francis.</p>

  <p>"Maybe so. I had a mettle beast, and took the road well."</p>

  <p>"Ay," said Francis, meditatively, "it's a lang dreary road to Culloden,"
  and he looked innocently at his neighbour.</p>

  <p>The man raised his eyebrows a trifle and bowed. "It appears," he said,
  "that my name and designation are better kenned in the land than I had
  thought. Ye have the advantage of me, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Robertson," said the other. "Mr. George Robertson, merchant in the
  Pleasaunce of Edinburgh, returning from transacting some business in the
  north."</p>

  <p>Francis had overshot himself, and the man smiled. "I am at your service,
  Mr. Robertson of the Pleasaunce. Your name and trade do credit to your
  honesty and your own pretty fancy," and with a sly glance he knocked the
  ashes from his pipe.</p>

  <p>The ground was dangerous, and Francis sheered away. Moreover, the rest of
  the company were fast approaching the state of maudlin good-fellowship which
  follows the pugnacious. The smell of hot drink was grateful in his nostrils
  after the bitter wind, and he was in a cheerful mood at the discomfiture of
  his neighbour. He filled a great jug with the piping spirits, and drank
  deeply to some chance toast. The stuff was raw but fiery, and it sensibly
  quickened his vivacity. Memories came back of old tavern nights in his
  boyhood. The smell of the place, the uproarious company fostered the
  impression, and for a little rough hilarity seemed the extreme of joy. The
  man's mind was elated by the day's ride, and still more by the sudden rebound
  from black despair. His animal boisterousness, always at hand in his nature,
  was beginning to assert itself under the influence of keen air and this
  northern whisky. He filled Mr. Forbes's glass till the rosy gentleman cried a
  truce, and toasted him with clinking bowls. Then he grew friendly with the
  others at the table. The little man in the trews made the first overtures to
  friendship by coming over to the pair, bowing with profound if drunken
  gravity, and asking them for their commands. Francis received him as a
  brother, and ere he knew, found himself singing riotously among the ragged
  Highlanders. Toasts in Gaelic were drunk with such generous frequency that
  Mr. Francis Birkenshaw, who had not been drunk above three times in his
  previous life, who had only that morn been a very storehouse of high
  sentiments, who was even now pluming himself on a diplomatist's wisdom,
  became gloriously drunk.</p>

  <p>It is the nemesis of a vagrant youth that when at a later time the keynote
  is struck of some one of these youthful follies the maturer nature
  instinctively responds. The mere flavour of good-fellowship had brought him
  to a condition of which he would have been heartily ashamed even in his
  earliest lawlessness. Once more he was the vicious boy; his tongue was
  loosed, and he drew from the rich storehouse of his former experience. Soon
  the wild talk of the company had been raised to a pitch of indecent blasphemy
  which before it had wholly failed to attain; and the Highlanders, imperfect
  as was their English, looked with awe and reverence on this young spirit
  whose speech was even as the common sewer. Gaelic and English alternating
  filled the place with a din like Bedlam, while ever and anon some loyalist
  sentiment gave a chance for maudlin tears.</p>

  <p>In a sudden spasm of such feeling the company waxed political. "Drink,
  gentlemen," cried Francis, "to the only King, the only Prince, and the only
  Cause. Drink good luck to all honest fellows who take their sword in their
  hand and their plaid on their back when their master bids them. May the dirty
  Germans be sent packing and our ain lad sit in St. James'."</p>

  <p>All rose with wild cries and breaking glass, and a shrill Gaelic song,
  wild as a gled's scream, rasped through the place. All save one,&mdash;the
  sober Mr. Forbes, who sat smiling and self-possessed in his
  chimney-corner.</p>

  <p>Then arose Long John of the Dow Glen with his broken speech. "There iss a
  man, a fat Southron of a man, who will not trink to the goot causs. By
  Heaven, he will get something mair in hiss guts than fusky, if he toes not."
  Robin Mactavish and Hamish the Black added like comments. The little man with
  the trews was too far gone to speak, but he waved a threatening glass.</p>

  <p>Francis had still the wits to refrain from shouting the dissenter's name.
  But he called on him to drink to the King, or he, Mr. Francis Birkenshaw,
  would know the reason.</p>

  <p>"I will drink a toast, Mr. Robertson (or is it Mr. Birkenshaw?)," said the
  man, and he rose slowly to his feet. "Gentlemen all," he cried, "I
  drink&mdash;to all good intentions."</p>

  <p>The words sounded satisfactory and a great shout was the reply, as each
  man interpreted the toast into the tongue of his own sentiments.</p>

  <p>But Francis was little content. "Ye're a Whig," he cried, "a smooth-spoken
  whigamore, unfit for the company of honest gentlemen." And he turned on him
  with the abuse of the stable-yard.</p>

  <p>For a second the two were left alone, for a debate had arisen between
  Robin the Piper and him of the Dow Glen, which distracted the others. The
  elder man looked at his drunken opponent with angry and pitiful eyes.</p>

  <p>"Your speech, sir," he said, "is most filthy and shameful. You belong to
  the wrong side, and I am glad of it, for it would be a disgrace for the right
  party to have you. But you have women in your cause whose memory should
  bridle your tongue. I know naught of you or your business, but it little
  becomes a man to thus forget himself, when he is of the same persuasion as so
  many honest ladies."</p>

  <p>"You have spoken the word, sir," said Francis. "And now I propose that you
  join me in drinking to the best and bonniest. Gentlemen," he cried, "I give
  you the toast of the bonny Mrs. Murray."</p>

  <p>The whole tipsy company caught at the name and drank deep to the health of
  the famous lady, some calling her by her strange Gaelic name, which meant
  "the dew of April." In the wildest glens of the north the story was told of
  her beauty, and she was as often on loyal lips as the Prince himself. So with
  all the good-will in the world the tipsy crew cried her name, while Mr.
  Forbes sat gloomily and angrily silent.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Francis awoke the next morning with a burning head and a
  heart from which all gaiety had gone. He dressed with woe-begone leisure and
  came into the kitchen rubbing weary eyes. The place was quiet utterly; about
  the door hens were clucking, a great hum of the farm-yard was in the air, and
  through the open entrance he saw the high steep shoulder of a hill. The
  company of the night before had gone early; in some haste he looked about for
  the Lord President, but he too had departed. He went out of doors and smelt
  the fresh air of morn. The rain had gone, and the whole narrow vale was
  bright with sun and swollen water. But the sky warned him that he had slept
  late, so he cried for the hostess. She came wiping her hands, a miracle of
  dirty unkemptness. Where had the others gone, he asked. "Ach, their own ways.
  She kent nocht of the folk that cam to her publick. She was only a poor
  woman, fightin' to keep body and saul together in evil days. All had left
  early, even the old man that was sae prawly drest." Francis plied her with
  irritable questions on the way he had taken. But the woman was trusty; Whig
  or Jacobite were nought to her, she would tell nothing of her guests; and to
  aid her pious resolution she discovered opportunely that she knew no more
  English than the barest smattering.</p>

  <p>So he must needs take things as he found them, breakfast on eggs, pay a
  modest lawing, and ride off in a violent ill-humour. The memory of the
  night's doings still rankled in his heart. He had forfeited all claim to that
  character which he had fairly thought he had attained to. He had slipped back
  to the worst days of his youth, and got drunk in the company of filthy
  barbarians. The figure of the Lord President added bitterness to his
  reflections. The man of the world, the true man of affairs, had despised him
  as a lecherous boy. He pictured his own tipsy abandonment, his talk, his
  maudlin jests, all watched with the keen eye of the greatest man in the
  country. The shame of the thing made him cry out and curse his fortune.</p>

  <p>But the gall of the matter was his toasting of his mistress. In his sober
  hours the very speaking of her name in such a company and such a place seemed
  the sheerest blasphemy. And the circumstances of the toast, the drunken
  laughter, the foul talk, the brazen defiance of all decency, made the crime
  more heinous. In a common alehouse he had insulted, grossly insulted, the
  name of her who had given him a reason to live. He reviewed every scene in
  his drama where she had entered,&mdash;the midnight raid on the House of
  Broughton, the tragic farce at the inn, the sight of the lady on the grey
  horse in the street of Edinburgh, and finally that strange meeting in her own
  house where he had seen the full nakedness of his own soul. The memory of her
  face nigh drove him frantic. He was riding on her errand, and, lo! he had
  betrayed her cause at the very outset.</p>

  <p>But with the progress of the day his mind grew quieter. The more poignant
  shame died down, leaving only a regret. The weather was clear and bright,
  autumn without storm and heaviness. The road rose slowly from the straiter
  glens to a high table-land, where shallow vales marked the extreme upland
  waters of young rivers. A wide country lay bare to the view, all alike rough
  with wood and heather; while in the distance a circle of dark mountains made
  a barrier as of some great amphitheatre. The place had a soothing effect upon
  his spirits. Something in the moorland peace, the quiet of these endless
  fields of heather where deer couched and wild birds nested, brought ease and
  some sanity of mind. To the man who knew only the city wynds or the
  shrill-sounding beaches of Fife, this untilled land had an exquisite and
  elemental freshness, as of the primeval world.</p>

  <p>At a turn in the road he saw a rider before him not a quarter of a mile
  ahead. He drew back and stared. Something in the figure and carriage were
  familiar. The man was riding in a hurry, for he used his whip frequently and
  with vigour. Then recollection came to Francis, and in spite of his gloom he
  had almost laughed. This was indeed the Lord President Forbes on his way to
  his house of Culloden, doubtless on some sudden business of state. The man's
  composure was almost restored. Clearly the great statesman feared him; he had
  been at the pains to deceive him and rise early to outwit him. Strange are
  the crannies of our nature; for it is a fact that the sight lessened Francis'
  self-loathing and the bitterness of Mr. Forbes' reproof. After all, he was
  still of some consequence in the world, and though his heart was repentant it
  was remorse without pain.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>
  My Lord of Lovat.</h2>

  <p class="first">That night he lay at a wretched cottage by the wayside where
  the hill-air came through the gaps in the heather roof and made the sleeper
  shiver on his couch of grass. The land was now a mere chaos of black
  mountains, and the road, which at first had borne some likeness to a highway,
  was now sunk to an ill-marked scar through the moss. It made heavy riding,
  and through the next day our traveller felt more weary than he cared to own.
  Had not the sun been bright and the weather dry, he might have missed the
  track utterly, for the bogs which lay among the hills were hard to wrestle
  through. At evening he was fain to stop at a hut which lay on the side of a
  long hill called Corryarrick, up which the road went in corkscrew fashion for
  half a score of miles. The man of the place gave him some kind of oaten
  porridge and a raw whisky which burned his palate, and told him many details
  of his way. This, it appeared, was still the country of the Athole Stewarts,
  but over the affronting hills began the lands of Stratherick and the domain
  of the Frasers. The fellow had little good to say of them; nay, by his
  account they were a clan of gruesome savages hated of God and their
  neighbours. So it was with some foreboding that Francis at the next dawning
  set his horse's face to the ascent.</p>

  <p>All that day he rode in a bleak land, where wild tracts of moss with
  shining lochs scattered athwart them were frowned on by murky hills. And, to
  make the road worse, the place was scarred with horrific ravines running to
  the westward, at whose bottom foamed impetuous rivers. At the best they were
  spanned by rough bridges of tree trunks and heather, but more than once there
  was nothing for it but to make the steep descent and breast the waters. The
  day was still cloudless, but what with many wettings and the hardships of the
  path Francis fell into a dismal frame of mind. No human dwelling relieved the
  inhospitable waste, his store of provisions failed, and, to crown all, his
  horse fell lame at the crossing of a burn and had to be led heavily through
  the hags.</p>

  <p>In the late afternoon three men arose as if from the bowels of the earth,
  and laid hands on horse and man. As it chanced, this was the best thing that
  could have happened, for they were men of Lovat's own clan in Stratherick,
  filthy, thieving rascals, but loyal to their lord. So it fell out that when
  they had plied Francis with unintelligible Gaelic, one, more learned than the
  rest, asked his name and business in a travesty of English. He replied that
  he sought the house of Macshimei at Castle Dounie, for so he had been told to
  speak of the head of the clan. The bare word was enough for the men, who
  straightway became friendly and set to relieve his wants. They dressed his
  horse's knee with a concoction of herbs, bandaging it after a fashion of
  their own, and led Francis to a cluster of cabins on the edge of a long loch.
  Here they gave him meat,&mdash;roast moor-fowl and eggs and a more palatable
  kind of bread, with a glass of excellent brandy. And in the morning one
  undertook to guide him past the narrows of the loch and set him well on his
  way to his destination.</p>

  <p>When in the afternoon he crossed the river which formed the outlet of the
  lake, he found himself on the confines of a pleasant country. Set like an
  oasis among the stormy deserts lay meadows and haughlands and a fringe of
  woods, while beyond gleamed a quiet stretch of sea. The place was green and
  habitable, and on Francis's wearied eyes it fell like a glimpse of an Arcady.
  He could scarce believe his senses, for this looked more like the Lothians or
  the cornlands of Fife. But the high brown towers of the castle rising from
  the seaward slope and the bald scarp of Lovat on a cape in the Firth told of
  a chieftain's dwelling. The sky was darkening towards evening as he rode to
  the great pile, and his heart almost misgave him. He was on a nicely
  diplomatic errand, one, too, not without its peril. The man who dwelled there
  was one of the most famous names in the land, ill-reputed for lawlessness and
  treachery, notorious for a wit too subtle for prosaic earth. Who was he, a
  raw, unlettered vagrant, to meet such an one face to face and teach him his
  business? He was tired to death, too, with his moorland journey, and his
  brain was half clouded with sleep.</p>

  <p>There was no guard at the gate,&mdash;nothing save two unkempt serving-men
  quarrelling over a jug of ale. They asked his business with a high gravity
  and led him into a damp courtyard where children squalled and serving-women
  chattered. The informality of such a place restored Francis to
  self-confidence, and he followed his guides with an assured step. A noise of
  rackety mirth fell on his ear, and he was ushered into the great dining-hall
  of the castle, where some fifty and more men sat at meat. The air was thick
  with the fumes of wine and hot dishes, bare-footed gillies ran hither and
  thither, and it took no extraordinarily acute eye or nostril to perceive that
  the place was exceeding dirty. At the lower end of the great table a crowd of
  ragged and dishevelled men quarrelled and scrambled for bones and offal.
  Thence there seemed to rise degrees of respectability from the common herd
  who supped on sheep-heads and whisky to the more honoured, the lesser gentry
  of the clan, who had good beef and mutton and plenty of claret. At the very
  top sat the lord himself with his more distinguished friends, Frasers of
  Gortuleg, Phopachy, and Byerfield, eating French dishes and drinking many
  choice wines. One of the ragged servants went to the chief's ear and
  whispered as he had been bidden, "Mr. Francis Birkenshaw with a message from
  Mr. Murray of Broughton;" and straightway room was made for the traveller at
  the honourable end of the table.</p>

  <p>The cooking was of the finest, and Francis appeased his hunger with great
  satisfaction. No notice of him was taken by his neighbours to left and right,
  but each listened to his lord's pleasantries with the anxious care of the
  retainer. From the great man himself Francis could not keep his eyes, and in
  the pauses of the meal he found himself narrowly watching the mighty figure
  lolling in his carven arm-chair. Already beyond the confines of old age, an
  ungainly form with legs swollen with the gout and a huge rolling paunch, he
  lay in his seat like a mere drunken glutton. But when the eye passed from his
  body to the ponderous face and head, the mind drew his nature in different
  colours. The brow was broad and wrinkled with a thousand lines, hanging heavy
  over his eyes and fringed with great grey eyebrows. The thick fleshy nose,
  the coarse lips, the flaccid grey cheeks, were all cast in lines of massive
  strength, and the jaw below the cunning mouth was hard as if cut in stone.
  But the most notable point in the man was the pair of little eyes, still keen
  as a ferret's, and cruel in their resolute blue. He ate ravenously, and drank
  scandalously of every wine, keeping all the while a fire of compliments and
  jocularities, coarse as the gutter, at which the obedient assembly
  roared.</p>

  <p>By and by, and not for a good hour, the feast came to an end, and the old
  lord was lifted from his seat by two servants. "Gentlemen," he cried, "there
  will be supper here in a matter of two hours, beefsteaks and claret for all
  that wish them. See that no man goes empty out of this house of Dounie. For
  mysel', ye see that the infirmities of age creep over me, and the thrang o'
  many cares compels me to quit ye. Guid e'en to ye, friends, guid fare and a
  safe returning." And he hobbled away, leaning heavily on his bearers.</p>

  <p>After his departure the table was turned into a scene of riot, all
  shouting in Gaelic, drinking strange toasts and quarrelling at times in pairs
  and threes. Francis felt sadly out of place in a company where he was known
  to none and heard nothing but a strange language. So when a gillie touched
  his sleeve and bade him follow, for "ta great Macshimei wad speak with him,"
  he rose gladly and left the reeking hall. The man led him into another room
  furnished with some approach to comfort, where rugs of deerskin covered the
  nakedness of the stone floor; thence into a passage which led to a narrow
  stone stair; and finally stopped at the entrance to a little turret-room.
  With an air of deep secrecy he tapped twice, and then with a flourish opened
  the door and showed Francis in, crying the announcement, "To speak with ta
  Lord Lovat."</p>

  <p>The place was little and bright, with a cheerful fire and a long couch of
  skins. So thick were the walls, so narrow the space, that Francis felt
  himself secluded from the world. The chief lay stretched out with his feet to
  the blaze, a little black table with wine at his elbow. He looked up sharply
  at the entrance, and then stared once more into the fire as Francis came
  forward and stood before him. After a little he raised his head. "Young man,"
  he said, "I pray you sit down. See to your ain comfort. Ye are admitted to a
  private and secret audience with a man who is not accessible to all. I trust
  ye have the sense to value your preevilege."</p>

  <p>Francis bowed in some confusion. The look of arrogant strength in this
  strange old man crushed his spirits. He sorely distrusted his own wits in
  contest with this rock of iron.</p>

  <p>"Ye will have a letter from the secretary?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, no," said Francis, "for the matter is somewhat too long for a
  letter. It is a thing for a discussion, my lord, and not for a scrawl on
  paper."</p>

  <p>The old man looked grimly at the speaker. "And who are you in God's name,"
  he rasped out, "that is thocht worthy to come and treat wi' me?&mdash;me, the
  first lord in the Hielands, the friend o' princes."</p>

  <p>"My name is Francis Birkenshaw, at your service," said the other,
  conscious that those shrewd eyes were scanning every line in his face, every
  thread in his garments.</p>

  <p>Once more his catechist plied him. "Are ye gentrice?" he asked.</p>

  <p>At this some heat came into Francis' blood, and he answered warmly, "I am
  even as yourself, my lord. My descent is none so regular, but I have the name
  and blood of a gentleman."</p>

  <p>Lovat frowned crossly, for the scandals of his family were common talk.
  "Ye have a ready tongue in your head, sir, but ye are somewhat lacking in
  respect. So ye are one of Murray's packmen?"</p>

  <p>He waited for an answer, but Francis held his peace. "Ay," he went on, "a
  deeficult, dangerous job. Murray's a shilpit body, a keen man for his ain
  guid, but without muckle penetration. But his wife&mdash;weel, d' ye ken his
  wife?"</p>

  <p>"I have the honour of her acquaintance," said Francis, stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Have ye indeed?" said Lovat, smiling. "A fine woman, then, I can tell ye,
  sir. A bonny bitch! A speerity licht sort o' body!" and he looked from below
  his eyebrows to see the effect of his words.</p>

  <p>"If you will pardon me, sir," said Francis, "I fail to see your point. You
  are talking of the character of those with whom I have nothing to do. Be
  assured I did not ride over your wet hills to indulge in moral
  disquisitions."</p>

  <p>The man laughed long to himself. "So that's your talk," he said, "and
  you're no one o' Murray's fighting-cocks? Weel, the better for my business.
  Help yoursel' to some wine, Mr. Birkenshaw, for it's drouthy work
  talking."</p>

  <p>Further he bade Francis draw his chair nearer the fire and stir the logs
  to a blaze. Then silence reigned in the room while the elder man stared into
  the glow with a face which even in the dim light seemed to his companion to
  be working with some emotion.</p>

  <p>"It's a queer warld," he said at length, "and for the auld, a cruel one.
  Be sure, Mr. Birkenshaw, that it is a painful thing to feel the life sinking
  in your members and to mind again and again o' the days when ye were young
  and bauld. <i>Ebeu fugaces anni labuntur.</i> Weel, weel, it's the destiny of
  all."</p>

  <p>He lay back on his couch so mighty a wreck of a man that Francis's pity
  was stirred. He was himself of just such a spirit, and he could forecast in
  imagination the bitter ebbing of vital force. He nodded gravely to each
  sentence. Then the old lord spoke again with a sharper tone.</p>

  <p>"Ay, but that is no the worst of an auld man's lot. Ye see me here, me
  that has been the peer o' the best in the land, forced to keep the company o'
  a wheen wild caterans, and all the while the country asteer wi' war. I am
  auld and puir and weak, and so I maun sit still in this lonely stane tower
  and hear o' great events through the clash o' packmen. Once," and his voice
  rose high and querulous, "once I was the great Lord Lovat, and every man was
  cap in hand as I came down the High Street o' Edinburgh. Mair, far
  mair,&mdash;I hae carried the King himsel', God bless him, in my arms through
  the gardens o' Kensington, and my word was maybe no the least noted at
  Almack's and the Cocoa Tree. There have been days, sir, when I walked in St.
  James' Park, and many a braw lady cast eyes on the chief o' the Frasers and
  many great lords were proud to cleek my arm. And now I maun dwine away my
  life in the midst o' cauld hills and heathery mosses. I have no complaint
  against a merciful God, but is it not a sair dispensation? But were this all,
  I would say ne'er a word. But in my day I have had the feelings, ay, and
  maybe done the work, o' a statesman and a patriot. I have sat at the
  council-board with Hamilton and Queensberry, I have been the trusted adviser
  of Buccleuch and Tweeddale and Aberdeen, and not once or twice, but a score
  o' times did Maccallum Mhor himself call me his friend. Can I sit still then
  and see the land divided against itself, one king on the throne and another
  in the heather, and the wisest heads in braid Scotland at desperation wi'
  loyalty and religion pulling one way and common prudence the ither? Ay, and I
  maun sit and see and groan in my inmost heart, and all the while be sae
  clogged wi' this perishin' body that I canna move."</p>

  <p>Lovat spoke fiercely and quickly, and Francis was impressed by the note of
  lofty resolution. He was dimly conscious of the grandiloquence, but the
  titanic strength of the recumbent figure made it seem only fitting.</p>

  <p>"And then," the old man continued, "there is a different side to the whole
  matter. Now in this, the hinner end o' my days, I am quit o' all personal
  ambition, but I canna help that natural pride which the chief must feel in
  his own people. All the great northern clans are taking sides, Macdonalds,
  Camerons, and Stewarts for the Prince, Macleods and Macintyres against him.
  And whatever way it falls out they will aye have taken their part in the
  battle and won great glory. Is it like," he said simply, "that I could endure
  that the Frasers should lie quiet like auld wives or young bairns? You will
  pardon my enthusiasm for a poor rude, ignorant people, but they have followed
  me and my fathers and love my house dearly. Nay, sir, you who ken but the
  folk of the towns and the south country can have little notion of these poor
  folks' loyalty. I am called the thirty-eighth of my name and for every lord
  of Lovat they have spilled their blood like water. But now in the evil days,
  when their lands are narrowed, and men who ken nothing but how to fight must
  set themselves to tillage, you can believe that their heart is cast down.
  They look to me to help them, and I have nothing to give them, so the poor
  folk must quit their bits o' sheilings and the kindly glens where their
  fathers have dwelt since first a Frisel set foot in Scotland, and gang east
  and west and south to ither lands and stranger peoples. And there they make
  what shift they can to live, but their hearts are aye sair for the heathery
  hills and the auld glens and waters. I am no a man easily moved to tears, but
  the thought of my poor folk makes me greet like a bairn."</p>

  <p>The melancholy voice, the sorrowful words, and the great figure, which,
  seen in the dim light, had lost all coarseness and was almost majestic,
  thrilled Francis in spite of himself. He had come with a distrust of this
  man, with a mind well stored with tales of his extraordinary character, and
  in consequence he had brought to the meeting a heart triply bound against all
  emotions. But this air of lingering pity was overcoming him. This fusion of
  the complaint of an exiled Aristides with the lament of a chief over the past
  glories of his clan was affecting in the extreme.</p>

  <p>Then the other changed his tone utterly. Raising himself from his couch,
  he looked over to Francis with a keen face of interrogation. "I ken naught of
  your politics, Mr. Birkenshaw, though from your errand I might make a guess.
  But I assume that ye are an honest, open-minded man, and I will do ye the
  honour to speak plainly. I live out o' the warld, but I have een in my head
  to see. We will leave the question of politics aside, if you please, for the
  moment. It may be that I am for the present king, it may be for him that's
  ower the water. But, at any rate, the blood o' my fathers in my veins still
  cries out to strike a blow for a Stuart, and I canna see the Cause misguided
  without a pang. And what is it that I see? A brave young lad wi' nae
  experience o' war and little knowledge o' men, and a' around him a cleckin'
  o' wild Highland chiefs who fecht for their ain hand and nothing besides. And
  them that micht be advisers, what are they? A wheen bairnly boys, wi' guid
  coats on their backs and fine names, very ready wi' their bit swords, but
  poor silly sheep in the day of battle. Take my word, Mr. Birkenshaw, there
  are only two heads in the hale concern. There's the Athole Murray, Lord
  George. I bear nae guid will to him, but at least he is a man and a soldier.
  And there's Murray o' Brochtoun. Weel, the less said o' him the better. I
  have come across him in mony a ploy, and the heart o' him is as rotten as
  peat. But he is a man o' pairts, his hand is in the making o' every plan, and
  abune a' he has his bonny wife to help him. It's kenned that she has a' her
  lovers at her back, and that means half the gentry o' the land."</p>

  <p>The old man leaned forward and scanned Francis' face. It was his aim to
  find out how far this messenger was sent by a petticoat, and to set him
  against his mistress. He had chosen his words with exquisite cunning, and he
  awaited the effect. Nor was he disappointed. The young man's face, to his
  huge irritation, flushed deeply, and he seemed suddenly bereft of words. His
  reason told him that such confusion was unwarrantable; it was no news to him
  that Mrs. Murray, the admired of all, had a train of gallants at her bidding.
  But the fact had never appeared to him so real; he had felt, he knew not why,
  that in this woman he had a private interest; his goddess seemed tarnished by
  a hint of common worship. Lord Lovat's plan had been well calculated, but he
  had just missed by a hair a proper estimate of his companion's character.
  Instead of the irritation with the world and despair which such news would
  have roused in the common man of sentiment, in Francis it merely awakened a
  deeper humility, a keener feeling of his own insignificance, a more hopeless
  devotion. The thought that his sentiment was shared by many showed the vast
  distance which separated her high virtue from his folly. Somehow the shaft
  had not only missed its mark, but performed the very work which its sender
  dreaded.</p>

  <p>"I have spoken to you as friend to friend, Mr. Francis Birkenshaw," said
  Lovat. "Ye see my unhappy position. An alien to those in authority, prevented
  by my weakness from vigorous action, I must decide one way or another for the
  clan. Ye see the responsibility and the hardship."</p>

  <p>Francis muttered assent, but his wits were busy with another
  question,&mdash;whither all this talk was tending. He had his clear mission
  to win this lord to the Prince's cause, but the problem had now a different
  aspect. With much trepidation he waited on the issue of affairs.</p>

  <p>But Lovat had little disposition to give a ready answer. "Have ye any news
  for my ear?" he asked. "I have heard of the victory at Preston Pans, but I
  would like to ken if any mair lords have risen, if England is yet ripe, and
  if the army has gotten an increase."</p>

  <p>Francis could say nothing but that Lord Lovat appeared as well informed as
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut, but this is a difficult business," said the old man, and he
  stared once more into the fire. "See here, sir, you see the wretched way I am
  placed. God knows I hold my country's welfare next to my own soul. I am ower
  auld to care a straw about which king has his backside on the throne; all I
  seek is that the land prosper. But it seems to me that the scales are about
  level. James would make a good king, and there's nae doubt but he has the
  richt on his side. Geordie makes a tolerable show, and if Chairlie is no
  strong enough to ding Geordie down, why, there Geordie will sit. If I thocht
  that there was a fair chance, I would set a' my people off the morn to fecht
  for the Stuarts. If I was clearly persuaded that there was none, they would
  join the ither side with all despatch, that the rising might be the sooner
  quelled and peace restored. I am ower auld to take the field mysel', and it's
  for my poor feckless folk I maun consult. But the devil of it is that I canna
  make up my mind one way or anither. I live ower far out o' the warld, and
  I've ower little news. My friends among the Jacobites are wi' the Prince, my
  friends on the ither side, like the Lord President, are a' in Edinburgh and
  like to be there for mony a day. Truth, I kenna where to turn," and he looked
  to the other with an air of great perplexity.</p>

  <p>"On one matter I can ease your mind," said Francis. "I overtook the Lord
  President on the road, and as he was some three hours before me, he will be
  at his house of Culloden ere now."</p>

  <p>Lovat shot one sharp glance at the speaker. "Say ye sae," said he. "Weel,
  I'm glad of it. But I fear ye maun be wrong, for Duncan in a time like this
  would come first to Castle Dounie. It was aye his way wi' his auld
  friends."</p>

  <p>At the words and look which accompanied them, Francis had some suspicion
  that the presence of the Lord President in the north was well enough known to
  his interlocutor. He declared bluntly that he knew the face and had made no
  mistake.</p>

  <p>"Weel, weel, we'll let the matter be," said Lovat. "If ye're richt, sae
  muckle the better for me. But how can I make up my mind when I get such word
  as this?" and he reached his hand to a packet of papers. "Here is a
  memorandum from Culloden's self with great news o' King George's forces and
  the peaceable and law-abiding spirit of the citizens of Edinburgh and the
  folk of the south. 'My dear lord,' he says, 'I do assure you that the thing
  will be nipped in the bud, so I counsel you to take no rash steps.' So says
  Mr. Duncan; but what says Lochiel? 'All the land is with us; forbye there are
  ten thousand French to be landed immediately, while in England every house of
  distinction is all for us and our Prince.' God, Mr. Birkenshaw, if ye had
  brought news to settle this kittle point, ye would have been an acceptable
  messenger."</p>

  <p>Francis was in a quandary from which he saw no outlet. This man was
  clearly playing high for his own hand, but he had cloaked it cunningly under
  a pretence of love of clan and country. So he spoke guardedly. "You make the
  question difficult, my lord; but if the odds are so even, if whatever way you
  turn a like peril attends you, is there no sentiment to turn the scales?"</p>

  <p>Lovat nodded wisely. "There ye are right," he said. "I have a sentiment
  for the old house, which is ever tugging against my prudence. When I heard
  the news o' Preston Pans I was daft. I cast my hat on the ground and drank
  damnation to the White Horse o' Hanover, and this very day I had seven
  hundred men drilled on the green, a' wi' their white cockades and springs o'
  yew in their bonnets. Were I no a discreet and weel-principled man, the clan
  would ere now have been marching over Corryarrick."</p>

  <p>Francis spoke with rising irritation. "You see that I can advise you
  nothing, my lord. My opinion on the enterprise is my own, but I am here with
  a clear message. Are you willing to take the step and trust your fortunes and
  your clan's to God and the Prince, or will I take back the answer that my
  Lord Lovat is old and timid and prefers to bide at hame?"</p>

  <p>"Na, you will do no siccan thing. I was but talking the matter over in a'
  its bearings, for my mind was made up lang syne. I am faun in years, but my
  spirit is not quenched, and it will never be said that the chief o' the
  Frasers was feared to take a chance. But I am no young hot-head to rin at the
  sound of a trumpet, and my habit of due consideration is strong in all
  things. Just rax me that pen, Mr. Birkenshaw, and I will write the Secretary
  the word ye want."</p>

  <p>The old lord mended a quill and wrote diligently for some minutes, while
  Francis watched the great mask-like face with a mixture of admiration and
  distrust. He dimly guessed at the purpose of the whole talk, and this sudden
  decision did not increase his faith. By and by the writer finished and looked
  up with a twinkling eye. "Ye're a trusted servant of the Cause, Mr.
  Birkenshaw, so ye'll be preevileged to hear a bit o' my epistle. Am I to add
  any kind messages about yoursel'? Ye will see that I have omitted no one of
  the flowers o' sentiment which ye so admire." And he read:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I solemnly protest, dear sir, that it was the greatest grief of my life
  that my indisposition and severe sickness kept me from going south to my dear
  brave prince, and never parting with him while I was able to stand, but
  venture my old bones with pleasure in his service and before his eyes, while
  I had the last breath within me. But I send my eldest son, the hopes of my
  family and the darling of my life, a youth about nineteen years old, who was
  just going abroad to finish his education, after having learned with applause
  what is taught in our Scots universities, and was graduate Master of Arts.
  But instead of sending him abroad to complete his education, I have sent him
  to venture the last drop of his blood in the glorious prince's service; and
  as he is extremely beloved, and the darling of the clan, all the gentlemen of
  my name (which, I thank God, are numerous and look well and are always
  believed to be as stout as their neighbours) are gone with him.</p>

  <p>"What do ye think o' that effort in your own line, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I am not sure that I take your meaning," said Francis. "You cannot go
  yourself, but you will send the clan under your son?"</p>

  <p>"That is my meaning," said Lovat, "and what do you think of it?"</p>

  <p>"Why, that it is most honourable and generous," said Francis, in
  incredulous tones.</p>

  <p>The old lord looked at him for a little, then pursed up his mouth and
  smiled. "Honour and generosity," he said, "are qualities o' my house, and
  we'll let that subject alane. But I look to reap the reward o' my action,
  sir. This is no wild clanjamphray sent down from the hills, but a great and
  weel-disciplined clan wi' my own son at its head. If the rising ends in
  naething, then there's my poor folk at the mercy o' their enemies, when they
  were sent out maybe against their will by their chief, who a' the while was
  weel disposed to both governments. If, again, the Prince gets his desires,
  there is honour and glory for man and master. I put both possibilities before
  you as a man o' some sense and experience, and I trust that if the first case
  come about before ye get the length o' the Prince's army, this letter whilk I
  have written will never get further than your pocket. And, further, that
  supposing you have delivered it, you will do your best to see it
  destroyed."</p>

  <p>Francis stared in downright amazement. This was an extreme of brazen
  audacity which he had not reckoned with. The man's eyes were peering into
  his, and every line of that strange face spoke of daring and wit. "But," he
  stammered, "the clan will be out, and that will involve you without any
  scrawl of writing."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said Lovat, "the clan will be out, but perhaps it may be in
  spite o' their loyal chief, who sits at hame lamenting their defection and
  the woful ingratitude of children." His eyes were filled with sardonic mirth
  as he watched the changing face of his companion.</p>

  <p>But Francis was already roused to keen suspicion, and he found at once
  voice and a cool bearing.</p>

  <p>"Your methods are simple, my lord, and do credit to your politic mind. I
  will not say that they are dishonourable, for I have no reason to judge you.
  You have talked to me of your forethought for your people, which does you
  credit, and if this were the only motive your policy might be blameless. But
  I have heard talk of a dukedom for the lord of Lovat if all turned out
  well."</p>

  <p>"Ay, and what of that?" asked the old man, with great calmness.</p>

  <p>"Why, this," said Francis, "that if a man have recourse to tricks for the
  sake of others, he is pardoned, but if for his own advantage, he gets a more
  doubtful name."</p>

  <p>"Meaning?" said the other.</p>

  <p>"Meaning," said Francis, "that men use the ugly word treachery."</p>

  <p>"Your knowledge of affairs is excellent, Mr. Birkenshaw, and what do ye
  say yoursel' in the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Why," said Francis, "if you press me, I will say that I have heard that
  there were such virtues as honour and loyalty in the world."</p>

  <p>The speaker was astonished at the issue of his words. The old man's face
  grew white with rage, and he half raised himself in his seat. Then he fell
  back with a cry as the pain twinged, and lay scowling at Francis, mumbling
  strange oaths. "You talk to me o' honour," he cried, "me, a very provost in
  the virtue, who for threescore years have lived wi' gentlemen o' the highest
  repute. And a whippit bitch o' Edinburgh lad comes here and preaches in my
  lug about honour! Honour," and he laughed shrilly, "as if honour werena mair
  than the punctiliousness o' a wheen conceited bairns."</p>

  <p>Then as his anger passed, his face softened and he looked quizzically at
  Francis. "Ye are doubtless a mirror o' all the virtues yoursel', Mr.
  Birkenshaw, since ye talk about them sae weel. But I thought I heard word o'
  a daft lad in the publick o' Clachamharstan, no three days syne, whose tongue
  wagged to a different tune. The description I got o' him wasna unlike
  yoursel'."</p>

  <p>Francis grew hotly uncomfortable as the memory of his folly came back to
  him, but it roused his anger and obstinacy. He was no more to be laughed out
  of his purpose than terrified by a dotard's threats. So he looked squarely at
  his tormentor with no sign of irritation.</p>

  <p>Then Lovat changed his tone and spoke kindly. "Ye are a sensible man, Mr.
  Birkenshaw, and gifted wi' some subtlety o' mind. I will do ye an honour I am
  little used to do to folk, and explain my exact views on this matter. It is
  possible that I may desire safety for my folk and honour for myself both with
  the highest intentions. I may have thoughts of the great old glory of my name
  and seek to see it bright once more in these latter days. I may have a great
  and patriotic policy of my own which I seek to work out through the clatter
  and fechtin' o' Whig and Jacobite. I may feel my own power, and ken that
  through me and me alone a better time can come for this auld land. I may
  believe all this and mair, Mr. Birkenshaw; and who is to blame me if I use
  what means I can summon? I have heard the word that the end justifees the
  means; and I can tell ye, sir, there are things better than honour, and these
  are knowledge o' the times and a great love for an oppressed people."</p>

  <p>The words were spoken in a low, soft voice and with an accent of deep
  pathos. The effect was nicely calculated, but once more it missed by a hair.
  Francis was touched in his emotions, but surprise at the recent scheme of
  bold impudence was still strong upon him. Earlier in the night the old lord
  had moved him almost to tears, but somehow this boastful romantic stuff left
  him untouched.</p>

  <p>"I will bring this letter to the Secretary Murray," said he, "whatever be
  the upshot. On no other conditions can I take it from your hands."</p>

  <p>Lovat sighed deeply, sealed the missive, and gave it to the other. "I maun
  e'en be content," he said, "and I trust that God will prosper the richt."</p>

  <p>Then his whole demeanour changed, and he lay back and laughed long and
  heartily. "Sic a warld!" he cried. "Here's a young man thinks me a traitor
  when he serves Murray o' Brochtoun, who could give lessons to the Deil.
  Well-a-day, Mr. Birkenshaw, get ye gone and be damned to ye for a sour
  pernickety law-lander. Keep this meeting weel in mind, for be sure it's the
  first and last time ye ever will forgather wi' a man o' intellect. But, dear,
  dear, Simon, ye're back at your auld boasting ways, whilk is a bad example to
  the young man. Tak a glass o' wine, Mr. Birkenshaw, and one o' my men will
  show ye where ye are to sleep. But stop, man, ye winna get through the Fraser
  country in sic a time without a bit word from me. This will pass you," and he
  gave him one of the many rings from his fingers. "Take it and keep it in
  memory of auld Simon Fraser, who some way or ither took a fancy to ye. But I
  doubt, sir, ye've mista'en your trade. Ye should hae been a minister and a
  prop o' the Kirk."</p>

  <p>And with the queer cackling laughter of age still in his ears, Francis
  left the room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.<br>
  Waste Places.</h2>

  <p class="first">The next morning before the crowd of guests were well awake,
  Francis had left the haughlands which lined the Firth and ridden once more
  into the land of storms. The image of the old lord was still vivid in his
  memory. Every word in their conversation, every look of that strange face,
  was clear in his mind, and he rehearsed the tale a dozen times in the first
  hour of his journey. Plainly he had been of sufficient consequence to be
  worth conciliating. This in itself gave him pleasure; but to temper it he had
  the other thought that Lovat in some way had heard of his conduct at the inn
  and had thought his character a fit mark for cajolery. The air of powerful
  cunning, of sinister wit, which the great lord seemed to bear, had left in
  his mind a sense of his own futility. This man had been pleased to play with
  him as a cat with a mouse, to talk him fairly and treat him well; but the
  same man, had he so willed, could have crushed him like a child. For a little
  he tried to fathom his own political feeling, but could find no more than a
  personal sentiment. The enterprise had no charms for him; he had as little
  care for the Prince's success as for the Prince's person; and he saw with
  cruel exactness the quixoty of the whole business. But he had no mind to see
  any man play false to a cause with which he had linked himself; and he swore
  that Lovat would find himself bound to his promise. If he could reach
  Edinburgh before the army left for the South, it would be possible to give
  Murray the letter and so bind the clan to follow the Prince's standard
  whether the wind blew fair or foul. If he were too late, some reverse might
  happen which should send the Frasers and their chief to the arms of the
  Government. Clearly the best policy was speed.</p>

  <p>Yet in his feelings to Lovat much kindliness was mixed with awe. That huge
  and intricate face had humour and rich nature in its crannies. He remembered
  the infinite changes of his speech, his heroical sentiments, his coarseness,
  his essays in the pathetic. The whole attitude of the man awakened a kindred
  sentiment in his own heart. He liked his great vigour, his rhodomontade, his
  palpable and masterful strength. This was the man whom a month ago he would
  have worshipped as the perfection of the loftily unscrupulous. Now though he
  was somewhat estranged from such an admiration and there was something
  repellant in what would once have been wholly attractive, yet enough survived
  to make the figure pleasing to his memory. He had a mind to help the cause
  which he had espoused, but if the interests did not clash, he was a partisan
  of Lovat's. The great lord's ring glistened on his finger, a garnet cut with
  a cluster of berries, and as he looked at it he felt for its giver almost the
  affection of a clansman.</p>

  <p>When he crossed the river at the neck of the loch and entered the steep
  glens of Stratherick, he found his purpose of speed hindered. The road, which
  had hitherto been like a rough carriage-track, was now suddenly transformed
  into a bridle-path among rocks and heather, sometimes obscured in bog, as
  often winding steeply along a hillside where a stumble might mean death. The
  morning had been cloudy, and now a wind from the south-east brought up great
  banks of wrack and obscured hill and valley. Francis had no desire to follow
  the devious track he had come by, for he had been told of a better path
  leading into the upper Spey valley and thence into the Athole country and the
  head-waters of the Garry. He had planned to stay the night at the house of a
  cousin of Lovat's among the wilds at the head of Nairn, but the place was
  difficult to come at and needed clear weather. At the first sign of storm his
  spirits dropped, for craggy heights when cloaked in rain-clouds had still a
  dreary effect upon his soul. Now, as he looked, he saw the whole land grow
  wilder and bleaker. The glen up which the bridle-path mounted opened on a
  flat space of moorland, whence ran the waters of another stream on a new
  watershed. Down this burn lay his path, but to find it was a hard matter,
  when there were few marks of a track and the traveller was supposed to be
  guided by hill-tops invisible. Just at the edge of the moss the first drizzle
  of rain began, and Francis looked blankly into a wall of grey vapour, rising
  sheer from the plashy heath and merging in the lowering sky. The air was
  bitter cold, and he was ill-provided for a winter journey, seeing that he had
  ridden from the city at short notice. The man was hardy and bold, but mere
  hardihood is not enough to find the track in an unknown moorish country. So,
  bewildered and all but afraid, he set himself to grope his way across the
  desert.</p>

  <p>Then came an hour of incontinent misery. He no sooner found the road than
  he lost it. The rain wet him to the skin, the wind buffeted his face till he
  was half-dazed, and ever and again he would find his horse floundering in a
  hag and panting miserably. The moor was seamed with craggy water-courses, and
  once astray from the track he could not tell what awful ravines lurked below
  the white shroud. The mere constant looking-for of danger became a bodily
  discomfort. His eyes were strained and aching, and his head seemed to swim
  with his incessant vigilance.</p>

  <p>At last the flat ground ceased and he felt dimly that he was descending a
  slope. He could hear a loud rushing as of a multitude of streams, but the
  mist hid all from view. Sometimes the noise grew louder, sometimes it seemed
  to die away, and only the slipping of the horse on the sodden ground saluted
  his ears. He was cold, wet, and hungry, and now he began to be eerily afraid.
  This could be no path; he must be astray in this chaos of fierce hills, where
  precipice and loch barred the traveller's way. By a resolute closing of his
  thoughts he kept his head, and gave all his care to holding up his horse.
  Meantime that strange din of waters was never silent: now and then he seemed
  almost on the edge of a great stream; but nothing appeared save the white
  wall and the wet earth beneath.</p>

  <p>Then the expected mischance came, and with fatal suddenness. Gradually it
  became clear that his horse was slipping, and that the ground beneath was an
  abrupt green slope where no beast could find footing. He pulled it up by the
  head, but the time for restraint was over. The poor creature with terror in
  its eyes and its nose between its forelegs was sprawling down the hill ever
  nearer to the awful roar of cataracts. Francis after a second's wild alarm
  flung himself from its back and fell on the slippery descent. The horse,
  eased of its burden, made one desperate effort to stop, but the struggle only
  quickened its speed. With a neigh of terror it went over some abrupt brink
  into some gulf of waters. The sound of the fall was drowned in the greater
  noise, and Francis was scarcely aware of it till he himself, clutching wildly
  at the spongy soil, shot over the verge into a spray-filled chasm.</p>

  <p>He felt a great wash of waters over his head, and then with choking heart
  he came to the surface in the midst of a whirling, seething pool. He made
  feeble strokes for the shore, but all his efforts achieved was to carry him
  into the main line of the current. He felt himself being whirled downward,
  and then with a sickening thud he was driven against a rock. His left foot
  caught in a cranny. Down, far down, under the stream his head sank. He had no
  power to move his leg till by a merciful chance it slipped, and he was able
  once more to come to the top and ease his bursting heart. He felt his
  strength ebbing, and made futile clutches at every tuft of heather and
  jutting stone. But his hands had no power, and they all slipped from his
  grasp like the cords which a man in a nightmare lays hold on to drag himself
  from an abyss. It had soon been all over for this world with Mr. Francis
  Birkenshaw, if the storms of the last winter had not blown a rough pine-tree
  right athwart the torrent. The swollen waters lipped against its side, and he
  found himself washed close under the rugged bole. With despairing strength he
  gripped it and struggled till his head and breast lay over it. Then it was
  but a matter of time, and slowly inch by inch he worked his way to the bank
  and fell exhausted in a covert of bracken.</p>

  <p>He lay for half an hour with the water forming pools at his side and feet.
  Then he shivered and half-roused himself to ease his breath. The thought of
  his horse struck him; it had long since gone to death among the misty waters.
  He crawled to his feet and essayed to walk, and then for the first time he
  felt his feebleness. His left ankle was broken, a mere trailing encumbrance
  with a hot fire burning in the splintered bone. His faculty of thought began
  to return to him, and he weighed brokenly the difficulties of his position.
  Speed was his aim; ere now he should have been near the house of Lovat's
  cousin; and instead he was lying in a nameless ravine with his horse lost and
  his body maimed and shaken. He felt hazily that he was very ill, and at the
  helplessness of it all he leaned his head on a bank of heath and sobbed
  wearily.</p>

  <p>Then he set his teeth and began to drag himself from the place. A
  deer-track seemed to lead upwards, and thither he crawled. At the top of the
  chasm he saw a hill-slope to the right and a glen in front which seemed to
  promise easier walking. He tried hard to think out his whereabouts, for it
  might be that this stream flowed back to the Ness waters and in following it
  he would be returning upon his tracks. But his mind refused its duty, and he
  could get nothing but a blank confusion. He had no hope now of fulfilling his
  mission and scarcely any desire; all he sought was to reach a human dwelling
  and have rest from his agony. His body was the seat of pain of which his
  bruised ankle was the smallest part. It was so bitterly cold that even in his
  anguish he felt the hostility of the weather. For the grey mist was drawing
  closer, and the land was growing mossier and rougher. Slowly, laboriously he
  limped through the waste, sinking up to the knee in bog-pools, or falling
  heavily on banks of stone. He was so scourged by rain that his clothes seemed
  no cover to his nakedness; he felt bleached and scourged as a whitening bone
  among the rocks.</p>

  <p>Hitherto he had kept a tight curb upon his wandering wits. But as
  exhaustion grew upon him and the flickerings of hope died away, wild fancies
  arose, and he was hag-ridden by memory. He began to forget the disappointment
  of his errand,&mdash;how Mrs. Murray would call him faithless and believe him
  returned to his old paths, when all the while the Badenoch winds were blowing
  over his bones. He lost all immediate recollection, and in the stress of his
  physical want was back once more in the old Edinburgh days, busy picturing
  the gross plenty of the life. Now he was wearied, wet, and famishing, and as
  if to point the contrast there rose a vision of reeking suppers, of rich,
  greasy taverns, and blowsy serving-girls. His high sentiment of the past week
  was a thousand years away, and he revelled in the very unctuous vulgarity and
  dirt. There, at any rate, had been human warmth and comfort; and in that
  endless moorland his thoughts were lowered to the naked facts of life.</p>

  <p>The mist hung more loosely, and it was possible to see some yards in
  front, though the sight was blinded by a solid sheet of rain. Rocks and dwarf
  trees raised their heads like islands, and a chance bog-pool seemed so vast
  that he crazily fancied he had come to the sea-coast. The path was growing
  easier, and a flat valley-bottom seemed to be taking the place of the
  precipitous glen. A trail of fog looked for a moment like smoke, and he
  hailed it as a sign of human dwelling; but as the mirage grew commoner even
  the comfort of delusion failed him, and a horror of great darkness grew upon
  his soul. His wits were growing clearer&mdash;intolerably clear. He saw the
  whole wretched panorama of his misfortunes, and the blank ending which stared
  in his face. His mind was still in the bondage of old memories, and the
  revulsion sickened and drove him crazy. He stopped and leaned on a crag to
  give himself breath, and as in a flash the memory of Mrs. Murray and all her
  high world passed over him with disgust unutterable.</p>

  <p>"Curse her!" he cried. "Am I to be damned in hell for a woman's face?" He
  poured forth a torrent of hideous abuse to the bleak weather. But for that
  proud jade with her face and hair he would have been content to seek common
  pleasures and the luxury of the unscrupulous. She seemed to mock him out of
  the fog, mock him with her beauty and her arrogant eyes. Passion made him
  half a maniac. He leaped forward with a drawn sword, but it fell from his
  nerveless hand and slashed his knees. "May she grow old and poor and
  withered, may she be a thing of the streets, may her pride be crushed in the
  gutter, may she see her friends killed before her eyes, and may she be damned
  immortally at the end!" And then his maledictions died away in a moan of
  weakness.</p>

  <p>And now the cold seemed to have gone from the air, and his body grew hot
  with fever. Night was already beginning to turn the white wall of mist to
  black, and with the darkness came a surcease of storm. In still, dripping
  weather he stumbled onward down the valley. Flushes of heat passed over his
  face. Somewhere in his head a great wheel was revolving, and he forgot the
  pain of his foot in telling the number of its circles. One, two, three, he
  counted, six, ten, one hundred, and then he wandered into immensity.
  Something seemed to block his path, on which he hurled his weight
  despairingly. He felt himself borne back, and then the soft contact of the
  dripping earth, and the grip of a man's hand. Then the darkness deepened into
  unconsciousness.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A sudden flash of light pierced his brain, and he seemed to
  be staring glassily through his eyes. He saw light&mdash;a fire, and the
  outline of a dwelling. Men seemed crowded all about him, choking him, pushing
  him for room, and laughing with idiot laughter. One held a point of light in
  his hand, which seemed the gold of a ring. Hazily he was conscious that this
  was his ring, which Lord Lovat had given him, and even in his utter ruin of
  body he felt the aching of the finger from which it had been roughly pulled.
  He cried for it like a child, and then the whole concourse seemed to leap
  upon him and stifle the life from his heart.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The days passed into weeks and months while Francis lay
  helpless and raving. Once he awoke and found himself on a bed of brackens in
  a low-roofed, smoke-filled hut. Snow blocked the window, and he saw that it
  was the winter-time. But the thick odour of the peat-reek choked him, and he
  sank again into that terrible deep slumber which lies on the boundary of
  death. Meantime the people of the cottage went in and out on their work,
  nursing cheerfully the stranger who lay by the wall. They had found him in
  the last stage of weakness on the hill, and would have doubtless left him to
  die but for the chance of plunder. And when they brought him to the light
  they saw the chief's ring on his finger, so in all honesty, accepting this as
  a mandate from their lord, they had set themselves simply and ungrudgingly to
  nurse him to life. They were wretchedly poor, and could give him only the
  coarsest nourishment. The household, five in all, consisted of the father,
  Neil Mor na Cromag (Great Neil of the Shepherd's Crook, as the words mean),
  who was a herd of Lovat's on the farthest south-east hills of his territory.
  There were his wife and two sons, Rory, who played the pipes ravishingly, and
  Black John, who was his father's helper, both tall, well-grown men, who
  flourished on the rough fare and toilsome life. Then there was a girl just
  growing to womanhood, whose name Francis never heard, for all spoke of her as
  M'eudail or Caileag Beg, when they were well-pleased, or harsher names,
  Oinseach&mdash;witless or shameless&mdash;when they were angry. But for the
  most part they were good-humoured, for the Lovat men were g&eacute;nial, cunning,
  and abundantly humourous, very little like the short, dark Campbells or the
  fiery Stewarts. There was a cow in a shed not five feet from his couch, and
  three goats fed on the hill. Thence they got milk, and at times a kid to
  roast. Also Neil Mor would get a sheep for himself now and then at the
  gatherings of the herds, when he tossed the caber a yard further than any
  other, and he would sometimes take deer on the mountains and trout and salmon
  in the river. At times he even went down to the corn country, and bought
  bolls of fine meal, which all relished gladly after the tiresome diet of
  flesh and herbs. But they prospered all of them on the fare, and grew ruddy,
  full-blooded, and straight of limb. All day the men-folk were out on the
  hills, while the women cooked meals or carded wool in the firelight. Then at
  night Rory would get out his pipes and play springs which set the feet
  trembling, or sad wild strains of the men of old and the great kings of the
  North and the days that are gone. Sometimes, too, he played a lilt of the
  fairies who dwell in the green-wood and the crooks of glens, and the
  listeners would hush their breath and look to the barring of the door.</p>

  <p>In the height of his illness the people of the cottage had given Francis
  up for dead, and walked with stealthy step and spoke softly as befitting
  those with death in the house. The winter was mild, but some blasts of snow
  came from Monadliadh, and made the women heap on peats and wood and choke the
  room with smoke. All this was little good for the sick man who lay wrestling
  with fever. They had dressed his ankle and put it in the way of healing; but
  the more dangerous ailment was so little known to them that they came near to
  killing him altogether, for they used to bathe his brow with cold well-water,
  and allow him to toss the coverings from his body. But for his extreme
  strength he would have died in the first week. As it was, the fever burned
  him to a shadow and then fled, and he was left with just sufficient life to
  struggle through. For two days his life trembled; then his eager vitality
  triumphed, and slowly he began to mend.</p>

  <p>The people had little English, and they were so far from the chief's
  dwelling that they heard nothing of what happened. Francis in his ravings had
  often mentioned Lovat's name, and they heard with nods of recognition,
  arguing that this was some trusted friend of the great lord's. When dawning
  consciousness brought him power of speech, the whole miserable and futile
  tale of his misfortunes was clear in his memory, and he realised how bitterly
  he had failed. He strove to find out the turn of events from his hosts, but
  one and all they were ignorant. They knew dimly of a certain Tearlach, who
  was said to be a Stewart and a king, and they had heard that all the Rannoch
  and Athole men and the western clans had taken the field with him. But it was
  as nothing to them, for the old kings of Scots had no place in their
  mythology, which embraced so many other kings, and no straggler of Tearlach's
  had ever strayed to their door. But they told him of other things, all the
  simple talk of their narrow world; and strangely enough, these men who had
  rescued him with designs of plunder now cheered his recovery as if he had
  been their own blood-brother. Rory would play him soft, low tunes on the
  pipes, and John would tell of the days of herding and hunting; and every one
  waited on him with grave, silent courtesy.</p>

  <p>But on the girl fell the chief share of his entertainment. She was little
  compared with her tall brothers, but wonderfully slim and active, with eyes
  like sloes, hair blown over brow, and a crooning voice. In the early days of
  his recovery, while he still lay on his back, she would give him food and
  bend over him with strange Gaelic caresses in the frankness of innocent pity.
  She was never more than half-dressed, for indoors her breast and shoulders
  were always bare, and outside a plaid was all their covering. Then as he grew
  stronger and the early spring came, he would lean on her as he hobbled out of
  doors, and sit by her side on the green bank above the stream or in the midst
  of birches on the hill. As colour came back to his cheeks and some of his old
  vigour to his frame, it may be that the simple child fell in love with the
  tall stranger. Be this as it may, no thought on the matter ever crossed his
  mind. He endured her pitying caresses and the warm touch of her skin without
  a tremor. He had never been the prey of such emotions, and now he was
  something less than before. The fever had purged him of much of his old
  fervour, and raised, as it were, a bar between this new man and his old life.
  The one thing which survived strong and vivid from the wreck of memory was
  the image of the lady who had sent him on this errand, and even in the
  thought of this goddess his former boyish sentiment had departed. It was a
  grave, old-featured man who looked down the glen of an afternoon and prayed
  for the return of full strength and tried to redd the tangle of his
  affairs.</p>

  <p>Then at last it befell that one evening Neil Mor returned from a
  lambing-visit to the Nairnside with news. Tearlach had come again, this time
  from the South, with a great tail of dhuinewassels and Sassenach lords, and a
  following of Macdonalds and the like. Also the folk said that the Southron
  forces were waiting for him in the North and that a great battle would be
  fought ere the moon was old. Francis puzzled over this word, and by dint of
  counting the weeks of his own illness, guessed at the truth. Some great
  misfortune had overtaken the Prince in the South, and he had returned hither
  to make his stand. His services might still be wanted. The whole news was so
  vague that he might yet have the chance to fulfil his errand. So with new
  hope he set about brushing his garments and preparing for the way.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br>
  The Prince's Cabinet of War.</h2>

  <p class="first">Black John set him some miles on his way, leading him down
  glen and up corry till he brought him out on the strath of Nairn. The day was
  warm for a northern spring, and the guide grew exceeding cheerful and hymned
  the joys of war. "There will be braw battles," he cried, "for all the craws
  will be fleeing north, and they are the birds that ken." Sometimes they met a
  lonely shepherd, and then John would stop for a parley in Gaelic and leave
  Francis to find the path for a mile or so alone. But when once they sighted
  the broad river valley, he left him with shrill farewells. "If seed o' mine
  meet seed o' yours," he said, "brothers they sall be," and he spat in his
  hand and clasped his parting guest's.</p>

  <p>And now it was clearly the seat of war, for the tracks in the vale were
  rough with ruts and all the meadowland was trampled. There were few houses in
  the land&mdash;now and then a turf sheiling on the brae-face and once the
  grey wall of a castle; but the place was Lowland and habitable contrasted
  with the wild country he had dwelled in. He had already walked far, and soon
  his head began to swim with faintness. It was a long toil for a man so lately
  sick, and it was with many pauses and long, helpless reclinings on the
  wayside heather that he made the journey. He had a desperate fear of falling
  ill a second time,&mdash;a thing bitter to dream of now on the very seat of
  war. And yet his hopes hung on the frail thread of his strength, so with
  circumspect and elderly care he nursed his body, choosing dry places to lie
  on, drinking but moderately from the hillburns, and sipping the whisky which
  he had carried out with him from the morning.</p>

  <p>One man only he met in all that green, silent vale. This was a pedlar with
  a pack, a man seemingly half-witted, but to Francis' delight able to speak
  Scots easily. When he met him he was swinging on, with a vacant eye on the
  hill-tops, singing some nonsensical catch. He was about to pass without
  noticing his presence, but Francis stopped him short and asked him the way.
  Clearly there could be no danger in getting news of the land from a crazy
  packman.</p>

  <p>"Saw ye any soldiers," said Francis, "as ye came up the water?"</p>

  <p>The man with difficulty cut short his star-gazing and looked at the
  questioner.</p>

  <p>"Sodgers ay, sodgers mony," said he, and he went on with his
  singing,&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"If ye hae plenty and winna gie,<br>
  Besouthen, Besouthen!<br>
  The deil will get ye when ye dee,<br>
  And awa' by southron toun!"</p><br>

  <p>Francis weariness made him cross. "Where saw ye them?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There were some at the Nairn and mae at Iverness and mony mae at the
  Spey-side," said the man. "There'll be war, bluidy war, and mony deid at
  Beltane."</p>

  <p>"Then where is the Prince's army?"</p>

  <p>"Whatna Prince?" said the man, dreamily.</p>

  <p>For answer Francis took him by the collar and shook him soundly.</p>

  <p>"Give me a plain answer, you fool. Ye may be daft, but ye are none so daft
  as that."</p>

  <p>The man looked at him quizzically. "See here, my freend," he said, "if ye
  are an honest man like me and nae moss-trooper, but traivellin' for your ain
  eedification, when ye meet a man in thae camsteery times ye'll let on that
  ye're no quite wise. It's the safest way. As for the Prince, as ye ca' him,
  he's in Inverness; but Cumberland's at Nairn, and they say that Chairlie will
  march out to Culloden the nicht to be ready for him."</p>

  <p>"And Culloden," said Francis, "where is it?"</p>

  <p>"Ten mile doun the haughs when ye win by the hills and come to the land
  muir. And guid day to ye, freend." The man went off, and as if anxious to
  keep his hand in, fell back on his old melody. Francis heard the words
  quavering down the road,&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"My shoon are made o' the red-coo's hide,<br>
  Besouthen, Besouthen!<br>
  My feet are cauld, I canna bide,<br>
  And awa' by southron toun!"</p><br>

  <p>Those last ten miles were not far from the limits of his endurance, but
  with teeth set fast in his lips and his knees knoitering he accomplished
  them. A great wide plain running straight to the sea-line lay before him; so
  vast it was that it looked like the beginning of a shoreless ocean. Woods
  seemed to rise on the far right, and to the left the dim points of spires,
  while many scores of miles away over Firth and haughland rose blue ridges of
  mountain. Not half a mile off a bald, square house stood in the waste, and
  all around was rough with heather and ridges of moor.</p>

  <p>But what chiefly caught his eye was the stir around the house, a great
  armament of men already in camp, and straggling lines still coming from the
  North. It was already almost sunset, and fires were being lit in the hollows
  of the moss, and rough tents stretched on their poles. Troops of horse seemed
  to move about like pawns on a board, and even at the distance he could hear
  distinct words of command. And yet it was not the sight of a great army
  entrenched, but rather of a gathering of reiving bands, already in the act of
  moving. The chimneys of the house smoked as if it were well inhabited, and
  the sight of men hurrying in and out proclaimed it the Prince's quarters.</p>

  <p>The first sentry he met was a wild man of the Camerons, who had scarce a
  word of English, and showed much desire to dispute the passage. As it was, he
  marched by his side with drawn claymore, till he handed him to a more civil
  clansman with many warnings. Francis found himself led through a line of
  bivouacs to what seemed to be the limits of a garden. There he trod the
  relics of a lawn, all trampled into ruts, with the bushes torn to ribbons and
  field-pieces lying blackly in the twilight. At the house door two sentries in
  kilts stood negligently, while a dozen ragged wretches quarrelled before the
  threshold. From within came a great riot as of many men speaking at once,
  mingled with shrill wailing from some miserable women who cowered in the
  shadow. Even in the mysterious half-light of the spring dusk the place and
  people seemed tattered, dishevelled, and ill-ordered. This was no camp of a
  conquering force; rather the hopeless last standing-ground of desperate men.
  Every face was pinched like his own, and their clothing was sadly worn. The
  hollow eyes had the look of famine, and weariness blinked in their unheeding
  looks.</p>

  <p>He was led through the hall up a narrow oak staircase to a room above the
  chief door of the house. Here he had to give an account of his errand; before
  "business with the Prince" had been sufficient pass-word. But now he must
  declare himself the bearer of a letter, news of moment to the Cause. He had
  no thought of the nature of his reception. He had his duty to do, to give the
  letter; this fact alone in his weakness was clear to his brain. He was months
  late; events to change an era might have come to pass while he lay helpless;
  after all, it was but an empty errand to fulfil the letter of his mission;
  and then&mdash;ah, then he might wander to the ends of the earth and leave
  the struggle. An overwhelming desire for rest and sleep was upon him, and he
  faced the ordeal of the council-room with scarcely a thought.</p>

  <p>Five men sat up and down the room, one at a table busily writing, another
  in a great arm-chair by the fire, and the three others taking off their boots
  at the hearth. The soldier&mdash;one of Cluny's Macphersons&mdash;walked to
  the man in the chair with a rough salute and told him Francis' errand. Then
  he closed the door, and the messenger advanced heavily to the company.</p>

  <p>He in the chair was a slim young man dressed in the somewhat tarnished
  splendour of stained tartans, dusty lace, and dull gold braiding. His hair
  was powdered badly in patches, and his whole air was of unrest and weariness.
  Dark hollows lay below his eyes, and his cheek-bones stood out so sharply
  that he seemed to be smiling. Something of grace, of delicate breeding and
  long-descended pride, lay in his mien, but he was so huddled with lassitude
  that one could not judge him. He looked up drearily as Francis entered, and
  then with the forced grace of kingship asked him his business.</p>

  <p>"I am the bearer of a letter from the Lord Lovat to your Highness," said
  Francis, and he laid it humbly in his hand.</p>

  <p>At the word all looked more curiously, and the man at the table jumped to
  his feet. He was a big, handsome man with a large, well-formed face and
  little twinkling eyes. Here in this land of want he seemed the one thing
  prosperous, for there was something lawyer-like and diplomatic in his smooth
  forehead and mobile, twitching lips. He stood watching his master with eager
  eyes as he broke the seal.</p>

  <p>At the first look the Prince cried out and flung the letter to the other.
  "Why, man, it is dated from October. The thing is months old, and you come
  with it here! What has delayed you, in Heaven's name, or do you think this is
  a fitting time to play a fool's pranks on desperate men?"</p>

  <p>Francis heard him only as if far away. His weariness had come over him as
  he stood, and a sea of angry men seemed to be rising on all sides. He
  staggered, and caught at the table to save himself.</p>

  <p>"Tut, the man is ill," cried the Prince, with ready sympathy, and he
  poured out a glass of wine from a bottle at his elbow and handed it to
  Francis. "It's ill speaking with a fainting man."</p>

  <p>Meantime the Secretary had read the letter carefully through with his face
  puckered in smiles. "So," he said, "this is Lovat's confession of faith!
  Little he thinks that it has just reached us, or I'll warrant the Frasers
  would be anywhere but in the field;" and he passed it to a tall man in
  tartans who had risen from the hearth.</p>

  <p>"But I am waiting on your answer," said the Prince. "How comes it that you
  are so far behind the day?"</p>

  <p>The tall man read the letter and threw it on the table. "It's a thing of
  no value," he said; "ye may burn it whenever ye like. But tell me, sir, [this
  to Francis] how ye came to keep the thing back?"</p>

  <p>Francis' ears were humming again, and he looked helplessly from one to the
  other. "I fell ill," he said aimlessly; "I fell ill somewhere in the hills
  and am just now recovered."</p>

  <p>"A likely story!" cried the tall man, but the Prince bade him hold his
  peace. "The man's condition speaks for itself, my lord," he said; "he has the
  look of one walking in delirium."</p>

  <p>"But who in God's name are ye?" cried the Secretary. "I have never seen ye
  in my life, and kenned nothing of your errand to the Lord Lovat."</p>

  <p>Francis put a strong grip on his wits and answered him. "It was at the
  bidding of Mrs. Murray of Broughton that I went that road."</p>

  <p>"Oh, ho," said the man, whistling softly, "and that was one of Meg's
  ploys. Well, well, she kens her own mind as well as most," and he fell to
  turning up a small book of memoranda. "Here it is," he cried, "written with
  her own hand. 'Mr. Francis Birkenshaw sent to a great Gentleman in the North,
  September 29. M. M.' Well, Mr. Francis Birkenshaw, ye have made a bonny hash
  of the business."</p>

  <p>Now Francis heard the rest scarcely at all, but the mention of Mrs. Murray
  pierced clearly to his dazed wits. Who was this smooth, sleek man to talk of
  her thus? His hands itched to get at his throat.</p>

  <p>But the Prince saved him by breaking in. "Let the poor fellow alone, Mr.
  Murray; it's no time for recrimination. God knows we're all in the devil's
  own mess, and there's not one to mend another."</p>

  <p>In a moment Francis' wits were awake and he was staring hard at the
  Secretary. This, then, was her husband. He had pictured a strong, silent man,
  wise in council and great in battle, one stern, proud, irreconcilable. And
  this was the real thing, this man who looked almost elderly, who had the air
  of a cunning lawyer rather than a great captain! He had been ready to hate or
  worship Murray of Broughton, to resent bitterly his unattainable power or to
  follow him with the hopeless loyalty that bound him to his wife. Instead he
  found a man he could all but despise, and his heart rejoiced. If he were
  unworthy of the lady's glance, still more was this thing that called her
  wife.</p>

  <p>"We will put off Mr. Birkenshaw's story to a happier time," said the
  Secretary. "Meantime it may rejoice him to hear that the clan of Fraser has
  been in the field for months. No ill, trust me, sir, has been done by your
  misfortune, save that our deep affection for the Lord Lovat had had some time
  to wait for confirmation." And he folded the letter and placed it in his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>Then the men turned to other matters and fell a-talking. Francis still
  stood gazing at the coals and leaning on the table, uncertain of his purpose
  and too weary to care. He heard much talk of the mad surprise-party which
  Lord George was to lead that very night, and he noted that this Athole man
  was the only one of the Council who had the air of brisk, soldierly bravado.
  He talked boldly of success, and stirred the others to some hope. The
  Secretary still sat quiet at the table, drumming with his fingers, and the
  Prince had risen and was walking uneasily about the room. Months of hazard
  had left their mark on him, for his eye had no brightness and his step
  halted; he looked like one on the eve of a great crisis, so much depressed by
  the overwhelming chance that even the uttermost defeat would set him at peace
  with himself. One thing burned into Francis' memory. Charles came near the
  window and looked out to the wild camping-scene. Then he turned drearily to
  the fireplace. "My lords," he said, "we are a little people and a poor. It is
  the war of the stag against the hunters." And, leaning his head on the wall,
  he burst into tears in his foreign fashion, while the grave lords around him
  looked on wonderingly.</p>

  <p>Then he raised his head, and seeing the drooping Francis, was recalled to
  his business. Calling a sentry he bade him send for Golis Macbean. "You will
  be better for a long sleep, Mr. Birkenshaw," he said, "and on the morrow you
  will be fresher for the difficult job before us. I will give you in charge of
  one of my own body-servants, who will see to your quarters." Then, turning to
  the Secretary, "And what are your plans, Mr. Murray?" he asked. "Will you
  stay here or go back to Inverness? I should recommend the latter, for this
  will scarcely be a safe place for a sick man."</p>

  <p>"I will go back to Inverness," said the Secretary, dolefully. "My legs are
  no fit to carry me two yards. These humours of the body affect me painfully,
  and though I grieve to part from your Highness' side, yet I am more in the
  nature of an encumbrance than an aid."</p>

  <p>Francis looked at him and saw that for all his air of health, the man was
  indeed sick, for his face flushed and paled irregularly, and when he rose his
  legs tottered below him. But the sight of him wakened a remembrance in his
  mind, and he turned to him doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"It's a small thing that I have to ask, but I promised my Lord Lovat that
  the letter would be destroyed when the clan came out. I have to beg you to
  lay it on the fire and so set me free of my promise."</p>

  <p>"What a daft-like request!" said the Secretary, laughing. "It shall be
  done of course, for it is not the custom of the honest side to keep
  incriminating scrawls. Set your mind at ease, Mr. Birkenshaw, I will see it
  done."</p>

  <p>Then he hobbled from the room with many apologies. A minute after a huge
  man entered and bowed at the Prince's hand. "Take this gentleman, Golis,"
  said the Prince, "and see that he has some refreshment and as comfortable
  quarters as may be. It will be a poor recompense for his misfortunes."</p>

  <p>Francis followed the big man through the house into a small out-building
  where a fire burned with beds stretched round it. Here he was given some
  food, coarse and scanty, and with the remnants of the whisky-flask he washed
  down his supper. His attendant clearly had little English, for he sat and
  watched him stolidly through the meal. Outside a small rain was beginning to
  fall, and beat through the broken window. The place was full of the sighing
  of wind, and as he lay down before the sputtering fire, Francis felt that he
  was indeed in a land forlorn, waiting the last extremity of a dying
  cause.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He slept the dreamless sleep of exhaustion till near
  midnight, when he was awakened by a noise of men and horses,&mdash;the return
  of the fruitless night-expedition. When he woke again it was early morning,
  and Golis was shaking him. He felt almost vigorous; the weakness of the night
  before had gone, and though his limbs ached he was no longer the feeble
  wanderer on the verge of faintness. Golis brought him food, and when asked of
  the events of the night shook his head dolefully. "It was no good," he said,
  "for the road was as black as hell and they made ower muckle noise. Some they
  were wantin' to go on, but Lord George he wad not agree, and the Prince, Got
  bless him, is very thrawn. It will have been a bad night's work for all." And
  he relapsed into taciturnity.</p>

  <p>Half in a dream Francis heard the drums and the skirl of the pipes, and
  found himself looking over the level moor to where it grew black with
  Cumberland's troops. He saw the new addition of Frasers and Macdonalds, he
  watched the marching of the clan-regiments to position with the far-away
  interest of a spectator at a show. One thing he saw clearly, that the
  Loyalists were utterly outnumbered, and in their ragged, starved look he saw
  the premonition of death. Once Charles passed him and greeted him with a
  smile. "You will be still too weak for this work, Mr. Birkenshaw, so you had
  better stay behind with me and my attendants." Then as the forenoon wore on
  and the enemy grew so near that he could see the outline of their features
  and the details of their dress, they opened a cannonade on the Highland army,
  which was answered as best they could. It was the signal for the fight, and
  as the Prince rode down the ranks with brave words on his lips, the men
  answered with that cheering which only the desperate raise,&mdash;the fierce
  cry of hopeless bravado.</p>

  <p>From his position in the rear he saw the whole battle at his feet. A wild
  blast of snow came down from the northeast sheer in the face of the Highland
  lines. In the teeth of the storm the long ranks of the hopeless pulled bonnet
  over brow, set their teeth, and went forth into the mist. It was no ordered
  charge, for the Macintoshes had broken away without word of command, and the
  Athole men, the Camerons, the Frasers, and the Macleans followed in a
  tempestuous rush. As if from far off came the noise of the meeting, and then
  through the hail there came a glimpse of a wild m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, of heaped ranks of the
  dead, and a deadly phalanx of foes. But there at least was the shock and fury
  of fight. On the left wing all was different. The Macdonalds stood rigid,
  like pawns on a board, their ranks ploughed up by the enemy's musketry, too
  proud to fight in their ignoble position,&mdash;men with the face of death
  hewing at the heath with their swords in an impotent fury. In the murky
  weather and the loud din of war Francis could not see the close of that
  bitter drama. Though the Duke of Perth implored them to follow him, declaring
  that thenceforth he would call himself Macdonald, though their own chieftain
  Keppoch besought them with tears not to shame his name, the stubborn
  irreconcilables stood still, waiting upon death. As the whole Highland lines
  were broken, and clan after clan fled to the South, the Macdonalds too gave
  way. Not so their chief. "My God, the children of my race have forsaken me!"
  said he, and with pistol and sword he rushed to his doom among the advancing
  lines.</p>

  <p>In a very little it was all over. The host seemed to recoil upon its
  rear-guards, and in a trice Francis was swept wildly back by a rabble of
  dying and wounded. He was separated from the Prince and Golis, enclosed fast
  in a haggard troop who with wild eyes and wilder lamentations staggered over
  the heather. Their faces dripped with blood and sweat; many were gashed to
  the open bone, and every now and then one sank on the ground to be trodden
  under by the panic-stricken. Behind was a broad pavement of carnage, up and
  down which rode the English horse, slaying the hale and giving the last
  stroke to the dying. The air sickened with the hot, fresh smell of blood, and
  as they fled Francis' old sickness came back on him and he well-nigh fainted.
  At last the rout grew thinner as it widened out on the extremity of the moor,
  and with a sob of fatigue he sank in a hollow among the rushes.</p>

  <p>He lay for a little choking with the new excitement, listening to the
  thunderous trampling of hooves which seemed to assault the heavens. These
  moments were his salvation, for the van of cavalry passed by after the others
  and left the moor open to the right for escape. In a little he got to his
  feet and looked out. The air was still dim with snow and powder, but he saw
  scattered troops riding up and down, and the dull red blotch on the heath
  where the fight had been hottest. He had no plan of flight save to regain the
  hills he had left, haply to find Lord Lovat and share his fortunes. But when
  he tried to walk he found his legs bending under him, and he was dismally
  conscious that at this pace he would fall an easy victim to any wandering
  trooper.</p>

  <p>At that moment a horseman appeared on the right, galloping hard toward
  him, an English orderly on a good mount, looking spick and clean even from
  the dust of battle. Francis, haggard and silent, crouched in the heather; it
  was his one chance for life, and he was desperate. The man came nearer,
  riding easily, with a pleased smile on his face as of a bloodless conqueror.
  Suddenly a wild man rose from the earth and gripped him by the leg. A pistol
  cracked into the air, and a bullet splashed in a bog-pool; the next instant
  the elegant young gentleman was rolling in mud, and Francis was trying
  wearily to mount the frightened beast. Lying like a sack on its back, he
  suffered it to bear him whither it pleased; then slowly and painfully he
  clambered upright in the saddle and found rein and stirrup. The horse went
  back on its haunches, and Francis stared round the blurred landscape, seeking
  direction. He found it in the sight of old Culloden house rising bare on the
  right, and thither he turned. At the wall of the courtyard he found a party
  of dragoons set round a huge man who alone and wounded to the death still
  kept a fierce front to his assailants. A dozen lay dead around him; his head
  was gashed on either side, his breast bled freely from bayonet stabs, and he
  could scarcely stand with a broken thigh-bone. Francis recognised Golis, his
  friend of the morning, and with a cry to him to bear up, he urged his horse
  towards him. After all, death must come, thought he, and this seemed a
  fitting place and time. But Fortune would have none of such aimless heroism.
  A stray bullet grazed his horse's flank and set that already maddened beast
  off in a wild fury to the South. Francis could only cling feebly, careless
  whither he went and praying vainly for some rest from this awful toil.</p>

  <p>Of a sudden he found himself in the thick of a party riding pell-mell from
  the moor to the hills. A man looked up and recognised him.</p>

  <p>"Who are ye for?" said Francis, dismally.</p>

  <p>"For the Prince," said the man.</p>

  <p>"And where is he?" asked Francis.</p>

  <p>The man pointed to a little body somewhat in front, with a man in soiled
  fine clothes in the middle, hurried along on a weary horse led by a barefoot
  Highlander.</p>

  <p>"There goes your master," said the man, "and this is the end of an auld
  sang."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br>
  After Culloden.</h2>

  <p class="first">By midday the line of fugitives was in the thick of the dark
  hills, with Francis sitting dumb on his horse and puzzling his poor wits with
  vain projects. A council had been held at the Nairnside when they crossed the
  Ford of Falie. Thence the remains of the troops were sent to Ruthven in
  Badenoch, while the Prince with some dozen of a suite set out for the West.
  Francis went with him, caring little where he went so long as the way took
  him far from the accursed field. By chance he had heard the name of Fraser
  and Lovat linked with their destination. The words were centres round which
  to gather his wandering wits. Drearily he felt that as his mission had been
  to Lovat, so he must see it through to the end. The Cause was lost; why,
  then, he must perish with the Cause, and as he had drawn the old lord into
  the affair, he must get to his side in the disastrous climax.</p>

  <p>But his horse was wearied and wounded, and its rider was foolish with
  sickness. So at the house of Faroline he began to lag behind the party, and
  two miles further had given up the vain effort. In the sleet of midday he
  managed still to follow their tracks, but when the weather cleared in the
  early afternoon he saw them many miles ahead in the extremity of the glen.
  The sky changed to an April blue, and with the warmth and freshness his
  exhaustion grew less burdensome. He stopped and bathed in a roadside tarn
  till the mire of battle was washed off, and then with more spirit he crossed
  the nick of the pass and came out on a wide, boggy moor with the great square
  house of Gortuleg set in the middle, and a few wretched sheilings jumbled
  into a clachan by the highway. There was no man in sight; clearly the
  Prince's party had but halted for a moment and gone on. The moss-pools were
  shining blue, and a great crying of birds enlivened the stillness, while
  through the midst gleamed the links of a slow stream.</p>

  <p>The great house was in disorder, for the door stood wide to the wall and
  from within came the shrill cry of women. The news had already reached them,
  and there was mourning for a lost cause and ruined fortunes. The hall was
  empty and littered with a confusion of cloaks and riding-gear, with
  half-cooked food placed at random. A little girl stood weeping by the
  stair-foot, and at the sight of Francis ran screaming down a passage. The
  place was like a house seen in a bad dream, where all things are upside down
  and no human being appears. But Francis was beyond ceremony. He knew the
  place for a dwelling of the Frasers, and here he could not fail to have news
  of the chief. So he climbed the stairs heavily, only to find a worse
  confusion above, and some dozen ragged serving-girls who fled like rats at
  his approach. He opened the door of a room which was empty and stripped of
  all furniture. Again and again he tried, but all alike were tenantless. Then
  at a little room in the far corridor he found the door locked and heard the
  sound as of some one moving within. Angry with his aimless search, he put his
  shoulder to the wood and drove the hasp back. As the door flew open a little
  chamber was revealed with a dying fire on the hearth and an old man sitting
  hunched up in a chair. The figure turned a quick eye to the intruder, and
  Francis saw with joy that it was Lovat himself.</p>

  <p>"Come in, sir," said the old man. "Come in, and God speed ye if your
  errand be fair." And he turned a face of such dumb misery, such baffled wrath
  at war with the feebleness of age, that Francis took two steps forward and
  then came to a standstill. He knew that he was not recognised, and, all
  unknown, was the spectator of the tragedy of a career.</p>

  <p>"Come in, man, I say," piped the old voice. "If ye are a freend, what news
  bring ye o' the last dispensation?" And he turned his ambiguous eyes upon the
  newcomer to give a further shade of doubt to his ambiguous words.</p>

  <p>But something caught his notice in Francis' face and awakened
  recollection. He pulled himself up in his chair and glared at the other.
  "Is't you?" he cried, "you, the man that played the hell wi' my fortunes and
  set me out on a daft venture! Come awa in, Mr. Birkenshaw, for 'faith ye're a
  welcome guest. Ye're the man of honour to be sure, and ye've come to gloat
  ower the issue of your wark. Ay," he cried shrilly, "it was your accursed
  tongue and your damnable clash that has been the ruin o' an auld man and a
  loyal people. Ye'd best see your job to the end. There's no a man in this
  house, nothing but greetin' women. If ye have sic an animosity to the name o'
  Lovat, here's an auld life wad thank ye for a speedy quittance. I kenna if
  ye're still for the Prince, since you gentry have a trick of keeping your
  honour and your pouches on the bieldy side o' the wall; but if so be ye are,
  here's auld Simon Fraser who wad drink damnation to the Prince for leading
  him sic a road. Simon's a renegade, do ye hear? He renounces the Stuarts and
  a' their warks. So do to him as ye think fit. Or if ye are for King George,
  ye see before ye a man who sent his folk to the forefront o' the battle, one
  who canna look for mercy and doesna seek it." And he held out his great hands
  and craned his neck as if for a blow.</p>

  <p>The sight and the words sickened Francis. The trivial inflation of the
  talk, the luring cajolery of the eyes, were hateful to one who had just
  ridden from the naked terrors of war. Remorse for his share in this man's
  fate slipped from him like a garment; he felt relieved, but he had also the
  bitterness that here had gone his last friend in the North. Had he found the
  Lovat of his former interview he had been ready to follow him to the death;
  now the last mooring had been cast from the bark of his unsteady
  fortunes.</p>

  <p>He turned to go, wearily, dismally, while the old lord yelled obscene
  reproaches through the open door. "Gang back to the jade that sent ye," he
  cried; "gang back to the weemen, man. Ye're ower empty and nice for the warld
  o' men." Then he did a queer thing, for with infinite difficulty he struggled
  to the window, and there watched Francis pick his way through the moss, till
  he was swallowed up in the smoky clachan.</p>

  <p>Meantime that unfortunate gentleman was in a sad temper. He had seen the
  degeneration of enthusiasm; he had been a witness to the palpable decay of a
  man's spirit. The sight of the great cumbrous body, leering, twisting in an
  agony of fear, made him despair of life. When he came to the village he found
  some makeshift for an inn in a two-roomed thatched cot, where a dirty
  red-haired man sold raw whisky and pointed out straw-beds to forlorn
  travellers. Francis had great arrears of sleep to overtake, his head rang,
  and his limbs ached from weakness. He ate what meal they could give him, and
  then asked for a place to sleep undisturbed. The landlord nodded, and led him
  to a garret between the ceiling and the thatch, where on a bed of bracken and
  heather those might sleep who desired rest and a hiding-place. The temper of
  the man was fast sinking to a dogged carelessness. In a few hours these hills
  would be scoured, and King George's men would be knocking at this very door.
  Let them come, let them take him; after all, a tow on the Carlisle walls
  would be a brave ending to an inglorious and hopeless life.</p>

  <p>The afternoon was hot after the storm and drew to a quiet evening. Without
  on the moor broken men passed at odd times, now sitting on a worn horse, now
  leading their mount, or haply merely stumbling on foot. They were the
  rearguard of the fugitive, for in an hour after there came a lonely party of
  horse, picking their way with many complaints. This in turn was the van of
  the pursuit, and from Culloden field to the West there would soon stretch a
  line of redcoats, and there would be no passage beyond the Stratherick
  hills.</p>

  <p>Francis slept on till the garret-loft was dark and stars twinkled through
  the thatch. Then there came a rattling of the ladder which disturbed his
  dreams. Half-dazed, he saw the landlord's red head thrust up, and the
  landlord's dirty fingers beckoning him down. From his wanderings he had
  learned the need of quick action, so he scrambled to his feet and followed,
  rubbing sleep from his eyes with weary knuckles. The red-haired man wore an
  air of secrecy, and he noted that the one door was closely bolted. Had the
  man not been clearly of the honest party, it would have savoured of betrayal.
  But when he entered the room he saw the reason of the thing. An old fleshy
  man lay groaning on a sedan-chair which had been set near the fire. "It's the
  chief himsel'," said the innkeeper, urging Francis forward and retreating
  nervously to the back. "It's the great Lord Lovat."</p>

  <p>The door closed with a clang, and the pair were left together. Francis
  with drowsy brain looked hard at the unwieldly presence before him. Then
  Lovat checked his groanings, recognised him, and cried out in the kindliest
  tones.</p>

  <p>"Ye'll excuse my ill-tongue in the morning, Mr. Francis. I was the deil's
  ain plaything wi' the gout. Ach, the unholy gripes, they play hell-fire wi' a
  man's speerit and mainners. Forget an auld man's clavers. I have come the
  night at sair bodily discomfort to make it up wi' ye. And oh, sir, is this
  not an awful thing that has happened?"</p>

  <p>Francis drew his breath short and sat down. Culloden was still too raw in
  his memory to speak of it lightly. "I have an explanation to make to you, my
  lord. I was a poor carrier of your letter. I had not gone twenty miles in
  this vile country when I met with an accident which laid me on my back for
  months in a hillside cottage among your own clansmen. I have to thank your
  ring for the hospitality. It's not a week since I recovered, and it was only
  yesterday that I gave the Prince your letter. The clan had been long out, the
  thing was so much waste paper, the Secretary said; but though the time was
  bye I had to complete my errand."</p>

  <p>He stopped, appalled by the change on the old man's face. He scrambled
  from his chair, seized Francis' hand, and mumbled it like a child. "Ye havena
  given the letter, my dear laddie! Blithe news, bonny news. There's life in
  the auld dowg yet, gentlemen." And then, as he dimly heard the last words,
  his mirth ceased. He flung the hand from him, lay back like a snarling dog,
  and gloomed from beneath shaggy brows. "Just yestreen, nae further back than
  yestreen," he moaned, "and I was a safe man. A merciful God stretches the
  doited creature on a sick bed, and the thing defeats the purposes of the
  Almighty by rinnin' to the Prince, like a leevin' corp, and giein' him my bit
  letter. And now there's a rope round Simon's craig as sure as if King
  Geordie's self had tied it. Oh that a Fraser had stuck a dirk intil ye afore
  ye did the evil! What for in God's name was I sae daft as to gie ye the ring?
  Ye micht have fund fine clean caller burial in the Stratherick heather, and
  nae man been the wiser or the waur. Eh, hech, the auld man and the puir
  people!" and he sighed with maudlin pity.</p>

  <p>Francis saw the position at a glance. The clan had been sent out while the
  chief thought that the Prince already had his letter. As the unhappy cause
  grew hopeless they had not been recalled, doubtless because Lovat saw himself
  already involved beyond escape. Now, in the final desolation, on him as one
  of the greatest rebel lords the punishment must fall heavy. And the
  bitterness of it all was that but for this scrawl of a letter he might yet be
  safe. He himself had not taken the field; he might represent his clan's
  action as flat rebellion, the disobedience of a son.</p>

  <p>"The letter seems to stick in your throat," said Francis. "I had mind of
  your desire and asked the Secretary Murray to destroy it before me."</p>

  <p>"And you saw it done?" cried Lovat. "Say ye saw the damned thing in twenty
  pieces and I'll gie ye a' I hae in the warld."</p>

  <p>"The Secretary was ill and on the road for Inverness, so I dared not press
  him. He swore he would destroy it with his own hands, for it was not the
  custom of the honest party to do otherwise."</p>

  <p>"But did ye no see him dae it?" screamed the old man.</p>

  <p>"I confess I did not," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Then it's a' up. Murray o' Brochtoun has the letter. Had it been any
  ither man it would have mattered little. The Prince, Lord George, Lochiel,
  Keppoch, they're a' men o' honour, but the Murray&mdash;my God, the thing has
  faun intil the richt hands. Murray! His heart is as black as bog-water; he's
  an easy, canty man, what ye ca' a pleasant fellow, but I would sooner lippen
  to the traitor Judas than just this canny Murray."</p>

  <p>The man buried his face in his hands and rocked himself in his chair.</p>

  <p>Francis was in lamentable despair. In his heart he could not contradict
  Lovat's words, for he still had mind of the Secretary's eye, and he cursed
  his own inertness at the moment of parting. He had been culpably remiss, for
  he had played into a traitor's hands; and though the victim was no stranger
  to treachery, it was treachery of the open, braggadocio kind, and no cowardly
  fear of his skin. But as he looked at the figure before him repulsion began
  to choke his remorse. This ungainly man with white hair all dishevelled and a
  mottled, rubicund face who alternated between the foulest abuse and a
  beggar's flattery&mdash;it was hard to rise into heroics in such a cause. For
  a moment Francis clapped his hands to his head and looked into sheer vacancy.
  His wits wandered, he seemed to be leading a crazy, phantasmal life. Without
  was the black darkness of endless moors and hideous, ragged hills, men were
  seeking him as a fugitive, his whole course was that of a derelict without
  aim or hope; and within the sordid room was this phrasing chieftain, weeping
  senselessly or leering with the ugliness of age. He was astray on the very
  backbone of creation, tethered to a madman's company. The thought roused a
  ghastly humour, and sitting on the table he laughed shrilly till even Lovat
  stopped his moaning&mdash;the laughter of wits half-unhinged and a fainting
  body.</p>

  <p>"See here, my lord," he cried, "we are two men in misfortune. I have done
  you an ill turn, though I never intended it. But this is your own country. It
  cannot be hard to find faithful servants to carry you to the wilder hills,
  where you can bide till the blast blows by, and laugh at Murray and all his
  kind."</p>

  <p>"Dinna talk," said Lovat, solemnly. "The finger of God is upon me. I was
  intemperate in my youth, I loved wine and women, and now in my declining
  years I am carried whither I will not. I canna put foot to the ground on a
  carriage-road, and is it like I could gang on the stanes o' Corryarrick?
  Forbye I must traivel wi' mony little elegancies and necessaries for the
  toilet and the stamach. I am no rude barbarian, sir, to be ready to flee at a
  moment's notice. I am an auld man wi' an uncommon experience o' the warld and
  its ways, and some pretensions to fashion. Is it no a peetiful thing that I
  must tak to the muirs like a bog-blitter?"</p>

  <p>He had raised his head and twisted his extraordinary face into an
  expression of grave sorrow.</p>

  <p>"I do not presume to advise your course," said Francis. "I only say that
  whatever you may choose I am willing to share its danger."</p>

  <p>Lovat looked him up and down gravely.</p>

  <p>"There's some sense in that thick heid o' yours, Mr. Birkenshaw. But what
  will ye serve? Ye will be but another mouth to feed."</p>

  <p>"Also another sword in extremity," said Francis, dryly. He felt himself
  bound to stand by this strange man, in whose ill-fortune he had had some
  hand. It was his one remaining duty, and irksome though it was he had braced
  his mind to it. But this reception of his generosity damped him sorely.</p>

  <p>The thing so set his teeth on edge that he resolved with obstinacy to see
  the game to the end.</p>

  <p>"Do you accept me, my lord?" he said humbly.</p>

  <p>But Lovat had seen fit to change his mood. He adopted a gushing,
  patriarchical kindness and welcomed him with effusion. "I accept you," he
  cried. "Ye are my one true freend, my one support, the son of my old age. May
  the Lord in Heaven reward ye for standing by an auld man in the day of his
  affliction. I can give ye nocht in return but my blessing." And there and
  then he pronounced solemn beatitudes on the confused Francis with the air of
  a desert saint.</p>

  <p>At the door his natural manners returned. "Keep the door wide open, ye
  gander," he yelled. "Can a camel win through the eye of a needle or an auld
  gross man through a key-hole?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>
  Crabbed Age and Youth.</h2>

  <p class="first">In two hours Francis found himself at the tail of a little
  troop of men heading across the hills to the North. There were four stout
  bearers, for Lovat could move only in a litter, three strong fellows who
  carried food, and one special servant of the chief,&mdash;these were all the
  House of Gortuleg could muster. The night was moonless, but the men picked
  their way with surprising rapidity over the break-neck land. At first they
  seemed to traverse an interminable ascent, up which the bearers struggled
  with short breath. Then at a ridge they dipped all but sheer into a woody
  valley, where thickets of birch and ash made a tanglewood around a brawling
  river. In a little they lighted on the shore of a loch at a place where a
  cottage was built and a boat lay beached. The thing was rough and tarry, but
  four strong arms sent it quickly across the moonlit water. Then began another
  dreary climb, this time up a rocky cleft in the hills, where fine hill-gravel
  made the feet slip and an incessant dust troubled the eye. Once more they
  were on the high moors, crossing one shoulder of hill, skirting another great
  barrier ridge, till Francis&mdash;East-country bred&mdash;felt a whiff of
  salt in the air and knew the near presence of the sea. His legs ached with
  travel, he had been hurried since midnight up dale and over mountain at a
  speed which he could only marvel at. These tall men, even with the burden of
  a litter, could cover their hills like a good horse on a level road. For
  himself he was all but broken down; only the thought of the sneering Lovat
  kept him from yielding to exhaustion.</p>

  <p>Just before dawn they came to the last ridge and looked down on a green
  strath with a firth lying pale in the midst of it. The place looked faint and
  far-away in the haze of night, save that in the foreground an angry glow told
  of burning dwellings. The men stopped and looked over the edge with scowling
  faces and harsh Gaelic oaths. Lovat himself awoke from his broken sleep and
  made shift to look down on the valley. Instantly his brows grew dark, and he
  cried shrilly for Francis. "Look there," he cried, "that is my braw house, my
  ain Castle Dounie, loweing like a pharos on a rock." His tone was
  half-jocular, but in a moment his rage mastered him. "God, my lads," he
  cried, "if I had just my fingers on your thrapples, I'd thraw them fine and
  send your gutsy sauls to the deil that begat them." He clenched his thick
  hands and remained staring at the sight. But soon rage gave place to deep
  self-pity, and in a little he was moaning on his back for the hours he had
  once dwelled in it, and calling on his fathers to pity their miserable
  son.</p>

  <p>With the open daylight they shifted their course to the wilder parts, and
  marched with frequent pauses in the deep recesses of the hills. Lovat slept,
  snoring loudly under the midday heat. Francis drank of every well to ease his
  thirst, and followed the strange procession with no sense of purpose or hope.
  No one there save the chief himself, had any English, and even though they
  had spoken his own tongue, it is like that he would have had small
  disposition to talk. The man had lost all interest in his life; cold,
  sickness, and war for months had so wrought upon him that he had grown a new
  creature from the fantastic Mr. Birkenshaw of the Edinburgh taverns, even
  from the punctilious gentleman of the journey to the North. Again and again
  through the dreary day he asked himself the cause of this mournful position.
  Whence had flown his hopes; what had befallen that far-reaching scheme of
  high ambition which he had once planned to follow? Yet in the severing of
  each strand one remained firm. Had he looked to the bottom of that dogged
  instinct to share Lovat's fortunes he would have found the lingering
  sentiment which inspired his whole errand. His mission had been to Lovat, a
  lady's lips had joined their names in one command, and by Lovat's side he
  would see the end of the play.</p>

  <p>As he stumbled along, when his thoughts rose from his immediate bodily
  weakness, they rested with disgust on the sleeping figure in the litter. To
  Francis&mdash;thin, blackavised, in the main free from gross
  excess&mdash;this cumbrous load of elderly flesh was indescribably repellant.
  He could not resist a dim affection, for the old lord had that tolerant
  humour, that sudden warmth of kindliness, which is no unfailing sign of
  charity of heart. The first interview had produced on his mind an impression
  of an extraordinary intellect and an abundant knowledge of life. Somewhere in
  his heart pity lurked,&mdash;pity for the ruin of it all, the frustration of
  deep-laid plans, and the misfortunes of one already feeble with age. When he
  did not look at the litter he was prepared to serve this fallen chieftain to
  the last, but one sight of the heavy face and his nice senses revolted. Times
  had changed with one who had revelled once in the raw vulgarities of the
  Pleasaunce that now he could not abide a slovenly, unheroic old man. Nor is
  the explanation hard; for he had met this man when still in the first heat of
  sentiment, he had grouped him in his mind with the choicer figures of memory,
  and now he resented the degradation with the fierceness of one whose sacred
  places are profaned.</p>

  <p>At midday they stopped for food, and a rough feast was spread on the grass
  from the stores they carried. It was good, even rare, of its kind, for the
  indomitable gourmand had left Gortuleg with excellent provision for meat and
  drink. It seemed a strange thing to be drinking rich French wines on the
  short heather under a blazing sun, when the limbs were aching, and to
  Francis, at least, an hour's sleep would have been more than all the vintage
  in the world. Lovat's eyes brightened at the display; he fell back to his old
  humour, and was for quizzing Francis. But the poor boy turned on him so dull
  an eye that he forbore, and had recourse instead to crazy affection, which
  was harder still to bear. Once more the poles of his chair were raised, and
  the troop climbed slowly the skirts of a great, mossy hill, where the feet
  sank at every step and savage water-courses barred the road. Then they came
  to a greener country,&mdash;an upland valley between precipitous hill-walls,
  level for many yards on either side the stream, and sweet with
  hawthorn-blossom. Here stood a sheiling, a heather-roofed place of some
  pretensions, and the shepherd came running out and talked darkly with the
  chair-bearers. Lovat asked him some questions in Gaelic, and his face cleared
  at the replies. "The road is open yet," he cried to Francis. "He says that no
  one has come this way for a month save two packmen from Dingwall, and that he
  saw no sign of any man when he went round the hill this morning. We'll jink
  the lads yet, Mr. Birkenshaw, for the Fraser is on his ain rock, as the auld
  proverb says."</p>

  <p>The shepherd accompanied them to the Glenhead, while the old lord plied
  him with questions on his work, his kin, and his profits. "Is the lambing to
  be guid this year?" he asked, and the man replied in good Lowland Scots, for
  he was from the south of Perth, and had another tongue than the Gaelic. Then
  he wandered into a string of tales about the shepherd's south-country
  kinsmen, and though the thing was the purest fancy the intention was kindly
  and the result good, for the lonely man's eyes brightened and he drank in the
  stories with greedy ear. Francis walked on the other side of the chair, and
  as he watched the shepherd's placid face, the strength and ease of his great
  stride, and his open front to the world, he felt a sudden envy. The hills
  were full of the crying of sheep; it was the time of the shepherd's harvest,
  the birth-time of the flocks, when a man is on his feet from dawn to sunset,
  striving against the weather for the life of his charge. This man spent his
  quiet days here in this fragrant solitude, face to face with nature and death
  and life, an intimate of the elements, an heir of deep mountain calm. And
  here was he, a poor straw on the whirlpool of events, playing a desperate
  game with little spirit. At other times he would have consoled himself with
  the thought that after all he played for high stakes in a high region where
  success, if won, was more worthy than in a little field. But now every
  vestige of self-esteem had been driven forth; his eyes looked blankly upon
  naked facts, and he knew himself for the puppet of Fortune.</p>

  <p>The way had grown more perilous as the stream grew smaller, and soon they
  were walled between sheer sides of rock, while water brawled far down in
  scooped troughs of slate-grey stone. The road seemed to end again and again,
  but always there was some passage around some shoulder of hill, some byway
  among tanglewood which the shepherd showed them. At length they came out on
  the shore of a dark lake, which ran from the shadow of frowning hills to an
  open ridge of moor, whence the eye could discern a wide sunset country
  falling to the sea. By the loch shore was a cottage, empty save for a boat
  which lay across the floor. The men launched it and pulled to an island near
  the further shore, a place some hundred yards either way and planted with
  wind-blown firs. Here all had been made ready for a prolonged concealment.
  The low hut was scarcely distinguishable from the banks of heather, and the
  smoke of a fire was so sheltered by trees that no one from the shore could
  see a sign of habitation. Once inside, the place seemed extraordinarily large
  and well-equipped. There were barrels of meal in one end, and dried venison
  hams hung from the roof. A little old man greeted them, casting himself
  before the chief's litter and mumbling blessings. Lovat cut him short with a
  word, and surlily bade his bearers lift him to a chair. The sight of this
  final rest, which was like cold water to the wearied Francis, vexed him with
  the thought of his great stone halls now the shelter of others.</p>

  <p>Throughout the evening the place was scarce habitable for his venomous
  tongue. There are some men&mdash;great souls&mdash;whom no trouble can crush;
  there are some&mdash;little souls&mdash;who are prostrate at its advent.
  Lovat, a mixture of both, laughed at misfortunes, but his ridicule was filled
  with irritation and chiefly affected his friends. He stormed at every servant
  in impetuous Gaelic, for his voice had lost none of its strength, and had
  found with old age a harsh, penetrating note which rasped on the ears. He had
  out the French wine from the baggage, and drank it greedily without the
  common civility of passing the bottle. Francis noticed nothing, for he slept
  in snatches since ever he had come to the hut. But Lovat needed someone to
  torment in such frolicsome moods, and he preferred one nearer his own quality
  than his clansmen. So he woke him effectually from his slumbers, and poured
  into his unwilling ears much low gossip about great folk, many tales of his
  own wrongs, and much other scandal without point or foundation. Francis
  listened, patiently polite. He had volunteered to share this man's exile, and
  whatever the provocation, he swore to do it with a good grace. The filth
  wearied him, for had he not once been a connoisseur in the unbecoming, but he
  gave exact attention with a fixed smile, till Lovat returned to an easy
  humour.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A week passed in the place, and Francis would have called it
  years. He could go abroad as he pleased, but the country was the most
  desolate conceivable, a plain of broken moor flanked by abrupt treeless
  hills. It was a type of that cold land to which the greater royalists were
  already fleeing, and round which Cumberland's lines were slowly drawing. But
  as yet no redcoat came to the lake shore, and Francis was left, with
  illimitable moors abroad and a querulous old man indoors, to pass his laggard
  days. The weather was broken by cold and wet, and the few bright days that
  intervened found a soaked and blackened country and brimming rivers. Once he
  shot a deer, which caused a violent outburst on the old lord's part, inasmuch
  as the animal was out of its proper season. The fare, too, in the cottage
  dwindled to poverty. The finer viands were soon consumed by the chief's
  improvidence, and the party were reduced in three days to oatmeal brose,
  tough venison steaks, and plain water from the loch. This last was the prime
  grievance, for by an oversight little spirits had been brought, and though
  the Lovat men searched the country round, none were to be had for love or
  money. Lovat groaned deeply over his tasteless dishes, and observing that
  Francis ate with equanimity, heaped on him the most childish insults. "Does
  that mind ye o' the day when your mother fed ye, Mr. Francis?" he would say.
  "Parritch is halesome fare, an excellent diet for the lower classes in this
  land, as doubtless ye ken by experience, sir." Then, failing to irritate him
  by such clumsy means, he inevitably fell back on the subject of the Secretary
  and the Secretary's wife, and when the poor boy with burning cheeks marched
  out of doors he was pursued by the chuckle of elderly malice.</p>

  <p>Yet with it all these days had the strange effect of strengthening the tie
  between the ill-matched pair. The helplessness of the one in spite of his
  bravado appealed to the good nature of the other. The more Lovat stormed and
  fumed, the harder was Francis' life and consequently the easier was his
  conscience, for then and only then he felt the satisfaction of the man who is
  struggling to accomplish the wholly unpleasant. Every hint of comfort vexed
  his soul, for he felt bitterly that he had marred everything he had laid his
  hand to, and that while wiser and better men were in peril of their lives, it
  was a disgrace that he should be in safety. So much for his humility, but the
  novel virtue in his nature had not rid itself of his awkward pride. It was a
  torture for him to be mocked at before the servants; had they understood
  English well, it is probable that he would have finally revolted. A dozen
  times a day he found himself pulling savagely across the loch with an odious,
  leering face dancing in his memory. The old lord knew nothing of his family
  history, and but the barest scraps of his life; but by shrewd inconsequence
  he stumbled upon the truth not once but many times, and Francis had a hard
  fight of it to keep from rage. Once he was betrayed into reprisals. Lovat was
  on his unfailing topic of women,&mdash;a topic in this case not localised but
  airily, generally treated by a master mind.</p>

  <p>"What's become o' your wife a' this time, Mr. Birkenshaw?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Now this was a subject on which Francis was open to no assault, so he had
  a less strict guard on his tongue, since there was no anger at heart to
  preach carefulness.</p>

  <p>"What's become o' yours, my lord?" he said, in unthinking, rude
  repartee.</p>

  <p>In a moment he remembered the notorious scandals of the Lovat household,
  and repented his words. His companion became a volcano of emotions. Screaming
  out curses he lay back in his seat with a purple face and eyes red and
  starting. His men rushed to help him, but he waved them back and bade them
  leave him alone with this Lowland swine. Then for an hour he made Francis'
  ears tingle with abuse, ending it all with a sudden flight to the pathetic.
  Sobbing like a child, he deplored the ingratitude of youth. "Me that micht be
  your father, Francie, an auld man that surely deserves the consideration due
  to a loving parent. But ye're of a piece with the rest. Auld Simon is the
  butt of one and all, and every midden-cock craws ower the Fraser's downfa'."
  Then came a near approach to apoplexy, and Francis loosed his cravat amid
  maudlin upbraidings.</p>

  <p>Two days later Francis went out to the hill to shoot hares. It was the
  breeding season, but necessity compelled, since the table must be
  replenished. He stayed out till the late afternoon, and as he came down to
  the loch he saw to his amazement the boat leave the island with several men
  on board. Horses were waiting for them at the shore, and they rode off to the
  deeps of the moor. Twenty minutes later he arrived breathless at the edge and
  pulled himself over. A dozen vague notions ran in his head: was this some
  treachery, an attack upon their solitude, or was it a lonely conclave of the
  army's remnants? When the keel touched the reeds he leaped on shore and ran
  hard for the hut.</p>

  <p>In a corner of the place the servants were talking eagerly in whispers.
  Lovat was as usual huddled by the fire, but something in his look struck
  Francis as strange. His forehead was puckered into large knots, and the veins
  on his face and neck stood out with extraordinary prominence. He spoke to
  himself, and his lips were twitching with what might be anger or delight.
  Francis laid his hand on his shoulder ere ever he looked round, and the great
  face turned slowly from its meditations. "Sit down, Mr. Birkenshaw," he said,
  and he spoke with a precise accent very different from the freedom of his
  usual talk, "sit ye down, for I have much to say to ye.</p>

  <p>"I have had a visit from some of our north-country gentlemen," he said,
  "who are sojourning just now in these parts."</p>

  <p>Francis nodded in silence.</p>

  <p>"I need give no names, but Lochiel and Clanranald were of the number, and
  there were others who are no less well-kenned."</p>

  <p>He took snuff gravely, and, for the first time, tendered his box. It
  marked the admission of the younger man to a great intimacy.</p>

  <p>"We talked of the late unhappy events, and we had some words of a plan. I
  need have no secrets from you, Mr. Birkenshaw, for I can trust you. I
  proposed to defend these mountains with a body of men till we were granted
  fair terms of war. They jumped at the thought one and all, but when I looked
  at them I saw their unfitness. Brave, honest gentlemen, sir, but with no
  brains&mdash;no sae muckle as a spoonfu'&mdash;in one o' their skulls. So I
  told them I despaired of it, and they rounded on me and called me a
  turncoat." All this he said with a certain mournful amusement, as of one
  above all base suspicion.</p>

  <p>"A wheen men o' strae, sir, I tell ye," he went on. "Had I been a younger
  man I might have thought fit to move them to my purpose and guide their
  efforts; but I am auld, and I can but sit and look helpless on. They
  upbraided me, as if I were safe and they the ones in peril. My God, sir, it's
  hell to me to bide here, to see my whole castle of ambition in the stour, and
  to thole these moorland vapours. And I foresee worse to come. When the
  redcoats warm to their work and the hunt gets hotter, it'll no be a decent
  cot-house for Simon Fraser, but wet bogs and heathery hillsides. But I make
  no complaint. It is the common heritage of unfortunate Loyalists. What I have
  to say concerns ye more closely. The Secretary Murray was one of those who
  came here to-day."</p>

  <p>"Murray," cried Francis; "then he is recovered?"</p>

  <p>"Recovered! Oh, in a fashion. The body still looks dwining, but that was
  aye a common thing with Master John when his plans went ill. He is in a
  lamenting, Lord-forgie-me kind o' mood, and no the brisk crouse lad ye'll
  probably have mind of. But there's one thing that may interest you. He spoke
  sagaciously to me of the folly of the hale business, and to try him I
  affected surprise, declared I was wholly innocent, that the Government had no
  grip on me, that I would welcome the sight of a redcoat, and that I was out
  here on the muirs for my health. He got as thrawn as Satan. 'Ye're muckle
  mistaken, Simon,' says he. 'The law has terrible long fingers, and can lay
  its hand even on you.' It was easy seen what he meant, and ye ken now the way
  the wind blaws."</p>

  <p>"But the man may not be taken. There's every chance that he may win to
  France, where he'll be free from any temptation to hurt you. The man's young,
  and as likely to escape as any."</p>

  <p>"So, so," said Lovat, drily. "That is true enough if Mr. Murray o'
  Broughton were willing to let Providence take His ain way with him. But what
  think ye o' our gentleman going to meet the pursuit and give himself up to
  justice?"</p>

  <p>"And turn a traitor?" said Francis, in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Ay, just that," said the old lord, "and become one o' the fingers on the
  hand o' the Law that he's aye craikin' about. For our gentleman's game will
  be like this. Barisdale, Clanranald, and the others gang north and west. Mr.
  Murray gangs south under pretence of finding shelter in the Appin country.
  But at the first chance he is south of the Forth, in his ain house of
  Brochtoun, where the Government finds him, a melancholy man, lamenting his
  pitiful follies. What can they do wi' such a penitent but take him into
  favour, and in the course of private conversation it comes out that he had a
  bit scrawl that incriminates a great Highland lord whom they have long been
  seeking. So Mr. Murray gets a free pardon, and this Highland lord, if they
  lay hands on him, will even get his heid chappit off;" and he laughed
  wildly.</p>

  <p>Francis' face was hot with dismay. "Forgive me, my lord," he cried, "if I
  have been the cause of your peril."</p>

  <p>"Nay, Francis, I dinna blame ye. Indeed it is me that has to ask your
  pardon, for I have been an ill companion on these traivels. But now I can at
  least die with a clean hand and a proud heart. It shall never be said that a
  Fraser, though feeble and stricken in years, was feared o' the hale black
  gang o' them. <i>In utrumque paratus</i>," he quoted with inimitable gusto,
  "<i>seu versare dolis, seu cert&aelig; occumbere morti</i>."</p>

  <p>Francis went to bed, but not to sleep. The image of the savage, heroic old
  man, his hypocrisy discarded, fronting death with equanimity, was burned on
  his mind. A fierce anger against Murray possessed him, and as he thought of
  what one proud woman would think of such conduct, and all the misery which
  awaited her, he groaned in bitterness of spirit. But his wits were clearer,
  now he had a plainer duty before him, something which an active man might
  effect without presumption. Above all, now was his task more closely
  connected with her who had been his task-mistress. Henceforth he wrought for
  her direct, palpable good.</p>

  <p>In the grey misty morning Lovat was wakened by the young man standing at
  his bedside.</p>

  <p>"I have come to make my farewells, my lord, for it is time for me to be
  off."</p>

  <p>"Are you like the rest then, Francis, and leave the sinking ship?"</p>

  <p>"You know well enough to the contrary, my lord. I go to seek the
  Secretary."</p>

  <p>"Good lad," said Lovat, "but how will you find him? I ken nothing of his
  road save that he went south by Appin."</p>

  <p>"Then I will go to Appin, and maybe I will get word of him there."</p>

  <p>"And then, when ye get him?..."</p>

  <p>"Why, then," said Francis, "Mr. Murray and I will have words, and a
  certain bit of paper will find its way to my pocket, or I will ken the reason
  why."</p>

  <p>"It's a great plan, Francis," cried the old man, "and God speed your hand.
  Shake the tod weel, once for me and once for yoursel' and once for his leddy
  wife. If I never see ye again in this world, I'll see ye in ..."</p>

  <p>But the place was empty, and Francis was gone.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br>
  How Mr. Francis Came to the Lowlands Once More.</h2>

  <p class="first">At this point the industrious narrator passes from a sober
  tale into the realms of wild romance. Nor can he help himself. For take a
  wild young lad, or rather a serious man still in his youth, whose mind has
  been strung high by vain enthusiasms, who is spurred by a desperate hope.
  Conceive such an one to have climbed with difficulty the first steps of the
  ladder of virtue, to have curbed his mad fervours, to have bowed before the
  eternal commonplaces of love and duty, to have found himself in a difficult
  and unmanly place, and now at last to have a faint chance of great deeds.
  Suppose him strong in body&mdash;for the week in Lovat's hut had restored
  him&mdash;give him a plain task, a sword at his side, not a word of Gaelic,
  the mistiest notion of the hill-country, and burning cause for
  speed&mdash;and you will find that he will run into many stone walls ere he
  pass the Highland line.</p>

  <p>With Lovat's directions he came to the Linnhe coast and met no mishap. The
  way had been a terrible toil over a birk-clad moorland and bare scarps of
  slaty hill. Finding some poor fishermen on the beach, he slept the night in
  their hut, giving them a piece of Lovat's money in payment for the oatcake
  and dried fish which they put before him. The men were honest and considered
  the payment ample, for they took him aboard the lugger and set down the loch
  to one of the long water-arms which run into the east. He repeated the name
  <i>Appin</i>, at which they nodded to the beach; and when he found himself
  ashore he comprehended their gestures, recalled the old lord's directions,
  and realised that this was indeed Appin. That night he slept on the moor in a
  ditch among heather, and at daybreak was on his way in a pleasing land of
  green valleys, where the smell of salt hung over bent and tussock. By the
  afternoon he had come to the house which he had been bidden to seek, the
  house of John Roy Stewart, called sometimes John Howglass and sometimes John
  of the Hairy Legs. The man was kin to the Fraser, and&mdash;what was far
  above pedigree&mdash;had some little English. When Francis had eaten his fill
  and slept heavily for some hours, he put the question to his host.</p>

  <p>"Murray?" cried the man, "Murray never came here, though he sent a man to
  beg from me while he was hiding by the Leven Loch. That was a week syne.
  Murray darena show his face in Appin, for ten years back he had a kind o'
  bicker wi' Ardshiel, and it's kenned that the Drummonds canna thole him.
  Faith, it would be a back-cast of the Lord's hand that sent Murray to Appin,
  and Sim maun be failing in mind or he would have had the sense to ken
  that."</p>

  <p>"It was Murray's own word," said Francis.</p>

  <p>"And Sim believed him! Dinna tell me that! Na, na, your gentleman will be
  skelping lang ere this ower Balwhidder braes, and he'll soon be casting his
  coat in his ain house of Brochtoun. That's to say, if ye read him richt, but
  I confess I had a juster opinion of the man."</p>

  <p>"If he's gone south, then south I must go," said Francis.</p>

  <p>His host propounded to him a choice of roads: He might go south by the
  Campbells' country, take a chance of a ferry over the lochs, and come to the
  right shore of the Clyde above Dumbarton. Thence lay a level ride to
  Broughton in a quiet land among Whiggish countrymen. Or he might go straight
  through the wilds of Awe to the young streams of Forth and enter the Lowlands
  by Lennox or Lanark. Francis chose the first, and so all the next day he
  strode through the green country of Appin in a land channelled with bright
  streams and ever filled with the noise and scents of the sea. Few of the
  people had been out; but it was a miracle that he passed unchallenged, for
  the place was watched jealously by its neighbours of Lorn, seeing that of old
  Campbell had been at war with Stewart. At night he came to a herd's dwelling
  on a lonely hill, where his path turned inland. The man gladly kept him the
  night on the mention of John Howglass, but again it was a monotonous feast of
  silence, where he sat and smiled into the eyes of a friendly tangled
  giant.</p>

  <p>The weather still kept calm and blue as he struck the next morning into
  the remoter deserts. Twenty miles straight by the south-east wind, John Roy
  had said, and he would come to the sea. But Francis had little hillcraft, and
  it may be that the twenty became forty ere he looked down on a dark sea-loch,
  sleeping between strait mountain walls. All day he had met not a soul, save
  that an hour before midday he had seen two figures on the skyline of a hill
  at the head of the glen in which he patiently stumbled. They, too, seemed to
  have caught sight of him, for instantly the place became void. This was the
  one warning he got that he was in a country of war; but he was puffed up by
  the ease with which he had won thus far, and forgot the thing the minute
  after.</p>

  <p>Ere he came to the shore he learned the moral of the figures on the
  hill-top. As he slipped heavily from rock to rock down one of the shallow
  corries which dropped on the sea, a bullet suddenly sang by his ear and bored
  into a bank of sand. He had the sense to lie prone in the stream and pray
  that the shot might have been intended for other game than himself. But the
  noise of feet on the stones spoiled his hopes; he was too footsore to run; so
  he surrendered helplessly to three ragged men who leaped on him from above.
  One who had some words of English asked, "What ta devils he was crossing ta
  Cruart Vhan so hot-foot;" but Francis' reply sounded deeps of language
  unknown to him, and all that was left was to hurry the unhappy captive along
  the hill-face, till his arms seemed torn from their sockets with rough
  handling.</p>

  <p>How long and how far he went he soon lost the power to guess. His shoes
  were filled with small sharp stones which galled him severely. He struggled
  to prevail upon his guides to slacken pace, but their only reply was deep,
  convulsive laughter. At last their path was barred by a deep glen down which
  a salmon stream roared to the Firth. At its foot was a rude fisherman's
  hut,&mdash;a few stakes and boulders with a simple roof of turf,&mdash;which
  seemed to be the goal of the violent journey. At the door stood a very great
  personage, dressed in plain Lowland garb, save for a magnificent scarlet hat
  which surmounted a very well-kept periwig. The three men greeted him with the
  most abject reverence, and pushing Francis forward left him to explain the
  posture of affairs.</p>

  <p>"And who may you be, sir?" said the great man, tapping a snuff-box and
  looking with disfavour at the three dirty Highlanders.</p>

  <p>"I have yet to know by whose orders I am held prisoner," said Francis,
  "and who it is that has the right to ask me."</p>

  <p>"Hoity, toity," said the man, "heard ye ever the like? Are ye aware, sir,
  that this is the Campbell country, and that I am the Duke's own cousin? Do ye
  ken, sir, that the Campbells, serving as they do the lawful king, have a
  warrant to search these hills for any members of the disaffected clans or
  Lowland rebels who may be lurking there? And ye question my right!"</p>

  <p>"I ask your pardon, my lord," said Francis, with diplomacy. "I am glad
  indeed to find allies in a good work. I am at present in pursuit of a
  notorious Jacobite, one John Murray of Broughton, who is known to have come
  from Appin southward through this very country; and if you can enable me to
  lay hands on him I will be everlastingly your lordship's debtor."</p>

  <p>The man was vastly flattered by the tone&mdash;still more by the tide.</p>

  <p>"Then it is my part to ask your pardon for the unseemly conduct of my poor
  people, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Birkenshaw," said Francis, speaking the truth at random.</p>

  <p>"And if it turns out to be as you say, and I doubt not it will, I will aid
  you with all my heart. Meantime I must beg your company to sup on such poor
  fare as is here provided. My uncle of Inverforth will be here in three hours'
  time, and he will explain matters to you more fully."</p>

  <p>"Three hours' grace," thought Francis, for before Inverforth he must stand
  unmasked, seeing that he had no tale to meet the ear of one who had been at
  Culloden and was famed as the bitterest foe of the Prince's in the land.
  Before three hours' time he must give this gaudy gentleman the slip, and with
  the help of Providence put the loch between himself and his pursuers. He had
  noticed a boat on the beach; if he could but reach it, he was safe. Once over
  the water and he was not far from the confines of settled country, if he
  minded John Roy's words aright.</p>

  <p>They supped daintily on fresh-caught salmon, hill mutton, and some bottles
  of foreign wine which the man fetched from a store in the hut. The Campbell
  talked volubly on a score of subjects, as if glad to find one less barbarous
  than the hill-men to listen to his elegant talk. Francis humoured him as far
  as he was able, and bandied the names of great folk to his own admiration.
  Three several scandals linked with the name of Lord Craigforth did he invent
  on the spur of the moment, and tell to the greedy ears of his companion. He
  had to listen in turn to many weary recitals of slights and successes, of
  days in Edinburgh and London where it seemed that Mr. Campbell had played a
  great part, and a minute account of the interminable Campbell pedigree.
  Meantime he feigned exceeding interest and a growing fuddledom. His cheeks
  flushed and he rubbed his eyes, blinking. Then he complained of the heat, and
  the effect of wine on one who had been so long without it, paying a
  compliment to the strong head of the other. He wound up with a request for a
  second's walk in the open. "I am somewhat confused with my long journey and
  the strength of the Bordeaux. Three turns on the heather will set me right,
  so I beg of you to excuse me."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campbell, himself approaching hilarity, was graciously pleased, and in
  a second Francis was on the moor and out of sight of the gillies. The loch
  lay purple-black, for the night was moonless, but a line of pale light marked
  where the stream entered and the boat lay moored. A minute, and he was there,
  feeling for the chain and the stone to which it was fastened. To his chagrin
  the thing was padlocked, and passed through a stout ring of iron in the
  boat's stern. He searched for a weak spot but found none, nor could he move
  the great stone which did duty for an anchor. Despair seized him, and he tore
  at the thing like a madman. The ring creaked, then as the tugging grew
  fiercer the stern planks shivered, till at last the wood gave and he found
  himself sprawling with the chain in his hand and a ragged end of timber
  encircling the ring. The noise was loud enough to be heard across the loch,
  so in a fright he scrambled into the boat and put out the oars.</p>

  <p>He could hear men come crying from the hut as he shot into the blackness.
  If this were the only boat, he was safe enough; but he dare not risk the
  nearest point of the far shore, but drew down the water as he guessed its
  direction. The mountains rose wall-like in inscrutable night, towering into
  the blacker arch of the high heavens. He scarce could see the tips of his
  oars, scarcely the murky water beneath; he felt like one entering into a
  fantastic land without law or limit; and yet he was no more weary, but
  extraordinarily light and active. Then he heard in his wake the clear splash
  of oars; the gillies must have found another boat and be giving chase. He was
  hailed in strident Gaelic by some angry man, and then the world was quiet
  save for the monotonous sound of rowing. Francis grew perfectly cheerful.
  Often on the Fife coast had he played at this game&mdash;on an angry firth
  and not on a placid, land-locked sea. He could tell that the boat behind was
  not gaining, for though there seemed to be two men at the oars, it must be
  heavier and coble-shaped, whereas his was an elegant pleasure-boat.</p>

  <p>But as the minutes passed and the chase continued he began to cast about
  for a refuge. If he turned into the shore, they would follow; and now, as his
  arms grew sore, he could not hope to put such a distance between them and
  himself as would suffer him to land unnoticed. His wits failed him, and he
  could think of nothing. Wild schemes of upsetting his boat and swimming
  ashore flitted across his mind, but a remembrance of the width of the loch as
  seen by daylight warned him to prudence. Even in darkness his pursuers could
  track him easily by the sound, so he could not hope to baffle them by any
  ruse of turning. Suddenly, to his delight, a chance arose for his salvation.
  The outline of a ship all blurred with night leaped up on his left,
  apparently not more than twenty yards away. Here was a case for neck or
  nothing. With a moment's thought he kicked off his shoes, tossed the oars
  into the water, and dived overboard, and a minute later was clambering up the
  bowsprit of the vessel.</p>

  <p>He ran down from the bows to the deck-house, picking his way amid a
  multitude of ropes and bales. The door was shut, but a light came through the
  foot, so without parleying he opened. A man sat alone at a table, working out
  some figures and sweating with the toil.</p>

  <p>"Francis Birkenshaw!" he cried in amazement, as he saw his visitor.</p>

  <p>Francis stared; then "Andra Gordiestoun" he stammered, in open-mouthed
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"So ye've taken to this trade," said the captain, sourly. "I suppose ye
  will be for him they ca' the Chevalier."</p>

  <p>"Indeed I am," said Francis.</p>

  <p>"I micht have jaloused it. Ye were a blagyird in the auld toun o' Dysart,
  and it's no like ye'd be convertit on the Hieland hills."</p>

  <p>"There's a boatful o' men behind me," said Francis. "Are you minded to
  give me up?"</p>

  <p>"To be sure I am," said the man. "I am a decent supporter o' the
  King&mdash;God bless him,&mdash;and I'll hae nae rinaway Jaicobites on my
  vessel."</p>

  <p>At the moment there came a great crying from the bows, as the pursuers
  came up with the deserted boat and the moored ship. The men hailed the
  captain in their scanty English, and Francis sat down despairingly to await
  the issue. The conversation&mdash;heard in snatches&mdash;was of a kind to
  cheer and surprise him. For the captain argued, first, that no man had come
  aboard; secondly, that if one had, it was no business of theirs; and,
  thirdly, that they might be damned for a set of dirty Highland beggars, and,
  if they stayed longer, he would rouse his men and send them and their boat to
  a better place. Which last point&mdash;and the gestures and tone which
  accompanied its deliverance&mdash;was found so convincing that the party
  retired in haste.</p>

  <p>"You're better than your word, Andra," said Francis, on his return.</p>

  <p>"Say nae mair about it," said he. "And look ye here, Mr. Birkenshaw, ye
  may be a michty scoondrel, as I have nae doot ye are, ye may be fresh frae
  cuttin' the throat o' Maccallummore himsel'; but ye come frae my ain toun,
  and I have drunk mony glesses wi' ye at the Harbour-walk, so I'll see ye
  through wi' this bit business, if it does na interfere wi' mine."</p>

  <p>"If you can put me in by the Renfrew shore you will do me a great
  obligement."</p>

  <p>"And it so happens that that is my very road," said the captain, "so the
  Lord has lookit after ye better than ye could guide yoursel'."</p>

  <p>As Francis lay down in a ship's berth he could hear the anchor lifting,
  and soon they were dropping down the loch with a fair breeze behind. When he
  awoke late in the morning, they had already left the loch and were making
  their course by the south end of an island in what seemed a broad sea, lined
  on one side with craggy hills and on the other by far-stretching lines of
  level country. For the whole of a long day they made slow progress up the
  Firth, tacking against a difficult wind, while Francis looked idly from the
  bows, busy with his own reflections. The skipper was always by his side,
  leaving him only to make short inroads below or to yell orders to his men. To
  his amazement Francis found that he was no more the godless Andra Gordiestoun
  of the old days, but an enthusiast in religion on the watch for a proselyte.
  True, his language was violent as ever, and he seemed little less drunken;
  but his talk was always of theological mysteries, and unctuous texts fell
  easily from his lips. He preached Francis a vehement sermon on the error of
  his ways, adjured him to flee from a wrath to come, painted this wrath in
  awful colours, and dwelt zealously on the joys of the redeemed. Francis heard
  him out with impatient grace. He himself had been the arena of so severe a
  struggle, good and evil had fought such a duel in his breast, that he was
  willing to lend an ear to anyone who could teach him the way of life. But
  these phrases, this fluent rhetoric, seemed paltry to one whose soul was
  scarred with the grim reality. He was in the actual throes of a vain
  endeavour; little to him these commonplaces of the throng. And yet this man,
  sent with such words out of his own tattered past, was a sting and a
  remembrance of years mis-spent.</p>

  <p>"I will pray for ye, Francie," said the man, on parting, "that ye may yet
  be reclaimed. It's a puir warld withoot hopes o' a better."</p>

  <p>"I say 'Amen' to that," said Francis, and he stepped ashore on Lowland
  earth.</p>

  The House of Broughton.</h2>

  <p class="first">By the afternoon of the next day Francis had put many broad
  Lanark and Renfrew cornfields between himself and the sea, and had come to
  the upmost streams of Clyde, where the land begins to fall away towards
  pleasant Tweeddale. He had bought a horse with some of his Highland gold,
  since his business demanded speed, and ridden through the quiet Whig clachans
  with none to gainsay him. Only at the change-house of Roberton did he stop to
  wet his dry lips with ale. The landlord was an honest, sunburnt countryman,
  so Francis ventured a question.</p>

  <p>"What like is Tweeddale now when the steer is over? Are there still
  Murrays to vex it?"</p>

  <p>The man looked suspicion for a second and quietly stroked his right cheek.
  By luck Francis knew the current Jacobite sign and responded.</p>

  <p>"I ken but ae thing o' the state o' affairs in Brochtoun," said the man,
  "The Leddy was bidin' there hersel', but yestreen yin came bye on a blae
  horse and syne yin on a broun, and I think the last was awfu' like the shape
  o' the Laird. Hae ye ony word yoursel'?"</p>

  <p>"None save that soon there's like to be a flittin' from Brochtoun
  House."</p>

  <p>"Across the water belike?" said the man.</p>

  <p>"Maybe scarcely so far," said Francis.</p>

  <p>"But he'll ne'er be ta'en. Brochtoun's a dour bit, but the lave o'
  Tweeddale is leal and no Whiggish ava'."</p>

  <p>"I have nought to tell you," said Francis, "but if you do not hear within
  a week that Mr. John Murray went up the Edinboro' road wi' a company o'
  dragoons to keep him cheery, then thank God for saving a poor gentleman from
  himself." And he rode on, leaving the man a prey of vague suspicions.</p>

  <p>The flush of early summer was on hill and wildwood as he rode from the
  green moor-road into the shadowy vale. To one sick of rock and heather and
  the sour unkindly odours of moss and torrent, the place seemed goodly beyond
  dreams. It was mid-afternoon, and in the mellow glow all was softened,
  touched with enchantment and old romance. The glen was asleep; scarcely a
  murmur of water reached his ears; the white stone cottages by the
  meadow-edge, the grey walls of the Place among the trees, the faint lines of
  far-away mountains,&mdash;all were part of an ancient primordial peace o' the
  world. And the air of the place bewitched him till he lost all settled
  thoughts. Before he had been puzzling sore over the knots in his destiny and
  striving to form a clear plan of conduct. Now he was in a fairyland of
  sentiment, where a woman's face shone ever from the still and golden
  skies.</p>

  <p>He came on the Edinburgh highway above the bridge of the burn, some
  hundreds of yards from the road to the Place. His heart began to beat
  painfully at the thought of the near meeting. The whirligig of time had been
  playing pranks since that morning a year before when he had ridden down
  Edinburgh streets to the North. And what had been the end of his mission?
  Dust and ashes! He had no news but the worst, news of treachery, of suffering
  and black fortune. Was she likely to find pleasure in his presence for all
  his high-flown dreams of service? And at the thought Francis brought his
  horse to a walk and braced himself for the inevitable.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, at a turn of the bridge, he came full before the eyes of a party
  of three who were riding leisurely up towards the great avenue. They turned
  round at the sound of steps, and his heart stood still, while he felt the
  blood palpitate about his forehead. For the meeting he longed for and dreaded
  had come. The lady rode between two tall, harsh-looking gentlemen, one a
  grey-headed man with a soldier's bearing, the other younger, but with the
  same grim, narrow features. A far-away resemblance in the eyes made him
  hastily set them down as distant kinsmen.</p>

  <p>At the sight of him the lady's eye grew wide with wonder, and she
  involuntarily drew rein. Then she nodded to her companions.</p>

  <p>"Wait for me, Henry," she said, "I have a moment's business with this
  gentleman," and she turned and cantered to the bridge-end.</p>

  <p>"You have returned, Mr. Birkenshaw," said she. "Have you any news for
  me?"</p>

  <p>For a little Francis could only look. Her face was so pale and thin, her
  eyes so impenetrably sad, that he was lost in pity. Then, "I took your
  message to the Lord Lovat," he said lamely, "but was prevented from returning
  by a sore sickness. I saw the Prince on the eve of Culloden, and was by his
  side in the battle. I followed him to Gortuleg, and there, finding the Lord
  Lovat, I conceived it to be my duty to attach myself to his cause. Now I am
  come from him on a matter which closely concerns yourself."</p>

  <p>"You have done well," she said. "I heard that you had reached Lovat from
  other sources, and when no further news came of you, I had thought you were
  dead. I am glad to see you safe. But I cannot wait longer lest I make my
  friends impatient. You have done my errand loyally, and I thank you from my
  heart. I would offer you the hospitality of my house were it not old and
  half-dismantled; but the village-inn will receive you for the night. I will
  lay no more toilsome missions on you. Farewell, Mr. Birkenshaw." And ere he
  could say a word she had ridden up to the others.</p>

  <p>Francis' heart sank to the ground. This was the dismissal, the end of his
  long service. For this he had endured sickness and weariness, cold mosses and
  the cruel hills. She had used him only as a servant, when he had thought he
  was a friend. His humiliation was bitter, his disappointment so utter as to
  benumb his mind. In a state of dreary bemazement he turned his horse's head
  to the village.</p>

  <p>But he had told her of private news, and she had not waited to listen.
  What woman, least of all what woman of her eager temper, could have acted
  thus? And then her talk of the inn&mdash;and with this, light broke in upon
  his brain. She had feared suspicion on the part of the two sour-looking
  cavaliers. She had to all intents bidden him go to the inn and await her
  further commands. Clearly she would find ways and means to visit him. The
  thought was so wholly comforting that he fell into a state of unreasoning
  joy. She seemed solitary and friendless; then he, and he alone, would right
  her wrongs. This pale-cheeked lady was not the glorious beauty he had left,
  but she was something finer, subtler, more enchanting, pure gold refined in
  the furnace of sorrow.</p>

  <p>The landlord of the inn was changed, the stout old Whig being dead, and a
  zealous Murray's man reigning in his stead. He eyed Francis with undisguised
  annoyance, clearly suspecting the designs of a stranger so near a noted
  harbour of the outlawed. Nor did Francis improve matters by his cunning
  questions to find out the man's leanings. The host adopted a robustious Whig
  tone, and professed a violent love for Hanover and all its appurtenances.
  This compelled the other to a like avowal of loyalty, and soon the two stood
  in a posture of mutual suspicion. Then the main purpose of his errand began
  to stir in Francis's heart, and he asked cautiously about the Laird's
  whereabouts, if haply he were yet lurking in the place. The man affected
  secrecy and drew him aside.</p>

  <p>"Ye ken the tap house in the clachan," he said. "Weel, that's John
  Bertram's, and at its backside is a bit gairrden. There abune the tattie beds
  is a kind o' hole in the solid rock, whaur Murray has been hiding thae twae
  days."</p>

  <p>The news fired Francis to action. Could he but get speech of Murray all
  might yet be well, false faith might be prevented, and the honour of a great
  family saved. He learned his directions from the man, and made his way up the
  fields to the garden back. With some pains he pierced the thick thorn hedge
  and found himself in a lone strip of ground, half planted with greens and
  half the bare rock of the hill. By dint of much searching he found a hole of
  some dimensions, and bearing marks of recent use. But now it was empty,
  utterly. When he came out he saw through the dusk a face at an open window in
  the cottage watching him closely. He ran down to the garden foot, but ere he
  reached it the window was shut and closely barred; and though he knocked hard
  at the back door he could get no admittance.</p>

  <p>In some irritation he made his way back to the inn, where he found the
  landlord waiting with a clouded face.</p>

  <p>"Why the Devil did you send me on such a goose-chase, sir?" Francis asked
  fiercely. "Where is Murray?"</p>

  <p>"Let that be," said the man, sullenly. "Look ye here, sir. This is a
  letter sent to you this moment from a certain lady. Now, before ye get a
  sicht o' 't, ye will tell me plainly your way of thinking, for I will see ye
  damned afore I will have this lady come to any hurt."</p>

  <p>The man stood so fully revealed by his words that Francis felt the need of
  caution no longer. "Why, man," he cried, "I am honest to the backbone. I have
  just come from the North with news for my Lady. I was by the Prince's side at
  Culloden, and am not a week from my Lord Lovat's company."</p>

  <p>The landlord looked relieved, and gave him the note without further
  scruple. It proved to be a mere line to arrange an hour of meeting. Nine of
  the evening was the time she fixed, when with her servant she would seek Mr.
  Birkenshaw's presence. Francis read it and dropped it into the fire.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you will tell me now where the Laird lies," said he.</p>

  <p>"Till this morning he was in that hole I telled ye o', and I kenna why he
  left it. He micht hae lain there canty for months. This countryside was
  ill-inclined to him, but there's no a man wad cheep a word o' where he was
  hidin'. But this morning he gaed off to Powmood to his guid-brither's, and I
  sair misdoot if he'll find it as quiet a biggin'. The mail gaed bye the day
  wi' twae-three lads that hadna the look o' Moffat dealers. I wis I kent if
  they gaed bye Powmood."</p>

  <p>Francis groaned in spirit. This was the confirmation of his worst fears.
  Even now the man might be in the Government's hands with all his weight of
  secret knowledge. His first thought was to fly to Polmood and strive by main
  force to arrest calamity. But the thought of his own frailty deterred him,
  and, moreover, it was near the hour appointed for the meeting with Mrs.
  Murray. Even as he waited the clock struck the half-hour; so he went upstairs
  to spend the thirty minutes in snatching supper.</p>

  <p>He had finished his meal and sat watching the firelight strive with the
  last fading glow of day on the wainscotted walls. He felt very melancholy,
  what with the ruin of a great cause and the futility of his little plans. Of
  what worth was he after all save to follow a greater's lead? He had not it in
  him to originate or to command. Something of his boyish sickness for cutting
  a fine figure in life came back to him at the moment, and added a pang to his
  regrets. And bitterer than all was the thought of his mistress's sorrows, of
  the long loneliness and shame which lay like a pall athwart her future.</p>

  <p>Then when he had lost all cognisance of the present and was deep in dismal
  fancies, the door opened and two women entered. One was a maid, a little,
  rosy-faced countrywoman, and the other was the lady of his dreams. She
  advanced to greet him with both hands held out after her impulsive fashion,
  and before he knew he had taken them and led her to a seat. She wore a heavy
  dark cloak, and when at length she laid it aside, there were no bright robes
  beneath, only a sombre gown which made her white face paler. Her manner, too,
  had changed utterly. Of old she had looked at him with the calm, sovereign
  air of a mistress, now there was hesitation, diffidence, the tremulousness of
  grief.</p>

  <p>"You understood me, Mr. Birkenshaw. I was vexed to turn from you so
  hastily, but my cousins of Romanno are ever suspicious. And now I can thank
  you for doing my work so well. In this lamentable confusion, when the best
  blood has been spilled like water, it is a pleasure to see a kenned face. And
  you will have heard, sir, I am desolate now, and have no one to look to save
  such honest gentlemen as serve me out of good will," and she smiled a little
  ghost of a smile.</p>

  <p>Francis' blood was painfully stirred. He could not bear to see her sitting
  there so changed from her high estate. A great tumult of compassion arose in
  his soul.</p>

  <p>"And now for your news," she said, "for I believe you have something to
  tell me in private. My maid is a sharer of all my secrets."</p>

  <p>Here was a quandary for the unhappy man. How could he tell this pale
  heroic woman of her husband's perfidy? It seemed cruel beyond thought, and
  his heart failed him.</p>

  <p>"It had to do with your husband," he stammered; "but if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He got no further, for at the word "husband" he saw she knew all. She
  covered her face with her hands and her bosom heaved with her sobbing. "Oh,
  it is true," she cried. "I am near crazy. I have fought&mdash;Oh my
  God!&mdash;I have fought to prevent it, but I could not. I knew his heart,
  but he denied it when I asked him, and put me off with smooth phrases till it
  was too late. And now he has gone to Polmood, and I am left to curse my
  woman's weakness. And he was the King's friend, the first man in Scotland to
  stand by the Prince, and the wisest head in his councils." She rocked herself
  to and fro in an impotence of agony.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she rose to her feet and had flung herself beside him with her
  hands on his arm. "Oh, save me from myself," she cried. "I shall go mad, I
  have been alone for so long and my mind is sick with care. Oh, help me, help,
  do not go away. The Saints sent you here to-day, and I have been alone so
  long, and I have no friends but you." And she ended in stormy tears.</p>

  <p>Francis was at his wit's end with sorrow and perplexity. To see his proud
  mistress humbled pierced him to the heart. He raised her and with the help of
  the maid reduced her to something like calm. All the while there was an
  undercurrent of crazy delight. Now at last she had summoned him to her aid,
  he need fear no rival in her service any more; and at the thought he felt the
  ragged ends of his life gather to a centre. Here lay his duty and task; his
  toil was but beginning.</p>

  <p>At that moment through the window came the noise of a carriage driving
  rapidly along the highway to the North. It had the sound of a great equipage,
  and Francis instinctively drew back to the shadow of the curtain. Then came
  the sound of a stopping at the inn-door. The three in the room looked at each
  other in fear; even Mrs. Murray's eyes lost their vacancy. Francis peeped
  through the curtain's edge, but all he could see was a splash of light in the
  mid-road from the carriage lamps and the open inn-door. There was the sound
  of a man alighting, then of some talking with the landlord, in which the
  remaining inmates seemed to join. Then the man re-entered, the door was
  closed, and the echo of wheels died in the village street.</p>

  <p>Francis rushed from the room with a foreboding of tragedy. He met the
  landlord at the stair-head with a face somewhat whiter than his own. There
  was no need of question; the man's look was eloquent of all.</p>

  <p>"It's twae captains frae the Castle," he faltered, "and Murray o'
  Brochtoun is sitting atween them."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br>
  A Council of Honour.</h2>

  <p class="first">When Francis came to the house on the next forenoon he found
  it silent as a mausoleum. The smokeless chimney, the wide avenue beginning to
  show traces of lack of gardening, the great mass of untrimmed blossom on wall
  and border, and the sealed, dusty windows seemed to tell of a masterless
  home. Curlews screamed over the flower-garden, and in one spot where the
  heather had encroached on a clipped lawn two melancholy peacocks strutted in
  the confusion.</p>

  <p>The solemn maid opened the door to him and took him to the self-same room
  where he had sat that night a year before and waited on the lady with the
  lamp. The same air of lost splendour which had afflicted him without,
  oppressed him within,&mdash;the deep rich wainscotting, the carved shelves of
  books, the emblazoned mantelpiece, all with a subtle atmosphere of neglect
  and disuse. The carpet still bore the mark of a man's mud-stained boot: here
  doubtless the Secretary Murray had bidden farewell to his house and his
  honour.</p>

  <p>Then Mrs. Murray came to greet him, and led him to a summer-room looking
  out upon the hill and the western valley. She was no more the distracted
  woman of yesterday, but composed and pale, with heroism at her lips and eyes
  weary of life. Francis trembled at the sight of her, for this face argued
  some quixotic resolve and he anticipated troublous days. Night had worked
  changes in his temper. He had lost his first tumultuous anger and grief; the
  fervours of his spirit had abated and left his soul cold and exceeding bleak.
  He wavered nothing from his purpose, but he would have welcomed gladly
  yesterday's high sentiment. What though it were but vain elation, it had at
  least made the world roseate for an hour. Now he was a wiser, stronger man,
  but one with teeth set and his back to the wall, fighting against
  inclination, prudence, and his own unregenerate heart.</p>

  <p>But this new mood of his lady's matched his own, and relieved him of one
  difficulty. For with all his compassion he had a horror of tears, a shrinking
  from the pathetic; and the spectacle of a weak woman looking to him alone for
  aid could in certain moods arouse only repugnance. But now all dealings
  between the two were passionless and kindly. This tall lady was again the
  mistress, and he waited to do her bidding. He asked her purposes.</p>

  <p>"There can be but one way," said she. "He will go to London, and there I
  must follow him. I cannot hope to mend matters, for I am poor and have little
  purchase, but I may see him and try. I have no hope, Mr. Birkenshaw, but it
  is better to press on in some sort of endeavour than eat out my heart here in
  despair."</p>

  <p>"But where can you bide in London?" asked Francis. It was his duty to look
  after the plain fact in the wrapping of the romantic.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," she said, "unless with my cousin Lady Manorwater, who is
  of my religion, and if all else fails will take me with her over-seas."</p>

  <p>"But how will you make the journey?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, how would I make it but alone, with my own horses and the one
  servant who is left me?" she said, with a faint attempt at vivacity.</p>

  <p>"But who is to see to your lodging on the road and guide you safe through
  an unsettled country?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"Ah, I cannot tell. I must use my mother wit&mdash;and there is all the
  need in the world for hurry;" and she twisted her hands with a sad gesture of
  impotence.</p>

  <p>"And above all, my lady, is it likely that you will convince your husband
  in a hurried sight of him, if you failed before his arrest when you had
  leisure and safety?"</p>

  <p>"I can but try," she said simply. Then, "Oh, Mr. Birkenshaw, the thing is
  less a journey of hope than of despair. I well know that I have left nothing
  undone, and that may be a solace in the dark years that remain to me."</p>

  <p>She spoke so sadly that Francis was moved, and the old sentiment began to
  rise in his heart.</p>

  <p>"I owe a duty to&mdash;a great Highland lord," he said, "which I must
  sometime fulfil. If you go to the South I go also. Our journeys have the same
  purpose and may well lie together, and perhaps I may help you in some of the
  difficulties of the road."</p>

  <p>At his words, her face shone for a moment with gratitude, then it suddenly
  paled. "I will only be a drag, and my company will be the least safe in the
  world for you. I am already deep in your debt, and I cannot accept this
  service."</p>

  <p>"But if the lord be the Lord Lovat," said Francis, "if I have sworn to him
  that I would keep the Secretary from any such step though I followed him to
  the Tower, will this not change your decision?"</p>

  <p>"But you said yourself that the errand was idle. How will you get a sight
  of him; and even if you see him how will you bring him to a better mind?"</p>

  <p>"I can but trust to chance to show me a way," said he, speaking thoughts
  which had been with him on his road from the Highland glens. "I do not value
  my life at overmuch, and for a desperate man there are many paths. But if the
  mischief is not done and he still lie unconfessed in the Tower, there is some
  hope; for a road may be found out of that place even for Mr. Murray of
  Broughton." Yet while he spoke he felt the futility of such a
  scheme&mdash;these two folk in a moorland house half a thousand miles from
  the capital, plotting a great state crime.</p>

  <p>But to the lady it seemed a way out of all perplexities. "We can do as
  Lady Nithsdaill did, as Anne Carew and Sir John Haltwhistle, and many others.
  Oh what a thing is a bold man's mind! With you to help me I have hope, and I
  thank you from my heart, for it is most noble and generous to risk your life
  in my desperate cause. I cannot thank you, but God knows I shall ever
  remember." And as cheek and brow flushed with the emotion of the feelings,
  Francis for a moment sat lord and king in a crazy palace of cloud.</p>

  <p>"We must not delay," said she, "for they will let no grass grow under
  their feet now they have got him. I have already made preparations for the
  journey, and I cannot see how two people should not travel quicker than a
  body of horse. There is my maid Anne who will follow me to the end of the
  world, and I will take a serving-man to see to the horses. You will find me
  the road, Mr. Francis?"</p>

  <p>Francis felt anew the desperation of his quest, but he had not the heart
  to throw obstacles in the way. This heroic lady might bid him steal the
  crown-jewels, were her mind to be set at ease by such a deed.</p>

  <p>"I accept the charge, my lady. God grant we meet with a happy
  fortune!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, but I will have no 'my ladies' or 'Mrs. Murrays' or 'madames,'" she
  cried. "Do you not see that the quest is ours, and we cannot enter upon it
  with a hedge of formalities between us? You have shown yourself a gallant
  gentleman, sir, and we set out on this journey as sister and brother. You
  will be Francis to me, and let me be Margaret, and then we shall be the
  better friends." She spoke simply, but a blush rose to her cheek, and she
  played with the tassel of her chair.</p>

  <p>Francis bowed, himself in turn violently out of composure. It was a wise
  rule for both; but the sudden change in his position, the dizzy companionship
  of a dream, threw him out of his bearings.</p>

  <p>He rose and went to a window which looked over a courtyard to a long
  wooded valley. There was now no bustle in the place, no moving of horses, nor
  running of serving-men. Only in a corner stood a great travelling-coach,
  which a single groom had washed and made ready, and was passing a brush over
  the panels.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Murray had come over to his side, and looked on at the picture. He
  could not forbear to glance at her as she stood by his shoulder, so tall that
  her hair was but little below his cheek; and he noticed that her eye had
  filled as she gazed.</p>

  <p>"What is the fellow doing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He is doing my commands," she said. "Can you not see his work? He is
  painting out the arms of Murray from the panel, that no roadside passer may
  know them and witness the tragedy of an old house."</p>

  <p>He looked, and sure enough the man had all but obliterated any colour from
  the level black wood.</p>

  <p>"It was a handsome coat as one might see in all the land," she said
  softly, as if speaking to herself. "First and fourth there was the old coat
  of Murray, three silver mullets on an azure chief with a black hunting-horn
  below on a silver field; second, it bore three silver fraises for the kinship
  to the house of Fraser, and third, the three gold cushions of the vanished
  house of Romanno. Did you know the motto and crest of Mr. Secretary Murray,
  Francis? There it is; Robin is almost at it, and soon it will be no more. A
  dove with an olive branch, and <i>Pacis nuntia</i> for a device! Now I wonder
  what old raider chose that foolish text to set below his arms. I had never
  heard that the Murrays carried peace to all men in their hearts,
  save&mdash;Ah, God help me!&mdash;that traitor's peace that one of the house
  is now seeking! A dove with an olive branch. Ay, it is suitable irony, and I
  praise the wit and foresight of the old cynic who first wrote it. At any rate
  it is all done with now, and I go out to the world without blazon or history.
  Heigho, I feel quit of a load, and yet I am melancholy to-day over the end of
  so long a story."</p>

  <p>Then Francis took his leave and went down to the village, where he found
  the landlord and held long consultation; for much of Mrs. Murray's own
  possessions were to be left in his charge against that seizure of the house
  which must soon follow. But the main point was the line of journey, and here
  he found a ready informant. For in the old days of the '15 this man had
  travelled far into the Midlands of England, and since then had gone many
  times to the South with droves of cattle. He drew up an itinerary as far as
  his knowledge permitted, and gave it into Francis' keeping, adding many
  prudent hints about lodging by the way and the least frequented paths. The
  honest fellow had much ado to speak clearly, for grief at the melancholy
  fortunes of his mistress choked his voice and confused his judgment "We hae
  a' our troubles in thae times," he cried, "but to see the sair end fa' on our
  puir feckless leddy is eneuch to wring tears frae a heidstane. The men are to
  bide canty at hame, but the women must up and awa' to weir their herts on a
  desperate ploy. Lord, siccan days!"</p>

  <p>When he returned to the house on some small errand it was already drawing
  toward evening. He found Margaret in the same west-looking room, fingering
  for the last time her treasures. "I must carry little," she said in answer to
  his look, "for a burdenless rider gangs easily, as the folk say, so I am
  taking a last look at certain old things for which I have a sort of
  affection. Men sit loose in those matters, but we women are cumbered about
  with a host of memories, and must always have our trinkets." She placed some
  jewels in their case, and shutting it went towards a spinet which stood by
  the window. "I used to play old tunes on it," she said, "for the amusement of
  my father when he tired of idleness in his latter days. It's a long farewell
  to my spinet as to all else, but I must play one last air before I shut it.
  Have you any favourite catch, Francis?"</p>

  <p>Francis shook his head, for in truth he had little music in his soul save
  of the large rough-and-ready order.</p>

  <p>"Then I will play you an old tune of the Cause, which loyal ladies have
  sung for many years and will doubtless sing for years to come, seeing that
  there is little hope of their dreams being fulfilled. It is called 'Lady
  Keith's Lament,' and the music was made by the King's own piper, who was a
  Macrimmon of the Macleods. It goes haltingly to a spinet, but you shall hear
  it." And she played a wild melody, singing to it some such words as
  these:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"A' are gane, the gude, the kindly,<br>
  Low in the moss and far on the sea,<br>
  Men o' the North, men o' the muirlands,<br>
  Brave to battle and laith to flee.<br>
  I was aince a lady o' pride,<br>
  High my hame abune the heather;<br>
  Now my silken gown I tine,<br>
  I maun fare in wind and weather.</p>

  <p class="poem">"Kin and kith in weary battle<br>
  By stranger waters across the faem<br>
  Fell, and dying had mind o' sweet Argos,<br>
  The man of auld and the hills of hame.<br>
  The ship is rocking by the pier,<br>
  The hour draws nigh when we maun pairt.<br>
  Then fare thee weel, my loved, my dear,<br>
  Bide I canna, though breaks my hert."</p><br>

  <p>"They are rude, simple verses," she said, "but to me they are
  extraordinarily touching. There are some other lines which tell of a brighter
  hope." And with some enthusiasm in her voice she sang:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"But though I now maun wander dowie,<br>
  And drap the tear on cheek sae pale,<br>
  Yet shall our dule be turned to joy,<br>
  For God maun let the richt prevail.<br>
  My father was a gude lord's son,<br>
  My mither was an earl's daughter;<br>
  And I'll be Lady Keith again<br>
  The day the King comes ower the water."</p><br>

  <p>As she finished, she sat for a long time motionless, looking out of the
  western windows. As for Francis, he fell into a like mood, and neither spoke
  for long. The sight of this woman, young, unfortunate, bright with a
  long-descended, subtle beauty, sitting there singing a sad old ballad on that
  last day of calm before the stormy morrow, moved him more than he could tell.
  Something in the haunting notes of her voice, the sunset light on her hair,
  or the long line of golden hill-land which gleamed from the window, seemed to
  him an epitome of all the fervours and sorrows of life. He sat musing till
  Margaret rose and shut the spinet.</p>

  <p>"It is time to have done with old songs, Francis. Henceforth it is grimmer
  work for you and me."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br>
  A Journey to the South.</h2>

  <p class="first">From Broughton to Moffat is a short day's journey even for
  an old travelling coach, but the way is rough and grass-grown up the narrow
  glen of Tweed to the high moors and the precipitous source of the Annan.
  Thence in a long day through pleasant Annandale you may come to the Bridge of
  Esk and pass on to Carlisle walls. The two days were days of sunny, windless
  weather, and the clear air of the hill-tops put an edge upon the travellers'
  spirits. Margaret seemed to forget her troubles, and after the way of woman,
  was interested in each passing face. As for Francis he had a heavier burden,
  but even he accepted the inevitable. He served the lady in a somewhat clumsy
  fashion, for he had no notion of the civilities of a fine society; but as the
  hours passed the two grew very excellent companions, while some spice of
  humour enlivened their sombre talk. For take any two clear and honest souls
  and set them in such a position; you will find them at first constrained and
  foolish, but as time goes on they will know each other for the human being
  that he or she may be, and look sanely into the future.</p>

  <p>Carlisle was in an extraordinary stir, what with things political and the
  yearly summer fair. Daily batches of prisoners came South to these walls, and
  soon many brave hearts sighed out their life from a tow on the Gallows-hill.
  Farmers from the hills were everywhere in the streets, drovers and wide-eyed
  shepherds thronged the ports; and each inn was filled with brown-faced
  bedlamites who made the night hideous with their din. In a little inn near
  the south gate, Francis found lodging; this much he had settled at Broughton,
  for the place was quiet, and the landlord no ill friend to the lost cause.
  There he left Margaret and her two servants, and went out to the streets in
  the late evening to ponder over the tangle of his affairs.</p>

  <p>Money must soon be thought of, for his funds were already running low. He
  had no knowledge of the lady's wealth, but though she had been amply rich he
  would have died sooner than let her pay a single crown. When she came to Lady
  Manorwater's house his task would be ended; meantime she was his charge, the
  journey was by his advice, and he alone would see to the lawing. It was an
  old-faced, grim-looking man who stalked through the rabble of drovers in the
  noisy, darkening street.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he brushed against a man who stared full in his eyes. It was the
  face of an elderly grizzled gentleman, clad in stout, simple country clothes,
  with a long jowl and deep eyebrows. Something in the air demanded
  recognition, and Francis involuntarily stopped. The man did likewise, and for
  a second the two blocked the causeway. Then like a flash came a happy
  intuition to Francis' brain. "May I have a word with you, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The stranger nodded and led the way across the street to a little public,
  where he climbed a stair to a room above the causeway. The place was still
  yellow with sunset, and in a mirror on the wall Francis saw his own
  reflection. He almost cried aloud, for save for the twenty or thirty years'
  difference in age his was almost a double of his companion's face. His chance
  thought was now certainty.</p>

  <p>"And now, sir, what is your business with me?" said the elder man.</p>

  <p>"Why, my business is simple," said Francis. "I have come to claim kinship,
  sir. You, I think, are my uncle Robert?"</p>

  <p>"So," said the man solemnly, "I jaloused as much the first glisk I got of
  ye. Ye will be Francie's son. Ye favour him, save that ye're sae muckle
  wiser-lookin' as ye seem less drunken. God, man, ye have the Birkenshaw
  glower maist uncannily in your een. Ye are the leevin' image o' my father.
  And what is it ye seek wi' me, nevoy Francis? Abune a', what brings ye to
  Carlisle toun in thae days o' war?"</p>

  <p>"Listen to me," said the other, "and I will tell ye a bit story." And
  briefly he told of the last year, of his wanderings and his toils, and now of
  his final charge. The man heard him out with a grim face.</p>

  <p>"Ye are like your kind, Francie, you and your trokings wi' outlawed
  Jaicobites. There was never a Birkenshaw afore took up wi' sic a bairnly
  cause."</p>

  <p>"I have heard bits o' the family history," said Francis, "but I never
  heard that it was the wont of our folk to leave a man when his back was at
  the wall or to refuse a woman aid."</p>

  <p>"Ye may put it that way if ye like," said the man, "but ye canna deny that
  it's unprofitable."</p>

  <p>"Then I leave that branch of the family's work to you, my dear uncle. I am
  content if I can keep a coat on my back. Has Markit paid well these last
  years?"</p>

  <p>"Off and on," grumbled the other. "The land's ower unsettled for peaceable
  folk to dae guid business."</p>

  <p>"Because I am about to ask the loan of a hundred guineas," said Francis,
  boldly.</p>

  <p>"A hundred guineas," cried Mr. Robert Birkenshaw. "A hundred golden
  guineas! The man's mad! Heard ye ever the like o' sic a speiring! A hundred
  guineas, quotha! Mair like a hundred pence!"</p>

  <p>"But you will give it me?" said Francis, "seeing that a journey cannot be
  decently finished without gold."</p>

  <p>"But what's the need o' the journey, man? Gang back to Dysart to Gregor
  Shillinglaw and clerk awa' among the writer lads like an honest man."</p>

  <p>"You know fine you would never have me do that," said Francis. "Is our
  auld house fallen so low as to neglect a plain duty for lack of gear?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Robert Birkenshaw presented a lamentable sight, his face red with
  emotion and twitching between love of his gold and the impulses of an honest
  heart. "What can I dae?" he cried miserably. "I'm no mean and I wad uphaud
  the family honour, but I'm dooms puir though folk ca' me rich." Then with a
  splutter he took out a bag of gold from a flap-pocket and flung it on the
  table. "Damn ye, Francie, tak' it," he cried. "Tak' it and use it weel. I've
  nae bairns, and whae's to lend to the family if it's no mysel'? Ye say ye are
  serving a leddy. Sit ye doon, and we'll drink to her if she's bonny. What's
  her name?"</p>

  <p>At the mention of it the old pagan cried aloud in glee: "I aince saw her,
  and she was as bonny as Queen Mary. Francie, lad, it's a guid errand ye're
  on, and I'll risk anither hundred if ye need it." And so the lady's health
  was drunk and Francis sat on at the wine till late, hearing old fragments of
  family tales. So when at last he sought the inn, it was with some affection
  for his fellows and a more kindly outlook on life.</p>

  <p>It would be hard to follow that hurried journey after the style of an
  itinerary, for it was monotonous and without interest save the casual
  variation of weather. Among the Westmoreland hills the drought broke in a
  chain of storms which set every hill-water roaring and made the fords hard
  for a carriage to pass. It was weary work both for Francis without on his
  horse, opposed to the buffeting of rain, and for Margaret and her maid
  within, who had no outlook but the dull streaks of water against the panes
  and a perpetual line of rough hill-land. Sometimes it cleared towards
  evening, and then the lady would dismount and walk down the yellowing
  mountain track where the pools glowed in links of pure fire. In these hours
  she became cheerful, but in the long black showers she was sad and
  absent-minded, dwelling always on the past and its melancholy change. As for
  Francis, he was so old a wayfarer that he endured all weathers with
  equanimity. Only, when soaked to the skin and with no sight but blank hills,
  he would begin to think on the futility of his errand and torment his brain
  with projects of vain endeavour.</p>

  <p>But with the Lowlands came July days when the sun was hot in the sky and
  the roads white underfoot. It was now that Margaret recovered her spirits and
  found humour in every halting-place and something pleasant to her curiosity
  in the vivid life of the road. Her cheeks got a touch of colour, till she no
  longer formed such a sharp contrast to the gipsy Francis. Yet the life had
  still all the hardships of a journey, for the roads were broken in many
  places with recent passage of armies, the inns were filled with an air of
  suspicion, and piteous sights were always at hand to remind of war. This was
  in the North, but as they drew to the Midlands they found a lush and settled
  country which seemed terribly unfriendly to fugitives from a mourning land.
  For the first time they felt their presence among a people of alien
  sentiments and blood, a peaceable folk who dwelt among orderly hedgerows and
  neat, garden-like fields. And with the thought the bright and bitter past
  grew more irrevocable, and both alike were plagued with hapless memories.</p>

  <p>For Francis each day meant much careful forethought and not seldom
  high-handed intrusion. As it chanced, many of the inns were filled with the
  stream of travellers between North and South, and to get comfort he had to
  assume a high air of dignity and show a bluff self-confidence he did not
  feel. Fortunately his purse was heavy, and in this easy land he found money a
  passport to more things than in the flinty North. But his mind was in a
  perpetual worry, for to haggle about the little things of life had never been
  his task before, and he found it irksome. His consolation lay in Margaret's
  entire immunity from such trivial cares; if her life must be sorrowful and
  vain, it would at least be free from the grossness of worry.</p>

  <p>The road was uneventful though it was the morning after a war, and one
  incident alone is worthy of record. In a little town on the Warwick borders
  they halted for a night, and after dusk Francis went out as his custom was to
  sober his thoughts with the night air. A year ago he had been a boy; now he
  felt himself an aging broken man, driven in curb along a stony path of
  virtue, a man passionate yet austere, with a cold, scrupulous heart and a
  head the prey of every vagrom fancy. A man with great capacities, truly, but
  scarcely a man to live pleasantly, at ease with himself and the world.</p>

  <p>Round the gate of the inn-yard there was the usual idle throng. As he
  jostled his way through, one turned sharply round, recognition shining in his
  eyes. He put his hand on Francis' shoulder and followed him to the street.
  "Mr. Birkenshaw, my dear man," he cried, "do I trust my ain een? What brings
  ye here o' a' places on earth? I have had hell's luck since I left you at
  Leidburn, but you look stout and flourishing."</p>

  <p>When Francis recognised in the tattered lad the great Starkie, his former
  friend, his first feeling was of rage, fierce and unthinking. What right had
  this tatterdemalion, this ghost from the past, to come here and remind him of
  his folly, when he loathed it with his whole heart and soul? It was a
  pitiable figure, unshaven, haggard, with blear eyes and a shambling
  walk,&mdash;a thing all but over the verge of beggary. And this had once
  claimed him as companion and now called him friend!</p>

  <p>"Ye're the lad for me, Mr. Birkenshaw. Ye've the master mind. I see ye've
  your braw leddy here that flyted on ye at Leidburn. Ye wad sune mak' it up
  wi' her, for ye were a lad wi' weemen?" And he wandered into obscenity.</p>

  <p>Francis took him by the collar and held him firm. "See here, Mr. Stark, if
  ye mention the lady's name again I will fling ye over the brig as I once
  flung ye into a ditch. You and me quitted partnership lang syne. If it's
  money ye want I will help ye to the best of my power, but let there be no
  talk of friendship."</p>

  <p>The boy whimpered. "What's ta'en ye at an auld freend?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"We have taken different roads, you and me," said Francis.</p>

  <p>"Ye may set yoursel' abune me if ye please. I am puir and ye are rich, but
  I never took anither man's wife to traivel the high-roads wi' me."</p>

  <p>Francis' fingers itched for his ears. "I am not a patient man, as ye know,
  Mr. Stark."</p>

  <p>"Patient or no, what do I care? But there's ae thing I can see wi' my een,
  and that is that there's some o' His Majesty's sodgers wad be glad to ken
  that ye were here and this leddy wi' ye." He shrieked out his words while
  cunning twinkled in his little eyes.</p>

  <p>"If ye say a word more, sir, or if ye dare but try what ye threaten, by
  God I'll send ye to your Master or ever ye can cheep. Do ye think I'm to be
  trifled wi' that ye try my hand here?" And he spoke so fiercely and with such
  angry eyes that the wretched Starkie seemed to shrivel up into apology.</p>

  <p>"God, Francie!" he cried, "gie me siller and let me off, for I'm
  starving."</p>

  <p>Francis thrust some coins into his dirty palm and watched him turn with
  scarcely a word of thanks and shuffle back to the inn. He was angry with
  himself, angry and ashamed. He almost pitied the wretch, and yet he loathed
  him and feared him and all the black past which he stood for. All his little
  self-composure was sent broadcast on the winds. He knew himself for the
  ragged, inconstant fool that he was, with but a thought dividing his veneer
  of virtue from the stark blackguardism of the vagrant. It was a stormy-souled
  man who tossed that night upon his bed, and rose in the morning with
  something greyer and bleaker in his determination.</p>

  <p>As they passed out into the street a hollow-faced boy, still half-tipsy
  from the night's debauch, cried good morning and a pleasant journey.</p>

  <p>"Who is that man?" asked Margaret, carelessly.</p>

  <p>"He was one of my former friends," said Francis, and rode forward.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">As they came near the city where the roads from the North
  converged into one great highway, their journey was hindered with the
  constant passing of military. Once more they were in the air of war, for a
  prisoner would pass, or a forlorn and anxious band of his kinsfolk, or a
  great northern lord or lady&mdash;all on their way to the great centre of
  fate. Francis felt no fear of recognition, for his part, though played in the
  thick of affairs, had been secret from the multitude. Once only, when a lady
  whom he knew for Miss Cranstoun of Gair, looked curiously at the tall, brown,
  sombre cavalier, did he turn away his face in doubt. But for the most part he
  held his head carelessly amid the throng of wayfarers.</p>

  <p>The last night's halting-place was in a little town on the edge of
  Hertfordshire, a place among green meadows and rushy waters. At its one inn
  they found no one but a groom rubbing down a horse in the courtyard, and from
  the look of beast and man it seemed as if some person of importance were
  using the hostel. In the one dining-room when both sat down to supper a man
  was looking out of the window and drumming on the pane. He turned round at
  their entrance, and in a second Francis had in his mind the Highland inn and
  the carousing by the fire; for in the stranger he saw the rosy face and heavy
  figure of Forbes of Culloden, the Lord President.</p>

  <p>He felt he was recognised, he felt too that this man was well aware who
  was the lady who sat down with him. As it chanced Margaret, who had seen the
  great lawyer scores of times, saw in him only a chance stranger; the dusk was
  gathering, she was tired with the day's toil, and she had no memory for
  faces. Forbes bowed to her curtly and without a word withdrew.</p>

  <p>Francis ate his meal in a fever of anxiety. This man held both in his
  hands, and on the one former occasion of meeting he had insulted him, using
  as a weapon the name of this very lady. He knew of the popular report which
  made the Lord President's name a synonym for kindliness; but would he forgive
  so arch an offender, would he believe in the honesty of one who had so
  recently played a very different part? As soon as he could he left the room
  on some pretext to go in search of him.</p>

  <p>He found him on the threshold, smoking with great deliberation and
  watching the glow of sunset over the fields. "So we meet again, Mr.
  Birkenshaw?" he observed drily.</p>

  <p>"It is on that point I have come to speak, my lord," said Francis. "You
  favour the other side in politics, but folk say that you are not a man that
  loves extremes. You see our wretched position, and I would ask your
  forbearance."</p>

  <p>"Ye are a Jacobite renegade," said the other, "and ye ask me to let ye be.
  That I can understand. But what for does this lady go with you? Are ye up to
  some new devilry, Mr. Birkenshaw? For if ye are, lad, and would drag the
  bonniest woman in the land into the same bog, then by God I will make you pay
  for it with every bone in your body." And his honest old eyes twinkled with
  wrath.</p>

  <p>Then Francis with a shamefast air had to set to and tell him the history
  of the whole business, leaving out only such parts as concerned Lovat and the
  Prince. The old man stopped him once and again, bidding him say no more about
  this or that matter, as it might be best for him to hear least. To the whole
  tale of Murray of Broughton he listened eagerly, murmuring under his breath.
  Then he took Francis' hand, and stared hard into his eyes till he was fain to
  shut them against that steely glitter.</p>

  <p>"I believe ye to be a true man, Mr. Birkenshaw, and I ask your pardon. But
  this is a most lamentable tale ye have to tell me. Lord, man, I am driven
  crazy wi' the cruelties that are being perpetrated in the North on the puir
  people. I have run to and fro atween Stair and Tweeddale and got satisfaction
  nowhere. Aye, I have even licked the boots o' Cumberland, that haggis of a
  man, and suffered his clownish insults. I have been fleein' here and there
  night and day on the business of that fule Cromarty, and now I come up here
  to try once more and wring water out of a stane. Heard ye o' the death o' the
  two lords, Balmerino and Kilmarnock? God, there was a tale for history! And
  now there may be a third, if a' ye say is true, seeing that my Lord Lovat is
  taken."</p>

  <p>"Taken!" cried Francis; "when, how?"</p>

  <p>"I kenna," said the other, shortly. "But a day syne a coach passed me and
  a great guard o' dragoons. I asked at the captain whae was his prisoner and
  he bade me look inside; and there, grinning like a wull-cat, was the auld
  wizened face o' the Fraser."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br>
  Of an Interview in an Unlikely Place.</h2>

  <p class="first">Lady Manorwater greeted her cousin with a dignified
  kindliness. She was a pale woman of middle age, with the faded blue eyes and
  yellow hair of one type of Scotswoman. Fervently devout, as was the habit of
  her house, she carried her devotion beyond the other Catholic ladies of her
  time, and seemed ever posturing as a colourless saint. She thought of
  politics and her kinsfolk only as things far away; for her the living reality
  of life was found in the little chapel where at frequent hours she would
  retire to a dim world of candles and paternosters. Her two sons were boys in
  their early teens; and these with the servants made up the whole household in
  Great Marlow Street. A perpetual air of peril hung over the house, for men
  came there on short visits by day and night whose names had been proclaimed
  at law, and under the cloak of her pious and unworldly name treason had
  flourished and many a secret conclave had met undisturbed. She welcomed her
  cousin with kindness, for she had ever been fond of the beautiful girl; more,
  it pleased her that she should flee to her of all her kin at this hour of
  danger. It seemed like a recognition of that sanctity she believed to be
  hers.</p>

  <p>Towards Francis she wore the stiffness which she used to all mankind. He
  was beyond the circle of her thoughts, unrelated by blood and alien in creed.
  The place was in no disorder; the life was as full of punctiliousness as in a
  great house in times of peace. At first it irritated Francis, for he who had
  come on solemn business had no inclination for a farce of comfort. But soon
  he was glad, for it distracted Margaret's thoughts and restored her to some
  portion of the elegancies of life. For her there was no going in and out and
  sharing in the gaieties of town. London was bitterly hostile to her cause;
  the streets were full of a mob shouting coarse party cries; and every day
  almost there was some fresh death for the populace to gape at. So the women
  abode indoors, while Francis wandered fiercely about the city.</p>

  <p>As soon as he might, he sought out the lodging of the Lord President in
  the Haymarket. Forbes sat before a pile of papers, in a fine reek of tobacco
  smoke, while two harassed clerks scribbled in a corner. At the sight of the
  visitor he opened the door to a smaller sitting-room and bade him follow.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Birkenshaw, how have ye been employing your time hereaways?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"As best I could," said Francis. "This much I know, that Murray lies in
  the Tower with his honour still untarnished. Traitor or no, his treachery has
  not yet been put to proof."</p>

  <p>"True enough," said Forbes. "His examination begins next week. Have ye any
  work on hand ye may desire my help in?"</p>

  <p>"It is my wish to get speech of the Secretary."</p>

  <p>Forbes hummed a little. "It is unconstitutional," he said, "but it might
  be managed, though I see not what it will serve. Ye will be bearing him
  messages from his wife and kin?"</p>

  <p>"I will be striving to bring him to a better mind," said Francis. "You
  know what I mean, my lord."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, sir, I ken nothing but what I choose to ken. Besides, when so
  much is thrust down my throat there is no need for idle guesses;" and he
  looked up with a twinkle of intelligence which served the other's
  purpose.</p>

  <p>There was silence for a little, while street cries floated up and a catch
  of a song which the Lord President whistled. "I know the desperation of my
  plans," said Francis; "but then it is no time for little makeshifts."</p>

  <p>"If ye kenned the circumstances o' the time better, sir, ye might think
  them a little more desperate. Here are you, a lad without penetration, with
  no knowledge of the world, and ye are for visiting a noted prisoner of state
  and 'bringing him to a better mind;'" and the old man laughed
  sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"I fight for my own hand," said Francis, gloomily; "I can at least harm no
  man but myself."</p>

  <p>Forbes looked at him shrewdly for a second, and then drew his chair closer
  with a serious face.</p>

  <p>"Would ye wonder greatly if I were to give ye some hint of the way the
  wind blows, Mr. Francis? Would it amaze ye to hear that those in power are
  none so keen about this affair of the Secretary? His intention is ower plain
  to mistake, and I can tell ye, sir, there are many on our side forbye myself
  that do not like it. The rising is utterly broken, and two great lords have
  already paid the penalty with their heads. It is a civilised people making
  war within itself, and the best statesmen have no craving for a glut of
  blood. Now mark ye what happens. The thing appears to be near a natural end.
  Scores of the common folk have swung for it, and there is hope that the worst
  is over. Then here comes the arch-plotter and gives himself up of his own
  free-will. Any bairn can make the inference. Mr. Murray has something to
  tell, and there is but one person in our hands that such a tale can affect.
  This person, as it chances, is of great fame and far stricken in years. Ye
  follow my words, Mr. Birkenshaw?"</p>

  <p>Francis nodded, seeing a gleam of light.</p>

  <p>"It is true that all the bloodhounds of the courts and the common ruck of
  the nation are never tired of butchery; but I speak of the great and wise who
  have the real ordering of the land, and alone think truly of its welfare. Do
  you not perceive that this has some bearing on your case, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Then I may hope&mdash;" began Francis, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Softly, sir," said the Lord President. "I have nothing to do with what
  you hope. As an officer of law it is my business to see that you hope
  nothing. I was declaring a point of pure theory. Supposing, sir, supposing, I
  say, that the King's government woke up to-morrow and found Mr. Murray no
  longer a resident in a certain place, the best and most powerful would be the
  least sorry."</p>

  <p>"But the thing you speak of is near impossible."</p>

  <p>"Not so," said the other. "It would be possible&mdash;again I consider it
  in theory&mdash;for a powerful minister even to use some influence to see
  that the chance of the aforesaid gentleman's departure at least was there.
  The guard might be selected with some discretion on that particular night,
  Mr. Francis."</p>

  <p>Francis was looking steadfastly at the floor, in a profound study.</p>

  <p>"I think I have followed, my lord," he said, looking up. "I cannot tell
  you my gratitude."</p>

  <p>"There is a further matter to mention," said Forbes. "I presume that in
  such a supposed event a certain gentleman would fall into the hands of the
  law," and he looked with meaning.</p>

  <p>"It seems the only way," said Francis.</p>

  <p>"Then, of course, you have understood that the full rigour of the law's
  vengeance would fall on such an one. Whatever the Government might think in
  its private heart, it must show a severe front to the world. The lad that
  sought to fill Mr. Secretary's place would swing from a tow ere the week was
  out."</p>

  <p>"I have considered it, my lord," said Francis, though with a whitening
  face.</p>

  <p>"Yet, supposing the lad to have a great spirit, he would deem his neck's
  safety a small thing compared with the honour of his friends?"</p>

  <p>"Doubtless he would," said Francis, between closed teeth.</p>

  <p>At this the Lord President rose and gathered his papers together. "I have
  to tell ye, sir," he said gravely, "that I honour ye for a very gallant
  gentleman." Then, as he conducted him to the door of his lodging, he spoke
  quietly in his ear, "I would recommend the third night from this if any one
  thought of putting the supposititious theory into practice."</p>

  <p>Hitherto a certain gentleman has come but little into our tale; now he
  must enter for an hour ere taking a long farewell. Times had changed with
  John Murray of Broughton, and it was a careworn, peevish man who sat in his
  prison chamber looking forth at the evening sky from a barred slit in the
  massive stone. He still wore the stained clothes he had travelled in, and
  what with the bare furnishing and the high, shadowy vaulting the scene and
  the man looked dismally comfortless. Most of his time he spent in pacing the
  length of his chamber, with knitted brow and lips that muttered ceaselessly.
  The toil had soon worn him thin; he had lost his old florid colour; and what
  with his past privations and his present disquietude, it was a mere shade of
  his old self that sat moodily in the dusk of the evening.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the door was opened by a turnkey and a visitor was ushered in.
  The warder left without locking the door, and the stranger advanced to his
  side. He had risen and stood inquiringly regarding a tall man, dressed
  plainly, and with a great horseman's jacket turned up about his ears. Not
  till he had advanced some paces to the light did he see clearly, and then he
  went forward to greet him with outstretched hands. For it was a mark of the
  Secretary that no name or face which he once heard or saw was ever
  forgotten.</p>

  <p>"God bless you, Mr. Birkenshaw, and I am blithe to get a sight of an old
  face. I am dying in these walls for some token that my friends have not
  forgotten me. But how comes it that you are admitted? for they keep me here
  as close as a mad tyke. I trust you have run into no grave personal risk on
  account of my worthless self?"</p>

  <p>"It matters little how I came in, sir, and be assured I am running no
  risk. I have come to have some talk with you on a little private matter. But
  I would inquire after your health. How do you bear the mournful events of
  these latter days?" Francis spoke shortly but not uncivilly, for indeed the
  man's old rank and present discomfort impelled him to some politeness.</p>

  <p>"Alas for a poor people!" cried the Secretary, sinking back in his chair.
  "It is the way of all great causes, when brave hearts perish and senseless
  force crushes out loyalty and honour. You saw the saddest day in Scotland's
  history, unless there have been more awful crimes since I last saw the open
  sky." He spoke in the style of Lovat, but to Francis, knowing the man only
  too shrewdly, the words seemed void of meaning.</p>

  <p>"Many honest fellows have been swinging on Hairibee," said he, "and two
  great lords have met their doom on the Tower hill."</p>

  <p>The Secretary shut his lips to hide the quivering. "Even so," he said,
  "death is the end of all our desires. Did you bring any message from our
  friends in the North?"</p>

  <p>"None," said Francis, "for my errand was but a matter of personal
  satisfaction. I came to ask if you fulfilled my request before the unhappy
  day at Culloden?" And he looked hard at the other.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," said Murray, simply. "The letters have long perished. But what
  makes you so eager to ken?"</p>

  <p>"The Lord Lovat is now in his enemies' hands," said Francis, "and, as
  there is like to be much brought against him, I wished to have no sad
  reflections that remissness of mine had brought him to his undoing. I do not
  hint anything of blame to you in the matter, but if perchance the thing had
  been mislaid, it would be a formidable article in the charge."</p>

  <p>Murray ignored the slur and fastened on the mere statement, but it was
  clear that the words moved him.</p>

  <p>"Lovat is taken, you say?" he cried. "God, that is the end of the Cause
  with a vengeance, for they have gotten the greatest intellect in all Scotland
  or France. Have they brought him here?"</p>

  <p>"It is some days since," said Francis.</p>

  <p>"But what can they prove against him?" he asked excitedly. "He wasna out
  with the rest no more than Traquair and the Macleods. They're safe enough in
  their hidy-holes, and wherefore no Lovat? Ye say they will have much matter
  to bring against him, but it beats me to tell where they'll get a boddle's
  worth. I tell ye, sir, it will be a glorious acquittal." And he looked on
  Francis with keen, sagacious little eyes.</p>

  <p>To his hearer every word was offensive, so clearly did it argue a black
  purpose. No doubt the man acted his part cunningly, but there was a trip in
  his tongue, a falter in his readiness which belied him. Francis stared on him
  with gathering brows.</p>

  <p>"And how is it with yourself, Mr. Murray? Are you too to have a glorious
  acquittal, or are ye deep in the black books of the Government, like the
  honest gentlemen who are gone?"</p>

  <p>The Secretary shook his head and passed his hand over his eyes.</p>

  <p>"My days are numbered," he said, "numbered like the rest. I cannot look
  for mercy, for I have been at my master's side in all his calamities, and my
  name is near as well kenned as his own. Think you they will let me go now
  they have got me?" and even in his fright his breast seemed to swell with
  importance. "I could have wished to die in my own land by the side of the
  brave Keppoch at Culloden or among the heather hills; but I have screwed my
  courage to the cauld death which awaits me. After all, it is but a short and
  easy passage to a better world."</p>

  <p>Francis sat in silence, his eyes scanning him up and down so intently that
  the voice quavered in the last words.</p>

  <p>"It is of this chiefly that I came to speak," he said. "Your friends in
  the North, me among the rest, and many others whom it would not be well to
  name, have considered that you, as the Prince's best friend, would be a sore
  loss to the Cause. So by perilous ways we have contrived a means whereby you
  may escape and get safely over the water."</p>

  <p>Murray lifted his head, and looked with wild eyes upon the speaker.</p>

  <p>"It's a device of little subtilty, and it has been used before with some
  success. You and I are much of a height. You have only to change clothes with
  me, wrap this same riding-cloak about your ears, and take your leave. I have
  purposely made the clothing somewhat kenspeckle, that the men may notice it
  and pay less heed to the face. The warders are picked men, and more than one
  are in the secret. At the last gate you will meet one of our own countrymen,
  an Argyle Campbell, who will give you the word, 'To which passage?' You have
  but to answer, 'To the Fords of Tyne,' and he will follow you beyond the
  bounds, and see you safely to the door of your wife's lodging. There all is
  ready for flight this very evening, and ere morn you may be on the high seas.
  But you must hasten, Mr. Murray, for the hours pass."</p>

  <p>But the Secretary's face showed no joyful surprise, no eagerness, only
  discomfort, timidity, and doubt. He rose stammering from his chair.</p>

  <p>"I am grateful, Mr. Birkenshaw, grateful to you and all the good friends.
  Be sure I am grateful;" and he walked hastily up and down. "But, my lad, it
  canna be. You purpose to stay in my place. Do ye not see that it means that
  your life will be forfeit, that you alone will be left to bear the wrath of a
  tricked government? I may be soured and ill-grained, but God knows I have not
  come to such a depth as to allow such a cruel sacrifice. A young life," he
  repeated. "It canna be."</p>

  <p>"But I am willing," cried Francis. "Think what the thing involves. I am a
  landless, kinless man, and no one will mourn my end. Nay, it would be a
  matter of highest satisfaction to myself that I could die so well. But you
  have a wife, you are a member of a great house, above all, you are one of the
  few props of a feeble cause." Even as he spoke the words disgusted him. He
  saw treachery written so plainly on this man's face that he would have been
  glad to catch him by the neck and drive him out perforce. Something of his
  feelings must have been apparent, for Murray asked suddenly,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Had Meg anything to do with this errand? It would be like one of her daft
  games."</p>

  <p>"Surely your wife has a hand in the matter," said Francis, "seeing that
  even now she is waiting to carry you with her to France."</p>

  <p>"I might have guessed it," he said. "But what sort of scheme is it? How
  could you think it so easy to win aboard when the sea-shore is watched by the
  King's dragoons like the Tower courtyard? It is mere madness, Mr. Birkenshaw;
  I canna consent."</p>

  <p>Now in these last words the true reason of all lay apparent. He had some
  plan on hand which would bring him certain safety, and he had no mind to
  change this security for the difficult chance of a midnight flight. He was so
  stripped to the framework of his nature that Francis could all but read his
  thoughts in his eye, and at the sight the young man's blood ran hot with
  rage.</p>

  <p>Then of his own accord Murray brought the farce to its close. He sat down
  squarely in his chair, and looked guilelessly at the other. "You have my best
  thanks, but the thing is beyond my power. I cannot hold my safety, nay, even
  the safety of a great cause, dearer than my honour, and if I consented to
  your plan my conscience would never give me another moment's peace. I am no
  coward, sir, to fear death, and in waiting here I but await the doom of many
  of my own kinsmen and kindest friends."</p>

  <p>He stopped abruptly, for Francis stood over him, a fury of hate. "My God,
  sir," he cried, "if you value your soul, stop this canting talk. I will tell
  you why you will not leave this place. You have some Judas secret to tell to
  our enemies which you hope may save your own coward neck and give you back
  your possessions. That is the hell's trick you would play, and may the Lord
  in heaven have pity on you, you lying dog, for I will have none."</p>

  <p>For a second the Secretary's life hung in the balance. The "Birkenshaw
  glower," once famed over Tweeddale, burned deep in the eyes of this young
  avenging fury. His fingers twitched at his sword's handle. The thought of
  slaying this man and so putting an end to all the difficulty, had occurred to
  him once and again, and had always been put from him. Now it rose uppermost
  in his mind. The thought of a woman's tears drove him frantic, and Francis
  for one instant was on the verge of murder, while Murray lay back gasping in
  his chair.</p>

  <p>But the white, weak, unwholesome face deterred him. The man seemed worn
  with toils, seemed spiritless, friendless, and feeble. He could not draw upon
  him any more than upon a woman. With a cry of despair he turned upon his heel
  and left the room.</p>

  <p>At the last gate the Campbell hailed him. "To what passage?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"To the Fords&mdash;" said Francis, mechanically, while the man made as if
  to join him. Then, recollecting himself, "No, no, Heaven knows where," he
  cried almost with tears, and hastened out into the darkness.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">As Margaret sat watching by the window in a pitiful state of
  anxiety, Francis came roughly into the room. She ran swiftly forward and laid
  a hand on his arm, for such little tendernesses had been common in her ways
  of late.</p>

  <p>"Why, you are back!" she cried, "and I had never thought to see you
  again;" and with all her striving she could not keep a ring of exultation
  from her words.</p>

  <p>"It is all up, my dear lady," said Francis, hoarsely. "I was a useless
  messenger. The Secretary has scruples about leaving his present quarters, and
  I was unable to persuade him bye them." And with a foolish smile he laid his
  horseman's cloak on the table.</p>

  <p>Margaret stood looking with sad, drooped eyes. "Nevertheless you have done
  your most, Francis."</p>

  <p>But he was not listening. He had set himself down before the table, and
  had leaned his head on both hands. "Oh," he cried, "I have no gift of
  success. Whatever I take up miscarries. I am but a poor sort of fushonless
  creature, meant to be guided by stronger men. All that I do ends in
  moonshine. I can see no light in the whole black pit of this life."</p>

  <p>"Nay, Francis," said she, "surely there is some comfort, for though you
  could not save others, you have brought yourself back unharmed."</p>

  <p>It was a silly woman's argument, but he, lifting his eyes carelessly at
  the words, saw something in the lady's face which made him redden and stare
  hard out of the window.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br>
  The Last of the Secretary.</h2>

  <p class="first">Amid a crowd of notables and fashionables, where the wits of
  the coffee-houses rubbed elbows with the beaus of the Mall, Francis pressed
  to hear the last scene in the drama which had been played athwart his own
  life. The Lord President had gained him admission, and so this morning he
  stood in the great hushed Westminster chamber, watching the lords in their
  robes, the frowning bench of judges, and at the bar the huddled figure of the
  old lord with his two piercing eyes still mocking at the world.</p>

  <p>It was a farce even to his layman's eye,&mdash;a cruel, fantastic farce,
  with death waiting to pull down the curtain. Lovat had no aid but his own
  tongue, and for days he had toiled, cross-questioning witnesses on the other
  side, putting the necessary inquiries to his own supporters, till his face
  had grown ashen grey and he had swooned at the bar. His four counsel were of
  the most ineffectual cast, and would have turned the whole affair into an
  ugly mimicry by catching at points of form but for the old man's restraining
  voice. At first he did his work well, even jocularly, but as his weariness
  grew greater his questions lost all their pith and he relapsed into dignity
  and silence. The bearing of the old traitor struck Francis with
  admiration,&mdash;at once deferential and free, defiant and courteous. He had
  his compliments for the Lords, his tags of quotation, his excellent
  sentiments; but the certainty of death seemed to give a nobility to what had
  seemed before a silly farrago.</p>

  <p>But as Francis listened and waited, the finishing touch was added to the
  picture; for into the witness-box came a shamefast figure, the very one he
  had held at his mercy in that Tower chamber, and to which he had shown a way
  of life it would have none of. Every eye in the assembly turned to these
  square feet of wood where the witness stood meekly, looking with conciliating
  eyes to the benches of Lords and nervously fingering his cravat. Every face
  was eager with curiosity, some dark with ill-concealed disgust, while among
  the few friends of the prisoner there were twitching lips and hands hard at
  side.</p>

  <p>Lovat had sunk in a stupor of weakness, and had not noticed the new
  arrival. Murray answered questions glibly and precisely in a tone of utmost
  cheerfulness. Then the clerk read the statement wherein he, John Murray,
  umquhile of Broughton, with the deepest penitence for past errors, with
  promise of amends and hope of his Majesty's infinite clemency, told to his
  gracious captors the full tale of the late lamentable events, more especially
  the part played by Simon Fraser, called the Lord Lovat, certain documents
  being adduced in clear proof of such statements. As the soft voice of the
  witness and then the hard clerk-like tones fell on his ear the old lord
  roused himself to interest. The shaggy head grew erect, and the eyes played
  with the unhappy man as he shifted his balance from one foot to the other and
  sought in all that place for a friendly glance. Ere the thing was finished he
  had hazarded a look at the man he had ruined and then drawn back in terror.
  He could not face the silent mockery of those eyes, the eyes of the wisest
  head in Scotland. Much they had seen, those eyes, at home and abroad, at the
  King's court and in the wild Stratherick. And now, with no fear of man, they
  looked through the one who had lent the chief hand to his overthrow.</p>

  <p>The Lord High Steward asked if he would question the witness.</p>

  <p>Lovat bowed politely. "Nay, my lord," he said, "I think Mr. Murray and I
  already understand each other;" and the smile on his lips was caught by the
  rest till Francis found himself all but laughing at the singular comedy.</p>

  <p>The clerk rose according to custom, to read the portion of the defence
  which had been set in writing against Murray's charges. It was excellent
  rhetoric, stinging words under which the unfortunate gentleman cowered in
  some misery.</p>

  <p>"Murray, the most abandoned of mankind," ran the paper, "who hath sought
  like another Catiline to patch up a broken fortune upon the ruin and distress
  of his native country; stealing into France to enter upon engagements upon,
  your Lordships may believe, the most sacred oaths of fidelity, and now
  appearing at your Lordships' bar to betray these very secrets, which he
  confessed he had drawn from the person he called his lord, his prince and
  master, under the greatest confidence." So the clerk read, while the assembly
  grinned, and Lovat smacked his lips at his own invective.</p>

  <p>Francis had no heart for more, but as he turned to push his way back, he
  caught a glimpse of the Lord President in the crowd. He also seemed about to
  leave, and the two met in the great corridor.</p>

  <p>"This is the work of your friends," said Francis, wildly.</p>

  <p>"It is the wark of my friends, and I am bitter ashamed. The fules! To set
  an auld man on a pinnacle to mock at till he gets him an appearance of virtue
  he never could have worn elsewhere. I have been Sim Fraser's neist neighbour
  all my days, and though I could not help but like the man, I kenned him ower
  weel to trust him with a boddle. But I think shame to see him worried like a
  rabbit in a dyke, and him wi' his grey hairs. Be sure, Mr. Birkenshaw, the
  Fraser will come out of the game with the maist credit."</p>

  <p>"I want a further favour, my lord," said Francis, "and it is that I be
  allowed to visit Lord Lovat before his end. There are some matters that I
  would like to talk over, and certain passages between us want redding
  up."</p>

  <p>Forbes knit his brows. "It canna be till the trial's ower," he said. "They
  keep him ower close. But after&mdash;it is possible. Maybe you might win to
  him the last night."</p>

  <p>Francis thanked him and hurried out to the cheerful life of the street.
  The place was full of cries and the rattle of vehicles, the shouts of
  chairmen, and the hum of voices. It was a fresh, breathing world, and above
  was the infinite unchangeable blue of sky. For a second the cobwebs of
  miserable intrigue were cleared from his brain. He saw the littleness of
  man's schemes, the ease of death, the cataclysm of hopes and fears, as in a
  sharp moment of time. But again he was back at his sad memories. Here in this
  alien place the last blow was being struck at a cause he had stood for. Tush!
  It was little he cared about the Cause, it was the people he had served and
  loved, the old memories and sentiments of the few against the many, which
  were being swallowed up in this callous present.</p>

  <p>For days he wandered fiercely in the streets, picking up fragments of news
  and cursing his powerlessness. He heard of the verdict, and then of the
  sentence of death received with a cheerful composure, even with a joke. At
  the hearing his old admiration revived for the indomitable man who could wait
  on the last enemy with a gibe. He counted the hours till the day of meeting.
  This, after all, was the fortunate warrior, who could go out of life with a
  twitch of his cloak and a word of scorn to his tormentors. The grossness, the
  cunning, the malice were all forgotten; he remembered only Lovat of the many
  generous sentiments, the great chief of Fraser, and the wisest brain in the
  North.</p>

  <p>In the chill of the last Wednesday evening he was admitted at the gate of
  the Tower and led to the prisoner's chamber. As they went down the passage
  there were sounds of riotous mirth coming from the melancholy place. The
  warder looked hopelessly bewildered. "This is the way those wild Scots
  prepare for death," he cried. "I have had twenty-three honest gentlemen in my
  hands before they took their last walk, and all spent their last evening in
  meditation and prayer." When the door was opened the room seemed filled with
  tobacco reek and the fumes of punch. Through the smoke Francis saw some few
  of Lovat's near kin, making as merry as if it were an alehouse in Inverness.
  General Williamson, the Lieutenant-colonel of the Tower, sat opposite the
  prisoner, apparently in some discomfort. The old lord himself was reading
  from a paper, with a pair of enormous spectacles stuck on his nose and a
  handkerchief in his hand. A fire burned in the grate, but the prisoner's
  blood seemed chilly, for he wore enormous hose turned up over his knees and a
  pair of buckled slippers. His face had lost its pallor and shone with the
  heat and the wine.</p>

  <p>"I am touched," cried he, looking at the paper. "Here's this
  body&mdash;Paynter they call him, a noble-hearted fellow for
  certain&mdash;writes to Mr. Secretary Pelham, and I hear he has petitioned
  his Majesty likewise. And what do ye think the purport is? He wants the
  honour of being beheaded in the Lord Lovat's stead. See the creature fair
  fleeches and begs! 'I pray you, sir, intercede with the King that the Lord
  Lovat may be pardoned.' These are his words." And he took off his spectacles,
  wiped them carefully, and then surveyed the company. "I thank God that there
  are still good men in the world. 'Greater love than this hath no man, that a
  man lay down his life for a friend.' What think ye o' that, gentlemen?"</p>

  <p>The Lieutenant said something about the man's being crazed.</p>

  <p>"And indeed I am of your opinion," said Lovat. "Clearly the creature must
  be daft. For see what he calls me&mdash;'a vile traitor, an ungrateful
  wretch.' Weel, weel, I doubt the poor gentleman is weary of living in this
  wicked world."</p>

  <p>Then, catching sight of Francis, "Eh, here's a welcome face!" he cried,
  "my ancient friend Francie come to bid the auld man guid e'en. Here's a seat
  by my side, lad," and he pointed to a chair near the fireplace. "Now, sir,
  this is a merry meeting, and, as we cannot reasonably drink to many mair, we
  will even drink to it as it stands." And the Frasers filled up their glasses
  with due solemnity.</p>

  <p>"Ye did weel, sir," he said, speaking in Francis' ear. "I have heard from
  Duncan Forbes of your efforts, and be sure I do not forget them. But, lad, I
  couldna jouk my fate, and I must e'en submit. I thought I got a glisk o' ye
  in the Hall some days syne. Did ye hear my defence that I had the clerk set
  to read? Was it no bonny, and was it no dine to see yon scunnering creature,
  Murray, shift about as I told the world what I kenned of him?"</p>

  <p>Then he fell into a long strain of moralising after his fashion, but the
  near approach of death gave a flavour to his words which exalted them almost
  to wisdom. "See, Mr. Birkenshaw," he said simply, "ye are a young man and may
  take a word of counsel. I have maybe made a hash of my life, for I was ower
  wild and headstrong, and maybe ower given to the sins of the flesh. But after
  all I have had my sport out o' life. I have had my fingers in every pie
  that's been making, and, faith, I have created some sort of a steer in the
  world. And that would ever be my counsel to young blood&mdash;to gang forrit,
  set the world in a bleeze if ye can, and if ye get your hair singit as I've
  got mine, ye need never care for the sake o' the graund spectacle."</p>

  <p>He took out his watch and considered. "Twelve hours more in this
  middenstead of a world," he said, speaking loud to all. "Now mind ye, Shamus
  Fraser," and he turned to one of his friends, "ye hear the last injunctions
  of your chief. Ye will have my body buried in the kirk of Kirkhill, for there
  lie all the generations of Lovat, and I've put a note in my will by which I
  leave bountith to all the pipers frae John o' Groats to Edinburgh to play
  before my body. Lord, it will be a braw music, and I wish I could be there to
  hear it. But it's like that the Government will not allow it," he said sadly.
  "King Geordie is no sae mensefu' as King Jamie, and he has nae sense o'
  humour." He looked at the embers for a little and then turned round more
  cheerfully. "At any rate all the old women in my own country will cry the
  coronach, and it will be a wonderful crying, for I am the greatest chief in
  all the Highlands. And I will never see the heather hills more, nor the rigs
  o' Corryarrick;" and for a second his mocking face relaxed into plain
  sorrow.</p>

  <p>"I drink a good journey to you, Mac Shimei," and a tall Fraser rose with a
  trembling glass.</p>

  <p>"Amen," said Lovat, tossing off a cup, and then emptying his pipe ashes on
  the hearth. "See, gentlemen, the end of human life is like this snuff o'
  tobacco. A moment we are bleezing finely, and then we go out and nothing is
  left but grey ashes." And he sighed and sat for a little with his head on his
  breast.</p>

  <p>He turned to the Lieutenant and asked to see his little daughter. "Where's
  the wee bairn that used to come in and play hunt-the-gowk wi' me? She'll no
  be in bed yet, and I would like to bid farewell to her. She was a fine little
  lass."</p>

  <p>"I fear, my lord, you cannot see her," said the man, huskily. "She has
  done nothing but weep for two days since ever she heard of your fate. She is
  a little traitor at heart, for she abuses the King and his judges most
  roundly. I heard her only yesterday designing an escape for you from prison
  such as was given to the Apostles at Philippi. She will miss her play-fellow
  most bitterly."</p>

  <p>"Will she indeed?" said the old lord. "God bless the dear child, and make
  her eternally happy, for she is a good, kind-hearted lass."</p>

  <p>Shortly after this he desired that all should leave him save Francis and
  the Lieutenant. When they were alone he asked the latter to fetch Mr. Baker,
  the chaplain of the Sardinian ambassador, to give him the last comforts of
  the Church. "But I had thought you a Presbyterian, my lord," said the
  Lieutenant. "You passed for such through most of your career."</p>

  <p>"Policy often makes havoc wi' a man's creed," said Lovat, smiling
  wickedly, "but I have ever abode in the faith of the only true Kirk. I adhere
  to the rock on which Christ built his gospel. I ground my faith upon St.
  Peter and the succession of pastors from him down to the present, and I
  reject and renounce all sects and communities that are rejected by the Kirk.
  That is my confession of faith, and if you think it of sufficient importance
  to the world, sir, I will put it down in writing."</p>

  <p>"I did not know you were a theologian," said the other, in some
  wonder.</p>

  <p>"The world little kens what I am," said Lovat, and it was hard to tell
  whether the whole thing was jest or earnest. "Some day mayhap the world will
  do me justice, and the little children of the clan will be proud to think of
  their chief. But I've been like the Almighty, hiding my ways in the sea and
  my paths in the great waters, and it will take a wise man and a cunning to
  find them out. Francis, you have seen much of me, and I might have looked to
  you for a proper understanding of me, if ye hadna been so thick in the heid
  and dour in your ain conceit."</p>

  <p>"I have one question, my lord," said Francis. "I have bungled the trust
  you laid on me, but I have striven to keep my word. Do you absolve me from
  any blame in your death? It would let me lie down with an easier heart."</p>

  <p>"Absolve ye, lad? Freely; and mair, I have to thank ye kindly. I bid ye
  good-bye, for there'll be little time the morn. Gang back to your ain land,
  lad, and take my blessing with ye. And now I must ask ye to leave me to
  myself for a little, that I may prepare for the putting away of
  mortality."</p>

  <p>"But, my lord," cried the Lieutenant, "I have heard that there are
  differences even within your creed. The Sardinian chaplain has the name of a
  rank Jesuit. Are you too of that persuasion?"</p>

  <p>"A Jesuit?" said Lovat, with a twinkling eye and a gesture of doubt.
  "Faith, no, when I think upon it, I am a Jansenist. But anything in the shape
  o' a priest will serve my turn. Good-night to ye, gentlemen." And with this
  last piece of mystification he bade them farewell.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br>
  The Death of the Lord Lovat.</h2>

  <p class="first">The morning was mist and rain with a wind blowing from the
  east up the packed streets. It was like a f&ecirc;te-day in the town with people in
  Sunday clothes hastening Tower-wards. When Francis came down to the
  dining-room, a maid was scrubbing the hearth, the windows were open, and in
  the raw early chill there came a babble as of a city in expectation. He had
  slept scarcely a wink, being full of thought and a kind of bitter excitement.
  He knew the whole evil of Lovat's life, but this sounding fate seemed to
  elevate him into the heroic. For Francis the world at the moment held but one
  event and one man, and at the thought rage, compassion, and regret made a
  medley of his feelings.</p>

  <p>Margaret came down wrapped up in a thick cloak against the rawness of the
  morning. She wore the heavy veil she had thought needful for the open
  streets, and all her garments were of the sombrest black.</p>

  <p>"I could not go dressed otherwise," she said. "I could not put on a fine
  gown to witness the death of a friend. My cousin tells me to stay at home,
  for I shall only break my heart to no purpose; but when so few of his
  countrywomen will be near, I should think shame to be absent."</p>

  <p>Tales of Lovat's deeds and last dying confession had been printed in
  flying sheets, and were hawked up and down the causeways. The crush was
  already setting eastward, and one man was telling to another his version of
  this great affair. The name of this terrible outlawed monster had been long
  in the people's ears, and now they were to have a sight of him in all the
  pomp and contumely of a traitor's death. From the hanging windows crowds of
  fine ladies had dared the morning air to look down upon the throng; some even
  had risen early and in their coaches sought a stand upon Tower hill.</p>

  <p>The cheerful holiday crowd brought tears to Margaret's eyes, as Francis
  with his great shoulders clove a way through, his dark, uncommon face
  bringing him a certain respect.</p>

  <p>"We are strangers in a strange place," she said sadly. "What do these folk
  care for our broken King and people? And yet they say he had many
  well-wishers in this place."</p>

  <p>At Temple Bar the shrivelled heads of the Lords Balmerino and Kilmarnock
  grimaced at the crowd. At the sight Margaret clung closer to his arm. The
  rousing tale of Balmerino's conduct on the scaffold had stirred even the most
  Whiggish blood, and she looked at the poor dumb mouth, her face blanched with
  excitement, as in the old days when she had sat on horseback watching the
  entrance of the Camerons.</p>

  <p>"But he was young and strong," she cried, "and he might well face death
  courageously. But my Lord Lovat is old and feeble, and he cannot stand
  squarely against his foes." Then with a catching of the breath she would have
  stopped. "Oh, it is horrible! And this is the issue of great
  expectations!"</p>

  <p>The whole hill was black with folk, and on stands were many more of the
  better sort, all agape for the spectacle. The two halted yards off at the
  verge of the dense throng, where some carriages stood waiting. Afar like a
  toy building stood the scaffold with its bare timbers and the black-draped
  block and the guarded alley leading thither from the Tower gate. The thought
  of this one man alone or all but alone in this vast hostile sea of faces
  stirred Francis wildly, and he could scarcely bide still. The same thought
  was in Margaret's mind, for she looked with piteous eyes at the thick wall of
  men. "Oh, that we could get near him," she cried, "that he might have kind
  faces to look upon at the end!"</p>

  <p>As Francis looked round he saw in a coach among the others the Lord
  President. At once he made his way to his side. "May I beg you, my lord," he
  cried, "to watch over this lady and take her home when all is over? I would
  fain get near Lovat to-day."</p>

  <p>Forbes glanced at the slim, beautiful figure which he knew so well. "With
  all my heart, Mr. Birkenshaw," he said, while he held out a hand to Margaret.
  "The lady will see the last of our poor friend as well here as elsewhere. I
  wish you God-speed on your errand."</p>

  <p>"I shall win to him, though the crowd were ten times greater. It is better
  to leave you than to stay." And in a second he was lost in the thick of
  men.</p>

  <p>For many minutes he struggled as only the desperate can, elbowing
  fiercely, being struck again and again, gripping his opponents and
  half-suffocating them, till he had forced his way past. Now and then he would
  come to a knuckle of rising ground whence he saw the scaffold, and always he
  noted gladly that it was empty. Weaker men were fainting all about him, but
  his supple vigour had its effect, and soon he was half-way through, and then
  only a quarter of the space was left. He was breathless, hatless, his coat
  torn in many places, and his face sorely scratched. Then, as he saw the
  wooden planks almost within reach, he heard a great sigh of expectation go
  through the multitude, and the tramp of men above the other din told him that
  Lovat was coming.</p>

  <p>As he stood panting in the dense throng below, Lovat stood above him and
  cast a curious glance round the assembly. It happened on Francis, and his
  eager eyes told their tale. "I pray you, sir," he asked the Sergeant, "to
  allow this young gentleman to come up beside me. He is a dear friend, and has
  but newly arrived." The Sergeant, willing to pleasure the old man, gave an
  order, the crowd was opened by soldiers, and Francis found the way clear for
  him to ascend the platform. In a moment he was by Lovat's side, a new
  spectator of the last act in the play.</p>

  <p>Around&mdash;apparently for miles&mdash;was a dim circle of faces, and a
  hum rose from them, silent though they were, like the breathing of a great
  wild beast. Now and again a woman's or a boy's scream would break the air,
  only to be hushed again in the pitiless mass. It was as if one stood on a
  pinnacle, watched by a million hungry eyes which bit into the soul. Lovat
  cowered for a second, for no feeling is more awful for a moment than to be
  one against a host; then his spirit came back to him, and he turned to
  Francis, smiling.</p>

  <p>"The last time I stood before men under the sky was at my ain Castle
  Dounie," he said, "when I heartened my folk to die for the Prince. I am like
  to need all the heartening myself now." Then a twinge took him, and he all
  but fell into Francis' arms, while his clansman, Shamus Fraser, ran forward
  to help him. Supported thus, he limped across the platform, making a strange
  clatter in the quiet.</p>

  <p>Suddenly in the midst of the crowd something horrible happened; for the
  scaffolding of a stand gave way, and the erection with its inmates fell on
  the packed array of heads. In a moment there was a wild panic, to which
  soldiers fought their way with difficulty. For a little it seemed as if a
  great catastrophe impended, for several men were taken up dead and mangled,
  and the crowd was all but hysterical. Then slowly the tumult subsided, the
  dead were borne out, and eyes turned again to the scaffold.</p>

  <p>Lovat had watched the scene with delight. "There's some o' them killed,"
  he whispered breathlessly. "Weel, weel, so be it. The mair mischief the
  better sport." Francis looked at him in amazement. A second ago he had been
  ready to venerate this man as a hero; now, behold, it was the old Lovat back
  again, a very malicious, jeering hero, laughing cruelly in the article of
  death.</p>

  <p>"The sport's bye," he said, as expectant silence reigned again, "and now
  it's my turn to divert my friends. It's as weel, Francis, that it's an easy
  job, demanding small exertion on my part, for I am a done auld man."</p>

  <p>His whole humour seemed to change, as if he felt that men expected
  something high and heroical in his final bearing. He gave one last glance at
  the crowd. "God save us," he cried, "why should there be such a bustle about
  taking off an auld grey head that canna get up two steps without two men to
  support it? Francie, your airm, my son!"</p>

  <p>He limped up to the block, nodded cheerfully to the executioner, and
  begged to see the axe. "It might be sharper," he said, "but it hasna far to
  gang, and will maybe do." Then taking his gold-headed cane, he cried to a
  young lad who stood weeping behind him, "Alistair, my dear lad, take my staff
  and keep it weel for my sake. Ye've been a kind callant, and I wish I had a
  better gift." The poor boy took it, crying very bitterly, and turned away his
  face.</p>

  <p>Then taking off his coat and cravat with Francis' aid, he laid them down
  carefully, bidding the executioner keep them if he cared. Beside the block
  stood his coffin, and stooping down he read the inscription.</p>

  <p>"<i>Simon Dominus Fraser de Lovat</i>," he read, "<i>decollat &aelig;tat. su&aelig;
  80</i>."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Lord Fraser of Lovat&mdash; Beheaded for High Treason,
  at the Age of Eighty.]</p>

  <p>For some seconds he continued gazing, and then turned away with a
  sigh.</p>

  <p>"Happily my fame does not rest on this short line, Francis," he said.
  "But, indeed, what am I thinking of?" and he declaimed:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i>"'Nam genus et proavos, et qu&aelig; non fecimus ipsi,<br>
  Vix ea nostra voco.'"</i>*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* As for things done by our ancestors and other people
  than ourselves, I say we can have no credit for them. &mdash;Ovid,
  <i>Metamorphoses</i>, XIII, 140.]</p>

  <p>He turned to Shamus Fraser, and taking both hands bade him farewell. "My
  dear Shamus," he cried, "I am going to heaven, but you must continue to crawl
  a little longer in this evil world." And then he spoke to him shortly of his
  dying bequests, and his messages to his kinsfolk. The man was white and
  speechless, his dark face working with suppressed tears.</p>

  <p>Meantime Francis was in no better plight. He had been with this man in
  fair and foul, he knew his innumerable vices, his treachery, his selfishness,
  and yet in this last moment he could look on him only as a heroic gentleman.
  On this scaffold in the midst of the waiting crowd he lived again the days in
  the hot weather, the fury of the lost battle, and the whole tale of his
  undoing; and always for a centre was the figure of this man with whom all his
  toils had been shared. It was a quivering hand that took Lovat's wrinkled
  palm, and his lips were drawn to a thin line.</p>

  <p>"And you, Francie," said the old lord, "what shall I say to you? You have
  been more than a son to me, and, O lad, I wish you had been Master o' Lovat,
  and we two would have set a different face upon the business. You have the
  blessing of an auld man, my dear lad, and may you live long and die happy and
  be kindly treated as you have been kind to me."</p>

  <p>And then with great deliberation he turned to the block, and looking over
  the throng uttered the wellworn line, the last in the mouth of the
  hopeless,&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse"><i>"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."</i></p>

  <p class="footnote">[*It is sweet and seemly to die for one's country.
  &mdash;Horace, <i>Odes</i>, III.2.13.]</p><br>

  <p>The next moment he had kneeled down, and ere Francis could look clearly
  the axe had fallen, and the head lay in the basket.</p>

  <p>As, with brain in a ferment and eyes hot with unshed tears, he staggered
  from the platform, he heard in the hushed silence the voice of the headsman
  crying, "This is the head of a traitor!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">With head lowered like a mad animal, Francis pushed his way
  through the choking streets. Some turned to stare at him, but his speed was
  so great that he left no time for more than a glance. A great impulse was on
  him to run to the ends of the earth till the madness of his physical strength
  and burning heart should be quelled. He comprehended the joys of battle; he
  would have gloried in that hour to stand with his back to the wall against a
  multitude. One insulted citizen gripped him by the arm as if to demand some
  apology for jostling; but before he knew the man was sitting in the gutter
  and Francis was many yards down the street. And all the while there was the
  cold of rain about him and a wind which blew grateful on his forehead. He was
  going out into the cold earth, kinless, purposeless; yet a man who had once
  lived and dared.</p>

  <p>When he came to his lodging, he found Margaret sunk motionless in a chair
  in her outdoor clothes, her eyes fixed vacantly on the leaping fire. She rose
  quickly with burning cheeks at his entrance.</p>

  <p>"Oh, tell me all! I saw nothing save the horrid deed. How did my lord bear
  himself to the end?"</p>

  <p>Then Francis told her the whole tale, marvelling the while at his
  excitement. His voice rose high ere he had done, and with unconscious art he
  pictured the old lion in the midst of the crowd dying with a brave word on
  his lips. He told of the last greetings and the message to his kinsfolk. And
  all the while Margaret stood twining her hands, tears shining in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"It was great, it was the death of a hero. Oh, God send we all show as
  brave a face to death. My heart has been bursting with rage all day, Francis,
  and yet I am half crazy with joy. We have not failed, though the Cause is
  lost and the Prince an exile, for we have shown a poor-spirited people how
  gentlemen may die. I shall pray ever for the soul of the Lord Lovat and the
  true men who have fallen. <i>Dona &aelig;ternam quietem, Domine</i>," and as the
  soft Latin fell from her lips, her wearied nerves failed her, and she fled
  sobbing like a child.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br>
  The Temptation of Mr. Francis.</h2>

  <p class="first">That night there was little sleep for Francis. The figures
  and deeds of the day formed a long procession through his brain. He felt
  again in all their acuteness the emotions which had branded his soul. The
  truth is that the man was tired to death, what with physical labour and the
  more wearing toil of spirit. He was no more the sober, passionless man who
  had carried the message to Lovat in the North, but a tempest-tossed,
  sorely-battered creature who had been strung to a pitch of high excitement,
  and was now sinking to a dull recoil.</p>

  <p>But when he got some quiet from such vain dreaming, he set himself to
  shape out the future. It stretched grey and level before him, featureless,
  even now irrevocable. There was but one thing for him to do. For the last
  year he had been striving desperately to virtue. Now he must return to the
  writer's office and his old evil reputation. He must go back to Dysart and
  settle there as the sober man of law, and try to work out for himself a
  position of respect. There must be no more quixotry, no thought of mad capers
  in wars over sea. He must shape out his salvation in the place he had been
  called to, and settle to a life of loneliness cut off for ever from the
  past.</p>

  <p>The thought was bleak, but he never wavered, for the man had true steel
  and fire in his soul, and had the daring to face an age of melancholy and
  routine, and he too in years but at the threshold of life. There seemed even
  something grimly humourous in it all. That he who had been a firebrand, all
  but an outlaw, should go back to the common task, was an irony for the gods
  to laugh at.</p>

  <p>But this outlook of his own was but a little matter; there remained the
  graver question of the woman whose path fate had joined with his. He had seen
  how day by day her eyes sought his with a growing confusion; even in his
  blindness he had felt that this lady had come to regard all things as less
  than a word of his mouth. He stood to her as a hero, girt with the purple and
  fine gold of her fancy; he was the embodied Cause for which she had striven;
  and now at the turning of the ways there must come a day of reckoning. Her
  love was his for the accepting,&mdash;she the great lady, with that delicate
  beauty and that marvellous spirit; and for a second his heart beat
  exultantly. But the thought was banished, scarcely even with regret. For this
  man had outgrown temptation, and now this subtlest of all failed to touch
  him. He had but to join his life with hers, to go abroad and push his
  fortunes aided by her abundant wealth; it was a dazzling career which gleamed
  in the avenues of the future. Yet the renunciation cost him little, for with
  all his fire his nature was cold to the commoner human affections. He was
  returning to the vulgarity of home; and always in his mind would remain the
  image of the woman he had once toiled for. But to be with her always, to
  bring her into the glare of common day and the pettiness of household
  life,&mdash;he had no heart for such degradation. In his soul he knew that
  each was better apart, living for the other's memory, fighting the hard
  battle with the other's name on the lips. But for aught else he was cold and
  careless; for his nature was capable of all the heroical virtues, but unfit
  for the little moralities. He was ever in revolt from the domestic, the
  eternal wanderer in the ways of the world. He had no care for ease or settled
  delights, he must be ever up and following the old hopeless, goalless path,
  even though it led through grey and dreary years.</p>

  <p>Lady Manorwater alone came to breakfast the next morning. He had always
  been a little in fear of this austere virginal woman who carried devotion
  writ on her face. She had an air of the monastic which seemed strange to the
  prosaic Francis. But now she talked gravely and kindlily.</p>

  <p>"It is now time for my cousin Margaret to make up her mind, Mr.
  Birkenshaw. I have tried to induce her to bide with me, but she cannot bear
  the thought of this land longer and declares she must go abroad. She is of my
  religion, but I have never tried to influence her plans. But she declares for
  a convent now. She would devote her life to God after the many sorrows she
  has faced in this world; and I have not tried to persuade her otherwise, for
  it would give her the days of rest which only He can give to the weary."</p>

  <p>"Where would she go?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have already thought of that. I once knew the Abbess well at the little
  convent of St. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se by Arras. For my sake she would gladly receive the
  poor lass and tend her like a mother. It will vex me sorely to part with
  Margaret, but I cannot grudge her to God. And she will be happy if they can
  be happy who dwell in quiet and purity."</p>

  <p>"And I too must be going," said Francis.</p>

  <p>"And where?" said Lady Manorwater.</p>

  <p>"I go North again, back to my own people."</p>

  <p>"But why?" she said. "You are young and stirring. Is there not a better
  field for you than that sad and bloodstained land? A word, and I can get you
  service abroad, and then you would find a chance for a man's work."</p>

  <p>"It cannot be," said Francis, resolutely. "I thank your ladyship, but I
  have some faults to amend and some restitution to make before I can be at
  peace with myself. Forbye I am but a pedestrian nature after all, and cannot
  easily get old things out of my mind. I must bide in my own land, for I
  cannot flee from myself, and to go to the foreign wars would be to try to
  forget a sore heart in the hurry of battle."</p>

  <p>Later in the forenoon a servant brought him word that her mistress wished
  to speak with him. He found her in the library, where above the fireplace the
  three lions' heads of Manorwater were cut deep in the oak. She was standing
  by the window, and her face seemed pale above her dark gown.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Francis," she said. "I was so weary with yesterday that I
  was late of rising this morning. Our work is over now, my friend, so we can
  take a rest."</p>

  <p>"I have heard of your plans," he said. "Your cousin has told me that you
  go to France to a convent. And I too am about to go, so it is time for
  good-byes."</p>

  <p>She bit her lips at the words, and her voice had a quaver. "These months
  have tired me so that I longed for quiet to think and remember. Now that my
  work is done and all that I have lived for made hopeless, you cannot wonder
  that I wish for peace."</p>

  <p>Francis listened with bowed head. "You can do no wrong, Margaret," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"And you?" she said suddenly; "what will you do?"</p>

  <p>"I go back to where I came from."</p>

  <p>"Oh, never," she cried. "It cannot be, it is too hideous and cruel. You
  might hew your way to fortune wherever you pleased. There is always need of a
  strong man all over the earth, and you are strong and sure."</p>

  <p>He did not speak, but the words were bitter to him,&mdash;the very
  quintessence of gall in his parting.</p>

  <p>Then she turned round till she looked full in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You cannot mean it?" she said. "Ah, mercy! we have shared too many hopes
  together, we cannot part thus and go each our way into the bleak unknown. I
  was never fit for a life of piety, and you are too strong for a narrow fate.
  Oh, take me, Francis, and let us go away together. I am too noble a woman for
  God, it is a sacrifice which the Blessed Virgin herself could not bear to
  look upon. I know that I am speaking of sin, but what matters sin if we both
  can share it? Why, we might yet change the woful fate of this land if we
  worked together."</p>

  <p>In a deep-set mirror on the wall she caught a glimpse of her face.</p>

  <p>"See, dear," she said, "I am near as tall as you," and she smiled
  tremulously. "We are a handsome pair, and we will yet make great men bow to
  us." And she laid her cheek on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You are not angry with me?" she cried. "I know I am wicked, but I cannot
  help it. I cannot part from you, and what are old foolish ties to a woman's
  love? O my love, take me and let us face fortune hand in hand."</p>

  <p>Francis held her wrists very gently and looked into the deeps of her
  marvellous eyes. His heart never wavered, but in his soul he felt a great
  tenderness towards this beautiful, loving woman.</p>

  <p>"Nay, dear," he said, "you know better than I that this cannot be. Long
  ago you gave me a hand to raise me out of the mire, and I cannot have you be
  false to yourself. Be sure that I shall ever have you in my mind as the best
  and bravest woman God ever made. But we have each our own ways to take, and
  one cannot fight the battle better by beginning it with a foolish step.
  Marriage and love are for the peaceable settled folk, but you and I are not
  of their order. For good or ill we are on the open road of life, and we
  cannot turn back or aside."</p>

  <p>Margaret covered her face with her hands when he let her go, and her bosom
  heaved with sobbing. Then she lay back in a deep chair with closed
  eyelids.</p>

  <p>"I am so weary," she said, "and, oh, I am so foolish. You are right,
  Francis, and God forgive me for my weakness. But we cannot forget each other,
  and there in that foreign place my thoughts will always be of you and the
  lost days. It is near the time for farewells, dear. Kiss me, that I may have
  something to remember, for I am sure that no other woman's lips will ever
  touch you."</p>

  <p>With bursting heart he leaned over her, and for an instant the long white
  arms were about his neck. Then she let him go, and he stumbled from the room,
  a mere plaything of emotions.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">That evening the house was unwontedly gay, for some few
  Jacobite gentlemen had been bidden to supper, and the friends of the
  Manorwaters had come to bid good-byes before the journey into France. After
  the fashion of the broken party they allowed no sign of melancholy to appear,
  and the scene was as gay as if the time had been happy alike for all. Francis
  was in no mood for any meeting with others, but he could not in grace refuse
  to appear. In a little he was glad, for it comforted him to see how the end
  of the drama was played with spirit. As he watched the brave sight he felt
  how little a thing is failure in act if the heart be unbroken.</p>

  <p>But the vision of Margaret fairly surprised him. She had dressed herself
  in her gayest gown, putting on her old jewels which had lain untouched for
  months. Like a girl at the dawning of life she moved among the guests,
  cheerful, witty, incomparably fresh and lovely. Once again she was the
  <i>grande dame</i> who had guided the Prince's councils and the honest
  gentlemen who stood for his Cause. For a second, he felt an overpowering,
  jealous craving for this woman, a repugnance to the greyness of his lot. And
  then it passed, and he could look on her and be thankful for this final
  spirit. It was the last brave flickering of life before the ageless quiet of
  her destiny.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br>
  A Long Leave-Taking.</h2>

  <p class="first">The way lay over grassy ridges of hill and then at intervals
  among the bracken and gnarled boles of a great wood. The mist of the morning
  lay in all the far distances, and one might guess that behind the veil lay a
  wild and tangled land, that the slope did not stop a little beyond the edge
  of the haze but rose sheer into precipitous crags. It might have been
  Scotland, and as the coach rumbled down the highway Margaret when she looked
  to right and left saw a glimpse of a landscape now for ever lost to her.</p>

  <p>To Francis, who rode as before at her side, the same sentiment kept
  recurring. It was the air and look of a northern glen, here in this soft
  English south country. He noted Margaret's abstraction.</p>

  <p>"I am looking my last at a sight I love dearly," she said. "Oh, is not
  that cold, misty place like the kind country I have left? I can almost smell
  the heather and the old fragrance of the fir-wood at Broughton. You are
  happy, Francis, in your lot, for you will always be at home, and sleep at the
  end among kindly folk."</p>

  <p>Slowly the land changed till by the afternoon they were on the seaward
  slopes and caught afar the long sweep of waters. In front rose the spires of
  the little fishing town whence they were to sail, and on the red roofs the
  evening light fell in a burning haze.</p>

  <p>Amid the bustle of departure on the quay Margaret was left unnoticed. She
  stood apart, under the weather-worn sea-wall, looking wistfully to the maze
  of waters.</p>

  <p>"There is a text from the Scriptures running in my head," she said. "Some
  one of the prophets wrote it. It is, 'Weep not for the dead neither bemoan
  her; but weep sore for her that goeth away, for she shall return no more nor
  see her native country.' My life is ended, Francis, for all my joy has
  perished."</p>

  <p>"Nay, my dear lady," he said, with something rising in his throat, "you
  will have many happy days, and you will forget old sorrows. These last years
  have been but a little confusion of moorland wars, fought in the wind and
  rain by a poor people. You will soon cease to think of them and wonder at
  your present grief."</p>

  <p>"Do you think so?" she said sadly. "I fear it will be very different with
  me. It is not the way of our exiles to forget easily. Nay, rather they fight
  all their battles with the old words in their heart, and at the last, why, as
  my song says, they 'fall, and dying have mind of sweet Argos.'"</p>

  <p>Then she turned abruptly.</p>

  <p>"How long will you take to be back in the North?"</p>

  <p>"A matter of weeks," he said, "for it will be done on foot. I am a poor
  man once more, and shall sell my horse before I start."</p>

  <p>"And what will you do then?"</p>

  <p>"Seek a place in Mr. Shillinglaw's office and give my mind to my
  work."</p>

  <p>"And after that?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I shall grow old, like all men, and wander about the doors. Then
  death will come with a kindly face and I shall bid good-bye to the
  world&mdash;perchance to find a better."</p>

  <p>She smiled as if at the moment she saw the whole comic littleness of
  life.</p>

  <p>"Our ways are not so different. After the colours the sober grey, for you
  as well as for me, Francis."</p>

  <p>Lady Manorwater was already aboard, and Margaret followed. The cables were
  slipped, and soon with a creaking of cordage and a flapping of canvas the
  vessel stood out from the quay. Slowly the faces grew less, till a mere blur
  of white marked where Margaret stood by the ship's side. A kerchief fluttered
  for a moment and he answered, and then only a speck remained in the circle of
  sea.</p>

  <p>He stood at the far end of the quay, one foot on a broken stone, watching
  the sails melt into the evening. The salt fresh smell of the air was growing
  rawer with the advent of night; the once shimmering waters were sobbing below
  the piles; and afar to east and west a leaden dulness crept over the waves.
  But to the south there was still a track of light, and suddenly, clear and
  sharp, rose the vessel's outline against the rising dusk. In a second it was
  no more, and over the whole sky was rolled the curtain of evening.</p>

  <p>But the man sat still till the last light had gone and the mist came up
  from the sea.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br>
  In the Nature of a Postscript.</h2>

  <p class="first">The patient scribe who has chronicled this tale has employed
  his leisure in seeking for further news of the two who figure chiefly. Nor
  has his zeal been unrewarded. Among the Manorwater family-papers he had
  access to the letters of that Countess of Manorwater who when left a young
  widow married the Duke of Sanctamund, and cut something of a figure in the
  Regency days. Her ladyship was famous for her wit and her odd prettiness. She
  was of the school of Sensibility, and, it is recorded, made pilgrimages to
  the grave of Rousseau. She was famed too in polite circles in Paris in the
  early days after the Terror, and through her kinship to the De Noailles
  claimed all the virtues of the old r&eacute;gime. But in the midst of her gossipy
  epistles there is one little letter in which she tells her dear friend, Emily
  Norton, of a visit to Arras and an hour spent in the graveyard of the convent
  of St. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">". . . Yesterday, ma ch&egrave;re, was a heavenly day, blue with
  white clouds sailing above, and all the place was green with the tender
  spring of this climate. I found the graveyard, which is hidden away among
  cloistral grey walls, but kept trim by the piety of the Sisters. After much
  searching I came on a little stone, much grown about with white roses, and on
  it the simple letter M, and the words, '<i>Pro sua patria</i>.' It was indeed
  the tomb of my unfortunate kinswoman. I confess, my dear Emily, that I could
  not look on it without a tear. Here in this green place lay my brave
  Margaret&mdash;<i>la Marguerite des Marguerites</i>&mdash;whose name as a
  little girl I used to worship. People say she went far from the paths of
  virtue, that she used her beauty and her talents unscrupulously for a foolish
  cause, but I cannot believe it. Here the memory of her gentleness and
  goodness is still fresh, and the old sisters have much to tell of <i>la belle
  &Eacute;cossaise</i>. Well-a-day, we cannot judge; at any rate she has got peace;
  and I confess I wept to think that even in her death she remembered her own
  land and asked that the white Jacobite rose might be set above her grave....
  I fear I can write no more at present. The emotions of the day have
  discomposed me, and I go to bed. In three days we return to England, and till
  then with eternal love believe me your ever-affectionate</p>

  <p class="quote">"<span class="smcap">Victoria Manorwater</span>."</p><br>

  <p>On the other hand the writer has searched the excellent series of
  monographs on the Fife burghs for traces of Mr. Francis. There he was
  unsuccessful, but in a series of papers contributed by a former provost of
  Dysart to that most enterprising sheet, "The Fife Journal and Herald of the
  Kingdom," and composed from the town papers, he has found something of
  interest.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">". . . In our list of talented townsmen of a former time,
  none should be more highly esteemed than Francis Birkenshaw, who succeeded
  John Henryson as Provost of the burgh. He was a writer, having succeeded to
  the business of Gregor Shillinglaw (for whom see last number). There were
  always queer stories in the town anent him, for he was a wild lad in his
  youth and disappeared unaccountably during the Rebellion, returning much
  graver and wiser, which gave colour to a belief that he had seen service with
  one or the other side. Nevertheless, he soon acquired a responsible position
  in the place, and as head of a flourishing business, was elected Provost in
  the year 1765. He introduced many reforms, particularly a system of town
  pumps where the burgesses could get clear water, their former source having
  been invaded by the sea. His portrait hangs in the Town-house, and shows a
  grey-haired, hard-faced man, with cold, unfriendly-looking eyes. This indeed
  seems to have been his character, for he rarely graced the social board, but
  lived unmarried and utterly by himself, finding all his interest in his work
  and the town-affairs. He died at the early age of fifty-two, leaving the
  business to his head-clerk, and his fortune&mdash;which was
  considerable&mdash;to the burgh."</p>
