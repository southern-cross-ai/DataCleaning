<h3>A. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<br>
<p>Daniel Southwell left England, with the First Fleet, in H.M.S.
Sirius, in the capacity of midshipman, but prior to sailing had
passed the examination necessary to qualify him for a
lieutenancy. After leaving the Cape, he was promoted to a vacancy
caused by one of the mates of the Sirius (Mr. Sealey) remaining
behind at Rio de Janeiro. He continued on the Sirius until the
end of February, 1790, when, apparently much against his
inclination, he was ordered to take charge of the look-out
station on South Head, while the Sirius and Supply were absent at
Norfolk Island. It was on this voyage that the Sirius was
wrecked. Southwell appears to have remained at the look-out
station until ordered home with the crew of the Sirius in the
Dutch snow Waaksamheyd. Vol. i. part 2. pp. 466 and 475.</p>
<p>The journal and letters, now published for the first time, are
preserved in MS. form in the British Museum. The journal and the
major part of the letters are in Southwell's own handwriting. A
few of the latter are copies&mdash;in the handwriting of his
uncle, the Rev. Weeden Butler, of Chelsea, to whom many of them
were addressed. The papers are printed in the form of an Appendix
on account of their non-official character, and also because they
belong to a period anterior in date to that to which this volume
properly belongs, viz., 1792-5. Several lacun&aelig; occur; in
some instances it is impossible to fill them; in others, the
missing words or letters are obvious, and have been inserted in
brackets [ ]. Copies of some of the letters, taken by the Rev. W.
Butler, have been of service in supplying defects in the
originals.</p>
<p>Attached to the original correspondence is the following note,
unsigned, and in an unknown hand:&mdash;"Daniel Southwell
belong'd to the Ocean 6 months, from May till Nov'r 13th, from
which time till the 20th of March, 1782, he belonged to ye
Monkey, cutter, under the command of Lieut't Glasford, formerly
1st Lieut't of ye Ocean; then from ye 20th Nov. till 2nd of
October, 1782, he belong'd to the Perseus (A.B.); from thence to
the Orpheus (A.B.) till 10th Jan'y, '83; then to ye Aurora (Mid.)
till 12th May, when p'd off and put out of commission; was with
Capt'n Dacres in ye three last-mention'd ships; in the Aurora was
rated midshipman during the time I belonged to her." From
Southwell's petition to the Admiralty, dated May, 1792, post, p.
&mdash;&mdash;, it is evident that the year in which he joined
the Ocean was 1780. No information in regard to his movements
after his return to England is available, except an entry in the
Admiralty books of his promotion to the rank of lieutenant, 11th
February, 1794.</p>

<h3>B. THE JOURNAL.</h3>
<br>
<p>[<small>NOTE</small>.&mdash;The opening pages of the Journal,
in which the voyage from England is chronicled, and also a number
of entries of later date, are omitted, partly on account of the
space they would require, but principally because the same
information is given in a better form in the letters which follow
on pp. 668 to 732.]</p>
<p align="center">H.M.S. Sirius, Botany Bay.</p>
<p>1788, Jan'y 20th.&mdash;At &mdash; p't 7 let go the b't bower
in &mdash; f. &mdash; Found riding here H.M. brigg Supply (Capt.
A. Phillip, Lieut. Ball, commander); also the Alexander,
Scarborough, Friendship, who, as formerly mention'd, when off the
Cape G'd Hope, parted company under the command of G.A.P.,* who
left the Sirius to proceed on in the Supply for the sooner
arriving at B.B., and the better forwarding the service of
establishing the intend'd settlement at this place.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Governor Arthur Phillip.]</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>Hoisted all the boats out, and sent one on shore to cut grass
for the cattle. Unbent the storm miz. and main staysail, unslung
l. yard, hook'd top tackels, unstow'd the booms to get at some
spars for diff't purposes. Emp'd getting forehold clear for w'r**
boat on shore. The inhab's are often seen on the coast, and are
not as shy as might be expected.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Water-boat.]</p>
<p>21st, P.M.&mdash;Got the sheet anchor over the side and all
clear for letting go. Officers and party of men on shore seek'g a
good water'g-place. A b't return'd with grass and some water. At
sunset down t. g. y'd.</p>
<p>21st.&mdash;Boat emp'd on shore for water and other occasions.
People on b'd emp'd in the hold getting cases of saws, hatchetts,
bill-hooks, scythes, and other necess'y implements to hand. The
comander and officers surveying the neighbouring part of the
coast, called Broken Bay; the party have taken 3 days' provisons,
some tents, &amp;c., &amp;c. Emp'd making seine-poles and getting
the fishing geer to hold.</p>
<p>22nd.&mdash;Boats on shore for water. Emp'd on board getting
up empty casks. Sent a party on shore, and haul'd the seine. An
officer and some men away felling trees and searching for good
water. Overhaul'g the store-room. Airing stores of var's kind
that are in need of it. A.M.&mdash;At 4 sent a party to haul the
seine. Boat on shore upon the above services. Loosed sails to
dry.</p>
<p>23rd.&mdash;M'derate and fine w'r. P.M.&mdash;Furled sails.
People on b'd repairing the seine, airing the stores, &amp;c.
Block the t. g. y'ds. Boats on shore on the duties above
mention'd.</p>
<p>24th, P.M.&mdash;Fine clear w'r. People emp'd on the usual
duties. This day finish a saw-pit, and at 7 p.m. the shore
parties were advis'd to desist from these operations, to bring
away all the t[imber], and to repair on b'd. At 4 p.m. we were
order'd on shore to break up the pit and bring away the principal
frame timber of it, and I carred them on b'd the Supply; this in
consequence of a much better harbour being discov'd about
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; miles to the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, being
in many respects ju'g'd more eligible by the Commodore, who, with
C.H.,*** &amp;c., examined it during the 3 days they had been
absent. While on these dutys I had opportunity of observing that
the country was woody. Tho' the soil is sandy, not very deep, it
lay immead'ly upon a bed of rock, and they appear in many parts
of the country, and here and there rise to a good height even
when far from the seaside. There were several miserable huts
along the seaside, and at no dist. from the landing-place. They
were wholly destitute of furniture, and had had fires in or near
them lately. There were sev'ral fish hanging on the branches of
some of the thick trees, wich seem'd to have been there a
considerable time. They were of a sort unknown to us.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Captain Hunter.]</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>The natives of B.* Bay are of the middle size; they have much
beard on the face, with grow far out on the cheek-bone, so as to
near the eye. Their women are seldom seen; indeed, we have reason
to think they were dispatch'd away into the c'ntry on our first
app'g on ye coast.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Botany Bay.]</p>
<p>The features of this people are by no means pleasing; they go
perfectly naked, but by some gestures which pass'd between us and
them on that h'd they did not seem to be ignorant of the prop'y
of our decorum, for one of them readily made the itended use of
the flap of an old jackett that was given him, and another sailed
into the bushes, and shortly return'd from the thicket, furnish'd
with a rural imitation of his comrade's finery, with this
difference, that his had the most pleasing effect, and cou'd
claim the honor of the longest invention. They seldom appear in
numbers exceeding 20 or 30, but once or twice 50 at least were in
a company, but at a good dist'e. The shore everywhere by the
seaside are plentifully covered with the shells of g't variety,
particularly oyster, and many of them very large. Most of them
have evidently been clear'd of their contents by the natives,
who, we judge, procure them by diving, or some better method than
we have got, for those within our reach are of a paltry size, but
when got near low-water mark are very well-tasted and of a good
quality. This place affords much fish. The land seem destitute of
animal (quad's). There are many birds, such as paroquetts,
cockattoos, a species of a black bird, and many whose name we are
not accquainted with.   *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>The moskitos are very troublesome, and insects of almost every
kind are here in g't number. The large ant, both black and brown,
when they attack us give g't pain, tho' of no long duration, and
is not attend'd with so tedious an itching as the bite of the
small one occasion, who are almost as much to be fear'd as the
muskitos.</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>At the spot where we are emp'd clearing away the trees from
the ground is a stream of good water, which makes its way in to
the bay just by the place where we land, a short &frac12;-mile
from P't Solander. A small pit was likewise dug by some of our
people, and it soon fill'd; but the stream was prefer'd because
the other did not run, but remain'd at something below the
surface of the pit or hole, which, however, tho' much was taken
out, still seemed to be supplied.</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>There seems to be little in vegitable way fit for food, and no
fruit upon the place but a kind of berries, wich may perhaps be
good at some season, but what we have venterd to taste are not
very agreable; there are, however, g't variety of trees, shrubs,
plants, and other kind of vegitation, and we doubt not when
better accquainted with the country useful and comfortable
articles of diet may be obtained. We may form some judgement of
the quality of the soil by the immense quantity of wood it
produces.</p>
<p>The lances of these people generaly termin'e in 4 prongs, each
pointed with something that appears much like a fishes tooth.
They are fast'ned in with gum, and each prong is nearly 2 foot in
length and cem'ted strongly with gum, and bound with some fibre
of a plant near the place where they begin to divide from the
main handle or long p't of the lance. Another sort of these
weapons they have with only one point, but in other respects the
same as the above. The first sort we think is chiefly used in
striking fish, which is, indeed, a principle part of their
subsistance; the latter their war-lances, and barbed with a tooth
in a contrary direction. Some of these, however, are jagged with
many in a very curious and destructive manner. They have targets
of an oval form of sufficient sise to cover the whole body; they
daub them over with some white kind of colouring, and frequently
ornament it with a cross of red, the points of which terminate in
the circumference. At some distance these look very well, and
exhibit some appearance of design.</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>Wednes'y, Feb. 5-6.&mdash;This day 2 of the natives app'd in
the camp without testifying any mistrust or indeed curiosity, and
tho' they cou'd not have came there inadvertently, yet the
novelty of such a scene seem'd in a g't measure to pass unnoticed
by them, tho' p't of their behaviour would set aside the
appearance of any particular motive that might induce them to pay
a visit which was somewhat extra, as till now the inhabitants had
ever since our arrival at P't Jack'n kept at so g't a distance as
never to be seen but by our boats when empl'd in the survey of
harb'r by C.H. (Captain Hunter) and the 1st lieut., or when
hauling the seine, which is usually done at 2 leagues from the
ship.</p>
<p>There is something odd in their never being seen but in small
[numbers], except by accident, tho' there is every reason to
suppose they are numerous. Since our arrival at Port Jackson,
during a survey of the harb'r, a body of near a hundred were seen
drawn up with an unexpected degree of regularity, having
something the app'ce of discipline; and on this occasion, tho'
they did not altogether seem intent on mischief, their behaviour
was in some respects irritable and capricious, which, however,
a[re] qualities common to the savage. 'Tis true they may not be
capable of much policy, hut time may shew whether our settling on
the coast did not in some manner alarm them, or at least engage
their attention.</p>
<p>Feb'y 7.&mdash;This day the commission for the Gov'r,
Lieut't-G'r, &amp;c., &amp;c., were read in public on [a] place
for a parade near the camp, in the hearing of the principle
officers, both navy, marines, and shore establish't. The convicts
were placed in a proper situation by themselves, and certain
officers and others were station'd nigh them to keep order.
Immeadiatly as the commiss's were opened and everything rightly
disposed for the occasion, the convicts were commanded to sit
down, and the marines discharde their pieces over them 3 times.
By this posture, I presume, was prescribed them as being suited
to their situations as criminals. It also enabled them the better
to hear and see what was about to be done. C. Collins,
Judge-Advocate, then began with reading the Gov'r's commiss., by
which he (Gov'r) was furnish'd with g't and full powers. After
the commissions were read, the laws for capital cases laid down,
and a jury named, consisting of navy, marine, and civil offic'r,
3 voll'y were again fired and silence command'd. The Gover'r
add'd the criminal p't of the audience in the foll'g
purpose:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You have now been particularly inform'd of the nature of the
laws by which you are to be gov'd, and also of the power with
which I am invested to put them into full execution. There are
amongst you, I am willing to believe, some who are not perfect'y
abandon'd, and who, I hope and trust, will make the intend'd use
of the g't indulgence and lenity their humane country has
offer'd; but at the same time there are many, I am sorry to add,
by far the great'r p't, who are inate villains and people of the
m. abandon'd principles. To punish these shall be my constant
care, and in this duty I ever will be indefatigable, however
distress'g it may be to my feelings. Not to do so would be a
piece of the m't cruel injustice to those who, as being the m't
worthy, I have first nam'd; for shou'd I continue to pass by y'r
enormity with an iljudged and ill-bestowed lenity, the
consequence would be, to preserve the peace and safety of the
settl't, some of the more deserving of you must suffer with the
rest, who might otherways have shewn thems's orderly and useful
members of our community. Therefore you have my sacred word of
honor that whenever ye commit a fault you shall be punish'd, and
m't severely. Lenity has been tried; to give it further trial
would be vain. I am no stranger to the use you make of every
indulgence. I speak of what comes under my particular
observation; and again I add that a vigorous ex'n of the law
(whatever it may cost my feeling) shall follow closely upon the
heels of every offender."</p>
<p>After some other words tending to this effect, they had
liberty to disperse, and Gov. after pass'd up and down thro' the
diff't company of marines upon the parade, and being saluted by
them with the due honors, he, together with the principle
officers, went to partake of a cold repast that had been
purposely prep'd at the marquee. During all the ceremony at
intervals the band played, and "God Save the King" was perform'd
after the commis's were read.</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>May 27th, 1788.&mdash;Having been on shore to hear the tryal
of 2 of our men for an assault made upon a 3'd while residing on
Garden Island, on coming from the court I saw M. Ross'es
gamekeeper, or rather game-catcher, bring in the largest congaroo
[kangaroo] yet taken. This was, indeed, the first I have seen
complete. However, he was dead, and had been shot about 2 leagues
from the h'd-quarters. [<i>Here follows a lengthy description of
the kangaroo.</i>]</p>
<p>At Port Jackson they are very shy and hard to be got at,
frequently rendring the repeated efforts of the vigilant
sportsman vain an[d] abhortive. The congaroo that was bro't in on
this day weighed 96 pounds.</p>
<p>[<i>Here follows a retrospective entry in which the voyage
from the Cape of Good Hope, and all events up to the arrival of
La Perouse at Botany Bay, are described.</i>]:&mdash;Soon after
these anch'd, we got under way and sail'd for P't J[ackson]. It
must be obs'd that [the] Gov'r had push'd out the day before in
the Supply, but this, tho' easily, done by a single ship, was not
adviseable for the whole convoy of merchant ships, with every
circumstance in their favor. However, the w'r being fine and a
good breeze, they all turn'd out very well, and by &mdash;
o'clock they were clear of the bay and standing after us. We soon
after had sight of the harbour, and at four were well within the
heads that form the entrance, and in the ev'g we all came too in
cove, where the Supply was riding, and which is now known by the
name of Sydney Cove. 'Tho the party who had made the prior visit
to this place were so warm in their praises as to draw upon
themselve the charge of exaggeration, it must be acknowledged
they did no more than justice to its merits as a harbour. 'Tis
perfectly landlock'd, has sev'ral capital arms, and is furnish'd
in every p't with more coves, where whole fleets may lay
perfectly landlock'd and in g't safety; indeed nothing can be
conceived more picturesque than the app'e of the country while
running up this extra[ordinary] harbour. The land on all sides is
high, and cover'd with an exuber'n of trees; towards the water,
craggy rocks and vast declivity are everywhere to be seen. The
scene is beautifully height'ed by a number of small islands that
are dispers'd here and there, on which may be seen charm'g seats,
superb buildings, the grand ruins of stately edifices, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.,* which as we pass'd were visible, but at intervals the
view being pr'ty agreably interrupted by the intervention of some
proud eminence, or lost in the labyrynth of the inchanting glens
that so abound in this fascinating scenery. 'Tis greatly to be
wish'd these appearances were not so delusive as in reality they
are. If blest with fertility, thanks to the goodness of the
climate, the soil generally speaking is not to be said much for;
however, the more we penetrate the better it appears, and well
inland there are some good spots of tolerable ext'n. The soil
nigh the sea is at best but indiff't, and noth'g can be more
strange than to see so much vegitation, and that of the larger
sort, on a soil that one would think cou'd hardly afford
nutriment for underwood.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Southwell, at this part of his narrative,
inserted the word "vista" between the lines.]</p>
<p>We meet with no thing that is deserving of the name of fruit,
and its quad's are scarcely to be classed above vermin. There are
no rivers of water, and we are indebted to the frequent rain that
supply the little runs that furnish us with this article. Not to
dwell too long on worst side, let us take another better view, as
it affords upon inspection and exp'e. The above is chiefly con'd
to this place, where the settlement is fixed, not but that thro'
industry it now wears some app' of cultivation, and every day
furnishes some new discovery or species of intelligence that
raises our opinion of the land, 'tho our Canaan flow not with
milk and honey. Thus, we find many salutary herbs that make
wholesome drink, and of g't use to our sick. Balm is here in
plenty, and sev'ral vegitables have been lately found that are of
the same kind, tho' not so good, as at home. Here is spinach,
parsley, a sort of b'd beans, sev'ral wholesome unknown
vegitables. Many of the productions of the country are aromatic,
and have medicinal virtues, and it yields a variety of things
proper for foementa and other exteral application; a sort of
green berries, that are pronoun'ed a m't excell't antiscorbutick,
are gathered in abundance, and a specie of sorrel, &amp;c., all
of a peculiar fine acid. By those who have gone far inland we
learn that g't spots of ground of tolera[ble] extent are to [be]
met with, and the trees growing at the dist. of fourty or fifty
yards from one another. Their largest quad, is [the] kangooroo;
in add'n to these are oppussum, w. rats, called so on acc't of
the shorness of their forelegs, a kind of rackoon,
flying-squirrel, flying-fox.</p>
<p>There are also large snakes, two y'ds and a half long,
beautifully chequer'd, with a variety of colours, and scaled all
over.</p>
<p>Most or the quad's of this place are handy with their paw, and
'tho not to be pronounced of the monkey kind, are monk'h in their
manners; and were it not that we meet with no regular gent of
that class, sho'd suspect there was a dist. grad'n as links in
the chain which naturallists affirm is insensibly continued from
one order to another. 'Tis seen that this obtains not only with
the beasts, but among the paroquet is a leading genus, as is also
the shark among the fish. Each in their kind furnish some
charactstic to a g't variety of species more or less general or
partial, 'tho each is perhaps essentially diff't from the perfect
or leading genus.</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>We have vast variety of fish, but the shark is here to be
discerned to take lead not only in power but in many variation[s]
of genus.</p>
<p>No country can boast a more charming race of winged inhabit's.
The paroquet is seen to take a lead among these, for there seem
to be an endless variety of them; indeed, those in other p'ts,
from the acct. of our m't expd. voyagers, can in no wise vie with
the variegated, lively, and brilliant plumage of these beautiful
birds.</p>

<p>1789, May 24th.&mdash;This day 2 of the natives passing by in
their cano's a nearer dist. than usual, we made signs to invite
them on b'd, and which by degress they did, but in a wary and
undetermin'd mann'r, sometimes laying on they oars and drifting
with the tide; then, pulling slowly, they would alternately
incline the h'd of the canoes towards and from the ship. On their
near approach they gave a few of as complacent glances as their
uncouth vizages cou'd allow of, mixed, however, with an appear.
of stifled apprehension and a something supplycating, with now
and then a forced laugh and an look of astonishment at all they
saw, under which 'twas easy to see they were still attentive to
observe our gesture and proceedings. However, at length, fully
satisfy'd we meant them no hurt, they came alongs side and held
on by a rope we gave them; the holding out some worthless shreds
of cloth, pieces of parper, and such nonsense, no do[ubt]
control'd them to us. They were most supprized at seeing a little
girl of 12 mo. old, which one of the gents held out. Only one
perceiv'd this at first, but shortly made the other accquai'ed
with it by the loudest confounded gutteral roaring that can be
imagined. They also saw the mother of it (the first white woman I
suppose they ever saw), which occasion'd a 2d peal, in which one
would have thought they were certain'y proving their lung, to
jud'e of their quality and powers, as they do all the guns at
Woolwrich, by such an extra charge as might reason'y be expected
to burst them if not of the first qual'y.</p>

<p align="right">19th May, 1787.   </p>
<p><small>WITH</small> much pleasure, my d. mother, do I embrace
this expected opportunity of letting you know how we are
situated, and how we come on. When I wrote you my last,* in which
I mentioned we were unmooring, we actually did get under way, but
from some untoward delay among the transport ships, were obliged
to drop our anchor again. However, on the next day (Sunday) we
weigh'd at 3 o'clock in morning, and have constantly since then
been encreasing our distance from beloved Old England; but I am
happy to say, on my own part, in rare spirits, and with the
sincerest and oft-repeated self-congratulations that my
destination is now effectually and happily determined. Thrice
happy am I, my dear mother, much for your sake and satisfaction,
to assure ye that from the time of my coming on b'd till now I
have been recov'ring in a manner that has much surpass'd the
warmest expectations I cou'd entertain, and that (set aside the
peculiarity of my habit, which do, and, indeed, will, in all
probability, remain for a time) I might safely tell you I am
well. I have to add that on coming on b'd, after so long a
cessation from duty, I thought it would look better not to sue
for any indulgence in that respect, and, indeed, was so much
mended that there was no very g't merit to me on that acc't.
Accordingly, I kept the deck, and acted in my station, but for
very few hours, for we had hardly got the anchors up before the
Governor told me by no means to keep watch or to expose myself to
the w'r till I found myself fully recovered in health and
strength, for he cou'd perceive I was much reduced and very
different from when he saw me in town. This was very kind and
considerate, and I made my best acknowledgements; and as I really
thought a few nights' recess would ensure the matter and
compleate my health, I told him I would make use of the
indulgence for a few nights, but he most obligingly told me to
lay by both day and night till I felt myself perfectly well, and
that I need only come on deck when I thought I might derive
advantage from air and exercise. Following day I dined with him,
and he behaved with the greatest affability, and those kind
little attentions as to what I eat, and what he thought good for
me, &amp;c. He frequently asks me how I do, and has desired me to
want for nothing that he has on b'd, and to send to his steward
for it without ceremony, for that anything he has is quite at my
service, and he shou'd be happy it would do me good. I am the
more particular on this head, as I know it will be of a pleasing
savour to y'r affect'e solicitude for my welfare&mdash;indeed, he
is very kind to all, and we are very happy in our worthy
commander. For all this I am very thankful, for tho' my disorder
is not eradicated, yet my present good situation affords a happy
prospect of once again enjoying good health in its former
fulness. We have had prosperous gales, tho' latterally rather of
the freshest, and are going on prosperously. The ship has now a
very g't deal of motion, but she rolls very easy, has many good
properties, and is what we call an excellent sea-boat. Tho' not
exactly in the Bay of Biscay, we are tumbling about in its swell,
and many a good sailor sea-sick; but notwithstanding 'tis pretty
well four years since I was at sea in any weather, I only find it
rather set a keen edge to my appetite. I have received no letter
from you since I emb'k'd, tho' I judge you might have wrote one:
that is, this will be the 3d since the last I had of you. I took
the opportunity of writing to d. un. R'd after dropping our
anchor, owing to the delay, and am very happy I at last paid the
long intended tribute due to his kind's and affection just as we
sail'd. I received a l'r from my d'r Jane, and wrote to dear
Betsy, and pray give my best love to both. Till yesterday I did
not know how much I am indebted to Cousin D. Dawes and Mr. Harper
for their kind mention of me to the purser of our ship, Mr.
Palmer, when it came out in accidental discourse. Pray make my
love and best returns to both, with love to all their family. My
best resp's to Mrs. Lane, who has kindly assured me she shou'd
always be glad to hear of our wel-doing; indeed, I consider
myself under the greatest obligation to her friendship for a
situation in every respects m't eligible in its nature, and
rendered doubly so in the worthy d'r [director] of it, who takes
pleasure in adding to the happiness of those about him.</p>
<p>May 20.&mdash;I call'd the opportunity expected because
uncert. when the Hyena* would part co. with us; however, I have
just been told she goes from us to-night, so shall conclude this
now. Pray remember me to my ever good friends at Chelsea. Little
Dan's ship is one of the best sailers, and frequently alongside
of us. I nod and wave to him at times, and he seems brisk and
hearty. One opportunity I had of enquiring after him since we
sail'd, and sent him by the same a present from our Dr. E.
Timbrel, which came to my hand with a variety of others for
myself.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Hyena was the man-of-war which escorted
the fleet out of the Channel.]</p>
<p>Please to commend my best wishes to all friends, and never be
uneasy a moment for me, but rather congratulate me on my good
fortune in this destination, which is highly agreeable to me in
many respects, and may be advantageous, for I rely on the
Governor's good offices; and now with wishing you every good wish
and best love to all my dear brothers and sisters, believe me
ever, my dearest mother, your very affectionate and dutiful
son,</p>

<p><small>I AM</small> again happy, my dear mother, in having
another opportunity of writing. The circumstance is lucky, for we
did but arrive here last night, and the packett is to sail
to-morrow for England. We have had a tolerable good run, and a
very pleasant one, and are all well and healthy on b'd; and,
indeed, throuought the fleet. For my own part, I can asure [you]
that I now have a prospect of wearing thro' my destination with
comfort and satisfaction, a matter render'd the more truly
pleasing as I cou'd not, even in spight of hope, but have my
doubts of, nor does my worthy captain abate anything of his
kindness&mdash;indeed, owing more to his indulgent injunction
than to any real indisposition, I have not as yet entered upon
regular duty, but am to do so upon my own application [as] soon
as we leave this port, which is intended after a week's stay, for
he is so very good as to desire me repeatedly not to keep the
deck till a perfect reinstatement is compleated. I judge from
your tender anxiety, on account of my health, how grateful this
will be to ye, and I prize the opportunity more on this account
than any other, for all I could say in regard to duty and love
you would be sure I should entertain. The Governor is certainly
one of a thousand, and is very considerate in every thing, and
extraordinary clever in every contrivance and method to render
the ship healthy and airy. The new scene is vastly pleasing and
agreeable to my turn, for here the natives of the place come off
in boats, and bring on b'd a variety of fruits and other articles
to <i>us</i> before unknown; and then the land is so mountainous,
or rather hugely rocky and cloven in the most surprizing manner.
As yet I have not fed my curiosity with a sight of the famous
Pick or Peak, for that since our arrival has been constantly
envelop'd in the clouds. This puts me in mind of the picture
which used to be over the parlour mantle, by us term'd the Peak,
tho' by the by I think erroniously, for I believe 'twas meant the
representation of an Egyptian Pyramid.</p>
<p>As yet I have not been on shore, but mean to see the place
tomorrow. The town is not regular, but appears well to look at.
The houses are generaly white-fronted and regular in themselves,
but stragling in their situation. The w'r, to us who have always
lain farther northward, is very warm. It agrees with me extreamly
well, and I begin to like our trip more and more. 'Tis very
pleasing to see new places, and this voyage promises much
variety. Shou'd I see the place before I send this, I may tell
you more about it; if not, you'll stay till I come back. I am no
g't hand at description, but still these little particulars will
from <i>me</i> be acceptable. I could allmost tell you all before
I go that perhaps I may crack a bottle of Teneriff (which is not
so strong as pleasant; 'tis with us sailors the staple commodity,
and is very cheap), and look at a church or two and walk about
the town. We made the Island of Madeira in our way, but did not
touch there. I just mention by way of letting you know how we
stand on b'd, and to avoid being more sanguine than is altogether
consistent, that there are several <i>potent recommendations</i>
in our ship, whom modesty obliges me to rank as before me on the
road to success. At all events, advantage may be received by it,
and to be easy concerning these matters is better than to be
disappointed. All I have to do is to be attentive and make the
most of it, and I have everything I believe to trust in C.P.'s
[Captain Phillip's] inclination to serve me. I must add that I
know of no one situation in the marine line I would take in
preference to this; and I will not doubt but that Providence may
in his leadings give me according to my merits and deserts. The
name of the chief town is Santa Cruz, and the people, being
Spanish, speak a lingo of which I must understand it before I
presume to judge. However, the novelty of the scene is
entertaining, such as the comical gestures and vain attempts they
make use of to be understood, joined to the sea-jokes, &amp;c.,
that the tars play off among them. The mountains are stupendous,
and the Peak is computed much above 2 miles in perpendicular
hight. As we were coming along the shore towards the harbour, we
perceived a number of goats playing upon the eminences; and
before we had got in and come to an anchor the captain of the
fort came off in his boat, and we learn'd they had expect'd us a
long time. We did not salute, as is usual, as we wished to go on
a &oelig;conimical plan; and it happen'd apropos, for the chief
occasion of this officer's coming on b'd was to inform us that
their guns at the fort were dismounted, and consequently cou'd
not have return'd bur salute. Little Dan Butler is very well, and
I have sent to him to come on b'd. However, I must mention only
to you that I find by one of our gents, who came good part of the
v[oyage] in the P[rince of] W[ales], that his situation is not
altogether as he represented it, for h[e is] quite the servant
and bang'd about (I think) by the mate, so I propose going on b'd
to say as much as is consistent, if, on enquiry, I find it is not
wholly my kinsman's fault, which may be the case, for we are all
apt to judge partially, and his being in the most perfect
dishabille seems to militate against him. The youn' gent I
mention has an uncle on b'd the P.W., to whom I recom'd D.B. most
earnestly, and he is a good character and a principle officer on
the B.B. establishment, and I promise some good may come of it;
and his nephew, my brother-officer, on b'd has bound himself to
give him a nudge every now and then upon Dan's behalf. The
gentleman's name is Alt, and has the place of Surveyor-General of
New Holland. I suppose you received my last by the Hy&aelig;na,
and I promise you I'll write wh'ever I can. So far, we have gone
on happily and well; and I pray God's blessing on ye all, which
concludes me with best love to d'r brother and s's my much
honour'd mother, your truly affectionate son,</p>

<p class="foot">[* Should be September. The fleet did not arrive
at Rio until 6th August. See Vol. i, part 2, p. 114.]</p>
<p>Honoured Sir,</p>
<p>I feel an heartfelt satisfaction in having a conven't
opportunity when so far off to forward my duty'l and affectionate
best wishes to yourself and much-loved family; the chance is
truly acceptable, but would [not] have offer'd itself perhaps had
not some of our well-respected shipmates been necessitated to
return on account of their several indispositions.* From this
circumstance I derive a reflection which is indeed pleasing to
myself, and may be agreable to you. Your friendship and
affectionate inclinations for my service, at a time when you
cou'd not fully advise, undoubtedly led you to place things in
such a point of view that it remain'd with me to consider and
make the decision. On this occasion I eyed the ballance with as
much of that steady attention you enjoined, as I was capable of;
and if I felt an influence in that situation which savor'd as
much of duty as of freewill in the attention paid by me to it, I
must say I am well satisfied with my determination. Indeed, I
think I have been very fortunate, for tho' much indisposed at
coming on board, I met with great indulgence. My captain**
allow'd, or rather commanded, me to lay by during the passage to
Teneriff, and was in other respects very good. From that time to
the present my health has been daily encresing, and the warm
climates agree with me very well. We left the above place the
10th of June, after a week's stay, and arrived at Rio Janeiro on
July 6th,*** all safe and in good case, having had a very
pleasant passage. This is a Portuguese settlement; is situated on
the continent of South America. Its chief produce is rum, sugar,
and wine: is very fruitful, and seems a place of g't importance.
It is governed by a Viceroy, whose powers are great; he lives in
splendor, and does not go abroad but with g't attendance. The
military here are well dis'plined; their dress has a martial
appearance; their horses are good and well-train'd, and they have
many mules. Oxen are chiefly used for burthen, but the beef of
this country bears no comparison with that of England. The blacks
are very numerous, and many of them are slaves. The streets are
laid out with tolerable regularity, and the appearance of the
houses uniform; 'stead of windows they have lattice-work, which
is here well suited to the climate. Their churches are richly
ornamented, and some truly splendid. The convents and nunneries
are many in number, and the paintings generally on religious
subjects are full of expression, and frequently very superb.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Vol. i, part 2, p. 115.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Governor Phillip.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** An error. The fleet arrived at Rio on 6th
August. Vol. i, part 2, p. 114.]</p>
<p>Oranges are in vast abundance; and a great variety of fruit,
with whose names I am unacquainted, are in plenty. This place
sends much gold and precious stones to the mother country; they
are produced in the inland parts. The people are affable, and all
ranks very polite among themselves, but particularly so to
strangers. They are partial to the English, but their dislike to
the Spaniards so great that they can't bear to hear them named.
The land is very high and mountainous and cover'd with wood, but
the trees are generally small.</p>
<p>The place where the shipping lay is very commodious and safe.
From morning till evening the weather is very warm, and in summer
must be almost insupportable was it not for the sea-breezes,
which are very refreshing, and set in with much regularity. 'Tis
now the winter season, but even in the night hardly to be call'd
cool. The days are hot, and the natives themselves feel it so,
consequently the winter at this place is trifling. The next port
we touch at is the Cape of Good Hope, and from thence we are to
proceed to Botany Bay. The passage to the former may be five or
six weeks, and the run from the Cape to the place of our
destination we judge will take three months. We came in here for
refreshment, and we are now nearly compleated. We get fresh beef
every day, and vegitables are plenty. Wine, rum, and rice are the
principal articles our fleet have taken in; of these we have
received a great quantity, for which they have bills upon
Government. Indeed, our supplys had need be capital, for our
party is large, and where we go there is none to be got; and what
we have must last long. The convicts are more tractable than
might be expected; when they are not, discipline is not
neglected. The Commodore's conduct has endear'd him to most of
them, and, indeed, I believe few could have been found better
calculated for the occasion than our commander. He is a man who
has seen much of the service and much of the world, and has
studied it. He is possess'd of g't good sense, well inform'd,
indefatigable upon service, is humane, and at the same time
spirited and resolute; for of his courage, fame allows him to
have given honorable proofs on former occasions.</p>
<p>I may tell by way of information that our squadron consists of
the Sirius, a brig* wearing a pendant and commanded by a
lieutenant, and eight transports, the major part of which have
convicts, the rest merely stores and provisions for the proposed
settlement. At sea Dan Butler had been very ill, but is now quite
well, and has been on b'd to see me. I have let him know of this
opportunity of writing, and he is to send his letters on board
whenever they are ready. I see him frequently one way or other;
he grows fast, and is a fine lad. His captain is a worthy man,
and I believe my kinsman may do very well.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Note in the MS.:</i>&mdash;"Called the
Supply".]</p>
<p>All I can do at present is to hope and trust you are all well;
my prayers are for it, and one day I may be satisfied in this
particular. There will, I dare say, be some opportunity
hereafter, and I can promise myself this satisfaction at your
hand.</p>
<p>Cou'd I point out any particular or immeadiate prospect of
advantage to myself I would, knowing how much you interest
yourself in my well-doing; but at present all I can say to it is,
that there are one or two who I fancy may reasonably expect to
preceed me if promotion takes place. However, much of this is not
likely, and it seems there are other ways of serving us, and I
firmly believe he has genuine inclinations to do so whenever he
can*; and as I have heard him observe that at all events if we
return unprovided for, this voyage will constitute a
recommendation indeed in a manner amounting to a claim.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The reference is evidently to Governor
Phillip.]</p>
<p>We expect to proceed in three days, and as the time to send my
letters is arrived you may take it for granted my best duty to my
dear aunt and love to cousins, with earnest wishes for your good
health and theirs, concludes this. In good hope to see you all
happy and well when we return,</p>

<p align="right">Table Bay, Cape of Good Hope,         <br>
11th November, 1787.   </p>
<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>We are still lucky you perceive in having opportunitys of
letting you hear from us, and happy in embracing them, and the
more so as we are to inform you of our continuing to go on
successfully.</p>
<p>We left Rio de Janeiro on the 5th day of Sept'r, nearly as was
expected. Have had no very bad and a good deal of good weather,
so there is no reason to complain of our passage, which was
indeed a fine one, and tolerably expeditious, considering we had
to keep company with a convoy of vessels, and that tho' some sail
but indifferently we must not leave them behind.</p>
<p>The fleet have been much more healthy than one cou'd
reasonably expect. There are but few deaths and several births,
and many more of these, it is presum'd, are soon to take place;
so you see we are altogether in a thriving way. This, as the last
port we touch at in our way to the new settlement, has been a
time of constant bustle; indeed it is right to take every
advantage of it, for the leaving behind any of the many articles
that are requisite and necessary would be now irreparable; this
has therefore kept us constantly employ'd in getting the ships
supply'd with water and all the species of provision that are
proper. Grain of various kinds, some for immediate consumption,
some for sowing, &amp;c.: much will be necessary for the use of
the live stock: these are to consist of cows, bullocks, sheep,
hogs, horses, and almost every domestick animal, and the quantity
of water they will require is so great that we are to make the
best of being at an allowance for ourselves. However, from these
inconveniences we promise future advantages, and those who cannot
combat with the former shou'd not have shaped their course for
Botany Bay. Were you to take a view of our ship below you would
be apt to take it for a livery stable of note, for there are a
number of partitions all along the between decks, and racks for
the provender; nor do we want pig sties, hog troughts, and all
the necessary apparatus. Among the stock are many of the
feathered kind, and also plants of various sorts. These all
together will take up much room, and the ship is lumber'd. The
people, considering the number, are much crouded, for the cattle
are to occupy a deck which till now was theirs. This is a
disagreeable part of it, but we hope to get over it without much
sickness; some must be expected. The voyage, it is thought, may
be reckon'd at near three months, which, as we are situated, will
most likely be trying to many of the passengers. For my own part,
I can eat my allowance with ease, and have continued to maintain
a place in the cook's list, which is better, you'll say, than
being in the doctor's report; while I go on so there is little
fear of me, and I have every reasonable presumption for it, as
these climates seem very friendly to my constitution.</p>
<p>Thus far you see things have succeeded beyond expectation, and
so we shall proceed with double satisfaction, trusting to a well
compleating of our undertaking.</p>
<p>There is hardly a day but I am ashore on duty, and by that
means have been able to make none but general remarks. The place
belongs to the Dutch, is under a Governor. The people dress much
like the English. Their houses are very neat, and adapted to the
climate, which is warm. There seems to be something of the
Chinese taste in their building, which I suppose is owing to
their particular connection with India and all that quarter.</p>
<p>There is plenty of most things that are necessary, but the
inhabitants seem to make a markett of it; for all things are very
dear, washing by no means reasonable, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The beef and mutton are very good, the latter particularly so.
The sheep of this place are famous for their having enormously
large tails, weighing from 12 to 20 pounds, being entirely fat.
Of these they make good advantage, for 'tis far preferabble to
butter in the making of pastry and for frying fish, &amp;c. They
have here, as in most foreign places, many slaves, and the white
people in general are oppulent and keep up a genteel appearance.
Allmost all have a smatt'ring of English, and many of them speak
it well.</p>
<p>The Ranger, E.I. Company's packett, Capt'n Buchannon, has just
arrived, but only two officers in the fleet got letters; she left
the Motherbank two months after we did.</p>
<p>I hope my next will be more agreable than this, for in that we
shall have something new to talk about, but how soon I may,
cannot now say, or by what method of conveyance; and I can fully
rely on receiving a favour from you by the first chance that can
be met with. Indeed, a good letter from home wou'd be a most
grateful treat, and I know you too well to doubt of it when in
your power to forward one. At present I view the thing at such a
distance that I scarce allow myself to think of it; but let's
hope 'twill read the better when it comes. I expect much news,
but I must not anticipate; may it contain the agreable accounts
of your well doing, and that will be all I wish. Pray give my
best love to d'r Jane when you see her; the rest of the
much-loved lads and lasses will have it immeadiately you
know!</p>
<p>We arrived here the 14th of October, and expect to leave it
about the 12th instant, but I will date as late as possible.</p>
<p>Now to particularize all those friends whom I hold in the
kindest remembrance would be both formal and tedious; you may
safely asure them they are faithfully thought of and mentioned
too if you think 'twill do them good, and there is no fear of
being dettected; 'twill only be a white one, and excusable with
those who may be so good as to feel disappointed without; 'tis
very good of me, you'll say, to furnish you with these provisos,
which may after all be unnecessary, but the lad means well enough
too!</p>
<p>Cousin Dan Butler still continues well; tells me his captain
is a good man and behaves kindly, which makes his situation
agreable to him. He begs his duty and love to you all. I have had
the pleasure to see him sev'ral times on b'd the Sirius since our
arrival, and he frequent'y comes alongside in their boat as one
of the crew, and is quite a clever little tar.</p>
<p>The Commod're is still the same good man, and it is whisper'd,
and I believe with some probability, that I am to be rated one of
the mates of the ship in room of Mr. Sealey, who left us at R. de
Janeiro. It has not been authenticated to me from his own mouth
as yet, and it seldom is for a good while, at least 'till the
books are made up; but it will be known for certain when he comes
on b'd, which will not be till the day we sail. However, shou'd
this not happen I shall not feel myself hurt or disappointed, for
there are sev'ral on b'd who may possibly have better pretentions
to it. I know I can rely on his will to serve me at every proper
opening, and that is a satisfaction. Mr. Miller sends you his
best respects. I intend writing to Unc. Butler, Mrs. Everitt, and
Mrs. Lane. The Comm'd'e ask'd me a few days since if I had
written to the two latter. We are to sail very shortly, so must
conclude with asuring you I am, d'r mother,</p>

<p align="center">DANIEL SOUTHWELL TO MRS. SOUTHWELL.</p>
<p align="right">H.M.S. Sirius, Sidney Cove, Port Jackson, 5th
May, 1788.   </p>
<p><small>THESE</small> presents, my dear and much honour'd
mother, come greeting from your ever dutiful son, with the most
affect'e best wishes to yourself, my much loved brothers and
sisters, near relations, and kind remembrance of all particular
friends, and others my acquaintance in general.</p>
<p>This premised, I proceed to inform you, and by that means them
(for by this conveyance I write to none other), that we left the
Cape of Good Hope on the 13th Nov'r, 1787, and were plagued for
some time with perverse currents and contrary winds; this,
however, was not of long continuance, and what next occurs
material is that on the 25th do. the Governor left the Sirius, at
sea, and re-embarked on b'd the Supply brig, for the purpose of
arriving at the intended settlement with greater expedition, and
preparing for the remain'g part of the convoys better reception.
She then parted company, and took three more with her, viz., the
Alexander, Scarborough, and Friendship.</p>
<p>Our passage from this time was by no means to be complain'd
of, and we then stood on with good success under the command of
our 2d. Capt'n (Hunter), with the remain'g ships all in good
order and spirits, in the hope of again meeting all together at
the destined haven. Many things occur'd of course during the long
run from hence to the Cape of New South Wales,* such as seeing
vast numbers of great whales, as is usual with those that go down
to the sea in ships; also other strange fish of astonishing size
and strength; also as curious birds at great dist'e from any
land, seaweed pass'd by, and a variety of things that the plan of
this letter won't admit a detail of. The above-mentioned South
Cape was made at 2 o'clock on the 8th of January, p.m., much as
was expected by the reckonings, but the lunar observations were
and all the voyage have been accurate to an astonishing nicety,
and reflect much credit on the abilities of Captain Hunter, Mr.
Bradly, and Lieut. Dawes of the marines. From this part, likewise
call'd Van Dieman's Land, we stretched away for Botany Bay, the
place of rendesvous, and lost sight of it in two days. Soon after
this we luff'd up in a hard squall, and shook it out, as we term
it, but were in luck that it did not shake or blow all the sails
from the y'ds or the masts over the side; 'twas some time before
we could take the canvass in, and being of long continuance it
press'd her down in good faith to her best bearings, and she
look'd for some time as tho' she did not mean to right. Our ship
perhaps was a little crank; however, we sustained but trifling
damage. Some of the convoy split their topsails, some their
courses, and some both; other were seen with staysails blown
away. Our m. staysail was the only thing of consequence that gave
way, and it we recover'd, tho' something the worse for wear and
tare. Cousin Dan's ship, P. Wales, among other things, lost a man
from the main yard,** and the sail split to ribbands. The
merchantmen, as is their usual way, wore round or put before it;
but we, as I said, shook it out, or, in other words, presented
her ship's head to the wind; 'tis a point much contested among
seamen which is best. I have only to say we had the best of the
breeze this time. Capt. Hunter, who is a very clever and
experienc'd officer, gave good reason for this management, and
his opinion where each method becomes eligible, but as you are
not much of a sailor, tho' well enough in your own way, and a
very good mother, I shall not here adduce them.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Note in MS.:</i>&mdash;"South Cape of New
Holland; vide Vandieman's Land."]</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Note in MS.:</i>&mdash;"This accident
belongs to another day." See the extract from the logbook of the
Prince of Wales, ante, p. 405.]</p>
<p>On Jan'y 19th, 6 a.m., we again made land, bearing W. by N, In
the even'g, having kept the shore on b'd, had sight of the
desired port, and could have got in had we been by ourselves, but
the convoy, whom we were obliged to stay by, detain'd us, so we
stood off and on during the whole pleasant moonshiny night, and
in the morn'g we all got in, and to our satisfaction found the
Sup'ly and the other three ships all in good order.</p>
<p>Soon after our arrival we haul'd the seine and caught a
quant'y of fish, which was a comfortable change. This diet is now
very usual with us, and being partial to it I do not yet grow
tired, tho' many do. Indeed, I impute the full establishment of
my true health in part to it. You positively did not see me so
stout and robust at any time while last at home; for this I am
truly thankful, and by a continuance of the blessing I hope to
see you a better man than ever you knew me, and trust with God's
good will that we shall not in this or other respects have cause
to repent of the determination that cost all parties so much ere
'twas fixed. I often consider my dear good uncle Butler as a
chosen instrument on the occasion. During the short stay we made
here there was much timber fallen and a sawpit sunk, but the
Governor, who with some of the principal officers had been with a
party of men and sev'ral boats on a three days' expedition,
return'd with the agreable news that they had accomplish'd the
intended object&mdash;that of finding some more eligible place
for a settlement and shipping. This was on the 24th Jan'y, and a
stop was put to further operations on shore. The frame of the
sawpit was taken up, and being a thing of special use and much
trouble to form, sent on b'd the Supply, who proceeded the first
opportun'y to the new port. About this time, to our g't surprise,
we saw two strange sail in the offing plying to windward to gain
the harbour. However, a current that set them bodily to ye
south'd, together with contrary wind and being baffl'd with
calms, kept them from coming in till the 26th. We sent our boat
on b'd; they proved the Boussoile and Astrolabe; the command'g
officer, Mons'r De La Perouse; 2d in comm'd, Mons'r Cleonard, of
the last-mention'd, came on b'd, and we learn'd that when at
Kamskatka* the former capt'n, Mons'r De Langle, together with a
whole boat's crew and most of the officers of the ship, were
massacrer'd by the savage inhabitants of that inhospitable coast.
Soon after these anchor'd we weigh'd for Port Jackson, and came
to there the same evening with the convoy in as snug a place as
London river. 'Tis about 10 miles to the n'd of B'y Bay, and
nothing can be conceived more picturesque than the appearance of
the country while running up this extraordinary harbour. The land
on all sides is high, and cover'd with an exuberance of trees;
toward the water craggy rocks and wonderful declivities are
everywhere to be seen. A no. of small islands that are dispersed
here and there add much to the piece, some lying in the middle of
the streamed, and channels for ships on either side, and, altho'
extremely rocky, cover'd with trees, most of which are evergreen.
The white sides of the stony eminencies, with very little help
from fancy, have at distance the app'e of grand seats, superb
palaces, and sumptuous pavilions. The natives, too, form'd a pt
in the 'scape, for some of them had posted themselves on the
overhanging cliffs here and there, as thou' to dispute our
passage up, brandish'd their lances with a variety of anticks
more like monkies than warriors. Indeed, their chattering, thou'
something more sonorous, put one in mind of those gents. We run
them up nigh 2 leagues, and came to a place call 'd Sidney Cove.
Here the settlement is fixed, and the place wears some app'e of
cultivation. The soil near the sea is at best but midriff, and
nothing can be more strange than to see so much vegetation, and
that of the largest sort, on a soil that one would think scarcely
aforded nutriment for underwood.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This is an error; the massacre occurred not at
Kamtchatka, but at Maouna, one of the Navigator Isles. In modern
maps the island is given its native name&mdash;"Tutuila". The
circumstances of the massacre are narrated at length in
P&eacute;rouse's <i>Voyage Round the World</i>, vol. ii, pp.
128-148.]</p>
<p>It yields no vegitable for which we have a kitchen name, but
there are sev'ral green things we make use of that are not
unwholesome, and in eating endeav'r to think them better than
they are. 'Tis extraordinary that no good fruit or that might be
made so by management is here. Some berries of the lowest order,
bastard figs, and such, are now and then to be met with. Indeed,
thus the coast in general appears, and you may travel from Dan to
Beersheeba "and cry, 'tis all barren". In the excursions they now
and then make into the country they find, however, that the trees
are farther apart, and here and there some tolerably good spots
compared to that where we are fixed; so it had need, but still
'tis nothing compar'd to the arable pasture of our own dear
shore. There is much gard'ning set on foot, and, as might be
expected, some things come up well, some indiff., and some not at
all. Yams** succeed among the best, and are an excellent
substitute for potatoes. 'Twill be long ere any g't benefit
accrues from these labours, except to individuals. The largest
quad'e yet seen is the congaroo, being the size of a large dog.
There are vast numbers and variety of birds, but they, too, are
hard to be got at. When we do we eat both these and the former;
"all is fish that comes into the net". The place is tolerably off
for water, but 'tis procured with difficulty, being rather drains
than springs, and we seem indebted to the rains for them. The
best run yet seen was at Broken Bay, about 20 miles from where
the Gov'r, &amp;c., examin'd a good harbour, and a fall of water
that had something the appearance of a cascade, but a dry season
would no doubt greatly impair this mimick. Ligh'g is here
violent, and soon after our coming seven sheep and a hog were
roasted alive by it; and much as a fresh meal might be desired, I
can venture to asert that no one took a single joint to his
table. This happen'd in the middle of the camp, but these unhappy
animals were the only people hurt. In all this time only two men
have been hang'd, tho' sev'ral have been condem'd, and many
deserv'd it.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Note in the MS.:</i>&mdash;"Yams' reign of
short continuance; they dropped off suddenly after."]</p>
<p>Lieut. King, our 2d. officer, was despatched soon after our
arrival to fix a settlement at Norfolk Island, some few days'
sail from hence, for the purpose chiefly of rearing hemp and
flax,* and which 'tis said will succeed here, and is an object of
consequence. He is in qualy. of Governor. He has with him some of
inferior rank, and a party of men and women. They sail'd in the
King's tender Supply, and in their way discovered a new island,
which Lieut. Ball, the command'r of her, call'd in honor of the
First Lord of the Admty., Ld. Howe's Id.** They did not touch at
it in their way, but on their return from the colony at New
Norfolk they did; 'tis small, has much tall timber, and is a fine
place, having many birds so tame as to be caught by hand; but,
above all, they turned and secured several turtle, which are here
in abundance, and bro't in sufficient to give most of us a good
meal; so you perceive we lived (I don't say live) like aldermen;
nor was it any of your mock, sham work. She, the Supply, is
expected to sail very soon with the ships*** by which I send you
this. The Charlotte is the one I write by, the Scarborough and
Lady Penrhynn are the other two, so we look for another supply of
this delicious article. This charming island is estimated at
&frac12; way between here and Norfolk; how providential that it
is not twice as far t'other side of it!</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Note in the MS.:</i>&mdash;"The latter
only, I believe".]</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Note in the MS.:</i>&mdash;"And in and
about it are Ball's Pyramid, Mount Ligdberd, and Mount Gower,
&amp;c., &amp;c."]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>Note in the MS.:</i>&mdash;"Viz.,
Charlotte and Lady Penrhyn".]</p>
<p>The natives are not fond of coming nigh our place of abode,
and yet we have frequent intercourse with them when on the diff't
excursions, and also by the boats which go at some distance to
fish. Their manner of living is very rude, and their language is
most uncouth to the ear. They are chearfull, nor is their
disposition unfriendly, but extremely fickle and irritable; they
are very incurious, and it takes much to engage their attention,
or, more properly, to fix it. Their chief employ is to fish.</p>
<p>'Tis perfectly uncertain when we set sail, but 'tis expected
when we do 'twill be among the Is. Otahieta, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
and those islands as mention'd in Cook. The Governor was so good
as to rate me mate, as soon as the former one quitted the ship at
R. de Jan'o, and, accordingly, I do duty as such; this brings
with it some addition to my income, being &pound;2 0s. 0d. pr.
mt., before &pound;1 9s. 6d. This is, I am satisfy'd, as much as
the situation of things allow of; and I believe him to be much my
friend, thro' the warm instances of those others whom we so much
love and respect; and I am happy in never having given him
dissatisfaction; but on this I claim no g't merit, as he casts
none off who maintain the least pretensions to his favor. 'Tis
possible you in England will best know how things can be sent out
here; and, if it shou'd come easily in your way, some materials
for making six pr. shoes, some very plain second cloth, for
making a working-jacket, and two or three dozen small bell mids.
buttons, one pair of blue duffel trowsers, two coarse hatts,
round, six pr. coarse thread, and four pr. of worsted stockings
would be usefull; this is, however, left to you, with a full
assurance that, if not done, I shall make the best of it
cheafuly, and be contented. It remains now to tell you that this
is not considered as a full letter, but only sent for fear of
accidents. The Alexander is the ship that carries home the
dispatches, and in every probability she will be home before this
letter, for, when she sails, which will be in two m't's, she will
make all speed for home. Now, the Charlotte goes to China, and
this letter is what we seafaring folk call a preventer.* This is
the apology you will please to make to all my correspond's in
case this first comes to hand; tho' I shou'd expect those I write
by the Alexd'r will be the first received by them and you. Mr.
Miller, being wholly a resident on shore, I seldom see him, but
can assure you of his good wishes. To hear from you would be
highly agreable, and we flatter ourselves that letters are on the
way. In this all are thought of, they may believe me, tho' few
are mention'd. Cuz. D.B. is a fine, good lad, and, if he behaves
well, may, perhaps, bear ye a l[etter] from me when he sails,
which will be with the Alex'r, &amp;c. So, with earnest good
wishes, and praying God's blessing to you all, I am, d'r much
loved and ever honor'd mother,</p>

<p><small>IN</small> the morning we all run into B. Bay
(20/1/88), and to our satisfaction found the Supply and the three
ships lying there all in excellent condition. It was about 7
o'clock in the day when, having entered the port, the locks were
taken off the scuttle butts and free license given for all to
drink as much water as they liked, and it was odd to see the
people soon after washing their worst garments in a profusion of
that liquid which they often had wished for in vain to moisten a
mouth parch'd with the irritating effects of a salt diet and a
sultry climate.</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>What I have formerly express'd concerning our good command's
abilities for his station cou'd be little more than opinion. He
has, however, fully veryfied all, for the proof is now present,
and his conduct, join'd to the most indefatigable attention to
such a vast variety of avocations, is truly to be admired.</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;In case this only shou'd come to hand, I will just
mention a few more particulars. The principal disorder we suffer
by here is the fever and flux, jointly. This has carried off
several; these chiefly convicts. 'Tis frequently fatal, but with
good care much oftener not so. There are various opinions about
the cause, some attributing it to the water, some to the humidity
of the ground, others to the season, others to the peculiarity of
constitution, and that either of these causes may produce it in
many, while others, equally in the way of all, continue to escape
intirely. On b'd the ships the fish diet has been suspected to
occasion it, if not timely desisted from, and this, with the
known peculiarity of my habit, may account for its salutary
effects upon my constitution. From the water too, that has ill
effects on some, I experience not the least.</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>Most of the chiefs in our colony have thatch'd houses built,
but the convicts are still mostly in tents; they are now going on
fast with building wooden barracks for the soldiers, and when
they are housed the rest will be served. By this 'tis hoped good
health may be secured, and the constitutions by that means
gradually naturalized to the climate. However, all things
consider'd, we have not been very sickly. The Governor has a
house; the frame came out in one of the ships; 'tis very compact,
and I have had the honor to make one at the table sev'ral times
with his Excellency, and that by his own friendly
invitation,&mdash;"Southwell, come and take a bit of dinner with
me. "There is plenty of stone for building, but will not be much
used 'till for the public buildings, courts, &amp;c., and this
will be a work of time. I don't imagine the plan of the town is
yet wholly made out. The attain'g a competent knowledge of the
lunar observation is a matter of the first consideration with a
naval officer, and 'tis certain there is nowhere so fine an opp.
as with us. Capt'n Hunter is a most worthy man, and ever ready to
communicate instruction; judge then how unpardonable it would be
for me to return ignorant of them! Wholly so, I am not; but I
most sensibly feel the want of the necessary books and tables for
that purpose. If there is any certain way of sending them out,
above all things do it. Let them be calculated for the ensuing
year, '89, and further on till '92 or 3. Mr. Harper, or any of
our sea acquaintances, would undertake to procure them; they
consist of necessary tables, nautical ephemeris, &amp;c. I
believe they are to be purchased in the Strand; 'tis an object of
consequence. But all this will depend, of course, on the accounts
you hear from the ships that may arrive concerning how long we
shall stay out, &amp;c. I think if you cou'd find any way of
having me recommended from home to Capt'n Hunter it would be a
good job done; he is already inclin'd to be partial to me. He's a
man devoid of stiff pride, most accomplish'd in his profession,
and, to sum up all, is a worthy man, and will be my chief when
the Gov'r is not, for you must remember that the Gov'r C.P. is
entirely on shore, and that much will now depend on C. H'r's
interist. Mr. Pike knows him (the hatter), but I cou'd wish for
some greater recommend'n than his; thro' his means you, may be,
may get one. I think my first friend, Mr. Glassford,* knows him.
A word to Uncle Butler will be more than enough (if there is no
picque between them; of this, I think, I have a faint
remembrance, but you can try). His goodness of heart, I know,
would lead him to wave that (if it subsists); but you have
penetration, and if you discern that it is so wave it, and that
at once, for 'twould be unhand'e to lay him under obligations
that would not set easy on him. I have to add that this l'r is an
extract from my principal one, and that you must not consider one
as a grating repitition of the other; 'tis done much for your
satisfaction, and if a copy from the other you must put up with
it.   Adieu.</p>

<p align="center">DANIEL SOUTHWELL TO MRS. SOUTHWELL.</p>
<p class="list"><i>Transcriber's Note</i>:&mdash;Extracts of a
copy of a letter, entitled, in volume of copies by the Rev. W.
Butler, "Copy of a Letter from my nephew, Daniel Southwell, to
his mother, dated and closed 12th July, 1788, giving his account
of Botany Bay, Sidney Cove, Port Jackson, &amp;c." (of which pp.
27-32 inclusive are blank.) Original not found.</p>
<p><small>IT</small> may be proper before we take our departure
from the Cape of Good Hope to mention something concerning the
various supplies we received there. The things we took in for
present consumption and ship use were&mdash;fresh beef, excellent
mutton, and indifferent veal, of which article they do not kill
much, vegetables of most sorts, though in no great profusion,
soft bread of a tolerable quality, and an inferior sort of Cape
wine. All the aromaticks and spices are here in plenty, and such
as chose to procure themselves these articles of private
convenience could do it at a reasonable rate. Sugar sells at a
high price, as might be expected, but they who had not fully
furnished themselves with their intended stock on leaving England
found an opportunity of compleating it when at Rio de Janeiro,
where it is in great abundance and at a moderate rate.</p>
<p>Soon after our arrival a Danish Indiaman from China came in,
and from her we procured tea, silk handkerchiefs, nankeens, etc.,
tho' at rather an advanced price considering where we were. There
were also some other ships from whence in this way, and with
coffee we were likewise supplied.</p>
<p>For the particular use of the colony were such seeds as
afforded any prospect of yielding increase, and many young plants
were taken from the ground with a reasonable presumption that
they might thrive in our soil, as our climate is nearly parallel
with theirs. In this business we were kindly assisted by Col'l
Gordon, Commander-in-Chief of the Military&mdash;a gentleman
allowed to be an ornament to his profession, possessed of a
scientifick genius, a larger share of botanical knowledge than
usually falls to the lot of those who are not professed students,
a great lover of natural history, and indefatigable in these his
favourite and laudable pursuits.</p>
<p>Mr. Mason,* the King's botanist, happened to be there, and
most willingly joined his endeavours to be of service in this
respect by furnishing some necessary hints relative to
cultivation, &amp;c. The colonel also, in addition to his former
civilities, favoured several of our gentlemen with some very
curious communications. To Mr. Dawes, who is our principal in
astronomical matters, he gave several interesting particulars
concerning a comet that he himself saw, but which was invisible
to those in Europe.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Francis Masson. See Vol. i, part 2, pp.
506, 522.]</p>
<p>With reference to the Supply, &amp;c., leaving the rest of the
fleet and sailing on ahead, 25 Nov'r, 1787, Mr. King, 2d lieut.
of the Sirius, Lieut. Dawes, of the marines, our astronomer, and
several inferior officers were also removed into the Supply, and
a number of workmen, particularly sawyers and carpenters, were
put on board. They also took the timekeeper, the same which Cook
carried round the world, with them on this occasion.</p>
<p>Several other necessary alterations took place amongst the
officers, and everything being settled, Capt'n Phillip parted
company, his little squadron consisting of the Supply, armed
tender, the Alexander, Scarborough, and Friendship, snow. It was
generally understood that the Supply was to push on with all
speed, and that the principal intention of removing Lieutenant
Shortland, the agent for transports, from the Fishbourn,
victualler, into the Alexander, was that he might follow with the
rest and keep them together. *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>There now remained three victuallers and three transports,
under the command of John Hunter, Esq., our worthy and
much-esteemed second captain in the Sirius, whose amiable conduct
made the absence of our universally beloved and respected
commander-in-chief the less to be regretted.</p>
<p align="center">After passing South Cape, 18 Jan'y,
1788:&mdash;</p>
<p>*   *   *   *   *   *   The country appeared high, broken, and
mountainous, thick with wood, which at this distance exhibited an
appearance of the most charming verdure; and though the eye only
was feasted, yet there was something satisfactory and charming in
it, as proving that we had shortened the distance towards the
place we were seeking.</p>
<p>During the night we observed great fires along the coast,
which gave rise to various opinions whether the natives had made
them for an alarm, as a protection from the attacks of wild
beasts, for the dressing of their food, or other such
purpose.</p>
<p>Were it not for the express mention which Cook makes of their
total want of curiosity, and of the little notice they took of
such extraordinary visitations, I should readily have concluded
that the appearance of seven such canoes as the Sirius and her
convoy might naturally excite their attention, if not fill them
with anxiety. However, since our further acquaintance with these
gentry, this character has been pretty well verified, and we find
it much easier to catch their attention than to fix it, for on
the first sight of any new thing they express their wonder by the
most grateing shouts and extravagant gestures, but in two minutes
after are perfectly regardless of the recent prodigy, which
childlike fickleness is, I believe, peculiar to all savages, to
all these children of nature, wherever they are met with.</p>
<p>In sight of this coast we saw a remarkable bird, mentioned in
"Cook" by the name of <i>Motacilla cyanea</i>, which is admired
for the neck and part of the head being of a beautiful yellow. It
is much the size of a gull. They hover about the water as
sea-birds do, tho' in the work above mentioned they are supposed
to reside wholly on the shore. Future observation may shew
whether they are the same he means, and, perhaps, that at certain
seasons they forsake the land, or at least frequent the water.
There was much of the small fry of fish about the ship at this
time, which we considered as an earnest of the abundance we might
expect to find near the shore of the intended settlement.</p>
<p>Vast quantities of things that appeared very bright and
luminous passed the ship in the night, so as to render the wake
of the vessel quite glittering with light. Of these we saw much
while in latitudes near the Line, and I have sometimes amused my
curiosity in catching them with a wicker basket thrown over the
stern. It seems chiefly occasioned by the little nautilus and the
sperm of fish.</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>We perceived (on entering Botany Bay, 20 January, 1788) some
of the natives on the shore, and could hear them chattering to
each other with the greatest vociferation.</p>
<p>At times they evidently directed their noise to us,
accompanied with a variety of anticks. You may conclude all hands
were upon the look-out for the Supply and the rest of the
runaways, and that it well pleased us to see them all safe in the
port before us. <i>Before</i> us they were, 'tis true, but not a
fortnight or more, as was proposed; for immediately on seeing us
an officer was dispatched to us from the Governour, with orders
to stay with us till we came to; and by him we learned that the
Supply had been in but <i>two</i> days, and the transports but
<i>one</i>. This, as they pursued a different track, may be
accounted for by their not having fallen in with such favourable
winds, and being, perhaps, impeded by currents which we stood
clear of. However, they were all, he said, in good condition, and
added that they had had some interviews with the natives.</p>
<p>As our first interview with the inhabitants took place while
at Botany Bay, I shall just give you a rough sketch, by which you
may form an idea of the nature of them in general.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Lieutenant King, who was present when this
meeting with the natives took place (Southwell was not), gives a
somewhat more detailed account. Ante, p. 539.]</p>
<p>When the Supply arrived here it was about 2 in the afternoon.
They dropp'd anchor, and at 4 the Governour, attended by several
officers, went in a boat, mann'd and armed, towards a place where
the natives still were, for on her first coming in a party of
these people had saluted them in much the same manner as they did
<i>us</i>. But, as soon as they saw the Supply was <i>gone to
sleep</i>, and did not move, they went and light a fire at no
great distance, sitting round it with as much apparent unconcern
as if nothing new had happened. However, on the near approach of
the boat they seemed somewhat disturbed, and two of them,
advancing along the beach, spoke with great eagerness and very
loud. Their manner had more of the appearance of expostulation
and earnest advice to desist from landing than of menace, and,
tho' they did not seem terrified, it was easy to discover their
<i>un</i>easiness at our persisting in the intention of coming to
the shore.</p>
<p>As to get water was a principal part of the errand, one of our
people made signs that we wanted some. This was indicated to them
by dipping a hat over the boat's side, and then putting it to the
mouth, as if drinking with avidity. They quickly caught the
meaning, and, pointing repeatedly to westward, signified that we
should steer that way. This we did, and soon discovered a small
run, which discharged itself into the sea, and upon tasting found
it good, which was expressed by our people clapping on the
stomach, and often putting it to their mouths. This was also
quickly repeated by our new acquaintance&mdash;for they are all
perfect masters in the art of mimickry&mdash;and with every shew
of satisfaction that they had been of service to us. Indeed, the
readiness they manifested upon this occasion savoured much of
fellow-feeling and humanity.</p>
<p>When our people landed, the two men before mentioned retreated
a little, and at length joined their companions, who by this time
were at no great distance. Every method taken to convince them
that our intentions were friendly for a long while proved
ineffectual, till at length the Governour himself hit upon the
following: Desiring those who were with him to keep behind, he
took with him but one person, and advanced pretty near. "When
almost close to them he delivered his arms to the man who
attended him, and then held out some baubles, intimating that if
they would come forward they should have them. This conduct gave
them confidence, but not till after much deliberation, and their
seeing that the Governour frequently waved his hand to his own
people still to retire. At length one of the oldest among them
came forth, and having likewise given his lance to a young man
who was with him, he made him retire to his own black party. He
was now but few paces from our commander, who continued by the
above-mentioned means to solicit his nearer approach; but the
sooty sage, still wary and distrustful, made very intelligent
signs that he wished those presents to be laid upon the ground.
This was immediately complied with, and the Governour, as finding
it would be agreeable, stood at a greater distance. The doubts
before entertained of our sincerity being thus in a great measure
removed, the old man ventured to advance and take up the
<i>valuables</i>, which at first he examined with great
appearance of satisfaction; but he soon, however, began, as is
the custom, to adorn himself, and hastened to rejoin his party.
This not being altogether what we wanted, his Excellency again
held out some irresistibles; and one, a little bolder than the
rest&mdash;tho' all, no doubt, were envious of their companion's
acquisitions, soon came up and expressed a desire that he might
receive a few ornaments upon the same terms with the former.
This, however, was not agreed to, and the Governour, with much
address, stole a march upon our hero, and with a deal of
complacency in his countenance presented him with several
trinkets, and whilst receiving them managed to adorn him with a
shred of scarlet cloth, to the two ends of which a tape was
fastened, so that when over the head it lay upon his breast,
somewhat like a gorget; yet very becoming, and having, in his
opinion doubtless, an extraordinary fine effect. After this more
of them ventured nigh, and received some princely present or
other. The women kept far off, which the men took good care they
should do; and tho' many signs were made, and many fine
allurements held out, they, for this and at various other
succeeding times, proved abortive. Thus much being done, our
gentlemen took leave, and repaired on board the Supply.</p>
<p>One day some of our gentlemen of the Sirius having, by their
liberalities and friendly manner, secured the good opinion of a
party of these people whom they had fallen in with, at last
prevailed on them to let one of the fair sex come nigh and
receive some finery, which, by-the-bye, was repeatedly refused to
the men, who continued to offer their services of acceptance. So
one of the party, an elderly man, satisfied, I suppose, that
decorum would be observed, and stepping a little aside, called,
in a voice of authority, to one of the ladies to come forth, upon
which, after some hesitation, a wood-nymph appeared, and 'twas in
the garb of native innocence, which as a veil it seemed had
reference only to the intellectual organs of vision.</p>
<p>It would be doing the lady an injustice not to observe that
her manner was highly expressive of embarrassment, which some,
however (beshrew their manners!), attributed to fear only, never
considering, till myself put them in mind, that her complexion
could not admit of that captivating suffusion which on similar
occasions adds such graces and so enhances the charms and many
attractions of the fair in our far-happier climes.</p>
<p>Their persons, generally speaking, are not very engaging to an
European eye; some of them, however, are fine figures, and have
faces which custom might render not wholly unpleasing, at least
to a son of Neptune. But these, how unfortunately, like the
kangaroo, are deuced shy, and we have only to live in hope that
we shall be very good friends upon longer acquaintance. The men
have much beard on the face, which grows far up the cheek so as
nearly to reach the eyes. Their features are by no means
pleasing. They live in small whigwhams, very poorly constructed.
Of these miserable habitations I have seen several; they are
chiefly near the water, for the convenience, no doubt, of
catching fish, the principal part of their subsistence. This they
manage to do with a pronged spear, pointed with the teeth of some
animal. They make better lines of the fibres of plants than might
be expected, and work nets with much regularity and neatness.</p>
<p>Their war-spears have only one point, and that curiously
jagged, so as to be very destructive. This they are seldom
without, and they have a method of throwing it with great
velocity by the help of a short stick. They are, upon the whole,
harmless and inoffensive; they are volatile, merry as beggars,
and laugh heartily at the little fooleries we practise to please
them. In some cases they have been found irritable and
capricious, which, however, are qualities common to savages. It
is more to be wondered at that where the conception is so cramped
they are not more given to revenge, for on several occasions they
have shewn themselves not altogether implacable.</p>
<p>Much care, indeed, is taken not to offend them, and they grow,
of course, more familiar every day. They one day killed two
convicts, who were cutting rushes for thatching, at several miles
off,* but 'tis hard to say, or indeed to suppose, that this was
done entirely thro' cruelty. Their behaviour, so far as it has
come under our observation, does not warrant such an opinion; but
it is true they stand much in awe of our firearms, and when not
influenced by this dread 'tis possible they may unmask.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Vol. i, part 2, pp. 148, 167, 171.]</p>
<p>[<i>After a lacuna of five pages, the copy begins again,
apparently in the midst of a description of the animals found at
Port Jackson.</i>]</p>
<p>*   *   *   *  also opossums&mdash;a kind of raccoon, flying
squirrels, flying foxes, &amp;c., &amp;c. Large snakes are
sometimes brought in, beautifully chequer'd with a variety of
colours, and scaled all over.</p>
<p>Most of the quadrupeds of this place are handy with their
paws. Though not of the monkey kind, they are monkeyish in their
manners, and were it not that we nowhere meet with any of those
gentry, I should almost suspect these to be distant
relations.</p>
<p>[<i>Transcriber's Note</i>.&mdash;Here follows a detailed
description of the kangaroo.]</p>
<p>Amongst the birds, the perroquet must be allowed to take the
lead. For beauty and plumage they are, perhaps, unequall'd, and
there is an astonishing variety of this species, from a bird
larger than the common parrot down to some that are less than a
sparrow. To enumerate the many kinds of birds which are here
would be tedious. Suffice it to say that of those with which we
are acquainted there are several of the most charming feather,
that scarcely can be deemed ordinary, and that many we find in
England are also here, such as hawks, crows, cranes, quails, wild
ducks, pelicans, herons, &amp;c., &amp;c. Here is, likewise, a
very large bird of the ostrich kind, which they call the amue's,
or emue's, and swans exactly like ours, but that they are
entirely black. I must now take a look at our operations in the
colony, and inform you of their progress. The first grand object,
after landing the convicts and pitching the tents, the ground
being in some measure clear'd, and the spot for the camp fixed,
was to build houses for the reception of the stores. This, though
it occasioned many very necessary matters to go on but slowly,
was yet indispensably requisite. For the ships, tho' excellent
storehouses in themselves, were to be discharged as soon as
practicable, because any long detention of them here must create
a great expense to Government. The clearing of the ground was a
work of vast labour, and to shape timber for the purposes of
building, an object of immediate concern. The Governour's house
was soon erected, as the complete frame, &amp;c., were brought
out in the fleet. This, as a temporary matter, was convenient
enough, but another to be built of stone is now on foot, and if
one may judge by the foundation will be a decent structure. The
Lieut.-Governour, who lives on the west side of the cove, has
also one raising of the same materials. For some time, all lived
in marquees and tents, but many of the officers have long
contrived to have compact huts; and some of the industrious, even
in low stations, have also secur'd to themselves similar
conveniences.</p>
<p>As our winter approached&mdash;which, however, is very
moderate compared to yours&mdash;barracks were begun for all the
soldiers, and are now in good forwardness. They made a point of
hutting the married folks first, and no doubt in twelve months
more, great progress will be made in a more permanent style of
building, &amp;c., &amp;c. At somewhat less than a league from
the camp there is plenty of good clay, and capital brick-kilns
are here established, and this, tho' a scanty village, is, I
assure you, a much frequented and pleasant walk. Add to this
gardening, farming, and a thousand other things are carrying on
with all possible expedition. The difficulty of getting forward
with so many concerns at once, and all equally necessary, can be
easier imagined than described. Having never been conversant with
a rural life, I know but little of agriculture except by hearsay,
which reports that, as might be expected, some things come up
well, some indifferently, and others not at all. In some cases
the deficiency of the soil often balks the expectations that
arise from similarity of climate. However, cabbages, turnips, and
the best vegetables thrive pretty well, and tho' the ground is
none of the best for wheat, our husbandmen promise themselves
much from the assistance of art.</p>
<p>Various courts of justice are established here, composed of
officers in the civil, marine, and naval lines, and several
executions have taken place. The Governour has power in most
cases to pardon after condemnation, but finding by repeated
experience that lenity has no other effect than to encourage
their malpractices, and that this abandoned crew were lawless and
incorrigible, he has avowed a determination of letting them abide
by the just rigour of the law, since to do otherwise did but
favour the bad to the great detriment of the better inclined.</p>
<p>Soon after our arrival, when the affairs of the colony were in
some measure adjusted, the commissions for the Governour,
Lieut.-Governour, &amp;c., were read in publick, on a place for
parade near the camp.* The soldiers on this occasion were drawn
up, and the band at intervals performed several pieces suited to
the business. The convicts were placed by themselves, and after
the reading was over, by which they were assured of his great
power and prerogatives, his Excellency addressed them in a very
well-delivered and energetick piece of oratory, in which, tho' he
promised the deserving every possible encouragement, and that all
their crimes, till again made manifest by renewed bad conduct,
should no more be thought of, and, in short, that he would
consider them as beginning anew, yet still he acquainted them
with his firm intention that when lenity failed of its proper
effect rigour and severity should constantly be the reward of
every incorrigible offender. After more to this purpose they had
permission to disperse.</p>
<p class="foot">[* 7th February, 1788. See Vol. i, part 2, p.
122.]</p>
<p>The Governour, passing through the different companies of
marines upon the parade, was saluted with due honours, and at the
conclusion of this ceremony repaired to his marquee to partake of
a cold repast, attended by the principal officers in each
department.</p>
<p>June 23d, at 4 p.m. per log, there was felt the gentle shock
of an earthquake, and the appearance of the country warrants an
opinion that it has been subject to very severe ones. The King's
birthday was celebrated with great state and solemnity, and large
bonfires&mdash;we had plenty of wood&mdash;were burning all
night. The ships saluted at sunrise, noon, and sunset, which must
have frightened the warra warras, for so we call the blacks, from
their constant cry of "warra warra" at everything they see that
is new.</p>
<p>For the most part we have extraordinary fine weather, but
during the winter, of which we are now about the middle, we have
rains of several days' continuance, and almost without
intermission. Throughout this our cold season it has never
amounted to fair frost or snow. We have had hail, and the lowest
that the thermometer has really given was at noon 50&deg; 00'. On
our first coming here, however, in the hot weather, shifts to an
amazing number of degrees were announced by that instrument, and
no doubt might greatly contribute to sickness, which was then
much more frequent than at present.</p>
<p>I must add that Capt'n Hunter and Mr. Bradley have taken
several actual surveys of this harbour,* and these, with many
other particulars, will be seen in print before we shall arrive
in England to inspect them.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See the large map with soundings of Port
Jackson in Hunter's Historical Journal, p. 160.]</p>
<p>The name given to the country round about is Cumberland, in
honour of that family. The plan of a town is laying out, in which
I believe the ingenious Mr. Dawes is particularly engaged.
Whether the name is yet determined on I cannot tell, but have
heard Albion mentioned upon this occasion.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Note in the MS.:</i>&mdash;"Sydney was the
name decided upon."]</p>
<p>The Lady Penrhyn, Scarborough, and Charlotte sailed from hence
the 7th of May, 1788. The two latter are bound for China; the
former, it is supposed, on a speculative plan, concerning which
they were very close. We judge some kind of trade to be the
object, and their reasons for secrecy no doubt are good. They
mentioned their intentions of going to China, but the major part
of the letters, I believe, were put on board the others.</p>
<p>All through this narrative I have mentioned things as they
have happened per log, which makes it proper to observe that our
sea day begins at noon, so that 1 o'clock on Tuesday the 19th, by
your reckoning, if after noon, is by ship account 1 p.m. on
Wednesday, just commencing the 20th.</p>
<p>This day,* George Graves, one of our seamen, died, being the
first since our leaving England.</p>
<p class="foot">[*<i>Note by Mr. Butler</i>:&mdash;"The date, I
suppose, 12th July, 1788."]</p>
<p>Two of the transports, Golden Grove and Fishbourne, cannot
sail hence 'till we have storehouses, and leisure to clear them.
'Tis even supposed that one or both of them may go with us when
we sail, for the purpose of bringing supplies for the colony.</p>

<p align="center">DANIEL SOUTHWELL TO MRS. SOUTHWELL.</p>
<p align="right">H.M.S. Sirius, Table Bay, Cape of Good Hope,<br>
19th February, 1789.     </p>
<p><small>AS</small> I have already written, my dr. mother, soon
after our arrival at the Cape, you will excuse me not being
altogether so circumstantial in this. However, I shall mention
that as no supplys were received, or cou'd indeed in the nature
of things be reasonably expected, at the colony, it was judged
expedient to send the Sirius for a temporary supply of provision,
of which flour seems to have been the most wanted. Of this
article we have taken much; and what with the public, join'd to
our private comissions, which were many, we are, as you may
suppose, perfectly full.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** In a log-book of this voyage, kept by
Southwell, the provisions taken on board the Sirius for the
settlement are given as:&mdash;Flour, 182,632 lb.; biscuits,
7,000 lb.; soft bread, 2,700 lb.; salt beef, 15,360 lb.; salt
pork, 2,869 lb.; raisins, 2,860 lb.; fresh beef, 6,727 lb.; rice,
15,350 bushels; caravances, 246 bushels; Cape brandy, 3,098
gallons; Cape wine, 1,183 gallons; vinegar, 489 gallons.]</p>
<p>We left Pt. Jackson 2d of Octr., 1788, and pursuing our
passage by way of Cape Horn, met with much cold and disagreable
wr. We saw an astonishing number of ice islands; many of these
were remarkable both for peculiarity of appearance in point of
colouring as well as for their extraordinary height and
magnitude. 'Twas lucky that while in the thickest part of this
almost endless group we were much favour'd with a fair wind. Had
this been otherwise 'twould have rendered our navigation not only
tedious but dangerous to a degree. Of these we had not the
pleasure to take leave till in the lat. of 49&deg; S.; our
highest lat. by observation was 57&deg; 37' S., but we have
reason to think that we have at intervals been a few miles
farther to the southward. By making this passage we have
performed the circumnavigation of the Globe, and by continually
sail'g to the east'd have gain'd a whole day, for it happen'd
that on the 25th December we by obs'n crossed the opposite
meridion to Greenwich, whence the reckoning for longitude begins.
This made it necessary to call that day over twice, so we had two
Christm's Days, and both were celebrated with as much festivity,
&amp;c., as the nature of things cou'd admit of, The scurvy, soon
after we left Port Jackson, began to attack us, and toward the
end very severely. We had but three men die, and many on our
arrival were in sad condition. Of these, all have recover'd but
one poor man, who is to go for England in the Alexander. At this
port there is plenty of refreshment, and the effect of these on
our weather-beaten crew was rapid and surprising, even in spight
of the imprudent excesses of many, who, one might have thought,
were striving to finish what the scurvy, fatigue, and hard living
had almost effected.</p>
<p>We got into Table Bay January 2d, and all the sick were sent
on shore as soon as proper accommodations cou'd be procured for
them. In my other letters, both to my hon'd uncle and yourself, I
have mentioned some particulars concerning the fate of the
transports of our fleet, &amp;c., but for this and all the many
particulars relative to the Alexander in particular I refer you
to my worthy and intelligent friend Mr. Shortland. 'Twas my own
opinion for some time passt that we shou'd have the satisfaction
to see her 'ere we sail'd, and it has happened accordingly. He
can best relate his long tale of hardship himself, and I shall
only observe that he came last from Batavia, from which place, as
I inform you in a former letter, they were to be expected. To
that port they got, but with great difficulty, and were forced in
their passage thither to sink their consort, the good snow
Friendship,* not having hands left sufficient to work both
vessells. We are now in expectation of sailing immeadiatly for
P't J'n, and conclude 'twill be a passage of two months. When we
left that place we left a man to look after a kind of
kitchen-garden, situated on a small island in the harbour, and
appropriated to the service of H.M.S. Sirius.** Shou'd this
succeed and yield encrease twill prove of good use, and worth the
labour it has cost. But tho' we may, at our arrival, be longing
for refreshments of this nature, yet, for my own part, I will not
be sanguine, for not only our black, but our still more barbarous
neighbours, the convicts, may have despoil'd or destroyed it.
With respect to our future destination 'tis impossible to speak
with certainty, but 'tis probable we shall next take a trip among
the Friendly Islands, make a visit to Norfolk Island, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. I must not omit to tell you that during the whole of our
voyage, tho' rather trying, I was never so much indisposed as to
be forced to lay by. My constitution, I am thinking, is getting
more robust, and the situation I am in, and the footing I am
upon, is altogether as good and agreeable as may be.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Friendship was scuttled on the 28th
October, 1788, in consequence of the number of hands being so
reduced by death as to be unequal to the work of navigation.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Garden Island.]</p>
<p>Mr. Palmer, our purser, has always continued to manifest a
friendship for me on sev'ral occasions&mdash;I shou'd say many.
His cabbin, by a pressing and friendly invitation, is ever at my
service; and I find it frequently, when I have something
particular to do, or a desire to be retired, a very desirable
retreat. Shortly after our arrival he made a voluntary offer of
assisting me with his purse. Of this I accepted, but with more
moderation than he prescribed. This, as 'twas only to be
considered between us as one friend lending to another, appeared
to me much shorter and better than troubling my captain to
endorse a bill, which (by-the-bye) is a g't favour, and my
demands wou'd have been almost too trifling to have troubled him
so much, or justify me in the obligation.</p>
<p>There were other reasons which (as things have turned out) we
will not now explain. I must only beg you will give my love and
best thanks to my cousin, Daniel Dawes, who, on the strength of
former acquaintance with Mr. P., first paved the way for the
friendly understanding that subsists b'een this gent'n and
myself.</p>
<p>I have written, as I mention'd, to my d'r friend Uncle Butler.
The conveyance was by Mr. Bynfield, a gentleman (Nabob) on his
return from India, who politely promised to forward any letters
for England that should be entrusted to him with all possible
expedition.</p>
<p>For particulars not in that mention'd I beg to refer him to
this; and <i>to this</i>, you, my dear mother, can add what more
information you may receive from Mr. Shortland, who has a tale of
vast variety to relate, if you can be so happy as to secure an
hour or two of his good company. He is rather modest or shy,
which is an amiable falt, but your affabilitie and a short
acquaintance will make him communicative and agreable. I am not
yet sure wether I write to Mrs. Everett or Lane; if not, you can
present best respects, &amp;c. Mr. Miller,* at P't J., was well
when we came away, and is, I believe, a worthy man, but is rather
yea and nay&mdash;or can you comprehend&mdash;chip in pottage.
Indeed, his inattention would appear unpardonable, did I not know
it was natural and without meaning.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Andrew Miller, the Commissary. He resigned
in 1790, from ill-health, and died on the passage to

<p>I need not assure you that all my friends and relations are
now remember'd and ever frequently thought of [here follow
messages to them]. 'Twould give me satisfaction to hear from you,
but when to look for that I know not&mdash;most of us here are in

of my way, and 'tho he once claim'd my services in the course of
the passage out, on an occasion in which 'twould be the hight of
absurdity for me to interfere. In short, he with sev'ral sailors
were b't on b'd accused of some misdemeanour, and punish'd by

can learn, is not a bad man at heart, 'tho rather unsteady in his

<br>
<p class="list"><small>EXTRACT</small> of a copy of a letter from
D. Southwell to the Rev. W. Butler, dated 12th July, 1788, from
Sydney Cove, of which the original has not been preserved.</p>
<p><small>DIVINE</small> service is regularly perform'd when the
weather will permit, for as yet there is no house finished for
that purpose. I will just close with an account of one of our
most remarkable fish, of which we have a great variety, but the
shark is here observed to take the lead, not only in power, but
in many variations of genus. Of these principals we have taken
four since our arrival in the cove, and tho' certainly sharks,
they are not of that established kind so common to the coast of
Guinea and the West Indies. It differs from these in having more
fins. The mouth, instead of crossing the under-part of the head
in almost a right line, is in the form of an half-oval. The teeth
are individually of another make, and the general arrangement of
them is different. There are many sets of these destructive
weapons, fixed in the upper and under jaw in such order as
alternately to suit or coincide, which must not a little
contribute to the dread purposes which they are so well
calculated to execute. The largest of these measured 13 feet 6
inches in length, and 9 feet 4 inches in circumference. The
breadth between the eyes, 2 feet, and a middling-sized person
might pass through the jaws without difficulty. The liver
furnish'd 25 gallons of oil for the lamps. He had seven or eight
rows of teeth standing up, yet, as is usual with the young of the
shark species, there were still several prostrate rows, which in
that situation are not effective. Of these, it is said, one row
becomes erect every year, which must be allowed to furnish a
reasonable presumption that this formidable bully of the waters
had not yet attained his full growth. When these gentry are in
the harbour few fish are to be caught, they so frighten and make
such havock among them. This hero had half a dozen hooks in his
jaws, and I now recovered one I had lent, and which he had made
off with a fortnight before. From these, I presume, he felt as
little inconvenience as an African from his boney pendant or

<br>
<p>The following account of an engagement which took place
amongst the natives of New Holland, in Manly Bay, near Port
Jackson, fell under the eye-witness of the writer, and is here
inserted, as he finds the incidents are so very slightly and
imperfectly narrated in the publication of Gov'r Phillip's
voyage, given by Mr. Stockdale in 1789. See that work, chap. xiv,
page 134.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Governor Phillip alludes to this circumstance
in his despatch to Lord Sydney of 28th September, 1788, Vol. i,
part 2, p. 191. See also White's <i>Journal</i>, p. 207.]</p>
<p>This morning about 7 we went in the large cutter to land some
of the Governor's party; the rest were with him in his own boat.
At 9 we landed in Manly Cove, so named by the Governour at our
first coming, from the people being numerous, more hale and
robust than the generality, and showing a sort of fearless
conduct, &amp;c. So soon as we reached the shore, the natives
assembled round us to the number of seventy or eighty, and we
have reason to think there were more, with many women and
children, at no great distance. They affected a deal of good
humour and unconcern; but 'tis believed they do not much like our
coming amongst them. The watchful eye they keep upon our people's
musquets is very likely the effect of fear; but it also seems
expressive of disappointment, and leads to a doubt of their
sincerity if not thus overawed.</p>
<p>Nothing more, however, than usual occurr'd; and having
received my orders from the Governour to wait on him the
following Sunday, by 4 in the afternoon, I went on board.</p>
<p>On the day appointed* we accordingly went down the harbour to
Manly Cove, accompanied by the Governour's boat and two marines
in each. When there, we came to a grappling two boats' length
from the beach, having received an injunction not to land on any
account, but to wait there till sunset.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The 24th August, 1788. See White's
<i>Journal</i>, p. 207.]</p>
<p>The people were now more numerous than usual, upwards of two
hundred, as I judge, being in sight. The major part of them were
sitting in the long grass a little inland from the sandy beach;
and this either by way of sunning themselves, or to view the
Europeans and their canoes. We were sufficiently near to talk
with them; and several of them came close by the waterside under
the stem of our boats. A good while was spent in telling them the
names of a variety of things, many of which, it is no less true
than remarkable, they pronounced with as much ease and propriety
as ourselves, and were mightily well pleased to see us so
completely foiled, as we often were, in attempting to master some
of their "throttlers" or gutturals. They wanted us much to come
on shore, which was impracticable. Indeed, so intent seemed they
on persuading us to it that after several waggish intimations
from our people that a sight of their ladies would be very
agreeable, they caused about twenty of them to pass close by us,
to which, indeed, they seemed not at all averse. They were
preceded by [an] ill-favoured old Beldam of so disagreeable an
aspect that we could not determine whether a short harangue she
made on the occasion was a kind invitation to land, or a
sarcastick volley of abuse, for what she might take it in her
head to deem our idle curiosity. Some of the young damsels looked
well enough, all things considered. They were quite facetious,
and so far as our slender knowledge of their dialect extended,
kept up a very warm, animated, and amorous discourse. However,
they did not forget now and then to give a side glance at their
countrymen, with whose grand foible they were no doubt well
acquainted; and when they retired seemed to do it rather from a
fear of giving them offence than from any inclination of their
own.</p>
<p>After this, when all had for some time been quiet and still,
sitting quite hush[ed] in the grass, we were not a little
surprized to hear a great tumult which proceeded from some who
sate farther back among the trees. At first the noise was simply
that of men's voices wrangling with the most barbarous dissonance
and savage agitation; but now the clashing of spears and the
strokes of lances against the target was very distinctly heard.
Looking that way, therefore, we saw several of them engaged in
warm combat, darting at each other with true savage fierceness.
All now ran and seized their weapons, which, by the way, must
have been deposited in the grass, as till now they had kept them
out of our sight, and a scene of great noise and confusion ensued
on all sides.</p>
<p>The women, who hitherto had all huddled together a little way
from our boats' station, came running down with every appearance
of terror, and calling to us repeatedly. Some staid behind,
anxiously looking out from between the trees as if to observe the
event and wait the decision, and the children everywhere were
clinging to them and squalling pitiably. What those females meant
who thus precipitately came down to us I am at a loss to
conclude, but they seemed to supplicate our assistance. The
battle continu'd long, and was now and then interrupted with
noisy expostulations, in the midst of which the contending
parties would, however, frequently lanch a spear at each other
with all the rage of madmen. They are dexterous to a degree in
the use of the target, and during the affray, which lasted an
hour, I did not see one of them completely disabled, tho'
frequently forced to quit the field. I mean not by this to say
there was really no execution done, but the thickness of the
trees greatly impeded our view. Four of our people affirmed that
they saw one man carried off the field with a lance fast in his
side. It is hard indeed to suppose but that during so long a
contest some must be wounded, and in fact we see few of these
people anywhere, or of any age, but have many scars and marks of
weapons on their bodies.</p>
<p>'Tis odd that the warriors in question would frequently all at
once desist from the attack, and talk together as though nothing
at all had happened, and some others of the multitude would come
down and gaze at us just as before. The women were less
discomposed, and many of the men, though a part of their corps
were still as warmly engaged as ever, came down on the shore to
discourse with us in the usual way, and apparently regardless of
what was going on among the rest.</p>
<p>I must not omit that in one of their expostulations, in which
the women now and then endeavoured to assist, our old Jezebel,
the matron, to use an homely sea phrase, "got herself capsized
heels over head", a sign, perhaps, that they pay no great respect
to the decisions of the ladies, at least on such occasions; and I
rather took it as a rude mode of suggesting a hint that they
deemed the business she had engaged in as impertinent and
officious&mdash;in short, no concern of hers.</p>
<p>But, in truth, the whole proceedings of this afternoon were so
equivocal as to leave me, I must confess, incapable of giving any
positive opinion concerning the variety of their manoeuvres. It
strikes me, however, that one of the following conjectures may be
right:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. It is possible, when any of these uncivilized beings happen
to fall out, that instead of deciding the matter by fistycuffs,
as with us boxing Britons, they instantly obey the first dictates
of passionate resentment, aiming for the time at nothing less
than the life of their immediate antagonist;</p>
<p>2. As they seem much to dread our decisive superiority to them
in arms, they might perhaps hope to impress us with formidable
sentiments of their native savage bravery by thus making a fierie
display of prowess in a sharp engagement, acted to the very life,
in which, therefore, the most bitter animosity and every
corroborating appearance of cruelty was most artfully managed, as
I have above attempted to show; or</p>
<p>3. Lastly, the whole exploit might be a stratagem to draw us
on shore at any rate, whether by the supposed invincible
attraction of female blandishments, or by the repeated shew of
terror and distress so naturally exhibited, as I have observed,
by the women and children.</p>
<p>I have only to add that, when seemingly tired either with the
reality or the strong semblance of fighting with each other, they
took it into their heads to begin with us by throwing several
spears from behind the trees that fell little short of our boats.
I was unwilling to exert the power we had over these poor
wretches, and finding they still continued to lurk behind the
trees with every appearance of hostility, I thought proper, the
sun being just on the horizon, to haul farther out from the
beach, contenting myself with now and then presenting a musket
when I perceived any of them preparing to aim from behind the
thicket. This never failed to strike them with a panick, and sent
them off with all the heel they had. But still, so depraved are
their sentiments (if I may thus hazard that respectable word), or
so little do they reflect on motives or effects, that
forbearance, instead of having the use intended, only led them to
despise our seeming imbecillity. On going away they came down and
hooted, as, I presume, in contempt of our menaces. Whenever their
spears were thrown a barbarous yell was raised in applause, as I
concluded, of the warrior; and in this horrid exclamation the
voice of the sooty sirens was very distinguishable, who not long
before had endeavour'd to allure us to their inhospitable beach
in vain.</p>

<p align="center">DANIEL SOUTHWELL TO THE REV. W. BUTLER.</p>
<p align="right">Outpost, Port Jackson,          <br>
14th April, 1790.   </p>
<p>Ever Honor'd and D'r Sir,</p>
<p>My warmest and most affectionate good wishes are herewith
bound to yourself, my much-loved aunt and cousins. Glad I am of
an opportunity of conversing with friends I so much esteem, but
you will join with me in thinking the circumstances that furnish
it untoward.</p>
<p>Bless God, tho' unfortunate, we have enough to be thankful
for; but before I mention the grand catastrophe I will lead by
the steps that led to it. We have here long waited in anxious
expectation of receiving a supply of provisions, &amp;c., from
England, but nothing has as yet arrived; the consequence is that
the allowance has for &frac12; a year past been diminished from
time to time, and lately to such a degree as to be most sensibly
felt by all. Were we at a full quantity, our food, from being so
long in store, affords but little nutriment. We are now at less
than &frac12; allow., and some articles of diet are deficient,
having been consumed. We are now on the brink of going three upon
one man's dividend, and a few weeks must, if nothing arrives, put
us at a quarter allow'e. The consequence of this we will not
dwell on, but 'tis certain that any moderate man on full,
especially if laborious, has but little left when provis'n
becomes due. After waiting so long that the general hopes began
to diminish, the Governor thought proper in this emergency to
send Maj. Ross, command. of marines, with many officers,
privates, and common people of both sexes, to Norfolk Island,
with a proportionable part of the remaining provisions; this, I
believe, was done because of the more thriving soil at Norfolk,
and on account of fish being there in greater plenty.</p>
<p>We have for near three m's had a lookout kept here for ships
toward the sea.* The flagstaff is situated on very high land,
being the south head of the harbour, just by the entrance, and
the hutts where we reside just adjacent. For the first four or
five weeks a commission, officer and mid'n were station'd here
with a party of men, but on the ships** being order'd for sea (or
rather before that), his Excellency was pleased to direct that
this charge shou'd devolve upon myself and the gunner jointly. As
my wish was to see what was to be seen while abroad, and sev'ral
of the young men had seen Norfolk Island, I waited on C'n Hunter
to apply for one who was willing to stay in my room, and observed
that 'twas a particular service (for 'tis a hazardous business
landing so many people and provis's in a tremendous surf), and
that, as being a mate (of which there are only three) it was
rather matter of surprize. He took this (I spoke it with some
appearance of dissatisfaction) as I meant he should, viz., that
it had rather the appearance of undervaluing my intended
services, but he soon relieved me by giving me such reasons for
the Governor's choice as occasioned me to acknowledge myself
honor'd by it; and indeed the attention he pays to me while here
and approbation of my conduct seem fully to warrant what was
said. I, nevertheless, intended to have prefer'd the matter to
G'r Ph.; but reflecting with myself that as I shou'd be the only
naval offic'r here, and that in case of a fleet coming with
stores, &amp;c., he might find me useful, and possibly have
look'd on to such an event to serve me, I e'en let the matter
rest, determined to be satisfied.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Tench's Complete Account, p. 38.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** The Sirius and Supply.]</p>
<p>But to proceed&mdash;When all things were adjusted they
embarked on b'd the Sirius and Supply. They left this port on the
6th of March, 1790, and I from the flagstaff followed them with
my eyes 'till out of sight. Nothing more of these were seen 'till
April the 5th, when the man who takes his station there at
daybreak soon came down to inform me a sail was in sight. On
going up I saw her coming up with the land, and judged it to be
the Supply, but was not a little surprized at her returning so
soon, and likewise being alone my mind fell to foreboding an
accident; and on going down to get ready to wait on the Gov'r, I
desired the gunner to notice if the people mustered thick on her
decks as she came in under the headland, thinking in my own mind,
what I afterwards found, that she* was lost.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Sirius.]</p>
<p>The Supply bro't an account that on the 19th of March about
noon the Sirius had in course of loading the boats drifted rather
in with the land. On seeing this, they, of course, endeavour'd to
stand off, but the wind being dead on the shore, and the ship
being out of trim and working unusually bad, she, in
staying&mdash;for she would not go about just as she was coming
to the wind&mdash;tail'd the ground with the after part of her
keel, and with two sends of the vast surf that runs there was
completely thrown on the reef of dangerous rocks call'd Pt.
Ross.** They luckily in the last extremity let go both anchors
and stopper'd the cables securely, and this, 'tho it failed of
the intention of riding her clear, yet caused [her] to go right
stern-foremost on the rocks, by which means she lay with her bow
opposed to the sea, a most happy circumstance, for had she laid
broadside to, which otherwise she would have had a natural
tendency to have done, 'tis more than probable she must have
overset, gone to pieces, and every soul have perish'd. We see in
this one instance how a gracious Providence can by means
undesined on man's part, and seeminly accidental, bring about
effectual preservation where little was to be expected but
inevitable death. "Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the
great waters". And a subject for thanksgiving, sure that it is
so; for here all skill, all human knowledge, would have been
rendered abhortive without this Providential interference.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Note in the MS.:</i>&mdash;"Through
misinformation, I have said in my letter to my Uncle Butler 'Lost
on Point Ross', which rectify throughout." Collins (vol. i, p.
103) states that the Sirius was wrecked on the "reef off the S.W.
end of the Bay" (Sydney Bay). See also Lieutenant King's account,
ante, p. 657.]</p>
<p>Her bottom bulged immeadiately, and the masts were as soon cut
away, and the gallant ship upon which hung the hopes of the
colony was now a complete wreck. They bro't a few of the officers
and men hither; the remainder of the ship's co., together with
C'n Hunter, &amp;c., are left there on acc't of constituting a
no. adequate to the provision, and partly to save what they
possibly can from the wreck. I understand there are some faint
hopes, if favor'd with extraordinary fine w'r, to recover most of
the provision, for she carried a great quantity there on the part
of the reinforcement. The whole of the crew were saved, every
exertion being used and all assistance received from the Supply
and colonists on shore. The passengers fortunately landed before
the accident, and I will just mention to you the method by which
the crew were saved. When they found that the ship was ruin'd and
giving way upon the beam right athwart, they made a rope fast to
a drift buoy, which by the surf was driven on shore. By this a
stout hawser was convey'd, and those on shore made it fast a good
way up a pine-tree. The other end being on b'd was hove taut. On
this hawser was placed the heart of a stay (a piece of wood with
a hole through it), and to this a grating was slung after the
manner of a p'r of scales. Two lines were made fast on either
side the heart&mdash;one to haul it on shore, the other to haul
it on board. On this the shipwreck'd seated themselves two or
more at a time, and thus were dragged on shore thro' a sad
dashing surf which broke frequently over heads, keeping them a
considerable time under water, some of them coming on shore
half-drowned and a good deal bruized. C'n Hunter was a good deal
hurt, and with repeated seas knock'd off the grating, in so much
that all the lookers on fear'd greatly for his letting go, but he
got on shore safe, and his hurts by no means dangerous. Many
private effects were saved, the sea driving them on shore when
thrown overboard, but 'twas not always so courteous. Much is
lost, and many escaped with nothing more than they stood in. I
luckily let nothing of mine of any consequence go to sea,
reflecting that no ship that leaves a port can answer for her
return. I was a little rallied by my young friends on b'd for my
foresight, and in answer wished good luck, tho' I told them I
cou'd by no means insure it. It was intended but for this ill-hap
to have sent the Sirius to China immediately on her return for
provision. The Supply, however, is getting ready with all
expedition for sea. She is, if convenient, to touch at Norfolk in
the way to receive the 1st Lieut't, who is to have the charge of
bringing hither whatever vessels may be taken up, but not for
this or any other purpose to make any long delay, for the errand
she goes upon is, you perceive, of the last importance. Batavia
is the port first bound to, and the Commissary, Mr. Millar,* goes
to transact this business, being in his way to England, wither he
wishes to return on acc't of ill-health. If he cannot get a ship
or ships here he will proceed to China or the Cape,** possibly
both, and if at the latter he hears no news of any that have
sailed on their way to New Holland, or if he shou'd, and has
reason to judge from the time, &amp;c., that something fatal has
befallen them, he must then take up a very capital concern on
Govern't account, which at this rate must exceed six m's, but we
must hope for something sooner, or this may come too late! Lieut.
P. G. King, who I formerly mentioned as commad't at Norfolk, came
from thence in the Supply, and is going to England, I believe,
with the Governor's dipatches. Mr. Palmer, late purser of the
Sirius, is to be Comiss'y in lieu of the above-mentioned Mr.
M[iller]. Pr. favor of the latter I send my packett, which, if
affairs detain him abroad, he will forward. It is one
satisfaction in the present gloomy state of things to see prudent
measures pursued to avert as much as possible the present and
impending evils. Private stock (of which by-the-bye there is but
little) is purchased on the public acc't at a price and served in
lieu at the store. Seed and every proper encouragem't is now
given to those [who] will industriously cultivate the ground.
There are sev'ral spots laid out for rearing vegitables, and
these are designed for a public concern. I am sorry to observe
that the most useful productions, such as grain, thrives very
indifferently, but they have some spots at a little settlem't up
the harbour call'd Rose Hill, where things thrive tolerably well,
but altogether quite inadequate to purpose of public subsistence.
'Tis true most of the settlers have each a cultivated spot, but
vegitables, if put wholly to it, are but a flimsy diet, and here
are by no means in lavish abundance. The boats, let who will own
them, are all sent fishing for the community, fish being served
out as pork, only a larger proportion, by way of making the
provis's hold out. People are also appointed to go in the woods
after cangooros, but this is rather a precarious supply, and
seldom turns to much acc't; but all helps, and if 'twas less
'twere worth the trying for.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Note in the MS.:</i>&mdash;"I since
understand Mr. Millar is not to be so emp'd, being merely for
home."]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Mr. Miller died on the passage from Batavia
to Mauritius. See Vol. i, part 2, p. 428. 1790]</p>
<p>The duty of the people is, by the Governor's consideration,
lessened in proportion to their stinted allowance, and they have
every afternoon to themselves to attend to the main
concern&mdash;how to subsist. His Excellency has kindly taken
those of officers who were shipwreck'd into his mess, and his
disinterested conduct in sharing the publick inconveniences
merits evry encomium. Here, as in every other commonwealth, are
enough to reprobate and condemn the public measures. When times
are bad and replete with misfortunes it makes men peevishly look
where to lay the blame. About this there are various opinions,
and the parties which are alternately consider'd as culpable are
as far apart as from hence to England. For my own part I confess
myself incompetent to pronounce upon this head, being perplexed
with a variety of conjectures, but able to conclude nothing. I
earley and late look with anxious eyes toward the sea, and at
times, when the day was fast setting and the shadows of the
evening strch'd out, have been deceived with some fantastic
little cloud, which, as it has condensed or expanded by such a
light, for a little time has deceived impatient imagination into
a momentary idea that 'twas a vessel altering her sail or
position while steering in for the haven, when in a moment it has
assumed a form so unlike what the mind was intent upon, or become
so great'y extended, as fully to certify me of its flimsy texture
and fleeting existence. Surely our countrymen cannot have
altogether forgotten us, or been vainly led from any silly,
sanguine representations hence to trust we cou'd make it out
tolerably well without their assistance. The difference here
between our [word underlined and erased] is a subject I dare not
pronounce upon.* You possibly may have heard more of it at home
than we, for 'tis generally concluded here that each parties'
representa'ns have or will become matter of full investigation in
England.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The reference is doubtless to the disputes
between the Governor and Major Ross.]</p>
<p>I will now say a word or two concerning our passage when
coming from the Cape of Good Hope. When I last wrote to you,
having taken in our cargoe, the principal which was six mo. full
allowance of flour for the colony and twelve mo. provis's for the
ship, we sail'd again for New Holland, and had a very narrow
escape from shipwreck, being driven on that part of the coast
call'd Tasman's Head,** in thick weather and hard gales of wind,
and embay'd, being twelve hours before we got clear, the ship
forced to be overpressed with sail and the hands kept continually
at the pumps, and all this time in the most distressing anxiety,
being uncertain of our exact situation and doubtful of our
tackling holding, which has a very long time been bad; for had a
mast gone or topsailsheet given way, there was nothing to be
expected in such boistrous weather but certain death on a coast
so inhospitable and unknown. And now to reflect if we had not
have reach'd the port with that seasonable supply, what cou'd
have become of this colony? 'Twould have been a most
insupportable blow; and thus to observe our manifold misfortunes
so attemper'd with the divine mercy on these occasions seems,
methinks, to suggest a comfortable lesson of resignation and
trust that there are still good things in store, and 'tis a duty
to wait in a moderated spirit of patient expectation for them.
'Tis worthy of remark, the following day (for we cleared this
dreaded land about 2 in the morning, being April 22d, 1789), on
examining the state of the rigging, &amp;c., some articles were
so fearfully chafed that a backstay or two actually went away or
broke. 'Tis also to be noted that the Sirius had, just before she
sailed for Norfolk Island, undergone a long repair, particularly
her sides were greatly strengthened with large pieces of timber
call'd upper and lower riders. These are strongly bolted to her
sides within, and her holding together when thrown upon the reef
in that roaring surf is chiefly imputed to that repair, which, so
far as that is the case, has answard a great purpose.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See Lieutenant Fowell's account, Vol. i, part
2, pp. 374, 375.]</p>
<p>The Governor has long had sev'ral natives in the camp; one,
named Araboon&#333;&#333;, died of the small-pox on the 18th May,
1789, being nine days after our arrival with our cargoe, as
before mentioned. He had become very tractable, and was at length
allow'd to go where he pleased; but he was so attach'd he would
not forsake us. There is now another on the same footing (being
the Governor's guest), named Woolarawery Ocultroway Benallon,*
with whom was taken also another, called Kebada Colby, who,
however, notwithstanding his being well entertained and keeping
the best company in the place, contrived to get away about ten
days after he was taken. Sev'ral officers and a party of men were
emp'd by the Governor to take these people, with a view to take
away that fear and prejudice which they have continued to show
ever since our first misunderstanding with them. Here is also a
boy named Nanbarry, and a girl call'd Abooroo; both these were
taken at a time when the small-pox made sad havock with them, and
all three seem now wholly reconciled to their situation. Some
curious particulars are learned, no doubt, of their manner of
living, &amp;c., but their progress in attaining English is but
slow; but their parts are tolerable, and understanding by no
means despicable. Benallon relates, with a deal of humour
(chiefly by gestures and signs), the manner of his being
caught&mdash;for he was decoyed with a fish&mdash;and says
"beial, beial"&mdash;very good, very good; and so it was, for he
gets plenty without the trouble of spearing them now. His
appetite is extraordinary, but he rather stands a chance of being
somewhat curtail'd soon; 'tis certain he can manage the share of
six men with great ease at one meal. As for religion, it cannot
be decided whether they have any. 'Tis known they burn, as well
as bury, their dead, and 'tis thought they sometimes do neither.
There is something mysterious, or rather superstitious, when in
trying, by pointing to the heaven, or sun, and moon, to strike
them with some idea of reverance&mdash;or, more properly, to see
if they have any&mdash;but to all this they generally say
"weiri&eacute;, weiri&eacute;", which is as much to say it's bad,
and that, as it seems to me, rather as if they thought their
influences bad, than that there was any impiety in pointing at
them. I have heard from good author'y that they have names for
the most remarkable constellations, and that they make
intelligible signs; that they are of use to them in crossing the
country or going upon the water during the night. 'Tis said that
this man, on being shew'd the grave of Araboon&#333;&#333;, who
he knew well and was formerly in friendship with, alternately
pointed to the ground and to the clouds in such a manner as
plainly shew'd they believe in the existance of the living
principle as seperated by the death of the body. Indeed, I have
few opportunities of making any observations on these people
myself; but I intend, as my stay is likely to be somewhat
protracted in this country, to gather what I can concerning their
manners, &amp;c., that is any way interesting, and reduce it into
some sort of order for my friends, if likely to be worth their
trouble to peruse.</p>

<p>[<i>Transcriber's Note</i>.&mdash;Then follows a statement of
his private affairs and chances of promotion.]</p>
<p>I must pray you, my dear uncle, to excuse the many defects of
this tedious long letter, both in matter, form, &amp;c. 'Tis
written in a situation, as you will perceive (from whence dated),
where I want many little conveniences. My mind is likewise taken
up with many things, and I have several large accounts to write
to other correspondents in England, and also some to Norfolk
Island, and the notice for the brig's sailing short, and my
opportunity of gaining information not frequent, the occasions
that call me to town being only sometimes to draw provisions,
which is done weekly. On these occasions I generally dine out,
for in visiting it has long, long! been the custom to put your
bread, at least, in your pockett; and 'tis the customary form of
invitation, "Will you bring your bread and come and see me?" The
Governor, too, on whom I always wait when up at camp, usually
detains me to dine with him.</p>

<p><small>ONE</small> (friend) I cannot but mention, and I am
sure you will esteem him for my sake, and that is a Mr. Dawes,
lieutenant of marines, and also astronomer, whose abilities in
that science are such that he is under the direction of the Board
of Longitude for the purpose of making some singular observations
while in this country, to effect which he has a valuable sett of
instruments, and an observatory is erected. To give you his
character in few words, he is a most amiable man, and though
young, truly religious, without any appearance of formal
sanctity. He is kind to everyone; but I am speaking of his many
affabilities to myself, which are such that more could not be
looked for from a relation. He has a great share of general
knowledge, studious, yet ever cheerful, and the goodness of his
disposition renders him esteemed and respected by all who know
him.</p>
<p>Here, at the Look-out, where I am stationed, we have a garden,
but in its infancy. However, the ground is tolerably good, and we
are now and then supplied with a few greens from a garden that
was intended for the ship's use. A boat is also allowed us, and
we have good opportunities to try our luck at fishing. There are
likewise musquets and ammunition for the defence of the place,

<p><small>YOUR</small> very welcome letters [came to my hands the
1st instant, rendered] doubly acceptable from the very long [time
that had elapsed since I last heard of your] welfare.</p>
<p>[<i>Transcriber's Note</i>.&mdash;Here follow private
messages.]</p>
<p>[We have lately been cheered with the arrival of five ships]
in Sydney Cove&mdash;a most refreshing [sight, as it has greatly
changed our late] clouded prospects. We were rather put to it,
[as you already know if you received my last] letters by the
Supply&mdash;sent to [Batavia for the relief of our] alarming
wants; these Mr. Millar, [the former Commissary, had the care of,
and] I'll hope all came to hand. [However, we have] now a
comfortable and sufficient quantity of such [food as is furnished
by the] ships and situation, the far greater part
come&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; ** of for vegitable, and this we
eat in an awaken'd thankfulness in [hope]s of enjoying in due
time these and other good things in the endearing society of
friends and connections in our native land.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Blank both in original and copy.]</p>
<p>Of this our prospects are bro't considerably nearer by the
loss of the Sirius, at Norfolk, the particulars of which are
amply stated in my last. It seems we were likely to have
continued here at least three years in addition to those past,
but as matters now stand it is intended for all her officers and
men to sail for England [as] soon as possible, and 'tis at
present next to certain that the Gorgon, shortly expected here
(at daily look-out for her), will be the ship that is to convey
us and the marine battallion hence. I might here make reflections
how strangely, and to us unaccountably, things unexpected are
bro't about; but much wiser men than myself in all ages have
remark'd it, and the result of their cogitation seems to be that
finitude cannot comprehend infinity, and for [aught] I know
[this] maxim that "whatever is, is right", consider'd in its [due
latitude, is the best way] of summing up our reasonings upon the
subject.</p>
<p>We have had little or no intercourse with the natives for a
long time past, and Woolaraveray Bennalon [Bennilong], from whom
we hoped so much, effected his escape, May 3rd, at a time when he
was supposed to be well reconciled to his situation.</p>
<p>He laterally slept in the same room with the Gov'r's steward,
and before it was light he pretended suddenly to be disordered,
upon which the other open'd the door, not doubting but he would
soon return; at last, tired with waiting, he thought proper to go
and see how and where W.B. was. Not finding him, and after
calling repeatedly, soon concluded what had happen'd, and
accordingly went to the Governor's room with the unwelcome news.
'Twas in vain to look after the runaway, who, it is conjectured,
had keenly remark'd an empty butt which had been left in the yard
near to the wall, and by the help of which he is thought to have
scaled it. We sometimes see a few of the natives, and I have
known them laugh heartily at our calling out after the
above-mentioned hero, and it is more than probable they have
understood us. The very day I rec'd your letter, another and
myself walk'd up,* not having a boat [to convey us, and] in Rose
Bay fell suddenly in with eight or nine of them about their fire,
which they precep'y left and hid in the thicket. I call'd
repeat'y to them "Coe" (which signifies come hither), and made
the aforement'd enqu', but they did not chuse to answ'r. There
was a new canoe on the beach and several bundles of spears,
fishing tackle, &amp;c.; but, set'g aside any danger that might
have attended a seizure of them, I cou'd not, from principle,
have made a seizure&mdash;indeed, it must be a heavy loss to
these people when deprived; and there is much reason to conclude
that the rage for curiosity, and the unjust methods made use of
to obtain them, have occasioned much of that misunderst'g that
has hitherto subsisted between us and them. We had a gun and
amun', without which it is by no means advisable to go about the
country, especially along shore, as our course mostly lay on this
occasion.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>i.e.</i>, walked from the Look-out Station

<p>Since our first [arrival] in this country four young gent., my
brother-officers, have by death and accident been call'd hence.
The first was Mr. Sam'l Rotton [Wrotten],** who was inva[lided]
for an hernia whilst at R. de Janeiro (we have since learned the
ship Diana in her way home sprung a leak, and being forced in
distress to bear up for the West Indies), and falling much worse
died on the passage. The next, Mr. Jas. Cunningham, also a good
young man, who met his fate at Norfolk Island in a m't dangerous
surf, the boat being swallowed up; himself and sev'ral others
were drowned.*** This happen'd prior to our voyage to the Cape
for provis's. Then Mr. Hill, nephew to Mr. Dyson, solicitor to
the Adm'y, having been on leave to see some friends in camp,
Syd'y Cove, the ship lying in Careening Cove to repair, and
knowing that duty req'd he shou'd be on b'd in the morning, not
meeting the opportunity of a boat, he made the attempt (having
been landed on the North Shore) to walk down. He went Friday, the
6th November, 1789, and has never since been heard of. We
conclude he either lost his way, or (being unarmed) was slain by
the natives. 'Tis most generally thought the latter. Parties were
sent in search, boats rowing up and down in all the coves, guns
fired frequently, but to no purpose.**** My next tale of woe is,
alas! a recent one, and render'd to us doubly distressing, the
situ. of two survivors at this recluse place. Having long been
without a boat (which by-the-bye is cruel), we are at times glad
to meet with a conveyance up to Sydney Cove. How pleasant and
shining was the day when our much-esteemed and sadly-regretted
companion and messmate, Mr. Jno. [James] Ferguson, as we wanted
provision, took the opport. of a boat which had been down the
harbour fishing! He also had with him Jno. Bates (a marine), a
man who from his good conduct had deservedly become a favorite
with us; and I reflect with peculiar complacency that at my last
seeing him I had in the course of express'g my satisfaction of
his behaviour signified my determination of repeating my good
opinion where it might be of service. His character lay under a
stigma; the charge cou'd never be proved, tho' investigated by
the process of a severe examinat. He steadily denied it. We found
him strict[ly] honest, nor was he that I find ever till then
suspected. He was regularly acquited, but it lay heavy on his
mind, and seem'd to bow it down. He was ever industrious, but
seldom cheerful. It was Friday, the 23rd, when, having
breakfasted here, these two got into a little flat-bottom'd boat
originally calculated for shuting in shoal water (call' by us a
pont). Besides these were two marines who had been trying their
luck all night, and call'd in here, as we had given them leave
(for they were good lads) any time to do. They had not got above
one 3d of the way, being a short mile below P't Bradley, and
nearly in the mid-streme, when a great whale app'd (for the first
time since we have been here) in the harbour, spouting and
dashing about in their usual manner. This monstrous creature,
either thro' being mischievous or playful, no sooner espied the
boat than he pursued and never left her till he had overturn'd
and sent her to the bottom. For more than ten minutes were these
unfortunes a prey to inexpressible anguish and horror. At first,
in rising, he haff fill'd the b', and with their hands against
the whale did they bear the boat off. In vain they thro' out
their hats, the bags for our provis's, and the fish they had
caught, in hopes to satisfy him or turn his attention. It seem'd
bent on their distraction, and with one sudden and tremendous
gamboll consigned three of their number to their hapless fate and
an endless eternity. Neither of those I've ment'd by name cou'd
swim; the survivor's comrade cou'd, even the best, but thro'
being heavily clad went down, after having sev'ral times
complain'd of his inability to hold up, the other affect'y
encour'ing him, but in vain; they were friends, and greatly
attach'd.</p>

<p>One gain'd the rocks a small dist. below Rose Bay, with much
diffi'y, and returning to the Look-out related this afflicting
circumstance.***** The poor fellow was sadly affected, and indeed
disorder'd, but such little assistance as cou'd here be given
him, he by next morning was able to return to camp in a boat
which came down with two officers, the masters of these unlucky
soldiers grown uneasy by their unusuall stay. Some boats were in
chase of the whale higher up, and frequently wounded him with
harpoons all the same day, but were ignorant as yet (so were all
the persons in Syd. Cove) of his fatal instrumentality in this
sad accident; and strange as it may seem, these gent'n have
carried the first acc't of this extraordinary and heartrending
catastrophe near thirty hours after it happened. I myself had
been in town and knew it not till by this opport'n of returning
hither, and had been long looking at Whabro, little imagining
that he had deprived us of a friend and messmate, two as worthy
veterans as the battalion cou'd boast. Poor James was a fine
young lad nearly seventeen y's; he was sensible, given to
reflection, possess'd of the firmest principl's, such as are
equally applicable to morality or honor&mdash;in short, to sum up
a cha'cter, which a deserved partiality must in justice give as a
tribute to his regretted memory, he was amiable; and here, to a
mind naturally given perhaps to too intense reflection on the sad
uncertainty of this world's affairs, and the mysterious dealings
of Providence, a trying kind of mental oppression, by reason of
insufficiency, will obtrude itself. He was among the miraculously
saved at Norfolk Island, and now, by a most unthought of event,
number'd with the dead; but these are ever violently check'd by a
strong internal suggestion that in this there is little of
christian resignation. The prospects clear presently, and I
generally begin and end with a firm persuation that if even so
insignificant a thing as sparrow falls not to the ground without
the cog'ance of Infinite mercy, much less shall man in whom was
breathed the breath of lives. He was son to Lieut.-Governor
Ferguson, of G'h [Greenwich] Hospital, a veteran officer of noted
ability and integrity. I feel great'y for the shock this will
give to the aged father. His hopes, I fear, hung chiefly on this
boy, whose situation as a candidate for naval promotion he might
fondly suppose might one day or other enable him bravely to
imitate the prowess of his father, and make him seem to live when
gone. And you, my d'r uncle, who I know can feel for another's
woe in a situation that comes not home by any parity of
circumstance, will here truly sympathize with the afflicted
parent of my friend. It has struck me, but you can best judge of
the propriety (I like not this word, and have not a better) of
writing a consolitary letter (for none can better speak
consolation), or waiting on the unhappy gent.; it might be some
satisfaction to know that your nephew was his son's companion. I
need not dwell any further on what I have offer'd, and your more
competent judgment will inform you how to act. J.F. has long been
without a mother, but has one b'r and one sister.</p>

<p>*   *  that are here and have been since 3rd June last,
cheer'd with the sight of ships coming in *   *  h succession,
cannot but feel for the apprehension *   *  this occasions
various opinions, but those in power shou'd know best; it is well
for them that when boats can venture out they generally get
plenty of fish. There are a vast many people on the island,* and
much it seems depended on what provision they might save from the
wreck of the Sirius, which was altogether uncertain. The soil
there is good, here it is not; and Indian corn and most
vegitables yield good encrease. The difficulty of landing there
in safety is a matter of regret, nor is it thought practicable to
remedy this by raising a pier, tho' an ingenious man, formerly a
domestick of the Gov'r, I am inform'd, had made a proposal which
with proper assistance (whether then to be had or no I can't say)
he had little doubt shou'd succeed. This place has been the scene
of sev'ral accidents, and many conclude it not so worthy of
attention as has been represented. Flax was the expected staple,
but as yet has turned to little acc't, for want, as it is said,
of managers. Its famous pine is a neat-grain'd wood, but has
baulk'd the expectation of its utility for naval purposes.**
There are a few bananas and plaintains at Norf. I'd, but no other
fruit of any consequence, or animals. About twenty months*** ago
they felt a tremendous gust of wind of sev'ral hours'
continuance, which at times wheling round with the utmost
violence tore up trees of astonishing dimensions by the
roots&mdash;indeed no known place is fam'd for larger or more
st[ately] pines. [These tower to an amazing height, and are
frequently strait] as an arrow. The damage done to the low
cultivated produce was less than might have been expected, but
while it lasted it fill'd every one with astonishment and
consternation.</p>

<p>At Port Jackson, as I have formerly mentioned, our little
settlem't, call'd Rose Hill, is the most flourishing, and is
intended to be the principal seat. Here is to be the chief town,
and here they are planning out a church, a house for the Gov'r,
principal officers, petty officers, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.
Down by Sydney Cove the brick manufacture seems a concern of
great utility, and succeeds exceeding well; the earthenware, from
causes arising here from want of some certain ingredients, has
not hither-too succeeded; they glaze nothing here, and the ware
is soft and also brittle; its quality, I have heard, is fine. Of
this and several other trifles as may fall within my reach I
propose to bear away a few, no otherwise acceptable but as little
mem's to my friends that I have been here, and while here
recollected you were such.</p>
<p>Our infant garden at this place exhibits a pleasing prospect
of vegitation. Seven or eight thousand head of green, and daily
planting some bed of turnip, radish, &amp;c., have reward'd our
little labour, which, when first pursued, we sowed not expecting
to reap; however, unlook'd for accident have detained us here,
and we unexpectedly eat the fruit of disinterested industry.</p>
<p>Our numbers lately were eleven; my companion, self, and seven
men, are all upon this little settlement; one man looks out for
the expected Gorgon, and is relieved in turn at every four hours
between the dawn and setting of the day. Mr. Harris and myself
occasionally go up thither when led by hope or inclination to
walk. It is up a craggy eminence about a mile from this spot,
where are the houses, or rather whitewash'd cottages, in a valley
adjoining to the garden, and near the bech. The ground for a good
space about here is unusually clear, with here and there a shrub,
and at a dist. in passing looks like a pleasant lawn. We have a
rill of fresh water at a stone's throw on each hand, and if our
situation was but seconded with more attention and civilty we
might feel less solicitous for our return hence. Indeed we are
consider'd as much negl'd by many kind friends who now speak with
reserve, and who on their return will probably speak with less.
In the meantime I shall pursue such a conduct as my best judgem't
can suggest, in short (G&mdash;&mdash; P&mdash;&mdash;) is
universally censur'd, and that by many cool, nay charitable
gents, and I begin to regard him as a reed of Egypt.</p>
<p>I like much to coincide with those whose jud'm't I honor and
esteem, but your expectation of many advantage[s] to accrue from
our colony are rather the effusions of phylantrophy than
positively express'd opinion. The vast difficulty of clearing
this craggy country, the very bad prospect of cattle of all
descriptions; this last is of a g't object, and if we shou'd, of
which at present there are no signs, be vigorous supplied in that
way as the cost will be enormous and the loss attend, the
conveyance g't. The Romans had these and ma[ny] other good
thin[gs at hand, and in a coun]try famed for its luxuriance. 'Tis
not only libberal but truly Christian to trust that these
outcasts, or at least their descendants, may by a parity of
reasoning improve and furnish good members to society. But after
all, men of estimable and weighty judgem't fail not to say that
this scheme seems to hold out no other than prospects of
long-continued heavy expence to the m'r country, a meer burthen,
and that 'twould have been only candid, not to say noble, had
this plain statement of the case been made, and not one of a
contrary tendency; indeed, this is here so generally the opinion
that it may be call'd an universal one.</p>
<p>However, at lenghth we have found rivers of tolerable note.
One falls into Broken Bay,* a large inlet to the northw'd; the
other lays inland at no great dist. from Rose Hill.** Was long
since discov'd by that worthy officer and affable gent., C'n
Tench. As yet something has prevented their ascertaining where is
its source, or where it disembouges itself. A little private
expedition is now in agitation for that purpose. That in Broken
Bay is of considerable ext., and runs up towards Prospect Hill,
an eminence of vast height, much inferior, however, to the Blue
Mountains, which are a great chain directly inland at the dist.
of 40 or 50 miles from the sea. I am in expectation of procuring
the opportunity of taking copies with mine own hand of these two
above-ment'd harbours and Botany Bay, and shou'd think the poor
performances when done greatly honoured hereafter by a birth in a
certain mansion at Chelsea.*** I often regret my want of skill at
the pencil and sev'ral other useful accomplishments. What I have
mentioned to you in my last concerning some distant notion I once
had of the possibility of my making a stay in the country by
choice is, of course, done away. Indeed, I spoke of it as a very
undetermined thing, and my inclination is now decisively for
going home. My much esteemed friend, who I then mentioned, will,
I doubt not, likewise return.</p>

<p>I hope you will pardon the insipidity of this letter, for I am
not supplied with much new matter to entertain you. Death has
made sad havock amongst the convicts who have last come out. Many

<p>This place,* we learn from Nanbarry, is fam'd for great
engagements, and here are some graves of their dead. It is
remarkable that at the first establishm't of the Look-out this
young lad, being here for a few days, after dark express'd a
dislike to stir from the hut, and plainly intimated his
superstitious fears of seeing some of the departed. Their
battles, from our imperfect information, are sometimes concerning
the right of fishing or dwelling in some particular cove, and
frequently about the fair sex, for we learn that parties of the
men at times come suddenly on the women, and while their husbands
are probably in the canoes at a distance or otherwise emp'd they
fail not to take the most unpardonable
liberties.   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>

chief, was taken in the same snare with Benallon, and effect'd
his escape long before him. They are very partial to the sex, and
Benallon spoke in raptures of a fam'd charmer (Odooroodah),
greatly admired by himself and many of his countrymen; indeed,
'tis more than probable that his reasons for leaving us were not
uninfluenced by some such inducem't.</p>
<p>[<i>Transcriber's Note</i>.&mdash;Here follows a second
account of Ferguson's death.]</p>
<p>Here where I reside the stone is now shaping for a look-out to
be built on the high land by the flagstaff; and to command a good
view of the offing, we have lately had a couple of little hutts
built for selves and people, and there [are] some vegetables in
the ground coming on very well. The situation, however, flags
upon too long and close aquaintance, and we look out sharply for
the Gorgon (44), daily expected here. It is intended for that
ship to convey us hence, and 'tho sufficient to acc'date the
marine batallion and their increased familys and effects,
&amp;c., now relieved by the new company, must no doubt be much
crouded by the addition of our late ship's Sirius's company.</p>
<p>[<i>Transcriber's Note</i>.&mdash;Southwell here discusses his
chances of promotion.]</p>
<p>Mortality has raged amongst the last freight of prisoners,
many of them dying on the passage, and not a few immediately on
landing; to these it is thought many would have been added had it
not been for that well-contrived and readily-erected temporary
hospital brought out with them and put up imediately on their
arrival. This does honor to the projectors; so much cannot, it
seems, be said in favor of those who had either the management of
sending or bringing out the miserables, the inhabitants of this
health-restoring mansion.</p>
<p>The no. of natives seem to be greatly diminished; the
small-pox is known to have made g. havock among them about
eighteen m's ago, and many, it is conjectured, have retreated
farther along the coast, ill-pleased with their new neighbours.
We now have very little intercourse with them, and if we now and
then do converse it is at a distance.</p>

<br>
[Extracts.]</p>
<p align="right">Outpost, Port Jackson, 27-30 July, 1790.   </p>
<p><small>I GAVE</small> your respects and thanks to Mr. Dawes
and Mr. Palmer. If you received my letters by Mr. Millar, late
Commissary, dated April, 1790, you will there have found
something in confirmation of C't'n Gilbert's account of the state
of my friendships. Indeed, Lieutenant Dawes is my most esteem'd
friend and confidant, and to his kindness and advice I am much
indebted; my acquaintance, however, is somewhat encreas'd a long
time among the officers, and there are among them many sensible
agreable men.</p>
<p>And as it is only between you and me, and I know you like such
little fid-fad, I will name a few. C't'n Campbell, the comm'd'g
officer of marines, and when here Major Ross; the author of the
printed narrative,* C't'n Tench, polite and sensible; sev'ral
others lieutenants, Mr. Worgan our surgeon, &amp;c., are all very
kind, and sometimes, when I can, I visit them; the last ment'd is
not the least in favor. He intends to bring his nightcap here and
stay with me and my lonely companion, in a solitude render'd
rather tiresome by its long duration.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany
Bay, by Captain Watkin Tench, of the Marines, London</i>, 1789.
Tench's <i>Complete Account</i> was published in 1793.]</p>
<p>I hurry if possible to get my letter closed for a ship
immediately to sail. One has just gone in which I wish'd to have
sent my packett to my uncle, but cou'd not, thanks to this out of
the way situation, 3 leagues from camp and no boat here.** What
might not happen which from such a want might be attended with
irreperable mischief! My surviving friend, Mr. Harries, and seven
people form this little settlement call'd the Look-out. These
were lately eight, but one of these, and he likewise a
favourite&mdash;poor fellow&mdash;went down with my friend. I
think, had that accident (as it did not) have happen'd here, and
our people cou'd even have managed to bring them on shore, how
still they might have died thro' our inability to give or send
for assistance immediately to camp. However, tho' I committed a
capitall offence in sev'ral times expressing my dislike to the
situation greatly&mdash;indeed wholly on this account&mdash;yet I
have just heard that a certain truly pompous personage (as Mr.
S&mdash;,*** the a'g't justly call'd him) has graciously
signified an intention of sending her down. He, with much
ill-nature and little reason, took her away long since, and this
I only reckon one of those after-claps which frequently take
place with people whose ill-nature sometimes gets the better of
their understanding, or perhaps it may proceed from some such a
reflection as mine upon the subject, and a thought that it may
become a general one.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The Justinian sailed on the 28th July, 1790,
and the Surprize on the 1st August.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Probably, the reference is to Mr. Shortland,
the Naval Agent. The "pompous personage" was evidently Governor
Phillip.]</p>
<p>Indeed, if the prospect of my seeing you were further off, I
shou'd, rather than tell you these things, grin and bear it, as
we say, but I know the joy you will affectionate'y take in this
thought, and the relyance you have in my conduct, will not allow
you to fret at it; for my part, I know I have done nothing
atrocious, and I also know that most who know me&mdash;I may say
us&mdash;agree in concluding us very indifferent'y treated.
Indeed, the Gorgon will be a shipload of trumpeters. The theme,
however, will not be praise. Many here, my friends, scruple not
to speak of his conduct in terms of the highest disgust, and they
do, it must be confess'd, bring much in support of the assertion.
I am rather vex'd at myself for being so very lavish of my
encomiums formerly, but while a shadow of appearance remain'd
that cou'd justify my sending pleasing accounts, I chose to do it
for your sakes. We are deceived, for many of much greater
consequence in the scale of affairs are in the same
predicament.</p>
<p>Thes' things, however, although I think as do those particular
friends who know what has pass'd, which was only some little
miffs about the boat, too great confinement to the spot, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., that my conduct merits not so much haughty pointed
inattention; but say they, is not this universally the case?
After all it is disagreable, and it almost puzzles me to know how
to write to Mrs. L&mdash; and Mrs. E&mdash;, which, however, I
believe I shall do in a vague manner, saving little, by which, if
they please, they may form a jud'ement.</p>
<p>I am not a little concerned what opinion my unc. B. may
entertain upon what may appear so sudden a reversion of
sentiment. It may fasten upon me the obliqy of a childish
instability of judgm't or an unsound heart; I had rather the
former than the latter. A specious conduct often extorts
unmerited encomiums, and then to retract these may for a season
bear the appearance of detraction.</p>
<p>I have once said we are deceived; I repeat it. Judge from the
following circumstance, this little story, of many that may
hereafter&mdash;nay, will be told.</p>
<p>I refer to my last by Millar. You will there find a story
related relative to our shipwreck'd young gent'n that does honor
to a certain person's humanity, generosity, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.****</p>
<p class="foot">[**** The letter to which reference is here so
obscurely made is apparently that of the 14th April. See the

<p>*   *   *  The vessel had scarcely clear'd the heads of the
harbour which convey'd mine, and I find near 10,000 eulogiums,
but down came the boat with my shipwreck'd late partakers of
noble munificence, and from that moment commenced my
fellow-prizoners, for as little better are we treated. My poor
J&mdash;&mdash;F&mdash;&mdash;, who now lays cold on the rocks,
the food, perhaps, of fishes, had a most kind invitation from C'n
Campbell to make his house a home, for that the
G&mdash;&mdash;must be crouded. When he carried the polite
proposal to our noble patron, was desired to inform
C&mdash;&mdash;C&mdash;&mdash; that there was no necessity, for
that there was plenty of room.* All this is well known, and there
are few who make not severe comments upon it.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Note in MS.:</i>&mdash; "And this from no
more liberal motives than because a picque subsisted between
C&mdash;&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash; and himself."]</p>
<p>It is even the opinion of some that knowing little has been
done for me, tho' something might by those at home be expected,
and things now coming to a crisis something must be offer'd, but
I hope not my poor [word illegible] conduct to stand the
brunt.</p>
<p>What a letter of letters was that I received from my uncle. I
was charmed with excellence in every line, cheerfull presages of
future good, charitable forbearance, and allowances for human
frailty. A Christian spirit breath's in every part throughout.
How grieved I was at the impossibility of sending him back what
would no doubt have been a most gratefull report to assure him
that here the friendly-express'd wishes of a heart, the seat of
phylanthrophy, were budding forth into the smiling forms of
realized existence. But this neither truth nor candour cou'd
allow me say; 'twould be contradicting the united voice of a
great majority. Our colony is generally reckon'd a most
unpromising concern, partly from natural unavoidable
circumstances, and partly from the want of more salutary
regulations. In all this I suspend my own judgem't, and am led by
those many, among whom there are some of, I doubt not, unbiass'd
sentiments.</p>
<p>I have been alone two days and nights, but Harris, my
tender-hearted companion and brother in the late affliction, is

<p align="center">DANIEL SOUTHWELL TO MRS. SOUTHWELL.</p>
<p align="right">Sydney, Port Jackson,          <br>
7th August, 1790.   </p>
<p>My Dear Honor'd Mother,</p>
<p>I shall begin this letter with observing to you that a more
copious one has lately set off in the Surprize for your perusal.
Nothing can be more uncertain than which of these may come first
to your hand. I think if either of my epistles, especially the
former, shou'd not reach you, how unintelligible the others must
appear. In that I have mentioned my opinion of the pompous despot
(as the Agent* justly stiled him), and also sent you the copy of
a letter I had in agitation to send him. This, by the kind delay
of friends, for whose approbation I had shewn it, is to be yet
delay'd till the Neptune, our latest ship, sails; it seems, in
their opinion, to require consideration, and I expect to give you
account of the issue by the ship as mentioned above.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Note in MS.:</i>&mdash;"Now C't'n

Southwell quotes this same remark of Shortland in his letter of
the 27-30 July (ante, p. 720). The "pompous despot" was Governor
Phillip.]</p>
<p>Our austere Govr's behaviour alters not for the better, and,
can assure you, am not disposed to speak in his praise.</p>
<p>Till my tiff with him is over, I shall not write to Mrs.
L&mdash;&mdash;e or Mrs. Ev&mdash;&mdash;tt, unless it is
determined by my good advisers to delay the presentation of my
letter till the Gorgon arrives; if so, I shall write by the
Neptune in a vague manner (to them), as I said in mine by the
Surprize of the 27-30th July, 1790, to you.</p>
<p>I have again to tell you, my d'r mother, that, in my opinion,
and that of most who know me, I have not behaved (tho' by him
used) ill, and, if you will only remain quiet, I expect, in
course of a very few mo. after you receive this, to explain
everything. I have observed in my largest letter, and now again
repeate it, that if I thought the confidence I now place in you
wou'd make you uneasy I cou'd rather grin and bear it (a phrase
with us); but, while I am not dissatisfied with myself, I hope
you, my dear, will not. And if my, wish'd on my part, and long'd
for on your part, return does not suit you, why, I can set off
again. I know your fortitude, and I know your affect'n; the first
assures me a trifle (for so I esteem unmerited inattention) will
not cast you down, and the latter tells me you will be ever ready
to receive me while untainted with any other stigma than a fickle
man's caprice. This, however, is, as yet, uncertain, and I only
mention it as knowing him capable of anything!</p>
<p>I am, at this moment, at Mr. Palmer's, Commiss'y, at 11
o'clock at night, in his house by myself, and not the heave of a
biscuit off of G. P's. I come up to make sure of my packett, of
which this, to you, is one; and he had the conscience to order me
down immediately I mentioned my having miss'd the Justinian by
being in that out-of-the-way situation at the Lookout, and that I
humbly hoped he would allow me to make sure of the Scarborough.
It was stuck to with modest warmth on my part, and at last
carried much 'gainst his will. He had no better resource than the
sly pretence of fearing my being in camp might be prejudicial to
my morals: "What did I want with wh&mdash;es and rogues?" My
answer was, warmly, being nettled, "Nothing!" and that I was
certain he cou'd have nothing of that kind to bring against my
conduct. To this he could say nothing, tho' I might, with reason,
have asked, "Why so afraid of my conduct?" which I knew no one
cou'd impeach (and I 24-25 years old!), and yet not feel one
anxious thought about his minion, his young lt., his favorite,
his darling, at least six or seven years younger, and&mdash;here
in camp at his full range!</p>
<p>But this would have been construed insolence, and I wish not
to give him a plea. How cruelly provoking would it have been to
be sent down after coming up here merely for this purpose; so
intently bent on it that, notwithstanding my severe cold, and
having been rap'd up about the head for this week past, I have
ventur'd hither with a flannel stock on, and my head in a silk
handkerchief. This I would not tell you if I was not well housed
by a good fireside, the keys of Palmer's well-stored lockers in
my possession, my head secured, and, thanks to this kind friend,
a good bed to go to, which I shall soon as I have made a glass of
warm grog, the first I have drank this week. As for my poetical
stuff, 'tis mere small beer&mdash;nasty stuff.</p>
<p>[Here follow private messages.]</p>
<p>In mine to Unc. B., I have glanced at the Gov'r by what he may
conclude a bold figure.* This goes to him by Mr. Beyer, surgeon
of the Scarborough. It has been long written and intended for the
Justinian, but I was vexatiously disappointed. The method of this
going to you is not yet certain, wether by Dr. Beyer, by C't'n
Marshall in person, or forwarded as a parcel. This, as long as
you get it, won't matter much. I draw the week's provision (this
being Saturday, 7 inst't, 2 o'clock), and shall call in my way
down on b'd the Scarboro'.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Note in MS.:</i>&mdash;"Reed of
Egypt".]</p>
<p>Apropos, the G&mdash;&mdash;r has this forenoon graciously
sent me an invitation to dine, a thing quite out of date a long
time; but as I was to eat some kid with Mr. P., I sent word I was
indisposed (he saw my flannel stock), but much obliged, &amp;c.,
of course, and also going down to the Lookout to lay by a little.
Observe, was it anything worse than a common cold I wou'd not say
anything about it in this to you; but I truly assure you that is
all, and I am a careful codger.*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>

<p align="center">EXTRACTS FROM A LETTER FROM DANIEL SOUTHWELL TO
MRS. SOUTHWELL.</p>
<p>Dated "Port Jackson, Lookout House, 20th August, 1790."</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;Mr. Alt, who probably may give you these, was till
now a shipmate, but never a particular, for reasons. He, however,
does us a great favor, and so deserves a kind reception.</p>
<p>[After recapitulating the contents of several previous
letters.]</p>
<p>However, a more agreable turn has taken place lately in
affairs, and his disagreable restrictions are taken off.* He
treats us with more affability, and is all at once so polite as
to beg of my only companion, Mr. Harris, and self, whenever we
come to camp, to let him have our co., and I am to-morrow (having
been long a stranger) to wait upon him by particular invitation,
sev'ral times repeated and hitherto declined upon account of a
cold, and being; perhaps a little sulky or so.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The reference is to Governor Phillip.]</p>
<p>But it is adviseable not to kick, and I speake it much for
your satisfaction that I shall neglect no proper methods of
courting his good graces. Nor do I mean to investigate how far
this sudden change may be the effect of reflection, caprice on
his part, or amendment on ours. If the latter, I must own he is
very good to perceive a thing so much in my favor that I remain
insensible of. But if I go on at this rate, you will think I am
either saucy or uncharitable, so I will leave you to judge of the
true causes from the deal that I have said in my other letters
upon this head, and if you there see anything concerning
after-claps, etc., and it sho'd lead you to honor my great
penetration, why thank ye.</p>
<p>Those I consult and myself have concluded it better, as
matters now stand, not to address the Agent's pompos** in
writing, at least as yet, and if at all (which will depend on
future aspects) to do it just as leaving hence for good. In
former letters you have the copy of address to G.P. alluded to,
which, of course, if ever now delivered, must undergo suitable
alterations, as I do by this conveyance write to Mrs. Everett and
Lane, and enclosed I send you what I have said to each respecting
my situation and prospects, express'd with more moderation than I
once did intend, for shou'd things, as they may now, go on more
smooth and glibly, why I might wish I had said less, as it cou'd
in fact do no good; or, shou'd they turn out as bad or even worse
than I then thought for, why then I can explain it with equal
effect.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The allusion is to Governor Phillip. See
Shortland's remark quoted by Southwell in previous letters. Ante,
pp. 720 and 722.]</p>
<p>If you do not receive my other two epistles you will certainly
be puzzled to conceive what all this means.</p>
<p>I must own, after fagging so long as mid, I shou'd much rather
not have to wear out many more mid's coats. 'Tis likely that many
are forced tho' to do so, and better fellows too. But, however, I
shan't too easily give up my hopes. Has not there been &frac12;
starvation, and, I was going to say (but it is worse than),
decimation,*** among us mids, dragged round the world, made shake
in our shoes off Tasman's Head,**** and at length deprived of our
poor old bark at Norfolk Island.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>Note in MS.:</i>&mdash;"Alluding to the
Roman method of punishing mutiny in the military by death of
every tenth man."]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** See a lengthy account of the incident by
Fowell. Vol. i, part 2, p. 374.]</p>
<p>To be sure, merit and good abilities are a better plea, but if
there are any worthy considerate old codgers at the helm they
will, it is to be hoped, let a little of this suffering hardship
go into the scales to make up. "Well, everything happens as it
falls out", as I heard a man of wonderful sagacity remark. And
who knows what may be the event.</p>

<p>When, a few days since, I talked with Sir Joseph Banks about
colony matters, he shewed me some very good ears of corn, grown
with you or at Norfolk Island. I own they surprized me, for their
quality was very promising, and beyond my hope, from a soil so
recent and unmanured. He is by no means disposed to despond of
the success of vigorous cultivation, and when a deposit of live
stock, and a good supply of stores, is established, in all other
respects I cannot but continue to think, as I have always done,
that a firm, flourishing, and advantageous settlement will be the
result of so many arduous and combined exertions. "While the
grass grows"&mdash;however, you know the rest. But neither Rome
nor New Albion can be built in rapid equality to our natural
mother of comfort and indulgence. Sir Joseph's last note to me
does you justice, for on returning me what of your correspondence
I submitted to his inspection, he adds, with many thanks for the
perusal of it, "The letters are written with intelligence, but,
as is naturally to be expected, contain little of information not
to be met with in the Governor's dispatches. It is, indeed,
surprizing that he who lives at an out-post, and makes few visits
to the camp, should have gained so much, and the more so as by
his own account he is more given to contemplation than to
company," &amp;c.</p>

<p>I have not the happiness nor the honour of knowing your
Governour, but I never shall forget the expression of my friend
Captain John Faithful Fortescue, on talking about the new
administration under such good care: "Upon my soul, Butler," said
he, "I do think God Almighty made Phillips on purpose for the
place, for never did man better know what to do, or with more
determination to see it done; and yet, if they'll let him, he
will make them all very happy." Such a compliment, and from an
officer of like rank, was too striking to escape my remembrance.
I have quoted it fifty times, and don't doubt it has been
verified a thousand.</p>

<p align="center">DANIEL SOUTHWELL TO MRS. SOUTHWELL.</p>
<p align="right">Batavia Roads,* 12th October, 1791.   </p>
<p class="foot">[* Southwell sailed from Sydney on the 28th
March, 1791, in the Waaksamheyd, with Captain Hunter and the
shipwrecked crew of the Sirius. Vol. i, part 2, pp. 466, 475, and
616-18. An account of the voyage will be found in Hunter's
<i>Historical Journal</i>, p. 214, <i>et seq</i>.]</p>
<p align="right">Mrs. Southwell, No. 19, Nicholas Lane, Cannon
Street, London,&mdash;   </p>
<p>My ever honoured and dear Mother,</p>
<p>You have received I trust some or each of my sev'ral packets
(3) which were sent you by the ships which brought so seasonable
a relief to the colony of New South Wales. By these you were
inform'd that thro' the pressing necessities of that unpromising
settlem't the Supply had sail'd for Batavia, from whence I am to
tell you she returned 19th Oct'r, 1790, her arrival being
followed on 18 Dec'r by the Waaksaamheidt, snow, also from that
place, laden with provisions. The last of our ships from England
had sail'd (viz., Neptune, and by which I sent you letters) many
days prior to the coming of either.</p>
<p>The Supply, brigg, in due time was sent to Norf. I'd for the
crew of the Sirius, and the Governor took up the snow in the
meantime on acc't of Governm't to carry us all to England. His
bargain, however, in the general opinion, appears to have been
injudicious, and indeed next to ridiculous in every respect; we,
indeed, have felt its many inconveniences with a vengeance. I,
myself, in the earliest instance, had so great an objection to
the ship herself, as considering her ill-calculated, &amp;c.,
that notwithstand'g the impatience with which I long'd to be
sailing towards ye, and the little reason I had (of which I
sufficiently told you) to relish my situation there, I cou'd
gladly have staid behind for another chance, which I often and
often said while there, having then I cou'd almost imagine a sort
of presentiment of what was to happen. But a much better judge,
viz., C't'n Hunter, entertained a similar opinion, and I
understand express'd it in the strongest manner; but reason was
in this, as in many other instances, probably overruled by other
motives. It is a charitable construction, which, however, can
suit but one, that the indecent manner in which we appear'd to
have been ship'd off might proceed from the fear of again having
many mouths and little to feed them; nor might the panic be
altogether unfounded, for when we sail'd nothing more had
arrived&mdash;no Gorgon! the long-expected, and a short time must
bring them to the old discipline of short allow'e. But what we
most complain of in this admired contract is that in every
respect the advantage lyes on the side of the Dutchman (C.S.)
[Captain Smith], in a manner most degrading to the dignity of our
capt'n. Here it is stipulated that in every operation we shall
assist, and only vaguely provided that he (Smith) is to perform
the engagement of conveying us to England; thus C.H. is left to
have his opinions, but without the power in any case to enforce
them&mdash;of this I believe he has often felt and deeply
regretted the inconvenience&mdash;however, there are those who
consider him (C.H.) as having himself chiefly to thank for having
too tamely engaged in a situation of which he seems to have been,
or might have been, sufficiently aware. The Gov'r, who perhaps
considered getting us away at any rate as the grand object, and
only one worth securing, contented himself with accepting the
flattering but insecure assurances of C.S. how he meant to
conduct himself, and instead of securing all by written
articles,* contented himself (G.) with as readily transmitting
this idle nonsense to C.H., when he ought to have reflected on
the many previous instances he had had to convince him of the
unamiable character of the man who in the universally-express'd
opinion of all at P't Jackson was void of principle, and in every
sense a sordid D'hman, and sway'd by every narrow motive of
self-interest.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Note in the MS.:</i>&mdash;"Of these there
are many, but on the <i>right wrong</i> side."]</p>
<p>However, on the 29th of March we sailed,** and were to have
call'd at Norf. Island, but were prevented by contrary winds,
which they probably regret on acc't of there l's [their letters],
and we also, as we might probably have got sev'ral useful
articles from the old ruined ship*** which might have been of
signal use to us in this. We next saw the Isle of Pines on the
23rd April, 1791, which not being able to weather occasion'd us
to bear up, running down the coast of New Caledonia; how'er, in
the evening we perceived we had fallen into a very foul and
dangerous bay, full of scatter'd shoals, and reefs, and small
islands. The w'r was now moderate, and we immediately haul'd our
wind. It freshened, however, to a gale during the night, and thus
were we continued flying about under a press of sail, in great
uncertainty, until daylight, which only gave us sight of the
greatness of our danger, and thereby confirmed the reality of
what anxiety had but too faithfully imaged during night; however,
we had the good fortune to w'r this reef, which is 30 miles in
extent, being at times only 2 miles from it. The ship is a most
miserable sailer, works very bad, and had not this shole
providentialy somewhat alter'd its direction, which enabled us to
clear it, we must inevitably have gone!**** It was fearful to see
the high foaming breakers how they rose, while the spray raised
by its raging hover'd above like smoak. In our way from hence to
New Ireland we met with several shoals and islands, most likely
before unknown. Our intention was to have water'd in Carteret's
or Gower's Harbour on that coast, but unfortunately we fell in
with the land to leward of the latter, and to our great
mortification we overshot the former; there appears to have been
some error in the printed chart. Our wants would not allow of our
quitting the place without that very necessary article, and after
sev'ral fruitless attempts, both on this and New Britain, we at
length found a convenient inlet on the Duke of York's I'd, lying
nearly in the middle between them, in St. George's Channel, after
having sounded round great part of it, and almost desp'd of
finding anchoring ground; indeed, the shores of all three are
remarkably steep. What delightful tracts are here! especially New
Brittain, a country charming in appearance beyond description,
abounding in excellent fruits and roots, and no doubt indented
with excellent harbours if closely examined. Every way how much
more eligibly circumstan'd for a colony than that with which poor
England is so sadly and expensively engaged!</p>
<p class="foot">[** According to Hunter, the vessel sailed on the
morning of the 28th March.&mdash;Historical Journal, p. 215.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The Sirius.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** <i>Note in MS.:</i>&mdash;"How near the
anniversary of our memorable escape of Tasman's Head!"]</p>
<p>While watering at this island we saw, amongst other things,
that it produced plenty of cocoanuts, bananas, plantains; the
bread-fruit was seen, and sev'ral of which we know not the name;
they also had swine and the common breed of fowls domesticated;
their canoes were of neatest workmanship, the weapons, slings and
stones, and spears. They had an idea of estate and property, by
their little spots being surrounded with fence-work. We were here
but little more than three days; before we completed our water, a
skirmish with the natives took place, in which, as 'tis said,
they were the aggressors. We had a stout party arm'd, part on
shore, immediatly on the spot where water was filling, and part
lay off in a boat to cover the rest while at work. They never
seem'd to like our operations from the first. I lament to think
what sad execution probably took place, for, as tho' the muskets,
of which were near a score, were not sufficient, this inhuman
Hollander continued playing upon them with round and grape shot
from the ship till every one that had a spark of anything human
in his breast cried shame on it. Many of these he fired on them,
tho' in the act of aiming at a reconciliation, which, however,
his madness would not allow to take place till late next day,
when these poor persequeted beings came down unarm'd, bearing a
peace-making present, composed of something of almost every
production they had. The morn'g we sail'd being May 27&mdash;many
canoes were on b'd, and we parted in a friendly manner.* About
the middle of June we began to be sensible of the influence of a
most extraordinary current, which for six-and-twenty days
continued obstinately setting us to the eastw'd, and here, to our
inexpressible disappointment, we continued between the parallels
of 3.00 N. and 6&deg; 30' N., and nearly in the same longitude,
viz., 140&deg; 00' E, tho' continually going to the westward by
the log account, which was a flattering deception, and detected
by the lunar observations, to whom, tho' they certifyed us of a
disagreable truth, we are much indebted, as they shew'd us our
true place, from which our reckoning wou'd have been very wide;
the sum of this unwelcome delay amounting to considerably more
than 600 miles. The consequence was that C.H. held a
consultation, in which it was deem'd necess'y to go to
half-allow'e (being before at little more than two-thirds), and
also to bear up and run for China; with this C.S. was officially
acquainted by letter, which he accordingly did and agreed to,
tho' probably never designing really to do so. It was now 12
July, and for a short time we were flatter'd with tolerable
winds. It presently pleased him to change his mind for Manilla,
as being the nearest port, which also was relinquish'd after a
tedious tryal, in which both bad w'r and perverse currents
combin'd to keep us from approaching nearer than within 60
leagues of Cape Espirito Sancto. Provisions now run very short,
and the prospect of gaining any port to recruit very precarious;
the ill qualities of our ship very discouraging, especially as
our track must lay thro' latitudes plagued with calms; the
climate, too, very hot, and water scarce, tho' rice formed a
principal part of our meagre diet! All this, with our many
subsequent disappointments and delays, cou'd not, as you may
imagine, but cause uneasiest reflections. August was now begun,
and now we run to the southward, and in a few days it transpired
that we shou'd touch at Mindanao, and try to get water and obtain
a little rice. This we made 6 Aug't. Spoke a canoe, 10th, from
whom (with our usual luck) we learn'd they had but little rice.
They, however, ask'd for and rec'd a letter to the rajah or
prince. They belong'd to Hummock Island, lying 4, or 3, or 5
leagues to southw'd of Mindanao, and we came too off this place
the next day at noon. Here, however, we made but a wretched
addition to our stock of rice; in water we succeeded better while
here. Tho' the stay so short, yet it must be confess'd the
refreshment was great, not permanent. Choice fruits and fowls
were in abundance. The afternoon we sail'd, for we were here but
three days, I lament to tell you we had a sad quarrel with these
worthy people (for such in every respect they seem'd to be). C.S.
had, with his usual injustice, from the time of our first
arrival, hinted that if he found any difficulty in getting what
he wanted he would make the rajah a prisoner, and thus extort it.
This is quite sufficient as presumtive evidence to determine all
(whatever he may say) in my breast as to what followed. Suffice
it to say, the rajah, on coming on b'd, and having no doubt seen
enough of S. to raise his suspicions, refused to go below, but
took a chair on deck. C.S. speaks their tongue well, and (as one
of the rajah's attendants half-drew his cross) I doubt not
utter'd some threat'ning speech. The rajah, however, with much
prudence and moderation, check'd this effusion of loyalty; but
S., void of either, instead of forwarding that accomodation which
might doubtless have taken place, loudly call'd for arms. (I am
assured that previously to the squabble he had sent for cutlasses
before the rajah's face!) These were too soon emp'd, I fear, in
the most destructive manner. All retreated over the quarter into
the State prowe, and even those out of the canoes who were
engaged in traffick in her, therefore must have been near an 100,
and upon these unhappy men did our savage, true to his charter,
continue firing, willingly assisted too by some of my no less
barbarous countrymen. The usual doses of round and grape shot
were also liberally administer'd upon the occasion. Wretched
sporting with human lives! and for what? a quarrel&mdash;too
like'y entirely of his own making. Why pursue them too with such
inveterecy? Not one of us hurt, and they only seeking how to
escape. Indeed, had the rajah's bravery been but seconded some of
us would no doubt have had our deserts, for no sooner had he
gain'd his boat and found how irretrievably things were situated
than he threw a launce or two (shock'd, no doubt, and fill'd with
horror and resentment at behaviour which must appear so full of
cruelty, villany, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.&mdash;they had also
bows and arrows formidable and sure), and immediate'y himself
took an oar, and through't was seen nobly endeavoring to recall
the spirits of his people, no doubt very panick-struck at such an
unexpected and undeserved attack. This much-injured and very
unfortunate man at length got out of our reach, round that part
of the i'd whence he came, and I hope unhurt, tho' I fear that is
next to impossible. Indeed, I feel the deepest regret when I
consider our obligations to his goodness in readily issuing his
permission for his people to trafick, and in readily assisting us
in getting our water fill'd, &amp;c., &amp;c. But clear of all
this there was something in his carriage full of mildness and
goodness.** I must now leave him to inform you of our further
progress. In two days we made the most south'y of the
Phillipines, and shaped our course for the N.W. p't of the large
Island of Celebes, between which and the great Island Borneo lyes
the Straits of Macassar. In seventeen days after seeing the
former we were all but through, having nearly fetch'd the south
end of Borneo, which forms the extremity of the strait; and this
clear'd we had the pleasing prospect of immediately falling in
with the monsoon, which being a prevailing and fair wind would
soon run us in with Java; but disappointment had not yet done
with us, and the beggarly want of being a mile or two more to
windward occasioned no less than a week's delay. Our poor success
at Mindanao caused us soon to go upon a yet more reduced
allowance, and our continual cravings were but heightened by the
tantalizing pictures of former plenty and profusion which in
these cases will forcibly intrude. Maugre all the rules of the
sages who, in the midst of plenty, have said and written such
excellent things upon the virtue of rigid abstemiousness, never
let me hear again of the boys finding fault with the ***sop or
pop, as they saucily call'd it, when not just to their liking. I
tell you that even now, and often and often, I would go mast-high
for one of those cans of it.</p>

<p>[Here follow three pages on Southwell's state of health, and
his prospects of success if he enters, as advised, on another
profession.]</p>
<p>The rest of our run from Straits of Macassar was pleasant and
expeditious, consider'g; and excepting being somewhat in danger
from sev'ral waterspouts, whose very near approach obliged us to
fire sev'ral guns at them, we met with nothing very worthy of
note. This dreadful and extraordinary phenomenon is well
described in Cook's voyage by Mr. Forster, but they had only one
to keep them in tribulation, we had sev'ral, and also whirlwinds;
and, tho' within very few leagues of Batavia at this time, there
is little doubt had they taken us but a sad catastrophe would
have finish'd our so long unprosperous career. There has lately
been a sad sickness here, and here are many fine ships in want of
hands to carry them to Europe. One or more of these, we
understand, will convey us hence, there being a particular clause
which prevents the snow (being country-built) from coming into
our seas. This we think no misfortune, as we probably may now
enjoy something like free air, room, and convenience. We arrived
26 Sept'r, '91, with more healthy follks on b'd than lately was
in their city. Mr. Worgan has not yet determined wether the shore
or on b'd will better further my almost recovered health in this
state of convalescence, the latter most likely at such a season.
In other respects the place is excellent, yielding a thousand
refres'm'ts. My appetite is, probably, in too good order, and I
shall exert my prudence in that and I trust every other species
of temperance; it is here peculiarly essential.</p>
<p>I cannot sufficiently exp. my approbation of your good sense
in forbidding those who perused to publish my insignificant
narrative; or my chagrin at their improper conduct who have,
notwithstanding, taken the liberty to do so. I saw it, being the
concluding part, in the <i>Hampshire Chron. and Portsmo. and
Chiches'r Journal</i>, Sept'r 7, 1789. Mr. W.,* since we were at
sea, came across it, and from peculiarity of stile immediately
recognized it, as did most of our principals on b'd. I add that I
am vex'd at it for sev'ral reasons, and pray you to take care who
you honour with a sight of my cobweb productions, if this is the
way they honour them. Apropos! that date is the anniversary of
the Governor's misfortune of the year 1790,** when he was spear'd
by a native in Manly Bay, in a manner which savours much of
imprudence next to folly. Bennalon, as I said in my letters, had
made his escape, and this was the first interview since that
incident. It, however very near fatal, proved by no means so, as
he soon recover'd, and it was followed by the fullest intercourse
with these people, insomuch that they eat, drink, and sleep in
the camp with the most perfect <i>sang froid</i>; and some of
their dames, like too many of ours, gladly forego the d'r
pleasure of nursing their own bratts, and leave them in perfect
security to the care of sever'l of the convict women, who are
suitably rewarded by the Governor.</p>

all sailed, the Neptune last; Mr. Alt with my packett."]</p>
<p>Since here we have learn'd that the two French ships on
discovery have not been further heard of since our seeing them in
Botany Bay, a poor young fellow having been on b'd to enquire
after them; his brother was an officer in one of them. His ship
left France but thirteen mo. since, and is now bound to the Isle
of France or Maurittias. We have heard of England's
respectability in the scale of politicks, fine times in the Navy,
and we out of the way; also we learn that Mr. King was lately at
the Cape with six or eight transports bound for New Holland,***
and that poor Miller, the Comiss'y, died on his way home on b'd
the packett. It must be observed that my letters, both to my
uncle and yourself, are only concise abridgements, tho' nothing
material is omitted. I, however, keep a private account of
remarkable occurrences in which I am more copious, which,
whenever it pleases God Almighty I should return, I'll shew ye.
The Governor, at leave-taking, after a few encomiums on my
prudent deportment, good sence, parts, &amp;c., lamenting it had
not been in his power effectually to serve me, &amp;c., concluded
with recommending it to me to quit the Line&mdash;they are all
you see in a story&mdash;happy no doubt at the app'e (for it is
but an appearance) of so easily acquitting himself. He had he
said hinted as much to Mrs. Everett in his letter. I gave him no
reason to think that I felt myself obliged by that part of the
story, and only answer'd him by begging he would recollect my
time lost in the service, my connection by no means affluent, and
other difficulties. In reply I had a repetition of stale comp'ts,
abilities very equal to something respectable in some other way,
and wound all up by saying with some warmth (it may be genuine)
that shou'd he return, and the gleam of any possibility of his
serving me offer, he would most heartily and gladly do it in any
part of the world or situation whatever.</p>

<h3>D. SOUTHWELL'S MEMORIAL.*</h3>
<br>
<p class="foot">[* Rough draft of memorial sent to the
Admiralty.]</p>
<p align="center">To the Right Hon'ble and Hon'ble the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty.</p>
<p>The humble memorial of Daniel Southwell respectfully
sheweth,&mdash;</p>
<p>That your Lordships' memorialist has for several years (12
save about 3 weeks) belonged to his Majesty's Royal Navy, and
went out as midshipman, being early in the passage out appointed
master's mate of his Ma'ty's ship Sirius, Arthur Phillip, Esqr.,
commander, and Jno. Hunter, Esqr., 2d captain, to Port Jackson,
in New South Wales.</p>
<p>That previous to his setting out on that voyage your
memorialist passed his examination in due form and with success,
as to his qualifications for lieutenant in his Ma'ty's service,
whenever it shou'd please your Lords's to confer that honour upon
him.</p>
<p>That during the said voyage of almost five years out and home,
fill'd with a variety of trying and distressing circumstances,
your memorialist humbly trusts his conduct, as also his
professional abilities, will on inquiry be found to have been
such as may render him in your Lordships' judgment not unworthy
of your Lordships' patronage and favour.</p>
<p>Which your memoralist very humbly begs leave to submit to your
Lordships' consideration. And for your Lordships' great
indulgence to his request will think himself ever bound to
express his utmost gratitude.</p>
<p>May,
1792.                    &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

<p align="center">SIR JOSEPH BANKS TO THE REV. W. BUTLER.</p>
<p align="right">Soho Square, 13th May, 1792.   </p>
<p>Rev'nd Sir,</p>
<p>I am sorry I was so much engaged when you did me the honor of
a call on Saturday as not to have it in my power to wait upon
you, and still more so that [was under the necessity of setting
out for Windsor so early yesterday morn that I had not time to
prevent your nephew from the trouble he had, I hear, in calling
upon me as he intended.</p>
<p>Had I, sir, any pretentions to interfere with the department
of Admiralty deriv'd from Parliamentary interest, or, rather, had
I a sufficient share of influence to be able to provide for those
who from having sail'd in the same ship with me, or from their
fathers having done so, have a founded claim to the little
protection I have it in my power to afford, I should willingly
have undertaken the cause of your nephew, altho' I have not the
honor of being known to him; but as such is my case, that having
nothing but a little private friendship with those who guide the
department to offer as a reason for my making applications,
several of my own old shipmates are not at this moment in the
situation in which I wish to see them, and to which their
services, in my opinion, fairly entitle them.</p>
<p>Under these circumstences, I hope you, sir, will excuse me for
declining the charge of your nephew's memorial&mdash;indeed, were
I to take it, I should not venture to hope that my name in the
business would be of much avail; but, sir, was I to ask a boon at
this time of the Admiralty, it would be in favor of Cpt. Cook's
son, who, tho' his father's name stands higher in the opinion of
the nation than that of any former youngster has ever done, is
still a lieut. of many years' standing.</p>
<p align="right">Believe me, &amp;c.,<br>
JOS. BANKS.   </p>
