<p>PRODUCTION NOTES:</p>
<p>This report has been prepared using OCR. There are no marginal
notes in this book. The headings of Bigge's Chapters I and III
have been omitted in the hard copy; the Contents place them on
pages 1 and 78; their postions have been estimated here.</p>
<p>Bigge's idiosyncratic spellings, notably "Macquarrie" and
"Paramatta", are retained throughout. The only changes to the
text have been some modernisation of the punctuation and
corrections of a few typos (e.g. Sorel).</p>
<p>To give the Report context, Bigge's Instructions from Earl
Bathurst (via a despatch to Governor Macquarie) have been
included as an Addendum. In this work, Enclosure 4. is most
pertinent. The documents are taken from "Historical Records of
Australia", Series 1, Volume <i>X</i>, published by the Library
Committee Of The Commonwealth Parliament, 1917.</p>
<p>Bigge often refers to an Appendix; this is a large series of
documents which has never been printed in full. Parts only of
this Appendix may be found in "Historical Records of Australia",
Series 3, Volume III, pp. 215-922 (concerning Van Diemen's Land)

<br>
<p>   MY LORD,</p>
<p><small>IN</small> submitting to your Lordship the result of my
Inquiries into the state of the Criminal and Civil Judicature of
New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, I will first briefly
advert to the authority, by virtue of which those Establishments
have been created.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a></p>
<h3>[<i>On the state of the Criminal and Civil Judicature of New
South Wales, and Van Diemen's Land</i>]</h3>
<br>
<p>The statute of the 27 Geo. III. c. 2. which was passed for the
purpose of enabling his Majesty to establish a court of Criminal
Judicature on the eastern coast of New South Wales and parts
adjacent, after reciting that his Majesty had by two several
orders in council, dated 6th December 1786, judged fit to declare
and appoint the place to which certain offenders therein named
should be transported, to be the eastern coast of New South
Wales, or some one or other of the islands adjacent, enacted that
it should be lawful for his Majesty, by his commission under the
great seal, to authorize the person to be appointed governor, or
lieutenant-governor, in the absence of the governor of such place
as aforesaid, to convene from time to time, as occasion might
require, a court of judicature for the trial and punishment of
all such outrages and misbehaviours as if committed within this
realm would be deemed and taken, according to the laws of this
realm, to be treason or misprision thereof, felony or
misdemeanor. The court to consist of the judge advocate, to be
appointed in and for such place, together with six officers of
his Majesty's forces by sea or land.</p>
<p>By the letters patent, dated the 2d April 1787, it was
provided that a court of criminal jurisdiction should be
established within the colony or settlement aforesaid, meaning
thereby the places to which his Majesty had already appointed by
his order in council that felons should be transported. The
constitution of the court was conformable to the directions of
the statute, and it was declared to have the power that is given
under that statute to proceed in a more summary way than was used
within the realm according to its known and established laws.</p>
<p>In consequence of the establishment of Norfolk Island as a
receptacle for convicts, and the difficulty of finding a
sufficient number of officers there to constitute a criminal
court according to the directions of the statute, a special
authority was given to his Majesty by the statute of 35 Geo. III.
c. 18, to empower the lieutenant-governor of Norfolk Island to
hold criminal courts in that dependency, consisting of the judge
advocate of that place, and only four military or naval
officers.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction and constitution of the criminal court in New
South Wales has received no alteration whatever since the date of
the letters patent of the 2d April 1787, for those of the 4th of
February of the year 1814, only recite that part of the former
patent that related to the construction and appointment of the
criminal court, but made no change either in its construction
mode of procedure, or in the extent of its jurisdiction. This
extent remains limited at present by the orders in council of the
6th December 1786, and comprises the whole eastern coast of New
South Wales and the islands adjacent; for your Lordship will
observe, that his Majesty was authorized by the statute of the 27
Geo. III. c. 2, to establish courts of criminal jurisdiction in
any part of the eastern coast of New South Wales, or some one or
other of the islands adjacent, to which he had been pleased to
direct, by an order in council, that convicts should be
transported.</p>
<p>Doubts appear to have arisen as to the application of the term
"islands adjacent", and whether they comprehended any other than
those that were adjacent to the eastern coast. The insular
position of Van Diemen's Land, the only island to which convicts
have been sent since the establishment of Norfolk Island, had not
been ascertained till several years after the statute was passed,
and it was found to be adjacent to the southern and not to the
eastern coast of New South Wales.</p>
<p>After consulting Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde and Mr. Justice
Field upon this point, and having found that although a criminal
court had never been held in Van Diemen's Land, yet that capital
offences committed there had at all times since its establishment
been tried by the criminal court at Sydney, I did not consider
that the terms to which I have alluded were sufficient to prevent
the continued exercise of criminal jurisdiction over Van Diemen's
Land, and Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde on my suggestion proceeded
thither accordingly, and held criminal courts in the year
1821.</p>
<p>Such were the powers under which the criminal courts have
exercised jurisdiction in New South Wales and its dependencies.
No power however was given by the 27 Geo. III c. 2, or any
subsequent statute, to authorize his Majesty to establish any
form of civil judicature in New South Wales, although a
declaration was made both in that Act of Parliament, and in the
first commission that was granted under the privy seal on the 2d
April 1787, of the necessity of establishing in it a colony and
civil government, and although the form of civil judicature that
was traced and established in that commission was as great a
departure from the laws and usages of the realm of England as
that of the criminal judicature.</p>
<p>The authority therefore under which the civil judicature of
New South Wales and its dependencies have hitherto, and still
continue, to exercise their functions, is derived solely from the
commissions that have been issued under his Majesty's letters
patent.</p>
<p>The alteration that was effected by the last commission and
letters patent, dated the 4th February 1814, considered of a
separation of the civil and criminal judicatures, that had
previously been united under the presidency of one person holding
the office of judge advocate, and of the appointment of three new
civil courts, two of which, viz. the Governor's Court in New
South Wales, and the Lieutenant-Governor's Court in Van Diemen's
Land, were instituted for the trial of all causes where the sum
in dispute should not exceed 50<i>l</i>. sterling.</p>
<p>The first of these is composed of the judge advocate of the
territory of New South Wales, and two inhabitants appointed by
the governor.</p>
<p>The second is composed of the deputy judge advocate of Van
Diemen's Land and two inhabitants, who are appointed by the
lieutenant-governor of that dependency.</p>
<p>Another alteration consisted of the establishment of the
Supreme Court, composed of one judge, appointed by commission
under his Majesty's royal sign manual, and two of the magistrates
of the colony, appointed by precept under the hand of the
governor, or in his absence of the lieutenant-governor.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court takes cognizance of all causes wherein the
cause of action exceeds the sum of 50<i>l</i>. sterling,
exercises the powers of a court of equity, and also that of
granting probates of wills and letters of administration. The
powers and constitution of the Criminal Court of New South Wales
underwent no alteration at the time of issuing the new letters
patent in the year 1814, and they remain altogether in the same
state in which they were first constituted by the letters patent
of the year 1787.</p>
<p>The Governor's Court, as established under the new patent of
1814, was not opened until January 1816, in consequence of the
long illness of Mr. Judge Advocate Bent. At his death, which vas
an event that appears to have excited universal regret in the
colony, Mr. F. Garling, one of the solicitors that had been
authorized to proceed thither to practise in the courts, was
appointed by Governor Macquarrie to the office of judge advocate.
The Governor's Court was then opened for the first time in the
month of January 1816, and Mr. Garling, adopted the rules of
practice and the scale of fees that had been drawn up and fixed
by Mr. Judge Advocate Bent, and that are to be found in the
Appendix.</p>
<p>The mode of procedure introduced by these regulations was more
complex than befitted the limited jurisdiction or the nature of
the functions of the Governor's Court and soon after his arrival
in the month of October 1816, Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde made
certain alterations, both in the proceedings as well as in the
fees, that have had the effect of simplifying the practice and of
adapting it more nearly to the purpose for which the court was
originally intended, the easy recovery of small debts.</p>
<p>Amongst these regulations is a government and general order,
issued by Governor Macquarrie at the instance of the judge
advocate and the judge of the Supreme Court, and dated the 17th
of June 1817, whereby the days for assembling the several courts
in New South Wales were declared to be fixed; and those of the
Governor's Court were to take place on the first days of the
month of January, April, July and October in each year.</p>
<p>These periods or sittings have been denominated "terms" in the
regulations of the Governor's Court, and are declared to extend
to twenty-four days after each day of assembling. The days of the
sitting of the court in each week being Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays.</p>
<p>For the purpose of giving the utmost summary effect, as was
declared, to the jurisdiction of this court, subsequent orders
have been issued, by which it was to be held, according to its
own directions and notice, at the towns of Paramatta, Windsor and
Liverpool; and courts have occasionally been held at two of these
places, whenever a sufficient number of causes was entered to
justify that proceeding. With a view to give further facility to
the recovery of small debts, the Governor's Court has been
assembled on one day in every month for the trial of causes under
5<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the several rules that have been adopted by Mr.
Judge Advocate Wylde, and sanctioned by the members of his court,
it is competent to any person, delivering to the clerk and
registrar of the judge advocate's office, a note in writing,
containing the nature of his demand, accompanied with an
affidavit of debt if it exceeds 10<i>l</i>. to cause a warrant to
be issued to the defendant, requiring his appearance on the day
upon which the writ is returnable. Upon presenting these demands
to the clerk and registrar of the Governor's Court, such
instructions are given as enable him to give a short and
technical description to the demand, and a note and entry of it
is made by him in a book kept in his office. If the defendant
appears and denies the debt on entry of the plaint for trial, it
comes on before the court to be heard, or in failure of the
defendant's appearance it is heard <i>ex parte</i>.</p>
<p>It was ordered in the month of March 1817, that in all causes
where the sum in dispute should exceed 10<i>l</i>. both parties
should be assisted by solicitors, who were entitled to receive
for that assistance the sum of one guinea, which was to be
increased in case they had been retained for the suit, but not to
exceed the sum of two guineas for assistance in court. This order
was subsequently altered by one bearing date the 6th November
1818, wherein it was ordered that any person should have liberty
personally to plead or defend a suit, but should be only assisted
in the examinations of their witnesses by the solicitors of the
court. This order is now known to be the subsisting one,
otherwise the ambiguity, with which a subsequent order, dated on
the 11th March 1819, and again repeated on the 15th November of
the same year was expressed, leaves it doubtful to what part of
the cause the assistance of the solicitors was intended to be
limited.</p>
<p>By the return of causes that have been tried in this court
from the month of October 1816 to the end of October 1819, it
appears that six hundred and ninety-seven causes exceeding
5<i>l</i>. in amount have been tried there, in which sums
amounting to 13,827<i>l</i>. 15<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. have been
recovered; and that the greatest number of causes tried in any
one year amounted to three hundred and eighty-four. The number of
causes not exceeding 5<i>l</i>. in value, tried within the same
period, amounted to five hundred and twenty-four; and the
greatest number in any one year amounted to two hundred and
twenty.</p>
<p>It further appears, that upon complaints of the higher amount
that have been issued from the month of October 1816 to the end
of the Easter sittings of the year 1820, one thousand one hundred
and thirty-seven summonses have been issued, and seven hundred
and twenty-five causes have been tried; and in those of the
smaller amount, five hundred and ninety-one summonses have been
issued, and three hundred and eighty-two causes have been
tried.</p>
<p>The business in the Governor's Court has been in some degree
diminished by the fleet of a proclamation that was issued by
Governor Macquarrie at the suggestion of Mr. Justice Field on the
21st November 1815, whereby the same power that is given to
magistrates in England by the statute of the 20 Car. II. c. 19,
to decide questions arising upon wages and contracts for labour
in husbandry, and under the sum of 10<i>l</i>. is extended to the
magistrates of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The persons who have been selected and appointed by Governor
Macquarrie to act as members of the Governor's Court have
consisted of the principal merchants of the town of Sydney; and
when the court has been held at Paramatta and Windsor, the
magistrates at those places or of the neighbourhood have
performed the duty, with the exception of the instance to which I
have already had occasion to allude, of the appointment of Mr.
Richard Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>In cases where either of the assistant members have been found
to have an interest in a cause, they have declined taking a part
in the proceedings; and the course pursued by the judge advocate,
in ordinary cases, has been, to state to them the application of
the law to the points that occur in each ease, but to refrain
from giving his opinion upon the facts until those of the two
members had been declared. Differences of opinion between the
judge advocate and the assistant members have not been frequent,
and the questions that are generally presented to the decision of
the court are of a very simple kind.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, as well as that
of Mr. Justice Field, that there exists a very strong inclination
amongst the emancipated convicts in New South Wales, to prefer
the employment of solicitors who belong to that class; and Mr.
Wylde has been given to understand by information proceeding
indirectly from some of them, that the business in the Governor's
Court would have been greatly increased if they had once more
been permitted to conduct it.</p>
<p>The causes to which he as well as Mr. Justice Field have
attributed this disposition have unquestionably had their effect
in producing it; but I think that the want of activity in the
solicitors that are now practising, and their general
incompetence to discharge the duties of advocates, together with
the expense that their employment occasions, have materially
contributed to diminish the quantity of business in the
Governor's Court.</p>
<p>The fees of this court that are payable to the judge advocate
and registrar have been considerably reduced from the scale at
which they were fixed by the regulations of Mr. Judge Advocate
Bent in 1815, and that were acted upon by Mr. Garling during the
period in which he held that office, but they still bear a very
high proportion to the amount of the sums recovered.</p>
<p>By the first schedule of fees that was proposed by Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde, and approved by the members of his court, the
charge made in his office for the summons and examination only of
a complaint for the recovery of a sum not exceeding 1<i>l</i>.,
was 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.; and at Windsor and Paramatta it was
8<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. The first charge was reduced, upon the
suggestion of Governor Macquarrie to the judge advocate in the
year 1819, to the sum of 5<i>s</i>.; it continues at that rate at
present; and for causes above 1<i>l</i>. and not exceeding
3<i>l</i>. it amounts to 10<i>s</i>.; and for causes above
3<i>l</i>. and not exceeding 5<i>l</i>. it amounts to 12<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>The average amount of fees taken in the judge advocate's
office in causes above 5<i>l</i>. is stated by the clerk and
registrar to amount to 2<i>l</i>. 5<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.; and in
the Appendix is an account furnished by his order, to the
magistrate's clerk at Windsor, for fees due upon a cause tried
there, not exceeding 15<i>l</i>. the amount of which is
4<i>l</i>. 4<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. including a charge for an extra
fee in coming to Windsor, that is not authorized by any known
rule of the court, and amounting to 1<i>l</i>. 1<i>s</i>.</p>
<p>The fees taken by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde upon the
proceedings of his court, together with those that arise in his
office upon detainers and giving certificates of no detainers,
those that arise upon the registry of deeds and upon notarial
business, are received by his clerk, Mr. J. J. Moore, to whom he
allows a sum sufficient to augment the annual salary of
80<i>l</i>. that he derives from the parliamentary estimate, to
that of 300<i>l</i>. Per annum. The respective amounts of these
fees are stated in the returns made by Mr. J. J. Moore; and the
aggregate amount that has been received from the month of October
1816 to the 24th June 1820, is stated by him to have been
3,896<i>l</i>. 17<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>The circumstances that prevented the opening of the supreme
court of civil jurisdiction having been detailed in the evidence
that has been submitted to the Parliamentary Committee on Gaols,
I do not think it necessary to repeat them. The injury that was
sustained by individuals from the want of any tribunal in which
causes o a larger amount than 50<i>l</i>. could be tried, was
very great; and it did not cease to operate from the suspension
of the functions of the Governor's Court at the end of the year
1814, till the arrival of Mr. Justice Field in February 1817.</p>
<p>The causes that have been tried in the Supreme Court from that
period, until the end of the month of December 1820, have not
been numerous; for including those tried at Van Diemen's Land on
the first circuit made to that dependency by Mr. Justice Field in
1819, and amounting to twelve, they do not exceed one hundred and
sixty-five. Two-thirds of these causes appear to have arisen upon
simple contact debts, and upon notes or bills, and very few have
occurred in which any difficult questions have arisen.</p>
<p>The causes entered in the equity jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court, in the same period, amounted to forty-three, out of which
thirteen have been heard and decided, and thirty were still
pending in the year 1821. The number of judgments entered up on
warrants of attorney and confessions have amounted to one hundred
and sixty. The mode of proceeding in the Supreme Court in New
South Wales, is similar in every respect to the forms of the
courts of common law and equity in England. The pleadings in each
cause are engrossed on parchment, and are delivered to the judge
before the trial. The court is composed of the judge, and two
magistrates appointed by the governor, one of whom and the judge
are sufficient to constitute the court.</p>
<p>The changes in the members of the Supreme Court have not been
numerous: no change would have been practicable without
occasioning considerable inconvenience to magistrates in the
country, until the appointment of two new magistrates, Captain
Piper and Doctor Harris, in the month of March 1819.</p>
<p>The clerk of Mr. Justice Field, Mr. J. Gurner, acts as
registrar of the court, and as judge's marshal. In the year 1819
five solicitors practised before the Supreme Court; two of them,
viz. Mr. Garling and Mr. Moore, were appointed by your Lordship
to proceed to New South Wales in the year 1814, and the former
received a salary of 300<i>l</i>. per annum from the period in
which he ceased to act as judge advocate; and Mr. Moore received
in the month of November 1819, the arrears of his salary, that
had been suspended from the 23d February 1816.</p>
<p>Mr. Wylde, who received an appointment from His Majesty to the
office of clerk of the peace and solicitor to the crown,
practises as a solicitor in the Supreme Court, but has abstained
from practising in the Governor's Court. Mr. Amos, who was
regularly bred and admitted an attorney of the Court of King's
Bench in England, arrived in the colony in the year 1817, and was
admitted and continued to practise in the courts of New South
Wales until the month of August 1819, when he was ordered to be
struck off the roll of attornies of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Mr. Norton, who received a professional education in England,
arrived in the year 1818, with his family, and has been admitted
to practise. Upon the suspension of Mr. Amos, in the month of
August 1819, an order of court was made, by which George
Crossley, who had formerly been a convict, was permitted to
proceed as the attorney of all such clients of Mr. Amos, as had
suits depending before the Supreme Court; and all the papers and
securities of such clients as signified their desire to continue
their suits under the management and direction of G. Crossley,
were to be delivered to him. At a later period, and on the
republication of the rules of the Supreme Court on the 31st May
1820, it was ordered, that parties should be at liberty to
prosecute or defend suits in person, without the intervention of
an attorney or solicitor; but that the pleadings in every suit
should be signed by one of the attornies or solicitors of the
court, who should be entitled to make a charge for their
signatures as well as for instructions. Under these regulations,
which were made at the instance of Mr. Smith Hall, Mr. Eagar has
been allowed to appear in the Supreme Court on his own behalf,
and to conduct his own suits; and Crossley has continued to
conduct most of those that had been originally intrusted to Mr.
Amos.</p>
<p>The re-admission of this individual to practise in the Supreme
Court, so shortly after he had been excluded from it by the
operation of your Lordship's order, was not grounded upon any
absolute necessity; nor did Mr. Justice Field, or the members of
his court, accede to his readmission upon any opinion that they
entertained of his reformation and improvement. "It was the
opinion of Mr. Justice Field, that Crossley transacted more
business and with more activity than any one of the regular
solicitors"; and it was with reference to that activity: as well
as to the convenience of the suitors, that his qualified
admission was sanctioned. Under this sanction Crossley has been
employed by several respectable individuals in law-suits of
considerable importance.</p>
<p>Although the proceedings of the Supreme Court are conducted
according to the forms of the English courts, yet Mr. Justice
Field has endeavoured as much as possible to prevent them from
being used as pretexts for delay or vexatious litigation; and has
found himself equally justified in resisting the general
application of strict technical rules, on account of the
unskilfulness with which they were managed. One attempt only has
been made in an action that had been tried before him, to raise a
conflicting jurisdiction between the Supreme Court and the
Governor's Court, in consequence of what was conceived to be a
doubtful expression in the terms of the charter of justice in
which the jurisdictions of the Governor's and the Supreme Court
were defined. A verdict having been given in the latter for a sum
under 50<i>l</i>. in an action that was tried in the month of
February 1818, and a motion having been made to set it aside, as
not being within the jurisdiction of the court, a long and
perspicuous judgment was delivered by Mr. Justice Field, in which
he successfully proved, both from analogy and authority, as well
as from expediency, that although the jurisdiction of his court
had been limited to cases where the cause of action exceeded the
sum of 50<i>l</i>. sterling, yet that this expression never could
mean to preclude the court from giving a verdict under that sum,
in a case where the plaintiff had sought to recover, and had
contended for a much larger one. The opinion of Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde upon this point did not unfortunately coincide
with that of Mr. Justice Field; but nothing has occurred since
the opinion of the latter was promulgated, to shake the public
confidence in its correctness; and no fewer than nineteen actions
have been tried in the Supreme Court, in which verdicts have been
given for sums under 50<i>l</i>. and no attempt has ever been
made in the Governor's Court to recover them.</p>
<p>The mode of trying a cause in the Supreme Court differs very
little from the course that is pursued in the courts of England.
Short notes of the evidence are made by the judge, and he submits
the result to the assistant members is the shape of a charge,
accompanied by strong intimations of his own opinion, and a full
declaration of the grounds upon which it is formed.</p>
<p>There has prevailed in the proceedings of the Supreme Court
much less of deliberation than was observed in the Court of Civil
Jurisdiction when Mr. Judge Advocate Bent presided in it.
Differences of opinion between Mr. Justice Field and the members
of his court have not been frequent. Upon questions of law he
expects, as he is entitled to do, their unqualified assent, but
points of fact, character of witnesses, and questions of account,
he submits to their consideration, and sometimes to their
decision.</p>
<p>Most of the eases in which Mr. Justice Field has taken time to
consider of his judgment, have been subsequently reported and
published by himself in the Sydney Gazette, not only with a view
to place before the public the grounds of his decisions and those
of the members of the court, but to prevent the
misrepresentations to which they might have been liable if left
to the discretion of the editor of the Sydney Gazette.</p>
<p>The judge has endeavoured to give effect to the local
regulations published at different periods by the authority of
the governors of the colony, where he found them to be
conformable to the spirit or to the provisions of the law of
England, and to be beneficial in their operation; or even where
he saw that they were essentially necessary for the support of
the system by which the colony was governed.</p>
<p>In attempting to enforce one of the regulations of so early a
date as the 26th February 1802, respecting the registration of
deeds in the office of the judge advocate, and by which it was
declared that no assignment of property in New South Wales was
legal, unless it was regularly drawn up at the judge advocate's
office and there registered, Mr. Justice Field, following a
decision of Mr. Judge Advocate Bent, decided, in a case of
ejectment tried before him on the 30th June 1817, that a mortgage
that had not been registered according to the terms of the
proclamation of 1802, and of which mortgage the second mortgagee
had received no notice, was void, as against one that was
subsequent in date, but that had been registered.</p>
<p>As this decision appeared to Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde to
affect a large proportion of securities that had been given for
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> considerations, but under an ignorance of
such a regulation, he advised Governor Macquarrie to issue a
proclamation, that appeared on the 19th July 1817, and by which
it was declared, that no deed or assignment should be taken to be
illegal or void for want of conformity alone to the proclamation
of the year 1802, but "that such a defect should be considered as
a circumstance or incident in the case, to be submitted to and to
be determined by the courts according to justice and right, and
upon the whole matter put on issue by the parties."</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Field overruled an improper attempt that was made
to give to this proclamation a retrospective effect upon a
judgment in the case just mentioned, and pronounced in his court
only three weeks before; but in an action of ejectment that was
brought by the same party upon a subsequent demise, he permitted
it to be read, and after admitting evidence of the nature of the
transactions affecting both the mortgages, a verdict was given in
favor of the antecedent one.</p>
<p>It was in conformity to the same principles that Mr. Justice
Field has permitted all convicted felons, whose sentences had
been absolutely or conditionally remitted, and persons holding
tickets of leave, to bring and maintain actions in the Supreme
Court; for although he was not exactly aware of the extent of the
disability of all such Persons to sue in a court of justice, yet
he always held, that nothing but the production of an office-copy
of their conviction of felony, could sustain the plea of convict
attaint, or would enable the court to ascertain, whether the
crime of which the party bad been convicted, was followed by the
disabilities that are created by conviction and attainder, or
whether they had been removed either by service of the term of
transportation, or by the governor's pardon.</p>
<p>It is upon the same ground, that convicts of every description
have been admitted to give evidence in the courts; and that the
objection to their competence, which in England might be speedily
determined by having recourse to the record of their conviction,
has been overuled by Mr. Justice Field in the Supreme Court, on
account of the difficulty and delay attending the procurement of
such proof, or upon the principle of law that prohibits a witness
from answering questions that discredit himself, and from the
necessity that exists in a colony, constituted like that of New
South Wales, of dispensing with those strict rules by which the
testimony of so large a proportion of witnesses would be
disqualified and excluded.</p>
<p>Having already stated to your Lordship in the first part of my
Report, the circumstances upon which the Supreme Court and the
Governor's Court determined to make the only exceptions that have
yet occurred in the practice, of admitting emancipated convicts
to maintain actions in the courts of New South Wales, I will not
now repeat them but I think it necessary to advert to the reasons
stated by Mr. Justice Field in favour of a continuance of that
power, which your Lordship will have observed to be virtually
exercised by the judicial authorities over the fortunes and
feelings of a large portion of the inhabitants of New South
Wales, by giving or withholding permission to produce the record
of their conviction.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Field has stated indeed in his observations upon
the defects of the present charter of justice, and upon the
admissibility of convicts to discharge the office of jurors, that
this, amongst other disabilities of conviction, is taken away in
New South Wales by the operation of the rule of evidence that he
has applied. "The sting of the law", he says, "in this remote
colony, where it would sting itself to death, is well and wisely
taken away by the law itself; the letter killeth, but the spirit
giveth life." "There is no necessity, therefore," he adds, "for
the legislative provision that Governor Macquarrie requests your
Lordship to sanction in his dispatch of the 28th June 1813, for
the purpose of restoring the remitted convict to a complete
enjoyment of the rights of free persons." This argument proceeds
upon an assumption, that it is not safe to trust the remitted
convicts with the indefeasible right that is possessed by
unconvicted persons, of maintaining actions in the colonial
courts; but that it is safe to intrust to the judicial
authorities the great power of determining how long and in what
cases they may exercise that right.</p>
<p>Your Lordship will have observed that this power, from the
manner in which it is exercised, may equally be applied to the
convict whose term of service is expired, and who, to all intents
and purposes, is a freeman, as to the convict whose term of
service has been remitted by the governor of the colony, and who
stands in the situation of a person holding a sign manual pardon.
It is only necessary for a defendant, when sued by those persons,
to obtain leave of the courts in New South Wales, for time to
produce an of of the plaintiff's conviction, by swearing that he
verily believes the crime of which he was convicted to have been
one that is not purged by the service of the term of
transportation, or that the term is not expired; and if the court
should be of opinion, that the action is brought from invidious
motives, the plaintiff is either entirely debarred of his right
of recovery, or indefinitely delayed in it. The disabilities of
conviction for felony may thus be protracted by the want of
technical and strict proof of their removal; while the effect of
pardon, and much of the excitement to obtain or to deserve it, is
lost by thus depreciating its value when obtained. The forfeiture
of property, and the incapacity to retain it, form its of the
punishment that the law has ordained for those who have violated
it. For certain violations of the law, this incapacity is only
temporary for others, it is perpetual. In some cases it is
removed by the expiration of the term of punishment, which, as
far as transportation is concerned, implies the endurance of a
specific term of service; and in others, it is made dependent
upon the good conduct of the party under punishment, when
attested by the governor's pardon; but it is not effectually
removed till that pardon be confirmed by the King. In both cases,
as it has appeared to me, the legislature has intended that there
should be some term to the legal disabilities of punishment, but
more especially in the colony of New South Wales, where, when the
object of punishment is satisfied and the crime expiated, it has
contemplated the formation of new habits, new feelings, and new
hopes. It has been generally observed, that this regeneration of
the mind is powerfully excited in the colony of New South Wales,
and sometimes in men of the worst characters, by the possession
of property, and the means that it affords of improving their
condition. The change that it produces is not infrequently
observed to bring with it a contentious and litigious spirit, for
the correction of which it might be expedient to retain the
discretionary power that is exercised by the courts of New South
Wales, if were possible to apply it in the case of an individual,
or so to punish him without reflecting some degree of disgrace
upon his class. The remitted convicts of New South Wales have
seen that motives declared to be invidious in one of their class,
and his impatience of a magisterial rebuke, have been restrained
by the application of a rule of law, to which the unconvicted
class of inhabitants is not subject.</p>
<p>I am far from imputing to either of the courts of New South
Wales, or to the learned persons who preside in them, any
intention of producing such an effect by the judgments that they
have given; but the arbitrary application of these rules has had
the unfortunate effect of manifesting the inequality of condition
that exists between the convicted and unconvicted classes of the
inhabitants of New South Wales, in their appeals to those laws
whose greatest boast is, to afford equal protection to all. They
have now found, that what was matter of right to the free
inhabitants, was to themselves matter of favour and judicial
grace; and this distinction, not unimportant in itself, mortified
the pride of many, while it irritated the feelings and excited
the fears of all. It was under this impression, and from thinking
that the feelings of these classes of the population had been
unnecessarily irritated in the course of the discussions to which
I have before alluded, that I agreed with Governor Macquarrie in
the propriety of affording to the remitted convicts, an
opportunity of making a representation of the state and effects
of their legal incapacities. The opinion that I had entertained,
when the subject was firelight first under discussion, had led me
to make a private communication of it to Mr. Justice Field; and
in several conversations that I had with Mr. Judge Advocate
Wylde, I expressed sentiments to the same effect. In these
opinions I am still confirmed, as far as they regard the removal
of the incapacities of being witnesses, of maintaining personal
actions, of acquiring, retaining and transmitting property, from
those convicts whose terms of service had expired, or who had
received the pardon of the governors of New South Wales.</p>
<p>With regard to the future, I do not consider it either
necessary or expedient in a colony, destined as that of New south
Wales is for the reception, the punishment, and the reform of
convicts, to maintain by legislative influence or enactment, any
other distinctions in the exercise of these rights than those
that I have proposed in my former Report, beyond the period
assigned by the law for their punishment, or that which is
assigned by the governors for its remission; still less do I
think it necessary to continue in New South Wales beyond those
periods, the anomalous effects of punishment that are found to
attach to convicts for some offences, and not to others.</p>
<p>Whatever the determination may be with regard to these effects
upon convicts on their return to England, or on quitting the
territory of New South Wales, I cannot see upon what grounds of
expediency they are to be maintained in that colony.</p>
<p>Upon a reference to the list of causes that had been tried in
the course of three years subsequent to the opening of the
Supreme Court, I do not find that there had been any denial of
justice to the remitted convicts; and no case had occurred that
furnished any grounds for narrowing their claims to it in future.
By a return that was furnished me by the registrar of the Supreme
Court, of the names and number of persons that have brought
actions in that court from the 1st April 1817 to the 14th
December 1820, I find that as many as one hundred and ninety-six
were Drought by persons who had been convicts, and six by persons
who were still in that condition.</p>
<p>With the exception of three individuals of the free classes of
inhabitants, and those of the emancipated convicts, who either
were, or believed that they might be affected by the future
exercise of this discretionary power, I found no person that
expressed dissatisfaction with the decisions of the Supreme
Court, since the period in which Mr. Justice Field had presided
in it.</p>
<p>The principal person of the class of emancipated convicts that
huts either entertained or expressed that feeling towards the
judicial conduct of Mr. Justice Field, is Mr. Edward Eagar. The
grounds of his dissatisfaction are stated very briefly in a
memorial that he delivered to me soon after my arrival in the
colony, wherein he took occasion to submit to me, amongst a
variety of topics for the future improvement of the colony, the
existing defects of the judicial establishments. Mr. Eagar bad
been appointed to act as secretary to the meeting of the
inhabitants of the colony that took place on the 27th January
1819, and in that character had drawn up the petition that it was
then resolved to address to His Royal Highness the Prince Regent,
and that was trans pitted to your lordship.</p>
<p>In several communications that I had with Sir John Jamieson,
who acted as chairman of the meeting, as well as with Mr. Eagar,
I was enabled to collect from them the principal grounds of
objection that were stated in the petition, to the present system
of judicature, and to make reference to the cases upon which
their allegations were founded. Part of the objections stated in
the memorial of Mr. Eagar have already been noticed; and those
which relate to the judgments delivered by Mr. Justice Field,
being entirely of a personal nature, and having received a very
sufficient contradiction by the authenticated reports that Mr.
Justice Field has published of those judgments, I do not think it
necessary in this place to make any further observation upon
those parts of Mr. Eagar's objections. It is fit, however, that I
should state, that out of one hundred and sixty-five actions that
have been brought and tried in the Supreme Court, between the
month of April 1817 and the 6th January 1821, as well as eleven
causes that have been heard and determined in the equity
jurisdiction of that Court, only nine appeals have been entered,
and of those two were withdrawn; and in one only was the judgment
of the Supreme Court reversed. Cases have also occurred, during
the same period, in which Mr. Justice Field has displayed a very
independent judgment; and has proved to the colony, that although
he was ready to give effect to the public orders and
proclamations of the governor, whenever he found them to be
consistent with the principles of the law of England, or to be
justified by palpable necessity, yet he has never allowed his
decisions to be swayed by any consideration of the personal
wishes of the governor, or the supposed influence of the
government, in cases where, although they were not expressed or
signified, the existence of both might be presumed.</p>
<p>Your Lordship has been already apprised of Mr. Justice Field's
objections and refusal to admit actions in the Supreme Court of
New South Wales, for the recovery of duties on spirits or
imported goods, until those duties had received the sanction of
the British legislature; and of the recovery of damages by the
Reverend Mr. Marsden in the Supreme Court against Mr. J. T.
Campbell, the governor's secretary, for a libel published by him
in the Sydney Gazette. To this instance one more may be adduced,
of a judgment given by Mr. Justice Field in an action brought by
the governor, for recovering a sum of money expended in the
support of certain Asiatic servants that bad been brought to the
colony from Calcutta, and had complained to the governor of
ill-treatment by their master. Mr. Justice Field was of opinion
in this case, that as the relation of master and servant had been
dissolved by an order of a bench of magistrates, subsequent to
the promise made by the master to give them a proper
compensation, and to pay the expenses of their passage to India,
the governor had lost his remedy, and could not compel the master
to pay either, although he might have compelled him to provide a
passage, at the peril of being sent out of the colony.</p>
<p>The principal objections that I perceived to exist against the
exercise of the functions of the Supreme Court, were founded upon
the influence that the judge seemed to exercise over the opinions
of the members; the eagerness with which his own were delivered
from the bench, and the great expense of the proceedings. Upon
the first two points I have already observed; and although I am
not aware of any occasion upon which the influence of Mr. Justice
Field was improperly exercised, or where it did not tend to
promote the purposes of justice, yet it appeared to me that it
would have been very desirable in a system of judicature, wherein
the deliberative powers of the persons composing it were
necessarily limited, that the greatest latitude of judgment
Should always have been afforded to the members of the court,
together with the fullest opportunity of considering it.</p>
<p>It has seldom occurred that the judge has positively differed
with the members of his court, but they have hardly ever retired
to consider of their judgment. In complex or difficult cases he
has reduced his opinion to writing, and afterwards submitted it
to the members of his court; and upon their concurrence,
privately signified, in the substance and effect of his judgment,
he has delivered it.</p>
<p>The expenses of the proceedings in the Supreme Court, consist
of the fees that are payable to the clerk and registrar of the
court, to the judge when acting as master and examiner, to the
judge's marshal, crier, tipstaff and courtkeeper; and lastly, the
fees of the solicitor's and provost marshal's office.</p>
<p>The letters patent of his late Majesty, constituting the
Supreme Court, required that a table of the fees allowed to the
officers should be settled by the court, and be subject to the
approval of the governor. Upon the opening of the court in the
year 1817, Mr. Justice Field, having obtained the approval of
Governor Macquarrie to certain rules anti a schedule of fees,
submitted them to the members of his court, one of whom, Mr. D.
Wentworth, declined giving any opinion upon them; they were acted
upon, notwithstanding, until the early part of the year 1820,
when a motion having been addressed to the Supreme Court by Mr.
Eagar relative to the amount of the fees, and a suggestion having
been made by the judge that the members of the court would confer
with the governor upon the subject, Mr. Eagar addressed a
memorial to him upon the general illegality of fees taken by
judges, and the oppressive amount of those of the Supreme Court,
endeavouring at the same time to prove to the governor, that
although the fees were stated in the schedule that he had
approved, to be payable to the clerk and registrar, they were in
fact payable and paid to the judge alone. He also insisted upon
the impropriety of the judge's having acted as master and
examiner in the equity-jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, of his
exercising an office to which he had never been appointed, and
that had never been approved or confirmed by the governor. After
some consideration of the subject by the governor and the members
of the Supreme Court, Mr. Wentworth and Captain Piper, a new
scale of fees and some emendations of the former rules were
agreed upon by them, and were returned to Governor Macquarrie for
approval. The governor at first expressed a wish to await my
return From Van the men's Land before he gave his sanction to
them, but being disappointed in his expectations of that event,
he finally approved the rules and schedule of fees that had been
submitted to him. Several alterations were made that tended to
simplify and facilitate the proceedings of the court, and one
rule was added by which the judge was ordered to act as master,
both at law and equity, and as examiner in equity and
ecclesiastical proceedings.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Field has explained in his evidence the nature of
the difficulties that had induced him, on opening his court, to
take upon himself the execution of the duties of master and
examiner in equity. They were the same that had dictated an
explanation made upon this subject by Mr. J. H. Bent to your
Lordship; and were certainly justified by the refusal of all the
practising solicitors, with the exception of Mr. Wylde, to give
up their practice for the purpose of undertaking an office that
promised so little emolument as that of master and examiner in
equity. Soon after his arrival in the colony, Mr. Justice Field
stated the difficulty in which he was placed to Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde, who it appears consented to perform the duties
until some special appointment should have been received from
your Lordship; but Mr. Justice Field, upon re-consideration of
the subject, and finding that he had sufficient time to devote to
the duties of master and examiner, and not considering them to be
incompatible with those of judge, continued to execute them from
the period of opening his court to the early part of the year
1820.</p>
<p>Moved by the petition of Mr. Eagar, that I have already
adverted to, the members of the Supreme Court, Mr. Wentworth and
Captain Piper, not concurring in the views entertained by Mr.
Justice Field, of the compatibility of the offices of judge and
master in equity, felt desirous of making some change, and having
agreed with him in the inexpediency of offering the latter to Mr.
Solicitor Wylde, applied to Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, his son,
whom they found unwilling to undertake it unless the whole court
concurred in the application. As Mr. Justice Field declined to do
so, the members consented to appoint him to perform the duty,
requiring only as an authority the sanction of his opinion and
that of the judge advocate.</p>
<p>This opinion was given on the 8th March 1820, and the members
of the Supreme Court were advised that the judge must necessarily
act as master and examiner, unless the full court should think
fit to act in those capacities.</p>
<p>The judges in giving this opinion had thought that the
inconvenience of the alternative they proposed would have
prevented its adoption by the members; they adopted it
nevertheless, and Mr. Justice Field against it, although he
consented to a reduction of the fees to one-half of their
amount.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie did not approve of the alteration of the
practice proposed by the members; but after they had retracted
their difference as to the mastership, and had left the reduction
of the fees to the judge, he continued to act as master and
examiner of the court; and the rules that appear in the Appendix,
and the fees in the schedule annexed to them, were finally agreed
to and approved by Governor Macquarrie. The reduction that was
then made in them amounted to nearly one-fourth in the fees taken
on the commencement of actions in the Supreme Court, and on
fixing its seal to probates of wills and letters of
administration; but no alteration was made in the other fees, and
the court expenses of law-suits thus experienced a very
inconsiderable reduction.</p>
<p>Mr. Eagar again renewed the subject of the fees of the Supreme
Court, by refusing to pay to the clerk and registrar the fee for
entering an appearance to an action brought against him by the
president and company of the bank of New South Wales. In
consequence of this refusal, and of his declining to make any
defence upon the merits at the hearing of the cause, a judgment
was entered for the whole demand, amounting to 554<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>Against this judgment Mr. Eagar appealed to the governor, and
after the appeal was heard, the judgment of the Supreme Court was
confirmed. The argument that was read by Mr. Eagar upon that
occasion is in the Appendix; it recapitulates the authorities
that he formerly brought before the governor's notice in the
shape of a memorial, and asserts that the terms of the charter of
justice sanctioned the payment of fees to the clerks and officers
of the Supreme Court, and not to the judge.</p>
<p>The amount of the fees received by the clerk and registrar of
the Supreme Court, from the date of its opening in April 1817 to
the 26th June 1820, upon suits tried and entered during that
period, is 3,576<i>l</i>. 13<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. exclusive of
fees received on probates of wills and letters of administration,
amounting to 532<i>l</i>. 7<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. making together
a total sum of 4,109<i>l</i>. 1<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. J. Gurner, the person who fills the office of clerk and
registrar of the court, as well as that of judge's marshal,
accompanied Mr. Justice Field to the colony. He receives a salary
of 80<i>l</i>. per annum from the colonial funds, a single ration
from the king's store, and one-sixth of the amount of the fees
that have just been stated. In addition to these allowances, he
has received a grant of four hundred acres of land, cattle, and
the subsistence of three men upon the store for eighteen
months.</p>
<p>The crier of the court is a convict, and acts also as a
copying clerk in the judge's office.</p>
<p>The amount of the fees received by the registrar of the
Supreme Court in some cases exceeds, and in others falls below,
the amount of similar charges in the courts of justice in
England; it cannot, however, be denied that it has afforded a
very considerable addition to the judicial expenses of suitors,
as well as a ground of complaint to all classes of the
inhabitants.</p>
<p>The fees and charges made by the solicitors of the court are
regulated by a schedule that was approved by Mr. Justice Field.
Some of them are higher in amount than the fees charged by
solicitors in England, including also the charges for stamps. The
reasons for these heavy charges do not appear to me to arise from
any other local peculiarity than that of the expense of paper and
stationery: this expense has been always much felt in the colony,
and especially in the earlier periods. By more frequent
intercourse with England and with India, it is gradually
diminishing. The solicitors represented to me one of a more
serious kind, arising from the poverty of their suitors, and the
long credit they were obliged to give to them, exceeding that
which was given to them by the registrar of the Supreme Court.
The complaint, however, of the heavy charges made for
professional attendance in the courts were generally against all
the solicitors, and as much directed against the two gentlemen
who received salaries from the colonial funds, as against those
who did not receive such assistance. The difference between the
mode of charging that was adopted when the business was intrusted
to the convict attornies, who, instead of fees, took a percentage
upon the gross amount of the sums recovered, the difference in
the forms of proceeding, and the greater degree of activity that
was manifested by those persons than by the present solicitors,
has lessened the satisfaction with which the arrival of the
latter in the colony, or their professional services in it, were
at first or have been since regarded.</p>
<p>The solicitors have generally availed themselves of the
services of convict clerks; and by an agreement that was made
between Mr. Amos and Crossley, a convict attorney, the former
stipulated for the receipt of an annuity of 400<i>l</i>. and half
the fees that should be received, in return for the practice to
which the latter agreed to introduce him.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal was limited by the
last letters patent of the year 1814, to causes wherein the debt
or thing in demand exceeded the value of 300<i>l</i>. sterling;
and the right of parties to appeal to his Majesty in council, was
limited to causes that exceeded the value of 3,000<i>l</i>.: both
of these limitations have been created by royal authority.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Supreme Court by Mr. Justice Field in
the year 1817, seven appeals have been entered; and of these,
five have been heard, and two have been withdrawn. It is directed
by the charter, that the governor should be assisted in the Court
of Appeal by the judge advocate; and, under this direction, Mr.
Judge Advocate Wylde has attended the hearing of appeals, and on
some occasions has delivered his opinion; but it does not appear
that Governor Macquarrie has always considered the judge
advocate's opinion as binding upon his own judgment.</p>
<p>Considerable improvement has taken place in the office and
mode of conducting the business of the provost marshal, since the
appointment of Mr. J. T. Campbell on the 6th March 1819. For his
protection a proclamation was issued by Governor Macquarrie, upon
the suggestion of Mr. Justice Field, authorizing the provost
marshal to summon juries to inquire as to the property in goods
and chattels and land that might in future be levied on.</p>
<p>The fees of the office of provost marshal were considerably
reduced on the appointment of Mr. J. T. Campbell; and he has
submitted to me a statement of the fees received between the 7th
March 1819 and the 30th October 1820, in which the gross amount
is stated to have been 1,405<i>l</i>. 18<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. and
that it has been reduced by the expenses and outgoings of the
office (including the payment of salaries to bailiffs, amounting
to 210<i>l</i>., the sum of 123<i>l</i>. 14<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.
that Mr. Campbell was compelled to pay, by a verdict of the
Supreme Court; and one-fourth of the net proceeds to time deputy
provost marshal) to the sum of 655<i>l</i>. 16<i>s</i>.
7&frac12;<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>Considering the responsibility of the office of provost
marshal, and the difficulty of finding competent persons in New
South Wales to perform the subordinate duties with integrity, I
submit to your Lordship the propriety of referring the schedule
of fees of the provost marshal, that was fixed by the judges on
the 13th March 1819, to the same authority for revisal; and for
some proportionate augmentation in those items, that limit the
allowance to the provost marshal for executing summonses for sums
exceeding 50<i>l</i>. and at places distant ten miles from Sydney
and other towns, to 1<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>The authority by which the Criminal Court of New South Wales
was created, has already been submitted to your Lordship. The
power of convening it is authorized to be given by His Majesty to
the governors or lieutenant-governors of New South Wales, and the
court is to consist of the judge advocate and six officers of His
Majesty's forces by sea or land. The mode of proceeding in the
Criminal Court is pointed out in the charter of justice, and it
has jurisdiction to try and punish "all such outrages and
misbehaviours as, if committed within the realm (of England,)
would be deemed and taken, according to the laws of that realm,
to be treason or misprision thereof, felony or misdemeanor."</p>
<p>Under these authorities, Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde has
continued to preside in the Criminal Court since the month of
October 1816, Mr. F. Garling having officiated as judge advocate
under an appointment of Governor Macquarrie, from the month of
January 1816 to the month of September of that year.</p>
<p>The Criminal Courts are convened by Governor Macquarrie, by a
precept addressed to the provost marshal of the territory, who
summons the members. The appointment of them wholly rests with
the governor, and it has been made conformable to the practice
that prevails in the appointment of the members of military
courts martial. A few instances have occurred where the members
have been excused on account of indisposition, and, at the
suggestion of the judge advocate, on account of their youth.</p>
<p>The sessions of the Criminal Court were fixed by an order of
Governor Macquarrie, dated on the 7th June 1817, and made at the
suggestion of the judge to take place on the 15th March, the 1st
June, the 15th September, and the 1st December in each year. In
the year 1817 two sessions only were held, but since that period
they have been regular.</p>
<p>The informations taken by the superintendent of police of
Sydney, and the magistrates of the county districts, are
transmitted by them to the judge advocate, who after
consideration exercises the power of determining whether the
parties convicted are to be put upon their trial. The words of
the charter under which this power is exercised direct, "that the
Criminal Court shall proceed to try all offenders, by calling
them before it; that the charges should always be reduced to
writing, and should be exhibited by the judge advocate." In the
period that has elapsed from the month of October 1816 to the
month of December 1820, three hundred and seventy-nine criminal
charges have been exhibited to the court by the judge advocate,
and thirty-nine cases have occurred in which he has declined to
exhibit any. The nature of the charges is set forth in the
returns made by the judge advocate, as well as the punishment
annexed to them. The returns of offences and punishments previous
to the period of Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde's arrival, and for one
sessions subsequent to it, having been annexed to the evidence
given before the Parliamentary Committee on Gaols, I did not
think it necessary to add them.</p>
<p>The form and language in which the informations are drawn, are
precisely similar to those of indictments in the criminal courts
of England. They are drawn by Mr. Wylde the clerk of the peace;
and on special occasions, by the judge advocate himself.</p>
<p>The informations are read over in court to the prisoners, who
are arraigned upon them, by the clerk of the peace; and the judge
advocate then proceeds in the examination of the witnesses. Until
the commencement of the year 1820, it had been the practice of
Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde to retire with the members of the court,
after the evidence in each case was concluded, and to deliberate
upon it in an adjoining room. The members had here an opportunity
of discussing the questions that had arisen, of hearing the
opinion of the judge advocate, and of deciding upon their verdict
and sentence. Upon their return to the court, the judge advocate
resumed the open consideration of the case, made reference to the
questions of law and fact that had already been decided by the
court, and in doing this, sometimes read the evidence from his
notes.</p>
<p>Having observed during my attendance at the Criminal Court,
that this mode of proceeding consumed a great deal of their time,
without any advantage to the members of the court, or to the
public, I suggested to the judge advocate the expediency of
summing the evidence given on each trial from his notes in the
form of a charge, and of stating all questions of law and fact as
well as his own view of them, to the members of the court before
they retired, in the presence of the prisoner and of the
public.</p>
<p>The judge advocate adopted this suggestion, and it has had the
effect of more nearly approximating the practice of the court to
that of criminal courts in England, and of affording
opportunities of correcting mistakes in the evidence, or clearing
up doubts that were material to the prisoners defence, before the
court retired to consider of them; and the still more important
advantage of manifesting to the public the grounds of law and
fact, by which the consideration of the verdict would be
guided.</p>
<p>In considering the verdict, and in all questions of law the
opinion of the judge advocate, has always had much influence; and
in apportioning punishment, he has always found a much greater
disposition in the members to listen to reasons for merciful than
severe judgments.</p>
<p>Several occasions have occurred in which a verdict has been
given by a majority of four members of the court; but five cases
only have occurred of a capital nature, in which a difference of
opinion amongst the members rendered a reference necessary to the
consideration of His Majesty's government. Two of these were
cases of forgery and one was a case under Lord Ellenborough's
act, which was referred for the same reasons. Two were for
murder.</p>
<p>A pardon, oil condition of transportation for life to the Coal
River, was offered to two of these offenders upon the accession
of His present Majesty to the throne, but they declined it; and
one was waiting the determination of His Majesty's pleasure upon
my departure from the colony in 1821. Another case of a capital
nature, wherein the judgment of the court was referred, took
place in the year 1821: It was upon the conviction of a soldier
of the 84th regiment of foot, for the murder of a sailor on board
His Majesty's ship Dromedary, when stationed at New Zealand.</p>
<p>The sentences of the court, signed by the judge advocate and
the members, are submitted to the governor for approval; and the
notes taken by the judge advocate transmitted to him, before he
makes his final decision upon the cases of capital
punishment.</p>
<p>On reference to the return of offences and punishments from
October 1816 to the end of the year 1820, it appears that capital
punishments have been inflicted in cases of murder, highway
robbery, and stealing in dwelling-houses, burglaries, stealing
and killing cattle, and in one case of forgery, and that out of
one hundred and eleven sentences of death that have been passed
for these crimes, fifty-nine have been executed. The general
increase of capital offences is attributable to the successive
increase in the number of convicts that have arrived in New South
Wales from the year 1817 to the end of 1820; and the diminution
that took place in the year 1819, is attributable to the
effectual confinement of the convicts in the early part of that
year to the barrack in Hyde Park. Iii the year 1818 the number of
cases that came before the Criminal Court was ninety-eight, and
in 1819 it was reduced to sixty-seven. In 1820 the number of
convicts exceeded the means of accommodation in the barrack, and
the offences increased to one hundred and eleven.</p>
<p>In the month of August 1817 an official notice and caution was
deemed necessary by Governor Macquarrie to the inhabitants of the
colony, to prevent them from travelling between the towns of
Sydney and Paramatta by night, and constables were ordered to
patrols on different parts of that road from sun-set to sun-rise.
These outrages appeared to increase at the end of the year 1819,
and were attributable to the facilities of plunder afforded by
the convicts employed in the road parties. They were not in
general attended with violence to the parties robbed, but were
much invited by the state of inebriety in which the settlers
always returned from the towns, and by the expectation of plunder
that their carts afforded. The higher classes of the inhabitants
did not incur the same risk in travelling by night, and very few
instances have occurred where they have been attacked. The
necessity of affording protection to cattle and sheep, which from
the general want of inclosures in the colony have been much
exposed to depredation, has latterly increased the number of
executions for that crime; and from disclosures that took place
in the Criminal Court of June 1820, upon the trial of certain
emancipated convicts and one native youth, it appeared that the
crime of cattle stealing was very extensively practised.</p>
<p>As early as the year 1812 an order was issued by Governor
Macquarrie, declaring that all the lands situated to the westward
of the river Nepean, as well as the tract known by the name of
Emu Plains, with the exception of the grants made to Messrs.
M&lsquo;Arthur and Davidson in the Cow Pastures, were
unappropriated crown lands, and prohibited any person from going
thither without a pass. It was also declared, that the whole of
the wild cattle grazing to the westward of the Nepean, were
clearly to be understood as the property of the crown; and that
any person detected in stealing or killing them would be
prosecuted for felony, and punished in the most exemplary
manner.</p>
<p>The depredations upon these herds continued to be made by the
convict servants, as well as by the settlers on the northern
banks of the river Nepean, whenever the price of butcher's meat
was so high as to afford them temptation.</p>
<p>It is stated by an intelligent witness, who had long resided
in that neighbourhood, that the refusal of the convict servants
whom the superintended to mess together, and to sleep in a
barrack rather than in separate huts on their master's farm,
proceeded from the fear of interruption that it might occasion to
their habits of nightly plunder in the lands occupied by the wild
cattle. This system of depredation continued in spite of every
endeavour on the part of the government to suppress it; and in
the month of January of the year 1817, Governor Macquarrie, with
the advice of Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, issued a proclamation, in
which after declaring that sentence of death had been lately
passed on certain offenders convicted of killing and driving away
cattle, the property of the crown, alleged in the recital of the
proclamation to have been collected, placed, and suffered to
graze and be at large in the crown lands called the Cow Pastures,
the sentence was commuted to transportation for life, and
indemnity was promised to all persons who had through ignorance
or want of caution been implicated in the consequences of having
committed such an offence. It was further ordered, that no
persons except the civil or military officers of the government,
and the families of Mr. M&lsquo;Arthur and Mr. Davidson, should
on any pretence cross the river Nepean or travel into or within
the lands and country westward or southward of the river Nepean,
without first obtaining a pass from the governor or his
secretary.</p>
<p>The constables were ordered to apprehend and lodge in gaol all
persons found in those lands without a pass; all cattle found
there were declared liable to seizure and forfeiture; and a
denunciation was added, that after the due promulgation of the
order in the territory, any person who should be guilty of
stealing any cattle belonging to the crown, or should kill any of
them with intent to steal the carcase, and being convicted
thereof, should receive judgment according to the statute; and
should in no case or upon any account receive pardon or
mitigation of sentence in respect thereof, but should suffer
death according to law.</p>
<p>In the month of May following three men were charged before
the Criminal Court with killing some of the government cattle and
stealing their carcases: they were convicted of these offences
and sentenced to death. Mr. Moore, their solicitor, moved in
arrest of the judgment of the court, that the cattle in question
having always been in a wild state, and having been permitted to
range in uninclosed lands, could not be the subject of larceny;
and that the property in them, which had been averred in the
information to be in His Majesty, was not proved by the evidence;
and that so far from the cattle having become the exclusive
property of the crown, it was well known that several cattle,
that could be proved to be the property of Mr. John
M&lsquo;Arthur and of other persons, had strayed into the Cow
pastures and had mixed with them.</p>
<p>Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde delivered the opinion of the court
upon these points, first having noticed that the verdict of the
court had already declared the property of the King in these
cattle to have been sufficiently proved. The opinion delivered
upon this occasion was published by the permission and tinder the
correction of Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde in the Sydney Gazette,
10th July 1817. It was declared that the property of the crown in
the cattle might be either qualified, as arising from the
continued pasturage of the cattle on the crown lands, or special,
as of <i>bon&acirc; vacanti&acirc;</i>, vesting in the King as
general owner and lord paramount of the soil; and that although
positive proof might not be given of the cattle having been
placed in the Cow Pastures originally by the crown, still the
reservation and possession of the land carried with it all right
to the profits; and that such right and reserved dominion had
been frequently and publicly proclaimed in several orders of the
governors of the colony, and in the appointment from time to time
of constables and soldiers for the special protection of the
government herds.</p>
<p>The judge advocate further remarked, that the law recognized
certain distinctions between tame and wild animals, limiting them
to such as are generally seen tame and domesticated, and such as
are generally found at liberty; to such as are fit for food and
kept for pleasure or curiosity, such as are valuable, and such as
are of a base nature.</p>
<p>He did not consider that there was any thing in the character
or history of the government herds, from which the prisoners were
found guilty of stealing, that denoted such an original wild
state as the law contemplated in the term of "<i>fer&aelig;
natur&aelig;</i>" They had been preserved for the purpose of
ensuring the continuance of the colonial stock, and in every
point of view were valuable as food.</p>
<p>In adverting to the want of proof of property, the judge
advocate declared that neither in the present, nor in any similar
case in future, should he consider it necessary to require
evidence of ownership of cattle; and that if there was a
destruction of any animal, with an intent to steal or take it
away, he should consider the proof of property in it to be an
immaterial part of the offence.</p>
<p>After enlarging upon these topics, the judge advocate
delivered the sentence of the court, "that as there was some
reason to presume that the penalties of the law that had been
denounced in the proclamation of the 1st January 1817, had not
yet reached the parts of the colony in which the prisoners lived,
their lives should be spared on condition of transportation for
life to such part of the territory as the governor should think
fit."</p>
<p>The principal difficulty in this case arose from the want of
proof of one of the averments of the information, by which the
cattle in question were alleged to be the property of His
Majesty. They consisted of the progeny of those that had strayed
from Sydney Cove soon after the landing of Governor Philip, and
of a few that had subsequently joined them belonging to
neighbouring settlers. Their numbers had thus increased, but they
still retained the marks and forth of the original breed; and
although they had ceased to be tame, in consequence of
uncontrolled range in an extensive pasturage, yet they were then
capable of being reclaimed, and many have since been taken, and
have been used as draught cattle in the government works.</p>
<p>At a subsequent sessions of the Criminal Court, in the month
of September 1818, two men were tried and convicted of killing
cattle, the property of persons unknown, and of crossing the
river Nepean contrary to the governor's proclamation. For this
offence they were sentenced to transportation to Newcastle for
their natural lives. In the following year, a similar conviction
of three men for the same offence was followed by sentence of
death, that was afterwards commuted by Governor Macquarrie to
transportation for life.</p>
<p>In consequence of the difficulty that has been both felt and
expressed by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, in applying the statutable
punishments to the crime of forgery, as well as to that of
cutting and maiming with a felonious intent, the courts before
whom the first of these offences was tried, so far deferred to
the judge advocate's opinion, as to withhold the execution of the
sentences until the advice of His Majesty's law-officers could be
obtained.</p>
<p>The doubts entertained by the judge advocate arose from the
terms of the Act of Parliament of the 27 Geo. III. c. 2, by which
the jurisdiction of the criminal courts that it authorized his
Majesty to establish in the colony of New South Wales, was
declared to extend "to the trial and punishment of all such
outrages and misbehaviours as, if committed within this realm,
would be deemed, according to the laws of this realm, to be
treason or misprision thereof, felony or misdemeanor."</p>
<p>In some of the Acts of Parliament that were passed both before
and after the establishment of a criminal jurisdiction in New
South Wales, their operation has been sometimes limited to
England only, and at other times has been extended to Ireland,
mid at others to Scotland.</p>
<p>It appeared to the judge advocate that the older statutes, by
which the offence of forgery had been made punishable, were
clearly of this limited extent, as the act of the 45 Geo. III c.
89, was passed to give them a new and more general operation, and
expressly comprehended Scotland.</p>
<p>This interpretation of the statute was not adopted by His
Majesty's attorney and solicitor-general; and after their opinion
had been communicated to Mr. Judge. Advocate Wylde, the statutes,
as well as the punishments for the offence of forgery, were put
in force.</p>
<p>The judge advocate also held, that another statute, and one of
very important enactment, the 43 Geo. III. c. 58, (commonly
called Lord Ellenborough's Act,) for preventing malicious
shooting, stabbing, and cutting, being expressly limited to
England and Ireland, could not be considered as a law of the
realm, and he declined to file an information against a convict
committed by the magistrates of Paramatta for this offence; and
the punishment of another was deferred, and awaits the reference
that was ordered by the Criminal Court to the consideration of
His Majesty, before the sentence of death that had been passed
should be carried into execution.</p>
<p>Although the doubts that were entertained upon the operation
in New South Wales of the statutes, creating the offence of
forgery, have been removed by the opinion of the attorney and
solicitor general, and one sentence of death for that offence has
been carried into execution, it would be advisable in any future
Act of Parliament that may be passed relative to the punishment
of offences committed in New South Wales, to remove any doubts
respecting the import and meaning of the word "realm", as well as
the application of all criminal laws that have been passed since
the 27 Geo. III. c. 24, by adopting the suggestion of Mr. Justice
Field in his observations on the charter of Justice, and by
inserting in any legislative enactment the words "laws now in
force in that part of this realm called England".</p>
<p>In referring to the return of punishments that have been
inflicted under the sentences of the Criminal Courts since the
year 1810, and to the recommendations that accompanied them, it
will be found that, with the exception of some of those that were
ordered by the two Criminal Courts of the year 1816, in which Mr.
Garling presided as judge advocate, there has been manifested a
great degree of humanity and tenderness. The grounds of those
exceptions have been submitted to your Lordship by Mr. Garling,
and they appear to have arisen from a desire in the members who
then composed the Criminal Court, to substitute the punishment of
solitary confinement for that of whipping or transportation to
the Coal River. In the cases of Patrick Hart and Owen Doran, of
Michael Hoare and James Gilchrist, of Edward Doyle and John
White, solitary confinement in the gaol at Paramatta was ordered
for the space of twelve months; in the case of Peter Wilson for
two years, and in the case of three other prisoners for three
years.</p>
<p>During that period, it appears by the evidence of Mr. Francis
Oakes, that the prisoners were allowed to leave their cells and
to come into the yard of the prison for one hour every day; and
that the prison allowance amounting to one pound of bread per
day, was allowed to be augmented by any contributions from their
friends; but when the prisoners, as in the case of John Hall and
Peter Allen, derived no such assistance, the effect of such long
confinement and insufficient food had visibly affected their
healths.</p>
<p>It was during the continuance of these punishments, that the
notice of Mr. Bailey, who happened to be in the Paramatta gaol on
the arrival and distribution of some convicts, was drawn to the
situation of Michael Hoare. This man had already committed acts
of violence in his cell, and had caused such alarm in the gaol
and neighbourhood, that several persons who observed him imputed
his appearance and condition to insanity, caused by long
confinement. Mr. West the surgeon of Paramatta has stated, that
he visited this man at the desire of the Rev. Mr. Marsden, and
gave it as his opinion that he was not insane, but that he was
counterfeiting madness, with a view to effect his release from
strict confinement. Mr. Marsden, who was at that time the
principal magistrate at Paramatta, entertained a different
opinion respecting the state of Michael Hoare's intellect, and as
his violence continued, caused him to be removed to the lunatic
asylum at Castle Hill, and placed under the care and management
of a convict named Ravenscroft, whom he ordered to receive him.
Having continued here for some time, Michael Hoare made his
escape, and committed a robbery. He was then returned into
Paramatta gaol for the remainder of his sentence.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden has stated in his evidence, that he had taken an
opportunity of representing to Governor Macquarrie the probable
consequences of the infliction of these punishments soon after
they were made known, but that the Governor declined any
interference with the sentences of the Criminal Court.</p>
<p>Upon the objectionable nature and duration of the punishment
complained of, it is hardly necessary for me now to observe. It
is to be regretted that Governor Macquarrie had not listened to
the first suggestions that were made to him on this occasion by
Mr. Marsden, and interposed the authority which he derived from
his commission, for the purpose of mitigating punishments that it
was plainly impossible or highly improper to execute.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden as well as Mr. Bailey appear to have been mistaken
in the effect that they attributed to the long and solitary
confinement of Michael Hoare. His violent demeanor in the gaol
had impressed them with a belief that he was insane; and as the
means of personal restraint could not be so easily applied there,
as under the direction of the medical attendant at the receptacle
of lunatics at Castle Hill, Mr. Marsden directed Michael Hoare to
be conveyed thither and confined, without previous reference to
Mr. West, the surgeon at Paramatta. After his escape from Castle
Hill, and apprehension for committing a robbery, Mr. West gave it
as his opinion that the man was not insane, and he was returned
to his original punishment. It seems somewhat extraordinary that
Mr. Marsden should have taken upon himself to decide upon his
insanity without a previous reference to Mr. West; but it appears
that this power has been exercised both by himself and Mr.
M&lsquo;Arthur upon their own view of the prisoners whom they
considered to be lunatics, and whenever their custody in the gaol
became (as in the case of Michael Hoare) a cause of annoyance and
disturbance to the other prisoners, or to the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>From the reluctance manifested by Mr. West to give any account
of the date in which he found the two other prisoners, Hall and
Allen, who had been sentenced to twelve months solitary
confinement, and from the destruction of the books of the
hospital, it was impossible to obtain materials for forming a
correct judgment, of the effect of the punishment upon them. One
of them had suffered from the effects of hard labour during the
early periods of his transportation; and from not receiving more
than the gaol allowance during ten months of his confinement, was
reduced to such a state of debility as to be unable to leave the
hospital for two years.</p>
<p>It does not appear that Mr. Marsden had any communication with
Governor Macquarrie respecting the effect that he found and
believed these punishments to have had upon the prisoners, but
having once pointed them out to his notice when the sentences
were passed, and the governor having then refused to interfere,
he felt that he could not make a second application with any hope
of success.</p>
<p>In this conclusion I do not conceive that Mr. Marsden was
justified; and it certainly was his duty, as visiting magistrate
of the gaol of Paramatta, to have obtained the opinion of the
surgeon; to have made an early representation of the effects
that, the severity of the punishments of the Criminal Court had
produced there, and through the governor to have submitted such a
statement and opinion to the notice of the judge advocate and
members of the Criminal Court.</p>
<p>As Mr. Marsden has further stated that he visited the
Paramatta gaol three times a week, the condition of the prisoners
in consequence of their reduced allowance must have been known to
him; and he must have felt assured, that any statement of that
condition to the governor, or even to the surgeon, would have
produced a temporary relief, at least, to the prisoners from the
severity of confinement and privation of food, whenever their
state of health required a relaxation of it.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie, in his observations upon Mr. Marsden's
evidence, has acquitted him of all blame in these transactions,
except of being a party to the statements made to your Lordship
by Mr. Bailey, and of being the dupe of the pretended insanity of
a convict. It is true that both Mr. Marsden and Mr. Bailey were
mistaken in imputing the violence of this man to insanity; and
Mr. Bailey addressed himself to Sir Henry Bunbury, under a strong
but mistaken impression of its cause, and with a belief that its
effect was likely to recur, under the administration of Governor
Macquarrie, as long and as often as the punishment of twelve
months and two years solitary confinement on bread and water was
inflicted by the Criminal Court. It is satisfactory, however, to
observe, that no similar instance has occurred of the infliction
of punishments in the colony in which resort has been had to such
lengthened periods of solitary confinement; and that with the
exception of those that have been noticed, the sentences of the
Criminal Courts have been considered to incline rather too much
to the side of mercy, and have always manifested that feeling
where any circumstance could furnish reasonable grounds of
doubt.</p>
<p>Considering the peculiar construction of the Criminal Court,
and the objections that have been made to it, as well as to the
exercise of its jurisdiction, in the petition that was addressed
to His Majesty in council, by several of the inhabitants of the
colony, on the 12th February 1819, I felt myself justified in
entering upon an examination of the particular cases to which the
defects and the objections alleged by the petitioners had any
reference, for the purpose of discovering, in the first place,
whether they proceeded from any defects in the constitution of
the charter itself, and were capable of remedy by an alteration
in it, or whether they had proceeded from the manner in which the
powers conferred by the charter hail been exercised.</p>
<p>Assuming, for the present, that the objections to the Criminal
Court made in the petition of the inhabitants, contain all
exposition of the sentiments of all the petitioners, or even of
the leading members, upon one most important subject, the
introduction of trial by jury, (a point to which I found upon
examination several of these individuals were still unfavourable,
although their names were signed to the petition,) I will proceed
to the examination of the objections that I am able to collect
from the language of the petition, as well as from other sources
to which I applied during my residence in the colony.</p>
<p>Taking them in the terms in which the petitioners have thought
proper to express themselves, the first ground of objection is,
the combination in the person of the judge advocate of the duties
of a magistrate, who commits the prisoner upon investigations
conducted by himself; of prosecutor, of jurymen, and of judge.
The second is, the military character of the court, to the
members of which there is no right of challenge, and from whose
decisions there is no right of appeal; the military title of the
presiding member, and the possible and indeed the actual
occurrence of cases wherein the accuser of a prisoner and the
party complaining of the offence, and against the offender, was a
member Of the court.</p>
<p>The next ground of objection is, the general unfitness and
incapacity of the Criminal Court, so constituted, to administer
impartial justice to the free and respectable population of the
colony, or to command veneration, awe and respect; the repugnance
of its form and proceedings to the feelings of the petitioners as
Englishmen, or to the proceedings and institutions of their
native country; and lastly, the petitioners stated that the lives
and liberties of the inhabitants of New South Wales, while under
the protection of such a court, could not be so well secured as
they ought to be, nor (they stated) could the laws of England be
administered with sufficient purity and impartiality.</p>
<p>From the communications that I held with Sir John Jamieson and
with Mr. Eagar upon the allegations of the petition, I felt it my
duty to cuter into an examination of the cases to which either
the one or the other had referred me for proof; and I now proceed
to submit to your Lordship such a statement of the circumstances
as I was enabled to collect, either from judicial documents, or
from the recollection of persons in whose opinions I thought most
confidence might be placed.</p>
<p>Taking the objections in the order in which the petitioners
have placed them, I find that with respect to the first, namely,
the combination of the characters of magistrate, juryman,
prosecutor and judge, in the same person, that both in the time
of Mr. Judge Advocate Bent, and Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, the
duties of examining and committing magistrate were unnecessarily
undertaken by both; and that latterly Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde
has ceased to perform them, except in one instance, in which out
of deference to the feelings of Governor Macquarrie, and in
consequence of his request, he proceeded in his character of
magistrate and public prosecutor, to investigate the publication
and composition of a libel upon the governor, of which an
individual was afterwards accused before the Criminal Court and
convicted. Neither Governor Macquarrie in making the request, nor
Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde in acceding to it, appear to have been
sufficiently aware of the effect of such a proceeding, or of the
impressions that it might create in the tribunal before whom the
cause was to be tried.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie had at first disregarded the publication,
and treated it with the contempt it deserved. When, however, he
resolved to make it the subject of prosecution, it is to be
regretted that he had not intrusted the investigation of the
authorship of the libel, the only question of difficulty that
could have arisen, to the management of Mr. Wylde, sen.
officially designated the solicitor of the crown, (and who
actually did give his assistance to his son the judge advocate on
this occasion), and to that of Mr. D. Wentworth the
superintendent of the police.</p>
<p>Another instance occurred in which the effect of combining so
many incompatible duties in the office of the judge advocate,
does appear to have been manifested in the proceedings instituted
by the Rev. Mr. Marsden against Mr. J. T. Campbell, the
governor's secretary, for a libel. I am aware that some of the
circumstances of this case have already been submitted to your
Lordship, but I think I should not do justice to the views that
your Lordship proposed in the institution of my Commission of
Inquiry, or to the characters of the individuals involved in the
circumstances of the transaction itself, if I did not in this
place take an opportunity of stating them, both as they affect
the character and conduct of these individuals, as well as the
character of the criminal judicature of the colony.</p>
<p>The libel of which the Rev. Mr. Marsden complained, had
appeared in the Sydney Gazette on the 4th January of the year
1817. Previous to this occurrence, and as early as the year 1814,
certain letters addressed by a person styling himself as "a
settler" had been inserted in the Sydney Gazette, affecting to
regret the want of a collection of books of useful information,
and expressing some surprise in the studied concealment, and also
in the restraint that had been observed in the use of those, that
the writer understood to have been intrusted to the Rev. Mr.
Marsden by certain pious and benevolent individuals in England,
for the benefit and instruction of the colony. This letter
produced a reply from Mr. Marsden, who contended that the books
were confided to his sole discretion; that the existence of such
a collection was well known, though not by public advertizement,
at least by the frequent loan of the books to individuals of
respectability, who had applied for them. Mr. Marsden conceiving
that the Sydney Gazette had been allowed to be made the vehicle
of insinuations prejudicial to his character upon this occasion;
and considering that it was altogether under the control of the
colonial government, applied to Governor Macquarrie for redress.
The governor declined to interfere, and referred Mr. Marsden to
the civil and criminal courts for the protection that he sought.
Mr. Marsden felt disappointment in the result of this
application, and was continued in his belief that Mr. Secretary
Campbell was the author of the letters signed "A Settler", or at
all events that he favoured their admission into the Sydney
Gazette. He did not however venture to make any appeal to the
civil and criminal courts. The suspicions that he entertained of
Mr. Campbell as the author of these letters, are now known to be
unfounded; and although in combination with other circumstances,
they left a strong impression upon the mind of Mr. Marsden, yet
he took no further step in his own vindication until his
attention vas called to the letter signed "Philo Free". On the
day after the appearance of this letter, Mr. Marsden waited upon
Governor Macquarrie, and again complained that the Sydney Gazette
should be made the vehicle of calumny and abuse against himself.
The governor expressed his deep regret that any thing should have
appeared in it to his prejudice; and although Mr. Marsden did not
request him to give up the printer, yet he informed him that he
would never rest satisfied till he had brought the author to
light.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden then addressed himself to Mr. Judge Advocate
Wylde, in a letter that appears to be dated on the 7th January
1817, in which, after very shortly pointing out to the notice of
the judge advocate the appearance of the letter signed "Philo
Free" in the Sydney Gazette, which he considered to be a libel
upon his private and public character, he requested the judge
advocate to file, or to allow him to file, a criminal information
against the printer. Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde has declared that
it was by this letter of Mr. Marsden that his attention was first
drawn to the publication in question, and deeming it expedient in
the first instance to ascertain whether the insertion of it had
been sanctioned by the authority of government, he addressed an
inquiry to that effect on the 11th January to Mr. Secretary
Campbell. To this inquiry he received an answer from Mr. Campbell
on the 14th, that is to be found in the Appendix. Mr. Campbell
here alleges the pressure of official business upon his attention
on the day in which the letter of "Philo Free" was submitted for
insertion in the Sydney Gazette, by which means the objectionable
passages in the letter had escaped his observation; that although
he felt a degree of satisfaction in the revival of the question
of the philanthropic society, with the discussion of which the
letter both began and concluded, he regretted that the
construction that Mr. Marsden had put upon the objectionable
passages had induced him to resort to judicial measures; but as
he had not thought proper to make him any official communication
on the subject, although he was aware that as secretary of the
government he was the censor of its press, he did not think it
incumbent upon him to make any attempt to procure him any
friendly explanation, to do away what he conceived to be
ill-grounded apprehensions; and that as under the exercise of his
judgment as censor, the letter of "Philo Free" was printed, he
felt it his duty to relieve the printer from any possible
responsibility, he having merely performed his duty, and he (Mr.
Campbell) having given the letter his official imprimatur.</p>
<p>A copy of this letter was enclosed to Mr. Marsden by Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde, together with a declaration of his opinion, that
although he felt great regret in observing the publication of any
remarks reflecting upon the conduct and labours of the Missionary
Societies in their attempts to civilize the inhabitants of the
South Sea islands, yet he was not able from his own knowledge to
discover in the letter such pointed application to any individual
member of those societies as would justify him in filing an
information against the printer of the Gazette. He however
stated, that although he did not conceive that he should be
warranted in preferring a public indictment in his own name and
character against the printer, he should be ready to comply with
Mr. Marsden's request of exhibiting any indictment that he might
think fit to present, upon being furnished with affidavits of
persons who might be willing to swear to their belief of the
application of the libel to Mr. Marsden but upon taking which
oath the judge advocate expressed a hope, "that such persons
would duly pause". This expression was interpreted by Mr. Marsden
into an attempt on the part of the judge advocate to throw
difficulties in his way of obtaining that evidence of the
application of the libel upon which alone an information could be
exhibited. Under this impression Mr. Marsden addressed two
letters to the judge advocate, in one of which, dated on the 17th
January, he complained of his reluctance to file an information
against the printer, as an exercise of discretion altogether new
in the administration of criminal justice in the colony, and
adverted to the practice observed of filing criminal information
in England by the attorney general, as well as that of granting
them on the application of the party to the Court of King's
Bench.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden, both in this and a subsequent letter, dated 23d
April, appears to have been misinformed of the nature of this
practice, and to have construed the difficulty that the judge
advocate felt in giving an individual application to the libel
into a reluctance on his part to commence any criminal
proceeding. It is much to be regretted that, in his first letter
to Mr. Marsden, the judge advocate should have exposed himself to
such suspicion, by the use of terms which, if understood as he
contended they were meant, in the shape of caution, were
altogether uncalled for from him; and which, if understood in the
shape of intimidation, were still more objectionable. In the same
letter, however, the judge advocate distinctly stated to Mr.
Marsden his willingness to prefer a public indictment, in his own
name and character, against the printer of the Sydney Gazette;
and there was certainly nothing in this letter that could justify
the language made use of by Mr. Marsden in his answer of the 17th
January, or in a subsequent letter of the 24th April. Upon
reference to these letters, I am much disposed to adopt the
conclusion to which Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde has come, that they
were not of Mr. Marsden's composition. As soon as Mr. Marsden
became sensible of the impropriety of the language he had used in
his letters to Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, he made a proper
apology; and as he and his advisers had at this period the
sagacity to discover the full value of the advantage that had
been placed in their hands by the communication that had been
made by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde of the letter of Mr. Secretary
Campbell, they construed all the efforts and persuasion that were
made use of by the judge advocate in his private interviews with
Mr. Marsden to come to some amicable adjustment of the business,
and his doubt of the personal application of the libel to him, (a
point of which hardly any persons in the community, that had had
opportunities of being acquainted with Mr. J. T. Campbell's
sentiments and conduct towards Mr. Marsden, or Mr. Marsden's
occupations on behalf of the Missionary Societies, entertained
any doubt), into a denial of that justice to which he was
entitled, and into an attempt to protect Mr. Campbell from the
consequences of a criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden had not at that time obtained the evidence of
Williams respecting the delivery of the libellous writing by Mr.
Campbell to the editor of the Sydney Gazette; but he and his
advisers were so strongly impressed with the belief that Mr.
Campbell was the author, that he frequently declared that he
would not rest satisfied with the public disavowal that was made
by Governor Macquarrie at the suggestion of Mr. Judge Advocate
Wylde, in the Sydney Gazette, nor with any thing short of a
criminal proceeding against the person whose avowal of
participation was in his hands, and whose more immediate
connection with the libel he felt assured he should be able to
prove.</p>
<p>In resisting all the efforts that were made by Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde to effect an amicable and private adjustment of
the affair, the mind of Mr. Marsden certainly appears to have
been more directed to means of punishment than to those of
vindication of character. Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde had in vain
pointed out to him, that, if vindication of his own character or
that of the Missionary Societies was his object, the Supreme
Court and not the Criminal Court was the tribunal to which he
must appeal. The mind of Mr. Marsden was suffering under the
sense of former as well as of later indignities, and his natural
disposition led him rather to persist in his right of prosecution
than in his claim to vindication. He accurately described his own
feelings, when he stated in his conversation with Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde, "that as he had been driven by the government
into a corner, and had thrown away the scabbard, he would never
give in till he had gained redress."</p>
<p>Your Lordship is already apprised of the disavowal made by
Governor Macquarrie of any sanction on his part to the appearance
of the libel in the Gazette, and of the declaration of his regret
that it should have found admission there; and although Mr.
Marsden is not disposed to give the governor that credit for his
early disavowal of all connection with the libel, which has
obtained your Lordship's approbation, yet I am now perfectly
satisfied, by a reference to dates, that the public disavowal
that was made by the governor could not have been made at an
earlier period; and that it does appear that the proposal for
making it came from Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde and not from the
governor, yet every disposition was manifested by him to adopt
that proposal, and to give it the earliest and most general
effect. The libel was published on the 4th January; the judge
advocate did not communicate with the governor respecting it till
the 7th; and as the former had deemed it necessary to address
himself to Mr. Campbell, to know whether, as censor of the press,
he disavowed all connection with the libel, he could not have
framed the governor's disavowal until he had received Mr.
Campbell's answer.</p>
<p>This answer was dated on the 14th January, and on the 15th the
governor's disavowal, that had been drawn up by the judge
advocate, was transmitted for insertion in the first Sydney
Gazette that was published afterwards, on the 18th January.</p>
<p>Whatever credit Mr. Marsden might be disposed to give to
certain pins of this declaration, in which the governor testified
his respect for the individuals and societies engaged in
missionary labours; yet with the conviction that Mr. Marsden felt
that Mr. Campbell was the real author of the libel, he considered
the declaration of "its having got admission into the Gazette
from inadvertence, and from the great pressure of other
business", to be unfounded, and he fully expected that he should
be able to prove it. A general belief indeed existed in the
colony, that Mr. Mr. Campbell was the author of the letter signed
"Philo Free"; and hardly any person who had been acquainted with
Mr. Marsden, doubted of the application of the most offensive
parts of the libel to him.</p>
<p>In obtaining the affidavits of these facts that were necessary
to support the indictment, it appears that Mr. Marsden met with
some difficulty. Mr. Jenkins, a retail merchant in Sydney, after
observing the language of the letter of Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde,
already alluded to, yielded to the caution that it enjoined, and
declined making any affidavit.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden has stated in his evidence, that one of the
magistrates declined taking, at a later period, the affidavit of
G. Williams, from apprehensions of the consequences, unless the
affidavit was read in open court when the magistrates were
assembled; and Mr. Hannibal M&lsquo;Arthur also declined it,
alleging that the subject of the indictment did not arise within
the limits of his jurisdiction at Paramatta.</p>
<p>The affidavits, however, were at last made before Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde and Mr. Wentworth. These affidavits, containing
the declarations of George Williams the compositor in the office
in which the Sydney Gazette was printed, were not sworn until the
24th April 1817, which was three days after the filing and
receipt of the information against Mr. Campbell in the office of
the clerk of the peace.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden and his advisers not thinking it safe to submit
the evidence of this man to the observation of any individual
whatever until the trial should take place, the information
against Mr. Campbell had been kept back until the session of the
Criminal Court was about to commence; and Mr. Marsden did not
transmit the depositions that he had received in support of the
information until the 25th April, two days before the session
opened.</p>
<p>The information against Mr. Campbell was drawn by Mr.
Marsden's solicitor, Mr. Moore; and in the evidence of these
gentlemen there is a pointed contradiction to the declaration of
Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde and his father, the clerk of the peace,
as to the fact of any solicitation or intimation having been
given by them or either of them, that the information should be
drawn in one of their offices. Whatever doubts may exist as to
the suggestion of Mr. Wylde, sen. to Mr. Moore I think it very
improbable that his son, the judge advocate, would have consented
to undertake the responsibility of drawing the information after
the discussion that had taken place between himself and Mr.
Marsden.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore was very anxious that the trial should take place
during the session of the Criminal Court that commenced on the
27th April 1817; and he has stated, that he was first informed by
Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, on presenting the information to him,
that Mr. Campbell had a right to traverse until the next session
of the Criminal Court after that in which the information was
filed.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, Mr. Campbell availed himself of this right
by the advice of his solicitor Mr. Garling; and after he had
given bail for his appearance, the trial of the information was
deferred until the next sessions of the Criminal Court, that took
place in the month of October. By this delay a change unexpected,
but not unimportant to the interests of the parties, took place
in the members of the Criminal Court, by the removal and
departure from the colony of the 46th regiment, and the arrival
of the 43th.</p>
<p>The officers of the former regiment had been some tune in the
colony, and had become acquainted with the characters both of Mr.
Marsden and Mr. Campbell, whereas the officers of the 48th
regiment came to the trial of the indictment under an entire
ignorance of it, or of the application of the libellous matter to
the character and conduct of Mr. Marsden.</p>
<p>Previous to the trial Mr. Marsden, having thought it advisable
to obtain the assistance of another solicitor, retained Mr. Amos,
who, after attending one consultation, gave up his brief on the
day before the trial took place. As this abrupt retirement of Mr.
Amos from the cause had been imputed to an apprehension of the
consequences of giving his assistance in the crimination of an
officer so nearly connected with the government as Mr. Campbell,
I made some inquiry into that circumstance; and, although the
death of Mr. Amos soon after my arrival in the colony, deprived
me of the benefit of his evidence, it appears that Mr. Moore was
senior in rank to Mr. Amos, and as the latter had not approved of
the course of proceeding that had been adopted, or that was
intended to be pursued, and had only been consulted when it was
too late to make any change in it, he declined any further
assistance.</p>
<p>The trial of the information took place at Sydney on the 21st
of October 1817, and the members of the court consisted of
Lieutenant-colonel Cimitiere, Major Druitt, Captain Morisset,
Captain Parry, Lieutenant Cuthbertson, and Lieutenant Leroux.</p>
<p>Previous to the day of trial, the judge advocate had intimated
to Mr. Moore, Mr. Marsden's solicitor, the doubts that he felt in
admitting the opinions of witnesses upon the application of the
libellous matter complained of and his wish that Mr. Moore should
be prepared to show authorities for admitting such evidence.</p>
<p>The trial of the information lasted three days, and contrary
to the suggestions of the judge advocate, as to the necessity of
his appearance, Mr. J. T. Campbell persisted in his determination
to remain in court.</p>
<p>The judge advocate's report of the trial is contained in the
Appendix. It is stated by him to be copied from his own notes;
and, as in the progress of the cause, certain points of evidence
arose which the judge advocate has also stated could not be noted
down at the time of trial, he has added to the report some
remarks of his own noon the nature of those points, and the
evidence that the court permitted to be given respecting the
connection and duties of Mr. Marsden as agent of the Missionary
Societies, as well as upon the determination of the court not to
admit as evidence the opinions of individuals of the application
of the libel to Mr. Marsden.</p>
<p>Respecting the first point, Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde has
reported that he first intimated to the members of the court the
objection that there was to receive in a criminal proceeding for
libel against Mr. Marsden, as agent of the Missionary Societies
in England, any evidence of the nature of Mr. Marsden's
transactions as their agent; but that he yielded, as he was bound
to do, to the wish expressed by the members of the court to enter
upon that inquiry, more especially as the result was likely to
afford to them the means of forming a judgment of the malice that
had prompted the writing and publication of the libel. This
course of inquiry was at first opposed by Mr. Marsden's solicitor
as contrary to the rules of proceeding in indictments for libel,
and as affording to the party indicted all the benefit or a plea
of justification; but as Mr. Marsden had defied every inquiry
into the nature of his own conduct as agent to the Missionary
Societies, and openly professed and manifested a wish for the
fullest investigation that the court could make, the course of
inquiry into that point obtained all latitude, and from the
active part that be took in it appears to have derived every
assistance from the judge advocate himself.</p>
<p>Respecting the second point, I must observe that the judge
advocate had required from Mr. Marsden the sworn declarations of
individuals of the application of the libellous matter to Mr.
Marsden, as an indispensible preliminary to receiving the
information; but as he was so much impressed with the general
objection to the nature of such evidence, he felt it his duty at
the trial to oppose the admission of it. He stated it as his
opinion, that witnesses should not be allowed to depose that, in
their opinion, particular passages of a libellous publication
applied particularly to the party that complained of it; and that
the utmost that they could be allowed to state was, the facts and
circumstances upon which their belief of the application was
founded; and that it was for the court to determine from those
filets, or from the context of the libel, whether the application
of it, as stated in the innuendoes of the information, was justly
made out.</p>
<p>Upon a perusal of this report, and upon reference to the
practice observed in cases of libel where the allusions are
obscure, of receiving the declarations of individuals as to their
belief of the application and meaning of such allusions,
justified as it is by the frequent impossibility of obtaining
satisfactory evidence on those points from any other sources, I
have not been able to coincide in the reasons upon which Mr.
Judge Advocate Wylde objected to receive it in the case of Mr.
Marsden. The doubts that he himself first entertained of the
application of the libel to Mr. Marsden showed the necessity of
having recourse to the opinions of others who had more perfect
knowledge of the circumstance; and who with that knowledge could
declare their opinion that the allusions in the libel applied to
Mr. Marsden, and could apply to nobody else.</p>
<p>It appears by the judge advocate's notes, that the
declarations of Mr. Marsden upon this subject were received; bat
other witnesses were prevented from stating their opinion of the
application of certain passages of the libel to him, although
they were permitted to state the circumstances upon which the
court might come to that conclusion.</p>
<p>The principal witness, that deposed to the Act of publication
as well as to the hand-writing of the libel, was a person named
George Williams, who was a compositor in the office of the editor
of the Sydney Gazette, and who swore that he saw Mr. Campbell
deliver the manuscript, from which he afterwards composed, into
the hands of the editor, George Howe, who delivered it to
him.</p>
<p>Williams also swore, that he believed the manuscript to be in
the same handwriting as other papers that had come from Mr.
Campbell's office, but that he had never seen Mr. Campbell write.
This evidence of Williams was met by the positive contradiction
of George Howe, the editor of the Gazette, who was said to be
present when Mr. Campbell came into his office; and much
discredit was thrown upon the evidence of Williams, by imputing
enmity and animosity to him for having been dismissed from his
situation of compositor, in consequence of refusing to insert an
advertizement of Samuel Terry in the Gazette, disclaiming any
support to a petition to the House of Commons against Governor
Macquarrie, and offering a reward of 100<i>l</i>. to any person
who would give information of the author of such a report. For
his refusal on this occasion, as well as from having signed the
petition himself, Williams had been dismissed from his situation
in the printing office by an order of Governor Macquarrie; and as
he had attributed his dismissal to the interposition and
influence of Mr. Campbell, it was alleged by Howe that he had
ever since entertained and expressed the greatest animosity
against him. He underwent a long and severe cross-examination on
these points, which was principally conducted by Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde, who considered that there was such slight
evidence of the hand-writing of Mr. Campbell, and that evidence
so little deserving of credit, that he acceded to the objection
that was made by Mr. Campbell's solicitor to have the libel
read.</p>
<p>The other members of the court, however, were of a different
opinion. The letter of Mr. Campbell to the judge advocate was put
in as evidence against the former, and read without
objection.</p>
<p>The libel was then read; and after one count of the
information had been struck out on account of a variation between
the words "let" and "led", that was held to be fatal as varying
the sense, and another had been given up by the solicitor for the
prosecution for the same reason, evidence was tendered by him for
the purpose of discrediting one of his own witnesses whose
testimony had been unfavorable. To this evidence Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde objected, and quoted the authorities to show that
it was not admissible. The court, however, resolved to receive
it.</p>
<p>After the evidence for the prosecution was closed, Mr.
Garling, the solicitor for Mr. Campbell, delivered a long address
to the court, in the course of which he indulged in some
allusions of a personal and rather indelicate nature to the
consequences that attended the intercourse of the missionaries
and their agent, Mr. Marsden, with the natives of the South Sea
Islands; a course of observation that was quite at variance with
the sentiments of respect that had been publicly professed for
the labours of the missionaries, and not very consistent with
that which was clue to the office of principal chaplain of the
colony.</p>
<p>The defendant having offered no evidence, the court on the
third day of trial retired to consider of their verdict, and
after deliberation found that the defendant, Mr. Campbell, was
"Guilty of having permitted a public letter to be printed in the
Sydney Gazette, which tended to vilify the public conduct of Mr.
Marsden, the prosecutor, as the agent of the Missionary Societies
for propagating the gospel to the South Seas, which it was in the
power of the defendant, in his official capacity as secretary to
his excellency the governor of the territory, to have prevented
the publication of."</p>
<p>As the judge advocate felt and was sensible that objections
might be made to the terms and import of this verdict, he
considered that it was better to reserve all observations upon
the case in open court until sentence was pronounced, or until
the objections were disposed of.</p>
<p>On the 27th October Mr. Moore stated to the court, as well as
in a letter to the judge advocate, that, as Mr. Marsden professed
to be actuated by no vindictive feeling towards Mr. Secretary
Campbell, it would be proper to solicit of the court that no
judgment should pass, and requested a respite of the judgment
until he should have an opportunity of consulting him; but when,
on the 29th October, Mr. Campbell's solicitor pressed for it,
that the public might not misunderstand the grounds upon which
the judgment was waived, Mr. Moore stated that it was Mr.
Marsden's intention to bring an action for damages in the Supreme
Court, where the defendant might have an opportunity of pleading
and proving a justification.</p>
<p>The court having considered that the prosecutor waived the
judgment, the judge advocate had not feel himself called upon to
make any observations; and the court having further determined
that the defendant should have leave to depart, his recognizances
were discharged. Here all proceedings against Mr. Campbell in the
Criminal Court terminated. Mr. Marsden, however, having felt that
some imputations and reflections had been cast upon his character
as agent of the Missionary Societies, in the address of Mr.
Campbell's solicitor to the Criminal Court, and as it had been
alleged that he had indicted Mr. Campbell in that court from an
apprehension of justification in the Supreme Court, determined
with the advice of his solicitor and friends to bring an action
against Mr. Campbell for damages. He brought his action
accordingly. The defendant pleaded the general issue; but his
solicitor having stated that he should apply to the court to put
off the trial, on account of the absence of some witnesses that
he expected from New Zealand, the solicitor of Mr. Marsden, who
was very anxious to bring on the trial for the purpose of being
able to transmit the result to England by a ship then preparing
to sail, subscribed a paper, by which he agreed to admit at the
trial "that the Missionary Societies fur promoting Christian
Knowledge and Religion had been the means (of course
unintentionally) of introducing in the islands of the South Seas,
the art of distillation, and the use of musquets and cutlasses;
and that pigs, pine trees, and New Zealand flax, had been
articles of barter between the natives of the said islands and
the missionaries at those places." The defendant's solicitor thus
endeavoured to obtain the advantage of a plea of justification,
without the acknowledgment of the authorship of the libel, which
that plea must necessarily have carried with it.</p>
<p>The trial for the libel took place in the Supreme Court on the
1st of December 1817, and a verdict in favour of Mr. Marsden was
given for the sum of 200<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>At my request to the judge of the Supreme Court, I was
furnished with his report of the trial, in which, whatever doubt
might have existed amongst the members of the Criminal Court
respecting the authorship of Mr. Campbell, was now set at rest by
the declaration of Michael Robinson, the principal clerk in his
office, who swore that he saw the manuscript of the libel before
it was printed; that it was in Mr. Campbell's hand-writing, and
that he had told him (Robinson) that he had copied it from a
manuscript that he received on the same morning, but which was so
illegible that he was obliged to transcribe it for
publication.</p>
<p>In the course of this trial, the judge of the Supreme Court
differed entirely with the judge advocate in the view that he had
taken of certain points of evidence that arose in both cases.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Field felt no difficulty in admitting the opinions
and belief of witnesses as to the application of the libel to Mr.
Marsden, and justified it by every day's practice in England, and
by a reference to the authority of Fitzgibbon. He also refused to
admit the letter of Mr. Campbell to the judge advocate, that had
been read in the Criminal Court; and thought that it would be
better for the purposes of criminal justice in the colony, that
the judge advocate should be allowed to treat whatever
information came to his knowledge as the officer of the crown,
intrusted with some degree of discretion as to the exhibition of
criminal charges, as protected from disclosure. Mr. Justice Field
further differed from the course of proceeding in the Criminal
Court, by refusing to admit a cross-examination of the
plaintiff's witnesses, or to receive the admission that had been
made by his attorney, as to the truth of the libel, where no
justification had been pleaded. This difference of opinion
between the judges of the colony, together with the different
issue of the two trials had not fail to make a strong impression
on the public mind; and although the doubts that seemed to have
been entertained upon the question of Mr. Campbell's authorship
and hand-writing by the members of the Criminal Court, were
removed by the new evidence of that fact, that had been so
unexpectedly procured in the Supreme Court, yet the terms in
which the verdict of the Criminal Court was expressed occasioned
a considerable degree of surprise.</p>
<p>My attention having been drawn to this circumstance, I felt it
my duty to request of the judge advocate an explanation of the
view that had been taken of the ease by himself; as well as by
the members of the Criminal Court, when they came to deliberate
on the verdict.</p>
<p>To this request the judge advocate assented; and in his
examination has stated, that although the members did not think
there was sufficient evidence to find Mr. Campbell guilty of
writing or publishing the libel, yet that they considered the act
of allowing the insertion of the libel in the Gazette, when Mr.
Campbell was censor of the press from which it issued, to be one
for which Mr. Campbell was criminally responsible.</p>
<p>Before I make any comments either upon the nature of this
proceeding, or of the authority exercised by the judge advocate
in exhibiting criminal charges, it may be necessary to advert to
the relative situations and motives that appeared to actuate both
Mr. Marsden and Mr. Campbell in the unfortunate transaction that
I have just now detailed, as I was enabled to collect them either
from the parties themselves, or from other sources of
information.</p>
<p>Disputes, partly of a personal, and partly of a more public
nature, bad frequently taken place between Mr. Secretary Campbell
and Mr. Marsden, from the year 1814 to the year 1817; in the
course of which Mr. Campbell having observed the pertinacity with
which Mr. Marsden adhered to his opinions, and having thought
that he showed great indifference for all projects that did not
immediately originate with himself, or that he was not permitted
to guide and direct, was not disposed to give Mr. Marsden that
credit for disinterested motives, or for that genuine
philanthropy and benevolence that had obtained for him a very
unqualified share of praise in certain publications in England,
in which the proceedings and the success of the Missionary
Societies were noticed.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden was likewise observed to be engaged in a variety
of occupations which, though useful in themselves, were rather of
a secular than of a religious kind, and did not altogether
consist with the dignity of the ecclesiastical character.</p>
<p>The circumstances that more immediately led to the publication
of the libel, originated in the formation of a society at the end
of the year 1813, that took place on the suggestion of Mr.
Marsden for the protection of the natives of the South Sea
Islands against the outrages of the crews of European or colonial
vessels; for the support of the claims of the natives on the
masters and owners of the vessels who brought them to New South
Wales; for taking care that justice was done to their persons and
property; and for promoting the civilization of the South Sea
islanders, by disseminating amongst them the principles of
Christianity, and instructing them in simple and useful arts as
long as they remained in the colony.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie was patron of this society; Mr. Deputy
Commissary General Allan was appointed treasurer; the Rev. Mr.
Marsden, secretary; and Mr. Jenkins, collector of the
contributions.</p>
<p>The proceedings of this society consisted of certain inquiries
that took place at the instance of some of the members, before
the magistrates, into acts of violence committed on the persons
of the South Sea islanders, by sailors and others; but as the
magistrates found that they had no authority to punish these
offences, the efficacy of the society in promoting one of the
principal objects, was much diminished.</p>
<p>A few New Zealanders were taken care of by Mr Marsden at his
house at Paramatta, and upon a refusal of the treasurer, Mr
Allan, to pay some of the expenses that had been incurred in
their maintenance, because they had not received the previous
sanction of a committee, Mr. Marsden ceased to pay any further
attention to the proceedings of the society. None in fact took
place, except at a subsequent meeting, that was called for the
purpose of ascertaining, and distributing to the member, the
amount of the funds that they had subscribed and paid into the
hands of the collector, and which it was asserted that Mr.
Marsden had once proposed and attempted to apply to the purposes
of the different missions that he superintended in the South
Seas. After some inquiry I did not find that this assertion was
confirmed.</p>
<p>Previous to the formation of this society, Governor Macquarrie
had proposed to Mr. Marsden to form another, for the civilization
of the native black inhabitants of New South Wales. Mr. Marsden,
though not averse to this proposition, stated to Governor
Macquarrie, that from his observation of the character of the
black natives, he had great doubts of the success of any scheme
of civilization in weaning them from their natural habits, or
subduing their aversion to restraint. He, however, suggested,
that if any attempt was to be made, the best prospects of success
would be afforded by instructing the younger natives in common
agricultural operations, and making them sensible of the benefits
immediately derivable from the cultivation of the earth.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie was led to infer an indifference, at
least, on the part of Mr. Marsden to his schemes; and as he
happened to be absent at New Zealand when the establishment was
formed at Paramatta, no interest either in its direction or
management was assigned to him. As he was resident chaplain at
that place, Mr. Marsden regarded the omission of his name and
services as a studied neglect on the part of the governor, and he
therefore never paid any attention to its concerns, and never
visited the school.</p>
<p>It had been customary for Governor Macquarrie to assemble as
ninny of the black natives as could be collected together at
Paramatta on one day in the year, with a view to conciliate them,
and to testify the interest that the British government took in
their improvement.</p>
<p>Although the members of the committee only were specially
invited to attend on these occasions, several of the inhabitants
were in the habit of coming to witness the ceremony, which was
certainly an interesting one. At that which took place art
Paramatta in December 1816, Mr. Campbell, when accompanying
Governor Macquarrie, had observed that Mr. Marsden was engaged in
a visit to a house in the town, that they passed on their way to
the assembly of the black natives. Considering this to wear the
appearance of a studied insult to the governor, as well as to the
institution that he patronized, he gave vent to the warmth of his
indignation in the letter of Philo Free, the libel for the
composition and publication of which he was afterwards tried.</p>
<p>The investigation and punishment of such an offence, in a
civil officer holding a high situation in the colony, could not
Phil to attract attention to the conduct of every person engaged
in that duty, and it was an event that might be said to put to a
severe test the exercise of the judicial functions of the
Criminal Court. It was partly with this view, and also in
consequence of a belief that I felt justified in entertaining
that your Lordship had not received information of the result of
the trial in the Supreme Court, or of Mr. Campbell being the
author of the libellous letter of Philo Free, that I have been
induced to enter into such a lengthened detail of the proceedings
and circumstances that had led to it.</p>
<p>In submitting my opinion to your Lordship upon the conduct of
Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, I have to consider it in three points
of view: In that of law-adviser to the governor of New South
Wales; in that of public prosecutor, and in that of member of the
Criminal Court, invested with no greater share of authority than
the other members, but virtually exercising an influence over
their decisions by the manifestation of own opinion, or by a
reference to the authority of others.</p>
<p>The character in which the judge advocate's name appeared to
be connected with this transaction, I have stated to be that of
law-adviser; for although the terms of his commission do not
appear to warrant that construction, yet it was as natural for
the governor to expect, as for the judge advocate to presume,
that in such a remote colony as that of New South Wales, and in
the absence of any regular appointment, representations should be
made by him to the governor upon all subjects in which legal
advice was necessary.</p>
<p>The judge advocate had every reason to believe that the came
course had been pursued by his predecessor, and he felt desirous
to afford the same assistance to Governor Macquarrie whenever he
deemed such assistance necessary. It was in the first of these
characters, therefore, that Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde submitted to
Governor Macquarrie the propriety of testifying, in the most
public manner, his disapprobation of the letter of Philo Free,
and drew up the order that was published in the Gazette.</p>
<p>By the same channel the public were informed that the
governor's attention to this publication had been drawn by the
judge advocate, and that communications had passed respecting it
between the governor, the judge advocate, and Mr. Campbell, which
led the governor to express his regret that, by inadvertence and
pressure of business, the objectionable parts of the publication
had escaped the observation of his secretary.</p>
<p>I have already stated to your Lordship my reasons for thinking
that the latter part of this declaration was premature; and I
have now further to observe, that it would have been expedient
that all mention of the judge advocate's name, either in any
preliminary discussion respecting the question of Mr. Campbell's
responsibility, or in having called the governor's attention to
the letter, should have been avoided.</p>
<p>The connection of the judge advocate's judicial character with
that of law-adviser or public prosecutor would not have appeared:
and Governor Macquarrie would have received the credit which was
justly due to him, for an early and spontaneous disavowal of all
participation in any attempt to injure the cause or character of
the Missionary Establishments in the South Seas.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde entertained a
hope that the disavowal of the governor, thus publicly made,
would satisfy Mr. Marsden; and that all further proceedings would
be dropped, when it was declared that the insertion of the libel
in the Gazette was owing to inadvertence on the part of Mr.
Campbell. Before, however, the judge advocate proceeded to act
upon such an expectation, and before the faith of the governor
was pledged to it, it would have been right as well as prudent to
have consulted Mr. Marsden, and to have ascertained whether the
excuses of inadvertence and pressure of business had brought the
same conviction to his mind that they had done to that of the
governor. By allowing his name to be annexed to a public
disavowal that had been made after a consideration of those
excuses, and upon the faith of them, the judge advocate found
himself placed in the awkward predicament of having afterwards to
try their validity.</p>
<p>The next character in which the conduct of the judge advocate
is to be considered is that of public prosecutor.</p>
<p>In the earlier stages of the proceeding the judge advocate
appears to have been impressed with a strong desire of effecting
a reconciliation between Mr. Marsden and Mr. Campbell, and has
explained in his evidence the efforts that he made to produce
that result. In making these efforts the judge advocate had one
interview with Mr. Campbell, and not being able to anticipate any
successful result to his efforts of mediation, he from that time
ceased to have any communication with him, and equally withdrew,
as much as he found it possible, from further interview with Mr.
Marsden. It is, however, to be regretted that the judge advocate
should have thought it necessary to transmit Mr. Campbell's first
answer to his inquiry, respecting the authority under which the
letter of Philo Free had appeared in the Gazette, to Mr. Marsden.
The remarks contained in that letter were not of a conciliatory
kind, or calculated to appease the irritation that the appearance
of the libel had excited; and this circumstance may he stated as
some justification of the warmth of observation in which the
Reverend Mr. Marsden indulged in the second letter that he wrote
to the judge advocate.</p>
<p>The judge advocate very justly deprecated the further
discussion of a subject calculated to inflame animosities between
two individuals filling such high and respectable offices in the
colony; but in his anxiety to avert it, he does not appear to
have been fully aware of the difficulties in which his acts of
mediation, however well intended, might place him, when he came
to fulfil the more disagreeable duties of public prosecutor and
judge.</p>
<p>In fulfilling the former duty, Mr. Marsden has complained that
the judge advocate appeared to decline the prosecution of Mr.
Campbell, because he seemed to consider that more substantial
affidavits were necessary than Mr. Marsden at first was willing
to afford. The witness by whose evidence Mr. Marsden intended to
prove the publication and delivery, as well as the composition of
the libel by Mr. Campbell, was in a very dependent situation; and
had been dismissed from a lucrative one, in the office of the
editor of the Sydney Gazette, in the month of February 1817, by
an order of Governor Macquarrie.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden has stated in his evidence the reasons that
induced him to postpone the filing of the affidavit of this
witness, until the information against Mr. Campbell was filed. Of
the validity of those reasons he was the best Judge; but he
cannot allege that there was reluctance on the part of the judge
advocate to receive or admit the information against Mr.
Campbell, when he acknowledges that he detained in his own hands
the evidence by which it was to be mainly supported. The
difficulty that the judge advocate experienced at first, in
perceiving the application of the libel to Mr. Marsden, might
well arise from his having lately arrived in the colony, and from
being a stranger to the discussions and disputes between Mr.
Marsden and Mr. Campbell; but I confess that I have not been able
to acquiesce in the reason for augmenting that difficulty, in
giving cautions and admonitions at such an early period of the
prosecution to those by whose opinions alone this difficulty
could have been removed.</p>
<p>It does not appear that, in the exercise of his duty as public
prosecutor, the judge advocate had recourse to the measure that
is usual in prosecutions for libel, of offering indemnity to the
editor of a newspaper on condition of giving up the real author,
and Mr. Marsden has complained of this as a farther want of
co-operation or assistance.</p>
<p>However consistent it might have been with his duties as
public prosecutor to have adopted this measure, I cannot agree
with Mr. Marsden, that in the situation in which he was likely to
be placed, of sitting in judgment upon the editor of the Sydney
Gazette, the judge advocate would have consulted the dignity of
that office, by entering into terms of compromise with the editor
before the trial. Mr. Marsden having undertaken to prosecute him
for the libel against himself, it was competent for him to have
made such an offer, and to have acted upon it there was no
necessity for the judge advocate to undertake the duty, and the
non-performance of it affords no presumption of reluctance to
give due assistance to Mr. Marsden.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden has further complained of the refusal of the judge
advocate to issue subp&oelig;nas to his witnesses, except at his
expense. This circumstance appears to have arisen from the recent
establishment of the office of clerk of the peace, in the person
of Mr. Wylde, sen. who considered himself entitled to the same
fees that are charged in England for subp&oelig;nas in
prosecutions that are conducted by individuals.</p>
<p>It does not appear, however, that the fees that were so
demanded were ever paid by Mr. Marsden.</p>
<p>The conduct of Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde during the trial of
the information is much complained of by Mr. Marsden, and it does
appear that the length and severity of his inquiries into his
conduct as agent of the Missionary Societies, and of the nature
of the terms of purchase of the brig Active by his own funds,
were certainly protracted beyond the bounds that the ordinary
practice in cases of libel has justified. The course of inquiry
was to all appearance reversed, and Mr. Marsden's, and not Mr.
Campbell's conduct seemed to be the object of crimination. The
advice, or rather the opinions, delivered by the judge advocate
in the course of the trial, and the points in which they were
adverse to the prosecution, have been stated; and I have also had
occasion to explain my reasons for not concurring in the opinion
that was held by the learned judge upon one very important point.
In the opinions upon others that he is stated to have delivered
in court, he was justified by the strict practice of the English
courts, and he was clearly justified in stopping the attempt made
by the prosecutor to discredit his own witness when he found that
his evidence was unfavourable to him. As to the verdict that Mr.
Judge Advocate Wylde delivered as a member of the Criminal Court,
I certainly do not conceive that either himself, or any other
member of that tribunal, can now be made responsible for it; nor
in my investigations upon that subject did I conceive it my duty
to throw that responsibility upon them. Upon the evidence as it
stood in the Criminal Court, and upon the unsupported declaration
of the witness Williams, no satisfactory proof of the guilt of
Mr. Campbell was established; and although the judge advocate did
not succeed in convincing the minds of the officers who composed
the Criminal Court, that moral evidence could not be allowed to
operate in a case where legal evidence had failed, yet I do not
conceive that he should be considered responsible for the terms
of a verdict, upon which, although it would have been impossible
to have sustained a judgment, or to have inflicted punishment
consistently with the principles of English law, yet there was in
other respects a conformity to the evidence and the facts as
proved. Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde expressed to me a belief, that
in conformity to the terms of the verdict the members would have
been strongly disposed to have awarded punishment; but I do not
find that he ever stated to them his opinion of the difficulties
there would have been in supporting such a decision.</p>
<p>Respecting the influence exercised by the judge advocate over
the opinions and deliberations of the members of the court, it is
much to be regretted that the evidence, as well as the law
applying to it, had not been recapitulated from the judge
advocate's notes before the members retired. The practice of the
court had certainly been otherwise; but in a prosecution of this
nature, in the event of which the community naturally took a warm
interest, and where it was important that the principles of the
decision should have been known, it would have been very
desirable that Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde should have followed the
course that was adopted by Isis predecessor, Mr. Ellis on a
memorable trial, in which very strong reasons existed for
submitting to public observation both the opinions and the
discretion of the presiding member of the Criminal Court, as well
as for vindicating in the eyes of the community the course that
he himself had taken.</p>
<p>As I found that much had been said, both at the period of the
trial and subsequently, of the vindictive spirit that Mr. Marsden
had manifested. and of his reluctance to come to any terms of
reconciliation with Mr. Campbell, I think it necessary to observe
that Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde had himself acknowledged, in one of
his later conversations with Mr. Marsden, that considering all
the circumstances that had occurred he could not blame him for
proceeding.</p>
<p>The occurrences that I have stated to have taken place at the
trial in the Criminal Court were such as, in my opinion,
completely to justify Mr. Marsden in the appeal that he made to
the Supreme Court; and although an admission was made by his
attorney, as to the transactions in which he had engaged on
behalf of the Missionary Societies with the South Sea Islands,
yet I do not think that any thing was established by that
admission, which, if it had been made use of, would have
impeached the character of Mr. Marsden or of the societies for
whom he was engaged; and the authority both of Mr. Judge Advocate
Wylde and of Mr. Garling, the solicitor of Mr. Campbell, may be
appealed to in confirmation of that opinion. In the Criminal
Court it was proved, that the Missionary Societies had sustained
losses by the trade that they carried on with the South Sea
Islands, and that although the active participation and zeal of
Mr. Marsden in that, as well as his other undertakings, might
have made him less sensible than he ought to have been to the
impropriety of combining operations of a mercantile nature with
the duties of his profession, yet I do not find that in this
instance it extended further than the purchase of a vessel with
his own funds for the benefit and for the purposes of the
Missionary Societies. The general business and concerns of those
societies were conducted by a mercantile house of the first
respectability in Sydney, and I was not able to discover other
instances in which Mr. Marsden was implicated to any greater
extent on their account.</p>
<p>As these were the only points affecting Mr. Marsden's
character that were attempted to be touched upon at the trial, I
do not think it necessary at present to dwell upon any others, to
which they might afford ground of observation; and I will only
add that every opportunity was offered by Mr. Marsden at the
trials to promote an inquiry into the merits of his conduct, and
a bold defiance given to prove the truth of the assertions upon
which it was attacked.</p>
<p>Upon the circumstances that affect the conduct of Mr. Campbell
in this transaction, though more painful it is less necessary to
dwell, as they must be easily collected from the detail that has
now been given. It is equally to be lamented that he should have
silently consented to the insertion of a public order in the
Sydney Gazette by Governor Macquarrie, wherein he allowed him to
assign reasons of inadvertence for an act that was afterwards
proved to have been wilful; and that he should have allowed the
feelings of indignation that had been to warmly excited in his
own breast against Mr. Marsden to be displayed in the pages of a
gazette, wherein he had hitherto to, well succeeded in
controlling the indignant or violent feelings of others.</p>
<p>This sudden abuse of the power, that Mr. Campbell possessed
over the press of New South Wales, was hardly more censurable
than the attempt that was afterwards made in the same paper, and
according to the declaration of Howe, the editor, with the
concurrence of Mr. Campbell, apparently for the purpose of
supporting the truth of the excuses of his inadvertence, and of
showing the impossibility of his being the author of the letter
of Philo Free. This extraordinary publication appeared in the
Sydney Gazette of 1st November 1817, in the shape of "Comments on
the Trial of Mr. Campbell". They are stated at considerable
length, in consequence of a pledge that is said to have been
given by the editor to afford to the public at a subsequent
opportunity an account of the trial.</p>
<p>In giving this account the editor asserts, that in the
Criminal Court the testimony of the witnesses had failed in
establishing any of the points at issue, or in meeting the
allegations set forth in the information. He asserts that the
prosecution was left to rest on the letter that had been written
by the defendant to the judge advocate in his official
department; and "boldly appeals to the opinions of several
persons who were present in court when the letter was read, who,
without hesitation, acquitted him of the guilt or the culpability
imputed to him, and who were quite unable to deduce from the
letter one solitary circumstance that went to give a colour to
the prosecution against him."</p>
<p>The editor denominates this letter, "Presumed Testimony". He
then comments upon the verdict, which he terms a special verdict,
and such as he did not consider that the law of England
authorized a court now to give in eases of libel. He particularly
alludes to the qualification that had been given to the character
of the libel, and the presumption that it afforded, that, in the
opinion of the court, the letter of Philo Free was not libellous;
and concludes with the following passage: "Thus ended the first
trial for a libel in this country; and if we may judge of the
anxious manner in which the defendant sued for judgment, in
order, as his solicitor stated, that the opinion of the court
might go forth into the world, as to their sense of, and the
share the defendant had in committing that offence, we think we
may be at liberty to yield to the impression, that the
defendant's feelings would have been more highly gratified had
the sentence of the court been formally pronounced and
record."</p>
<p>The judge advocate has stated, that he deemed the comments
contained in this letter to be so improper, as to call upon Mr.
Campbell's solicitor for an explanation of it. Finding that Mr.
Campbell's solicitor entertained the same opinion of this letter
that he did, and that it had been inserted without his knowledge
or advice, the judge advocate directed him to prepare a statement
for the purpose of correcting the account that had already
appeared. Mr. Garling has declared that he sent this account to
the Sydney Gazette office for insertion, and that it was
refused.</p>
<p>By the evidence of Howe, the editor of the Sydney Gazette, it
appears that this comment on the trial was in the handwriting of
Michael Robinson, the chief clerk in Mr. Campbell's office, but
it had been seen by Mr. Campbell previous to insertion.</p>
<p>The insertion of this document, and the representations it
conveys of the proceedings in the Criminal Court, together with
the attempt to lead the opinion of the community, by imputing
sentiments to the members which they had never expressed either
in the court or out of it, must be considered as an aggravated
abuse of the power exercised by Mr. Campbell over the colonial
press. For the abuse of that power Mr. Campbell has suffered. The
pecuniary satisfaction that he was condemned to make, and the
costs for which he became responsible in the civil action, as
well as in the criminal information, appears by the account of
Mr. Garling to amount to the sum of 4,176<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>It is deeply to be regretted, that a person who had for so
long a period maintained a high character for integrity and
honour, and had justified the confidence with which Governor
Macquarrie had always treated him, should so unfortunately have
given way to his feelings towards Mr. Marsden, as to have exposed
him, as well as the respectable societies with which he was
connected, to the degrading suspicions that were attempted to be
fixed upon them in the letter of Philo Free.</p>
<p>Great as this abuse was, of the power exercised by Mr.
Campbell over the colonial press, it was deeply aggravated by his
having misled Governor Macquarrie respecting the nature of the
circumstances under which the letter had appeared, and by
inducing him to proclaim to the public his belief that the
insertion of the letter was an act of inadvertence, when Mr.
Campbell must have felt conscious that it was one of direct and
deliberate hostility.</p>
<p>I do not believe that Mr. Campbell was consulted respecting
the terms of Governor Macquarrie's disavowal of the libel, but he
must have seen it before it was published in the Gazette; and
although it was not incumbent upon him to afford a more full
explanation than that which he gave in his letter to Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde, yet he was bound in candour to Governor
Macquarrie to have warned him of the possible consequences of
such a declaration, when he was on the point of giving a public
testimony of his belief in the truth of it.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsden has considered that it was the duty of Governor
Macquarrie to have accompanied the termination of this affair
with the immediate dismissal of Mr. Campbell from office.</p>
<p>Having stated the circumstances that have been proved against
Mr. Campbell; I do not think it incumbent upon me to enter into
the reasons that might have restrained Governor Macquarrie from
manifesting such a mark of his disapprobation; but I think it
only due to both to state, that with the exception of the
circumstances just detailed, I never heard of any act of Mr.
Campbell that did not justify the favourable opinion with which
Governor Macquarrie had always regarded him; and that it would
have been difficult to have found a public officer in the colony
of New South Wales Upon whose zeal and ability, and upon the
strength of whose personal attachment, he could have so uniformly
relied as upon that of Mr. Campbell.</p>
<p>Of other trials that have taken place in the Criminal Court,
there are three from which the popular objections to its present
structure may be inferred. That which occurred in the month of
July 1813, for the murder of William Holmes in the town of
Sydney, by two officers of the regiment then quartered there, is
certainly open to that inference. The court before whom the
officers were tried was composed of the officers of the same
regiment, and Mr. Ellis Bent presided as judge advocate.</p>
<p>The evidence taken on the trial is very fully stated in a
report that was furnished to the Gazette by Mr. Ellis Bent,
followed by a recapitulation; and a perspicuous statement of the
principles of law that applied to the case, and which Mr. Ellis
Bent (departing from his ordinary practice) delivered to the
members in the presence of a crowded court, before they retired
to deliberate on their verdict. The act of violence to the person
of the demised was clearly proved to have been committed by the
parties accused; but the medical gentlemen who were examined,
declared, that after a minute examination of the body shortly
after death, no external marks of violence to which they could
attribute that event were visible; and it was stated by one of
them, that the appearances they observed might have been caused
by an Anion of blood in the lungs, in consequence of sudden and
violent passion.</p>
<p>These opinions must have had a strong influence on the minds
of the court, and must have appeared to them to justify an
acquittal of the charge of murder; for all the other
circumstances were clearly proved, and pressed very strongly
against the parties accused. They were found guilty of
manslaughter, and punished with six months imprisonment.</p>
<p>A similar feeling may be said to have prevailed in a trial in
the Criminal Court, that was furnished by Mr. Judge Advocate
Wylde, in which it appears that a prosecution was maintained by a
convict holding a ticket of leave, against an officer of the
garrison, for a violent assault, in consequence of the convict
having written an insulting letter to the officer, and containing
some reflections upon the whole corps. The circumstances of this
trial are given at length in the report of the judge advocate,
and are again mentioned in his evidence. He represents the case
to have been a trying one for the feelings of the court, and that
they felt a reluctance in coming to a decision upon the guilt of
the accused party; it certainly appears that the sum in which he
was fined was not commensurate with the aggravated nature of the
assault.</p>
<p>Another case was mentioned to me as an instance in which the
operation of the particular feelings of the members of the
Criminal Court, was manifested in the amount of a fine imposed by
them for an assault.</p>
<p>The prosecutor was the son alone of the magistrates of Sydney,
and the defendant a very young man, and the son of a person who
had formerly been a convict. It appears that in consequence of a
reference to that circumstance by the prosecutor, expressed in
very coarse and unmeasured terms, and in the public street, to
the defendant and his companion, whose origin was similar to his
own, the defendant took an opportunity of revenging that affront
on a subsequent day, by assaulting the prosecutor with a
horse-whip. The assault was proved, and the defendant was fined
in the sum of 100<i>l</i>. and ordered to enter into
recognizances to keep the peace, himself in 200<i>l</i>. and two
sureties in 100<i>l</i>. each. The fine of 100<i>l</i>. was at
the suggestion of the judge advocate reduced by Governor
Macquarrie to 50<i>l</i>. but even at that amount it appears to
have been excessive, and has been generally attributed to the
operation of a certain degree of prejudice that the members of
the court had imbibed against the convict classes as well as
against their descendants.</p>
<p>Another inconvenience arising from the present structure of
the Criminal Court, and the existence or suspicion of a certain
degree of interest in the event of the prosecution, is stated in
the petition of the inhabitants already alluded to. It is alleged
that there is no right of challenge to any of the members
appointed by the governor to act in the Criminal Court; and on
one occasion it appears that an officer who was chief engineer,
and who had detected and given information against a master
sailmaker of the dock-yard in the embezzlement of stores and
canvas, was a member of the Criminal Court, before whom the man
was tried. The officer, with a due impression of the
incompatibility of the situations in which he was likely to be
placed, of prosecutor, witness and judge, had applied to the
judge advocate to be excused from attendance as member of the
court; but upon being informed by the judge advocate that there
would be no objection to receive his evidence in that capacity,
the officer consented to remain a member, and gave his evidence
at the trial. It is hardly necessary to observe, that this
inconvenience might very easily have been avoided by an
application to Governor Macquarrie to issue a new precept, and to
insert the name of another officer.</p>
<p>Although I am not aware of any other instances that have
occurred in the criminal proceedings of the colony within the
last ten years than those that I have just mentioned that might
justify the objections of the inhabitants to the present
structure and character of the Criminal Court, and that there
existed a general disposition amongst them to do justice to the
honourable and impartial feelings that had generally appeared to
regulate their proceedings, yet I certainly found amongst all
ranks a desire to see the trial by jury introduced both in civil
and criminal proceedings, whenever the increase of population
should be found to have justified the measure, and whenever the
feelings of animosity that now separate certain classes of the
inhabitants from each other should be found to have subsided.</p>
<p>The principal and most popular objection to the present system
of criminal judicature, is the combination of so many different
functions in the office and person of the judge advocate, and the
influence which the performance of those duties must necessarily
have upon a mind, however well prepared or well disposed to
resist it.</p>
<p>This objection, I conceive, it will be an easy matter to
remove by the appointment of an English barrister to the office
of attorney general, whose duty it should be to receive all
depositions from the magistrates, to prepare indictments, and to
conduct prosecutions; and I need hardly add, that the judge who
may have to preside in the Criminal Court will think it right to
abstain, as Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde has latterly done, from all
preliminary cognizance or investigation of criminal cases, and to
leave that ditty, as in England it is left, to the discretion and
activity of the magistrates.</p>
<p>The military character and composition of the Criminal Court
of New South Wales are objected to by the inhabitants in their
petition; and I find that upon this subject they have adopted the
language and sentiments of the late Mr. Ellis Bent, who, in
addressing the Earl of Liverpool upon the civil and criminal
judicature of the colony, as they existed in the year 1813,
rested his objections upon the analogy that was observed in the
constitution of the Criminal Court to that of a court martial,
and upon the military aspect and character in which its
proceedings were viewed by most of the inhabitants. Mr. Bent
further states, that the Criminal Court did not command that
veneration, awe and respect that ought to attend upon a court of
justice; and that the numerous, free, respectable and affluent
inhabitants were rendered amenable to a jurisdiction originally
intended for the summary investigation of the crimes of convicts
alone. While I admit that several of the members of the Criminal
Court, who in their turn of service are called to sit in judgment
upon very important cases, are frequently too young for that
duty, and that to the feelings of all it is one that is now
become very repugnant and always unpleasant, yet, I certainly
consider that the character, qualifications and sentiments of the
higher ranks of officers who have served upon these courts, are
both superior to those of the best selected juries in England,
and greatly so to those who might be selected for such a duty in
New South Wales.</p>
<p>The officers composing the late and present garrisons of
Sydney, are brought much lea into contact with the inhabitants
than formerly; they associate with them less, and are further
removed from those local disputes and jealousies to which all
small societies are liable, and from the influence of which the
colony of New South Wales is less exempt than almost any other of
the remote dependencies of the empire. I do not conceive
therefore that the deliberations of military men, appointed by
rotation of service, and without favour or interest towards the
parties, guided by professional knowledge and experience, and in
most cases considering themselves bound by its direction, can be
entitled to less respect than if they were committed to the
judgments of those from whom juries in New South Wales, if
suffered to exist upon the principle that regulated their service
in England, must necessarily be selected.</p>
<p>Your Lordship will have perceived by the reference to the
cases that I have thought it necessary to make, that the process
of the Criminal Court of New South Wales is by no means a summary
one. The form of indictment, the advantage to the prisoner of
technical errors in it, even the right of traversing upon
misdemeanors, and motions in arrest of judgment, are all par
meal, and perhaps with more strictness than the circumstances of
the several cases may have justified. The influence of the judge
advocate in the decision of points of law in criminal cases,
forms a portion only of the power that is exercised by every
British judge in other colonies and the degree in which it is
possessed and exercised by the judge advocate in New South Wales,
has depended upon the estimation in which his opinions have been
held by the members of the court. It would be desirable that the
authority of determining upon points of law should be altogether
confined to him, and that discussions or deliberations upon it by
the members should be avoided. The duty that would thus remain
with them, would be that of deliberating and determining upon
points of fact, after a recapitulation of them shall have been
made by the judge advocate, in the presence of the prisoner, for
the purpose of giving him an opportunity of correction; and after
a distinct exposition of the law, as applying to the facts, shall
have been made in the presence of the public.</p>
<p>Having thus far considered the objections that have been made,
both under the authority of Mr. Ellis Bent as well as the
petitioners of New South Wales, to the present structure of and
form of proceedings in the Criminal Court, I will beg leave to
call your Lordship's attention to other defects that are
considered by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde to be inherent in it, and
which are stated at very great length in answer to an inquiry
that I addressed to him in the month of November 1820, both upon
the present defects of the charter of justice, and the several
provisions by which he was of opinion that those defects were
susceptible of remedy. The judge advocate first mentions the
power that is possessed by the governor of New South Wales of
determining the periods at which the Criminal Court shall sit,
and that of naming the members in that court and the Civil
Court&mdash;the inconvenience occasioned to the officers of the
garrison, and sometimes the interruption of the military duties,
by their attendance on the Criminal Courts&mdash;the small number
of concurrent voices required to give a capital
sentence&mdash;the absence of any right of challenge&mdash;and
the subjection of the exercise of that right to the will of the
governor.</p>
<p>I should not do justice to the sentiments with which the judge
advocate has always viewed the combination in his own person, of
the great power of initiating or declining prosecutions, if I had
not request your Lordship's attention to that part of his
observations in which he describes their inconvenience, and
suggests their repeal.</p>
<p>The judge advocate is of opinion that the absence of local
feelings and information in the officers who compose the Criminal
Court may not be without its inconvenience, as they are less
sensible than they might justly be to the peculiar dangers to
which the property of the inhabitants of New South Wales is
exposed, and less acquainted with the character of the witnesses
and the impressions under which they are in the habit of giving
their evidence. He, however, does justice to the compassionate
feelings as well as the honourable and conscientious motives that
have appeared to influence the members of the Criminal Court in
the discharge of their duties.</p>
<p>In addressing himself to that part of my inquiry that pointed
to the possible improvement of the Criminal Court in its present
form, the judge advocate is of opinion that the judicial
establishment of New South Wales should consist of three judges,
one of whom should always preside in the Criminal Court; that all
questions of law should be decided by the court; and that
questions of fact should be decided by certain respectable
inhabitants of the colony, not less than eight in number, to be
appointed from time to time by the governor.</p>
<p>He suggests a further provision for the transfer of his
present duties of prosecutor to the office of attorney general,
and with a reference to one of the judges in case that officer
should decline the prosecution of any criminal matter submitted
to him.</p>
<p>In answer to the inquiry made by me, whether in his opinion
the distinctions between the convicted and unconvicted portions
of the community in the colony are sufficiently done away to
admit of the impartial consideration of a jury composed of both
classes, of the case of an individual belonging to the one or the
other, the judge advocate states it as his opinion, that in the
effective administration of criminal justice convict jurors
cannot, as a body, make a separate cause from the free. He thinks
that no measure would tend so gradually to reduce that spirit of
division that at present so much exists between the classes, and
to a greater degree amongst the convicted, while the certain and
growing excess of free jurors would, in the judge advocate's
opinion, and to use his own terms, "keep the convict class almost
from sight, and prevent the influence of their particular
feelings upon the verdicts of the courts." He is further of
opinion, that as the convicts have always been admitted as
witnesses in the colonial courts without objection, and as they
appear to him to be employed in the most serious, intimate, and
confidential concerns of the free inhabitants, he sees no reason
why they should not be admitted to act as jurors.</p>
<p>Your Lordship will find, on making reference to the Appendix
to the Report of the Parliamentary Committee of 1812, on the
subject of transportation, that many authorities, amongst whom
was the very respectable one of Mr. Ellis Bent, concurred in
stating that there existed at that time in the colony of New
South Wales, and as far back as the year 1811, a sufficient
number of respectable persons amongst the free and the convicted
chimes from whom a competent number of jurors might be taken; and
it was upon these authorities that the introduction of the system
of jury trial was submitted by the Committee to the consideration
of his Majesty's government.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of New South Wales, who joined in the petition
that was transmitted to your Lordship in the year 1819, have
repeated the expressions of anxiety with which they have always
been said to record this great alteration in the judicial system.
In the Appendix is to be found the names of the persons who
supported the petition. They are numerous, and may be said to
comprise the most respectable and the most opulent of the
inhabitants of the colony, including as well the free as the
higher ranks of the convict classes. Upon inquiry amongst the
former I found that there were many who, although favourable to
several measures stated in it as advantageous to the interests of
the colony, declared that they did not join in the wish that had
been expressed for the trial by jury. Several of them, amongst
whom I may state one that was most active in promoting a meeting
in one of the populous districts of the colony, declared to me
that although he was desirous of seeing the trial by jury
established, "he did not think that the colony was yet ripe for
such a system".</p>
<p>At the meeting that took place at Sydney for the consideration
of the objects of the petition, I was informed by Sir John
Jamieson, who acted as chairman, that he had distinctly declared,
that in petitioning for trial by jury he never meant or wished
that it should be granted upon any other principles than those
upon which it exists in England; and Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde has
adopted the same Principle in his answer to my inquiries upon the
defects of the charter of justice.</p>
<p>Without any precise information as to the nature and operation
of that principle, it was generally understood at the meeting,
when the subject was discussed, that in addition to the
qualifications required in England as to property, no convicted
persons were deemed admissible to the dice of juror in New South
Wales, whose term of service had not expired, or that had not
been absolutely or conditionally remitted by the governor.
Supposing therefore that this principle was adopted, there would
arise precisely the same necessity of reference to the dates as
well us to the nature of their original convictions, as existed
on the question of their right of personal action, for the
purpose of determining by the best evidence that the several
cases admitted, the precise periods at which the disabilities of
conviction for felony or misdemeanor had ceased, or the precise
nature of the crimes by which those disabilities had been first
created; and unless some secondary means of proof in the one case
should be admitted, or the removal of the disabilities of
conviction should be made complete, on receiving the governor's
remission of sentence in the other, the introduction and
operation of the principle of the English law, in the formation
of juries in New South Wales, and by the admission of persons who
had been convicts to discharge that function, would lead to
anomalies and exceptions which, however allowable in Great
Britain, could not, I think, be justly admitted there.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to refer to the numerous authorities by
which it is established, that a conviction for felony, or a
conviction for such misdemeanors as render a man infamous, make
him incompetent to discharge the office of juror. It has,
however, been doubted by a very learned person in treating upon
the effect of pardon, whether it has the power of restoring the
capacity of juror that had been lost by conviction. The older
authorities upon this subject are contradictory; some of them
maintaining, that although the King's pardon may remove from a
convicted person the crime as well as punishment, yet that it
does not imply any moral restoration; while others maintain that
a pardon under the great seal makes a man a new creature, and
removes his incapacity for all purposes whatsoever. Such,
probably, would be the determination now upon the effect of the
pardon, produced by a service of the term of transportation, upon
offences that come within the Act of 4 Geo. I. c. 11, and by a
pardon under the great seal.</p>
<p>If, however, the observations that I have before addressed to
your Lordship upon the incapacities of convicted persons to sue
are correct, those in New South Wales who have been convicted of
petty larceny, and have served their terms, and all those whose
terms have been remitted either by His Majesty under pardons of
lower degree than that of the great seal, or by the several
governors of the colony under any pardons whatever, as well as
alt those persons transported for offences not within the terms
of the 4 Geo. I. c. 11, are by law incapacitated from serving on
juries.</p>
<p>Taking, therefore, the terms upon which the inhabitants of New
South Wales were understood to consent to the admission of
convicted persons to the office of jurors in that colony, your
Lordship will see that they would exclude some of those classes
that, perhaps, of all others, are the most worthy to be admitted;
and that they would include many, whose pretensions and
qualifications, as arising from conduct in the colony, are the
most suspicious and least to be favoured.</p>
<p>Such I conceive to be the state of the law, and its
diversified operation in the removal of the incapacity to serve
the office of juror. It has led to incongruities that, perhaps,
were not contemplated, as they were not likely to occur or to be
felt in England, where the incapacities of conviction rarely
affect those classes of the population from which jurors are
selected, and where, from the multitude of unconvicted persons,
they are lost or unobserved and it is only since the class of
convicted and remitted persons in New South Wales became so
numerous and their pretensions to the rights and privileges of
free persons have been so much encouraged, that the question has
been brought into discussion at all.</p>
<p>The language of the certificates, however, that are given by
the governor's secretary to convicts, whose terms of service are
found (on reference to the indentures of assignment) to have
expired, must have greatly contributed to induce a belief, that
the parties holding them "were restored (according to the terms
of the certificate) to all the rights and privileges of free
subjects", and have confirmed them in a belief, that in those
rights algid capacities that of serving the office of juror was
included.</p>
<p>After this statement of the inconvenience as well as injustice
that would arise from a strict application of the law of England
to the colony of New South Wales, in the removal of this or other
disabilities of conviction, it is important to consider upon more
general grounds the expediency of admitting persons who have been
convicted, and whose terms of service have expired, or have been
remitted by the governor of the colony, to the important office
of deliberating and determining upon the lives and properties of
their fellow subjects; and still further to consider the
expediency of attempting to unite them in this duty with persons
whose legal competence to discharge it has never been questioned,
and who for that reason as well as for others that have been
explained in my former Report, feel a greater or less degree of
repugnance to any association with them.</p>
<p>The consideration of this question will much depend upon the
relative numbers of the two classes; the gradual extinction of
the sense of moral superiority that naturally exists in the minds
and feelings of persons who have respected the law, over those
who have violated it; and lastly, upon the dangerous sympathy and
compassion that must long remain in the breasts of convicted
persons for the same crimes for which themselves have suffered,
and the equally dangerous aversion and prejudice that may exist
in the minds of the unconvicted, when sitting in judgment upon
the crimes of a class of persons so greatly below them. With a
view to ascertain the numerical competence of the free and
unconvicted inhabitants of New South Wales to undertake the
duties of jurors, in case the adoption of that mode of trial
should be deemed expedient, I requested the magistrates of the
several districts to make returns of the several inhabitants,
distinguishing those that had come free to the colony, those that
had been born in it, and who were above the age of twenty-one,
and resided upon property of their own; and for the sake of
convenience, I requested them to add a return of the persons in
their respective districts, who had formerly been convicts,
stating whether they were married or single, and resident upon
property of their own, and adding general remarks upon the
respectability of their characters and conduct. The returns were
not sent to me exactly at the same period; but I find that
between the 21st January and the 10th June of the year 1820,
there were in the several districts of New South Wales, two
hundred and forty-two persons who had come free to the colony,
exclusive of females, and eighty-seven who had been born in it
above the age of twenty-one, resident upon property of their own,
and who in other respects might be fairly considered as competent
to discharge the office of jurors.</p>
<p>I observe a considerable difference in the return that was
made of the number of those born in the colony and in the
districts of the Hawkesbury, that was transmitted by the same
magistrates in the year 1819 to Sir John Jamieson, who was
chairman of the meeting of the inhabitants, already adverted to.
In that return, I find that class of persons in those districts
amounted to seventy-five, nearly the whole of them are stated to
be freeholders; and in the return dated on the 15th May 1820, I
find the number reduced to forty-five. I have reason to believe
that this last return was made with greater particularity than
the former, as every opportunity was given, and every desire
expressed on my part to the magistrates, to make it as correct as
possible.</p>
<p>Respecting the number of persons that come free to the colony,
it must be observed that many of them live at a great distance
from the town of Sydney, and that their removal thither, and
separation from their estates and dwellings, would always be a
subject of apprehension as well as of objection. Many likewise
are too much elevated above the condition of the ordinary
description of offenders, that come before the Criminal Court, to
be selected as petty jurors; and a considerable portion of those
who are resident in the town of Sydney, and amounting to
fifty-one, consist of the officers of government.</p>
<p>The collective number of those born in the colony, and
resident upon their property, amounts to eighty-seven; and this
class, although quite equal and perhaps superior in natural
endowments to the youthful population of the same classes in
other countries, has had but few opportunities of education in
the earlier periods of the colony, and cannot be said to have had
the benefit of good example to counterbalance that deficiency. In
moral feelings, as well as in moral conduct, however, they are
not to be ranked as inferior to the el of persons in England,
from whom petty juries are generally selected, and I am far from
thinking that any dangerous sympathy for crime is to be
apprehended in them. The absence of this class of persons from
their estates during the several sittings of the Criminal Court,
which according to the present rate of proceeding last from ten
days to twenty, would be a source of incalculable injury and
expense to them.</p>
<p>There is yet a third class of persons described in the returns
of the magistrates as resident upon their properties in the
several districts, from whom, it is maintained by some, that
jurors may be selected as morally competent, without any
reference to their legal incapacity.</p>
<p>By the returns that have been furnished me, I find that the
number of male convicts in New South Wales, whose terms of
service have either expired or been remitted, and who are
resident on their own property, amounts to the hundred and
eighty-seven; and from the description that I have given of them
in my former Report, founded as it was upon the opinions of
others to whom I felt I could trust, assisted by my own
observation, your Lordship will not be led to conclude that they
form a class of persons from whom jurors, either for civil or
criminal purposes, could generally, or with propriety, be
selected. To the number returned in this as well as the other
classes, there no doubt may be made exceptions, in the propriety
of which many, perhaps most, of the free inhabitants would
concur; and, supposing that the number of these exceptions may be
fairly stated to amount to one hundred, there would thus remain a
body of four hundred and nine persons in New South Wales, more or
less, competent to discharge the office of jurors.</p>
<p>After making this statement, I need not observe how entirely I
dissent from the opinion that was expressed by the late Mr. Ellis
Bent, at the early period of 1812, respecting the practicability
of impannelling grand and petty juries in New South Wales for the
trial of offences. The only exception that he appears to have
recommended was that which very nearly exists at present, of
crimes of inferior description committed by convicts; these, as
your Lordship will have observed, being referred to the
cognizance of the magistrates.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie, in answer to your Lordship's inquiry,
made at a rather later period, gives it as his decided opinion
that convicts whose terms of service have expired or been
remitted, should take their turn of being jurymen in common with
persons who have never been convicts; and "that when once a
convict becomes a free man, he should, in all respects, be
considered on a footing with every other man according to his
rank in life and character; in short, that no retrospect should
in any case be had to his having been a convict."</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Field is of opinion, that at a more advanced
period, and after the introduction of a larger body of free
settlers, and of the maturity of those born in the colony,
persons who have been convicted, but whose terms have either been
remitted or have expired, should indiscriminately be admitted to
perform the functions of jurors, without reference to the nature
of their crimes.</p>
<p>Your Lordship has already seen that the incapacity of many to
serve as jurors is one of the various effects of the criminal law
as it now stands, and still further varied by the operation of
the law of pardon upon those convicts whose sentences have been
remitted by the governors of New South Wales.</p>
<p>By the alteration that I have taken the liberty to recommend
in my former Report, this as well as other disabilities would be
removed in the colony from remitted convicts, as long as they
remained in it, immediately on receiving the governor's pardon;
for I have proposed that such an instrument should have the local
effect of a pardon under the great seal; but as your Lordship has
seen, that, in the present state of the law, the capacity of
being a juror is not restored in many cases of inferior crimes,
by the service of the term of transportation, it will be
necessary to resort to some legislative declaration, by which
this as well as the other disabilities may be removed.</p>
<p>The only exception that I would propose to this enactment, is
that of the commission and conviction of felony by a convict
during his term of service in the colony, or after the remission
of that term by the governor. In such cases, as proof is given of
augmented and continued criminality, I should propose that the
effect of the colonial sentence upon it should create an
augmentation of punishment; and that all felonies committed by
convicts during their term of punishment, or by remitted convicts
after their remission, shall be held to deprive them of all
future personal right of action, and of serving as jurors, and
should also create a forfeiture of all lands granted to them by
the crown, or field by other title.</p>
<p>I am well aware that although the justice of this exception
may be acknowledged, it may be asserted that the mere service of
a term of transportation for seven years is an imperfect test of
moral competence for discharging the office of juror. It may
possibly constitute one amongst other reasons for abridging the
number of persons that may hereafter be transported for that term
to the colony of New South Wales; but considering that the length
of the term of service, in the absence of all other evidence, is
a presumptive proof of the degrees of guilt, it does not, upon
this principle, seem fair to exclude a class, in whose favour the
presumption arising from a transportation for the short twin of
seven years is always so strong.</p>
<p>As permanent residence upon land in the colony, and industry
in the cultivation of it, may be generally considered to be as
fair tests of civil and moral competence as any that can be
obtained in New South Wales, and as it forms a part of the
qualifications of jurors in England, it would be expedient that,
with the exceptions that have been already made, their
eligibility to the office in New South Wales should be founded
upon the quantity of land that they hold, or that has been
granted to them, and in the last case upon the proportion of land
that is cleared and cultivated. By the present regulations a
certain proportion is required to be cleared as a condition of
tenure, and the adherence to that rule should constitute one
ground of eligibility to the office of juror. I should propose,
as a further qualification to the same class of persons, the free
and unencumbered possession of not less than fifty acres of land
granted, or of a house of the value of 100<i>l</i>. Viewing it as
a prospective measure, it will give time to persons who have
undergone transportation for short terms to acquire those
feelings that are invariably generated by the possession of
property, and that serve to form the strong and perhaps the only
link that connects the interests of the convicted classes with
those of the unconvicted.</p>
<p>It has been observed, that amongst the remitted convicts that
are of longer standing in the colony, that there is no want of
disposition to join in measures for the common defence and
security of property; and it has frequently been urged, and is
stated in the report of Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, that the same
feeling that would unite these persons and the free classes in
common measures of defence, against the violence of the convicts,
would make them equally ready to join in verdicts for their
condemnation. In the trial of convicts for capital offences, I
think that the description of persons now mentioned would not
manifest any improper degree of reluctance to condemn; on the
other hand, it is by no means clear that those cases would
receive such impartial and unimpassioned consideration from a
jury composed of the free classes and of the older remitted
convicts, as they do now under the present constitution of the
Criminal Court. It is not, however, for these cases alone that
the composition of the juries in New South Wales is to be
calculated. With the increase of the population there will be an
increase in the crimes of all the classes that compose it, and
then will arise the most severe trials for the impartiality of
the juries; and full scope will be given for the operations of
those feelings that have lately exasperated the two classes, from
which, as being the most numerous and opulent, juries would most
naturally be selected.</p>
<p>Until these feelings shall have subsided, I should think it
equally inexpedient and dangerous to submit the property or the
life of a free person in New South Wales to the verdict and
judgment of a jury of remitted convicts, as I should that of a
remitted convict to a jury of free persons.</p>
<p>Attributing the existence of these feelings to other causes
than those assigned by Mr. Justice Field, I cannot help agreeing,
with him in the conclusion that he has made in his very able
statement on this subject, in answer to my inquiry on the defects
as well as the improvements of the charter of justice: "That so
long as these feelings are nourished and inflamed, a convict jury
will lean against a yet unattainted prisoner; and a free jury
will revenge the purity of their order upon an already attainted
one."</p>
<p>Upon the whole, I am of opinion that the period is not yet
arrived at which the system of trial by jury can be safely or
advantageously introduced into the civil and criminal proceedings
of the colony. The best in of advancing that period will be found
in the encouragement and improvement of the institutions for the
education of the rising generation, in affording the means of
their early separation from the vicious habits mid bad example of
their parents, and from giving the most liberal and marked
encouragement to their enterprizes and industry.</p>
<p>The union of this class with the free settlers that from time
to time may emigrate from England, will be, more easily
accomplished than that of free settlers with remitted convicts,
or with those whose sentences have expired.</p>
<p>A certain degree of jealousy is found to exist amongst the
immediate descendants of convicts and the free settlers; but I
never observed, in more than one instance, a repugnance on the
part of free persons to associate with them on terms of perfect
equality; nor did I observe the existence of those rooted
principles of disunion that have been so strongly exhibited, when
attempts have been made to combine the other materials of the
social edifice in New South Wales, in any public or in any useful
institution.</p>
<p>The encouragement that may hereafter be given to free persons
of respectable character to emigrate from Great Britain to New
South Wales, will probably have a greater influence than any
measure that can be adopted within the colony, in softening the
asperity of feeling that now prevails there between the free and
convict classes. Whatever repugnance the newly-arrived colonists
may feel to an assimilation with the latter, they will not
partake of the local prejudice and aversion that exists amongst
the older inhabitants. With an increase in the numbers and
respectability of the free and unconvicted inhabitants, the
benefits of influence and example will be more strongly impressed
upon the minds of the convicted classes, and feelings of aversion
will give way to those of conciliation and mutual respect.</p>
<p>Having stated the several objections that have been alleged by
the inhabitants of the colony to the present structure of their
judicial establishments, and made reference to the cases or
occurrences upon which it appeared to me that those objections
were grounded, and having now submitted to your Lordship the
reasons for withholding for the present that change in the system
that the inhabitants of the colony have so earnestly prayed for,
aim which, if it were safe or expedient, it is agreed on all
hands it would be most desirable to concede to them, I shall
proceed to submit to your Lordship a statement of the judicial
establishment in Van Diemen's Land, and the circumstances that
appear to require an early alteration and improvement in it.
Previous to the date of the charter of justice granted by his
late Majesty in the month of February 1814, and until the arrival
of Mr. Deputy Judge Advocate Abbott in Van Diemen's Land in the
month of February 1815, there had existed no authority for the
trial or determination of civil causes in that settlement.
Criminal Courts, composed of the judge advocate of New South
Wales and six officers of His Majesty's forces by sea or land,
might have been held in Van Diemen's Land under the commission
dated the 2d April 1787, and under the same authority that had
enabled Mr. Judge Advocate Bent to try at Sydney offences that
were committed in Van Diemen's Land, and that enabled Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde to proceed to hold a Criminal Court there in the
month of January 1821. It does not appear, however, that it was
ever deemed necessary or practicable to resort to such a
measure.</p>
<p>Mr. S. Bate, who had been appointed deputy judge advocate at
Port Philip, a settlement that was intended to have been made on
the southern coast of New South Wales, arrived in Van Diemen's
Land in 1806, and accompanied the expedition that had been
destined to Port Philip. Mr. Bates's commission of deputy judge
advocate was strictly local; and Colonel Collins, who commanded
the expedition and afterwards formed the settlement of Hobart
Town, considered that there existed no power under which Mr. Bate
could have held a Civil or Criminal Court in that place, and that
some parliamentary authority was necessary to give these
jurisdictions to Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>The Lieutenant-Governor's Court, for the trial of civil causes
not exceeding in amount the sum of 50<i>l</i>., was not opened by
Mr. Deputy Judge Advocate Abbott in Van Diemen's Land until the
month of January 1816. The delay that took place in the long
interval that elapsed between his arrival at Hobart Town in
February 1815, is not very satisfactorily accounted for by the
reasons assigned by Mr. Abbott; and the advantages to be derived
from the presence of some person capable of giving advice to the
lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen's Land, and of affording an
opportunity to the inhabitants of recovering their debts by
judicial process, were suspended without any apparent necessity.
The want of a local court prior to 1814, and the suspension of
action in the Supreme Court previous to the arrival of Mr.
Justice Field, has led to an accumulation of debt and
embarrassment in Van Diemen's Land that will be long and sensibly
felt, and must eventually lead to a change of property whenever a
court of larger jurisdiction shall be established.</p>
<p>In every year that has elapsed since the opening of the court
in 1816, and until the end of the year 1819, four terms or
sittings of the Lieutenant-Governor's Court have been held; and
during this period it appears that one thousand five hundred and
sixty causes have been entered, and out or these four hundred and
seventy-seven have been withdrawn, and one thousand and
eighty-three have been tried, in which verdicts have been
obtained, amounting altogether to the sum of 18,848<i>l</i>. The
number of causes that were entered in 1816 amounted to three
hundred and nine, and in 1819 to four hundred and ninety-seven.
The verdicts amounting in the first of these years to
2,580<i>l</i>., and in the last to 7,089<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>Out of the number of causes that have been tried at Hobart
Town, there appear to have been forty-four in which both the
plaintiffs and defendants were resident at Launceston or in the
districts immediately contiguous to it; and there were also one
hundred in which the defendants were resident there.</p>
<p>The inconvenience occasioned to suitors by the necessity of
repairing from Launceston to Hobart Town with their witnesses
began to be much felt in the year 1820; and it does not appear
from the reasons stated by Mr. Deputy Judge Advocate Abbott, that
there were any other than those of a personal nature that
prevented the removal of that inconvenience by an occasional
transfer of the sitting of the court to Launceston.</p>
<p>The journey from Hobart Town to that place may be accomplished
in three days, but it is attended with expense, as well as some
personal inconvenience, to those who are unable to bear the
fatigue of travelling on horseback.</p>
<p>The Lieutenant-Governor's Court is composed of the deputy
judge advocate, and two inhabitants appointed by the
lieutenant-governor.</p>
<p>A return of the persons that have been so appointed is
contained in the Appendix, and they appear to have been selected
from the principal merchants and dealers of Hobart Town, with the
exception of the first year, when Mr. Gordon and Mr. Humphrey,
the magistrates, appear to have served during every term. Upon
the propriety of these appointments, it has been the custom of
Lieutenant-Governor Sorell to consult the deputy judge advocate;
but upon one occasion, during a temporary suspension of their
intercourse, it appears an appointment was made by Lieutenant
Governor Sorell, which although the deputy judge advocate does
not think he should have objected to, if it had been made known
to him, yet I certainly think it would have been very desirable
to have avoided. The person named to act as member of the court
was a considerable merchant in Hobart Town, and had never till
this occasion been appointed a member. It was, however, well
known that he was at open variance with an individual who was
defendant in an action that was to be tried before him, and who
had made himself very obnoxious on many occasions to the
lieutenant-governor.</p>
<p>In a place wherein the opportunities of selection were very
limited, it cannot be expected that the inconvenience arising
from the personal interest of one or other of the members can
always be avoided. When they have occurred, the member of the
court who was interested in the cause has retired; but the deputy
judge advocate has stated that the influence of local feelings
upon the proceedings of the court has been frequently
perceptible; and that as soon as the appointment of the members
has been made known in the Gazette, preliminary discussions have
taken place between them, accompanied by anticipations of the
merits of causes, that be has found to interfere with the
impartiality of the decisions.</p>
<p>The proceedings of the Lieutenant-Governor's Court are
regulated by rules and miens that were drawn up by the deputy
judge advocate, and that are to be found in the Appendix.</p>
<p>The office of the court is open at all times for filing
complaints and inning process. On application to the clerk of the
judge advocate, a very slight and technical description is given
to the nature of the complaint. If an appearance has been entered
by the defendant, and upon return of the summons and writ, the
cause is heard in its turn at the next sittings; and in case of
the defendant's default, it is heard <i>ex parte</i>. Every
person is allowed to appear and conduct his own cause, either as
plaintiff or defendant; but it has been usual for parties who
were unwilling or unable to undertake this duty for themselves to
employ agents.</p>
<p>These persons have in all cases consisted of the higher clams
of remittal convicts, who had acquired any knowledge of business;
and Mr. Deputy Judge Advocate Abbott has allowed them to appear
merely in virtue of the authority given to them by their
employers, and of the partial advantages arising both to the
court and to the suitors from their experience.</p>
<p>The deputy judge advocate bears testimony to the conduct of
one of these persons, and it was also confirmed from other
quarters; but the character that was thus given was much
impaired, by an attempt that was made by the same individual, in
conjunction with a convict attorney, during my residence at
Hobart Town to possess themselves under very suspicious
circumstances of the property Of a remitted convict who died
suddenly, and upon whom they pretended to have large claims.</p>
<p>As late as the month of November 1821, no free professional
person bad arrived at Hobart Town to practise; and I have been
informed, that at a much later period the business has been
chiefly conducted by remitted convicts.</p>
<p>The practice and procedure of the Lieutenant-Governor's Court
has been conducted in a more summary and less complicated manner
than in the other tribunals of New South Wales. Technical forms
have been discouraged by the deputy judge advocate, and as the
subjects of dispute have been hitherto of a very simple nature,
they have not received or required the application of much
professional learning.</p>
<p>As the trade and commercial dealings of Van Diemen's Land have
made and were making a very rapid progress, the limited
jurisdiction of the Civil Court began to be seriously felt. It
was partially obviated by the inhabitants, by a system that they
had adopted of breaking the amount of their debts, and taking
several securities and obligations to the amount of 50<i>l</i>.;
for the recovery of which they were under the necessity of
bringing separate actions, though arising from one and the same
came. For actions of a larger amount they had recourse to the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, whose first sittings at Hobart
Town were opened by Mr. Justice Field in January 1819, and
renewed on the circuit that he commenced in the year 1821, about
the period of my departure from the colony.</p>
<p>The scale of fees in the Lieutenant-Governor's Court in Van
Diemen's Land, seems to be more justly proportioned to the amount
of the subject in dispute than in the other courts of New South
Wales. No fees are taken by the deputy judge advocate in causes
under 5<i>l</i>. I observe, however, that in addition to the fee
of 5<i>s</i>. charged for entering each cause above 5<i>l</i>.
and under 10<i>l</i>., as well as in other causes, a fee of
5<i>s</i>. is paid to the deputy judge advocate's clerk for
drawing up a form of the plaint, and taking instructions
respecting the nature of it. The amount of fees charged in causes
above 5<i>l</i>. and under 10<i>l</i>. is high. In an action
brought by Messrs. Kemp and Gatehouse for the sum of 12<i>l</i>.
and in which they recovered 7<i>l</i>. 15<i>s</i>. the costs of
the court only, and exclusive of those paid to the provost
marshal, amounted to 2<i>l</i>. 7<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>In the table of fees of the provost marshal of Van Diemen's
Land, I observe that there is a charge for executing every writ
above 51. and not exceeding 10<i>l</i>. amounting to 10<i>s</i>.,
and a charge of 14<i>s</i>. for all writs above that amount. This
charge is high for writs executed in Hobart Town, but no
proportionate allowance seems to be made for those that are
executed at a greater distance.</p>
<p>By the return made from the office of the deputy judge
advocate, it appears that the aggregate amount of fees received
by him in four years, commencing the 1st January 1816 and ending
the 31st December 1819, has been 1,791<i>l</i>. 7<i>s</i>.
4<i>d</i>.; and from the increase in the number and amount of
causes that might be expected to take place in 1820, his fees in
all probability amount to 600<i>l</i>., a sum equal to that of
his salary. In this amount the fees received by the deputy judge
advocate on detainer and upon the registration of deeds in his
office are not included; they are very inconsiderable, and will
be noticed when I come to consider the custom under which they
have been taken.</p>
<p>The office of provost marshal in Van Diemen's Land was held
provisionally by Mr. John Beamont, on the suspension of Mr.
Martin Timms, who held it under a commission from his late
Majesty. In 1820, the provisional appointment of Mr. Beamont was
confirmed; and the duties of the office are now executed by hint
in person, having previously been confided to Mr. Broadribb, an
attorney under sentence of transportation, who acted as Mr.
Beamont's deputy, and who, frequently employed convicts to
execute the more laborious parts of the duty. These convicts were
assigned to him and victualled by the crown, and afterwards
received tickets of leave.</p>
<p>On account of the expense of sending these persons to
Launceston, and the inconvenience that it would have occasioned
to Mr. Beamont, (who then filled the office of naval officer), a
bailiff was allowed to assist hint at Launceston. This person was
also victualled from the King's store; the subsistence of these
persons operating, <i>pro tanto</i>, as a diminution of the
expenses of the provost marshal.</p>
<p>These expenses are stated both by Mr. Beamont and Mr.
Broadribb to be very considerable, as the distance of the estates
of the settlers front each other and from Hobart Town, made it
always necessary to incur the expense of horse-hire. Mr. Beamont
states that he has found much difficulty in obtaining the
services of free people to do the duty of provost marshal, which
as long as he held the naval office he was under the necessity of
confiding to another. It appears that Mr. Broadribb receives half
the fees of the provost marshal's office; but as Mr. Beamont upon
being relieved from the naval office would be able and began to
perform the duty himself, his profits may in future be expected
to improve.</p>
<p>Sales of property taken in execution do not frequently occur,
on account of the great sacrifices that they occasion to the
parties, and the difficulty of making payments in cash. The loss,
however, that is avoided by a public sale of the elects of the
debtors, is experienced in another shape, by the disadvantageous
terms at which their creditors receive their produce in payment.
These creditors generally consist of the dealers at Hobart Town,
who are all provided with stores and granaries for the reception
of wheat from the settlers, and can thus afford to wait until an
opportunity occurs of turning it into the government stores.</p>
<p>An instance of great oppression came under my personal
observation near Hobart Town, where by means of a collusive sale
of some grain, in which the deputy provost marshal had assisted,
a powerful creditor had obtained an exorbitant profit, and nearly
the whole of one year's crop of a poor settler was
sacrificed.</p>
<p>The first opportunity that occurred to the inhabitants of Van
Diemen's Land of having recourse to the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court, was afforded them by Mr. Justice Field, who, at
the end of the year 1818, repaired to Hobart Town. As the
solicitors of the court did not proceed at the same time, and
some delay took place on their arrival, many causes were not
sufficiently advanced to admit of their being tried, and others
were hastily prepared, and brought to trial with insufficient
instruction. Twelve causes, amongst which there were four of some
importance, were tried; five were withdrawn; and thirty-three
were commenced and afterwards postponed.</p>
<p>Nearly fifty causes were in preparation for trial at the end
of the year 1820; and during my visit to Van Diemen's Land, I had
frequent opportunities of observing the embarrassment in which
merchants and consignees of cargoes were placed, from want of
immediate recourse to a court of larger jurisdiction than that
which exists under the present charter.</p>
<p>The difficulties and delays that occur in issuing process
front the office of the supreme judge at Sydney, well as the
vexation that has been practised by influence of parties in the
execution of process when committed to the hands of the former
provost marshal of Van Diemen's Land, have considerably lessened
the advantage that the inhabitants would have otherwise derived
from their applications to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Field has stated in his report the difficulty that
he has felt in putting the law in force at such a distance; and
it is obvious that the long intervals that have taken place
between the circuits of his court, have added to that difficulty;
although I am not aware that it could have admitted of a
remedy.</p>
<p>The want of a separate criminal jurisdiction in Van Diemen's
Land has, however, been and is still more seriously felt than
that of a civil court. All offences, that were committed by
convicts, except that of murder, have been punished by a bench of
magistrates at monthly meetings held at Hobart Town; and the
punishments that they inflicted for heavy offences, consisted of
transportation to the Coal River for three and five years, with
condemnation to work there in chains; and flogging, to the amount
three hundred lashes.</p>
<p>The punishment of free people and the investigation of their
offences was referred to the Criminal Court at Sydney; and such
has been the reluctance of the settlers in Van Diemen's Land to
quit their property for the purpose of attending to prosecutions,
and the expense, trouble and delay, that have occurred in
bringing them to conclusion at Sydney, that compromises of the
worst crimes have taken place for the purpose of avoiding that
expense, as well as the certain ruin that would have followed
from the absence of the owner from his property. From the year
1815 to the end of the year 1819, twenty-five persons only have
been sent from Van Diemen's Land to Sydney for trial; of these,
seven were charged with murder, and the others were persons who
had been engaged in such extensive robberies, and of characters
so notorious, that a sense of the advantages of their conviction
counterbalanced the evils of the prolonged absence of the
prosecutors, and the ordinary reluctance to repair to Sydney. An
allowance is made there for the expenses both of prosecutors and
witnesses who are sent to attend the prosecutions; and passages
are found for the witnesses, both of the prosecutor and the
prisoner; but as conveyances are not often at command from Sydney
to Van Diemen's Land, the time consumed in waiting for them has
sometimes exceeded two months. The number of witnesses that have
been sent to Sydney to attend the Criminal Court, in the space of
five years, has amounted to seventy-seven; and the accounts of
their expenses and the allowances for them are checked by the
judge advocate, and when approved by him are ordered to be paid
from the police fund.</p>
<p>Under a very strong impression of the necessity of repressing
the extensive robberies of sheep that were frequent during my
residence in Van Diemen's Land, and having found that they were
generally perpetrated by the remitted convicts, under the hope of
impunity that was created by the difficulties and uncertainties
of prosecution, I ventured to recommend to Governor Macquarrie,
on my return from Van Diemen's Land, that Mr. Judge Advocate
Wylde should be requested to repair thither to hold a criminal
court, at the same time that Mr. Justice Field renewed the
circuit of the Supreme Court. Governor Macquarrie willingly
acceded to my recommendation; and after some delay, the judges
left Sydney on the 3d of January 1821, in a vessel purposely
hired for their accommodation.</p>
<p>Having received no further official information from Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde of the result of this measure than a return of the
number of prisoners that he found committed for trial on his
arrival at Hobart Town, I am not able to state to your Lordship
whether the good effects that I had anticipated have been
realized. On reference to the return of prisoners committed for
trial in February 1821, I find that out of one hundred and
sixteen persons, seventy-nine were convicts, and thirty-seven
were free either by servitude or remission of sentence.</p>
<p>On the 3d February sentence of death was passed on twenty-five
prisoners; and on the 28th April, ten out of this number were
executed, soon after the arrival of Governor Macquarrie at Hobart
Town.</p>
<p>Amongst the offences that stood for trial, there were
certainly several committed by convicts that might have been
referred to the cognizance of the magistrates; and there were
some grounds for believing that the number of offenders had been
designedly swelled, for the purpose of manifesting more clearly
the necessity of a local criminal jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The gaol at Hobart Town had been very much crowded with
prisoners previous to the arrival of the judges in Van Diemen's
Land; and on the day of their arrival four of the most desperate
offenders had effected their escape from it. The evils, however,
arising to the settlement from the unchecked commission of crime,
and from the extensive schemes of plunder in which the remitted
convicts and those whose terms of service had expired were thus
tempted to engage, together with the temptation to personal
redress of civil injuries that is held out to the free
inhabitants, as well as strangers, from the distance and long
absence of any controlling judicial authority, I consider to be
very clearly established; and as these evils admit of very
partial and insufficient correction from the occasional and
annual circuit of the judges (if even it should have been renewed
in the course of this year), I have no difficulty in recommending
to your Lordship the early establishment of a separate civil and
criminal judicature in Van Diemen's Land, as a measure essential
to its tranquillity and to the prosperity of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>Before I proceed to submit to your Lordship the several points
in which I conceive that the provisions of the present charter of
justice are defective or insufficient, I will briefly notice the
exercise of legislative authority, to which resort has been made
by the several governors of the colony at different periods,
either in the enactment of new regulations, or in the modified
application of the laws of England.</p>
<p>Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde has informed me, that by the desire
of Governor Macquarrie he undertook the compilation of the
several orders and regulations that had been issued by the
governors of the colony, and had made some progress in that work,
when he found himself interrupted by the increase of business in
the Criminal Court. These orders embrace a great variety of
subjects, chiefly relating to the police of the town and
country&mdash;the imposition of tolls&mdash;the regulation of the
prices of provisions purchased by government, as well as the
modes of payment for such supplies&mdash;the regulation of
convict labour&mdash;of the value of the colonial currency, and
the rate of interest on money. Prohibitory and penal enactments
have been likewise extended by the same authority to the private
distillation of spirits&mdash;to meetings of tine
inhabitants&mdash;to the introduction of spirits without the
payment of duty&mdash;the cutting of timber without leave, and to
certain acts of trespass committed on the property of
government.</p>
<p>These enactments have been issued either in the form of orders
or proclamations; and in later periods when they have been issued
by the advice of the law officers, they have generally assumed
the latter form.</p>
<p>I have already had occasion to advert to the notice that has
been taken in judicial proceedings of some of these orders, and
their obligatory effect upon the inhabitants of the colony. They
have gradually increased in number and importance; and as they
have never been collected or published in any more authentic form
than in that of the Sydney Gazette, and some of the orders were
only communicated to the public separately before the Sydney
Gazette was established in the year 1803, great difficulty was
experienced by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde in obtaining any regular
or authentic series of them. An alphabetical abstract of such
orders as he had been able to collect previous to the period of
my departure from the colony is to be found in the Appendix,
together with a reference to the dates of their publication in
the Sydney Gazette.</p>
<p>During the administration of Governor Macquarrie most of the
proclamations and orders that contained any important enactments
have been prepared and issued by the advice of the judge
advocates, and sometimes by that of the judge of the Supreme
Court; but it appears that these officers have not always
concurred in the views of expediency or policy upon which the
proclamations were issued. And upon one occasion Governor
Macquarrie appears to have issued an order respecting the
inclosure of lands and fences, without consulting either of the
judges; but that after learning front them the circumstances that
rendered a compliance with it impracticable, the governor
immediately adopted the suggestion made by Mr. Justice Field, of
the necessity of issuing a proclamation on the following week for
the purpose of correcting it.</p>
<p>The object that the governor had in view was to afford
encouragement to the inclosure of lands, and protection to the
owners from vexatious demands for real or pretended damage. The
means of effecting this object had been submitted to a meeting of
the magistrates of the colony in the year 1816. It had been
recommended by that meeting that the rates of poundage for cattle
that were distrained and impounded for damage on cultivated lands
should be reduced, and it had also been recommended by the
magistrates that no person should be held to be entitled to any
compensation for such damage, unless the land that had sustained
it should have been inclosed with a good and sufficient fence.
Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde had attended this meeting, and had
informed Governor Macquarrie that however desirable this measure
might be as an encouragement to the inclosure of lands, yet that
the courts of justice would not be able to conform to it as a
principle of decision, in considering any question of trespass
that might come before them; and that the law of England did not
require the previous inclosure of lands as a necessary or
indispensible condition for the recovery of damage done to them
by cattle.</p>
<p>A sense, however, of the advantages to be derived from the
general adoption of fences and the inclosure of lands, as well as
the prevention of vexatious and oppressive charges for damage,
induced Governor Macquarrie to issue a government and general
order, wherein, after fixing the pound rates at a reduced scale,
and declaring "that as ground sown with grain should be
sufficiently fenced to secure it against the trespass of cattle,
it was ordered and directed that, in conformity with the
principles of decision prevalent in England, no damages should be
demanded or receivable for trespass committed on cropped or
cultivated lands, unless such lands be inclosed with a good and
sufficient fence, at least equal to a three-railed mortise fence,
or one composed of two rails and a ditch."</p>
<p>As the terms of this order appeared to Mr. Justice Field to be
contrary to the principles of English law, and to exclude all
consideration of the wilfulness or inadvertence of trespass, he
transmitted to Governor Macquarrie the draft of a proclamation,
with the masons for issuing it, which the governor immediately
published on the week following. This proclamation recites the
injury and vexation to which certain of the inhabitants of the
colony were exposed, by having their cattle distrained for damage
alleged to be done to their crops by settlers who would not
inclose their plantations, but who too often kept them open for
the purpose of extorting such damage, and that it would tend very
much to the advantage of the public if such trespasses and
damages were more frequently tried and determined in the
respective courts of judicature. The proclamation then directs
that the provost marshals of the territory and its dependencies
should appoint deputies for the purpose of making replevin of
cattle and goods distrained, and should have power to take bonds
from the owners of the cattle in a sum equal to their value, and
conditioned to prosecute the action of replevin with effect and
without delay; and that if the bond should be forfeited, the
avowant (or the person distraining the cattle) might bring an
action in his own name; and that in such action it might be
lawful for the courts by rules or orders to give such relief to
the parties on such bond, as might be agreeable to
justice&mdash;the rule or order operating as a defeazance of the
bond. The terms of this proclamation are in conformity to the
English statutes that have been passed upon the subject of
actions of distress and replevin, and they restored to the
colonial courts the right of considering, the question of damage,
which by the governor's order had been excluded in all cases of
trespass committed upon lands that were not fenced. Although this
was certainly the effect of the proclamation, and that in this
respect it repealed the governor's order, I did not perceive that
any alteration was made in the latter document, in the subsequent
publications that appeared in the Sydney Gazette.</p>
<p>A list of the orders and proclamations that have been either
advised or drawn up by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, is contained in
the Appendix. They relate to the alteration of the currency that
took place in the year 1816; the suspension of the authority of
Mr. Jeffery Hart Bent, as judge of the Supreme Court. The
proclamation, in which it was announced that no mitigation of
capital punishment would take place in cases of killing the
government cattle in the Cow Pastures; the proclamation
respecting the registration of deeds, and the regulations
respecting hawkers and pedlars.</p>
<p>The proclamations that originated with Mr. Justice Field
consisted of one that was issued for compelling probate and
administration within six months from the death of the party, for
making provision for barring dower, and the confession of release
before the judge advocate; the proclamation already mentioned as
to replevin, and a proclamation for the better execution of the
duties of provost marshal and coroner. Mr. Justice Field also
prepared two proclamations at the instance of Governor
Macquarrie, for the enforcement of the English statute respecting
the jurisdiction of, magistrates in wages and contracts for
labour in husbandry under 10<i>l</i>.; and a general proclamation
relating to the penalties that had been annexed to the colonial
regulations, and giving power to the magistrates to enforce the
recovery of them.</p>
<p>The tenor and provisions of these last proclamations were
strictly conformable to those of the English statutes; and the
object of the last proclamation, dated 21st November 1818, was to
indicate to the magistrates the method of enforcing and
recovering the fines and penalties that had been or should
hereafter be enforced by any of the orders or proclamations
issued by the governors of the colony, many of which, although
containing penalties, had failed to state the mode in which they
were to be recovered or applied. One moiety of the penalties was
declared by the new proclamation to be payable to the governor,
to be applied as he should think proper; the other moiety to the
informer. A power was also given to the magistrates to commit the
offender to gaol until satisfaction should be made; and in
default of sureties, to commit a person accused of any breach of
the regulations until the charge should be heard. This
proclamation was considered by Mr. Justice Field to be necessary
to give efficiency to the authority of the magistrates in the
enforcement of the colonial regulations; but it does not appear
that either in this, or in the proclamation that gave
jurisdiction of magistrates over wages and contracts for labour
in husbandry, Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde concurred. In the first
case he considered that the authority was too extensively given,
and in the latter his objection seems to have arisen from not
having received a correct impression of the object and tendency
of the proclamation.</p>
<p>Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde has, however, equally with Mr.
Justice Field, been impressed with the necessity of supporting
the legislative authority of the governor of the colony, in as
far as it extended to local regulations, and in as far as the
spirit of those regulations was not repugnant to that of the law
of England. They further seemed to consider, that the degree of
severity in which the local regulations of the colony were found
to exceed those of similar provisions in Great Britain, was a
point of discretion which must of necessity be left to the
supreme controlling authority of the governor; and in this sense
it is, that Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde has declared that the orders
of the governors of the colony were equally obligatory as acts of
the British Parliament.</p>
<p>A case of resistance to a prohibitory order that had been
issued to the military sentries, enjoining them to prevent any
persons from taking females on board the vessels in the harbour
without a pass from the naval officer, was punished by a heavy
fine of 50<i>l</i>. sterling on a free person. It appeared that
this person, when in the act of accompanying a free woman and a
native of the colony on board a ship that was lying at the end of
the King's Wharf and was shortly to proceed to England, was
stopped by the military sentry, who in obedience to his orders
demanded the pass for the woman. The person who accompanied her
being ignorant of the authority under which the sentry demanded
the pass, and being incensed by his unexpected resistance,
presented a pistol at the breast of the sentry, making use at the
same time of language of defiance. A pass from the naval officer
was afterwards obtained, but the individual was prosecuted for an
assault upon the sentry before the Criminal Court, and was fined
in the sum of 50<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>Although the violence with which the attempt was made by this
individual to force his way to the vessel was wholly
unjustifiable and merited punishment, yet it does not appear that
the prohibition was contained in any public order, but in one
that had been issued in a military brigade order, and the
inconvenience of this mode of issuing the prohibition, together
with the difficulty experienced by the sentries in distinguishing
between tree and convict females, has upon more than one occasion
given rise to some complaint. The necessity of the regulation,
however, appeared to me to furnish a sufficient reason for its
continuance; and it is one of those prohibitions that are
rendered necessary in the town and harbour of Sydney, as well as
in other harbours of New South Wales, as long as male and female
convicts shall continue to inhabit them.</p>
<p>With regard to the other proclamations and orders that I have
adverted to, and that have been advised by either of the judges,
your Lordship will observe that they contain very few provisions
that are not analogous to those of British statutes; although I
think that in one instance it would have been more prudent to
have abstained from giving a general authority to the magistrates
to enforce the fines and penalties contained in all the orders
and proclamations that had antecedently been issued by the
governors, more especially as those orders had not been
collected, as some of them were obsolete or had been repealed,
and when it had become almost impracticable to make a reference
to them.</p>
<p>As the practice of issuing detainers from the judge advocate's
office to persons leaving the colony constitutes a portion of the
judicial control that is exercised in it, I will take an
opportunity of submitting it to your Lordship's attention in this
place.</p>
<p>The regulation itself was of very early date in the colony;
and in the year 1805 an order was issued by Governor King,
requiring the masters of vessels before they were allowed any
communication with the settlement, to give bond in the sum of
500<i>l</i>. with two sureties in the sum of 50<i>l</i>. each,
not to take away any person whatever, without the governor's
certificate, if a convict, of having served his or her term of
transportation; and if a free man or woman, of there being no
detainer lodged.</p>
<p>The secretary of the governor was ordered not to deliver a
certificate under the governor's hand to leave the colony, unless
the name of the party had been set up at the door of the Court
House at Sydney and Paramatta, and at the store door at the Green
Hills, Hawkesbury, for a week previous to the ship's leaving the
Cove.</p>
<p>By a subsequent order, issued in the month of April of the
same year, the applications for these detainers against persons
leaving the colony were to be nude in writing to the governor's
secretary; and by a further order, dated in November following,
it was directed that no claims or detainers would be allowed
against persons who were advertized to depart, after the
expiration of tea days from the date of the advertizement, unless
they should have remained longer than twenty days from the
expiration of the first ten. For every certificate of no
detainer, the secretary's clerk was allowed to charge a fee of 2
<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. On the 10th February 1810, these precautions
were renewed in an order issued by Governor Macquarrie; and it
was required that the certificates from the judge advocate of no
detainer being lodged should be dated at least eight days
subsequent to the first public notice, and that permissions to
depart would not be granted until within two days of the time
specified for embarkation. The object of these several orders was
to prevent the departure from the colony of persons who had been
convicts, without a previous examination of their right to quit
it, either as arising from expiration of service or absolute
pardon; and to provide a security to creditors against the
clandestine or sudden departure of free persons, similar to those
that exist in most other colonies of Great Britain.</p>
<p>During the suspension of the sittings of the Supreme Court in
the year 1815, and until the arrival of Mr. Justice Field in
1817, the practice that had thus obtained of lodging detainers,
afforded the only means of recovering debts from transient
persons; and it appeared from the detainer books that were
exhibited, both in the time of Mr. Judge Advocate Bent and Mr.
Judge Advocate Wylde, that detainers had been lodged against
individuals for sums amounting to not less than
3,000<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>The detainers that are lodged at Sydney, before Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde, are merely entered by his clerk at the suggestion
of the party; and according to the evidence of Mr. Moore, they
are generally found to exceed in amount the real demand.</p>
<p>To prevent the continuance of vexatious and frivolous demands
made by publicans of Sydney against sailors, (and which the
agents of vessels were frequently under the necessity of paying
to enable the vessels to leave the harbour,) an order was
introduced into the eleventh article of the port regulations, by
which masters of ships are required to furnish a correct list of
the respective crews, that all credit to them may be cried down
upon their arrival; and it was further declared by virtue of that
order, that in such case no debt, contracted by any of the crew
during the period that the ship remained in port, should be cause
of detention to a sailor at the judge advocate's office, or
should prevent him from proceeding to sea. This order was
subsequently declared to be confined to the crews of vessels, so
that the masters and mates and all persons leaving the colony are
obliged to obtain certificates of no detainers being lodged at
the judge advocate's office, and to advertize their names in the
Sydney Gazette two days at least before the departure of the
vessel. The charge made by the printer is 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.
for each advertizement.</p>
<p>The effect of these detainers at the judge advocate's office
at Sydney is described in his evidence.</p>
<p>No notice of detainer is given to the party affected by it;
but if on making inquiry at the judge advocate's office before
his departure, he finds that a detainer is lodged, he is allowed
to take out a summons to the party that lodged it, requiring him
to show cause why it should not be discharged. A summary inquiry,
but not upon oath, takes place before the judge advocate, who
when thus informed of the nature of the demand, either makes an
order to the defendant to give security to answer any action that
may be brought against him in the Civil Courts in respect of the
debt, or if he considers that there is no just ground for
demanding security, he dismisses the detainer with costs.</p>
<p>In Van Diemen's Land, the practice of lodging detainers at the
deputy judge advocate's office, differs from that which has been
just now described. If the demand happens to exceed the sum of
10<i>l</i>. the party is required to swear to it, and if under
that amount it is merely lodged at his suggestion.</p>
<p>No fixed period of residence is required either in New South
Wales or in Van Diemen's Land to render persons liable to
detainers, therefore strangers touching at either place and
becoming temporary residents, are as much bound to observe them
as permanent inhabitants.</p>
<p>The inconvenience that may arise from this liability is
attempted to be removed, by requiring security from such persons
to answer any judicial demand. Persons embarking at Launceston
are further exposed to the inconvenience of obtaining
certificates of no detainer from the deputy judge advocate's
office at Hobart Town. The regulation by which certificates are
required to enable persons to take their departure from either
place, has in some cases been abused; and has been converted, as
must frequently happen, into pretexts for vexatiously delaying
the departure of individuals, for the gratification of malicious
and unworthy motives.</p>
<p>By the regulation introduced by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, of
crying down the credit of ships crews upon their arrival in the
port, the consequences that had been found so injurious to them
as well as to the owners of vessels, have been diminished; and
considering the risk to which the colonial creditors would be
exposed, until some more effectual control and protection was
afforded them by a summary appeal to the courts of justice, in
cases of vehement suspicion of the departure of their debtors, I
think that the practice of lodging detainers, although
susceptible of improvement, has been found beneficial.</p>
<p>The control exercised by the judge advocate over the
registration of deeds in his office, forms another portion of the
present subject, and has been created nearly by the same
authority as that by which detainers are issued.</p>
<p>An early regulation of the colony has already been adverted
to, by which it was declared that no assignment of property
should be considered legal unless regularly drawn up at the judge
advocate's office, and there duly registered; and a subsequent
declaration has been mentioned, by which the prejudicial
consequences of inattention to the provisions of that order were
partially removed.</p>
<p>On the 18th January 1817, a proclamation that had been drawn
by Mr. Judge. Advocate Wylde was issued by Governor Macquarrie,
requiring that all deeds, conveyances and judgments, affecting
land in New South Wales, should be registered at the judge
advocate's office, by an entry to be made by him of the memorial
of every deed in a book to be kept for that purpose, under a
penalty that rendered the non-registered deed void and fraudulent
against any subsequent purchaser claiming under a registered
deed.</p>
<p>By a proclamation that was also drawn by Mr. Judge Advocate
Wylde, and issued on the 18th July 1817, certain regulations were
made for the registration of deeds at his office; and it was
required that one of the witnesses to every deed should be one of
the solicitors of the courts of the colony; that every deed
should be produced to the judge advocate, or to his sufficient
deputy; and that the memorials should be registered in the order
of time in which they should be presented at the office for
registration.</p>
<p>At Van Diemen's Land the same rules prevail as to the
registration of deeds in the deputy judge advocate's office,
although the effect of the proclamations just mentioned is stated
to apply to the territory of New South Wales, and does not
specifically include the dependencies.</p>
<p>Having submitted to your Lordship a statement of the existing
judicial establishments, and the grounds of objection that
appeared in my judgment to render them unsatisfactory to the
feelings of the different classes of the community in New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land, I will proceed to enumerate the
several defects of the present charter of justice, that have been
suggested either by my own observations or that of others.</p>
<p>In this duty your Lordship will observe, that I have been very
much guided by the recommendations and experience of Mr. Justice
Field, as manifested in his answer to the inquiries that I
addressed to him upon the defects of the charter of justice.</p>
<p>The principal difficulty that exists in providing for them
arises from the peculiar constitution of the society of New South
Wales, and the risk to which its interests might be exposed by
the unqualified admission of the inhabitants to the right of
trial by jury.</p>
<p>I have already submitted to your Lordship my reasons for
concluding, that as a principle of judicial procedure it cannot
yet be safely introduced; but as it may be fairly expected that
the circumstances that constitute the present objections will
gradually diminish, both in New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land, but more especially in the latter, by the introduction of a
numerous body of free settlers from England, it would be
desirable that His Majesty should have the power of determining,
by order in council, the period at which the trial by jury should
be established; and that His Majesty should also have the power
of limiting its operation in the first instance to civil cases,
and especially to those wherein the principal question for the
consideration of the jury is the amount of damage; that the
intervention of juries in such cases should be permitted only
upon the united application of both the parties in the suit.</p>
<p>Whatever may be your Lordship's determination upon this
subject, I should submit that it will be found necessary to
resort to the authority of Parliament, either for the sanction of
a new mode of procedure in the civil courts of New South Wales,
for the purpose of authorizing any departure from the practice of
the courts of the mother country, that it may be thought
necessary to introduce, or of sanctioning that which already
exists.</p>
<p>The defects in the present charter, enumerated by Mr. Justice
Field, amount to nine; first, that of a power for the registrar
of the Ecclesiastical Court to apply for letters <i>ad
colligendo</i> in default of an executor or administrator.</p>
<p>It has occurred, that upon the deaths of convicts upon the
passage to New South Wales, or where the inhabitants of the
remoter districts have died suddenly, possession has been taken
of the effects without security or inventory, and that very
insufficient means have been adopted to give information or to
transmit the proceeds to the absent relatives. To prevent these
abuses, I think it will be expedient to give the Supreme Court in
New South Wales, as well as the court in Van Diemen's Land, in
cases where the next of kin or an executor when cited shall
refuse to take out administration or probate, the power of
granting letters <i>ad colligendo</i> or of administration to the
registrars of the respective courts, for the purpose of enabling
them to collect the assets of deceased persons, arid to sell and
convert them into money under the direction of the court, the
registrar being first required to give security for the payment
and due account of all such monies as shall come to his hands by
virtue of such administration.</p>
<p>Secondly, The want of power in the courts of New South Wales
to proceed against parties who, at the commencement of the action
and on the return of the writ, should be out of the colony. This
defect was noticed by Mr. Bent in his letter to your Lordship
dated 4th November 1815; aim it is proposed by Mr. Justice Field
to give the same power to the courts of New South Wales to
proceed against absent defendants, and by the same process of
sequestration of their property, that is given by the Bengal and
Ceylon charters. The object of this proceeding is to compel the
appearance of an absent defendant; and the provision that is
suggested by Mr. Justice Field, being in every respect preferable
to that which is adopted in the courts of the West India
colonies, by affixing the proclamations to the doors of the
parish churches, I should recommend its adoption in New South
Wales, and to the same effect and extent as that which is
expressed in the Ceylon charter.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Field has likewise suggested a difficulty that
will arise in proceeding against absent partners, or joint
contractors, for want of the same process of outlawry that is
deemed necessary to be pursued in England, before a plaintiff can
proceed against the partners that are present. Of the two
remedies that he has proposed for this want of power in the
colonial courts, that which is in some degree analogous to the
process of outlawry, is preferable to that of a declaratory
enactment, by which, on a return made by the provost marshal of a
defendant co-partner being out of the jurisdiction of the court,
and having no property in it, a plaintiff might have liberty to
proceed against the other resident partners.</p>
<p>The proclamations that are made by the sheriffs in England, in
the execution of the process of outlawry, may be ordered to be
made at the market-places at Sydney and Hobart Town, by the
provost marshal; and a power may be given to the plaintiff to
proceed in his action against partners, who are within the
jurisdiction after the expiration of one year front the last
proclamation.</p>
<p>The third defect of the present charter mentioned by Mr.
Justice Meld, is that of a revenue jurisdiction, and power to sue
for the King's debts.</p>
<p>Your Lordship will have observed that Mr. Justice Field has
entertained great doubts, whether under the present charter,
which recites only the necessity of making sufficient provision
for the recovery of debts, and determining of private causes
between party and party in New South Wales, any popular action
could be tried in the Supreme Court, or one wherein it might be
considered that His Majesty was a party.</p>
<p>By the statute of the 54 Geo. III. c. 15, houses and lands in
New South Wales and its dependencies, were declared to be liable
and chargeable with all just debts, duties and demands owing to
his Majesty, or to any of his subjects; and were further made
subject to the like remedies, proceedings and process in the
courts of law and equity in the colony and its dependencies, as
such estates would be in England.</p>
<p>There has, however, been no express declaration of the
competence of the colonial courts to try actions in which the
King's revenue and rights were concerned; and Mr. Justice Field
has always doubted of the power of the Supreme Court to entertain
such actions.</p>
<p>Two actions were tried upon the bonds that are required by the
port regulations to be given by captains of vessels before they
are allowed to make entry, or to leave the port, in which they
bind themselves to the governor of New South Wales, in penalties
of 500<i>l</i>. for every convict they shall permit or suffer to
embark from the colony; and in penalties of the same amount for
permitting or suffering any person who has ever been a convict,
or any free person, to embark in order to leave the settlement,
unless with the approbation and consent of the governor.</p>
<p>These actions were brought in the name of Governor Macquarrie,
who recovered in both of them; and an appeal having been entered
in one against the decision of the Supreme Court, it was
confirmed after hearing by the governor.</p>
<p>There were also actions brought in His Majesty's name on the
same bonds, and for the same causes of action, but they were not
tried.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie had no personal interest in the actions
that were tried, as the sums recovered were in the nature of
penalties for breaches of two colonial regulations, not only
important, but essential to the security of the convicts; and
although the bonds did not declare to whose use or in what
proportion the penalties should be applied.</p>
<p>From these circumstances, and from a wish to give as much
effect as possible to a very important colonial regulation, Mr.
Justice Field allowed the actions to proceed in the governor's
name, and considered him to be a party to the suit.</p>
<p>In consequence of the increase of the colonial revenue, and
the necessity of giving full effect to the penalties for securing
that portion of it which may be derived from the distillation of
spirit from grain within the colony, it is certainly expedient
that all doubts upon this subject should be removed in a new
charter; and that jurisdiction should be given to the Supreme
Court of New South Wales, and to the Civil Court in Van Diemen's
Land, to try all causes relative to the revenue arising within
either colony, and to proceed upon informations according to the
rules and practice of the Court of Exchequer in Great Britain,
with the exception of the trial by jury.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Field has proposed an augmentation of authority to
the equity jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, in the whole of
which I concur. It consists of an express authority to appoint
guardians to infants and to their estates; the transfer to the
Supreme Court of the custody of idiots and lunatics, now vested
in the governor of the colony by his commission; the power of
appointing commissioners to take bail, oaths and affidavits; and
a matrimonial jurisdiction to the ecclesiastical side of the
court, not for the purpose as Mr. Justice Field observes of
pronouncing divorces, but for enabling the judge to decree
alimony to ill-treated and discarded wives. The necessity of this
power has been felt by some of the magistrates upon applications
made to them for relief, but they have only been able to
interfere in cases where, from the condition of the husband,
their authority over him as a convict could be exercised by
returning him to the labour of government, or by an application
of the wages earned in his master's service. The extension of
this authority of the Supreme Court to the free inhabitants of
the colony, I consider to be both necessary and useful.</p>
<p>Complaint has been made of the inconvenience and expense
arising from the necessity that exists under the present charter
of issuing a summons in all cases before a writ of <i>capias</i>
can issue; and this complaint of the defect of power in the
Supreme Court, to proceed in certain cases in a more summary
manner than is directed by the charter, is not without
foundation.</p>
<p>To remedy this inconvenience Mr. Justice Field has proposed,
that the power that is given to the Supreme Court in the Bengal
charter, should be given to that of New South Wales; and that in
all cases where the plaintiff shall make affidavit of a debt
amounting to the sum of 15<i>l</i>. sterling and upwards, and
shall prove to the satisfaction of the court a case of personal
wrong, or vehement suspicion of the defendant's intention to fly
from the jurisdiction, the <i>capias</i> might issue in the first
instance. In the expediency of this improvement I entirely
concur.</p>
<p>The last provision recommended by Mr. Justice Field, is a
direction similar to that which is contained in the Bengal and
Ceylon charters, for reducing the evidence to writing, to be
signed by the witnesses in all cases where an appeal may be made
from the decision of the Supreme Court to the governor; with a
further direction to the court, to transmit a copy of such
evidence, together with the other proceedings, judgments, decrees
and orders, in the respective causes, to the Appeal Court.</p>
<p>I did not observe that this practice prevailed in the Court of
Appeal, where statements of the case only, and of the evidence as
taken in the court below, were made by the solicitors of the
parties, and after being delivered to the judge advocate were
read to the governor in court.</p>
<p>As it is very desirable that the grounds of judgment and
decision should be authentically and fully reported to the Court
of Appeal, to enable it to form its own decision, I entirely
concur in the recommendation of Mr. Justice Field.</p>
<p>Respecting the constitution of the Supreme Court: As I have
already declared my opinion that the intervention of a jury
cannot in the actual state of the colony be advantageously
resorted to, I consider that the present mode of supplying its
powers by the appointment of two magistrates is that which is
most free from objection, and the least likely to introduce into
the deliberations of the tribunal the operation of local
prejudices and hostility.</p>
<p>An augmentation in the number of magistrates of New South
Wales will tend to relieve that body from the inconvenience of a
long and continued attendance upon the sittings of the Supreme
Court; and the appointment of a barrister to the office of
attorney-general will afford the means of transferring to him the
duty that the judge now performs of master in chancery and
examiner in equity.</p>
<p>The two members of the Supreme Court, appointed by the
governor, should be henceforth considered to be judges of
questions of fact; but the decision of the judge upon all
questions of law, and upon points of practice, should be declared
to be conclusive and independent.</p>
<p>The alterations that I have now to submit to your Lordship's
consideration in the criminal judicature, are such as appear to
me to be suggested by a statement of the inconveniences that have
been found to result from its present structure and limited
extent.</p>
<p>I should in the first place recommend an immediate and entire
separation of the criminal jurisdictions of New South Wales and
Van Diemen's Land, by giving to each a distinct and independent,
but similar judicature, consisting of the judge of the Civil
Court in each place, and seven officers of the sea and land
forces, being above the age of twenty-one.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of the Criminal Court of New South Wales
should be declared to include all and every settlement already
made or that hereafter may be made on the eastern, northern and
southern coasts of New South Wales, or within the limits of the
governor's commission, a power being reserved to his Majesty to
establish in the different settlements, by commission under his
sign manual, separate courts, composed of a judge and four and
six officers of the sea and land forces, whenever the progress of
the settlements may seem to His Majesty to require such
establishment.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of the Criminal Court of Van Diemen's Land
should be declared to include that island as well as the islands
contiguous, and specially all those situated in Bass's Straits.
The latter are frequently occupied or visited by parties engaged
in the seal fishery; and it will be more convenient to give a
jurisdiction to try offences committed in these islands to the
court in Van Diemen's Land, than to the court in New South
Wales.</p>
<p>There should be a power given to the governor and
lieutenant-governor to appoint the places at which the Criminal
Courts shall assemble, as it will be found more convenient, as
well as more conducive to the ends of justice, that the Criminal
Courts shall sometimes hold their sittings at Windsor or
Paramatta rather than at Sydney; and that in Van Diemen's Land
sittings should sometimes be held at Launceston rather than at
Hobart Town.</p>
<p>It is observed by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, that the power of
convening both the Civil and Criminal Courts in New South Wales
and Van Diemen's Land is vested in the governor and
lieutenant-governor, together with the power of appointing and
removing the members who are to compose it. The judge advocate,
in doing justice to the motives of impartiality by which these
powers have been hitherto exercised by Governor Macquarrie, has
justly remarked upon their possible abuse, either in a capricious
or arbitrary refusal of the governor to appoint members, or to
issue a summons to convene a court. He has further remarked upon
the influence that the governor, as commander of the forces, may
be supposed to possess over the opinions of the officers
composing the Criminal Court, and who generally consist of those
who are under the governor's immediate command.</p>
<p>The two first of these objections may be removed by a
declaration in the charter, that the sittings of the Criminal
Court shall be held regularly four times in every year at least,
and as much oftener as occasion may seem to the governor or
lieutenant-governor to require; that they are respectively
required to appoint seven officers of His Majesty's sea or land
forces for the Criminal Court; a right of challenge to the
members so appointed being given to the prosecutor and prisoner
in criminal cases, on account of interest alone; and that when
such challenge shall be admitted, that in such cases the governor
or lieutenant-governor shall be required to appoint other
officers to complete the number of the members of the Criminal
Court.</p>
<p>As long as this mode of trial shall be deemed expedient, and
more conducive to the ends of justice than that which substitutes
a jury for the determination of questions of fact, (a point upon
which I have already submitted my opinion to your Lordship), the
influence that the power of nomination may give to the governor
will, perhaps, furnish a ground of objection to those who are
accustomed to regard the institution of trial by jury, as the
only and the infallible remedy against the operation of
influence, or the effect of power.</p>
<p>It is not, however, to the military members of the Criminal
Court alone that the influence of a governor of New South Wales
is both known and felt to extend. The disposal of the colonial
indulgences in the shape of grants of land to all ranks of the
inhabitants; the assignment to them of useful or useless convict
servants, constitute in the hands of the governor of New South
Wales, and lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen's Land, ample
sources of influence and of power; and I conceive that in the
only cases that could occur in the Criminal Court, wherein the
interests of the local government were directly or remotely
concerned, the exercise of an independent judgment might be more
reasonably expected from the members of the criminal Court,
acting under the sound directions of an impartial judge, than
from any selection of jurors that could be made from the
individuals now residing in the colony.</p>
<p>In the Criminal as well as the Civil Court of New South Wales,
I should propose, that one and the same judge shall preside; for
I agree with Mr. Justice Field in his conclusion, that when the
extraneous duties now executed by both himself and Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde are withdrawn, there will not then remain a
greater quantity of business than one judge will be enabled to
perform.</p>
<p>As the population and the trade of the colony appears to be
susceptible of a rapid increase, and such a corresponding
increase may take place in its judicial business, as to render it
oppressive to one person, a power should be reserved to the crown
to appoint a judge for the Civil as well as for the Criminal
Court in New South Wales.</p>
<p>With a view to avoid the difficulties that have been felt by
Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, in the application of such enactments
of the criminal law of England as have received the sanction of
the legislature since the passing of the statute 27 Geo. III. c.
2, and were declared to be applicable only in Great Britain, or
in Great Britain and Ireland, and not in Scotland, the powers of
the Criminal Courts both in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land
should extend to the trial of all offences and misdemeanors,
which, if committed within that part of the realm called England,
would be deemed, according to the existing laws thereof, to be
treason or misprision thereof, felony or misdemeanor.</p>
<p>The cognizance of all offences not capital, and committed by
persons who are still convicts, or holding tickets of leave,
should be referred to the decision of three or more magistrates
of the colony, who should be empowered to inflict corporal
punishment for such offences, amounting to one hundred lashes, or
transportation for terms not exceeding five years.</p>
<p>The crimes that would thus remain within the special
cognizance of the Criminal Court, would be those committed by
free inhabitants, and the crimes of treason, murder, wounding,
rape, unnatural crimes, forgery, arson, highway robbery,
burglary, and cattle or sheep stealing, committed by
convicts.</p>
<p>The judge of the Criminal Court should have the power of
issuing writs of <i>habeas corpus</i>, and admitting to bail; and
the sentence and punishment of offenders convicted before it,
should solely remain in the discretion of the judge, and not as
at present with the military members of the court.</p>
<p>The concurrence of five votes out of seven is at present
necessary to authorize the infliction of capital punishment. Mr.
Judge Advocate Wylde is of opinion that this number is not
sufficient in capital cases; and as I consider it important that
the combination of the duties of judge and juror should if
possible be avoided, and that some approximation should he made
in this respect to the distribution of judicial duty that
prevails in England, I propose that an addition of one military
member should be made to the Criminal Court, and that the judge
should have no vote in the previous decision of the guilt or
innocence of prisoners; but that no sentence of death shall be
executed, unless six out of the seven members shall have
concurred in the verdict. The sentence and punishment of the
persons convicted by the Criminal Court should remain exclusively
in the judge, subject in cases of sentence of death, as it is at
present, to the approval of the governor or
lieutenant-governor.</p>
<p>With the augmentation I have now proposed to the number of
votes necessary to authorize the execution of a sentence of
death, I do not think it requisite to continue the reservation of
those cases to the consideration of His Majesty, in which the
verdict of guilty has been given by fewer than five persons.</p>
<p>The duty of the judges of the Criminal Courts in New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land, will thus be very nearly assimilated
to that of judges in criminal proceedings in Great Britain; and
the combination of those incompatible duties that was created by
the last charter in the person and office of the judge advocate,
will altogether cease.</p>
<p>The consent of the governor or lieutenant-governor to the
execution of all capital sentences is reserved in the
constitution of the present criminal judicature and the power of
pardoning all offences, except those of treason and murder, and
of granting reprieves upon extraordinary occasions until His
Majesty's pleasure shall be known, is given to the governor by
his commission.</p>
<p>Under the present and future constitution of the Criminal
Courts, I think it will be advisable to continue these powers in
the hands of the governors and lieutenant-governors, who no doubt
will see the propriety of being guided in the application of
them, by the reports of the judges presiding in the Criminal
Courts.</p>
<p>The principal objection to the present constitution of the
Criminal Court yet remains to be considered, in the combination
of the duties of accuser, judge and juror, in the person of the
judge advocate.</p>
<p>With a view to separate those duties, I have already proposed
that a barrister should be appointed to the situation of
attorney-general of the colony, whose duty it should be to
receive all depositions and informations taken by the magistrates
for offences and misdemeanors, to prepare the indictments, and to
present them for trial before the Criminal Court.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Field is of opinion, that there should be no such
option or discretion left to the attorney-general as has been
exercised by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, in exhibiting or declining
to exhibit criminal charges, since he filled that office; and
that the civil action for malicious prosecution would afford a
sufficient protection against an abuse of the power of
prosecution, either by the attorney-general or by
individuals.</p>
<p>The evils, as well as the suspicions, arising from the
exercise of the obnoxious power of putting a negative upon
prosecutions, appear to me so much to outweigh the possible evil
of opening too wide a door to those that are unjust or malicious,
that I think it should be part of the duty of the
attorney-general to prefer indictments on all informations
transmitted to him from the magistrates of the colony, as well
for offences of a higher nature as for misdemeanors.</p>
<p>The appointment of grand juries in New South Wales has been
considered to afford an easy solution for the difficulty that
must always arise in an English colony, from placing that
extensive discretion and responsibility in the hands of one
person that in England is exercised by twelve, and generally by
more persons.</p>
<p>A list has been furnished me by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde of
those whom he considers competent to serve the office of grand
jurors, amounting in number to sixty-three; and although I agree
with him in their competence to discharge this duty, yet the
frequency and length of their attendance in Sydney, and the delay
and difficulty that would arise in procuring the punctual
attendance of witnesses for examination there, would lead to a
separation of the most respectable part of the population from
their estates and property, and occasion some suspension of the
important duties of the rural police.</p>
<p>The indictments and informations, with the exceptions I have
adverted to, should be prepared by the attorney-general, and if
in any case they should be quashed for informality, he should be
directed by the court to prepare another; that no part of the
indictment but the crime should be matter of substance, and that
defect of mere form should never be considered as a sufficient
ground for quashing it.</p>
<p>It should also be a part of the duty of the attorney-general
to read the indictments, and to state the several cases to the
court; to examine the witnesses, and conduct the
prosecutions.</p>
<p>These duties are at present very burthensome to the judge
advocate, and have not in any degree been relieved by the
appointment of a clerk of the peace, or solicitor of the
crown.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction and mode of proceeding in the Criminal Court
of Van Diemen's Land, I should propose to be exactly similar to
that of the colony of New South Wales, with the single exception
of the appointment of one of the stipendiary solicitors, now
practising at Sydney, to the situation of attorney-general in Van
Diemen's Land. His duties there being assimilated to those of the
attorney-general in New South Wales.</p>
<p>The great increase that has already taken place in the free
population of that colony, and the superiority of that class in
number and opulence to that of the Convicted, will render the
introduction of the trial by jury more easy and more immediately
beneficial than in New South Wales; but until the period shall
arrive when this distinction between them, whether fancied or
real, has subsided, I think that a civil judicature, composed of
a judge who possesses the advantage of a strictly professional
education, with two magistrates of the colony, and a Criminal
Court; composed of the same judge with seven officers of His
Majesty's sea and land forces, will afford the means of providing
in both colonies an efficient and satisfactory administration of
civil and criminal justice.</p>
<p>By the reduction of the number of judges in New South Wales,
the governor, when sitting in the Court of Appeal, will be
deprived of the assistance of the judge advocate; an advantage
which, however valuable to the governor on some occasions, has
had the effect in others of occasionally placing the opinions of
the judge advocate, and the judge of the Supreme Court, in
manifest opposition to each other.</p>
<p>With the more complete knowledge of the circumstances of each
appeal that the governor will be enabled to acquire, by the
course of proceeding that I have already recommended in the
future practice of the Appeal Court, no greater difficulty will
occur to him than that which is experienced by many other
officers in the colonial dependencies of Great Britain, in whose
hands are placed the powers exercised by the Court of Chancery;
and I confess that I have not been able to discover from what
quarter the governor of New South Wales would be able to draw any
portion of that judicial assistance or co-operation that is
attempted to be afforded in some other colonies by a council.</p>
<p>The assistance of such a body might diminish his own
responsibility and embarrassment, but I do not think that it
would be likely to augment the wisdom or the impartiality of his
decisions. In the absence of such assistance, or until it can be
afforded, I concur in the recommendation of Mr. Justice Field,
already submitted to your Lordship, of giving to the suitor a
right of appeal to the King in council in cases under the present
appealable amount of 3,000<i>l</i>., where the decision of the
governor shall set aside that of the judge of the Civil
Court.</p>
<p>A right of appealing to the governor of New South Wales
against the decisions of the Civil Court in Van Diemen's Land,
should be given to the inhabitants of that colony in cases where
the amount of the sum in dispute exceeds rot sterling; with a
similar right of appeal to the King in council in cases of less
amount than 3,000<i>l</i>. where the judgment of the Civil Court
of Van Diemen's Land shall be set aside by the governor in
appeal.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal should also have the power of awarding
costs to the parties, and making rules and regulations for its
own practice.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of the Instance Court of Vice-Admiralty at
Sydney is exercised by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, who holds a
commission that enables him to try all breaches of the laws of
trade, navigation and revenue, as well as suits for the recovery
of seamen's wages. Causes of the former description have very
rarely occurred at Sydney; and from a want of knowledge of the
jurisdiction of the Vice-Admiralty Court, in questions of
seamen's wages, I observed that they were generally submitted to
the decision of the magistrates.</p>
<p>A commission for trying all offences and misdemeanors
committed on the high teas is yet wanting in New South Wales, and
would form a most desirable addition to the powers of the
colonial judicature. Piracies and outrages have frequently been
committed on board vessels on the coast of New South Wales, of
New Zealand, and of the neighbouring islands, and have equally
gone unpunished front want of authority in any of the colonial
tribunals to take cognizance of them.</p>
<p>By the 57 Geo. III. c. 53. s. 1. all offences and outrages
committed by the masters or crews of any British vessels, or by
any persons that have sailed in or quitted any British ship to
live in New Zealand, or within any other islands or countries not
within his Majesty's dominions, nor subject to any European power
or state, may be sued and punished in any of his Majesty's
islands, under his Majesty's commission issued or to be issued
under the 46 Geo. III. c. 54. in the same manner as if the
offence had been committed on the high seas.</p>
<p>One of the objects of this Act of Parliament was to afford
protection to the inhabitants of New Zealand, and the other South
Sea islands, against the outrages so frequently committed upon
them by the masters and crews of the vessels employed in the
South Sea fisheries.</p>
<p>For want of a commission to try such offences in New South
Wales, the Act of Parliament has been completely inoperative, for
no commission exists in any colony nearer than the island of
Ceylon.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction that I should recommend to be conferred
should equally embrace the trial and punishment of offences and
outrages, committed by British subjects on the high seas, as
those described in the 57 Geo. III. c. 53.</p>
<p>To remedy the inconvenience that may arise from the
suspensions of the functions of the several courts, by the death
or departure of the judge from the colony, a power should be
given to the governor to make a provisional appointment of the
attorney-general to the office of judge, and some other person
learned in the law, to the office of attorney-general, until his
Majesty's pleasure be known.</p>
<p>In offering these alterations in the colonial judicature to
your Lordship's consideration, the expediency of providing Courts
of Conscience for the easy recovery of small debts in the colony
has not escaped me. Their importance in a new and agricultural
settlement is always great; and their utility is in proportion to
the facility of access that they afford, and the cheapness and
simplicity with which their proceedings are conducted.</p>
<p>I recommend that these courts should be composed in New South
Wales of the person filling the office of attorney-general,
acting as commissioner; and in Van Diemen's Land, of the person
appointed to fill the situation of attorney-general in that
island; and that in both colonies they should have the same
powers that are given to courts of conscience in England, for the
summary decision of matters under 10<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>I should propose that a salary should be attached to the
office of the commissioner appointed to hold these courts; that
the fees taken upon every cause should be payable only to the
clerk and crier of the court, and that the form of procedure
should be of the most simple kind. I should further propose that
the jurisdiction, that has been exercised by the magistrates
under the authority of Governor Macquarrie's proclamation of the
21st November 1818, by virtue of which they take cognizance of
disputes between masters and employers of labourers, mechanics
and artificers, should be continued to the magistrates; dug the
power of examining, hearing and deciding these disputes should be
given to not less than two magistrates, and that an appeal from
their decision should be given to the commissioner of the Court
of Conscience. The exercise of the jurisdiction has been found
beneficial in the colony; but from the disposition that has been
manifested in some of the districts to exceed it; and to
entertain causes of a higher amount and more complicated nature,
I conceive that it will be expedient to create a check upon such
abuse, by giving to either party that may be dissatisfied with
the decision of the magistrates, a right of appealing to some
higher authority.</p>
<p>The registration, acknowledgment, and custody of deeds and
memorials, that is now limited to the office of the judge
advocate, should, according to the practice that obtains in other
colonies, be transferred to the office of the colonial secretary;
and the fees upon the registration of deeds should be augmented,
as at present they hardly afford remuneration for the entry and
abstract of the memorials.</p>
<p>In consequence of the duties that will devolve upon the person
who may be appointed to the office of attorney-general in New
South Wales, and the want (to which I have already adverted) of
better professional assistance than is now to be found there, it
will be of much importance to afford inducements to an English
barrister to proceed to the colony, where, however independently
of his official duties, he may fairly expect to command a
considerable share of professional practice and emolument.</p>
<p>The want of such assistance has been equally felt by the
governor, and by the judges in their respective courts. That want
is not likely to be diminished; and the circumstances from which
it proceeds would of themselves operate as a sufficient
encouragement to two English barristers to repair to New South
Wales for the practice of their profession.</p>
<p>During my stay in Van Diemen's Land in the year 1820, the want
of professional advice was much felt by the inhabitants, who were
under the necessity of having recourse to the assistance of the
remitted convicts.</p>
<p>The prospect of professional emolument must of itself afford
encouragement to practitioners to repair to Van Diemen's Land
from England, whenever the establishment of a separate judicature
shall be announced.</p>
<p>I cannot quit this part of the subject without recommending a
reduction in the schedule of fees, by which the charges of the
solicitors in New South Wales are now regulated. They have
attempted to justify these charges by the want of punctuality in
their clients; and a practice amongst the solicitors as thence
followed, of detaining in their hands the fruits of one suit to
reimburse the unpaid expenses of a former one. These
circumstances constituted serious grounds of complaint amongst
all ranks of the community; and when combined with the heavy fees
payable to the clerk and registrar of the Supreme Court, have had
the effect of lessening the usefulness of that tribunal, as well
as the feelings of respect with which it ought to have been
viewed and approached. I entirely concur, therefore, in the
suggestion of Mr. Justice Field, that the salary of the judges,
both in Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales, should be such as
to exclude their receiving any part of the fees of office, or any
other emolument or advantage except that of an official
residence.</p>
<p>The fees now payable to the registrar should be reduced both
in items and amount, and paid and accounted for upon oath into
the hands of the treasurer of the police fund, from whence a
competent and fixed annual salary, not exceeding 400<i>l</i>.
should be assigned to the registrar.</p>
<p>Connected with the subject of the judicial establishments, as
well as the other branches of the colonial administration, is the
appointment of an agent to the colonies of New South Wales and
Van Diemen's Land, to which I beg leave in this place to call
your Lordship's attention.</p>
<p>During my residence in the colony, the expediency of such an
appointment had been suggested by several very respectable
individuals, for the purpose of conveying to the gentlemen whom
they had agreed in naming, their instructions and opinions upon
questions that were then in agitation, and which for the moment I
took the liberty of suggesting to them it would be more prudent
for several reasons to avoid. The great advantages, however, that
will arise to individuals, both in the colony and in this
country, from obtaining as well as affording information upon the
state of its affairs and of its commercial and agricultural
interests, separated as they are by so great a distance from this
country, and liable always to much misrepresentation and
conjecture, have appeared fully to justify me in recommending the
appointment of a colonial agent for New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land, and most fully to recommend the nomination of the
gentleman who was selected by several of the inhabitants to fill
that situation.</p>
<p>The registrar of the ecclesiastical courts should be required
to transmit to the colonial agent, a list of all persons dying
intestate in the two colonies, together with an inventory of
their effects; and to him may also with propriety be addressed
the frequent inquiries of relatives, respecting the properties
and estates of deceased persons, that are so frequently made to
the governors of the colony, without the means of ascertaining
the person or the authority of the inquirer. I shall have
occasion in other parts of my Report, to enumerate other duties
which may be beneficially assigned to the colonial agent; and
with the mention of those that are more particularly connected
with the judicial administration, I beg leave to close my
observations upon this branch of my inquiry.</p>

<h3><i>State of the Police of New South Wales, and Van Diemen's
Land.</i></h3>
<br>
<p><small>FROM</small> the mention that I have already made in my
first Report of the state of the police of New South Wales and
Van Diemen's Land, your Lordship will have been able to form an
opinion of the principal causes of its inefficiency.</p>
<p>The want of a sufficient number of magistrates in the country
districts in New, South Wales; the want of regular communication
between the magistrates of the districts and the superintendent
of police at Sydney; the insufficient accommodations in the
gaols, and a general relaxation of the regulations that had been
promulgated at an early period after the arrival of Governor
Macquarrie, together with the great increase of the convict
population, have all had their effect in diminishing the means,
both of the control of the convicts, as well as the due
prevention and punishment of their crimes.</p>
<p>The first regulations of police were issued by Governor
Macquarrie on the 10th December 1810; and the greater part of
them were devoted to the superintendence of the police of Sydney,
and the distribution of it into five districts, each having a
watch-house, one district constable, and six petty constables,
called "constables in ordinary", attached to it. The duties of
these persons in preserving the peace, and in the apprehension of
convicts found in the streets after nine o'clock; in securing
their prisoners, and reporting them to the chief constable, are
traced with perspicuity and exactness.</p>
<p>The chief constable was charged with the superintendence of
the conduct of the constables under him, the violations of the
sabbath, and with the duty of making a written report to the
superintendent or assistant superintendent of police, of all
occurrences that had been reported, or of all prisoners
apprehended during the preceding night.</p>
<p>The first establishment of this department in the year 1810,
consisted of one superintendent, an assistant superintendent,
five district constables, and forty-five petty constables.
Notwithstanding the increase of the population, I found that in
the year 1819 the number of these constables had increased only
to fifty; and in 1820, soon after the appointment of Mr. Minchin,
the number was increased to sixty-four, including eight specially
attached to the gaol, and six to other purposes hi and near the
town. More attention has, however, been lately paid to their
selection and remuneration. For a long period after the issue of
the first regulations, the district constables were entitled only
to 10<i>l</i>. per annum, slop clothing from the Kings store, and
a ration and a half, with rations for their families, per day;
and an occasional issue of spirits. The petty constables
receiving the same allowance of slops and rations, but no pay.
Upon a reduction that took place in the rations of officers on
the civil establishment in the year 1817, the allowance to the
wives and families of the constables was taken away; but upon a
representation that was made by the constables themselves of the
insufficiency of their allowances, and a recommendation of an
increase made by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde and Mr. Wentworth, the
rations were again increased to the full allowance of a ration
and a half, and a sum of 20<i>l</i>. per annum was allowed to the
district constables from the police fund. At all periods the
allowance of slop clothing to the district and petty constables
appears to have been in smear, ever since the establishment of
the police in 1810; and it was the subject of a frequent
complaint to me during my residence in the colony.</p>
<p>For this neglect I am unable to assign any cause, as during
the later years of the establishment there existed no deficiency
of funds; and although the issue of clothing to the convicts was
delayed, in consequence of the great demand that existed for it
yet the importance of stimulating and ensuring a vigilant
performance of the duties of the constables, by a regular issue
of their allowance of clothing, especially to those who had no
pecuniary allowance, was so obvious, that the expense of
purchasing materials and making them up in the colony ought,
undoubtedly, to have been defrayed from the police funds in
preference to all or any other charges whatever. Having observed
the effect of this inattention upon the constables themselves, as
well as the importance of affording some more effectual means of
punishing the petty constables for neglect of duty than their
mere dismissal from office, I recommended to Governor Macquarrie
to make a reduction in their ration to that of seven pounds of
meat and seven pounds of flour per week; and either to make up
the excess of one-half, or double that quantity (which I found
was issued to some of the constables) in an allowance of tea and
sugar, or in money payments calculated at the existing price of
those articles. I also recommended that the arrears of slop
clothing should be immediately issued.</p>
<p>As a principle of remuneration, the issue of larger rations to
constables than what was immediately required for their own
consumption was very objectionable, as in case of misconduct
(which frequently occurred) there could be no greater punishment
inflicted than forfeiture of the ration; whereas in reducing the
value of an extra ration to a monthly payment in cash, and liable
to be forfeited for misconduct, some security was provided for
good behaviour during the antecedent period. It had also the
effect of inducing the constables to barter their rations; and in
common with all remuneration of the same kind to other civil
officers, to swell the charge upon the King's store, and
ultimately the amount of the expenditure of government, instead
of remaining a charge upon the colonial funds. In every point of
view, therefore, and under any circumstances of the colony, I
should recommend that the remuneration of the district and petty
constables in the settled part of New South Wales, and in Van
Diemen's L and, should be reduced to a single weekly ration of
seven pounds of meat and seven pounds of flour; that no ration
should be allowed to their families, and that an annual allowance
of the sum of 20<i>l</i>. should be continued to be made in
quarterly payments to the district constables; and of a single
ration and lot per annum, with a regular issue of slop clothing,
including a great coat and four pair of shoes per annum, to each
of the petty constables.</p>
<p>The regulations of police provide, that a remuneration of
5<i>l</i>. should be given to any person or persons prosecuting
to conviction felons that commit burglary or highway robbery,
upon a production of a certificate to that effect from the judge
advocate. This regulation has been found beneficial, and it has
been extended to cases of extraordinary exertion made by the
constables, as well as by the military, in pursuit of
bush-rangers.</p>
<p>In Van Diemen's Land a practice has existed, to which I have
before had occasion to advert, of remunerating constables by
allowances of spirits, which at one period amounted to as much as
one quart per week. The issue of this allowance of spirits was
made to then every quarter, and was either the cause of much
intoxication, or of an interference with the profitable sale of
spirits by the licensed dealers. The allowance had been reduced
from that of one quart to a pint per week previous to my arrival
in Van Diemen's Land; but I found that the practice of
remunerating them by extra issues of tea and sugar, and of
blankets and bedding from the King's store, had been nearly as
frequent at Hobart Town as it had been at George Town.</p>
<p>In the return of persons victualled from the King's store at
Hobart Town in the month of February 1820, I find that no less
than ninety-six persons are designated as constables; fifty-four
of whom received double rations, and forty had their wives and
families victualled, making a total of two hundred and one and a
half daily rations. And on the 20th November 1820, I was informed
that an addition was made to their number, by the appointment of
three convicts composing the boat's crew of Dr. Bromley, the
naval officer, who received double rations and spirits. Fifty-two
constables are employed in the police at Hobart Town, including
four that are specially destined for the pursuit of bush-rangers;
sixteen are employed as watchmen in the town, and that number is
increased when ships are in the harbour, and when greater
vigilance is required for their protection; five are placed at
the gaol at night, and four during the day. The remaining
forty-four constables are attached to the Lieutenant-Governor's
Court, or are appointed to the special protection of the lumber
yard, or consist of the district constables around Hobart Town,
and in that part of Van Diemen's Land that is called the county
of Buckinghamshire.</p>
<p>Being desirous of ascertaining the reasons that had led to
such large remunerations to this description of officers, I
addressed a letter to Lieutenant-Governor Sorell upon the
subject; and was informed by him, that the impoverished state of
the funds of the settlement upon his arrival, and the necessity
of providing some mode of remuneration to persons serving in
situations of trust and responsibility, as well as to those
employed in the active pursuit of the bush-rangers, had led to
the adoption of the system; and that until the period in which I
addressed him, the police fund of the settlement had not attained
such a degree of stability, as appeared to him to justify so
large an annual charge as the pecuniary remuneration to the
constables would have required. The causes that are mentioned by
Lieutenant-Governor Sorell, for the continued depression of the
local funds, are satisfactorily accounted for by him, and will be
noticed when I come to make mention of the revenue of New South
Wales and Van Diem en's Land; but since the condition of both
have been lately so much improved, the same reasons equally exist
for making an immediate transfer of such a legitimate charge, as
the payment of all expenses of police, from the British treasury
to the colonial funds, and limiting all allowance of rations to
constables to that of a single ration, consisting of seven pounds
of meat and the same quantity of flour per week, with the same
pecuniary allowance that I have already recommended for the
constables in New South Wales.</p>
<p>As a great many of the convicts retained in the service of
government, as well as those in the service of individuals both
at Hobart Town and Sydney, were allowed to lodge there until the
establishment of the convict barrack in 1819, a power was given
to the constables of entering the houses where they lodged, and
of searching for them at any hour of the night, on any suspicion
arising of their being engaged in robberies.</p>
<p>The chief constables were charged, by one of Governor
Macquarrie's regulations, with the duty of registering the places
of abode of all the convicts in the different towns, and noting
their removal. At Sydney, and indeed at all the places in which
the chief constables resided, this duty was much neglected. Mr.
Wentworth had caused a census of the inhabitants of Sydney to be
taken by his clerk, in consequence of the inability of the chief
constable to perform that duty, and he had acquired pretty
accurate information respecting the houses in which the convicts
lodged. Humphrey, the magistrate of police at Hobart Town, had
paid very particular attention to this duty; and although
information was not wanting in either place respecting the
residence of the convicts, and that the establishments were in
themselves sufficiently large for the duties of police, yet I
observed that amongst the inferior officers there was a want of
vigour in enforcing those restraints against the convicts, by
which alone the commission of offences could have been
prevented.</p>
<p>In no regulation was it more conspicuous than in that which
required all convict servants to be in their masters houses after
nine o'clock every night. With the exception of that part of the
town of Sydney called the Rocks, the tranquillity of the streets
was well maintained, and instances of open or public outrage were
not frequent. Difficulty has always been experienced in
reconciling the free inhabitants to those restraints that the
nature of the population has rendered indispensible. That
important regulation by which every individual was required to
enter at the office of the superintendent of police, their names,
places of abode, and the names of their children and servants,
and the names of such strangers as were resident with them, was
resisted at Sydney, and has not been enforced there; and Mr.
Wentworth has preferred substituting the census that was taken by
his clerk, to the compulsory observance of the regulation.</p>
<p>At Hobart Town, in consequence of the state of the settlement,
and the sudden arrival on one occasion of a great number of
convicts in one ship, Lieutenant-Governor Sorell recommended that
the regulation should be enforced; and he published an extract
from the police regulations of Governor Macquarrie, that
empowered the magistrates to inflict a penalty of line and
imprisonment for neglect or refusal to comply with the
regulation; adding, at the same time, a limitation to the power
of imprisonment, which Governor Macquarrie's regulation did not
contain.</p>
<p>Mr. Anthony Fenn Kemp, who has already been mentioned in my
former Report, refused to comply with this regulation; and has in
his evidence alleged pressure of business as a reason for his own
refusal, and considered that the enforcement of the regulation
against him was unnecessary and oppressive, as he was well known
to be resident within a little distance from the court where the
penalty was inflicted, and that the number of his family was
always known. The magistrates, however, with the exception of Mr.
Deputy Judge Advocate Abbott, concurred in the expediency of
enforcing the order against Mr. Kemp, as a measure of police, and
committed him to the gaol for the space of hour, and fined him in
the sum of 20<i>s</i>. Other individuals were also fined at the
same time.</p>
<p>I have already observed, that the enforcement of all
regulations respecting the removal of convicts from the service
of one master to another, or from one district to another, was
more exactly and carefully carried into effect in Van Diemen's
Land than in New South Wales: Certain local advantages of the
former settlement, derived from the necessity of passing two
ferries over the river Derwent, by which a communication with the
most populous districts was kept up, afforded many opportunities
of checking the movements of the convict population that do not
exist in New South Wales. The resort of the settlers and their
convict servants to the weekly markets of Sydney, and the
uninterrupted communication that exists between the different
settlements of New South Wales, render the control of their
movements more difficult; but I found that the magistrates had in
no instance paid that attention to this important part of the
police, or had required that attention to it from the chief
constables, that had been manifested by the magistrate of police
at Hobart Town. It further appeared, that much of the business
that properly belonged to the superintendent of police at Sydney,
was executed by Mr. William Hutchinson, the superintendent of
convicts, who was in the habit of notifying to the public in the
Sydney Gazette, the weekly numbers of convicts that had absconded
from their masters, or from government employ, and that they were
wandering with false certificates.</p>
<p>The complaints, or the early knowledge of their absence, was
communicated therefore to him and not to the police, and no other
or more regular communication of it was made to the magistrates,
or to the chief constables of the districts. The authority of the
magistrates in New South Wales in matters of police, extended to
the recommendation of individuals for licenses to sell beer and
spirits, and to the deprivation of them; granting licenses to
keep carts and boats; to bake bread; and to enforce the
observance of the Sabbath. The power of granting licenses for the
sale of beer and spirits, had, from earlier periods than the
administration of Governor Macquarrie, been exercised by his
predecessors; and having perceived soon after his arrival at
Sydney, that the number granted in the preceding year, amounting
to not less than one hundred and one, was unnecessarily large,
and that it had been productive of mischievous effects on the
morals and industry of the inhabitants, Governor Macquarrie
published an order, in which it was declared, "that on no account
whatever, a greater number of licensed houses would be permitted
than twenty in Sydney; one on the road between that town and
Paramatta; three in Paramatta; one on the road between it and the
river Hawkesbury, and six at Windsor and the adjoining
districts." A tax of 20<i>l</i>. sterling was imposed upon each
license. The penalties for selling wines or spirituous liquors
without license, consisted of a fine of 20<i>l</i>. and
forfeiture of the whole stock found in the possession of the
offending party.</p>
<p>By a subsequent order, issued on 22d December 1810, the
magistrates and constables were authorized to apprehend and
imprison any person who might be found retailing beer or liquors
without a license; and as it had been suspected that the private
and clandestine distillation of spirits was very commonly
practised in the colony, it was declared that any person who
should be convicted of using or keeping in his possession a
private still or alembic, was to be lined in a penalty of
20<i>l</i>. and should be sentenced to five years hard labour in
the gaol gang, or transported for the same period to the coal
mines or elsewhere, according to the governor's will and
pleasure. With a view to encourage information against offenders,
convicts who came forward to afford any, were, on proof of the
offence, to be rewarded with emancipations.</p>
<p>A regulation, drawn up in a more technical form than the
preceding, was issued on the 30th March 1811, by which it was
provided that no person should be allowed to sell wine or
spirituous liquors without a license, under a penalty of
20<i>l</i>.; and that no wines or spirits should be allowed to be
removed from any house in the town of Sydney, or within ten miles
thereof, to any other place in the territory without a permit,
that was to be obtained on giving satisfactory proof to the
assistant superintendent of police that the spirits had not been
distilled within any part of the territory; the assistant
superintendent being authorized at the same time to administer an
oath, whereby the party was to swear to the best of his knowledge
and belief, that the spirits had not been so distilled; that the
duties upon them had been paid, and that the spirits were not
intended to be removed to the house of any unlicensed dealer.
Similar regulations were declared to extend to the districts in
New South Wales, and the magistrates were authorized to enforce
them in the same manner as the superintendent of police at
Sydney.</p>
<p>The limitation of the number of spirit licenses that had been
so emphatically declared by Governor Macquarrie in the year 1810,
was not continued beyond that year; for although it had been
reduced from one hundred and one to thirty-one, it was increased
in 1811 to one hundred and four; and forty-four licenses to sell
beer as well as spirits were also included in that number. In
each of the years following, the number of spirit licenses
amounted to one hundred and seventeen, ninety-three, and one
hundred and ten; these being the years in which the exclusive
supply of spirits for the use of the colony had been granted by
Governor Macquarrie to Messrs. Riley, Blaxell, and Wentworth, to
indemnify theta for the expense of building the present hospital
at Sydney. The original period agreed upon for the termination of
this exclusive privilege was the 31st December 1813; but in
consideration of certain statements that were made by the
contractors, Governor Macquarrie consented to extend it, first to
the month of May 1814, and subsequently to the month of October
of that year. It was not therefore till the expiration of the
year 1814, that the order for opening the ports of New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land to the free importation of spirits,
that had been transmitted by your Lordship to Governor Macquarrie
on the recommendation of the Committee of Parliament that sat in
1812, was carried into effect. It was not, however, until the
18th August 1816, that the practice of issuing spirits at a
certain fixed price to civil and military officers the overseers
clerks and constables, by way of remuneration, as well as of
paying for work performed for government in spirits, was
discontinued, in consequence of orders received upon that subject
from your Lordship; and as it appears by the governor's order,
dated 19th August 1816, that he had ascertained that the number
of licenses for the retail of spirits and beer in the towns of
Sydney, Paramatta and Windsor, greatly exceeded the beneficial
accommodation of the public, and led to consequences very
prejudicial to the morals of the lower classes as well as to the
police of the towns, he announced his intention of making a very
considerable reduction in the number of the licensed houses at
the approaching period of granting them. Individuals applying for
such licenses were apprised that no persons would obtain them who
should not be able to produce a certificate, signed by the
magistrates and chaplain in the towns of Paramatta and Windsor,
and by the superintendent of police and resident chaplain at
Sydney, testifying "their correct, orderly, and strictly moral
conduct". The price of the annual licenses was also raised front
20<i>l</i>. to 30<i>l</i>. The number of licenses that were
granted in the year 1815, appears to have amounted to sixty-seven
in the town of Sydney, thirteen in Paramatta, and five in
Windsor, making a difference of twenty-five from the number
granted in the preceding year. In the two following years of 1816
and 1817, they experienced a further reduction to seventy and
seventy-five. In the year 1818 they were augmented to
ninety-four; in 1819 they were reduced to sixty-two and in the
year 1820 to forty-six. The mode of granting these licenses
formerly consisted of an application or memorial to the governor,
certified by the superintendent of police at Sydney, or by the
magistrates in the country; and from the year 1816 until the year
1820, the good character of the applicants was required to be
supported by the attestation of a magistrate and one of the
chaplains. Securities were taken by the superintendent of police,
and latterly by the clerk of the peace, in the amount of
50<i>l</i>., from the publicans themselves, and two other persons
in the same amount, but they were for the most part nominal; and
it is stated by Mr. R. L. Murray, who acted as assistant
superintendent to Mr. Wentworth, that the publicans were allowed
to become securities for each other. In one instance I found that
the convict clerk of the clerk of the peace, had been allowed to
become security in the year 1820 for a publican at Windsor, to
whom a license had been ordered by Governor Macquarrie, after
being refused by the magistrates on account of the lateness of
the application.</p>
<p>The mode pursued in conducting the system of licenses at
Sydney is described in the evidence of Mr. R. L. Murray. The
applications for them, after receiving the signature of Mr.
Wentworth, the superintendent of police, and if possible those of
the resident chaplain at Sydney, or resident magistrates and
chaplains of the districts, were left at Government House, where,
aver being submitted to the governor's consideration, they were
returned, with a written direction from him to the
superintendent, to issue licenses to such of the applicants as
the governor approved. On a day appointed, which was generally in
the month of February in each year, the parties attended; and the
licenses having been previously made out by the clerk of the
peace, and signed by the judge advocate and the superintendent of
police, they were delivered to the parties upon payment of a fee
of 6<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. to the clerk of the peace, and the sum
of 30<i>l</i>. for the license to the superintendent of police,
who was also treasurer of the police fund. Deviations, however,
from this practice appear to have taken place; and it is stated
by Mr. R. L. Murray, that memorials and applications for licenses
that had been refused by Mr. Wentworth, as well as by the
Reverend Mr. Cowper, but that had received the signatures of
other magistrates, have been returned as approved by Governor
Macquarrie, and licenses have been issued upon that approval. Of
this description were licenses granted to two women in Sydney,
whose houses had been notorious for every kind of debauchery, and
whose applications for signature had been constantly resisted by
the Reverend Mr. Cowper, although it appears that one of them
succeeded in obtaining testimonials from other quarters where
they ought to have been denied.</p>
<p>However commendable the motives of Mr. Cowper were, in
withholding his sanction to the continuance of the profligacy
that was well known to be carried on at these houses, under the
protection and advantage of licenses for the sale of spirits, it
appears that the refusal of his signature to testimonials in
favour of applicants for licenses had been much guided by a
reference to the regular attendance of the parties at church, as
well as a more strict conformity to the regulations of police
than Governor Macquarrie or Mr. Wentworth considered to be
practicable in the town of Sydney. Under a strong impression also
of the evil consequences to the morals of the inhabitants, that
had arisen from an increase in the number of licensed houses, Mr.
Cowper addressed a letter to Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde on the 16th
February 1820, in which be pointed out to him the principles upon
which he conceived it to be expedient that licenses in future
should be granted, with reference both to the character and
conduct of the publicans themselves, and to the accommodation and
situation of their houses, further took occasion to animadvert on
the inattention that was shown to the state of the licensed
public houses on Sundays in the town of Sydney, and the want of
sufficient investigation into the moral character of the persons
to whom licenses had been given.</p>
<p>Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde had, in the course of previous
conversations with Governor Macquarrie, and upon the suggestion
of Mr. Hannibal M&lsquo;Arthur, represented to him the bad
consequences of allowing the licensed retailers of spirits to
keep shops for the baking and sale of bread and other articles of
general consumption, and the expediency of giving to the
magistrates in New South Wales the same discretion that is
exercised by magistrates in England in the granting of licenses.
The governor acceded to this suggestion, and requested the judge
advocate to remind him of it at the recurrence of the next annual
licensing day. It appears, however, from the answer that he
returned to the judge advocate's suggestion, made on the 21st
January 1820, that the governor, with a view, as he stated, of
reducing the number of licensed houses everywhere in the colony,
and especially at Sydney, ("where", he said, "he was aware that
there were many bad ones",) had determined to continue the
existing system of licensing for that year, and when the
reduction had been effected to leave it thenceforward to the
magistrates. It is to be inferred from this letter to the judge
advocate, that Governor Macquarrie had had reason to apprehend,
the magistrates a disposition to extend rather than to reduce the
number of licensed houses; but between the date of that letter
and the 11th February 1820, the governor altered his
determination, and by a letter of the latter date from Mr.
Secretary Campbell, the applications for licenses that had been
transmitted to him were referred to the knowledge and discretion
of the bench of magistrates; and they were informed that the
signatures of the chaplains to the memorials were not to be
considered as indispensible requisites for obtaining licenses,
certain positive exceptions were made to some of the applicants
enumerated in the list, and a particular request was added, that
in no instance the number of licenses should be allowed to exceed
those of the year 1819, and that none should be granted to
persons who were known to keep loose and disorderly houses.</p>
<p>At the meeting of the magistrates, which took place at Sydney
on the 19th February 1820, the judge advocate took an opportunity
of stating to them the enactments of the British legislature that
were applicable to this subject, especially that by which persons
licensed to sell spirits are prohibited from exercising the trade
of grocers or chandlers.</p>
<p>The principal and most successful retailers of spirits in
Sydney and the other towns had combined these trades together,
and thus multiplied the temptations to the lower classes of
people to indulge in the use of spirituous liquors.</p>
<p>The judge advocate and the magistrates, previous to the
licensing day, had visited the different houses already licensed,
as well as those for which new applications had been made, and
endeavoured to inform themselves of the local demands that
existed in the different parts of the town, and the degree of
accommodation that the houses of the several applicants
afforded.</p>
<p>The usual notice of the expiration of the licensing year, and
direction of all new applications, properly certified by a
magistrate and chaplain to the governor's secretary, was inserted
in the Sydney Gazette on the 29th January 1820; and on the 5th
February, a notice was inserted in the Gazette by the clerk of
the peace, requiring all persons who had made application to the
governor, and who had obtained permission for such licenses, to
attend on Saturday the 19th of February at the New General
Hospital, with their securities, to enter into their usual
recognizances. The applicants, therefore, had no notice whatever
of the new principles of limitation or of lawn that the
magistrates had determined to apply to the granting of new
licenses, still less did they conceive that the certificate and
attestation of the chaplains of their character and conduct, that
had been required by the first notice, was intended to be
dispensed with by the governor, according to the directions
contained in Mr. Secretary Campbell's letters to Mr. Wentworth.
The magistrates, however, at the day of licensing, took the case
of each applicant into consideration, excepting those upon which
a negative had been previously signified to them by Governor
Macquarrie. Amongst these were the houses of Thomas Storer, Mary
Plowright, and Thomas Waples, all distinguished for the
encouragement of debauchery and profligacy of the worst kind; and
the house of Thomas Stillwell, which, as being immediately
opposite and contiguous to the lumber yard, where the great body
of the convicts worked, I had Previously pointed out to Governor
Macquarrie as highly objectionable and prejudicial. In the
propriety of the first exceptions, it is stated by the judge
advocate that all the magistrates agreed; but from the evidence
of Mr. Wentworth, I perceive that he did not concur in the whole
of the objections that were finally made to the applications, and
by which the number of licenses for the sale of beer and spirits
in the town of Sydney, was reduced to twenty-four; the brewing
licenses to three; the beer licenses to two; the number of spirit
licenses in Paramatta to six; in Windsor to four; in Richmond to
one; in Liverpool to two; and to four on the different roads from
Sydney.</p>
<p>It was further declared by the judge advocate upon this
occasion, and the magistrates had upon his authority been
confirmed in the belief, that no further jurisdiction could be
exercised by them upon the subject, and that they had no power to
add to the number of licenses then agreed upon, and contained in
a list which they all signed.</p>
<p>The principles upon which the new limitation and the
considerable reduction was thus made in the number of licenses,
were certainly conformable to the English statutes, and equally
so to the circumstances of New South Wales; but it appeared to
me, that however advisable it might have been to have adopted
them at an earlier period, or even to promulgate them in the year
1820, much individual inconvenience might possibly arise from the
abrupt application of them without any previous notice. This
inconvenience appears to have taken place; for after the
rejection of very many applicants upon some one or other of the
grounds already stated, those who considered themselves aggrieved
applied to Governor Macquarrie, some of them stating that they
had not been duly apprised of the peremptory nature of the
magistrates decision; others, that from not having been aware of
any contemplated reduction in the number of licenses, they had
made considerable purchases of spirits, which would be thrown
upon their hands if the resolutions of the magistrates were
persisted in; and a certain number also stated, that under the
governor's promises to give them licenses, they had incurred
expense in improving, and some in building good houses. Governor
Macquarrie being impressed with these circumstances, and not
being sufficiently apprised of the exclusive authority and
discretion that the English statutes conferred upon the
magistrates, and that when once concluded it could not he
resumed, addressed several letters to them, in some of which they
were requested, in some recommended, and in others positively
directed to issue licenses to certain individuals. In an answer
also of Governor Macquarrie to Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, who had
deemed it necessary, in consequence of information that had
reached him, to submit to the governor the reasons that prevented
the magistrates from re-considering the cases thus again brought
before them, the governor signified that in consequence of
promises of licenses made by him to a few persons in peculiar
circumstances, they <i>must</i> receive them. The magistrates,
having met for the purpose of taking into consideration the
subject of granting these additional licenses, came to a
resolution that it was not competent to them to entertain such a
question. I found, however, that licenses were granted to Solomon
Joseph, who kept the house of Mr. Richard Fitzgerald at Windsor;
to Thomas Carpenter; to Bernard Williams; and to Mr. John
Stillwell.</p>
<p>In consequence of the delay of Mr. Fitzgerald in making the
usual application, the memorial of Solomon Joseph had not been
transmitted to the magistrates at Windsor, or to those at Sydney,
previous to the 19th February, and they had granted a license to
another person who had been recommended by the magistrates and
chaplain, thereby completing the number of licenses to that of
the former year, according to the directions that the governor
had himself given; and although there existed no other objection
to their granting the memorial of Solomon Joseph, yet the
magistrates felt that it occasioned a departure from the
governor's rule, upon which they had already acted in other
places.</p>
<p>The license of Bernard Williams had been promised to him by
Governor Macquarrie, upon the condition of providing a commodious
house, and as he had complied with that condition, the governor
recommended him for a license, although his name had not been
transmitted in the first list that was forwarded by Mr. Secretary
Campbell to the magistrates.</p>
<p>A great objection also, in my opinion, existed to granting a
license to Bernard Williams he was coxswain of the government
boats, and superintendent of the convicts employed in them. The
public-house that he intended to open was at a little distance
from the wharf at which the government boats were assembled, and
Williams himself was considered to have profited largely by the
great opportunities that his situation afforded of smuggling
spirits from the convict and other ships, as well as of obtaining
early information of their cargoes, from having been always
permitted to accompany the naval officer in his first visit to
these vessels on their arrival, as well as from the contiguity of
his dwelling-house to the shore of Sydney Cove, and to the
anchorage of the shipping.</p>
<p>The license of Thomas Carpenter appears to have been urged
upon grounds still more objectionable: The magistrates, upon
their visit to the house as well as to those in the neighbourhood
of it, had considered that there was no necessity for increasing
the number of public-houses in that part of the town; that
Carpenter, who was the applicant for the license owner, was not
the real owner of the house, but that he was placed there by a
retail dealer, who had had a license in the preceding year, but
from whom it was proposed to take it away in the present, as he
kept a large retail shop for varieties of goods and merchandize;
and it was further known to the magistrates that Carpenter was a
man of bad character.</p>
<p>It is necessary also to observe, that he was one of the
persons mentioned in my former Report who had obtained
emancipation for the employment of their horses and carts in
accompanying Governor Macquarrie in his expedition to Bathurst;
and that after having remained for a few weeks in the management
of the public-house at Sydney, on the recommendation of the
governor, he was convicted of receiving some of the clothes of
his aide-de-camp, and was sentenced by the Criminal Court to be
transported to the Coal River.</p>
<p>The objections to the license of Stillwell's house have
already been stated; and Governor Macquarrie, in acceding to the
urgent application of the owner, Sir John Jamieson, and in
depending upon his promise to convert the house into an hotel and
tavern, had hoped that the objections that I had made on account
of its contiguity to the lumber yard would be removed. The
objection was partially removed by some slight alteration in the
premises; I found that in the course of the year the house again
became the resort of the labouring convicts, though not in so
great a degree as before.</p>
<p>I must here take an opportunity of remarking that Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde, in his anxiety to introduce the salutary changes
that he had suggested, had overlooked the various embarrassments
by which these changes were necessarily followed. Of this nature,
was the accumulation of large quantities of spirits in the bands
of individuals who were disappointed in obtaining licenses, and
who afterwards resorted to every method in their power to evade
the observation of the police in their attempts to relieve
themselves. The consideration of the public advantage to be
derived from the reduction in the number of licenses, was
certainly greater than that of the tones or prejudice to which
these individuals were exposed; but it ought not to have been
forgotten that no notice whatever of any change of the system had
been previously given to the inhabitant; and that the promise
that had been made to different individuals by Governor
Macquarrie had led them as well as others to suppose that the
system that had been previously acted upon would be
continued.</p>
<p>Whatever doubt, therefore, may have existed as to the
propriety of the terms that were made use of by Governor
Macquarrie, in transmitting to the magistrates the applications
that they had already rejected, yet, with the exception of
Carpenter's license and that of Bernard Williams, it does not
appear that this exercise of authority, or what indeed the
governor had long regarded as prerogative in himself and his
predecessors, was attended with any prejudicial consequences.
With more caution, the reduction of the number of licenses might
have been made beneficial to the public, and productive of little
inconvenience to individuals; from the circumstances now stated,
the effect was just the reverse.</p>
<p>With a stronger impression than they perhaps deserved, the
superintendent of police, Mr. Minchin, forbore to prosecute
several individuals for selling spirits whose licenses had been
taken away; and I certainly observed myself, that the sale of
spirituous liquors in the town of Sydney, during the year 1820,
was continued in many houses that were not licensed. Three of
those that showed the most determined spirit of resistance,
continued to exhibit their signs until an order of police was
issued, declaring that they would be prosecuted and treated as
unlicensed retailers; and the disposition to resist and defy the
efforts of the police, became at last so general, that
informations were laid, and six persons were fined in the penalty
of 30<i>l</i>. each, between the 2d of April and the 9th of June
in the year 1820.</p>
<p>The difficulty of preventing unlicensed persons from retailing
spirits, and the benefit that was derived to the revenue, both
from the duty upon the importation and the licenses, had formed
an inducement to Governor Macquarrie at former periods to give
his consent to a greater number of licensed houses than the
convenience of the public required, and he was led to disregard
the evil consequences to which he had formerly felt and declared
that it must lead.</p>
<p>With a view to encourage information of any sale of spirits by
persons unlicensed, the penalty was raised from 10<i>l</i>. to
30<i>l</i>.; and by an order dated the 17th February 1817, when
recovered, was declared to be payable to the informer alone.
Informations for this offence previous to this period had been
very rare at Sydney, although in the other district, especially
in that of Windsor, they had been very numerous. I find that in
the period that elapsed between the 12th July 1813 and the 12th
October 1816, no more than two convictions are recorded in the
Sydney bench book for selling spirits without a license; but in
the year 1817, and during the periods when Mr. Judge Advocate
Wylde presided at that bench, seven convictions took place in the
space of six months, and three only between the month of January
1818 and the same period in 1820, during the latter half of which
it appears that Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde had retired from the
bench.</p>
<p>From the mode of proceeding on these informations, as
described by Mr. R. L. Murray, who acted as assistant
superintendent of police and prince clerk to the magistrates, it
does not appear that the technical objections to the
informations, that so frequently defeat prosecutions of this kind
in England, could by possibility have prevailed at Sydney. The
course pursued by the assistant superintendent of police there,
was to receive the depositions of the informer and his witnesses
unsworn, and to summon the parties to appear before the
magistrates on a subsequent day. The unsworn depositions being
then submitted to them, the informer and his witnesses were
subjected to a severe cross-examination by a solicitor, who was
generally employed for the party accused, and the decision of the
bench of magistrates was then taken.</p>
<p>It is also stated, that several informations of this kind have
failed at Sydney in consequence of slight variations between the
oral and written testimony of the wit noises, as well as of the
difficulty felt by the magistrates in giving credit to the
testimony upon which prosecutions of this kind were frequently
supported. As no entries had been made in the record book of the
magistrates at Sydney, of the evidence taken upon these
occasions, I had no means of forming a judgment of the grounds
upon which the several decisions had proceeded.</p>
<p>At Paramatta convictions of this nature were more numerous,
twenty having taken place between the 1st January 1815 and the
end of December 1817 one in the year 1818; ten in the year 1819;
and four up to the month of October 1820.</p>
<p>The constables at Paramatta were in the habit of employing
individuals, under a promise of dividing the penalty with them on
conviction, to go to unlicensed houses where they suspected that
liquor was sold, and to purchase small quantities, and on the
testimony of the witnesses the convictions most frequently took
place. This practice gave rise to a great deal of perjury, and
occasioned much embarrassment to the magistrates in their
decisions.</p>
<p>It was represented to me from several quarters, that the
interest possessed by certain magistrates at Sydney and one at
Paramatta, in the sale of spirits, had bad some influence both in
repressing informations, and in defeating prosecutions for
selling them without a license.</p>
<p>From the reasons that I have stated, I was not able to obtain
satisfactory or conclusive evidence of the manner in which the
prosecutions for this offence at Sydney had been conducted; but
from the particular manner in which my attention was called to
two cases that occurred at Paramatta, and the perusal of the
records there, I felt convinced that no want of energy had been
displayed by the magistrate against whom the information that I
received was particularly directed; and that although he was not
disposed to relinquish the mercantile profit that the sale of
spirits afforded him, yet he had never suffered that interest to
bias his decisions; and it was satisfactorily proved that
unlicensed persons, who had purchased spirits from him, had been
as often prosecuted, and as publicly admonished by him, as those
who made purchases from other persons. The effect, however, on
the minds of the lower orders, produced by the opportunities
which, at Sydney, they possessed of observing the personal and
active interest that one of the magistrates there was known arid
observed to take in the sale of spirits, must have diminished
their fears of prosecution for the breach of any regulation that
tended to restrict the consumption of them.</p>
<p>In a community, wherein it was of the utmost importance that
the exercise of magisterial authority should be placed above the
suspicion of being actuated by personal motives, it was certainly
unfortunate, and it is still to be regretted, that any foundation
for such suspicions should ever have existed; and that any of the
magistrates should have had, or should now possess an interest in
the extended use of a commodity, which they knew to be the cause
of mischief to the colony, in proportion as it was the cause of
profit to themselves.</p>
<p>It is stated by Mr. Wentworth that he did not consider the
number of licensed houses in Sydney to be an evil, as it afforded
a check upon the conduct of the publicans in the management of
them, which the owners of unlicensed houses could never be made
to feel; at the same time, that the tax upon the licenses formed
a considerable addition to the colonial revenue. It certainly
appears that in Paramatta and the neighbourhood, the greatest
excesses have been committed in houses that were not subject to
such control; and the profit arising from the sale of spirituous
liquors seems to have indemnified the owners of such houses for
the costs of prosecution and conviction for selling it without
license, as instances have occurred where the same parties have
been prosecuted and convicted more than once in the same year.
The magistrates had no power to take away a license during the
year for which it was granted; they only investigated any
circumstances of complaint brought before them and made their
report to the governor, who in three instances exercised the
power of depriving the parties of their license.</p>
<p>The magistrates, however, had opportunities of punishing any
improper conduct, by refusing their certificates on application
of parties for renewal; and it appears that such authority was
exercised in the ease of Margaret Waples of Sydney, whose license
had been refused for two years, and was only regranted to her on
a promise of better conduct in future. A few instances have
occurred of prosecutions against individuals for keeping
disorderly houses; but many of that description were allowed to
continue in Sydney, and some in very conspicuous situations,
protected by licenses, which under the well known circumstances
of the owners ought, unquestionably, to have been withdrawn.</p>
<p>In that part of the town called the Rocks, chiefly inhabited
by the most profligate and depraved part of the population, the
existence or the continuance of these evils could not be
prevented; they appeared, however, to have been augmented by a
practice that I observed to be frequent, of giving permission for
dances to be held at houses that were not licensed for the sale
of spirits, as well as for those that were. Much unnecessary
indulgence was given in this respect; and I further observed,
that the regulation for clearing the public-houses after nine
o'clock at night, and dosing them on Sundays during the hours of
divine service, were not strictly enforced.</p>
<p>With greater activity in the chief constable, or the assistant
superintendent of police, the inferior officers of the
establishment at Sydney might have been compelled to do their
duty; and from the observations that I was enabled to make of
their character, I think that nothing but compulsion, or the fear
of a vigilant and superintending authority, would have produced
that effect.</p>
<p>The deposit of imported spirits in the commissariat stores at
Sydney and Hobart Town, immediately upon their landing, except in
cases where the importers paid the duty, under the immediate
inspection of the naval officer and wharfinger, and the
obligation of obtaining a permit from the assistant
superintendent of police at Sydney, from the magistrates in the
different towns, and from the magistrate of police at Hobart
Town, for the removal of spirits exceeding one gallon in
quantity, afforded some restriction upon the illicit importation
or removal of them. A small percentage was allowed to be received
by the commissariat officer in charge of the stores, for gauging
and delivering and a fee of 6<i>d</i>. for each permit was
allowed to the assistant superintendent, and the clerks to the
magistrates.</p>
<p>For the purposes of further restraint in the sale of
spirituous liquors, any person that offered a less quantity for
sale than two gallons, was declared and deemed by the regulations
published in the month of March 1811, to be a retailer, and
subject to the penalties of selling spirits without a license;
and it was also provided, that no person should be entitled to
maintain an action for the recovery of any sum on account of
spirituous liquors, unless the debt should have been really and
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> contracted at one time to the amount of
20<i>s</i>. By a subsequent regulation, the restraint on the sale
of spirits by retail was extended to five instead of to two
gallons.</p>
<p>The illicit importation of spirits was considered by Mr.
Wentworth to have been very common at Sydney. Permission to land
them, or indeed any other goods, had been restricted to one quay
in Sydney Cove, called the King's Wharf: but great facilities
have always existed for the clandestine importation from ships in
the harbour, from the great extent of its shores and the numerous
bays and inlets that are contiguous. A constable upon whom it was
thought some dependance could be placed was specially appointed
to watch Sydney Cove, and a residence was assigned to him in a
house that immediately overlooked it, and that was within the
limits of the pleasure ground attached to the government house.
In the month of October 1818 this individual was brought before
the magistrates at Sydney for smuggling spirits, which were
detected both at his own residence as well as in the premises of
a licensed publican in the town. The military sentries posted at
the King's Wharf, and the wharfinger, are the only persons that
have received special orders to interfere in the landing of
goods; and no person has any direct interest in preventing the
illicit introduction of spirits except the naval officer, who
receives five per cent upon the amount of all duties collected
upon spirits and goods legally imported and landed, and the
wharfinger, who is allowed a certain rate of charge on each
package for wharfage. By the nineteenth article of the port
regulations, republished by Governor Macquarrie on the 6th
February 1819, it was declared that wine, beer, or spirits,
discharged or landed from any ship or vessel in the harbour
without a special and proper permission or license from the
governor, countersigned by the naval officer, was liable to
seizure by any constable or other peace officer, and to be
condemned by order of the magistrates as forfeited to the crown.
The master of the ship from which the spirits were discharged or
landed was made liable, on due conviction, to a penalty of
50<i>l</i>. In neither case, however, was it declared that any
part of the penalty was to be adjudged to the seizing officer; it
is equally observable, that no penalty was declared against the
act of discharging or landing spirits in any other part of the
territory than in Sydney Cove.</p>
<p>I have already had occasion to advert to the opinions of those
persons in New South Wales, who consider that the desire of
obtaining and indulging in the use of spirituous liquors is the
cause of the numerous offences that are committed there, and of
the indigent and impoverished state of the lower orders of
cultivators.</p>
<p>The great profits that have been derived from the sale of
spirits, have tempted those who were more immediately interested
in them to evade, and in some cases to defy the regulations by
which any restraint could be effectually exercised. The
magistrates at Paramatta have given every encouragement to their
police officers to apprehend and detain both convicts and free
men who were in a state of intoxication, and who were disturbing
the public peace; and at Windsor a place of confinement has
lately been added to the gaol, for the express purpose of the
temporary confinement of persons apprehended during the
night.</p>
<p>In my former Report I had occasion to advert to the
circumstances by which the apprehension of three freemen by the
keeper of the Paramatta gaol, for rioting and drunkenness, became
the subject of public discussion. Although this exercise of
authority by the gaoler, who at the time was not a constable, was
liable to much abuse, on account of the inducement that it
afforded him to go out of the line of his duty, to apprehend
individuals for the sake of the fee to which he was entitled on
their enlargement, yet in such a population as that of Sydney or
Paramatta, it was necessary for the magistrates to hold out every
encouragement to their subordinate officers, when clothed with
due authority, to prevent the numerous and shameless excesses to
which the lower classes of the inhabitants were addicted.</p>
<p>The returns of the coroner's inquests, both in New South Wales
and Van Diemen's Land, exhibit the fatal consequences of these
excesses; and the state in which the settlers or their servants
are observed to return from the markets, and the injuries and
accidents consequent thereto, amply attest the necessity of every
restraint on the immoderate use of spirits, that can be effected
either through the means of positive regulation or exemplary
punishment.</p>
<p>In the same point of view are to be considered the regulations
of an auxiliary nature, that Meditate the detection of crime or
the punishment of excess, such as the regular exhibition of the
names of the owners of carts and of boats, and of the numbers of
each house in the towns; and more especially those regulations
that tend to enforce a due observance of the Sabbath.</p>
<p>By the returns of fines and of the penalties levied in the
Sydney district, it appears that some attention has been paid to
the regulations of the first description, especially to the
detection of frauds in the sale of bread and meat; but it was in
the Windsor district that, under the superintendence of Mr. Cox
and the Reverend Mr. Cartwright, the greatest and most effectual
attention seems to have been paid to the regulations for the
observance of the Sabbath, as well as those that tended to
preserve or correct the morals of the lower orders. The
strictness with which these orders were enforced has varied in
the different districts; and in those where they had been
relaxed, and were abruptly revived, cases of undue severity have
occurred, in which the operation of motives more suspicious might
be traced. The violation, however, of the first orders issued by
Governor Macquarrie, for the strict observation of the Lord's
Day, had in later years become frequent, and was in some degree
encouraged by the example of certain individuals of the higher
claws, whose carts and horses were frequently observed to be
travelling on the high roads on Sundays. In the earlier periods
of Governor Macquarrie's administration, he had found it
necessary to issue both orders and admonitions for the prevention
of labour on those days; and the regulation of the Sunday
musters, introduced in the year 1814, had the erect of preventing
the frequent employment of the convicts in field labour.</p>
<p>In the year 1820 several convictions for neglect of all these
regulations took place; and notwithstanding the partial
inconvenience which a sudden recurrence to them occasioned, the
well-disposed part of the community readily acknowledged their
beneficial effects. The custom, however, that had prevailed of
holding the Sydney market on Fridays, had in some instances, and
especially to the settlers at the Hawkesbury, rendered it
difficult to avoid an occasional encroachment on Sundays; and the
custom that was still more general of observing Christmas-day,
and granting to the convicts exemption from labour at that season
of the year, and at a period that was generally a very critical
one for the wheat harvest, became the cause of interruption to
its labours that was seriously felt.</p>
<p>The fines and penalties that have been enforced by the
magistrates in the country districts, for the breach of
regulations of police, are paid to the clerks, and constitute
either a part of their remuneration, or a fund from which the
expenses of the offices and of the police are partly defrayed.
The fees on licenses to bakers, butchers and watermen, and those
on carts, are likewise applied to the former purpose, and at
Sydney, constitute a remuneration to the assistant superintendent
of police and the clerks. The fines and penalties inflicted there
are received by the clerk of the peace, who accounts for them in
his receipt of the annual salary that was fixed by your
Lordship.</p>
<p>In the Appendix are to be found returns from the different
districts of the fines and penalties levied from time to time,
and their application, together with the amount of fees received
by the clerks in the different offices.</p>
<p>The return from the Windsor district is the most full, and
embraces the longest period; but no distinction between the
amount of sums paid to informers and the crown is made until the
month of October 1816. The lines and penalties received at
Windsor, from the 1st January 1810 to the 30th September 1816,
amount to the sum of 502<i>l</i>. 12<i>s</i>. From the 1st
October 1816 to the 31st May 1820, the portion of the fines
payable and adjudged to the crown amounted to the sum of
240<i>l</i>. 16<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. the portion to informers to
the sum of 340<i>l</i>. 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>The magistrates have stated, that previous to the appointment
of their present clerk Mr. Fitz, in October 1816, the accounts of
the fines were kept by the chief constable and the clerk to the
bench; and upon an examination of the accounts on the 30th
September 1816, a balance amounting to 49<i>l</i>. 12<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. was found due to the former, which was paid by an
order of Governor Macquarrie from the police fund. The
magistrates have further stated, that prior to that period they
had no documents to show in what proportion the fines were
distributed; the person who acted as clerk at that period having
gone to England, and the former chief constable having kept no
accounts.</p>
<p>By the return of fines levied in the Paramatta districts from
the 17th January 1817 to the 25th July 1820, the gross amount
appears to have been 732<i>l</i>. 7<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. of which
423<i>l</i>. 18<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. was raid to informers,
90<i>l</i>. to the colonial funds, 162<i>l</i>. 2<i>s</i>.
7<i>d</i>. to the local fund of the district, and 24<i>l</i>. was
distributed to the poor.</p>
<p>In the Sydney return the fines and penalties levied by order
of the magistrates, from the 12th July 1813 to the 10th July
1820, amount to 635<i>l</i>. 2<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. and they have
been paid to the informers, to the constables, or to the clerk of
the market. Those in the district of Minto, since a bench of
magistrates was established there, amounted for the year 1820 to
31<i>l</i>. Those in the district of Evan to the sum of
33<i>l</i>.; while those in Liverpool and the adjoining
districts, for the years 1818-19 and up to the month of June
1820, amounted only to the sum of 105<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>The returns from these places (except Sydney, where no portion
of the fines and penalties appear to have been adjudged to the
crown; and from Liverpool, where certain portions have been
credited in the account of Mr. Moore, for government work
performed there) exhibit the manner in which the several sums
were applied.</p>
<p>At Windsor, an allowance of 5 per cent was made to Mr. Fitz,
the clerk to the magistrates, for the trouble of collecting the
fines; and the remaining items of expenditure, both in that
district and Paramatta, appear to have consisted of disbursements
in aid of the police, the dispatch of constables and coroners,
and sometimes of prisoners, stationery, and the repairs and
supplies of fuel to the office in which the magistrates met and
transacted their business.</p>
<p>The principal clerks to the magistrates were, Mr. Fitz at
Windsor, Mr. R. L. Murray (who acted for Mr. J. J. Moore, the
clerk to the judge advocate, and was since succeeded by Mr.
Croaker) at Sydney, and Joseph Bradley at Paramatta; of these,
none had come free to the colony except Mr. The son of Mr. Fulton
acted as clerk to the magistrates at Evan, and two convicts acted
in the same capacity at Liverpool and Minto. The principal and
assistant clerk at Sydney received salaries from the police fund,
and derived emolument from the fees that they took upon the issue
of summonses in small causes under 40<i>s</i>. that the
magistrates of Sydney were empowered to try and determine, by a
proclamation issued by Governor Macquarrie in the month of July
1810. It was then provided that the judge advocate should always
form one of the court for the decision of these causes; since
that period similar jurisdiction has been mimed and exercised by
the magistrates both at Windsor Paramatta and Liverpool; and from
the convenience that the lower orders of the community derived
from it, a general acquiescence had been established in the
authority that the magistrates had so exercised. I am not aware,
however, of any other foundation upon which it rested, until the
proclamation of the 21st November 1818, which extended to the
colony of New South Wales the provisions of the 20 Geo. II. c.
19, and gave to the magistrates the authority of hearing and
settling disputes between masters, servants, artificers and
mechanics, for work and wages not exceeding 10<i>l</i>. in
amount.</p>
<p>Upon inspection of the book in which the proceedings of the
magistrates at Windsor were recorded, I found that several cases
had been heard and determined by them, both before and after the
proclamation, that exceeded the amount of 10<i>l</i>.; and that
they embraced small debts of every kind, more especially those
for medical attendance, and in the recovery of which one of the
magistrates, Mr. Milcham, an assistant surgeon on the colonial
establishment, was sometimes interested.</p>
<p>It is stated by the chief constable of Windsor, that in the
space of five years not less than two thousand causes of a
general nature, and not exceeding 2<i>l</i>. in value, came
before the magistrates at Windsor, and that the expenses in each
rarely exceeded 10<i>s</i>. By the return of the clerk to the
Windsor magistrates, it appears that between the 1st December
1819 and the 11th November 1820, two hundred and twenty-six
causes, including misdemeanors, had been tried before the
magistrates; and that the amount of fees due to the clerk was
32<i>l</i>. 4<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>. and that the chief constable's
fees for summonses was 38<i>l</i>. 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. of both
of which a certain portion was considered to be irrecoverable on
account of the poverty of the parties. The clerk was also allowed
by the magistrates to charge 5<i>s</i>. for petitions for
mitigations of sentence, which in the year 1819 amounted to
123<i>l</i>. and the same sum for memorials for land, that were
estimated at 100<i>l</i>. which, with a trifling addition for
slaughtering and cart licenses, afforded him a net profit of
100<i>l</i>. An additional clerk, who was a convict, had latterly
been allowed; and he received rations from the store, was
provided with lodging, and was allowed the services or profits of
the services of a convict, who was also victualled from the
King's store.</p>
<p>The return of causes tried before the magistrates at
Paramatta, from the 4th September 1819 to the 26th August 1820,
exhibits the several items of costs paid to the clerk in one
hundred and fifty-seven causes of dispute between masters and
their servants, and misdemeanors and breaches of the peace, that
were heard and determined in that period, and which with two
small sums received for cart and slaughtering licenses, amounted
to 50<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>In the return that was made by Mr. R. L Murray, the principal
clerk to the Sydney magistrates, there is distinction made of the
several sources from which the sum of 133<i>l</i>. 16<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. (the amount of fees for two years, commencing the 30th
June 1817 and ending the 30th September 1819) was derived. It is
stated that two-thirds of these fees are received by the
principal clerk, and one-third by the assistant clerks; and that
in four cases out of live, the fees are remitted on account of
the indigence of the parties. The return further states that the
fees on slaughtering licenses and permits do not amount to more
than 1<i>l</i>. per week.</p>
<p>It has already been stated that the fines and penalties
received at Sydney, have been paid to the clerk of the peace
since his appointment to that office in the month of January
1817; and that he has given credit in his account for business
done as solicitor for the crown, for penalties as well as duties
recovered in the Supreme Court and received by him, against which
he would be entitled to set-off his annual salary from the date
of your Lordship's approval of his nomination to the office.</p>
<p>The amount of fees received by the clerk of the peace from the
22d February 1817 to the 30th December 1820, and consisting of
the fees upon spirit and beer licenses, upon withdrawing
recognizances, upon subp&oelig;nas to witnesses in prosecutions
carried on by individuals, and upon subpoenas of witnesses by
prisoners, amounted to 112<i>l</i>. 19<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>In the year 1819 a notice was issued from the office of the
clerk of the peace, intimating that prosecutors and persons under
prosecution were to apply there; and that they would there
receive advice as to the several matters in which they were
concerned, and as to the exhibition of informations against them,
and the time of appearance and trial. The precise purpose of this
intimation did not seem to be understood or much observed, as
applications were more frequently made to the judge advocate than
to the clerk of the peace. One instance, however, was brought to
my notice, in which the convict clerk of Mr. Wylde, sen. had
received, on behalf of that gentleman, the fee of 10<i>s</i>. for
discharging the recognizances entered into by a woman, who had
been charged before the magistrates at Sydney and admitted to
bail, for an offence that subjected her to be tried by the
Criminal Court, under Lord Ellenborough's Act, for cutting and
maiming. Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde had not signified that a
criminal information should not be exhibited; but a few days
before the session commenced in January 1820, it appears that the
prosecutor and the prisoner agreed to compromise the matter, and
that it was treated as a common assault, and the recognizances
were withdrawn through the intervention of the convict clerk of
the clerk of the peace. The fees taken by that officer have never
been approved by Governor Macquarrie, but the charges exhibited
in his account appear to be conformable to similar charges in
England.</p>
<p>A highly improper practice has occurred in the offices of all
the clerks to the magistrates, of allowing parties under
prosecution to obtain copies of the informations taken by the
magistrates, on payment of a regulated fee; and I further
observed, that at Paramatta and Windsor the entry of the evidence
in the record books was allowed to be greatly in arrear.</p>
<p>The regulations of police that have appeared to individuals
unacquainted with the colony to be most severe, are those that
denounce the punishment of forfeiture of property in cases that
involved no other consequence than that of a common trespass. Of
this nature was an order issued by Governor Macquarrie on the
16th August 1817, by which all boats in which any person should
be found to have landed or embarked, from a landing-place on
Bennelong's Point in Sydney Cove, were declared liable to seizure
and confiscation, for the benefit of the parties seizing them.
The declared object of this order, was to preserve a particular
landing-place for the personal accommodation of the governor and
his family. Another purpose of the order, which this precaution
would equally have met, was the prevention of access from Sydney
Cove to the walks in the government grounds, either for bathing
or for concealment. It does not appear that any conviction under
this order ever took place; and Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde stated
that he should not have put it in force if any violation of it
had come before him.</p>
<p>Of a similar import and effect was another order of Governor
Macquarrie, that he put in force against three free persons, (two
of whom had formerly been convicts, and one had accompanied his
wife to the colony); two native-born young women, and three
convicts, for pausing over the wall that separates the government
pleasure ground front the open space near the town of Sydney,
that is called Hyde Park. After the improvements in the
government pleasure grounds had been completed, an entrance for
the public was permitted through a gate, near to which a lodge
was built for a constable, and an order was issued by which
persons were prohibited from going over the wall, or destroying
the fences in the grounds within it.</p>
<p>It is stated by Mr. Wentworth that this prohibitory order had
been published; but it is not to be found in the Sydney Gazettes
for more than one year preceding the commission of the offence;
nor do I find that it ever denounced the penalty of flogging
against those who should contravene it. The person who was the
chief constable at the time, has referred in his evidence to an
order published by Governor Macquarrie subsequent to the
occurrence in question, dated the 6th July 1816, hut he was not
able to vindicate or to find any other order relating to the same
subject.</p>
<p>Mr. Wentworth states that the prohibitory order had been
published at a period long antecedent, and thinks that it had
been repeated; but both he and the chief constable agree in
stating, that the grounds that had been inclosed had become the
place of frequent deposit of stolen goods, on account of the
facility of concealment that was afforded by the shrubberies, and
that it was also a place of resort and assignation to disorderly
persons. The wall that separates the inclosed grounds from Hyde
Park had been frequently broken down; and parties, either from
mischief or from unwillingness to resort to the grounds by the
regular entrance, persisted in making use of these numerous
breaches.</p>
<p>A party of native blacks, that Governor Macquarrie had settled
on the northern shore of the lower harbour, were in the habit of
traversing the grounds in their way to the settlement, preferring
a direct and concealed path to one more public and circuitous. It
does not appear that any measures had been taken by the police to
prevent or remove the nuisance that these clandestine entrances
to the grounds created, and at last they were so often repeated,
that Governor Macquarrie ordered the chief constable to place and
conceal two confidential men on the inside of the wall, and to
order them to apprehend and carry to gaol whomsoever they should
find trespassing or coming over into the government grounds. They
were ordered not to apprehend any one until they should have
passed the wall and had got into the grounds. Verbal directions
were also given to them to take the offenders to gaol, and not
before any magistrate. One man, named Reed, was apprehended on
the first day, and Henshall and Blake on the day following. They
were seized as soon as they entered the grounds; and Henshall
stated, that he had come there for the purpose of collecting some
sand for casting metal, which it appears was the trade that he
followed in Sydney. Two young women and two convicts were also
apprehended; and one of the former was accompanied by a child,
and appeared by the declaration of the constable, to have
resorted to the domain for the purpose of taking a walk. They
were conveyed to the gaol; and the women, being much alarmed,
were suffered by the constable to go to the house of a very
respectable merchant in the town, in whose service one of them
was, for the purpose of leaving her child before she went to
prison. Her mistress having refused to give her up, was
threatened by the chief constable with a warrant if she continued
to detain her. The women were then given up and conveyed to gaol.
On the morning after their apprehension, the gaoler reported to
Governor Macquarrie the number and names of the persons detained,
and then in gaol, for breach of his orders; and after he had
answered the governor's inquiries respecting the characters of
the men and the women, Governor Macquarrie gave him an order for
punishing the three free men, Reed, Blake, and Henshall, and one
of the convicts, with twenty-five lashes, and the two other
convicts with thirty lashes each. The women were ordered to be
confined for the space of forty-eight hours in a cell.</p>
<p>The gaoler it appears had explained to Governor Macquarrie by
his desire who the men were, stating that Reed was a stone-mason,
and had received his emancipation; that Blake was a free man, who
he believed had come to the colony with a permission from the
secretary of state to accompany his wife; and that Henshall was
also free by emancipation, and had been employed (as the governor
seemed to be aware) in cutting dollars. The gaoler states that
the governor made no further observations, but gave him the order
for inflicting the punishment above stated, and that they were
inflicted accordingly in the gaol, and the men were then
discharged.</p>
<p>Mr. Wentworth states that the order or warrant of Governor
Macquarrie was shown to him by the gaoler before he proceeded to
execute it, and that he felt the strongest desire to suppress it,
thinking that the governor had issued it in a moment of
irritation, and that he would upon cooler reflection withdraw it.
It was executed notwithstanding; and when the circumstances
became known, created a great degree of alarm amongst all classes
of the inhabitants. Amongst the most sensitive were many of the
convicts whose sentences had been remitted by Governor
Macquarrie, and who afterwards joined in a petition to the House
of Commons, complaining of this as well as other acts of his
administration.</p>
<p>It does not appear, however, that the apprehension of a
repetition of this species of punishment was attended at first
with the desired effect, for on the 6th July 1816, three months
after the punishments had been inflicted, the governor issued an
order, stating that as trespasses of the same kind still
continued to be committed, all persons who should thereafter be
apprehended in pulling down or passing the wall would be punished
in an exemplary and summary manner. The wall was afterwards
repaired, strengthened and raised, and since that period similar
trespasses have not occurred, nor has resort been made to similar
punishments. The necessity for adopting it in the instance now
under consideration does not appear to me to be evident. No
resort had been made to the officers of police or the assistance
of the superintendent, whose authority, or whose vigilance at
least, was impeached by such an exertion of the magisterial power
by the governor; neither was there any necessity for dispensing
with the sworn testimony of the constables who apprehended the
trespassers, or of producing a belief in the community, that in
the commission of offences in which, as in the present, the
personal feelings of the governor might be supposed to be
engaged, an entire dispensation would take place with those
forms, by which the lives and persons even of the convict classes
of the population were secured. I was informed that in only one
instance a punishment of a free person without trial had taken
place, by order of any preceding governor, since the foundation
of the colony. Even with the allowance that man people were
disposed to make for the effect of temporary irritation in
Governor Macquarrie, that had been produced by the obstinate
perseverance of the people of Sydney, in perverting to criminal
and immoral purposes a place that he had been at some pains to
secure and to devote to their rational amusement and benefit; and
allowing also for the advantage of summary punishment in cases of
wilful or repeated trespass, the act itself, and the manner in
which it was executed, made a deep and lasting impression upon
the minds of all, and has become a sort of standing reproach
against the system by which the government of the colony has been
administered. Of the illegality both of the punishment itself,
slid of the manner in which it was executed, no doubt can be
entertained; and the only justification of such an act could be
found in the acknowledged inefficacy of others, or the
insensibility of the population of New South Wales to the same
methods of restraint or control that are found effectual
elsewhere. Until legal methods had been tried and exhausted, I do
not think that Governor Macquarrie could find any excuse for the
summary mode of proceeding and punishment to which he resorted.
There was no imminent danger that required the sudden
interposition of extraordinary power, and there was no practice
of such pernicious consequence or clandestine nature, that defied
the ordinary measures of preventive police, or the ordinary means
of proof either before the magistrates or before the Criminal
Court. The constables were ordered to conceal themselves within
the pleasure grounds until the individuals had passed the
breaches in the wall, and then without satisfying themselves, or
even without inquiring or waiting to see whether their purpose
was innocent or guilty, they were ordered instantly to apprehend
them, without a warrant, and to commit them to gaol. The object
of departing thus violently from all the forms of legal
proceeding, was to deter, by the effect of power, those whom the
fear of the law could not restrain. To me it appears that if the
object even had been gained by these means, and not by the simple
and obvious expedient of raising the wall, and making the passage
over it more difficult, the advantage that was obtained by an
intimidation of the careless and profligate, was hardly
counterbalanced by the feelings of alarm and of just
apprehension, with which this act was viewed by the moral and
reflecting part of the community.</p>
<p>These feelings were taken advantage of by persons who were
hostile upon other grounds to the administration of Governor
Macquarrie, and led to a statement of grievances that was
intended to be submitted to Parliament and was forwarded to
England for that purpose.</p>
<p>The means that were adopted for procuring support to the
petition, in which the Founds of grievance were set forth, were
not of the most respectable kind; and in the petition some are
alleged that could not in truth or justice be imputed to Governor
Macquarrie. It is unfortunate, however, that there should have
existed any ground upon which even the enemies of Governor
Macquarrie could fasten an imputation so foreign to his real
character as that of tyranny or severity, or upon which he could
be charged with a deliberate violation of the law.</p>
<p>Independent of the occasional orders that have been issued by
him for the summary punishment of slight offences, there exists a
restraint upon the right of individuals to meet together and
express their opinions upon matters of public concern, and a
restraint upon them in the exercise of a domestic right, that of
slaughtering their own cattle, that appears at the first view of
it to be the cause of much inconvenience.</p>
<p>The first of these restraints was declared in a proclamation
that was drawn by Mr. Judge Advocate Bent, and was published in
the Sydney Gazette on the 27th November 1813. The reasons for
issuing this proclamation are stated to have arisen from a
combination of certain individuals, which was promoted and
accomplished by meeting and assembling together, for the purpose
of altering the then subsisting rate of exchange between the
bills drawn for the public service, and the promissory notes
issued by different individuals. At this meeting they came to a
resolution of not taking in payment any private promissory notes
of any person other than such as were issued by themselves. It
was therefore ordered that no meetings of any description of
persons exceeding six, excepting the general and special meetings
of the magistrates, should be held in New South Wales, for the
purpose of deliberation upon any matters relative to the trade,
commerce, agriculture, manufactures, policy or interests of the
colony, without previous notice in writing to the provost
marshal, containing the purpose for which the meeting was to be
held, and signed by seven persons at least, and unless the
meeting should be convened by the provost marshal after a
notification of five days at least in the Sydney Gazette. All
other assemblies not convened in this manner were declared to be
unlawful, and the provost marshal and magistrates were authorized
to require the persons assembled to disperse, and if any number
exceeding six continued together after the space of one hour,
they were liable to be declared guilty of an unlawful combination
and conspiracy; to be sent to any part of the territory, and
there to be left to hard labour for three years. Although the
avowed cause of this proclamation has nearly ceased to exist, in
consequence of the substitution of the notes of the bank of New
South Wales and the store receipts, for the promissory notes of
individuals, yet as far as regards the right of the inhabitants
to assemble for any other purposes noticed in the proclamation,
it is still in operation. The only meeting that has taken place
for several years, in which questions of public or general
interest have been discussed, was that in which it was resolved,
in the year 1819, to present a petition to His Majesty, praying
for the institution of trial by jury; the permission to distil
spirits from grain, and the removal of certain other commercial
restrictions. I am not aware that any abuse has been made of the
unction under which this or other meetings have been held in New
South Wales; but I conceive that the proclamation in question
affords a very salutary restraint, not less necessary now for the
tranquillity of the colony, than it was at the period of its
first enactment.</p>
<p>The proclamation for regulating and restraining the slaughter
of cattle, was issued on the 6th June 1812. It provided, that
after the 1st July of that year, no person should keep or use any
house or place for the slaughtering of cattle, without previously
taking out a license from the magistrates of the district within
which the house was situate, and that no cattle should be killed
or slaughtered for any purpose, unless by some person duly
licensed. Six hours notice was required to be given to the
inspector, for the purpose of enabling him to take an account of
the age and marks of the cattle intended for slaughter; and in
case persons should bring them to a licensed house for that
purpose, an entry was required to be made in a book of the name
and place of abode of the owner, and the purpose for which the
cattle were intended to be slaughtered, and access to this book
was further required to he given to the inspector. Upon receiving
notice of the intention of any person to slaughter cattle, the
inspector or his servant was required to attend and to take an
account of the cattle, and make an entry of them as well as of
other particulars in his book, for which he is entitled to
receive a fee of 2<i>s</i>. from the owner of the licensed
slaughterhouse; and any person was allowed to examine this book
on payment of 1<i>s</i>.</p>
<p>It was then declared, that if any person should offer to sell
or should bring any cattle to the owner of a slaughter-house, and
should not be able, or should refuse, to give a satisfactory
account of himself, or the means by which the cattle came into
his possession, and if there should be reason to suspect that the
cattle were stolen or unlawfully obtained, a power was given to
the owner of the licensed slaughterhouse, or to the inspector and
his servants, to seize and detain such person and the cattle that
they brought with them, and to deliver them both to the custody
of a constable, who was required to take them before a
magistrate; and if the magistrate found cause to suspect that the
cattle were unlawfully obtained, he might commit the persons who
brought them to safe custody for eight days, for the purpose of
further examination, and afterwards for trial. The penalties upon
persons slaughtering without license or giving notice, or making
false entries, or neglecting to keep a book for that purpose, do
not exceed 20<i>l</i>. and are not less than 10<i>l</i>.; and in
default of payment, the magistrate is authorized to commit the
offending party to gaol, and to hard labour, for a term not
exceeding three months, nor less than one month. An exception was
made in favour of the persons employed to slaughter cattle for
government at any of the public slaughter-houses, and also in
case of severe accidents, when it might be necessary to kill them
speedily; notice, however, was required in such cases to be given
to the inspector twenty-four hours after the cattle were
slaughtered, and the hides were required to be shown to him. The
fee for the slaughtering licenses was fixed at 5<i>s</i>. and
made payable to the magistrate's clerk. In the year 1815,
Governor Macquarrie, with a view to reduce the charges for
slaughtering cattle made by the private butchers in Sydney,
caused a slaughterhouse to be erected on the shore of Cockle Bay,
near Sydney Cove, and appointed a superintendent and inspector
with a salary of 50<i>l</i>. per annum, and a certain number of
convicts under him, that are maintained by government, for the
purpose of receiving and slaughtering the cattle that are brought
from the government herds, or those of individuals, that were
intended for the supply of the government stores with meat. For
this duty the superintendent was and is allowed to charge
6<i>s</i>. sterling for each head of horned cattle, which
includes the charge for inspection; and he is not entitled to
receive any other perquisite or emolument whatever. The fees thus
received are paid to the treasurer of the police fund, and
constitute a portion of the colonial revenue.</p>

<h3>[<i>Observations on the Port Regulations</i>]</h3>
<p>The object of these regulations was the prevention and
detection of cattle stealing at a period in which the herds were
much dispersed, and little seen or visited by their owners; and
to ensure proper attention to the state and condition of the
cattle that were supplied to government. In Van Diemen's Land,
where the system of sheep stealing appears to be organized, and
to be practised as well by those that possess sheep as those that
have none, it has been found necessary to enforce these
regulations, as well as that of branding and marking the cattle
and sheep of each proprietor, with greater strictness than in New
South Wales; and as the principal meat market in both settlements
is that which is afforded by the demand of government, the
inconvenience of the regulations have not been much felt, and I
found that the necessity of continuing them was generally
acknowledged.</p>
<p>The port regulations contain several provisions that are not
known in the other colonial possessions of His Majesty, and are
not without inconvenience to strangers as well as to the
inhabitants, on their arrival and departure from the colony.</p>
<p>A great portion of these regulations had been introduced by
the predecessors of Governor Macquarrie: they were at length
reduced to a more technical form, and published by him on the 1st
of October 1810.</p>
<p>The regulations apply to the precautions that have been deemed
necessary to secure the revenue from the introduction of spirits
or goods that have not paid duty; to the introduction into the
colony of individuals that have not received the permission of
the secretary of state to land or settle in it; to the detection
of those who are about to leave it, without making proper
provision for the payment of their debts; and for the detection
and arrest of convicts whose sentences are not expired, or who,
if pardoned upon condition of remaining in the territory, may
make attempts to quit it; and finally, for the identification of
the persons of those whose sentences have expired.</p>
<p>To these are also added regulations for the prevention of the
sudden and violent seizure of vessels by the convicts in the
harbour, with directions for mooring and securing them during
their stay in it.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarrie, having found that several of these
provisions were inapplicable to the extended trade and commerce
of the colony in the year 1813, requested Mr. Judge Advocate Bent
to undertake the trouble of revising them.</p>
<p>Your Lordship has already been informed of the circumstances
that influenced Mr. Bent in declining that duty, and the port
regulations remained nearly in the state in which they were first
published by Governor Macquarrie in the year 1810, until the year
1819, when Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde, at the solicitation of
Governor Macquarrie, undertook to give them a more connected and
technical form, apprising the governor at the same time that he
declined all responsibility for the variations from the law of
England that the regulations contained.</p>
<p>Independent of the restrictions that have been before alluded
to, certain duties are imposed upon all foreign and English
vessels frequenting the port for wood and water, for the support
of the lighthouse, and for mooring and heaving down vessels by
means of chains provided by government.</p>
<p>The necessity of the regulations that more particularly apply
to the prevention of the escape of the convicts in ships, appears
to me to be greater at this moment than at former periods, and
will continue to increase with the trade of the colony, and until
the convicts shall be entirely withdrawn from those parts of it
that are frequented by merchant vessels. I have already had
occasion to state that no account or memoranda have been kept of
the escapes of convicts from the colony, and the superintendent
stated his belief that many more were successful than became
known to him. Mention of such as were notorious has been made
from time to time in the Sydney Gazette, and a document in the
Appendix contains extracts from it, and exhibits the number and
circumstances of the convicts that have escaped from the colony
from the year 1803 to 1820.</p>
<p>It appears that, in this period, two hundred and fifty-five
convicts have attempted to escape, either by concealing
themselves on board vessels, or by attempting to seize them by
violence. One hundred and ninety-four have been retaken, and nine
have died. Their usual object in making escape is to land in
India; or, in taking possession of vessels, to make their passage
to Timor or Batavia.</p>
<p>The precautions that are required on the departure of every
vessel oblige all persons who are to take their passage in them,
with the exception of the crew, to obtain certificates from the
judge advocate's office, that no detainers are lodged there
against them for debt; they are likewise to repair to the
secretary's office, where, on production of those certificates,
their names, age, and place of abode are taken down; and if it
appears that the person presenting himself has been a convict, a
reference is made to the original indentures, and subsequent
pardon that he may have received. This examination, when the
passengers are numerous, occupies a considerable time, and
affords opportunities to the sailors to make their escape from
their vessels, or to prolong their absence from them, at a period
when their services are of some importance, and when the vessel,
as has sometimes happened, has been left under the management
only of the captain. The most inconvenient part of this
regulation might be avoided if the muster of the ship's crew were
taken by the colonial secretary on board the vessel, as near as
may be convenient before the period of its actual departure. The
passengers, however, should still be required to repair to the
secretary's office, to have their names inserted in the
clearance, before the vessel weighs anchor. Ships leaving the
harbour are searched by the chief constable, and if any suspicion
exists of convicts being concealed on board, the naval officer is
empowered to cause the vessel to be smoked.</p>
<p>To prevent the convicts from joining vessels under weigh, and
until they have cleared the heads, they are required, except in
cases of necessity or of stress of weather, to proceed to sea
direct. In many cases this is not practicable; and one of the
government vessels with constables on board is generally ordered
to accompany outward-bound ships, and to remain near them until
they have cleared the harbour. Several occurrences of late date,
both in the river Derwent and at Port Jackson, have proved the
necessity of these regulations, more especially as there exists
no legislative authority by which the act of carrying away or
enticing convicts to leave the colony, or aiding in their escape,
can be punished.</p>
<p>Upon a discovery that was made of several convicts on board
the American brig General Gates, at New Zealand, by Captain
Skinner of His Majesty's store ship Dromedary, it was found that
they had been concealed for some days on the northern shore of
Port Jackson, before they were received on board the brig; and
that in the night before its departure, they contrived to conceal
themselves during the time that the constables were on board, and
until the vessel had got out to sea. Captain Skinner on
discovering at New Zealand that these men were convicts, and had
been enticed to leave New South Wales by the captain, immediately
seized the General Gates, and put her in charge of one of his own
officers, by whom she was conducted to Port Jackson.</p>
<p>Upon a consideration of the case by the judges, it was not
deemed prudent to try the captain criminally, but the obligation
into which he had entered, and by which he had bound himself not
to take away any convicts from the colony, was put in suit
against him; his vessel was detained for a considerable time, and
he was arrested and continued in gaol until a compromise was
effected. The circumstances of the case were such as required
very exemplary punishment; and the deliberation with which the
scheme had been effected by the American captain, and the
facility with which it was accomplished, prove the necessity of
some legislative enactment, by which the act of taking away or
enticing convicts (knowing them to be such), from any part of New
South Wales or Van Diemen's Land, may be declared to be a
misdemeanor, and punishable with fine and imprisonment.</p>
<p>It has been found necessary at all times at Sydney to adopt
severe measures against seamen apprehended as deserters from
their vessels, and to prevent them from being at large in the
colony, and to stimulate the apprehension of them by high
rewards. The sum of 40<i>s</i>. is divided between the chief
constable of the district and the person who apprehends a sailor
that has left his ship, and lodges him in gaol. The further sum
of 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per night, independent of incidental
expenses, is allowed by the thirty-third article of the port
regulations, and is ordered to be paid by the master of the
vessel to which the sailor belongs, to the chief constable and
the gaoler.</p>
<p>In case of the wilful absence of sailors from their vessels,
or their being found on shore at improper hours, they are liable
to be apprehended and lodged in gaol, until they are brought
before a magistrate, who in cases of disobedience or disorderly
conduct, is empowered to detain the sailor in custody, and to
order him to work at government labour until the departure of the
vessel from the port. Publicans and other persons harbouring or
enticing away sailors from their duty, are liable on conviction
to fine, imprisonment and corporal punishment.</p>
<p>From the temptations to excess, and opportunities of indulging
in it that are supplied by the town of Sydney, especially in that
part of it to which the sailors have the most direct and
immediate access on landing from the ships, many complaints are
made; and much inconvenience is felt by the masters of vessels in
the harbour. These complaints are brought before the magistrates
at Sydney, who, although conscious of their want of authority to
proceed in such cases, have frequently ordered both detention of
sailors in gaol, and punishment of them in the chain gang.</p>
<p>By the thirty-second article of the port regulations, masters
of vessels are liable to a penalty of 15<i>l</i>. for engaging or
hiring any sailor belonging to a vessel in the harbour that is
not duly discharged; but as sailors are frequently found to have
remained in the colony after the departure of their vessels, and
are afterwards apprehended and lodged in gaol, masters of vessels
who are in want of men have resorted to the gaol, where, on
payment of the fees of apprehension and subsequent detention, as
well as those or certificates of no detainer from the judge
advocate's office, by the master, the sailors have been allowed
to embark either in European or colonial vessels.</p>
<p>The frequency of piratical seizures of vessels by the convicts
in Sydney Cove, as well as the practice of smuggling spirits and
goods from vessels anchored there, induced Governor Macquarrie,
on the representation of Major Druitt the chief engineer, to
establish a row-guard for the protection of the harbour police.
The establishment consisted of two masters and two boats, with
such a number of sailors attached to them as the duty
required.</p>
<p>It was ordered, that one of the two guard boats appointed to
this service should prevent all intercourse between convict ships
in the harbour, as long as the convicts were on board, and the
shore; and should allow no boats to approach them except those
that were going with supplies from the commissariat stores, or
except they had special permission from the governor. In the
night-time the row guard was to keep watch and to prevent
smuggling, and to apprehend and detain in one of the
watch-houses, any persons who might be found violating the port
regulations. They were further to accompany all vessels departing
from Port Jackson to the outside of the heads, and not to permit
any boats to go alongside, or to suffer any persons to board
them, unless they belonged to the vessel.</p>
<p>Certain other regulations, as to the number and names of boats
plying in the harbour, were added; and it was ordered that all
such boats should be made fast with an iron chain from sun-set to
sun-rise, on pain of seizure and the owners being fined.</p>
<p>The seizures that might be made by the officers and crew of
the guard boat are ordered to be divided in the following manner:
one-third in equal proportions between the master and the crew,
and two-thirds to the police fund.</p>
<p>Such are the principal regulations by which the police of the
country and harbours in New South Wales, as well as the revenue,
is maintained. They are considered and are held to be applicable
to Van Diemen's Land, and are in force in that settlement. The
manner of granting spirit licenses there differs in some respects
from that which has prevailed at Sydney: the memorials of persons
wishing to have licenses are required to be certified by one or
more magistrates, but in case of a renewal such a recommendation
is not required.</p>
<p>On the 29th of September in each year the memorials are
presented to the lieutenant-governor, who transmits them to the
magistrates, stating that he sees no objection himself to them,
but requesting that if the magistrates are aware of any, arising
from improper conduct of the applicants in the interval, the
circumstances may be stated and the memorials returned to him. If
no objection be made the licenses are signed by the magistrates.
They are thus granted by them upon a previous sanction given by
the lieutenant-governor.</p>
<p>In Van Diemen's Land, it further appears that the practice
does not prevail of allowing the wives of convicts, or of those
who hold tickets of leave, to keep licensed houses for the sale
of spirits; and that in one instance only has it occurred that a
magistrate had any interest in the sale of spirits.</p>
<p>The number of licenses in Hobart Town granted in the year 1818
was twelve, and three were granted for the country.</p>
<p>In the succeeding years this number was augmented only by one
in Hobart Town, and it was reduced to two in the country. Mr.
Humphrey, the police magistrate, was of opinion that this number
was too large, and that if it was reduced the houses would be
more easily watched; and from the augmentation of profit that
persons of greater respectability would be found to undertake
their management, and from the fear of forfeiture would be more
circumspect in their conduct.</p>
<p>From the year 1816 to 1820 eight convictions only have taken
place for selling spirits without a license, and no instance has
occurred of any proceeding against a keeper of a public-house or
his sureties for breach of the regulations, or of good order in
his house.</p>
<p>The execution of the port regulations at Hobart Town is
attended with greater difficulties than at Sydney, on account of
the greater distance from the town to the sea, and the
opportunities that the shores afford of concealment and escape.
The precaution that has been found the most effectual is the
strict search of vessels previous to their departure, and as
strict a muster of the convicts in the employment of the
government.</p>
<p>The principal difficulties that have occurred to the
magistrates in the execution of the several orders, issued from
time to time by the successive governors of New South Wales, have
arisen from the dispersed and undigested state of the documents
in which they were published.</p>
<p>An attempt was made by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde to form a
collection of them, but he was of opinion that some of the
colonial regulations of older date had escaped his research; and
I am not aware that it was his intention to continue the labour
in which, at the governor's request, he had so meritoriously
engaged.</p>
<p>One of the first steps that I should therefore recommend,
would be that of employing some person in New South Wales to copy
and reduce into a digested form the different orders and
proclamations that have been issued, or to extract front others
such regulations as are strictly connected with matters of
police, the superintendence of the convicts, the regulations of
the police of the town of Sydney, and the rules for granting
passes to the convicts to enable them to proceed from one
district to another, as well as to Sydney. These, when copied, I
should recommend to be submitted to the magistrates individually,
and that they should be requested to deliver their written
opinions upon the necessity and expediency of continuing to
enforce the orders or of enacting others.</p>
<p>Upon being returned to the governor, they should be referred
to the attorney-general of the colony, or other law-officer, to
consider and to state in what respect the several provisions
recommended are found to differ from the principles of the laws
of England.</p>
<p>The want of some legislative authority in the governor to
enact and give effect to regulations that differ from the laws of
England, or exceed them, is one for which it is necessary to
provide. I should recommend that after the governor has taken the
written opinions of the magistrates of the colony, upon the
subject of any old or new regulation of police, a power should be
given to him, by the legislative authority of Parliament, to
issue such of them as shall have been approved by the opinions of
a majority of the magistrates. These enactments should further be
subject to the approval of His Majesty, and in case no dissent
should be signified by His Majesty's secretary of state within
two years from the date of their actual transmission, the
enactment should be considered to be approved: Your Lordship will
have observed that Governor Macquarrie has, upon several
occasions, adopted the course here recommended; and when the
principles of the regulations, past or present, shall have been
agreed upon, they should again be referred to the
attorney-general, for the purpose of being reduced into technical
but perspicuous language, and into a consistent form; they should
then be published, and care should be taken in every succeeding
proclamation that may be issued by the same authority, to refer
to any former one that is either confirmed or repealed.</p>
<p>As long as it shall be deemed expedient to retain any portion
of transported convicts in the settled districts of New South
Wales, it will be found necessary to augment rather than diminish
the present number of the magistrates.</p>
<p>I believe that it was the intention of Governor Macquarrie to
add to the number of those whose names were inserted in the
commission, that was issued previous to my departure from the
colony, and if that augmentation shall not have already taken
place, I will beg leave to name five gentlemen whom I consider as
particularly qualified for the office of magistrates and two of
them resident in districts in which their services are much
required: Oxley, the surveyor-general of the colony; Mr. James
M&lsquo;Arthur; Major Antill; Mr. Alexander Berry; and Mr.
Bouman, the principal surgeon.</p>
<p>At Sydney it must be expected that for some time to come the
duties of the magistrate of the police will be too heavy for the
casual attendance of those who are occupied with other business,
and without meaning any disrespect to the magistrates that are
now resident in Sydney, or to the individual who for some time
filled the office, I conceive that its duties require a more
undivided attention than any of them were capable or willing to
afford, and a more competent knowledge of the law and more
personal activity than any of them had acquired or possessed.</p>
<p>The salary at present attached to the situation of
superintendent of the police, and amounting to 200<i>l</i>. per
annum, would not form a sufficient inducement to a competent
person from England to undertake the duty, even with the
advantage that was to be annexed to it of a good residence in
Sydney, and office attached; both of which Governor Macquarrie
had undertaken before my departure.</p>
<p>The death of Mr. Minchin, who was appointed upon the
resignation of Mr. D'Arcy Wentworth, has deprived the colony of
services that promised to be very beneficial when assisted by
more experience. Without any knowledge of the terms upon which
Mr. Wentworth has again been appointed to the situation, I should
recommend that, in the event of his resignation or wish to retire
some person that has been connected with the duties of the police
in London, should be appointed to the situation of superintendent
of police of Sydney, with a salary amounting to 500<i>l</i>. per
annum, and the usual allowance of convicts, maintained and
clothed at the expense of the crown.</p>
<p>As there is no necessary connection between the office of the
superintendent of the police and the treasurer of the police
fund, and as it is important that the attention of the
superintendent should not be abstracted from the business of
that, department, I recommend that the office of treasurer should
either be annexed to that of the naval officer, or that a
colonial treasurer should be appointed for the receipt of all
duties, fines and penalties whatsoever, that are not payable to
the informers.</p>
<p>The regulations and forms that have been introduced into the
office of Mr. Humphrey, the police magistrate of Hobart Town, may
be adopted with great benefit at Sydney; and the magistrates in
the country districts should be enjoined to adopt similar forms
in the official documents that they issue, and especially in the
passes that are given to the convicts when permitted to remove
from one district to another. As it has been recommended in my
former Report, that a power should be given to the magistrates of
the colony to extend the punishment of convicts for offences
committed in it, beyond the term of their original sentences, the
concurrence of three magistrates should be required to make such
sentences valid. I further recommend that not less than three
magistrates should be required to give validity to any sentence,
by which a convict is ordered to receive more than fifty lashes,
or to be transported from the settled districts to the new
settlements for a longer term than one year. The evidence upon
which the sentences are founded should be entered carefully in
the record book of the proceedings of each bench of magistrates,
and should be signed by them at the end of every month.</p>
<p>A return of all punishments inflicted, and penalties or fines
levied by order of one or more magistrates, should be matte with
regularity every quarter to the governor, distinguishing the name
of each person, the date of the sentence, the names of the
magistrates by whom it was ordered; and more especially the
description of the convict, whether transported for seven, for
fourteen years, or for life. I have already stated, that these
particulars ought always to accompany the returns of the offences
tried and Punished by the Criminal Court, that are made to the
governor and transmitted to your Lordship; and by requiring a
yearly abstract to be made from the quarterly returns of the
magistrates, of the number and nature of offences committed in
the different districts of the colony, with the particulars above
enumerated, and classing them under the different districts from
which each return is made, an opportunity will thus be afforded
of ascertaining the moral condition of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>By gradually withdrawing from the settled districts those
convicts that are incapable of rendering any useful service to
the settlers, and by not reserving a greater number for the use
of government than can be conveniently lodged in the different
barracks at Sydney, Paramatta, or Windsor, there is reason to
conclude that the magisterial business in the settled districts
will be considerably diminished. In the town of Sydney this
change will not so soon be experienced; but upon the appointment
of a new superintendent of police, it appears to me that the
office of assistant superintendent will be no longer
required.</p>
<p>The assistance of two efficient clerks will be required at
Sydney, for the daily business of the office of superintendent of
police, as well as for the proceedings before the
magistrates.</p>
<p>One clerk will also be required at Paramatta, Windsor, and
Liverpool. Clerks have been allowed to the magistrates that have
lately met to transact business in the districts of Evan and
Minto; and in situations retired as these are, there is less
objection to the employment of convicts who have been accustomed
to clerical occupations.</p>
<p>The fees that have been received by the clerks for summonses,
bail bonds, warrants, depositions, and executions, together with
an allowance of rations from the King's store, have constituted
the remuneration for their clerical assistance and attendance.
One item in the schedule of these fees will admit of reduction
from 10<i>s</i>. to 5<i>s</i>. in bail bonds, the whole of which
should be paid to the magistrate's clerk instead of being divided
with the gaoler.</p>
<p>To produce greater uniformity in the proceedings, I recommend
that as many documents as are capable of being reduced to form
should be printed, and not copied by the clerks; and that all
orders for the punishment of the convicts, and all commitments,
should be signed by the magistrates themselves and not by their
clerks.</p>
<p>These persons should likewise be strictly prohibited from
giving copies of any proceedings before the magistrates without
their order. Sufficient publicity is afforded to every thing that
passes before them; and much harm has been done by the practice
that has long prevailed, of allowing copies of proceedings and
informations to be given by the clerks to individuals who apply
for them, on payment of the fee of 1<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. per
folio, that is allowed in the schedule.</p>
<p>It has been the practice to remunerate this class of
functionaries, by assigning them rations on the store for their
families and children, and a considerable portion of the expense
of the police establishment has been thrown on the British
treasury, that ought unquestionably to have been defrayed by the
colonial funds. To all the clerks of this description, therefore,
that are free, an addition of 20<i>l</i>. per annum may be made
in lieu of rations; but to the convicts who are allowed by way of
indulgence to act as clerks, rations must still be continued,
together with an allowance of soap; and I should recommend that
the fees that they are permitted to receive should be placed
under the control of the magistrates, that a certain sum should
be appropriated under their direction to the purchase of decent
clothing, in which these convicts should be required to appear
when acting in their clerical capacity.</p>
<p>Having submitted to your Lordship the result of the several
accounts of the fines and penalties that have been levied by the
magistrates in the districts, and having observed that some
benefit was derived from the discretionary application that had
been made of the local funds so collected in their hands, I have
seen no reason to disapprove of the appropriation that has
hitherto been made by the magistrates; and in more than one
instance at Windsor, I observed that a portion of the local funds
had been applied to the purchase of articles that ought to have
been defrayed by those of the colony.</p>
<p>The magistrates might be further authorized to apply those
funds in the remuneration of constables, for activity in the
apprehension and pursuit of offenders, and in reimbursing poor
persons for the expense of attendance in courts upon criminal
prosecutions.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I am disposed to recommend that the same
system should be continued; and that at the end of every year
copies of the accounts, signed by the magistrates acting in each
district, and setting forth the nature of the fines levied and
their appropriation, should be submitted to the judge of the
Supreme and Criminal Court, and when examined and approved by him
should be transmitted to the governor.</p>
<p>The annual salaries of the officers employed in the police
establishments in New South Wales, including the salary of the
superintendent, appears by the statement abstracted from the
accounts of the police fund, to amount to the sum of
2,382<i>l</i>. 7<i>s</i>.; included in this amount, is the
payment to the petty constables that I recommended to be made, in
lieu of the extra half ration of meat and flour, in the year
1820. The rations allowed to the magistrates and their government
men, as well as to the constables, clerks and gaolers in New
South Wales, consisting of seven pounds of flour and seven pounds
of meat per week, calculated at the rate of 1<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>.
for the former, and 2<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>. for the latter, create
an annual charge of 12<i>l</i>. 2<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for each
ration, and a total charge or 3,154<i>l</i>. 23s. 4<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>The confusion that is produced in the commissariat accounts,
by the variations in the allowances to constables and others,
make it very desirable that as far as possible the same ration,
amounting to seven pounds of meat and seven pounds of dour,
should be issued to all functionaries of every description that
are victualled from the King's store; and that any increase of
remuneration, to which from the nature of their services these
individuals may be considered entitled in addition to the ration,
should be made in salaries or allowances from the police fund. I
conceive that this alteration will be attended with the
advantages of simplifying the commissariat accounts; of reducing
the expenditure of meat; of transferring a portion of the charge
of police establishment from the British treasury to the colonial
fund, and producing a greater degree of circumspection in the
constables, from the fear of forfeiting by their misconduct that
portion of their remuneration which consists of a regular
salary.</p>
<p>The allowance of rations to the families of constables has
been made in cases where married men of good character were
appointed, and when it was of importance to secure their
services.</p>
<p>I think that in conformity to the principles already laid
down, a money payment from the police fund, calculated according
to the value that is allowed to women and children victualled
from the store, would be preferable to the present issue of
rations.</p>
<p>The office of chief constable is one that is of the greatest
importance to the police of the colony, and I should recommend
that the utmost attention should be paid to the selection of
these individuals; and that in the two districts of Paramatta and
Windsor, a horse should be allowed for the use of the chief
constable; and that on the evenings preceding and following every
market day at Sydney, one or more of the constables should be
ordered to parole the road from Paramatta to Sydney, and from
Paramatta to Windsor, and deviating occasionally from thence to
the Liverpool road. The constables should be selected for this
duty by the chief constables, and there should be no rotation of
duty or appointment. These patroles should be armed with pistols
and sabres.</p>
<p>A very important part of the duty of the chief constable, is
that of keeping a correct list of the convicts assigned to
settlers, and the changes that take place in them; and the
superintendent of convicts at each station should be enjoined to
communicate to the chief constables the removals and changes that
take place in the convicts under their charge.</p>
<p>The chief constables might be advantageously employed in
giving occasional attendance at the Sunday musters of the
convicts in the different places in winch they are held by the
district constables, and affording assistance and information to
the magistrates in discovering defaulters. The returns of these
musters would be much facilitated by requiring them to be made in
printed forms, in which the name of every convict, and the ship
in which he came into the country, should be distinguished; a
column being also left for remarks upon their conduct and
appearance.</p>
<p>The state of the gaols in the colony of New South Wales and
Van Diemen's Land has been airway stated as one of the various
causes by which the efficiency of the police of the colony has
been impaired.</p>
<p>The Sydney gaol is situated in one of the principal streets,
called George-street, and upon the declivity of a rugged and
rocky hill that overlooks the harbour of Sydney Cove. The
entrance from the street is through a court yard ninety-seven
feet by thirty-four, in which there are two small lodges, one for
the gaoler's office and the other for the confinement of
misdemeanants. On one side of the court yard is a place of
deposit for wood and coals, and a house for the under gaoler; and
at the other is a separate court yard seventy-one feet by twenty,
with a wooden building at the upper end, containing two small
rooms for the separate confinement of female prisoners; the
principal building stands upon a raised terrace, to which there
is a steep and inconvenient stone stair-case, and it is divided
by a passage of ten feet into two apartments, that measure
thirty-two feet by twenty-two.</p>
<p>In these rooms there are fireplace c, and raised wooden
platforms upon which the prisoners sleep. There are sometimes not
less than sixty prisoners confined in these two rooms, consisting
of all descriptions; convicts for trial, witnesses convicts under
sentence of transportation to the Coal River, free people, and
frequently sailors sentenced by the magistrates to work in the
chain gang, or to confinement in the gaol.</p>
<p>The walls in these rooms, as well as the wooden platforms and
the floors, have been much damaged, although they have been
frequently repaired; and during several visits that I made to the
gaol, I found the convicts confined there generally gambling or
quarrelling with each other. The yard behind the gaol is one
hundred and sixty-five feet in length by seventy nine in breadth,
is well flagged, and contains a pump that affords a supply of
water; at the upper end is the building that is appropriated to
the debtors, containing two rooms, one of which is twenty-eight
feet by twelve, and divided into two bed rooms, and the other is
twenty-eight by seventeen; on the same side, and in front of the
yard, two rooms have been lately appropriated for the women, each
twenty-seven feet by eighteen, and in which two fireplaces have
been constructed. In front of these rooms is a yard of
seventy-one feet in length by twenty feet, separated by a stone
wall from the principal yard, and communicating with it by one
door. At the end of the same yard is the gaol gang room,
measuring twenty-five feet by twenty-two, and a yard adjoining
that measures one hundred and five feet by seventy-nine. They
communicate with a back street by a separate door, to prevent a
frequent disturbance of the other parts of the gaol by the chain
gang on their return from work. There are three cells at each end
of the principal building, for the confinement of prisoners under
sentence of death, or condemned to solitary confinement.</p>
<p>The Sydney gaol has been repaired and enlarged at several
periods, and the expense incurred from the year 1812 to 1819, as
collected from the accounts of the police fund, amounts to
5,239<i>l</i>. 6<i>s</i>. 7&frac12;<i>d</i>. The last addition
that was made of the buildings for the debtors and female
prisoners, has afforded them a partial separation from the
prisoners confined in the principal buildings; but as their
number has much increased, they were allowed to have the use of
the debtors yard during the clay, to which the only access is
through the gaol. The friends of the debtors and their supplies
of food were introduced in the same way, and afforded the means
of conveying spirits and other indulgences to the prisoners. The
under gaoler was in the habit of selling tea and sugar and
tobacco to the debtors and the prisoners, and I observed that one
of the debtors was engaged in the same occupation. The gaol
allowance to the prisoners consists of one pound of bread per
day, supplied by contract with one of the bakers in Sydney, who
receives the ration of flour from the King's store, and returns
one pound of bread for the use of each prisoner.</p>
<p>The defects of the gaol consist of want of space and
accommodation for the prisoners, and a separation of those who
are detained as witnesses from those who have been already
convicted. It rarely occurs that any conviction takes place in
the Criminal Court without the evidence of an accomplice, and in
such cases it is of the greatest importance, both to prevent
communication between the witnesses and the prisoners before
trial, as well as to secure them from the effects of intimidation
and violence.</p>
<p>The superintendence of the Sydney gaol is at present in the
hands of a person who for several years was chief constable. He
was considered to be respectable in character, but from his age
and want of personal activity, he is not competent to the
increasing duties of the establishment. One of these duties
consists in preparing and transmitting to the colonial secretary,
a return of the sentences passed by the magistrates in Sydney, or
in the different districts. These sentences are signed and
transmitted by the magistrates, and the particulars of the
original sentences of the convicts are obtained by inquiry from
themselves.</p>
<p>The detention of these convicts in the Sydney gaol does not
generally exceed four or five days, as the communications by
government vessels between Sydney and the Coal River are
frequent. When the number does not exceed five or six, they are
sent without a guard; but prisoners sentenced by the Criminal
Court are sometimes detained for ten days in gaol, and are.
generally attended by a military guard.</p>
<p>The present gaoler has long had a contract for supplying the
gaol with firing: For the sum of 150<i>l</i>. per annum, he
engaged to supply sixty tons of coals from Newcastle, which from
being owner of a small trading vessel he was enabled to do.</p>
<p>After the loss of his vessel he supplied the gaol with wood,
which has of late become scarce and dear.</p>
<p>The gaoler at Hobart Town had a contract of a similar kind;
but there appeared to be no reason whatever that this expense
should be incurred at Sydney, as the supply of coals from the
clock yard there was always adequate for this purpose, and was at
a very little distance from the gaol. At Hobart Town, perhaps,
the necessity of the contract was greater, on account of the
scarcity of wood, and the expense of conveying coals from Sydney;
but I should recommend that at Hobart Town the contract should be
opened to the public, and that no further allowance should be
made to the gaoler of men victualled from the store.</p>
<p>I observed that the consumption of wood both in the gaol at
Sydney and Hobart Town was very considerable, and that at the
former place the walls were much affected by the smoke.</p>
<p>There is no kind of employment for the prisoners in any of the
gaols in New South Wales, nor indeed would their present
dimensions admit of any.</p>
<p>The most severe and perhaps the only punishment that can be
inflicted upon the prisoners is solitary confinement, and the
dimensions and situation of the Sydney gaol preclude any
extensive arrangement of that nature. It was under this
impression that I recommended to Governor Macquarrie to build a
new of at Sydney; and it iv only from an apprehension that the
colonial architect would pursue in this instance the same system
of imperfect planning, and expensive and difficult execution,
that I have already had occasion to notice, that I forbore to
press the subject of the new gaol on the attention of the
governor, before my departure from the colony.</p>
<p>The gaol at Paramatta is old and very ill-built; part of the
wall of the outer court gave way during my residence in the
colony, and four prisoners escaped through the grating of one of
the privies.</p>
<p>The building is of stone, and is situated on an open space of
ground near the public road, that leads from Paramatta to
Windsor, just at the entrance of the former.</p>
<p>The principal building consists of two rooms for the men, one
measuring seventeen feet by thirteen, and a dark cell that is
used as a store-room for tools and fetters; and the other called
the charge-room, that measures twenty-one feet by twenty-six. In
this room there is a fire-place, and a small platform for the
prisoners much broken. The floor likewise was in a very decayed
state, and appeared to have suffered, as well as the
window-shutters and gratings, from the wanton mischief of the
prisoners.</p>
<p>At one end of the prison two small rooms have been added for
debtors, or for women confined by order of the Criminal Court;
but there is no separation of these rooms from the principal
court yard.</p>
<p>At the other end three solitary cells have been constructed,
that are entirely separated from the other parts of the gaol, and
have a spacious yard adjoining.</p>
<p>On the side that is opposite to the entrance and to the
gaoler's lodge is the gaol gang room, measuring thirty feet by
fifteen, where there is a fireplace at which, the prisoners cook
their daily rations.</p>
<p>The situation and contiguity of the female factory has already
been noticed, and when it is removed considerable accommodation
will be afforded to the prisoners in the Paramatta gaol. It was
in the contemplation of Governor Macquarrie to convert the whole
building into a lunatic asylum, which was much wanted, and to
build a new gaol with better accommodation and stronger
walls.</p>
<p>At Windsor a gaol was erected by contract by Mr. Cox, the
magistrate of the district, in; and the cost, amounting to
1,439<i>l</i>. was paid from the police fund. The principal
building is of brick, and has lately been inclosed by a wall that
appeared to be very slight, and not sufficiently high.</p>
<p>The gaol contains two rooms in front for the accommodation of
the male prisoners, and one at the end for debtors and female
prisoners. There are also four cells for solitary confinement,
with separate yards; and in a small building behind the gaol,
there is a room for the temporary custody of persons apprehended
in the town at night. The gaoler's house and kitchen are within
the wall that incloses the gaol, and a kitchen and mess-room have
been erected for the separate use of the gaol gang.</p>
<p>The yard in which these buildings stand is too small either
for the present size of the gaol, or its future enlargement, a
circumstance that should always be kept in view in constructing a
gaol, or indeed any other building, in the colony of New South
Wales.</p>
<p>The gaol at Liverpool was built by contract by Mr. Moore, the
resident magistrate of that district. It is placed at the corner
of two streets, and consists of two rooms twenty-nine feet in
length, separated by a narrow passage. It is intended to add
three solitary cells to each end of the building; but a great
error has been committed in placing the gaol so near the
principal street or road that runs through the town of Liverpool,
that the wall with which it is intended to surround the gaol must
necessarily obstruct the ventilation.</p>
<p>The gaol at Hobart Town was finished in the year 1815. It is
placed in an elevated and airy part of the town, and has more the
appearance and the accommodation of an hospital, than a place of
coercion and confinement. The gaol contains an entrance that is
fifteen feet in length by twelve in breadth; two rooms for the
gaoler, measuring fifteen feet by eight; two rooms for debtors,
sixteen feet by fifteen; a lock-up room, twelve feet by ten; and
two turnkeys rooms. These are separated from the rooms for
felons, of which there are two and each measuring twenty-six feet
by fourteen. A separate apartment is provided for the women on
the first floor, thirteen feet by ten; there are two light and
two dark cells in the yard, measuring six feet by five.</p>
<p>A more effectual separation is thus made of the different
prisoners in this gaol, than in the other gaols of New South
Wales; but the rooms are neither sufficiently large or numerous
for the prisoners that are confined in them. The workmanship and
materials of which the gaol is built are very slight, and the
wall that surrounds the gaol is twelve feet in height above the
foundations. It was built by contract by Mr. Birch, a merchant of
Hobart Town, for the sum of 820<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>Some very excellent regulations for the gaol at Hobart Town,
were drawn up by Lieutenant-Governor Sorell, and the
superintendent of police, Mr. Humphrey, and are signed by the
magistrates at Hobart Town.</p>
<p>A book is directed to be kept by the gaoler, containing the
particulars of all commitments, discharges and removals; and a
book in which the visiting magistrate is to enter his remarks on
the state of the gaol, and period of visiting.</p>
<p>Particular directions are given for the separate confinement
of the different classes of prisoners in different rooms, and the
female prisoners are employed in washing for the debtors and
other prisoners, and in preserving cleanliness in the different
apartments. No spirits are allowed to be brought into the gaol;
but from a circumstance that came within my own observation, I do
not think this regulation is strictly observed.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, the state of the Fa, at Hobart Town vas
creditable to the magistrates; but the increasing population of
the settlement already requires a building of greater extent and
strength.</p>
<p>The gaoler, William Peitchey, was formerly a convict. He has
lately purchased an estate between Hobart Town and Pitt Water,
and has built several Reuses near the gaol. I observed that these
occupations consumed a considerable portion of his time, and that
the custody of the gaol was transferred to the constables.</p>
<p>In the month of February 1820, the police establishment of
Hobart Town consisted of Mr. Humphrey the magistrate, one chief
constable, and two constables of the northern and southern
districts of the county of Buckinghamshire. Four constables were
specially appointed to execute processes and apprehend runaway
convicts in the interior; and forty-four were appointed for town
duty. Of these, four are employed as constables of the night;
three as constables in ordinary at each watchhouse, to be in
readiness in case of emergency; and three at the store for
bonding spirits; one on duty at the police office; two at the
gaol. Four constables are frequently employed every night to
prevent smuggling from the vessels in the harbour. It appears
also, that twenty-one constables are on duty every night in
Hobart Town. Their remuneration consists of fourteen pounds of
meat and fourteen pounds of wheat, and one pint of rum per week,
which, with the value of their clothing, shoes and bedding,
creates an annual charge of 43<i>l</i>. 11<i>s</i>.
8<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>The issue of clothing at Hobart Town had fallen into arrear,
nearly as much as in New South Wales; but as the police fund of
Van Diemen's Land is now much augmented, the same reasons exist
for adopting the principle of remuneration that I have proposed
to apply to the police establishment of New South Wales, in
substituting money payments for all remuneration that exceeds the
single weekly ration of seven pounds of wheat and seven pounds of
flour to each person, and continuing the allowance of
clothing.</p>
<p>Reverting to the state of the gaols in New South Wales, I
conceive that it will be very desirable that the regulations to
which I have alluded at Hobart Town, should be introduced into
the former for the guidance of the gaolers; and that the
magistrates should be enjoined to visit in rotation the gaols at
Sydney, Paramatta, Windsor and Liverpool; to make a report once
in every month to the judge of the Supreme and Criminal Court,
and to enter in a book to be kept in the gaols minutes of their
observations.</p>
<p>The alterations and amendments that have appeared to me
advisable in the port regulations, I intend to submit to your
Lordship in a separate form but I think it necessary to state in
this place, that great inconvenience has been felt in New South
Wales, from want of jurisdiction to try offences committed on the
high seas. By the 57 Geo. III. c. 53, amended by the 59 Geo. III.
c. 44, as far as relates to Honduras, a power was given to try
all murders, manslaughters, rapes, robberies and burglaries,
committed in the islands of New Zealand and Otaheite, or within
any islands or countries not within His Majesty's dominions, nor
subject to any European power, nor within the territories of the
United States, by the master or crews of any British ship or
vessel, or by any person sailing or belonging thereto; and the
Act further directs, that such offences shall be sued and
punished in any of His Majesty's islands colonies, forts or
factories, under His Majesty's commission issued or to be issue
wider the Act of the 46 Geo. III. c. 64. The magistrates at
Sydney to whom the investigation of these offences has been
frequently referred by the governor, either upon charges of
cruelty of the masters and crews of the vessels towards the
inhabitants of the South Sea Islands, or of robbery and
ill-treatment committed by the mates and sailors of convict ships
upon the persons and property of convicts during the passage,
have found themselves disabled from any further proceeding than
that of referring the result of their examinations to the
governor. It is highly expedient, therefore, that for the purpose
of checking the outrages committed at sea, either by convicts or
others, a commission should issue conformably to the terms of the
46 Geo. III. c. 64.</p>
<p>I have thus endeavoured to submit to your Lordship's
consideration the various regulations of police that are
considered to be in force in New South Wales, and which, in their
operation, have appeared to carry with them the most direct
interference with the rights of property or personal liberty.</p>
<p>Considering the present state of the population, both of New
South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, I do not conceive it to be
expedient that any of those that I have pointed out should be
relaxed. The operation of some of them, more especially the port
regulations, may be modified; but as long as New South Wales and
Van Diemen's Land contain so great a number of convicts, either
suffering under their sentences, or subject to the terms of a
conditional remission, most of the regulations to which I have
alluded, and especially those that provide for the security and
detention of convicts, and the identification of their persons,
must continue to be strictly and unremittingly observed.</p>
<p>It is further to be desired that the vigilance of the police
officers, in the suppression and punishment of drunkenness, in
the control of the public-houses, should continue to be
stimulated by high rewards; that the licensed public-houses
should be gradually reduced to the number granted in the year
1820; that the securities taken for the good behaviour of the
persons licensed should be real and not fictitious; and that no
magistrate who possesses a direct interest in the sale of
spirits, or who is the owner of any house licensed for the sale
of them, should be continued in the commission of the peace.</p>
<p>In the observations that I have addressed to your Lordship on
this as well as other subjects in my former and present Report, I
am aware that I have been compelled to touch upon points
affecting the personal character of individuals in the colony, as
well as others who, though no longer resident in it, have been
officially connected with it. Upon reference to my instructions,
and upon complying with that part of them which required
information respecting the conduct of individuals, I felt it
impossible to avoid the incidental mention of their names, or the
share they took in transactions that have had and still hold
considerable influence on the state of society in the colony, or
the feelings of its inhabitants. In the performance of this duty,
I can conscientiously declare that I have never deviated from the
course that my instructions prescribed, and that I never
voluntarily sought for topics of inculpation or censure. Some of
those upon which I have remarked had occurred in periods
antecedent to my commission of inquiry, but I found that upon
some points the information that had reached your Lordship had
not always been correct; and it was with a view to place them in
that which appeared to me to be their true light, and to guard
against the possible evils of wrong impressions, that I have on
more than one occasion referred to transactions that had long
since passed, and that even in the colony were falling into
oblivion. I am well aware, and it is a subject of regret to me
that by the discharge of this part of my duty the remembrance of
them may have been revived, and that they may have been
accompanied by observations that must have given rain to the
feelings of many individuals. I likewise take this opportunity of
expressing my concern, that, in the course of my first Report, I
should have attributed to Mr. W. Wentworth the composition of an
anonymous and scurrilous poem, since, whether he was the author
of that poem or not, (and it is distinctly understood that on
this point he makes neither avowal nor denial,) I feel that I was
not justified in introducing his name into my Report; first,
because in my capacity of commissioner of inquiry into the state
of New South Wales, it was not competent to me to investigate any
cart of his conduct; and secondly, because his name was coupled
with an admission to his prejudice that was made by another
person in his absence, and without his authority, and by which
therefore he cannot be concluded.</p>

<p align="right">Downing Street, 30th January, 1819.   </p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>The Prince Regent, having had under his consideration the
actual Circumstances of the Colony under your Government, more
particularly with a view of ascertaining how far in its present
improved and increasing State, it is susceptible of being made
adequate to the Objects of its original Institution, has been
pleased to direct that a special Commissioner <a href="#note-001"
name="noteref-001" id="noteref-001">{1}</a> should proceed to New
South Wales, and should there conduct the enquiries necessary to
this important Object.</p>
<p>The Gentleman selected for this Duty is Mr. John Thomas Bigge,
<a href="#note-002" name="noteref-002" id="noteref-002">{2}</a>
who has for many years filled a high Judicial Situation in one of
His Majesty's Colonies with the Entire Approbation of His Royal
Highness The Prince Regent.</p>
<p>In order to explain to you more distinctly the Objects of his
Appointment, I have the Honor to enclose a Copy of the
Commission, and of the Instructions with which he has been
furnished.</p>
<p>As it may be necessary for him in the course of his Enquiry to
have the Power of Administering an Oath to the Persons, whose
Testimony he may require, it is the Pleasure of His Royal
Highness that you should immediately on his arrival in the Colony
appoint him a Justice of the Peace and Magistrate for the
Territory; you will further give him every Facility of Access to
Official Documents, and every other Assistance in your power in
the prosecution of the Objects of his Commission.</p>
<p>During the interval, which has elapsed between Mr. Bigge's
Appointment and his Departure for the Colony, he had free access
to all the Correspondence connected with the Colony, and has been
put perfectly in possession of the views of His Majesty's
Government; His Royal Highness has therefore been pleased to
instruct Mr. Bigge to recommend to your immediate Adoption any
Alteration or Improvement of the System at present in force in
the Colony, which he may consider necessary either for the Remedy
of existing Evils, or for the prevention of Causes of Complaint
in future, and I have only to desire that you would give to his
recommendations in this particular the weight due to them by an
early, if not an immediate, adoption of them. Should however any
case occur, in which you may deem it adviseable to take upon
yourself the heavy responsibility of declining to adopt his
suggestions, you will communicate to me without delay the reasons
of your Refusal for the special consideration and Decision of His
Royal Highness.</p>

<p align="center"><b>EARL BATHURST TO MR. COMMISSIONER BIGGE.
[1]</b></p>
<p align="right">Downing Street, 6th January, 1819.   </p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>As the time is now approaching for your Departure for New
South Wales in the execution of the Duty to which His Royal
Highness The Prince Regent has been pleased to appoint you, it
becomes my Duty to direct your attention to those points which
will, on your arrival in the Colony, form the leading Object of
your Enquiry.</p>
<p>You are aware of the causes which first led to the Formation
of the Settlements in New Holland. As they were peculiar in
themselves, these Settlements cannot be administered with the
usual Reference to those general Principles of Colonial Policy,
which are applicable to other Foreign Possessions of His Majesty,
Not having been established with any view to Territorial or
Commercial Advantages, they must chiefly be considered as
Receptacles for Offenders, in which Crimes may be executed at a
distance from home by punishments sufficiently severe to deter
others from the Commission of Crimes, and so regulate, as to
operate the Reform of the Persons by whom they had been
committed. So long as they continue destined by the Legislature
of the Country to these purposes, their Growth as Colonies must
be a Secondary Consideration, and the leading Duty of those, to
whom their Administration is entrusted, will be to keep up in
them such a system of just discipline, as may render
Transportation an Object of serious Apprehension. While the
Settlements were in their Infancy, the Regulations, to which
Convicts were subjected on their arrival, were sufficiently
severe, and were moreover capable of being strictly and uniformly
enforced. Hard Labour, moderate Food, and constant
Superintendance were, and (what was at least of as much
Importance) were believed in this Country to be the inevitable
consequences of a Sentence of Transportation, varying only as to
the period during which they were enforced, either according to
the original Sentences of the Convicts or to the Evidence, which
their Conduct in the Settlement afforded of their Progress
towards Amendment and Reform. At this time it appears that
Transportation to New South Wales answered every end of
Punishment; For while it operated, not very severely though
always beneficially, on the Convicts themselves, the opinion of
its severity in this Country was so enhanced by the distance of
the Settlement and the little which was known of it, that it was
an object here of peculiar Apprehension. <a href="#note-003"
name="noteref-003" id="noteref-003">{3}</a> There are instances
on record, in which Convicts have expressed their desire that the
Sentence of Transportation might be commuted even for the utmost
Rigour of the Law, and it is not too much to assert that the
Punishment did then materially contribute to prevent the
Commission of those Crimes to which it was at that time more
particularly confined.</p>
<p>Many Circumstances however have since concurred to render the
Punishment lighter in itself, to diminish the Apprehension
entertained in this Country of its Severity, and to break down
all proportion between the punishment and the Crimes for which it
is now inflicted.</p>
<p>You will find these circumstances detailed in my Letter
<a href="#note-004" name="noteref-004" id="noteref-004">{4}</a>
to Lord Sidmouth, in which I first suggested the expediency of
this Commission. Every Information which I have since received,
and every consideration which I have since given to the subject,
confirms me in the conviction that an Investigation is become
necessary. Since the writing of that Letter, Intelligence has
been received of the arrival of that large body of Convicts,
which I then noticed to be under Sentence of Transportation, and
the number, on whom this Sentence has since been passed, has
considerably increased. In addition to which, a Great proportion
is for Offences of that Magnitude in Moral Depravity, or of such
serious Mischief to Society, as have been generally expiated by
the utmost Rigour of the Law. While Transportation to New South
Wales is thus applied as an adequate Punishment for the most
Heinous Crimes, it unfortunately at the same time carries with it
in Public Estimation so little of Apprehension in any proportion
to the Guilt of the Convicts, that numerous applications are made
from those who are sentenced to Imprisonment for Minor
Transgressions that they may be allowed to participate in the
Punishment to which the greatest Offenders are condemned.</p>
<p>Such being the actual State of Things, it appears to The
Prince Regent most important that the first Object of your
Enquiry should be to ascertain whether any and what Alteration in
the existing system of the Colony can render it available to the
purpose of its original Institution, and adequate for its more
extended application. With a view to this you will examine how
far it may be possible to enforce in the Colonies already
established, a System of General Discipline, Constant Work, and
Vigilant Superintendance. The Latter must necessarily be
understood to comprise complete separation from the Mass of the
Population, and more or less of personal Confinement, according
to the Magnitude of the Offence. You will therefore pay
particular Attention to the possibility of providing Buildings
proper to the Reception of all the Convicts, the want of such
Buildings having been frequently and justly represented by the
Governor as one main Obstacle to the Enforcement of Discipline.
Should it appear to you, as I have too much reason to apprehend
will be the Result, that the present Settlements are not capable
of undergoing any efficient Change, the next Object for your
Consideration will be the expediency of abandoning them
altogether as Receptacles for Convicts, and forming on other
parts of the Coasts, or in the Interior of the Country, distinct
Establishments exclusively for the Reception and proper
Employment of the Convicts who may hereafter be sent out. From
such a Measure, it is obvious that many Advantages must result.
It would effectually separate the Convict from the Free
Population; the Labour of forming a New Settlement would afford
constant means of Employment and that of a severer Description.
By forming more than one of such separate Establishments, the
means of classifying the Offenders, according to the Degrees of
Crime, would be facilitated, and that salutary Apprehension of
the punishment revived, which can alone make it available to the
grave Offences to which it is at present applied. But on the
other hand you will have to consider, what would in the first
instance be the expence of the measures, which you might think
yourself justified in recommending, and what may be the probable
Amount of Annual Charge, which may result from their Adoption. I
need not impress upon you the necessity of making your Estimates
as accurate as circumstances will admit, for it will be obvious
to you that in order to enable His Majesty's Government to decide
whether it is adviseable to continue, or to alter, or to abandon
the System, which for near Forty Years has been pursued, it will
be most material for them to know, not only the means by which
Transportation can be rendered an effectual Punishment for the
Prevention of Crime, but also the Expence at which, as compared
with other Systems of Punishment, it can be enforced.</p>
<p>I have only in conclusion to desire that you will in the whole
course of your enquiries constantly bear in mind that
Transportation to New South Wales is intended as a severe
Punishment applied to various Crimes, and as such must be
rendered an Object of real Terror to all Classes of the
Community. You must be aware that it is taking but an imperfect
view of the end of Punishment, if you look only to the state of
those on whom it is inflicted. The Great End of Punishment is the
Prevention of Crime, and as there are gradations in Crimes,
against the Commission of which the Legislature is bound to guard
in proportion to their moral Turpitude or to the injurious
Effects which, either necessarily in themselves or from the
Circumstances under which they were practised, they may have on
the Community, the sufferings of those, to whom punishment is
awarded, do not answer the purpose for which they were inflicted,
unless they are in some degree proportioned to the Offences
committed, and of a Character to deter others from Similar
Misdeeds. Transportation must not be considered like imprisonment
in Gaol applicable to the suspected and unfortunate in common
with the criminal, but it operates exclusively on convicted
Guilt, and that too as a part (not the most effectual part) of
the punishment assigned to it. For mere Expatriation is not in
these days an Object of considerable Terror. The Intercourse,
which it breaks, is readily reestablished, and the Mystery, which
used to hang over the Fate of those condemned to it, can never
long exist. It is the Situation of the Convicts in the place to
which they shall have been consigned, the strict Discipline, the
unremitting Labour, the severe but wholesome privations to which
they are condemned; It is their sad Estrangement from the sweets
and comforts of a Life, which their Guilt has forfeited, and the
Mercy of His Majesty has spared, and above all the strong feeling
impressed upon this Country that such is the unavoidable Fate of
the unhappy Men, on whom the Sentence has passed, that can alone
make Transportation permanently formidable. If therefore, by ill
considered Compassion for Convicts, or from what might under
other circumstances be considered a laudable desire to lessen
their sufferings, their Situation in New South Wales be divested
of all Salutary Terror, Transportation cannot operate as an
effectual example on the Community at large, and as a proper
punishment for those Crimes against the Commission of which His
Majesty's Subjects have a right to claim protection, nor as an
adequate Commutation for the utmost Rigour of the Law.</p>

<p align="right">Downing Street, 6th January, 1819.   </p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>In the course of the enquiries, which you are authorized under
your Commission to institute in New South Wales, the conduct of
the several persons in authority in that Colony will necessarily
come under your particular Review, and as you are aware, from the
free access which you have had to the correspondence of this
Department, of the Grounds on which the Conduct of many of the
Servants in that Colony has been subjected to accusation, you
will not fail to enquire how far the reports, which have from
different quarters reached His Majesty's Government, are
deserving of Consideration. But although I am to desire that you
do not permit your respect for any Individual, however exalted in
rank or sacred in Character, to check an Investigation of his
Conduct, in cases in which you deem it to be necessary, yet I am
equally to impress upon you the necessity of not divulging in the
Colony the opinion, which you may ultimately form as to the
justice of the original suspicion. The Result of your
Investigation, and the Evidence by which it is to be supported,
is to be communicated to His Majesty's Government alone, and,
although it will be your Duty to furnish them with the most ample
details, it will be no less incumbent upon you to prevent any
disclosure in the Colony, which could only have the Effect of
inflaming existing Resentments and disturbing the Tranquillity of
the Colony, during the Interval which must elapse between your
departure from the Settlements and the final Decision of His
Majesty's Government.</p>
<p>Should however the result of your enquiries, either on this or
any other subject, lead you to entertain an opinion that the
system, which has been pursued in any Department, is either so
bad in itself or so liable to Abuse as to render an immediate
Alteration desireable, you will consider yourself authorized to
express to the Governor in writing the several Improvements and
Alterations, which you deem it your Duty to recommend to his
immediate Adoption, and you will consider the Instruction as
applying to every branch of Administration with the exception of
the Distribution of the Military Force.</p>

<p align="center"><b>EARL BATHURST TO MR. COMMISSIONER BIGGE.
[3]</b></p>
<p align="right">Downing Street, 6th January, 1819.   </p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>I have already had the occasion to point out to you those
Objects of Enquiry on your arrival in New South Wales, which are
connected with the Administration of the Settlements there as fit
Receptacles for Convicts; but although the Prince Regent
considers these to be the most important and therefore the main
Objects of your Investigation, yet His Royal Highness is also
desirous of availing himself of your presence in that Quarter in
order to obtain a Report upon the variety of Topics, which have
more or less Reference to the Advancement of those Settlements as
Colonies of the British Empire. It becomes therefore my Duty to
detail to you the Subjects, upon which it appears requisite that
you should furnish every Information in your power, and in doing
so I deem it necessary to premise that, in any opinion you may be
led to form with respect to any change in the existing Regulation
of the Colony, you must always bear in mind the possibility of an
Abandonment of the present System of Transportation so far as
regards the existing Settlements, and must therefore in
recommending any Measures for adoption carefully distinguish how
far you consider them applicable to the Settlements in their
actual State, or only to that in which they would be placed in
the event of the Convict part of the Population being henceforth
diverted to other Stations.</p>
<p>The Establishment of the Courts of Justice will form the first
subject of such an enquiry. It will be for you to consider
whether the Alterations introduced into the Constitution of the
Courts in 1812 have rendered them adequate to the wants of the
Inhabitants, and to the due Administration of Criminal and Civil
Justice, and, if they still appear to you to be defective, to
suggest the Improvement of which you conceive they are
susceptible. You will also particularly report whether the
Settlements in Van Diemen's Land have advanced so far in
Population and Wealth, as to require a Judicature altogether
separate and distinct from that of the Principal Settlements in
New South Wales. In connection with the Judicial Establishments,
you will not fail to review the Police Regulations of the Colony,
and the manner of their Application to the several Classes of
Inhabitants whether Free Settlers or Convicts; It will form also
a Branch of your Investigation to point out whether, in a
Population so compounded as that of New South Wales, it be
consistent with safety to dispense with any of those more severe
provisions, which have frequently given rise to complaints, and
which cannot but be irksome to the Free Inhabitants of the
Colony.</p>
<p>You will also turn your Attention to the possibility of
diffusing throughout the Colony adequate means of Education and
Religious Instruction, bearing always in mind in your suggestions
that these two Branches ought in all Cases to be inseparably
connected. The Agricultural and Commercial Interests of the
Colony will further require your Attentive Consideration. With
respect to them, you will both report to me their actual State
and the means by which you consider they can be most readily
promoted. It cannot fail to have struck you that many of the
Colonial Regulations are at variance with the general Principles,
by an Adherence to which such Interests are usually advanced.
Among those which in this point of view must have appeared of
very questionable Expediency, I would more particularly refer to
the Authority which the Governor has hitherto exercised of fixing
the Prices of Staple Commodities in the Market, and of selecting
the Individuals who shall be permitted to supply Meat to the
Government Stores. With respect to these Regulations, you will
investigate how far their Repeal is likely to lead to any General
Inconvenience or to any Public Loss. I am aware that when the
Colony was first established the necessity of husbanding the
scanty means of Supply, and regulating its Issue, might justify
an Interference on the part of the Government, but now that the
Quantity of Land in cultivation is so much increased, and the
number of cultivators proportionately enlarged, so as to preclude
on the one hand all fear of want, and on the other a General
Combination of all the Cultivators against the Government, I
confess that I have great reason to doubt the expediency of these
Regulations. At the same time, I feel unwilling to recommend so
material an Alteration without some examination on the spot as to
its probable Effects. It will therefore be for you to report to
me whether the Markets may not be freed either gradually or all
at once from such restriction, whether the Competition of Traders
will not here as elsewhere produce the most beneficial Effects,
and whether the Government Stores may not be supplied (as in
other Colonies) by Public Tender, with equal Advantage both to
the Public and to the Individual Cultivator.</p>
<p>Another Subject of enquiry will be the propriety of permitting
in future a Distillation of Spirits within the Colony. From the
access, which you have had to the Correspondence, you are aware
of the Grounds upon which this measure has been so frequently
recommended by the Local Government, and of those reasons which
have induced His Majesty's Government hitherto to withhold their
Sanction; I need not therefore enter into the details of this
Discussion. The main question, now at issue, is whether a
Distillation of Spirits in the Colony could be so checked and
controlled as to prevent the indiscriminate and unrestrained
Dissemination of Ardent Spirits throughout a Population, too much
inclined already to an immoderate use of them, and too likely to
be excited by the use of them to Acts of Lawless Violence; and to
this your enquiry in this particular will be principally
directed.</p>
<p>It will not be unimportant for you to enquire into and report
upon the actual and Probable Revenues of the Colony, whether they
may be looked to hereafter as affording the means of defraying
some part of the heavy expenditure annually incurred on account
of New South Wales, and whether they are in any and in what cases
susceptible of Increase without prejudice to the Prosperity and
Welfare of the Settlements.</p>
<p>There is one other point also, which I cannot avoid
recommending to your consideration, though I fear there is not
much prospect of your being able to reconcile that difference of
opinion which has prevailed in the Colony. I allude to the
Propriety of admitting into Society Persons, who originally came
to the Settlement as Convicts. The Opinion, entertained by the
Governor and sanctioned by The Prince Regent, has certainly been
with some few exceptions, in favor of their reception at the
expiration of their several Sentences upon terms of perfect
Equality with the Free Settlers. But I am aware that the Conduct
of the Governor in this respect, however approved by the
Government at home, has drawn down upon him the Hostility of many
persons, who hold association with Convicts under any
circumstances to be a degradation. Feelings of this kind are not
easily overcome, but I should be unwilling to forego the
possibility of reconciling the conflicting opinions on this
subject by not adverting to it as a proper question for your
consideration.</p>
<p>I forbear to enter into a variety of other minor points of
detail, which will necessarily fall under the several Heads of
enquiry which I have pointed out to you, because I am confident
that no important point will be left unnoticed in the report
which you may ultimately furnish, and that you will be as anxious
to afford, as His Majesty's Government are to receive, every
Information necessary to form an opinion with respect to the
Police, the Agriculture, the Commerce, the Revenue, or the State
of Society in the Settlements, to which you are about to
proceed.</p>

<p align="center"><i>A special Commissioner.</i></p>
<p>The conclusion of the Napoleonic wars enabled the British
government to pay more attention to the development of the
colonies. The colony had been established under Governor Phillip
purely as a penal settlement. Major Grose and captain Paterson
had carried on the administration from the time of Phillip's
departure to the arrival of Governor Hunter. During this period
certain individuals, chiefly of the military party, commenced to
acquire wealth. Hunter in his government was confronted with a
new problem in the birth of vested interests. The clash of these
interests with the idea of a penal settlement and the
misrepresentations that were made to England caused Hunter's
recall. He was succeeded by Governor King, who met with a similar
fate, to be in turn succeeded by Governor Bligh. By this time,
the party which had caused the unrest had become stronger, and
Bligh's government, therefore, terminated in his deposition.
Governor Macquarie was sent to reorganise the colony. He
attempted to elaborate the idea of a penal settlement. He
discouraged the immigration of free settlers. He adopted his
policy for the encouragement of emancipists; but this policy
assisted in the removal of some of the terrors of transportation.
At the same time, the settlers, who had adopted the colony as
their home, agitated for various reforms, and adverse
representations were made against Macquarie's administration. It
is probable that the colonial office was in a quandary as to the
merits and demerits of the colony as a penal settlement, of the
agitations for reform, and of the principles of Macquarie's
administration, and that for this reason the appointment of a
commissioner of enquiry was made.</p>

<p align="center"><i>Mr. John Thomas Bigge.</i></p>
<p>John Thomas Bigge was the second son of Thomas Charles Bigge,
of Long Benton, Northumberland, and was born in the year 1780. He
was educated at Newcastle Grammar school, Westminster school, and
Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1801 and M.A. in
1804, and two years later was admitted a barrister of the Inner
Temple. After some practice at the bar, he was appointed, in
1815, chief justice and judge of the vice-admiralty court at
Trinidad. He had thus acquired some colonial experience before
his appointment to the commission of inquiry into the state of
New South Wales. His report caused much bitterness in the colony,
and he was publicly accused even of causing Macquarie's early
death. Shortly after his return to England from this inquiry, he
was given a similar commission to inquire into the state of Cape
Colony, where he did excellent work in exposing the corruption
amongst the officials employed there. This mission lasted for
several years; during that time his leg was injured by a fall
from a horse, and for two years he was under the treatment of a
quack, who turned out to be a female. He died in the year
1843.</p>

<p align="center"><i>It was an object here of peculiar
Apprehension.</i></p>
<p>In the year 1718 a statute, 4 Geo. I, c. II, was passed, which
authorised transportation, and established the machinery for
carrying it into effect. It provided that this punishment should
be substituted for branding and whipping, and that, in cases of
death sentences, the King might commute the punishment to
transportation for life or a fixed period to some part of the
American colonies. It was further provided that prisoners so
sentenced should be conveyed, transferred and made over "to the
use of any persons contracting for their transportation, to them
and their assigns", for the term of their sentence. The convicts
thus became the property of the contractors, upon whom no
restrictions were placed as to the manner of dealing with such
property. The contractors, who were usually shipowners, sold the
convicts as virtual slaves to the highest bidder, as soon as they
were landed in the American colonies. The colonial masters of
convicts made them work in the fields together with the black
slaves, and they were equally punished with the lash for idleness
and disobedience. The horrors of such a system naturally created
a dread of transportation.</p>
<p>By an order in council, dated 6th December, 1786, this system
was made applicable to the territory of New South Wales. But the
practice of selling the convicts on arrival at the place of
transportation was never adopted. In its stead, a ship was
chartered, the convicts were assigned to the owners or master,
who at the time of assignation agreed for a nominal sum to
re-transfer the services of the convicts to the governor or
lieutenant-governor at the port of debarkation. Whilst the colony
was in its infancy, and reports were received in England of
hardships endured, of subsisting on reduced rations, and being
clothed in rags, the thought of transportation to Botany bay, as
the settlements were commonly known, was dreaded, and acted as a
deterrent to crime. But when stories of prosperity, and of wealth
rapidly acquired by convicts and ex-convicts, reached England,
the dread rapidly disappeared. The attempt to revive this fear
was the cause of the rigorous systems adopted at Norfolk island,
at Port Arthur and Macquarie harbour, Tasmania, and Port
Macquarie, N.S.W.</p>

<p align="center"><i>My Letter to Lord Sidmouth.</i></p>
<p>The letter to Lord Sidmouth was dated "Downing Street, 23rd
April, 1817", and was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My Lord,</p>
<p>"I have for some time past had under consideration the present
State of the Settlements in New South Wales, principally with a
view of satisfying myself whether they are now calculated to
answer the object, for which they were originally established, or
whether it might not be expedient to introduce some alteration in
the existing system.</p>
<p>"Until a recent period the Transportation of Offenders to New
South Wales appears to have answered in a very great degree the
ends, for the Attainment of which it was adopted. The many
instances of persons returning from Transportation and becoming
afterwards useful Members of Society here, and the far more
numerous Cases in which Convicts, after the expiration of their
Sentences, became industrious Settlers in the Colony, are
sufficient to prove the Efficacy of the System in its Infancy, as
far at least as regarded the Improvement and Reform of the
Offenders. So long as the Colony was principally inhabited by
Convicts and but little advanced in Cultivation, the strictness
of the Police Regulations, and the Constant Labour under due
restriction, to which it was then possible to subject the
Convicts, rendered Transportation as a punishment an object of
the greatest Apprehension to those who looked upon strict
Discipline and Regular Labour as the most severe and the least
tolerable of Evils.</p>
<p>"It was not long however before the Settlements were found to
hold out to many Individuals inducements to become cultivators,
and thirty Years' experience of the Climate and Fertility of the
Soil has for some time past rendered a permission to settle in
New South Wales an object of anxious solicitude to all, who were
desirous of leaving their Native Country and had capital to apply
to the Improvement of Land. This System together with the Number
of Convicts, who after the Expiration of their Sentences remain
with their respective Families growing up under them, has so
increased the population of Free Settlers that the prosperity of
the Settlement as a Colony has proportionably advanced, and hopes
may reasonably be entertained of its becoming perhaps at no
distant period a valuable possession of the Crown. It is this
very circumstance which appears to me to render it less fit for
the object of its original Institution. The Settlers feel a
Repugnance to submit to the Enforcement of regulations which,
necessarily partaking much of the Nature of the Rules applicable
to a Penitentiary, interfere materially with the exercise of
those rights which they enjoyed in this Country, and to which as
British Subjects they conceive themselves entitled in every part
of His Majesty's Dominions. The greatest Objection however to the
present system arises from a cause over which Regulations in the
Settlement will not have any immediate Control. During latter
Years, the Number of Convicts annually transported has increased
beyond all Calculation, as will appear by a Reference to the
enclosed Return; and I am apprehensive that Your Lordship will
not be able to hold out any expectation that the Crimes to be
punished by Transportation will diminish in Magnitude or
Frequency, or that the Numbers to be transported will in this or
indeed in succeeding Years be less considerable. This continued
Influx must annually increase the Difficulty, which has long
began to be experienced of enforcing on the Convicts such a
strict Discipline, both as to Labour and Deportment, as is
essentially necessary to make Transportation answer the purpose
either of Punishment or Reform. The Difficulty of finding Regular
Employment for them has been such that it has been the practice
of Late Years to grant Tickets of Leave, almost without
exception, to those who had any prospect of obtaining a
Livelihood by their own exertions, and also to place a greater
proportion as Servants in the Families of Free Settlers. In the
former Case, the Convicts could be subjected to little more than
a nominal Restraint; and, in the latter, it is obvious that with
less regular Labour they must enjoy a freedom inconsistent with
the Object proposed in transporting them. Another Evil resulting
from the increased Number is the great Difficulty of subjecting
any of the Convicts to constant Superintendance either during the
Hours of work or Relaxation; and the necessity of leaving to a
large proportion of them the care of providing themselves with
their own Lodging during the night from the inadequacy of Public
Buildings, allotted to their Reception, forms one of the most
formidable objections to the present system. These Evils, and
more especially the Last, have been recently brought under my
Consideration by various persons, and also by the Governor, who
has coupled his Representations with a Recommendation that
Buildings should be erected for the reception of all the
Convicts; but the heavy expence of such a Work, if it be intended
that the New Buildings should encrease with the encreasing Number
of persons to be lodged in them, has induced me to decline my
sanction to this Recommendation except to a very limited Extent.
I am not however the less sensible of the Evil, nor can I conceal
from myself that Transportation to New South Wales is becoming
neither an object of Apprehension here nor the means of
Reformation in the Settlement itself, and that the Settlement
must be either placed upon a footing that shall render it
possible to enforce, with respect to all the Convicts, strict
Discipline, Regular Labour, and constant Superintendance, or the
System of unlimited Transportation to New South Wales must be
abandoned. I do not feel at present prepared to decide upon the
Alternative, which it may be expedient to recommend; but,
thinking it necessary as a preliminary to such a Decision that
the actual State of the Settlements in New South Wales should be
distinctly ascertained and that Information should without Delay
be procured both as to the Means, by which it is practicable to
remedy the existing Evils, and as to the Charge, which such an
undertaking might bring upon the public, I propose (should it
meet with Your Lordship's Concurrence) to recommend to His Royal
Highness The Prince Regent the appointment of Commissioners, who
shall forthwith proceed to the Settlements, with full power to
investigate all the Complaints which have been made both with
respect to the Treatment of the Convicts and the General
Administration of the Government, and to report to His Royal
Highness The Improvements and Alterations of which the present
System appears to them to be susceptible, and the Charge which
their Adoption may bring upon the Public.</p>
