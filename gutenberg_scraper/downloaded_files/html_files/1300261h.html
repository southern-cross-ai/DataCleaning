  <p class="first">AMID all the eulogies and all the slanders that are lavished
  upon the English character, very few people would appear to take any real
  trouble to obtain a sincere view of it. Rhetorical phrases about its
  inarticulate strength and nobility do not commonly bring us very much
  further, for it may be questioned whether it is good for a people excitedly
  to articulate their own inarticulate disposition. But, when all is said and
  done, it may truly be said that among all the national temperaments the
  English is pre-eminently simple and profoundly well-meaning. This
  well-meaningness combined with this simplicity is responsible for every one
  of its crimes, and it is the basis of its real and indestructible
  magnificence. But this union of moral soundness with mental innocence is
  responsible also for a certain tendency noticeable in all English life and
  character: the tendency to get hold of the truth, but to get hold of it
  falsely; to grasp the fact, but to grasp it somehow by the wrong end. A
  hundred instances might be given of this. To take a random example. I was
  taught at my mother's knee, in the intervals of hymns and childish ballads,
  that Germans smoked bad cigars. I see now that this is true, and yet
  unfathomably false; that is to say, there are, if you choose to put it in
  that way, more bad cigars smoked in Germany than in England, but that is only
  because, tobacco being cheaper, more cigars of every kind are smoked. It is
  as if a Hindoo peasant, who had never seen a jewel in his life, were to say
  that England was a land of false diamonds. In India only the rulers have such
  things at all; in the Strand any one may have them; and similarly the cigar
  is in England merely a badge of luxury, while abroad it is often a common
  possession, like a pipe.</p>

  <p>In this mere casual instance we have the constant English attitude: the
  strong and even humble curiosity which does really know something about
  foreign nations, but along with it that strange tendency to put the true
  thing the wrong way round, to seize on the unimportant side of the matter
  first.</p>

  <p><a id="pic04"
     name="pic04"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <p>It is just as if a foreign critic of England&mdash;instead of knowing
  nothing at all about us, as is usually the case&mdash;were to grasp the fact
  that the most luxurious English people went fox-hunting, and then explain it
  by saying that these Sybarites had one weird hatred, a venomous hatred of
  foxes. Such a man would have got the facts right and the truth wrong; and
  such is our constant national condition with regard to foreign ideas. But
  there is an even more curious example of it than this, and that is the fact
  that even in our own discussions, and in the matter of the great reputations
  of our own country, we exhibit this same singular tendency to catch hold of
  truth only by the tail or the hind leg.</p>

  <p>Our judgments&mdash;that is, our current and conventional
  judgments&mdash;on our great men of genius have a singular disposition to
  begin in enormous letters with the unimportant defect, and miss in comparison
  the great merit out of which that defect arises. Thus, for instance,
  Englishmen have wearied themselves with asserting that Dickens was vulgar and
  could not describe a gentleman.</p>

  <p class="first"><a href="#bn2"
     id="pic06"
     name="pic06"><small><i>Click here for more
     information</i></small></a></p><img src="1300261h-images/Thackeray06.jpg"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Dickens could not describe a gentleman, but he was never vulgar except
  when he attempted that snobbish and unworthy enterprise. Most men do become
  vulgar when they describe those who are called vulgar people; and it is
  precisely here that Dickens was never vulgar&mdash;there is no trace of
  vulgarity about Silas Wegg or Dick Swiveller. The supreme function of Dickens
  in the universe was to point out that robust and humorous common life is not
  vulgar, cannot in its nature be vulgar, and the only thing that his
  countryman can see about him is that he could not describe a member of the
  upper classes. We might as well say that Michael Angelo never really painted
  a chartered accountant.</p>

  <p>Here again our sincere people have got to the wrong end of the telescope.
  But of all these examples there is none more perfect and more amusing than
  the fashion which called Thackeray a cynic. He was a cynic, if the critics
  will, in the same sense that Leonardo da Vinci was a chemist or Mr.
  Chamberlain a horticulturalist. But the cynic in him was not merely
  subordinate to his other characteristics; it was the mere product&mdash;nay,
  the by-product&mdash;of them. His cynicism was a minor result, a thing left
  over by his triumphant tendency to sentiment!</p>

  <p>Thackeray, from the beginning of his life until the end, consistently and
  seriously preached a gospel. His gospel, like all deep and genuine ones, may
  be hard to sum up in a phrase, but if we wished so to sum it up we could
  hardly express it better than by saying that it was the philosophy of the
  beauty and the glory of fools.</p>

  <p>He believed as profoundly as St. Paul that in the ultimate realm of
  essential values God made the foolish things of the earth to confound the
  wise. He looked out with lucent and terrible eyes upon the world with all its
  pageants and achievements; he saw men of action, he saw men of genius, he saw
  heroes; and amid men of action, men of genius, and heroes he saw with
  absolute sincerity only one thing worth being&mdash;a gentleman. And when we
  understand what he meant by the phrase, the absolute sufficiency of a limpid
  kindliness, of an obvious and dignified humility, of a softness for noble
  memories and a readiness for any minute self-sacrifice, we may, without any
  affected paradox, but rather with serious respect, sum up Thackeray's view of
  life by saying that amid all the heroes and geniuses he saw only one thing
  worth being&mdash;a fool.</p>

  <p>The real falsehood&mdash;if there be a falsehood&mdash;of Thackeray's view
  of the world was, in fact, the very opposite of that cynicism and worldliness
  once attributed to him. In so far as he did misrepresent life, it was rather
  in the direction of showing too much bold disdain of Vanity Fair and too much
  absolute faith in the saints, his unworldly women and his easily swindled
  gentlemen.</p>

  <p>He permitted this pietism of his to blind him to the vivid atrocities of
  the character of Helen Pendennis, supposing that her having lived all her
  life in a country homestead was some kind of preventative against cruelty and
  paganism and heathen pride. Thackeray is, if anything, too much on the side
  of the angels. He was a monk who rushed out of his monastery to cry out
  against a gaudy masquerade that was roaring around it, and ever since his
  monk's frock has been mistaken for one of the masquerade dresses and
  applauded as the best joke in the whole fancy dress ball.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>There are, of course, exceptions, or what may appear to be exceptions, to
  such a generalisation. So deep and genuine was Thackeray's insight into the
  normal human spirit that he detected this element of idealism where it might
  least be expected. The character of Major Pendennis, for instance, is simply
  a great lighthouse or beacon tower, not merely of social satire, but of
  eternal ethical philosophy.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>In Major Pendennis, consciously or unconsciously, is traced the valuable
  truth that almost every man is, by the nature of things, an idealist. To go
  to great houses, to wear the latest and yet the most dignified attire, to
  know the right people, to do and say at every instant the thing which is most
  perfectly and exquisitely ordinary, this is a principle of life against which
  a sane man might have a great deal to say; but one thing he could not say, he
  could not say that it is materialistic. One moral merit it has: at least it
  is totally useless. A place in Society is not something to drink; an
  invitation card from Lord Steyne is not something to eat. Poor old Pendennis
  did not sleep softer in his incomparable clothing; he was a poor man, lonely
  and constantly troubled. Nothing supported him but his own monstrous and
  insane religion. He was, as it were, a glorious heretic, a martyr to false
  gods; and nothing sadder or more honourable has ever been conceived in
  fiction than that scene in the end of "Pendennis," in which the old man,
  having, with a valour and energy that stirs us like a cavalry charge,
  defeated all machinations that would have robbed his nephew of name and fame,
  suddenly finds the nephew himself ready to fling down the whole laborious
  edifice in the name of an unintelligible scruple. "And Shakespeare was right,
  and Cardinal Wolsey, begad. If I had served my God as I've served you&mdash;"
  It has the pathos of the meeting of two faiths; the good Moslem staring at
  the good Crusader.</p>

  <p>This was the greatness of Thackeray, the man whom sentimentalists without
  hearts or stomachs have conceived as a mere satirist, that he felt, perhaps,
  more fully and heavily than any other Englishman the immeasurable and almost
  unbearable emotion that is involved in the mere fact of human life. Dickens,
  with his indestructible vanity and boyishness, is always looking forward.
  Thackeray is always looking back in life. And no man will ever properly
  comprehend him until he has reached for a moment that state of the soul in
  which melancholy is the greatest of all the joys.</p>

  <p>"You will not hear&mdash;it is best to know it&mdash;what moves in the
  real world, what passes in society, in the clubs, colleges,
  mess-rooms,&mdash;what is the life and talk of your sons. A little more
  frankness than is customary has been attempted in this story; with no bad
  desire on the writer's part, it is hoped, and with no ill-consequence to any
  reader. If truth is not always pleasant, at any rate truth is best, from
  whatever chair&mdash;from those whence graver writers or thinkers argue, as
  from that at which the storyteller sits as he concludes his labour, and bids
  his kind reader farewell." So runs a passage in the preface to
  "Pendennis."</p>

  <p>"If truth is not always pleasant, at any rate truth is best." There, in a
  sentence, is the secret underlying all Thackeray's work. The novelist is
  inclined to portray the men and women of fiction rather than the men and
  women of life. This fault of his weaker brethren of the quill Thackeray
  avoided. His characters are always human. There are no immaculate heroes, no
  perfect heroines, no utterly unredeemed scoundrels of either sex to be met
  with in the pages of his books.</p>

  <p>He conceived it to be his duty to describe the world as he saw it, and to
  draw the men and women he knew. If he has nowhere joined pure goodness to
  pure intelligence, if he has not bestowed on any woman the humour of Becky
  Sharp and the simplicity of Amelia Sedley, it is because he had never met
  this union of forces in life. To have described the unreal and passed it off
  as the real would have been an offence against the pen which was able to
  boast:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Stranger! I never writ a flattery,<br>
  Nor signed the page that registered a lie.</p><br>

  <p>"I cannot help telling the truth as I view it, and describing what I see.
  To describe it otherwise than it seems to me would be falsehood in that
  calling in which it has pleased Heaven to place me; treason to that
  conscience which says that men are weak; that truth must be told; that faults
  must be owned; that pardon must be prayed for; and that Love reigns supreme
  over all." This is Thackeray's confession of literary faith.</p>

  <p>"My object is not to make a perfect character of anything like it," he
  wrote to his mother when "Vanity Fair" was appearing in monthly parts. "Our
  friend is not Amadis or Sir Charles Grandison," he wrote of Philip Firmin,
  "and I don't for a moment set him up as a person to be revered or imitated,
  but try to draw him faithfully as Nature made him."</p>

  <p>The late Anthony Trollope stigmatised Thackeray as an unmethodical writer.
  Certainly the great man, as author, bound himself by no hard and fast rules.
  His plan was to create mentally two or three of his chief characters and
  write from page to page, with only a general notion of the course he would be
  taking a few chapters later. But then to compensate for the lack of method he
  lived with his characters, shared their joys and sorrows, and spoke of them
  as if they were real creatures of flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>"Being entirely occupied with my two new friends, Mrs. Pendennis and her
  son Arthur Pendennis," he wrote to Mrs. Brookfield from Brighton in 1849, "I
  got up very early again this morning. He is a very good-natured, generous
  young fellow, and I begin to like him considerably. I wonder if he is
  interesting to me from selfish reasons, and because I fancy we resemble each
  other in many parts." "I wonder what will happen to Pendennis and Fanny
  Bolton," he remarked in another letter to the same correspondent; "writing
  and sending it to you, somehow it seems as if it were true." Mrs. Ritchie
  remembers entering her father's study one morning about two years later and
  being motioned away, and how, an hour later, he went to the school-room and,
  half-laughing, half-ashamed, said: "I do not know what James can have thought
  of me when he came in with the tax-gatherer after you left, and found me
  blubbering over Helen Pendennis's death."</p>

  <p>"I don't control my characters," he asserted one day. "I am in their
  hands, and they take me where they please." And when a friend remonstrated
  with him for having made Esmond marry "his mother-in-law," he only replied:
  "<i>I</i> didn't make him do it; they did it themselves." It may be because
  the characters were so real to the creator that they live in the memory of
  the reader. If Thackeray was the first to shed tears over the death of Helen,
  certainly he has not been the last. Who can read with dry eyes of the
  reconciliation of mother and son at the death-bed? "As they were talking the
  clock struck nine, and Helen reminded him how, when he was a little boy, she
  used to go up to his bed-room at that hour and hear him say Our Father. And
  once more, oh once more, the young man fell down at his mother's sacred
  knees, and sobbed out the prayer which the Divine Tenderness uttered for us,
  and which has been echoed for twenty ages since by millions of sinful and
  humble men. And as he spoke the last words of the supplication, the mother's
  head fell down on her boy's, and her arms closed around him, and together
  they repeated the words 'for ever and ever' and 'Amen.'"</p>

  <p>Readers of Thackeray's works must have noticed how frequently the
  characters reappear in tales other than that in which they are first
  introduced. Reference is made to them and to their doings in book after book,
  until we feel that we know them personally. Thackeray loved to reintroduce
  his old friends, and it was his intention&mdash;frustrated by an all too
  early death&mdash;to write a novel of the times of Henry V., in which the
  ancestors of his Pendennises and Warringtons should have foregathered. A long
  and fascinating article might be written tracing the subsequent careers of
  the characters from the glances we obtain of them at odd moments.</p>

  <p>In his earlier years, however, he was too bitter, and his stories contain
  far too many scoundrels. "I don't know where I get all these rascals for my
  books," he said apologetically; "I have certainly never lived with such
  people." "The Yellowplush Correspondence" does not contain a single man or
  woman we should like to meet. Yellowplush is a scamp; Dawkins is silly and
  snobbish; Blewitt, the cardsharper, is a bully and a fool; Lady Griffin is
  not pleasant, and though she is badly treated, her revenge is too cruel; the
  Earl of Crabs&mdash;the creation of a master hand&mdash;is a terrible man,
  whose sense of humour only makes him more dangerous; and Deuceace himself,

  pounds; that with his friend Mr. Ringwood (who, with the invaluable
  assistance of his hostess, trapped the commercial traveller, Pogson, into the
  signing of bills for huge amounts at the house of Madame la Baronne de
  Florval-Delval, <i>née</i> de Melval-Norval) he won heavily at the card-table
  from Mr. Vanjohn; and that with Blundell-Blundell (who was up at Oxford with
  Arthur Pendennis) he contrived to swindle Colonel Altamont.</p>

  <p>Then there is the paragraph in "Galignams Messenger," quoted in the last
  chapter of "A Shabby Genteel Story": "Married at the British Embassy, by
  Bishop Luxcombe, Andrew Fitch, Esq., to Marianne Caroline Matilda, widow of
  the late Antony Carrickfergus, of Lombard Street, and Gloucester Place,
  Esquire...Miss Runt officiated as bridesmaid; and we remarked among the
  company Earl and Countess Crabs, General Sir Rice Curry, K.C.B., Colonel
  Wapshot, Sir Charles Swang, the Hon. Algernon Percy Deuceace and his lady,
  Count Punter, and others of the <i>élite</i> of the fashionables now in
  Paris. The bridegroom was attended by his friend Michael Angelo Titmarsh,
  Esq., and the lady was given away by the Right Hon. the Earl of Crabs..." Had
  the Hon. Mrs. Deuceace forgiven her husband the blow in the <i>Bois</i>, with
  the account of which the adventure of Mr. Deuceace at Paris concluded? Was
  the younger couple reconciled to the elder? and if so, by what means? As the
  author does not solve the problem, each reader must do so for himself.</p>

  <p>"Catherine," a satire upon the "Newgate Novels," naturally contains a
  collection of jail-birds; and these, of course, are not treated as they would
  have been by Ainsworth or Bulwer Lytton, but are shown in all their
  hideousness. "A Shabby Genteel Story" is a very fine piece of work, but its
  theme is unpleasant&mdash;the trapping into a mock marriage of trusting
  Cinderella&mdash;and the characters objectionable: Mr. and Mrs. Gann and the
  Misses Macarty; Brandon, Tufthunt, and Cinqbars. Fitch is the one honest
  person, save the heroine, and he is vulgar. Tufthunt is, perhaps, the worst
  man Thackeray ever depicted, for Sir Francis Clavering is weak rather than
  vile, and Brandon&mdash;the Dr. Firmin of "Philip"&mdash;suffers from a moral
  sense so perverted that he cannot realise his own weakness.</p>

  <p>The stories of "Dorothea" and "Ottilia," however, are agreeable enough.
  Even "Barry Lyndon," one of the author's masterpieces, is a disagreeable
  story. This, indeed, Thackeray fully realised. "You need not read it," he
  said to his eldest daughter; "you would not like it." The villain Barry, who
  never realises that he is not a hero, and his foolish wife, are only in part
  counterbalanced by Barry's vulgar, loving mother, who goes to him in the day
  of his ruin and nurses him until he dies of <i>delirium tremens</i> in the
  nineteenth year of his residence in the Fleet prison.</p>

  <p>After "Barry Lyndon" appeared "Vanity Fair," "Pendennis," "The Newcomes,"
  "Esmond," and "The Virginians," which contain so vast a number of characters
  that it is impossible to treat of them one by one.</p>

  <p>"Wherever shines the sun, you are sure to find Folly basking in it.
  Knavery is the shadow at Folly's heels," Thackeray wrote in the character
  sketch of "Captain Rook and Mr. Pigeon." It seems as if he had not quite
  grasped the fact that there were other things than folly and knavery to write
  about, and that a surfeit of rogues has an unpleasant after-effect. "Oh! for
  a little manly, honest, God-relying simplicity, cheerful, affected, and
  humble!" he had prayed in one of his earliest reviews; but it was only with
  "Vanity Fair" that he began to give it.</p>

  <p>It has been stated by more than one critic that Thackeray could not depict
  a good woman, and that those that were without blemish were also without any
  attractive qualities. Yet Helen Pendennis was a good woman, a good wife, and
  a good mother; and Laura Bell was clever as well as good; and certainly Ethel
  Newcome was not a fool; nor Theo and Kitty Lambert other than good and true
  women. It seems strange that while his female readers can forgive him Becky
  Sharp, greatest of adventuresses, and can tolerate even Blanche Amory of "Mes
  Larmes," they cannot pardon him Amelia Sedley.</p>

  "Philip"); Miss Fotheringay and Fanny Bolton, who ensnared the affections of
  young Pendennis&mdash;what man has not met one or both of these?&mdash;Madame
  de Florae, the old lady with the beautiful face; the terrible Campaigner;
  Mrs. Warrington, who preferred to be known as Madame Esmond; Lady Castlewood,
  tender, loving, unreasoning, who can rise to the dignity of a great
  situation: "My daughter may receive presents from the Head of our House; my
  daughter may thankfully take kindnesses from her father's, her mother's, her
  brothers dearest friend and be grateful for one more benefit besides the
  thousand we owe him"; and, above all, irresistible, wayward Trix&mdash;that
  contradiction in words, an ambitious woman. So alluring is Beatrix that it is
  absurd to expect any man to think that she was ever all bad. Who knows but
  that if Harry Esmond had been a little less sensitive of his own demerits,
  and had let her see him as he was, they might have married and lived as happy
  as most couples? But her chance of redemption passed, and Beatrix became the

  <p>Thackeray's men are no whit less successful. George Osborne and his
  purse-proud father; old Mr. Sedley and Jos; Sir Pitt Crawley&mdash;that most
  daring piece of character drawing&mdash;and his sons, Pitt and Rawdon;
  Pendennis and "Bluebeard," as Lady Rockingham called George Warrington;
  little Bows; the valet, Morgan; Clive Newcome and his cousin, the little
  bounder. Sir Barnes; the Virginians, Harry and George; the inimitable Foker
  and the irrepressible Costigan. Thackeray drew gentlemen in a way that has
  never been excelled and rarely equalled. "They [the Kickleburys] are
  travelling with Mr. Bloundell, who was a gentleman once, and still retains
  about him some faint odour of that time of bloom." "It is true poor
  Plantagenet [Gaunt] is only an idiot...a zany...and yet you see he is a

  <p>And the author makes the reader see it is so. In spite of the debaucheries
  and his behaviour to his family, the Marquis of Steyne is always <i>grand
  seigneur</i>. Esmond is a gentleman, and so is the intriguing Major
  Pendennis, Half-Pay; and Florac and Dobbin, and the little-worldly-wise
  Colonel Newcome. It has been said that the Colonel is too good for this
  world, too innocent, too ignorant, too transparently a child of nature, yet
  surely the noble-hearted man is human and true. Indeed, by this one character
  alone Thackeray could take his place among the masters. The whole gallery of
  his creations places him at the head of the English novelists of the
  nineteenth century.</p>

  <p>A paper dealing with Thackeray's characters may not ignore the question of
  the "originals." Great interest has always been taken in Thackeray's
  originals. Much has been written about them which is worth reading; much also
  has been written that is misleading. The novelist was personal sometimes, but
  it was seldom that he modelled a character on a man or woman of his
  acquaintance. He told his daughters that he never wilfully copied anyone; and
  there is no reason to disbelieve his statement. The Marquis of Steyne was a
  sublimation of half a dozen characters, and so were Captain Shandon and
  Costigan; and Becky, Dobbin, Jos Sedley, and Colonel Newcome were wholly
  original&mdash;from the celebrity point of view at least. Many of the people
  in "Esmond" are portraits of historical personages&mdash;the Duke of
  Hamilton, Lord Mohun, and Beatrix, for instance&mdash;but in the tales of
  modern life there are few characters that can be traced to any particular
  source. "You know you are only a piece of Amelia. My mother is another half;
  my poor little wife&mdash;<i>y'est pour beaucoup</i>," the author wrote to
  Mrs. Brookfield. Edmund Yates always insisted that Wagg in "Pendennis" stood
  for Theodore Hook; that Lord Lonsdale was the original of Major Pendennis's
  noble friend Lord Colchicum; and that Bunn was the model for Dolphin, the
  theatrical manager.</p>

  <p>It has been said that Mr. J. M. Evans, the publisher, was portrayed in
  "The Kickleburys on the Rhine"; that Mr. Flam in "Mrs. Perkins's Ball" was a
  portrait of Abraham Hayward; that the Rev. W. H. Brookfield stood for the
  curate, Frank Whitestock; that Leigh Hunt was the original of Gandish in "The
  Newcomes"; and that the third Marquis of Hertford was the prototype of Lord
  Steyne. Mrs. Ritchie once saw the young lady who was supposed to have
  suggested Becky Sharp to her father; and Carlyle and his wife knew&mdash;and
  disliked&mdash;the original Blanche Amory.</p>

  <p>Thackeray was not topographical in the sense that Dickens was. Often the
  briefest mention of a street satisfied him. Yet somehow the places of the
  principal scenes of his novels linger in the memory. As a young man he
  studied at Weimar, and later, while serving his apprenticeship both to art
  and letters, he resided from time to time at Paris. Had he never visited
  Germany, perhaps Amelia and Jos and Dobbin would not have gone Am Rhein, and
  the chapter about Becky and the Pumpernickel students would never have been
  written. Many of his characters went to Paris, which had for him a strong
  personal interest. It was there he wooed and won his wife. It was at Paris
  that he wrote the autobiographical verse in the ballad which tells of the
  Bouillabaisse served at Terré's Tavern in the Rue Neuve des Petits
  Champs:</p>

  <p class="verse">Ah me! how quick the days are flitting!<br>
  I mind me of a time that's gone,<br>
  When here I'd sit, as now I'm sitting,<br>
  In this same place&mdash;but not alone.<br>
  A fair young form was nestled near me,<br>
  A dear dear face looked fondly up.<br>
  And sweetly spoke and smiled to cheer me,<br>
  &mdash;There's no one now to share my cup.</p>

  <p>"I have been to the Hotel de la Terrasse, where Becky used to live, and
  shall pass by Captain Osborne's lodgings," he wrote from Paris to Mrs.
  Brookfield. "I believe perfectly in all these people, and feel quite an
  interest in the inn in which they lived." It was at Brussels, in the Church
  of St. Gudule, the church in which he was christened, that Esmond met the
  inveterate intriguer, Father Holt, masquerading in a green uniform as a
  captain in the Bavarian Elector's service; and in the convent cemetery knelt
  before the cross which marked the grave of Soeur Mary Madeleine, the unhappy
  Lady Castlewood, who was his mother. In that same city many years later the
  author of "Vanity Fair," not claiming to rank among the military novelists,
  took his place with the non-combatants while the armies marched to the field
  of Waterloo, and portrayed many folk with anxious hearts awaiting news that
  must bring them happiness or misery. "No more firing was heard at
  Brussels&mdash;the pursuit rolled miles away. The darkness came down on the
  field and city; and Amelia was praying for George, who was lying on his face,
  dead, with a bullet through his heart." Thackeray was pre-eminently the
  novelist of the upper classes, and as a natural result the majority of his
  characters lived in the West End of London, chiefly in the area enclosed by
  Park Lane, Oxford Street, Bond Street, and Piccadilly, known as Mayfair. But
  no part of the metropolis escaped him. The Sedleys lived in Russell Square
  before they removed to St. Adelaide's Villas, Anna Maria Road, West, "where
  the houses look like baby-houses; where the people looking out of the first
  floor windows must infallibly, as you think, sit with their feet in the
  parlours; where the shrubs in the little gardens in front bloom with a
  perennial display of little children's pinafores, little red socks, caps,
  etc. (polyandria polygyria); whence you hear the sound of jingling spirits
  and women singing; whither of evenings you see city clerks plodding
  wearily..." Dr. Firmin practised in Old Parr Street; and Colonel Newcome and
  James Binnie, on their return from India, rented a house in Fitzroy Square.
  Bungay and Bacon carried on their business in Paternoster Row, and lived over
  their shops. It was to the sponging house in Cursitor Street that Rawdon
  Crawley was taken after the ball at Gaunt House. Among others, Pendennis and
  Warrington lived in the Temple; while Colonel Newcome and his son, Dr. Firmin
  and Philip, Pendennis, young Rawdon&mdash;to name a few&mdash;were educated
  at the Charterhouse. "The Newcomes" immortalised that public school, and
  earned for the author the well-deserved title of "Carthusianus
  Carthusianorum." The clubs and Bohemian resorts of the day were introduced
  into the various stories: the visit of Colonel Newcome to the "Cave of
  Harmony" is not easily forgotten. In Mayfair was situated Gaunt House, and in
  Curzon Street, near by, Becky and Rawdon practised the art of living on
  nothing a year. It was in the Curzon Street house that Becky is made to
  admire her husband, when he gives Lord Steyne the chastisement that
  <i>ruins</i> her for life. "When I wrote that sentence," Thackeray remarked

  <p class="note"><a id="bn1"
     name="bn1"></a><b>The Thackeray Family</b></p>

  <p class="note">William Makepeace Thackeray, the only child of Richmond and
  Anne Thackeray, was born at Calcutta on July 18th, 1811. He was descended
  from Yorkshire yeomen who for several generations had been settled at
  Hampsthwaite, in the West Riding. In 1766 his grandfather, likewise named
  William Makepeace Thackeray, sailed for India at the age of seventeen, to
  enter the service of the East India Company. Under Cartier, the predecessor
  of Warren Hastings as Governor of Bengal, his promotion was very rapid. In
  1776 he married Amelia Richmond, and the same year returned to England. His
  fourth son, Richmond Thackeray, father of the novelist, went to India in 1798
  also in the service of the Company. In 1807 he became Secretary to the Board
  of Revenue at Calcutta, and undoubtedly possessed brilliant gifts for
  administration and public work. He married on October 13th, 1810, the
  reigning beauty of Calcutta, Anne, daughter of John Harman Becher. The
  painting by Chinnery, executed in 1814, gives a glimpse of the Thackerays at
  the time when their son had reached the age of three years. He is drawn
  perched on a large pile of books, with his arms round his mother's neck, his
  father stiffly seated in a chair close by.</p>

  <p class="note">Richmond Thackeray was at this time Collector of the district
  called the Twenty-four Pergunnahs. Two years later he died, and in 1817 his
  son was sent to England to be educated, and was placed in the charge of his
  aunt Mrs. Ritchie, who first sent him to a school in Hampshire, and then to
  the establishment of Dr. Turner at Chiswick. About 1818 Mrs. Richmond
  Thackeray married a second time, and in 1821 returned to England with her
  husband, Major Carmichael Smyth, and settled at Addiscombe. The following
  year Thackeray was sent to the Charterhouse, where he remained until
  1828.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn2"
     name="bn2"></a><b>The Charterhouse in the time of Thackeray<br>
  Thackeray, from the replica of a plaster cast by J. Devile</b></p>

  <p class="note">This famous school figured largely in his writings as
  "Greyfriars." It was here that Colonel Newcome and Clive, Pendennis, George
  Osborne, Philip Firmin, and Rawdon Crawley were educated. Charterhouse was
  the scene of Thackeray's fight with Venables, in which he sustained the
  unfortunate accident to his nose that caused a permanent disfigurement in his
  otherwise handsome countenance. Evidence of this is noticeable in the plaster
  cast executed by J. Devile, which represents Thackeray at the age of
  eleven.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn3"
     name="bn3"></a><b>Larkbeare, the home of Thackeray's mother</b> <i>see
     page 2</i></p>

  <p class="note">In 1825 Thackeray's mother removed to Larkbeare, a house
  situated a mile and a half from Ottery St. Mary, where her son used to spend
  his holidays. On leaving school he remained at Larkbeare until he took up his
  residence at Trinity College, Cambridge, in February 1829. The scenery
  surrounding his mother's home is described in "Pendennis," Ottery St. Mary,
  Exeter, and Sidmouth figuring respectively as Clavering St. Mary, Chatteris,
  and Baymouth.</p>

  <p class="note">While at Cambridge Thackeray contributed to a small paper
  called <i>The Snob, a literary and scientific journal not conducted by
  members of the University</i>. In it appeared "Timbuctoo," a mock poem on the
  subject chosen for the Chancellor's medal, won that year by Alfred Tennyson.
  In 1829 Thackeray spent the long vacation in Paris, and left college after
  the following Easter term.</p>

  <p class="note">Having inherited a fortune from his father, it was arranged
  that he should finish his education by travelling abroad for a couple of
  years. Accordingly he spent several months at Dresden, Rome, Paris, and
  Weimar, and finally resolved to study for the Bar on his return to England.
  In 1831 he entered the Middle Temple, and by November of that year was
  settled in chambers in Hare Court. On coming of age, however, he abandoned
  all pretence of following the profession he had chosen, and made his way to
  Paris, whence he wrote letters for <i>The National Standard</i>, and
  collected material for miscellaneous articles. Having speedily lost the
  greater part of his fortune, he turned his thoughts seriously to painting as
  a means of livelihood, and at this period frequented various studios,
  probably working in the atelier of Gros. Later he copied pictures assiduously
  at the Louvre, but though he delighted in the art he failed to acquire any
  great technical skill as a draughtsman.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn4"
     name="bn4"></a><b>Thackeray among the Fraserians</b></p>

  <p class="note">In January 1835 Thackeray appeared as one of the Fraserians
  in a sketch drawn by Maclise and published in <i>Frasers Magazine</i>. This
  celebrated cartoon depicts the Fraser writers at one of the frequent banquets
  held at 212, Regent Street. It was in this company that Thackeray first
  gained distinction as an author.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn5"
     name="bn5"></a><b>Rue Neuve St. Augustin, Paris</b></p>

  <p class="note">In 1836 he was appointed Paris correspondent of <i>The
  Constitutional</i>, and in August of the same year he married Miss Shawe. The
  wedding took place at the British Embassy, Bishop Luscombe, at that time
  chaplain, officiating at the ceremony. The newly married couple lived in
  apartments in the Rue Neuve St. Augustin, a street quite close by the Rue
  Neuve des Petits Champs, where is situated the restaurant made famous in the
  "Ballad of Bouillabaisse."</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn6"
     name="bn6"></a><b>No. 18, Albion Street, Hyde Park<br>
  No. 13, Great Coram Street, Brunswick Square</b></p>

  <p class="note"><i>The Constitutional</i> came to an end in 1837, and
  Thackeray returned to London and took up his abode for a time at 18, Albion
  Street, Hyde Park, where his mother was then living, and where he had stayed
  in 1834 when first contributing to <i>Frasers Magazine</i>. Anne Isabella
  Thackeray, his eldest daughter, was born at this house. A removal was made
  not long afterwards to No. 13, Great Coram Street, Brunswick Square, where
  the Thackerays lived for some years. During this period "The Paris
  Sketch-Book" was written, being published in 1840 by Macrone. Owing to the
  misfortune of his wife's illness the author's household became unsettled, and
  about 1843 the home at Great Coram Street was given up.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn7"
     name="bn7"></a><b>"Comic Tales and Sketches"</b></p>

  <p class="note">Thackeray had published in 1841 a collection of "Comic Tales
  and Sketches, edited and illustrated by Mr. Michael Angelo Titmarsh," with a
  preface dated "Paris, April 1st, 1841," from which the following is an
  extract:</p>

  <p class="note">When there came to be a question of republishing the tales in
  these volumes, the three authors, Major Gahagan, Mr. Fitzroy Yellowplush, and
  myself, had a. violent dispute upon the matter of editing; and at one time we
  talked of editing each other all round. The toss of a halfpenny, however,
  decided the question in my favour...On the title-page the reader is presented
  with three accurate portraits of the authors of these volumes. They are
  supposed to be marching hand-in-hand, and are just on the very brink of
  Immortality.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn8"
     name="bn8"></a><b>Drawing from "Punch": "Authors' Miseries"</b> <i>see
     page 12</i></p>

  <p class="note">During the same year "The History of Samuel Titmarsh and the
  Great Hoggarty Diamond" commenced to run its course in <i>Fraser's
  Magazine</i>. <i>Punch</i> had been started on July 17th, and Thackeray's
  first contributions appeared the following June. In the course of his ten
  years' connection with this periodical he contributed something like 500
  sketches irrespective of letterpress. One of these, reproduced here, is taken
  from a series entitled "Authors' Miseries," and represents Jerrold and the
  artist himself in a railway carriage listening to the other occupants
  discussing the members of the <i>Punch</i> staff:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="note"><i>Old Gentleman, Miss Wiggets, Two Authors.</i></p>

  <p class="note"><i>Old Gentleman</i>: "I am so sorry to see you occupied, my
  dear Miss Wiggets, with that trivial paper, <i>Punch</i>. A railway is not a
  place, in my opinion, for jokes. I never joke&mdash;never."</p>

  <p class="note"><i>Miss W.:</i> "So I should think, sir."</p>

  <p class="note"><i>Old Gentleman:</i> "And besides, are you aware who are the
  conductors of that paper, and that they are Chartists, Deists, Atheists,
  Anarchists, to a man? I have it from the best authority, that they meet
  together once a week in a tavern in St. Giles's, where they concoct their
  infamous print. The chief part of their income is derived from threatening
  letters, which they send to the nobility and gentry. The principal writer is
  a returned convict. Two have been tried at the Old Bailey; and as for their
  artist&mdash;as for their artist..."</p>

  <p class="note"><i>Guard:</i> "Swin-dun! Station!" [<i>Exeunt two
  Authors.</i></p>

  <p class="note">In the latter half of 1842 Thackeray made a tour in Ireland,
  and recorded his experiences in "The Irish Sketch-Book," which made its
  appearance the following year.</p>

  <p class="note">Thackeray, who for some time had been a member of the Garrick
  Club, was elected to the Reform in 1840, being proposed by Mr. Martin
  Thackeray and seconded by Mr. Henry Webbe. Sir Wemyss Reid gives an
  interesting description of the author at this Club. "Again and again I have
  heard descriptions of how he used to stand in the smoking-room, his back to
  the fire, his legs rather wide apart, his hands thrust into the
  trouser-pockets, and his head stiffly thrown backward, while he joined in the
  talk of the men occupying the semi-circle of chairs in front of him...To some
  of us, at least, the Club is endeared by the thought that he was once one of
  ourselves; that he sat in these chairs, dined at these tables, chatted in
  these rooms, and, with his wise, far-seeing eyes surveyed the world from
  these same windows."</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn9"
     name="bn9"></a><b>The Strangers' Room, Reform Club</b></p>

  <p class="note">In the strangers' room at the Reform Club hangs a portrait of
  Thackeray by Samuel Laurence. On one side of it there stands a bust of Sir
  William Molesworth, on the other of Charles Buller. The latter seconded
  Thackeray when he was proposed by the Rev. W. Harness as a member of the
  Athenaeum on February 12th, 1846. Thackeray was elected to this Club in 1851
  under the rule which provides for the introduction of "persons of
  distinguished eminence in science, literature, or public services."</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn10"
     name="bn10"></a><b>No. 13, Young Street, Kensington</b></p>

  <p class="note">In 1846 Thackeray took a house at 13 (now 16), Young Street,
  Kensington, where he established a home for his daughters. "Vanity Fair,"
  "Pendennis," and "Esmond" were written there. "Vanity Fair" made its
  appearance in yellow covers, being brought out in monthly parts by Messrs.
  Bradbury &amp; Evans. The first number was issued in January 1847, the last
  in July 1848.</p>

  <p class="note">When passing his house in Young Street with Mr. J. T. Fields,
  the American publisher, Thackeray exclaimed, "Go down on your knees, you
  rogue, for here 'Vanity Fair' was penned, and I will go down with you, for I
  have a high opinion of that little production myself."</p>

  <p class="note">The first number of "Pendennis" appeared in November 1848,
  but the author's severe illness at the end of 1849 interrupted its
  publication, which was not concluded until 1850. "Pendennis" was followed by
  "Esmond" in 1852.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn11"
     name="bn11"></a><b>Mr. Michael Angelo Titmarsh as he appeared at Willis's
     Rooms</b></p>

  <p class="note">Whilst residing in Young Street Thackeray delivered his
  famous lectures on the English humorists at Willis's Rooms. An admirable
  caricature by John Leech is reproduced here from <i>The Month</i>
  representing Mr. Michael Angelo Titmarsh as he appeared in these rooms in his
  celebrated character of Mr. Thackeray:</p>

  <p class="note">"Mr. Thackeray, of Vanity Fair, announced a simple course of
  lectures on a purely literary subject; and for the reason that Mr. Thackeray,
  living entirely by his pen, was still recognised as a fine gentleman by
  all&mdash;and they were many&mdash;who knew him in private, so accordingly
  his room was filled by an audience as brilliant and fashionable, as
  intelligent and judicious&mdash;in fact, after the lecturer, the agreeable
  sight of the excellent set of people who gathered about him with such
  thoughtful attention was really an attraction."</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn12"
     name="bn12"></a><b>Château de Brequerecque, Boulogne-sur- Mer<br>
  No. 36, Onslow Square, Brompton</b></p>

  <p class="note">On October 30th, 1852, Thackeray set sail for the United
  States, where he remained until the spring of 1853. He lectured in various
  towns&mdash;New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, and Richmond
  amongst others. Upon his return to Europe he made a very short stay in
  London, and then proceeded to Switzerland, where the story of "The Newcomes"
  was, according to his own statement, "revealed to him somehow." Much of the
  novel was written abroad while its author was travelling in Germany,
  Switzerland, Italy, or staying at the Château de Brequerecque at Boulogne,
  where he is said to have evolved the noble figure of Colonel Newcome. The
  Château de Brequerecque lies pleasantly nestled in trees and shrubberies on
  the outskirts of the town, and is surrounded by a high wall screening it from
  public gaze. "The Newcomes" was completed at No. 36, Onslow Square, where
  Thackeray moved from Young Street in 1857. "The result of my father's
  furnishings," wrote Mrs. Richmond Ritchie of this residence, "was a pleasant,
  bowery sort of home, with green curtains and carpets, looking out upon the
  elm trees of Onslow Square. We lived for seven years at No. 36, and it was
  there he wrote the 'Lectures on the George's,' and the end of 'The Newcomes,'
  and 'The Virginians,' part of 'Philip,' and many of the 'Roundabout Papers.'
  His study was over the drawing-room, and looked out upon the elm
  trees."</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn13"
     name="bn13"></a> <b>The M.S. of "Denis Duval"<br>
  No. 2, Palace Green, Kensington, where Thackeray died<br>
  Thackeray's Grave at Kensal Green Cemetery</b></p>

  <p class="note">Thackeray stood for Parliament in the Oxford City division in
  July of 1857, but was defeated by a small majority. In 1860 he undertook the
  editorship of the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>, of which Messrs. Smith &amp;
  Elder had commenced publication in the January of that year. Though
  continuing to contribute to this magazine until the last, he retired from the
  editorship in April 1862, doubtless finding the work too exacting for his now
  failing health.</p>

  <p class="note">In the year 1861 the firm of Jackson &amp; Graham built for
  Thackeray the beautiful house at No. 2, Palace Green, Kensington, which alone
  of all his homes has the Society of Arts oval commemorative tablet inserted
  in its wall. An old house stood on the site at the time of purchase, but
  after careful consideration Thackeray wisely gave up the idea of repairing
  and adding to it, and erected in its place a fine mansion of red brick with
  stone facings in the style of Queen Anne. At this period, besides working for
  the <i>Cornhill</i> Thackeray was writing "Denis Duval," his last book, which
  remained unfinished. After several severe attacks of illness, the novelist
  died at his residence in Palace Green on December 23rd, 1863, and was
  interred at Kensal Green Cemetery on the 30th of the month. The Middle
  Temple, of which he was a member, requested that they might be allowed to
  bury him in the Temple, near the grave of Goldsmith. The offer was, however,
  declined. A bust of Thackeray by his friend. Baron Marochetti, was placed in
  Westminster Abbey.</p>

  <h2><a id="part4"
     name="part4">IV.&mdash;NOTES ON THE PORTRAITS OF THACKERAY</a></h2>

  <p class="note">Thackeray was striking in appearance, being over six feet in
  height and broad in proportion. He was erect in his gait and stalwart in
  bearing. His countenance was very expressive and capable of much dignity, and
  his peculiarly sweet smile, combined with a great gentleness of voice and
  manner, particularly endeared him to children. "Grand and stern and silent,"
  wrote Jerrold of him in later years, "a mighty form crowned with a massive,
  snow-haired head."</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="pn1"
     name="pn1"></a><b>W. M. Thackeray, from a drawing by Daniel Maclise about
     1840<br>
  W. M. Thackeray, from a painting by Frank Stone</b></p>

  <p class="note">Among the portraits of Thackeray in early manhood is the
  painting by Frank Stone, executed in 1836 about the time of his marriage with
  Miss Shawe. This picture has never been engraved.</p>

  <p class="note">In 1832 and 1833 Maclise made two beautiful drawings of
  Thackeray from life, depicting him as a fashionably dressed young man, seated
  in a <i>néglige</i> attitude, displaying a massive eyeglass. These are now in
  the Garrick Club. Some years later the same artist made another delicately
  pencilled sketch, which Thackeray himself very skilfully copied.</p>

  <p class="note">Of the various portraits by Samuel Laurence, the one of
  greatest interest is perhaps the chalk drawing executed in 1853 and here
  reproduced as a frontispiece.</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="pn2"
     name="pn2"></a><b>W. M. Thackeray, from the painting by Samuel Laurence in
     the National Portrait Gallery</b></p>

  <p class="note">Charlotte Brontë, when she first saw this portrait,
  exclaimed, "And there came up a lion out of Judah." Later she wrote: "My
  father stood for a quarter of an hour this morning examining the great man's
  picture. The conclusion of his survey was that he thought it a puzzling head;
  if he had known nothing previously of the original's character, he could not
  have read it in his features. I wonder at this. To me the broad brow seems to
  express intellect. Certain lines about the nose and cheek betray the satirist
  and cynic; the mouth indicates a child-like simplicity, perhaps even a degree
  of irresoluteness, inconsistency&mdash;weakness, in short, but a weakness not
  unamiable."</p>

  <p class="note">A replica of the painting by the same artist in the National
  Portrait Gallery was presented by Thackeray to Sir Frederick Pollock, and
  remained for many years in the possession of the Dowager Lady
  Pollock.</p><br>

  <p class="note">In the National Portrait Gallery is also a bust modelled in
  terra-cotta by Sir Edgar Boehm from the original plaster mould by Joseph
  Durham, A.R.A., which was presented to the Garrick Club. And the same
  sculptor executed in 1860 a statuette for which Thackeray when in Paris gave
  only two short sittings of half an hour's duration. "The eminent sculptor,"
  writes Mr. F. G. Kitton in the <i>Magazine of Art</i>, "even in that space of
  time succeeded in all but completing one of the most successful portraits of
  his subject ever attempted." "The work of Sir John Millais possesses
  exceptional interest," continues the same writer, "and especially may this be
  said of a full-length delineation by that master-hand of his famous literary
  contemporary. Although but a slight memory-sketch, it is very characteristic
  of the man, and the portraiture so very life-like and true that Sir Edgar
  Boehm derived from it considerable assistance when completing his excellent
  statuette of the novelist."</p><br>

  <p class="note"><a id="pn4"
     name="pn4"></a><b>Thackeray, from a drawing by Richard Doyle<br>
  Thackeray, from a painting by Sir John Gilbert, R.A.</b></p>

  <p class="note">The posthumous portrait of Thackeray painted by Sir John
  Gilbert, R. A., was amongst those presented to the Garrick Club. It
  represents the novelist with long white hair and spectacles seated at a small
  table on which tea-things are displayed. In the background appears
  Stanfield's picture of a Dutch vessel, which may still be seen in one of the
  Club apartments.</p>

  <p class="note">The pencil drawing taken from the life by Richard Doyle,
  which is now in the British Museum, is an interesting and very characteristic
  sketch of the novelist.</p>

  <p class="poem">He was a cynic; you might read it writ<br>
  In that broad brow, crowned with its silver hair;<br>
  In those blue eyes, with childlike candour lit,<br>
  In the sweet smile his lips were wont to wear.<br>
  <br>
  A cynic? Yes&mdash;if 'tis the cynic's part<br>
  To track the serpent's trail, with saddened eye,<br>
  To mark how good and ill divide the heart,<br>
  How lives in chequered shade and sunshine lie.</p>
