<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. &mdash; THE TRADER FROM HOICHOW.</h2>

<p class="first">AT eight and thirty years of age Chester
Hardacre was a well set-up, good-looking man, with good features
and large, fearless blue eyes. The general impression of his
face, however, was not altogether a pleasant one, for it was
hard and grim, giving the idea, and quite rightly, too, that he
would be relentless and without any scruples whatsoever in
getting all he wanted in any way and at all costs. There was
certainly no appearance of sympathy or pity about him.</p>

<p>Of strong personality, he was a well-known character in
Hoichow, the chief seaport of Hainan Island, only a few miles
distant from the mainland of China, where he had been a trader
for fifteen years. He carried on quite a successful business in
his large store and, indeed, would have been a rich man but that
gambling was the ruling passion of his life. He had left many
thousands of pounds on the racecourse of Hongkong, only a day
and a night's journey away, and he was reckless, too, in the
amount of money he risked at cards.</p>

<p>A man of most violent and uncontrollable temper, he was a
master to be feared, and once, for some trifling offence, had so
badly beaten up one of his house-boys that the latter had died
two days afterwards. The Chinese population were furious and it
had required all the influence of the white community on the
island and the passing over of a considerable sum of money, to
hush up the matter and stay the authorities from taking
action.</p>

<p>From a strictly moral point of view, Hardacre, too, was
hardly what purists would have called a good man. He was
unmarried, but his big bungalow above the harbour was never
without its chatelaine. His male friends, when they were calling
upon him accompanied by their wives or daughters, made it a
matter of routine when approaching his bungalow to honk loudly
upon the horns of their cars in order to give warning so that
the ruling favourite might be discreetly spirited away into one
of the back rooms.</p>

<p>Many women, native, of course, had flitted across his life,
for he was always changing them in a casual, off-hand way.
Undoubtedly, however, of all who had ever taken his wayward
fancy he had been most partial to Winna Mee, and that, probably,
because as a new acquisition, contrary to the usual meekness of
her race, she had furiously resisted his advances.</p>

<p>A lovely Chinese girl, beautiful as a just-budding rose and
dainty as a piece of rare porcelain, her small body was lithe
and beautifully proportioned. She was sold to him somewhat late
in her life, as she was nearly fifteen when he bought her from
her parents for the equivalent of £20 English money. She was not
disposed, however, to be so casually handed over to a stranger
so many years older than herself, particularly as she already
had a lover in her own village.</p>

<p>So, when the £20 had been paid over and she had been
deposited in the bungalow like a load of sugar-cane or a
consignment of cotton, she had, at first, been as difficult to
handle as a wild cat. Only amused, however, at her furious
attempts to repulse him, the trader had quickly shown her who
was master and, her nails closely clipped so that there should
be no more scratching, in a few days she had seemingly become
resigned to her fate. Still, it was a long while before Hardacre
allowed her to prepare any of his food. He had no wish to wake
up in the night in the dreadful agony of bamboo spines piercing
through his intestines.</p>

<p>However, he came to trust her at last, and that was after one
night when he had caught her old lover prowling round the
bungalow with a most business-like looking Gurkha dagger naked
in his hand. The man was a sailor and, just returned from a long
sea voyage, he had learnt only that day that his lady-love had
been so callously disposed of. He was no weakling and for some
dangerous and thrilling moments the trader had fought him with
bare hands. In the end, however, he had succeeded in getting his
dagger away and had then given him a severe thrashing, sending
him off with a contemptuous kick and not deigning to hand him
over to the police.</p>

<p>Winna Mee had been an interested spectator of the struggle,
trembling as to what would be the outcome, but when the trader
returned victoriously into the bungalow her eyes glowed in her
excitement and she looked at him as she had never done before.
Then, suddenly, she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him
passionately in the way he had taught her. A veritable child of
the jungle, she had been won in the jungle fashion and would be
faithful to him henceforth, without any reservation. After that
night she was his devoted slave, all her coldness disappeared
and she was ardent and ever ready with her caresses.</p>

<p>For nearly two years she reigned in the bungalow and, such
was her fascination for him, during that time Hardacre's
affections never wandered. Her flower-like beauty seemed to grow
upon him and he thought he would never be tired of looking at
her. His happiest hours were when he was with her.</p>

<p>Then the great catastrophe occurred and at once all his
obsession for her turned a complete somersault and he became
most unjustifiably and unreasonably angry.</p>

<p>She told him she was going to bear him a child.</p>

<p>Now in the circles in which Hardacre moved, in the white
man's club and the general social life of Europeans on the
island, it was of no account for a European to live with a
native girl. Indeed, it was considered as quite the natural
thing for an unmarried man to do. It became, however, a very
different matter if the girl had a baby by him. Then it was
regarded as letting down the whole white community and bringing
discredit upon their class.</p>

<p>So when the trader found what was going to happen, his
fondness for Winna Mee vanished at once, and with no delay he
prepared to bundle her out neck and crop, hoping the matter
would not become generally known to his friends and
acquaintances. At first, the girl was all tears and frenzied
lamentations, but, upon learning that Hardacre was going to
endow her with twice her purchase price, she speedily became in
part consoled. Forty pounds was a tremendous sum to her and she
would return to her village as a queen with the spoils of
victory thick upon her. Not only was she going to bear a white
man's child, but, with the money she possessed, she would be
able to acquire property which would go a long way towards
keeping her in comfort for the rest of her life. Added to that,
she knew her prestige would soon enable her to get a husband
agreeable to her choice.</p>

<p>So Winna Mee went out of Hardacre's life, as he thought for
ever, and in a few weeks another girl reigned in her place. The
time passed on, and then, when Winna Mee had been gone for
nearly years, happening to pass through the village from where
she had come, in mild curiosity he made inquiries about her. To
his intense horror, he learnt that, only a few months before,
she had shown signs of leprosy, and was now an inmate of a leper
settlement.</p>

<p>His reaction to the news was, at first, only one of intense
sympathy for the girl, and a great wave of tenderness surged
through him as he recalled how lovely she had been in those
first days when she had come to him. With a dreadful pang he
thought of the ravages the hideous disease would in time make
upon her beautiful young body. He had seen many lepers since he
had come to live on Hainan Island, and some of them had been so
loathsome to look at that for days afterwards they had haunted
his dreams.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, a most terrifying possibility avalanched
itself into his mind and his face went ashen-grey with fear.
Why, for nearly two years he had been in actual contact with her
day upon day, and night after night she had lain in his arms!
God, the awful disease was infectious! She might have had it in
its early stages when she had been living with him! She might
have given it to him and, perhaps, for months and months the
dread bacilli had been coursing through his arteries and
veins!</p>

<p>He almost choked in his consternation. It was common
knowledge that one might contract the disease and yet show no
sign of it for as long a period as seven years. Seven years, and
it was only just two since he had sent her away!</p>

<p>The next night at the club he got into conversation with a
young doctor, and inquired, as casually as he could make out,
about leprosy. The doctor had not been long in the East, but for
all that he seemed to know a lot about the disease. "A damned
nasty business," he said, "and if I got it I think I'd shoot
myself. Oh, yes, you can catch it by contact. You get the leprae
bacilli from an infected person on your skin, and then, with the
smallest scratch, the bugs get underneath and you're booked. You
can get it in another way, too, for the bugs can enter through
the mucous membrane of the nose and throat."</p>

<p>Hardacre's hands became cold and clammy, and he furtively
wiped the beads of sweat from his forehead.</p>

<p>In the months which followed, the trader became intensely
nervy and irritable. He lost weight, and his friends kept
telling him he didn't look well. And in time he began to feel
anything but well. He was thoroughly out of sorts and had
dreadful sleepless nights. He lost all pleasure in his food, but
made up for it by drinking spirits by the bottle. He was always
thinking about leprosy, and half a dozen times a day would strip
himself and search for a white spot somewhere upon his skin.</p>

<p>His temper became worse and worse, and he was always making
out people were insulting him. His friends and acquaintances
took to avoiding him as much as possible, and there were even
whispers that he was going to be asked to resign from the
club.</p>

<p>A climax came there one evening when another member accused
him of cheating at cards. Quick as a flash of lightning,
Hardacre picked up a heavy decanter and struck his accuser
straight in the face. The decanter broke and he jabbed at him
with the broken stem, severing one of the big arteries in the
neck. Notwithstanding that the man was obviously mortally
wounded, Hardacre threw himself upon him and gripped him
fiercely by the throat. It took all the efforts of four men to
pull him away and, struggling violently, the trader had
ultimately to be bound hand and foot to prevent him doing
further mischief. The man he had attacked passed away during the
struggle.</p>

<p>Of course there was no chance of the matter being hushed up,
for the dead man was an important official of a big trading
concern, and so Hardacre was at once handed over to the
authorities for trial and punishment. But while there was not
the slightest sympathy for him and everyone would have liked to
see him decapitated in the Chinese fashion, it was realized what
a dreadful blow it would be to white prestige if that happened.
So the two British doctors on the island, much to the trader's
fury, certified him as insane and recommended he be put away in
an asylum.</p>

<p>That, however, did not satisfy the authorities and they were
adamant that he should stand his trial. Seeing that there was no
help for it, certain members of his one-time friends then
started to make arrangements for him to escape from custody and
be smuggled out of the island.</p>

<p>Under a power of attorney given by the trader, his business
was sold for £2,000 and part of the money used in bribes to
further his escape. One night the bars of his cell were filed
through for him and the next morning found him well out to sea
in a small fishing boat and heading for the coast of French
Indo-China. He reached there without mishap and some weeks later
had made his way round to Rangoon. From there it was not
difficult to get to Calcutta and finally, travelling third
class, he took ship by a P. &amp; O. liner for England.</p>

<p>The voyage undoubtedly unproved his health but, a most
unusual thing for him, he found himself suffering a lot from
headaches, and though there were certainly no outward signs of
the dread disease upon him, he was still worried, thinking he
was in its early stages.</p>

<p>He had decided what he would do and was determining to
consult the best authority upon tropical diseases in London. He
would not tell him he was terrified he had got leprosy, but
would approach him in the ordinary way, as a man who had just
returned from the tropics and was feeling very much off colour.
He would let the doctor find out for himself what was the matter
with him, giving no help to diagnose any possible complaint.</p>

<p>Arriving in London with just over £1,400 and intending to
husband his resources as much as possible, he put up at a cheap
coffee tavern in Theobald's Road. The neighbourhood was poor,
but the coffee tavern had been recommended to him as being cheap
and clean by one of the stewards on the boat. It was called
"Benson's Hall" and, ashamed to be staying at such a place, he
registered under the name of George Hunter. Chester Hardacre, he
prided himself, was a high-sounding name and, he thought, it
would be ridiculous in such surroundings.</p>

<p>From a London directory he learnt that a Dr. Humphrey Monk
was the chief consulting physician of the School of Tropical
Medicine in the East End, and he decided he would be a good man
to go to, arguing that the doctor must be of high standing to be
occupying such a position.</p>

<p>Accordingly, after having had to wait a couple of days for an
appointment because the doctor was out of Town, one morning he
was ushered into a beautifully-appointed consulting room in a
big old-world home in Cavendish Square.</p>

<p>Dr. Monk was a smallish man of slight build, but for all that
he looked brimful of dynamic energy. About sixty years of age,
he had a high forehead and big, very shrewd grey eyes set deeply
under big bushy brows. Waving Hardacre to a chair, he seated
himself at a desk and, taking an index card from a pigeon-hole,
at once asked him for his name and address. Hardacre gave his
name as Charles Henson and, somewhat awed by his surroundings
and surmising from them that the doctor's charges would be very
high for all who could pay them, flushing slightly as he did so,
said he was staying at the Theobald's Road coffee tavern. He was
hoping a smaller fee would then be expected of him. The
preliminaries over, the doctor asked what the trouble was which
had brought Hardacre to him.</p>

<p>The trader had many times rehearsed the story he was
intending to tell and he told it straightforwardly and with no
hesitation.</p>

<p>He said he had but recently returned from equatorial Africa
where he had been living for a few years. He had been feeling
seedy for a long time, generally run-down and suffering a lot of
headaches. His body also ached a bit, chiefly in his bones.</p>

<p>The doctor listened attentively and asked him several
questions. Then he told him to strip to the waist to allow of
his examining his heart and lungs carefully. Afterwards he made
him take off the rest of his clothes, and minutely went over
every inch of his body.</p>

<p>At length, pointing to a small spot on one of his shins, he
asked him how long it had been there, and Hardacre replied he
had not noticed it before, adding it was probably a bite from an
insect. There had been plenty about in the boat and they had
annoyed him a lot.</p>

<p>Making no comment, the doctor took a bottle out of a cupboard
and proceeded to drop a minute quantity of the liquid it
contained first upon the spot itself, and then upon the
adjoining skin an inch and more away.</p>

<p>"I shan't hurt you," he said. "You won't feel anything," and
with a needle he made two little pricks where he had dropped the
liquid. He wiped drops of liquid away, and for a long minute
stood intently regarding the skin. He motioned to Hardacre to
resume his clothes.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes or so of silence followed, before the
trader, fully dressed again, was back in his chair. The doctor
spoke very quietly. "I don't want to distress you
unnecessarily," he said, "but I want to know if, within the past
few years"&mdash;he spoke very slowly&mdash;"you happen to have
been brought into contact with anyone known to have been
suffering from leprosy?"</p>

<p>Hardacre's heart almost stood still. A dreadful mist arose
before his eyes and his mouth went dry. So his awful fears were
confirmed. This doctor was diagnosing leprosy when he had not
been given the slightest pointer in that direction. It was many
seconds before he found his voice, and then he whispered
hoarsely: "Yes."</p>

<p>The doctor frowned. "Then you had that trouble in your mind
when you decided to consult me," he said. He nodded. "Still it
was a good thing I had the opportunity of making an independent
diagnosis without any help from you."</p>

<p>"But have I leprosy?" faltered Hardacre through his dry lips.
"Do you think I am infected?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't say that for certain yet," replied the doctor
quickly. "There will be nothing definite until I find the actual
leprae bacilli in you. I shall have to see if there are any in
that little spot you've got there on your shin."</p>

<p>"But I thought," said Hardacre tremblingly, "that leprosy
began with a white patch somewhere on the skin."</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head. "Not always. It can first show
itself in a brown spot or pimple such as that one you have." He
spoke impressively. "Now, tell me when you were actually in
contact with this leprous person, and how close was the
contact."</p>

<p>"It began as long as nearly five years ago," said the trader,
"and it lasted for not quite two years. I have not been near the
person for getting on for three years."</p>

<p>"But three years does not make you safe," commented the
doctor, shaking his head. "We have no certain knowledge as to
how many years may elapse between acquiring the disease and it
beginning to show itself, but there are well-authenticated cases
where the time has been over ten years. Who was this person you
may have got it from&mdash;a native, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a native woman," replied Hardacre huskily.</p>

<p>"A servant?" queried the doctor.</p>

<p>Hardacre hesitated. "More than that," he said. He spoke
almost defiantly. "She was living with me in my bungalow."</p>

<p>"Ah, and if she were infected herself," nodded the doctor,
"that would have given ample opportunity for her to infect you.
Did you get rid of her because you found out she was sick?"</p>

<p>"No, for other reasons," was the reply, "and it was not until
two years afterwards that I learnt she had recently been taken
ill and put in a leprosorium," and he went on to explain how he
had come to find out what had happened to Winna Mee. "But do you
honestly think, sir," he concluded with his voice shaking, "that
I am really a leper?"</p>

<p>"I've already told you I can't tell with any certainty until
I've dealt with the contents of that spot," said the doctor a
little testily. His voice dropped to a more sympathetic tone.
"Still, I can't hold out much hope that you are not, for
undoubtedly you have some of the symptoms of early leprosy.
Besides, that little test which I made just now makes things
look very ominous."</p>

<p>"But nothing happened," frowned Hardacre.</p>

<p>"No, that's exactly it," nodded the doctor. "Nothing
<i>did</i> happen, and if it were certain you were leprosy free,
something should have happened. It was histamine, which comes
from ergot, which I put on your skin and, after I had pricked
it, within a few seconds I should have seen a pronounced
reddening of the skin. But, as you saw, we didn't get any
reddening at all and that's what makes me suspicious."</p>

<p>A few minutes later, after he had obtained some of the
contents of the spot, he dismissed Hardacre, enjoining him to
come back in two days' time. "Then I shall be able to tell you
for certain," he said, "and we shall have to decide what we must
do."</p>

<p>They were a miserable two days for the trader, and he was
white and shaky-looking when he returned two days later to
Cavendish Square. Directly he entered the consulting room he saw
by the expression upon the doctor's face what the verdict was
going to be.</p>

<p>Grave and unsmiling, the doctor said very quietly: "I am
sorry to tell you that we found leprosy bacilli in the specimen
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I am a doomed man!" choked Hardacre. "There's no hope
for me!"</p>

<p>"No, no, you mustn't say that," protested the doctor quickly.
"Indeed, there is a lot of hope for you if you take things in
the proper way. I won't deceive you by saying we know of any
specific cure, but I do assure you the disease is distinctly
amenable to treatment and only a very small percentage of
sufferers actually die of it. It is recognized now that it is a
self-healing disease, like small-pox and typhoid fever, but
while typhoid burns itself out in, say, twenty-one days, leprosy
may take twenty-one years. So, if you never actually get rid of
it, if you follow directions implicitly and keep up your general
health, you may hold it at bay for the remainder of your
life."</p>

<p>"I'll do anything," said Hardacre miserably, "but what is
there to do?"</p>

<p>"Lots of things. Firstly, you must hypnotize yourself into
the belief that you're not going to get worse, but, instead, you
are going to get better. So you mustn't brood over it, by no
means an impossible attitude of mind when you carry out the
routine I am going to lay down for you. You must build up your
health and strength in every possible way, and you must live a
good out-door life and get plenty of exercise and fresh air. You
must take up some hobby or occupation strenuously, to occupy
your mind."</p>

<p>"But aren't you going to give me any medicine?" asked
Hardacre, a little comforted by the doctor's words.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the doctor. "I'm going to put you on
strong doses of potassium iodide. They are getting splendid
results from it in India, better than from anything else. I'll
give you a prescription at once." He regarded the trader
curiously. "Now are you pretty well off?"</p>

<p>Hardacre frowned. "If I were should I be staying at the
address I gave you?" he asked bitterly. "No one could surely
imagine a man of means would be stopping anywhere near
Theobald's Road." He shook his head. "No, I have not much money
and I shall have to earn my living like most other people do.
But why do you ask?"</p>

<p>For a few moments the doctor hesitated. Then he said
thoughtfully: "I am wondering what can be done in your
particular case, for of course segregation will be imperative to
prevent you passing on the disease to others."</p>

<p>"Then am I infectious?" exclaimed Hardacre in a horrified
tone. "Can I infect other people?"</p>

<p>The doctor nodded. "Most assuredly you can. In the first
instance you probably became infected by that native girl from a
spot no bigger than the one you have now on your shin. Apart
from any spots, too, the secretions from the mucous membrane of
the nose and throat can infect as well." He nodded again. "Yes,
the early stages of the disease are considered the most
dangerous of all."</p>

<p>"Then what am I to do?" asked Hardacre, dreadful
possibilities of what might be going to happen to him
avalanching into his mind.</p>

<p>"Well, that depends upon what you can pay," replied the
doctor, "but, anyway, things will be arranged for you. You see,
in this country leprosy is not usually a notifiable infectious
disease but it happens to be so now, as several cases have come
to light recently in the Port of London. So, I shall have to
report your case at once to the Health Authorities and they will
deal with it according to your circumstances. That's why I asked
you if you were a man of any money." He spoke in business-like
tones. "You say you have a little! Well, if you could run to six
guineas a week, then there is a very exclusive little colony in
Wales which you could join. It is on an isolated part of the
coast in most ideal surroundings, and there would be plenty to
occupy your mind. You could fish and golf and there is good
shooting. At present there are about twenty men and women there,
all of a better class, and there's a good doctor in
attendance."</p>

<p>"But do you mean to say there is a leper colony in this
country?" asked Hardacre aghast.</p>

<p>"Certainly! Indeed there are several of them, but this one of
which I am speaking is the best. Now could you afford six
guineas a week?"</p>

<p>The trader could hardly find his voice. "For how long?" he
asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head. "That I can't say. It might be for
some time." He nodded. "So we shall have to wait until you are
lepra bacillus free before you can mix with the world
again."</p>

<p>He repeated his question. "Can you run to six guineas a
week?" A thought struck him and he turned to pull open one of
the drawers of his desk. "Ah, wait a moment! I have a photograph
of the place somewhere here and it may help you to make up your
mind, for you will see the surroundings are well worth the
money."</p>

<p>His search gave Hardacre time to think and his face puckered
up into an ugly scowl as he thought furiously and hard. Damn, he
had fallen into a trap and this doctor was going to hand him
over to a leprosorium, bound hand and foot! But he wasn't going
to have it. Blast it, he wouldn't! He would hide away somewhere
on his own and give himself the treatment the doctor was
prescribing! Hell, but he mustn't let the doctor know! He must
pretend to agree with him and cut off quick!</p>

<p>He forced a smile as the doctor, finding the photograph,
handed it across. "See, it's quite a nice place, well-appointed
and as comfortable as a hotel. Now, what do you say? You must
decide quickly, for you must go somewhere straightaway. We can't
have you left as a possible course of infection to others an
hour longer than can be helped."</p>

<p>Hardacre nodded. "All right, I'll go there," he said. "I can
at any rate manage it for two or three years and then hope for
the best."</p>

<p>"That's the spirit," exclaimed the doctor. "That gives you
the best chance of keeping it under. Now, I'll ring up the
Health people and they'll pick you up this afternoon. I'll
arrange it for, say, three o'clock. They'll put you up somewhere
to-night and have you motored down into Wales to-morrow." He
wrote rapidly at his desk. "Now here is the prescription for the
iodide of potassium, and you must start taking it at once." He
rose briskly to his feet. "And that's all now. I'm very pressed
for time. I'm off to Scotland directly after lunch for a
consultation." He smiled. "I shan't be seeing you again, and my
fee is seven guineas." Then, seeing what he took for a look of
astonishment upon the trader's face, he added: "That includes
the laboratory fee for making a culture of the bacilli."</p>

<p>Hardacre cursed under his breath. Seven guineas! It was an
extortion! It was barefaced robbery! Why, that morning he hadn't
been with him much more than ten minutes!</p>

<p>He paid over the money, noticing with some resentment that
the doctor handled the notes gingerly and put them at once into
an envelope by themselves. Also, to his annoyance, he ushered
him out of the consulting room without offering to shake
hands.</p>

<p>In the depths of depression at the doctor's verdict the
ex-trader made his way into the hall, but yet another, and an
almost greater shock this time, was to come to him, for, as the
street door was opened by the nurse attendant for him to pass
out, he came face to face with a young fellow who had just
arrived on the doorstep, and to his consternation recognized him
as a man he had known on Hainan Island. God, it was young Burton
from the British Consulate at Hoichow!</p>

<p>The young fellow did not seem to notice Hardacre at first and
addressed himself smilingly to the butler. "If my uncle is very
busy, Nurse," he said, "I won't stop. I'll come
another&mdash;&mdash;" but happening to glance in Hardacre's
direction, the words froze on his lips and he stared as if he
could not believe his eyes.</p>

<p>Hardacre had gone a sickly colour, but his face was
expressionless and he looked straight before him as if he had
not recognized the young man. With no hurry he passed out into
the street. His legs, however, were shaking under him and he was
trembling in his fright. What a most damnable piece of bad luck!
And this Burton was the doctor's nephew, too! It couldn't be
worse, for of course he would tell him everything and the police
would be upon his track at once!</p>

<p>Turning into the first public house he came to, two stiff
brandies did a lot towards steadying both his limbs and his
nerves, and he began to take a much more hopeful view of the
situation. After all, young Burton might not be quite certain he
had recognized him, but, if he had, what was there to back up
his word to convince anybody else? The police were not likely to
start upon an extensive search without having something definite
to go upon. Anyhow, extradition was always a lengthy business
and, besides, the Hoichow authorities might not be willing to
move in the matter. After all, the man who had been killed had
been a European and not a Chinese and that would certainly not
incline them to disturb themselves unduly.</p>

<p>Also, there was do doubt they had connived at his escape, or
it would not have been managed so easily, and any searching
inquiries would certainly bring to light that bribing had been
going on. The £500 he had paid would not have gone to only minor
officials. Undoubtedly someone high up had had his whack out of
it too. No, he had plenty of time to get away and hide, if he
did not panic and lose his head.</p>

<p>His thoughts reverted to the doctor and he sneered
contemptuously that he had deceived him all right. The fool was
certain he was going to allow himself to be segregated without
any protest, and he was equally as certain he was not. Long
before three o'clock he would have started for where no Health
Authorities would find him. It was only just after noon now and
so he had a good three hours to get clear.</p>

<p>As it happened, however, the trader was very much mistaken
about his having kept his real intentions from Dr. Monk. On the
contrary the latter was highly suspicious that his patient was
not intending to accept segregation so readily as he had tried
to make out, for, when searching in the drawer for the
photograph he had shown Hardacre, he had chanced to glance up
for a moment and in doing so had caught a fleeting glimpse of
the trader's face reflected in a mirror on the wall. Hardacre
was scowling sullenly, with something of the terror, the doctor
thought, of a trapped animal. Then, when the doctor had turned
round again with the photo in his hand, Hardacre's expression
was as quiet and resigned as before. The sudden change in the
expression had given the doctor a warning.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the moment his patient had left the consulting
room, the doctor phoned up the chief medical officer of the Port
of London, and told him all that had taken place.</p>

<p>"And I'm more than half inclined to think," he concluded,
"that he'll try to make a breakaway. He looks just that type of
man, accustomed to having his own way and impatient of all
restraint. So, I think you'd better pick him up as soon as you
possibly can. Good-bye, I can't stop. I've got to catch the
one-thirty from Euston and I've a lot to see to before that.
I've a consultation in Edinburgh to-night."</p>

<p>All unaware of the danger threatening him, Hardacre made his
way back to the coffee tavern, intending to pack his suitcase
and leave the place at once. The appetizing odour of roast pork,
however, assailed his nostrils directly he walked into the
place, and he decided to have dinner first. Strangely enough, he
was now quite hungry, and he felt very pleased with himself at
the way he was starting to stand up to his misfortune.</p>

<p>He made a good meal and was quite leisurely about it. Indeed,
it was well after one o'clock when he made his way into the
place to get his bill from the girl at the desk. Two men who had
come in quietly through the street door, however, reached the
desk just before him and, standing behind them, to his horror he
heard the name he had given to the doctor mentioned.</p>

<p>"We want to speak to Mr. Henson," said one of the men. "Is he
at dinner or will you give us the number of his room?"</p>

<p>"Henson!" exclaimed the girl. She shook her head. "There is
no Mr. Henson staying here."</p>

<p>"Oh, but there is," protested the man. "We are quite sure of
it. We were to meet him here. We have an appointment."</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "There's a mistake somewhere.
There's no one of that name staying here." She pushed a big book
across the counter. "Here's the register. Look for
yourself."</p>

<p>A very short survey of the book brought a frown to the man's
face, and he turned to his companion and whispered: "He's
diddled us as the doctor thought he would. He gave him a wrong
address." He turned back to the girl and asked sharply: "Anyone
come to stay here lately who'd got a fair bit of luggage with
him, as if he'd just arrived from abroad?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "People with much luggage don't
usually come here," she said with a smile, and Hardacre was
devoutly thankful he had left his two big leather trunks in the
cloakroom at St. Pancras Station.</p>

<p>"Well, phone up and get his description," growled the other
man to his companion. "He may be staying here but under another
name," and the first man at once walked over to the telephone
cabinet and shut himself in.</p>

<p>Hardacre had heard everything and, controlling himself with
an effort, sank weakly into a chair. The second man, waiting for
the result of the phone call, moved over across the hall and,
seating himself, took out a cigarette and commenced to smoke.
Then, his eyes happening to fall upon the trader, he proceeded
to stare hard and frowningly at him.</p>

<p>"The devil," muttered Hardacre in dreadful consternation, "he
sees I'm brown and look like someone from the tropics! He's
suspicious!"</p>

<p>And certainly the man did seem suspicious, for he kept his
eyes fixed on the trader. An idea, however, coming into
Hardacre's mind, he pulled himself together with another effort
and, rising leisurely to his feet, moved back to the desk.</p>

<p>"Give me a couple of your prospectuses, Miss," he said
quietly and, upon her complying at once with his request, he
strolled over with them in his hand to the man who was
continuing to regard him so intently.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," he said with a polite bow, "but will you
accept these little tariff cards of ours. You might, perhaps, be
able to recommend us to your friends." He smiled pleasantly. "I
am Mr. Benson, the proprietor of the coffee tavern."</p>

<p>Instantly the frowning expression upon the man's face
relaxed. "Certainly," he said, "and I'll give them to anyone I
think they may interest." He lowered his voice mysteriously.
"But I say, Mr. Benson, are you sure you've not had a man here
lately who looks as if he'd just come from abroad? I mean a man
who's been living in equatorial Africa."</p>

<p>Hardacre considered. "Not lately," he replied with a shake of
his head, "at least not within the last few weeks." He winked
knowingly. "Police work, is it?"</p>

<p>"Not at present," said the man. He nodded. "But it might turn
out to be."</p>

<p>They chatted for a couple of minutes and then the first man
came out of the telephone cabinet. From his expression it was
plain his telephoning had not brought much result.</p>

<p>"No good," he said disgustedly to his companion, and not
troubling to lower his voice, "the doctor's gone off to Scotland
and his damned nurse has got two days' holiday and cleared out.
They don't know where to get in touch with her." He swore
angrily. "Come on, it's no good stopping here any longer," and
to Hardacre's intense thankfulness, they went out and got into a
waiting car.</p>

<p>An hour and a half later the trader, having recovered his
trunks from the cloakroom of St. Pancras Station, was taking a
ticket at Liverpool Street for Burnham, a quiet little town on
the banks of the River Crouch.</p>

<p>Two days later, upon his return from Scotland, Dr. Monk rang
up the chief medical officer of the Port of London again to
inquire how things had gone with his patient and was most
astonished to learn what had happened.</p>

<p>"As I told you," he said, "I was half expecting he would try
to get away, but I can't understand why you didn't find him at
that coffee palace. I am almost certain he was stopping there,
because the first time I saw him, when he took off his clothes
for me to make an examination, a card fell out of his jacket
pocket and, as I picked it up to hand back to him, I saw it was
one showing the tariff charged at Benson's Hall. It may be, of
course, that he was there under a different name, and I should
say now that that is very likely, as he was a proud sort of man
and seemed rather bitter at having to put up at a cheap place
like a coffee palace."</p>

<p>"It was a mistake I didn't ask you for a full description of
him," said the medical officer. "It was very careless of me.
Let's have it now."</p>

<p>"Well, he was tall and well-built," said the doctor, "and not
at all a bad-looking fellow. Clean-shaven and bronzed, though
not as sun-burnt as most people would be who had lived in the
tropics, as he stated, for ten years. Still, you could tell he'd
been living abroad. By the by, a nephew of mine happened to run
into him as he was leaving my house and at first was very
positive he was a man he had known on Hainan Island just off the
mainland of China. He says the chap had been arrested some six
months ago for killing a fellow-member of their club in Hoichow,
but had bribed his way out of prison and escaped."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;wanted for murder?" exclaimed the medical
officer.</p>

<p>"Something like it. The other man was killed in a brawl over
a dispute at cards."</p>

<p>"And did he know your nephew had recognized him?" asked the
medical officer sharply.</p>

<p>"My nephew isn't certain," replied the doctor. "At any rate
the man didn't show it and that makes my nephew not so positive
now." He laughed. "Or at any rate he says he's not so positive,
though I'm half inclined to think his uncertainty is because, if
this fellow is the wanted man, the white community in Hoichow
would not like the scandal of his being brought back. In fact, I
believe my nephew is sorry now he mentioned anything about him
to me."</p>

<p>"Hum," remarked the medical officer. "Well, it's nothing to
do with us, but I'll send my men again to the coffee palace,
although I think it's quite hopeless now."</p>

<p>The two men duly arrived at Benson Hall and asked to see the
proprietor.</p>

<p>"Want to see Mr. Benson," demanded the elder, planting
himself in front of the desk, where the girl clerk had smiled as
she recognized them.</p>

<p>"Mr. Benson?" she queried, looking rather puzzled. "There's
no Mr. Benson staying here."</p>

<p>"I mean the boss," said the man sharply, "the proprietor of
the Hall."</p>

<p>"But there's no proprietor," explained the girl. "It belongs
to a company. Mrs. Williams is the manageress. Shall I fetch
her?"</p>

<p>The man frowned heavily. He indicated his colleague. "But
this gentleman spoke to Mr. Benson when he came here the other
day. He gave him two of his tariff cards." He spoke angrily.
"Where is Mr. Benson? What's the mystery about him?"</p>

<p>The girl looked rather frightened. "There's no mystery, sir,"
she replied, "but the Mr. Benson who once owned the place has
been dead more than twenty years."</p>

<p>The other man stepped forward. "Look here, Miss," he said
persuasively, "we want that gentleman I was talking to the other
day, the one who came over to you and got those tariff cards to
give me. He was a Mr. Benson, wasn't he? He told me he was."</p>

<p>The girl smiled all over her face now. "No, no," she said
quickly, "he was just one of the gentlemen staying here. His
name was George Hunter."</p>

<p>"Hell," exclaimed the first man, "then where is he now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he left us a few minutes after he'd given your friend
our cards," said the girl. "He went up and got his suitcase at
once, and was gone almost immediately." She wanted to smile but
was afraid to, because, the truth beginning to dawn upon them,
the two men were both looking so angry.</p>

<p>A short hard silence followed and then the girl added
timidly: "Yes, and he may have been the very gentleman you came
to inquire about, although he had given his name here as Hunter.
We believe he must have come from abroad quite recently, because
the chambermaid who did his room tells us now that his pyjamas
had a tag on them with the name of some firm in a foreign
country."</p>

<p>For many moments the two men were so dumbfounded in their
anger at the way they realized now they had been tricked, that
they did not speak. Then the elder said hoarsely: "Thank you,
Miss. We are much obliged. That's all we wanted to know," and
without another word they turned away and walked out into the
street.</p>

<p>"We'll never catch him now," said one of them as they were
driving off in their car. "He's too damned clever for us." He
laughed mirthlessly. "The blasted impudence of him! But why the
hell didn't the doctor think of giving us his description in the
first instance?" and his colleague shrugged his shoulders
disgustedly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. &mdash; THE OLD MILL.</h2>

<p class="first">IN the meanwhile Hardacre was settling down
somewhat uneasily in a little inn just outside Burnham, right on
the muddy banks of the River Crouch. Of all places in which to
hide away he had chosen Burnham because, as a boy, he had once
spent a holiday there, and it had always remained in his memory
as one of the quietest places he had been in.</p>

<p>Surrounded in every direction by boggy Essex flats, except in
summer and then only for a few weeks, the district was as lonely
and unfrequented as anyone could wish, the only permanent
inhabitants being a few fishermen and some farmers with very
small holdings.</p>

<p>He had remembered, too, a lonely little inn which stood all
by itself about half a mile out of the town on its seaward side
and, when he had been driven there that cold and misty evening,
his heart sank in dismay at its desolate appearance.</p>

<p>Inside the inn, however, everything looked comfortable and
clean, and the man and his wife who kept it were delighted when
Hardacre informed them that, if the accommodation and the
cooking were satisfactory, he might be staying for some time. He
said he had but recently recovered from a serious illness and, a
writer by profession, he wanted perfect peace and quiet.</p>

<p>The inn-keeper assured him with a grin that he would have all
the quiet he wanted, as in the winter, from one week's end to
another, no customers except an occasional fisherman and an odd
farm-hand or two came in for refreshment.</p>

<p>That night, after a well-cooked and nicely served meal,
washed down by two bottles of good beer, Hardacre took stock of
his position, and, but for the fear that the Health Authorities
might be putting detectives after him, he would have been by no
means' in a depressed state of mind.</p>

<p>A shrewd, intelligent man, he had fully taken in all that the
doctor had told him regarding his complaint, and that leprosy,
like tuberculosis, would not flourish in healthy and well-nourished
bodies. So he was confident then that he would be able
to keep the disease at bay and had even hopes that in time he
would throw it off altogether. As for what the Health people
would do, well, he would just have to chance things there. If
they were, indeed, to start upon an intensive search for him, he
was hoping they would have expected him to have hidden away in
some crowded city and not for one moment have gone to a little
country town so near to the great Metropolis.</p>

<p>Anyhow, he would keep himself as much out of sight as
possible and, when out for exercise and fresh air, take his
walks where he was not likely to meet many people. He remembered
there were nearly five miles of lonely and almost uninhabited
country along the river bank towards the sea, and so there would
be many chances against him coming upon any curious strangers.
Also, he would grow a beard and that would soon make his
appearance very different from any description which might have
been given about him.</p>

<p>As to how he was going to earn his living, that would have to
wait a while. He had nearly £1,400 in good English bank-notes
sewn up in his belt and, at any rate, living economically they
would provide for him for three or four years. Of an
enterprising and go-ahead disposition, long before the money was
spent he was certain he would have thought out some profitable
occupation to follow.</p>

<p>In the days which followed, time did not hang nearly so
heavily upon his hands as he had been expecting, and after the
first rather anxious weeks, he became confident he was safe and
would not now be discovered. The innkeeper and his wife were an
unlettered incurious couple, and the few strangers he
encountered upon his walks, after wishing him polite good-days,
seemed to take no further interest in him.</p>

<p>When January came and the trader had been at the inn three
months, he was satisfied with his condition of health, and quite
sure the drug he had been most religiously taking was doing him
good. Certainly, two more little spots had come out on his shin,
but they were very small ones, and the first spot did not seem
to have grown any bigger. In himself, too, he was feeling much
better and his appetite was good.</p>

<p>With the coming of early spring, however, he thought it would
not be safe to go on staying in Burnham much longer. Certainly,
the rough bearded fellow he looked now was very different from
the well-dressed patient who had consulted Dr. Monk. Still, he
was not intending to take any chances, and he remembered having
seen a large stuffed trout in a glass case in the doctor's
consulting room. So it might be the doctor was an enthusiastic
fisherman and, the million to one chance eventuating, he might
one day come down to Burnham to fish in the Crouch.</p>

<p>Besides, he felt there was another reason why he must leave
the place. Although the charges at the inn were very moderate,
he was not living anything like as cheaply as he had expected he
would. He found he could not do without luxuries, and had taken
to sending up to Town for expensive delicatessen foods and cases
of good champagne, with a dozen bottles of the wine often not
lasting him a fortnight. Also, he must have the most expensive
Egyptian cigarettes, and he could easily get through from thirty
to forty of them in a day.</p>

<p>So he realized he must start earning money, but in exactly
what way he had no idea until one came to him from a poultry-farmer
whose place, about three miles from Burnham, he used to
pass on his lonely walks in the direction of the sea. He had
often noticed the man at work, but for a long while nothing more
had passed between them than a wave of the hand. Then one day
the man came running up to him to borrow a box of matches and,
after a short conversation, asked him to come and look at his
birds.</p>

<p>Rather bored, Hardacre complied with his request, and to his
surprise, found himself interested at once. The poultry farm was
small, but most methodically kept and, even to the trader's
inexperienced eyes, contained some magnificent birds.</p>

<p>The man appeared to be delighted to have someone to talk to,
and said he was doing well, very well and&mdash;with a
grin&mdash;much better than he would like the Income Tax people
to know. He said he had been there six years, but had only just
learnt the secret of success and that was to sell his birds at a
high price.</p>

<p>"You know," he explained, "I came to realize it is much
easier to sell a live bird for a guinea than a dead one for
three and six. So, I go in for stud birds now and breed from
only the very best. I sell no hens under a guinea and ask five
for my roosters. I am beginning to get known and people from all
over the country buy from me. These Indian Game are my
speciality. Lovely birds, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"They are indeed," agreed Hardacre. "They look quite up to
exhibition standard."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I take prizes with them all over East Anglia,"
nodded the poultry-farmer. He frowned disgustedly. "But more
often than not only second ones, because there is one man who
always beats me when he enters any of his birds, Indian Game,
the same as mine. Still, the chap is in a big way and has more
than two thousand birds to pick from. That gives him a big pull
over us little chaps. He is a clergyman in Ingatestone."</p>

<p>"But can't you breed from his strain?" asked Hardacre.
"Doesn't he sell any of his eggs?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he sells them, right enough," nodded the man. "He
often sends away a couple of hundred dozen in one batch." He
scowled. "But the old devil pricks every blooming eggshell with
a needle, so that none of the eggs will hatch out."</p>

<p>"Gad, what a selfish brute!" exclaimed Hardacre. "It would
serve him right if someone broke in and stole a dozen sittings.
I know I'd do it if I wanted them."</p>

<p>"And I might do it, too," laughed the man, "if it were
anything of a soft job, but he's got high fences all round his
place and fierce dogs are turned loose on guard at night."</p>

<p>Returning thoughtfully to the inn, Hardacre considered
everything the poultry-farmer had told him and, always quick and
even hasty in his decisions, before he dropped off to sleep that
night had quite made up his mind that poultry raising was the
very occupation he had been looking for. He knew he was a good
organizer and a good man of business, and that, when he put all
his energies into anything, he invariably made a success of
it.</p>

<p>So, keeping his intentions to himself, he took to making
daily visits to the poultry farm, watching the man at his work,
seeing how he handled the birds, and, with judicious
questioning, learning from where he bought his supplies and what
he paid for them. The man was a bachelor, living by himself, and
was most flattered at the interest the trader took, lending him
books, too, on poultry, and never seeming weary of explaining
things to him.</p>

<p>In a few weeks Hardacre was confident he knew enough to start
for himself and, buying a bicycle, he began taking long journeys
all round the country-side to find a suitable place to begin
operations. After a lot of looking about, he thought he had at
last found what he wanted in a little property of about six
acres, some seven miles from Manningtree and a little more than
two miles from the village of Great Bromley. It was known as
Benger's Flat and its situation he considered ideal, as its
surroundings were very lonely, with no other habitation within a
mile. There was an old water mill on the property and a rambling
old house in a rather bad state of repair, with every window in
it broken.</p>

<p>The mill had not been in use for many years and the property
was part of the estate of an old lady who had died about a year
previously. Her executors were anxious to get it off their
hands, for no buyer had come forward and, indeed, not a single
offer had been made. The estate agent in Manningtree, who
secretly was delighted to have anyone now making inquiries about
the place, told Hardacre the price was £1,000, as certain water
rights went with the mill and the land was valuable.</p>

<p>"Valuable, fiddlesticks!" commented Hardacre scoffingly. "If
the place is worth anything like that figure, why has it been
left to go to wrack and ruin all this time? My offer is six
hundred pounds, and not a penny more." And get it for the £600
he eventually did, the agent having averred it was the cheapest
place he had ever sold.</p>

<p>Saying not a word to anyone in Burnham, Hardacre commissioned
a builder to make the house habitable, and then called in a
carpenter to fix up poultry sheds, exactly after the style of
those of his poultry-farmer friend. Finally, one morning he left
the little town on the Crouch as quietly and unostentatiously as
he had arrived, with not a soul knowing where he was going.
Through the medium of advertisements in a poultry journal, he
stocked his pens with some of the best birds he could buy, and
settled down to what, he told himself, should be poultry raising
in a scientific way.</p>

<p>He had been hoping he would be quite content with his new
life, but speedily was not by any means so certain about that.
The loneliness was depressing, as from one week's end to another
he saw no human being except the man from the general store in
Great Bromley, who called twice a week with bread, groceries,
meat and the London newspapers. Hardacre would have liked to
have cycled into Colchester or Manningtree every now and then
for a change, but a paragraph he had come across in one of the
papers had put the wind up him and made him afraid to show
himself anywhere in public.</p>

<p>The paragraph had been headed, "The Long Arm of the Law," and
it related how a man, who had been wanted by the Birmingham
Police for nearly six years, had only that week been picked out
by a constable in Ipswich, simply by the description which had
been broadcast, and tabulated in every police station all those
years ago.</p>

<p>"Hell," exclaimed Hardacre with a sickening feeling in his
stomach, "wanted in Birmingham and recognized in Ipswich, all
those miles away!" He moistened his dry lips with his tongue.
"Perhaps if I only knew it, my description has been on the wall
of every police station ever since I got away."</p>

<p>One day when the provision man called, Hardacre was in one of
the fields a little distance from the house, and the man came
over to find him and get his order. Hardacre was watering his
fowls and the tradesman, with poultry of his own, was immensely
struck with the appearance of some of the prize birds. He was
most enthusiastic about them and, an inveterate gossip, Hardacre
was sure he would spread all over the district what good-class
birds they were. That might mean, he cursed, people coming to
see them and, almost as bad, thieves coming after them at
night.</p>

<p>So he bought a big ugly-looking dog to mount guard, and was
immensely pleased the animal growled savagely at the tradesman
and wanted to go for him whenever he called. With a grim smile,
he hoped the man would broadcast that about, too.</p>

<p>Three months went by and a great change was manifesting
itself in Hardacre. His depression had got much worse and his
nerves were beginning to fray so badly that he realized he could
not go on much longer in the same way. It was not that he was
worried about his health, for the spots on his shin had none of
them become perceptibly bigger. He felt pretty well in himself,
too, and he had a good appetite. He had not been denying himself
anything in the way of eating and drinking, continuing with the
hampers of wine and expensive delicacies sent down from one of
the best provision stores in London.</p>

<p>He told himself he had been only following the doctor's
instructions to do himself well, and had kept on, too, with his
medicine all the time, but, strangely enough, although he knew
the doctor had done him a lot of good, nevertheless he had
worked himself into a state of vicious and venomous hatred
against him, arguing perversely that the specialist was
responsible for most of his present troubles. The man was a
scaremonger and an alarmist and had grossly exaggerated his,
Hardacre's, infectiousness. He cursed him deeply for having sent
the Health Authorities to run him down.</p>

<p>No, physically he was certain there was not much the matter
with him, at any rate not enough for him to have been condemned
to this lonely, desolate way of life, but, mentally, he knew
himself to be fast becoming a sick man.</p>

<p>He cursed that the poultry-farming business was a wash-out,
and was greatly disappointed that he had so lost all interest in
it. Certainly, he had had a lot of set-backs to dishearten him.
Many of his expensive birds had sickened and died within a few
weeks of his having bought them, and he found the day-upon-day
attending to fowls a most monotonous business. They were dirty
and messy creatures at best, and he was beginning to loathe the
very sight of them.</p>

<p>It was not only, too, that his occupation was so palling upon
him. He wanted excitement, he wanted company, he wanted people
to talk to and, above all, he had begun to hanker after the
companionship of the other sex.</p>

<p>Another matter also was worrying him a lot. It had of late
become an obsession with him that even after all these months
his hiding-place might yet be discovered. All sorts of
suspicions were coming into his mind. He imagined the bi-weekly
grocer had taken to looking queerly at him every time he called,
and, also, he believed the place was being watched. His common
sense told him he hadn't the slightest grounds for this last
belief, but it grew upon him until he was absolutely convinced
that there were spies posted about.</p>

<p>This idea became so strong that he sent to Town for the best
pair of binoculars he could get, and, some days for hours at a
time, would take himself up into the loft of the mill and from
well behind the narrow window there sweep the glasses round and
round in every direction, in the certain expectation of, sooner
or later, catching sight of someone hiding in the reeds of the
mill stream or among the tussocks of thick grass in the
surrounding meadows.</p>

<p>Weeks went by and his patience was not rewarded. Then, all in
an instant, it came to him that his worst suspicions had been
justified and that things were as bad as they could be, for late
one afternoon his horrified and startled eyes <i>did</i> fall
upon a man crouching in a clump of willows, over upon the side
of the mill stream about two hundred yards from the house.</p>

<p>He went breathless in his terror and excitement. So the
police were upon his track at last! A detective had been posted
to watch the house! Then, it would be only a matter of days,
perhaps even only hours, before he himself would be arrested and
taken off for segregation!</p>

<p>For quite ten minutes, still as a graven image, he stood
watching. Through his strong glasses he could see every line of
the man's face quite plainly, and to his frenzied imagination
they were as evil as could be.</p>

<p>The man peered hard at the mill, he stared at the chicken
sheds, and he looked up and down the placid mill stream, many
times.</p>

<p>Then he disappeared, to come in sight again, however, in
about a couple of minutes from the other side of the clump of
willows. He was now sauntering along aimlessly with a cigarette
in his mouth. He did not look once in the direction of the house
or the mill, and, proceeding very slowly on his way, finally
disappeared in the direction of the distant village.</p>

<p>Hardacre wiped the sweat from his forehead and laughed in
derisive relief. That man a detective! There wasn't one chance
in a million that he was! A weedy, under-nourished-looking
little rat, he had never been connected with the police! He was
just some little sneak thief from a city slum after his,
Hardacre's, fowls!</p>

<p>The trader scoffed contemptuously. Well, let him come! The
dog was off his chain every night and it would go badly with any
blackguard prowling round. The trader felt like a man suddenly
reprieved from impending violent death.</p>

<p>Two mornings later, however, he came out into the yard to
find his watch-dog stretched stark and stiff before the house
door. Undoubtedly poisoned, in his death agonies he had half
bitten through his tongue. Hardacre's face went as black as
night. Then the poisoner was undoubtedly intending to come after
the fowls and he had got rid of the dog first, so that he should
not be interfered with when he came!</p>

<p>Hardacre gritted his teeth savagely and, taking a small
automatic from one of his trunks, made certain it was loaded and
placed it handy in his hip pocket. God, he would shoot the thief
when he came, and bury him in one of the cellars! There was
going to be no police-court publicity about it!</p>

<p>All that night he remained on the watch, but nothing happened
and the next morning found him irritable and exhausted from want
of sleep, and in a more murderous mood than ever.</p>

<p>The next night, determined not to be caught out in his
fatigue, he made a bed for himself on the floor of the mill
itself and, leaving the big door ajar, was confident he would
hear anyone passing to get to the poultry sheds. It was from the
house, he argued, the marauder would expect danger to come, and
most probably he would give no thought to the old mill,
particularly so if he saw the door had been left carelessly
open.</p>

<p>He put out all the lights at the usual time, about ten
o'clock, and, creeping into the mill, lay down upon his
improvised bed of old sacks and prepared for fitful sleep, most
annoyed at the draught which fanned his face from the unclosed
door. Within a few minutes, however, before at any rate even in
his dreadfully tired condition he had begun to drop off to
sleep, he no longer felt the draught and, opening his eyes
uneasily to see what had happened, to his amazement, saw the
door had been pushed to, and a light, as from a small electric
torch, flashing quite near to him. The light went round and
round. A thrill of great triumph surged through the ex-trader
and his first impulse was to spring up and grapple with the
thief. Then it leapt into his mind that unless he succeeded in
laying hands upon him in his first attempt, the wretch might
bolt outside and escape in the darkness. So, realizing that his
own recumbent body was in part hidden by some sacks of chicken
food, he decided to make no move until the thief was within
seizing distance. Then he would get him without difficulty. So
he continued to lie where he was, with a finger upon the button
of his own torch. He would give the little thief the shock of
his life, for of course the intruder was the small man he had
seen spying from the willows, two days previously.</p>

<p>A few minutes of intense silence followed, and then with the
light still bobbing round, he heard the sounds of someone
breathing hard and a shadowy form loomed up close near him. With
a fierce shout he thrust out his foot, and the man with the
light tripped over it and fell heavily to the floor.</p>

<p>Hardacre was upon him in a flash and, grabbing him by the
collar of his jacket, shook him like a terrier with a rat. His
prisoner, however, showed no fight at all and just slumped in
his arms as limp as a piece of rag.</p>

<p>Thinking he must be unconscious through the force of his
fall, Hardacre lifted the man up roughly and carried him into
the house. Then, after passing his hands quickly over him to
make sure he was carrying no weapon, he bumped him down not too
gently upon the kitchen floor and, keeping a wary eye on him all
the time, proceeded to light the big hanging lamp.</p>

<p>The man opened his eyes, and struggled to a sitting position
with some effort, but he had, evidently, not quite recovered all
his senses, as he regarded his captor with puzzled and
bewildered eyes.</p>

<p>Hardacre jerked him up into a big chair, and, seeing no
danger in his puny body, did not even trouble to tie him up. The
kitchen door was shut and the little devil, he told himself,
would have no chance of getting away. He smiled at recognizing
in him, as he had expected, the man he had seen hiding in the
willows. Well, he would almost murder him now! He had killed his
dog, and come thieving after his chickens and he would have no
mercy on him! He would let him revive a bit and then flay him
with the whip he kept handy for the dog! He frowned. Ah, but he
must not make him a hospital case. He must not be too much hurt
to be sent packing, later, as there must be no police inquiries
about what had happened!</p>

<p>Suddenly the man seemed to look whiter and more sickly still
and Hardacre, thinking he was going to faint, hurriedly poured
out a stiff measure of whisky and, tipping up his head, forced
him to gulp it down. It was no act of pity or kindness. It was
only that Hardacre did not want a fainting man who could not
take the punishment he was going to give him.</p>

<p>And all this while not a word had been spoken by either of
them, but neither's eyes had left the other's face.</p>

<p>At last, apparently revived by the burning spirit, the man
broke the silence in weak and shaking tones. "You'd no business
to have knocked me about like that," he whimpered hoarsely. "I
wasn't doing anything wrong. I was only trying to find somewhere
to get shelter for the night, and seeing that door open,
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You liar,"' burst out Hardacre fiercely, "you had come after
my fowls and you poisoned my dog two days ago."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I've never been here before," wailed the man, "and
I was here quite by chance to-night. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" thundered Hardacre. He almost hissed out his next
words. "You little sneaking rat, I saw you spying from the
willows the other day. I was watching you through my glasses."
He spoke menacingly. "You wait a moment and you'll feel what I'm
going to give you. You won't have a whole bone in your body
after I've done with you, you little thieving blackguard!"</p>

<p>He turned to reach for the dog whip hanging on the wall,
quite unknowing that in all his life before never had he been in
greater danger than he was then. His back was towards the man
and there was a big butcher's knife upon the table.</p>

<p>The man's eyes flashed. He was no rat as Hardacre had called
him. He was more of the weasel than the rat, and his body,
though slight and puny-looking, was lithe and tough as whipcord,
and hardened by the rigours of recent prison life. He had knifed
a man in the back before, and indeed had just been released from
the best part of seven years' penal servitude for having clone
so, and he would have stabbed Hardacre with no more compunction
than killing a fowl. Thirty-three years of age, he had been in
the hands of the police many times and "robbery with violence"
was his special line. Cowardice, certainly, had never been one
of his failings.</p>

<p>He ground his teeth now in his impotence, for he felt his
legs were wobbling under him. One of his ankles, too, had been
so twisted in his fall in the mill that it was heavy as lead and
he dared not put it to the ground.</p>

<p>So Hardacre had no lightning stab in the back and, with the
whip in his hand, he turned to regard the little man with a
cruel and menacing smile. "Now then," he snarled, uplifting the
whip, "are you ready to take it?"</p>

<p>The man was breathing quickly, but he spoke quietly and with
restraint. "Don't you strike me, sir. It will pay you far better
not to. I can tell you something which will make you a rich
man."</p>

<p>"You little liar!" scoffed Hardacre. He laughed
contemptuously. "And you little fool, too."</p>

<p>"But I'm not lying, and I'm anything but a fool," protested
the man vehemently. "I know a secret about this old mill. There
is a large sum of money hidden here, but you won't find it
without me."</p>

<p>"Liar!" scoffed Hardacre again, but for all that the man's
vehemence had impressed him, and he lowered the whip.</p>

<p>The man spoke quickly. "I'll make a clean breast of
everything and you shall judge for yourself. I'm completely in
your hands and I know it will pay me to speak the truth. Yes, I
poisoned your dog, but it was not to get to your fowls." He
nodded impressively. "I was after the best part of fifty
thousand pounds."</p>

<p>Hardacre frowned incredulously, but for the moment his rage
had been submerged in his curiosity. "Who are you?" he asked
curtly.</p>

<p>"My name's Werrick," said the man, "James Werrick, and I'm a
convict on ticket-of-leave." He nodded. "Oh, yes, I'm going to
keep nothing back. I'm not a common man although I last worked
as a tally-clerk in the London Docks, but I got found out taking
things and was given three years' imprisonment. After a while I
was put in the prison infirmary as an attendant. Last year Royce
Millington was brought into my ward very sick with pneumonia,
and he was one of the patients I was looking after when he
died." He dropped his voice almost to a whisper. "He talked when
he was delirious, and I picked up where he'd hidden all the
money." He clenched his fist in his excitement. "It's hidden in
this mill and if you agree to go halves with me I'll find it."
His eyes gloated. "Fifty thousand pounds good it must be,
perhaps even more than that, for you remember it could only be
traced that he'd betted away five thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"What on earth are you talking about?" demanded Hardacre.
"What's all this rigmarole? Who's this Royce Millington,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>Werrick looked aghast. "Royce Millington who robbed the
Consolidated Bank in Lothbury of more than fifty thousand
pounds!"</p>

<p>"Never heard of him," grunted Hardacre. "I believe you are
making it all up."</p>

<p>Werrick drew in a deep breath. "But it only happened three
years ago! The papers were full of it! It was such a scandal
that a clerk had been able to go on robbing his bank for so long
before being found out. Why, you must have heard of it."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't," frowned Hardacre. "I was in America then."
He eyed Werrick doubtfully. "But how do I know you are not
making it all up to escape this thrashing? You look to me an
out-and-out liar who would say anything."</p>

<p>Werrick spoke angrily. "Well, I'll give you the proof I'm
speaking the truth now, anyhow." He unbuttoned the inner pocket
of his jacket and, from a carefully folded and tied-round piece
of brown paper, after much fumbling with the string because his
hands were shaking badly, held out a long newspaper cutting to
Hardacre. "Here, this is the report of the trial which I cut out
from a copy of the <i>Times.</i>"</p>

<p>As if reluctantly and still unbelieving, Hardacre took the
cutting from him, and then Werrick remarked jauntily: "And while
you are reading it will you please give me a cigarette?" He made
a grimace. "My nerves are still very upset from the shaking you
gave me."</p>

<p>Hardacre swore at him for his impudence. "I'll give you
nothing," he added curtly, "unless it's that thrashing I
promised you," and he cast his eyes down upon the paper and
commenced to read.</p>

<p>Werrick ground his teeth savagely and cursed his strained
ankle once again. The big knife was so handy and its point
looked so very nice and sharp.</p>

<p>A long silence followed and Hardacre read slowly and
carefully. Rex versus Edward Royce Millington was certainly a
startling case. A trusted officer of the bank for two years, so
it was estimated, had been systematically purloining bank-notes,
never of a greater value than £20, all of which notes had been
in circulation, and none of the numbers of which had been
recorded. His method had been simple but so cunning that it had
escaped detection. £56,000 odd had been taken from the bank
reserves, and all of it had gone, so the accused averred, in
gambling on the Stock Exchange and in betting. But a bare £5,000
was all which had been actually traced, and both the Prosecutor
for the Crown and the judge who tried the case had expressed
their emphatic disbelief in the prisoner's story as to what had
become of the rest. He had been sentenced to seven years' penal
servitude.</p>

<p>"How did you get hold of this cutting?" asked Hardacre. "You
couldn't have been keeping it on the chance that you might one
day meet the man."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," agreed Werrick. "I got it from the newspaper
files in the British Museum. Of course, with my record I knew I
could never get a ticket of admission to the Reading Room,
but"&mdash;and for the first time during the interview a smile
came into his face&mdash;"I hung about the entrance until I saw
a likely-looking chap coming out and then I picked his pocket as
he was going home in the bus. I used his ticket, and in the
newspaper room cut out the paragraph, without being seen."</p>

<p>Hardacre was, apparently, still in two minds whether to
believe the man or not. "And you say," he asked, "that this
thieving bank clerk told you he'd got the money and had hidden
it here?"</p>

<p>"No, no," exclaimed Werrick, "he didn't tell me anything. He
only babbled about it when he was delirious. He talked about
what were seven years in prison for a man who could live rich
for the remainder of his life and he kept saying that no rats in
the old mill could get at the notes to destroy them. He talked
about the old mill so often that I hoped it was the name of some
place."</p>

<p>"But if this estate belonged to him," frowned Hardacre, "why
didn't the police search here to find the money?"</p>

<p>"It didn't belong to him," said Werrick, "and no one except
me learnt he had ever had anything to do with it." His
expression was a triumphant one. "I found it out after as smart
a piece of detective work as was ever done at Scotland Yard,"
and he at once proceeded to tell Hardacre the whole story.</p>

<p>It was not until the bank officer had been dead nearly six
months that Werrick had been released on ticket-of-leave, and
then he had set about finding out all he could about the dead
man. He had set about it, too, with infinite patience and
cunning.</p>

<p>First, he had trailed the commissionaire of the bank in
Lothbury which Royce Millington had robbed to his home in
Waltham Green. He found his hobby was chrysanthemums and,
catching the man in the front garden of his modest little house,
stopped to admire his blooms. Then he suggested a friendly glass
of beer at a nearby public house and learnt the one the
commissionaire generally frequented of an evening. He hobnobbed
with him several times before drawing from him his occupation,
and then it was an easy matter to bring up Royce Millington and
the shameful way he had robbed the bank. He hazarded the opinion
that the embezzler must have been living very extravagantly in,
probably, a very swanky house.</p>

<p>"No, he didn't," said the commissionaire. "At any rate he
couldn't have got rid of much of the money in that way. He had a
cheap little flat in Langham Mansions in West Kensington."</p>

<p>That had been quite enough for Werrick, and the talkative
commissionaire never set eyes on his new-found friend again. At
Langham Mansions Werrick palled up with the porter and, getting
to know him pretty well, soon pumped him dry about Millington.
He learnt he was considered quite a quiet young fellow, and that
he had a little car and often went off for weekends somewhere in
the country, the porter didn't know where. Fishing and a little
rough shooting were his hobbies, not sea fishing for it was only
fresh-water fish he ever brought home, trout and perch and an
occasional eel. A few times he had shot some wild duck. He had
no particular friends, but was on very good terms with his aunt,
an old lady, Miss Matilda Hendry, who lived in Philbeach Gardens
in Earl's Court.</p>

<p>Off to this Miss Hendry's home Werrick went, intending to
pitch a yarn and invoke the old lady's sympathy by a pathetic
story of how he had nursed her nephew in his dying moments. To
his dismay, however, he learnt that Miss Hendry had died a year
previously and no one seemed to know what relations, besides the
bank clerk, she had had.</p>

<p>Then a brain-wave seized Werrick and, proceeding to Somerset
House, he paid a shilling and inspected her will. He found she
had left most of her money to her brother, but a property,
Benger's Green, near Great Bromley in Essex had gone to a niece
in Scotland.</p>

<p>That was enough for Werrick, and associating fresh-water fish
with a stream somewhere, and eels and wild duck with the muddy
flats and lonely places round the Essex coast, down to Great
Bromley he had come at once.</p>

<p>"Then imagine my feelings, sir," he finished up, "when I saw
there was a mill on this property." He raised his hands in his
excitement. "I am certain the money is here and it must be
hidden in the mill itself."</p>

<p>A long silence followed and then Hardacre asked sharply: "How
old are you? Thirty-three! Then how long have you been a
criminal?"</p>

<p>Werrick appeared most indignant. "Only once, when I got those
three years for taking a pound of tobacco which I saw lying
about. It was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hardacre shook his head angrily. "No, no, it's no good you
telling me that. No judge would have given you three years for
just taking a pound of tobacco."</p>

<p>"Well, he did," asserted Werrick with some heat. Then,
realizing that Hardacre was no fool to be taken in easily, he
recovered himself quickly and added: "But it was not only for
taking the tobacco I was sentenced. I had injured the man who
caught me. In my fright I had struck at him with a spanner."</p>

<p>"Exactly, robbery with violence!" commented the trader dryly.
"And I don't take you either, for the innocent first offender
you want to make yourself out to be. You look like a hardened
type to me." He nodded. "So, I'm taking no chance. I shall lock
you up to-night and consider to-morrow what I shall do."</p>

<p>Werrick looked hurt. "Why I wouldn't hurt a soul, sir. It's
not in my nature to."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," sneered Hardacre, "but for all that, you
poisoned my dog, and I have no wish to wake up in the night with
my throat cut. So I shall put you down in the cellar." A thought
appeared to strike him. "But are you acting alone in this, or
have you any confederate prowling about outside?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" cried Werrick emphatically. "I have never
breathed a word to any human being. No one knows I have come
down here and no one but yourself has seen me near this place.
Everything now is between you and me."</p>

<p>"Good," nodded Hardacre, "then I know how we stand. Well,
down you go into the cellar. You can sleep on some sacks, and in
the morning we'll have another talk."</p>

<p>So that night two men of no conscience or scruples whatsoever
slept within a few yards of each other, and neither would have
felt easy in his mind had he known what the other's thoughts
were.</p>

<p>Werrick in the cellar was all out for murder&mdash;at its
proper time. There would be no sharing the notes if they found
them, and he would knife Hardacre like a sheep and load down his
body with some of those rusty chains he had noticed in the mill,
and sink him in the stream. But he, Werrick, must be careful for
the man was of a suspicious nature, and he must not let him get
the ghost of an idea that his life might be actually in danger.
Still, with all his bullying, the big chap seemed a bit of a
softy, to be taken in easily when the right man came along.</p>

<p>Now the ex-convict had been many things in his life, a
student in a veterinary college&mdash;until he had been turned
out for theft&mdash;a steward on a P. &amp; O. liner until he
had deserted his ship in Bombay, taking with him a passenger's
wallet; a bookmaker's clerk until he had had to cut and run for
robbing again, a waiter in a shady night club in Soho, and a
pursuer of many occupations, several of which should have
brought him under notice of the police.</p>

<p>In all these callings he had fallen badly, mainly because he
had been always such a poor judge of character, and he had never
misjudged anyone more grossly than he was now misjudging his
present captor. Hardacre was anything but a softy. He was hard
as hell and, in his present embittered state of mind against
authority and the law, would be as merciless and as murderously
inclined as any Thug on the plains of India.</p>

<p>So, that night, Hardacre was thinking of murder, too. If they
found the money&mdash;and he saw no reason now to doubt the
ex-convict's story&mdash;there would be no halving of it, and the
little wretch in the cellar would not get a penny. If he had his
share, it would only mean that in a couple of years or so he
would have spent it all, and be tracking him, Hardacre, down to
blackmail for more. Hardacre knew his kind, a waster who had
been on the down grade all his life.</p>

<p>The trader smiled a cold, grim smile. He was in a reckless
mood. If he laid hands upon the money he would risk everything.
He would go back into the world and enjoy what years of health
were left to him. He would chance it that no one would ever
recognize him. After all, the doctor fellow had only seen him
twice and, with the many patients who passed through his hands,
he would surely not be able to remember him for long. At any
rate the risk would be worth the taking.</p>

<p>As for the little devil who had come so strangely into his
life, well, the cellar or some other place like it would be his
last home. He would pistol him when the time came, and his small
body would be easily tucked away somewhere. All or nothing, that
was going to be his, Hardacre's, motto for the future.</p>

<p>The two evil men beneath that old time-worn roof fell asleep
at last and, surely, no guardian angels were watching over their
slumber. They were both beasts of the jungle and no one would
have had pity for either of them, whatever harm came.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; THE SECRET OF THE MILL
STREAM.</h2>

<p class="first">THE following morning Hardacre was up and about
early, and Werrick in the cellar heard him moving in the kitchen
above. Presently the cellar flap was lifted and Werrick was
ordered to come up. With some difficulty, as his ankle was
considerably swollen and most painful, he climbed the steep
steps. Hardacre frowned when he saw the condition of the injured
limb.</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate you won't be able to run away in a hurry,"
he grunted. He nodded unpleasantly. "So if this hidden money
turns out to be all imagination, you can still have your
thrashing before being handed over to the police."</p>

<p>Werrick forced a smile to his face. "But the money's here,"
he said confidently, "and it ought to be easy to find. Fifty
thousand pounds in bank-notes, even if they are all twenties,
which they certainly are not&mdash;will make quite a bulky
parcel. I reckon at the very least there should be three
thousand bank-notes." He nodded. "I think we shall find them in
an air-tight tin box. Handling bank-notes all his life,
Millington would have known the importance of keeping the damp
from them."</p>

<p>Hardacre pretended not to be greatly interested. "Well, we
won't look for them for an hour or two, as I've got the fowls to
see to first, and it's the day the grocer comes and he's
generally pretty early. So you remain just where you are and
don't let him catch sight of your ugly face. If you hear him
come just shut yourself in the scullery." He nodded grimly. "I'm
locking the passage door, so that you can't go into the other
part of the house."</p>

<p>"But, sir, I wouldn't touch anything," remonstrated Werrick
with a grieved expression on his face but with black rage in his
heart. "You can trust me, surely!"</p>

<p>"Aren't you a convicted thief," scowled Hardacre, "and don't
you propose to make one of me, too?" He spoke sharply. "Do you
realize that if we find this money it doesn't belong to us? It
belongs to the bank."</p>

<p>"But banks are robbers," protested Werrick hotly. "They are
only part of that Society which preys on us poor men. Banks and
big companies and the Government all get their money from us
poor folks and then keep most of it for themselves in fat
salaries, while pretending to be the pillars of morality." He
let himself go in his bitterness. "To hell with Society, I
say."</p>

<p>Hardacre pretended to consider and then nodded slowly.
"Perhaps you're right," he said. "They're down on everyone they
can." He smiled his unpleasant smile again. "But while I don't
trust <i>you,</i> how is it you are prepared to trust
<i>me?</i>"</p>

<p>Werrick grinned. "Oh, I'm quite safe here. If you cut up
nasty, I'd go and tell the police about the money and then, at
any rate, there'll be a good reward coming to me from the bank."
He nodded confidently. "No, we sink or swim together and we
can't do without each other."</p>

<p>Realizing that the man, by his own admission, was of a
violent criminal nature, Hardacre thought it safest not to rile
him any more, and so spoke more amicably.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, we'll keep the money if we find it," he
said, "and share out equally"&mdash;he grinned&mdash;"as honest
thieves." He passed his hand over his forehead and went on: "But
the sleep I lost in sitting up to catch you has made me feel a
bit low and so, when I've fed the fowls and the grocer man has
been and gone, we'll have a bottle of champagne to drink to our
success."</p>

<p>He left the house and, for some minutes through the window,
Werrick watched him among the fowls. Then, his interest
wandering, he began to take stock of things in the room. There
were several cupboards and the two big-sized wooden chests.
Limping uncomfortably with his bruised ankle, he moved over and
peeped into the cupboards.</p>

<p>"Whew, all good-class stuff!" he whispered. "Those tinned
tongues cost him five and six if they cost a penny!" He licked
his own tongue against the roof of his mouth. "Tinned asparagus,
oysters, curry and cripes&mdash;a jar of <i>pate de foi
gras!</i> Gosh, this fellow does himself well!" He nodded. "I'll
bet he's got more money than any ordinary poultry-farmer, and I
shouldn't be at all surprised if he'd not got a tidy bit of it
somewhere in the house. That's why he's been locking all the
doors." He grinned. "Well, that'll be more pickings for me when
I've tickled him in the back."</p>

<p>He screwed up his eyes. "But I wonder who the devil he is and
where he's come from! He's not been in the poultry line long,
for one thing, because his hands have not coarsened enough. Of
course, with that complexion of his he's been in some hot
country. Those tins of curry make one think that, too."</p>

<p>He lifted the lid of one of the big chests and exposed to
view quite a considerable amount of fishing gear. "That's a good
rod," he whispered, "and cost a bit of money, too! No expense
spared anywhere!" He picked up a knife with a fixed handle which
Hardacre had used for gutting fish when at Burnham, and his eyes
gleamed as he felt the sharpness of its point. "The very thing!"
he ejaculated. "Now dare I risk taking it?"</p>

<p>After a few moments' hesitation, he thought he dared and,
looking round for a cork and finding one in the kitchen dresser'
drawer, he put it on to protect the point, and then thrust the
knife into his breast pocket.</p>

<p>His ankle gave him a spasm of pain. "But, I say, I say," he
exclaimed, looking very worried, "I can't cut off for a day or
two! People would be sure to remember a limping man!"</p>

<p>His cogitations were interrupted by the sound of a motor
outside, and he guessed rightly that the grocer had arrived in
his van. Unable to resist his curiosity, he pressed his face
close against the window to see if he could get a sideways look.
Half a minute later he wished he hadn't, for the grocer came
right by the window and caught him looking before he had time to
move away. He cursed himself for being such a careless fool.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," he consoled himself, as he bobbed down quickly,
"he's not likely to remember me from that one look."</p>

<p>To Hardacre's annoyance, the grocer was in no hurry to go
that morning. There had been a fire in the village church the
previous evening, and he insisted on telling him all about it.
However, he was got rid of at last and, after the promised
bottle of champagne, the two men entered the mill to commence
the search for the hidden bank-notes.</p>

<p>They were both excited, though the ex-convict showed it more
than did Hardacre. The latter's feelings were deeply moved, and
he was bracing himself up not only for the surprise of finding
the notes but, also, for dealing promptly with the ex-convict
the moment the discovery of the money was assured. He was
determined to finish with him immediately. If possible he would
strike him with the crowbar he used for opening packing-cases,
and which was lying handy beside some sacks. If that was not
possible, he would snatch the automatic pistol from his pocket
and give him one in the forehead. He was all prepared, too, to
deal with the body. He would wind one of those big chains round
him and sink it in the mill stream. It would soon be eaten by
the eels.</p>

<p>So both men, although neither of them was aware of it, moved
under the shadow of impending death. And whether that death came
to them or not, all depended upon the finding of some bundles of
crackling paper, tucked away, probably, in an old biscuit
tin.</p>

<p>Both of them were all ready for a dreadful crime, but neither
would carry it out until he was certain the risk was worth the
running. With no bank-notes found, there would be no murder
done.</p>

<p>Werrick spoke with a voice which shook in his excitement.
"Now how long is it since you came here, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, a long time," replied Hardacre evasively. Then,
realizing that he could not easily take in his quick-witted
little companion and sure the latter must have noticed the
poultry sheds were new and from their appearance could not have
been put up very long, he added quickly: "Some nine months or
so."</p>

<p>"Then was the floor of this room all clear then? I mean were
any of these sacks lying here when you came?"</p>

<p>"All except a few which I've added to them," nodded Hardacre.
"The place was exactly like it is now, full of rubbish and dust.
I only use it for storing the poultry food."'</p>

<p>"Then there's a good chance," said the ex-convict, "that he's
pulled up one of these boards and has got the hiding-place
underneath."</p>

<p>The two began energetically to clear up the old sacks, with
Werrick, in spite of his bad ankle, appearing to work as
feverishly as Hardacre. As they proceeded, they scrutinized the
floor most carefully for any sign of interference with the
floor-boards as each one came into view.</p>

<p>It was Hardacre who found out something first. "Hullo," he
called out, and he did not attempt to hide his excitement now,
"this board's been prised up since it was first laid down. Look
where a screwdriver or something has been pushed in!"</p>

<p>Werrick was by his side in an instant. "Yes, and that looks
like a gimlet hole there," he shouted. "They screwed in a gimlet
to lift it up. Have you got one handy, sir?"</p>

<p>As quickly as possible, for he did not like to leave the man
alone for one instant now, Hardacre ran into the house and
returned with a gimlet. Then he himself screwed it into the
board, and a few breathless moments followed before the board
came up. The adjoining boards on either side were pulled up,
too, both coming up without difficulty as if they had been often
manipulated in that way before. A few inches below, a large
oblong box, about four feet in length, came into view. It was
covered over thickly with dust, and Hardacre hoisted it quickly
on to the floor.</p>

<p>The box had no lock to it, but the lid was fastened down with
a stout hasp. The hasp was stiff and, to get a good purchase,
Hardacre knelt down, with Werrick just behind him, looking over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>The ex-convict's eyes gleamed. The trader was in an ideal
position for the fatal thrust just below the shoulder blade
which would transfix his heart. Werrick's hand darted like
lightning to the fish-gutting knife in his breast pocket, but in
doing so he altered his position and pressed heavily upon his
injured ankle. The agony made him wince and, with a deep curse,
he remembered just in time. No, he dared not strike yet! When he
put paid to this fool poultry-farmer he must be fit and strong
to vanish like a ghost from the scene of the crime! It would
mean a dreadful journey across country in the darkness of the
night, avoiding all villages and towns until he was so many
miles away that he could slink unnoticed into some populous
district. No one must ever remember having seen a stranger
about. And how could he travel quickly with a foot which hung
upon him like a lump of lead? No, he must bide his time! He was
playing for high stake and he had all the best cards in his
hand!</p>

<p>Half a minute later, he realized into what an awful mistake
he had so nearly fallen. There were no bank-notes in the
box!</p>

<p>Hardacre laughed derisively. "Hell, what a fortune we've
found!" he exclaimed as he rose to his feet. "Half a bottle of
whisky," he went on, enumerating the contents of the box, "two
tins of corned beef, an old fishing rod, some carpentry and odd
motor tools and a rusty old shot-gun! Hell, we shall be rich men
now!"</p>

<p>"But wait a moment, sir," said Werrick, choking back his
disappointment. "There may be other things down there besides
this box," and, snatching up Hardacre's torch, he lay down and
flashed it in every direction under the flooring.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, rewarded his efforts and he rose to face
Hardacre's sneering smile. "A mare's nest, my thieving friend,"
said the trader sourly, "and all your grand detective work goes
phut. It isn't likely your fellow convict has ever been within
miles of here."</p>

<p>Savage in his bitter disappointment, Werrick dropped his eyes
to hide the fury which the sneering words had evoked. Then,
suddenly, he started, the whole expression of his face altered
and he looked up at Hardacre with a triumphant grin.</p>

<p>"You're hard to convince, Partner," he said with offensive
familiarity, "but we're on the right track, sure enough. There's
another hiding-place somewhere, and all we've got to do is to
find it. Millington wasn't a fool and upon second thoughts I
believe he wouldn't have hidden all that money where he hid
these unimportant things which he would have known could be
found easily if anyone actually came to look for them. Why,
everyone would look under the floor-boards as the very first
hiding-place, just as we have done!"</p>

<p>"But there isn't a shred of evidence to show that he ever
came here," snarled Hardacre, savage, too, in his
disappointment.</p>

<p>The ex-convict quietly picked up the gun and held it out to
Hardacre for inspection. He made his voice as careless as he
could. "See those rough initials on the stock, E.R.M.," he said.
His voice rose triumphantly. "They stand for Edward Royce
Millington, sir, and nobody else, and prove he has been
here."</p>

<p>Hardacre's eyes bulged. The angry sneering look passed from
his face and he whistled. "Whew, my lad," he exclaimed
delightedly, "then you really did score a bull's-eye after all!"
He patted Werrick on the shoulder. "You're not such a simpleton
as I took you to be."</p>

<p>"Not half," grinned Werrick. "I've knocked about the world a
lot and picked up quite a few good ideas."</p>

<p>"Well, where shall we look now?" asked Hardacre. He laughed.
"Somewhere where no one else would look!"</p>

<p>But it was at once evident that Werrick was going to do no
more looking round for a while, as his face suddenly became
white as a sheet, and he slumped down weakly on to a pile of
sacks. "It's my damned foot," he said faintly. "I gave it a
knock just now and it hurts terribly." He shook his head. "I'm
tarnation sorry, but I must give it a rest."</p>

<p>Seeing there was no help for it and that Werrick was upon the
very point of collapsing altogether, Hardacre helped him back
into the kitchen and propped him in a chair. In a way he was not
sorry Werrick was out of action for a time, as it would mean
<i>he</i> would be able to carry on the search alone. "And, by
cripes," he told himself, "if I find the stuff, I won't let the
little devil know!"</p>

<p>He assumed a sympathetic air and examined the ankle
critically. The ankle was very swollen, and the skin had assumed
an ugly colour. He shook his head. "No, you certainly mustn't
put it to the ground, perhaps for as long as three or four days,
but I tell you what I'll do. There's an old sofa in one of the
other I rooms. It was here when I bought the place. I'll bring
it into the kitchen and you can have it for a bed."</p>

<p>For three days Werrick lay on the sofa before his ankle began
to show any sign of getting better, and then for another three
he dared not move about much. At first, he was worried that
Hardacre might discover the hiding-place, but he soon comforted
himself with the reflection that, if any discovery were made, he
would know it at once by the poultry-farmer's manner. He was
sure the latter would not be subtle enough to hide his feelings.
Besides, he was certain Hardacre had not enough imagination to
search in other than most ordinary places, places which a man of
the proved cunning and ingenuity of the bank clerk would never
have decided upon using.</p>

<p>For the first couple of days Hardacre went tapping everywhere
for hollow sounds and prising up boards all over the mill. But
his naturally impatient nature would not allow him to continue
for very long, and eventually he became disheartened and in a
morose temper again.</p>

<p>"But granted," he scowled to Werrick on the night of the
third day of his unsuccessful search, "that the fellow was in
the habit of coming here, we have no proof that he had any money
to hide. He may have been speaking the actual truth when he said
he had lost everything in betting."</p>

<p>"But nearly fifty thousand pounds, sir," argued Werrick, "and
all lost in less than two years! How could he have done all that
in in ready-money betting on the racecourse? Remember, he said
all his transactions had been cash ones, and the few bookmakers
whose names he gave did not remember him as a heavy better.
Certainly, some of them admitted they had got to know him by
sight as a moderate better, but they all denied he had ever had
a bet bigger than twenty pounds with them."</p>

<p>"Well," went on Hardacre in part convinced, "are you certain
that when he talked in his delirium he was meaning he had hidden
the notes in the mill, not buried them somewhere outside?"</p>

<p>"I'm certain he meant the mill," replied Werrick
emphatically, "and nowhere else. Why should he have kept on
saying that rats wouldn't get at the notes if he hadn't meant
inside the mill? Rats wouldn't go burrowing after things with no
smell, buried outside in a field."</p>

<p>"What sort of man was he to look at?" asked Hardacre. "Did he
look a sharp sort of fellow?"</p>

<p>Werrick laughed. "Sharp! Why, he was as sharp and cunning as
the devil and looked it, too! Here, give me a pencil and I'll
show you what he was like. I'm pretty good at sketches and often
think I'd have made a lot of money at them, if I'd been properly
trained."</p>

<p>Hardacre produced a pencil and an old exercise book and, to
his surprise, at once saw the ex-convict had been no boaster
when he said he could draw. A few rapid strokes of the pencil
and Werrick had produced a clear-cut portrait of a man,
intellectual-looking and refined, but whose expression was quite
spoilt by its cunning.</p>

<p>"Well, if he was anything like that," grunted Hardacre, "I
wonder they trusted him."</p>

<p>"Oh, they trusted him, right enough," smiled Werrick, "or he
wouldn't have got the opportunities of pinching all he did." He
regarded the sketch admiringly. "Yes, and he'd just got that
look about him of thinking himself a toff and superior to
everybody else."</p>

<p>"But how do I know it's like him?" went on Hardacre, by
nature never willing to give praise. "It may be only a copy of
some other sketch you remember."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll draw you," grinned the ex-convict, "and you shall
see exactly what you're like."</p>

<p>So he proceeded to sketch Hardacre and certainly did not
flatter him in doing so. He portrayed his heavy and arrogant
expression, and gave him the look of a bored and disappointed
man.</p>

<p>"And I look like that, do I?" frowned Hardacre. He nodded.
"Well, anyhow, that's how I feel, fed-up with everything." A
grim smile came into his face. "Half of those fifty thousand
quid will come in handy to give me a nice change."</p>

<p>Then, to keep his host in a good humour, Werrick made a lot
of other sketches of people associated with his prison days; the
Governor of the prison, a stern and haughty martinet, the
doctor, kindly featured and always sympathetically inclined
towards the convicts, the big stout chaplain, very important and
solemn-looking, seemingly nourished upon plenty of good rich
food, and warders and fellow-convicts in their uniforms and
prison clothes.</p>

<p>After that, chiefly for his own amusement, Werrick occupied
his time in drawing a lot of other people, with Hardacre's
interest greatly stirred by the sketch of a noted film star
getting into her bath. She was delicate and small, and he
thought with a sigh of Winna Mee and the delightful times he had
had with her.</p>

<p>Werrick, however, made other sketches, some of which he did
not show Hardacre, but pushed under the torn upholstery of the
old sofa directly the latter appeared. One was of Hardacre
himself being hanged from a high beam in the old mill, his face
black and his tongue protruding, and it was not a pleasant
sight. Another was of Hardacre as a vicious-looking cockerel
chasing a small hen, and a third of Hardacre as a slimy river
rat. They gave the ex-convict great pleasure to draw them, as a
preliminary, he told himself, to what he was intending to do
with the gutting knife. His hatred towards his host was the more
venomous because Hardacre continued to lock the passage door
every night.</p>

<p>And all this while Hardacre was chafing at the presence of
his unwelcome guest. But he knew it could not last for ever and,
if after a certain time the notes had not been discovered, he
would pack him off, after a good belting with the whip. Deep
down in his heart, however, he believed that the money would be
found and found by the ex-convict, too. The little beast
possessed just that kind of rat-like instinct to smell out
things where a much finer nature would fail. So, Hardacre was
biding his time, still, as with Werrick, intending to murder in
the end.</p>

<p>A week having passed, Werrick said that his ankle was nearly
right, and, with a broom as a crutch and one of Hardacre's
carpet slippers, well stuffed with paper to make it something of
a fit for the injured foot, he limped into the mill and seated
himself upon a heap of sacks. To Hardacre's secret fury, he
seemed to think it quite natural he should take command of
everything.</p>

<p>"Now I've been thinking a lot this week," he said
impressively, between puffs at one of Hardacre's fat Egyptian
cigarettes, "and one idea has come to me of what that bank
fellow may have done. He had a flat wooden box made, put the
notes into it, nailed it up somewhere on to some roof or wall
and painted it over exactly the same colour as the place to
where it was nailed." He snapped his fingers together
exultingly. "Now what do you think of it? The damned thing may
have been right under our very eyes the whole time."</p>

<p>Hardacre had to admit it was a good suggestion and,
accordingly, because Werrick's foot would not yet allow him to
be too active, spent a fatiguing day lugging a heavy ladder
round, closely scrutinizing every inch of the ceilings and walls
everywhere in the mill. Werrick made him climb up outside on to
the roof as well.</p>

<p>No discovery, however, was made, and the evening found them
both most depressed. "Still, I'm certain the money's here
somewhere," reiterated Werrick for the hundredth time, "and it
only means patience for us to find it."</p>

<p>They retired to bed early, but with little likelihood of
either of them falling to sleep for a long time. Hardacre had
drunk more than half a bottle of whisky since the evening meal,
but had grudged the ex-convict one lean two-finger spot. As
usual, he had locked the latter away from all but the kitchen
part of the house.</p>

<p>Well after midnight, when Hardacre was at last beginning to
feel sleepy, there came a loud banging on the locked passage
door.</p>

<p>"I want to speak to you," shouted Werrick shrilly. "I think
I've got the hang of everything at last. I know where that
beggar hid the stuff. Come out quick."</p>

<p>After a string of curses for being disturbed, Hardacre
appeared in his pyjamas, blinking frowningly in the glare of the
big hanging lamp which Werrick had relighted.</p>

<p>"Come over here," cried the latter excitedly, pointing to
some marks of burning on the draining-board of the kitchen sink.
"Now were those marks like that when you came to the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they were," growled Hardacre, "but what the
devil&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you see," went on Werrick, interrupting him with no
ceremony, "that someone's been soldering here and those are the
markings the hot iron left when he laid it down." His eyes
bulged. "Then, wasn't there a soldering iron among those odd
things we saw in Millington's box? Of course, you remember it?
Then it was Millington who was soldering here and he was
soldering on the lid of some tin after he put the notes inside.
He was making it air-tight, water-tight, and rat-tight. Oh, it's
all as plain as daylight to me!"</p>

<p>"But that doesn't help us," commented Hardacre frowningly.
"We've come across no soldered-up tin."</p>

<p>"No, no, not yet," continued the ex-convict, as excitedly as
before, "but what else did we see among those odds and ends in
that box?" He raised his hand impressively. "Why, a good length
of unused lead gas pipe!"</p>

<p>"From which he'd made sinkers," snarled Hardacre, "for those
fishing lines that were there, too."</p>

<p>Werrick almost danced in his triumph. "No, no, no!" He calmed
down and, with an effort, spoke very quietly. "That bank clerk,
sir, had brought with him a length of lead piping, perhaps eight
or ten feet long, and he soldered one end round that tin
because"&mdash;he hesitated tantalizingly&mdash;"because lead
doesn't rust in water and he was going to lower the whole thing
into the mill stream."</p>

<p>For a long minute Hardacre considered. Then he nodded. "Gad,
you may be right! He expected to be away a long time and he knew
an iron wire round the tin would have rusted to pieces when he
came to pull it up."</p>

<p>"That's it," nodded back Werrick. "He knew he'd get at least
five years if none of the money was recovered and so he took all
precautions. He was a calculating fellow, that bank clerk."</p>

<p>The next morning, apparently on the most friendly terms, they
went out to renew their search, and it was Hardacre who scored a
bull's-eye this time. "I reckon," he said, "that if it was of
the old mill the fellow was babbling, then he sank the tin close
up to the mill and not down in the stream anywhere else. So what
about his having hooked his lead pipe somewhere on to the mill
wheel?"</p>

<p>And sure enough, when he climbed on to the wheel and, baring
his arm to the shoulder, groped down as far as he could reach
along the flanges of the wheel well below the surface of the
water, almost at once he gave an excited shout. "Here it is!" he
cried triumphantly. "There's lead piping twisted round down
here," and he commenced to pull hard. "But it won't give," he
went on after a minute's straining. "It seems to have caught
somewhere."</p>

<p>"Then, blast you, don't pull on it," shrieked Werrick in
consternation, "or you'll break it away and we may never be able
to get the tin! You let me come."</p>

<p>So he climbed on to the wheel beside Hardacre and, feeling
for the piping, pulled much more gently than the latter had
done. "No, it's caught right enough," he exclaimed, "and it
seems a devil of a way down. We must try and turn the wheel
round and, perhaps, it'll come up that way."</p>

<p>But many years of disuse had well rusted the axle of the
wheel in its housing and, with all their efforts, it would not
budge a fraction of an inch. No hammer heavy enough being on the
place, Hardacre fetched a big axe and with fierce blows tried to
shake the wheel in any direction. But it was all to no purpose
and, puffing and blowing with his exertions, he ultimately gave
it up.</p>

<p>"Then I'll dive for it," said Werrick, nothing daunted. "I'll
go down and see what's happened." He grinned. "Oh, I'll get hold
of it quick enough! I can dive like an otter."</p>

<p>In a trice he had stripped off his clothes and plunged into
the water, with Hardacre following the movements of his slim
white body with excited and bulging eyes. The ex-convict's head
bobbed up to the surface very quickly. "It's there," he said
breathlessly. "I can see it quite plainly. It's caught under the
wheel, but I know where to go now and I'll get it next
time."</p>

<p>Down he went again and he was much longer below now, but up
he came at last with a big black object clutched tightly in his
arms. He turned over on to his back and kicked vigorously
towards the bank of the stream. So for the moment the ex-convict
was in possession of what were to him enormous riches. It was
only for a few seconds, however, for upon his reaching the bank
and turning to pick up his clothes after he had handed over his
precious burden to Hardacre, he received a murderous blow from
the big axe upon the back of his head. The violence of the blow
was so great that it almost clove his skull in two and drove his
face deep into the muddy ground.</p>

<p>He died instantaneously.</p>

<p>The trader from Hoichow stood over him, ready, if necessary,
for another blow. He looked murder incarnate. His mouth was
gaping and he was breathing hard. His eyes glared like a
madman's and were suffused with blood. Sweat stood out in little
beads upon his forehead. Well, he had done it as he had intended
to! With that secret between them, the world was not big enough
for them both and the weaker of them had died!</p>

<p>Then it came to him in a flash and, indeed, as if he were
only just realizing for the first time, that if he were found
out it would mean much more than only just a sentence of
imprisonment. It would mean death in a most horrible form,
preceded by the long-drawn-out agonies of a trial for murder.
Great God! there would be weeks and weeks of nerve-racking
anticipation before he was finally hanged by the neck until he
was dead!</p>

<p>In a lightning movement he crouched down as if he were
expecting a blow, and his eyes darted round and round in every
direction. There was not a soul in sight and not a sound to be
heard save the murmuring of the mill stream.</p>

<p>He awoke to instant action and, seizing the big axe, hurled
it into the middle of the stream. Then, as if someone were
furiously pursuing him, he raced back into the mill to reappear
in a few seconds dragging behind him one of the big mill chains.
In feverish haste he wound it round and round Werrick's naked
body, tucking in the ends as best he could so that the chain
should not become loose. Then, carrying his heavy burden some
fifty yards up the stream, he heaved it into the water as far
away from the bank as he could. He wiped his hands with an
expression of disgust, upon the grass of the meadow.</p>

<p>Apparently satisfied that, at any rate for the moment, all
danger of discovery was over, he turned his attention to the
object that the dead man had retrieved and found, as they had
both expected it would be, that it was a tin box, heavily
painted over, however, before it had been immersed in the water.
It showed no signs of rust.</p>

<p>His heart beginning to beat painfully again, he hastened with
it into the house and quickly was at work with a chisel and
hammer. Inside the painted tin was an inner and only slightly
smaller tin, painted over as thickly as the outer one had been.
He tore off the lid and, some wads of brown paper being removed,
his eyes fell upon what he was certain no one could have ever
seen before, hundreds and hundreds of bundles of Bank of England
notes, all wedged tightly together in so humble a receptacle
that it might perhaps at one time even have contained dog
biscuits.</p>

<p>The bundles were all neatly folded, with their contents held
together with an elastic band. Pulling out one haphazardly, he
saw they were all twenty-pounders and it looked as if there
would be fifty of them in the bundle! His heart pounded like a
sledgehammer. He was holding £1,000 in his hand! And, according
to that newspaper report of the trial, there should be many more
than forty more thousands in the tin!</p>

<p>What a good time he could now have if his health stood up!
And his health would stand up, for his life would be just as he
wanted it. He would deny himself nothing! He would have pretty
girls, he would&mdash;ah, but he must tread carefully, for he
had now three secrets to hide, his malady, how he had come into
this money and what he had done to the convict man! Still, he
would take every precaution, he would never make a false step,
he would cover all his tracks, he would&mdash;oh, hell, he had
left the dead man's clothes on the bank of the mill stream,
exactly where they had been taken off!</p>

<p>The sweat burst out again upon his forehead, and his eyes
stood out in terror. He ran out at his greatest speed to the
mill stream and, panting and puffing, returned the clothes
bundled up under his arm. He must get rid of them at once! He
would make a big bonfire outside and burn them until not a shred
of evidence was left!</p>

<p>Then, as he was thrusting them under the sofa so that they
should be out of sight until the bonfire was ready, he saw what
looked like his own knife drop out of one of the pockets. He
picked it up with a puzzled frown and noted the little cork upon
its sharp point. He stared hard, and then his face grew grey and
sickly-looking. "He was intending that for me!" he gasped. "Oh,
what damned luck I locked the passage door every night, and yet
I kept it up more to annoy him than for anything else!"</p>

<p>Something of the intense excitement of the moment now
passing, he could think more clearly and, with no hesitation, he
made up his mind what he would do. He would start off on his new
life at once, almost in a few hours, and he would leave in such
a way that, whatever happened, no one would be able to follow
his tracks. The poultry-farmer of Benger's Flat would vanish,
leaving not one single trace to point to where he had gone.</p>

<p>At once setting about carrying his plans into execution, with
some feelings of trepidation he hid the bank-notes under some
old sacks in an outhouse and bicycled into Mannington to
interview the agent who had sold him the property. He told him
he was shutting up the house and going abroad, for how long he
did not know. It might be for a year and it might be for longer.
He did not expect any letters, except perhaps some circulars
from the firms with which he had been dealing, but he was
advising the post office in Great Bromley to send on all
communications which might arrive, to him, the agent, and he
wanted him to hold them until he returned. He also wanted him to
pay any rates which might fall due, and for that purpose he was
depositing with him £20 which would cover all liabilities for a
long time.</p>

<p>The agent was quite agreeable. "I shall be very pleased to do
anything I can, Mr. Holt," he said. Hardacre was Charles Holt to
him, for the same reason that he'd been known as Clive Hall in
Burnham, because the initials C.H. had been on his two leather
trunks, and he had not wanted to excite any speculation that the
names he had been going under were not his real ones.</p>

<p>The next morning, when the grocer called, the man was most
surprised when told not to call any more. "I'm going away," said
Hardacre brusquely, "and I may be absent for some time. I'll let
you know when I want you again."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Holt," exclaimed the grocer, "what about these
beautiful birds you've got here? Who's going to look after
them?"</p>

<p>"I've sold them all," said Hardacre. "They'll be going away
to-day."</p>

<p>"And may I ask to whom?" said the grocer.</p>

<p>"A clergyman in Ingatestone," replied Hardacre, saying the
first thing which came into his mind, but instantly regretting
his words when the grocer commented: "Oh, that Reverend Owen!
Well, he's lucky to get them, for they might have beaten him at
the poultry shows."</p>

<p>Directly the grocer had gone, Hardacre started to dig a pit a
few yards from the poultry sheds. He had intended it to be a
deep one, but the unaccustomed digging soon began to tire him
and it ended in the pit being quite a shallow one, not much more
than two feet down.</p>

<p>Then he ruthlessly set about wringing the necks of every bird
he had and tossing the carcasses anyhow into the pit. He cursed
many times there were so many of them to kill, but with no
feelings of compunction that he was destroying valuable birds,
quite a number of which had cost him five guineas a head.</p>

<p>The slaughter over and having jumped on the birds to make
them lie flat, he threw back the earth on top of them, confident
that in a few weeks at most the weeds would be hiding all traces
of their interment.</p>

<p>Next, in the yard behind the house he made a big bonfire and
threw on to it nearly everything he had brought with him when he
first came to the Old Mill, almost all his clothes, his spare
boots and hats, his books, his bedding and his leather trunks.
The only personal thing he was intending to keep back he would
pack in the one small suitcase he was taking away with him and
which he would be able to carry on his bicycle. He frowned in
vexation at having to burn so many good things, but he impressed
upon himself he could not be too thorough in destroying every
vestige of his past identities.</p>

<p>Still, at the last moment, he kept back a favourite old
leather shooting jacket. He had had it many years and,
superstitiously, had always believed it brought him luck when
out upon his shooting expeditions on Hainan Island. It was too
bulky to take with him now, but he had not the heart to burn it
and so put it away in the hiding-place they had found under the
boards in the mill, with the hazy idea that, if in times to come
he ever happened to find himself in the neighbourhood again, he
might perhaps pick it up.</p>

<p>The burning was all over in the late afternoon and he had
raked the ashes a little distance away and dumped a few
spadesful of earth over them. Exhausted with his exertions and
the excitement, he returned to the house to await the coming of
darkness. Refreshing himself with some stiff tots of brandy, he
was soon feeling heavy and drowsy, and cursed when, dusk
beginning to fall, it was time for him to start getting away.
Intending to bicycle into Chelmsford, some five and twenty miles
away, he was not looking forward to the journey with a heavy
well-filled suitcase on the carrier of his machine.</p>

<p>Taking a last look round before leaving the house, to make
sure he had forgotten nothing, to his disgust his eyes fell upon
an odd boot just peeping out from under the sofa. It was the one
which the ex-convict had discarded for the carpet slipper he had
lent him because of his injured foot.</p>

<p>He cursed again, this time for his own carelessness and,
snatching up the boot, ran out through the back door and tossed
it into the long grass, on the other side of a thick hedge
bounding his property. Then, running back rather unsteadily, he
tripped over a big stone in his way and, in saving himself, gave
his knee a nasty jar. More cursing followed and, what with his
rage and the effects of the brandy he'd had, after he had
banged-to the back door he forgot to lock it.</p>

<p>As he had expected, the twenty-five-mile ride was most
exhausting. A mile or so from Chelmsford he dumped his bicycle
into a ditch, not caring who found it, and arrived at the
railway station just in time to catch the last train to
London.</p>

<p>Sitting back comfortably in a first-class carriage, his
fatigue was speedily forgotten in his delight at having left his
old life behind for ever. As he gave his mind up to considering
everything, two main ideas were now obsessing him. One, at all
risks he was going to enjoy himself, and, two, if ever the
opportunity should come to him he would get his revenge upon Dr.
Monk. He, Hardacre, would never forgive or forget what he was
pleased to call the doctor's vicious persecution of him.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, he remembered something and scowled in his
vexation. There was a small pocket-book in the pocket of the
leather jacket he had left hidden in the mill and it contained
four £5 notes. He had quite forgotten until that moment they
were there.</p>

<p>*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>

<p>Now in their week's association together Jim Werrick had told
Hardacre many lies, but he had never told a bigger one than when
he had said he had not breathed a single word to anyone either
about the bank-notes or his coming down to Benger's Flat to find
them.</p>

<p>He had told his twin-brother, Tom, everything.</p>

<p>The ex-convict had made out to Hardacre that his father had
been a Nonconformist Minister. That had been a lie, too, for he
and Tom were the sons of a disreputable East End horse-dealer,
who had been in the hands of the police several times for
trafficking in stolen animals. Ultimately, their unregretted
parent had met an untimely end in a drunken brawl in
Whitechapel.</p>

<p>Certainly, Jim had not been badly educated and, sharp as a
needle at school, he had won an entrance scholarship to the
London Veterinary Hospital. He would have got on well in life,
but for the inherent criminal taint which would not be kept
under and which was constantly asserting itself.</p>

<p>Tom was of quite a different type of character from Jim,
dull, rather stupid and quite content to earn a poor but honest
living as a third-rate boot repairer in a little tumble-down
shop in a side-street off the Mile End Road. He had few
interests in life, with never courage enough to go wrong and pit
himself against the law. With a dog-like devotion for his
brother, he was very proud of the confidences the latter often
gave him. He thought him wonderfully clever.</p>

<p>So when Jim had served his time in prison and turned at once
to his brother for a temporary home, the latter listened wide-eyed
to the wonderful tale he unfolded of the riches which were
to come to both of them if he could only find where the old mill
was.</p>

<p>"And I am almost certain," he told Tom later, when his long
detective-like inquiries were over and he was preparing to leave
for Essex, "that I shall find the money at this Benger's Flat.
So you look out for me, my lad, coming back in a couple of days
or so with enough fivers and tenners to paste over the wall of
every room in this blasted little house. I should be back here
at the end of the week."</p>

<p>But he was not back at the end of that week, nor at the end
of the next week either, and, no letter coming to explain his
extended absence, Tom began to get anxious.</p>

<p>Longer than a fortnight having passed, Tom resolved to go
down to Great Bromley and try to find out what had happened. So
he started off upon a bicycle very early one morning and before
midday was inquiring of a woman in a little shop in the village
the whereabouts of a place called Benger's Fiat.</p>

<p>The woman directed him. "But I don't think you'll find anyone
there," she added, "as Mr. Holt has gone away. Still, you can go
and make certain. Anyhow you can't miss the place, for you'll
see an old mill in the distance, long before you get there. The
old mill is on Benger's Flat."</p>

<p>Tom's heart beat like a sledge-hammer. An old mill! cripes,
what a wonderful chap Jim was! He'd hit the nail on the head
right enough!</p>

<p>A few minutes later he was in sight of the mill and its
adjoining house, but thought it best to approach the place
warily until he found if his brother were there. So he laid his
bicycle upon the ground, and crept up to a tall hedge to look
through to see who was about. Incidentally he was very afraid of
dogs, and he had noticed a big kennel just by the mill.</p>

<p>When close to the hedge his foot kicked against something in
the tall grass and, looking down to see what it was, he saw it
was a boot. He frowned in a puzzled sort of way, wondering as a
boot-repairer why anybody should have thrown away a boot in such
a good condition as this one appeared to be. Then, suddenly, he
started, and snatched up the boot excitedly for a closer
inspection.</p>

<p>He could hardly get his breath in his consternation! It was
his brother's boot, one of the only pair he'd got! He knew it by
a patch, the size of a shilling, on the very top of the toe-cap.
Only the day before his brother had left him, when the former's
wet boots were drying before the kitchen fire, a cinder had
jumped out and burnt a little round hole before they had noticed
it, and so a patch had been put in to make it all right. Then
Jim was here, but what on earth did it mean, that he had thrown
away one of his boots?</p>

<p>A dreadful fear filled Tom and, giving no thought now to any
dog, he ran round the hedge and went up to the house. Although
Hardacre had been gone only a few clays, to the anxious boot
repairer an air of desolation seemed to be hanging about the
place. The blinds of the house were drawn, the doors of the
poultry houses gaped wide, and a number of crows rose up,
squawking, as he approached.</p>

<p>He knocked upon the front door, at first timidly, but, his
fears increasing every moment, in a minute or so loudly and
long. Getting no reply, he ran round all the sheds and banged
upon the big mill door. Nothing happening, he stood still and
for some minutes considered what he must do.</p>

<p>There was no help for it! He must go and tell the police! He
was sure harm had come to his brother and he could do nothing by
himself! So he bicycled back at a great pace to the village, and
to his great thankfulness found the village policeman at
home.</p>

<p>He pitched him a tale that more than a fortnight previously
his brother had gone to work with a Mr. Holt at Benger's Flat
and he had not heard a word of him since. He knew he had arrived
there, because he had just been to the house and, although it
was all shut up and the blinds were drawn, he had found one of
his boots in the backyard. He was perfectly sure it was his
brother's boot, because he was a boot-repairer and had patched
the boot the very day before his brother had left him. In the
ordinary way he would have had several letters from him, as they
were the greatest of friends and his brother had promised to
write regularly. He was frightened something had happened to
him.</p>

<p>The village constable, a homely and good-natured man, was
sympathetic, and impressed by his distress.</p>

<p>"But what do you want me to do, my son?" he asked. "Circulate
his description and find out if anyone has seen him?"</p>

<p>"No, no," replied Tom. "I want you to go back with me and
look round." His voice choked. "I believe some accident has
happened to him and he is lying dead somewhere."</p>

<p>The constable considered. Things were a bit slack and he had
nothing particular to do. Apart from that, he was curious, as
indeed everyone else in the village was, about this mysterious
Mr. Holt whom no one but the grocer had ever seen. The latter's
tales about the cases of wines and spirits and hampers from
London he had, so often, been taking up had been of great
interest to the villagers, and many had speculated how a small
poultry-farmer could be affording them.</p>

<p>"All right, I'll come," said the constable, and so, followed
by a mongrel terrier, his inseparable companion, he cycled off
with Tom.</p>

<p>"Now, I can't break into the house," announced the constable
judicially, when they had got off their bicycles and propped
them up against the wall. "I should have to get an order before
doing that." He looked at Tom sternly. "You haven't been trying
that, have you?"</p>

<p>"No, of course, I haven't," replied Tom. "I've only knocked
at the door. I don't even know whether it's locked."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll soon find out," nodded the constable, and he
turned the handle of the front door. "No, that's locked all
right, and I expect it'll be the same with the one at the
back."</p>

<p>They went round to the other side of the house and the
constable began to sniff vigorously. "A stale old smell here!"
he remarked. "See, there's been a lot of burning done, and the
smell seems to me like burnt leather." A few moments later, to
his surprise, he found the back door unlocked. "But that's
funny," he went on, "to be going away for a long time and only
half lock up." He nodded. "Well, we can go inside now." He threw
out his chest. "In fact, it's my duty to."</p>

<p>Treading softly, as if awed by the premonition that some
dreadful tragedy was about to come to light, they proceeded to
go through the house, but to Tom's intense relief did not come
upon, as he had been fully expecting, the dead body of his
brother. In fact, they found nothing suspicious, just rooms from
which all the personal belongings of the last tenant had been
taken, but with the furniture still there.</p>

<p>"Do you see anything belonging to your brother?" frowned the
constable. "No, then he's probably not been here. You've made a
mistake about the boot."</p>

<p>They were in the kitchen when the constable spoke and Tom,
overcome by his emotions, had slumped down on to the sofa and
was wiping over his damp forehead with the sleeve of his coat.
Dropping his arm again, his hand fell upon the big slit in the
upholstery of the sofa and he felt something hard underneath.
Subconsciously he pushed his hand in to see what it was and drew
out the exercise book in which his brother had made the sketches
to amuse Hardacre.</p>

<p>He opened the book idly, but after one glance gave a startled
cry. "Look, look, my brother drew these! He was always making
sketches. See&mdash;there are his initials J.W. under that one."
His voice rose to a shout. "Oh, yes, this proves that he's been
here."</p>

<p>The constable took the book from him and with some interest
looked at the sketches. He turned several pages over and his
face puckered into a frown. Suddenly he raised his eyes and
regarded Tom very sternly. "What's your brother's occupation?
Oh, he was a clerk in Leadenhall Market, was he?" He tapped the
exercise book significantly. "Well, he's been in prison
anyhow!"</p>

<p>Tom's face flushed scarlet. "Oh, nothing like that! He was a
very good chap and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't tell me," grunted the constable. "Why, a lot of these
sketches are of prison life, men in their convict clothes,
warders in uniform and, if I'm not very much mistaken,
this"&mdash;he tapped the book again&mdash;"this sketch here is
one of Colonel Rumford, the Governor of Wakehurst Prison. Now
then, speak the truth."</p>

<p>Tom was a bad actor and he realized it was no good going on
denying it. "Yes," he faltered, "he injured a man in a fight and
got put away for two years."</p>

<p>"I thought so," nodded the constable. "Well, how long's he
been out? Only two months! Then he is on ticket of leave! Well,
what was he doing down here?"</p>

<p>"He had been engaged by Mr. Holt to work for him," replied
Tom shakily. "He saw an advertisement in a newspaper and
answered it and Mr. Holt wrote to him to come down."</p>

<p>The constable accepted the explanation. "Well, I don't know
what's happened," he said, shaking his head. "Mr. Holt went away
last week, and your brother may have been passed over to the
gent who bought the fowls and been too busy to write to you.
Come on, we've done all we can. There's nothing more to find out
now."</p>

<p>But there was something more to be found out and they soon
realized it when they went outside for the constable's dog was
scratching vigorously on what they saw at once was a newly-turned
big patch of soil. They walked over to the animal and at
once the constable began sniffing hard again. "Nasty smell,
isn't it?" he ejaculated. "Something's been buried here."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a grave!" wailed Tom, with his eyes fixed upon the
broken earth. "Perhaps my brother is under there!"</p>

<p>"More likely Mr. Holt," grunted the constable, "after what
you've told me of your relation. Anyhow, we'll soon see if we
can find anything to poke up the earth with."</p>

<p>Searching quickly round, they came upon a broken gardening
fork in one of the sheds, and the constable started to dig
vigorously at one corner of the recently turned-up patch of
earth. He had not, however, to dig long, as Hardacre's pit had
been very shallow for all the bodies of the buried fowls, and,
swollen now in putrefaction, they had in part pushed up the
soil. With his third effort with the fork up came a leg of one
of the big roosters.</p>

<p>"Here," he grinned to Tom, "is that part of your brother, do
you think?" His grin, however, passed quickly to a frown, when
jerking up the smelly bird, he saw there were others underneath.
A few more digs with the fork and he realized what had happened.
The poultry-farmer had ruthlessly wrung the necks of dozens upon
dozens of magnificent prize birds!</p>

<p>He looked significantly at his companion. "And he told
Wilson&mdash;that's the grocer who used to call here&mdash;that
he'd sold them all to another fancier, a clergyman, in
Ingatestone." He shook his head frowningly. "There's something
fishy here. These birds were worth a lot of money, and this
fellow Holt has pushed off, all in a minute so to speak, burying
and burning before he went." He threw down the fork. "Here, you
come along with me. You shall tell your tale to the
Superintendent at Manningtree." He spoke very sternly. "But no
lies to him, my lad. You'll have to make a clean breast of
everything."</p>

<p>So the Superintendent at Manningtree heard the whole story
and, somewhat impressed, a little party of police at once
proceeded to the Old Mill and made as thorough an investigation
as they could. They were certainly mystified, for the remains of
the bonfire in the back yard, so casually raked away, revealed,
from the many buttons found, that quite a quantity of clothing
must have been burned. Also, it was surmised that several pairs
of boots and shoes had met the same fate, as well as at least,
from the brass fittings found, two good-sized leather
trunks.</p>

<p>They got into the mill through the window of the loft and the
mystery deepened, for it was obvious to everyone that something
had been happening there. There was chaos everywhere. Full sacks
and empty sacks were scattered about anyhow. Some of the boards
had been taken up and not put down again too carefully. Also the
wainscoting had been pulled away in places and even not pushed
back at all.</p>

<p>"Now what does it all mean?" asked the Superintendent with
some irritation, after some hours of intensive search for what
they did not know. "This chap spent a lot of money upon his
fowls and fitting up the place, and then, after only a few
months here, he suddenly wantonly destroys everything and clears
off. Why?" He shrugged his shoulders. "The only explanation I
can give is that he had gone dotty from living here alone."</p>

<p>No one could offer any suggestion and shortly afterwards they
all went away, the police retaining, however, the odd boot which
Tom was pretending now he was not quite so certain had belonged
to his brother. "We'll keep it," had nodded the Superintendent,
"and the sketches too, in case any thing more comes to
light."</p>

<p>Tom could have said a lot, but he was too frightened to
speak. Up to a certain point he thought he knew what had
happened. His brother had found the poultry-farmer in possession
of the Old Mill and had had to confide to him the secrets of the
hidden bank-notes. They had searched for them and&mdash;found
them. Then what had happened Tom could only guess, and, every
time he thought about it, he went cold in fear. He believed that
one of them had killed the other and, knowing his brother as he
did, he thought it was the poultry-farmer whose body might now
be hidden somewhere not very far away. He had been terrified
when the police had gone tramping round the meadow about the
house, in case they should come upon more newly-turned earth,
and every moment he had been afraid one of them would suggest
dragging the mill stream.</p>

<p>Returning home that night, he hoped against hope that he
would learn his brother was back and had been inquiring for him.
No such good news, however, was awaiting him. The dead do not
return, and Jim's body was already starting to disintegrate in
its last home, the placid slowly-flowing mill stream. The water-rats
knew where it was, and in due time they would see to it
that most of it would disappear.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; DEEPER IN CRIME.</h2>

<p class="first">FOR some months following upon his precipitous
flight from the Old Mill, Hardacre had no permanent place of
residence, passing most of the time at different hotels in the
West of England. To the man he had killed and thrown into the
mill stream at Benger's Flat he no longer gave even a moment's
passing thought and, quite confident the trouble in Hoichow had
blown over, he was no longer worrying about that. He was sure,
too, from his now so greatly altered appearance, even if he
chanced to run up against them, which was not likely, none of
his old China acquaintances would recognize him.</p>

<p>Thus, throwing off all his anxieties, his health quickly
improved and, to his unbounded relief, the marks upon his shins
had gradually faded right away. To be on the safe side, however,
he always kept plenty of iodide of potassium tablets by him
ready upon the slightest feelings of returning malaise to have
recourse to them again at once.</p>

<p>Still, in his own mind he was sure he had never been infected
with leprosy and, whenever he thought of the specialist, he
cursed him deeply, not only because of the mistake in diagnosis
he had made, but also because of his insistence that it was a
case for segregation in a leper colony.</p>

<p>Tiring at length of hotel life and, intending as he always
had, to establish himself as a country gentleman, he bought the
property of St. Michael's Manor in Norfolk, an old-world house
standing in extensive grounds close to the pretty little village
of St. Michael, about twelve miles from Norwich.</p>

<p>The house was much bigger than he needed but, intending to
mix with the county people, he was sure its possession would at
once give him a good standing among them. Furnishing it well and
in excellent taste, his domestic staff consisted of two maids
and a chauffeur-gardener, the last having his own cottage in the
grounds, but taking his meals with the other servants.</p>

<p>Now passing himself off as Clement Hatherleigh, he let it be
known he had been a traveller in many distant parts of the
world, but was now settling down to devote himself to his hobby
of painting. Certainly, he could paint with far more than
average amateur ability and he told himself he would never be
ashamed to show his work to any new friends and
acquaintances.</p>

<p>He was soon to realize, however, that new friends, and even
acquaintances, were going to be hard to make in so conservative
a county as Norfolk. The social class were by no means ready to
take up a man who had come among them with no introductions, and
about whom nothing was known.</p>

<p>So, for a considerable time, to his intense mortification, he
seemed to be making no progress at all and then, in a most
unusual way, and in one that in bygone days he would have
laughed to derision, he found himself beginning to be received
in the best circles.</p>

<p>It commenced almost at once after he had taken to being a
regular attendant at the village church and present at the two
services every Sunday.</p>

<p>This is the way it had happened. One morning, when he had
gone into the village to post a letter, he saw a young girl in
the street, whom he thought instantly was the most lovely
creature he had ever seen. He had judged her to be about
eighteen or nineteen and her loveliness was of the typical
English kind, beautiful colouring, faultless complexion and
large, deep blue eyes. Her profile was charming and her figure
well proportioned. He told himself she looked the very
perfection of virginal sweetness.</p>

<p>She made such an impression on him that, after he returned
home, he simply could not get her out of his mind and his
thoughts kept reverting to her all that day. More and more as he
recalled her appearance, she appealed to him as the embodiment
of all that was desirable in womanhood.</p>

<p>The following morning, therefore, in the hope of meeting her
again and finding out who she was, he went into the village once
more and hung about for quite a long time. He saw nothing of
her, however, and a dismay filled him that, perhaps, she might
have been only a stranger passing through and he would never see
her again.</p>

<p>Still, every day now he took his walk into the village and
one afternoon, to his immense joy, saw her coming out of the
village general shop. He was so overwhelmed that he dared to
give her only the most fleeting of glances, but he went into the
shop immediately and, making some trifling purchase, at once
found out all about her from the talkative woman who served
him.</p>

<p>The girl was Dorothy Bannister, the only child of the
clergyman of the village, an elderly widower. She managed all
the household affairs at the Rectory. They were not too well-off,
as the living was a poor one, but there were some very
well-to-do people among the congregation and they always saw to
it that the Rector's Easter Offering was a substantial one. Of
course, as the Rector's daughter Dorothy moved among the best
people, and of course again with her good looks, she had many
admirers, but she was not engaged and, at any rate as far as was
known, had no particular fancy for anyone.</p>

<p>Returning home in some jubilation, Hardacre smiled
gloatingly. He might be a sceptic about matters of religion, but
was certainly not one where flesh and blood was concerned, and
there and then, on the instant, he formed the resolution of
getting her for his wife.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, there seemed nothing extraordinary to him
about this decision. It seemed the natural thing, for not only
would he then gratify his passion, but also he would settle down
to a restful family life. The knowledge that he was supposed to
have once been tainted with a dreadful malady did not in the
least detract from his determination, nor the fact that he must
be quite five and twenty years older than she was. He just
wanted her, and for the moment that was all he thought
about.</p>

<p>But while his consuming passion blinded him to the vileness
of his intentions, his common sense soon made him awake to the
understanding that it would be no easy matter for him to gain
his ends. His age would be a great handicap, for there were many
chances against a young girl in all the romance of budding
womanhood being swept off her feet by the attentions of a man
old enough to be her father.</p>

<p>So, he told himself, he must be very tactful and approach her
warily. He must get to know her and, at first, just establish an
acquaintanceship which should merge later into the friendship
which would give him the opportunities he wanted. To begin with
there should be no undue attentions on his part; just the
respectful admiration of a well-travelled and experienced man of
the world.</p>

<p>Having considered the best way to get to know her, he opened
his campaign the following Sunday by attending the morning
service at the village church, and a mild sensation occurred
when, tall and distinguished-looking, he walked up the aisle and
was ushered by the verger into the front pew of the lady chapel.
Facing sideways to the general congregation in the main body of
the church, had he dared, he could have feasted his eyes the
whole service long upon Dorothy, who, in the Rectory pew, was
only a few yards away from him. However, after one quick glance
at her, when their eyes held each other's for a fleeting second,
he looked only in her direction through his fingers when he was
kneeling down. His heart beat painfully as he took in how really
lovely she was.</p>

<p>As the service proceeded, his demeanour was most reverent and
attentive, and no one there in that sacred edifice would have
dreamed the evil life he had lived and how wicked his real
thoughts were.</p>

<p>After the service, he was one of the last of the congregation
to leave, hoping the Rector would overtake him in the churchyard
and speak to him. Nothing, however, happened and with a sigh he
resigned himself to waiting another week before he saw Dorothy
again.</p>

<p>The next day, however, the Rector called at the Manor with
many apologies that he had not come before, explaining that, at
the time Hardacre had arrived in the neighbourhood, he had been
recovering from a severe attack of pneumonia, and when, after
many weeks, he had got well again, the matter had quite slipped
his memory. He was most cordial, and Hardacre took him into the
room he had fitted up as a studio and showed him the picture he
was painting. The reverend gentleman knew nothing about art, but
could well appreciate the cheque for £20 which Hardacre
immediately wrote out when, the conversation turning to music,
he mentioned how greatly the church was needing a new organ.</p>

<p>That same week Hardacre went to dinner at the Rectory and was
introduced, among others present, not only to the lovely
Dorothy, but also to old General Westaway who was one of the
churchwardens. The ex-trader made an excellent impression and,
well-travelled as he was, and a good raconteur, he made himself
so interesting that everyone was of opinion he was going to be
an acquisition to the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>An invitation to dinner and cards at the General's followed,
and, most proficient at all card games, Hardacre undoubtedly
stood out as the star guest of the evening. After that he made
plenty of acquaintances and, taking up golf, was generally
regarded as a good fellow. In due time, sponsored by the General
whose approval carried a considerable weight with everyone, he
was made a member of the exclusive Norwich Club and his standing
as a country gentleman seemed quite assured. His friendship with
Dorothy and her father progressed favourably too, and he was
soon on the familiar footing of dropping in now and then at the
Rectory without invitation, for afternoon tea. With some effort,
he continued to refrain from all appearance of passion for the
girl and played his part exactly as he had intended he would. He
was the deferential admirer and that was all, apparently seeking
nothing more than an ordinary friendship. There was nothing of
the suitor about him.</p>

<p>So things were for some months and then, all in a few seconds
and without the slightest warning, all his confidence and
serenity of mind crashed heavily.</p>

<p>He came face to face with a young fellow he had known well in
Hoichow, and the recognition was almost instantly mutual.</p>

<p>It happened that his gardener-chauffeur was leaving and,
having advertised for another, the very morning that the
advertisement had appeared, he was in his studio when Jane, the
parlourmaid, knocked at the door and entered. "A young man has
come about the place, sir," she said. "He's bicycled in from
Norwich."</p>

<p>"Show him in," nodded Hardacre, and a young fellow about one
or two and twenty came into the studio. He was a nice-looking
boy but, thin and white-faced, appeared by no means in the best
of health.</p>

<p>"I've come about the situation, sir," began the boy, when a
violent fit of coughing interrupted what he had been going to
say.</p>

<p>Hardacre frowned, and in his own mind ticked him off at once
as no good. He didn't look strong enough. Then his frown
deepened, for some uneasy chord of memory was stirred in him.
The boy's face seemed somehow vaguely familiar.</p>

<p>His cough over, the boy went on: "I saw your advertisement in
this morning's paper, sir, and came at once. I can do gardening
and am good at cars. Up to a few weeks ago I'd been living
abroad for some years and&mdash;&mdash;" But he suddenly stopped
speaking and stared at Hardacre with his mouth open and his eyes
very wide.</p>

<p>"The place is filled," snapped Hardacre, anxious for some
reason he did not stop to analyse to get rid of him at once. "I
engaged someone yesterday and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the young fellow broke in in great excitement. "Why, you
are Mr. Hardacre, sir! I didn't recognize you at first because
of the beard. Don't you remember me, sir? I worked at the club
at Hoichow. I'm Harold, sir."</p>

<p>A dreadful shiver ran down Hardacre's spine, and he felt a
hard and gripping pain at his heart. If he had had anything in
his hand he was sure that in his dismay he would have struck the
boy down where he stood.</p>

<p>The young fellow was smiling now and his eyes roved round the
room and lighted upon the big silver cigarette-case on the
table. "And there's the cigarette-case that you won at the
bridge tournament with your initials on it. Don't you remember
losing it, sir, and I found it for you, by the swimming pool?"
He rubbed his hands together pleasurably. "I was so glad you got
away all right."</p>

<p>For the moment Hardacre was quite incapable of speech, and
moistened over his dry lips with his tongue. He was in a
terrible predicament. Of course, he remembered the boy, and he
realized the hopelessness of denying it. Harold Smith had been
one of the under-stewards at the club, one of the most obliging,
and well-liked by everyone, though his one great failing had
been that he always wanted to talk to the members and was
inclined to be too familiar.</p>

<p>Harold went on smilingly: "Yes, sir, I was delighted you
escaped and so, I am sure, were most of us."</p>

<p>With a great effort Hardacre pulled himself together and
tried to look unconcerned. For the moment he could form no
definite plan of action, but he realized painfully that the
situation needed the most delicate handling. He spoke as
carelessly as he could.</p>

<p>"There was no question of escaping or getting away as you
call it," he said coldly. "After that accident I had no wish to
remain in Hoichow any longer."</p>

<p>"Of course not, sir," nodded the boy. "It might have ended
most unpleasantly."</p>

<p>"And there was no difficulty at all about my leaving,"
frowned Hardacre. "No one tried to prevent me."</p>

<p>"Not exactly, sir," said Harold hesitatingly, "but the
superintendent of the prison was dismissed because you had got
away and, because they thought he was being unfairly treated,
the gentlemen at the club got up a subscription for him. I think
it was over two hundred pounds."</p>

<p>Hardacre cursed angrily under his breath. It was just like
the boy to have ferreted out everything. It was common knowledge
he picked up every bit of tittle-tattle, and broadcast it to
everyone. He was of the kind who couldn't keep anything to
himself. A terrible talker, he was the very worst person now to
be in possession of his, Hardacre's, secret.</p>

<p>A long moment's silence followed and then the ex-trader asked
sharply: "But how do you come to be back here in England?"</p>

<p>Harold cut short another hacking cough. "My chest, sir," he
replied miserably. "The doctors said I must leave the East at
once or I should get consumption. They said, too, I must take to
an open-air life."</p>

<p>"Do your people live near here?" asked Hardacre.</p>

<p>"No, sir, up in Birmingham, but it was much too cold and
foggy for me there, and I am to have country air. I came to
Norwich a fortnight ago and have been living in lodgings looking
out for a job. I am all by myself."</p>

<p>Hardacre considered, but not for long. Whatever he would do
later, at any rate for the time being at all costs he must keep
the boy under his sight to make sure he held his tongue. Even
then there was the dreadful risk he would talk to the two
servants. He must frighten him. He must terrify him into
silence.</p>

<p>"When did you last see a doctor?" he asked frowningly.</p>

<p>"Not since I left Hoichow, sir. I stayed with my stepsister,
the only relation I have, up in Birmingham for a little while,
and she thought I ought to go to one, but I knew all I wanted
was good food and fresh air and so I wouldn't go to the
expense." He looked uncomfortable. "My stepsister and I didn't
get on too well together and we had a quarrel. So I left her and
came down this way. I know Norfolk pretty well."</p>

<p>"Do you think you are getting better?" asked Hardacre.</p>

<p>The boy shook his head. "No, sir, I don't believe I am as
yet. My cough is worse and I feel a little weaker." His face
brightened. "But I think that is only because I have been
worrying about not being able to find a job and not getting
enough food either. I have very little money left and have had
to think of every penny."</p>

<p>Hardacre looked most serious. "I tell you frankly you look a
very sick boy to me, and, if you're not fed properly I'm sure
you'll not last long."</p>

<p>The boy looked very frightened. "Does it really strike you
like that, sir?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>Hardacre nodded. "Yes, it does, though at your age plenty of
good food and fresh air should put you quite all right again in
time. Now, I tell you what I'll do. I'll give you the job here
and make the work as light as possible until you get back your
strength. You shall live in the cottage in my grounds and I'll
pay you two pounds a week, with you taking all your meals, too,
in the house. I'll be a friend to you. You understand?"</p>

<p>The boy's white face flushed. "It's most kind of you, sir,
and I'm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But only on one condition," interrupted Hardacre sharply.
"On only one condition, and that is"&mdash;he spoke with the
utmost sternness&mdash;"that you never mention to anyone you've
known me before."</p>

<p>"Oh, I won't say a word, sir," said Harold. "Of course, I
won't. I wouldn't think of it."</p>

<p>"And if you do," went on Hardacre menacingly, "I'll not only
turn you out neck and crop without a moment's notice, but also
I'll give you the damnedest horsewhipping any boy ever
had&mdash;for meddling in other people's affairs." He gave a
final warning. "Mind you&mdash;I shall find out at once from the
maids if you've said anything, in a way I'll not explain to you
now."</p>

<p>But the boy was most emphatic in his protestations of secrecy
and, for the moment at all events, Hardacre was confident he had
frightened him into silence. He would almost certainly say
nothing until his fright had worn off.</p>

<p>So Harold Smith was taken into the service of the popular
Clement Hatherleigh and there was no doubt the boy was at once
in high favour with the maids. Most kind-hearted, they were I
soon making a great fuss of him and doing everything they could
to make his situation a happy and easy one. Seeing how ill he
looked, they were prepared to do most of the car cleaning for
him and help him in the garden as well. The boy was most
grateful and seemed delighted he had found so happy a home.
Indeed, they were now a merry little party in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Hardacre, however, was anything but happy and merry. He was
most worried, and every hour tormented with his thoughts as to
how it was all going to end. He knew there could never be any
peace for him with all his safety and security depending upon
the silence of one who was by nature a born chatterer and would
have the greatest difficulty in holding his tongue.</p>

<p>Already dreadful thoughts had come into the ex-trader's mind
and they boded no good for the new member of his household.
Harold would have to be got rid of! There was no help for it! He
would have to be silenced for good in some way! No, there would
be no downright mysterious murder as that would be far too risky
a card to play! The boy must meet with some fatal accident. He
would be knocked down by the car and it would be made certain he
was killed outright! Or, he would be shot whilst out rabbit
shooting! One of these ways should certainly be able to be
managed, but everything must be foreseen and every precaution
taken so that the death should appear as nothing but
accidental.</p>

<p>These murderous thoughts were now uppermost in Hardacre's
mind, even to the exclusion of Dorothy Bannister and then, all
suddenly, the realization came to him one morning that Harold
could be disposed of in quite a natural way.</p>

<p>It was about a week after the boy had arrived at the Manor,
and Jane, the parlourmaid, the elder of the two maids, had
served Hardacre with his breakfast, but then, instead of leaving
the room at once in the usual way, she stopped to speak to
him.</p>

<p>"Excuse me for speaking to you about it, sir," she said
nervously, "but I am afraid Harold has got consumption."</p>

<p>Hardacre lifted up his eyebrows. "Then have you been studying
medicine, Jane?" he asked with heavy sarcasm.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the girl, "but I had a sister once who
died of consumption and she was just like Harold is
now&mdash;only two months before she passed away."</p>

<p>Hardacre was interested. "But the boy's not really ill!" he
exclaimed frowningly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he is, sir," said Jane. "Some days he says he feels
so weak that he can hardly lift his arms up and every step he
takes is a trouble. Then, when I make his bed in the mornings,
his sheets are soaking wet from perspiration. He tells us he
often feels cold and clammy all night, but I am sure every
evening his temperature has gone up. That's how my sister was,
but we didn't take much notice of it until she became so ill and
we had to call in the doctor. Then he said we had fetched him
too late, though if he had come only two months earlier she
could have been saved."</p>

<p>Hardacre's heart gave a big jump. Gad, there might be
something in it and what an easy escape from all his troubles!
He smiled kindly at the girl. "Don't you worry, Jane, it's not
as bad as you think. That perspiring is quite natural with
anyone who has recently come from hot countries. I used to get
it myself for nearly a year after I left South America. It's
just a sort of after effect of the malaria which we've both had.
Anyhow, I'll take Harold's temperature to-night and see what it
is."</p>

<p>That evening he found the boy's temperature was nearly up to
a hundred and the next morning it had dropped to below ninety-six.
Knowing the extreme variation was a bad sign, he was
greatly elated, but he told the girls everything was quite
normal and as it should be. "You feed him up," he said. "That's
all he wants and you'll see that in a few weeks he'll be a
different chap altogether. Don't you worry. I'll look after him
and, if a doctor becomes necessary, I'll get the best one in
Norwich. I've taken a liking to the boy and will see he gets
quite well."</p>

<p>Hardacre's plan of campaign was now perfectly simple and all
mapped out. Knowing the boy's only chance of recovery was
treatment in a proper hospital, he was intending to put it off
and off until he was certain it would come too late. Then, at
the last moment, when Harold would be too weak and ill to be
likely "to talk", he would rush him into some hospital, a
hundred and more miles away, to die.</p>

<p>He dare not take him away before he was really very ill,
because he knew the boy was weak-willed and unless he, Hardacre,
were by him to rub in every day that he must hold his tongue, he
was positive that, if only for the sake of talking, sooner or
later, he would open his heart to someone.</p>

<p>Then a dreadful catastrophe might follow, for who being let
into the secret that a country gentleman of good standing had
been wanted for homicide abroad&mdash;of course they would call
it murder&mdash;would not be likely to pass it on? Then, in
time, it would be bound to come to the ears of the police.
Inquiries would be made, the whole trouble would be revived, and
then one day, without a minute's warning, he might be arrested
for extradition and trial.</p>

<p>Hardacre shuddered every time at the very thought.</p>

<p>In the meantime, with his passion for Dorothy Bannister as
consuming as ever, he had nevertheless proceeded very slowly in
his effort to merge the now well-recognized friendship between
them into something warmer and more intimate. Though he had
prided himself he had been all along most tactful, yet almost
from the very beginning he had never been quite sure that he was
wholly deceiving her and that she had not instinctively sensed
what his ultimate intentions were. With others present when he
met her, either in the Rectory itself or about the church or in
the village, she always gave him a warm and friendly smile as he
approached. Her manner then was natural and without the
slightest trace of any embarrassment, and she could not be
nicer. When, however, he happened to catch her alone, things
always seemed to him very different. Her manner, then, he
thought, was colder, and every time she was apparently in a
great hurry, with something very important to do. It was exactly
as if she were on the defensive.</p>

<p>Still, he comforted himself that she was more than ordinarily
interested in him, and he believed he stood with her as one
whose colourful life had made him a strong man of resolute and
fearless character.</p>

<p>Another thing in his favour, too&mdash;he was sure she was as
yet quite heartwhole, and that he had no definite rival. He had
been introduced to quite a number of people at the Rectory and
met them afterwards at their own houses and, though all the
young fellows were anxious to make a fuss of her, as far as he
could make out not one of them seemed to consider he had any
proprietary interest.</p>

<p>As the time passed by there came a day when he thought he
might, reasonably, make a step forward and try to get on closer
terms. So one day, in the presence of her father, he asked her
if she would let him paint her portrait.</p>

<p>"Of course," he laughed lightly, "I know I shall not be able
to do you justice, but I'd like to try."</p>

<p>She shook her head smilingly. "No, I wouldn't let you waste
your time. I wouldn't think of it for a moment."</p>

<p>Her refusal was so instantaneous and so emphatic that, in
spite of all his self-control, he showed his annoyance. "But why
not?" he asked sharply. "Don't you think I could make any sort
of job of it?"</p>

<p>"You might," she retorted, "and you might not. You might make
me conceited, or in the opposite way you might make me out so
plain that I should become self-conscious." She nodded towards
her father and smiled again. "Paint Dad, and see what you make
of him," and she tripped out of the room.</p>

<p>Inwardly, Hardacre was furious. He knew quite well he was no
portrait painter and, indeed, he had not thought that he would
ever complete any painting of her. All he wanted from her
sittings for him was to be alone with her and touch her
continually under the pretence of keeping her in the right
position. Also, he was sure that, being so much together as they
would be, a deeper intimacy between them would speedily
eventuate.</p>

<p>He left the Rectory in a very bad temper for, as it happened,
he had then more than Dorothy's refusal to let him paint her to
irritate him. Harold Smith had now been with him for longer than
three months and, day by day, was obviously getting weaker. The
maids were anxious, and pressing he should be taken to a doctor
with no more delay.</p>

<p>Only that morning Jane had spoken about it in so firm a
manner that, if he had dared, he would have rated her soundly
for her interference. She had said she was sure the boy was now
very ill and something ought to be done for him at once.</p>

<p>She had pressed him so hard to call in a doctor that he
thought it wisest to say he would if, within the next few days,
Harold did not show a distinct improvement. However, he was
still intending to put it off for at least a little while
longer.</p>

<p>He was thinking of all this when, as he approached the
entrance to the drive leading up to the house, to his amazement
he saw a car which he recognized as that of Dr. Johnson, the
doctor in the village, pass in between the gates a couple of
hundred yards or so before him. He was furious with rage. Then
the girls, taking advantage of his absence from the house that
afternoon, had dared to call in the doctor without his
permission! Hell, whatever the consequences he would dismiss
them at once!</p>

<p>He speeded up his car and drew up behind the doctor's just as
it stopped outside the gardener's cottage. Jane had been on the
look-out on the door-step and, luckily for Hardacre, before he
could start making a scene got in her say first.</p>

<p>"Oh, Master," she cried, looking white and scared, "Harold
was half fainting this afternoon and I thought I ought to call
in Dr. Johnson at once."</p>

<p>Hardacre ignored her, and the doctor, coming forward to greet
him smilingly, he choked down his fury and shook hands.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I've been a bit long in getting here," said the
doctor, "but I was out and only got the message a few minutes
ago. Now what's the trouble? Someone fainted, did he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Doctor, our gardener," began Jane,
"and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Hardacre interrupted sharply. "You needn't wait, Jane,"
he said, and he waved her towards the house. "Now Dr. Johnson's
here we shall get on all right," and, most reluctantly, after
seeing them enter the cottage, the girl walked slowly away.</p>

<p>Hardacre had picked up his cue and was now all kindly
sympathy as he and the doctor approached the bed upon which
Harold was lying, looking very ill.</p>

<p>"How are you feeling now, my boy?" asked Hardacre. "A little
better! That's good! So you had a bit of a faint, did you? Well,
Doctor's here and now you'll be all right."</p>

<p>The doctor's face became very grave as he examined the boy.
He asked him a lot of questions and then, with an inclination of
his head to Hardacre, drew the latter out of the room.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr. Hatherleigh," he said sharply, "there's no
doubt whatever that this boy's got T.B. badly and I can't
understand how it's been allowed to go on for so long."</p>

<p>"But he's been saying lately he felt better," lied Hardacre.
He put on an anxious look. "But is he really consumptive?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly he is," nodded the doctor, "and without any
testing, I can see the trouble is pretty far advanced."</p>

<p>"Won't he get better?" asked Hardacre with a well-simulated
catch in his breath.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't say that," said the doctor. "He may get well
if he goes into a sanatorium at once."</p>

<p>"And go he shall," said Hardacre emphatically. "A relative of
mine has interests in one in London and I'll ring him up at
once."</p>

<p>The doctor taking his leave, Hardacre went into the kitchen
to speak to the maids. Uncertain how he was going to take their
having rung up the doctor without waiting for his permission,
they both looked rather frightened. Hardacre, however, beamed
smilingly at them. "You did quite right, Jane," he said, "and it
was a good thing you called the doctor in. He says Harold is not
going to die, but he must go into a hospital to be properly
treated. So I'm going to find one for him to-morrow."</p>

<p>The girls looked greatly relieved, but their relief would
have been turned to horror had they known what was passing in
their master's mind. Guilty already of two deaths, he was now
definitely contemplating a third, and there would be delay only
until he was certain exactly how to bring it about with
safety.</p>

<p>His first idea had been to give the boy an overdose of
sleeping tablets and let him be found dead one morning in the
cottage, but he had judged the doctor's character accurately
enough to realize he was no fool, and moreover just the very
type of man who, standing in awe of no one, and if only for the
good name of the profession, would demand an inquest if he were
in the least doubtful about anything. So another plan was
forming in his mind and he was just thinking it over until he
had elaborated it.</p>

<p>The very next day, however, he was forced to an immediate
decision, for another alarming situation arose. He met Dr. Monk
at a garden party near Norwich and was by no means certain the
Cavendish Square specialist had not recognized him.</p>

<p>Drawn like a moth to the candle, he had gone to the party
solely because he had known Dorothy was going to be there, and
he had soon caught sight of her, realizing with a hungry pang
how lovely she looked, all pink and white and just the very
ideal of budding womanhood. Waiting his opportunity when there
were not too many people around, he went up to speak to her. She
received him very nicely, giving him the usual friendly smile.
Then, when they were talking together with his eyes devouring
the beauty of her piquante face, he sensed rather than saw that
a man close near them was staring hard at him. The man was so
near that he must have been able to hear everything that was
being said.</p>

<p>As if compelled by some hypnotic influence, after a few
moments he reluctantly withdrew his eyes from Dorothy and
glanced round. It was only a quick glance he gave, and then he
turned back again. Who on earth was the man? he asked himself,
and a few seconds later his heart gave a big jump and his mouth
went very dry. He knew who he was! He was the Dr. Monk who had
treated him so vilely! He was the blackguard who had tried to
get him herded into a leper colony!</p>

<p>Fortunately, at that moment it was Dorothy who was doing all
the talking, and consequently he had time to take a good grip of
himself before it was his turn to speak. He believed he played
his part well. His voice was steady and he laughed merrily, as
if he had not a care in all the world. Then, when others came up
and, for the moment, he dropped out of the conversation, he
turned unconcernedly round again and let his glance wander on
and pass the doctor, as if the latter were not of the slightest
interest to him. He noted, uneasily, however, that the doctor
was still staring at him.</p>

<p>Presently Dorothy nodded a smiling good-bye to the little
group who had gathered round her and moved away, but Hardacre
remained where he was, chatting to two men friends. Later he did
not hurry to get away from the garden party, but walked round to
talk to some of the other people he knew. He passed the doctor
several times and, indeed, was only a few yards from him when
having tea in the refreshment tent. Several times he caught him
looking in his direction, but was relieved to see he was still
looking very puzzled and frowning hard.</p>

<p>"He can't place me," he told himself hopefully, "and I'm
quite safe. He just thinks he's seen someone like me somewhere,
but he can't remember who it was and it annoys him. Of course,
he won't be recognizing me after all this time and especially as
I've got this beard now." He frowned. "I wonder how the devil it
is he comes to be here."</p>

<p>However, he soon got to learn that, for the doctor, coming
into view when he, Hardacre, was talking to an old lady who
seemed to know everybody present, he drew her attention to him,
remarking casually what a clever face he'd got.</p>

<p>"Oh, that ugly little man!" she smiled. "Yes, he's supposed
to be very clever. He's a London doctor, Dr. Monk," and then,
rather to his consternation, Hardacre learnt the doctor had a
country home on Hickling Broad, not a dozen miles from his own
place.</p>

<p>"But we don't see much of him, socially," went on the old
lady, "for he keeps very much to himself. I expect he's only
come out to-day to see the roses here. His great hobby is
growing roses and he takes lots of prizes at the shows."</p>

<p>Hardacre's complacent frame of mind that the doctor would not
give him another thought had quite passed by the time he was
driving home in his car. He was sure Dr. Monk had been inquiring
about him, for just before he had left the garden party he had
seen him in close conversation with a man who often came to the
Norwich Club and both had been looking in his direction.</p>

<p>So there <i>was</i> some suspicion in the doctor's mind and
he had been asking about him and who he was! Then&mdash;suppose
he came calling at the Manor to see if that suspicion were
well-founded or not! Well, he would show him what a fool he'd been
about that diagnosis! He'd make him feel&mdash;ah, but he
daren't! What if that nephew had recognized him and told about
the killing of that man at Hoichow? God, what a danger he'd be
in! No, if he came he would refuse to see him! Directly he got
home he would give orders to the maid that if any stranger came
asking for him they were to say he'd gone away.</p>

<p>And it would be best for him to go away for a few weeks, to
clear out so that the doctor should not be able to become
certain he was the Charles Henson who had consulted him, for
with any delay his interest might die down.</p>

<p>Ah, but he could not go away and leave that damned boy with
the maids! Alone with them, he would soon start talking
and&mdash;&mdash;He gritted his teeth together. He would get rid
of him with no more delay. He would give him an overdose of
sleeping tablets and put him under the sand floor of his fishing
shed at Salthouse! He would do it at once, to-morrow, and it
would be an act of mercy as the boy was suffering!</p>

<p>Reaching the Manor, he went in to see Harold straightaway
"Now, my boy," he said briskly, "it's all arranged and tomorrow,
first thing, I am taking you up to London to see a doctor friend
of mine who knows all about chests, and you'll go at once into a
home. But we shall have to leave here very early, and you must
be all ready by six o'clock. I'm to give you a good dose of
something to make you sleep to-night."</p>

<p>And certainly it was a good dose of the something that he
gave him, for Harold slept heavily and in the morning was
feeling so dopey that he could eat none of the nice breakfast
Jane had brought in for him.</p>

<p>"Never mind about that," said Hardacre, "and perhaps it'll be
all the better and the jolting of the car will not make him feel
sick."</p>

<p>Just before starting Hardacre gave him another dose of the
sleeping tablets, nearly half the contents of the bottle this
time, in a stiff brandy and water, it being his intention that
by the time they arrived at the fishing shed the boy would be so
drugged that he would take in nothing of the place to which he
had been brought.</p>

<p>Keeping to the by-roads as much as possible, but proceeding
at a good pace, they met few people at that early hour, and the
twelve or thirteen miles to the shed were soon covered. On a
lonely and desolate part of the coast, it was a big, derelict-looking
barn-like wood and iron structure, standing just off an
unfrequented track running behind a line of high sandhills. Once
used by fishermen to store their nets and boats, it had been
untenanted for a long while until Hardacre rented it for a few
pounds a year. He had slept there several times to get a shot at
the wild duck which flew over night and morning.</p>

<p>Glancing round furtively in every direction to make certain
no one had seen him arrive, Hardacre unlocked the padlock on the
big door of the shed and, opening the door wide, drove the car
in, closing the door again behind him. To all appearances now
the shed was as untenanted and deserted as before. Then, for a
long minute he stood still to let his eyes get accustomed to the
gloom, relieved only by the few rays of light filtering in
through the cracks of the tarred wooden walls.</p>

<p>All at once his forehead burst out in a profuse perspiration
and his heart began to beat violently. It was as if he were now
realizing the awful risk he might be running. He was murdering
in cold blood, and intending to bury the body only a few feet
below the shed floor, there to be for anyone who came upon it a
damnable evidence of his crime.</p>

<p>Of course, later on, inquiries might be made about the boy
and, he asked himself, was the tale he was intending to tell
good enough to sound true! He was going to say that at the last
moment Harold had decided to go back to his stepsister and,
accordingly, he had been put into a Birmingham train. That was
the last he, Hardacre, had seen of him.</p>

<p>Then would people believe that story? But why shouldn't they?
What suspicion could they have that he had ever wanted to get
rid of him? Why&mdash;none at all! No, he had only to tell his
story and no one would doubt it!</p>

<p>He lifted the boy from the back seat of the car where he had
been lying and laid him upon some sacks on a camp bed, noticing
with satisfaction that he was no longer conscious and breathing
very shallowly.</p>

<p>Grabbing up a big galvanized iron pail, with furious strokes
he started to scoop out a trench in the sand near one of the
corners of the shed farthest from the door. The sand was soft
and powdery, but it was heavy work and several times he had to
stop for a minute or two to get back his breath. At last,
however, he judged he had got it deep enough and, turning again
to Harold, found he was just breathing and that was all.</p>

<p>He glanced at his wrist watch and scowled. He couldn't be
there for ever. He must be miles away from the neighbourhood
before traffic began to appear upon the roads. His heart beat
violently and the perspiration bursting again upon his forehead
was not now all due to his exertions. He bent down over the
unconscious boy. Yes, he was practically dead and would feel and
know nothing of what had happened to him now! He began to strip
off his clothes.</p>

<p>A few moments later it was all over. The trench had been
filled in and the sand well trampled down until the surface
appeared no different from that of any other part of the floor
of the shed. Then Hardacre was upon the point of opening the
shed door to get away as quickly as he could when, to his
terror, he heard the sounds of a car stopping and laughter and
merry voices just outside.</p>

<p>Almost choking in his consternation, he sprang up upon an old
barrel in a corner of the shed and peered through a crack in the
wall. He saw a lorry with four men and four girls and, from the
things they had got with them, they were evidently a picnic
party which had come to spend the day there. To his fury he saw
the men start to set up a small tent on the level stretch of
sand running a hundred yards or so between the sandhills down to
the sea, while the girls lifted off cooking utensils, rugs and
deck-chairs from the lorry and began to prepare a camp.</p>

<p>He literally shook with rage. He was trapped for the whole
livelong day! He would not dare to drive out his car while they
were about, as it would look so queer to see it appearing
suddenly from an apparently disused shed. Besides, it was quite
in the cards, too, that he might even be recognized as among the
picnickers might be one who actually came from St. Michael
village, only such a few miles away.</p>

<p>Another thought, too, struck him, and it was horrible in its
possibilities. He could not lock the shed door, as it could only
be padlocked from outside, and at any moment it might be pulled
open if anyone strolled over, curious enough to want to know
what the shed contained. Damnation, then how extraordinary it
would look to find a man hiding himself there! Certainly, if
they came near, he might shout to them not to come in, but how
surprised they would be! Of course, they would talk about it
when they got home, and, any day later on, someone might come to
have a look round. Then, what if he had not buried the body deep
enough, and it had begun to putrefy and they smelt it!</p>

<p>With glaring eyes he watched the tent go up, a fire lit and a
kettle put on to boil. Then, hour after hour, he was a scowling
spectator of everything that went on. The picnickers had a meal,
they paddled and gathered shells, they bathed and then had
another meal. Later, they separated into courting couples and,
only a little way apart, stretched themselves out upon the
sands, with their arms shamelessly around each other's
necks.</p>

<p>The long day dragged slowly on, with Hardacre's legs aching
terribly from his long vigil upon the barrel. It was the only
place, however, from which he could watch the picnickers
outside, and he dared not get down, for every moment he must be
on the alert against the chance of their coming near. The day
seemed endless, but at last dusk began to fall and the revellers
broke up their camp, lazily piling their goods back upon the
lorry. Finally they drove off, laughing and shouting merrily,
all oblivious that all day long they had been within a few yards
of a just-murdered man.</p>

<p>Stiff and sore, Hardacre stepped down painfully from the
barrel and, waiting only a bare few minutes, ran out his car and
started to drive London-wards, his one thought now being to fill
himself up with brandy at the first hotel he came to where it
was not likely he would be known. He had no wish that anyone
should remember having seen his car that night, and so for the
first fifty to sixty miles kept as far as possible to the little
by-roads. Into the middle of a pond by a lonely lane, tied round
in a piece of sacking and well weighted down with stones, he
threw everything that had come with Harold Smith from the
Manor&mdash;small suitcase, clothes, boots and all.</p>

<p>Reaching the City in the small hours of the morning, he put
up at his usual hotel and, well doped with plenty of alcohol,
dropped off to sleep at once. Getting up later, he was in good
spirits and quite confident he had got over an awkward
hurdle.</p>

<p>As for Dr. Monk, he was now of the opinion that he had been
worrying himself unnecessarily. Of course, it was all
imagination that the doctor had recognized him!</p>

<p>After lunch he rang up home and told Jane, who answered the
phone, that Harold had stood the journey to Town very well, but
at the last moment had changed his mind and gone up to his
stepsister in Birmingham. He added the boy had said he would
feel less lonely in a hospital near his own people.</p>

<p>"And that'll settle her," he chuckled as he came away from
the phone. "She can think what she likes, and wonder why the boy
does not write to her. Still, that'll be nothing to do with
me."</p>

<p>He remained in Town longer than at first had been his
intention, enjoying himself without the slightest remorse for
the dreadful crime he had just committed. Starting back for home
on the Saturday after an early lunch, the sudden idea came to
him that, as it would not be much out of his way, he would go
and see where Dr. Monk lived. Accordingly, coming to Hickling
Broad, he pulled up his car to inquire of two giggling girls,
who were picking blackberries on the roadside, where the doctor
lived.</p>

<p>The bungalow pointed out to him being about a mile away, he
drove on again, but, about a couple of hundred yards or so
before reaching it, turned into a by-road and, when out of sight
of anyone passing along the main road, stopped his car and got
out, thinking it safest to make the rest of his investigations
on foot.</p>

<p>Entering a narrow lane which bounded one side of the bungalow
garden, he peered through the fence there, and his heart jumped
as his eyes fell upon the doctor himself, sitting reading in a
deck-chair upon the veranda.</p>

<p>He clenched his fists savagely and worked himself into a
blind, unreasoning rage. The man was his arch enemy, the cause
of that dreadful hunted life he had had to live for one long and
dreary year! How he would love to throttle him! If only he could
get his hands about his neck!</p>

<p>His eyes roamed round the well-kept little garden with its
wealth of beautiful flowers. So those were the roses the little
wretch was so proud of, were they? Well, one dark night he would
come and slash them all down! He would spite him somehow!</p>

<p>Tearing himself away with difficulty, he reached the Manor to
learn that all had been quiet and uneventful there. No police
had come prying about and no men from the Health Authorities to
ask any questions about him.</p>

<p>Certainly, he had worried himself for nothing! Of course,
after leaving the garden party, the doctor had never given
another thought to the man whose face had puzzled him! He might
not even have been asking any questions of that fellow-guest to
whom he, Hardacre, had seen him talking. It was all fancy on
his, Hardacre's, part that he had noticed them both looking in
his direction! That was the curse of having a troublesome
imagination! He had been a fool to worry himself over
nothing!</p>

<p>He treated himself to a couple of stiff brandies in his
relief. No, with the doctor so rarely appearing at any social
functions and probably only coming down to his bungalow at week-ends
in the summer and upon his holidays, it was hardly likely
they would ever meet again. The man had forgotten all about him
and there was no danger at all from that quarter.</p>

<p>The next morning he attended the service at the village
church and, as usual, took his seat in the front row of the lady
chapel. He had arrived rather late and, with the service just
about to begin, the church was fairly full. As he resumed his
seat after a few moments of pretended prayer, he let his eyes
roam round upon the assembled congregation. Then his heart
almost stopped beating when they fell upon a man not twenty feet
away. The man was looking hard at him and he was Dr. Monk!</p>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; LAROSE TAKES A HAND.</h2>

<p class="first">ONE morning Chief Inspector Stone was sitting
in his room in Scotland Yard, reading a newspaper. His big,
good-natured face was puckered into a frown. The article he was
reading was headed: "What is Scotland Yard doing?" and he made
running comments to himself as he read along.</p>

<p>"So we don't appear to have much intelligence," he remarked
grimly. "Of course not, of course not! We shouldn't be policemen
if we had! We should be bishops, or Cabinet Ministers or editors
of newspapers instead! Murder in the Eastern Counties seems to
be becoming quite a regular thing! Why not, why not? The public
like murders and they will have them. They are part of the joy
of life! To read about a good murder is much more entertaining
than to read about a good deed! The Yard has failed again! The
public is being let down! Of course they are! We are not
delivering the goods! Not enough black caps are being put on and
the hangings this year are shockingly below their proper quota!
We are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But there was a knock upon the door and a constable entered.
"Mr. Gilbert Larose to see you, sir. He says you are expecting
him," and he ushered in a good-looking, well-dressed man.</p>

<p>Larose, himself at one time an Inspector of the Criminal
Investigation Department, was now in the late thirties, and for
ten years had been the husband of the wealthy widow of Sir
Charles Ardane. It was evident that life had prospered with him,
for he was happy and smiling-looking, and carried himself with
the air of a man who was very sure of everything and had not a
care in all the world.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Charlie," he exclaimed gaily, coming forward to shake
hands, "how are you? Busy?"</p>

<p>The stout Inspector seemed rather surprised at the
question.</p>

<p>"No, no, Gilbert, of course I'm not!" he exclaimed. "I
haven't done a stroke of work since I was made Inspector, just
loafed about and drawn my screw." He shook his head solemnly.
"You ought to know we don't work here." He held up the newspaper
he had been reading. "My boy, don't you ever read the
<i>Cry?</i> It's telling everyone this morning what we do. It
says that beer and women are our hobbies here at the Yard, and
we make them our work, too." He tapped the newspaper. "It
says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Larose laughed merrily. "No, Charlie, it doesn't say that. It
just points out that you are in a little bit of difficulty and
want me to give you a leg over the stile."</p>

<p>The Inspector spoke sharply: "But why haven't you come to see
me before, Gilbert?" He shrugged his shoulders. "Crime, so to
speak, on your very doorstep and you've not smelt the smell of
blood! I said to Inspector Carter only last week: 'What's
Gilbert up to that he's not come to poke his nose in?' Why, with
murder done in your own county, only twenty miles away,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Twenty-four to be exact, Charlie," interrupted Larose, "or
within a furlong or so." He smiled. "I haven't been to see you
before, simply because I've been abroad for the last month. I've
been on a cruise in the Mediterranean with my two boys. I only
got back to London last night and, a letter from my wife, which
I found waiting for me at my hotel, gave me the first news. I
looked up a file of newspapers at my club and picked up all I
could. I phoned you first thing this morning." He frowned. "Of
course, I'm interested. I knew the man, and my wife says his
daughter's been to see her to ask if I would give them some
help."</p>

<p>The Inspector sighed. "I don't think you can, Gilbert. There
are absolutely no clues and, except that we are pretty sure it
was a crime of premeditation, we are no wiser than we were the
first day when the Yard was called in."</p>

<p>Larose lighted a cigarette and settled himself comfortably in
his chair. "Well, tell me all about it. It will be like old
times, hearing you tell the tale."</p>

<p>Stone gave a deep sigh of mock resignation. "It's not much I
can say, Gilbert, and I'll say it in a few words." He glanced at
the calendar upon his desk. "Dr. Monk was murdered twenty-two
days ago, three weeks last Sunday. He was shot through the open
window, when he was having his supper in his own dining-room.
The killer used a twenty-two repeating rifle, and he fired from
the lawn, about ten yards away from the window. He fired two
shots, the first just missing the doctor, and the second hitting
him in the forehead. The killer was a big man, but he was not
seen that night, though he was heard getting back over the
fence. He had got a bicycle parked in the lane, and he just rode
away and that was the end of him."</p>

<p>"How do you know he was a big man?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Firstly, because he left two big heel-marks in the earth
near where he had jumped back over the fence and, secondly,
because a woman and two boys had seen a big man in the lane,
looking through the fence about the same spot, just after five
o'clock on the afternoon of the day before."</p>

<p>"Can't they describe him more than that?"</p>

<p>"No, they were too far away and only glanced at him as they
were passing the end of the lane. The woman did say she thought
he looked a gentleman, meaning, of course, that she didn't think
he was wearing the clothes of a working man. As for him being
big, we have good reason to think he must have been strong as
well, for, after getting over into the garden before shooting
the doctor, he carried&mdash;mind you, carried, not
dragged&mdash;a heavy garden seat close up to the fence, placing
it there so that he could mount upon it afterwards and climb
over to make a lightning getaway. Of one other thing we are
pretty sure, too. The surroundings of the bungalow were strange
to him, because not a dozen yards farther down the lane from
where he climbed over there is a little wicket gate which is
never locked and he could have got into the garden without any
trouble had he known it was there."</p>

<p>"How do you know he fired from the lawn?"</p>

<p>"Because an empty cartridge shell was picked up there, the
one he ejected from the rifle to fire his second shot."</p>

<p>"Is it certain he came on a bicycle on the night of the
murder, the Sunday night?"</p>

<p>"Quite certain! The Norwich police picked up the wheel tracks
on the lane, both coming and going, right up to the very spot
where he got over the fence. Unfortunately, they didn't find
them until a fairly heavy shower of rain had washed away the
pattern of the tyres. They traced the wheel marks on to the
Cromer road about a mile away."</p>

<p>"Was he using a bicycle on the Saturday afternoon, too?"</p>

<p>"That we don't know. The woman and the boys happened to
glance up the lane just as they were walking past the end of it,
and a bicycle might have been propped up somewhere out of sight.
At any rate they didn't notice one. He may have come in a car
and parked it a little distance away. There are plenty of small
by-roads in the neighbourhood where a car could have been left
without being seen."</p>

<p>"And, except for what the woman told you, you can learn
nothing of any particular stranger, either on foot or on a
bicycle or in a car, having been seen at any time near the
bungalow?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever, and it is quite understandable as there
are hordes of holiday-makers about the Broads in the summertime,
particularly so at week-ends."</p>

<p>"And that's all you know?" asked Larose after a pause.</p>

<p>The Inspector sighed. "Absolutely! All the rest is conjecture
and surmise. For instance, we can argue the murder was one of
deliberate premeditation. The killer inspected the surroundings
of the bungalow on the Saturday afternoon, no doubt to see how
the murder could be done, and on the Sunday night he carried it
out. Obviously, he didn't come prepared on the Saturday or he
would have done it there and then with no trouble, for when he
looked through the fence he must have seen the doctor, close
near, right before his very eyes. The doctor was reading on the
veranda all the afternoon."</p>

<p>"How soon was the Yard called in?"</p>

<p>"On the Tuesday. Dr. Monk was an important man in the medical
world, and the strings were pulled at once. He's got a cousin,
too, who's a Member of Parliament, and I expect that had
something to do with it."</p>

<p>Quite a long silence followed and then Larose asked
frowningly: "Well, Charlie, have you formed any ideas?"</p>

<p>The Inspector nodded. "One, that it was not the act of a
madman just out to kill someone, as Miss Monk being closer to
the window would have been much easier to hit. Both shots,
however, were aimed at the doctor. No, it was revenge, of
course. That was the motive. Someone had a grudge against the
doctor, a heavy grudge, and I was hoping we should be able to
single out something the doctor had done in the few days just
previous to his murder which had made his murderer take his
revenge. Unhappily, however, we can't find anything. The doctor
was taking his usual month's summer holiday, he had had a
fortnight of it when he was killed, and during that time he had
certainly been doing nothing which could have given anyone any
cause for offence. He had been spending the days among his
flowers, doing a little fishing on the Broad, going for short
motor drives, and attending a garden party in Norwich. There's
nothing whatsoever to help us."</p>

<p>"The idea is good, Charlie," nodded Larose, "but just a
conjecture, isn't it? The murderer may, of course, have been
nursing his idea of revenge for a long time, for months, perhaps
years."</p>

<p>"I know that," agreed Stone readily, "but the murder was
carried out with such little delay after it had been determined
upon that I can't help thinking some quite recent event had
created or stirred up the urge in the killer to make him act at
once. One day he was looking for a way to kill the doctor, and
the next day he did it. If, as you suggest, he had been waiting
for months or years for an opportunity, why hadn't he tried to
find one before? According to what we know now he could have
found one any time he wanted it."</p>

<p>"There's a lot in what you say," commented Larose
thoughtfully, "but now tell me&mdash;no one is known to have
threatened him? He had no enemies?"</p>

<p>They talked on for some time and then the Inspector asked
smilingly: "Well, Gilbert, are you going to take it up?" His
smile became grim. "Is it easy enough for you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's easy enough, Charlie!" grinned Larose. "We've only
to look among some forty odd million people for a big strong man
who can lift garden seats and ride a bicycle." His face sobered
down. "Yes, I think I'll look into it. I've nothing particular
to do just now and, besides, I know the daughter slightly. She's
a bit old-maidish, but quite a nice girl. I'll go and talk to
her this afternoon."</p>

<p>Miss Monk was overjoyed to see Larose when he drove up in his
car. A few years over thirty, she was not exactly pretty, but
very fresh and wholesome-looking. She was most intelligent, too,
with blue eyes and a determined chin.</p>

<p>"I'm bitter, Mr. Larose," she said. "I'd give all I have in
the world to get my father's murderer hanged. Poor Father, he
was such an inoffensive man and lived only for his profession
and his flowers." Her voice trembled. "We lost Mother ten years
ago and I've looked after him ever since. He was like a big
child to me."</p>

<p>Larose nodded sympathetically. "Well, we'll see what we can
do, Miss Monk, with the help you give us." He spoke
impressively. "Everything depends on you. You are all we have to
rely upon."</p>

<p>"But how can I help you?" asked the girl despairingly.
"Inspector Stone is so sure that something happened while Father
was down here upon his holiday to make the wretch murder him,
but I can't think of the very slightest thing. The days were so
quiet and uneventful then."</p>

<p>"Have you got a good memory?" asked Larose. "I mean for
little things?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite; besides, I keep a diary and that's a great
help."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's splendid!" exclaimed Larose. "Has Inspector Stone
seen it?" and his face fell a little when he learnt the
Inspector had. "Well, let me have a look, too," he added. "I may
find something he missed."</p>

<p>So the diary was produced and Larose ran quickly through the
fortnight preceding the doctor's death. "Well, your father
doesn't seem to have done much," he remarked after a minute or
two, "just staying at home, a couple of afternoons fishing, one
garden party and a few motor rides. About these rides, did you
go visiting anyone?"</p>

<p>"No, Father wasn't fond of society. We nearly always went
somewhere where we could get down to the sea. We would stroll
along the shore and, as often as not, I had a bathe. I don't
remember that we talked to anyone."</p>

<p>Larose tapped the diary he was holding in his hand. "But I
see that twice you didn't go in the car with your father and
that he went alone."</p>

<p>The girl corrected him. "No, not alone. Webber, our chauffeur
who is also the gardener, drove him. Father never drove a
car."</p>

<p>"Then where did they go?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere in particular that I know of, but I expect it was
somewhere to the sea. Father didn't say anything, but Webber can
tell you. He's in the garden now."</p>

<p>"Good," nodded Larose, "then I'll ask him presently. Now
about the garden party of Mrs. Fraser's in Norwich, or the
Monday before the doctor was&mdash;before everything happened.
Whom did you meet there?"</p>

<p>Miss Monk laughed. "Sixty or seventy people, but I only knew
a few of them, because, as I've told you, we don't go much into
society round here and Father wouldn't have gone then, except
that he'd heard Mrs. Fraser had some very lovely roses and he
wanted to compare them with his."</p>

<p>"Then you don't know whom your father talked to?"</p>

<p>"No, we separated. I went about with some girl friends I met,
and Father was introduced to a lot of people by Mrs. Fraser.
Whenever I saw him, he was talking to someone. People seemed to
be making a great fuss of him."</p>

<p>"And did he tell you afterwards about anyone in particular to
whom he'd been talking?"</p>

<p>"No, he didn't mention anyone, but he was very quiet during
the drive home, so quiet, in fact, that I asked him if he'd got
a headache. He said no, he was just tired."</p>

<p>"And he didn't talk about the garden party later in the
evening?"</p>

<p>"Very little. He just said how beautiful the flowers were and
how energetic our hostess had been. After tea, we dine in the
middle of the day when we're here, he got out some of his
casebooks and went through them, and I knitted. There was very
little conversation that evening."</p>

<p>Larose frowned. "What exactly do you mean by his
casebooks?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the records he kept about his patients. He was very
thorough about his records and, when in Town, every night wrote
up about every patient he'd seen during the day." The girl
smiled sadly. "His case-books were very precious to him. He
often went through them."</p>

<p>"But surely not when on his holiday?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>Miss Monk hesitated. "No-o, but he did that evening."</p>

<p>Larose spoke sharply. "Well, you may have told me something
very important. Mayn't he have met some one-time patient of his
at the garden party and refreshed his memory about his case when
he got home?"</p>

<p>"But what if he had?" asked the girl rather scornfully. "The
patient wouldn't have wanted to murder him!"</p>

<p>"For the matter of that, why should anyone have wanted to?"
retorted Larose. He spoke very solemnly. "Yet, someone did." He
shook his head. "No, Miss Monk, we must not regard this matter
in the ordinary way. It is very much out of the ordinary, and if
someone suddenly took it into his head to kill your poor father,
it is just as likely to have been a patient as anybody else. Now
tell me. Your father specialized in tropical diseases, didn't
he? Well, among that crowd at the garden party, did you notice
anyone who looked as if he had lived much abroad? I mean dark
and bronzed, with that unmistakable appearance of having been in
hot climates?"</p>

<p>Miss Monk shrugged her shoulders. "I didn't notice anybody,
particularly, at the time, but there must have been some. There
are plenty of retired army officers and Government officials who
have places round here. Some of them may have been stationed
abroad, and had tropical complaints, Colonel Maltravers, for
instance. I know he was twenty years in India."</p>

<p>They talked on for some time and then went into the garden
for Larose to speak to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Now, I understand, Mr. Webber," began the ex-detective,
"that you drove the doctor out twice in the week before this sad
affair, on the Tuesday and Sunday. Where did you take him?"</p>

<p>The chauffeur did not seem too intelligent and had to think
hard before he answered. "On the Tuesday," he replied slowly,
"we went to Sheringham, and on the Sunday we went into the
country as far as East Dereham."</p>

<p>"Did the doctor pull up to talk to any friends?" asked
Larose. "Did he meet anyone he knew?"</p>

<p>The man shook his head. "No, sir, we didn't pull up for
anyone. We just went out and came home and Master hardly spoke a
word even to me." It seemed that he suddenly remembered
something and he went on rather more quickly now. "Oh, I forgot,
sir, we stopped once while Master went into a church. That was
on the morning of the very day he was killed&mdash;the Sunday
morning."</p>

<p>"Went into a church?" queried Miss Monk, as if very
surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss, we were going through St. Michael's village and
just before we got to the church Master told me to pull up and
wait for him. The bells had nearly stopped ringing when I saw
Master go into the church. He came out again in about half an
hour and then we drove on."</p>

<p>Larose asked a few more questions and, rather disappointed,
returned with the girl into the house. Then, to his
astonishment, directly they had re-entered the room where they
had been having their previous conversation, she closed the door
carefully and said solemnly: "Well, Mr. Larose, I really do
believe you've found out something." She held his eyes with
hers. "I've never known Father go into a church before except
for a wedding or a funeral, and there must have been some reason
for it. I believe now he took that ride, purposely, in the
morning, so that I should not come with him, as he knew I should
be busy about the house. I remember now, too, that after
breakfast he had been looking through a road map and,
subconsciously, I wondered why."</p>

<p>"You can't think of any reason why he went to the church?"
asked Larose, very interested.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No, I haven't the remotest idea, but it
was most unusual on his part, for he was an out-and-out sceptic.
I feel sure now he must have had some special purpose." Her face
fell. "But what could it have had to do with the garden party?
The garden party had been on the Monday, six days before."</p>

<p>"That's nothing," said Larose hopefully. "It was the first
Sunday following and he might have been expecting to see the
party he wanted in church, then."</p>

<p>"But he couldn't have spoken to him," objected the girl, "as
he didn't wait until the end of the service."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he didn't want to speak to him," said Larose, "or,
perhaps, again, the man he wanted wasn't there." He nodded. "At
any rate it's worth following up. Now tell me, do you know if
any St. Michael's people were at Mrs. Fraser's party that
afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Several may have been, for Mrs. Fraser seems to know
everyone about Norwich. I only remember Colonel and Mrs.
Westaway and Dorothy Bannister. I don't know Miss Bannister, but
she's the daughter of the Rector of St. Michael's and a very
lovely girl. All the men were crowding round her at Mrs.
Fraser's."</p>

<p>"One question more, Miss Monk," said Larose. "Wouldn't your
father, in the ordinary way, have mentioned to you that he'd
been into the church?"</p>

<p>Miss Monk hesitated. "Ye-es, I think he would." She looked
troubled. "Now you've put all these ideas into my mind, I
remember I thought he was very quiet the rest of that day, but I
put it down to one of his teeth hurting him. He said at dinner
that he might have to run up to Town the next day to see his
dentist, but he shouldn't decide until he found how he was the
next morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, that may have meant something!" exclaimed Larose.
"It may have had to do with a man he saw, first at the garden
party, and afterwards in the church. You see I'm groping
everywhere to pick up an idea, clutching at any straw I can get
hold of." He smiled. "I shall hope to hear of something, almost
in the very whispering of the wind."</p>

<p>They talked on for some time and then Larose bade her
goodbye, and, learning where the little village of St. Michael's
was, drove over to interview, if possible, the Rector's
daughter.</p>

<p>His good fortune was in, for, driving into the Rectory
garden, he saw an uncommonly pretty-looking girl picking some
flowers there. He jumped out of his car at once and, approaching
her, raised his hat. He had got a tale all well-prepared.</p>

<p>"Miss Bannister?" he queried smilingly. "I thought so. Well,
my name is French and I wonder if you'd be kind enough to help
me. I met an old friend whom I had not seen for many years at a
garden party in Norwich about three weeks or so back and she
told me she lived in the neighbourhood. We chatted for a few
minutes and I said I would come and see her but, absent-mindedly,
I forgot to get her address. I come to you now,
because, knowing her to be a zealous church-goer, if she lives
anywhere near you are sure to know her. Her name is Mullion,
Mrs. Mullion."</p>

<p>Rather to his surprise, the Rector's daughter seemed to be
amused. She shook her head smilingly. "No, I know of no one of
that name."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much," said Larose. "Then, of course, I must
try somewhere else." He regarded her searchingly. "But, I say,
didn't I see you at that garden party, too, at Mrs. Fraser's,
three weeks ago last Monday?"</p>

<p>The girl's smile broadened. "No, you didn't see me there. I
am quite sure of that." She broke suddenly into a rippling
laugh. "You didn't see me, because"&mdash;she paused a long
moment&mdash;"you were not there yourself"&mdash;and she bowed
mockingly&mdash;"Mr. Gilbert Larose."</p>

<p>Larose's face went red as fire. Then he, too, broke into a
hearty laugh. "Serve me right!" he exclaimed. "I ought to have
come openly to you." He frowned. "But how did you know who I
was?"</p>

<p>"I saw you last year at the Wymondham Horse Show," she
replied. "You were pointed out to me and I was very interested.
You were a detective at Scotland Yard once, and Father and I
love detective stories." Her face sobered down. "But who is the
Mrs. Mullion you want? Is there really such a person?"</p>

<p>"No, there isn't," replied Larose instantly. "It was only a
ruse to get some information out of you." He spoke earnestly.
"Look here, Miss Bannister. You seem a young lady I can trust.
Well, I'm a friend of Miss Monk, the daughter of that poor Dr.
Monk who was murdered and I'm helping to find the wretch who
killed him."</p>

<p>"Oh, wasn't it dreadful!" exclaimed Miss Bannister. "And he
was at that garden party, too! I don't remember him, because I
didn't know him even by sight." She spoke sharply. "Now tell me,
what it is you really want to know."</p>

<p>"It's like this," said Larose. "He may have been killed by
someone who was half crazy, and we are wondering if he offended
anybody that afternoon, the last time he went out in public. So,
as a sort of forlorn hope, I'm trying to run through all the men
who were at that garden party. There were some, I know, who came
from about here and I thought your father, as the Rector, would
know all about them and tell me, on the quiet. It was your
father I really wanted to see."</p>

<p>"He's not in just at the moment," said the girl, "but,
anyhow, I don't think he could have told you anything to help
you." She considered. "Let me think. Colonel Westaway was there,
Mr. Hatherleigh and old Major Brown." She shook her head. "None
of them crazy and, it happens, they all attend our church."</p>

<p>"But tell me about them," said Larose. "Now I've taken the
trouble to come here, I may as well get my money's worth."</p>

<p>"Well, it couldn't have been Colonel Westaway," she said,
"for he's been ill in bed the last three Sundays. I know that
for certain, because he's one of our churchwardens and has been
down with pneumonia and is only just getting convalescent. Then
Major Brown is old and very gouty and he couldn't have ridden
away on that bicycle the police say the murderer used." She
smiled as if very amused. "So that leaves only Mr. Hatherleigh
and there's nothing crazy about <i>him.</i> He's an artist and a
very clever man. He lives at the Manor, just outside the
village."</p>

<p>"An artist!" exclaimed Larose. "Then does he make a living
with his paintings?"</p>

<p>"No, he doesn't sell them. He has no need to. He's very
well-to-do, and most generous to our church, though he's not been
here long."</p>

<p>"Is he married? No. Then how old is he?"</p>

<p>"About forty, I think. You would like him. He's a very
interesting man, because he's travelled all over the world. He's
done a lot of exploring. He and Father are great friends, and he
often comes here."</p>

<p>Larose regarded her admiringly. He thought he could quite
understand any bachelor, no matter what his age, coming often to
a house where the daughter was so charming and attractive.</p>

<p>The girl may have sensed something of what he was thinking
for she blushed slightly and then, as if to cover her confusion,
went on quickly: "If you want to know what he is like you can
see him any Sunday at morning or evening service. He has a seat
in the front row of the lady chapel. So you'll pick him out at
once." Then, seeing that Larose made a half sort of grimace, she
added smilingly: "Or if you think my father's sermons would be
too boring for you, you could meet him most afternoons at the
County Club at Norwich. I hear he's a great poker player." She
nodded banteringly. "As the master of Carmel Abbey and one of
Norfolk's prominent men, you are sure to be a member of the
club."</p>

<p>"I'm a member all right," laughed Larose, "though I don't
often go there. As for being the master of Carmel Abbey, it's my
wife's, not mine. I'm only there on sufferance, and if I behave
myself properly." He spoke solemnly. "Now I can depend upon you,
Miss Bannister, to tell no one what I've been asking you, can't
I? You won't let it get back to these gentlemen, will you?"</p>

<p>"No, I should be ashamed if it did!" she exclaimed hotly.
"Fancy suspecting one of our congregation of being the
murderer!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I'm not suspecting him!" he retorted instantly.
"It's just a matter of routine and I'm going through everyone.
So make your mind easy there." He smiled. "As for thinking I
might get bored with your father's sermons, well, really, I
think I must come one day and give them a trial. Do you get many
strangers at your services?"</p>

<p>"No, very few, and when some do come they're often very rude.
We had one, a Sunday or two back, a man, and he got up and left
directly Father started to go into the pulpit. Father was most
annoyed. It looked so pointed."</p>

<p>"I should think it did," agreed Larose and, believing the
stranger might, perhaps, have been Dr. Monk, he controlled the
interest he felt as he asked: "Do you know who he was?"</p>

<p>"No, he had been sitting behind me and I didn't see him. I
don't think anyone recognized him."</p>

<p>Larose broke off the conversation with regret, the girl was
so pretty to look at and was so charming to talk to. He tore
himself away, however, at last and, disappointed that things did
not look at all promising, was half-minded not to pursue his
investigations any farther in that particular direction, but,
most painstaking by nature, he thought he might as well call in
at the County Club in Norwich on his way home, on the chance of
meeting this Mr. Hatherleigh.</p>

<p>Arriving there and going into the card-room, however, he did
not see any strange faces at the tables, but in the lounge,
getting into conversation with a man he knew pretty well, he
remarked casually: "I hear we've got a new member who's a fine
poker player."</p>

<p>His friend nodded. "By Jove, yes," he exclaimed. "Of course
you mean Hatherleigh? Yes, he's a bold player and often takes us
down with very poor hands, but then he's a real gambler and
takes big risks in everything. He's deuced lucky, too. Did you
hear what happened at Yarmouth Races last week?"</p>

<p>"No, did he lose a pot of money?"</p>

<p>"Lose, no gad, no! Why, they say he won a small fortune when
Blue Eyes won the Handicap." He laughed merrily. "It was really
very funny! Old Macaulay here had got the mare all bottled up
for the race and the old devil made out he didn't think she had
much chance. All the same, he was backing her heavily away from
the course, hoping the stalling price would be about twenty to
one. But Hatherleigh, of course, was at the races and he started
to back it wherever he could get the money on. He went from
bookmaker to bookmaker with his fivers and his tenners, getting
even thirty-threes at first. But they soon tumbled to it that
something was up and, in the end, the price was shortened to
four to one. The mare won easily."</p>

<p>"But had this chap, Hatherleigh, got any inside information?"
asked Larose.</p>

<p>"He says not. He declares he just went into the paddock,
liked the look of the mare and backed it on his own. At any
rate, the owner and the stable were furious as Hatherleigh had
skimmed all the cream off the milk, and I believe Macaulay would
have had the mare pulled, had he dared!"</p>

<p>"Hatherleigh must be a funny combination," smiled Larose,
"for I hear he's an ardent supporter of the church in the
village where he fives."</p>

<p>Larose's friend looked very knowing. "Ah, but there's a good
reason for that, my boy, at least everyone thinks so. The Rector
there has a deuced pretty daughter and Hatherleigh's got his eye
on her."</p>

<p>"Where does he come from? Do you know?"</p>

<p>"From somewhere in India, I think. Colonel Westaway got him
in here, on the strength, I'm quite certain, of his having given
some nice fat cheques to the church in St. Michael's. The
Colonel is one of the churchwardens there and thinks
Hatherleigh's a very fine fellow."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you, too?" asked Larose with a grin.</p>

<p>His friend hesitated. "I don't know. I'm not certain. At any
rate I shouldn't like him to marry my daughter. He's presentable
and all that, besides having a pot of money, but he strikes me
as a ruthless sort of devil who would get everything he wanted,
at whatever price, and not be too kind at any time to his
womenfolk."</p>

<p>As Larose drove off on his way home, he congratulated himself
he had troubled to call in at the club. Clutching at straws, as
he had told the doctor's daughter he was, this mysterious
Hatherleigh seemed quite a likely sort of fellow for any
adventure carried out in a bold and enterprising manner.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; AN OLD DOG FOR THE TRAIL.</h2>

<p class="first">FROM the very moment Larose first set eyes on
Hardacre, or Clement Hatherleigh as he was now known, he was
strongly of opinion that if he could unearth any reason for
causing him to have regarded Dr. Monk as his enemy, then no one
would better fill the bill of murderer of the dead man than
he.</p>

<p>The star poker player of the Norwich County Club looked the
embodiment of determination and courage and one who, to attain
his ends, would embark with no hesitation at all upon any
seemingly reckless adventure. He would have no shred of remorse,
either, for any wrong he had done, and, once having rendered
himself safe from discovery, would dismiss the whole thing from
his mind as a matter of no consequence. His conscience would
never trouble him.</p>

<p>He looked all over such a seasoned and hard-bitten man of the
world, one who all his life had drunk deep of every cup of
pleasure he had been able to fill, and the ex-detective
shuddered as he thought of the unsullied girlish beauty of
Dorothy Bannister being given over to him, if even in the sacred
bonds of matrimony. He would treat her like his slave and her
life would be a most unhappy one.</p>

<p>Still, Larose had to admit to himself that in many respects
Hatherleigh was quite a likeable man. Undoubtedly, he came of
good stock, his manners were good and he showed a generous
tolerance of other people's opinions, however much he disagreed
with them. Also, he kept what was probably a violent temper
under good control. He never grumbled either about bad luck when
he lost at cards, paying up cheerfully as if amused to write out
quite substantial cheques, and with Larose now coming frequently
to the club that occasionally happened.</p>

<p>Larose was every bit as bold a player as he was and not
seldom, to the great delight of the other players, the game
often resolved itself into a duel between the two, with Fortune
holding the scale pretty evenly. A gambler himself to his
finger-tips, Larose enjoyed the play as much as anybody, but he
never forgot his purpose in seeking Hatherleigh's society and
was always on the watch to find out something about him.</p>

<p>There was, however, a difficulty, for Hatherleigh was most
reserved to everybody about his private affairs and, so
obviously, not the kind of man of whom one could ask personal
questions. All anyone seemed to know about him was that he had
come from abroad a year previously, bought St. Michael's Manor,
and had been sponsored into society by General Westaway, whose
judgement, it was universally held, could be entirely relied
upon.</p>

<p>Still, Larose was quite certain that, given a little time, he
would be able to single out something, perhaps very small and
insignificant in itself, which would, however, set him at the
beginning of a trail and, in the end, enable him to find out at
any rate a little of the man's past. Then, and only then, would
he be able to weigh up the probabilities of his path having at
one time crossed that of the specialist.</p>

<p>During the first few days of his acquaintanceship with
Hatherleigh he, many times, asked himself if he were not on a
fool's errand and giving himself all his trouble for nothing.
Had he the slightest reason for believing Dr. Monk had been
interested in Hatherleigh? Then, every time he answered himself,
he had.</p>

<p>There had been the presence of them both at that garden
party, the noticeable quiet and thoughtful demeanour of the
doctor as he had been driven home, and his poring over his
casebooks at once after the evening meal. Then on the Sunday had
followed the secret visit of the doctor to the church service at
St. Michael's&mdash;secret because he had gone to it when he
knew his daughter would not be able to accompany him and had
told her nothing of his having been there, afterwards.</p>

<p>Garden party, looking through case-books, and attending
church service! Surely taking them altogether they could only
have meant that he had come unexpectedly upon someone whom he
thought he had recognized as a one-time patient, was peculiarly
interested in him for some reason and had gone to the church
expecting to get another look at him.</p>

<p>But, granted all these speculations were correct and that the
doctor had thought he had recognized an old patient at that
garden party, why should he have wanted to follow the matter
up?</p>

<p>Had the patient run up a big bill and gone away without
paying? That certainly was possible, but, for the money to have
been a large sum and worth recovering, it must have meant the
doctor had seen his patient many times and in that case there
would surely have been no doubt about the recognition at once!
Besides, the doctor was well-to-do and, of the highest
reputation in his profession, it was hardly likely he would be
vindictive about collecting money due to him, from a patient who
couldn't or even wouldn't pay.</p>

<p>Also, was it likely any patient would murder his medical man
to avoid payment of fees due? The idea was ridiculous.</p>

<p>Larose was very puzzled, but still, he told himself, he would
not give up the trail until he had at least found out something
about Hatherleigh: where he came from and who he was. For any
motive for the crime, however, he knew he must find the certain
trails of Dr. Monk and this Clement Hatherleigh crossing
somewhere.</p>

<p>A few weeks after he had made his acquaintance, Larose was
greatly elated when Hatherleigh asked him to come to dinner,
along with some other members of the club, and have an evening
of poker afterwards. He accepted readily, expecting at last to
pick up the clue he wanted.</p>

<p>He found the Manor well and tastefully furnished, evidently
with no expense having been spared anywhere. The dinner was a
good one and the wines were of the best quality. They were
waited upon efficiently by a smart parlourmaid.</p>

<p>All eyes and ears and letting nothing escape him, during the
whole course of the meal the ex-detective was straining every
nerve to notice something among his surroundings which would
give him some idea to follow up. Everything in the room,
however, was so new and so obviously recently purchased, that it
had no story to tell him. There was practically nothing to
indicate what Hatherleigh had been or from where he had come
when he had bought the Manor less than a year before. The only
thing not new that Larose could notice was a rather battered
pocket spirit flask on the mantelshelf and the now familiar big
cigarette-case which Hatherleigh had always had with him at the
Norwich Club. Both were of silver and initialled C.H.</p>

<p>And it was the same when they went into another room to have
their cards, nothing to give the slightest hint as to his host's
former life. Even the very books looked as if they had just come
off the shelves of a shop and, glancing at their titles through
the glass doors of the bookcase, all they went to show was the
catholic taste of their possessor. Their subjects were art,
history, travel, and the masterpieces of some of the great
writers of fiction.</p>

<p>Larose sighed heavily. No grist was coming to his mill that
night and Hatherleigh would remain as inscrutable to him as
ever! Just before midnight, however, something happened and
Larose's hopes went soaring high, for he was sure he had at last
got the clue he wanted.</p>

<p>It came about in this way. All the evening long Hatherleigh
had been smoking his own special brand of cigarettes, fat and
big Egyptians. "El Azzar" was printed on their paper, and a
large tin box of them had been passed round. Most of the guests,
however, had found them too strongly scented and, after smoking
one or two of them, had gone back to their own. Hatherleigh,
however, had gone on smoking them, one after another, until the
big ash tray in front of him was piled high with the stubs.</p>

<p>"I say, Hatherleigh," exclaimed one of his guests
reprovingly, "you'll get a devilish bad heart one day if you go
on smoking strong cigarettes like those, as heavily as you do.
How many do you get through in a day?"</p>

<p>Hardacre laughed. "Thirty to forty," he replied, "and a
thousand last me just about a month. I buy two thousand at a
time."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" exclaimed the other. "Then do you get them at
wholesale rates?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well. I get them in Town and they give me a ten per
cent rebate. They suit me and I've been smoking them for a long
time now. In fact I can't smoke anything else. They cost me
quite a bit, even so."</p>

<p>"'El Azzar'," remarked his guest, picking up one of the
cigarettes and regarding it curiously. "I've never come across
them before."</p>

<p>Hardacre shook his head. "No, I've never met anyone who
smoked them, either. I saw them advertised in the <i>Field</i> a
long time ago. I sent for a box and, as I say, have smoked
nothing else since."</p>

<p>Larose lowered his eyes in his excitement. The beginning of
the trail at last! As with his fellow-guest who had remonstrated
with their host for smoking so heavily, he had never seen an "El
Azzar" cigarette until he had met Hatherleigh, and a man who
bought two thousand of such an unusual brand should be easily
picked up, even among the immense number of shops selling
tobacco in London.</p>

<p>Always a quick worker, early the following morning saw Larose
driving London-wards, and by eleven o'clock he was inquiring at
a high-class tobacconist in New Bond Street for "El Azzar"
cigarettes.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, sir," said the man who had come forward to serve
him, "but we don't stock them. We are so seldom asked for them."
He was most obliging. "But I think, sir, you'll be able to get
them at Ramunsen's in Piccadilly, but that'll be about the only
place in London."</p>

<p>Larose proceeded at once to Ramunsen's, feeling very elated
that his search was probably going to be narrowed down to one
shop. Arriving there, he was told they did keep the
cigarettes.</p>

<p>He bought a box and then, as the man was wrapping them up,
remarked casually: "I was recommended to come here by Mr.
Hatherleigh of St. Michael's Manor in Norfolk. He told me he
always bought two thousand of these cigarettes at a time."</p>

<p>The man looked puzzled. "Mr. Hatherleigh, sir!" he exclaimed.
"But I don't seem to remember the name."</p>

<p>Larose's heart went down into his boots. "But surely you
haven't many customers who buy two thousand at one hit."</p>

<p>"Certainly not, sir," agreed the man, "indeed, we only have
one." His face brightened. "But does this gentleman you mention
happen to drive a green car, a Bentley, I think?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he does," replied Larose, his hopes instantly beginning
to soar again, "a green Bentley with a silver horse on the cap
of the radiator."</p>

<p>"Oh, then we know him well, sir," exclaimed the man, now all
smiles, "but we have never learnt his name. He's a tall, very
bronzed-faced gentleman, isn't he? Oh, yes, he comes here quite
a lot for the cigarettes and we often wonder if he smokes them
all himself? He was in only the week before last."</p>

<p>"But who did you think he was then?" smiled Larose, wondering
with an uneasy pang how far his good fortune was going to take
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, we always thought he was a Mr. Holt from Great Bromley,
sir, although that gentleman is not known to us, personally. You
see at one time we used to mail a Mr. Holt there a thousand of
these cigarettes about once a month. Then all at once we stopped
getting orders from him, and this new customer appeared,
instead. He calls in his car about every two months, taking, as
you say, two thousand each time. So with him smoking about the
same number of the cigarettes, we thought, naturally, it was the
same gentleman!"</p>

<p>"Of course you would," nodded Larose. "It was a strange
coincidence." He appeared to consider. "Let me see, isn't
Bromley in Kent?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Bromley is, but that Mr. Holt lived in Great
Bromley, not far from Manningtree, in Essex, nearly fifty miles
out of Town."</p>

<p>Still uncertain as to whether he had found a mare's nest or
was upon the point of making some very important discovery,
early that same afternoon Larose pulled up his car in front of
the post office of the little village of Great Bromley and
inquired from the postmistress where Mr. Holt lived. He thought
at once that the woman eyed him rather strangely.</p>

<p>"His place is Benger's Flat, a little more than two miles
away from here," she replied, "but he's not there now and the
place has been shut up for some time."</p>

<p>"Do you know where he's gone?" asked Larose, and again he
thought she gave him that strange look.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No, no one does, but I've sent on a few
letters which have come for him to Mr. Raines, the land agent in
Manningtree. Perhaps he'll be able to tell you." Then she added
curiously: "Are you a friend of Mr. Holt?"</p>

<p>Larose sensed somehow a certain feeling of hostility in the
way she asked the question and accordingly picked up his cue at
once. "Oh, no," he replied, "I've never seen him. I wanted to
sell him a gramophone."</p>

<p>The woman shook her head smilingly. "He wouldn't have bought
one. He wasn't that kind of man."</p>

<p>"What was his occupation?"</p>

<p>"A poultry-farmer, but he was only here a few months and then
he left very suddenly."</p>

<p>"Oh, was he sold up?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"No, nothing like that. He just gave up and went away. That
was all"&mdash;she spoke angrily&mdash;"after killing and
burying all his beautiful birds. A wicked shame, I say."</p>

<p>"Killing his birds!" exclaimed Larose. "Why did he do
that?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "No one knows. It was a mystery
to everyone and caused a lot of talk. The police from
Manningtree came over to see what it meant, but they found out
nothing and were no wiser when they went away."</p>

<p>"But to kill all his fowls!" exclaimed Larose. "What an
extraordinary thing! Had he got many?"</p>

<p>"Some hundred, I believe," nodded the woman, "and they were
all prize birds which he had bought full grown, too. Mr. Wilson,
our grocer here who used to call at his place twice a week, was
the only one who saw them alive and he says some of the cock
birds were worth five pounds a head. He keeps a good strain
himself and knows a lot about fowls."</p>

<p>Larose whistled incredulously. "He must have gone mad," he
said. Then he put the question upon which so much depended.
"What was he like to look at?"</p>

<p>The woman shrugged her shoulders. "I don't really know. I
never saw him. He never came off his place the whole time he was
there, just as if he was hiding away. But Mr. Wilson says he was
a tall, big man about forty and very dark. We believe he drank a
lot, because Mr. Wilson was always taking up cases of bottles to
him which had come from London."</p>

<p>Larose's heart was beating quickly. Gad, it was a sure thing!
The poultry-farmer was Hatherleigh without the shadow of a
doubt!</p>

<p>The woman went on: "Still, if you want to know more about his
killing all those birds, just go and have a talk with Mr. Bone,
our constable here. He was the one who dug them up." She pointed
through the window to just over the road. "He lives in that
house with the white railings there."</p>

<p>Thanking the woman for her information, Larose proceeded to
interview the village constable, whom he found in his garden. At
first the latter was not inclined to be too communicative, but,
upon Larose disclosing who he was, he smiled most amiably and
expressed his willingness to tell him all he could. He finished
up by relating about Tom Werrick having come to him in great
distress, fearing that something had happened to his brother and
he was dead, how he had persuaded him, the constable, to go up
to the Old Mill, what they had discovered there and how the
police from Manningtree had found themselves at a dead end.</p>

<p>"Of course, sir," he commented, "as far as we could make out,
this poultry-farmer had done nothing criminal and so there was
no call for us to try and find out where he had gone. Still, it
was very mysterious for a man to kill and bury his own fowls,
though there was nothing unlawful about it." He shrugged his
shoulders. "We let the matter drop."</p>

<p>"But what about this man Werrick?" asked Larose. "What did
you make of his story about his brother?"</p>

<p>"Didn't believe it at first, but from a bit of information I
picked up later, I think some part of it at all events was true.
After saying nothing about it for a week, Wilson, the grocer
here, suddenly remembered he'd seen a man up at Holt's place
once, and when he came to think about it, he was inclined to
think the man had not wanted to be noticed. Wilson had caught a
glimpse of him through the kitchen window and the chap had
immediately ducked back out of sight, as Wilson puts it, like a
rabbit bolting back into its hole. Wilson says it was about a
week before Holt told him not to call any more, as he was going
away. He told us, too, the man must have been staying at the
house, for that week Holt took more bread than usual."</p>

<p>Larose considered for a few moments and then asked: "Is there
anyone up at the place now?"</p>

<p>The constable shook his head violently. "No, and it's all
going to wrack and ruin." His eyes opened very wide. "That's the
funny thing. Holt gave express orders to the estate agent in
Manningtree that although he might be away for, perhaps, years,
the place was not to be let to anybody, but was to be left as it
was." He nodded mysteriously. "Just as if there was some secret
and he didn't want anybody to live there and, perhaps, find it
out."</p>

<p>Larose digested this piece of information and then remarked
briskly: "Well, I'll go and have a look at the place if you'll
kindly tell me which way to go."</p>

<p>"I'll come with you, sir, if you'd like me to," said the
constable instantly. "We can't go into the house, because the
agent's locked that back door, but we can look round, and you'll
see what a state everything is in."</p>

<p>"Splendid," exclaimed Larose, "and then I'll go and have a
talk with the Superintendent in Manningtree. I'd like to have a
look at those sketches he's got."</p>

<p>The following morning Larose was back in London and
interviewing his friend, Chief Inspector Stone. The latter
smiled as Larose shook hands with him. "Back again, Gilbert," he
exclaimed banteringly, "and I suppose you've got the doctor's
murderer for us all ready to hand over?"</p>

<p>Larose smiled back. "I'm not certain about that yet,
Charlie," he replied, "but at any rate I've got a devilish queer
fish in my net and expect to be soon handing him over to you for
something or other." He shook his head. "No, I can't give you
any details yet, but it won't be long before I put you wise to
everything." He took a piece of paper out of his pocket. "Now,
to save time, I want you to give me all the information about
this chap whose name I've got down here, James Werrick,
ticket-of-leave man." He nodded. "But I'd like to bet any money
he's not reported himself at any police station lately. Let me see a
photograph if you can."</p>

<p>Less than an hour later Larose was pushing open the shop door
of Tom Werrick's little boot-repairing shop, just off the Mile
End Road. "Mr. Werrick?" he asked. "Good, then I want a few
words with you about your brother, Jim."</p>

<p>Tom's face went as white as a sheet and Larose added quickly:
"No, no, don't you be frightened. I've nothing to do with the
police, although once I used to be an Inspector at Scotland
Yard. My name's Gilbert Larose. Oh, I didn't think you'd have
heard of me. I was a bit before your time."</p>

<p>"But what have you come to me for, sir?" asked Tom,
moistening his lips with the tip of his tongue. His voice
trembled as he asked: "Have you seen my brother?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No, that's what I've come about." He
eyed Tom intently. "Have you seen him?"</p>

<p>Tom's face showed his relief and he shook his head in turn.
"No, sir, but I've heard from him several times," he said,
averting his eyes furtively.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed Larose. He was sure Tom was lying, but
went on carelessly: "Oh, then where is he?"</p>

<p>"Up north when he last wrote, in Newcastle," replied Tom. He
frowned uneasily. "But why do you want to know, sir?"</p>

<p>Larose ignored his question. "Your brother doing well up
north?" he asked. "That's right! Got plenty of money? Good, I'm
sure he deserved it." He nodded emphatically. "That poultry-farmer
your brother went down into Essex to work for has got
plenty of money now, too&mdash;since he left the Old Mill. He's
got a big house near Norwich, and keeps menservants and
maidservants and lives like a real gentleman. Must have got
quite a good whack of money, I should say."</p>

<p>Tom's face was a study. Amazement, anger and a dreadful fear
were all, in turn, struggling for the mastery. His eyes bored at
Larose like gimlets and he kept opening and shutting his mouth
and swallowing hard.</p>

<p>Larose smiled a stern grim smile and, suddenly reaching
across the narrow counter, gripped Tom firmly by the shoulder.
"Look here, my fine fellow," he said brusquely, "no more lying.
Let's have the truth." He released his shoulder as suddenly as
he had gripped it and went on: "You've not heard the slightest
thing of your brother since that morning when he said good-bye
to you to go down into Essex, because"&mdash;he spoke very
solemnly&mdash;"it is possible your brother is no longer
alive."</p>

<p>Tom's eyes filled with tears and he leant back limply in his
chair. "Why do you say that, sir?" he asked hoarsely. "What
happened to him, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I think a lot," replied Larose sharply, "and I've come to
you because I believe you can tell me something which will make
me certain as to whether what I think is right or not." He
dropped his voice almost to a whisper. "Tom, I have found out
that that poultry-farmer, for whom you told the police your
brother had gone down to work, thinks nothing of killing a man,
and so it is quite likely he may have killed your brother,
Jim."</p>

<p>Tom gave an exclamation of horror and, try hard as he did to
prevent them, the tears welled into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Now you listen to me, lad," said Larose kindly. "If anything
happened to your brother we'll find out what it is and whoever's
done him harm shall be well punished for it. That's the party
I'm going after&mdash;not your brother. I promise you I mean
your brother no harm. It's the other fellow I'm now inquiring
about, and I tell you I'm devilish suspicious about him, without
your telling me a word."</p>

<p>He seated himself on a corner of the counter and went on:
"You listen carefully. I've been down to Great Bromley and heard
from that village policeman you called upon all about your
coming there and what happened afterwards. He took me to the Old
Mill and I tell you it looked a ghastly place to me
and"&mdash;he made a pretence of shuddering&mdash;"just the very
spot to be hiding the secret of some dreadful crime. It was so
lonely and so desolate that a hundred bodies might have been
buried there and never found."</p>

<p>He stopped speaking for a few moments and regarded Tom
intently. He wanted to frighten him and he was pleased to see
that he was doing it. He went on: "Yes, I heard the story that
you told the police and some of it was quite true. Your brother
<i>did</i> go down there and that was <i>his</i> boot you found.
It came out later that the grocer saw him when he was calling at
the house. He only saw him for a few seconds, through the
kitchen window, for your brother darted back quickly as if he
didn't want to be seen. Still, he described him as a smallish
man, very narrow-headed, which he was, very much like you. I've
just come from Scotland Yard and seen his photograph. Another
thing, that morning when the grocer saw him was a Wednesday, a
few days after the day you told the police he had left to go
down there. By the by, what day of the week was it your brother
said good-bye to you?"</p>

<p>Tom spoke with an effort. "On a Saturday," he replied
hoarsely, "on a Saturday morning before the Monday Bank
Holiday."</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "Well, as I say, he got there all right, and
it appears he must have become quite friendly with that
poultry-farmer, for he stayed in the house with him for some days.
The grocer remembers more bread was taken by the man that week.
Another thing again, all those sketches your brother made in
that exercise book were not done in a few minutes, and that also
suggests he was staying in the house for quite a little time.
Ah, while I remember it, one of those sketches turns out to be
that of the poultry-farmer himself. Both the grocer and the
Manningtree estate agent say it is exactly like him, and I
recognized it at once as that of the man I'm suspicious about
for other reasons, the chap who lives in the big, fine house
I've told you about, and who is spending such a pot of
money."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" demanded Tom, stirred to a fierce burst of
anger. "I'd like to get my hands on him. I'd throttle him if I
could."</p>

<p>"That's it," exclaimed Larose heartily, "that's the spirit.
We'll get the brute hanged between us." He shook his head.
"Never you mind where he is. That'll wait for a while, but you
shall see him one day, I promise you, and perhaps it'll be when
he's in the dock, with the old judge putting on the black
cap."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it you want of me?" asked Tom scowlingly, with
his fists clenched tightly in his emotion.</p>

<p>"You know," said Larose sternly, "and don't try to make out
you don't." He spoke solemnly. "I know all your brother's
history and, as sure as you're standing there now, he went down
to that poultry farm on more crook business, crook business
which went badly for him this time, as he's never reported to
the police since." He nodded. "You know there's been a warrant
out for him for all these months for his breaking his
ticket."</p>

<p>Tom made no answer and Larose went on: "Now, I don't pretend
to have the remotest idea of what took your brother to the Old
Mill, but I want you to tell me straight if that poultry-farmer
could have had any reason for wanting to get rid of him. No, no,
don't stop to think of any lie. For poor Jim's sake speak the
truth now. If the man killed him, what did he do it for?"</p>

<p>For a few moments Tom hesitated, only a few moments, and then
his words came with a savage rush. "Because they had found the
fifty thousand pounds which was hidden in the Old Mill and the
devil did not mean to share it with him."</p>

<p>Then, to Larose's almost incredulous amazement, Tom unfolded
the story of the missing bank-notes, how his brother had
listened to the babbling of the dying bank clerk, the clues Jim
had followed up, and how certain he had been that the money
would be found hidden somewhere in an old mill near Great
Bromley, in Essex.</p>

<p>"And they found it, sir," he finished up with a choking
voice. "Of course, they found it! I guessed that when I saw how
the place had been pulled about, but I was afraid to tell the
police, because"&mdash;he hesitated painfully&mdash;"because, if
they dug up everywhere I did not know&mdash;&mdash;" and he
stopped speaking altogether.</p>

<p>"Whose body might be found!" supplemented Larose. He nodded
grimly. "Yes, knowing your brother's record, you would,
naturally, be worried there. As it was, the police, not being
aware of what a strong inducement one of them would have had to
murder the other, there was no broadcast made for either of the
missing men." He frowned. "But see here, Tom, whatever we both
of us suspect, there may have been no murder done at all. Fifty
thousand pounds is a nice big sum and they may have been
contented to divide it. Then, with your brother on ticket-of-leave
and knowing he couldn't properly enjoy his share of the
money when continually under the eye of the police of this
country, he just bolted abroad. So&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, sir," protested Tom vehemently, "Jim would never
have done that. No matter how he's served other folk, he's
always been good and kind to me." His voice choked. "If Jim were
alive, he would have come to see me or sent me a message,
somehow. I'm certain of that. He always trusted me so much."</p>

<p>A long silence followed, and then Larose nodded in agreement.
"I'm afraid you're right, Tom," he said, "particularly so
because this fellow is living more like a fifty-thousand-pound
man than a twenty-five-thousand one. Besides, I'm pretty sure,
too, he's responsible for another job quite as dirty as killing
your brother." He nodded again. "Once a murderer, always one if
the necessity arises."</p>

<p>"But what can we do?" asked Tom miserably. "Should I go and
tell the police?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "Not at present. We've not a scrap of
proof." He looked round the little shop. "Now can you leave this
place and come down with me to the Old Mill? I want you to show
me exactly where you found the boot and between us both we may
perhaps find out something."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll come, sir," replied Tom instantly. "It's a
horrible business, but I'd go through anything to pay that brute
out if he killed my brother"&mdash;he shuddered&mdash;"which I'm
sure now he did."</p>

<p>Driving down into Essex Larose felt pretty hopeful, but, upon
arriving at the Old Mill and letting his eyes wander round and
considering where a body might have been hidden, his hopes fell
at once to zero.</p>

<p>"An almost hopeless job, Tom," he sighed, "now that such a
long time had gone by. Your brother was a small chap and if this
man killed him"&mdash;he waved his arm round&mdash;"he may have
carried him a mile and more away before he buried him. Anyhow,
you show me exactly where you found that boot."</p>

<p>He sighed again when Tom led him round the boundary hedge
and, pointing to a thick mass of undergrowth, said: "Somewhere
in there, sir, I think."</p>

<p>They looked about underneath for any sign of any long-ago
disturbance of the ground, but Larose very soon gave it up as
waste of time. "No good," he exclaimed, "quite useless, as I
say, after so long. The only thing the finding of that boot
suggests is that, if your brother's body is anywhere here, he is
buried without his clothes, which makes it more difficult than
ever to locate the spot, because his body would take up so
little room."</p>

<p>"But mayn't he have been thrown into the stream, sir?" said
Tom. "Isn't that the first place any murderer here would think
of?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded grimly. "Yes, and the first thing the police
would have thought of, too, if they had been looking for a body.
That poultry-farmer would have guessed the stream would be
dragged at once. No, I don't think for a moment he would have
done that, for, remember, he had plenty of time to get rid of
the body in a much safer way. He wasn't in a very desperate
hurry to leave the place as we know he went into that estate
agent's at Manningtree one day, and the next was still here when
the grocer called. It was then he told the man he was going
away. He had at least two days to make everything safe."</p>

<p>"So you don't think you have any chance of catching him,
sir," said Tom despondently.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't say that," snapped Larose. "I'll nail him for
another dirty business if I can't on this." He patted Tom on the
shoulder. "At any rate, my boy, you've helped me a lot. We know
from where he got his money now, and that's a great step
forward." He walked towards his car. "But come on now, I'll
either put you on the train at Manningtree or else drive you
back to Town. I'm not quite certain what I'm going to do next.
It all depends upon a little talk I'm going to have with that
grocer in the village here."</p>

<p>Driving into Great Bromley, Larose proceeded to interview the
grocer. Another idea had now come to him. He introduced himself
and found the grocer more than willing to talk, the latter,
indeed, being intensely curious as to why any inquiries were now
being made when so long a time had elapsed. To satisfy him,
after binding him to secrecy, Larose gave the explanation that
the poultry-farmer had owed a good sum of money to a friend of
his and they were trying to find out where he had gone.</p>

<p>"Now, going back to that day," he said presently, "the last
time you saw the fellow, Holt&mdash;did he seem to you quite
well? Was he in his usual health?"</p>

<p>The grocer considered. "Oh, I think so, sir! He was just the
same as usual when I was talking to him, smoking cigarettes all
the time." He smiled. "That's generally a sign of feeling well,
at any rate it is with me."</p>

<p>"But had he always been looking well every time you went to
his place?" went on Larose. He explained. "I want to find out if
he'd had to go away any time to consult a doctor. You see, he'd
lived abroad a lot and he might have suffered from malaria. He
might have looked feverish and shaky, and been well wrapped up,
even on a hot day."</p>

<p>The grocer laughed. "No, sir, I never saw anything like that.
He looked a strong, healthy chap to me, as if he'd never had any
illness in his life. I don't think he could ever once have left
the place from the day the Manningtree carrier plumped him down
there to when he went away. Besides my usual days of calling,
Wednesdays and Saturdays, I was often up there with parcels and
boxes at odd times when he didn't know I was coming, and I
always found him at home. Except for his dealings with me, he
did all his shopping by post and everything came addressed to
him, care of me, here. He paid me well to bring up everything at
once." He shook his head. "No, I don't think he ever left the
place. Certainly, he'd got a bicycle, which he kept in the
passage, but, whenever I saw it, it had got its tyres flat as if
it were never being used."</p>

<p>"But that last morning&mdash;did he seem upset? Was he
excited?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit! Just as surly as usual, in fact I think he was
surlier than ever then, for when he told me he had sold all his
birds, it annoyed him when I asked him who to."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Pretended to," nodded the grocer. "He said a man in
Ingatestone had brought them and when I said, 'The Reverend
Owen,' he nodded and scowled. I thought at the time I was
putting his back up by inquiring into his private affairs."</p>

<p>"But how did you know it was the Reverend Owen?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>"I didn't know. I guessed. This clergyman in Ingatestone is a
noted breeder of Game birds and known all over the country, and
I thought instantly he must be the man, for Mr. Holt's birds
were all Game ones, too, and of a very high quality."</p>

<p>"Did he buy them from this clergyman in the first instance?"
asked Larose eagerly, scenting perhaps another trail to
follow.</p>

<p>The grocer shook his head. "I don't know, but I shouldn't
think so. Old Owen's said to be a very queer man. He's got about
the best lot of Game birds in England, and refuses to sell a
bird or a fertile egg, so that he can keep the strain all to
himself. He's hardly ever beaten at the shows. He takes nearly
all the first prizes."</p>

<p>Realizing there was nothing more to be learnt from the
grocer, Larose thanked him for the information he had given and
proceeded to leave the shop. There being no customer waiting to
be served, the grocer followed him outside, interested in what
car he might be driving. Tom was sitting waiting in the car, and
the instant the grocer clapped eyes on him he gave a startled
exclamation.</p>

<p>"But surely, sir," he whispered to Larose,
"surely&mdash;isn't that the man I saw in Mr. Holt's kitchen
that morning? He's exactly like him."</p>

<p>"You think so?" queried Larose sharply, startled that the
coming of Jim Werrick to the Old Mill should now be confirmed so
strongly. "But I thought you only saw him for a few seconds,
because he bobbed back so quickly away from the window."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true, sir," nodded the grocer, "but for all
that, I carried away the recollection of a very unusually-shaped
head and face&mdash;just like that gentleman's there. I'd never
seen one quite like it before, so thin and narrow."</p>

<p>"No, heads of that shape are rare," agreed Larose, "but
still, it's a shape well-known to scientific men and they've got
a special label for it." He smiled. "Yes, you're not far wrong
in the likeness. This man's a brother of the one you saw."</p>

<p>"Your luck's in, Tom," said Larose as they drove away. "I
shall be able to see you home. I'm driving back now, but I shall
stop for a few minutes at Ingatestone."</p>

<p>They pulled up in Manningtree for some refreshment in a cafe
there, and Larose found he was taking quite an interest in the
convict's brother. He was so different from what his brother
must have been. Apparently he had no vice in him and in some
ways was as simple and harmless as a little child. He did not
seem to have many interests in life and, as far as Larose could
make out, his only hobby was playing draughts.</p>

<p>"How was it your brother went wrong?" asked Larose when they
had finished their meal and were back again in the car. "You
must have known he was a really out-and-out bad one. Now wasn't
he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," agreed Tom sadly, "he was always wild, but I
think it was only adventure he was after. As a little boy even,
if he had money in his pocket, he'd rather pinch what he wanted
than buy it. Somehow he was made that way." A note of pride came
into his tones. "But he was very brave, my brother, and nothing
frightened him. Though he was small, like me, he was always
fighting someone. He'd take on anyone, no matter how big they
were."</p>

<p>"And you say he was fond of you?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir! He'd never do me a dirty turn. And that's why
I'm so certain he'd have come to me if he was alive."</p>

<p>"But this morning," said Larose, "when I first came into your
shop, don't forget you tried to make out you knew where he was
and that he was quite all right."</p>

<p>"I know that, sir," said Tom without the slightest sense of
embarrassment, "but I wasn't going to give Jim away. Besides,
though I knew it wasn't coming true, I always tried to make
myself think he'd had to hide for some reason and would turn, up
some day." He spoke viciously. "But when you went on to tell me,
sir, about that man with the fowls being so rich now&mdash;then
I knew at once what had happened." He lowered his voice darkly.
"Jim's lights had been put out."</p>

<p>A long silence followed, until just as they were running into
Ingatestone Tom asked suddenly: "Do you believe in ghosts,
sir?"</p>

<p>Larose laughed merrily. "No, I don't, Tom. Do you?"</p>

<p>Tom looked very serious. "Yes, sir, I do, and I believe if I
went down to that Old Mill and stayed the night there my brother
might come and show me where his body is hidden."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you go," smiled Larose, "and then we could
put the handcuffs on that poultry-farmer at once."</p>

<p>Tom shook his head. "But I should have to have someone with
me who could raise ghosts and I don't know where to find the man
I want."</p>

<p>"I should think not," agreed Larose with a grin. "Chaps like
that must be very hard to get."</p>

<p>"Ah, but there is one I know of and I've seen him," exclaimed
Tom sharply. "Sometimes he comes into my shop to have his boots
repaired, but he hasn't come lately and I don't know where he
lives. When he comes in next time I shall speak to him."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Larose encouragingly. "Have a bob's
worth."</p>

<p>"A bob's worth!" exclaimed Tom in horrified tones. "Why, I
have heard he charges a guinea! He gives you what he calls
sittings, and dead people come and talk to you then."</p>

<p>But Larose was no longer listening. He had stopped to inquire
of a man mending the road where the Reverend Mr. Owen lived. The
man pointed up a side road. "That's the vicarage, just past the
church there." He guessed Larose was a stranger and added with a
grin: "You can't mistake it for you'll hear the noise of his
fowls in the field behind. He's got thousands of them." Then
just as Larose was moving off he added: "But you'll find him in
the church now. He's got the evening service on."</p>

<p>So Larose pulled up just opposite to the church and, thinking
they might just as well wait inside, went in. Upon his
suggestion, Tom had followed him. There were only three people
in the church, the clergyman and two old women. The clergyman
was a big, stout man of commanding presence, with a large face,
closely cropped hair and a head which came straight off his
massive shoulders.</p>

<p>Larose had been fearing the service would take some time, but
he was soon realizing there would be no occasion to worry there,
as the reverend gentleman rattled through everything at such an
express speed that what he was saying, although declaimed in a
big booming voice, was quite inarticulate to his congregation,
half of whom, at all events, were intensely interested in the
proceedings. Psalms followed prayers like an avalanche sweeping
down a mountain-side, the lessons telescoped into the psalms
like one train running into another, more prayers were boomed at
breakneck speed, and the final benediction seemed to take little
longer than the flicking of an eyelid.</p>

<p>Larose thought it a truly wonderful performance and, when the
reverend gentleman had whisked himself out of sight into the
vestry, judged it inadvisable to give him more than a bare sixty
seconds to disrobe, before catching him at the church door. Even
then the sixty seconds turned out to have been a bad error of
judgement, as the clergyman left the vestry through a private
door and, upon reaching the churchyard, all Larose saw of him
was a flying figure in the distance, with the tails of a cassock
flapping behind it like the beating wings of a bird.</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious!" he exclaimed to Tom, "if I don't
overtake him in two minutes, he'll have vanished into the middle
of next week. Really, I never saw a quicker worker in all my
life."</p>

<p>Jumping into his car, he drove quickly up to the vicarage
gate, about a hundred yards away. Then, having failed to
overtake the clergyman and seeing no sign of him anywhere about,
he proceeded up the garden path and rang the front-door bell of
the house, waiting, however, quite a long time before he heard
anyone coming to answer it. The noise from the nearby fowl runs
was almost deafening.</p>

<p>A very prim-looking maid in cap and uniform at last opened
the door, and, upon Larose shouting that he wanted to see the
Reverend Owen, she shouted back: "Do you come about the contract
for taking the fowl manure?" and upon Larose nodding an assent,
although he really had not caught a word of what she said, she
came outside into the drive and, after carefully closing the
door behind her, proceeded round the corner of the house,
beckoning him to follow her.</p>

<p>Arriving at a small door in a high fence, studded liberally
at the top with big ugly-looking spikes, she took a key out of
her apron pocket and, opening the door, made room for Larose to
pass through before her. "We've always kept it locked since the
robbery," she called out above the din of the cackling birds.
"It's Master's strict orders."</p>

<p>Larose found himself in a big enclosure, which he judged must
be several acres in extent, and upon all sides were rows of
beautifully built poultry sheds, stretching everywhere to the
high fence which surrounded them. To the noise of the birds was
now added the loud barking of three big and fierce-looking
Alsatian dogs. Larose was relieved to notice the animals were
chained.</p>

<p>The maid led the way to a little group of four men before one
of the sheds, two of them were holding huge baskets to be filled
with the eggs waiting to be collected from the nest-boxes, a
third was in charge of a big hand-trolley, and the fourth stood
ready with pencil and note-book to count each egg as it was
handed up. This last was the reverend gentleman himself.</p>

<p>Larose stared in surprise. The clergyman had effected a
remarkably quick change, being now clad from neck to foot in
long overalls, with only the rim of his clerical collar showing
at the top.</p>

<p>"The man to see you about the contract for the manure,
Master," said the maid briskly, and, her duty accomplished, she
turned instantly and made herself scarce, as if quickness both
of action and speech were the rule of life in the vicarage
household.</p>

<p>Larose thought the clergyman was bigger and more massive even
than he had appeared in the church, and, if he had looked
bull-necked there, to that bovine characteristic was now added a pair
of huge ox-like eyes. His face was frowning and his expression
was very stern. He boomed out at once: "See here, my man, if I
<i>am</i> a clergyman, for all that I'm not quite a fool, and
your offer was pounds less a ton than I would ever accept. You
tell your employers my birds are fed on the best meal and their
droppings are of far more value than the paltry sum they offer.
I will take nothing less than&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Larose, who had at last realized what had happened,
interrupted quickly: "I am sorry, sir," he said, "but a mistake
has been made. I have nothing to do with any"&mdash;he
hesitated&mdash;"poultry side-lines. I came on quite a different
matter," and, producing his card-case, he handed the clergyman
one of his cards.</p>

<p>The reverend gentleman, however, was not to be so easily
satisfied and, just glancing down at the card for the fraction
of a second, demanded angrily: "Then you gained access here
under false pretences. You told my maid that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Larose sharply. "I didn't catch what she
said and she made a mistake." Then realizing that to get any
information out of the irascible cleric he must adopt a more
conciliatory manner, he went on with a smile: "I've been one of
your congregation this evening, in that beautiful old church,
and I just want to ask you a couple of questions."</p>

<p>"About poultry?" queried the clergyman.</p>

<p>Larose laughed. "Good gracious, no! Why I should hardly know
the wing of a fowl from its leg unless I saw it on a plate with
gravy and bread sauce. I'm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've no sense of humour," broke in the clergyman rudely,
"and I'm a busy man, too. What is it you want?"</p>

<p>Larose choked back his annoyance at the other's manner and
replied quite meekly: "It's just this. I understand you are the
biggest authority on Game birds in the country, and I have a
friend a great Game fancier, too. He used to live at Great
Bromley near Manningtree, but he moved from there some time ago
and I can't find out where he's gone. I wonder if you know
anything about him. His name is Holt, Charles Holt."</p>

<p>"Don't know him," snapped the clergyman. "Never heard of
him."</p>

<p>"But didn't you sell someone in Great Bromley some birds,"
persisted Larose, "the year before last?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" thundered the clergyman. "I have never sold
a single wing. No bird leaves this place alive, except it is
travelling to be put on exhibition at a show." He waved his arm
round majestically. "This is the pure Owen strain and it shall
never be debased by any crossing with meaner quality."</p>

<p>Larose was nettled by the man's boastfulness. "But my friend
had birds as good as any here," he retorted, looking round, "at
any rate so they seemed to me."</p>

<p>"A-ah," exclaimed the Reverend Owen with an ugly look, "then,
perhaps, they were the ones stolen from me." His eyes gleamed
fiercely. "Didn't you say that missing friend of yours was
called Bolt?"</p>

<p>"No, Holt," replied Larose. "H-O-L-T."</p>

<p>"A-ah," exclaimed the clergyman significantly again, "Holt
and Bolt sound pretty much the same, don't they?" He nodded
viciously. "And last year I had an insulting letter from a
fellow, Bolt, of Burnham, abusing me like a pickpocket because I
wouldn't sell him a sitting of eggs"&mdash;his arm shot out
accusingly&mdash;"not very long before my roosts were
robbed."</p>

<p>"You don't say," exclaimed Larose, really surprised, "that
someone broke in here and stole your birds, in spite of this
high fence and those fierce dogs!"</p>

<p>"I hadn't got the dogs then," snapped the clergyman, "and the
fence wasn't as high as it is now. All that expense I've been
put to because some miserable wretch has seemingly never heard
of the eighth commandment, or else is defying his Maker by not
observing it." He glared at Larose as if he were the thief and
boomed: "Yes, sir, and to the theft he added sacrilege, for the
robbery took place one Sabbath evening while I was conducting
Divine Service in my church."</p>

<p>Larose tut-tutted several times with becoming gravity at the
enormity of the crime, but then observing that one of the men
behind his master was making a violent effort not to laugh, he
could not for the life of him prevent a ghost of a smile
flitting across his own face, too. The clergyman saw it and his
eyes blazed with wrath. "It amuses you, does it?" he shouted,
and, grabbing one of the attendants by the arm, he made a motion
towards the gate. "Show the fellow out!" he thundered, pointing
to Larose, "and if you ever set eyes upon him again anywhere
about here, tell me instantly and I'll notify the police. I
believe he's only come here to spy things out."</p>

<p>Although greatly amused, Larose was glad to get away and,
driving back into the main road, pulled up at the first hotel he
came to to get Tom and himself a drink. Starting a conversation
with the barman who served them, he soon brought the
conversation round to the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Very eccentric man, that parson you've got here," he
remarked, "isn't he?"</p>

<p>The barman nodded. "He is that, sir, as peculiar as they make
'em." He eyed Larose curiously. "Does he happen to be a friend
of yours, sir, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"No, no," replied Larose, "I've never seen him before
to-day"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"and I shan't be sorry if I don't see
him again. I've just been looking at his fowls."</p>

<p>The barman raised his eyebrows. "Oh, he let you in, did he?
Then you were favoured. Since someone pinched a few of them some
time back he's been mighty particular about who goes inside that
big fence."</p>

<p>"Oh, I was there on business," said Larose. He sighed. "But I
didn't bring anything off."</p>

<p>"He's a bad man to deal with," commented the barman, "and all
he lives for is his blessed fowls. He neglects the parish and is
most unpopular. Everyone wonders why the bishop has not been
down on him long ago." He bent confidingly over the bar. "Do you
know, sir, the Sunday after that thief raided his sheds, he put
up a special prayer in church that the malefactor, as he called
him, might get caught, and when he came to the commandment about
not stealing, he stopped for quite a minute and glared round at
the congregation as if he was certain the chap was among them
there. Oh, yes, he's a rum chap this Reverend Nathaniel
Owen!"</p>

<p>Larose took Tom back to his little shop and, in parting,
pressed upon him two one-pound notes. "No, you take them," he
insisted. "I've kept you from your work to-day and it's only
right I should make up to you for it." He laughed. "Have a
guinea's worth with that spook chap and if he tells you
anything, let me know. You've got my address, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"But one moment, please, sir," said Tom. "You say you know
the man who was the poultry-farmer. Well, tell me what he's
like."</p>

<p>"What do you want to know for?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Because, sir, if I get that spirit man to look into his
crystal and see him, I shall want to be able to tell if he's
describing him correctly."</p>

<p>Larose kept a serious face. "He's a tall, good-looking man,"
he said, "with a very bronzed complexion from having lived so
much in the sun. He's got bushy eyebrows and big, blue eyes. His
nose is big and nicely shaped, and he keeps his lips tightly
pressed together." He had to allow himself a bit of a smile, as
he added: "And he drives a big green car, with a silver horse on
the cap of his radiator for a mascot. So you'll be able to tell
at once if the spirit man is delivering the right goods."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Tom. "I'll write and tell you what
happens."</p>

<p>The following morning Larose was in Burnham, devoutly hoping
that as the insulting letter-writer there was, apparently, a
breeder of Game fowls, too, he might by chance have heard of
Hatherleigh when the latter was at the Old Mill. Indeed, it
might be by no means an impossible coincidence that Hatherleigh,
in the first instance, had bought his birds from him.
Specialists in Game birds could, surely, not be so common that
they were to be found in every corner of Essex!</p>

<p>Mr. Bolt was soon located, but he at once disclaimed all
knowledge of any brother fancier called Holt who had lived at
Great Bromley, and he knew of no poultry-farmer who was
good-looking, tall and of a very dark complexion.</p>

<p>"Really, besides myself, I know of only two men who
specialize in Indian Game," he said, "an old man in Epping and a
clergyman in Ingatestone."</p>

<p>"The Reverend Mr. Owen," nodded Larose. "I saw him yesterday,
and, indeed, it was from him I heard of you." He smiled. "I
understand some correspondence passed between him and you last
year."</p>

<p>Mr. Bolt smiled back. "Yes, and we were both pretty rude to
each other. I wrote him I wanted to buy a sitting of eggs, and
he sent me what I considered a most insulting letter saying he
wasn't going to let every Tom, Dick and Harry reap the benefit
of his years of patient scientific breeding. So, in return, I
let him have it hot and strong, telling him he was a lowdown
fellow and ought to be ashamed of himself for being so
selfish."</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed Larose, "he told me you had insulted him and,
after the rude way he was treating me, I was very glad to hear
it."</p>

<p>"And the amusing thing was," went on Mr. Bolt, "that very
soon after our letters he had about thirty of his best birds
taken. Then he had the damnation impudence to send two
detectives here to see if I'd got them. If the men hadn't been
very decent fellows I'd have kicked them off the place, but they
were as amused as I was and we all had a good laugh."</p>

<p>"They never found any trace of the thief, did they?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>"No, not a sign of him," replied Mr. Bolt, "and everyone was
delighted." He frowned. "But, you know, at the back of my mind
I've always got a sort of hunch that I know who the thief was.
He was a chap who came to stay here in Burnham for some months,
getting on now for about two years ago. I got to know him pretty
well, and he became very interested in my birds, thinking he
might one day take up poultry-farming himself. I told him what a
pig this clergyman was, and how he pricked all the eggs he sold
so that they were useless for hatching, and he said he ought to
be shot. This chap I'm telling you of always struck me as a
bold, reckless fellow, and, if he wanted that parson's fowls and
he wouldn't sell them&mdash;then he was just the very one who'd
have gone and taken them himself. He'd lived a very adventurous
life and didn't seem to know what fear was."</p>

<p>Then suddenly a startled expression came upon Mr. Bolt's
face. "Ah," he exclaimed sharply, nodding vigorously, "and this
man answers to the very description of the one you want. He was
tall, fine-looking, and he was burnt a deep brown from being in
the East. He told me he had recently come from South America
only a few days before he arrived here in Burnham."</p>

<p>Larose's heart gave an exultant bound. "What did he call
himself here?" he asked quickly, and he was so excited that he
could hardly get his words out.</p>

<p>"Hall," replied Mr. Bolt. "I don't know his Christian name,
but it commenced with C because I saw C.H. on a silver
cigarette-case he always had with him." He smiled. "He smoked
cigarette after cigarette almost all day long."</p>

<p>"God," murmured Larose under his breath. "C. Hall here,
Charles Holt at the Old Mill, and Clement Hatherleigh at St.
Michael's Manor, always C.H. and all, perhaps, because of that
cigarette-case. The old, old story of the smartest crook making
his one great mistake."</p>

<p>Then he heard the whole tale of the quiet, taciturn man
descending one evening from nowhere upon the little town, the
secluded life he had led at the little inn, his apparent
reluctance to be seen by anyone, and, finally, his going away,
where no one knew, at less than an hour's notice.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the same story was being dragged out in
more detail from the landlord of the Pilot Inn, dragged out not
because of the man's unwillingness to tell everything he knew,
but because he was naturally slow of thought and had to think a
lot before he answered any question.</p>

<p>Presently Larose asked: "And when did this Mr. Hall come to
stop with you? Can you find out for me the exact date?"</p>

<p>After a few moments' consideration the innkeeper's face took
a sudden brightening up. "Oh, yes, sir, I can tell you that
right off," he replied, "without looking at any of my books. He
arrived here two years ago on September the fifteenth. I
remember the date exactly because it was my birthday, and I said
to the missus that night what a nice birthday present it was, a
gent, perhaps coming to board with us for the whole winter. It
was a Saturday evening, too, I recollect, because I had driven
two young fellows to the station, whose holiday was up. Then,
when the train comes in, out jumped Mr. Hall right in front of
me and, to my amazement, asked me to drive him to my place here.
He stopped with us all through the winter."</p>

<p>"And when did he leave?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Easter Bank Holiday. I remember that, too, because we
thought it an awkward day for him to be travelling, with the
trains all altered and at sixes and sevens. He didn't give us
any warning he was going to leave us. He just came into the
kitchen at six o'clock that morning and said he must catch the
seven-twenty to London."</p>

<p>At that moment the landlord's wife came in and, explaining
that he wanted to find out all he could about this Mr. Hall, and
finding her much more intelligent than her husband, Larose at
once transferred his questions to her.</p>

<p>"And he never left you for a single day, you say," he asked,
"the whole time he was here?"</p>

<p>"Only to go for a ride on his bicycle," replied the woman,
"and that was only not very long before he went away."</p>

<p>"Did he seem to you quite well?" was Larose's next question.
"I mean, do you think he'd been under a doctor's care
lately?"</p>

<p>The woman hesitated. "He seemed all right, sir, upon first
seeing him that night, but the next morning we both thought he
looked very haggard and drawn. Although the weather was very
mild, he had a big fire going all day long and never left it. He
told us he had recently come from abroad and felt the cold
terribly."</p>

<p>"Was he taking any medicine, do you know," asked Larose at
once thinking of malaria, "a powdered stuff, like quinine?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he was always taking medicine, sir," nodded the woman,
"but of course I don't know what it was. He took little white
tablets the whole time he was with us and, after he'd left, we
threw away a whole heap of empty bottles."</p>

<p>"Where had the bottles come from, from which chemist, I
mean?" asked Larose sharply.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I don't know. I don't remember the name
on the bottles, but they used to come to him by post from
somewhere in London."</p>

<p>And that was all Larose could learn, enough, however, for him
to drive Norfolk-wards in a very exultant frame of mind. Jove,
what a lot he had found out in the past twenty-four hours! He
had got upon the so-called Hatherleigh's trail with a vengeance,
and already knew him to be a receiver of stolen money, if not a
murderer as well.</p>

<p>Now, all he, Larose, had to do was to connect him up with Dr.
Monk, and that he felt confident he would be able to manage
through the latter's case-book. If his, Larose's, theorizing
were correct, he would have consulted the doctor just prior to
that Saturday, September the fifteenth, two years ago. No matter
what name he had given the doctor, he would almost certainly
have given his correct age, about forty, and with the age of
every patient always recorded in the book, that would help a lot
in picking him out. If necessary, every patient in the case-book
about that time would be checked up.</p>

<p>Larose frowned here. But what the devil could Dr. Monk have
done to make it necessary for his patient to murder him, just
because he thought he had recognized him at that garden
party?</p>

<p>Arriving at Hickling Broad early that afternoon, Larose was
soon in possession of the case-books, but, upon opening the one
recording about all the patients attended during the year two
years back, he could hardly suppress a cry of bitter
disappointment.</p>

<p>To his great mortification there were no records at all for
the months of August and September. The doctor had been away
upon a long holiday.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; THE TRAIL OF MURDER.</h2>

<p class="first">THAT night, returning home to Carmel Abbey,
Larose was in a decidedly downcast frame of mind. He was almost
certain that in the so-called Hatherleigh he had a most
dangerous criminal to deal with, and a man who in all
probability was responsible for one, if not two, murders. Yet he
was equally certain he had not the very slightest proof of the
committing of either crime which would carry conviction in any
court of law.</p>

<p>Of course, Hatherleigh's trail back to the little town of
Burnham on the Grouch through the Old Mill at Great Bromley was
quite clear now, but there it stopped and nothing absolutely
certain was to be picked up on the way. Who would believe the
seemingly fantastic story of the Mile End Road boot repairer
about his brother having located the hiding-place of the
£50,000, stolen those years ago by the now dead Lothbury bank
clerk? Who would believe it without definite proof, and how was
that proof to be forthcoming?</p>

<p>Of course, it was most suspicious the way in which the
Benger's Flat poultry-farmer had come to leave the Old Mill and,
if Tom Werrick's story was true, Jim Werrick's silence after all
these months had a most sinister aspect. But what good were
suspicion and conjecture, without any proof to substantiate
them? Why, no good at all!</p>

<p>Larose, however, was possessed of infinite patience, a
patience which upon so many occasions in his adventurous career
had enabled him to triumph in the end, and so there was to be no
slackening in his determination to continue his investigations,
however profitless they might turn out to be.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the following afternoon he was back again at the
Norwich Club, greeting Hardacre as if he were one of the most
agreeable fellows to know. In the ensuing fortnight, too, he
cultivated his society quite a lot, going a second time to the
Manor for an evening of poker and, one Saturday, accompanying
him to a race-meeting at Sandown Park, and remaining with him
for the night in Town.</p>

<p>Of express purpose, he let him arrange everything, putting up
at the hotel he suggested, the Hotel Splendide, just off
Piccadilly. "I always stop here," explained Hardacre, "and they
look after me very well."</p>

<p>At the races Hardacre plunged heavily, coming out a
substantial winner. Larose noticed he appeared to be well-known
to several of the big book-makers, some of them addressing him
by name.</p>

<p>"Good," nodded Larose to himself, "then he's only been
betting in a big way since he became Clement Hatherleigh.
Another pointer that he got his hands on that money."</p>

<p>After dinner Hardacre suggested they should go to a certain
night-club he knew of. "I'm six hundred to the good over this
afternoon," he said, "and with any luck to-night I'll make it up
to a thousand. You can play as heavily as you like where I'll
take you to."</p>

<p>Wanting to learn everything of the man's way of life he
could, Larose agreed at once, and so, under Hardacre's
direction, a taxi took them to what looked quite a respectable
good-class house, in the best part of Earl's Court. Upon ringing
the bell, the door was opened by an athletic-looking man who was
not unlike a prizefighter in appearance. His inquiring frown at
once changed into a smile as he recognized Hardacre and he led
them to the end of a long passage where a brief inspection was
gone through before they were admitted to a large and
sumptuously furnished room, containing between thirty and forty
people gathered round a roulette table. Upon a buffet were
spread out refreshments on a lavish scale, including spirits and
champagne. Apparently, everything was supplied free.</p>

<p>The place was evidently a popular gambling hell, and there
were quite as many women present as men. Everyone was well
dressed, and, apparently, there was plenty of money available to
play with, the lowest stake allowed being a pound. Hardacre
plunged at once into the play, and making lucky ventures was
quickly up about £50. Larose risked a few pounds but with no
success, and he soon stopped, being much more interested in the
people than the play.</p>

<p>"A lot of pigeons to be plucked here," he told himself, "and
quite a good sprinkling of crooks to pluck them. Gad, but this
Hatherleigh has the devil's luck!"</p>

<p>Presently, he thought he felt his elbow gently nudged, but
imagined the nudging to have been quite accidental. He turned
slightly, however, to see who was pressing him so closely and
saw he was a tall military-looking man. The latter was looking
straight before him, apparently intent only on watching the
play. Then, to his amazement, Larose heard himself being
addressed by name. The military-looking man was speaking in low
tones, between lips which made no movement.</p>

<p>"Don't start, don't look round," said the man, "but I believe
you are Mr. Larose. Then clear out of this as quickly as you
can. It won't be healthy here in a few minutes. I'm from the
C.I.D. I remember you at the Yard ten years ago. I was a
youngster then."</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Larose, keeping his lips perfectly
still, too. "What's up, a raid?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and timed for eleven-five," replied the man. "So you be
quick, for it's just on eleven now. Take that party who came in
with you, too, unless you want him caught." Then he added
sharply: "Is he a friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"No, only an acquaintance," whispered back Larose.</p>

<p>"Then mind your steps," was the stern injunction. "We think
him a bad egg. He's often here and a great goer with the flash
women. Now cut off, quick. I'm here to see they don't bar that
door. It's steel lined to make breaking-in hard, and we're not
certain how many exits they've got. My name's Travers if you
ever want to contact me at the Yard."</p>

<p>Larose sidled up to Hardacre, and, ignoring his frowning
face, drew him out of the crowd round the table. He panted and
simulated being in great distress.</p>

<p>"Here, take me out of this," he whispered hoarsely. "I'm
going to have a heart attack. I'm subject to them. You must run
me into the Earl's Court hospital. It's close here and they'll
give me a morphia injection. Quick, or I may peg out in this hot
room. Get me into the open air."</p>

<p>Hardacre cursed savagely under his breath. His luck was in at
the table and he didn't want to leave. On the other hand, he was
scared by the look of agony on Larose's face. What a scandal if
the fellow died there! Of course an inquest would follow and it
would be in all the papers that he, Hardacre, had been with him
in a gambling hell at the moment of his death! Gad, it would
mean the end of all the church business at St. Michael's, and
Dorothy Bannister would be lost to him for good!</p>

<p>So, supporting Larose, who leant heavily on him, they were
soon out of the house and driving away in a taxi. The cool air
had, apparently, done a lot to revive Larose and he now said he
would prefer to go back to the hotel.</p>

<p>A silence ensued until they were well on the way to their
destination and then, to Hardacre's amazement, Larose burst into
a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"Sorry to frighten you, my dear chap," he exclaimed, "but I
had to play the goat or I shouldn't have got you away in time.
That place was going to be raided in five minutes. A detective
there gave me the office," and he related everything which had
happened.</p>

<p>"You'll see the account of the raid in Monday's papers," he
added, "with the names of everybody there, set out in full, and
we'll be deuced thankful ours are not among them."</p>

<p>"But what the devil made the detective tell you?" asked
Hardacre, aghast. "How is it he knew you?"</p>

<p>"Why, he was at Scotland Yard when I was there!" replied
Larose, and then, seeing the bewilderment in Hardacre's face, he
exclaimed with a beaming smile: "What, didn't you know I was in
the Criminal Investigation Department before I married? Great
Scot, I was certain someone would have told you at the
club!"</p>

<p>"But they hadn't," said Hardacre slowly, with a most
unpleasant feeling in the pit of his stomach. "I thought Carmel
Abbey had always belonged to you."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," laughed Larose, "and it isn't mine now. It
all belongs to my wife." He called down the speaking tube for
the driver to stop. "Here, let's walk the rest of the way," he
went on to Hardacre, "and in a few minutes you shall hear
something very funny."</p>

<p>Hardacre got out of the taxi as meek as a lamb. He was too
stupefied as yet with the disclosure Larose had made to him to
think coherently. For a few minutes they walked on without
speaking, and then Larose said briskly: "Here's a telephone box
and I'll ring up the place for a joke to see what's happened.
It's twenty-five past eleven now and raids like that are always
punctual. So everything will be all over. What's the number of
that place?"</p>

<p>Hardacre gave it with a scowl and the manager's name, too.
Larose put his pennies in the slot and in a few seconds got
through. A gruff voice asked: "Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Is that the White Swan Club?" asked Larose in a high-pitched
tone of voice. "Well, I want to speak to Mr. Pelham, the
manager."</p>

<p>"You can't," was the reply, "he's engaged."</p>

<p>"Well, put me on to the secretary," said Larose.</p>

<p>"He's engaged, too."</p>

<p>Larose handed the telephone to Hardacre, who was in the box
with him and the latter demanded: "Put me on to one of the staff
at once. Quick now!"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" came the voice. "Give me your name."</p>

<p>"Damn you," swore Hardacre savagely. "I'm the Archbishop of
Canterbury and you can go to hell," and he hung up the receiver
with a jerk. "You were told the truth all right," he nodded to
Larose, "for if ever I've heard a damn policeman speaking, that
was one. He had got big feet all over his voice."</p>

<p>That night, before either of them had dropped off to sleep,
both Larose and Hardacre were disturbed with uneasy thoughts.
Larose was worried because he had unwittingly told Hardacre of
his one-time association with the C.I.D., which otherwise the
latter might never have come to learn, and Hardacre, because,
with the several criminal secrets he had now to hide, he did not
much relish a close association with a man whose one-time
calling it had been to deal with crime. Still, in the end
Hardacre comforted himself with the thought that Larose had
nothing to do with Scotland Yard now, and even when there might
not have been much of a detective. The man, he told himself, was
an easy-going, pleasure-loving fellow, and would certainly never
put himself to any trouble he could avoid. The very fact that
now, married to a wealthy woman, he was content to live an idle
life proved it without doubt.</p>

<p>The following Monday afternoon, however, Hardacre got
something of a shock when making what he thought were discreet
inquiries about Larose from another member of the Norwich Club.
The latter was most enthusiastic about him and his triumphs in
bygone days.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he was a star performer, right enough," he told
Hardacre, "and, they say, about the finest detective Scotland
Yard ever had. He could pick up clues where no one else could,
and it was a sort of tradition among his brother sleuths that,
when a murder had been committed somewhere, if he was taken to
the place he could see the very shadow which the murderer had
left upon the wall."</p>

<p>"Rot!" exclaimed Hardacre, his mouth going dry.</p>

<p>"Of course, it was," laughed the other, "but the idea only
shows what a lot he was thought of." He nodded. "Yes, and it's
well-known, too, he's often consulted, even now, by the Heads of
the C.I.D. on very special cases." He lowered his voice
mysteriously. "I wonder he's not been nosing into the murder of
Dr. Monk. I know he had a slight acquaintance with the
doctor."</p>

<p>Hardacre felt more than ordinarily uneasy and made up his
mind that, in future, he would have as little as possible to do
with Larose. The latter at once sensed this strained feeling
and, though putting it down to the right cause, was confident he
would speedily be able to restore things to the old friendly
footing. So, he was just as affable and friendly as ever, and
one day invited Hardacre to Carmel Abbey to dine. He seemed
genuinely disappointed when Hardacre declined on the plea that
he was not feeling quite up to the mark with a slight attack of
sciatica.</p>

<p>A fortnight passing, with Hardacre continuing to be distant
and unapproachable, Larose determined on a bold move. Somehow,
by hook or by crook, he must get into the Manor and have a look
round. In particular he wanted to find out if Hardacre had a
small .22 rifle, a rifle such as that which had fired the bullet
with which Dr. Monk had been killed. He quite expected, however,
it would be hidden away somewhere and not to be laid hands upon
at first sight. Also, he wanted to learn if Hardacre were still
taking those tablets. If there were a chemist's label upon the
bottles, then in that way he might be able to trace back the
doctor who had given the prescription. He was still inclined to
think it would prove to be Dr. Monk.</p>

<p>He considered everything most carefully and thought his
chances of getting into the house unobserved by no means bad. He
could be fairly certain Hardacre would not be found at home any
afternoon after three o'clock, and he felt pretty confident the
outer hall door would be propped open and the inner glass one
unlocked. Then, with the house being a large one, with the
servants' regions all at the back, he did not think the maids
were likely to trouble him. He knew there were only two of them,
and he reckoned that by about four o'clock in the afternoon they
would have finished all the housework, and be sitting down in
their own quarters.</p>

<p>Directly he had made up his mind, he proceeded to put his
plan into operation that very day, and was at once of opinion
that fortune was favouring him when, coming in sight of the
entrance to the drive leading up to the Manor, he saw a woman
with a shopping bag in her hand come out into the road and
proceed to walk quickly in the direction of the village. "Good,"
he told himself, "then there'll be only one of them about the
house! The better chance of getting in unobserved."</p>

<p>He parked his car in the bend of the drive, just out of view
of the house. As he had expected, he found the outer hall door
propped wide open and the inner one unlocked. Tiptoeing quietly
into the house, he heard someone singing in the direction of
where he guessed the kitchen was, and so knew that for the
moment, at all events, he would be quite safe and not likely to
be interrupted.</p>

<p>He went straight into the study where they had had their
cards on the evening of the party, for he had noticed a safe
there and was wondering if its lock would be easy to pick. He
bent down and examined it carefully, but not a single minute had
gone by before, to his consternation, he heard the singing which
had been going on all the time, coming nearer. He had purposely
left the door of the room ajar and there could be no doubt the
singer was approaching the lounge hall.</p>

<p>He looked round. There was no possible place where he could
conceal himself, and so, in case the singer should be coming
where he was, he threw himself down into an arm-chair and
assumed the smiling and confident air of a man who had every
right to be where he was.</p>

<p>The singing came nearer and nearer, the door was pushed wider
open and the elder of the two maids who had waited upon them
when he had dined there, entered the room with two highly
polished candlesticks in her hands. Her jaw dropped and her eyes
opened wide in startled surprise as she caught sight of
Larose.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he said smilingly, "I'm just waiting for
your master. I couldn't get any answer to my ring, so I walked
in." He nodded. "You remember me, don't you? I was dining here a
little while ago."</p>

<p>The woman's face flushed in her relief. "Oh, yes, sir," she
exclaimed, "but you did give me a start!" She shook her head.
"But Master's out and I don't suppose he'll be home until his
usual time, about half-past seven."</p>

<p>"All right, then," said Larose, rising to his feet. "I
suppose I'll catch him at his club. If I don't happen to meet
him there, just tell him, will you, please, that I called. I'm
Mr. Larose."</p>

<p>The woman was now all smiles. "Oh, I know who you are, sir,"
she said. "I've often heard of you. You were a London detective
once, weren't you?" and when Larose nodded, she went on
nervously: "Well, I wonder, sir, if I might ask you a
question?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, a hundred if you like!" replied Larose. "But what
is it you want to know?"</p>

<p>The woman hesitated. "Er&mdash;er&mdash;but I don't know
whether I ought to ask you, sir. Master mightn't like it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I needn't tell him," laughed Larose. "I've kept
thousands of secrets in my time and never told them to a soul.
So you can trust me not to tell yours, now."</p>

<p>The woman still hesitated. "But you're a great friend of
Master's, aren't you, sir?" she stammered, and again, as once
before with the postmistress of Great Bromley, Larose sensed a
certain feeling of hostility in the question.</p>

<p>"No, no," he replied quickly, "I'm not a great friend of your
master. We're just acquaintances. I've only known him a few
weeks." He laughed lightly. "We detectives must know a man much
longer than that before we call him a friend, let alone a great
friend." He spoke confidingly. "Now what is it you want to ask
me? I promise you it shan't get back to Mr. Hatherleigh."</p>

<p>The woman seemed quite assured. "Well, sir, it's like this,"
she began quickly. "My sister, that's the other girl who works
here, and me are very worried about a young fellow who used to
be here and we got very fond of. He was becoming very ill and
Master took him away suddenly. He promised to write, but we've
never had a line from him, and we feel certain that there's
something strange," and then the whole story of Harold Smith's
coming to the Manor was unfolded to Larose's interested
ears.</p>

<p>She related how the boy had been taken on as the
gardener-chauffeur when he had been obviously not fit enough to do
the work, how his health and dreadful cough had got gradually worse,
with her master all the time refusing to call in a doctor to
find out what was really the matter with him, how she herself,
making out Harold had had a fainting fit, had rung up the doctor
one afternoon when Hardacre was away and then, how barely
thirty-six hours later Harold had been whisked away in the very
early morning, so confused with some medicine that he had been
given that he had left behind his watch, as well as his Post
Office Savings Bank book which showed a credit of £31.</p>

<p>"But he has never written for the book, sir," she went on,
"and though all these weeks have passed, not a word has come
from him. And that is not like Harold, as he is a nice-natured
boy, and I am sure he was grateful for what my sister and I did
for him." She nodded emphatically. "No, something has happened
to him and we are anxious to find out what it is."</p>

<p>Listening intently to her story, Larose had formed a good
opinion of her. She was kind and motherly and would, he was
sure, be staunch to those for whom she had any affection.</p>

<p>"But what is it you want to ask me?" he said when she had
finished speaking. "How can I help you in any way?"</p>

<p>"By telling us how we can find out about him," she replied.
"How we can start doing it." She burst out impulsively: "To be
honest with you, sir, we are sure Master did not tell us the
truth. We don't believe the boy ever went back to Birmingham as
Master says, for his stepsister had been very unkind to him and
practically turned him out of the house."</p>

<p>Larose looked puzzled. "But what reason could Mr. Hatherleigh
have had," he asked, "for not wanting you to know where the boy
had gone?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir," replied Jane unhappily. She lowered her
voice to a whisper. "But I do know there was some secret between
them and that Harold had known the master before he came here
that morning about the situation. They had met before."</p>

<p>Larose started. Great Scot, then here was coming information
from a source he had never expected! Just by chance, as it were,
he might now learn what with all his trouble he had hitherto
failed to find out&mdash;who had Clement Hatherleigh been before
Charles Holt and Clive Hall!</p>

<p>Masking his intense interest with a smile he asked lightly:
"Then where had they met?"</p>

<p>"I am almost sure it must have been in China, sir," replied
Jane, "at a place called Hoichow, because Harold had been living
there for seven years and he had only been back in England about
three weeks before he came to see Master that morning."</p>

<p>"But didn't he tell you definitely?" asked Larose with a
frown.</p>

<p>"No, sir, and he was very frightened when I asked him. It was
like this. Only a little while after he had come here&mdash;it
couldn't have been much more than a week&mdash;I was passing the
garage where he and Master were, and through the open window I
heard Master ask him if he was sure he'd kept his promise about
something and not breathed a word about it to us, and Harold
said he hadn't. Later in the day, I told him in fun what I'd
heard them saying and he was so terrified Master would know I
had been listening that I was sure it must have been about
something very serious. He said he'd like to tell me but he
daren't, and if Master ever knew I'd overheard he would be
furious and perhaps send him away at once."</p>

<p>Larose looked very grave. "Then it does almost seem as if Mr.
Hatherleigh is deliberately keeping from you where Harold has
gone. But can't you write to this stepsister of his? Don't you
know where she lives?"</p>

<p>"In Birmingham, sir, but I don't know the address or even her
name. I asked Master about it when he came back, so that I could
write to Harold&mdash;I didn't mention anything about the
Savings Bank book or the watch&mdash;but he said he didn't know
either."</p>

<p>Larose considered. "Then I don't see what you can do," he
said. He frowned. "The whole thing seems very strange to
me."</p>

<p>"And so it seems to us, sir," nodded the girl. "Everything is
so mysterious. On that Monday morning Master had made no
arrangements, as the doctor had ordered, for Harold to go to
some hospital and then, on the afternoon of that same day when
he had come back from a garden party, he went straight in to
Harold and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From a garden party," exclaimed Larose, his eyes opening
wide, "from Mrs. Fraser's in Norwich?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," was the reply, "that was where he had been. When
the Norwich paper came at the end of the week we saw his name
among those present and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Larose was no longer listening. It was as if a mighty
thunderclap had burst in his ears and, for the moment,
completely stunned him.</p>

<p>God, that garden party again! Another trail starting from
there! Then he had been right after all and it was there the
doctor had been marked down for death! But what about this boy
and how had he come to be dragged into the ghastly business?</p>

<p>He turned back to the girl and interrupted what she was
saying. "Now listen," he said sharply. "There's something rather
frightening about this business and it must be seen into. I
don't like the look of it, at all. But first, what's your name?
Oh, Jane Nicolls!" He smiled. "Now, Jane, you're prepared to
trust me, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir," exclaimed the girl, "I'd trust you in
anything. That's why I spoke to you now, I'm not a person who
takes to everyone. Besides, I had an uncle in the City
Police&mdash;he's dead now or I might have gone to him&mdash;and
he always said what a good, straight man you were."</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "Well, if you can trust me"&mdash;his face
became very grave and very stern&mdash;"can I trust you? I mean,
can you hold your tongue?"</p>

<p>Jane looked hurt. "Oh, yes, sir! I promise not to say a word.
I won't even tell my sister if you don't want me to."</p>

<p>"Good!" nodded Larose. "Then tell me, do you like your
master?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I don't think anyone he employs would
like him, sir. We don't <i>dis</i>like him, for he doesn't
bother us much and he pays well. But he's never friendly and
never says a word more to us than he can help, not even good
morning or good night. He just ignores us and we've never seen
him smile unless he's had visitors here."</p>

<p>"Was he kind to this sick boy?"</p>

<p>Jane hesitated. "We were puzzled there, sir. He was kind in
taking him on here when everyone could have seen he was not
strong enough to do the work, and he was kind in talking to him
far more than he did to us. But he wasn't kind in refusing to
let him see a doctor, and we've often had the horrid thought
that he was doing it on purpose, so that Harold might die."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he was," nodded Larose&mdash;he eyed the girl
intently&mdash;"if Harold knew some secret about him which he
didn't want to come out."</p>

<p>"Oh, how awful, sir, it seems even to think of!" exclaimed
Jane tremulously. "But where could he have taken him to, do you
think?"</p>

<p>"Haven't the remotest idea," replied Larose, "but that's what
we've got to find out. Now about that morning when Harold went
away. Did he seem in a fit enough condition to make the long
journey to London, to where Mr. Hatherleigh said he was taking
him?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, he didn't. He looked downright ill, and Master had
to give him a big drink of brandy before I helped him into the
car. I think, too, Master put something else in the brandy to
brace him up, as he was stirring it round with a spoon as he
brought it in."</p>

<p>"And the left before six," frowned Larose, "a ghastly hour
for an invalid to begin a long journey."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, at a quarter to."</p>

<p>"And when did your master come back?"</p>

<p>"Not until the Saturday evening, sir."</p>

<p>"And you know he had actually been to London?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, as the trunk call came from there the next
afternoon," replied Jane. "He rang us up then to say Harold had
gone on to Birmingham. Yes, he went to London right enough." She
seemed to remember something and went on thoughtfully: "But he'd
been somewhere else, besides London, somewhere by the sea. We
knew that because of the sand in his clothes."</p>

<p>Larose frowned again. "Oh, sand in his clothes!" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, in the turn-ups of his trousers and in his jacket
pockets, even more sand than we usually find in them when he's
been away duck shooting."</p>

<p>"Ah," exclaimed Larose. "I want to ask you about that
shooting in a minute, but first, let's see if there's anything
among Mr. Hatherleigh's letters or papers which will help us to
find out where he took that boy. What about that desk
there?"</p>

<p>"It's always left open, sir, and I don't think you'll find
anything except receipts and bills. Everything important is
always kept locked up in that big safe, which is the only thing
locked in the house."</p>

<p>And a brief search round everywhere soon made it quite clear
that Jane was right. After a few moments of hesitating, upon his
request, she took Larose up to her master's bedroom, too, and he
went quickly through the cupboards there, but nothing of
interest was found.</p>

<p>Pointing to a bottle on the mantelshelf labelled "Sleeping
Tablets. Poison", the girl said nervously: "Those are what
Master gave Harold the night before he went away to make him
sleep. I saw him with the bottle in his hand." She looked rather
scared. "I wonder if it was some more of them he was stirring in
that glass of brandy he gave him the next morning!"</p>

<p>"If so," commented Larose very gravely, "then it could only
have meant&mdash;&mdash;" but he checked himself sharply and
after a moment went on: "Well, that's what we'll find out some
day." He turned the conversation. "Now about your master going
shooting. Where does he keep the guns?"</p>

<p>She led him to a small room at the back of the house and
Larose's heart beat a little quicker. Was he to find there the
little .22 rifle with which Dr. Monk had been shot?</p>

<p>The room was very small, little bigger than a large cupboard.
Two gun-cases were upon a table and, in one corner, a rifle was
leaning up against the wall. One glance at the rifle, however,
was sufficient. It took a .303 cartridge and not a .22.</p>

<p>"But is that the only rifle he's got?" he asked in great
disappointment. "Didn't he ever have a shot at the rooks in
those trees?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, we've had rook pie several times."</p>

<p>"Well, what did he shoot them with?" snapped Larose. "Surely
not with a gun! The noise of one shot with a gun would have
driven them all away!"</p>

<p>"Then he didn't use a gun, sir," said the girl. "We watched
him shooting once, and saw the young rooks come down one by
one."</p>

<p>"Well, has he got another rifle, smaller than this one?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "I don't know, sir. I never used to
come in here. It was Harold who used to clean the guns, and the
other gardener before him. I know nothing about guns or
shooting."</p>

<p>Opening a small cupboard over the table, Larose found a
number of boxes of cartridges there, and his eyes gleamed when,
among them, he saw one half full of those for a .22 rifle. "See,
these are the cartridges for the rifle I want to find," he said,
"and it must be somewhere about. Now where can he have put
it."</p>

<p>But the girl could not help him in any way and a search
through the sheds and outhouses gave no result.</p>

<p>"Now, one thing more," said Larose. "Where does your master
go when he's out shooting?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir. He never tells us. It's only by chance we
learn anything he does. He purposely keeps us in the dark about
everything. For instance, the other morning he came into the
kitchen and told us two guests were coming to dinner that night,
and he made a great fuss about what they were to have. From the
preparation we had to make we thought they would be very
important people, but when they arrived they were only the
Rector and Miss Bannister."</p>

<p>Larose smiled. "Well, isn't Miss Bannister good-looking
enough to be an important person anywhere?"</p>

<p>Jane smiled back. "Yes, sir, she is." She nodded vigorously.
"I think, by the way he looks at her, Master would like to make
her the mistress here, but I don't believe he'll ever get her.
She's much too sensible a girl to fall in love with him, though
I shouldn't wonder if Mr. Bannister would be pleased about it."
She dropped her voice to a whisper. "He's been here several
times lately and we rather believe Master's been lending him
money, as my sister Ellen, she's the cook here, heard him thank
Master for something the other day as they were passing the
kitchen window, and say it wouldn't be for long. It might have
been for money, as Mr. Bannister is known to be extravagant and
he's not well off."</p>

<p>Larose scowled angrily to himself. It was unthinkable so
lovely a girl as Dorothy should be the wife of the dreadful man
he knew the so-called Clement Hatherleigh to be.</p>

<p>He spoke very solemnly. "Now, Jane, we are partners in
finding out what has become of this boy, and must trust each
other implicitly. You understand, don't you, perfect trust
between us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir," she replied earnestly, "and you can trust my
sister, too. She's as fond of the boy as I am, and we'll neither
of us breathe a word about you."</p>

<p>"All right then," said Larose. "Now I'm going up to London
to-morrow and I may be able to learn something at the hotel
where your master always stays. I'll either ring you up or come
and see you again. By the by, what was the boy like?"</p>

<p>"He's quite short, sir, and rather slim. He's clean-shaven
and very fair, with his hair almost of a silver colour. He wears
it rather long. He's got blue eyes and a lovely set of
teeth."</p>

<p>Larose drove off, fairly pleased with his interview with
Jane, but, thinking of the boy, his face darkened. "Some devilry
there," he told himself, "and, knowing what I do about this
brute, if he had reason for wanting to get rid of
him&mdash;then&mdash;good God, anything may have happened!"</p>

<p>The following day Larose went up to Town and, calling upon
Inspector Stone, asked him to send a plain-clothes man to
inspect the register at the Hotel Splendide, and find out if
one, Clement Hatherleigh, had been staying there from Tuesday,
August the fifteenth to the following Saturday morning, and as
much more about him as he was able without letting the hotel
people know he, Hatherleigh, was the particular party being
inquired about.</p>

<p>"No, I can't tell you anything yet, Charlie," he added, "and
please don't try to find out. I promise you, however, that you
shall soon have those big paws of yours upon this gentleman,
upon one charge or another."</p>

<p>"Dear me, dear me!" tut-tutted the Inspector in mock
surprise. "Then is he as versatile as all that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," laughed Larose, "a receiver of stolen goods,
with, perhaps, two or three homicides as a side-line."</p>

<p>"All right, my boy," nodded the Inspector, "I'll send a good
man round to the Splendide and you shall have his report this
afternoon at your hotel."</p>

<p>At four o'clock Larose was perusing the report. As far as it
went, it was thorough and included both an inspection of the
hotel register and the day-book of the hotel garage. Hatherleigh
had not arrived upon the Tuesday, but had booked in at 1.45 a.m.
on the Wednesday morning and had been received by the night
porter. He had remained at the hotel until the Saturday morning,
taking his car away at twelve-ten. He had not used his car at
all during the week and nothing, apparently, had been done to
it, as he had only paid garaging charges.</p>

<p>For a long while Larose considered the report. What did it
mean, Hatherleigh leaving the Manor before six on that Tuesday
morning and not arriving at his hotel until nearly twenty hours
afterwards? What had he been doing all that time and where could
he have taken the boy? What connection had there been between
Hatherleigh's having been to that garden party and his sudden
resolution, so quickly put into effect, to get the boy away from
the Manor without an hour's unnecessary delay?</p>

<p>Of course the boy had known something of Hatherleigh's past
life and what he had known must have been of a disgraceful
nature, or Hatherleigh would not have considered it so vital a
matter that it must not come out!</p>

<p>But how did that concern Dr. Monk? How did anything to do
with Hatherleigh concern the doctor?</p>

<p>Larose scowled disgustedly. Oh, if only he could see how it
was possible for Hatherleigh to have consulted Dr. Monk just
previous to his going down to Burnham! Seemingly, however, that
was impossible as Hatherleigh had told them at the inn he had
only just a few days previously, arrived from abroad and the
condition of his two big leather trunks went to prove that. The
innkeeper's wife had said they smelt horribly musty, which would
be explained by their having been for some weeks deep down among
the not wanted baggage on board a ship.</p>

<p>But Hatherleigh had arrived at Burnham on that Saturday,
September the fifteenth, a fortnight before Dr. Monk had
returned from abroad and gone up again to his consulting room.
Thus, with Hatherleigh at Burnham the whole time and never once
having been long enough away from the inn to have got up to
Town, it was quite impossible he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah, wait a moment! There was something wrong there! The
innkeeper said he distinctly remembered September the fifteenth
being a Saturday, but how could that be as he, Larose,
remembered seeing quite as distinctly in the case-book that,
when the doctor had returned to his practice on October the
first, the day he had been seeing patients had been a Wednesday.
If October the first had been on a Wednesday, then September
fifteenth would have been on a Monday.</p>

<p>Larose was in the lounge of his hotel as he was reading the
plain-clothes man's report and, very puzzled, he walked over to
the reception clerk at the desk.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me, please," he asked, "upon what day of the
week September the fifteenth the year before last was? Was it on
a Saturday?"</p>

<p>The clerk turned back the pages of the big hotel register and
after about half a minute replied: "No, sir, the fifteenth of
September was on a Monday."</p>

<p>Larose snapped his fingers exultingly, and at once put
through a phone call to the Pilot Inn in Burnham. The wife of
the innkeeper answered it.</p>

<p>"It is I who was inquiring the other day about that Mr. Hall
who was staying with you two years ago," he said. "Well, your
husband told me he first arrived on his birthday and it
was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, sir, not <i>his</i> birthday," interrupted the woman,
"it was on <i>mine,</i> on October the third. Yes, sir, he made
a mistake when he told you it was <i>his</i> birthday on
September the fifteenth. He remembered it, afterwards. Oh, I'm
quite sure about it, because we remarked to each other what a
nice birthday present for me it was to have a gent coming for
the winter. My husband said I could go into Chelmsford and buy a
new dress because of it."</p>

<p>Larose hung up the receiver with a scowl. "And all that
trouble because the man was such a fool!" he muttered. His face
broke into an exultant smile. "But now for those case-books once
again."</p>

<p>He lost no time in ringing up the bungalow in Hickling Broad,
intending to ask Miss Monk to be sure to mail the particular
case-book he wanted, that night. He learnt, however, from a
woman left in charge there that only two days previously Miss
Monk had removed for the winter to her Hampstead house. He at
once got in touch with Miss Monk who, to his great joy, told him
she had brought the case-books to Town with her. As quickly as a
taxi would take him he was at her house. She was busy
entertaining some friends, but the book he wanted was put into
his hands immediately.</p>

<p>Then he got what he always considered one of the minor shocks
of his life for, recognizing Clement Hatherleigh at once in the
Charles Henson who had consulted the doctor on the first and
third days of October&mdash;he read that he was a leper.</p>

<p>Everything was set down in detail; Charles Henson's address,
his age, the symptoms of his malady, the finding of the culture,
and the treatment which had been prescribed for him. In a
foot-note had been added, later, that the patient had taken himself
off from the coffee palace before the Health Authorities had
been able to get in touch with him and, accordingly, the order
for segregation had never been put in force.</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed the horrified Larose, "and he is
courting Dorothy Bannister! What a vile beast! That's worse than
any murder!" He whistled. "But was the diagnosis correct? How
can a man, two years after he's been certified as a leper, be
going about as Hatherleigh is and leading the life of one,
apparently, in the best of health?" He could hardly get his
breath in his excitement. "But how clear-cut his motive for
murdering the doctor now stands out. Dr. Monk thought he
recognized him at the garden party, but could not be quite
certain, and so, having made inquiries about him, went to that
church on the Sunday morning to have another look. The devil saw
him and realized the game was up unless he could prevent the
doctor speaking. So he didn't lose an hour, but shot him that
same night."</p>

<p>He made a grimace. "But what proof have I, what proof that
will satisfy a jury when he is on trial for his life? He may
deny that he recognized the doctor at the garden party and had
no thought that he was in danger of being found out. He may say,
too, that he had no grudge at all against the doctor, and only
feelings of gratitude towards him because the treatment he had
prescribed had been so effective."</p>

<p>Larose shrugged his shoulders. "No, no, Gilbert, your case is
not complete yet. You've got to be quite certain he will not be
able to escape, before you pull in the net. Patience, my lad,
and you'll get him in the end."</p>

<p>Taking a last look at the entry to impress everything upon
his mind, his eyes suddenly fell upon a rather faint pencilled
word against the entry and with some difficulty he made out the
word to be "Gerald", with a note of interrogation after it.</p>

<p>What the devil did that mean, he asked himself. Who was
Gerald? It meant something and he must find out, anyhow.</p>

<p>Just at that moment he heard Miss Monk bidding her goodbyes
to her friends and, almost immediately, she came into the room.
With some exultation he told her what he had discovered and how
hot the trail was getting now. Then he asked if she knew who
Gerald was and delight was heaped upon delight when she told him
he was her cousin, working at the Foreign Office and living with
his father, Sir Geoffrey Burton, in Chelsea.</p>

<p>Young Burton was soon being interviewed but, upon being shown
his name in the case-book against the entry of Charles Henson,
could not explain it in any way.</p>

<p>"But this Henson," persisted Larose, "is a tall, good-looking
man about forty, rather distinguished in an unpleasant masterful
sort of way, not the kind of man you would forget if you'd met
him a few times."</p>

<p>Burton shook his head. "But I can't recall to my mind having
had anything to do with such a party. Certainly, I remember
calling upon my uncle about that time as I had just then
returned from Hoichow in China and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hoichow!" exclaimed Larose in some excitement. "Then did you
ever know a young fellow called Harold Smith there? He was a
steward at some club."</p>

<p>"There was certainly a steward in my club called Harold,"
said Burton slowly, "but I don't remember if his surname was
Smith."</p>

<p>"A very fair boy," said Larose, "with his hair of a silver
shade."</p>

<p>"That was the chap," nodded Burton, "a nice-looking boy."</p>

<p>"Then it's almost certain," said Larose, "that you knew this
patient who came to your uncle as Charles Henson, as well.
<i>He</i> knew this boy Harold, and so was most likely a member
of your club." He pressed home his questions. "Can't you
remember this big, dark man who was probably always smoking
cigarettes which he took from a big, fat, silver cigarette-case,
marked with the initials C.H.?"</p>

<p>A light seemed to break on Burton's face. "Oh, yes, I know
whom you mean," he exclaimed, "but if I was right the man's name
was not Henson! He was a Chester Hardacre and had had the
biggest store in Hoichow." He frowned. "He was a bad egg this
Hardacre and killed another member of the club. We had to get
him smuggled out of jail and right away from the island to save
the scandal of a white man being put on trial for murder." He
snapped his fingers together exultingly. "Oh, and I understand
now why my uncle put my name against his record in that book! I
thought I recognized him on my uncle's door-step and told Uncle
so," and he proceeded to relate the whole story of everything
that had happened in Hoichow.</p>

<p>Larose was thrilled at the recital, but his delight was
somewhat damped when the young man finished up by stating that
though he was fairly confident he had recognized Hardacre that
morning, yet he could not be absolutely certain.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "I got such a fleeting glimpse of the man
as I was on the door-step, and he had got his cap well pulled
down over his eyes. Though for the moment I was quite confident,
thinking it all over afterwards, I was not nearly so
certain."</p>

<p>Larose's sleep was very broken that night, for, always most
painstaking in all his investigations, he was thinking out how
to make the case against this so-called Hatherleigh as
convincing as possible.</p>

<p>The next morning, provided with an introduction, he called
upon another specialist in tropical diseases, a Professor
Andrews, in Portland Place. The professor was quite as eminent
as Dr. Monk had been, though a much younger man in the early
forties.</p>

<p>"Now, Professor," he said, "I want to ask you something very
important. Is it possible for a man who just over two years ago
was certified as suffering from leprosy to be now in perfect
health and with not a mark of the dreadful disease upon
him?"</p>

<p>The professor considered. "You mean that two years ago this
man was certified by a responsible physician as being infected
with leprosy, and now has been given a clean bill of health by
that same physician?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't say that," said Larose quickly, "for, as far as
I know, this man I have in mind has paid no second visit to any
physician. But I meet him often, he appears to be in the very
pink of condition and, when I have seen him in the swimming-pool,
his body appears to be perfectly all right."</p>

<p>The professor considered again. "It is not very probable, but
it <i>is</i> possible, as there are authentic cases of the
disease having cleared itself up, almost, so to speak,
spontaneously. You must realize that, contrary to popular
belief, leprosy is very rarely a fatal disease and, with proper
treatment, can be held in abeyance for many, many years, until
it has worked itself out, and the patient ultimately dies from
something else."</p>

<p>"Then this particular man I am referring to," said Larose,
"may be quite all right now, and if he were examined to-day no
one would be able to prove he had ever been infected at
all!"</p>

<p>The professor smiled. "In giving you an answer there I should
first want to know if it were certain he had ever been infected.
A mistaken diagnosis might quite easily have been made, for
sometimes the leprae bacilli are very hard to detect with
absolute certainty. Was it a specialist this man went to?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "And as this doctor is dead there can be no
harm in saying who he was. He was the late Dr. Monk."</p>

<p>"A very clever man," nodded the professor&mdash;he shrugged
his shoulders&mdash;"but with his limitations, in fact, between
ourselves, we did not consider him a great authority on leprosy.
His strong suits were malaria and elephantiasis. There he had
done excellent work and fully deserved the reputation he had
got. A bit impetuous, though, as he grew older, and most
intolerant of anyone else's opinion. In fact he was a very
obstinate man. By the by, was this patient under his observation
for some time?"</p>

<p>"No, only three days," replied Larose. "He went to him one
day, and then two days later when the culture had been
made."</p>

<p>"Too quick, too quick," frowned the professor. "I know Dr.
Monk had his own special ways, but <i>I</i> cannot ever obtain a
definite culture of the bacilli under five days." He smiled.
"No, Mr. Larose, if, as you tell me, this patient is in perfect
health and without blemish to-day, then, speaking off-hand, I
should say he had never had true leprosy."</p>

<p>Bidding good-bye to the professor, Larose was certainly
rather upset with the information he had just received, for, if
Hardacre were now quite leprosy free, he might easily deny he
had ever consulted Dr. Monk, and that he had might be impossible
to prove. In that event, no reason could be put forward why he
should have had any animus against the doctor and wished him
harm. The whole case then might seem to fall through.</p>

<p>Still, Larose comforted himself with the thought that he had
yet other cards to play and, driving back post-haste towards
Norfolk, he summed up everything as it now stood.</p>

<p>There were two persons whose disclosures would have done
Hardacre incalculable harm. If one of them, indeed, could have
disclosed he was wanted for segregation because of a dreadful
malady, both of them could have broadcast the story that he was
wanted by the Hoichow authorities for having killed a man. One
of them might actually have been an eye-witness of the killing
and, at any rate, could have given chapter and verse in
detail.</p>

<p>Well, this danger to him had passed, for both of these men
were dead. One was known to have been brutally murdered, and the
other had disappeared in so mysterious and sinister a fashion
that there could be little doubt he had met the same fate. The
proof there, however, for the moment was lacking.</p>

<p>Now what exactly had happened that day when Hardacre had
driven off so early with Harold Smith? They had left St.
Michael's Manor together before six o'clock in the morning and
Hardacre had booked into his hotel in Town&mdash;alone&mdash;at
one-forty-five the next morning, and there was something very
sinister about the timing of this journey. On the very face of
it, in its furtiveness and secrecy it suggested criminal intent,
and as if Hardacre had been arranging his hours of travel so
that his car should not be seen when many people were upon the
roads.</p>

<p>Then if that supposition were correct, while he had had
nearly four hours of darkness to cover his journey to London, at
night&mdash;in the early morning he had had only a bare one hour
to get off the roads before the usual daily traffic would begin
to appear. Then, in that case, his journey in the early morning
had been a very short one, probably less than a score of miles
or so from the Manor, and it had almost certainly been to
somewhere on the sea-shore, because of the sand that had been
found later in his clothes.</p>

<p>Good, then he, Larose, would go and have another talk with
that parlour-maid! She might be able to tell him now!</p>

<p>Ringing up from a call-office in Norwich, Jane told him her
master was away for the day and that the coast was quite clear.
Accordingly, in less than half an hour Larose was at the
Manor.</p>

<p>Alarming her as little as he could, he nevertheless told the
maid that he did not at all like the look of things and believed
her master, for some purpose of his own, had got Harold hidden
away somewhere in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"Now about those wild duck which you told me your master shot
last winter," he said, "where did he go to get them? You have no
idea! Well, has he got a bungalow anywhere on the coast?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether it's a bungalow, sir," said Jane, "but
he's got some place where he goes to. It isn't furnished,
because, besides his food, he used always to take a lot of
things with him every time, plates, a knife and fork, a tumbler,
and, of course, his bedding. He always had four blankets and two
pillows with him."</p>

<p>"Did he sleep in his car?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so, sir, because when he brought the blankets
home I always had to shake a lot of sand out of them. We should
have thought he slept on the sands somewhere, except that he
never took a ground-sheet to put under him."</p>

<p>"How long was he away at a time?"</p>

<p>"Never more than one night, sir. He would go one afternoon
and be back the next."</p>

<p>"And how often used he to go away?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I should think about six or seven times last winter,
sir. It's many months since he's been now."</p>

<p>"Did he ever bring home any fish?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, and never very many birds. About a dozen duck were
the most he's ever brought home, and two wild geese. They were
all kept in the refrigerator and he'd have them at every meal
until they were gone."</p>

<p>"I suppose he doesn't keep any record of what birds he's
shot?" asked Larose. "So many shooters do, and they put down
where they've shot them, too. You haven't seen a little
memorandum book lying about anywhere? You see, it's in my mind
he may have got a small shooting box on the coast and, perhaps,
as I say, have taken Harold there. No&mdash;well, let's go and
have another look in that little room where he keeps those
guns."</p>

<p>But, going over everything again, he could get no pointer in
any direction until he came across a small bottle of lubricating
oil for the guns. It bore the label of a well-known London firm
of gunsmiths, but upon it had been superimposed with a rubber
stamp, "Cooper, Ironmonger, Wells." He took heart at once, for
Wells was a small town right up in the north of Norfolk and very
near to the sea-shore and long stretches of lonely salt
marshes.</p>

<p>"Buying this oil at Wells should surely mean," he told
himself, "that he does his shooting somewhere near there, and
those marshes between Waybourne and Wells are about the best
places for duck and Solan geese in Norfolk. So, if this
ironmonger doesn't know him, someone else may."</p>

<p>The next morning he started his inquiries at the ironmonger's
in the little town of Wells. He was afraid to mention
Hatherleigh's name in case it should get back to him that
someone had been asking about him. So, instead, he said to the
ironmonger that he understood a Mr. Browning, a tall dark
gentleman, had got a small shooting bungalow to let close near,
and he wanted to find out where it was. He had come to him, the
ironmonger, because he knew for certain this gentleman had once
bought some gun oil at his shop, and he was hoping that perhaps
he could recall him. The ironmonger, however, after a lot of
thinking, shook his head and said he could not remember any
tall, very dark man, who came shooting in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, Larose proceeded nearer the marshes and
inquired at Blakeney. There he met with the same result, but at
Cley-next-the-Sea, to his great delight, he heard of such a man
who was renting a big disused fishing shed on a spot of land on
the seaward side of Cley channel.</p>

<p>"You can't mistake it, sir," said the man of whom he had
inquired. "When you get out of the village, turn to the left
along a narrow track you'll find leading down to the sea. It's
about a mile away and between the two last sandhills. You won't
see it until you get right up to it." Then he added dubiously:
"But the gent who rents it is not called Browning. He's a Mr.
Hatherleigh and comes from St. Michael's."</p>

<p>"Not an old man about sixty?" queried Larose, as if very
disappointed, but with his heart really jumping with joy.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir, not a day above forty," replied the man, "but
he's tall and dark."</p>

<p>"Then he's not the gentleman I want," smiled Larose. "Mr.
Browning is well over sixty and looks his age, too. Still, thank
you for your information all the same," and, tipping the man a
shilling, he drove away.</p>

<p>"Now for it," he told himself as he turned up the narrow
track the man had indicated. "It's a long shot, but then I've
been making long shots all along and hitting the bull's-eye
every time."</p>

<p>He soon came upon the shed, the large rackety-looking
structure with the great big padlocked door. At one time, he
saw, it had been well tarred over, but now it was showing the
ravages of wind and rain, badly. He noted that though it lay
some yards off the track, right on the sand, two heavy broad
planks had been stretched parallel across, apparently so that a
motor car could be driven inside. "Gad," he exclaimed
frowningly, "he could have put his car in there and lain hidden
the whole day long!"</p>

<p>He examined the big padlock on the door and realized at once
that he could not pick it. He reckoned, however, that some of
the boards forming the walls of the shed looked pretty rotten
and could be easily prised out, allowing him to get inside that
way. He had no idea what exactly he was hoping to find, but
thought it just possible the missing rifle might be there.</p>

<p>He looked round furtively, but there was no one in sight. His
range of view, however, was very limited, for with the shed in
the hollow between two sandhills, the winding track along which
he had come was only visible for little more than a hundred
yards.</p>

<p>A chilling east wind was blowing up the sand and it stung
like a thousand needles against his face.</p>

<p>"And if he came here," he muttered, "I don't wonder he got
plenty in his clothes. Mine will be in the devil of a state if I
stay here long."</p>

<p>Scouting round the back of the shed, he found two boards
which he thought could be easily prised away, but he must do the
job carefully, he told himself, so as to leave no traces that
anyone had been there. Then, realizing it would appear
suspicious if anyone happened to pass by and note an empty car
in front of the locked-up shed, he decided to drive his car
round to the back of the shed where it would be out of sight.
So, with a grimace of annoyance at the thought of having later
to blow them up again, he let the wind out of his tyres and got
the car round to where he wanted it. Then, with the help of a
tyre-lever, he soon got the boards out and squeezed himself into
the shed.</p>

<p>Although he had a torch with him, he did not switch it on at
first, letting his eyes become gradually accustomed to the
dimness. Quite a little light was filtering in from the cracks
in the shed walls.</p>

<p>Soon being able to pick things out, he saw a small rowing
boat in one corner and, at the farther end of the shed, a camp-bed,
a chair and a small deal table. Upon the table were a
Primus stove, a good oil lamp and a few kitchen utensils.
Underneath was a big galvanized-iron pail. Near the door were a
dozen or so of big flat paving-like stones laid down, evidently,
to run a car over them when it was garaged in the shed. The air
was close, with a dank, heavy smell.</p>

<p>Now flashing his torch, his eyes at once fell upon a patch of
oil on one of the paving stones.</p>

<p>"And that girl said he'd not been out shooting since the
winter months," he nodded, "but I'll swear that oil has not been
there that time. So he's been here much later than that," and
his interest quickened at once with the thought of what it might
mean.</p>

<p>Seating himself down upon the camp-bed, he let his eyes roam
round everywhere, hoping that his life's training would enable
him to pick out something that needed some unusual
explanation.</p>

<p>And pick out something he very soon did&mdash;quite a good-sized
area of the sand towards the far end of the shed was of a
different shade from that of the sand elsewhere. It looked
whiter and cleaner. Striding over to it at once, the impression
was lost directly he approached near, with the sand then looking
no different from anywhere else, and he had to go back to the
other end of the shed again to note exactly where it was.</p>

<p>Stirring over the surface vigorously with his foot, quite a
number of sand-beetles at once came to light. He bent down close
and smelt hard, but in an instant had straightened himself up
again and, with a slightly quickened beating at his heart, was
looking round for a board or shovel with which to rake up the
sand. He had smelt a tainted smell, as if something was buried
there. There was no doubt about it. The smell was quite
strong.</p>

<p>His eyes fell at once upon the big iron pail, but, snatching
it up, he whistled as he held it suspended in mid-air. The top
rim of the pail was highly polished, and with scratches all the
way round, quite different from the lower end and the
inside.</p>

<p>Great Scot, then the pail had already been used for the very
purpose he himself was now going to put it to!</p>

<p>Taking off his coat, he began to scoop vigorously in the
middle of the patch of cleaner sand, and with almost every scoop
he made there was stronger evidence that something was buried
there. The taint soon became nauseous.</p>

<p>Quite certain now as to what he was going to find, the
expression upon his face was grim and hard, and the quickened
beating of his heart was not all due to his exertions.</p>

<p>What a devil this Hatherleigh was! The taking of human life
was nothing to him now, and if he had been intending to get rid
of the boy, burying him here might be one of the safest things
to do, for who would imagine any murderer daring to hide the
body of his victim upon his own premises? Yet, Hatherleigh would
dare, for his courage was of the reckless kind which would take
any risk, however dreadful, in its stride. He was a gambler in
everything he did.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of hard scooping, Larose felt the pail
knock up against something and, with all his life's training
among gruesome things, a thrill of horror stirred in him as a
human foot came into view.</p>

<p>Giving himself a short spell to prepare for what would
follow, he began clearing away the sand much more carefully now,
and soon came upon the upper part of the body and the head. It
was not a pleasant sight, but the dryness of the sand had, in
part, had a mummifying effect, and the shrivelled features were
quite recognizable. He had not the slightest doubt he was
looking at Harold Smith, as the hair was long and silver-shaded
as the maid had described.</p>

<p>Then a blazing anger surged through him, as he saw there was
a scarf wound tightly round the neck.</p>

<p>"God, he was strangled," he exclaimed chokingly. He spat on
the ground. "And I have shaken hands with and eaten at the table
of the black-hearted devil who did it!"</p>

<p>A fierce desire for a full and speedy vengeance surged
through him and he made up his mind, instantly, what he would
do. Without a moment's unnecessary delay, Hatherleigh should be
taken into custody. He should be arrested that very day and
charged with murder. The investigation into the death of the
doctor, however, should still go on and, with Hatherleigh out of
the way, an intensive search should be made all round the Manor
for the missing rifle. With that in possession of the
authorities, a ballistic expert would be able to verify without
any shadow of doubt that from that rifle had been fired the
bullet which had been taken from Dr. Monk's head.</p>

<p>Leaving everything exactly as he found it, a few minutes
later he was speeding with all haste to Norwich. The Chief
Constable of Norfolk, Major Battey, was a personal friend of his
and he thought it best to approach him, rather than Scotland
Yard, so that there would be no delay in apprehending
Hatherleigh. No risk must be run of his learning that his shed
had been visited and his ghastly secret discovered.</p>

<p>The Chief Constable, however, was hard to locate and it was
not until nearly three o'clock that Larose had been able to run
him to earth.</p>

<p>He listened with almost incredulous amazement to the story
Larose had to tell. He knew Hatherleigh, personally, and meeting
him often at the County Club, at first could not credit such a
good fellow and one of such nice appearance as being a callous
murderer.</p>

<p>"But we must be very certain of everything, Mr. Larose," he
said warningly, "and I must be perfectly sure of all your facts
before I issue a warrant. The scandal would be terrific if it
turns out you have made a mistake." He smiled. "You see, you are
a free-lance and stand to lose nothing, while I am in a very
responsible position and a false step would mean ruin to
me."</p>

<p>"I know that, sir," nodded Larose, "but with this last crime
the evidence is happily much more than circumstantial. This shed
is leased by Hatherleigh, the maids at his house will identify
the body there as that of Harold Smith he took away with him
that early morning in August last and the scarf twisted round
the corpse's neck is conclusive proof that the boy was murdered.
Mr. Gerald Burton of the Foreign Office will also be able to
identify the boy and give evidence that the latter was employed
at the club in Hoichow where this Hatherleigh was a member."</p>

<p>"All right, then," said the Chief Constable, "we'll start off
for that shed at once."</p>

<p>So, in a very few minutes, Larose, with the Chief Constable
sitting next to him and two plain-clothes men in the back seat,
was leading the way in his own car, followed by a police
ambulance, close behind. There was little conversation and very
soon they were passing over the Cley marshes and upon the
winding track among the sandhills.</p>

<p>"It's not a quarter of a mile away now," said Larose
cheerfully, "but you won't see the shed until we're almost on
it. It's just round that sandhill there."</p>

<p>"But what a smell of burning," remarked the Chief Constable.
He frowned. "I should have thought any sort of bonfire would be
dangerous with this strong wind blowing." He looked round and,
taking in the desolate surroundings, added shudderingly: "What
an ideal spot for any murder!"</p>

<p>They rounded the bend in the track and then Larose gave a
startled cry. The shed was no longer there, but in its place a
blackened mass of smouldering ruins. "Damnation," he exclaimed
furiously, "it's been burnt to the ground!"</p>

<p>He pulled up the car with a jerk. Two men were standing on
the track. "What's happened?" he asked them, breathlessly. "Who
set this alight?"</p>

<p>"We don't know, sir," replied one of the men. He jerked his
head back. "We're from the coastguard station there and we've
only just arrived. We only noticed the smoke a few minutes ago
and came at once to see what it was."</p>

<p>"But you must have dropped a lighted match," said the
frowning Chief Constable to Larose.</p>

<p>"No, no, I didn't," retorted Larose instantly. "I didn't
strike one the whole time I was here. Besides, it is nearly four
hours since I left, and this fire's not been going as long as
that."</p>

<p>"No, that it hasn't," agreed the coastguard who had spoken
before. "I gave it half an hour and not a minute more. The wood
of that old shed was as dry as tinder and with all that tar on
it it would have burnt like hell in this wind."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Major," said Larose sharply, turning to the
Chief Constable. "We'll find what we want." He nodded
significantly. "The fire won't have burnt that. It was a good
three feet down in the sand."</p>

<p>Snatching up pieces of charred wood which had escaped
destruction, they all began energetically to scrape away the
still glowing embers in order to expose the sand underneath. The
trench Larose had dug was uncovered almost immediately, but
Larose's face blanched in consternation when he saw that the end
of it where the body had lain had been made wider still and that
no sign of any body was now to be seen.</p>

<p>With the now much blackened pail he scooped on furiously in
every direction, only desisting when he had cleared a space wide
enough to have held half a dozen bodies.</p>

<p>He rose shakily to his feet and turned to the Chief Constable
with a face that was tense and white in its fury.</p>

<p>"I've been beaten, sir," he said quietly. "The body has been
taken away!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; A THIEF IN THE NIGHT.</h2>

<p class="first">LAROSE turned to the puzzled coastguards,
puzzled because of an ambulance having been brought there and,
also, because four members of the little party had all the smack
of plainclothes men about them.</p>

<p>"This shed was set on fire intentionally," he scowled. "Did
you notice any car coming this way?"</p>

<p>The coastguards shook their heads. "No, sir, and we shouldn't
have noticed one if it had come," replied one of them. "Our
station is more than a mile away, right at the end of the spit,
and what road there is stops where we are." He looked doubtful.
"And if the party who started this fire came in a car and didn't
want to be seen, I reckon he'd have driven down one of the side
roads where he wouldn't have met anybody."</p>

<p>"Who does the shed belong to?" asked the Chief Constable.</p>

<p>"Tom Baddock, the fisherman," was the reply, "but he moved
off to Yarmouth three or four years ago and the shed's not been
used until last winter when a gent hired it for the duck
shooting. I don't know who the gent is. I've never seen
him."</p>

<p>They drove back to Norwich a very silent little party, Larose
most dejected, the Chief Constable hiding under a grim smile the
doubt as to whether Larose were becoming the subject of
hallucinations, and the plain-clothes men not knowing what to
make of it at all. These last, although having been told very
little, had been expecting something very much out of the
ordinary and were disappointed in consequence.</p>

<p>Having got rid of his passengers with the promise of calling
upon the Chief Constable later in the day, Larose proceeded to
the club, with no expectation that Hatherleigh would be found in
the card-room, or, indeed, anywhere upon the premises.</p>

<p>To his great surprise, however, there was Hatherleigh, as
large as life and with the inevitable fat cigarette between his
lips, at one of the card-tables in all the thrills of an
exciting game of poker. He looked up as Larose entered and, with
a half wink and a jerk over his shoulder, invited him to come
and stand behind to look at the hand he was holding.</p>

<p>For the life of him, Larose could not restrain an almost
friendly smile as he complied. The wretch was so full of courage
and was putting up such a bold face upon what must have been for
him a most terrible shock!</p>

<p>"But it was all a big bluff," said Larose, when a couple of
hours later he was talking to the Chief Constable and telling
him how merry and lively Hatherleigh had appeared. "Of course it
was he who had taken away the boy's body and fired the shed. I
didn't dare to ask, in case it got back to him, but I could
guess he hadn't been at the club long, for there were only three
cigarette butts in the ashtray in front of him, and I reckon
that meant about half an hour. Besides, this afternoon he was
different from his usual self in several ways and, for one, he
took his drinks much quicker as if he needed them badly after
some great mental stress. Also, I am sure it was his relief at
having escaped a dreadful danger which made him appear so happy
and good-tempered."</p>

<p>"Where do you suggest he would have taken the body?" asked
the Chief Constable in a tone as if he were not too certain
about anything.</p>

<p>Larose shrugged his shoulders. "A thousand places, everything
was so easy for him. Trussed up in some of that sacking I saw in
the shed he could have taken it twenty or thirty miles away and
dropped it, weighted with stones, into some quiet stream where
we can never find it now!"</p>

<p>The Chief Constable frowned. "See here, Mr. Larose," he said
sharply, going off on quite a different track, "I'm going to be
quite frank with you. I am not convinced Hatherleigh is that
patient who consulted Dr. Monk two years ago. You've got nothing
like a strong enough case to prove it there."</p>

<p>"You don't think so?" queried Larose, hiding his annoyance
under a ready smile.</p>

<p>"No, I don't, and until you can prove those tablets
Hatherleigh was taking when in Burnham-on-Crouch came from a
prescription given by that doctor, or bring witnesses who can
identify Hatherleigh as the Charles Henson who consulted him, we
are certain of nothing. You tell me the nurse whom Dr. Monk had
at that time is now in Australia, and that no one at the coffee
palace has any recollection of what the George Hunter who stayed
there is like."</p>

<p>"That is so, sir," agreed Larose. "I can produce no one who
remembers him." He sighed heavily and rose to his feet. "Well,
leave it at that. I may be coming back to you in a few days with
something more certain to go upon," and he left the room,
annoyed that the Chief Constable was so hard to convince, and
yet relieved that no move was to be made in Hatherleigh's
direction, which would cause him to find out he was under
suspicion of anything.</p>

<p>That night Hardacre drank deeply both at dinner and
afterwards before he went to bed. He realized he had escaped
from a desperate situation only by the very skin of his teeth,
as it had been just by chance he had gone to the shed that
morning, the first time he had been there since he had buried
Harold Smith under the sand.</p>

<p>He had had no reason at all for going there, but something
had impelled him to see if everything were all right. Then, when
he had discovered what had happened, his terror had been even
beyond oaths. He had just stood gaping and gaping, with his body
drenched in a cold and clammy sweat.</p>

<p>However, he had quickly recovered himself, and then his
movements had been like lightning, and yet with every step
carried out with extreme care. With no difficulty, for the body
had been emaciated and light, it had been a simple matter to
cram it into two of the large sacks upon the camp-bed, one being
pulled down over the other, and yet leave plenty of room for a
generous enough allowance of sand to make it sink down to the
bottom of whatever stream or pond in which he was going to throw
it.</p>

<p>Lumping his now heavy burden into the back of his car, he
proceeded to fire the shed with the help of the oil in the
container of the lamp. Waiting a bare couple of minutes to make
certain the shed would blaze up well, and propping the big doors
open to ensure a good draught of air, he had driven off quickly,
making his way at first, as the coastguard had surmised, along
one of the many little by-roads leading off from the coast.</p>

<p>He had no idea as to where he was going to hide the sacks,
for the moment his foremost thought being to get away as quickly
as possible from the neighbourhood of the shed, and in so doing
avoid passing through any town and as many of the little
villages as he could. His reasoning powers were in part numbed
by the dreadful shock he had received, and he contented himself
with concentrating upon his driving, a concentration which was
most necessary in view of the pace he was travelling along the
narrow winding lanes.</p>

<p>Presently, however, having put several miles between himself
and the shed and meeting with no dreaded police car filled with
stern-faced accusing men, his pulses began to slow down, his
breathing was no longer jerky and, finally, he smiled a cold,
grim smile.</p>

<p>Gad, what an escape! Perhaps another ten minutes&mdash;maybe
even five&mdash;and the police would have caught him red-handed
tumbling the body into the sack, for of course whoever had seen
it there in the sand would have rushed off to them at once to
tell his tale. But how the hell had the body come to be found at
all? How the hell&mdash;&mdash;But for the moment he stopped
considering that, realizing what he had to do now was to make
himself perfectly safe by putting the sacks and their contents
where they would never be likely to be found.</p>

<p>Again he smiled, his smile, however, now being a contemptuous
one. Would he drop it over a bridge into some stream? That's
what the police would think of at once and it would not be
beyond them to drag in the water below every little bridge
within a radius of twenty miles. No, there would be nothing as
clumsy as that for him! Instead, he'd do something very
different. He would drive deep into the Fens, forty miles would
take him into their very heart, and he would dump the sacks into
one of the many thousands of drains there. And he would not
choose a big or a deep one, either. He would throw it into one
of the smaller ones where the current was sluggish and there
were plenty of eels. He knew of just such a drain, for he had
once gone spearing there and had obtained quite a good number of
the slimy fish. Also, he would cut slits in the sacks, so that
the eels could get in easily and finish with the flesh long
before the sacks had had time to rot.</p>

<p>So, less than an hour later, all that remained of Harold
Smith was lying deep in the ooze of a narrow drain in a lonely
part of the Methwold Fens, and the eels, as Hardacre had
surmised they would, were already mustering for a banquet.</p>

<p>As he drove away, convinced that no human eye could have been
following any of his movements, Hardacre took stock of his
position, and his confidence that he was now quite safe became
the stronger with every mile he covered. There was absolutely
nothing against him and he could defy all the police in the
world to find out anything.</p>

<p>How did it concern <i>him</i> if by some extraordinary chance
someone had uncovered that body in the shed? He would say that
he had not been near the place for seven or eight months and no
one would be able to prove the contrary. Cutting through those
by-roads, as he had done when he had taken the boy there in the
very early hours of that morning, he had not met a soul for the
last five or six miles of his journey, and it had been the same
a couple of hours back, this very day. There had been no one to
make a note of his car passing, even when it had crossed the
main Holt-Cromer road, the only place where he might reasonably
have expected to meet someone.</p>

<p>So he was quite safe, he told himself, because whatever
evidence there had been that some crime might have been
committed he had snatched away as if it had never had any
existence at all. If there had been that frantic rushing off to
the police, as he supposed, then the teller of the tale must now
be about as discredited a party as it was possible to imagine.
Who would believe his story and how could he ever explain
satisfactorily how he came to be violating another person's
private property when he had found the body?</p>

<p>He frowned here. But how did it come about that anyone had
gone into that lonely shed and, above all, started digging in
the sand? The only explanation he, Hardacre, could think of was
that some tramp, finding the shed untenanted and in a lonely
situation, had broken in for shelter or to see what he could
steal. Then, he might have had a dog with him, and the animal,
smelling the putrefying body under the sand, had made his master
curious as to what was there. So, to his amazement uncovering a
corpse, the tramp, no doubt in the expectation of getting some
reward, would not have lost a minute in making known his
discovery.</p>

<p>Well, what would happen now? Finding no body, the police
might dismiss the whole matter or, perhaps, as a matter of
routine, start making a few inquiries. If they came to him, of
course, he would appear as astonished as anyone, but as far as
he was concerned the matter would end there. Probably it would
end there, too, with the police. He drew in a deep breath. But
what a narrow escape he had had and how equally chance had
balanced the scales! It had been by chance only that the body
had been discovered and by chance only that he had happened to
go to the shed that morning in the very nick of time!</p>

<p>Hardacre's next move was well in accord with his resolute
and, naturally, bold and defiant nature. He drove straight to
the Norwich Club for his usual afternoon's game of poker, as if
nothing at all had happened to disturb his peace of mind.</p>

<p>As Larose had rightly surmised from the few cigarette butts
in the ashtray, he had not been there long before he saw Larose
come into the room and, while a pang of uneasiness stirred in
him at the sight of the one man above all others he was most
anxious not to come in close contact with, the several whiskies
he had already consumed upon an empty stomach made him, at once,
dismiss the matter lightly. Of course Larose had had nothing to
do with the finding of the body, and he comforted himself once
again that its discovery had been chance, and chance only!</p>

<p>This happy frame of mind continued for some hours, indeed
until after he had finished the excellent dinner he had partaken
of by himself at home. Then a horrible recollection stirred in
him, for he remembered suddenly that when Larose, at his
invitation, had come and stood behind him to look over the good
hand of cards he was holding, the latter's clothes had smelt of
burning! Yes, exactly as if he had just come from near some
bonfire! Then Larose had been searching among the embers of that
burnt-out shed! Hell, it seemed probable! God! What did it
mean?</p>

<p>It was many hours before he got to sleep that night and for a
long while his thoughts would give him no rest. One moment he
was terror-struck that Larose had somehow got upon his track,
and the next he was cursing himself for being such an
imaginative fool. It was impossible, he told himself, over and
over again, that he had left any trail behind him which even the
shrewdest detective could uncover! Every step he had taken he
had made himself secure, and yet&mdash;what did that smell of
burning about Larose's clothes mean?</p>

<p>The next morning, however, after only a few hours of troubled
slumber, he dismissed the whole thing as nonsense, and a pint of
champagne with his breakfast made him his old confident self
again. So, when the Yarmouth fisherman from whom he had been
renting the shed rang up to say it had been burnt down and asked
him rather rudely if it had happened through anything he had
done, he was quite polite in explaining it couldn't be, as he
had not been near the place since the preceding February.</p>

<p>"So it could hardly have been anything to do with me, could
it?" he laughed, and then he asked: "Who told you about it?"</p>

<p>"The police have been round to me," was the reply. "I think
the coastguards had rung them up. It happened yesterday
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Well, that finishes that," said Hardacre, preparing to hang
up. "At any rate I wasn't going to keep the shed on after the
year was up. I've only used it about half a dozen times and it
wasn't worth the money I was paying you."</p>

<p>He remained at home much later than usual that afternoon, in
case the police should come to make any inquiries, but, to his
relief, nothing happened, and determined to carry on just as
usual he drove into Norwich to the club. Later in the evening he
went, by invitation, to the Rectory, and Dorothy played for him.
He thought she was looking so wonderfully pretty that, when they
happened to be alone for a few minutes, it was only with an
effort that he restrained himself from seizing hold of her and
kissing her.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock he bade them good night with great
reluctance and, when he had gone, the Rector said thoughtfully
to his daughter: "You know, dear, I believe Mr. Hatherleigh
thinks quite a lot of you, and if you wanted&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I don't want," snapped Dorothy, crimsoning up warmly. "I
like him well enough, but there'll never be anything beyond
that." She spoke sharply. "So don't you encourage him, Dad. I
think you do."</p>

<p>The Rector pursed up his lips. "But you might do very much
worse, Dorothy. He's a fine fellow, quite well-to-do, and a good
churchman. I'm sure he'd be very kind to you."</p>

<p>She turned on him in a flash. "Has he been lending you money,
Dad?" she asked peremptorily. She nodded. "I believe he
has."</p>

<p>It was now the Rector's turn to get red. "Just a little,
Dorothy," he replied uncomfortably, "just enough to help us get
our new car and pay off those few bills I had."</p>

<p>"But I don't like it," she said, looking most disturbed. "It
puts us under an obligation to him and will make him think I've
got to be nice to him in consequence. I noticed to-night he
seemed as if he thought he had some right to make me do what he
wanted when he asked me to play for him. He gave me what I took
to be quite a possessive smile."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" commented her father irritably. "Mr.
Hatherleigh's not that kind of man. He'd never take an inch more
than you allowed him."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that," retorted Dorothy. "At any rate I'm
a bit afraid of him."</p>

<p>"Well, don't be," frowned the Rector, "and realize I should
be quite pleased to have him for a son-in-law."</p>

<p>The next morning Dorothy went into Norwich to do some
shopping, and quite by chance Larose was passing in his car and
saw her going into a florist's. As Hardacre had done the
previous evening, he thought how pretty she looked, and a sharp
pang of horror stabbed him as he visualized her in Hatherleigh's
arms. She must be warned somehow, and he pulled up his car to
the kerb and, alighting, waited for her to come out of the
shop.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss Bannister," he smiled, when at length he
saw her. "You haven't forgotten our little talk, have you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," she replied, and the smile died from her
face to be replaced by a pretty frown, as she asked: "How are
you getting on with your inquiry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not too badly," said Larose. "I'll get to the end of it
one day."</p>

<p>"Any more suspects?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Lots more," laughed Larose, "dozens of them." His face
sobered down. "Ah, that reminds me. There's something very
important I'd like you to tell me and it's lucky we met like
this." He nodded in the direction of a cafe across the road.
"What about us going in there and having a cup of coffee?" Then,
as she looked at her watch and hesitated, he added earnestly:
"Do please come, Miss Bannister, as it's very important and I
promise you that, afterwards, you'll be glad you did." He
nodded. "Yes, I really mean it. It's Fate that I've run into you
here."</p>

<p>She hesitated no longer and, following him into the cafe,
they sat down in a corner where they would not be overheard. For
a couple of minutes or so they talked of general matters and
then the girl asked sharply: "Well, what is it you want to tell
me?"</p>

<p>"Forgive my questioning you," said Larose, coming to the
point as quickly as she had, "but do you happen to be engaged to
Mr. Hatherleigh?"</p>

<p>She flushed, as if indignant that the question had been put
to her. "Certainly not!" she replied. "He's just a friend,
nothing more." Her eyes flashed. "But why do you want to know?
What's that to do with you?"</p>

<p>"Only that I'd hate to see a girl like you tied up to a man
like him," replied Larose quickly. He spoke very solemnly. "I
tell you he's not a nice man."</p>

<p>"You didn't know it the other day," she countered instantly.
"You had never heard of him until I told you about him. Then
have you found out anything since?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "Yes, and it's not to his credit." He spoke
quickly. "Look here, Miss Bannister, always be very careful
about middle-aged men who are bachelors and have lived a lot in
the East&mdash;unless you know everything about them. You
understand?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," she said sharply, and then she added a little
more gently, "but I'm sure you mean well."</p>

<p>"I do," said Larose, "and I see I'll have to put it more
plainly." He spoke emphatically. "I mean he's an out-and-out
scoundrel with a criminal record behind him."</p>

<p>She looked rather frightened. "Then, thank you for telling
me. I'll be on my guard." She frowned as if suddenly remembering
something. "But he comes regularly to our church every
Sunday."</p>

<p>"To see you," smiled Larose, "and I don't wonder." His voice
hardened. "He's a loathsome hypocrite and I promise you shall
have proof of it before very long."</p>

<p>Her breath came quickly. "Can I warn Father?"</p>

<p>"No, no, please don't," he pleaded earnestly. "If you do, you
may spoil everything, besides getting me into dreadful trouble.
I'm running a great risk in warning you now, and if Mr.
Hatherleigh gets to hear of it he may try to get his revenge
upon me in a terrible way. He's capable of anything. Now promise
me you won't say a word to a single soul."</p>

<p>The girl sighed. "All right, Mr. Larose. I promise you I
won't speak." She looked very troubled. "But how am I to meet
him after this?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just do a bit of acting," smiled Larose. "I'm sure
you'll be equal to it." He frowned. "Avoid him as much as
possible. But it won't have to be for long. I promise you
everybody will know everything very soon."</p>

<p>She heaved another sigh and then smiled back. "Well, let's
talk about something else while we finish our coffee. It's a
pity to waste it."</p>

<p>They parted in a few minutes and, though not a little shocked
at the warning which had been given her, the girl felt she ought
to be grateful to Larose for having spoken to her. She was not
doubting the truth of what he had said.</p>

<p>Then the last thing she or Larose would have wished happened,
for Hardacre saw them as they were saying good-bye. He had come
into Norwich to have some small adjustments made to his car, and
had just come out of the garage when he caught sight of them on
the pavement, not ten yards away. Neither of them had noticed
him, but, for some reason he did not attempt to analyse then, he
darted back instantly, to see them, however, shake hands and
immediately go off in different ways.</p>

<p>He scowled angrily. He had had no idea they had ever met and
yet there they had been smiling at each other as if they were
quite old friends. All his fears of Larose surged back, with the
greater fear now that the ex-detective might put the girl
against him. He clenched his hands tightly together. Gad, if
only he could get his hands on the fellow's neck!</p>

<p>The following afternoon Larose went into a small newsagent's
and tobacconist's shop in Hoxton and addressed himself smilingly
to the plump little man behind the counter.</p>

<p>"Remember me, Bert?" he asked.</p>

<p>The man screwed up his small piggy eyes. "No, sir, I
don't.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, come now," laughed Larose. "What about those jewels you
got from that safe in Wadham Court and the seven years you got
after? Think again."</p>

<p>The man's jaw dropped, his round moon-like face went pale and
he broke into a nervous laugh. "Of course, of course, I remember
you now, sir. You're Inspector Larose."</p>

<p>"No, not now," said Larose. "You forget how time flies. Why,
I've been away from the Yard for longer than nine years and it
must have been about a year before that when you met with your
little spot of trouble."</p>

<p>"So it was, sir, so it was," nodded the man. "It's ten years
ago last March." He lowered his voice. "I've been out three
years."</p>

<p>"And how's trade?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Not bad." He shrugged his shoulders and made a grimace round
the little shop. "Just jogging along. That's all." He grinned a
little sheepishly. "Things are not so exciting as they used to
be."</p>

<p>"Going straight?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>He looked indignant. "Oh yes, sir, of course!"</p>

<p>Larose eyed him intently. "Well, would you like to earn ten
pounds?" He spoke sharply. "Ten pounds to do a little job for me
and keep your mouth shut afterwards."</p>

<p>The man's piggy eyes blinked. "What sort of job?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Open a safe. Quite an easy job and won't take you ten
minutes. The safe looks an old-fashioned one and shouldn't give
you any trouble. It's almost certain to be a cylinder lock."</p>

<p>"Your safe?" asked the man frowningly.</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No, someone else's whom I know quite
well, and so there'll be no pinching anything. I just want to
find out if this man's got some papers which he won't tell me
about. Nothing will be touched. One look to see if the papers
are there and that will be all."</p>

<p>The man whistled in surprise. "Whew, you want me to break in
somewhere?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," laughed Larose. "The man will be away, the hall
door will be open and the servants won't hear a sound. Still, if
they did I could easily square them." He spoke emphatically.
"Any trouble and I'll take all the blame. We'll go into the
house together to do the job."</p>

<p>"When do you want me?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"Now, straightaway. It's in the country and a good way from
Town. If we start at once you'll be able to come back by train
so that you'll be home about midnight. Can you leave the shop?
Then get what you think you'll want and come at once. I've got
my car a little way up the street."</p>

<p>The one-time convict was quite agreeable and, in a few
minutes, they were on their way to St. Michael's for Larose to
have a good look inside Hatherleigh's safe. It was quite
probable Hatherleigh might still have some of those white
tablets there, the ones he had been taking for the supposed
malady at Burnham, keeping them handy in case he ever had some
sort of relapse. If that were so, the chemist's label would
certainly be on the bottle and, from the number of the
prescription, positive proof would be forthcoming that Dr. Monk
had given it. Also, there was just a chance the missing rifle
might be in the safe, too.</p>

<p>He had no trust, however, in the man he was taking with him
to open the safe, rightly judging him to be of that criminal
type which can never break wholly with unlawful ways. He had no
intention of letting him learn where he was being taken and,
accordingly, when they had passed through Norwich, made a detour
of at least a dozen miles, through many little by-roads, before
they reached St. Michael's.</p>

<p>He pulled up his car in a lane some couple of hundred yards
or so from the Manor and motioned to Bert to follow him. He was
quite confident they would not be interrupted, as he knew
Hatherleigh was going to be away that evening at a club dinner,
and he had arranged with Jane for her and her sister to keep
well out of the way. He had told the former what he was
intending to do and, though a little frightened, she was so
incensed with her master for his secrecy about the boy to whom
they had become so attached, that she was quite prepared to do
everything asked of her.</p>

<p>They found the front door unlocked and with no delay tiptoed
into the study. "Now one thing, first," whispered Larose. "We'll
have a safe way of clearing out if we're interrupted," and, very
softly, he slipped the bolt at the bottom of the big french
window and left the window just ajar. After a quick glance at
the safe, Bert took a few things out of his pocket and, kneeling
down before the door, prepared for action.</p>

<p>A great surprise, however, awaited them. The door of the safe
was not shut, but only just pushed to, and all the ex-convict
had to do was to pull it open!</p>

<p>"Great Scot!" exclaimed Larose, looking most annoyed, "and
I've brought you down all this way for nothing."</p>

<p>"But I'll get my ten quid, won't I?" asked Bert anxiously. "I
was ready here to do the job, wasn't I?"</p>

<p>"Of course you'll have the money," nodded Larose and then,
noting a little wad of bank-notes upon the floor of the safe
right in front of everything, he ordered Bert peremptorily to
stand back. "Here, you go and sit in that chair over there and
don't walk about the room. Your work's done and we'll be off
again in two minutes."</p>

<p>Very reluctantly Bert did as he was told, for his natural
curiosity was strong and, apart from that, he, too, had caught
sight of the wad of bank-notes. He smacked his lips enviously,
wondering how many fivers would be there.</p>

<p>Then, at once, Larose's eyes fell upon a large bottle nearly
full of small white tablets, with the label of a well-known
Regent Street chemist upon it. Underneath he read: "Iodide of
Potassium. 10 grains. 1,000 tablets. Mr. C. Henson. To be taken
as directed M.H. 2404."</p>

<p>His eyes glistened. He had the number of the prescription and
it would be quite easy to learn by what doctor and when it had
been given.</p>

<p>He had a quick look through a number of documents, but there
was nothing of interest to him, and he pushed to the safe door
softly, leaving it as they had found it. Then, preceded by Bert,
they tiptoed from the room and the house.</p>

<p>"Now," said Larose as they were driving away, "I'll take you
into Norwich and you'll be able to catch the eight-twenty-five.
If we miss that, there's the last one at eleven-twenty. Have a
cigarette?"</p>

<p>Bert was quite agreeable but, when it came to lighting it,
there was some delay as Larose could not find his silver match-box
anywhere in his pocket and his companion had no matches on
him. However, Larose eventually found some in one of the pockets
of the car. A minute or two later Bert's hand came into contact
with a small object, smooth and hard, upon the seat between them
and, realizing it must be the missing match-box, said nothing
and slipped it into his own pocket. From the feel of it he
guessed it would probably be a silver one, and he thought, with
a grin, that it would be a nice little memento of his adventure
with the one-time great Inspector of Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>Depositing him at the railway station in Norwich, Larose gave
Bert the promised ten pounds and added one pound to cover his
fare back to Town, bidding good-bye to him, quite confident that
the man had no idea as to where he had been taken and would not
be able to find out.</p>

<p>In the last supposition, however, he was very much mistaken
for, while sitting in the chair as Larose was going through the
contents of the safe, Bert's sharp and cunning little eyes had
fallen upon an envelope upon the mantelpiece addressed to
Clement Hatherleigh, Esq., The Manor, St. Michael's, and all the
drive back into Norwich he had been thinking hard.</p>

<p>What an opportunity was awaiting him! A front door unlocked,
a safe open and a bundle of good, crisp bank-notes only waiting
to be taken! Larose, too, had told him the master of the house
would not be returning until well after midnight and that the
coast was quite clear until then. Yes, the chance was much too
good to be missed!</p>

<p>So, when Larose had left him, giving no thought to the
eight-twenty-five train, he walked quickly out of the railway station
into the street. The first thing to find out was where this
village of St. Michael's was, and he learnt it with the first
inquiry he made.</p>

<p>"Here, sonny," he said to a boy selling papers, "where's a
place called St. Michael's?"</p>

<p>"Ten miles out on the Holt road," replied the boy. He pointed
across the street. "That bus there will take you. It goes right
through and it is just going to start."</p>

<p>So in less than a couple of minutes Bert was tucked inside
the bus and was speeding through the city. Then good fortune
still continued to favour him for, just before the bus pulled up
in St. Michael's, he recognized the two white pillars at the
entrance to the drive of the Manor, between which he had passed
with Larose less than an hour previously.</p>

<p>"Gosh, what a bit of luck!" he murmured. "Why, the whole
thing's been arranged for me."</p>

<p>To his great joy, he found the front door still unlocked,
and, in a few moments, by the light of a new moon, was creeping
through the hall into the study. The study was in complete
darkness, but he chuckled in amusement at the way things were
all shaping for him as he struck a match from Larose's silver
box to locate the position of the electric light switch. The
door of the safe was still only pushed to and, very quickly, he
pocketed the bundle of notes and was rummaging through the other
things the safe contained. But there was no jewellery and
nothing he thought he could make use of.</p>

<p>So in a minute or two he desisted from his searching and
pushed to the safe door again. Then for a few moments he stood
hesitating. Should he leave the door as he had found it or shut
it properly? He decided to shut it, arguing that most probably
the owner of the safe was not aware how careless he had been,
and so, when he came home, if he happened to look at the safe
and saw it looked all right, he was not likely to open it and
look inside until he had some reason for going to it again. In
that case it might be even some days before he would discover
the loss of the bank-notes.</p>

<p>He closed the door as gently as he could, with only a faintly
audible click, and left the house without a second's delay.
Then, to his great joy, not ten minutes later a Norwich-bound
bus overtook him, and, arriving in the city in plenty of time to
catch the last train for London, he reached home without event
in the small hours of the morning. He had counted the notes and
there was £215 in the wad.</p>

<p>Hardacre arrived home soon after midnight and put himself to
bed at once. He was not feeling too bright after a very worrying
day. Although he kept on reassuring himself that he was quite
safe and had absolutely nothing to fear, yet nevertheless he had
been continually going over everything again and again. How was
it someone had come to take the trouble to scoop up all that
sand, indeed how was it anyone, in the first instance, had come
to go into the shed? Then how was it no one from the police had
come to him and repeated the tale the finder of Harold's body
must have told them, on the chance the tale were true and that
he, Hardacre, could throw light upon someone who might have been
making use of the shed?</p>

<p>He, Hardacre, had been all prepared to meet any detective in
a breezy hearty manner and, while expressing great surprise,
pretend to be greatly amused and to throw doubt upon the whole
matter.</p>

<p>But the police had not come, nothing had happened and the
very silence had been disquieting. It was just as if he were
ringed round with enemies, betraying no sign of their presence
and yet, perhaps, working feverishly to close in upon him.</p>

<p>He slept very badly and soon after five woke up and could not
drop into a doze again. Presently, he thought he would be all
the better for a brandy and soda, added to which he would take a
good dose of his iodide of potassium tablets. They always seemed
to steady his nerves.</p>

<p>He put on his dressing-gown and went downstairs. He heard no
sound of movement in the house, but did not expect any, as it
was much too early for the servants to be about. Proceeding into
the study, where he always kept some good liqueur brandy in a
cupboard, he switched on the light and then his half blinking
eyes fell upon an object on the carpet at his feet. He picked it
up and saw it was a silver match-box. He frowned, wondering how
it had come there. Then his frown deepened until his eyebrows
almost came together and his mouth gaped wide. Surely, he
recognized it? It was of an unusual shape and had he not seen it
often, lying on the table when they had been playing poker at
the Norwich Club? It had the letters G.L. engraved upon it! He
scowled. Yes, it must be the one belonging to Gilbert
Larose!</p>

<p>Dumbfounded in his astonishment, for a long minute he stood
staring at the match-box in his hand, and then his eyes wandered
round the room, almost as if expecting to see the owner of it
there, too. The long curtain before the french window stirred
and, the draught fanning his face, with a sharp exclamation, he
strode over and pulled the curtain aside. The window was
open!</p>

<p>For the moment not associating everything together, he put
the match-box on the mantelshelf and, going to the cupboard,
proceeded to mix himself a stiff brandy and soda. Then,
remembering the tablets he was intending to take, he took the
bunch of keys he had brought down with him in the pocket of his
dressing-gown and opened the safe.</p>

<p>He reached for the big bottle of tablets automatically and
was actually about to unscrew the stopper before he realized the
disorder in the contents of the safe. They were not as he had
left them and his papers had been pushed about everywhere. What
the devil did it mean?</p>

<p>A startled expression froze upon his face and he almost
choked in consternation. He rapped out a fierce oath and,
dropping the bottle of tablets upon the carpet in his haste,
began searching feverishly for the bundle of bank-notes he knew
should be there.</p>

<p>"They've gone!" he exclaimed hoarsely. "The safe's been
rifled!" and a wave of terror surged through him as he added:
"It's that devil, Larose!"</p>

<p>Some few minutes later he was lying back heavily in his big
arm-chair and, with a second brandy and soda in his shaking
hand, putting everything, as he thought, together.</p>

<p>During the night Larose had broken into his house through the
french window, opened his safe and stolen more than £200 in Bank
of England notes! His match-box had dropped out of his pocket
and, unknowingly, he had left it behind him!</p>

<p>All that was evident and there could be no question about it.
Then, however, came the mystery, and even in his fury Hardacre
sweated with fear. Larose was upon his track! Why and what for?
Why had Larose broken into the house and opened the safe?</p>

<p>It had certainly not been for the money, because he could not
have known it would be there. That was just blind chance and, in
a way, Hardacre thought he could understand it. Perhaps, with
all Larose's bounce and swank at being considered by everyone as
the master of a fine property like Carmel Abbey, his flash wife
kept him short of ready money and, having mixed all his life
with thieves and pick-pockets, he had become as light-fingered
as any of them and prepared to snatch at anything that came his
way.</p>

<p>Still, if he had certainly not come after the money, what had
he come for? Why was he interfering in his, Hardacre's, affairs
at all, and what had he been hoping to find in the safe? Even if
he had been the one to discover Harold's body and he, Hardacre,
could not yet bring himself to believe that was undoubtedly the
case, surely by no stretch of imagination could he have been
expecting to come upon anything there to help him make good the
discredited story he might have told the police?</p>

<p>Sick with apprehension and with a bad headache, he switched
off the light and returned upstairs. Then, thinking it would do
him good, he got himself a very hot bath. Soothed by the warmth,
his head became easier and then, all suddenly, his courage came
back and he made up his mind to take the boldest course, which
so often was the best.</p>

<p>Larose had nothing against him, he couldn't have, but he had
something against Larose and, by hell, he would show him up. He
would go straight to Major Battey and lay everything before him.
The Chief Constable had always been most friendly when they met
at the club and, apart from that, would have to take notice of
what he told him.</p>

<p>No, he would not actually lay a charge against Larose. The
police would do that and Larose would be asked to explain where
he was during the night. That would be a nasty snag for him. Of
course, he had broken into the house, after he, Hardacre, had
come in, and that would have been after midnight, and perhaps
well on into the small hours of the morning. The servants were
always late ones to go to bed and Larose would not have dared to
start while any of the lights in the house were burning.</p>

<p>Hardacre lay a long time in the bath, gloating over the
humiliation in store for Larose and then, dressing leisurely,
proceeded downstairs. It was daylight now and he could hear
movements in the kitchen. Going into the study, he examined the
bolt of the long french window and saw, as he had expected, that
the bolt could easily have been manipulated from outside by
anyone with the proper tools.</p>

<p>Then, he remembered he had left the match-box on the
mantelshelf and turned round to examine it again and put it away
safely in his pocket. But to his amazement he could not see it
anywhere, and his face broke into a puzzled frown. He was quite
certain he had put it on the mantelshelf. He remembered most
distinctly. He looked everywhere, but it was nowhere to be seen,
and he hurried up to his bedroom to make sure he had not slipped
it in the pocket of his pyjamas. But it was not there or
anywhere in the room.</p>

<p>He almost ran downstairs into the kitchen where Ellen was
lighting the kitchen fire. "Where have you put that silver
match-box that was on the mantelshelf in the study?" he asked
peremptorily.</p>

<p>The girl looked blank. "I haven't touched any match-box,
sir," she replied. "I haven't seen one."</p>

<p>He regarded her scowlingly. "But you must have moved it. It
was there half an hour ago."</p>

<p>"But I haven't been in the study this morning, sir."</p>

<p>"What about Jane? Where's she?"</p>

<p>"She's in bed, sir. She's not got up yet. She's got one of
her sick headaches."</p>

<p>So Hardacre went back into the study for another search, but
to his increasing anger and amazement with no success. He strode
back into the kitchen again. "Look here, what time did you go
upstairs last night? Half-past eleven? Then did anyone call
after I left yesterday afternoon? And the front door was never
opened? Then did you hear me come in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, the closing of the door woke me up. I am a light
sleeper."</p>

<p>"And you heard no other movements in the night?"</p>

<p>The girl seemed surprised. "No, sir, nothing at all until I
heard you go downstairs very early this morning. Then I went off
to sleep again."</p>

<p>Hardacre could tell she was speaking the truth. She was a
simple-minded girl and not of the kind who could carry on any
deception, without showing it. He turned and left the kitchen
without another word, cursing savagely under his breath. So that
damned Larose had discovered he had left his match-box behind
and had actually had the nerve to come back and get it! It was
almost unbelievable! Of course, he had got it when he, Hardacre,
had been having his bath. He gnashed his teeth together. No
matter, he would get even with him in another and more direct
manner.</p>

<p>But if Hardacre were furious because the evidence he had had
against Larose had been snatched from him, he would have been
much more furious, and even terror-struck, too, if he had only
known what had really happened.</p>

<p>Jane, knowing her sister's timid disposition, had told her
nothing of Larose's intention to come in and open the safe. So,
it had been <i>she</i> who had opened the front door directly it
had become dark and closed it again, as arranged with Larose,
after eleven o'clock. Then, passing a worried and wakeful night,
she had heard her master moving about very early that morning
and, later, giving himself a bath.</p>

<p>Unable to explain his getting up so early and uneasy as to
what he had been doing in the study, without waking her sister,
she had crept downstairs while Hardacre was in the bathroom to
see if anything about the house looked as if it had been
disturbed. Then almost the first thing her eyes had fallen upon
in the study had been the silver match-box and, having once seen
Larose light a cigarette with it, she had instantly recognized
it as his. She had snatched it up and, creeping back to bed,
hidden it under her pillow. Later, she had had difficulty in
suppressing a good laugh when her sister told her of the hard
questioning she had been put through by her master.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. &mdash; THE PERIL OF LAROSE.</h2>

<p class="first">THE ensuing few days were most unpleasant ones
for the one-time trader of Hoichow. He was allowing his temper
to get the better of him, and it was upsetting him both mentally
and physically. He had an almost constant headache and was
sleeping very badly.</p>

<p>He was furious with Larose and it galled him most intensely
that he could think of no way of punishing him. That the ex-detective
was interfering in his affairs there could now be not
the slightest doubt, though what was causing him to do so he
could not for the life of him make out. He was not worrying,
however, that Larose could have found out anything, for he was
supremely confident, no matter what the latter was suspecting,
he would not be able to bring anything home to him. It was his
insolent interference he was resenting so keenly and, added to
that, his colossal impudence in breaking into the house and
taking that money from the safe.</p>

<p>Why, the fellow was nothing but a common thief and yet there
he was going about a country gentleman of the best repute,
mixing with the best society people and, apparently, held in
esteem by everyone! The devil of it was he, Hardacre, could not
make any move against him. He dare not even inform the police he
had been robbed, for that would mean them coming to question the
servants and then, damnation, he did not know what they might
find out. The maids might so easily come to mention about Harold
Smith having recently been an inmate of the Manor and, giving a
description of him, it might be realized it tallied with that of
the man whose body someone had made out he had dug up from under
the sand in the shed.</p>

<p>That would be most dangerous, as it would at once focus
attention upon him. The police would be bound to think it more
than a coincidence that he had rushed a very sick boy away under
most peculiar circumstances, and then that this boy's body was
later alleged to have been seen, buried upon property rented by
him.</p>

<p>Another thing, too, was angering him. Time was going on and
he was not making the slightest headway with Dorothy Bannister.
On the contrary, a distinct barrier seemed to have risen up
between them and, with Larose apparently now having become
friendly with the girl, things might go on to be much worse.</p>

<p>Hardacre cursed his own foolishness here. Most probably he
had made a mistake about the girl. He had not gone after her in
the right way. Women, at bottom, were all the same. They liked
to meet their master and he should have dealt with her as he had
dealt with Winna Mee. No nonsense, but just taking things for
granted, and she would quickly have come round. He ought to have
kissed her long ago. Well, he would lose no more time now. He
was sick of all this church-going and pretending respect for her
silly old father and lending him money and listening to his
prosy rotten stories. Yes, he would catch the girl alone;
perhaps one day when she was arranging the altar flowers in the
church, and straightaway put things to the test.</p>

<p>Then he remembered it was the Rector's "at home" day that
afternoon and, although he detested tea-parties, he made up his
mind to be present and dominate everyone there with his
personality, as he was sure he would be able to do. Probably,
there would be only some frowsy old women calling, and perhaps a
few rheumatically worn-out old men. So he would shine among them
as one quite out of the ordinary and make the girl realize she
should be flattered by his attention to her.</p>

<p>His confident mood prevailed all that morning, but it got a
bit of a jar when, driving into the Rectory grounds about four
o'clock, he recognized Larose's car, along with two others, in
the drive. Apart from what he considered its big and vulgar
silver kangaroo mascot, there could never be any mistake about
the Carmel Abbey car. It was of such a peculiar sky-blue colour,
with silver mountings and, whenever fine, winter and summer,
Larose always drove it with the hood down.</p>

<p>Hardacre cursed deeply and for the moment was half inclined
to turn back and go away. What was the damned policeman doing
there? He had never known him visit the Rectory before and
neither the father nor daughter had ever mentioned his name.
Well, he, Hardacre, was not going to sit down in the same room
with him. He would&mdash;he would, oh, damn it, he would go in
and just bluff him out. He would play the game, too, and not let
him, Larose, dream he knew what a thieving blackguard he
was.</p>

<p>So it was the usual self-possessed and smiling gentleman who
was ushered by the parlour-maid into the Rectory drawing-room.
There were about a dozen people present and, among them sitting
next to Larose, he saw a good-looking and distinguished woman
whom he knew at once from what he had heard about her must be
Mrs. Larose. He was introduced to everyone he did not know, and
gave them a grave but smiling bow.</p>

<p>"So glad you've come, sir," nodded the Rector smilingly.
"We've just been talking about you and Mr. Larose was saying he
must have been causing you considerable financial loss,
lately."</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed Hardacre, cursing, how true it was and yet so
aghast at the ex-detective's bare-faced effrontery that he could
hardly get out his words, "and pray in what way?"</p>

<p>"Well, I only meant," smiled Larose, "that, not having been
to the club lately, I've not had to write you any nice fat
cheques for my losses at poker. I was telling them here that
I've not fancied myself nearly so much as a poker player since I
met you."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it, is it?" frowned Hardacre. He forced his face
to a grim smile. "Still, all the same I should say you are
always at your best whenever there is any money about."</p>

<p>Larose felt himself getting red. He was uncertain as to
whether it was just a casual remark or a pointed reference to
his having married a wealthy widow. He was hesitating what to
say when the Rector broke in pompously. "But gambling in any
form is wrong, it is unsocial and leads to many crimes,
still"&mdash;his face broke into a smile&mdash;"in this
particular case I am almost inclined to condone it, as our
friend here"&mdash;he indicated Hardacre&mdash;"contributes so
liberally to the church funds."</p>

<p>Everyone laughed and Hardacre felt pleased that he'd made
Larose look uncomfortable. A moment later, however, he could
with difficulty suppress a vicious scowl as he saw Larose take
out a cigarette and proceed to light it with a wax vesta which
he abstracted from a gold match-box. "Damn him," he swore under
his breath, "and I expect he treated himself to that out of the
money he stole from me, the thieving brute!"</p>

<p>For a few minutes the conversation became general, but
Hardacre contented himself with watching Dorothy flitting about,
and thinking what a nice morsel she would make when he could get
hold of her alone. Then it suddenly came to him that she was
avoiding him and, even with all those people present, was
keeping as far away from him as possible. When he spoke to her,
too, he was sure she purposely avoided looking at him more than
she could help and then her expression was a grave one.</p>

<p>Damn her, she had been put against him, he was certain, and
of course, the only person who would have done it had been
Larose! A black rage surged up into his heart as he realized how
pointedly she was neglecting him and hovering all the time round
Larose and his wife.</p>

<p>Presently a short break in the general conversation ensued
and then an old gentleman remarked: "But I say, Mr. Larose,
what's this I hear about a wager you've made with Colonel
Maitland that you'll bring down more birds than he at Lord
Ivor's shoot this week?"</p>

<p>"It's quite true," smiled Larose. "We're shooting at Ivor
Park the day after to-morrow, and I've bet the Colonel a tenner,
to go to the Burnham Cottage Hospital whoever has to pay, that
my bag is bigger than his. We're shooting from ten to four and
we'll toss for choice of positions."</p>

<p>"Let me see," went on the other. "Ivor Park is close to your
place, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen miles by the main road from Carmel Abbey," replied
Larose, "but by going through Holkham village and cutting
through a by-road from there it knocks off a good three. The by-road
brings me out only a couple of hundred yards or so from my
own gates."</p>

<p>A dreadful thought surged instantly through Hardacre's mind.
A lonely by-road and it would be dark when Larose was returning
from the shoot! Then it might be possible to put a bullet in him
as he was coming home! It was worth thinking about, for he,
Hardacre, was willing now to take almost any risk to prevent him
doing any further mischief. He would shoot him with no more
compunction than he would a mad dog.</p>

<p>That night, he pored for a long while over a big Ordnance map
of Norfolk until he was certain he had worked out the exact way
Larose would come. Passing, as he had said he would do, through
Holkham village, there seemed to be only one by-road Larose
could take and that, to Hardacre's great satisfaction, appeared
to be a lonely one with no village and only a few scattered
farmhouses near.</p>

<p>The weather, too, should be most favourable, for it looked as
if it would continue to be fine and settled. It would be quite
dark as Larose would be coming along, but with a half-moon
rising at four o'clock and with Larose driving, as he always did
in fine weather, with the hood down, he should present an easy
target.</p>

<p>There was only one possible snag. Larose always drove at a
fast pace and it might not be possible to get him with the first
shot. That, however, was most essential, for the .303 rifle he,
Hardacre, was intending to use made considerable noise and,
while one report would leave anyone who heard it in some doubt
as to which direction it had come from, two or more reports
would make them quite certain and add to the risk of his getting
away unseen.</p>

<p>Still, he would go over the ground thoroughly the next day
and pick out not only the most favourable spot for an ambush but
also where to hide away his own car while he was stalking his
quarry.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next morning he made his way to Holkham
village and picked out the by-road along which Larose would
come. There was no difficulty there, for only one road from the
village ran in the direction of Carmel Abbey. It was nearly four
miles in length and, narrow and winding, would not be able to be
negotiated with safety at a great speed. As he had gathered from
his study of the map the preceding evening, the road was very
lonely and there were not a dozen habitations along its whole
length.</p>

<p>Driving slowly along it, and scrutinizing hard on either side
to determine where he could best hold up his intended victim, an
exultant smile came into his face when he thought he had found
the very spot he wanted. It was a shallow cutting running
through a small hill, and at the end of the cutting there was a
sharp bend, almost of a hairpin nature. Any approaching car
would have to slow down almost to a walking pace to negotiate
the bend in safety.</p>

<p>Stopping his car and getting out, he climbed up the bank.
There was a small plantation of trees at the top and, crouching
down among them, he would be out of sight of anyone coming along
the road. The only drawback was, and he frowned here, there was
a small farmhouse about three hundred yards away, but he saw no
dogs about and there were no men at work in the surrounding
fields.</p>

<p>His next move was to find a place where he would be able to
hide his car, and there again he was favoured, for less than a
quarter of a mile farther up the road he came upon a disused
gravel pit. If he drove right in, his car would be out of sight
of anyone passing along the road.</p>

<p>Quite satisfied that he had got everything as he wanted it,
he returned home to await with what patience he could the coming
of the following day. One thing only he was regretting, and that
was he would have to part with his good rifle, at any rate for
the time being. Still, he had picked out a likely spot where he
could bury it under some leaves and, wrapped well round with an
old mackintosh, he was thinking it would come to no harm for a
month or two. Then he would be able to recover it again when all
search for the killer of the ex-detective would have died
down.</p>

<p>The following evening, just when dusk had fallen, he took up
his position among the trees above the bank of the cutting. He
seated himself down comfortably with his back against a tree. He
had got his rifle upon his knees and a good pair of binoculars
upon the ground by his side. He reckoned he would have plenty of
warning of the car's approach, as he would be able to pick up
the headlights upon a stretch of higher ground about a couple of
miles away.</p>

<p>He was pleased that he did not feel in the slightest degree
nervous and, a sure shot, he had no misgiving that he would not
be able to get Larose with one bullet. He was in such a
favourable position that he could wait until Larose was
absolutely level with him and then shoot him in the head. It
would be only a matter of ten yards or so and he could not
possibly miss. He would fire lying prone and his hands would be
steady as a rock.</p>

<p>The evening was fine and cold and with a nip of frost in the
air. Everything stood out as clear as day. There were no sounds
coming from the direction of the farmhouse behind him and he was
almost thinking it must be uninhabited until, turning round to
look, he saw a light in one of the windows. He frowned uneasily,
but then, after a moment's thought, told himself it didn't
matter, as two minutes after he had done with Larose he would be
well on his way to the gravel pit where he had left his car, and
five minutes after that would be driving quickly away.</p>

<p>Half an hour went by, an hour, and he began to feel stiff and
chilled. He cursed, as he knew it might mean a bout of malaria
for him. Then he sneezed violently and in the stillness all
around him it sounded like a veritable explosion.</p>

<p>Then almost immediately he saw a faint light in the sky far
away in the direction he was expecting Larose to come and
guessed at once it was that of his car. He picked up the
binoculars and focused them carefully upon the stretch of road
where he would first catch sight of the car.</p>

<p>It appeared quickly and one glance told him it was that of
Larose. As he had been expecting he would, the latter was
driving with the hood down. He stretched himself prone and,
cocking the rifle, got it in the exact position he wanted.
Certainly it would be an easy shot, for the car would have to be
going so very slowly in order to take the turn.</p>

<p>The car momentarily disappeared from view on the lower
stretch of road, but he could hear it plainly now, and he
moistened his lips in anticipation.</p>

<p>What a fine revenge it would be to shoot the blackguard so
near to his very home! No doubt his purse-proud, red-haired wife
would be waiting for him, looking forward to hearing how he had
got on with the pheasants. Of course, there would be a
comfortable fire burning in the lounge, and in the kitchen a
nice dinner would be in preparation. Perhaps the butler would
already have brought up a bottle of that fine old Burgundy for
which the Carmel Abbey cellars were so famed, in order that it
might be at just the correct temperature to be served with the
meal.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, Larose's children would be waiting to greet
their father and, even now, be listening for the sound of his
car coming up the drive. A pretty domestic picture, he sneered,
and he was going to spoil it all! The car would be brought home
blood-bespattered over the driver's seat, the children would
never see their father alive again, the dinner would never be
eaten and the red-haired woman would go a widow to her lonely
bed that night!</p>

<p>The car came into view a couple of hundred yards or so away.
It was already beginning to slow down, for the master of Carmel
Abbey was known to be a careful driver and sparing with his
brakes. Yes, it was Larose sure enough and, proud of his
hardiness, he was driving as usual without a hat. He was smoking
a cigar, all unmindful that he was within a few seconds of a
bloody death.</p>

<p>Only a hundred yards away, fifty now, and the car was almost
at a crawl. Hardacre could even see Larose knock the ashes off
his cigar over the side of the car.</p>

<p>With a brain as cold as ice and with hands perfectly steady,
Hardacre pointed the rifle and prepared to press the trigger the
split second when Larose drew level.</p>

<p>Then it was as if the hand of God gripped him, or a
thunderbolt came hurtling out of the sky. Everything underwent a
most startling change and a curtain, black as night, fell
between him and the man he was intending to murder.</p>

<p>He heard a savage snarl behind him, a heavy weight impinged
upon his back, his right arm was tugged away and he felt sharp
teeth biting into the flesh. It was so sudden that he was bereft
even of an oath. His rifle slid out of his hands, he rolled on
to his side, and, as his arm was let go, he realized a big
snarling beast was muzzling for his throat.</p>

<p>He awoke fiercely to self-protection and, striking wildly at
the animal, struggled to rise to his feet.</p>

<p>Then he heard a harsh voice shouting. "Come off, you brute,"
it roared. "Come off, I tell you," and he rose shakily to find
himself confronted by three men, one of whom was tugging at the
collar of a big dog.</p>

<p>For a few moments he was too dazed to take in what had
happened, but the smarting of his bitten arm went a long way
towards bringing him to his senses, and he started to swear
savagely at the man he presumed to be the owner of the dog.</p>

<p>"Damn you," he shouted, "what do you mean by setting that dog
on to me? I'm badly bitten and I'll have the law on you." He
made a move to pick up his rifle. "I'll shoot the brute."</p>

<p>But the man pushed him roughly away. "No you don't, my fine
fellow. We'll have none of that. You leave that gun of yours
alone or we'll give you the father of a thrashing before handing
you over to the police." He nodded darkly. "You're up to no good
here. We've been watching you for quite a long time."</p>

<p>The man lied here, as his panting breath might have told
Hardacre had the latter been in a state to be more observant. He
had only just run up, and how it had happened that he and his
men had arrived so unexpectedly upon the scene had come about in
this way.</p>

<p>When Hardacre had sneezed he had had an audience. A few
minutes previously the farmer's small son had crept up with his
air rifle to a rabbit burrow just beyond the clump of trees
where Hardacre was lying in wait. He was hoping to shoot a
rabbit, and sitting perfectly still, was waiting for one to
appear. He was as unconscious of Hardacre's proximity as
Hardacre was unconscious of his. Then to his consternation he
had heard someone sneeze close by him and, turning round, to his
terror had seen the figure of a man among the trees. He had
scuttled back like lightning to the house and told his father.
Thereupon, taking his two men with him and accompanied by their
dog, the little party had raced off to the plantation to find
out what the trespasser was doing there. The dog had already
tackled Hardacre when they came up, and they were just too late
to notice Larose and his car disappear round the bend in the
road. Convinced that the stranger had come after the pheasants,
the farmer was now regarding him with menacing eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, you've come poaching," he went on sternly, "and we've
caught you right enough. What have you got to say?"</p>

<p>Hardacre was now himself again and, though furious that
Larose had escaped him, yet was collected enough to realize he
was in an awkward situation. He was prepared to bluff it
out.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," he exclaimed angrily. "That's a rifle and
not a shot-gun. What would I come shooting for with a heavy
rifle like that? Why, it would be heard miles away! I was out
for a stroll and just sitting down here for a rest."</p>

<p>"Where do you come from," demanded the farmer, "and who are
you? You don't belong to these parts!"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," retorted Hardacre. "And as to who I am and
where I come from, that's nothing to do with you."</p>

<p>"But you were trespassing," scowled the farmer. "You've no
business to be on my land."</p>

<p>Hardacre shrugged his shoulders contemptuously. "But what
harm have I done?" he asked. "What damage have I caused?" His
arm hurt him and he went on angrily: "It would serve you right
if I shot your dog."</p>

<p>The farmer picked up the rifle. "Gosh, it's at full cock!" he
exclaimed. He eyed Hardacre most suspiciously. "What does that
mean?"</p>

<p>"I saw a fox on the road," explained Hardacre calmly, "and,
if you hadn't interfered, in another minute would have got rid
of a pest for you and probably saved some of your fowls."</p>

<p>The farmer let down the trigger carefully and, backing away
from Hardacre, proceeded to empty the contents of the magazine
methodically on to the ground. Then he tossed the rifle towards
Hardacre. "There you are," he said scornfully. "Take it and get
off quick. I don't believe a word you say, but Boxer's given you
a good fright and I'll have to be content with that. Go on, get
off, or I'll set the dog on to you again."</p>

<p>Hardacre ground his teeth with rage, and with the rifle as a
weapon in his hands, for the moment was half inclined to put up
a fight, but, with the dog straining to get at him and the
farmer and his men all burly-looking fellows, he thought better
of it, and with an oath turned and walked down on to the
road.</p>

<p>The three men watched him out of sight and then with a
chuckle the farmer picked up the binoculars which he had,
purposely, let him go without. "A nice little souvenir," he
remarked as he noticed with satisfaction what a good pair they
were, "and I'll bet any money he won't dare to come back to
claim them." He nodded to one of the men. "Pick up those
cartridges, Jim, and make sure you get every one. We don't want
him to come sneaking round and putting a bullet into Boxer for
that bite he gave him." He shook his head frowningly. "But I'd
give a couple of pounds to know what that fine gentleman was
waiting here for. It's quite beyond me."</p>

<p>In the meantime, all unconscious of the dreadful fate he had
so narrowly escaped, Larose proceeded blithely home. As his
would-be murderer had gloatingly surmised, his handsome red-haired
wife was waiting with a smile and a kiss for him, and his
children were all ready to run to the door when they heard his
car approaching. There were the bright fire and the good dinner,
too. The only thing where Hardacre was wrong was about what
Larose drank at the meal. It was not Burgundy, but champagne,
for he had won his bet about the pheasants and beaten Colonel
Maitland by a brace and a half. It had been such an exciting win
that Larose thought a bottle of sparkling wine was quite
justified under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Just when the meal was ending the butler came in to say
Larose was wanted on the phone. "A trunk call from London, sir,"
he added. "And the gentleman says the matter is urgent."</p>

<p>It was Inspector Stone speaking from Scotland Yard, and he
asked sharply: "Well, Gilbert, have you finished that little
matter you were investigating?"</p>

<p>"Now don't be sarcastic, Charlie," laughed Larose. "Of course
I haven't, or I'd have come up to you at once. I've marked down
my bird right enough, but I daren't shoot because I've not got a
good enough cartridge in my gun. To be frank with you, I'm at a
bit of a dead end."</p>

<p>"Well, you come up and see me at once," commented Stone, "and
I think together we'll be able to make the feathers fly." He
spoke reprovingly. "The trouble with you, Gilbert, always has
been that you're too cocky and want to do everything on your
own. If you were a little bit more humble it would be better for
everyone. Now, can you come up to-morrow?"</p>

<p>Larose pretended to sigh. "All right, Grandpapa. I suppose I
must if you want me. Yes, I'll be with you at twelve o'clock,
and we'll go out to lunch together."</p>

<p>The following morning the Inspector was all ready waiting,
and he unburdened himself with what was on his mind without any
preliminary. "Now that man Hatherleigh," he asked, "whom you
suspect of something, and about whom you got us to make some
inquiries at his hotel, is he a man who always thinks he's
someone important and goes about with a grand frown? Oh, that's
pretty like him, is it?" He picked up a paper from his desk and,
glancing down at it, went on: "And he's a tall, big fellow,
dark-complexioned and drives a dark green limousine?"</p>

<p>"That's the man," nodded Larose. "What do you know about
him?"</p>

<p>Stone looked very grim. "Only that on Saturday, August the
nineteenth last, the day before Dr. Monk was shot, a man of that
description and in a car of that colour pulled up in the road
about half a mile from Hickling Broad and asked two young women
who were blackberrying close by if they could tell him where the
doctor lived. So, undoubtedly, he was the man spying out the
land that afternoon and the killer of the next day."</p>

<p>"Good God," exclaimed Larose, his face aghast, "when did you
learn that?"</p>

<p>"Only yesterday morning," replied Stone solemnly, "and I
spoke to the girls in the afternoon. They seem very reliable
witnesses and are sure they will be able to recognize him again.
They happen to remember him distinctly because they say he is
exactly like one of the foremen in the factory where they work.
They declare he might be his own brother and, in fact, for the
moment, thought it was the foreman himself, decked up in fine
clothes."</p>

<p>"But why on earth haven't they come forward before?" asked
Larose. "To-day is October the twenty-eighth, and from August
the nineteenth practically ten weeks have gone by."</p>

<p>Stone looked glum. "The two are Norfolk girls and sisters
working in Poplar, and last August they were home upon a
holiday, not a mile from Hickling Broad. Their holiday ended the
next day, on the Sunday, and they came back to Town. They didn't
read the newspapers and they say they didn't hear of the murder
until nearly a month later when their mother happened to write
to them and refer to it in her letter. Then, they didn't think
it important enough to mention to anyone about the man who had
questioned them. But last week one of them went to the pictures
with a Poplar policeman with whom she has lately become friendly
and, seeing a murder upon the screen, she mentioned casually
about the murder of the doctor in Norfolk and told about the man
who had been inquiring where he lived. The policeman told his
super and the super rang me at once. Within a couple of hours I
had got in touch with the girls." He eyed Larose anxiously. "Now
does it help on matters at all?"</p>

<p>"Help on matters!" exclaimed Larose, drawing a deep breath.
"Why, goodness gracious, I should think it does! It will clinch
everything if we can prove this Hatherleigh was the man who was
looking over Dr. Monk's fence that Saturday afternoon." He
smiled exultantly. "Now, you just listen to me, Charlie. I'll
tell you an extraordinary tale," and then, to the amazed and
profoundly interested Inspector, he proceeded to relate all he
had found out about Hatherleigh from the day the latter had
first consulted Dr. Monk, to his, Larose's, seeing the bottle of
potassium iodide tablets in the safe.</p>

<p>"Gad, it's almost an epic," exclaimed Stone enthusiastically
when he had finished, "even among the many good jobs you've
done. Now if we can get these two girls to identify the man we
can have a warrant issued at once." He raised his hand
warningly. "One moment, though. Let's think if there's any link
missing in the chain as it affects Dr. Monk." He checked off the
points on his fingers. "A&mdash;you've seen the tablets this
Hardacre has been getting from that Regent Street chemist on and
off for two years, and the chemist has told you the prescription
was given by Dr. Monk; B&mdash;you have found out from the
doctor's case-books that he certified Hardacre as a leper and
that the latter bolted to escape segregation; C&mdash;you can
prove that the doctor and Hardacre were both present at that
garden party and that the consequences would have been very
grave for the latter if the doctor had recognized him;
D&mdash;then I hope to prove that Hardacre was the man who went
spying over the fence of the doctor's house that Saturday
afternoon; and E&mdash;we all know the doctor was killed the
next night by an individual who climbed the fence at exactly the
same spot." He nodded as if quite satisfied. "Good, then, once
these two girls have identified him as the man who spoke to them
on that Saturday, we have a strong case and are justified in
arresting him at once." He frowned. "But where can these girls
see him when he won't see them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's easy," said Larose. "He's almost sure to go to
his club in Norwich this afternoon and they can be watching for
him to come out about half-past six. We can get them there in
plenty of time."</p>

<p>So, at six o'clock the two girls were waiting in two separate
cars parked in the street within good view of the entrance to
the Norwich Club. They were purposely being kept apart from each
other so that they should each recognize Hardacre separately and
with no prompting from the other. Larose was quite confident
they would pick him out at once, for he had seen the factory
foreman whom they had said resembled him and had been astonished
at the likeness. The foreman was exactly of the same build, dark
complexion and shape of face, and might easily have passed for
Hardacre's own brother.</p>

<p>Larose was keeping well out of the way, about a couple of
hundred yards up the street. He would, however, be able to see
Hardacre come out of the club, and when the cars containing the
girls had moved off would follow them to the police station
where they were going to be taken.</p>

<p>Everything went off satisfactorily. Just after half-past six
Hardacre came down the steps of the club along with two other
members. They stood chatting for a minute or so on the pavement
and then separated, but not before the cars containing the girls
had driven off. The recognition had been instantaneous.</p>

<p>A consultation was held at the police station and it was
arranged to arrest Hardacre about eight o'clock. He would then
be having his dinner and not likely to have any automatic near
him. Stone himself, accompanied by two plain-clothes men, was to
effect the arrest, and Larose impressed upon him he would be
dealing with a desperate man.</p>

<p>"You must rush him," he said, "and not give him the slightest
warning. Go round the back and through the kitchen. You're sure
to find the door open. Then go straight up the passage into the
lounge, and the dining-room is the second door on the left.
Here, I'll draw you a rough plan, so that you can't make any
mistake."</p>

<p>The Chief Constable of Norfolk was present at the
consultation and very relieved that all responsibility for the
arrest was being taken by Scotland Yard. A man of rather
stubborn disposition where his own opinions were concerned, he
was still not certain a ghastly mistake was not being made. He
had spoken to Hardacre only that very afternoon and could not
bring himself to believe he was the callous murderer Larose was
making him out to be. He was the more inclined to this view
because he was resenting the interference of Larose. The latter
was always irritating him with his confident assurance of
believing he could find out things where others couldn't.
Certainly he did not deny the one-time detective's undoubted
ability, but he thought him much too theatrical and believed he
was always looking for effect. He was remembering now with a
secret chuckle the thud Larose had come when, with the audience
gathered round him, he had failed to produce any body in that
shed.</p>

<p>It was fated, however, that the Chief Constable was to come a
nasty thud himself and that at the very moment when Larose was
present to be a witness of it, for while the consultation
between Larose and the detectives was still in progress a
sergeant of police came in and announced that his superior was
wanted on the phone.</p>

<p>"A call from Methwold, sir," he whispered, "and they say it's
very urgent."</p>

<p>The Chief Constable was gone five minutes and then he
returned to the room and approached Larose with a wry smile upon
his face. "Here's something to interest you, Mr. Larose," he
said. "A message has just come through from Methwold. A man who
has been spearing eels in one of the drains there this afternoon
brought in a body which he had dragged up in a sack. The body is
very decomposed, but there are all signs it has not been in the
drain very long."</p>

<p>Larose showed no elation. He just nodded to Inspector Stone
and remarked grimly: "Gad, how all the tricks are falling to us
all at once!"</p>

<p>In the meantime, all unconscious of the dreadful forces which
were gathering against him, Hardacre had returned home in an
unpleasant frame of mind. Several things were upsetting him. He
was still raging furiously over his misadventure of the previous
evening and his arm was very sore where the dog had bitten him.
Then, too, the valuable binoculars he had left behind him were a
dead loss of nearly £40, for he realized it would be far too
dangerous for him to go back and claim them. When anything
happened to Larose, later, and he was still determined to put a
bullet through him, it would never do for the farmer to have
seen him, Hardacre, by daylight, remembering the suspicious
circumstances under which they had met at night.</p>

<p>Added to these grievances there was the minor one that that
afternoon luck at the club had been all against him, and he had
dropped more than £20. He was the more annoyed there because he
had been bluffed by an innocent and meek-looking little
solicitor, whom he would have never dreamed had got a bluff in
him.</p>

<p>He was just about to sit down to dinner when the telephone
rang and the house-parlourmaid came in to say the Rector wanted
to speak to him.</p>

<p>"Curse the old fool," he muttered under his breath. "How he
ever came to have a daughter like Dorothy I can't imagine! His
wife must have had a lover, of course."</p>

<p>He went scowlingly to the phone and it was a good thing the
Rector could not see his face. "Hullo, Hatherleigh, my boy, is
that you?" called out the reverend gentleman. "Well, I've just
rung the Lord Bishop and he says he'll be over to give us a
sermon on Sunday and I thought you'd like to meet him. Of
course, he'll be staying to lunch and Dorothy is sure you'd like
to join us. It was her suggestion."</p>

<p>The latter statement was pure fabrication on the Rector's
part and none guessed it better than Hardacre. Still he mumbled
his thanks and then the Rector went on:</p>

<p>"Oh, a most singular thing happened just now and, though I
expect I oughtn't to mention it, I feel I must tell you. When I
was trying to get through to his lordship my wire crossed
someone else's, that belonging to the police, I imagine. I think
it was two policemen talking to each other, and what do you
think I heard? Of course, I know I oughtn't to have listened but
I was so amazed that I had to. You'll be amazed, too, when I
tell you they've caught the murderer of Dr. Monk."</p>

<p>Hardacre's heart gave a fearful bump. "What," he ejaculated,
"they've caught the man who killed him?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly caught him yet," went on the Rector, "but
they know who he is and they're going to arrest him to-night, in
fact in a few minutes. It seems Dr. Monk knew some dreadful
secret about this man and he was expecting he would tell the
police. So he shot him before he had time to speak. Yes, and our
friend, Mr. Larose, has had something to do with putting the
police on to this man. He's been watching him for weeks and his
real name's Hardacre. I gathered he is in hiding not far from
Norwich. Oh, and they suspect him of another murder, too!
They've hooked up some body somewhere in a sack. Don't tell
anyone I told you. Then, I shall expect to see you at lunch on
Sunday. Good night."</p>

<p>Hardacre hung up the receiver and literally gasped for
breath. There was a dreadful pain over his heart and he thought
he was going to faint. His agony of mind was too great even for
an oath.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest doubt of it! They had found out
everything and he would hang for certain! There would be no
loophole through which he would be able to escape! Then his fury
against Larose seemed to make the blood course more freely
through his arteries again and something of his courage came
back.</p>

<p>No, they should not take him alive and he would not die
without a dreadful vengeance upon those who came to take him!
There were six cartridges in his automatic and he would ambush
the police when they arrived and shoot them down like dogs! He
would have the advantage of surprise and if there were five of
them then five of them would die. Oh, if Larose were only among
them, what a triumph it would be!</p>

<p>The last cartridge he would keep for himself, and he would
not mind dying, as death would give him a release from all his
cares.</p>

<p>With firm and steady steps and with all trace of the
threatened collapse gone, he strode into the library and took
his automatic out of the safe. He made sure it was fully loaded
and then, switching off the study lights, opened the big french
window and crept out into the drive. He was minded to take up
his position behind a thick rhododendron shrub and open fire
instantly if more than one person approached.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful, moonlit night and he drew in deep breaths
of the invigorating air. Then, suddenly, like a mighty wave, the
love of life surged through him and he asked himself why should
he die. The very thought came to him as a revelation. Yes, why
should he not try to escape? He could always shoot himself if he
were cornered. He had always that last card to play, but why
play it before it was absolutely necessary?</p>

<p>He thought like lightning. His car had been oiled and greased
and his tank filled that very afternoon in Norwich. With any
luck he would catch the midnight boat from Harwich and, once in
Rotterdam, he knew a man there who would be sure to befriend
him. This man had been a customer of his for many years and was
under a great obligation to him. Once, in Hoichow, he had got
him out of an ugly scrape when he had killed a native in a
drunken brawl, and the man had been most grateful to him in
consequence.</p>

<p>In an instant he had made up his mind, and he darted over to
the garage. Then he stopped dead in his tracks. Hell, he had no
money upon him or in the house, at any rate less than two
pounds! Like a damnation fool he had paid that twenty odd pounds
he had lost at the club that afternoon in good Treasury notes.
Hell again, how vital they would have been to him now!</p>

<p>Then, as in a flash of lightning, he remembered the money he
had inadvertently left in the pocket of that old leather jacket
he had hidden under the flooring of the Old Mill. There was more
than £20 in the wallet and he would go and get it. It would not
be much out of his way in his rush to Harwich.</p>

<p>Then he took a risk, but he reckoned it was a good one. He
ran back into the house and into the kitchen. "See here," he
said quite quietly to the cook, "keep back my dinner for a
little while. I've left something very important behind at a
house I called at on my way home and I must go and get it. I
expect I shall be back pretty quickly," and in two minutes he
was passing out of the drive. He met no one and shot across the
main road into a by one, confident now that at any rate for the
time being he was safe from pursuit.</p>

<p>As it happened, he had got away in plenty of time, for it was
not until nearly half an hour later that the servants of the
Manor were startled by the unceremonious appearance of Inspector
Stone, accompanied by three plain-clothes detectives, in the
kitchen. The Inspector had not thought there was any occasion
for urgent haste and, as neither he nor his men had had anything
to eat since early morning, they had stopped in Norwich to
snatch a quick meal.</p>

<p>They had entered the kitchen very quietly and the Inspector
immediately held up a warning hand.</p>

<p>"Hush," he exclaimed, "don't make any noise! We're police and
we want a word with your master. Where is he? We'll go straight
to him."</p>

<p>"But he's not in, sir," gasped the very frightened Jane.
"He's gone out for a few minutes. We expect him back any moment
and we're keeping his dinner hot for him."</p>

<p>"Then where's he gone?" grunted Stone, disappointed but in no
wise suspicious.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir," replied the cook. "He said he'd
forgotten something at a friend's and he'd be back very
soon."</p>

<p>"How long since he went?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"Only a few minutes, sir, about twenty, I should say."</p>

<p>"Did he seem in a hurry when he went? I mean, did he go off
in unusual haste?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir, he seemed in no hurry at all. He just came and
spoke to us and then we heard him get out his car."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Stone, "we'll wait here and neither
of you young ladies are to leave the kitchen. We shall be
hearing his car, shan't we, as it comes in?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, it goes right by this window to the
garage."</p>

<p>So the Inspector and his men sat down and made themselves
comfortable. They took out cigarettes and chatted good-naturedly
with the girls. Half an hour going by, however, Stone began to
get uneasy.</p>

<p>"Here, I say," he asked of the cook, "what did your master do
when he came in? Tell me exactly."</p>

<p>"He went up to the bathroom and had a wash, sir, and was just
sitting down to dinner when he had to answer a call on the
phone."</p>

<p>Stone pricked up his cars at once. "Answer a call on the
phone!" he exclaimed. "Who was it speaking?"</p>

<p>"The Reverend Bannister, our Rector, sir," replied Jane. "I
went to the phone first, and then went and fetched the
master."</p>

<p>"Are you sure it was the Rector?" demanded Stone sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, he often rings up and I know his voice very
well."</p>

<p>The Inspector rose instantly to his feet. "Where's the phone
and what's his number?" he asked, and he put through a call with
no delay. A man's voice came from the other end. "Are you Mr.
Bannister?" asked Stone. "Well, I've been waiting here some time
to speak to Mr. Hatherleigh. He's gone out and not come in. I
understand he spoke to you just before he went out. Did you ring
up to call him away? Oh, you didn't! Well, what did you ring up
about? It's important I should know."</p>

<p>There was a note of authority in the Inspector's tones and
the Rector, by nature a timid man, had no thought of declining
to give the information demanded.</p>

<p>"I rang up to ask him to come to lunch with us on Sunday," he
replied. "Our bishop is going to be here and I thought he'd like
to meet him."</p>

<p>"And did he say he'd come?" grunted Stone.</p>

<p>"Certainly! He seemed very pleased to."</p>

<p>"You didn't talk of anything else?" demanded Stone.</p>

<p>The Rector's conscience pricked him and he felt suddenly most
uneasy at the peremptory questioning of this stern-voiced man.
He prevaricated. "I tell you," he replied, "I simply rang up to
ask him to come to lunch on Sunday. That was all."</p>

<p>Stone grunted again and hung up the receiver, but he had soon
got it down for the second time and was ringing up the Chief
Constable in Norwich. "See here, sir," he said. "I don't like
the look of things here too much. Our bird came home all right,
but went out suddenly in his car again, just when he should have
been sitting down to his meal, and he's not come back. He told
the servants he would only be away a few minutes, but he's been
gone now longer than an hour. I think it would be wisest to send
out a call for all the main roads to be watched and his car
stopped if it's seen. You know what it's like. All right, sir.
Thank you. The precaution may be quite unnecessary but we can't
be too careful with a man like this."</p>

<p>The call, however, went out too late, for Hardacre had by
then, after passing through Ipswich, left the main road and was
deep among the little by ones leading to the Old Mill. The
weather had changed and he ran into a sharp shower.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. &mdash; THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD.</h2>

<p class="first">BUT we must now go back to Tom Werrick, the
brother of the dead ex-convict. The little boot-repairer had
been in grim earnest when he had told Larose he believed in
ghosts and the raising of the spirits of the dead. In his early
boyhood days he had been brought up by an aunt who, when not
suffering from the effects of undue alcoholic refreshment, had
had her pious moments and, accordingly, had seen to it that Tom
said his prayers and attended Sunday School when the one and
only decent suit he possessed did not happen to be in pawn.</p>

<p>So Tom had learnt a lot of interesting and intriguing things.
He knew all about Moses making the Egyptian cows come out in
boils, what a lot of wives King Solomon had had, and how forty
and two little children had been eaten by she-bears for giving
sauce to the prophet Elisha and calling him an old bald-head.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, however, it was always the story of the
Witch of Endor which had impressed him most. He had never
forgotten how the good lady had recalled the spirit of poor
Samuel from the dead and let it have quite a long talk with Saul
about some things that wicked gentleman so much wanted to know.
Then, Tom argued, and who will dare to say he was not quite
logical, that if such things happened in olden times, why
shouldn't they happen now? He was sure that, if they only knew
it, some people <i>did</i> possess these seemingly miraculous
powers and, that being so, it was only right and proper they
should use them when necessity required. A great believer in
Fate, too, he was certain he would one day come face to face
with his brother's murderer and, to be ready for anything which
might then happen, he had bought a cheap pistol at a second-hand
shop near the Docks, with a box and a few cartridges all
complete.</p>

<p>So day after day he waited hopefully for the coming into his
little shop of the particular man of whom he had heard it stated
that he <i>did</i> possess this unusual power and whom he
already knew as a casual customer of his.</p>

<p>He was certain that the man would come eventually, and sure
enough, one day he did, and Tom learnt his name was Sleeker and
that he lived and worked quite close near him.</p>

<p>Christopher Sleeker, or Professor Sleeker as he liked to be
called, could hardly have been said even by his greatest
admirers to be anything like a professor to look at. He was
always shabbily dressed and his shoes were nearly always down at
the heels. Out of business hours he wore a very faded and shiny
black frock coat, his trousers were baggy and he sported a large
one-time Trilby-shaped hat. To complete his attire, his tie was
always of a most violent red colour or, indeed, it had been so
upon the day of its purchase and before his dirty fingers had
imparted to it a somewhat sombre hue. His hands, with the
fingers well engrained in printer's ink, seldom looked as if
they had been washed lately. When times were flourishing he
smelt of spirits all day long, being then a good patron of the
several public houses in the neighbourhood where he lived.</p>

<p>For occupation and means of acquiring wealth, he ran a small
two-roomed printing business in a little shop in Commercial Road
East, and he described himself as a master printer. His
speciality was handbills and he would not only print them but,
if need be, provide the reading matter as well. Indeed, he had
acquired quite a local reputation in that way, and if any
shopkeeper had a line of cheaply-bought damaged goods to get rid
of, then the Apollo Printing Works was the place to go to have
it boosted up. Very ordinary articles then became extraordinary
ones of an amazing quality and value, and urgent advice was
proffered that even one single hour's delay might entail
disastrous consequences and snatch from the would-be purchaser
his golden opportunity. Quite small places of business, too,
were described as departmental stores or emporiums.</p>

<p>A bachelor in the late thirties, Sleeker prided himself upon
being what he called an intellectual. He had read a little, had
got the gift of the gab and was quite a plausible fellow.
Undoubtedly he was clever in a limited sort of way, but a
student of physiognomy would have said that, as his expression
was such a cunning one, he was not a man to be trusted very far,
and in his dealings would probably always cheat whenever he
could.</p>

<p>In his busy and energetic life Sleeker had pursued many
activities in his spare time and managed to make most of them
profitable ones. He had been a Christian Scientist, a Natural
Healer by the laying on of hands, a reader of the stars, a
crystal gazer and, when he met people credulous enough to
believe him, just a common or garden fortune-teller. Also, he
was quite a passable ventriloquist and could throw a good
stomach voice.</p>

<p>Upon several occasions the police had tried to bring him to
book, but he had always been too clever for them and they had
never been able to lay any definite charge against him. They had
never been able to catch him with his crystal upon him, and a
greasy pack of well-thumbed cards in one of his side-pockets had
been no evidence of any misdemeanour which would entail
unpleasant consequences in a court of law.</p>

<p>Of late years, however, Sleeker had been trying to flap his
wings in higher spheres and, as he believed, had at last found
an ideal setting for his imaginative powers and persuasive form
of address. He had become a spiritualist, and one of such zeal
and ardour that he had eventually convinced himself he had all
the qualities necessary to blossom out as one of the world's
most famous mediums.</p>

<p>To his great disappointment, however, in the better-class
spiritualist circles he was everywhere frowned upon and given
the cold shoulder. The "heads" had no liking for such a
seedy-looking individual who, to put it mildly, could not always be
said to be strictly sober. Added to that, they were of opinion
that, if the need arose, he would never be above resorting to
trickery.</p>

<p>So it ended in Sleeker forming a little East End coterie of
his own where more tolerant views of alcohol were held and
where, with such intellectual gifts as he possessed, he could be
something of a big fish swimming in a small pool.</p>

<p>To some extent Sleeker honestly believed that, as he
progressed upwards upon the spiritualistic way, he really
<i>would</i> be able to call up spirits from the dead. As he
impressed upon his admirers, he felt great powers developing in
him and was gradually obtaining a mastery in the occult world.
Given the right subjects to work upon, he was sure he would be
able to raise not only the spirits of those dear to them but
also those of the illustrious dead from all down the ages.</p>

<p>So in a room above a fried fish shop belonging to a brother
spiritualist, when business was over below and the fish and
chips were sold, seances were held, with Sleeker, of course, as
the star performer. The one second in importance was Cookson,
the proprietor of the shop. This latter, though undoubtedly
overawed by Sleeker's adroitness and gifts of language in any
discussion, was inclined to be very jealous of him. As with
Sleeker, he was part believer and part cheat, and in this latter
role was always agreeable, upon Sleeker's instructions, to help
him with the many little tricks resorted to to make the seances
a success. Indeed, it paid him to do so, as he shared equally
with Sleeker in the silver collection which always followed the
seances.</p>

<p>Usually the seances were well attended, for, in some form or
other, Sleeker always managed to deliver the goods. Rappings and
strange noises would come from nowhere, the table would sway
sideways and bob up and down, heads would feel currents of air
fanning them, as if the spirits were moving round, and hoarse
whispering would be heard. Sometimes, indeed, if Sleeker were
quite sure he had got the right audience, faint voices would
come announcing that they were "dear mother," "sister Mary" or
"brother John" and, spirit-wise, were present in the room.</p>

<p>Even if the results were scrappy and scant information was
forthcoming as to what the deceased relations were doing in the
spirit world, the whole business was thrilling to believers, and
the subsequent collection for Sleeker's honorarium and Cookson's
expenses was never begrudged.</p>

<p>This, then, was the man who walked into Tom Werrick's little
shop one afternoon and plumped down upon the counter the pair of
very dirty and almost worn-out shoes he had been carrying,
unwrapped, through the streets.</p>

<p>"Soles and heels," he announced with a majestic air, "and
make a good job of them. No mouldy leather like you put in last
time. I've hardly worn these shoes at all, and look at the
rotten state they're in. Must have them back to-morrow. What'll
the damage be?"</p>

<p>It was a few moments before Tom could speak. He was overcome
in his excitement and his heart was fluttering like a bird's.
This&mdash;this was the man he had been waiting for so
anxiously, the man who could raise spirits from the dead!</p>

<p>"Three bob," he mumbled at last in a shaking voice, but then,
seeing a scowl upon his customer's face and anxious above all
things to propitiate him, he added quickly: "At least that's my
usual charge."</p>

<p>"Robbery!" commented Sleeker angrily. "Absolute extortion! A
couple of bob is all I'll pay or I'll take them somewhere else,"
and he made a movement as if to pick up the shoes.</p>

<p>"Here, wait a moment!" called out Tom quickly. "Don't go. I
might be willing to do 'em for less." He moistened his lips with
his tongue and went on: "Aren't you the gent who can talk with
blokes who are dead?"</p>

<p>Sleeker gave him a hard glare. He sensed ridicule in the way
the question had been put and was about to make a biting retort
when Tom went on quickly: "I mean, you can make dead people come
into a dark room and speak."</p>

<p>Sleeker's face relaxed. The boot-repairer was so palpably
nervous that he obviously had not been intending to sneer. He
looked an ignorant man and a very simple-minded one too. He,
Sleeker, liked dealing with people of that class, for there was
often something to be got out of them. So he nodded grandly.
"You mean, of course, do I conduct spiritualistic seances?" He
spoke very solemnly. "Yes, I do."</p>

<p>Tom was at once all eagerness. "Then could I come to one one
night?" he asked. "I want to see what you do. Oh, I would pay
all right! I don't expect to come for nothing."</p>

<p>Sleeker scented profit. He threw a covert glance upon the
little stock of boots and shoes upon the bench waiting to be
repaired, making the mental comment that business must be
brisk.</p>

<p>"Not expect to come for nothing!" he frowned. He spoke very
sternly. "I shouldn't think you would, indeed! Seances cost
money and are a terrible mental strain to me." He eyed Tom
intently. "Do you mean you want to join our society?"</p>

<p>"If I might," said Tom humbly. "I should like to join if I
could."</p>

<p>Sleeker pretended to look doubtful. "We're very particular,
you know. Our society is very select." He raised his voice
declaimingly. "We don't admit doubters and scoffers. We won't
have anyone who sneers at the eternal truths."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not a scoffer," exclaimed Tom earnestly. "I want to
learn. I tell you I have a special reason. I'll be as earnest as
anybody."</p>

<p>"You've lost someone dear to you," queried Sleeker gravely,
"and you want to hear him speak again? You honestly believe you
will be able to? Good, then you're the sort of man we want!" He
appeared to consider for quite a long moment and then spoke in a
more friendly tone. "Yes, I dare say you can join us. In fact,
I'll propose you myself and see that the election goes through."
He coughed. "Entrance fee ten shillings, subscription another
five, and you can pay me now and become a member straightaway.
I'm both secretary and treasurer."</p>

<p>The money was at once handed over and Tom was greatly
thrilled when Sleeker added: "And, by Jove, you're lucky. We're
meeting above Cookson's Fish Restaurant in Snook Street to-night,
and there'll be the usual silver collection afterwards.
You pay what you can afford. Most people put in two shillings.
Time, eleven-fifteen. We choose that hour because the nearer
midnight the more likely the spirits are to gather. They are not
so responsive earlier."</p>

<p>Preparing to leave the shop, he nodded in the direction of
his dirty shoes. "And I dare say," he said, "you would like to
throw in the repair of those for my getting you elected at
once."</p>

<p>The delighted Tom at once expressed his willingness. "And
I'll sew the uppers, too," he said, regarding the dilapidated
footwear with a critical professional air, "and make a good job
of them, so that the stitches won't be giving out soon."</p>

<p>"Thank you," smiled Sleeker, "and I'm sure you won't regret
having joined us. We are very earnest, all of us, and get
remarkable results sometimes." Then he added as he was going
out: "But don't mention anything about yourself to the other
members or tell them where you live. Don't tell them, either,
how long you've known me. Private matters are disturbing when
we're moving in the spirit world. Oh, and one thing more! I'm
known as Professor Sleeker to the society and they always
address me as such. So you might, please, do it, too."</p>

<p>Fingering over with pleasurable anticipation the crisp
ten-shilling note and rattling together the pieces of silver Tom had
given him, the professor walked jauntily along, intending to
make his next port of call "The Eagle" public house. "Properly
handled," he smiled to himself, "there'll be quite a nice little
bit of sugar for me in that chap. But I must keep him to myself.
If Cookson gets hold of him he'll skin him for all he's worth."
He frowned. "Still, I'll have to get Cookson to help me to-night,
and, of course, he'll expect a bob or two out of it. He'll want
his little whack."</p>

<p>That night Sleeker went early to the place of meeting and
buttonholed the proprietor of the fried fish shop before any of
the other members of the society had arrived.</p>

<p>"Look here, Cooky," he said, with a great affectation of
friendliness, "I'm introducing a new chap to-night and, of
course, we must give him a little encouragement to start off
with. So you'll have to flap the cloth and do the whistling
pretty good."</p>

<p>Cookson was a big, coarse man with big ears and a large
florid face. Year in and year out, sleeping and waking, he smelt
of fish, and the oil in which he fried the carcasses of these
denizens of the deep was always generously bespattered upon his
clothing. As with Sleeker in spiritualistic matters, he was half
believer and half cheat. He was certain there was "something in
it," although at the same time he was always willing to help on
results with little trickeries and deceits. Wearing an upper set
of false teeth and, with the plate fitting very badly, he could
let it fall down on to his tongue and over the top of it emit a
fierce sibilant sound which nervous people, who had never heard
one, imagined must be like the hiss of a snake. This hiss came
in very handy at the seances.</p>

<p>His estimation of Sleeker was two-sided. Undoubtedly
impressed by the superior education and nimble mind of the
inky-fingered printer, he firmly believed Sleeker <i>did</i>
possess spiritualistic powers and actually <i>did</i> see some of
the forms he declared he did when they were seated round the table
in the darkness. At the same time, however, he was not inclined
to trust Sleeker too far in his private capacity, being quite
sure that as the treasurer he juggled with the society's
accounts, even small and insignificant as they were.</p>

<p>Now he eyed his colleague with a dark look. "Yuss, and by
gosh," he commented scowlingly, "I'll count the collection, too,
afore you divide it up. Last time I'm certain I never got my
proper dollop. I know there was more than fifteen and six in the
bag."</p>

<p>Sleeker gave him a disdainful look. "There wasn't," he said
sharply. "Fifteen and a tanner was all there was and you got
your proper seven and ninepence, every penny of your share."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll count the collection with you to-night," nodded
Cookson rudely, "and make sure there's no mistake." He went on
grumblingly: "Anyhow, tarnation, man, I ought to get more than
half, paying as I do for the damned room and the lighting and
the fires, to say nothing of the help I give you."</p>

<p>"But only think of the strain it is on me, Cooky," said
Sleeker in a conciliatory tone. "I feel a complete wreck the
next morning, and, of course"&mdash;he spoke
impressively&mdash;"the few mean bob I get here don't compensate
me half enough. Why, I often get three guineas for acting as a
medium when I'm up in the West End!"</p>

<p>"Then buy a new suit," scoffed Cookson coarsely, "and I'll
believe you. I've never seen you out of this one since I've
known you."</p>

<p>Sleeker thought it wisest to ignore the rudeness and, though
they were the only ones in the room, dropped his voice to an
intense whisper. "Now I'll tell you what I want you to do, and
if you do it properly it's quite likely old Mrs. Faggarty will
push a half note into the bag. She came to see me yesterday and
sobbed how desperately anxious she was to see her sailor son. I
shall do my utmost to make him come and believe I shall be able
to, for my body is all of a quiver and that means I am psychic
to-night."</p>

<p>Cookson was duly impressed, as he always was when Sleeker
used words he, Cookson, couldn't spell and, accordingly,
listened intently to Sleeker's instructions. The latter was
determined that the seance should be a success and, with that
end in view, had been making certain inquiries about Mrs.
Faggarty's son which he did not intend Cookson or anyone else
should know. He had found out that the boy had been twenty-two
when he died, had had red hair, a scar upon his forehead and had
been drowned in a storm off the African coast. Also that the boy
had had a good voice and could sing well.</p>

<p>Members began to dribble in and Tom, appearing all decked out
in his best clothes, which always made him feel very nervous,
was introduced all round.</p>

<p>"Another seeker after truth," announced Sleeker solemnly,
"and we must do the best for him we can. We should have a good
seance to-night for the elements are propitious. There is a
storm brewing and I think there is thunder in the air."</p>

<p>After a few minutes, to give time for any late members to
arrive, Sleeker locked the door and announced that the seance
had begun. There were nineteen persons present, twelve women and
seven men and, in varying degrees of excitement, they seated
themselves round the table. They were told to clasp one
another's hands, spread out upon the table. In that way everyone
could be assured they would all be remaining in their seats and
not moving about the room.</p>

<p>Following the usual procedure, Sleeker indicated where
everyone should be placed, he taking his own seat between
Cookson and an elderly, stout woman. On the other side of
Cookson was a shy and timid little man who worked in a tailor's
shop by day. This arrangement was ideal as far as Sleeker and
Cookson were concerned, making it easy for either of them to
leave their seats whenever they wanted to, for they knew the
stout woman always perspired freely in her excitement and would
be continually taking a hand off the table to mop her face.
Also, the small man was so nervous that he would often be
spasmodically unclasping his hands. So, when need be, it would
happen the woman would be clutching to Cookson's hand instead of
Sleeker's and the small man Sleeker's instead of Cookson's.</p>

<p>Just before the lights were turned out, Sleeker made his
usual short speech. He enjoined them all to remain in perfect
quietness and not to speak whatever happened. Also, they were to
help him by concentrating deeply upon the particular person
whose spirit they desired to summon back to earth. He promised
nothing, but said everything was possible. They might feel the
spirits moving in the air above them and, perhaps, might hear
the loved ones speak, even they might see their shadowy forms.
On the other hand he, Sleeker, might be the only one actually to
see the spirit, because long years of meditation had brought to
him powers which it was not given to many to possess. In
conclusion he insisted there must be no coughing and everyone
was to breathe quietly.</p>

<p>The lights were then extinguished and the seance began. For
many minutes nothing happened, just the blackness and the
stillness and the awed and dreadful waiting for the spirits to
appear.</p>

<p>Tom literally shook with nervousness. It was as if a master
hand was leading him to the very verge of the dark and
unfathomable abyss which lay between the dead and living worlds.
He felt as if his little soul was struggling to leave his body
so that it might mingle with the ghosts of those who had gone
before. He thought of his brother Jim and shivered.</p>

<p>Presently, when Sleeker considered the silence had gone on
long enough and everyone's nerves were sufficiently strung up,
he announced in a hoarse whisper that certain spirits were now
present in the room. Whereupon Cookson, who had stealthily left
his seat and was tiptoeing about minus slippers and in very
dirty socks, proceeded to wave a damp cloth vigorously to and
fro, so that distinct currents of air could be felt all round.
Then gentle rappings came on the windows and there were sounds
of scraping upon the wall. Then came Cookson's famous hissing
over his loose false teeth. It came spasmodically, rising and
falling, dying away and then coming again.</p>

<p>The disturbances went on for quite a long while and they were
all very awe-inspiring, but the great thrill came when Sleeker
announced in a dreadful whisper that he could see a vague form
hovering above them all.</p>

<p>"It takes shape!" he breathed. "It takes shape! It is that of
a man, a very young man! It has red hair and there is a scar on
its forehead. It has&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My boy, my boy," wailed Mrs. Faggarty, breaking into tears,
"it is my Arthur! Oh, Arthur, speak to me! Your mother is
here!"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush," warned Sleeker sternly, "or the spirit will
fade and disappear." He spoke from deep down in his stomach and
a voice came as from far away. "I am at peace, my mother. I am
happy now. I sing in the heavenly choir. I will come and speak
to you and you shall see me in your dreams."</p>

<p>Mrs. Faggarty was almost choking in her emotion and it was a
couple of minutes or so before she could restrain her sobs. Then
silence once more descended upon the shabby room above the
fish-shop until Sleeker announced suddenly and hissingly that the
spirits were gathering again, and a ghostly vapour beginning to
take shape.</p>

<p>But it was no common or ordinary sailor-boy who was visiting
them this time, for as the form and features of the spirit
became plain to him, Sleeker gasped and hesitated and then
gasped again. "It is a woman!" he choked. "She is old and stern
and has a commanding presence! Yes, yes, I recognize her! I
recognize her! She is Queen Victoria!"</p>

<p>A fierce thrill of exultation surged through the humble men
and women seated there. They were in the presence of royalty and
it was overwhelming to them that the spirit of the great queen
had come among them. Cookson was working at his hardest with the
damp cloth and they could distinctly feel those chilling airs
which they had been told always shrouded the spirits of the
dead.</p>

<p>Sleeker tried to induce the great queen to speak, but he
could get nothing from her and he said she just looked at him
with grave and solemn eyes before she faded away.</p>

<p>It was different, however, with the next spirit who came from
the other world. He arrived after a long period of waiting when
nothing had happened except that the table had rocked violently
and there had been several bouts of Cookson's dreadful hiss.
Then, suddenly, Sleeker announced that more spirit vapour was
taking definite shape, and Cookson worked more vigorously than
ever with the wet cloth to provide the chilling air.</p>

<p>"It is a man!" whispered Sleeker, and there was a note of
fear in his tones. "I do not know him! He has a white and evil
face! It is drawn and thin and the eyes are staring! He holds
his head in a peculiar crooked way! Don't let him hear you
breathing and I may be able to get him to tell us who he is.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Sleeker sternly. "I command you to
speak."</p>

<p>"I-am-a-sinner," very slowly came a deep sepulchral voice,
"and I cannot rest. I am Wilkins, the Hoxton murderer. I killed
my wife and I was hanged for my wicked crime."</p>

<p>In spite of Sleeker's admonition that they should make no
sound, gasps from some of the spiritualists were distinctly
heard. Who did not know of the Hoxton murderer who had cut his
wife's throat and buried her in the chicken run?</p>

<p>"Why do you return to earth?" demanded Sleeker and there was
now both loathing and horror in his tones.</p>

<p>"Because I am condemned to wander," replied the spirit in
great sadness. "Down all eternity I shall know no peace. I shall
wander, wander&mdash;&mdash;" But the voice died away and once
again silence filled the room.</p>

<p>Five minutes and more passed and then Sleeker called out
weakly: "Unclasp your hands. The seance is over. I can stand no
more. Mr. Cookson, put on the lights, please."</p>

<p>The lights went up and, when everyone had finished blinking
their eyes, a buzz of conversation ensued. The seance had
certainly been a magnificent success, for Mrs. Faggarty was
plaintively emphatic that she had seen her son quite plainly. He
had looked at her lovingly and smiled his old sweet smile. The
nervous little tailor, too, stated he had seen Queen Victoria
most clearly, and said she looked exactly as she used to when
driving in processions through the streets. He had recognized
her at once, quite as quickly as Sleeker had done.</p>

<p>Sleeker was delighted and was more than ever convinced he had
certainly got "something in him," for if he did not actually see
the spirits himself he was capable of making others see
them.</p>

<p>Cookson then brought in servings of fish and chips on pieces
of paper on a tray, at sixpence a head and all who wanted to
partook of the delicacy without fuss or bother and using fingers
instead of knives and forks. Altogether, everyone was happy and
satisfied when they passed out through the fish shop at nearly
two o'clock in the morning. Cookson had stood close to Sleeker's
elbow when the money in the little collection bag had been
turned out upon the table and he had given his colleague a hard
and ugly look when the coins were seen to total up to twenty-eight
and sixpence.</p>

<p>"Wot I expected," he remarked coarsely as he grabbed at his
share, "and I've been a ruddy goat not to have thought of
counting it with you before."</p>

<p>Sleeker did not condescend to make any reply and, passing out
into the street, found Tom waiting for him on the pavement.</p>

<p>Tom suggested nervously that he would like him to bring round
his crystal one night to his, Tom's, back room and gaze in it
for him. He wanted to know if a brother of his were still
alive.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Sleeker, "I'll come with pleasure." He
spoke in a business-like manner. "But it'll cost you ten bob."
Then, when Tom agreed so readily, he added quickly: "With
another half-dollar for the use of the crystal. They wear out
quickly with the hard gazes I give them."</p>

<p>Tom said he'd pay it and Sleeker nodded. "All right then,
tomorrow night at eight o'clock. Leave the shop door unlatched,
so that I can hop in quickly. Crystal gazing is against the law
and one can never be certain when the damned police are not
about." He spoke grandly. "I am a marked man, you know."</p>

<p>Tom was thrilled to his very marrow. Truly he was moving in
dark and wonderful circles!</p>

<p>Sleeker duly appeared the following night, but not before he
had made a few discreet inquiries about Tom and his brother.
From a greengrocer near by he had learnt that Tom's brother was
called Jim and had "done time." He was very like Tom in
appearance, but a regular devil in disposition. Then the man in
the milkshop in the next street had supplied the further
information that Jim had always been in fights and a regular
nuisance to the neighbours. Everyone had been glad when the cops
had got him for knifing and robbing a man in a dark street. He
was a blooming little thug, the milk vendor said, and as ready
with a knife as a butcher cutting up chops. He had got seven
years.</p>

<p>Fortified with these details of the little boot-repairer's
relation, Sleeker was confident the crystal gazing would be a
great success and, when he took out his glass ball, wrapped in a
little square of black velvet, from a dirty pocket handkerchief,
Tom shivered thrillingly, and thought so, too.</p>

<p>"It's like this, Professor Sleeker," he explained. "My
brother Jim and me were great pals and thought a deal of each
other. He said good-bye to me in this very room one morning a
year ago last August. He was going down to work for a poultry
man in Essex and promised to write to me in two or three days.
But he's never wrote to me and he's never come back. I've never
heard anything of him since and I'm sure something's happened to
him."</p>

<p>"But didn't you write to this poultry-farmer?" asked Sleeker,
wanting to get as much information as possible out of Tom.</p>

<p>Tom shook his head. "No, but I did more than that. I went
down to where Jim had gone and found the house was all shut up."
He shivered. "It was a dreadful, lonely place." And then he
related to the highly interested Sleeker all that had happened,
only keeping back the real reason why Jim had gone down to the
Old Mill and all mention of any hidden bank-notes.</p>

<p>Realizing he had got plenty to work upon, Sleeker proceeded
at once to business. He lit the two pieces of candle he had
brought with him and made Tom turn out the other light. Then he
placed the glass ball upon the square of black velvet draped
over an inverted tea-cup and put the two lighted candles on
either side. In that position the ball was level with the candle
lights.</p>

<p>"Now not a sound," he whispered. "We'll both gaze intently at
the crystal and you must concentrate all your thoughts upon your
brother. Then I'll tell you what I see."</p>

<p>A long silence ensued and, hardly daring to breathe, Tom
stared at the glass ball and thought hard of Jim. He thought of
him when they had been boys together, when they had become grown
men, and how he had looked when they last said good-bye. Then he
could not help it that his thoughts harked back to when he had
seen Jim in his convict clothes. He had gone to the prison every
visiting day when he had been allowed.</p>

<p>The minutes went on and on and then, as in a dream, he heard
Sleeker speaking in a low hushed tone. "I see," he whispered, "a
small dark man with a narrow face. He is pale and sad and his
hair is closely cropped. He is strangely clothed and he is in a
bare stone room. The room is very small. He is looking straight
before him and he sighs."</p>

<p>Tom almost choked. That was poor Jim in prison! He was in his
lonely cell! Oh, how wonderful this crystal was!</p>

<p>Sleeker droned on. "I see him in a big square yard with many
other men, all clothed as strangely, too! The yard has high
walls and the men walk round and round, with officers in
uniforms and holding rifles, standing by! This man does not
speak and he never smiles!"</p>

<p>Sleeker stopped speaking and Tom's thoughts ran on. He tried
to picture Jim down at the Old Mill, Jim among all the
buttercups and daisies in the fields of those hot August days
when he had first gone into the country, and then, as if in
answer to his thoughts, the crystal-gazer spoke again. "I see
this man once more. He is sitting by a stream."</p>

<p>Tom started violently. How wonderful! How wonderful! He had
said nothing to Sleeker about a stream. Sleeker, however, knew
that a mill would have a stream, and was putting down his cards
accordingly.</p>

<p>"He is sitting by a stream," went on Sleeker, "and he is
looking into the water. He is differently clothed now and is
happy and smiling. I see&mdash;I see, ah, but the crystal is
getting blurred. A mist is rising and the man fades away."</p>

<p>Another long silence followed, a hard tense silence with the
sweat bursting out on Tom's forehead. He was in agony for what
would come next.</p>

<p>At last Sleeker heaved a deep sigh and spoke in his ordinary
tone of voice. "That is all I can tell you. The crystal will
give us no more to-night."</p>

<p>"But what do you think?" asked Tom shakily.</p>

<p>Sleeker thought quite a lot. There was cash for him in a dead
man but nothing in one who was alive. Besides, from all Tom had
told him he felt sure the brother was no longer living. He gave
his opinion without a moment's hesitation.</p>

<p>"I think," he said gravely, "I think that your brother is
dead. The crystal would not have gone off like that if he had
been alive. It would not have stopped so suddenly."</p>

<p>"I knew it, I knew it," choked Tom. "I have been sure of it
all along." He spoke pleadingly. "But can't you raise his ghost
and get it to lead us to where he is buried? We might get his
murderer hanged, then."</p>

<p>"You mean the poultry-farmer?" queried Sleeker. "But do you
know where he is now?"</p>

<p>"No, but the police would find him if we discovered Jim's
body," replied Tom. "As I told you, they wouldn't trouble to
look for this poultry man before, because they had nothing
against him." He pleaded again: "Couldn't you try to raise my
brother's ghost?"</p>

<p>Sleeker considered for a long moment. Of course the little
boot-repairer had got a little bit of money tucked away
somewhere, and there was no reason why he, Sleeker, should not
touch some of it.</p>

<p>"I might," he said thoughtfully, "but it would cost money,
you know. I should have to go down there with you to where he
was last seen and that would mean taking me away from very
important work. Yes, it would cost a few quid."</p>

<p>"And I'll pay them," said Tom eagerly. "The place is only
about sixty miles from London and about four miles from
Thorrington, the nearest railway station. We can easily walk
that little way and I'll give you&mdash;say four pounds."</p>

<p>Sleeker felt a warm glow of satisfaction surge through him,
but pretended to consider again. "Not enough," he said
emphatically, "as I should have to be away a night." He nodded.
"Still, make it a fiver and I'll come."</p>

<p>So ultimately it was arranged they should go down together to
the Old Mill on the following Friday, with Tom to give Sleeker
five pounds, thirty shillings at once on account, and pay all
expenses. "There'll be no one in the house," added Tom, "and, if
I take one of my boot knives with me, I'll be able to slip back
the bolt of one of the windows and we can get inside. Then we'll
be quite comfortable and light a fire if it's cold. The house is
miles from anywhere and no one will see us." He was thrilled at
the prospect of the adventure and went on excitedly: "Yes, and
if you raise the ghost and it takes us to the grave, I'll spring
another fiver for you."</p>

<p>The following Friday afternoon, just before it began to get
dusk, they arrived at the Old Mill. Tom was carrying a good-sized
basket of provisions, with a box of candles, and Sleeker a
bottle of whisky. The whisky had come out of "expenses" as
Sleeker had insisted he must have a little stimulant for the
exhausting work of raising a ghost.</p>

<p>"A devilish nasty-looking place," he remarked, taking in the
desolate nature of the surroundings, "and I'm not sure I don't
smell murder, already." Then, suddenly, he caught sight of the
mill stream and whistled in amazement. "Gosh," he exclaimed,
with his eyes pretending to bulge almost out of their sockets,
"why, that's the very stream I saw in the crystal!" He pointed
with a shaking hand. "Look, look, that's the spot where I saw
your brother sitting, just by that clump of willows."</p>

<p>Tom shook and shivered too. "You must be right," he choked.
"I never told you about any stream and yet the glass ball showed
you one was there."</p>

<p>Sleeker winked grinningly to himself and then, returning to
practical matters, said they must get in the house before it got
quite dark, and make all preparations for the night. He went on:
"You'll have to leave me alone for a couple of hours, too, after
we've had some grub, as I must do some hard concentration before
starting to raise the ghost." He nodded darkly. "I shall
concentrate not only on your brother, but on his murderer, too.
It is possible&mdash;it is possible, I may be able to compel him
to come back here to the scene of his crime." He spoke with the
utmost reverence. "There are endless possibilities of what may
happen when you move in the spirit world."</p>

<p>Tom was too overcome with awe to speak, but he clutched
tightly to the little pistol he had got in his pocket. He would
make the murderer confess everything, he told himself, if only
the murderer came.</p>

<p>As Tom had surmised, they were able to get into the house
without any difficulty. It smelt damp and musty and they
disturbed quite a lot of rats as they went through the rooms.
"Of course no one's come here for months and months," whispered
Sleeker. "The local people must know it's haunted and they are
afraid to come." He noted the old sofa in the kitchen and,
thinking it would be all right for a good snooze, ordered Tom to
make a fire to warm up the room. "This is where I'll
concentrate," he said, "and I must on no account get chilled or
my mind will not be able to work."</p>

<p>They saw there was plenty of oil in the glass container of a
big lamp in the kitchen and Sleeker ordered Tom to light it, at
once, but as the window-blind was torn and ragged and the
lamplight would show much farther than the candles, Tom did not
want to take the risk. However, Sleeker insisted and Tom gave
in, comforting himself with the thought that the window did not
look out on the village but only on long stretches of
uninhabited marshland.</p>

<p>Tom was feeling too nervous to eat anything, but Sleeker made
a hearty meal, consuming a good half of the two pounds of corned
beef they had brought with them and more than half of the loaf.
He washed it all down with several stiff doses of the whisky.
Then he announced he must be left alone and, accordingly, Tom
retired to another room, with the arrangement that the
ghost-raiser was not to be disturbed until ten o'clock.</p>

<p>A couple of hours went by with poor Tom all the while sitting
fidgeting upon an uncomfortable broken chair, staring out into
the darkness and full of wondering as to what was going to
happen soon. He had a most implicit faith in Sleeker and
believed it was quite possible, as the latter had said, that the
murderer might even now be being drawn as by a magnet to the
scene of his dreadful crime. If he <i>did</i> come, then he,
Tom, would recognize him instantly. Had not Mr. Larose said he
was tall and big and dark and handsome, with bushy eyebrows, and
his lips kept tightly closed? Did he not drive, too, a big green
car with a horse on the radiator?</p>

<p>Anyhow, Tom felt quite certain that the ghost would walk, and
that they would be led to where his brother's body had been
buried. He had no doubts, knowing how hard and long Sleeker was
concentrating now.</p>

<p>In his simple, trusting mind, Tom did not for a moment dream
that, fatigued by his long walk from the station, and comforted
and soothed by his big meal and plenty of whisky, all Sleeker
was then doing in the adjoining room was just having a nice
sleep. The world is full of such men as Sleeker and Tom, and it
is natural that the one should prey upon the other. Down all the
ages it has been destined that such things should be.</p>

<p>At last, wearied of his inaction and seeing that the moon had
now come out from behind the clouds and was making things as
light as day, Tom thought he would go and look about inside the
mill. He was curious to see if it was in exactly the same state
as it had been when he was last there. He had noted when they
had arrived those few hours ago that the door was gaping wide
open.</p>

<p>So, letting himself out of the house very quietly in order
not to disturb his companion's concentration, he tiptoed across
the yard and entered the mill.</p>

<p>And at that same moment the grocer of Great Bromley was
reporting to the village constable there that someone was in the
Old Mill house as, returning from a late round, he had seen a
light in one of the windows.</p>

<p>Inside the mill Tom flashed his little torch round and rats
scuttled off in all directions. The place was in a state of
dreadful desolation, with the wainscoting all torn from the
walls and the flooring covered almost ankle deep in the debris
of the hundreds of sacks which had been gnawed by the rats into
little pieces.</p>

<p>"And Jim helped to pull down that wainscoting," sighed Tom,
"and every minute of the searching brought him nearer to his
dreadful death. He told his secret to that evil man and in
return the man killed him."</p>

<p>He sat down on one of several empty barrels there and,
closing his eyes, for a long time tried to visualize his brother
moving about. Jim would have been so energetic and so full of
hope. He would have been so unsuspecting, too, because, if they
found the money, it was such a large sum and surely enough for
two to share. But poor Jim had been struck down, perhaps at the
very moment of their success, and his murderer had thought he
was quite safe when he had hidden the body. Still, he hadn't
been safe, his punishment had only been delayed and
now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But a sudden sound fell upon Tom's ears and he jerked up his
head sharply, first in bewilderment and then in consternation. A
motor car was somewhere about, and oh, oh, it was coming
nearer!</p>

<p>For a few moments he sat on, stock-still in his terror, and
then he sprang to his feet and darted up the steep steps of the
ladder leading to the loft. From the little window there he
would be able to see the car as it passed round the house. But,
with the car coming into view, it did not pass round. Instead,
it pulled up by the mill, right opposite the window. In the
bright moonlight everything was as plain as day and Tom's knees
shook under him as he saw the car had got a silver horse upon
the radiator and that the driver who jumped out of it so quickly
was big and tall and dark.</p>

<p>He sank down on to the floor of the loft, almost fainting in
his emotion. It was the murderer of his brother and he had been
drawn irresistibly to the scene of his crime!</p>

<p>But Tom had not been the only one to hear the car. Sleeker
had heard it as it broke through a heavy dream and, for the
moment, he thought he was back in Commercial Road. He could not,
however, understand why it was he had not got the splitting
headache which he should have had when he had gone to bed, as he
undoubtedly had done, too fuddled to take off his clothes or
even his shoes. Then, opening his eyes, he realized he had not
been, as he thought, drunk the night before. He saw the lamp
burning and a strange room and, in a flash, realized where he
was.</p>

<p>Hell, then what was a car doing here! It might be the owner
had arrived or&mdash;horrible thought&mdash;the police! He
sprang off the sofa and, darting along the passage, made for the
best way of escape, the back door.</p>

<p>Yet a third and fourth party had heard the car, and these
last, as well as Tom, had seen it. They were the village
constable and the grocer who was accompanying him to find out
what the light in the window of the house meant.</p>

<p>Hardacre, for of course the man in the car was he, ran into
the mill in frenzied haste. His eyes were blood-shot and,
panting like the hunted animal he knew he was, he began
furiously to clear the floor in the corner where he remembered
his hiding-place was. He did not see the ghastly and frightened
face, glaring down at him from the top of the ladder in the loft
above. Almost at once he found the particular board he wanted
and started to prise it up with his knife. The board, however,
was sticking tightly and the blade of his knife broke off sharp
at the handle. He cursed savagely. Precious moments were flying,
but he must go back to the car and get something stronger, like
a screw-driver, to raise up the board. He raced out of the mill
as quickly as he had come in.</p>

<p>A minute later there was the sharp crack of a pistol, and
Constable Bone and the grocer came round the corner to see
Hardacre, with an upraised pistol in his hand, only a few yards
from a writhing figure upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Hands up!" roared the constable and he sprang forward with
his truncheon ready. Terror, however, had robbed Hardacre of all
judgement and, turning quick as lightning, he jerked up his arm
and fired point-blank at the new-comer. But his hand was shaking
so terribly that his first two shots missed altogether. Then the
third plugged a bullet in the fleshy part of the grocer's arm
and the latter, sure that he was mortally wounded, emitted a
fearful yell and dropped on to the ground.</p>

<p>The constable, however, had smelt cordite upon many a
battlefield in the Great War and charged boldly on to get to
close quarters. Right at the menacing point of the pistol he got
in a fearful blow at Hardacre's head and the latter went down
like a stunned ox.</p>

<p>A piercing cry came from the direction of the mill. "Hold
him, hold him, Mr. Bone," shrieked Tom, tottering forward with
badly shaking legs to help hold Hardacre down. "He murdered my
poor brother."</p>

<p>No help, however, was required, for Hardacre lay all huddled
up and still, and so attention was at once turned to the
palpitating figure on the ground. It was Sleeker and he was
coughing violently and struggling hard for breath. With each
cough he brought up copious bloody froth. He had been shot
through the neck, with the bullet going in one side and coming
out through the other. He was bleeding internally and the blood,
pouring into his lungs, was suffocating him. The end came very
quickly. His eyes grew fixed and glazed, his jaw dropped, he
heaved one long bubbling sigh and he was dead.</p>

<p>So passed into his eternal sleep the crafty crystal-gazer,
the man who could raise spirits from the dead. One minute strong
and lusty and filled with the love of life, and the next&mdash;a
poor wraith in that dark world with whose mysteries he had so
often juggled in blasphemies and deceits.</p>

<p>The constable turned pantingly to Tom. "Who are you," he
demanded in fierce tones, "and how do you come to know my name?"
His eyes opened very wide. "The devil, you are that chap Werrick
who came to see me about your missing brother!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Bone," said Tom meekly. He pointed tremblingly to
the dead Sleeker. "And that's a man who came here with me this
afternoon. He's called Sleeker and he was going to help me find
my brother's grave."</p>

<p>"And this fellow," demanded the constable, indicating
Hardacre, "who is he?"</p>

<p>"I don't know his name," began Tom falteringly, "but
he's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The grocer broke in excitedly. He had found out he was not
dead and was now sitting up, clasping tightly to his injured
arm. "I know who he is," he shouted. "He's that poultry-farmer
who used to live here. He's that man Holt, Mr. Bone."</p>

<p>The constable whistled. "God, what a mix up!" He nodded
grimly in the direction of Sleeker. "Well, he'll hang for that
chap, now. That's a sure thing."</p>

<p>He became practical and, first imprisoning Hardacre's wrists
tightly with the tie he tore from the latter's neck and knotting
the laces of his shoes together so that he would not be able to
walk, next gave first-aid to the grocer's arm.</p>

<p>"Very little damage there," he announced to the relieved
provision man, "and in a couple of weeks or so you'll be quite
O.K. again." He nodded grimly towards Sleeker. "Very different
from that poor devil. He died a nasty death." He took stock of
the situation. "Now I'll just borrow this fine gentleman's car
and we'll all trek into the station at Manningtree." He regarded
Tom sternly. "You'll have to come, too, and no nonsense."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'll come," said Tom eagerly. "I shall be wanted to
give evidence."</p>

<p>The constable indicated Hardacre, who was now showing signs
of returning consciousness. "Well, help me get this fellow into
the car. You'll have to sit next to him at the back and give me
warning if he tries to get up to any tricks. He'll want watching
directly he gets better." Then, with a consideration that is so
often seen in the roughest men, he covered Sleeker's face over
with the grocer's cap. "We'll leave him for the ambulance to
fetch."</p>

<p>Half an hour later the Superintendent at Manningtree received
one of the surprises of his life when he recognized the green
car with the horse upon its radiator as the one for which the
urgent call had been sent out, barely an hour previously.
Telephone wires began jangling at once. Colchester told Ipswich.
Ipswich passed on the news to Norwich and Inspector Stone learnt
it immediately afterwards. His good-natured face instantly lost
all its weariness. "Gad, what a relief!" he exclaimed to the
Chief Constable who had rung him up. He chuckled delightedly. "I
say, sir, won't our friend Larose be delighted, this fellow
Hardacre bolting back to that Old Mill and so, himself, giving
us the proof he was the poultry-farmer who was there before.
Whew, what a 'clevah fellar' this Gilbert is!"</p>

<p>The Chief Constable hung up the receiver with a grimace which
was half amusement and yet half annoyance. He couldn't help it,
but Larose always irritated him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI. &mdash; THE VENGEANCE OF MAN.</h2>

<p class="first">THE trial of Chester Hardacre aroused
tremendous interest in all parts of the country. The
circumstances surrounding it were so unusual with the accused
being arraigned upon no less than four charges, the murders of
James Werrick, Harold Smith, Andrew Monk and Christopher
Sleeker. The supposed crimes having been committed in different
counties, it had been thought best by the authorities that the
trial should take place centrally, in London at the Old
Bailey.</p>

<p>Lord Witherington was to try the case and, with his cold,
stern face and reputation for impeccable impartiality, it was
generally conceded the scales of justice would be held to the
balancing of a hair.</p>

<p>Peter Shearer, K.C., a silver-tongued orator and great artist
in the spinning of words, was to lead for the Crown, and Bampton
Byles, huge-framed and massive as an ox and the hero of a
hundred battles in the courts, was responsible for the defence.
It was rumoured, and probably not without truth, that the
latter's brief had been marked two thousand guineas.</p>

<p>Upon the morning of the opening day of the trial the Court
was crowded to its utmost capacity, and a somewhat irreverent
young barrister remarked dryly it was to be regretted there was
not a like competition among mortals for accommodation in the
court of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>When the judge had taken his seat and the prisoner stepped
into the dock, a flutter of almost incredulous surprise stirred
the spectators, for the accused was so unlike what they, most of
them, had been expecting. Well groomed and distinguished-looking
and with his handsome face perfectly calm and composed, it
seemed incredible he could have been capable of the dreadful
crimes with which he was now being charged. He let his glance
roam round the crowded Court without the slightest trace of
nervousness or embarrassment.</p>

<p>"But he's not guilty," whispered Lady Carmichael impulsively
to her friend and neighbour, Mrs. Belton-Bevan, whose husband
was a highly popular bishop. "You'll see it'll turn out the
police have made a ghastly mistake." She nodded violently. "Why,
he looks more of a gentleman than even the old judge!"</p>

<p>A deep hush filled the Court, as Hardacre firmly but very
quietly pleaded not guilty to all four charges brought against
him.</p>

<p>When Peter Shearer rose to his feet for his opening address
his voice, though quiet and even, could be heard with perfect
distinctness by everyone.</p>

<p>"My lord and gentlemen of the jury," he began
solemnly&mdash;he indicated the prisoner&mdash;"this man was
once a leper"&mdash;he paused for a long moment&mdash;"and I
shall prove to you that not only was he physically inflicted
with a dreadful malady, but morally, also. As far as we can
trace back into his life he has left a trail of murder wherever
he has been, and he is on trial now for sending four fellow-men
into eternity with a callousness unsurpassed in all the dark
annals of recorded crime."</p>

<p>"Let him prove it," snorted Lady Carmichael under her breath.
"Just let us wait and see," but the bishop's wife, whose first
trial for murder it was, fumbled in her bag for an aspirin and
wished she hadn't come. She felt her stomach turning over most
uncomfortably.</p>

<p>The trial lasted ten days, but as an account of it will be so
much less tedious to the reader when given by a spectator who
touches only on the more interesting high-lights, we will make
use of a letter the Chief Constable wrote to his wife who was
convalescing in a sanatorium in Switzerland after a severe
illness.</p>

<p>He gives an excellent epitome of the whole trial and, after a
few preliminary sentences expressing how relieved he had been to
hear she was getting on so well, his letter reads:</p>

<br>

<p>"Now, my dear wife, I know you will be on tenterhooks to hear
all about friend Hatherleigh's trial for those dreadful murders
he was accused of having done. I don't forget how enthusiastic
you were about him that night he took you in to dinner at old
Colonel Bentley's and what an interesting man you thought him.
Of course, you will have heard the result of the trial, but I
don't expect the Swiss papers will have given many details, so
I'll do my best to make a good story of it, just as if it came
out of a book.</p>

<p>"Well, it was a most remarkable trial, and I am sure no one
present had ever experienced anything quite like it before.
Peter Shearer was as brilliant as ever, and old Bampton Byles a
veritable tower of strength for the defence. The murders were
taken in the order they were said to have been committed and the
trial was expected to be a very long one. It was not, however,
for his lordship kept a tight and common-sense grip on the
proceedings and cut things as short as he could.</p>

<p>"For instance, when Peter Shearer was starting to bring
forward a whole string of witnesses to prove that Hatherleigh,
or Hardacre as we now know him to be, was the Charles Henson who
had consulted Dr. Monk, the Clive Hall at Burnham-on-Crouch, and
the Charles Holt at the Old Mill, he interrupted sharply and
asked if it were really necessary.</p>

<p>"'You are not intending to dispute it, are you?' he demanded
of Bampton Byles.</p>

<p>"'Certainly not, my lord,' replied Byles instantly. 'The
prisoner admits all the identities.'</p>

<p>"So that cleared the ground, and saved a lot of time before
the murder of James Werrick came to be considered first. Now
Peter Shearer had given a most masterly opening address and I
was really astonished at the thorough work the police had put
in. Of course, we could all see the hand of Larose in it and I
am sure the mill stream would not have been dragged but for him.
It was a great personal triumph for him when the axe and two
thigh bones and some ribs entangled in the big chain had been
brought up.</p>

<p>"Still, it was a great pity for his point of view that the
skull was never found, as it was quite reasonably supposed from
the axe having been thrown in the stream that it had been used
to cleave it in. If the skull had been found it might have shown
the injury. However, it was thought the skull might have slipped
past the mill-wheel and, in the many winding miles as the stream
ran on to the sea, have got buried somewhere under the banks or,
perhaps, actually had been washed into the sea itself.</p>

<p>"The real struggle began when Tom Werrick, the brother of the
missing James, went into the witness box and told his
extraordinary story of the bank-notes. Bampton did not attempt
to discredit the story, for there was Millington's gun, with his
initials E.R.M. upon the stock, to make it appear quite
feasible. All he did in his cross-examination of this Tom was to
endeavour to show up in strong relief the despicable character
of his brother and to suggest he would certainly have been as
callous in his treatment of him as he had been callous in the
treatment of everyone else in his hardened and criminal career.
We could see he wanted to make out that because he had not had
any communication with Tom it did not necessarily mean he was
not still alive.</p>

<p>"Then, next in order, Peter Shearer made a great point of the
strong motive Hardacre would have had for killing Harold Smith,
the one-time steward of the club in Hoichow. The boy knew that
Hardacre was wanted by the authorities for a murder in Hoichow
and everything was hanging upon his silence. When, however, it
came to proving that young Smith had even actually been
murdered, everyone could see the Crown had a very weak case, for
the identity of the body found in the drain upon Methwold Fen
was by no means certain.</p>

<p>"The only witnesses there were Hardacre's two maids at the
Manor and they came in for a very bad time when Byles cross-examined
them. You see, the body found in the bag had been quite
naked and so eaten away by the eels that it was wholly
unrecognizable. Yet the girls said they were positive it was
this Harold's body because of the teeth. At least they said that
at first, but after Byles had had them for a quarter of an hour
in the witness box, their being so positive was whittled down to
their 'thinking' it was Harold, being 'almost sure' but not
'certain without the slightest doubt.'</p>

<p>"So the defence undoubtedly scored there, and the two girls
each in turn left the box rather discredited witnesses.</p>

<p>"Next came the murder of Dr. Monk and the first witness Peter
Shearer put in the box was the doctor's daughter. She showed
herself to be an almost ideal witness and her story was drawn
from her, without the waste of a single word. When Peter Shearer
had finished, Byles rose instantly to his feet.</p>

<p>"'Just two questions, if you please, Miss Monk,' he said,
speaking in a kindly and sympathetic tone. 'Now was your father
a reticent man where his patients were concerned? I mean, did he
ever tell you anything about his cases, of course not
necessarily mentioning any names?'</p>

<p>"She shook her head. 'No, he never discussed patients or
their ailments with me. He always kept his professional life and
his private one quite apart.'</p>

<p>"Byles nodded as if he quite understood. 'And the second
question. Of course you will remember most of the things which
happened in those last days in your father's company?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, yes, quite clearly.'</p>

<p>"'Then that Saturday,' went on the ponderous K.C., speaking
very quietly, 'the day before the dreadful tragedy took place,
you say you can remember everything. Well, tell me now, first,
exactly what your father did that day.'</p>

<p>"Miss Monk considered carefully. 'He did not go out
anywhere,' she replied. 'He had his breakfast in bed and did not
get up until about ten o'clock. Then he read the morning
newspaper and pottered about in the garden until after our
midday meal at half-past one. After that he sat on the veranda
in a deck-chair, reading, until about six o'clock. In the
evening he listened to the wireless.'</p>

<p>"'And you?'</p>

<p>"'All the morning I pottered about the house and helped the
daily girl who went home as usual at two o'clock. Then I lay
down for an hour or so for a rest, and afterwards went into the
village to do some shopping, returning home in time to get the
tea.'</p>

<p>"'Thank you. That is all I wanted to prove, that you were
away from the house some time that afternoon,' said the K.C.,
and he resumed his seat.</p>

<p>"The matter of the murder of Dr. Monk over, that of
Christopher Sleeker began, and the first witness, the village
constable of Great Bromley, went into the box. After Peter
Shearer had got all he wanted out of him, Byles rose briskly to
his feet. 'Now, constable,' he said, 'when you saw that car go
round the corner of the Old Mill just in front of you, of course
you were very eager to find out who was in it and what they had
come for at that time of night. You have just told us the car
was being driven at a furious pace and, naturally, that would
have suggested to you some very important matter?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir, it did,' nodded the constable. I couldn't make it
out.'</p>

<p>"'And that being so,' smiled Byles, 'you would have been, to
say the least of it, at any rate a little bit excited?'</p>

<p>"'I might have been,' smiled back the constable. He nodded
again. 'Certainly, I was a few seconds afterwards.'</p>

<p>"'And you tell us,' went on the K.C., 'that you and your
companion, the village grocer, after you had got off your
bicycles, went running as quickly as you both could round the
corner of the mill. Now were you running one behind the other,
or both side by side, together?'</p>

<p>"The constable considered. 'Well, sir, we were almost
together, but perhaps Wilson was just a foot or two ahead of
me.' He smiled again. 'You see, he's a bit of a younger man than
me.'</p>

<p>"'Exactly,' nodded Byles, 'and when you came round the
corner&mdash;I refer particularly to you and not to the
grocer&mdash;you saw the prisoner standing just above a man
lying on the ground. You did not actually see the shot fired
which had struck him, but you heard it a fraction of a second
before you came round the corner?'</p>

<p>"'That is so, sir,' agreed the constable.</p>

<p>"'Now you have just said,' went on Byles, 'that when you
shouted to him to hold up his hands, the prisoner turned
instantly upon you and fired four shots.' He spoke casually.
'Did you count the four?'</p>

<p>"The constable smiled. 'No, sir, all I was thinking of then
was to get at him as quickly as I could. He seemed to be
spitting bullets at us as fast as he could.'</p>

<p>"'But how, then, do you know he fired four shots at you?'
persisted the K.C.</p>

<p>"The constable shrugged his shoulders. 'Well, when we came to
examine his pistol afterwards, we found he had fired it five
times, and so that meant one for the man he killed and four for
us.'</p>

<p>"'Then it would have been merely guess-work on your part,'
smiled Byles, 'that he had fired four times at you if you hadn't
been able to examine his pistol afterwards?'</p>

<p>"The constable looked uncomfortable. 'I suppose so,' he
replied hesitatingly, 'if you put it that way.'</p>

<p>"'Thank you,' said Byles, and he at once resumed Iris
seat."</p>

<p>"The Chief Constable went on: 'It was evident from their faces
that the spectators were very puzzled. They couldn't tell what
Bampton Byles meant by this peculiar line of cross-examination.
However, they were soon to learn that after the next witness had
come into the Court and been a few minutes in the witness-box.
He was Wilson, the village grocer, and, under Peter Shearer's
questioning, he corroborated all that the constable had said had
taken place, stating he had come round the corner as the former
had done, and seen the prisoner standing with a pistol in his
hand over the figure on the ground. Then the prisoner had blazed
away like lightning at them both, missing Constable Bone
altogether but putting a bullet in his, Wilson's, arm.'</p>

<p>"Then Byles, taking over the questioning, said with a most
pleasant smile: 'Of course, Mr. Wilson, you were most interested
when, coming home from your rounds that night, you saw from far
away the light in that lonely house?'</p>

<p>"Wilson smiled back. 'Yes, sir, anyone can bet I was. It was
most suspicious, for I knew no one had any business to be
there.'</p>

<p>"Byles nodded as if he quite understood. 'And, naturally, you
were a bit excited when you were cycling up with Constable Bone
to the house?'</p>

<p>"The grocer nodded. 'Oh, yes, very excited, especially when
we saw the car racing up to the mill, too. Then we couldn't
pedal fast enough. We wondered what the deuce was up.'</p>

<p>"Byles went on: 'And you caught sight of the prisoner just
before Constable Bone did? You came round the corner just before
him?'</p>

<p>"The grocer hesitated a moment. 'Well, perhaps I did, sir,'
he admitted, 'but we were practically both together.'</p>

<p>"Byles smiled pleasantly. 'Now I want to make a test of your
memory, Mr. Wilson,' he said. 'When you used to come on your
rounds to the Old Mill when the prisoner had his poultry there,
sometimes, as a poultry fancier yourself, you used to discuss
your birds with him, didn't you?'</p>

<p>"Wilson smiled back. 'Yes, sir, it is difficult for poultry
men to get away from their pet subject, and he had beautiful
birds.'</p>

<p>"'Then do you remember once telling him,' went on Byles in
the same conversational manner, 'that you had recently paid a
guinea for a sitting of eggs from someone and had had bad luck
with them?'</p>

<p>"Wilson nodded. 'Yes, only three of them had hatched out and
then a cat got all of those.'</p>

<p>"'And you got the cat?' laughed Byles.</p>

<p>"'Oh, yes,' laughed back Wilson, 'I shot her with a
pistol.'</p>

<p>"Byles looked puzzled. 'But how was it you happened to have a
pistol?'</p>

<p>"The grocer looked important. 'Oh, I have to carry one, sir.
I often pick up quite a bit of money on my rounds and one is
continually reading in the newspapers about hold-ups in lonely
places.' He nodded. 'So I was always ready for anything, with my
little pistol in my pocket.'</p>

<p>"'And, of course,' went on Byles casually, 'you had got it
with you that night when you accompanied Constable Bone to the
Old Mill. You had seen suspicious lights and, as you say, were
always ready for anything.'</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps for the first time, the grocer suspected
danger for his answer did not come quite so promptly. 'Ye-es, I
think I had got it with me,' he said hesitatingly, after a long
moment.</p>

<p>"Byles's voice rose sternly. 'You think, you mean you are
sure! Ah, of course, I knew you were!' Then in a lightning flash
he unmasked his guns. 'And not only that,' he thundered, 'but
you made use of it. You fired at the prisoner, but missed him
and killed that fellow, Sleeker. You were so excited that you
did not know what you were doing.' He raised his hand
menacingly. 'Now then, admit it. No, don't stop to think, but
confess it like a man.'</p>

<p>"The grocer's face was ghastly white. He shook and shivered
and looked the very personification of guilt. He tried to speak,
but his dry mouth would not let him get out a word.</p>

<p>"Byles dropped his voice to kind, persuasive tones. 'Come
now, Mr. Wilson, we all know it was an accident. You saw, as you
thought, the prisoner threatening the other man and so you
whipped out your pistol and fired on the impulse. We shall all
know it was not an intentional crime.'</p>

<p>"Wilson found his voice at last and spoke stammeringly and
with difficulty controlling a sob. 'But I didn't do it, sir,' he
answered. 'I swear to you I didn't. I had forgotten I'd got the
pistol with me, and it never came out of my pocket the whole
night.'</p>

<p>"Byles turned another tack. 'Think again, Mr. Wilson, think
again.' His voice was more persuasive than ever. 'You don't
believe you fired it, but you can't be quite sure. Now that's
the position, is it not?'</p>

<p>"But the grocer had now recovered from the stunning effect of
the accusation and was inclined to be resentful for the fright
which had been given him. 'No, it isn't,' he said sharply. 'I
know for certain I didn't fire it.' He looked in the direction
of Hardacre and nodded. 'It was him who fired and he had just
done it when I saw him. I heard the sound just before I turned
the corner.'</p>

<p>"And that was all Byles could get out of him. He couldn't
shake him or make him contradict himself in any way.</p>

<p>"The next and last witness was&mdash;who do you think? None
other than our friend, old Bannister, the Rector of St.
Michael's, and I can tell you he looked pretty sorry for
himself. His evidence was a great surprise to everyone, for I
think only those 'in the know' were aware he had unwittingly
warned Hatherleigh, I mean Hardacre, and given him the chance to
escape.</p>

<p>"He said he had been trying to get the bishop on the phone
that night and, while he had been waiting at the instrument, his
wire had crossed someone else's and he had heard a voice saying
that they had caught Dr. Monk's murderer and his name was
Hardacre. Then later, ringing up Hardacre to invite him to meet
the bishop on the following Sunday, he had passed on what he had
heard.</p>

<p>"You could see the old boy was very ashamed of himself
because it was really through him Hardacre had managed to escape
only a few minutes before Inspector Stone had arrived at the
Manor to arrest him. But that wasn't all, for the Inspector,
very suspicious because Hardacre had suddenly gone out in his
car just before he should have been sitting down to his dinner
and, moreover, learning from the Manor servants that this sudden
bolt had followed directly after a phone talk with the Rector,
had rung up Bannister to know what he had been talking about to
him. Then Bannister, apparently frightened that he had been
gossiping about things he shouldn't, did not give the Inspector
a truthful, or at any rate a correct, answer, thus enabling
Hardacre to get such a long start and, arriving at the Old Mill,
to be the cause of another dreadful death.</p>

<p>"Yes, Bannister felt very ashamed, but no one rubbed it in
because he had come forward voluntarily and cleared up what had
been a great mystery to the police&mdash;how Hardacre had been
warned.</p>

<p>"Well, the case for the Crown having been closed, Bampton
Byles sprang up to open for the defence, and it didn't take
anyone in the Court half a minute to see he was in his best
form. His line of defence was admitting a devil of a lot, but
stopping each time just short of murder.</p>

<p>"His opening words were a sort of parody upon Peter Shearer's
opening ones. 'This man,' he declaimed melodramatically and
indicating the prisoner, 'is a human being'&mdash;he paused
exactly as Peter Shearer had done&mdash;'and it was his
misfortune and not his fault if he were ever infected with
leprosy.' Then he thundered to the jury that they were not
trying the prisoner because he might have been a leper, or
because he had been selfish and anti-social enough to have
avoided segregation. They were not trying him, either, because
he had, knowingly, appropriated stolen money. They were trying
him for murder and murder alone, and they were not to allow his
criminal acts in other ways to prejudice them against him.</p>

<p>"He agreed that upon the surface things did not look too
favourable for the prisoner, and when the latter went into the
box and gave his explanation of what had happened, he, Bampton
Byles, was sure the jury would see everything in a very
different light.</p>

<p>"In the presentation of his case, he said, his learned friend
had relied so largely upon conjecture that he had not once been
able to press home his contentions. He had not been able to show
that the bones found in the mill stream were those of the
missing James Werrick or to make it clear that Harold Smith was
even dead. Then with regard to the killing of Dr. Monk, no proof
had been forthcoming that the prisoner had lately had in his
possession a rifle of the small calibre from which had been
fired the fatal shot.</p>

<p>"The prisoner would admit that James Werrick <i>had</i> come
to the Old Mill and that his apparently fantastic story of a sum
of money being hidden there had turned out to be quite true, and
he would admit again that he <i>was</i> the man who asked those
two girls that Saturday afternoon where Dr. Monk lived. He
would, however, emphatically deny that it was the bullet from
<i>his</i> pistol which had killed Christopher Sleeker, and as
for Harold Smith, he had never laid a finger upon him and seen
nothing of him since he had put him in the train that morning en
route for Birmingham.</p>

<p>"Touching Sleeker's death, it might be wondered why a visit
had not been made at once to the village grocer, and his pistol
impounded. But what would have been the good of it when no
bullet could be produced to show from what pistol it had been
fired? The bullet had not lodged in Sleeker's neck, but passed
right through, and all attempts to find it somewhere on the
ground had failed.</p>

<p>"So it had been thought wisest in the interests of the
defence not to give any warning to Wilson that it was known he
possessed a pistol, but to spring it upon him when he was in the
witness-box, and, in his surprise, attempt to draw from him the
admission that it was he who had fired the fatal shot.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear wife, Byles's speech was very clever, making us
all feel at once that Hardacre's guilt was not by any means as
certain as we had all been thinking. And when Hardacre went into
the witness box and, happening by happening, Byles drew out his
story from him, we were still more than ever in doubt. Hardacre
seemed to be so straightforward and his version of everything
was so plausible.</p>

<p>"He began that he had never been on anything but the
friendliest terms with Werrick, the ex-convict, all along.
Certainly, at first he had not believed his story, but they had
searched together, and just after a week found the money which
had been lowered in a water-tight tin into the mill stream. They
had come upon it early one morning, but the sum hadn't been
anything like what Werrick had imagined it would be, for only
£8,000 in banknotes was in the tin. They had divided it equally
and had been so delighted that when Werrick suggested that they
should 'celebrate' the occasion, he, Hardacre, had at once
agreed.</p>

<p>"So the bicycle had been made rideable for Werrick and he had
gone into Manningtree to get two bottles of the best champagne.
He had left the Old Mill the next morning and that was the last
Hardacre had seen of him. Werrick had said he should leave for
South America by the earliest boat he could get, for as a
ticket-of-leave man he would never be able to enjoy his money in
England, as the police would always be watching him. If he was
known to be spending money freely and enjoying himself, then
they would be wanting to know from where he had got the money
and he would not have been able to account for it.</p>

<p>"Hardacre went on that the next day he suddenly realized
Werrick might, perhaps, become a nuisance and, still worse, a
source of great danger to him. He was obviously a man of
intemperate habits and in a drunken bout he might boast of the
money he had got, and it come to the ears of the police. Then,
as likely as not, they might get the whole story out of him.
Apart from that, when Werrick had spent his money, and he was of
just the very type to get rid of it recklessly and quickly, his
first thought would be to come to him, Hardacre, and blackmail
him for more.</p>

<p>"So Hardacre said he got away from the Old Mill as quickly as
possible, in the circumstances known. He had changed his name
again and started attending race-meetings. He was very
successful and in a few months, wagering heavily, had won more
than £40,000. He bought the Manor at St. Michael's and settled
down.</p>

<p>"Coming to Harold Smith, the contention of the prosecution
that he had been murdered was ridiculous, but he, Hardacre, was
as much in the dark as anyone as to what had happened to
him.</p>

<p>"He had put him in the Birmingham train that morning and that
was the last he had seen of him. He liked the boy and had been
on excellent terms with him and there was no question of their
sharing a dreadful secret between them.</p>

<p>"Certainly there had been a most unhappy affair in Hoichow,
but the death of a fellow-member of the club had been quite
accidental. There had been a dispute over cards, a fight had
ensued and a fatal blow had been struck. Of course, had he
remained in Hoichow he would have been punished, but, at the
worst, it would have meant a fine and social ostracism. The
authorities had, however, been quite agreeable to his getting
away, as they were anxious to save the white community from the
scandal of a public trial.</p>

<p>"As to any corpse having been buried in that shed he was
renting, well, if any corpse had been hidden there, which seemed
to be a matter of great doubt, he certainly knew nothing about
it. He had not been near the shed since February last.
Certainly, he was aware, as Mr. Gilbert Larose had shown, that
the shed was an easy place to break into, as from time to time
several things of his had been stolen from there, including a
small .22 rifle, to which the .22 cartridges found in the
gun-room of the Manor belonged.</p>

<p>"Coming now to Dr. Monk, that Saturday afternoon he
<i>had</i> called to see him openly and with no attempt at
secrecy. At the garden party the previous Monday he had
recognized the doctor and out of bravado had gone up and spoken
to him, intending to let him see how well he was and, in a way,
taunt him for the false diagnosis he had made. Recalling himself
to the doctor's recollection, the latter had, however, been most
conciliatory and, as a personal favour, had asked him to call
upon him one day so that they could discuss his case together.
That he had done at his earliest opportunity. He had gone
straight up to him as he had been sitting reading on the
veranda. They had talked together for nearly an hour and parted
the best of friends.</p>

<p>"That was all he had to do with Dr. Monk. He had not shot him
and, indeed, had not left the Manor that Sunday evening after he
had returned from evening service at the village church.</p>

<p>"Coming to Christopher Sleeker, he had not shot him either.
It was true he, Hardacre, had drawn his pistol when he had been
so startled by suddenly seeing a man come creeping stealthily
along towards him, flattening himself against the house wall so
that he should not be seen. Then, before he could take in what
was happening, he heard the report of a pistol behind him and
the man had crashed to the ground.</p>

<p>"Then he admitted that he, Hardacre, lost his head when he
heard fierce shouting and turned round to see two men charging
at him, one pointing at him with a pistol and the other
brandishing a baton. He realized they had already had no
compunction in shooting down one man and he quite thought they
were intending to murder him. So, he had instantly blazed away
at them. He didn't know how many shots he fired, but he thought
he must almost have emptied his magazine. Then he was struck
violently over the head and he remembered nothing more.</p>

<p>"We had all listened with some sneaking admiration to
Hardacre's story, for there was no doubt it had been very
cleverly and thoroughly thought out. It was a most crafty
attempt to slide out of one awkward situation after another, and
I must say, too, he had a ready and more or less plausible
answer to every question Peter Shearer went on to put to him, in
the ensuing cross-examination.</p>

<p>"He declared James Werrick's patched boot had been left
behind because the man had bought a new pair of shoes when he
had cycled into Manningtree to get that champagne. He did not
know how the axe came to have been thrown into the mill stream,
but suggested it might have been done by the same boys who had
broken so many of the window panes in the house.</p>

<p>"Asked why&mdash;if he were not guilty of any of these
crimes&mdash;he had bolted away so precipitously from St.
Michael's upon receiving the Rector's warning that the police
were coming to arrest him, he gave a most plausible
explanation.</p>

<p>"He said it was not the charge of murdering Dr. Monk that was
worrying him, for he knew quite well he could easily clear
himself there, but he was terrified it might, perhaps, become
public property that he had once been certified as suffering
from leprosy, and he wanted to see his London lawyer instantly
and before his arrest, so that an arrangement might be made with
the authorities to prevent any disclosure in that direction.</p>

<p>"He considered that a vital matter for him as quite recently
an affection had sprung up between him and a young lady and they
had been about to announce their engagement.</p>

<p>"My dear, my dear, that was a spiteful one! Of course,
everyone knew he had been setting his cap at poor little Dorothy
Bannister, but that she had shown clearly she would have nothing
to do with him. Yes, that was a nasty bit of spite to get even
with her. I'm sure it was.</p>

<p>"In conclusion he said he had not had the very faintest idea
he was going to be charged with so many crimes. From what the
Rector had told him over the phone, he imagined he was only
going to be accused of revenging himself upon Dr. Monk for some
fancied injury the latter had done him.</p>

<p>"Now I will pass over the closing speeches of the two King's
Counsel. They were just what you would imagine they would be.
One made you think Hardacre was guilty, and the other that he
was an innocent and very unlucky man. His lordship summed up
very fairly, though I somehow think he leaned rather to the side
of the prosecution. That, of course, would have been only
natural, as the old boy could not have altogether put out of his
mind that Hardacre had admitted himself to be a man of most
unscrupulous character.</p>

<p>"The jury were locked up for two days and a night and we
thought they would never give their verdict. Then, as of course
you have read, they found Hardacre not guilty of murdering James
Werrick, they could not come to any agreement about Harold Smith
or Dr. Monk, but their verdict about the man Sleeker was a
straight-out one of guilty. From the expression upon their
faces, it seemed to me they were relieved at being able to get
Hardacre on this last charge at any rate.</p>

<p>"Then came an extraordinary climax. When Hardacre heard the
last verdict, for a few moments he seemed stunned. Then he
sprang to his feet and, throwing back his head, burst into loud
and hoarse peals of laughter. In a lightning change, however,
his face became contorted in fury. 'You fools, you damned and
idiotic fools!' he shouted fiercely. 'You ought to be in a
lunatic asylum! Oh, you damned fools!'</p>

<p>"So&mdash;exit Hatherleigh, the master of St. Michael's
Manor, the suitor of the pretty Dorothy Bannister and the one-time
star poker player of our club. I understand the authorities
will wait for the result of his appeal against the one verdict
of murder, before putting him on trial again for the two where
the jury disagreed. If the appeal goes against him, of course
the other two charges will be dropped. You can't hang a man more
than once."</p>

<br>

<p>So ended the Chief Constable's letter and his wife sighed as
she put it down. She could not bring herself to believe that the
courtly gentleman she had known as Clement Hatherleigh be as
vile and criminal as had been made out, and, secretly, she
rather hoped he would yet get off. He had been so charming to
her that night at the dinner-party.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">ONE sunny morning in the following summer
Larose was motoring along the great Mile End Road when the idea
came suddenly into his mind that he would go and call on Tom
Werrick. He had not seen him since the last day of the trial,
and was wondering with some amusement how he had got on with the
raising of his brother's spirit from the dead. He found the
little boot-repairer in his shop, looking just the same as ever,
an inoffensive, shy and nervous little man.</p>

<p>For a minute or two they talked about Hardacre and his being
hanged some months previously, and then Larose, repressing a
smile, remarked casually: "Well, Tom, how did you get on about
your brother's ghost? Have you seen it yet?"</p>

<p>Tom nodded gravely. "Oh, yes, sir, several times. Jim hasn't
spoken to me, but he's looked very happy and quite at
peace."</p>

<p>Larose did not laugh. "Oh," he exclaimed as if very
impressed, "then those seances here are still carried on, though
the professor has gone?"</p>

<p>Tom shook his head. "No, sir, I take part in real, proper
seances now, where we are all earnest people and there is no
deceit. We meet every other Sunday in Maida Vale and it cost me
three guineas to join the circle."</p>

<p>"And this other affair was closed down," asked Larose, "the
one where you told me you used to meet over the fried fish
shop?"</p>

<p>Tom frowned angrily. "Yes, sir, and quite right it should
have been closed down, for the man who started to carry it on
after Professor Sleeker was killed turned out to be a scoundrel
and nothing but a fraud. He was Mr. Cookson, sir, who ran the
fish shop downstairs and he was found out and exposed at the
first meeting."</p>

<p>"Good gracious, how did it happen?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Very simply, sir," nodded Tom. "That night Mrs. Faggarty
brought her husband who was an unbeliever, and he suddenly
flashed a big torch in the middle of the seance. Then, there was
Cookson hopping about the room in his socks, instead of, as we
all supposed, sitting with us at the table. He was flapping a
wet cloth to make the cold air of the spirits come, and making
hisses over the top of his false teeth which were so loose that
they were almost falling out of his mouth."</p>

<p>Tom shook his head sadly. "Things became most unpleasant, for
Mr. Faggarty switched on the lights and gave Mr. Cookson a black
eye. Then a regular fight started between them and there was a
lot of noise. Mr. Matty, a little nervous fellow who is a
tailor, got very frightened and ran out and brought in a
policeman, who was very rude and said at first that we were all
drunk."</p>

<p>Larose felt it would be all right to have a laugh now and
indulged in a good one. After a moment Tom joined in, too, but
in a much more restrained way.</p>

<p>"Then, sir, finding no beer about," went on Tom, "the
policeman wanted to make out we were dangerous anarchists and
plotting something, but he only said that because Mr. Cookson
was wearing the red tie he had got in a box of odds and ends
when Professor Sleeker's things were sold up. Then, seeing a lot
of coppers and some thruppences and sixpences scattered over the
floor&mdash;they were Mr. Cookson's takings that night in the
fish shop and had fallen out of his pockets in the
fight&mdash;the policeman said we were running a gambling den
and wanted to take all our names and addresses."</p>

<p>Tom looked very pained at the recollection. "Yes, things
looked as if they were going to be very nasty for us, but we
convinced him he was wrong about the gambling by letting him
smell the money so that he knew it all belonged to Mr. Cookson.
It smelt horribly of fish. Then Mr. Cookson gave him five
shillings and the policeman was persuaded to go off." He sighed.
"We went away, too, and I've never seen Mr. Cookson or any of
the other members since."</p>

<p>"And you don't want to," laughed Larose. "Don't have anything
to do with them."</p>

<p>"No, I shan't, sir," said Tom. He smiled. "I keep better
company now." Then suddenly he leant over across the bench and
whispered very quietly: "But I don't suppose you happen to
remember what date it is to-day?" He nodded darkly. "It seems to
me most strange you should have come to see me this
morning."</p>

<p>"The date?" queried Larose, raising his eyebrows. "Why, it's
August the tenth! What about it?"</p>

<p>Tom spoke very solemnly. "It's three years ago to-day, sir,
when that wretch Hardacre said they found those bank-notes, and
that means"&mdash;his voice trembled&mdash;"it's the third
anniversary of my poor brother's death."</p>

<p>"So it is," nodded Larose gravely. "I had forgotten that."
His face brightened. "Well, at any rate, Hardacre got his
desserts, if he was not actually hanged for the killing of your
brother."</p>

<p>"You think he murdered him, sir?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I'm certain of it," replied Larose. "I haven't the slightest
doubt."</p>

<p>"Then, will you keep a secret," went on Tom, "if I tell you
something very private?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will," nodded Larose. He was curious and added:
"You can trust me."</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you something that will astonish you," he
said. His voice dropped to a whisper again. "No one knows it
except me, but that man Hardacre was hanged because he murdered
my brother. He was not hanged for murdering anybody else, and it
was me"&mdash;Tom gritted his teeth ferociously
together&mdash;"who sent him to the six-foot drop."</p>

<p>Larose frowned. "I don't understand you, Tom. What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>Tom threw his chest out grandly. "I shot Christopher Sleeker
and Hardacre didn't shoot him at all." He went on quickly. "But
it was an accident, of course. It was Hardacre I aimed at, but I
hit the poor professor instead. You see, I was watching Hardacre
from the mill-loft when he tried to lift up that board below,
and I was so close that I could hear him cursing when he broke
his knife. Then when he rushed out, as I suspected to get
something else from his car, I hopped down the ladder and waited
just inside the mill door for him to come round the corner
again. Then I let him have it, but, as I say, my bullet went
wrong and hit the other man."</p>

<p>Larose's face was the very picture of amazement and it was
quite ten seconds before he could even exclaim: "Well&mdash;I'm
damned!" Then he asked sharply: "Did you fire only one
shot?"</p>

<p>Tom nodded. "Yes, I was so nervous that the pistol dropped
out of my hand, but I snatched it up again and hid it in my
pocket." His face broke into a broad and gratified smile. "And
just think of it, Mr. Larose, no one asked me a single question
about having a pistol! At the trial they all just looked upon me
as a crazy fool because I had gone down to the Old Mill to try
to see poor Jim's ghost. You saw how they sniggered and grinned
all the time I was in the witness-box."</p>

<p>"Where's your pistol?" asked Larose. "Have you got it
now?"</p>

<p>Tom smiled craftily. "No, I just haven't. I threw it into the
river over the Tower Bridge, that very night as I was going
home."</p>

<p>They talked on for a few minutes, and then Larose, renewing
his promise not to give Tom's secret away, went off in his
car.</p>

<p>"Fate, fate!" he murmured as he drove away. "How strangely
are all our ways ordained in this grim old world of ours! There
at that trial, probably not one of us was not awed by the cold
and stern majesty of the Law. We saw the judge in his ermined
robe, the great King's Counsels in their wigs and gowns, and the
scores of officials going about their duties in all the pomp and
ritual of so many hundreds of years ago. Yet&mdash;into the
midst of the grandeur of it all&mdash;barges a common-looking
and uneducated little East End boot-repairer, a very nit-wit of
a man, and he throws a spanner into this wonderful machinery,
making justice a thing for mockery and a farce!"</p>

<p>A sudden thought leapt into his mind and he exclaimed
excitedly: "Of course, of course, I understand Hardacre's
dreadful laugh now! He had been found guilty of the only murder
he had not committed and no wonder he shouted at the jurymen
that they were idiotic fools." He chuckled delightedly. "And,
after what Tom Werrick has just told me&mdash;so they were, so
they were!"</p>
